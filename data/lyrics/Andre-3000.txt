[Verse 1: André 3000]
Caroline, Caroline
All the guys would say she's mighty fine
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you cursed out or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this, even though
You'd need a golden calculator to divide
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah

[Hook: André 3000]
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see that roses really smell like poo-poo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-oo

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Caroline, see she's the reason for the word bitch
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Tryna hurry up to get to some baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her make up in the mirror and crash, crash, crash
Into a ditch, just playing
She needs a golden calculator to divide
The time it takes to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said "Shorty, would you call me?" She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Tricking off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you

[Hook]

[Bridge: André 3000]
Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasing cars
What happens when the dough gets low
Bitch, you ain't that fine, no way, no way, no way

[Outro: Big Boi]
Crazy bitch
(Bitch, stupid ass bitch, old punk-ass bitch
Old dumb-ass bitch, a bitch's bitch, just a bitch)
[Verse 1]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here, started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

[Bridge]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

[Hook]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 2]
They keep telling me don't save you, if I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right, then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last.. Tunechi

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies
[Chris Brown]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothing but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Drake]
What you mean I ain’t call you? I hit you when I landed
I’m waiting in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguing more and it’s getting less romantic
Yeah, I think she’ll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I’ll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay, for real
You looking bad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I’m willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah but tell them bitches that you’ll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
It’s useless all this fighting let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten; ice cold like Michigan
Look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening
Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killing me, but soon its gon' be killing you
To see her in that two seater, now that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me
By now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
Into the wind, again, again. and deuces I must throw ya peace

[Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I’mma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
I’m stupid but I won’t get my drama on
What I’m dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who” I don’t know who you talking 'bout

[Fabolous]
According to my old bitch I be on some new shit
She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch
Think I give two shits? you ain't gonna do shit
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better you’d do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

[Chris Brown]
So you gonna diss me even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gonna

[Drake]
(miss me a little when I’m gone)

[Fabolous]
Drizzy voice, now I’m ghost baby
Four door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I’m bout my business boys, plus I make paper
Come on that's old news, yesterday’s paper
Oh, you talking, what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut ya mouth
You’ll never score another me, I’ll shut it out
Act like there’s gum in your hair girl, cut it out

[Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds
She the only one is missing
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it
Got a racing Lamborghini have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talking ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in the hall of fame
I let my denim sag #red Louis belt
How can you love me baby, first you gotta love yourself

[Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for, ain't rich ain't poor
I want it to do more but hell I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousins house to see if I was there
Get ya minds out the gutter man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But shit they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop making sad songs

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her; to her
[Intro]
1, 2, 3: go!

[Verse 1]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sho
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking through together
Cause we don't know how

[Hook]
Hey ya!

[Verse 2]
You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But "got it" just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all
We've been together
Oh, we've been together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes - then what makes
Love the exception?
So why oh why
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

[Hook]

Uh-oh!
Don't want to meet your daddy
Just want you in my Caddy
Don't want to meet your mama
Just want to make you cumma
I'm just being honest!

[Bridge]
Hey, alright now
Alright now fellas (Yeah!)
Now what's cooler than being cool?
(Ice cold!) I can't hear ya
I say what's cooler than being cool?
(Ice cold!)
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright.. OK: now ladies
(Yeah?)
We're gonna break this back down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor! Ah, here we go!
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

Now all the Beyonce's and Lucy Lius
And babydolls, get on the floor
(Get on the floor)
You know what to do
Oh, you know what to do!
[Hook]
Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "y"
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I - Aquemini

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on like Spike Lee said, "Get on the Bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin' it's a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch, familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman, how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat man
I'm strapped man and ready to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain steering wheel
For real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack
Instead of going into overkill pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Twice upon a time there was a boy who died
And lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors and baby bottles and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts
You know, how to work bread, cheese and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what you bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge now meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'
More than a hobby, when my turntables get wobbly they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all, I often drift, I'm talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed so what have you
Now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's Outkast's Aquemini, another black experience

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Saxxx
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
Cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that, some say we pro-black, boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme we bust back
Get get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear dat can't come near dat maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea yea yea yea

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben, welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it, that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
Andre, this is Andre, y'all are just gon' have to make amends

[Hook]
[Hook]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Sir Luscious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados; I'm wakin up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print?
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, ath-letes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make
Cause...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga - Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' - dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'mma show you how to - wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on yo' zipper, lick you like a - lizard when I'm slizzerd
Or sober; six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass round eight-ish I know you'll be there for me girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin off at they mouth
And tellin me everything that's on yo' nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, love who you ain't; you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk
In double time the boy next do's a freak, ha ha!

[Hook]

[Outro: André 3000]
(And we are...)
The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
(And my my...)
The sky is fallin ain't no need to panic
(But ooh ooh...)
I got a stick and want yo' automatic
(Ooh ooh ooh...)
Compatible created in the attic
[Hook]
Damn damn damn James

[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
Dickie shorts and Lincoln's clean
Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, blizzes lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out here come the folks (Damn - oh lord)

[Verse 2: André 3000]
As the plot thickens it gives me the dickens
Reminiscent of Charles a lil' discotheque
Nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia a lil' spot where
Young men and young women go to experience
They first li'l taste of the night life
Me? Well I've never been there; well perhaps once
But I was so engulfed in the Olde E
I never made it to the door you speak of, hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems
And the troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "Set it Off," in the right
But it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it
"Hey hey look baby they playin' our song"
And the crowd goes wild as if
Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M
And three niggas just don' got hauled
Off in the ambulance (sliced up)
Two niggas don' start bustin' (wham wham)
And one nigga don' took his shirt off talkin' 'bout
"Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Courts?"
It's just my interpretation of the situation

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on, ya know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig)
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and
The next four years you & somebody's daughter
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations (that is)
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the
United Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office
Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap just that, trapped
Go on and marinate on that for a minute

Jay-Z: You ain’t got enough stamps in your passport to fuck with Young H.O
Ice Cube: Dada Dada
Jay-Z: International
Ice Cube: Papa Dock
Ice Cube: What up Jay
Jay-Z: Show young boys how to do this thing
Ice Cube: You know me, Ice Cube, I'm like a Glock nigga, I always got a hot sixteen, knamean

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
I was a young lad of seventeen
My life had yet to show its ugly face
Only a pretty façade, hey God it's me
Remember three, thousand
The one who used to pray to be a rapper
My child's in the third grade
His favorite rapper wasn't rapping till he heard me
I wasn't rapping till I heard something called Erik B
And Rakim's Paid in Full
Rapper's really gettin' paid in full
So full that the kid's dont go to school in hopes of becomin' one of us
The only requirement is your bus
Now college is lookin' slim, product is hookin' them
Before their brains fully develop they get enveloped by the the vision tele
The television tells them their vision
Now it's hard for them to make decisions with out feelin'
Uncooled, unschooled, thumb rule
Rule of thumb, can't be dumb
I wish I would've studied abroad
Well I studied a broad and she studied me back
And my course was hard
That was that, this is this, listen up
Cause all I'm saying is
If thirty's the new twenty, thirty's the new twenty for them wheels as well
They lookin' for the mic or some pills to sell
While the girls are steady graduatin'
Nigga's standin' on the corner hatin', debatin'
Well should I get the new J's or the Kobe's
And they rollin' so they wide awake for four days
Ha, I'm a G-entleman, let's get re-aquainted
I am Andre Benjamin

[Hook: Jay-Z]
I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to play the block like that
I used to carry knots like that
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy, cause I’m all grown up, ha

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Ya’ll roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day
Ya’ll young’uns chase, I’m Patron' it straight
I like South Beach but I’m in St. Tropez
Ya’ll drink Dom, but not Rose’
Hey, ya chick shop at the mall
My chick burning down Bergdorf’s
Comin' back with Birkin bags
Your chick is like, what type of purse is that
I’m from the era when niggas don’t snitch
You from the era where snitchin' is the shit
I’m afraid of the future
Ya’ll respect the one who got shot, I respect the shooter
Ya’ll go to parties to ice grill
I go to parties to party with nice girls
Young boys gotta chill, thirty’s the new twenty, nigga I’m so hot still

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Jay-Z, what can a young motherfucka tell me
About the LAPD, about the air that we breathe
Nothin', nada, zero, zilch
I want tits for fun, you want tits for milk
I'm all leather and silk, your fuckin' t-shirt look like a quilt
Playground king, climb the monkey bars that I built
Thirty's the new twenty, Phantom's the new Bentley
Nigga, dont tempt me, I'll bury you up in Tempe
And if I catch a ghost rider, tie him to a tree, gasoline like the lighter
Burn, you motherfuckin' fighta, treat you like George Bush treat Al-Qaeda
This is Guantanamo, think I'm a ho, I made the honor roll, mixed with Geronimo
Before this mic will pass, learn how to wipe your nose before you wipe your ass

[Hook]
I met you in a club in Atlanta Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like yeah nigga right
But you gave me you number anyway you were on the talcum
Powder, how's about them oranges
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a mission impossible
We were both the same age but I
Suppose wasn't on the same page but in
The same book of life so I'd paged you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We starting hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head I'm thinking cool
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be
Heaven or hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
You'd dropped me off by the dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
Now are these niggas in this house up to something
Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?
Well, yes and no
Yes we were selling it
But no it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled ?ho?
Meanwhile the video starts playing
BET college radio and a van
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear
You know what I'm saying
But, I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home
But, when I got home I never did
By the time I did, heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur
Who replied see you later when he got the good news, that's life shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque but I'm living with my pop pop
So I got Glock and a LoJack
You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much because half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you tell me then I'll double back
But keep in mind, at the time "keep it real" was the phrase
Silly when said now, but those were the days
When spring break
And Daytona
And Freakniks
Made you wanna
Drop out of college and never go back
Move to the south but that ain't a Kodak
Moment, on went myself and Big Boi
Well you knew him as Twan
That's right you were around before this shit begun
When Twan had a daughter and
Sort of was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like Jack
Laughed and cried and drowned it back with some Yak
Girls used to say, y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?
And I'd laugh and they just keep smiling
No, I'm from Atlanta baby
He from Savannah, maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down hey we
Got to go because the bus is pulling out in 30 minutes
She's playing tennis disturbing the tenants
15-love
Fit like glove
Description is like
15 doves
In a Jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose, agree?
Enough about me
How's about you?
How's the lil' kid?
She was about 2 the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
Cause I'd start the 2nd album off on another note
Now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see I'd balled out, and before I fall out
I'd Slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain is that fried egg I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor staring
So changing my style was like release for the primitive beast
Yes I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread-Never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet muslims, ganstas, bitches, rastas, and macaroni niggas - impostors
So on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dredz with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now you know her
As Erykah on and on Badu
Called Tyrone on the phone, why you
Do that girl like that boy you ought to be ashamed
The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name
We're young, in love, in short we had fun
No regrets no abortion, had a son
By the name of Seven
And he's five
By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six
You do the arithmetic
Me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded me throw the darts
To poke you in the heart
And take you from the start
To when luxury transportation meant a Marta card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays
Momma or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she's smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
You fix it up.. you trick it out.. you give it rims.. you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
..And that's as far as I got

[Dialogue]
And that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go
Knowing the whole time that's all you could think about
Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up
You need a jump like you'll need in your rump to grow
And you change all the time so that rabbit that you thought about
That whole summer, the next summer you didn't want that rabbit no more
You wanted something bigger and better

So the summer past and the rabbit is old?

Right, right, so now you want a Cadillac...

[Intro: André 3000]
Niggas in the point ain't changed (x2)
Yeah...

[Beat switch]

[Verse 1: André 3000]
A nigga ready from the get go, blow, blow, blow
Y'all hear my shit go, it's Andre
Can yo punk ass come out to play
Stay in your little hole, then coward duck your head
You don't know who you be fucking with you'se better off, dead
Is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp
Make yourself exempt
Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck, bullets fly, niggas die
By getting blasted, how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
But naw, I take that back, that's my problem
Turning and walking away, this ain't gon work when they be robbing
As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome
Step up nigga, if you want some

[Hook] (x2)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo chest (it's the joint)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well nigga, you softer than silicone, used to pump up tits
It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50
Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope, but in 1994
I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives cause I was steadily in the mix
Yeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Just an international playa, coming through your stereo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: André 3000]
3-5-7 to your forehead
There'll be mo' dead cause I'm a pro, kid
But Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me
My nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me off my street
But in my hood hood, they hollering ghetto
Don't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew
On the concrete, remember when we ran deep
Remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy
They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
Tripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me
One is in the air and one is the chamber
Y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger
Quick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day
At a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch
Just let you know, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling
Do more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac
I got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun
And got my pump under my seat
In case these youngsters wanna have some fun
I'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this a heater
Load it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it
The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
See I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you
You 'posed to be quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster
1-2-3, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fucking slave, you better try another way
To take me out, is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me, unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets letting loose my last clip
I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped
You know that's how I do, you know that's how I do

[Hook]

[Outro : Big Boi]
Yeah and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking
Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas
Around the East Point way
College Park is really on the map
We coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped
With the mothafucking guns and the motherfucking Glocks
The heaters, the gats nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop
[Intro: Andre 3000]
Yeah! Killer keeps it honest
Cause reality is perception with a weak stomach
Bubbling uneasy like the bowels of hell (Boo!)
Enough to make a black ghost turn pale

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
K-I-L-L
This is the name that came to alter the game
Not like these rappers who spit it the same
Separate lames from they chain
My mind don't slack
I'm totally focused on beating up tracks
Monsterous music to beat in your 'Lac
1000 watt amp with woofers in back
Lean to da left if you burning a sac
Baby got back and its in Baby Phat
Pardon me dog 4 chasing the cat
I'm hittin all kittens meowing like that
I like the front but I'm loving the back
I like to bite and I'm hoping she scratch
Escalade dipping I'm holding the lane
Mama's a scholar she blowing my brain
Ain't that the life?
Snapping & Trappin and Rappin & Frappin all night
Lil mama's a plumber she handling pipe
Ill wit a pill she handle it right
Like Iverson, the smallest thing on the team
But the livest one
Cocked loaded bust like a gun
Y'all better run, one, one!

[Hook: Killer Mike & Big Boi]
Thump, thump, thump, thump (yeah)
All in your trunk (yeah)
Grinding and hustling and getting at mine
Swerving and token and grippin on pine

Bump, bump, bump, bump
All in your trunk
Woofers and tweeters and speakers and geekers
Crawl in your bunk

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
How we gon' stop (whooa)
How we gone quit (shitttt!)
Brand new shoes and socks on the Chevy
I came through swerving like this (errrrr!)
Good wit the game, gutter fo' show
Ducking you lames and obstacles
Don't get that ass in a hospital
Wrapped in a cast from head to toe
This boy he real!
Racing those candy Sevilles through Dixie Hills
My car do wheelies they drive on three wheels
First round pick like Michael Vick
Quarterback status throw passes at chicks
Santana Moss When catching the ball
Get it? Like Moss she catches the ball
Perfectly tuned my engine don't stall
And I'm equipped with nitros y'all
Ready to rip, burn, roar!
Ready to tear through your city and tour
Took The Whole World and murdered that shit!
Caught the beat running and dipped with that bitch!
Later for now I'm hustling hits
Flipping my words like bricks, trick!

[Hook]

[Outro]
New, new! That new-new!
New-new for you-you!
New-new for you-you!

That new-new! That new-new!
New-new for you-you!
New-new for you-you!
[Intro - Andre 3000] + (Killer Mike)
(Let's do this {shit})
Yeah! Killer keeps it honest
Cause reality is perception with a weak stomach
Bubbling uneasy like the bowels of {hell} (Boo!)
Enough to make a black ghost turn pale
(YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!)

[Killer Mike]
Madden 04
This is the name that came, to alter the game
My quarterback fires, slangin' that thang
Two minute drill, we runnin' it mayne
DEFENSE, DON'T SLACK!
Pushin' ya line, crackin' ya quarterback
Laying that wood, he's flat on his back
Ya receivers is shook, missin' they catch
My receiver's a dog, run and they fetch
Ya runningbacks weak, left on his neck
MADDEN IS IT, YEAH!
No better feeling, then gripping the stick
Returning my punts, nailing my kicks
My runningbacks real, fakin' is sick
HALFBACK, DON'T STOP!
Touchdown bound, Jeff, follow his block
My offensive line, locking the block
Fourth and inches, we can't be stopped
Third and long, we stretching the field
Chasin the corner, see if he chill
OFFENSE, WON'T STOP, NO!
DEFENSE, WON'T STOP, NO!
Yeah we braggin, and hitting and taggin'
On Madden 2004, YEAH!

[Hook - Killer Mike]
Madden 04, (YEAH!)
It's grime time, let's go (YEAH!)
Bringin the pain, I'm laying the wood
Quarterback status, I'm throwing it good
Madden 04, (YEAH!)
It's grime time, let's go (YEAH!)
Runnin' and gunnin', and stuffin' the hole
Nothin' is realer than 2004!

[Outro]
Nu-nu, that

[Hook]
Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "y"
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I - Aquemini

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on like Spike Lee said, "Get on the Bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin' it's a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch, familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman, how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat man
I'm strapped man and ready to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain steering wheel
For real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack
Instead of going into overkill pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Twice upon a time there was a boy who died
And lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors and baby bottles and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts
You know, how to work bread, cheese and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what you bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge now meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'
More than a hobby, when my turntables get wobbly they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all, I often drift, I'm talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed so what have you
Now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's Outkast's Aquemini, another black experience

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Saxxx
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
Cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that, some say we pro-black, boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme we bust back
Get get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear dat can't come near dat maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea yea yea yea

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben, welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it, that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
Andre, this is Andre, y'all are just gon' have to make amends

[Hook]
[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oooh and you
You and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
And you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

[Hook: Andre 3000]
We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back too, you go back too
You go back too

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I, I loved you much
It's not enough
I love blow and you love puff
And life, is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

[Hook: Beyonce]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back too
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back too, I go back to black
[Gorilla]
Its about to get bananas in here
Hey look at that ape,over that baby

[Hook]
Banana Zoo ooh baby, do want you wanna do
Banana Zoo ooh shawty move like an animal
Now go down low, don't stop now swang like orangutang
Now take it slow, go on an walk now and watch him do his thing
But just don't tap the glass

[Gorilla]
Don't tap the glass

I beat on my chest because I am the best
I'm the king of the jungle
And I ain't lying
Get I ain't lying
I ain't lying
Naw I a'int no lion
Now you can tell King Kong
He don't run this
You can't throw no monkey wrench in this
Now whats the name of my town

Banana Zoo ooh baby, do want you wanna do
Banana Zoo ooh shawty move like an animal
Now go down low, dont stop now swing like orangutang
Now take it slow, go on an walk now and watch him do his thing
But just don't tap the glass, don't tap the glass, don't tap the glass
Don't tap the glass, don't tap the glass, don't tap the glass
Uh o
Gorilla, go, gorilla go,go, gorilla go, gorilla go, go
Gorilla go, gorilla go, go, Gorilla go, gorilla, go, go
Now move like a monkey, Now move like a monkey, now move like a monkey, now move like a monkey
Hold up!

[Gorilla]
Hey, can you tell Mr. zookeeper to please order me a 1000 pounds of banana pudding
I would love that
(Andre 3000)
Sophistafunk, aristocats
Distinguished stars, clean up your acts
Pull up your pants, ladies and gents
Please, act like you got some sense
You know what I really wanna know?
Where do all the good girls go
What clubs they hang in?

[Hook]
Behold a lady
I see you standin' on the wall
Clap, clap... you deserve it all (Repeat)
(Ad libs)
Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find
The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?

(Verse 1)
Today I might snow, tomorrow I'll rain
3000's always changing but you stay the same
And I need that, hey I need that (in my life)
When I feel washed up and inadequate
And throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get
You make me smile, you make me smile
You make me smile, you make me... (Hoooooooo!)
You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking
You won't let me drown and I'm grateful
(Awwaww Awwawwawwawwawwwwawww!)

[Hook]

(Verse 2)
Yo' mama's old fashioned, yo' daddy don't play
You'll always be this lovely
Cause they raised you that way
Hallelujah! Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
You're not extra extra, you're so plain Jane
The ying to my yang, darlin'
You've got that thang and you know it
But yet you don't and that's what's so cool
You don't say too much, but when you do it's profound
In the street you hold your head high
At home you get low down for me
(Can't get no lower, can't get no lower, can't get no lower, yeah!)
Hooo! You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown (Aaaaaaahh!)
(Ad libs)
Sad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums
To see what a lady looks like
So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight
If you spot one, good sir, treat her right
This is Benjamin Andre signing off
Thanks a million
Good luck and goodnight

[Intro: Andre 3000]
I told that bitch, I told that bitch
I told that bitch, I told that bitch
I told that bitch, I told that bitch
Yeah, this for the niggas with Benzes and the niggas without 'em
Scram, ho!

[Hook: Andre 3000]
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
And I don't want no bitch who need to have that kind of friendship
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
And I don't want no bitch who need that kind of nigga, scram, ho

[Bridge x2: Future & Andre 3000]
These cars don't mean shit, these hoes don't mean shit
These clothes don't mean shit, these shows don't mean shit, whoaaaaa
(Whatchutola, what, whatchutola)
(Whatchutola, what, whatchutola)

[Verse 1: Future]
Graduated from the fabricated sabotages
Conversated with a lady goin' Lambo crazy
Bitch, you better cut it, shawty, I'm 'bout to cut you off
Oh, you greedy in Tahiti, I just seen your flaw
Aye, tell that girl you 'bout to settle, whatchu tired of?
Aye, see how she react when you're no longer in your Beemer
Then she find out that the Bentley wasn't really rented
Can you sell a kilo? Help a nigga move a kilo
Oh, you want the private jet to take a flight to Rio
Can't no Maybach prevent a nigga from makin' mula
Oh, you gold diggin' diggin' graveyard loser
Ain't none of my cars American, King of Zamunda
Let's have a heart-to-heart, drink wine, make art
Backseat of the Benzo, the AMG
Can you love a thug, is all make believe
Pure fantasy, I see through it easily

[Hook: Andre 3000]

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
I told the girl I'm 'bout to sell the Porsche, I'm tired of it
She go and told these folks I'm goin' broke, a smile poured
From my lips, cuz if I'm broke, it's only hearted
Broken records from broken English, that's all it
Hol' up and if I were, why? Would you throw a party?
Affection is so convenient when ballin'
Correction: these hoes don't mean it when fallin'
I guess that's why Lois can't be with Clark Kent
Fly on a nigga back while he Superman
But if I'm in a wheelchair, you still there?
Stop searchin' for words, I feel stupid, man
The shit is the Pittsburgh, I still care
White button downs and Emory scrubs
Had to write her birthday down because my memory sucks
But this shit comes back up like some acid reflux
Or a Michael Jackson jacket with some plastic zippers
I was zippin' through the city and I don't give a fuck
1994 Toyota Land Cruiser because
That bitch ain't never broke down on me, why would I do that to her?
Simplism, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club
And might not never buy a new car again, if I can help it
Cause if I buy one, they gon sell ten, then what I'm left with?
Throw a nigga one on the strength, then we might could talk
Til' then, I will ride my fuckin' bike, or walk
Eh?

[Hook: Andre 3000]

[Verse 3: Future]
I told that girl, I told that girl tell the truth
Say she the realest bitch I ever met, then show me some proof
These girls be droppin' these lies, these girls be makin' shit up
She don't wanna stand in my line, she tryna come to the front

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Yeah, she love her country but hate American cars
For the shape of them, he'll have you know all of them bitches is foreign
If yellow seems to be the color in fashion
What happens to all of this good black pussy he keep ignorin'?
The world told him didn't shit rhyme with orange
The girl is only with him because he's tourin'
Well go on angel, I don't blame you, don't hang yo head
I know it's survival for you, get it like an IOU

[Verse 5: Future]
She's so, materialistic
I'm just enjoyin' life, I'm livin' life, you know?
That worldwide pussy, yeah, worldwide pussy, yeah
Pull up at this girl crib bumpin' Lil' Boosie, yeah

[Hook: Andre 3000] + [Bridge: Both]

[Outro: Future]
We drive these cars on the regular
This life that I live is incredible
We gon be fly whenever, we gettin' richer forever
Without these foreign vehicles, can we still gon' be together?
Tell me
[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
1, 2.. 1, 2, 3; yeah!
Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground
Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans
You can't stop a train
Who want some? Don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9, Anno Domini, anything goes, be what you wanna be
Long as you know consequences are given for livin' - the fence is
Too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell - HOT!
Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell, look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm and Hammer, soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of question with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousands miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always mo', OWWWW!

[Hook] (2x)
[Dre] Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
[Choir] Bombs over Baghdad!
[Dre] Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
[Choir] Bombs over Baghdad!

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend, dyin' to geek
Outkast bumping up and down the street
Slantback, Cadillac, 'bout 5 niggas deep
75 MC's freestyling to the beat
Cause we get krunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should have bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Should have held back, but you throwed a punch
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan
Never turn my back on my kids for them
Should have hit it, quit it, rag top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control"
Like Janet, plan it, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, coming straight to Florida
Lock all your windows then block the corridors
Pulling off a belt cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece just 'fore I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pitty pat rappers trying to get to 5
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL boy you betta not hide
Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, hah!

[Outro]
Bob your head, rag top x16
Power music, electric revival x15
[Andre: intro (Hook)]

On some spooky dooky shit (spooky dooky)
B-O-O-G-I-E M-A-N
You know the one who make ya'll suckers wanna run
The one that make you wanna spend more QT with your son
Nobody that I know no longer do this shit for fun I am the
B-O-O-G-I-E M-A-N
You know the one who make a sugar drop her drawers
I dig her cause she's honest and she do me just because
She wanna and I wanna that's on the Niagara Falls I am the...

[Big Gipp]
You can catch me in a white DTS with the top popped
Little buddy under my seat
It shoot hot rocks
Make the sucka Po' get loose
Jiggy purr with me shorty jiggy purr ya gurl
Candle lights the world swiftly
Big Gipp AKA the city miracle mutant motherfucker from birth
I stay down for the ready-ready
Caught some media, spaghetti
Off in Japan they call me Yeti
I'm the Boogie Man

[Andre 3000: Hook]

[Big Gipp]
I'm Mr. Boogie Boogie from the goodie goodie Gipp
Put my oogie oogie between your camel foot, so stay put
A straight dog when I'm chasing the platypus
My intellectual qualities superior to most
I love a girl with a fat back
Knee cut, rack, toes showing, Po'
Holdin my eyes swollen
Cause I stare so hard, with no regard
Girl make that change, Shake that thang mama!

[Andre 3000: Hook]

[Big Gipp]
Touched what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun Sky high, sky high
Baby girl didn't even tell me bye-bye
She was gone without dropping the digits
She was gone without using my kitchen
She left without kissing my lips
One more time I wanna hold them hips
I hope we meet up again on a lunar eclipse

[Andre 3000: Hook]
[Intro: Gwen Stefani and Johnny Vulture]
C'mon, Johnny! When you're gonna get here?
(Alright, hold your pretty horses, I'll be there in a minute
You just get yourself dolled up, alright Tootsie?
You pick a place! You just pick a place!)
Um, Johnny?
(Yeah, Gwennie-Gwen-GWEN?)
You might wanna hurry
Because tonight, is the night

[Verse 1]
I'm empty, I need fulfilling, yes I do love, a-to the ceiling
When I do love, I get this feeling when I'm in love
I'm restless, can't you see I try my bestest? To be a good girl
Because it's just us so take me now, and do me justice
I'm waiting, a-patiently anticipating your arrival
And I'm hating, it takes so long to get to my house, to take me out

[Hook]
Tonight I'm gonna give you all my love, in the back seat
Bubble, Pop, Electric
Bubble, Pop, Electric
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the backseat
Bubble, Pop, Electric; Uh-oh! In the backseat

[Verse 2]
Okay now, I understand he's on his way now
But jeez Louise, I mean today now!
I can't wait, I wanna play, now!
I'm antsy, Bubble Pop Electric pansies
My sweet tooth, I want your candy
The Queen of Eng would say it, randy
I'm itchy, I wish you would come and scratch me
Tonight I'm falling, won't you catch me?
Swoop on by so you can snatch me and take me out

[Hook]

[Interlude: Gwen Stefani & Johnny Vulture]
The need to be satisfied
Come pick me up, I want a ride
(Hey Johnny! Lemme go grab my sweater)
(Hi, Mrs. Stefani) (Bye, Mom!)
Hurry, hurry come to me
(So, baby where you wanna go, huh?)
Drive-in movie
Drive in move me
Drive into me

[Bridge x2]
Bubble Pop Electric, you've gotta get it
Straight to me, drive-in movie
Take it to the back seat, run it like a track meet
Come to me, drive-in movie

[Hook]

[Outro: Gwen Stefani & (Johnny Vulture)]
(Yeah, tell your father, I said 'ello!)
Johnny, get outta here!
[Verse 1: André 3000]
I'll be coming around the ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm picking em up and throwing em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cause I slam the sons of bitches
I ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode
Then cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question "Should we take that bullshit from them people?"
I'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of suckas tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me (x4)

[Verse 2: T-Mo]
As I step up, the stage is empty
No words cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' mane
Smoking that dang dang, making mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block
Just like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts
Damn, I'd probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam
To bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B
Don't flex, I'm next, I break necks too
Rolling with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas
Not ducking 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kicking it
Coming around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Khujo]
Khujo, coming in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into capping
Throw in a few more logs, so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked
But you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass
I could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go no holds barred
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Uncaged, Parkay
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...
Dope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chappell Forest, it's gettin horrid
The hunted child is on the prowl, yahhh!!!!!
I let out a call to da wild
I let out a call to da wild
[Verse 1: André 3000]
Yo, this is my story, this is my song
And to them rudypoos don't attempt to try this at home
It's just a poem until y'all learn right from wrong
Know when to bless a situation, when to grab the chrome
But it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia
Overcast, but on behalf of Outkast, I cordia-lly
Invite you to an emotion filled theater
Bring your umbrella cause young fella it gets no weirder

[Hook]
We reign, reign, supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spiced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

You are now about entering the fifth demension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high
High, yeah, yeah my lord

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
To make one bob they head would be the track job
Your job's to spit that fire
Some of y'all MC's take this rhymin' for granted, I won't comply
With that slackin', poppin' and crackin' Fourth Ward say we snappin'
They want that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
What's happenin', see if do what yo won't do today boy
Will I live tommorrow like you can't even live cause you strayed
Motivational skills lackin', when I see you nigga you packin'
Understand that though, you behind a $75,000 car doe
But still stay with mom though, playing the King like Don doe
You choked up, you was the nigga that supposed to be so loced up
Makin' them think Hip Hop is dead, exhume the body if you ain't scared
And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg

[Hook]
Chronomentrophobia, the fear of clocks
The fear of time...

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
High's the cost of living
I take what I have been given
Pastor say, be strooong
Hooo yeahhhhahhh
I ain't' got tiiiime
Leave me aloone

[Bridge]
Ain't that much time left
I've got to fuck you now

[Hook]
Chronomentrophobia [repeat 8x]

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Lord, be havin' mercy on my soul
I'm havin' the impression that my life gonna be a bowl of cherries
But it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't' got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while ya'll made up yo beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I lay my head
Born in 1975
Never thought I'd make it this far
Still battlin' in this racial war
Tryin' to find solutions to the situation I'm facin'
Only thing that's free is my flow that yall be chasin'
Lettin' my niggas know before I go
I drop that knowledge like dropping books
Let's stop the crooks from robbing of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good
You enter my hood you won't be findin' much
Hope that when I'm gone ya'll remember this
What we stood for, fuck that fame and that glitz
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
Got to be more careful, know what corners you be bendin'
Revelations getting impatient
Now I'm dead
Remember what I said
I'm gone
Bow ya heads
[Intro]
Chronomentrophobia... The fear of clocks... The fear of time

[Verse 1]
High as the cost of living
I take what I've been given
Pastor say "be strong"
Ooh hey hey
I ain't got time leave me alone
I ain't got much time left
I've got to funk you now

[Hook]
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia

[Verse 2]
Lord be havin mercy on my soul
I'm havin the impression that my life gon be a bowl
Of cherries but its very hard for me to cope
Got tired of bein broke
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975 never thought I'd make it this far
Still battlin in this racial war
Tryin to find solutions to the situation I'm facin
Only thing thats free is my flow that y'all be chasin
Lettin my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge
Like droppin books lets stop the crooks
From robbin you of your brains and such usin welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good you into my hood you won't be findin much
Hope that when I'm gone y'all remember this
What we stood for "fuck that fame and that glitz"
It's beginnin to look a lot like the endin
And got to be more careful know what corners you be bendin
Revelations gettin impatient and now I'm dead
Remember what I said I'm gone bow ya heads
Man, have you ever really wondered
Like why are we here? What the meanin to all of this?

[Hook: Big Boi]
Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Now if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh..
(HALL-LE, LU-JAH)

[Verse One: Big Boi]
Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load
My life is goin downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen, I
Don't think that I can get out this hole
Feel like the figure four leglock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday livin
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they livin
The unforgiven or the unwillin, live a life of sinnin
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginnin

[Interlude]
But what about repentance?
What about the tension?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
But what about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah..

[Hook - singers]
Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me - what are we here foooooooorrrrrrrrrr?
OW!

[Verse Two: Big Boi]
Life, is nothin but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're bein evil then you on the devil's team
Well I receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask, to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
As you survey the syllables and sentences
The question that I'm merely tryin to pose is as simple as me sayin

[Interlude]

[Hook] (minus HALL-LE-LU-JAH singers)

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well it is I, the pimp playing nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
And nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit, I studied the Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon

[Hook : Big Boi]
I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Oh heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me
Growing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap of dap when niggas slanging quarter keys
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking
I think about payback, strap myself and keep on danking
Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

[Hook]
