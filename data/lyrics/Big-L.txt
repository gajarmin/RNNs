[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo, I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
Putting thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet, known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow, hell no
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough
I'm known for yokin' Japs and beating em with smoking gats
Leaving token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit, step to the rear son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
Cause in a street brawl I strike men like lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight friend, aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes, I leave trails of dead mic's
Where I'm from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided
Crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts
For selling pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a tech stuck down your throat
I'm telling you shit is about to get drastic soon
I'm quick to blast a goon and break a mothafucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hotty stare
I keep a shotty near, it's that nigga with notty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks I'm known to roast until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most, I'm leaving niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smoking dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed and got a hot lead facelift
All through high school I had braids; I kept mad blades
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak, cause my technique's great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper, punk brother vamper
Fuck around, you'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a whyle town
You know my style clown, so bow down
Word up
'95 style... I got my man Jay-Z here

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Brothers can beg and borrow, still feel sorrow
When Jay, Z like Zorro, get in that ass, better luck tomorrow
I'm too much nigga, so never should you rush
You need slow down or get your ass tore down
Check it out, I'm too cocky to stop me
You gotta kill me and when I'm gone
You can still feel me, on the real, B
The shit is eternal, I rock the heavens well
Even if they won't let me in Heaven, I raise hell, till it's Heaven
Recognize, the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me nigga, it's bad luck to cross me
I'm popping Crystal, shooting game like missiles
As projected all ho's affected by this style
I mack like Goldie, go back like the oldie
But the goody
Pulling R&B bitches wearing hoodies
They don't be knowin the way I be flowing
When I be going, I be running the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme, the way that you do things with a swing
And have em rocking like, you say never you run, if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm
I produce like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom
For greater understanding I'm landing blows
And knocking sense into those that oppose me
Enticing when slicing through tracks
Your screaming, Jesus Christ he's back
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map so give him his dap
And me, I just take mine
Gimme those, gimme this, gimme that, fuck that
You never see me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible
Even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping, extortion and corruption
So you know, beating me will never come like a nun or tomorrow
I'm too thorough, nigga
I make moves, cause bowels to move
When I'm creeping through your way
With a thousand little dudes
Armed with a piece like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise, I feel no fear when facing y'all
Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's trying to be the best
And even in dying, couldn't be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesing
Ever since L said throw three g's in
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself, I get up

[Verse 3: Big L]
My crew be delivering hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I be killing the shit in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect to catch wreck in any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time, my parents haven't met yet
I'm feeling like Billy Bathgate, my rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probably got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Giuliani hung
Never had a gassed head, got loot cause I stash bread
Try to tax and I'mma beat your faggot ass half-dead
I stomp White cops till the life stops
For a low price hops, cause my blood is colder than an ice box
On 1-3-9 you don't want a block war
Cause my crew will kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time my MAC-11 bucks, I'm killing at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike, I'm rougher than a fist fight
All chicks ain't shit, ain't no such thing as Ms. Right
So we can never be a couple hun, fuck love
All I got for ho's is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown emcee's I be attacking quick
I'm on some rapping shit and some car jacking shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black Ac'
And put the gat to his cap, click-clack
Sorry Jack, but get up out of that
My .38 works great, so make a mistake and hesitate
I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didn't listen to what I was speaking
He started reaching, so I left him sleeping with his temple leaking
Aight, back to my man Jay-Z

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
As soon as I grab it, I eat it up like a savage
And no I don't have it; I get it together like a marriage
I'm seeking all rappers, I'm on my P's and Q's and carrots
Y'all don't understand, well
Goddamn don't you know my status
I'm flowing the fattest, mmmm that
Is, mmmm, I'm the baddest
No need to explain my name, the only thing that matters
For suckers who bite me, they find
I'm a bit much to swallow
Your thinking that's hollow, the
Rhythm is too r-rugged to follow
I hit you like bam, biggity bam, bam, biggity bam
Let me take a little breath...goddamn
The kid is a wizard
I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches
As soon as I step up, nah, whenever I'm in the, uh
Whatever I touch, whatever I clutch
You know I'm gonna end ya, uh
The nigga don't play, hey, the nigga don't play, hey
Hahahhhh, here I come a-g-g-gain, run, up up up in
Niggas are do ducking I'm boo buckin, fuck it I'm whyle
But a boo boo boo bam, what you
Niggas gonna do to the man
I see you brought your little crew... and?
I'm still comin with velocity, check it out
Jid-a, id-a, wid-I, zid-e, uh huh
Ain't none of the clowns fuckin around
Ain't none of clowns standing their ground
With the crowned prince of the underground
Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now
The heats on sweat now
Jay-Z's on, be gone to the next town
Punk, jump up and get beat down
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Ladies be comin out of their seats now
Shit I got crazy skills
It's a pity the way I'm ripping
Rugged rhythm through the city
Like dunnanna dunnanna di-di-dun dun ditty
I got rhythm, I, hit em with rhythm, I
Hit em and split em, I did em, I get rid of them guys
J-A, baby, baby please, gimme g's
Baby, baby, wit crazy ease
Watch Jay-Z get crazy G's
[Verse 1: Big L]
Aiyyo, you betta flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumping like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if the crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go BOOM BOOM, and yo' guns go pow-pow
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shottie smoking
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to getting nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy don't make it thirty-six
Step to this you're good as gone, word is bond
I leave mics torn when I put it on

[Hook: Kid Capri]
So put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn
C'mon put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it on represent put it on, C'MON!

[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothing from Big L but a loss chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast the shottie
Got more cash than Gotti, you don't know, you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Ha ha, you'se a funny nigga
I flows so one of my shows, wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leaving competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catching wreck to the break of dawn
And it's on, yo it's a must that I put it on

[Hook: Kid Capri]

[Bridge: Patois Chatta]
Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead, from a me you provoke

[Verse 3: Big L]
I drink Moet not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangster lean I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm putting rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
Cause I be hanging in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread, you can't kill me I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slamming, I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town, and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
Cause we put it on, adiós, ghost I'm gone
[Intro]
Yo, pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down

[Verse 1]
Check it, my weed smoke is my lye
A ki of coke is a pie
When I'm lifted, I'm high
With new clothes on, I'm fly
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
Money is chips, movies is flicks
Also, cribs is homes, jacks is pay phones
Cocaine is nose candy, cigarettes is bones
A radio is a box, a razor blade is a ox
Fat diamonds is rocks and jakes is cops
And if you got robbed, you got stuck
If you got shot, you got bucked
And if you got double-crossed, you got fucked
Your bankroll is your poke, a choke hold is a yoke
A kite is a note, a con is a okey doke
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff, a bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'mma never stop speaking it

[Hook]
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)

[Verse 2]
Yo yo, A burglary is a jook, a wolf's a crook
Mobb Deep already explained the meanin' of shook
If you caught a felony, you caught a F
If you got killed, you got left
If you got the dragon, you got bad breath
If you 730, that mean you crazy
Hit me on the hip means page me
Angel dust is sherm, if you got AIDS, you got the germ
If a chick gave you a disease, then you got burned
Max mean to relax, guns and pistols is gats
Condoms is hats, critters is cracks
The food you eat is your grub
A victim's a mark
A sweat box is a small club, a ticker's your heart
Your apartment is your pad
Your old man is your dad
The studio is the lab and heated is mad
I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'mma never stop speaking it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The iron horse is the train and champagne is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
If your girl is fine, she's a dime
A suit is a vine, jewelry is shine
If you in love, that mean you blind
Genuine is real, a face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard, long stare is a grill
If you sneaking to go see a girl, that mean you creeping
Smiling is cheesing, bleeding is leaking
Beggin' is bumming, if you nuttin you cummin
Taking orders is sonnin', an ounce of coke is a onion
A hotel's a telly, a cell phone's a celly
Jealous is jelly, your food box is your belly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
You took an L, you took a loss
To show off mean floss, uh
I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'mma never stop speaking it

[Hook]
Verse: 1
Fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expanding my chips
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowing is sharp
A while back I used to hustle, selling blow in the park
Counting g stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie hunting, trigger temper I'm quick to body something
You looking at me like I'm probably fronting
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hanging around y'all cause niggas like you
Be praying on my downfall, hoping I flop
Hoping I stop, you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe smoking the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more stitches than you
Fucking punk, you ain't a leader what, nobody followed you
You was never shit, your mother should have swallowed you
You on some tag-along flunky yes man shit
Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel Fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come you can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from?
So what you acting for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something, before I crack his jaw
You running with boys, I'm running with men
I'm a be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like "damn it this nigga done done it again"
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas

Verse: 2
Aight, let me kick some more shit, one more time
(Yeah-yeah… Spit, some more) - Bobbito
Aight, check it out, yeah, check it out
Yeah, check it out, yeah, check it out
Uhh, check it out, aight, check it out
Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo check it, yo my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you but with that cheap shit, you ain’t worth stickin'
I’ve got a left hook that be leaving guys knocked out
Keep fronting and I'ma choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that
Yo, I’m not in the mood son, so don’t push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight — gripping my dick like a pair of pliers
You fucking snitch; right now you prolly wearing wires
It’s not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
I’ma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smokin'
My album is done, so no there ain't no parts open
I’m not a sweet stud, I’m a street thug
That’s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain’t a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with fuck them too, I’ll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fuckin' chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo, I’m a take you out your misery
And after this, nigga, put you in the social study book cause you’re history
[Intro: Ron G - echoing at each break]
Yes indeed - it's the mix king - Ron G
I got somethin - the world - ain't ready for
New York City - L.A. - Chicago - Atlanta
D.C. - Detroit - New Orleans, y'all know the deal
FLAVA!!!!

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Hahahahahaha! Yeah nigga!
Yeah.. that's right.. BAYY-BAYY!
That's how we do it

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
See niggas is false, sittin in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin to be strong, they sendin armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
Bitches be warned - word is bond, you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do'
With fo'-fo's.. hahahahaha, yeah nigga!
Thug Life

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm hard, Jehovah said I'm barred from the pearly gates
Fuck him, I didn't wanna go to heaven anyway
But my momma had me on my knees with my hands gripped
Talkin' about some "Praise the Lord" shit
Hail Mary, fuck her
I never knew her
I'll probably probably screw her and dump her body in the sewer
Our father, my pops stuck up bed spots big, black, and mean
With the fifth by the caradeims
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
The lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question:
"How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake," Ron G, stop the tape

[Verse 3: Big L]
I be that young, pretty, fly, smooth, glorious kid
A Bad Boy, just like Notorious B.I.G
I Roc-a-Fella like Shawn Carter
With more game than Ron Harper
The bomb sparker rapper slash charm robber
While y'all be on the corners bummy and high
I be out buyin the finest shit money can buy
You wish you was in a position that I'm in
Hot rhymin', diamonds shinin', autograph signin'
My lifestyle is far out
Every week bring a different car out
I go to nightclubs and buy the bar out, UHH
Cause I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
Everytime I touch mics you hear all the freaks scream
Yeah yeah Big L Harlem's finest, yeah
That nigga who hold it down for Uptown

[Outro: 2Pac]
Hahahaha, that's how we do it out here
On this underground real shit nigga, it's the heat nigga
Now rewind this motherfucker, you know you can't help it
Deadly combination bwoy!
[Verse 1]
Aiyyo spark up the phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick money grip or your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight friend, aight then
L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah cause I got all of them sprung Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw them they come back
I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C
I'm down with Diggin In The Crates and I'm MVP

[Hook]
If rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
Yo if rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C

[Verse 2]
Yo it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance Jack to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like beaucoup, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And everytime I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses cause I'm buying Porsches
Coming straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri, I'm MVP

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Battles I lose none, I make crews run
I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper, punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your Mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my ___
I'm coming straight out the NYC
Rap's my J-O-B, and I'm MVP

[Hook]
[Intro: Malcolm X]
"Stealing runs rampant in Harlem
Gambling runs rampant in Harlem
All types of evils and uhh, vices that tear apart our community
Run rampant in Harlem"

[Verse 1: Big L]
The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
Sendin poems to have them faggots diggin hoes like Reverand Swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps til they head splits, then break em like bread sticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin Tecs, because I be stayin vexed
Some nigga named Dex, was in the projects layin threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin
I'm chokin enemies til they start turnin pale
Satan said I'm learnin well, Big L's gonna burn in hell
Front and get scarred cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a thievin' squad, and none of us believe in God

[Hook: McGruff/ Big L]
(McGruff:) Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone
(Big L:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own
(Big L:) Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone
(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own

[Verse 2: Big L]
I got styles you can't copy bitch, it's the triple six
In the mix, straight from H-E-double-hockey sticks
Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck Carlito, we doin' shit the Devil Son's way
Every minute, my style switches up, they said a real man
Won't hit a girl well I ain't real cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price, I'm the type
To snap in heaven with a Mac-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's mad stressed, cause hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit, strictly, little kids
Be wakin up cryin, yellin, "Mommy Big L is comin to get me!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big L]
I keep a cutie with a soft booty, hoes be runnin up
"Can I get your autograph L?" No bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge; just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Aiyyo crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed
So I suggest you spread pretzelhead
'fore I turn your white sweatsuit red

[Hook]
[Big L]
I walk through the ruggedest blocks
With jewels flooded with rocks
Hustlin' on hot corners that be smuggled with cops
I must warn, my Harlem crew roll strong
Word bond, we leave mics torn,y'all niggas slept too long now it's on
L Corleone'll never flop, rap style's forever hot
Front on me you better not, I keep the Baretta cocked
I got more papers than a New York Post
Packin' toast, this host is quick to roast a mic then I'm ghost
I'm not a soprano like that Italiano Sammy Gravano
MCs is gettin' knocked off like Paulie Castellano
This little menace be, guzzlin' Hennessy
Props from here to Tennessee, police wanna finish me
I run with cliques, pushin' luxury whips
Who be callin' chicks on Motorola flips, with illegal chips
Don't sleep troop, it's a fact I keep loot
Dime bitches be all over Big L like a cheap suit
The rap veteran, hot beats is the medicine
Niggas'll never win, in a battle, cause I'm better than
Ninety percent o' them, front and death'll be your minimum
The grave is where I'm sendin' 'em, clowns, like Mack 10 and 'em, uh!
I'm from the East Coast, this is how we roll in New York
A bunch of rowdy niggas holdin' the fort
Jackin' creeps, packin' heat
These Harlem streets is for keeps
Much love to all my peeps who got covered with sheets
And uh, where I be dwellin' at snitches get killed
On the real side, I probably fucked more bitches than Wilt, nigga
In clown hearts I put a lotta fear
One love to Fat Joe and 560 yeah, I'm outta here
Yo McGruff, yo my mellow, my man
Ayo uh, grab the mic and do the best ya can...
[Intro: 'The River Wild' sample]
"Where are you?" "Hey, there you are!"
"How does it feel to know you only have a few more seconds left to live?"
*gunshot*

("Big L" - Cut and scratched)

[Big L]
I stay jeweled up, pockets swelled up from banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep in a triple black dark tinted old jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put a Glock to his dome
Tell him, "Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split"
Grip, it ain't nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
Mad niggas be fronting a lot
Popping mad shit, tryna be something they not
Your faggot ass better stick to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing, that's right
In '97 Harlem kids is blowing
And we don't trick, we'll let a bitch starve till her ribs are showing

("Lord Finesse" - Cut and scratched)

[Lord Finesse]
Heated divine mastermind that turn nickels to dimes
The authentic genuine that's out to shine
The cool cat, the true mack, the smooth raps
Chickens be like, "Who that?" I be doing my thing, kid (True dat)
Forget fronting, I'm beyond that, I roll with brothers ready for combat
All for eye-to-eye contact
With skills, G, yo it's ill see, for real B
Ain't no barbecue, niggas better stop tryna grill me
Huh, sent that style to the essence
Got niggas stressing my style, pull like fluorescents
No question, tough type to clutch mics
The positive upright, I'm the "I don't give a fuck" type
Expose the facts, you know the haps
Could go to laugh astrological, like the signs in the Zodiac
Your rap crew out the stack loop, word up
My style's tighter than a fat bitch in a cat suit
Suprise G, it's not wise see to size me
When I operate, it's Smooth Sailing like Ron Isely
Gotta do my thing, word up (Beg ya pardon?)
Time to bounce, gotta skate like Tonya Harding

("A.G." - Cut and scratched)

[A.G.]
Yo I'm the cleverest top ten terrorist
Chickens ever diss they become featherless
Hate derelicts, certified gold medallist
You play fly cause I'm the most high like Everest
Look at all these fakes, musically you imitate the Crates
Won't succeed moving at full speed with no brakes
Like Jake, watch me take your entourage
Can't see me, I'm camoflauge and besides, I'm God
Mad hard like the S.A.T. who have shorties
Caught up in the mental, watch her bless A.G
Evidently you still don't know because you tempt me
Thought you was the boss when your fat thoughts were empty
Not Fat Joey Crack but still Jealous One's Envy
Who sent me? D.I.T.C., good and plenty
Like the doctor, smoke a Spike Joint and watch "Clockers"
Get rude like Shabba, make moves behind my blockers
Crazy sickness, you want the pure, you'd better pick this
Bitches can't get this, faggots remain dickless

("Fat Joe" - Cut and scratched)

[Fat Joe]
Before we get started, let's talk about these coward-hearted
MC's that claim to be true O.G.'s
And war specialists forever bust your guns on the sack of shit
But when the beef come, get on the ___ before I protest your licks
You know the deal, I come with nothing but the real
Certified pejente, recognize mi gente
Whether East Coast or West Coast, I'll make 'em all strip naked Bitch niggas will never get respected
Joey Green bagging devils up in Bowling Green for all is clean
Cock the 9 soon as I seen his Rolie gleam
You know the team, never giving a fuck
Laying thick in the cut, get your shit laced up
What the fuck!

("Diamond D" - Cut and scratched)

[Diamond]
Yo I'm flipping on niggas like treys of crack
My raps react on your cardiac like a heart attack
Some niggas front for stunts
Who want to take a puff of the blunt and play a nigga like a chump
But I don't play that shit with no chicks
Sucking the next nigga's dick, moving bricks
I'm too slick for you high school dropouts
You got knocked and tried to cop out
Couldn't fight when the kids pulled the mop out
And wails you out, writing home saying, "Bail me out"
Little small time, fucked up when you called mine
D Squared, one of the Greatest of All Times

[Outro: Diamond D]
Yeah, D.I.T.C. representing for the '97, word life
[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo, I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
Putting thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet, known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow, hell no
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough
I'm known for yokin' Japs and beating em with smoking gats
Leaving token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit, step to the rear son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
Cause in a street brawl I strike men like lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight friend, aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes, I leave trails of dead mic's
Where I'm from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided
Crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts
For selling pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a tech stuck down your throat
I'm telling you shit is about to get drastic soon
I'm quick to blast a goon and break a mothafucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hotty stare
I keep a shotty near, it's that nigga with notty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks I'm known to roast until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most, I'm leaving niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smoking dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed and got a hot lead facelift
All through high school I had braids; I kept mad blades
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak, cause my technique's great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper, punk brother vamper
Fuck around, you'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a whyle town
You know my style clown, so bow down
Word up
'95 style... I got my man Jay-Z here

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Brothers can beg and borrow, still feel sorrow
When Jay, Z like Zorro, get in that ass, better luck tomorrow
I'm too much nigga, so never should you rush
You need slow down or get your ass tore down
Check it out, I'm too cocky to stop me
You gotta kill me and when I'm gone
You can still feel me, on the real, B
The shit is eternal, I rock the heavens well
Even if they won't let me in Heaven, I raise hell, till it's Heaven
Recognize, the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me nigga, it's bad luck to cross me
I'm popping Crystal, shooting game like missiles
As projected all ho's affected by this style
I mack like Goldie, go back like the oldie
But the goody
Pulling R&B bitches wearing hoodies
They don't be knowin the way I be flowing
When I be going, I be running the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme, the way that you do things with a swing
And have em rocking like, you say never you run, if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm
I produce like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom
For greater understanding I'm landing blows
And knocking sense into those that oppose me
Enticing when slicing through tracks
Your screaming, Jesus Christ he's back
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map so give him his dap
And me, I just take mine
Gimme those, gimme this, gimme that, fuck that
You never see me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible
Even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping, extortion and corruption
So you know, beating me will never come like a nun or tomorrow
I'm too thorough, nigga
I make moves, cause bowels to move
When I'm creeping through your way
With a thousand little dudes
Armed with a piece like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise, I feel no fear when facing y'all
Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's trying to be the best
And even in dying, couldn't be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesing
Ever since L said throw three g's in
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself, I get up

[Verse 3: Big L]
My crew be delivering hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I be killing the shit in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect to catch wreck in any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time, my parents haven't met yet
I'm feeling like Billy Bathgate, my rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probably got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Giuliani hung
Never had a gassed head, got loot cause I stash bread
Try to tax and I'mma beat your faggot ass half-dead
I stomp White cops till the life stops
For a low price hops, cause my blood is colder than an ice box
On 1-3-9 you don't want a block war
Cause my crew will kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time my MAC-11 bucks, I'm killing at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike, I'm rougher than a fist fight
All chicks ain't shit, ain't no such thing as Ms. Right
So we can never be a couple hun, fuck love
All I got for ho's is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown emcee's I be attacking quick
I'm on some rapping shit and some car jacking shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black Ac'
And put the gat to his cap, click-clack
Sorry Jack, but get up out of that
My .38 works great, so make a mistake and hesitate
I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didn't listen to what I was speaking
He started reaching, so I left him sleeping with his temple leaking
Aight, back to my man Jay-Z

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
As soon as I grab it, I eat it up like a savage
And no I don't have it; I get it together like a marriage
I'm seeking all rappers, I'm on my P's and Q's and carrots
Y'all don't understand, well
Goddamn don't you know my status
I'm flowing the fattest, mmmm that
Is, mmmm, I'm the baddest
No need to explain my name, the only thing that matters
For suckers who bite me, they find
I'm a bit much to swallow
Your thinking that's hollow, the
Rhythm is too r-rugged to follow
I hit you like bam, biggity bam, bam, biggity bam
Let me take a little breath...goddamn
The kid is a wizard
I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches
As soon as I step up, nah, whenever I'm in the, uh
Whatever I touch, whatever I clutch
You know I'm gonna end ya, uh
The nigga don't play, hey, the nigga don't play, hey
Hahahhhh, here I come a-g-g-gain, run, up up up in
Niggas are do ducking I'm boo buckin, fuck it I'm whyle
But a boo boo boo bam, what you
Niggas gonna do to the man
I see you brought your little crew... and?
I'm still comin with velocity, check it out
Jid-a, id-a, wid-I, zid-e, uh huh
Ain't none of the clowns fuckin around
Ain't none of clowns standing their ground
With the crowned prince of the underground
Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now
The heats on sweat now
Jay-Z's on, be gone to the next town
Punk, jump up and get beat down
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Ladies be comin out of their seats now
Shit I got crazy skills
It's a pity the way I'm ripping
Rugged rhythm through the city
Like dunnanna dunnanna di-di-dun dun ditty
I got rhythm, I, hit em with rhythm, I
Hit em and split em, I did em, I get rid of them guys
J-A, baby, baby please, gimme g's
Baby, baby, wit crazy ease
Watch Jay-Z get crazy G's
Yo
My crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

[Verse 1: Big L]
Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

[Verse 2: Terra]
Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

[Verse 3: Herb McGruff]
For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

[Verse 4: Buddah Bless]
Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

[Verse 5: Big Twan]
Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

[Verse 6: Killa Kam - Cam'Ron]
Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

[Verse 7: Trooper J]
I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

[Verse 8: Mike Boogie]
I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

[Outro: Big L]
True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew
Word up
[Big L]
Ayyo folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin’ this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast when my Smith-Wes’ blast
So jus’ dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don’t get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smoke ‘cause these knuckles hurt
I’m from the alley not the valley
I’m hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I’d rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don’t hang with jive pals
Adiós, ghost, I’m five thous’

[Terra]
Flave it’s always easy for new bait
Taken here to groove quake
Make ya more addictin’ than tube steak
‘Cause when I work a line, nobody’s jerkin’ mine
So bring the noise an’ I’ll poison like turpentine
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass rubber, your rhymes left trash gutter
I’ll leave chumps done, don’t come with some junk son
‘Cause I’m makin’ flave niggas cool for consumption
I’m more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it’s too late for that lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow up
Sour luck, niggas got popped an’ swallowed nut

[Herb McGruff]
On the mic, I rip the scene right
Terra just caught wreck, so I guess I got the green light
Niggas know about Herb McGruff
I’m on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
MCs are live but I’m mad liver
Ayyo my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this an’ get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice an’ peas
(Herb can you fight?) Yo I’m nice with these
Put up your dukes, then me an’ you cook raw
‘Cause I stand tall an’ kick ass like a football
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I’m the fuck up outta here

[Buddah Bless]
Ayyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I’ma melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews ‘cause I'm bad news
In a mad move I'm servin’ brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this an’ get your body blown
‘Cause I'm a no maricón for poems and slidin’ hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Ayyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin’ melon got niggas gellin’
Ayyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

[Big Twan]
Yo I’m bustin’ chumps like a Glock ten, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill ya show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
No frail kids get nailed and read Braille when they fail
Yeah and I’m nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, ayyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that’s sawed off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rubbed out
For dissin’, you’ll come up missin’, like a cub scout

[Killa Kam]
Rappers be funny like flesh ‘cause they sections say they slaughter son
Talk about nines an’ tecs an’ never shot a water gun
But Killa Kam I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease ‘cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin’ at least
Twenty police deceased, it’s the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats an’ black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain’t no light looks, you fight crooks
Left an’ right hooks, if you front, get your life took

[Trooper J]
I'm havin’ nail sharp pains in my brain like a hell raiser
I'm blazin’ trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin’ but lead
Boom bye-bye then find another botty boy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call ‘em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein’ heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up to keep my head straight

[Mike Boogie]
I should never rhyme ‘cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
‘Cause they know when I start droppin poems
That I be knockin’ domes, poppin’ bones and sendin’ niggas hoppin’ home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this

No need to question am I nice, ‘cause it's a fact friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a mac ten
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm ‘bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin’ it tough
Peace to Big L, ayyo, eight is enough
[Big L]
Ayyo, I got the gift of gab
To lift and grab, the mic
And recite hype rhymes
That'll rip and rag, and drag
A fag MC, who likes to nag a lot
And brag a lot, talkin' about the lyrics that he have are hot
Step to this and get lit like a candle troop
Rhymes I hook up, MCs I cook up
Like Campbell's Soup
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you'll get bust and dust and crushed
Bum rushed and all of that
Rhymes never sound whack
Cause I got 'em down pat
Your rulin' time is over
So gimme your crown jack
I get hype fast
And MCs might last
A minute with me
Because their rhymes are light as
A feather
And mines are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick
When I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
MCs that tried to get wit' me hops
That's why they all got tooken out like a Bensi box
The crown is still mine cause I kick ill rhymes
A lotta rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I'm smoother than Vaseline
And I'm a stone cold rappin' fiend
A lot of new jacks are comin' out, but that's cool
Cause I'm the principal of the new school

[Big L]
Yeah, aight, check it out
I control the microphone like a robot
My lyrics are so hot, props I got a whole lot
Cause wit' a pen and some paper this man makes
Rhymes that're so damn great, with flavor like pancakes
I'm kickin' rhymes like a game of kickball
I'm rough like a brick wall, MCs take a big fall
For tryin' to get with this, I'm too swift with this
A microphone murderer full with magnificence
A def rapper and also a swell one
In a battle I cook MCs well done
My hits are consecutive
I'm a lyrical executive
Bite my rhymes and I won't let you live
So to be safe on the microphone homes
Recite your own poems or get your dome flown
Or put in a boot camp, L is the new champ
I'm not the type to go out like a food stamp
I'm throwin' rhymes like a pitcher throws a curve ball
And I'm a serve all punks that try to brawl
So stop sleepin' on me, don't even doze hops
Or I'm a heat you up and eat you up like Stove Top
Stuffin', I'm bum rushin', shorts I'm takin' none
My rhymes weigh a ton, I'm not fakin' son
You're the one who's fakin', tryin' to be a duplicate
Can't kick stupid shit, tell you the truth, you should quit
Rappin', start snappin', cause all you is a joke
Battle L and get smoked
Yo I overthrow ya and have ya screamin' like a rollercoaster
Guzzle you down like a small cup o' Coca-Cola
I'm goin' through MCs like a ransack
Stand back, as I cruise smooth like a Am-Trak
Your rhymes are rusty g, you can't fuck with me
That's why you're hidin' in protective custody
L's not the one and I keep MCs runnin'
I hurt 'em like bunions, make 'em cry like onions
I'm a lyrical fighter and I'm brighter than Einstein
Try to bite my lines and you'll get a size nine
Foot put in your ass for bein' a crook
Hit with a vital hook and get your title took

Yeah, I'm a pass it to my man

[Lord Finesse]
Now check it out, I'm a get paid for the nineteen nineties
I don't care who likes me or who stands behind me
The man to peep, far from weak so don't sleep
From stage to streets I still go one deep
So save that off the wall bullshit, ya get had son
Fuck around, grab the mic and catch a bad one
I come correct and strapped to bust a ill rap
Me take a loss to who? Ya oughta kill that
Back up, slack up, give a brother some head room
Hype on the mic, amazin' in the bedroom
Girls like me cause I'm straight and don't sidestep
I do shit Jack LaLanne ain't tried yet
Ask any female, bet you she'll say I'm good
That's why I'm Finesse, porn star of the neighborhood
Yeah, cause I kick slicker raps
It's Lord Finesse, so bow and tip your hat
And make way cause I get plenty say
And those who don't like me I don't give a shit anyway
Cause when it comes to lyrics I always find somethin'
That make brothers press the rewind button
I'm a get mine, tell me what you're gonna do?
Cause ya couldn't see me if ya wanted to
Get who you want, shit you could call the cops
But for now, I'm gettin' all my props
I reign terror, whatever's clever
I'm cooler than The Mack and Shaft put together
So chill, don't try to get ill dummy
Me get stomped by who? Be for real, money
I'm not havin' it so go on and get your best group
You'll see why they call me Lord Finesse, troop
I eat 'em like sandwiches, send 'em home in bandages
Gimme that mic, I'll show you what doin' damage is
Nice, swift and deeper than quicksand
I'm takin' out opponents like a hit man
I get the crowd hype like a sorta drug
It's Lord Finesse, who the fuck you thought it was?
I lounge and chill but still could get ill
I'm live and real with skill beyond skill
Pull girls like a lasso, keep the crazy cash flow
A nigga beat me on the mic? Don't be an asshole
I'm indestructible so bring in a substitute
What's up with a battle? Yo I can't fuck with you

[Lord Finesse]
I'm intellectual, gettin' the best of you
I eat MCs like the food at a festival
Drop science and math; stand tall like a giraffe
Completin' the…task, breakin' rappers in half
Puttin' suckers out of it, yeah I talk a lot of shit
But when it comes to rhymes I deserve a fuckin' scholarship
Won't front or perp the role, I get the most of hoes
I'm so cool, I've got pussy on remote control
Whether you're a virgin or a bad lookin' hot sister
I'm baggin' up bitches like a shoplifter
So Lord Finesse is not the one to fool
I was gettin' sex since they first invented Underoos
So set it off, no time to rehearse the rappin'
It's Lord Finesse, so prepare for the worst to happen
Mics get ripped up, good times get tucked
Throw your hands in the air, suckers keep your lips shut
Cause ya'll wanna waste time sayin' them fake rhymes
Gimme my respect and props or I'm a take mine
Cause I ain't nothin' to play with
And fuckin' with me ya need more than a first aid kit
So it's better that ya chill and max with me
I'm sendin' out warnin's quicker than a fax machine
I get funky and kick it so let's get wit' it
Opponents who think they can hang, y'all can forget it
I sit and write rhymes, makin' up hype lines
Achievin' shit you couldn't do in a lifetime
So don't care me and compare me to those other brothers
I'm Lord Finesse and I'm one bad ass muthafucker
I'm doin' MCs as ya hire 'em
Bustin' they ass and make 'em sign up for retirement
Without doubt I'm a brother with all the clout
Whoever said I'm whack, what the fuck is they talkin' about?
Yeah, you don't stop, so L, my man my brother
Tear shit up you bad muthafucker

[Big L]
Yo I'm the microphone murderer
And I'm known for bustin' mad caps
I was in rag tracks with rhymes that backslap
'Causin' a nightmare, I don't fight fair
Niggas playin' hard rock, hopin' they might scare
The B-I-G-L but I'm not to be fucked wit'
You're tryin' to take your idol's title?
You on some bugged shit
I keep the women fiendin' and screamin' for my smooth shit
My rhymes are mad thick and yours is thin as a pool stick
Fuck it, bust it, I like it rough and rugged
Your style is wick whack and played out like nugget
Bracelets, face this, you can't erase this, escape this
Break this, take this, cause I bake this
I get so loose on beats that I produce
Niggas be frontin' crazy hard and got no juice
They softer than paper plates, the lyrics I make is great
A few sheets of loose leaf and a Erasermate
Is all I need to write rhymes that are extra fly
Mics I wreck and fry, rappers I petrify
Pack a fo' fif' with eight shots
With one you get popped
And now you're locked in a box, dead, with no props
I'm not jokin', there's no time for snappin'
Niggas that be yappin', I'm puttin' caps in
So base up or get sprayed up to the waist up
You'll get found faced up, police can't trace up
Fingerprints, why? Because I leave no evidence
Big L's the name, one three nine is the residence, peace
[Big L]
Word, check it out check it out check it out
Bust it
MCs get taught a lesson
When the mic is in my possession
Rap's my profession. L is nice, no question
It's a fact I stay geared. It shouldn't be weird
That I'm feared cause my raps are rougher than a nappy beard
I cook rappers like a chef
I'm Def like Jef right to left
My raps are badder than morning breath
With niggas deaths I'm the number one suspect
Cause I catch much wreck, 'specially when I'm upset
Suckers I'm a stiggedystar breaking them up and then taking they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be ripping the microphones apart
I hold the forty right because I'm the naughty type
When I strike the mic, niggas be like shorty hype
I'm smoother than Velvet, my lyrics is well writ'
You saying L's this and L's that get off L's dick
Rhymes I create a knock out ya gold tooth
Battling me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I wreck mics and drop the cool speeches
Nowadays rappers think they motherfuckin' schoolteachers
One two, one two, rappers I run through
Fuck Karate, I practice Gun-Fu
The Big L is an assassinator
I grab the Mag and leave a fag leakin' like activator
I'm the nigga that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican
I'm gonna slaughter each and...
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up, give me two thumbs up
Peace
Now when it comes to this rap shit you know the Big L’s top ranked
And those niggas who fronted, they got spanked
Microphones I clutch and slay, foes I buck and spray
Me sell out? Psshh, no fuckin’ way
I kick flavor ‘til the track dies, stickin’ hoes with fat thighs
I’m known for givin’ whack guys black eyes
I fight my own wars; I’m known to bone whores
And my raps be goin’ long distance like phone calls
You got a big crew but I roll with larger men
I’m smoother than margarine
And I’m hittin’ harder then
That nigga named Mike Tys
I’m quite nice
I might slice
A punk for the right price
Then eat ‘em with white rice
The Big L is known for rockin’ jewels
Droppin’ fools and stoppin’ crews by poppin’ tools
I’m crazy quick to buck a gun
And get a sucka done
Yo I’m so smooth I could fuck a nun
MCs be actin’ like they top gunnin’
Yo talkin’ like villains but won’t pop nothin’ so stop frontin’
Before I pop you like a fat rope
I’m that dope
I’m mad far from flat broke
Front and I’ll let my gat smoke
Big L is a nigga you can’t call whack
Front and get your jaw cracked
My format is raw black, I’m all that
Fatter than horseflies
Known to exhort guys
This ain’t Cali, this Harlem nigga, we do walk bys
And it’s a fact I pack a joint or two
And right now you hearin’ shit from the Big L’s point of view
I’m not the type to take sluts out
I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out and break the fuck out
Me bein’ a virgin, that’s idiotic
‘Cause if Big L got the AIDS every cutie in the city got it
I’m a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don’t even speak English
[Big L]
You better flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L be keepin’ niggas hearts pumpin’ like Reeboks
It's the nigga that bitches suck and sweat
Faggots I buck and wet
Disrespect and I'm a break your fuckin’ neck
I'm known to put a cap in a duck face
I spray guns, fuck mace
I'm a nutcase from a rough place
It's called Uptown
Front and get bucked down
Walk through with jewels on, that ass'll get stuck clown
I got styles you can't copy, bitch
It's the triple six in the mix
Straight from H-E double hockey sticks
I'm the devil's son, like my song said
I smash niggas like cornbread
You can't kill me, I was born dead
I wet shit up like a floodage
Me and my crew peel caps and carry gats like it's luggage
I'm nowhere near trash, so step to the rear fast
Before I have your queer ass cryin’ like tear gas
Every day I gain clout and my game sprout
Some niggas'll still be virgins if crack never came out
The Big L's hard to kill, when my squad gets ill
You better guard your grill, before you get scarred for real
Big L is a large boss
Known for puttin’ more holes in a nigga body than a golf course
I'm crazy quick to knock a duck off
I'll pull out then buck off
And tear a nigga grill right the fuck off
You'll get smoked like a Phillie fast
‘cause your shit is really trash
Fuck around, I’ll swing on ya silly ass
It's Big L the crime converter
Sayin’ peace to all the niggas in jail doin’ time for murder
I wreck the mic, plus the whole stage
Rockin’ cornrow braids
I'm killin’ muthafuckers like old age
Known to have a hottie open
I keep a shotty smokin’
Front and get half the bones in ya body broken
I never false teach, so listen as the boss preach
I only rock leathers by Marc Buchanan and North Beach
I'm makin’ rap hits, I snap flicks at mack chicks
Just the slim ones, you won't see L with no fat bitch
Yo I'm the nigga that they call A.W.O.L
Punks, I slay all, on my spare time I play ball
In the playgrounds, I spray clowns with trey pounds
Makin’ gs from transportin’ kis on Greyhounds
My shit is kickin’ like a sensei
I'm smoother than Ben Gay
Comprende?
I'm outtie like M.J
So Herb McGruff
My mellow, my nigga
Get on the mic and pull the MC trigger
[Big L]
Ayo, spark up the Phillies my man and pass that Moet
Big L representin' with the Presidential Rolly
Y'all brothas know me, I step in parties with minks and fly links
Givin' all the ladies eye winks as I buy drinks
As soon as I pick up a mic and start flowin' the people yell
I'm rugged as hell, brothas could tell, that none of ya rappers are rougher than L
My rappin' skills was a great gift
The other night some snake rift and got a hot lead face lift
All through high school I had braids, kept mad blades
Stabbin' teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beefsteak
Cause my technique's great /
And I'm the brotha police hate in each state

Yeah, that's a little somethin'. Now I'm a drop one mo' for my man T cause he up in here. Check it out, check it out yeah and ya don't stop, Big L represents, check it out

Yo, I walk around with six thou', sippin' on Cris-tal
My whole clique's foul
I'm rich pal, no more sticks, I'm makin' hits now
The type o' brother that be gamin' yo' freaks
While you out workin' hard, I'm puttin' stains in yo' sheets
And clown hearts, ya put a lot of fear
L is the brotha you better not even try to scare
Cause some hot lead will get you outta here
While I'm rockin' tours you moppin' floors /
And I always deal with kis and not the kind that be lockin' doors
On one three nine and Lenox brothers are bananas
We got bad manners, cops can't stand us, that's why they try to jam us
But I hate jakes, they mad cause I make papes
I'm larger than the Great Lakes with drug spots in eight states
Used to be Little, now I'm double X
Pushin' a bubble Lex', I got connects with foreigners who smuggle tecs
I'm chillin', makin' sure this money is right
Sippin' Sunny Delight, hittin' every honey in sight
I'm the man with all the cream and clout
Cash I'm never seen without, make the ladies scream and shout
Big L is the brotha you dream about
And every girl I got looks like a model
If you ever see me with a chickenhead, she must a hit the lotto
And Uptown is where L rest, I stay well dressed
I write rhymes more than Jamaican niggas sell ses'

Aight, little somethin', little somethin'. I can't hang with my man but I still represented. You know. Yeah, word up
[Herb McGruff]
I drop hot rhymes
Take it hot '97slot time
I shine like a icon
Hund' Thirty-Ninth, don
V12 600 gas put my Nike on
Put a mic on
Put it piped on
Strong armed like 'Nam
Desert storm never fight calm
Four-fifths shook my right arm
Pearl white palm
Murder your life on
Make more noise than a night storm
Heavy artillery, hand grenades, and pipe bombs
Like Tron
Man there's no telling who I might harm
Time Wall Street business men in their white pawn
It's like on
Bullet holes buck fifty life longs
Fight strong, Don Juan, ill trife con
Write hype shit, my gang can make a dyke like dick
And my crew bigger than your crew twice as thick
Niggas be lookin' for some ice to stick
Nice and slick
And pipe the dick
And all the bad righteous chicks
My niggas locked up, we light them flicks
Send you commissary all types of kicks
My man L got 25 to life taught me life's a bitch
Said hold your head 'Gruff son and write them hits

[Big L]
Ya'll niggas like to stress them hoes
Impress them hoes
And spend money to dress them hoes
I sex them hoes and send them home
Corleone is known to be stoned
When I bone I'm rubbered-up 'case the bitch full blown
The other night around 8PM
Pockets crazy slim
Jumped out the grey B.M
Went to the ATM
Took a thou' out
Later on had to wil' out
In the club knocked some nigga and his pal out
Afterwards went to the restroom and pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin' what bitch number I can dial out
Cause it's L, the Harlem pimp baby, for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady, that's ill
Playa hatas be givin me harsh looks
But I'm trying to sell records like Garth Brooks
So fuck 'em all
When it's cold I throw the skully on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
Mega ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't Cristal bitch I guess it's Pérignon
If the pussy hole to tight I throw some jelly on
Try to tax, watch the 9 mil' burst
I've been off the scene over two years and niggas is still thirst
To hear Big L drop an ill verse
All you unsigned niggas that wanna battle, get a deal first
I sport the bullet-proof fitted hat
That attitude you better get rid of that
Where ever you floss is where you gonna get it at
I stay strapped, I go to sleep with my steel
Makin' figgas while you broke niggas keepin' it real
L is rap most livest cat
I'm getting stacks while you askin' niggas - "Do you want fries with that?"
I rob fags in the stair case
No mask, bare face
The one police wouldn't dare chase
Keep my gear laced
Do I walk around without papes?
No way pal
Word up, my money longer than the O.J. Trial

[Herb McGruff]
Yo, I rhyme with my heart and my soul
Shine like a carton of gold
Got M.C.'s startin' to fold
Leave 'em cold
Better play their part and their role
Leave 'em shook like a hustler with knocks on the stroll
What you know about slangin' in the park in the cold
Puffin buddha with your buddies
Gooses and the skullies
Rockin' Tim' boots and all the honeys
And when it's sunny
We sport linen spending money
Of course we some men who hungry
Society forced us to attend to ugly
And scorin' like Bugsy
I rather die than keep the feds cumfy
I read Nicky Barnes yeah plus I read Bumpy
Harlem World's where I'm from see
Picture 'Gruff comin' clumsy
I'm from the home of the money maker bum is junkie
DJ Clue pull up something funky
I'm kinda of tired off this weed and this Brass Monkey

[Big L]
Uh
Ears studded out
Playa hatas cut it out
Chain flooded out
Sexin' hoes tell I'm nutted out
You on the mixtape, talkin 'bout you flip weight
You fishcake holdin' your dick and still couldn't piss straight
I got heavy dough
And that's something that you already know
Clue heard me once and said "I bet he blow"
I rock the Presi' Rol'
You want beef let me know
I be in Mexico chillin' with a sexy ho
How cool can one MC be?
Ya'll still envy me cause I'm M.V.P
Cruise through Harlem in a bullet-proof MPV
Man, you fuck around and get plugged like MTV
I'm a pretty pimp with mad gear
I put my hoes on the moon if there was cash there
You feel me?
I buy hot jewels and ice it down
While you go to the jewelry store with short dough trying to bring the prices down
We gonn' build like construction
Real hot production
No playa hatin'
Just congratulatin'
Open your eyes
It's no surprise
Word up
Harlem World is on the rise
My phone number's anonymous
I get stacks and chickenheads can't get a dime of this
Front on me you must go
I just flow
Puff 'dro
It's all about the gusto
L lust dough
All you playa hatas stand up
Ya'll just blow
I stay freakin' off with a handcuffed ho
If niggas wanna know
Do L rock raw?
Do a pimp got whores?
Do Big L got balls?
I'm in charge of all
I just threw a party at the Taj Mahal
Cause The Mirage was small
Split heads like the Red Sea
Peep the Craig G
Chicks be on me like the feds be
And I never pay to sex, B
You can handle L? Let's see
I'm a bust in your mouth, fill up your grill like Gillespie
This chick Desti
Looks sexy in the Lex-y
Half black, half Mexi'
Complexion Nestle
Thighs gigantic
Big enough to make a guy panic
A few drinks and she go down like the Titanic
Aight?
[Big L]
Check it out
It be Big L, I get hyper
I be the fresh rhyme writer
Peace to my man, DJ Schneider
And I got to say what's up to Mike, he Funky Fresh
Big L, quick to lay a punk to rest
I'm going off the top of the head, so if I fuck up, so what?
Big L, I'll put a hole in you the size of a donut
I go nut, on a ball court
Play all sports
It's Big L, I live swell
Rhyme well
Check it out, I roll with D.I.T.C
You can believe me
Chilling with the crew, it ain't easy
I'm in Germany
I'm quick to earn a G
It ain't a rapper alive that's burning me
I'm fucking up but I want you to keep it
I don't do this shit often
Put crab MCs in the coffin
I'm rhyming off this, ill shit that I'm rhyming to
It's the Big L and um, I've been dying to
Freestyle, off the top of the head
Put the Glock to your head
Squeeze off, pop-pop-pop and you're dead
I'm in Germany, kicking this shit right here
Check it out, I be the best, I swear
It's B-I, G-L, know I live swell
Ah, Casey, come in, fuck yo
Verse: 1
Fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expanding my chips
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowing is sharp
A while back I used to hustle, selling blow in the park
Counting g stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie hunting, trigger temper I'm quick to body something
You looking at me like I'm probably fronting
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hanging around y'all cause niggas like you
Be praying on my downfall, hoping I flop
Hoping I stop, you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe smoking the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more stitches than you
Fucking punk, you ain't a leader what, nobody followed you
You was never shit, your mother should have swallowed you
You on some tag-along flunky yes man shit
Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel Fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come you can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from?
So what you acting for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something, before I crack his jaw
You running with boys, I'm running with men
I'm a be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like "damn it this nigga done done it again"
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas

Verse: 2
Aight, let me kick some more shit, one more time
(Yeah-yeah… Spit, some more) - Bobbito
Aight, check it out, yeah, check it out
Yeah, check it out, yeah, check it out
Uhh, check it out, aight, check it out
Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo check it, yo my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you but with that cheap shit, you ain’t worth stickin'
I’ve got a left hook that be leaving guys knocked out
Keep fronting and I'ma choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that
Yo, I’m not in the mood son, so don’t push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight — gripping my dick like a pair of pliers
You fucking snitch; right now you prolly wearing wires
It’s not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
I’ma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smokin'
My album is done, so no there ain't no parts open
I’m not a sweet stud, I’m a street thug
That’s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain’t a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with fuck them too, I’ll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fuckin' chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo, I’m a take you out your misery
And after this, nigga, put you in the social study book cause you’re history
[Big L]
I'm straight loco, to hell with you and your broke ho
You ain't a big dog, you more like Toto, you got no dough
I smoke dro mixed with cocoa, strong as Bolo
I pack a fo'-fo', platinum Ro'-Ro'
Anti-homo, that's a no-no so fuck po'-po'
I push the seven-fo'-oh and not the Volvo
C-Town push the six-oh-oh, I'm with a bitch on dolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While y'all buck for legs I, buck for heads
I even buck celebs, nigga fuck the feds
[Big L]
Aiyyo; I heard your single, you better make a whole new song
If they said that shit is hot then they told you wrong
Clown niggas, you ain't got a chance at all
Big L Corleone too advanced for y'all
I make moves and boss all across the world
So don't be upset if I toss your girl
I got cheddar to blow, pockets never get low
Bitches sweat me wherever I go
I cruise in a GS Lex', Cartier specs
Nautica sweats with the fresh Gortex
Jewels with baguettes, swingin like the Mets
Throwin the dice and takin all size bets
Never bummy; sip rummy, get money
When I hit honies you felt the dick in her tummy
On the le-low I see dough from here to Rio
Flamboyant Records, C to the E-O - what?
[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo once again it's the Big L, that kid who got much props
From killin corrupt cops, with motherfuckin buck shots
So don't step to this, cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big but they make coffins yo' size too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Cali, it's Harlem nigga we do walkbys
No one can match me, tax me or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps G just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me being a virgin, that's idiotic
Cause if Big L got the AIDS every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
And I put more holes in his ass than swiss cheese

[Hook]
(Thugs better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'mma have your family dressed in all black

[Verse 2: Big L]
I steal lives like a stone thief, so leave me alone chief
Or catch a buck shot to your domepiece
I must warn, I got it goin on, word is bond
Ducks be gettin thrown off platforms like P.M. Dawn
I'm catchin bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers, not just on niggas but hoes too
So don't try to test me, cause I can't stand test-es
Fuck around, I'll introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears, pal
But man you've been rappin for years now
And ain't made a hit yet, you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews, I come out of wars barely bruised
I'm puttin motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the git-go
Leavin fags in bodybags with tags on they big toe

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big L]
Yo ever since I was young, I ripped mics and I killed beats
And I'm known to milk freaks and hit em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name, I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS, then I'mma start rapin bitches
I'm all about makin papes kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past, stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty G's is what the creep stole; so the next day
Knocked on his door and shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Got it goin on, from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style I'm wild, comin straight out of Harlem pal
It's Big L, the motherfucking problem child

[Hook]

[Outro: Big L]
This goes out to all y'all bitch-ass niggas
So if your mother ain't ready for a funeral, don't FUCK with me
Cause I know a good way to get your family together
And I ain't talkin bout a reunion motherfucker
Yo, I'm bout to sign out, but before I go
I gotta say peace to the NFL crew, you know who you are
And all y'all niggas talkin that gun shit
And won't bust a rhyme, stop fakin the funk!
Word, I'm bout to get up out of here
Yo I'm out B, yo peace man
I gotta get this money
So all y'all niggas on my hitlist get your suits ready
Hahahaha!
[Fat Joe]
Welcome to the world of Joe, flooded with thugs and hoes
Real niggas, drug dealers, with villas in the Strolls
Lexus and Rolls parked in twenty-car garages
Living the largest, with Oriental massages in garbage
Shit, I get down for mine
Terror Squad run things in any town you can find
New York, New York, big city of dreams
Where there's nothing but foreign cars, bitches, and triple beams
I fiend for cash, fat pieces of ass
Never giving a fuck, get your shit laced up
The corrupt crutas wake me up to new crimes
On news prime: gangster rapper goes nuts and wounds nine
Joey Crack's the rock, known for packing Macs and Glocks
Stay away from Little Puppet cause his ass is hot
Shot, in the middle of the street
Pretty boys don't sleep cause beauty is only skin deep

[Lord Finesse]
While you playing games, we claimin fame slaying dames
The aim is to make Mo' Money like Damon Wayans
You know our names, we don't play jokes
Niggas ain't feeling us? You ain't supposed to, that's for gay folks
You stay broke, we stay holding and stay rolling
Rap's Beethoven, exploding, my game's golden
Pockets swollen, we make the freaks stare
Roll with some chocolate grimey niggas, but ain't nothing sweet here
Keep clear, ah yeah so get stepping
Make hit records off of loops that's six seconds
No question the cash tipper, the ass whipper
Need a chick that can hang, fuck you broads that wear glass slippers
Bigger, city slicker, you cats follow me?
Finesse is among the stars like astrology
Greater knowledge, G, shit's wild, I flip styles
On the mile, let me pass it off like Chris Childs

[Fat Joe]
Yo it's all love, thug niggas and all of the above
Drug dealers, killer, niggas at the Player's Club
Young ladies, sisters, rump shaking bitches
Niggas on the Island rock 150 stitches (Repeat 2x)

[Big L]
Yo my cash flow don't get low, it just increase
And whoever tries to take mine will rest in peace
Keep a stone look, peace to every known crook
Not those who go to jail and can't hold they own and come home shook
So hold on and prepare to get rolled on
My crew robs every fag that walks through with gold
Cats who act rah rah will catch a jim star scar
Punks who fake the funk don't get far, pah
Me and my clan parlay sipping Grand Marnier
At a party at the bar is where we stand all day
In '97 I'm bubbling, no more stuggling
If I fall, it's back to selling drugs again and busting slugs in men
No doubt, you know what I'm about
The last slouch that walked through my block didn't make it out
Because I stuck that nigga, then I bucked that nigga
(I felt sorry for that kid) I didn't fuck that nigga

[A.G.]
We be the bomb, baby, indeed I smoke weed
Been ripping shit since the late 80's, so what you need?
Not scared to fall, that's why I rise and stand tall
And send y'all back to the wall like I'm Darryl Straw
The truth is, don't give a damn if you're ruthless
Make it happen, I look at platinum niggas like "Who's this?"
Woe the the bloody city, Babylon will
Die in its inequities, project overkill
See me in the future shining, gold with diamonds
A nigga been used to climbing, my whole life
That's a trademark, if it ain't rough, it ain't right
We bring the heat, all you do is bark, we bite
I'm authentic, and once I send it, it's unretrievable
Like nuclear missles, cause meant it, now it's time to lace this
Resort to the basics
Niggas get rushed just because, hush and don't say shit
[Verse 1 - McGruff]
Crooked corrupted criminal crime boss with cream
Cocaine hustler, blowing out the brains of busters
Be in my mansion chillin', inhalin' the ganja smoke
Counting mad cream, weighin' tons of coke
Guarded by thugs and Rottweilers
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Niggas get plugged when my Glock hollers
Skunk smokers, Philly and Owl ripper
Cristal sipper, I've been a willy for a while nigga
'Gruff got hoes, the man with all the nachos
Expensive hot clothes, drop top Rolls
East coast, West coast, fiends overdose
'Gruff get the cream with my team and I'm ghost

[Verse 2 - Ma$e]
This money be temptin' me, to jump out the MPV
Empty three clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since 14, I sold morphine for more green
Kept open a Nautica coat under the drawsting
And watched out for cops, squad cars, and Beemers
And laundry ninas, flee the country to Argentina
Laid back in the beach (yeah) coastin' with commuters
Smokin' the buddahs on the cruiseline boat to Aruba
For a while, yo; pump the vowel so I can pile dough
Then become a Harlem kingpin just like Alpo'
Get paid so I can lay low in San Diego
With yayo so I can ship it out whenever I say so

[Hook]
Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast, you know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown, Downtown; you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We ain't splittin' this cream

[Verse 3 - Cam'ron]
Yo! I'mma run hystrically, till they bury me
Count numerically,hills of Beverly
More grands than cherokee; president like Eric B., and Rakim
Drug game, I'm top ten; locked in? Right now its not an option
And those who creep got the Mac in the heat
They got the five-inch screens in the back of the seat
And now they got this daddy raggin'
Last year, had me saggin', wasn't ready
When Heavy was back, tossed me in the paddywagon
But ain't nobody out here stoppin' love
Cause we was twelve years old in the Cotton Club, poppin' bub'
So all the fame without the fortune; goddamn, you wrong
Killa kid Cam-e-ron surviving in the Amazon

[Verse 4 - BloodShed]
Yo! I leave you dazed and froze
With all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded I counted
While bathing with Asian hoes
Back home niggas is after me
I'm back to sea, sippin' daquiris
Coke factory, fiends baggin' up crack for me
From cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
Nautica yachts, and knots busting outta my socks
Now that Bloods play the chub
All the ladies love me, they hate who made me hubby
Behind my back they say my baby's ugly
Each night I sleep, with freaks with Lamborghini jeeps
Neighbors be sneaking peeks, how my semen leaks, between the sheets
Mess up my loot, I cut your collars, Juan
Cause these is modern times, and the only thing I see is dollar signs

[Hook]

[Verse 5 - Big L]
Check it! To be seen clean in the mean Beam
Is every team's dream; Big L's a cream fiend
With more green than Springsteen
You know I'm crazy quick to smack a groupie
I'm known to mack a hoochie
Do I got stacks of lucci (Absolutely!)
Harlem kids is known for felonies
And sellin' keys, pushin 300Z's
GS3's, and puffin' trees
These G's breeze while DTs
Be yellin, 'freeze!', we stash cheese
And keep a pocket full of centuries
Ayo, I'm set for the rest of my life
Some clown that laid the threat cause I had sex with his wife
I stuck my tool to his brain, so that fool can get slain
Nigga, yo' bitch chose me, you know the rules to the game

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yea What? Harlem on the Rise

[Mase]
This money be, temptin' me, to jump out the MPV
Empty three clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since fourteen I sold Morphine for more green
Kept dope in the Nautica coat, under the drawstring
And watched out for cops, squad cars and Beamers
And larger ninas, flee the country to Argentina
Lay back on the beach, yeah, coastin' with commuters
Smokin' the buddhaz on the cruise line boat to Aruba
For a while yo, pumped the vile so, I compiled dough
Then become a Harlem kingpin just like Alpo
Get paid so I can lay low in San Diego
With yayo and ship it out whenever I say so

[Hook]
Yo, makin' that money's the American Dream
East coast to West coast, You know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown or Downtown, You pick the scene
You got to get your own scheme, we ain't splittin' this green

[Cam'ron]
And in Florida, its Cam's Orlando
Lyric soprano, Me and my Cuban connection Fernando
Sellin' bags of camo, streets be ran with ammo
See me late night, take flight
Dropping though these eight flights
Hold my blade tight, forced to do wrong to make right
Now they got this daddy braggin'
But last year had me saggin'
Wasn't ready when Teddy was baggin'
Tossed me in the paddy wagon
And life's an obstacle, often I just stop and pull
Brothas like to act, that's why I make sure that the Glock is full
Reporters shootin' photos of Killa shootin' the Glock, I'm loco
Drinkin' vodka dolo, sellin' yayo in Acapulco
So all the fame without the fortune, goddamn you wrong
Killa Cam Cameron, survivin' in the Amazon

[Bloodshed]
Yo, I leave you dazed and froze
With all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded, I count it, while bathin' with Asian hoes
Back home niggas is after me
I'm past the sea sippin' Daiquiris
Coke factories, fiends baggin' up crack for me
From cuttin' up rocks to investin' in stocks
Nautical yachts and knots bustin' out of my socks
Now that Blood's paid in chubby
All the ladies love me
They aim to make me hubby
Behind my back they say "My baby's ugly"
Each night I sleep with freaks with Lamborghini Jeeps
Neighbors be sneekin' peeks
Of how my semen leaks between the sheets
Mess up my loot, I'll cut ya collar swan
Cause these is modern times
And only thing I see is dollar signs

[Hook]
Yo, makin' that money's the American Dream
East coast to West coast, You know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown or Downtown, You pick the scene
You got to get your own scheme, we ain't splittin' this green

Nigga yo bitch chose me, You know the rules to the game
