[Produced by Logic]

[Hook]
Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'mma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks
Who the bitch riding with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally getting cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothing at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be asking us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judas is who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch I'm still the same
Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasing fame, chasing glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I been working hard, I been searching for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
Cause lately it feel like I’m just not your sister at all, all
I’m sorry for calling and bawling, I’m all in
And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
As as for [?] he left and he ain't coming back
I hate the man, if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting, selling that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To parish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful
Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinking of incredible moments we've had
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of your family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand with me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feeling under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga

[Verse 5]
Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors
I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now
I heard that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati cause then I gotta kill ya. I love you, son, bye
[Intro: Dresta]
"Yeah, Gangsta Dresta steps in this, motherfucker. And this one goes out to all the O.G.'s out there. And I can't forget about the baby gangstas, what's up, niggas? My nigga they came back with some of that old school original west coast shit, nigga. That got all of y'all in this dig in the first place, yeah. So run that shit E, yeah."

[Verse 1]
Cruising down the street in my 6-4
Jockin the freaks, slapping the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolling Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA

[Hook]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 2]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car trying to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck head pulled out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there, making that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinking
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinking
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talking shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross cold knocked him out

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I'm rolling hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped my 6-4 round the telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, "Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"
Walking home I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beaten for resisting arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doing the crime
Fourth offence on the boy, he'll do some time

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municiple court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six-year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "FIRE!" then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
The police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

[Hook]
[Intro]
Comp-ton, Comp-ton, Comp-ton
Real muthaphuckkin G's

[Verse 1: Eazy-E (Dresta)]
Hey yo Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
So you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about playin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre, motherfuck Snoop, motherfuck Death Row
Yo, and here comes my left blow
Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid you found a pup and now you're dapper
But tell me where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper
Talkin' bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his old album cover he was a she-thang
So nigga please, nigga please, don't step to deez
Motherfuckin' real G's

[Cuts] (x2)
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up
Boy you should have known by now

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Everyday it's a new rapper, claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the, nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard, is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness, to your fuckin' work
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me, knowing that they pranksters
This is going out to you studio gangstas
See I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talking about they come from projects
Knowing you ain't seen the parts of the streets G
Think you started trying to bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearing khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag, tried to sag, but you're flooding at the same time
And your set don't accept ya
Scared to kick it with your homies cause you know they don't respect ya
So nigga please, check nuts before ya step to these
Motherfuckin real G's

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition original baby gangsta
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker I'mma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
Cause if you do, then a pealed cap is all that would be left
See young niggas like me will break you off something
Claiming my city but, Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real motherfuckin G's

[Cuts]

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now nigga it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg, think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches, can come and suck my Doggy dick
Beating up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick, to smoking on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothing but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you're getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real motherfuckin G's

[Cuts]

[Outro]
Boy you should have known by now: Eazy Duz It
[Dr. Dre]
Hey yo, remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work (word)
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit, man
Hey yo Eazy! (Sup?)
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit

[Eazy-E]
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin bout my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggas in the path throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the MAC-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list
Then I played my old shit, it went somethin like this:

Cruisin down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin the bitches, slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin', Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin that GTA

[Hook]
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit

[Eazy-E]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chase him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

[Hook]

[Eazy-E]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there, makin that dolla
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right across and knocked his old ass out

[Hook]

[Eazy-E]
I'm rollin hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, "Oh brother
I'll throw it in the gutter and go buy another"
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beaten for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doin the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

[Hook]

[Eazy-E]
I went to get them out but there was no bail

Two days later in municiple court

The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

[Hook]
[Verse 1:Eazy-E]
Yeah, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff with this and don't slip
On a funky-dope track jump back
Strapped with a fat buddah sack and a 7-8 'Lac
Go clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing
It's so sweet, when you got money to spend
I got a proper big tilt and a fabec Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho
That's how it is, and that's how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow
Givin love to them playaz that I know is real G's

[Verse 2:2Pac]
Mobbin' like a motherfucker stuck
Can you put your middle finger out the window gettin' fucked off - liquor
Get loaded can't control it
Nigga pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bones act to the whole stack
Keep your dough fat

[Verse 3:Eazy-E]
Or you might get what we call the rat pack
I gives a damn bout a skanless trick
Let me hit it one time and trick that sick
I don't trip, gives my dough to no ho
That's how it is, I got no love for ya

[Verse 4:2Pac]
And jealous muthafuckas can't see
That it's the fame that caught these stupid bitches, pass the pussy free
So tell me why u sweatin' a muthafucka like me?
A young nigga tryin' to a hustle up some G's
You pussy ass playa hatin' hoes speakin' down on niggas
Jumpin' around at the shows
And your the first muthafucka to jump
To the trunk when it's time for fun
Little trick ass punk

[Verse 5:Eazy-E]
Dump dump on fools with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a g-ster, an OG-ster (who's that?)
A real playa named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk fools payin me
And broke groupies and hootchies don't faze me
I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinum and gold on the record shelf
I don't brag, but I do it like a straight up iz
Before you do a record, partner, handle your business

[Verse 6:2Pac]
And tell me what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce and bounced to a key
You gotta watch your back stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt
And now im in the rap game like the crack game
I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun
Stuck it, buckin' my muthafuckin magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Plus, shots at my adversaries
Dem niggas scary best it's time to be buried
Cause ill be buckin' in a fuckin hurry

[Verse 7:Ice Cube]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why you dont fuck with thugs
You wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck wit us (you know)
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why you dont fuck with thugs
You wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Outro: Ice Cube]
Every hood's the same {x6}
Stop trippin on me
Every hood's the sames(x6)
[Little Girl Voice]
He was once a thug from around the way. Eazy, but you should

[Eazy-E]
Bitch, Shut the fuck up. Get the fuck out of here
Yo Dre! (What's up?) give me a funky ass bass line

[Intro Hook]
What the fuck is up?
In the place to be
Coming on the mic is Eazy Mothafuckin-E
Dre is on the beat
Yella's on the cut
So listen up close while we rip shit up (shit up x5)

[Verse 1]
Well I'm Eazy-E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper group coming out the chute
Eazy-E, muthafukas cold knocking the boots
Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster, I used to be a mugster
If you heard (Compton), you think I own a drugstore
Getting stupid because I know how
And if a sucker talks shit, I give him a (POW)
8 ball sipping, the bitches are flipping
Slow down, I hit a dip and, continue my tripping
Hitting my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villian cold roaming the streets
And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats

[Hook]
Because I'm a gansta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuk, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy duz it

I was knocking muthafukas out
What's your name boy
Funky, fresh Eazy-E
Kick, kick that shit
Where you from fool, Compton, yea

[Verse 2]
Rolling through the hood, cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumping the box
But you know that's an alibi for slanging the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 24-7
Rolled them muthafukas, ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo'
Laughing in their faces and said you're all making me rich
Till one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (gunshots), Then I shot (gunshots)
As you can see, I cold smoked his ass (ha ha)

[Hook]

(Wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it)
Muthafuking Eazy duz it
But how does he do it
Eazy duz it do it eazy
That's what I'm doing
STOP
Man whatcha gonna do now

[Verse 3]
Now I'm a break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafuka
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starving cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I'm wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yea I went to jail but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the SHIT I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The baliff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the ho

[Hook]

From around the way, born in '73
Harcore B-boy named Eazy-E
It's '88 now, '73's obselete
A nigga wit a serious ass attitude and 100% street
And if you all wanna hear some more
In one way or the other, I'm a bad brother
Word to the muthafuka
[Intro]
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Suck on these nuts, nigga, suck on these nuts
I tell 'em bow-wow-wow yippie-yo yippie-yay
Suck on these nuts, nigga, suck on these nuts
Ain't nuthin' but Eazy baby
He'll smoke two niggas cause they crazy
Talk a gang of shit but it dont phase me
That punk nigga Dre still pays me

[Verse 1]
Well, if it's on motherfucker then it's on, G
Now if it's on motherfucker then it's on, G
Hey mister prankster prankster
Story book gangsta
Back in '86 you wore pumps and mascara
Down with the motherfuckin' Wreckin Cru, bitch
But once a bitch, always a bitch and now the fuckin' switch
Fag, with stethescope now you sag
Body slammin' bitches make Dre a bigger man
Khaki sportin' loc's in a G ride
What set you from loc what set you from ride
Rip Van Winkle sleepin' nigga woke up and became a G
But you still don't impress the Eazy
Smoke a little sherm now you call that shit the chronic
Niggas on the westside call it bionic
I make a mill here, make a mill there
Fuck a bitch here, fuck a bitch there, yeah

[Hook (x4)]
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on

[Verse 2]
Old nigga Eazy-E went to the cupboard
To get Snoop Doggy Dogg a bone motherfucker
Here's another G
Or should I say a H, a I, a J, a K, a L-M-N-O-P
P for the pussy wussy wuffin' nigga broke
As a motherfuckin' joke
Talkin' about you want to smoke the E to the A-Z-Y
Nigga this east side
Snoop Doggy Doggy Dogg you wanna try
187 on the E that ya sing
But you cling on my balls when I swing my ding-a-ling
Yeah you got more just like a pint of puppy water
First I'm gonna choke ya
Then I smoke ya, then I'm gonna
Toss ya in the back of my trunk
With the other punk
Smoking Death Row like I smoke a Phillie Blunt
Well if it's on motherfucker than its on, G
If it's on motherfucker than it's on, G

[Hook (x4)]

[Verse 3]
Still a nigga
Once a nigga
Always a nigga
Down from the getgo
Never let go
Never flossin
Never slippin
Never trippin
Stickin dick and my balls down your throat doggy listen
Niggas from the LBC
They never heard of ya G
And Niggas from the CPT ain't down with D-R-E
But ya gave it up
Still like a trooper
Let 'em play ya jam shake ya hand and then they shoot ya
You can fool the people on the east coast an the mid-west
But In LA you still can't pass the test
See I can tell a pussy when I see one
Dre wearing lip stick that mean ya have to be one
You need to change your sex and your occupation
You try to fuck with E nigga Run Run Run
Cause if it's on motherfucker then its on, G
Now if its on motherfucker then its on, G

[Hook (x4)]
24 hours to live...
24 hours to live...

Seven-thousand, four hundred, twenty three grains
Of sand drop from the hourglass
It's how much time I got left on this planet
Some motherfucker's gotta die!
I'm an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I'm gonna put these things on you, and never let up
See, my momma...she was wrong when I was born
That a nigga like E should'a never been born
Too late, big mistake in '72
It's '92, now the year of code blue
15 hours..11 minutes..30 seconds
I'm a motherfuckin' wreck
Gonna pay back niggas who did me wrong in the past
My days ain't long
I'm comin' strong and fast
Lock up 8 niggs..kill up 10 pigs
Innocent and fuckers are also dyin, too
Now what else can I do?
Fuck, fuck, fuck and plant my seeds
Leavin' kids in this world like me
The lunatic psycho mutherfucka Eazy-E

Chorus (sang)
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die

Sky diving, scuba diving
To Evel Knievel stunt car drivin'
Bungee cord jumpin' off a bridge
It's hard to breathe with a fractured rib
I can't take this shit
Let me see how much more time I got to spend
Hit more skins
Back up in her pussy
Up in the butt
I gotta let off
A few more nuts
I'm starting to panic
I'm starting to sweat
Cause I don't really wanna die yet
Dizzy spells, flashbacks in my head
Niggas ain't want me to bein' happy when I'm dead
But I ain't goin' out unless 30 niggas die
I'm dying anyway so I'm thinking suicide
Run into a crowd of niggas dyin' by the pistol
Took the motheruckin' whistle

Chorus

To sweep with the feet when he hit the concrete
Chop him up, dice him up and sacrifice his meat
Drag him by his ankles to the cemetary
(Screams)
Shut the fuck up nigga
Cause you ain't seen shit
I'm 'bout to take this blade and staight up grip
I'm holdin' the neck of the devil and drink his blood
Allowing my soul to be polluted by his evil root
And now I'm mad insane, red as rose as I strain for my hearbeat
To thumpety-thump to pump, it might burst
False alarms, and no harm that will commit to the E
But now I'm down to an hour 23
Time is moving fast, but not that slow
I thought I had an hour, but it's seconds left the go
I ran into the office
No more time is left
I ran up to the doctor with a bomb to my (BOOM)

Chorus

Spoken:
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
As time winds down to it's last 24 hours
In an earth that weighs 60 trillion tons
Travelling 1,037 1/3 mph, how do you define time?
What is a minute?
How important is an hour when 24 hours becomes a lifetime

Oooooh, so define how do we define time?
Now you choose
How will you spend your last 24 hours?
C'mon..talk to me

3X Chorus ("must die" is faded into next chorus loop)
[Intro]
Eazy-E: Yo Dre where's the goddamn drum machine?
Dre: Ah shit, I left the motherfucker with Pooh
Eazy-E:You dumb motherfucker what the fuck we gonna do now?
Yella: Hey man I got some drums in the back
Dre: Man what the fuck is he talking bout
Ren: Yo does it look like we can play some fucking drums?
Yella: Man I can play the drums
Everyone else: Bullshit!
Yella: Man I used to fuck it up at Compton High
Ren: Give this nigga some sticks
Yo Fuck it up Yella

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Yo we're two hard motherfuckers
Taking out any punk ass suckers
Can you believe this? if so be frightened
Were strong as fuck, with the power of a titan
Setting a mark of destruction get it
So don't front, and say you ain't with it
You wanna rumble with us you can't hang
Because we're something like a two man gang
Starting some shit is what we do best
Just care about ourself and say fuck the rest
So yo Eazy, bust it and shoot to kill
And tell these stupid motherfuckers the deal

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
I look you dead in the eye then I spit
I tell you to your face punk you ain't shit
I don't give a god damn about feelings
I'm just happy just as long as I'm killing
A 187's in progress, nigga
Just as soon as I pull this trigger
Automatic heavily, I start firing
And the kids on the block, I'm the one they're admiring
A bad mouth nigga on the violent tip
I catch you talking some shit and I'mma bust your lip
Now who you gonna tell that I'm making you soft
The police ain't shit cause I'm paying 'em off
I move slow, always ready to go so fuck it
And bitches on my dick, they know that they can suck it
I'm a hardhead, always having a fit
When I'm not allowed to tear up shit
I'm a hard motherfucker

[Hook]
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
(Repeat x4)

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Now look at me I'm a crazed bitch
With a gangster profanity pitch
Ren is a nigga that don't give a fuck
To a pussy ass fool trying to press his luck
I'm ready to scrap that's if you're ready to go
I'll take you out going toe to toe
E will start a conversion and hit you from the back
While you getting fucked by a ruthless jack
Critical condition is what you receive
Thinking of some back up to go and retrieve
But Eazy tell what would happen my man
(They would get fucked up by a ruthless clan)
So it's simple, we don't give a fuck right
So you and your boy can get the fuck out my sight
I'm on tilt with class getting ready to blast
Cause I'm a hard motherfucker

[Hook]

[Eazy-E]
Eazy and Ren is fucking it up again
Scheming up a plot before we begin
Because niggas like to stare like a bitch sometimes
They say how could them niggas have some hell of a rhymes

[M.C. Ren]
It's simple tell 'em what we mean
When the two baddest motherfuckers step on the scene

[Eazy-E]
Now this is some shit

[M.C. Ren]
Yo what are you saying

[Eazy-E]
You stupid motherfuckers, they think I'm playing
Talking all kind of shit of shit but I'm cracking it up
I can afford to laugh cause I'm backing it up
I'm not a buster I'm more like a hitman
So if you don't wanna throw then you can get down
You don't like the fuck away from me
So you can stop the shit, trying to fuck the E

[M.C. Ren]
You heard what he said and it's the truth so whats up
So if you want me to go well I'm about to nut up
The two baddest motherfuckers alive
So I don't think that you and your boys can survive
You gotta girl, well if she's good to go
I bet me and E already fucked the ho
A train was in effect and your bitch was rocked
By a hell of a nigga that was hard to stop

[Eazy-E]
Yo Ren lets jet let's get the fuck on out

[M.C. Ren]
Because everybody knows what we're talking about
We're two hard motherfuckers

[Hook]
[Intro: The D.O.C. & Fresh K]
Here's a mix to make you move, smooth enough to soothe
Slow and lower you can go inside a bassed up groove (So funk it!)
It's gotta be, ain't no need to discuss it
(Yo Doc!) I finna kick this shit, alright! (Alright, then bust it!)

[Verse 1: The D.O.C.]
Rhymes created by the Doc, most definitely down!
I could be bitten by this brother with some bad ass brown
It ain't no joke, he needs some scope
Cause his breath is (cold!) dope
As he talks I can smell it, and I'm seeing the smoke
That's the bad breath bandit, you know what's in store
Stay away cause they breath will knock you (to the floor!)
That boy is (rough!) de soda (tough!) I don't understand
Tests his breath inside his palm, and burned his hand!
He's a tucks destroyer, a Listerine killer
A cavity employer, a yuck-mouth filler
(Say man, you bullshit!) no, that's a fact Fresh K
I wish Velamints could take his breath away
But he's.. always in effect, smelling like dead vermin
Honking the bitches with his firewalls burning
Winch his witch as a curl, just as funky as well
I mean he has a little woman that can match his smell (Yes!)
He has a girlfriend, this is not pretend
She uses deodorant to spray for men
(Scratch and sniff wallpaper all over the house)
Aww shit! (Yeah boy, that's what I'm talking about)
They need ten bars of soap, three boxes of Tide
To make them presentable to go outside
Now my story is true, and my opinion candid
But that is my tale of the bad breath bandit

[Interlude:]
[The D.O.C] But you know, that ain't even half of the shit
[Fresh K:-] Man, what's up?
[The D.O.C] This bitch who stay around the way, you know her K!
[Fresh K:-] Yeah?
[The D.O.C] Y'all want to talk about her?
[Fresh K:-] Bust it!
[Dr. Rock:] Oh kick her ass, man

[Verse 2: The D.O.C.]
Let's talk about girl who's a bonafide witch!
Name is Tammy, better known as bitch!
The boys in the hood all treat her like liquor
Quick is the way they pass her around and then stick her
I'm not saying she minds, she's a first class skeezer
Always on the jock, but only if he's uhh..
Man with the money and the looks to show
(So you saying she's a witch?) yeah Tammy's a material whore
You're getting laid, if you can rock a cross-fader
You got the bank, to make the bitch who'll get paid
Tagging Tammy's a process like when you use a computer
Use her and do her like they did in the old days (Shoot her!)
A whore and she knows it, yeah the knowledge is there
So they say that she's slutty and she tell them she don't care
But y'all I'm keeping my clear, even though she is pretty
(Cause we only use Tammy for a guest to the city) right on!

[Interlude:]
[The D.O.C] But bust this, Tammy ain't the only fucked-up freak in the city
[Dr. Rock:] Well who else, man?
[The D.O.C] Aww, come on Rock, you know her now, You know her
[Dr. Rock:] Seabiscuit breath, right?
[The D.O.C] Yeah, that's her
[Dr. Rock:] Yo! Go on! Bust it homes!

[Verse 3: The D.O.C.]
You stand around the bitch and your nose turns white
You ever thought about what Big Bird's shit smells like?
Well, you take that aroma, multiply it times two
And you think about Sue (Sour-smelling Sue!)
She's a girl that has the power to kill a fresh flower
Rock smelled the whore and said (Damn that bitch is sour!)
Now, I don't judge, I mean that's not what I'm thinking
People do what they want, and I guess she like stinking
But whatever the deal, I think someone should call Guiness
Cause this is kicking a scent that fucks up K's tennis shoes
And a dress, dress it fresh to impress
She really ought to be embarrassed because that girl is a mess
If you ever see her, you'll duck and cover
She looks like your sister but smells like your brother
And since they tell me Trey, honestly phrase:
I let her know that she reminded me of the Gunsmoke days
But it ain't no (thing) if she stink she'll (sing)
But to me it's like she needs a little (Irish Spring)
You ought to know what I'm saying, I hope I made myself clear
About the three ass whores, but Troll I'm out of here

[Outro: The D.O.C.]
Yo yo yo, these three people make me so sick that I gotta go 1988 on it
Tammy your momma ain't got no legs be talking about
I ain't gonna stand for this.. Ha ha ha ha!

[Dr. Rock]
Boy you sick man! You sick! Yeah yeah

[Fresh K]
Yo man! I got a story from 1988, check it out
Sue, you got so much butter on your teeth
That when you brush your teeth you have to use a butter knife!
Ha ha ha ha!

[Dr. Rock]
Get ready for the king, here I come, now check this out
Sour smelling Sue got so much dirt in her ear
That she can grow potatoes, Ha ha ha ha!
(*Sound of Billiards' balls and a cue stick striking left and right*)

[Opening Skit: Km.G as a Night Club chairman]
Look here Kokane
I've been knowin' you for a long time, boy

[Hook: Kokane Chanting]
Original ones, original criminal minds
Original ones, original criminal minds, yeah
Original ones, original criminal minds
Tah tah tah tah tat tat tat tah tah

[Verse 1: Kokane]
I'm just a poor black nigga tryin' to this
Wake up, wake up to smoke the mothafuckin' homeless
No pain no gain, you can call it dope but my name is Kokane
Yo Alkaholiks, pass me the bambay
Cause I got more Hook-ups than Yave and the Ese
I got a 13-5 well, alright
Cause I gotta slang my funk at 17-5 a key
Now, what's up homes?
I be rollin' in a bucket full of birds and a mobile phone
Now, you whores might laugh
But you won't now when I'm rollin' up in 500 Rack
Cause niggas be havin' fly chips from the crack
And you wonder why your mothafuckin' ass got jack, boy
You shouldn't have to talk shit from the start
Cause you got no bite but all bark, boy, yeah

[Hook: Kokane Chanting X2]
Original ones, original criminal minds
Original ones, original criminal minds, yeah
Original ones, original criminal minds
Ahwww, Ahwww, Ahwww, Ahwww
Tah tah tah tah tat tat tat tah tah

[Verse 2: E-Swift]
It's the westcoast soul, representin'
Funky like George Clinton
I'm in the house like a kitchen
Niggas talkin' shit all bark but no bite
Say, good night, I challenge whack Emcees to a fight
Bad Emcees, I smoke your head with the ruler from the old schooler
Punch your ass like Don Shooler
Hard Core, that don't rock no soft shit
I flow like water from the faucet
Aww shit, here comes the raw shit
Back the funk up, I fit your track, I stack you for the duke up
Rough and ragged like a truck
All bite but all you're bitin' is my style
I hit the 40 Ounce and then I'll get buckwild
Check, E-Swift is a title
Yeah, I usually rock scratches with the vinyl
Peace from the Alkaholik wino
And I know, I know, I know, I know what you're thinkin'

[Verse 3: J-Ro]
This groove is so funky that is stinkin'
My Dress code is simply, Jeans and shit
I can't get in the clef cause my description don't fit
Those with clothes, left to see a fashion shows
So I sneak in the rear, hop on stage and bust souls
I'm J-Ro the Human hight
I like to rock the party 'til the twilight
Grab the girl, take her home
Hit the room and bump my shine lights on
Have no fear, I'm your Number one Bear
And you can't come here, cause who wants to play the rear?
I see too many niggas get a brain blow out
Now, I'm headed upstream like a rainbow Trout
I refused to catch the blues in the ghetto
Now, I get paid, to bring kids to life like Gepetto
It's The Liks, baby, and we ain't goin' to get whack
So Pooh'll buy a bud, hook us up with the thick sack
So you can bark if you want to
Boy, I'm comin' in the cut with my whole mothafuckin' crew
I'm the man, you knew I came to bust the dandy Rap
So I'm funkin' in front like the Handicap
E-Swift, 187Um, Kokane and Ro
With a finger and a "F" for Darryl Gates before we go

[Outro: Cold 187Um as a Night Club Security Keeper]
Yeah, that mothafuckin' song is over
But y'all can take your drunk ass go rappin' little mothafuckin ..
Aww no, no, no, you got to go home
Bitch, you got to get the hell out here
No, no, no, bit touchin' there.. over there boy
No, just get, just get your ass up out here
No, no, no, all barkin' not bitin'
You can't fish eatin, aww, uhh.. won't let have any..
You stupid old mothafucker..
Aww, just get your ass hole up out here
I don't have no comprehension shit, boy

(*Music fades as people evacuating off the Night Club*)
[Intro]
1999
The world's at its end
Fuck it
We want the money and the power
And go out with a bang

[Hook: Cold 187um]
Cause it's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my 9 put it on my chest bust some cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm coming from the C-P-T
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas runnin' back
Can't fuck with Eazy
[w/ Kokane - several times]
Wet 'em up

[Verse 1]
This is a real life jack in progress
Nigga, give up your shit or take two to the chest with the cripness
Cause I ain't fuckin' around, G
So take a look at a real live nigga that's crazy
And get ready to die, loc
Any last words
Before your ass gets smoked, it ain't a joke
Because my pockets is broke my friend
That's why I gotta do you in
Give up your ends and your gold and your brand new Nike's
And anything else I might like
And then I'm off in the wind again
To catch the next sucker
Slippin' takin' two to the chin
I'm on a role two niggas in one night
Didn't even have to fight
Just pulled out my 9 to end anothers life
That's real life so forget the silly shit you heard
Now nigga tell me, do you have any last words

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Another murder I committed made front page
A nigga dead from a drive-by, did him with a 12 gauge
The first stage of insanity
People say it ain't wise, to get faded of the St. Ides
A mother cries, another son lies in a casket
Life was fun while it lasted
That silly bastard had to get caught
Trippin' and set trippin'
You should have seen that niggas blood drippin'
To many lives took
To many hearts broke
But you don't hear me, you just see my fuckin' gun smoke
Some ask why do I take so many lives from
The innocent little ones
But where I come from
We take shit real
You peel caps so you get your fuckin' cap peeled
Grab your steel, forget about what you heard
It's do or die, nigga
Any last words

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got the 9 and I'm pullin', straight creep
Feel I need to take anothers life, so I peep
Checkin' the scene but stayin' low
So I'm not seen, case I gotta get away
Gotta make the shit clean, G
So I'm lookin' for a victim
Gotta be right took my time and I picked him
Scoped shit, then I licked him
Now I'm back in the news no clues but yet another murder
You should have heard the nigga squill when I stuck his ass
I had to grin cause it's funny, nigga, fuck his ass
He ain't the last and surely ain't the first, G
But his monkey ass rolled away in a hearse, G
So I'm feelin' some what relieved
Just another day in the life of the Eazy
A real G, so forget the silly shit you heard
It's do or die, Eazy-E gets that last word

[Hook]
[Verse 1 - Tairrie B]
Here we go on the flow, I got some suckas on the ill tip
So I suppose I'll have to straighten this up real quick
Give me that microphone and get lost
Who's taking over? the female mob boss
I'm strolling on punks like they ain't shit
Cuz I'm legit, and down with the Syndicate
But this is a Comptown hit, so it's public (Ruthless)
And thinking you can get with this is useless
I'm Tairrie B, I got this one for a purpose
Suckas trying to step because they see what's on the surface
But I'll pull your card, then we'll see who's got the hardest
It's not the color, it's the heart of the artist
And you can't ignore the woman who will roar
So look more close, notice the hardcore (hardcore)
Style, scope the dope profile
Listen a while, child, it's all compiled
Like a text, and the next to flex will get waxed
It ain't nothing but a pile of melted tracks
Schoolly, break it on down from the east coast
And let's stone cold toast

[Break]

[Verse 2]

[Tairrie B]
Now Schoolly's got the music and me, I got the lyrical
Eazy's by my side, making sure that the spirit goes
Into the show, and so the whole thing kicks
Echo Sound is where we mix

[Eazy-E]
Eazy-E's on the set and I'm removing all doubt
That a Ruthless bitch has just stepped out
[A Comptowner to the open?] that she's gulpin'
All the boyz in the hood...

[Tairrie B]
...and they go hopin'
They can get with me, like when you saw my cover
And stepped up to me trying to be my lover
But that ain't happening, yo, cuz I ain't with it
You tried to play the [declawed stay a minute?]
This style is so wild, boy you can't handle it
And if you try, I don't need a man to get
Stupid for me, I'll do just fine on my own
Gimme a microphone
And I'll rip up the system, steal the show
A girl gets out of hand and I'll smack the ho
So for those who thought I couldn't do this
(Yo Tairrie) What? (Show them who's Ruthless)

[Break]

[Verse 3]

[Tairrie B]
Now the cap I wear reads Comptown on it
Y'all can't read or something, shit
So a brother steps up talking all kinda junk
(Bitch, you ain't from Compton)

[Eazy-E]
Shut the fuck up, punk!
And pay your respects to the queen of Comptown

[Tairrie B]
Punks talking junk are the punks I stomp down
Heel to toe, in steel-toed boots
Platinum blonde with Italian roots
Clever with rhyming, forever like diamonds
You sleep while I creep so I keep climbing
Higher, objective: your desire
Always draped in the flyest attire
Damage is done and you can bet that I did it
With finesse, in a dress that's perfectly fitted
When I juice my hitlist, they can't get with this
Female caucasian, can I get a witness? (Yeah!)
I know you heard it before, I won't bore ya:
Yo Compton? Am I white and I throw ya?

[Spoken]
Yo Eazy
(What's up Tairrie?)
Yo everybody thinks that I'm rocking you and that's why I got a record deal
(Fuck naw, she won't even give me the pussy)
(Word)
(Chorus X4)
YEAH!
Black niggaaaaaaaaaa
YEAH!
Killa killa killa killa

Black nigga killa
Hate brought death
Around the block as the hollow points bust though the punks back
Raising gang feel no pain  as I penetrate
Niggas fly deep as I strike a quick pace
I got the evil of a dead nigga trapped in my mind
So my soul is a threat to my mankind
Born to kill I'm wicked by nature
Cause the streets of my neighborhood breed young hell raisers
I'm 30 ot 6 with the scope
I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast
Motherfuckers catchin heat
As I bring anger
And release more danger from my chamber
The evil in my blood is possessed
So I creep low from the back slow and puts lead in that nigga's flesh
Ain't no hope, every nigga wants to be the nine milla on the trigga
The black nigga killa

(Chorus X4)

Deep from the death as I crept
I can feel his Glock in the back of my neck
I'm thinkin to myself "what the fuck" as I pause
I can feel my heart thumpin from my balls
Up against his gun what the fuck could I do?
If I make a wrong move, the nigga might shoot
My pops always warned me when I was comin up
If I play pussy, I'm bound to get fucked
Though bein broke as hell it be drivin me crazy
Hooked up with my niggas start jackin niggas daily
Fat sacks of dough, to Dayton's, I got em
Slang em dirt cheap cause everything was profit
Now I got his nine on the back of my mind
As I watch my life pass right before my eyes
The shit that I done, is all in my face
Reflections of death as I step with my 38
The black nigga killa

(Chorus X4)

Which bitch made the statement?
About the nigga busting caps sporting all black Ben Davis
I'm out the door
My pager's blowin up I check my gat twice
Cause niggas like to jack on a late night
And as I'm livin like a criminal
I try my best to keep my gang tight and stay away from punk niggas
Strikin down Broadway
I caught some niggas out of bounds from the
Upper MLK
Slowly crept from the cut at a quick pace
Ain't no love in my heart all I feel is hate
So 25 with that L might be mando
Cause nigga I'm killing for them gold things with that Zapco
I watch the terror in eyes as he backed up
Ease of the break pop that clutch and watch his chest bust
Wide open as I bounce in the night quicker
From the nine milla trigga
The black nigga killa

(Chorus X10)
[Intro: Dresta]
"Yeah, Gangsta Dresta steps in this, motherfucker. And this one goes out to all the O.G.'s out there. And I can't forget about the baby gangstas, what's up, niggas? My nigga they came back with some of that old school original west coast shit, nigga. That got all of y'all in this dig in the first place, yeah. So run that shit E, yeah."

[Verse 1]
Cruising down the street in my 6-4
Jockin the freaks, slapping the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolling Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA

[Hook]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 2]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car trying to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck head pulled out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there, making that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinking
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinking
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talking shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross cold knocked him out

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I'm rolling hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped my 6-4 round the telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, "Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"
Walking home I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beaten for resisting arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doing the crime
Fourth offence on the boy, he'll do some time

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municiple court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six-year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "FIRE!" then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
The police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

[Hook]
[Dr. Dre]
Hey yo, remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work (word)
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit, man
Hey yo Eazy! (Sup?)
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit

[Eazy-E]
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin bout my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggas in the path throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the MAC-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list
Then I played my old shit, it went somethin like this:

Cruisin down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin the bitches, slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin', Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin that GTA

[Hook]
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit

[Eazy-E]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chase him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

[Hook]

[Eazy-E]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there, makin that dolla
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right across and knocked his old ass out

[Hook]

[Eazy-E]
I'm rollin hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, "Oh brother

(Eazy-E)
Here's the latest
From the king of badness
I got the shit that makes niggas wanna flip
G'd up all better wit beanies
Sweatin all the bitches to blow our weanies
Niggas all getting drunk, and smoking a bum bud
Oh wait here's a punk, pop the trunk
Cuz it's a gang of jackers in the front smoking
All the hump, some shit was said about blue and red
But I'm colour blind and I gotta nine
Threw up the sign I cock the 9, I cock the 9

(Loco S.A.B)
Well nigga pop the 9and let it holla
Test drive wit a neighbourhood's scholar
Black Impaler, blue chucks on gettin outta
Sucks on hip hop thugsta get the fuck on
Niggas looking shifty, do they wanna diss me, lick me
Show me love or peel my cap quickly
My six sense won't let me slip don't puff wit the draggin em
I'm still toe taggin em, hit the spot wit a don still baggin em
It's the low call, S.A.B on the vocal, blast my way out eazy pay
The way, all you bitch niggas stay out

(Hook) x2

I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 ( and everything is fine)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (*gun shot*)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)

(Phalos Mode)
It's like dice game, dice game niggas get they roll'on
Everything's all good till niggas getting sold on
Here we all get together and shoot, fuck
I grab my gun then I picked up my loot
But I didn't lose shit so it's all good
Leavin pumpin Eazy-E "Boyz n the Hood"
Cuz I'm a gangsta so I can relate, most of these
Niggas is fake and tryin to hate
I put a buster in his place, I put one in his face
Obey my first and give him the taste
That's how I duz it, that's how I do it
And the murder weapon that I use you know I threw it
He kept persuading so I had to do it, 'uh' play
For keeps that's the rule of the streets 'uh'

(Loco S.A.B)
Dick Tracy all on my nuttz like Cagny and Lacy
And don't faze me, Ruthless is the label that pays me
But this one H.K weighs a ton, words are yellow wit
The ??? freaks on a run, bring ya condom in the kingdom
Huh ho from the ceilin to the floor, info red at ya window
Plus the E go hangin out the beamer tho
Drop shit like a seagull, for the people
Ho's make a contribution, but y'all don't hear me tho

(Hook) x2

(Eazy-E)
Tuck ya legs to my dick with the wrap em real tight
Just incase its on and a nigga gotta fight, an a
Nigga gotta bust, but who in the fuck said in god we trust
The shit wen't down everybody start runnin
Bitches screamin and the bullets still comin
Run into a nigga tryin to save mine, reach for my gun ahh shit!!

(Hook) x6
[Intro: Eazy-E]
Straight off the streets of motherfuckin' Compton
It`s the downest nigga I know
Eazy motherfuckin' me
'bout to kick your ass in '93
(Creep with me, as I crawl through the hood)

[Hook: Eazy-E]
I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl
Creep creep
I said I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl
Creep creep

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
I got my niggas from Grape Street, Watts
I got my niggas from the C-P-T
I got my niggas all across the motherfuckin' land
That's down with the E-A-Z-Y-E
Now, early in the mornin' I awake
Thinkin' about these dead fool`s life that I had to take
Frontin' on a true name, I peep game at point-blank range
FUCK `EM
("Motherfuckin' right y'all.")
Back to the set as I jet
Not givin' a fuck about the nigga that I wet
That's what he gotta shout for actin' like a trick
Now he`s 6 feet and I`m deep in his bitch
Creepin', creepin', creepin' on the marks that be sleepin'
Catch you slippin' slap the clip in, buck `em every weekend
A scandalous lil` nigga with no heart to feel remorse
Dick the nigga's corps, leave it on his momma`s porch
Don`t give a fuck about shit, that`s why I mellow
Or maybe it`s the fact that I`m kin to the devil
A psychopathic nigga that's always quick to fill a
Nigga for a lick cause I`m a motherfuckin' killer
Thrilla from Manila though I`m shown as the average
Try to test your luck and get bucked by a motherfuckin' savage

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
I got my niggas from Grape Street, Watts
I got my niggas from the C-P-T
I got my niggas all across the motherfuckin' land
That's down with the E-A-Z-Y-E
Now, later on that night as I`m rollin'
Lookin' for a nigga I can gat and pack a hole in
Stoppin' at a light on the late night
Fire up a Philly Blunt to get my head right
See some niggas slippin' at a burger stand
And in my mind all I`m thinkin' is a murder plan
Creepin' through the drive-through kinda slow
I got my hot beams on the back of the '4, yo
Smokin' on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin' I`m about to lay their ass down
Reach for them fools, make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the gat to the nigga`s dome now he sleeps
One shot to the top body flopped on the seat, peep
I dumped on the lil` skinny passenger
A bitch is screamin' in a rage, so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about 5 blocks
Before I got stopped by punk ass cops
Shit, fuck `em
FUCK YOU
*shots*
Motherfucker, hahaha

[Hook]
(Intro- Cold 187'um)
Yeah what's up Kokane
"what's up player"(cold chillin'in this muthafucka)
Yeah we're just go on laid back in the studio, man on this groove
And talk about some muthafuckas, that we don't give a fuck about
(definetly don't give a fuck about, you know what I'm saying)
On some fly fly funk shit, (you know what I'm saying)
Some shit that niggas bit, "what's up partner ha ha ha-
I'm talkin to you Dre, don't bite my shit
Don't bite the funk that feeds you
Cause I sure the hell don't need ya
Ha ha what's up..
Yeah.. now while we're in the studio kickin' it off
(you know what I'm saying)- on the ill tip
You know, I wanna do some old school
You know, I wanna just kick some shit off
And show them muthafuckas I mean buisness -(you know what I'm saying)
So ah when the clock strikes to six
I'mma put them hoes in the mix (hi hi hi hi)
And I'mma do it like this for them ( ya know what I'm sayin')

(Cold 187'um)

Ahh yeah ahh
1-87 chillin' in my coup dippin'
One thing I can't stand is when fools get the set trippin'
Now I was down with the gang truce
Until I found out you was gettin' ganked by Dr. Suess
Now you can get Compton, Long Beach
South Central, Watts, Carson even Pomona
You can even ran to Timbuktu
But I'mma creep through the fog bitch and I'mma smoke you
Now I'mma take you through you history book
Uh ah let's take a look
Yeah- when I first came to Ruthless I was livin' like hustler
But see you, you was livin' straight like a busta
I used to think you was a troop
'til I remembered you was in the muthafuckin' Wreckin Cru
And then I looked at an old album cover
It was you chillin' lookin' gay as a muthafucka
I could have took it any kind of way
But see six months later you were NWA
And now it's gangsta gangsta pimpsta pimpsta
But to me you was still wimpsta wimpsta
Yeah you dissed Eazy-E but I'm confused
Cause you're scared as fuck to diss Ice Cube
Yeah now you're all straight smilin'and trucin'
But remember "yo Dre, stick to producin'"
Now you say you ain't gettin' gangked no more
But I know who owns Death Row.. really doe
Yo I got a little piece of paper from someone
And not one line on it reads Andre Young
You try to diss my record deal, but I'm still quick
I'm on a mission, and I'm going for the fuckin' gift
So next time your in the place
I'm hollering 1-8-7 with my Glock in your fuckin' face
Cause real niggas don't go out that quick
So it's cool that you bit my shit- bitch
Cause I'm a baller by far and plus a G
And I like my chronic twist with some VSOP
See broke niggas can't buy it cause it costs ends
Shut the fuck up, you're just Dre's broke friend
Snoop Dogg you better get your paper work right
Because if not you'll be all bark with no bite
Yo- see we go kinda back see
But see things got fucked up when your flunkie tried to diss me
You need to go and check your puppy, G
Because who the fuck is he, to jump up and diss me
Cause I'm a nigga with a gang of funk
And I'mma show the muthafucka to keep my name out his mouth
Yo- I never got smoked you muthafucking new jack
You fuckin' around with me you gonna end up on your back
Yo try to diss me to get respect
But you sounded like a muthafuckin Redman reject
I give props when props are due
And my props to you is muthafucka fuck you
You're just a flunkie for the D-R-E
You punk muthafucka, you wannabe G
And you know I always drop the shit proper
You can ask your homies or you can ask the doctor
But he don't get no props neither
I'mma say it on wax and I can say it when I see ya (fool)
Try to kick it like you got stamina
Whoop that ass like Luke did in Atlanta
Oops did you slip, did you trip, did you run
Did he have a gun, did you want some
No I don't think so (ah well)
Here's a bone you can choke
Get your ass with the mafia loc
Yeah fool, so what you wanna throw up
Cause you're broke as a muthafucka
Lookin tore up
But I'm the original 1-87 no one can do it better
So I'm out, and peace to my homie Snoop
Yo I hope you get yours before they do you- yeah
And that's realer then a juice of a duce
See some might not like it but yo it's the truth

(SweetTalk (aka Kokane) )

Boop boop be doo- well alright y'all
Yes lordy, ah some say it's like the Peanuts Gang
I took your house off ya Snoopy- well a wrong
Say Dre, my name it's Sweet Talk
Now do you belive in funk after death?
Cause I do, so watch this

(Kokane)
It's like dip-dip-a-la we got to make a stack
We can fix your funk when the shits on the flat
Pump pump you up, send you on your way
And I don't belive in celebratin' Dre day
It's like "Hear ye, hear ye! Come one, come all!"
Kokane is servin suckas at the players ball
If you come up the deal
You will get blasted
A tisket, a tasket, we throw your body in the basket
It's a wonderful day in my muthafuckin neighborhood
A wonderful day in my goddamn neighborhood
Now rollin' tip-toe, incognito
Ichin' to serve a fool when my pump says so (Pump Pump)
Is another nigga with the D is plottin
And if you're fuckin with this nigga
You'll be spittin' out buck shots
So no pain no gain
Bakin soda free and they call me Kokane
Now I'mma fuck you up Kurupt
Cause I'mma bust trough your hood like the Schlitz Malt Liquor bull
Cause you gets no propers
Now your throwin' up the Pound
But I'm throwin' up the Black Mafia
Can't stop ya, what you wanna do?
Bring it on Snoop
And your whole fuckin' Puppy Pound crew
It's the nickel-slick nigga from Pomona
Not fake like lacers
But real like 'Tona's
Snoop Dogg you fuckin cold hopped it
Did most of the writing for Dre
And still you get your troops dropped
Now I see nigga's rich
But you was in the county washing master's shoes like a bitch
Now who's been sleepin' in my bed
Eatin' my funk, takin dope styles by the chunk
Cause I'mma funky to the finish
Cause your funk got a gang of B-12 in it

Outro (Kokane):

Yeah in case you didn't know
It's Black Mafia Life for life- fool
Above The muthafuckin' Law
UBU- what you wanna do
Black Hole of Watts
To my homies over there an shit
And to my funkinmuffin' Coconut
We clowns and ....yeah
[Dr. Dre:]
"I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess."
Bitch!

[Intro: Eazy-E]
Ah, greetings eartlings
And welcome to the motherfuckin' wonderful
Wonderful, motherfuckin' world of gettin' higher than a motherfucker
Oh me, I'm funk on your mind
Alias to you motherfuckers Roach Clip
And this here is my Kimosabe dumpin' shit on your ass

And we 3-65, that means we're fucked up all year round
And our motto is:

[Hook]
Gettin' higher than a motherfucker
Down to the laaast roach

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Creepin' through this cloud of smoke
With a little bit of funk to make ya choke in
Gangstas come feel good inside
As we take you for a ride to another dimension
Deep from a 40 OZ
Two crooked ass niggas on a cosmic journey
Straight from the planet G
Where the real niggas dwell in the realms of Ruthless
Took a puff of the indo spliff
High like a bird as I creep to the bud spot
Break me off a proper piece
So I can get fucked up with my nigga Roach Clip
B.G. Ash Tray, dump that ass Dre
Ruthless family, high as can be
Smoke that psychadelically insane
And gettin' higher than a motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shaki]
As I step through the smoke
Deep from a land broke niggas don't come to
Straight to Indonesia
Chronic fever
Step off punk, we don't need ya
Blaze a blunt to the boogie
And come take a ride on a journey with a real G
Life is easily explained on a level
Of smokin' bud with the motherfuckin' devil
In my imagination
Sup with these thoughts what a fly creation
Indo smoke from the land of G's
Lettin' them know they can't handle these, nigga
Straight from the planet dime
I have come, to put funk on your mind
Eazy-E better known as Mr. Roach Clip
So pass the bud cause we still gettin' higher than a motherfucker

[Hook]

Now I'm real fucked up yes, high as hell
Ring ding ding do I hear some bells
Or am I just trippin'
Thinkin' about that 4 that I'm dippin'
Front, back, side to side
On corners that's how a nigga gotta ride
Dip to the, dip to the back
Bumpin' Eazy-E on 8 track
So blaze up a another skunky, funky, dookie, doobie
So we can get loogied
Up some more, up, up it go
What's my name "Eazy-E", yo, the motherfuckin' bud smokin' loc 'n

Gettin' higher than a motherfucker

And got a gang of crazy homies that you can't fuck with
Bald head, creased up, got my shit, I'm strapped

[Hook]

[Toker, Danger and Wicked]
South Central, Eastside

Knocking them fools out, shank in the neck

(Alright, go)
This comes from the E Chapter 8 verse 10, and it reads:
It's time to put some niggas in check
When you shoot a gun, hot shells eject
Catch 'em they get used as evidence
Only when they get brushed for finger prints
You ask why am I like this
Cause you wanna hear about shit like this
So I tell it how I know it, just hope the fuck I don't show it
Niggas out frontin', loitering and looting
Let's recreate a drive-by shooting
More brothers in a car blocks away
Waiting to spray, shotgun, Mack-10 and an AK
They roll through to a line of niggas
It was 9 just like the fuck they figured
Go around tha corner come back real slow
Lights off, car's in neutral, rollin' at a snail's pace and creepin'
Hoping to catch all of them sleepin'
A so-called gang, drugs and sex (NWA)
Start busting a cap and all the others jet, 3 of 'em fall to their doom
Pronounced dead at the scene, with gun shot wounds
3 dead because Compton is scandalous
I'd like to tell you, brother, ashes to ashes, dust to dust (Amen)
Da da da
(You will now witness the sound of ??)
(We will now pass around the hat)
(That's good enough)
No it ain't, you fucked up, you fucked up (it's cool)
No, it ain't
[Little Girl Voice]
He was once a thug from around the way. Eazy, but you should

[Eazy-E]
Bitch, Shut the fuck up. Get the fuck out of here
Yo Dre! (What's up?) give me a funky ass bass line

[Intro Hook]
What the fuck is up?
In the place to be
Coming on the mic is Eazy Mothafuckin-E
Dre is on the beat
Yella's on the cut
So listen up close while we rip shit up (shit up x5)

[Verse 1]
Well I'm Eazy-E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper group coming out the chute
Eazy-E, muthafukas cold knocking the boots
Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster, I used to be a mugster
If you heard (Compton), you think I own a drugstore
Getting stupid because I know how
And if a sucker talks shit, I give him a (POW)
8 ball sipping, the bitches are flipping
Slow down, I hit a dip and, continue my tripping
Hitting my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villian cold roaming the streets
And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats

[Hook]
Because I'm a gansta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuk, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy duz it

I was knocking muthafukas out
What's your name boy
Funky, fresh Eazy-E
Kick, kick that shit
Where you from fool, Compton, yea

[Verse 2]
Rolling through the hood, cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumping the box
But you know that's an alibi for slanging the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 24-7
Rolled them muthafukas, ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo'
Laughing in their faces and said you're all making me rich
Till one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (gunshots), Then I shot (gunshots)
As you can see, I cold smoked his ass (ha ha)

[Hook]

(Wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it)
Muthafuking Eazy duz it
But how does he do it
Eazy duz it do it eazy
That's what I'm doing
STOP
Man whatcha gonna do now

[Verse 3]
Now I'm a break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafuka
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starving cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I'm wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yea I went to jail but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the SHIT I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The baliff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the ho

[Hook]

From around the way, born in '73
Harcore B-boy named Eazy-E
It's '88 now, '73's obselete
A nigga wit a serious ass attitude and 100% street
And if you all wanna hear some more
In one way or the other, I'm a bad brother
Word to the muthafuka
[Dre]
Yo man I don't think they heard you
Why don't you tell 'em what ya name is

[Eazy-E]
My name is Eazy yeah this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore yo I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is Eazy or just call me E
But It doesn't really matter to me
Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I co get ill
But I'm like that and thats an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who tries to cope
If the rhyme I'm displayin'
And the beat that's playin'
Yo you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W
Cause Eazy's doin it Compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some
Yo it's Eazy-er Said Than Dunn

[Hook]
Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

[Eazy-E]
Now it's easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss yo I'm a gangsta
And I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trama
With the E-A-Z-Y-E comma now that's drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
I'm comin' off hard in the third demention
With the glare
But you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there
With the E on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope mc employer on Ruthless and thats my label
To get the money, the women, and co bust the fat cable's
Boy, master rhymers of toys
I mean str8 while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gonna diss me if ya don't even know me
(Eazy - E: Yo Ren)
(M.C. Ren: What sup)
Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound
And next time I'm peelin ya cap
To let ya know where I'm comin' from

[Hook]
Wooooooo!

[Eazy-E]
Radio jams are the part of the cycle

Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know
(M.C. Ren: but what if she's ugly)
Eazy come Eazy go

Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15
The fellaz would annoy me
The ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do
I wishin' nothin' lady's do
Cause the ladyz I luv 'em
Nice and then soft

Sayin' on your records you could get some
Yo home boy its Eazy-er Said Than Dunn

MASTER RECORDINGS OF ERIC WRIGHT
COPYRIGHT MATTER
OO: LOS ANGELES

RE memo to SAC dated 07/05/95

The writer was advised by [redacted] who advised that during his investigation into estate claims, former RUTHLESS RECORDS (RR) [redacted] advised that rapper EAZY-E had several master recordings in two suitcases in the trunk of his car prior to his death. These belong to the estate of EAZY-E. [Redacted] believes that [redacted] set up a deal with a man in Canada named [redacted] who had these masters in his possession.

[Redacted] was advised by [redacted] that [redacted] said [redacted] had put him up to it. An attorney from [redacted] firm telephonically contacted [redacted] and confirmed this. [Redacted] later changed his story and stated that [redacted] had told him to set up the company, not [redacted]. [Redacted] subsequently questioned both [redacted] and [redacted] and both denied knowing [redacted] or giving him any recordings.

The writer has interviewed [redacted] of RUTHLESS RECORDS who has stated that he has no knowledge of who [redacted] is or [redacted] or [redacted] involvement in the case. The writer has also interviewed [redacted] who has advised that her client has no knowledge of who [redacted] is. Additionally, she denies sending suitcases of master recordings to [redacted]. [Redacted] has given a deposition in the estate case stating that "I have never met [redacted]. [Redacted] have never hired him for any purpose, and I have never paid him any money for any purpose;".

The writer has also interviewed [redacted] who denies having anything to do with providing the master recordings to [redacted]. [Redacted] has provided the writer with four original tapes of telephone conversations he had with [redacted] in an attempt to determine who set this up. The writer has reviewed the tapes where [redacted] states that [redacted] each to set up an office for RR in Ontario. He states that she [redacted] claims to have taped conversations with [redacted] regarding setting up the deal.

The original telephone number for [redacted] was [redacted] with a business address of [redacted] this number is no longer in service. During one of the taped conversations between [redacted] he gives a pager number of [redacted]. [Redacted] claims that he has put all evidence in this matter in storage in Canada and during conversation with [redacted]. In addition, [redacted] states that he can't come back to Los Angeles because he [redacted]. He also claims that [redacted].

The following investigation needs to be conducted:

1. Have the four tapes provided by [redacted] transcribed.

2. Prepare FD-192 for the twpes once a case number has been assigned.

3. [Redacted] may be in his [redacted]. Attempt to run wants and warrants for him using the name [redacted] for [redacted] in LAPD's computer.

4. Send lead to Legat Ottawa, to contact landlord for above business address to obtain possible whereabouts for [redacted]. Attempt to obtain subscriber information for the business number and pager number for [redacted].

5. Obtain [redacted] home telephone number from her attorney (if she will provide it) for the house she is renting in [redacted]. If the attorney will not provide it, ask [redacted] to research any of his records to obtain the number. Then subpoena her records to see if there are telephone calls to the business or pager number in Canada. Remember that she allegedly called him only once to find out who he was. (See FD-302 for [redacted].

6. [Redacted] has agreed to take a polygraph regarding this matter. Consider using it to rule him out which would leave [redacted] as the only other person with access to those masters.

7. Contact [redacted] and request a meeting with [redacted] and the accountants to determine if their audit has uncovered embezzlement of funds from RR as alleged by [redacted]

8. Read FD-302 of [redacted] and determine if anyone should be interviewed regarding meetings between [redacted] and others at which they discuss being in possession of masters or DATS (high quality tapes) of EAZY-E's and want to put out an album. [Redacted] was fired in [redacted] from RR and has no legal right to possess such recordings.

It should be noted that [redacted] is a valuable source of information since he has access to all of [redacted]. He has provided copies of depositions and other pertinent information regarding this matter and originally contacted the FBI regarding this case. He can be reached at [redacted].

FD-302

Date of transcription 7/21/95

On July 18, 1995, [redacted] appeared at the Los Angeles Office of the FBI with [redacted] for the purpose of being interviewed regarding his knowledge of copyright matters. [Redacted] was advised of the identity of the interviewing agent and the purpose of the interview and provided the information contained herein.

[Redacted]

[Redacted]

Sometime in 1991 he received a phone call from [redacted] of RR who said he needed help because some of the [redacted] were threatening to kill WRIGHT and [redacted] if [redacted] didn't release the other NWA members from their contracts.

When [redacted] called [redacted] to consult with him on a course of action [redacted] told [redacted] to call the police. [Redacted] stated that he couldn't do this because of the type of people, namely gang members, that he was dealing with and RR's artists were rap artists, some of which were former or current gang members. [Redacted] didn't want to lose his artists. [Redacted] provided bodyguards to protect [redacted] and WRIGHT and brought in attorneys to help settle the business disputes.

[Redacted]. Since WRIGHT's death [redacted] has not been allowed to enter RR.

[Redacted] was asked to provide information regarding a man named [redacted] who is allegedly in possession of two brief cases which contain master recordings of WRIGHT and which belong to RR. He stated that he received a telephone call from the [redacted] who told him that a man in Canada was opening an office using the name of RR and that someone had changed the message on the answering machine stating that RR had moved to Canada and provided the caller with a new telephone number for RR. [Redacted] told [redacted] that when [redacted] spoke with [redacted] he told [redacted] that [redacted] had put him up to it. [Redacted] asked him if he knew [redacted] and he stated he did not. He advised the writer that he only knows one person in Canada and that she had contacted RR in 1994 and needed licensing clearance for RR to sell their products in Canada. [Redacted] had told this woman to send the required paperwork to RR so that RR could go ahead and sell RR products there. He does not know if RR ever received the paperwork and never did a follow-up on this matter.

On or about May 9, 1995 [redacted] called [redacted] and asked him who gave him permission to use RR's name and why he was doing this. He said "It's a free country" and that he could use whatever name he wanted. The first time he called Canada to speak with [redacted] another man answered the phone and [redacted] left his pager number for [redacted] to page him. [Redacted] paged [redacted] and [redacted] called him back. [Redacted] told [redacted] that using the name of RR was copyright infringement and that he would get the authorities to close him down. After some discussion [redacted] admitted that he did not know how involved this was and that [redacted] put him up to it.

At this point in the interview, [redacted] provided the writer with four original tapes which contained conversations between [redacted] and [redacted] that [redacted] had recorded without [redacted] knowledge.

During these conversations, [redacted] never mentioned that he had master recordings but [redacted] believes he does have DATS. [Redacted] told [redacted] that he had two titanium briefcases that [redacted] gave him but that he doesn't know the contents and hasn't been able to open them. [Redacted] said that the description of the briefcases matched the two briefcases that [redacted] had and usually contained DATS of [redacted] recordings which [redacted] kept in the trunk of his car. The writer asked [redacted] if the heat would destroy the DATS if they were kept in the trunk for a long period of time and [redacted] said they would not be destroyed by the heat.

[Redacted] stated that [redacted] wanted [redacted] to give him money in exchange for one of the suitcases. He stated that he wanted $25,000. He told [redacted] that [redacted] had already given him and one other man working with him $12,500 each for going up to Canada but that she wouldn't pay them the rest of the money. [Redacted] believes that [redacted] may have also asked the Special Administrator for money as well. [Redacted] told [redacted] that [redacted] told him what to do in setting up the office in Canada and to go to the press and talk about what a poor job [redacted] was doing in managing RR.

[Redacted] was asked by the writer who had access to the vaults where WRIGHT kept his master recordings. He stated that [redacted] and [redacted] were the only ones with keys.

[Redacted] denies having any masters or DATS that are the property of RR. [Redacted]

[Redacted] states that he was contacted by and met with a homicide detective from the BEVERLY HILLS POLICE DEPARTMENT recently. They were apparently looking into WRIGHT's death and investigating whether WRIGHT died on his own.

[Redacted] was asked what he knew about [redacted]. He stated that to his knowledge, she was one of WRIGHT's girlfriends. She married him "24 hours before he goes into a coma". [Redacted] believes that [redacted] lived with WRIGHT but was suppose to move out. She did but then moved back in when WRIGHT became ill. He broke up with [redacted] prior to entering the hospital. [Redacted] stated that WRIGHT stayed at the apartment of another girlfriend named [redacted] LNU). He went to New York in December of 1994 to the MTV Music Awards and took another girl named [redacted] (LNU). [Redacted] told the writer that WRIGHT had no reason to marry [redacted] because he enjoyed having several girlfriends.

[Redacted]. He was asked by the writer to provide information about his current employment. He stated that he [redacted]. One is located in [redacted] and the other is located in [redacted]. He claims to be [redacted]. He stated that he also [redacted].

He was asked by the writer if he is setting up a competing business with RR and he stated that he is not at this time but may in the future. He claims that he is not currently setting up any deals with artists. He stated that some artists have told him they are interested in doing business with [redacted] in record deals.

[Redacted] was asked if he was friendly with [redacted]. He stated that he talks with him occasionally. [Redacted] lives in either [redacted] or [redacted] his telephone number is [redacted]. He lives two doors from a house owned by [redacted] also talks with [redacted] calls him once in a while for information. He has also spoken with [redacted] about accounting information.

[Redacted] was asked who had access to the answering machine at RR and could change the message on the answering machine. He stated that [redacted] and [redacted] claims that he doesn't have the code to change the answering machine and had never heard of [redacted] until he was contacted by the Special Administrator.

[Redacted] was advised by the writer that certain individuals associated with this case claim that [redacted]. He denied that and stated that he has no association with [redacted]. He claims that the last time he traveled outside of the United States was in [redacted].

[Redacted] was asked what he knew about the "bootlegging" of BTH music. He stated that [redacted] had heard that [redacted] at RELATIVITY RECORDS had information regarding this. [Redacted] stated that he had no other information regarding this.

[Redacted] added that during his conversation with [redacted] [redacted] claimed that he couldn't return to the United States because [redacted]. [Redacted] believes that [redacted] and the other man with him are caucasians. [Redacted] last contact with [redacted] was [redacted]. He doesn't know where he is now.

[Redacted] agreed to by polygraphed if requested to do so by the FBI. He provided the writer with a copy of a three page Memorandum dated 05/09/95, written by an attorney named [redacted]. The memo summarizes a conversation between [redacted] and [redacted] during which [redacted] states that [redacted] put him up to this and that he doesn't know who [redacted] is.
