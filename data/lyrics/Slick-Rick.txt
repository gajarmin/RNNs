[Produced by Slick Rick]

[Intro]
Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?
Please, huh, please?
Alright, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook
Y'all tucked in?

[Verse 1]
Here we go
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought ta good
There lived a lil' boy who was misled
By another lil' boy and this is what he said:
"Me and you, Ty, we gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash"
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said "Keep still, boy, no need for static"
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said "Why did ya hit me?"
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
"I'll do years if I pull this trigga"
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radioes it to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked around good and from expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said "I need bullets, hurry up, run!"
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead
He told the cops "Back off or honey here's dead"
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
He dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
Straight 'n narrow or yo' soul gets cast

[Outro]
1: Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird
2: I know right what does he mean by
“Straight ‘n narrow or yo’ soul gets cast"
1: I don’t know, I think he be crackin' it up or something
2: Well, goodnight
1: Goodnight
[Intro]
OK, party people in the house
You're about to witness something you've never witnessed before
Yes it's the original human beat box, Doug E Fresh
And his partner, the grand wizard, MC Ricky D
D and that's me in the place to be
And we gonna show you how we do it for '85, kick it live, alright
Because, um, I've got a funny feeling, um
You're all sick of all these crap rappers
Biting their rhymes because um they're back-stabbers
But uh when it comes to me and my friend Doug Fresh here
There is no competition cause we are the best, yeah
Finesse impress which we prove
And y'all will realize that we are the move
So listen close so you all don't miss
As we go a little something like this
Hit it

Ah yeah
Uh, uh, you know what
La-di-da-di
La-di-da-di
La-di
La-di
You know what, yo peep this

La-di-da-di, we like to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody, we're
Just some men thats on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic right
For all of y'all keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause it's cool when you cause a cozy condition
That we create, cause that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this type of shit, it happens every day
I woke up around ten o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Had some soap on my face and my hand upon a cup
I said, "Um, mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all?"
There was a rumble jumble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, "You are, you conceited bastard!"

Well that's true, thats why we never have no beef
So then I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth
Used Oil Of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the files for my fingernails
Due to the night and on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I could have a bubble bath
Clean, dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Gucci underwear
For all the girls I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and the Polo cologne
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on the Bally shoes and the fly green socks
Stepped out my house stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my Kangol
And then I dilly (dally)
I ran though a (alley)
I bumped into my old girl (Sally) from the (valley)
This is a girl plays hard to get so I said
Whats wrong cause she looked upset, she said
"It's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away and now my life is filled with rainy days
And I love you so, how much you'll never know
Cause you took your love away from me."
Now what was I to do
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said, um, don't cry, dry your eye
Here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother stepped up, said to me hi
Looked Sally in the face and decked her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong, I said what is going on
I tried to break it up, I said "Stop it, leave her!"
She said "If I can't have you, she can't either"
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out like I had the chicken pox, but
She gave chase, she caught up quick
She put a finger in the face of MC Rick
She said, "Why don't you give me a play
"So we can go cruising in my OJ?
"And if you give me that OK
"I'll give you all my love today
"Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, can't you see
"Somehow your words just hypnotize me
"And I just love your jazzy ways
"Oh, MC Rick, my love is here to stay!"
And on and on and on she kept on
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, "Cheer up," I gave her a kiss
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you miss."
She says,"No, you're not!" then she starts crying
I says, "I'm nineteen," she said, "Stop lying!"
I says, "I am, go ask my mother
"And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover!"

To the tick tock ya don't stop
To the tick tick ya don't quit
Hit it!

Don't never forget, Doug E Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew
[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
The most exciting stage show you've ever witnessed
Appearing live, Doug E Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew

(Oh my God!)

[Doug & Rick]
Excuse me Doug E Fresh
Yes?
Have you ever seen a show with fellas on the mic
With one minute rhymes that don't come out right
They bite, they never write, that's not polite
Am I lying?
No, you're quite right
Well tonight on this very mic you're about to hear
We swear, the best darn rappers of the year
So, so, cheerio, yell, scream bravo
Also, if you didn't know this is called The Show

[Doug & Rick]
A-yo Doug

Yo Rick, I was about to but I need the shoehorn
Why?
Because these shoes always hurt my toe
Six minutes...
Six minutes...
Six minutes Doug E Fresh you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh uh uh on
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh uh uh on
Uh uh on

(Is it real?)

[Doug & Rick]
Here we go (here we go) come on (come on)
Here we go (here we go) come on (come on)

Excuse me Doug E...
Excuse me Doug E...
Excuse me Doug E Fresh you're on
Uh uh on

[Doug E Fresh]
Well it started off on 8th Avenue
When I made up the name called the Get Fresh Crew
It was me, my two DJs Chill Will and Barry B
And my right hand man Ricky D
I used to rap and sing, make sounds and things
And for example, here's a telephone ring

{Ring, ring} Hello, is Doug E Fresh in?
No, he's not in right now {click}

But anyway, no more delay
Just check out the new style I display
Now you got to be (fresh)
To rock with (fresh)
And I'm D-O-U-G-I-E (fresh)
And I'm known for the... {Doug E Fresh beatbox}
Not for the... {Fat Boys beatbox}
The human beat box or the entertainer
No other title can fit me plainer
In a passing generation, I am a remainer
And I'm also known as the beatbox trainer
Cashing checks, make sound effects
And after I finish rocking, Slick Rick is on next
(You know it) Slick Rick!

[Slick Rick]
Well, here's a little something that needs to be heard
Doug, I was going downtown (word, Rick?) Word!
(Sure) all alone, no one to be with
Stepped on the D-Train at 205th
I saw a pretty girl (so?) so I sat beside her
Then she went roar like she was Tony the Tiger
I said hold on, there's been a mistake
Honey, my name's Slick Rick not Frostie Flakes
(Oh, golly wolly) Cause she was raising hell
She said, um, my name is Maggie but call me Michelle
Michelle, my belle
Sont des mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
Slick Rick and 'em rock the house you know I'm saying
And when I'm on the mic there won't be no delaying
Bust a move, we show and prove
A-yo Doug, do that record Jam On The Groove

[Outro: Doug E Fresh]
As you can see, most definitely, we are (fresh)
Chill Will (fresh)
Barry B (fresh)
Ricky D (fresh)
And I am the original human beat box, the entertainer, Doug E (fresh)
[Verse 1: Mos Def]
The way I feel, sometimes it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face but it's really no joke
You feel it in the streets, people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down their focus
The focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes you don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep
And it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral of a shell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Soul is the lions roar, voice is the siren
I swing round, ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckas trying to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well

[Hook]
What it is, you know, they know
What it is, we know, y'all know
What it is, Ecstatic, there it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is

And always on time and rockin ya mind

[Verse 2: Slick Rick]
Sit and come relax, riddle off the mac
It's the patch, I'm a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well say about noonish, comin' out the whip
And lookin at me curious, a young Iraqi kid
Carrying laundry, "What's wrong G? Hungry?"
"No, gimme my oil or get [fuck] out my country"
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff
'til his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, feeling like I've pissed upon wound
I'm like, "Surely hope that we can fix our differences soon!" Bye!
Buying apples I'm breakin' on
You take everything, why not just take the damn food, black monster? Like I don't understand it, on another planet
15 month of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasing the sentiment, gentlemen
Getting down on their middle eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crowd
Walk over kicked one of my fabulous raps (la dee da dee)
Arab jaw drop, they well wish, they glad rap
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad

[Sample]
Omar: Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries
Ali: They sent you?
Omar: Yeah, so? Here

[Hook]
(Singing)
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier, yeah
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier

Well he's in Indian Town, and what spots his eye?
A nice looking Indian, and honey looked fly
He had to talk because he just couldn't hack it
She wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket
He trotted over and invented a line
He said "Excuse me, um, do you happen to have the time?"
All was on his mind was sex, sex, sex
So she said "Why do ask? You got your own Timex"
To poor old Dave that line was cold blooded
He felt that her ego was way over flooded
She started to laugh and then she started to say
"I'm sorry some times I do get carried away
I didn't mean to like ill treat you
My name is Running Rabbit and I'm glad to meet you"
He said "I'm Dave, with crazy clout"
"Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about
Yeah, you must be, because you look like a winner
Come to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner"

(Singing)
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier

Well, he met her father, Big Chief Beretti
He said "What's for dinner?"
"Soup and spaghetti"
The dinner was rotten and he swore he's gonna puke it
He never would have took it if he'd known that he had cooked it
Later on they were chilling, in the bedroom
Sitting at the window looking at the moon
Judging from the mood he swore she was hot
He said "Are you in the mood?"
She said "No I'm not"
From what he believes and from what he gets
When a girl says no, he really thinks she means yes
So, he started touching her and coming out strong
Whispering sweet nothings and singing a song
He said
(singing) "I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood, don't mean to be rude
But I'm in the mood for love"
She said "Oh Dave, you've got my poor back hurting
I want you, but first close the curtain"
He closed the curtain and also the doors
The next thing you knew it was off with those drawers

"Take it easy Davy, you're hurting me. Stop"

Well, he was playing with her tits, they were soft not lumpy
And then he cracked the legs like Humpty-Dumpty
He's fucking, sucking, also finger popping
He had, no intention of stopping
Crazy fun, he did not want to leave
His head was between her tits and he could barely breathe
He had to toss, turn, turn, toss
Meanwhile he was riding her with crazy force
She was burning hot, she said "Stop, stop."
He said "Are you talking sex or what?"
I guess she didn't realize what she started
Next thing you knew she was acting retarded
She said to him strangely and kind of merry
"Stop now, or I'll be unable to marry"
He didn't take her warning
He rode her till the morning
He rode that ass till the pussy started yawning
(Yawning sounds)

He said "What? Wait" His dick went weak
It said "Dave, pussies ain't supposed to speak"
He gathered his things he wanted to leave this place
But first he wanted to see the vagina face to face
He opened it up, with his bare two thumbs
He seen crabs with SPEARS AND INDIAN DRUMS!

They's going heya hiya heya hey, hey
Heya hiya heya hey
Heya hey, heya hey
Heya hiya heya hey
Heya hiya heya hey
[Ricky Walters]
Ladies, and gentlemen... and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure
That we are here to present tonight...
Slick Rick, the Ruler! And MC Ricky D!!
Doing their smash hit, "Mona Lisa,"
You know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out
To bow before his divine majesty

[Ricky] Oh your majesty...
[Slick] Hmm?
[Ricky] Can I kiss your hand?
[Slick] Mm-hmm
[Ricky] (kisses his hand loudly)
[Slick] Enough!
[Ricky] Come your highness.. they await you..

[Slick Rick]
Well, it was one of those days -- not much to do
I was chillin downtown, with my old school crew
I went into a store -- to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona -- what?
Mona Lisa (what?) *singing* Mona Lisa, so men made you..
YouknowhatI'msayin? So I said, "Excuse me, dear
My gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money
I'll buy that slice!"
She said, "Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you"
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (PING!) I almost blinded her
She said, "Great Scott! Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth"
Ha-ha, hah! Had to find that funny
So I said, "No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief? Please! Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet"
She almost got cut short -- you know, scissors
She tried to disrespect WHO?! The Grand Wizard
Me! "Well what's your name, son?"
"MC Ricky D," but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
"I'm.. sorry and I know that's low class (uhh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past"
She said, "Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin"
A virgin?! Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin -- with her yea wide gap
I said, "It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky:
R -- Ravishing
I -- Impress
C -- Courageous; so careless
K -- for the Kangols which I've got
That I wear everyday and
Y -- why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm..
Quite polite like Walter Cronkite"
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, "Hey Rick, don't you know playin with these snakes is a sin?!?"
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, "I don't want to see you playin with these lowlifes no more!
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of her friends"
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it!
And as we were leavin and drivin along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song

(excerpt from "Walk On By" [D. Warwick])
"If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry.. each time we meet..
Walk on by.. walk on by..
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide
The pain and the hurt that you gave me
When you said goodbye..
You walked on by.."
[Hook]
With so much drama in the industry, hip-hop police are listening
Be careful or you'll be history, looks like another unsolved mystery
It's murder! (Murder, murder)
Ahhh, it's murder! (Murder, murder)
Yeahh it's murder! (Murder, murder)
Somebody tell em it's murder
Murder was the case - and they blamed me

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Officer I didn't do it, you can't blame me for this
Could you please loosen up the handcuffs on my wrists?
You can call me what you wanna man but I ain't a snitch
No cooperation is exactly what you will get
'Til I talk til my lawyer, you get no reply
You've obviously been watching too much CSI
I'm not a crash dummy so don't even try
To talk your dirty trash to me, no BFI
If you are not guilty of anything, then why did you run?
Cause you the police! And plus I saw you cocking your gun
And the chamber wasn't empty, it was obviously one
If you think I'm believing that one then you're obviously dumb
I know that you heard the sirens, you dived in
To the vehicle you was driving and riding in
Instead you shouldn't be whining, but abiding
By the law, naw, it's obvious that you're lying

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Stop lying to me boy, it'd be best you confess
I can smell the BS on the scent of your breath
Saw the meth while I was inspecting your deck
Saw that you was ridin' dirty when I looked at the rest
Who is this guy Busta? Who is this guy Snoop?
Who is his other friend who's wearing the sky blue?
Look at this pic here, he standing beside you
Tell me his name now, I heard he was Piru
Confiscated the CD's at one of your homes
For evidence ever since we heard some of your songs
What about this Pimp guy, he was on one of your songs
I could've sworn that he said he had a "Pocket Full of Stones"
Am I wrong?
Hell yeah! I don't know who that is!
I don't know no Pimp C, all I know is I'm rich
And I'mma Bond like James, bet I be out here quick man
You ain't getting out of here, you must think that you're slick
In the car we confiscated the chronic and the clips
Diary that you had and all your blueprints
On the Death Row booklet, we found your two prints
Your thumb and your index, the judge will love this

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Now you can see you're screwed as the evidence pours in
The witness said the crime was at three in the morning
Gave us a description so we picked up your boy and
You'll get a lighter sentence if you put the crime on him

[Verse 3: Slick Rick]
A big celebrity, a case we long for
You a pirate - why you got that eyepatch on for?
Funny
Putting people in a hearse what I heard for
Where were you the night of April 21st son?
Home
I think you got your facts wrong, gat's onYou, Chamillionaire, robbed, shot a couple cats on Melview
What?
We gonna have to jail you too
In the lineup, don't speak until we tell you to
This the person who jimmied your lock, sir?
Well it's dark, kinda look like him, I'm not sure
Failure to nail cause assailant's another (uh-huh)
Believe I see an unmarked tailing a brother
Hit the bodega, not no more game
This chick used to be nice acting all strange
Like she was gonna get it, pathetic
Assailant caught, now they all apologetic

[Hook]
Well I shot some there, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in West Bubblefuck somewhere
Due to raps wider ratio, satellites to Nato
Hillbilly draws flew on the stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately wife piece back in New York
And I'm starvin
Being human and open with
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scoping Rick
Thought entered how to lean and bent it
Though I'm not gonna lie I was extremely tempted
(To what, Rick?) To discharge in a sista
Next thing in the dressing room, "Pardon me, mister"
Yes, I said cautiously
"Crazy, but possibly
You could sign your name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me"
Try to resist, now girlfriend startin' it
The pen won't write, "You can press down hard on it" -
Now my hand browsing her South end
Spun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when
Rring! - Loosen the grip my hell had
My girl, she was talking so nice I felt bad
Being untrue, no telling what it might do to her
"I love you", forced to say I love you back too to her
Any thought of getting pussy was doomed to:"You got a wife?"
Anniversary comin up soon too
Got off the phone, cock just got mute
Don't get me wrong it's not like you're not cute (Uh-huh)
I'm wrong for mistreating her, the wanting to skeeting her
"I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya"
What an angel overcoming his wrongness
The moral I am trying to get across in this song is

[Hook]
If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid

Casually seating with some thick chords eating
With my album playing at a big board meeting
"I love this", being the coolest and the ruffest
A big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office
And fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went
Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment -
Pounding was inevitable
She said to me "Rick, I think your album is incredible"
The way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I
"You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye"
Well I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya
Means a lot to me, coming from a woman of your stature
I mean, who could resist the Don head?
Start caressing Rick private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull
Girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats the set me emporer
Put one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya
Fantastic, though I start to act drastic
When I see my wedding band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down, she felt that I tried to diss
I'm like, I can't do this as much as I'd like to miss
An angel overcoming his wrong, kids
The point that I am trying to get across in this song is

[Hook]
Check (5X)

Well, let us skip the boring foreplay I'm slidin' right in
This girl over my house who had to be about 19
Ass, hoes in my poster
She's sweatin' although she tried to hold her composure
I hoped she'd take it in the ass and suck dick
(Girl) My my what a nice apartment you got Rick
On her knees about to make her fall
(Girl) "All platinum and gold jammies hangin' on the wall too
You got it goin' on"
Now my mouth start foamin'
The lights dim we're kissin' and my hands start roamin' in her drawers
(Girl) Stop!
Knew she was joking
Cause I ain't even fuck her and her pussy was soaking WET!
Already had her tit out
If I play my cards right, fuck her dig in the hole she shit out
(Girl) Rick I gotta go my girls waitin'
She recaps finally when honey drawers down to her kneecaps
Breathed heavy all mushy bitch
Swore up and down I was gonna fuck her in the pussy
Since friends waitin' on subtle
Bout time to make a move upon the hungry little butthole
Meanwhile she acted quite passive
Lickin' the hun neck while she lotionin' that ass with jelly
Tit hung out the frame nigga loco
Surprised honey didn't put up too much of a struggle, at first
Sinkin' in she ain't know how to be the bitch went
(Girl) ahh Rick it hurts take it out of me!
Knocked my magazine down, bitch threw my papers
You wanna keep it down I mean I do have neighbors!
Squirmin' away although the table was barrin' her
Felt real good my dick was sunk so far in her
She said it felt like a bulldozer boring her
Sqealing about she couldn't take it anymore in her
My cummed on her straight in the perm in her, (here)
As I drained every last drop of sperm in her (where)

Chorus:

So girls when we kiss and we cuddle, ain't no way to put it subtle
When I want the butt hole!
(Moaning in back round)

Another girl I met, her experience vast because
Most girls with kids done been hit in their ass before
Picked her up sunset
(Girl) Don't be late for dinner, ma
Bringing honey home from the date at the cinema
Thinking how to fuck the ass so plottin'
Blown in the elevator, hit the stop button
She smiled, by knowing her butt I wanna bore
I said "Can I have a kiss now instead of in front of your front door"
(kissing/sex in the back round) (Uhhhmmm!! Oh yeah!)
Although The Ruler tried not to push hard
I'm all over the bitch like an octopus
Deep down I know she also wanna fuck
Though I kept my tongue in her mouth so not to put her on the spot
To have to talk no shit to prevent me from bonin'
Unzap the bra, when the hooker start moanin and
Expose my espresso suck on her and lick on her
Unbucklin' pulling out mad long dick on her
Panties in the way of that, but I want to check it out
Slipped her wet drawers down her thigh and took her leg out
Her butt was juicy kinda fat
Spun around start to stick her in the pussy from the back
She came, mad juice dripped out
Still in the pussy then acted like it slipped out
Cum on the floor, She said "Pardon the puddle"
Spread open her cheeks, pushed hard in her butt hole
Uhhhmmm, wasn't a bad date at all, she went AHHHH AHHHH
Start pullin' at my balls while I'm still penetratin'
Felt fantastic, she said
(Girl) "Rick I'm not really into this ass kick"
Meanwhile Rick cummin' by the gallon
Put your hands on the wall please
And try and keep your balance
Lickin' the grill in her, meanwhile fillin' her
Till sperm start pourin' out her butt hole while I'm still in her
Then start rammin' the pine in her
I almost picked her up with these final grinds in her

Chorus:

So girls when we kiss and we cuddle
Ain't no way to put it subtle when I want the butthole!

(Moaning)
Girl: My ass, more, more, more!
Artist: Slick Rick
Album: Behind Bars
Song: All Alone (No One to Be With)

As a youth, each Sunday, Dawn went to Church and
Paid her respects and not to mention was a virgin
Kid pushed up, Dawn lettin' him
Since he made her laugh and all the other girls was sweatin' him
Then things started to move without cause
And a couple o'months later kid's pushin' for the drawers
Under pressure while exchangin' glances
Dawn finally gives in to the sexual advances
Although it was a mad high cost for her
Cuz' after the thrill was gone, so was the lust for her
Eventually he left her for another
Now feeling alone and betrayed by her lover
She cried--for no longer knew which way she headed
Once dreamed of actually wearing white at her wedding
And really being pure, now she thought she'd die without
Still she finds strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Without love...
Without love...
Without love...

Verse two of Dawn's life--the second segment
What could be worse than to now find out you're pregnant?
Poor Dawn couldn't sleep--laid awake
Not ready for a child and plus her mother's gonna break
As she doesn't know how she's gonna bring up the subject
Consequences of being used as an object
In church though time's runnin' thin
She decides to have the child because the doesn't want to sin
Props to the girl although it hit hard times;
It was Hell finishin' school and working part-time
Yet Dawn did it though her youth went to waste
Little help from the government, she got her own place
HARD for an indepentant woman and a kid
And as soon as she could get off the assistance, she did
Without no man who she once thought she'd die without
Still she finds the strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Continue with her life without love...

While Dawn worked two jobs tryin' to meet ends
Her son was busy cuttin' school and hangin' with his friends
So when she got words she tried to slap out the taste in his mouth
And explain how important education is
Under stress, she takes two Bufferin
Son now tired of seein' his poor mother sufferin'
Starts to sell drugs though the cops did a raid
Guess who's in the mix, and being legal age
Could do time, please call her employer
To inform her that her son is gonna' need a lawyer
Never no good news, just more strife
Dawn barely havin' enough time to live her own life
Here's the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'
Now spends nine hours on the bus to go and see him
Here's the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'
Now spends nine hours on the bus to goa nd see him
Without no man who she once thought she'd die without
Still she finds the strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Continues life without love...
[Intro]
So you get my point son, you just don't trust no bitch
You know what I'm sayin? (Okay, daddy, I understand you)
Cause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin?
(Okay, I get your point) Anyway, listen to this, check it out

[Verse 1]
1994, as the world gets trifer
I'm wondering, fuck I need a woman in my life for?
Ya know, cause it's like a nigga whole history
With you hoes been nothing but misery
First rater, five-one stood
Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good
Met her at the fever, "What's going on, stranger?"
And like a fool took her in and tried to change her
I don't who I thought I's bluffing
That bitch wasn't giving up that coke for nothing
"Oh you tryna dis, mister bougeois nigga
Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too
That type shit you ain't admitting"
Because, homegirl, I grew outta it, you didn't
Anyway, dead outta order
Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her
Who gave you that? "My ex" I said "Who?"
Believe she had the nerve to say "You can wear it too"
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new

[Hook]
Someone who would be true
Yes, I should find someone who would be true
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true, true
Oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo..

[Verse 2]
Then I met Sin, sweating the viking
A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like 'em
"What? Sweating you? Picture that, nerd.. please"
Anyway, the bitch had herpes!
You know, imagine me, the fool being the spouse
Doctor said I couldn't catch it 'less I got aroused
Found out snooping in her bag what she got
Now why you ain't tell me? You worthless slut!
"Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to"
You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying
Anyway, stayed with the creep
One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep
"Chris, wait," the bum bitch said
So loud 'til a mothafucka fell out the bed
Who the hell is Chris? She putting up resistance
'til I caught her calling the nigga long distance
Had the nerve to dis patch loving
Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new

[Hook]
Someone who would be true
Yes, I should find someone who would be true
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true, true, true
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo
Oh gosh, Scooby Dooby Doo

[Verse 3]
Though happy I was free, the need for love was still in me
Got to the point where the need for it was killing me
Then I met shorty here, hanging with my cousin
Found out later how young the bitch was and
Though I done hit it and she opened up a world
And remind me of that song "Go Away, Little Girl"
It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled
"That's because I had you pussy whipped royal"
You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?
You see the type of attitude the bum bitch carry?
Like oil and water, impossible mixture
Then temper tantrums came into the picture
Yelling, carrying on bad and cursing
Complete embarassment to the Ruler as a person
"Gimme shorts" Ruler will not permit you
Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture
Flirts too, excuse me, a whore
Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour
So when I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new

[Hook]
[Verse 1: Mos Def]
The way I feel, sometimes it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face but it's really no joke
You feel it in the streets, people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down their focus
The focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes you don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep
And it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral of a shell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Soul is the lions roar, voice is the siren
I swing round, ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckas trying to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well

[Hook]
What it is, you know, they know
What it is, we know, y'all know
What it is, Ecstatic, there it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is

And always on time and rockin ya mind

[Verse 2: Slick Rick]
Sit and come relax, riddle off the mac
It's the patch, I'm a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well say about noonish, comin' out the whip
And lookin at me curious, a young Iraqi kid
Carrying laundry, "What's wrong G? Hungry?"
"No, gimme my oil or get [fuck] out my country"
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff
'til his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, feeling like I've pissed upon wound
I'm like, "Surely hope that we can fix our differences soon!" Bye!
Buying apples I'm breakin' on
You take everything, why not just take the damn food, black monster? Like I don't understand it, on another planet
15 month of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasing the sentiment, gentlemen
Getting down on their middle eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crowd
Walk over kicked one of my fabulous raps (la dee da dee)
Arab jaw drop, they well wish, they glad rap
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad

[Sample]
Omar: Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries
Ali: They sent you?
Omar: Yeah, so? Here

[Hook]
"This type of shit that happens every day" 8x

[Slick Rick]
In the slammer kid but I'm innocent
Lord played witty wasn't having any pity
Now in Razor Blade City
Cry suppose the situation seen mad eyes of foes
Drives a Rolls, hey, yo, money, what size are those?
Need to phone me til another sprang up, hmm, to gang up
On the skid, housing the phone like he didn't know how to hang up
Would be hard though ought a minute or so and then yells time on a
And when you get your commisary, buy this and that or else I'm gonna
Be on that ass and won't stay off, extort, fig I say, way off
Beaten death, you ain't protecting me, forgot today's my day off
Hold my head and drift the Sumo weigh in knots and cars
Instead of sitting here accumulating cuts and scars, behind bars

Behind bars
Behind bars
Behind bars
Behind bars
Behind bars

[Slick Rick]
Showing off cuz on the phone, click, losing all the hoes off
Niggas housed the watch and Donna took all of the clothes off
Nigga hell with the was for my clothes figured telling
Every night it seem like mice be in and out a nigga cell and
Still ain't home, like on the hook, seen a bunch of kids look
Miss outdoors, never know what you have until it's tooken
And in fact, the moment you fear, all of that, you quote snaps
Well in a cell, did the exercises and wrote raps
I be a bigger star than you, no never heard of the nigga
Takes my raps and read aloud, I want to murder the migga
Just kidding, no offend to it, finally he ended it
Case dismissed, but your honor, DA kindly prevented it
He told to the judge, don't free him, this brother trigger wars
And not just that because I refuse to wash some jive nigga doors
So hold the head, drift the Sumo weight in knots and cars
Instead of sitting here accumulating cuts and scars

Behind bars
Behind bars
Behind bars

[Slick Rick]
One fight, the nigga trip, C.O. the rest he might scared
By couldn't squeal, I's like officer that nigga right there
Now if he ain't get me his friends will, needed a utensil
It turn out, I had to stab him in the eye wit a pencil
State of shock, he made a yell, I said, now what you want traitor
C.O. puts me in the bin, I see ya about a month later
Back in population, didn't matter that his friends tensed
The phone prints, the years added to the sentence
Still chilling and all of that and I escaped
When the damn thing sold, don't hit the stove cause they made a rape attempt
Thank goodness, failed, call out next, he wail out
Here go the C.O., Ricky Walters, back up, bailed out
The C.O. couldn't see the rape, the kid'll snitch mass figure
Fast trigger, you'll be back, you little bitch ass nigga
Au Revoir, back to dating sluts and stars
At least for now, no more accumulating cuts and scars

Behind bars

Dum ditty dum ditty ditty datty day

Take some punk locked up to get beat down
Ripped down to his boots is broke down
Dum ditty dum ditty ditty datty day
This type of shit happens every day
Riots, malay and disturbances of the peace

[Warren G]
Mister Slick Rick let me take it for a second
And tell a short tale about the LA county jail
9500 that was the lock up
When the lights got dim, it was time for the sock up
Jacking for the money, backstab was my mission
If a riot jumped out, it's time for incision
Sticking niggas here and sticking niggas there
I turn around and look and seen cops everywhere
Jacking brothers up, slapping brothers up
If you got blood on your clothes, lock up
High powered was the level, level fo'
Niggas sentenced to life and you can't be no ho (bitch)
Or you can't tooken wit homies overlooken
As safe next door wit the puma straight cooking
Lighten up the whole module, hm
Godamn, yea, anothe squabble

[Hook]

[Intro]
Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?
Please, huh, please?
Alright, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook
Y'all tucked in?

[Verse 1]
Here we go
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought ta good
There lived a lil' boy who was misled
By another lil' boy and this is what he said:
"Me and you, Ty, we gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash"
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said "Keep still, boy, no need for static"
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said "Why did ya hit me?"
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
"I'll do years if I pull this trigga"
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radioes it to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked around good and from expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said "I need bullets, hurry up, run!"
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead
He told the cops "Back off or honey here's dead"
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
He dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
Straight 'n narrow or yo' soul gets cast

[Outro]
1: Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird
2: I know right what does he mean by
“Straight ‘n narrow or yo’ soul gets cast"
1: I don’t know, I think he be crackin' it up or something
2: Well, goodnight
1: Goodnight
Only the single version features the slick rick verse, it was cut from the album

[Verse One: Big Boi]
Yea..
Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, cause she screwed a lot
Makin a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya playa, I'm dickin the ho down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer eight-hundred-forty
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearin a real tight skirt
She was, fine as FUCK, I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too."
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster
It's like that now

It's like that now, you better go on
And get, the hump, up out your back now
It's about four, or five, cats
Off in my 'Llac now
We just, shoot, game in the
Form of story rap now (yeah)
It's like that now, it's like that now

[Verse Two: Andre 3000]
Now Suzy Skrew had a partna named Sasha (Sasha), Thumper (Thumper)
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber - - party
But you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawnin dancin under street lights
We chillin like a villain and a nigga feelin right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back starin at the stars above
(aww man) Talkin bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said what you wanna be, she said, "Alive" (hmm)
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find lil Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treatin her wrong
I kept on singin my song and hopin at a show
That I would one day see her standin in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper

It's like that now, you better go on
And get, the hump, up out your back now
[Slick Rick] Yes... (Uncle Ricky!!)
It's about four, or five, cats
Off in my 'Llac now
[Slick Rick] Yes... (Could you tell a story?)
We just, shoot, game in the
Form of story rap now (yeah)
[Slick Rick] (Pleeeeeease?) Uh-huh
It's like that now, it's like that now
[Slick Rick] Herrrrrre we go...

[Verse Three: Slick Rick]
Throwing things, yelling in a mad high pitch
Here we go again with this psychopath bitch
The neighbors will hear you, you misfit
Can't disagree with the bitch without this shit
The price we pay to fuck women
The most pretty bitch got the psycho shit within them
Stuck up, as soon as I pop up
But see me with the next she wanna tear the fucking club up
Check her pants, a number confirming
Learned more and more, they're just shit to dump sperm in
And you know, probably get cussed if I backslap Miss
While she busy trying to justify who cheated first
"Rick what would I want
With this small chain wearin muh-fucka trying to front?"
I oughta cut her off, let another sooth me
But I don't know, ordinary bitch don't move me
I mean, I tried to fall in love with a bittie
But straight up, just be with the bitch out of pity
So although I know, pretty bitch shady
Here I go, trying to change a ho into a lady
Knahmean?

It's like that now, you better go on
And get, the hump, up out your back now
[Slick Rick] Yes
It's about four, or five, cats
Off in my 'Llac now
[Slick Rick] Yes
We just, shoot, game in the
Form of story rap now (yeah)
[Slick Rick] Uh-huh
It's like that now, it's like that now

It's like that now, you better go on
And get, the hump, up out your back now
[Slick Rick] Yes
It's about four, or five, cats
Off in my 'Llac now
[Slick Rick] Yes
We just, shoot, game in the
Form of story rap now (yeah)
[Slick Rick] Uh-huh
It's like that now, it's like that now

It's like that now, you better go on
And get, the hump, up out your back now
[Slick Rick] Yes
It's about four, or five, cats
Off in my 'Llac now
[Slick Rick] Yes
We just, shoot, game in the
Form of story rap now ...

[Slick Rick]

Rocks look chunky on the index
Straight up, Lee vets and like old Adidas sweats
We the the illest vets

[Slick Rick]
Apologies, even a non-dog holler "he's honor"
Please, appreciate shit I clog Wallabee's
Brothas wit they fists like oaks wood
Provokes doom, and you're also about to go broke soon

[Raekwon]
Mad current merchants, we nursed it
Bad guerillas, feed us like guaranteed they gon' kill us
Fleeing, ninety in a night suit, G-ing white dudes
Hit the locks first, we made a right troop

[Slick Rick]
I'm lushin Russian women, via satelite I'm watchin
I dare a nigga say he wanna battle me, I'll crush ya
Even blind girls rush next to Hammera and scream out
"Oh my gosh, get the camera"

Chorus[Raekwon]
Yo we frozen, lay on the bount now, we a day on
Ill niggas yellin "Throw Rick and Rae on"
Hydro, how did I blow, how did I flow
Did I glow, let them niggas know

[Slick Rick]
(Yo)
Rap wars commence and they kids cause offense
I don't have to say a word and your bitch-drawers are drenched
Didn't say I was gonna murder the fella
But The Ruler got some shit the could stop a herd of gorillas

[Raekwon]
Stressed wit Hollywood hoes, actin up
Backin up, what? This yours, what?
Crawlin in the cut, we lee major
Gems on wit Timbs, brims on drawn to lay you up
Layin in the day wit what?

[Slick Rick]
Next pull up CEO wit bank books full up
Even though he's overwhelmed, this nigga Rolls Royce pull up
One of the baddest come, noddin to a Spanish song
Slung, orange woolridge park and a Savannah pump

[Raekwon]
Severe teaspoons, scary money on the moon
Lampin wit a big goon, keep shit tight like a kid's room
Big Bird in the driveway, bullet out Friday
I'm liver that way, I ride only the fly way
Olive-green thinkin, ship sinkin
Deep-dish thinkin, big fish tank, wrist full of Franklins
This mock-neck, shark-skin money
Eighty-eight, summer reader dun ?dummeries?
Rock dungarees

[Slick Rick]
Punctures his lung, son says "I don't want this"
Even this so-so beat I make monstrous
Lady cops stake to watch pair hoods
"Freeze, you're under arrest, you look mad good"
Hot and don't fret retard who won't let the new sherifs in town
What part you don't get?
Rick and Rae, and now restoring the passion
The fashion, the class, I went to work on your ass

Chorus 2x
[Slick Rick]
Yeah bartender can I get a Hennesy on the rocks
And a Long Island Ice Tea?
Thank you
Didn't I tell you this club was dope?
Yeah you wasn't lying kid it definitely is
Look at this they all over the place
Yeah one second hun, slow down, slow
Yo James get her off me
Yo back off shorty
Alright would you slow the hell down?
Back off shorty

[Slick Rick]
Like everyone was chasing my fine ass
But when Aaliyah walked in the whole place went bananas
I'm playing for most of my perks
And they offering the hun free Cristal the works
Not to mention smelled good, looked dope
I brought me a bottle so I wouldn't look broke
Stepped like a Big Willie Woodgewell playa
Sign this thousand dollar bill for me Aaliyah

[Aaliyah]
I used to go out to parties and stand around
Cause I was too nervous to really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I went off on the floor so somebody would choose me
No more standing upside the wall
Now I got myself together baby and I'm having a ball
Long as your grooving there's always a chance
Somebody watching might wanna make romance
Move your body, ooh baby, and dance all night
To the grooving, feel all right
Move your body, oh and move your feet
Cause the DJ's groovin', oh and it sounds so sweet, come on
Baby just party on and on
Cause this party is jumpin' till the break of dawn, oh

[Slick Rick]
Well I peeled off one more thousand and hand her
One more please from my girlfriend Amanda
Rick, honey with that butt like ka-pow wanna but you a drink
Tell shorty not now

[Aaliyah]
You can have me when you want me baby
This is such a live party baby
Going crazy in this place tonight
And the feeling is oh so right, yeah
All the fellas in here are so fine, oh
When you're moving your body
Boy you're blowing my mind
I think I'm gonna let you do it baby

[Slick Rick]
One more comment since my time is out
Love that song where you say that line about
'You're a positive motivating force within my life'
No kidding, hit 'em
Named ruler and the ruler wouldn't lie to ya
Whack singing huns all squirm at the sight of ya
Us, we some more Ladi Dadi'ens
Let me let you go so you can attend to your audience

[Aaliyah]
Sexy baby, sexy baby, sexy baby, sexy baby
Sexy baby, sexy baby, sexy baby, sexy baby, baby
Oh, oh baby, oh yeah, ooh
Guess who's back (3X)

Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld

[Verse 1]

This rap here... it may cause concern it's
Broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
Love mean happiness... that once was strong
But due to society... even that's turned wrong
Times have changed... and it's cool to look bummy
And be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten... who put you on this Earth?
Who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid goin wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company... hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non cool... your life, don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead... and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves... hey they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hardrocks too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too
And this is a message... that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

"You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party"
(repeat 3X)

Hey young world, the world is yours
Hey young world

"Yo peep this"

[Verse 2]

Hey Mr. Bigshot... hey, don't you look fly?
But you don't have a nickle... ohhhh, my my my
You've been fightin again and, you forgot why
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.... because you make your family cry
And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
Hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
Steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some dust, and
Plus, a must say... bigshot you're not
Your friends are talkin and I'm hearin that your girls are what?
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
And while you're at it... go get a suit for a j-awhh-ob
You see you're actin like this urge is demanding
C'mon, wake up... have some understanding
Society's a weak excuse for a man
It's time for the brothers... rap is trying to take the stand
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you, he
Guides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus
Past the age of... a little child, that's true
But folks your age don't act like you do, so
So be mature... and put the point to a halt
And if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult
Don't live in a world... of hate hate hate
Pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
Men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
And if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
So be more mature... and kids do your chores
Make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
You know why, cause that's a man... that's brains no spite
Stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
And a man never loses a fight... in God's sight
Cause righteous laws are overdue
And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

"You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party"
(repeat 3X)

Hey young world, the world is yours
Hey young world...

"Yo peep this...
MC... Ricky... D...
The Grand Wizzard...
And his partner...
And his and his and his partner...
Say what?
La-Di! Da-Di! La-Di! Da-Di! (repeat 2X)
La-Di-Da-Di..."
[Hook]
With so much drama in the industry, hip-hop police are listening
Be careful or you'll be history, looks like another unsolved mystery
It's murder! (Murder, murder)
Ahhh, it's murder! (Murder, murder)
Yeahh it's murder! (Murder, murder)
Somebody tell em it's murder
Murder was the case - and they blamed me

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Officer I didn't do it, you can't blame me for this
Could you please loosen up the handcuffs on my wrists?
You can call me what you wanna man but I ain't a snitch
No cooperation is exactly what you will get
'Til I talk til my lawyer, you get no reply
You've obviously been watching too much CSI
I'm not a crash dummy so don't even try
To talk your dirty trash to me, no BFI
If you are not guilty of anything, then why did you run?
Cause you the police! And plus I saw you cocking your gun
And the chamber wasn't empty, it was obviously one
If you think I'm believing that one then you're obviously dumb
I know that you heard the sirens, you dived in
To the vehicle you was driving and riding in
Instead you shouldn't be whining, but abiding
By the law, naw, it's obvious that you're lying

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Stop lying to me boy, it'd be best you confess
I can smell the BS on the scent of your breath
Saw the meth while I was inspecting your deck
Saw that you was ridin' dirty when I looked at the rest
Who is this guy Busta? Who is this guy Snoop?
Who is his other friend who's wearing the sky blue?
Look at this pic here, he standing beside you
Tell me his name now, I heard he was Piru
Confiscated the CD's at one of your homes
For evidence ever since we heard some of your songs
What about this Pimp guy, he was on one of your songs
I could've sworn that he said he had a "Pocket Full of Stones"
Am I wrong?
Hell yeah! I don't know who that is!
I don't know no Pimp C, all I know is I'm rich
And I'mma Bond like James, bet I be out here quick man
You ain't getting out of here, you must think that you're slick
In the car we confiscated the chronic and the clips
Diary that you had and all your blueprints
On the Death Row booklet, we found your two prints
Your thumb and your index, the judge will love this

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Now you can see you're screwed as the evidence pours in
The witness said the crime was at three in the morning
Gave us a description so we picked up your boy and
You'll get a lighter sentence if you put the crime on him

[Verse 3: Slick Rick]
A big celebrity, a case we long for
You a pirate - why you got that eyepatch on for?
Funny
Putting people in a hearse what I heard for
Where were you the night of April 21st son?
Home
I think you got your facts wrong, gat's onYou, Chamillionaire, robbed, shot a couple cats on Melview
What?
We gonna have to jail you too
In the lineup, don't speak until we tell you to
This the person who jimmied your lock, sir?
Well it's dark, kinda look like him, I'm not sure
Failure to nail cause assailant's another (uh-huh)
Believe I see an unmarked tailing a brother
Hit the bodega, not no more game
This chick used to be nice acting all strange
Like she was gonna get it, pathetic
Assailant caught, now they all apologetic

[Hook]
(Singing)
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier, yeah
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier

Well he's in Indian Town, and what spots his eye?
A nice looking Indian, and honey looked fly
He had to talk because he just couldn't hack it
She wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket
He trotted over and invented a line
He said "Excuse me, um, do you happen to have the time?"
All was on his mind was sex, sex, sex
So she said "Why do ask? You got your own Timex"
To poor old Dave that line was cold blooded
He felt that her ego was way over flooded
She started to laugh and then she started to say
"I'm sorry some times I do get carried away
I didn't mean to like ill treat you
My name is Running Rabbit and I'm glad to meet you"
He said "I'm Dave, with crazy clout"
"Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about
Yeah, you must be, because you look like a winner
Come to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner"

(Singing)
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier

Well, he met her father, Big Chief Beretti
He said "What's for dinner?"
"Soup and spaghetti"
The dinner was rotten and he swore he's gonna puke it
He never would have took it if he'd known that he had cooked it
Later on they were chilling, in the bedroom
Sitting at the window looking at the moon
Judging from the mood he swore she was hot
He said "Are you in the mood?"
She said "No I'm not"
From what he believes and from what he gets
When a girl says no, he really thinks she means yes
So, he started touching her and coming out strong
Whispering sweet nothings and singing a song
He said
(singing) "I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood, don't mean to be rude
But I'm in the mood for love"
She said "Oh Dave, you've got my poor back hurting
I want you, but first close the curtain"
He closed the curtain and also the doors
The next thing you knew it was off with those drawers

"Take it easy Davy, you're hurting me. Stop"

Well, he was playing with her tits, they were soft not lumpy
And then he cracked the legs like Humpty-Dumpty
He's fucking, sucking, also finger popping
He had, no intention of stopping
Crazy fun, he did not want to leave
His head was between her tits and he could barely breathe
He had to toss, turn, turn, toss
Meanwhile he was riding her with crazy force
She was burning hot, she said "Stop, stop."
He said "Are you talking sex or what?"
I guess she didn't realize what she started
Next thing you knew she was acting retarded
She said to him strangely and kind of merry
"Stop now, or I'll be unable to marry"
He didn't take her warning
He rode her till the morning
He rode that ass till the pussy started yawning
(Yawning sounds)

He said "What? Wait" His dick went weak
It said "Dave, pussies ain't supposed to speak"
He gathered his things he wanted to leave this place
But first he wanted to see the vagina face to face
He opened it up, with his bare two thumbs
He seen crabs with SPEARS AND INDIAN DRUMS!

They's going heya hiya heya hey, hey
Heya hiya heya hey
Heya hey, heya hey
Heya hiya heya hey
Heya hiya heya hey
[Slick Rick]
All of you cock-pullers are frontin
Wave your arms around like your some octopus or somethin
To better ya
For any chick you want, I'm gettin her
Rob people, mad ignorant, et cetera
Who the one to entertain and fume with?
Who you know breed humans can't be in the same room with?
Reefer sweet, wrap it up, free fix greet
Every rapper rap maggot underneath Rick's feet
Evicted -- why you tryin to find shit to lick with?
Even your kids tell you that you ain't shit to Slick Rick
Though you pretend to be glory
I'm number one, that's the end of the story
The black Clark Gable leave you numb
Every single one, frontin on your label is a bum
Let me slow it down, that's enough of that
This I have to say to you, nothing, other rapper cats

Chorus: repeat 2X

From New York to Cali none'll fuck with
The awkward, you think Muhammad Ali used to talk shit?
Bing!  This sure hit alone'll bury ya
And even I got de-ported, I Own America

[Slick Rick]
He's so crazy -- I smash rippin up the place
Give the mack a taste -- I wipe my ass with a rapper face
Cars come to a dead stop
Rain find ways not to drop on my headtop
Tycoon rush at the richest
Even my complexion is a must-have to bitches
Even without, car money to budget
I would have the most elegant apartment in the projects
Knahmean?  Bitches are in awe * at the lingo		* (pronounced OAR)
Know that Rick'll put an end to all rapper income
An old-timer, lock up all vagina fields
France nor Italy can fuck with my designer skills
Saltin inferior, faultin to where we are
Tryin to find fault in superior
Let me slow it down, that's enough of that
This I have to say, to you nothing other rapper cats

Chorus

[Slick Rick]
You lack the taste hook I'm stickin em with
While degenrate like yourself make our race look ignorant (mm)
And your girlfriend wanna kiss and deploy
Bout in the groin gets none of this tenderloin
Feet planted on deep black firmament
Bow -- in the presence of who lead rap permanent
Like a lion rap rips a chunk of kids
You stunk, cause mortals ain't shit to conquer
Somebody said new pharoahes have appeared
How when everything I wore ten years ago you wear now?
I coulda murder heard a word out quick Rick stomp it kid
Hung to it, you complete bum to Rick
Source Awards, yeah Rick every seminar
Even make Sadaam Hussein tell me where the weapon are (mm-hmm)
Let me slow it down, that's enough of that
This I have to say, to you nothing other rapper cats

Chorus
[Over the melody of Slick Rick's song "Lick the Balls"]

[Slick Rick]

Let's go to the crib, get cozy in the nude
And treat me like a prostitute
Now pardon me sir, I'm such a real lady
Ride in Mercedes to make the bitches hate me
Cruise up and down one-two-fifth
Lookin for a guy like you to get with
{*beat changes*}
I seen this cutie pie, so I pulled beside him
Seen the size of his feet, so I couldn't deny him
Might as well try him, the freak that I am
M dot S-E always grindin'

-- Yeah and what's that supposed to mean?
-- Proposition for you Ruler
Procede on
-- Well I got a track I need you spit a mean 16 on
-- You with it?
Down to bless one and I left one
The Hit Factory, later on around eleven
With my notebook, and pencil, I slides on in
I see her lookin mighty sexy and the lights all dim
-- Have a drink
The booze and the karmy go oddly
After havin a drink I start to feel unusually horny
Swellin stone, or well writ poems
Busy poundin like I'm tryin to break off pelvis bones

{*beat changes*}

[Missy - singing]
Please don't think I'm crazy (oooooh)

Let's get it on cause we both grown
[Slick Rick] Recognize, recognize

{*beat changes back*}

[Missy Elliott]
Excuse me sir, oh gosh you look young
But old enough to get it to get yo' head sprung
Sit down relax, it's soft here on my couch
Or give me hands strictly you might get turned out
Cutie pie, 'til I sit beside him
Nice shoe size, how could I deny him
Big bankroll to help me retire
Me and him together smell like big empire
Don't treat me like a prostitute
Unless you're givin me some money makin sure I look cute
But don't treat me like a prostitute
Unless you're givin me some money makin sure I look cute

[Missy - singing]
Please don't think I'm crazy (oooooh)

Is it a custom - to what? To provoke out a hostile apostle
And make him smack the coke out your nostril
BAP, the butter cat at gutter rappin and I'm all man
Whatever gotta happen gotta happen
Boy don't make me put my grown man shoe in you
And I'm sorry father, for any wrongdoing doin you
Cause dogs barkin and the girl sigh
Here to present myself as the sparkle of the world's eye
Picture I - where Spice Girls chick arrived
England, January 14th, six-five
While you scream out "Grannyville
You old ass rapper!" You got it, but can he still
Sever, in other words, rap more clever
Like no other younger rapper walkin could ever?
Apparently I done this, on this
Stunned his behind - out the way of who reign
I RUN THIS

"Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched*
"Run, run, run, r-run" * scratched from Run-D.M.C.*
"Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched*
[Rick] Out the way of who reign, I RUN THIS
"Run.. run, r-run" * scratched from Run-D.M.C.*
[Rick] Stop the world kid, bring it home Slick
"run, r-run" "run, r-run"

[Slick Rick]
Are, you, ready? "run"
The fact is, mack caught cable in an actress
And really is the black Clark Gable of the rap biz
Racists reactin, hastin for action
The motherfucker got exquisite taste for a black man
What you never know? All clothes come off a ho
Ever see me with my jewels and toast from off of Mo'?
*psssh* Past where handsome measures
Like the whole entire Rat Pack, AND some precious
And chartable, such a big spark I pull
Nuns even say, "That motherfucker's remarkable!"
And aliens who came to earth gathering
"Great gosh the man has soul, we must have him"
Like a catastrophe, there isn't none after me
Liz will throw away her walker and run after me
Snatch crowns -- done this, on this
Stunned his behind - out the way of who reign
I RUN THIS

"Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched*
"Run, run, run, r-run" * scratched from Run-D.M.C.*
"Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched*
[Rick] Out the way of who reign, I RUN THIS
"run, r-run" "as we go" "run, r-run"
"run, r-run" "as we go" "run, r-run"
"run, r-run" "as we go" "run, r-run"
"as we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

[Slick Rick]
Up Hastings, crew downfaced and lose
Either one way or the other, foundation choose
Although the prune I kick, I didn't come to wound a sick child
Hit a lost world, actin like a lunatic *blblblblbl*
Who provoke til a heard of smoke
Forced good men to pull out and start to murder folk
Tired of the basement placed in
Take responsibility for your action as a race then
Instead of put cheer in our bone, paperhood promote
Negativity, and fear in our own neighborhood
Since royalty breed to be (uh-huh)
And I puts small seed where small seed need to be
Like an angel tend to fly as, mention I as
I didn't make the laws, but they make sense to my ass
While waiting for the world end, won this
Stunned his behind - out the way of who reign
I RUN THIS

[Rick] See what I mean kid?
"Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched*
[Rick] That patch-eyed motherfucker RUN THIS
"Run, run, run, r-run" * scratched from Run-D.M.C.*
"Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched*

[Slick Rick]
Yeah BABY, Slick Rick
1999, 2000, the whole damn thing kid it's all mine
Go AWAY

"MC" *scratched* "Ricky D" *last syllable scratched to fade*
[Slick Rick]
Well, I'mma tell you a story and I come out bluntly
Born an ugly child; hey, nobody would want me
I used to walk around and get upset and upsetter
Till I figured out ways to make myself look better
As I got older, my awareness expanded
I met this beautiful girl and my wish was commanded
Didn't hang wit fellas cause they started gettin shady
I'd always be wit my girl and ya could call her my lady
I loved her a lot, word up, not going to front, see?
The problem that arose is why on earth did she want me?
Couldn't figure it out, and to make things worst
I was cursed, wit the torment of not being the first
And the first was this fly guy, made me very jealous
Ooh, I think he cheat on me, and talked to other fellas
Two wrongs don't make a right, but any time that we fight
I would call and took a phone and call a girl outta spite
I shouldn't have done it

[Hook 2X: scratched up]
I'm feelin sad and blue

[Slick Rick]
I will to make this right, so director was admirin
I tried to stop my love, but no love was not retirin
To catcher in the rye was near impossible and tricky
Didn't want her in certain clothes, gettin really picky
We got into it again, this time she got to bright
So me preventin a fight, I just stayed out for the night
I had to ease up of the record, all this hot increase
I went up to the parrot, wit a mega vance in vain
This girl came over, she was trucked down extensive
Startin talkin to me, and she was probably quite aggresive
A pretty young thing, she didn't strike me as no ho
So meet my nigga, rude and went on wit the flow
But Joe was gettin hard, without me even knowin
We stepped up back to my van and I could it's for growin
The girl took off her coat her body was no joke
Well, I rubbed it to unzip it, and I went for broke
I shouldn't have done it

[Hook 4X: scratched up]

[Slick Rick]
Now I'm seein, that there's no one to blame
That night when I went home, I felt real guilty and ashamed
Snucked right into bed, I felt just like a shady fella
What made me so unsensitive, how I'm ever gonna tell her?
Shouldn't have cheated, just because we'd always doubt
Endurance, be a man, that's what I had to learn about
How me, I guess I like the wanted secrets that I did
I figure, I'd patch things up and then I'll tell what I did
Then after that, she started actin heaven sent
I found a house spot, let's say she help out wit the rent
So, I bought the ring, it was a good 20 Karat
Then word got back about me chillin at the parrot
So when I got home, I thought she'd just be out to roast
Instead I found this letter, and I found her overdosed
It said "I had it for you" but I guess she didn't care
All this wouldn't happen come of me and this fear
I shouldn't have done it

[Hook to fade]
Yeah, this one goes out to all them Moet clickers, knahmsayin?
From the old school, no, not the Crisal group
It's the Moet click, yaknahmsayin?
Sometimes the lesson I'm still holdin, yaknowhatImean?
Here it go.. are you..?

Dimes trash about, beg Rick ask them out
Moet click -- back in the house kid, ask about
In a vehicle not proud of, hi shouter and
Marvel at the cars that the one I got outta
Dismantle all vandal who cannot hold a candle near
I outglitter the chandelier
Bougie [niggas] talk and glance at enhance
Who makes every [nigga] walkin dance
Plus the clothes you saw me gorgeous bout
Would make a homosexual ask where I bought that outfit
No question, I answered all gangsters and
Paralyzed moves like professional dancers and
So go West, we a family skunk of rap hits
To snap out of you that divide and conquer crap
Pass the bubbly - to the good guy starter
Rap style keep you in a good high bark, I sparkle

And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle

Glitter enter, even the stars in the million
And even the sun be like, "That kid over there brilliant"
Knew this isn't new deficit, all figure ripped
When I'm in the club, mad noise, at who the nigga is
Entertainment, alter, baldhead slaughter
And Moet sparks curse, hi my name Rick Walter and
About to offer lead to drop another muffin
Even dead folks nowadays hoppin out a coffin
What's one to do, goin to do, blunted too
Son to who conduct the whole world if wanted to
Who assault viking, when he touch like lightning and
Everybody know me, walk in sparkling
The co-sponsor, although I sworn all out
And don't doubt it if you see me in some cornball outfit
Pass the champagne to good guy start
Rap style keep you in a good high bark, I sparkle

And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle

Brother arouser, a chaffeur of dause propped
Against stars bright, so stay over my housetop
Even little kids give up their milk and cookie to
The bartender open off Rick and start lookin to
A trailer full of women lovin the rhythm, I'm givin
And skin -- for what Rick -- for artiller within em
So let me explain it, famous, same
You know that the legendary reign this game kid
Massage and awaken who start to it
Old folk drop teeth breakin so hard to it
That's Rick, so any drunk like a glad kid
Do that little dance where you spin round a tad bit
All battlin done, just one hunch and I'll
Fight punch you all, all you fans dysfunctional
So pass the bubbly - to the good guy starter
Rap style keep you in a good high bark, I sparkle

And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle

And move the middle
And move the middle

And move the middle

Uhh, Once upon a time, let's see if I remember
Back in January
Nah, chill.....it was December
True...cuz that's when L started his bid
Partied through the New Year
January third he slid
Up until then, yo, L had it swell
Called him Sweet Pea like his name was Pernell
He did the job, money came with ease
Blowing outta town, moving bricks and ki's
Him and his bitch, in forty-G rides
Holding down fort like they Bonnie N Clyde
Luxury cars of all makes and models
New outfits everyday, downin' champagne by the bottle
Glass in the air (air)
Toast to my team (team)
Toast to my cream and the scotties that beam
My niggas fiend, I'm abouts da beamer
Think about your bitch cuz yo fuck it I'm a dreamer
Called up CRU
Yo, they probably in the studio
Phil Collins in the background
(Su-Su-Sudio)

Chorus: repeat 3X

Now this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path

(Where's my chick?) Sent her on a mission
Hope she ain't slip...on that pickup
Yo, who dis on my flip
Fuck the cash nigga, pistol whip ya ass
Me and Mitch rollin' over there quick fast
Rolled up on the spot, (It's that kid Uzi Ed)
He took me for my paper so just call him Uzi Dead!
Used to run epps wit him back in the day
Mitch popped the trunk
Passed the German AK
You dirty rat! I'm bout to bless the gat
Better take cover from the ratta-tat-tat
Uzi Ed, ain't have a vest, three to the chest, Ed got blessed
L got life, Ed got death
The bitch took the money and she slid to the left
Back in the day I told L she was shady
Now she in Cali about to have Ed's baby

Chorus: repeat 5X

Now this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path

(Slick Rick)
Yo, what's the word, kid?!
Tell you bout a brother named Sid
Got work release after doing a 3-to-life bid
Cause of drug logic
Shouldn't touch it
Now out to budget
With a movie star chick from outta Edenwald Projects
Nice job, took prison camp drives
While he promised up and down to live a civilized lifestyle
The sweat off the brow was soon on garment
Both worked
Got themselves a two-bedroom apartment
Great statement, without delayment, away and went
Saved to get a house on one of them low down payments
But an idea concocted his stock
Why don't we try and turn this money over on the drug tip
So he gave his man a shriek and excitement
Didn't know his peeps were under secret indictment
Sick of the path that'll get you hung by the neck
Sent him back up north to do a super long stretch again
Black folk, you know the half, don't laugh, it's...

Just another case about the wrong path

Chorus: repeat 4X

Well, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
It's just another case about the wrong path
