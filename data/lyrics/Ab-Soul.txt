[Intro]
Acid Rap!

[Hook x2]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Who smokin in my car?, it's that nigga Chano
AKA Mr. Bennett AK Tony Montano
I've got some folks in low end I got some folks in c-note
AK hundred dinero, you ever seen Casino?
I just got back with 'Bino I got a bitch but she know
Her friends done did the Dino, that's that Chicago lingo
Flamin' hots with Cheese, and a kiwi Mistic
My dick won't even call her, cause she left all that lipstick
Niggas be on dirt, that's why I stay on petty
I know that bangers jam, that's why my hands stay ready
Flip the candy yum, that's the fucking bombest
Lean all on the square, that's a fuckin' rhombus

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Who's sneaking in the club?, that's that young Sir Rapper
Un-saran wrap the purple, wrap that blunt under after
Smoke all out the window, cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter, you just might be the lick
Flame on, flame on I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps, but better when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch drugs while on the clock
Acid on the face that's a work of art

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Soulo ho ho twerk somethin', throw it back like you tryna hurt somethin'
I'm so def, I ain't ever heard nothin', my name herb, take herb, smoke herb (say word?)
How 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two
No doubt like Gwen Stefani's group, let me put my mouth where you potty, boo
(IGH!)
Them niggas pissed, need potty training, they movement shit, that's a potty train
She ain't left yet, but she probably came we kicked it then I score, soccer game
She was a phony goalie, I got great aim though, don't insult me
I'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me
My name Solo cause I'm the one and only
She only got you as a nigga on the side, that's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie
Then we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard
Music and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper

[Hook]
[Produced By Dave Free]

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, you niggas know﻿ me

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Wish I could see out of Selassie' eye
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We'd stand a chance against the military tonight

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Babylon, Babylon
Out my window all I see is Babylon
On the news all I see is Babylon
And all niggas do is just babble on
Money and hoes, want money and hoes
If I sold dope, I'd have plenty of flows
If I was from the projects like Jay Rock
I woulda more than likely slang rocks
All my life I done been around Crips and Bloods
Pimps and thugs (Just to name a few)
I do drugs, momma say it's in my blood
But she don't know what the fuck I've been through
To creep through the back door
The typical black boy in the good old USA
Before I pushed rhymes like weight
I used to wanna play for the NBA
Hey...
Fuck I'm doing talking 'bout pineal gland
Ancient ways of Sumerians
Ain't nothing wrong with a righteous man
Damn...
This why I had to write this man
For my niggas on the corner, selling water
To somebody's daughter, fluctuating prices man
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't tryna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain't tryna be nobody's chattel

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
(Extra pills, extra pills)
Them AK clips stay extra peeled
Smoking on some of that extra kill
Purple Urkel, that Jaleel
I put that on everythang
If we could link up every gang
And niggas is willing to bear the pain
We'd put the White House lights out today
Okay-kay-kay
We mobbing like we the black KKK
Don't forget my a.k.a. Mayday
Pee on your Ph. D. or your AA
Hey, Dear Barack
I know you just a puppet but I'm giving you props
You lying to the public like it ain't nothing
And I just love it, I hope it don't stop
I don't give a damn, nigga bang that block
I don't give a fuck, nigga bang that Glock
I seen an image of Hitler in the picture
When the twin towers dropped
Peep the concept
You've got progress, you've got congress
We protest in hopes they confess
Just proceed on your conquest
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't finna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain't finna be nobody's chattel

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
(Extra pills, extra pills)
Nose candy rain like Soul 4 Real
My baby needs some enfamil
So bags get stuffed like Oprah grill
Pull around, come back, oh, for real?
Top blew off, loafers in teal
Get lined up like homeless meals
Feeling if he know how being homeless feels?
Okay-kay-kay
Don't try to stop it, get in my way
You'll get stomped like a Broadway play
AK melee make ya obey, okay?
Feel my pain
Going insane, I'm ashamed
Cause I ain't got shit but an EBT card
From a fiend that owe me and it's in her daughter name
How the fuck is they 'posed to eat?
How the fuck am I 'posed to eat?
Got a nigga in the streets, no health care
Tryna slang weed just to put shoes on his feet
So fuck you, you don't give a fuck about me
Can't get a job if they drug test me
Got a nigga stressed depressed
Got a feeling in his chest and the world's stripped of happiness
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't tryna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain't finna be nobody's shadow
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I fucked up the rap game and you ain't even know it
I just fucked what's her name and you ain't even know it
She got a *censored* tattoo and you ain't even know it
We about to form a little groupie and you ain't even know it, let's get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
It's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin' woman
Stank pussy-poppin' woman
You fuckin' fool don't know about you
But my dick need 70 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell 'em I need my credit when it's due
Tell 'em I need my lettuce when it's new
Tell 'em I got a fetish for fine fabric Franklins and saying, "Fuck you"
Tell 'em it's TDE 'til I'm DDT'd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
'til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free
I'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup
(Dizzle)

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
It's a groovy nigga, that's all day, Backwood hold three grams
Got a six-shooter, that revolver spinning, shell stuck inside, but won't jam
This hoody here about two stacks, hell yeah that bitch could gon' go ham
Molly in her drink, but she asked me to and oh yeah I got this on cam
Gangsta nigga, no trap beats, bet I still sound like that new shit
Originality in my blueprint, still Figg side, Figuero pimp
Her big ass where my palm hit, pull my dick out, she gon' balm it
Swag surfin' all through the world, slide through the sea on a comet
O-X-Y for these morons, that be that new shit I'm pushin'
Raise off of them pockets, bring more of them coffins
These niggas ain't popping, tell them old niggas to move on
Aw damn I done said it, all them can beheaded

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
She ain't single but she solo, you ain't even know it
Unsigned with sold out shows, you ain't even know it
My lips black but they ain’t chapped, she ain’t even know that
Let’s have sex, she said, "Yes", you know she ain’t "no" that
Seed of life on my chest, my head next to her breast
My mind all in the clouds, just bought an ounce of the best
No talking when I’m off that loud
I came quick so she pissed
You know I’m good for another round
But it’s hard when everybody on your dick
Know real niggas that’s crips, I know real niggas that’s bloods
Know real niggas that’s thugging like you ain’t know what’s up
Got codeine in my cup, got a couple checks that need cashing
And you could take that to the bank, what’s life without a balance?
You ain't even know it, nigga I be everywhere you ain’t even going
I thought it was snowing, but I’m just the coldest nigga out here flowin'
Sick of all that bullshit y’all been promoting, but
Carson in the motherfucking house
Del Amo, watch your motherfucking mouth
I took the game by storm, just to X men out
I'm crazy out my mind, I put my life on the line
The tortoise only makes progress when his neck sticks out
Just a little token of gold if you ain't know it, though

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Respect, I get the utmost
I'm so dope I'm a walking kilo
36 Os, you don't even know I'm gettin' cheese like Cheetos
You mad that we BMFing, bitch-ass niggas steady PMSing
I never show my hands, can't know my plans
Gotta keep them guessing
Rock, I was off the scene
Now a nigga back like a four and a half
Shooting up the set like Spielberg
See the big picture when them hammers flash
I don't post a lot on Instagram
That's the quickest way they'll get you man
Leave that shit for the bitches man
Alphabet boys, they'll get your ass
IRS, they was on a nigga
Cashed them out, not I'm scot-free
Got my passport in my JanSport, now I'm overseas
You don't even know it
Rock been killin' this shit, no gloves, no mask on me
Just 100 thousand cash on me
Back then, I was doing bad, homie
All my bitches bad now
My old hoes try to keep tabs on me
Safe to say I'm the man now
Fuck ass nigga just stand down
'Fore the shots go up and it's man down
Hands down, still popping
No prescription, I'm flexing
Suplex a pussy, I've been off the edge
Too late to push me, nigga I ain't fell off
Used to move Frosted Flakes like Kellogg's
Pull up to the bank, count paper like tellers
Top Dawg, Money Gang, bitch, we've been on
Clothesline the beat, nigga, John Cena
Been having stripes, can't walk in my Adidas
Kicked in the door, hand on the Nina
Black Hippy shit, rock gon' bleed 'em

[Outro: Future]
I’m turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin’, you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin’, you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don’t even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean, you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from the bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it
[Produced by Skhye Hutch]

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Back when I first grabbed that pen
I told myself I was gon' win
And I ain't know when
But it was gon' end
Up happening, I want in
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive, and put me after Em
I'm a fucking genius
Gripping my fucking penis
Living this life
You can't tell me nothing
Still ain't really got no money, fucking right
I'm all about that real, about that real
This ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers
Put two chains on and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild
Too damn proud
Been killing this since Cam made "Oh Boy"
Oh boy, I'm the man now
TDE, put the money in my hand ain't shit free
This business is quick sand and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Rest in peace, you just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say
When I wanna say it, okay then
Further more we do this for y'all
Rap is stressing but it pays great
That is, until you lose appeal
And your release date gets date raped
Stay safe, hold your head
I got two fish and a loaf of bread
Feed the people, food for thought
Cause we are equal, who'd have thought

[Hook: Ab-Soul] (Kendrick)
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light)
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light)

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I used to wanna rap like Jay Z, now I feel I could run laps 'round Jay Z
Nas ain't seen nothing this nasty, Big and Pac got it coming when I pass too
You got the mic? I ain't the one you wanna pass to
My niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed, HiiiPower on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too
The brand new niggas with a attitude
Popping Compton or Timbuktu
I might even sell my new shit for 10 bucks too
Too ill when I jot these words, true eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch, when you know life's a bitch and that's not your girl
Cold shit, I'm hot though, like coal get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm, I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes, on P's, y'all know me
Flow like water, admiralty, the best author ever to breathe
And as we proceed to follow these dreams, I ain't losing no sleep
No, no on them NoDoz, just know "No" if it's no dough
So high but I'm Soulo, two cups and I sip slow, taking my time
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, now let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Time and time I drop line for line, but only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine and cop 30 nines and cock back and kill
See the truth is, they wanna know how close me Dre and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this to beat 2Pac
But truth, I give two shits 'bout expectations or critics hating
Shit, I just put moms on vacation
Bitch, you never know my new location, it's across nations
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the mothafuckin' King dethrone now, I am ruler
I am highness, the Prince Zamunda
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tint like Kinte Kunta
Black is back bitch, I'm kin to coup de
Black on black crime resent the shooter
Blat-blat-blat! I intend to mute ya
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks without my A-game
So please don't ask me about no pressure
Bitch, with the grip of my fingertip, I can hold this coast together

[Hook]

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Most of these niggas shouldn't be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Zany imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Your wig'll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap pillers, gangbangers, and dealers
Streets keep watching, aye, click boom the ghetto bird get shot down
Straight to the top now, they want a third strike on my background
But nah homie, put the mask on when I slide on 'em
Put the cash in the safe and here's a extra slug 'fore I shake
You smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet a wet break on a plate
Burning your faith, all your senses covered in tape
Fuckin' with them boys in blue, chill out before I send them rags at you
You running to the cops saying, "How we do?"
Saying it's just rap and them lines ain't true
So I just do Q, fuck it, a ménage à two, or maybe trois
Baby girl need a papa, I be her dada
Coochie smacking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, with Oxymoron, Rock

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I ain't no backpack rapper, I ain't no lyricist
And if we ain't talking to you, mind your business then
Cold with it, Black Hippy, yeah, we cold niggas
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us
They bones quiver, heard some clown throwing stones at us
Holding boulders champ once you hear that "YAWK," watching domes shatter
It's Top Dawg we runnin' rap, whack rappers, feline
Reason why we don't run with cats
Nine double O five nine, where my family at
Pull up in that family van holding tools like the handyman
And to be real not with all this rapping politickin'
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
'Til I'm finished, 'til I make a couple tickets
Then I'm outtie on them islands with my crimmies chillin'
Hide your feelings, now can I live?
Look I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
Cause everywhere I go they like "When you dropping some work?"
Been a threat since birth
The rap game's pallbearer when I'm droppin' the hearse
I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Industry's nightmare, red strings in my Nike Airs
Yeah, the white pair, I'm Jay Rock, America's most wanted
My charges? Killing MC's without warning
Rock!

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
It's Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, I'm the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing a sticky
All odds against me, still even the score
Probably why I'm always OT on tour
TDE, believe me we want war
I don't even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, two triggers, what's the difference?
We all gon' die one day, until then I'm gettin' paid
My grandma watching so I ain't gon' curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse, backwood full of OG
Bobby Johnson medicine in my soul to trynna dodge the coffin
And these days are so bittersweet
I guess it's just a balance we battle naturally
And y'all still trippin' off of Jay-Z tweets
I still got laps to run when me and Jay-Z meet
Peep, Soul brother number two
The first one used to make beats for CL Smooth
Top got the S550 but the CL smooth
And rolling weed is the only time I see L's move
Soul!

[Verse 4: Isaiah Rashad]
I think I found my second home
Sunny California and it's your little nigga brother
You ain't meant for corners, it's what they told me
So I never looked back, I got a shell in the bag
Fat as elephant ass, so we flirt in the path
Passing propellers I tell her, tell her we flying just listen
See we diamond just shining and they gon' find us glistening
Brought sand to the beach and we left with your bitch
For the record in Guinness I'm a hecklin' menace
Where is Robin, I'm Given', fuckin' minding my business
He a regular victim, of some regular in women
Regular niggas, you always cater to sluts
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk
I put your motherfuckin' dream in your face
You keep lookin' for some women to be all in your face
That deep dussy reach niggas, keep dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a nigga be dussy
You can never rap better than me, cause you ain't dedicated
You ain't underrated, you ain't  underlooked
You ain't overbooked, you just undercooked
It's supposed to be me and my niggas in the record book
Now they got me out here by myself still fresh as fuck

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
I hate y'all, I'd do anything to replace y'all, shout out to Face Mob
A ghetto boy 'til I'm unemployed with a day job
And kicking boxes, I kick ass and then kick knowledge
I'm way more polished than 99% of the scholars you thought had graduated
I'm the master that masturbated on your favorite emcee
Until the industry had wanted me assassinated
You either corny or an opportunist
I let you eat, now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
What I been doing? I'm about to crack the Da Vinci Code
Yeah, and nothing's been the same since they dropped Control
And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you, high-five
I'm bulletproof, your shots'll never penetrate
Pin a tail on a donkey, boy, you been a fake
I got my thumb on Hip Hop, and my foot in the back of your ass
Aftermath get the last laugh
I serve niggas like master Geoffrey
Jump on the curb, turn a shotty to a verb if you let me
You know I'm a killer, I'm on your head, you know I'm a killer
The West Coast Cosa Nostra under oath 'til it's over
You over owe us, so what the fuck?
I fuck you niggas up, I fuck you niggas up, she suck and fuck
I fuckin' duck you fuckin' niggas like when I want
You go at us, you going fuckin' nuts
Acting irrational, pop you then pop an Adderall
Know the drill like a lateral, nigga
I'm more Pappy Mason than Pastor Mason
Pacing back and forth, racing my thoughts on embracing Daytons
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
I feel like some of y'all is hating
Quite frankly your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick?
Accidents never happen when murder's involved
Emaculate tactics so follow me, if you need me just call on me
I say "Hold up, wait a minute
Your career ain't shit unless you got some Kendrick in it!"
Your pussy ain't shit, ain't no room is left on my dick
Unless you look like Jordin Sparks, make my mark on the clitoris, muah
Hollywood's been good to me, lil' hood nigga used to pawn mom's jewelry
Family jewels big as fuck and I got the balls to say it
Balls deep, ballin' out 'til Spalding need a replacement
I'm outchea, the West in your mouth, chea
Invest in the vests of Vietnam vets when you out near
The white court building spilling its Merlot
Fillin' women, a Virgo, pimp the industry
Remember these Stacy Adams and furcoats
Shook, you're scared to death, you're scared to look
In the mirror when Kendrick is near you
King, Kendrick

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
This what you really want, huh
Turn me up, Ali

[Sample: Donny Hathaway]
I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Black lip bastard, pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain, see I, too, have gone insane
Before I fall, I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name
Lead shower, Anna Peebles hour, bitch, stand the rain

Look inside my parking garage and see a collage
Of every person I despise since the moment I turned five
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even falling off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj (So soft)
Eat that pink pussy like it's Friday
Bust one, Roman Reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too (Hey baby)
Don't fucking take me for some kind of fool
I'm kinda the reminder of knowing Compton ain't kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views
Countertops, we hop over, hit the register, then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
Before I climb this pedestal and make you catch my fucking stool, bitch
K.Dot, leave 'em grieving on evening news
Even when society break even, I'll break rules

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I told niggas, caught wrecked, then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers, nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
Like a cliché to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretching the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or that or they depressed, eating yogurt in bed
Solar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait, I'm straight, you a gay couple
I ain't thirsty for the deal, way to make 'em pay double
Anxious when the bacon on the table, I need a muzzle
You're basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was running L.A., now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? I'm a bastard with black lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
I'm awkward, dog, I'm tryna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis' ass

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Figg side, black nine, black lips, smoke time
Fuck this rap shit, I'm active
Sucking on titties since I was eight
Hoodie with my shades, I ain't tryna be fake
So don't be talking to me, pussy
Running your gums like you be Loc'ing
When the world know that you're nookie
Rookie, softer than infant fabric
I won't have it, when the gun drawn, get rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tatted
Know my niggas moving
You hesitating to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doing?

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Perpetrating, bitches popping Percocet and percolating
Freelance for God, but do the work of Satan, whatever works
I'm clever with the words, if you haven't noticed yet
Lightyears ahead, I'm bright and I like to get oral sex
Soul brother number 1+1, getting fed like where drugs and guns come from

[Verse 5: Jay Rock]
All we do is do it, shitting on the competition
Taking heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music
You niggas don't move me, you niggas just movies
Cut straight to them credits and hit you wit' a Uzi
Peel off in a dullies, truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, poke on some coochie
I'm just fucking around, enough with them fairy tales
But I bust heads for real, go head
I'm Jay Rock, you lil niggas beneath me
How you gon' dance with the devil with two left feet?
Peep, thinking you sweet, but you weak
Talking out of turn'll leave all of your teeth in the street
Momma taught you better, never clash with a giant
Unless you David, remember, my nigga, I'm not Goliath
Feel the wrath of this titan, hit some water, call it Poseidon
Wig out, then hit your ass with a trident
Money on the table, my nigga, you know I'm all in
If rap was a drink, you wine, nigga, I'm all gin
Hunnit proof, recruit a hunnit troops who love to shoot
No fluke, my nigga, you know that's what us hunters do
East side up, Watt City mayhem
Choppers, they spraying from A.M. to P.M
I'm the silent assassin of the four-headed dragon
Black Hippy blasting a .50 out the back of the Benz Wagon
Toe-tagging wack rappers off G.P
You can't see me, your vision ain't 3D
You smoking on that seaweed, we rolling up that kiwi
In the backwood lighting, we high for like three weeks
You paying for that pussy, but we always get freebies
Top Dawg that ho and throw it like a frisbee, it's history
You know the night and day is ours
Top Dawg conglomerate, Hiii Power, bitch!

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Is this what y'all really want?
This Black Hippy shit what y'all really want?
When I'm in interviews, don't ask me 'bout no crews
No posses, no cliques, don't tell me who's gettin' it
I don't give a fuck, nigga
I just paid-- I just paid six figures in taxes, nigga
I'm rich daily, on some independent shit
Uncle Sam talking 'bout [?]
I'm like "Nigga, fuck you!"
K-Dot said it, not Kendrick
Ab-Soul got us stuck on the planet, nigga
T.D.E., solar system, Control System, bee-otch!
[Produced by DJ Dahi & Blood Diamonds]

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Dark matter with the sparks scattered up above
Velvet hands in the upper glove, touch
Like bad double dutch
And two Amsterdam's ain't enough, D.R.U.G.S
"Don't ruin us, God said", #DROGAS
Too much pride we electric slide, we should be closer
Like soca, not a chain but a choker
I see the sun then the clouds then the vultures
Pay respects in my sensei's sculpture
High as the angel on the Dikembe's shoulder
Eyes looking like MKUltra
Redacted vision through these dark shades
Bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
Hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak
Park full of art, arteries full of parkay
Beating it like new games, easily defeating
Or two gangs meeting for the evening
Or two feet on a Riesling, slow wind
Meditate until there's no mind
Decorate me with shine till I go blind
BDSM dominated it with no bind
Safe word is don't stop, both or don't go no times

[Hook]
Proceed to the next level

Proceed to the next level

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Coolest, tulips, flowers, fall from the towers
Like balls from Galileo to lay low
Ignorance is that the world isn't ours, the gall
Give them all showers
Tony found the fountain of youth, in the mountain of powder
To only find truth in the fountain, drowning in power
Surrounded with dollars
The moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder
Cut, that's a mis-direct to stir the soul with dis-effect
Names don't last like Mr. X
Unless you Galilee, dropping bowling balls on the discotheque
With a disco ball hanging 'round your neck
Dance, it's a new year
Every time I open my hands
Thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal
Yokozunas throwing salt in the circle
Sumo you up off off your turf boy
Tsunami you up off your surfboard
Midas turn Medusas into gold
'Fore Versace turned words into turquoise
Medusa turned coke into stone
With a hand on her thigh, she looked me in the eye and said
Proceed to the next level

[Bridge: Troi]
Come so far, seen so much (Tron)
I cannot settle for good enough
So I'll sweat and I'll climb until I reach my prime
(Proceed to the next level)
The forces rise and fall again
Through it all, I'll reach the end
In my eyes, there's a fire and it takes me high

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Uh, Yeah, Soulo!
Shoot for the moon, even if you miss you'll be among the stars (space)
Backstroke in my pool of thought but don't mind the sharks (wavy)
Ab-solar system intergalactic soldier
Lupe say I'ma stoner, I say that I'm much bolder
Trapped in a game where the trap is the game
Scope this horror, Aquariuses make it rain here
No love for your honor, only God can judge us
If you're Islamic, Allah, I've had it up to my collar
With these niggas castin' stones like this Mancala
Proceed to the next level, dig that with a platinum shovel
Black magic, matter of fact, if matter is fact
A matter factory is in the making perhaps
Uh, erase your database
We race against time, no time to set a date
Tetsuo & Youth induced
Too cool for school, unloose the noose and

[Hook]

[Outro: Troi]
We're going up, we're going up
Next level, next floor
I'm ready for it
I've been waiting all my life
Tron, Tron
We're going up, we're going up
Next level, next floor
[Verse: Ab-Soul]
If your word is bond your bars are harder than my last bar
All that other shit is feble we're people get jacked for it
Don't make your face another bulletin on the wanted tack board
Crash court DA call the task force
We off the 91 freeway this what you asked for
Fast forward, we in Cahoots, with the rival troops
Fuck the rivalry, when you can get more loot
Like, fuck the ice if you could get more suit
Stick a swisher in my suit when I die and I'll be cool
Smoking cools outside of the school, no cruel
My niggas that graduated and I'll be out soon
Make sure my plan is saturated for the (video ends)
[Intro]
Everybody get the fuck down now
Soul in the building
Yeah, we taking everything
Everything you got

[Verse 1]
Hit the deck I need everything you possess
I suggest you cooperate for this tech
Send you to the doctor to operate
You complicate my scheme to get rich
I'll put this heat to your T, let it steam a little bit
Look, when the chips get low, my fifth just blow
Anything that I could pawn, come about that, dog
It's money to be made and if you got it I'm taking it
Just run it like a Jamaican and shut the fuck up, nigga

[Hook]
And that might leave more than a rash
I'm coming for your ass
Please hand me the cash
Cause when I'm down on my last
I gotta re-up fast
Point me to your stash
Don't make me say it again
Before I lay you with Reagan, Benjamin Franklin, and them
Frankly I'm a menace
In fact I'm ready to blast
So whatever you got, run it
Like a 100 yard dash

[Verse 2]
Coming for you
Don't let me catch you slipping in that pretty whip you dip in
You would get pulled out
Like my dick in these women when I'm finna bust, don't test my clout
Your execution is a must, no doubt
For the longest niggas been taking my kindness for weakness
But this trigger is killing me and I'm just dying to squeeze it
Fire for hire, don't let your murder transpire
Thinking you will live forever like a fucking vampire
I arose from the dark to claim everything you own
And there's nothing between us but opportunity and this chrome
It don't take a genius to know I mean this, so ante up
Before I load the cannon up and blow your ass to Canada
Nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm wild with it, pistol whip whoever's in the house with it
Call the cops, tell 'em like a date, I'm going out with it
Give me the goods, give me the hand me downs
Tell your wife to pull her panties down
I need those too, what you gon' do?
Don't jeopardize your life, for the nigga hard body made of cement
Plus I'm loaded like this clip, off of the Seagrams
Lay you on the floor like granite
Granted your granny watching, I'm grinning like I ain't just hit 'em
Better believe it, my head's sort of off, shit
I would have robbed Jesus for the cross if I caught him slipping
God forgive him for this long arm like Pippen
The cars honk but times is hard hard and I gotta eat
Give me the watch, the Sean-John, even your sneaks
Give me your socks, your drawers, your fitted, your Boost minutes
Give me your stocks, your bonds, your blunts, your bongs
Your food in the fridge, your iPod, your celly
You say I'm wrong but I'm deadly
That's dead wrong so I'm heavy
Like Chris Wallace, regardless
You're getting stuck up, pussy
Like a tampon with a handgun, push me
But I ain't on the swings, I got this infrared beam and it wouldn't miss a thing
Bow!

[Outro]
Chyea! Rose
I got you nigga
I want everything
I want the jewels, the watches, the bling bling, all that shit
All y'all little niggas getting your chains robbed
I'm on you
I'm just playing y'all, I wouldn't hurt a fly
Came out dope though
Carson arsonist
Yeah, it's funny that you say Carson-Carson arsonist
That's where you're from right? Carson?
Yes, yes sir
Where is that exactly? If I looked on a map, where would I be lookin'?
Carson is right in between Compton and Long Beach
Shout out to Carson, Del Amo, that's where I'm from though, DA

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat and they all tryna get fucked
10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat, backseat, backseat

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
90's flow, mid though, catch us crawlin' in that Caddy
There he go, smokin' dope, man I swear it came from Papi (Hola)
Ab-Soul, so you know, don't be actin' unfamiliar
West Side, Del Amo, I got it tatted on my spirit
Spiritual, 10 hoes, hostage in the CTS
Lambo, windows up, that molly might make them undress
Oh for sure, Soulo ho­e, minus E and add the 3
3 eyes to the third, word to the 33
Holy shit, who is this? They call me the God MC
Perform miracles and shit, I turn water into lean
Man I'm always gettin' shaded cause I stay around some tree
Man I'm always gettin' faded, but no barbershop for me

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat and they all tryna get fucked
10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat and they all tryna have fun
Don't stop
(Can you fit 10 hoes in your backseat?)
Made all them bitches lap up, say what
(You made all them women lap up)
Yup, 10 hoes in the backseat and they askin' me for them drugs
I got 10 pounds in the trunk, 10 pints in my backpack

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
I made 10 racks off 10 to 4s, I spit crack, need 10 a show
Keep bad chicks with their skin exposed, my hoes thicker than winter clothes
10 deep so they finna roll, gon' lap up, girl, make some space
10 pints in my backpack, more seals than a naval base
I stole a 6, I'ma drink an 8, the other deuce, I'm gon' save it
I know these rapper dudes hate it when they hear me on their boo's playlist
It's Young Fresh and my dues paid, fresh pair of cool greys
And I keep pounds on me, like I'm in the U.K
I'm on point like Jeremy Lin, and I'm reppin' that H-Town
Soon as all of her girls is in, I made 'em bust it like Greyhound
That's right, I'm a man, ho, haters cannot stand Short
No matter if it's made by Gucci, Louis V or Jansport, I

[Hook: Ab-Soul]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
10 mil' in my back pocket, 20 thou on these rap watches
Talkin' money, nah that's obnoxious, fuck these hoes, pass chronic
Came through, easily, Ab-Soul the new Eazy-E
Talkin' shit, leave him be, I'm chiefin' weed, watchin' DVDs
Eatin' 5 star meals in my home
My crib look like Johnny Depp's in Blow
Got a cast around my arm, but I'm still smackin' rappers
Don't fuck with these bars, no homie, that's disaster
Sittin' on a couple million
Will please someone give Vince a fuckin' Cinnabon (Aye, I'm hungry nigga)
You talkin' shit but where your facts at?
Bitch I got 10 million in my backpack

[Hook: Ab-Soul]

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Everyday 10 mil'
10 mil', 10 mil'
Everyday 10 mil'
10 mil', 10 mil'
Everyday 10 mil'
10 mil' everyday

Yo, Look

[Verse]

I don't follow no trends
But I'm a beast and I'm hyped
Soul assassin, all I need is a beat and a mic
Like Joseph Jackson
When I kill it, I feel so alive
And I get high so much that I don't know goodbye
So what's the word?, I'm down to earth but i was 'posed to fly
Life threw for me a lil' cool roller coaster ride
I never complain, I never play the blame game
Fuck the world, my dick hang like a crane chain
In other words I'm ready
My teachers thought I was sharp, my every word's a machete
Who goes there? Have no fear, it's just I
Who showed you what you can't see with just eyes
I kept it justice and poetry over beats and hoaxes
My city win like the Chicago beat
I took a chance and rapped like I'm a Chicago breed, for realer
If I ain't the most dope, than it's Mac Miller
'Coz these days I wear many faces
Rollin' up a drough tree Californicatin'
[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like bees in this track
Just smoked out, I ain't talking 'bout what you toke out
Get choked out fo'rilly, thinking that this shit a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't acting on the scene niggas scream
The actions ain't screened, just well schemed
I'm trying to have wealth for my well being by 18
Pockets healthy green, what the fuck is 12 beans?
I need the cake and cream, stakes is high like fiends off a dream
Jet streaming having cuisine with the best seasons
It's the vet season carry a vest you know the reason
I'm in Chiraq and I'm getting blown like the breezes
Your chicken strip tease us, thighs leg and the breast part is the cleavage
She even lick it down to the bone marrow
She in love but I don't got a bow and arrow
I'm known to jack the booty like I'm sparrow
They ain't trying to see me in the battle, they lines is too narrow
They couldn't even outshine my shadow
They don't want the beef nigga let alone the cattle
They just want to ride the saddle, it's so sad though

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Hammers present, you gettin' wrapped up
Uhh, jump out the Mack truck, black tux
Go 'head and act up, drink the blood out of the brass cup
Your jewels are fake those are glass cut
No snakes keep the grass cut
Thick dominican women skin cinnamon with they ass up
Sick spinning, I stay shitting like a sick pigeon
Different colors glisten of the wrist prism
Blicker off the hip hit 'em, spun 'em
Chopped an onion, in the process peeped the diagnostics
See my shorty draped up in an ostrich
Smoking weed from the doctor
As I sit on a train to Paris draped in fabric like an arabic
Mommy always knew her boy was talented
Come off tour give her 20 thou for nothing
Cause it's nothing to me I'm something to see
Sunk in the sea, Duncans on feet
Shits are shiny take a shower rather dump in the heat
Jump out the jeep looking fly like a bundle of geese, jeez
I'm on some shit
I'm talking 7 series triplets, bitches with military fitness
And my girl a shooter like Chamique Holdsclaw
With coke in the door, she used to play ball
For Christ the King, selling drugs got her the icy ring though
Me

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
The last black hippy to get a wiki
I'm in your city getting a hickey from your chick in her Vickies
Don't try act like I ain't popping homie
My style like Mandela meets Monster Kody
Cop backwoods by the box bro, OG only
Drop 460 for a zip, need 2 to be cozy
I hate to stunt but look me up
Evil Knievel ain't much when I do my stuff
Polo tee polo black cologne
Burberry by my nuts she won't leave me lone
The Levi's was on sale, but I ain't flexing hard
Flexing, never had a 24 Hour Fitness card
I told myself I wouldn't flip I made a little bit
I'm no magician but I hope this blue dolphin do the trick
Behind the mic with a thizz face
You take your Mrs. through my entrance thats a mistake
I got it bad like Usher Raymond
Middle finger to the plaintiff, screaming Top Dawg Entertainment
Look I don't know why you niggas hating
I take that back cause I know why you niggas hating
I just said it cause I likeded how it came in
I even used likeded, that ain't a word, I'm just saying
I got to be the greatest on this land, I spell high with
3 I's and I'll never never land
The rap Mike Jack, Peter Pan with 28 grams
Hendrix with no guitar, Albert on Adderall
Yeah, jug
Smoke 'til I'm Weezy don't worry what's in my cup

[Verse 4: Travis Scott]
Speeding, and damn I’m leaning, on the Kawasaki
In the lobby, got me dro codinein’, out in Abu Dabi
Chain beaming, hope it ain't anemic, cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, just me and four women, and we all playing hockey
Blow Scott La Flame, pimpin, no cane
Rocking the chain and hood with no pass
Fucked up the flow, nothing but fam cause niggas be hoes
Have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ when I stock it up and then grow
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs, my nigga Yeezy done taught me that
Young niggas in the Soho House spilling booze wherever the Barbies at
Damn homie, this a movie nigga, take a picture or somethin', where your Kodak at?
Scottie is tokin and swimming with women, he writing, producing, then score and filming it
Oh god, my god, this shit be like God-level
Nigga you talking money nigga, stacking several
Bonds over billions niggas the real is in the building
With Ye and Hova niggas know what the deal is
The deal is nigga the realest
Young Scott the rock, rocking from the Phyllis
Got my nigga Bronson, Joey, Ab-Soul
And you know a nigga pockets getting swole on the road, yup
The sum of all fears is a and billion and three
More of a reason why everybody's scared of me
Cause ain't nobody sayin' nothin' rare to me
Just comedy, or a parody
You could suck two dicks for comparin' me
To any rapper that fits in this category
Section 80's baby, pray you follow me home
See my habits, my contradictions and my systems of control
Top Dawg Entertainment
They saying we saviours like this ain't dope we slanging, hope
You can get a feel for the skill like the famous coach
Ain't need a ring on my finger to be a champion
You can't be on my level, you'd get expired
We was racing on unicycles, I wouldn't be the one tired
Soulo Ho3, well known from Del Amo to SoHo ho
Don't stop, roll more dro till you comatose
My egg's fried, probably why I like omelets the most
Lonnie wanted me to vote, I love Lonnie but no
See I ain't into politics and shit, I got my own pole
What's the difference between a person and a human?
One of 'em is free, the other one is stupid
And I'm caught in between the two, which direction are you in?
Put a "Yo" in front of "universe" and tell me what do you get?
[Verse 1: Twista]
See you with the eye
Rather at the apex of a pyramid or the forehead of a cyclops
Talking shit to me make sure you're off the right block
Still I'mma come through in the Mercedes Benz white drop
Might stop, but only if I know you I don't mean to blow you with the statement
But I don't be fuckin' with these niggas, and that's why they be hatin'
Cause I stay in the zone, I be alone, so excuse me if I'm wrong
I'm off a kush, and when the T.H.C. affect the dialect I be as free as the wind and fire
Let the energy in me be my empire yet the remedy for me is ultraviolet, violence, silence
All the critic's when I spit it I'mma creature of punishment when it comes to torturing
And with this rap shit I'm a beast
Balling like I'm Uncle Pauly and all of the above we goin' in the club incognito with the snub
East, be the direction that I'm prayin in
But I'm a Midwest nigga
Mean with a verse, something fly- I am seen with it first
So they can say "Where you get that nigga?"
The essence of my vocabulary's exquisite when I enter into a realm, taking me to the helm
Of lyricism, you gonna be callin' me majesty, callin' a tragedy that you gotta see on film
So I salute and advise you not to shoot, you are not equivalent or parallel to my level
Sub-par, So coming at me wrong is worse then being on the carousel with the devil
I can turn these happy homes and these fake MC's into whole apartment buildings and vacancies
Bakeries, cook em til they done, whoop em til they wump, put a funk in them niggas
Watch what you say to me

[Bridge]
Don't play with me, I'mma make a hater pray to me
God cause I'm hard and my flows is the coldest
You are no threat, don't step, I am a descendent of Imhotep, yes, Moses knows this
Of annihilation we are on a brink, I be smokin' up the stink, so before somebody thinks
See see i'mma start to get ugly as Michael Spinks  , when I rap about the Sphinx, instead of about minks
Knowledge is power so he taught you 'bout your third eye

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Type of shit I make a bird swim, fish fly
Fuck it, touch the sky on the first try
Man a motherfucker could never control me, only squeeze me and hold me
Is what the ho came up and told me, Now is she bold g?
But in my mouth is where the gold be, cause I be playin' her like Goldy
Ab-Soul I know ya know me
Pack of Backwoods jar of that good yeah I blow it by the OZ
I never sleep, you getting cozy
I made it out the jungle, I should write a book about Mowgli
I ain't a killer but don't push me
I hit you with a Sig, but I'd rather smoke up on a stogie
God MC, you could say I'm holy
The ghost of Alori Joh walk with me so a nigga never lonely
Solo (Soulo), but Top Dawg is a army
Flow AT and T nigga 4 g's
Might be the hip hop Bob Marley, Taking shots at politicians while I roll weed
Easily Eazy-E without the Jheri Curl Juice
Off that drank that make you think every girl cute
On top of the pyramid, A angles acute
Mark of the Beast on me, him, her, and you
Money in the safe in case there's a lawsuit
Because any lumberjack would say they saw you
Me and Twista in the cut twistin up a blunt what the fuck you want?

[Bridge]
[Verse 1]
This verse was ghost written by Capital STEEZ
I’m high cause I fly with Loriana’s angel wings
Not cause I smoke weed, we in the era of the Pros
If you peepin' this your speaker Is worth 47 Karat gold, Soul
Yo, correct me if I'm lyin', you got a Hublot, but we both know
You still check your iPhone to tell the time
Only time will tell, you're atomic as my microscopic
You tryin' to spit a verse, I'm trying to crack the macrocosms of the universe
It's all Mathematics!
I multiply division like I was fitted for glasses
The difference between me and you is
All you do is subtract, all my tracks sub
To sum it up that ain't adding up, I've had it up
To here with this shit I be hearin' These Days
Marvel Comics' superheroes in capes with marbles for brains
But I'm the Peter Parker in this World Wide Web
Spider senses tingling, move like I have 8 legs
I got next, cause I show them how to use their head
Rip the arms of a grizzly with my bare hands
I bet you play dead and I bet they think
That I'm delivering babies the way I bring in the bread
And I hate to address it but niggas wearin' dressses now?
Hey, it do cost a lot to live this here lifestyle
Cash money talk, bullshit walk a million miles
And I don't even write, where am I supposed to draw the line?
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd actually be Rapsody
Half of these niggas sell pussy after the
Top Dawg that mastered this craftsmanship
Ain't cop these Margielas to go back to the ave then Crip
To make you more jealous cause now we getting paid per view
Cash stashed in the plasma, that's a Pay-Per-View
And I still remember what Pac's Pop told us
"Keep your enemies close nigga, watch your homies"
And it's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, troll your insta
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya
My little sister just did molly for the first time
While I'm rolling with models, forgetting I'm a role model
Who else you know who shot across the whole nation
No MTV Jam or radio rotation
So don't ask me about Kendrick and Q
Jay Rock, Zaywop and SZA's sexy ass too
Cause I was thinking Long Term before I met them
I've been through Hell and back I deserve Heaven
And I thank all of yall who supported the 'These Days Tour'
For 47 cities there's 47 Bars
And this is the 47th bar
[Hook]
Yeah, Yeah, I'm feeling like that
So I spit it how I feel it
So you feel it right back x3

[Verse 1]
My heart, I spill it on them tracks
Like it fell out of glass and it came from Ab
Soul motherfucker, wave your white flag
Your reigns over like summer came over a hurricane
My sun shine bright bitch, throw on your shades
I got mines on now, they look good on my face
Don't give a fuck what you say
'Cos I'm the same nigga everyday
I never change like a penny or a nickle, a dime or a quarter
Under this New Era is the New World Order
My brain could slaughter a nation of recorders
Sit 'em in line, I run through them in chronological order
This is not what you made up for
Sorry for ya
I'm coming like a nut
Whaddup?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Back in school I wrote verses by the paragraph
Now I write like a pilot in a aircraft
In the sky, wear wings like a damn badge
So clean me and Jesus could share a bath
Now that's Soul religion
I'm at the mound with the style, play your position
You at a short stop, I had a long run
I'm at the finish line, you looking at me from behind
That mean you lost one, let's go for two
A perversion of mine, cos I'm berzerk with the lines
I think back to when I first learned to rhyme
But now I'm bad to the bone
I'm like a poisionous sign
Top notch to my socks and my shoes fit perfect
'Nahm saying?' was a classic, I wish you could have heard it
I be fucking over beats til I damage the cervix
I got bars like night clubs, and great service
5:30 in the morning, I'm still up cooking
Cyphers so arised, you would go blind looking
I ain't got punchlines no more, I'm right hooking
If I switch south par, niggas going down dawg
A-b-S-o-u-l-u-t-e
Yeah, you see me
A-b-s-o-u-l-u-t-e
Yeah, you see me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Soul assassin
You know what's happening x3
[Intro]
Guess it's got to the point
Where I just gotta spell this shit out for y'all, know what I mean?
See, y'all niggas hear the name Ab-Soul, right?
Y'all niggas think I'm supposed to be talkin' about mu fuckin'
The flowers and the earth or somethin' like that, know what I'm talkin' about?
I'm a real ass nigga though, on everything
Lemme break it down

[Hook]
I said A is for the apple on the tree I ain't far from
B is for the bottom of the bottle of hard rum
Dash to the finish line, chasing the S
Which stands for my favorite three letter word (Sex)
O is for all the ounces of dro I consume
U meaning a unanimous decision of whom
Is number 1, leaving the L which stands for Love
I spread it like the blood of fallen soldiers above

[Verse 1]
You put it all together and you get Ab-Soul-
Lutely, the best, salute me or meet death
Like Gaylord Focker met the parents of his girl Martha
We're staring at you, will depart ya
Thats the 38 special
Commentary from the King author not the knights of the round table sponsor
But amongst the dopest the west coast has had to offer since the '80s crack epidemic
I play drums for the contraband
Matter of fact, hit me
King Blue you a fool for this one
I ain't even gon' spit, just drool on this one
My saliva's way liver than yours, rappers
Shut your trap 'fore I set it
Y'all gassed up like your guns, unleaded
Yeah I said it, don't chat, no telling where we headed
Close shop when I open fire
Cause Soul known to carry the cannon like Mariah
Yes I uh
Bring it to you raw and uncut
No buts like an empty ash tray, what the fuck

[Break]
Matter of fact, lemme break it down for y'all one more time, look

[Hook]
I said A is for the apple on the tree I ain't far from
B is for the bottom of the bottle of hard rum
Dash to the finish line, chasing the S
Which stands for my favorite three letter word (Sex)
O is for all the ounces of dro I consume
U meaning a unanimous decision of whom
Is number 1, leaving the L which stands for Love
I spread it like a virus, it'll kill you if you buy it

[Verse 2]
I'm with your girl playing games like
Who could get the highest at the Hyatt, real fun you should try it
I got her wet, I'll send her back to you to dry it
You ain't the flyest or the king of the jungle, but you lying
And I can see it through ya iris
Drink like I'm Irish, think like a genius
Fall back I'm all that like Kel and Keenan
Add a bag of chips and the baddest bitch
I'll be posing with a black in my mouth, grabbing my dick
Constipation is an understatement I ain't ever gave a shit
You know you hot when
You only get 8 bars in a song and it's still everybody's favorite
My fault, my god, I'm a problem like a broke condom
A editor just told me nobody was in my column
Top Dawg 4th wheel and I'm still ill
Open up the car door that look like a steel mill
I hotbox like cable in the hood
And I'm good like wrenches with a sentence, understood?
And if it's not I'll leave you with this
Top Notch muthafucka, like snot muthafucka, I'm sick

[Outro]
Don't get infected
Bitch ass niggas
T-D-E
[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I gave her my heart, she gave me her's too
This exposition, the definition of true
I knew her for years, she knew me too
As if our souls influenced this pursuit
Beginning as children, forgetting we grew
Just an analogy for how the time flew
Inseparable, two peas in a pod
Running through my mind like every two minutes tops
In the back seat, doing what we do in the spot
Hear you "ooo" when I hit the spot, head hit the roof
Young lovers under the moon, it's cool but it's hot
Nails in my back, exhaling on my neck yes
I'm haunted by these memories
And what I thought to be a premonition of a wedding ring was just a dream
So now I'm taking all these drugs to go to sleep; weed and white
Lean and Sprite, hoping God is holding me
I wanna blame her, but I ain't
I wanna touch her but I can't
I still love her, I'm afraid
But her absence disturbs the harmony we made
And I never say I'll never find another girl
Who ain't a freeloader or a renter
But a winner that'll buy me out
Terrace bring the sax in, I'm signing out

(Soul!)
[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Fire in the street, fire in my swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your little sister
Just get a sip of this elixir, before they crop us out of the picture
I've never seen a crop circle but I've seen a cop circled the block
I puff squares, but I swear one day I'mma stop my nerves itch
On the brink of my career, while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams (Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me)
One two, three four grams and a fifth of Hennessey
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary

[Bridge]
Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin, you vote for the better man
Come to our show you can see the diversity
Unify people they going to peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we going to manipulate it, I hope you participating
Ayo Dot, won't you let these cats know
We knew we'd be here, like back in 04'
Started HiiiPower because our generation
Needed a generator and a system, meant to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture hasn't developed yet
Like what if Keisha were celibate
What if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend with his girlfriend's girlfriend
Let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well (Odd Future's aight)
But our future is not, that Martial law shit dropped, we gonna all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat that fast food, and use that flouride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public
Work a little nine to five, don't forget to pay your tithes
And to thank God you're alive (HiiiPower)
And on another note, we focused like the Hubble Telescope, Soul

[Hook]
Life is a traffic jam (Life is a traffic jam) [x10]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie, I do, Section 80
Your son will play me if the radio won't
Daughters that just turn one to twenty one listen to Kendrick
For instance

[Ab-Soul]
What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV

[Kendrick Lamar]
True story, hmm, can you repeat that for me Soul

[Ab-Soul]
What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Is you gonna plead the fifth, or sound the horn
The time is now my child, come on

[Kendrick Lamar]
See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes
God and history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I've spent twenty three years on the earth searching for answers
'til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You've ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes
God and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human mothafuckin' being, over dope ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar, now fuck 'em up Terrace (Soul!)

[Outro]
I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
Know they can't control us
Know they can't control you
Know they can't control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something thats bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor and respect
This is you, this is me
And we are HiiiPower

She got me feeling like a half a pint of lean
Off some green, couple xannies, xannies
Get me in the zone, then I'm off on tour
Ever since that, when I'm on top
The only time she understand me
Cause I be gettin' so high my feet swangin'
I only do it like a drug, do it like a drug
Your bitch in there, licking me
We could do it like a drug
Tap until the pipe time
[?]
And I swear that I'm so high, my feet swangin'


[Verse 1: Fre$h]
I'm with my white ho
In the mirror gettin' high with the lights low
Girl you know what's on my mind when the boss call
Trying to stroke it from behind like a golf ball
And she don't even know my name
She call me Short Dawg, I told her call me Fre$h
I rub her like a condom
And she grant our request
We gettin' the contraceptive
Come get naked, I got some weed to match
And another cheek to tie you up, no strings attached
That's the deal
So she opened wide and swallowed it like that's appeal
And I know it was inspired by my rapping skills
Oh well, at least it happened still
And you would think I cracked the seal cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Her name ain't Mary Jane, but she with me through everything
I roll up and then I hit her
Don't that sound familiar?
Abuse that coochie like a drug, you know what's up ho
She let me lean on her like this promethazine on her
She got that fire, you might wanna try her out
Went through that peer pressure and the diamond popped out
Me and Lucy in the sky, doin' what we do
We gettin' high like how's it going or how are you?
She psychedelic and a trip too
I dip, she dip, we dip, consider molly crystal
She raise the bar and I just can't leave them xannies alone
I think I like her

[Hook]


[Verse 3: Fre$h]
Man, I'm so high
I swear it, why lie?
I'm high enough to give a high five to Allah
High enough to slam dunk when I'm gonna get dumped
She want the cock back, pistol kissin', grilled pumped
Hair combed, young Fly's from the side
Diamonds in my mouth, gold flashin'
Meetin' through these niggas, closed captioned
Stay fun flow, go and make that foam crashin'
I'm from the H, Texas is my state
My ho's like plates cause they underneath the case
I hit 'em when they comin'
I ain't gonna need a date
Baby girl, I'm straight like the letter "I"
Motivated by the money that I can't deny
It gets me high

[Hook: Francesca]
Is it real?
Is it fake?
I woke up, suddenly I just woke up

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Look, yo, it only makes sixth sense
They sleep on the creator of Pineal Gland
No offense taken, I’m just racin’, the savior of man
Crucifix, positive, addition, it’s all the same
Given that getting head is cool, but what is it if you don’t use your brain
That’s one plane, negative subtraction, but still a balance
If dyslexic then play this shit backwards
Uh, the black lip captain of the ship
When you dividing the pie, rats come, it’s all math son
So is it really really real? Or do you need to shapen up my G?
I’m a tree, you know peace be still
The irony of my movement, they eyeing my every movement
The pioneer of the future, another Statik selection
With a dab of perfection
Whether it’s wax in your bong or your eardrum
I’m here now, I’m guessing you live in fear now
So be it, when they speak about the real Soul be it, no debate
Don’t just give ‘em the fish, teach ‘em to fish, let ‘em pro-create Shout out to Joey and ‘em, was dope before the cake
I went from selling records out my record shop
To my record selling out the record shop
That’s a paradox like a pair of yachts

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
It’s hard to be optimistic when Connor’s your opposition
Ain’t no competition, you just a confident contradiction
And what I am in the future, refuse to dispute it
I’ll prove it through music and all you dudes can do is salute it
The most authentic, they get lost in it, I spit raw venom
Jump when I say jump, I feel like Kriss Kross, nigga
Never average, cut from different fabric, fans they never last
My shit’s eternal
Moving so fast that I probably won’t notice a hurdle
Look, Best of the best expect nothing less on my quest
To save the game, I’m walking around like there’s an “S” on my chest
It’s Aftermath out here acting bad, I wave the flag
We the only thing moving, the fuck you go’ say to that?
No lies, all truth, make all you call truce
Watch all just fall off like you tossed off a tall roof
For getting this verse off I paid the cost of the lawsuit
‘Cause I keep hitting them hard with these lines and they all through
Connor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Logic]
Another day another dollar from that 9 to 5
Yeah, you living but ask yourself, are you really alive?
I worked outside, I worked with food, I worked behind the desk
I’ve even hustled around my block, but hold up, I digress
I’ve paid my dues, see this life I didn’t choose
My face on the ten o'clock news, shit I refuse
I was born in a lower class, where gangsters with dough amass
And police would ask questions, but we never answered when asked
Momma bitching while my sister baby daddy cooking crack in the kitchen
Getting rich in the street from slanging prescription
He showed me how to cook it, he showed me how to cut it
But deep down I always knew that life just wouldn’t cut it
So I started writing, it was a dark time
Only fifteen, but the shit I seen would blow your mind
School was getting harder due to my life at home
Principal always calling ‘cause I had barely shown
No father figure, my mother tried her best to be both
But let’s be honest a father really helps with your growth
But I was raised by Nas and Jay-Z and Big L and Eminem
All of them set examples through they lyrics
Listen close so I could hear it, about life and how not to fear it
How to grab the wheel and steer it, and so I
And so I did just that
Word of advice follow your dreams and never look back
I said it’s Logic

[Hook]
[Sample]
What would you give
What would you give in exchange for your soul

[Verse 1: Asaad]
Silencers on my quiet gun
The cruelest nightmares what my life's become
When I say I got bodies know I got more than one
The first time was stupid the second is the important one
Rainy days is special especially when somebody die
Brother's retaliation fueled by a mother's cry
Fuck with me, have your body covered in lye
And I be cheesing hard like I don't know why
I'm blatantly underrated, they hated and labeled crazy
North Philly baby, never turn my back on who made me
And I'm really in the field and Rooski my only mentor now
Niggas ran from me cause they couldn't calm my temper down
Niggas turned their back on me, what's up with all these fake friends?
Only created Saudi Money cause I had to make ends
It only hurts if you caused it and that's the sad part
Parkside mark berry, scary in the dark, what?

[Hook: Asaad]
(What would you give?
What would you give?
In exchange for your soul?)
This that Alejandro Jodorowsky flow
Two accidents in a year, and I survived them though
This that my best man died and I revived him flow
Young God god body move your body flow

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
The black rose that rose out of the asphalt
Probably find a filet mignon in my trash talk
I'm fronting on the black blocks with the black Glock
I never let the mac pop like a laptop
Or lipstick, asshole, dipshit
Cold-hearted, mami move her body on my big stick
Religious rhetoric, spiritual innuendos
Monetary monster, money blowing in the wind though
Peaking out my mentor window, indo burning strong
Circa 1987 Keisha birth a don
Jesus Christ I'm such a pompous pilot
Catch you in the cross-heirs then wash my hands in silence
I still think about prospect from time to time
A lot of my guys did time, I won't cry to God this time
Just take it with a grain of salt like a Margarita
Alien homo sapien, it's nice to meet ya

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
(What would you give?
What would you give?
In exchange for your soul?)
This that Alejandro Jodorowsky flow
Caught that virus when I was ten, but I survived it though
This the love of my life died, I'm still riding though
Young God god body move your body flow
[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Look, my life is like a movie
I’m broke, but almost famous
Meanin the bitches holla, and them niggas be hatin
But all I got is a dolla for the dolla...menu at McDonald's
Fucked up I know this
Its why I get fucked up
Tryna let shit go, like it was stuck
I thank god for the flow, niggas say I’m so real
It it wasn’t for Hip-Hop I’d hang myself with a rope
That’s just how I feel

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Look, my life is like a movie
I'mma keep it real
I came up on Power Rangers and oatmeal
Then it was BET and Internet
Then it was white Adidas and cigarettes
Then it was black and milds and blasphemy
Then it was weed and women’s physical anatomy
Now I dabble in em all
My life style is ill, think I’m wrong?
Fuck you with a condom on
That’s just how I feel

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Listen, my life is like a movie
I guess that means I’m acting
I’m the lion in the zoo; main attraction
It's my time to kill Samuel L Jackson
Easy as ABC, coulda been the 6th Jackson
Ab-Soul the epitome of talent
All started with a mechanical pencil and this yellow tablet
Put my mind to it
Like enemy turf I rhyme light
K Dot on the Ecstasy pill, that’s why I’m nice
That’s just how I feel
[Intro: Will.I.Am]
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh, haha, oh!
Oh, haha, oh!

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
East side, wild city; got my block with me
Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
Death around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
Bring the word like a preacher
Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa
When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like a [warner?]
Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Not  just because you [?] guns
Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
But I was built in [?], in the ghetto (stop)
Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock
I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)
Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)
Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows
Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)
Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods
Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
In full, like ace till momma's straight
And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight
Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
Cause you might need it, more than I
All My Life Remix, brought to you by:

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
This what you doing for town, huh Rock
Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
[?], make the pain get lost
Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
Scream "New West" had everybody pounding
Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
Go to hell, i got records to sell
Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese
You can ask my homie Adolf, he wrecked them niggas in [?]
I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees

[Verse 8: Nipsey Hussle]
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on a block, blue collar wasn't me
My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"
We [?] pick you up and drop you off down the street
And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
But they all ever seem to hear is all red [?]

[Verse 9: Sinful]
Vamos, todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
Long Beach California vecinos de Watts
Mira como abrazo el [?]
Y ahora mira lo que toque, yo
No más pistolas y rosas, no
No más [?] con fácil copas, no
Aprendí si no hay [?] nadie avanza
El barrio nos [?] [chansas] y [los] [planchas]
Amor a las calles, que me criaron a mi
A ese que murió porque me brincaron a mi
Fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocí
Mucha sangre, mucha lágrimas yo lo vi
El esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
El mejor secreto guardado por cierto
Descanso con un ojo despierto
Silencio soy el águila del [?]

[Verse 10: Ya Boy]
I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
I was right there at that corner store
I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
I even had cream, like Rocky Road
I thought getting out the hood was impossible
That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note
If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!

[Verse 11: Roccett]
Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
Got the black bandana with the strap to match
Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
As I rock throwback like the huxtables
Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine

[Verse 12: T.K.]
I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
My whip lean, my shoes clean
Diamond watch, low-key
All sip, mint green
Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas [?] don't fronting me
I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it

[Verse 13: Problem]
(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?
I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all
Look like new waves but I' stuck them home
Niggas want to creep when they think you on
So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!

[Hook]

[Verse 14: Young Keno]
(I feel you Jay)
I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
And even though I moved a little  work
I still suited up for a Sunday at Church
Then back to the block, to diss a few [packs?]
Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
This day and night though, I know it ain't right
But down in the hood, man, this is our life

[Verse 15: Spider Loc]
I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water
Both feet [?] hard on the angle
Hood on the back [?], stars on the ankle

[Hook]

[Verse 16: 211]
Product of the block, young rider from the block
Used to run on 'em niggas, [?] rob them with the Glock
In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
Got my enemies hot, cause I made a [?]
We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
I heard the [?] want me, they gon' have to come and catch it

[Verse 17: Bangloose]
Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping
What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?
I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
I'm so cocky, you wish you could be [Bane?]
You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
Banging you so tight, like a [bike chain?]
You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
Yeah, [?] socks, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 18: Mistah F.A.B.]
Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope
My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!

[Verse 19: Roscoe Umali]
Came from nothing, rose from slums
Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
Half these wack rappers is some good actors
Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta
But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit

[Hook]
[Intro]

Uh, Uh. Yeah yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
When you finally gettin' paid, everything be feelin' great
Went from diggin' in the crates, to chillin', gettin' faded
Don't live a normal life, but I hope you can relate
And it's hard to see it right, blowing smoke in all your faces
Coolin' at the crib, can't believe it's where I live
Can't believe it's what I'm doing, can't believe I got this big
Can't believe this what I'm driving, can't believe this what I'm wearin'
Yeah the Benz is pretty cool, but I need a McLaren
When they see me out in public, dap me up, say what's good
Don't need to take a picture, it's better if you look
Going for your Queen, give a fuck about a rook
Papa was a player; took some pages from his book

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
[X4]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
To the seven telly and it's peanut butter, jelly
Chillin' with da homies, smoking weed and watching Belly
Headin' to the deli, rollin' with some Pirelli's
Now I'm gettin' money like 2001 Nelly
They wanna take my photo, my finger in my nose though
Dutch's from the Cogos
Playin' water polo
Above the ozone, young Han Soulo
You start rapping and I'm like no no no no no, no
Do you get it? Tell me can you feel it
I'm only gonna get a bottle from you if you steal it
Time on this money, money all the time
Lookin at me funny cause your money in decline

[Hook]

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Big bank won't throw loans or free things
Stack that dough, go get yo paypuh!
Dividends could devastate ya
Make it right don't let it play yeah
Big bank won't throw loans or free things
Stack that dough, go get yo paypuh!
Dividends could devastate ya

Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I know exactly how it is to feel like no one cares
About the hard work you put in but who said life was fair?
It sure wasn't me I take the bitter with the sweet
And boil it in the pot make a hot toddy
I said If I'm going to play I'm going to play for keeps
Raise stakes, take stage, speak my peace
Make my pay, take my lady on a date
Send my parents on a cruise
Living, somewhere with a killer view, oh the irony I spew
But for now the studio couches gonna have to do
I ain't going to take what I ain't earned myself, foolish pride
That's what you need to survive, it's do or die
So step aside I don't mean no trouble
Just want to be someone that CJ could look up to
Oh, and just so you know
When I'm on the road I'm at the Travelodge not The W

[Hook]
Almost there, almost there, almost there
The finish line is in sight but I'm almost there, almost there, almost there
Almost there, almost there, almost there
Even if the sun don't shine the sun don't shine, almost

[Verse 2]
Somebody asked me, what you mean by longterm mentality, actually?
So I had to break it down:
Don't get caught up in the now, focus on the years abroad
Cause today you're here but tommorow you could be gone
Singing the same old song
And who's the place to blame on? Other than you
Whatever it is you do
From slanging eight balls to graduating from school
Just gotta see it all before it happens
I ain't saying see a psychic
I'm just saying have a, idea of what you're accomplishing
You'll have a greater chance to accomplish it
You know a little strategy, premeditation
Wins races nine times out of ten
As if losing's ever an option
Had to bust my own bubble I really thought I was popping (Not quite)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Just know your future's right around the corner
Oppurtunity galore for ya
More and more you'll start to see it's no limit to what you can be
In any event, eventually
Treat your first like your last time
Cause it might be your last time, that's what I learned last time
Look forward to looking forward in my pastime
You just letting time pass like "that's fine" as wine
Contrary to popular belief, I want the peace
They say I'm headed hellbound at God's speed
Gesundheit, or bless me if you like
As I, put my faith in this bud and budlight
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
Talk my shit, drop my load on
Hold on, I don't think you know how close I am
By the time this song's done I'm already there
