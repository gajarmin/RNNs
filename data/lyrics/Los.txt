[Intro]
It's a war going on
It's a war going on
Yeah, it's a war going on

[Post-Hook]
God told me this movie will write itself
Spread love, be wise and let foolery fight itself

[Hook]
Cause it's a war going on outside on the corner
It's a war on your TV screen every morning
Not the war with the bombs and the helicopters swarming
But the war for your soul, that's what everyone's ignoring
It's a war going on
Yeah, it's a war going on

(I was just talking to the homie the other day man)

[Verse 1: King Los]
He said I'mma pump this fuckin' caine, pump this fuckin' caine
Hug this block, tote this fuckin' Glock, all you suckas lame
This my spot, this my fuckin' spot, you know what I rep
I go deep on in my way up from a kilo on that step
Tell the death, yeah I mean the death, let that pistol talk
You say truce, me speaking no english, bitch go get some heart
Fuck the law, nigga fuck the law, they can see me too
Fuck a school, and the teacher too, they don't teach the truth
What's a pops, never had a pop, let that ratchet pop
I'm too real, gave a fiend a pill for a Magnavox
Man fuck we got, fuck we really got, but this gutter shit
All my niggas hug the strip and all my bitches love to strip
So suck a dick, I got kids, and a baby mama too
Yeah she work my fucking nerves like a baby mama do
I be stressed, I be hella stressed, smoke a bunch of weed
High for real, pop the pill and drop the Xanny in my lean
I can scream, cause you just smile like everything is fine
Hope is fun, when I grab my gun, come take your life or mine
Suicide, yeah it's suicide, life is suicide
Fuck your right or wrong, the shit that I been on is do or die
If I do I die, if I don't I die that's suicide
Got the devil with a gun against my brain like choose a side

[Hook]
[Post-Hook]

[Verse 2: King Los]
I love the hood with my whole heart
It whole heartedly been a part of me in my own thought
Process so I digest through my own art
That I'm blessed though I digress due to slow starts
But who else could bring the hood out
And tell 'em when they let God in, it brings the good out
Learn a lesson and listen, my current composition concerns your present condition
And turn direction envision of givin' blessings and wishin' you well
Well wishing and tales fishing
Siftin' through hell's kitchen to find good
Have a God-like mind as the divine should
Define good within yourself I think the time's good
And may these lines live forever like a line should
It's a war going on and your soul fighting
So frightening within you I see thunder and both lightening
Boat striking, snow ice and hail
Your whole life unfold like, cold nights in Hell
In a mode like, you're feeling low like, like you don't like yourself
You got no sight, no insight, no foresight, that's the shit that your foes like
Run up on a nigga get 'em froze like
Put the 4-4 to his foes like
Niggas 'bout to take a pic, trying to get the pose right
Red dot, headshot, hit 'em close like
Like, like all theses niggas I've got to shoot one
Fuck one, plus I'm cocking two guns
Fuck shoe money, I'm coppin' coupes son
No y'all niggas not 'bout to do none
Guns, that's a way of life, get money not God
You got guns, we got bigger guns, go get one and I ride
If I die, they say I went hard, I go super hard
Bitch you with this shits or not? We gon' get this loot or starve?
Fuck you doing? Writin' in a pad, fuck you making songs
What you rappin', boy you know what's happ'nin', that shit take too long
Fuck you mean? Get this fucking cream, get this fucking cream
Hug this block, tote this fucking Glock, can't let these suckers scheme
Shit too real, shit too fucking real, I'm too real to dream
So when it's -- [gunshots] --this cold world won't feel a thing

[Outro: Marhsa Ambrosius]
Lonely days are gone
All them nights to come
Waited to be yours
So let's make love not war
So let the choir sing the let 'em know
So let the choir sing the let 'em know
So let the choir sing the let 'em know
Whoa...
Ayo my alphabetic arsenal and awesome arithmetic
Are actually attributes adding artistic apprenticeship
Absolutely a animal,accurately articulate, academically acrobatic
Attaching a apparatus, advancing attacking average assasins and agonizing
Antagonist analyzing analytical analyst, analysis, algebraic astrologist
Approximately assile accomplished archaeologist anatomically agile
Asesive aberration, abrasive application, abandoned, I'm straight A's listen
I beat the mic like Vike and Lia, treat the mic like Ike and Tina
Feed a dyke my pipe then leave her, see the ice on the bright then clean her
Jesus Christ Sway I'm like a fever, I'm on fire
I blaze the place, make sure my waves is straight
Then play the custom make beige and grape bathing apes
If you on fire ima smash your single
Cause I'm tryna' get Starbucks, and I don't mean cappuccino
While you sleep ima hold the pistol, under your nose
And watch it wake you up like its Folgers crystal
Better get your things scratched together
When I battle it's a show, so I'm dropping ten stacks or better
I'm the best nigga, you got nerve
If I pop my trunk, it B2Ks then you got served
See I gotta keep the fifth and his twin brother
Packing up heat, to turn Michael his original skin color
Bitches call me papi, I give em the pipe
I got the sickest charm rocky frigid with ice
And my six is all cocky, kidded with pipes
New edition like Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike
Yeah the call me the squad killa
Everything I say is hot
Sway I spit flames harder than Godzilla
Got a gun named Moses
I'm in the club with it
Cause it could part the red C, on your cubs fitted
I embarrass the smashing man
Ayo sway I'm on fire the like the american flag back in Pakistan
Run in your trap and imma bang you in it
And leave stiff like you just put on your jacket man look
Don't send the shook type to challenge me
My whole crew full of stars, so from a far we look like a galaxy
I ain't bigger than anybody, skinny in the big body
But when I spit I feel like big in a skinny body
Cig in a mini shotty
Dig for them digits papi
Before I pop and leave your wig and your fitted sloppy
I'm a motherfucking giant how a midget top me
Mini me ass niggas copy but spit it sloppy
Son of a gun, I think the fifth did adopt me
And named me time, cause nothing in this bitch could stop me
I distribute on the block, when I pivot watch me
I'm in the drop, how you riding in a civic cocky
Man the chicks I poke would grab your cash up
And the shit y'all smoke I rather pass up
Rules to the block, don't ever change
I'm way out of your range
You a canoe I'm a yacht, I'm a zoo you a fox
You a cube I'm a box, I'm a jewel you a rock, listen
Niggas couldn't last in my trenches
The wrath of my vengeance is drafted in the dramatic craft of my sentence
I'm a bastard who's illest, disastrous limits, sporadic, maniac rapper
Matched with a chemist, attached with Olympic spectacular swag in my image
A tactical menace administer massive afflictions
I had a vision a prediction, a vast premonition
Of cashing the tradition of my last intuition
I grasp with precision I've mastered division in math to add addition
If it clashed with decision, sway I've had it with this shit
I'm sick of battling babbling graduates in fad of a battered arithmetic
Vigorous heart, I'm ridiculous smart, your intelligence ends
Where my curriculum starts, centripetal force of art multiplied by thought
Equals the action of a fraction of describing my part
I'm the critical, criminal, political pinnacle
You're a minimal, minuscule, cynical interlude
I will finish diminish you the minute you send it through
I'm the Dennis the Menace of the minute you sin in too
I replenish the sentence with a pen in the interview
Entered Guinness for hindering pretendness and ripping dudes
Reversible progression, plus I stayed on beat like I just got took off
For a personal possession
This verse is just a lesson for the service and the question
And I'm purposely addressing, niggas searching for direction
Scar told me, death ain't nothing but birth in reverse
If you end up hurting me first, I throw the hearse in reverse
Then inverse this verse in reverse, without rehearsing it first
Illest nigga alive I put these jerks in the dirt
My verse 2, hurt you worse than my verse do
But my verse 3, that's way worse than my verse 2
So to verse me, that's revert in a virtue
Remember when i spit that verse in reverse
That verse is killing me
Who wanna be the first to adverse my versatility, nigga feel me
I say I'm hotter than a devil with a fever, wearing a leather and a beater
And a sweater while he eating a jalapeno fajita
With a book bag full of heat pads, with a skully on and a ski mask
With the heat on, in an E-class, at Exxon with a speed pass
I'm rippin and runnin and grippin the tech
And one of these labels gon give me your check
If you giving me products I'm giving you yen
If I did it, I done it so give me respect KING
[Hook: French Montana]
I see you niggas from the side watchin'
Got a hundred grand in my side pocket
All the hustlers love it, you know I speak the lingo
Tell a bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Face down, ass up
Pull up in that spaceship with that top down
Bitch pass out, chain light up, they blackout
I'm like "haaanh," Ocho Cinco, that's a head-banger
I see a bitch lookin' thirsty, told her go and drink up
I head hunt, that new nigga, and what
Shorty got that ocho, good head, and butt I'm like "haaanh"
All I got for bitches is pipe water
I done came up off a night order

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Bitch gave me head till my legs shake (burrr)
She gave me the brain, but that doesn't explain
Why these lames be lovin' and cuffin' these bitches
I don't know shit about 'em but they head shape
Fuck that pussy 'til her legs break
Bustin', got a dirty dozen of them brown things
Waitin' in a room like an egg crate, uhh
B-A-D boy ho
And I got B-A-D bitches for my boys so
Treat 'em like pollo, serve 'em, black Suburban
Swervin' through the hood, gettin' head like turbans
Any job a good job, so she got a blowjob
Suckin' it from nine to five, that bitch workin'
Kells

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Los]
Man I say pimps up, hoes down
I say that to say that I only recognize these bitches
With they limbs up, or from the nose down
I tell her nose dive, then watch 'em go down
Bitch I'm cold as ice water
Put dick way down your throat until your eyes water
Lemme get that for you, lil mama cause you workin'
The way you twerkin', you gon' fuck around and get a Birkin
She like to crack the dutch down the middle, drop a purp in
Let me fuck her in the telly, screaming open up the curtains like
(Don't stop! Pop that, pop that!)
You know French cut, she got on French cuts
I don't French kiss, I let my friends cut
Me and Red in an all red Benz truck

[Verse 4: Red Cafe]
I told French, I told Los, I get good head while I'm chauffeured
Momma told me, "get a nice girl with a good head on her shoulders"
Shake down, shake down, came up on them back blocks
Her face on my belt buckle, that's what I call laptop
Side niggas from the side watchin', guess they got a side view
Puff got me in this penthouse, that's my view
That's my crew, they shinin'
She only came so she could come, boss
And her first choice was the number one boss

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Diddy]
Yo bitch, I'm a motherfuckin' livin' legend
I'm 'bout to send these niggas through they fifth depression
In my absence niggas speaking silly
I could stand on the mountains and the streets'll feel me
Feel the rush and that Bad Boy
OBG that OG, don't OD cause that's bad boy
She feel royal when she 'round this
King Combs, now give me crown, bitch
[Produced by Boi-1da, Matthew Burnett, and Jordan Evans]

[Verse 1: King Los]
To recognize the genius I am
You'd have to have one foot on Venus to even visit these arenas I'm in
Now did I say arenas or Serena's?
I kill shit, Venus/Serena's, I kill shit, I Gilbert Arenas
I'm ill wit' the skill wit', the skill wit'
If this the shit that I build
When I'm buildin' a buildin' built with a billion builders
That's buildin' a buildin' on top of this one
No feelin' is toppin' this one
No villain is stoppin' this one
That'd be a dark night, won't it?
While overlookin' my city, had a Dark Knight moment
I'm overlookin' my city, same city that overlooked me
Now it's back to back tours, cause cities just overbook me
Speaking of Dark Knight, I know some jokers that scheme
Cuz I done blew up somethin' sick like the openin' scene
Not to mention, nobody gon mention you this year
You just a joker, I really made the pencil disappear
I got that Edgar Allen Poe flow, bars like a bear trap
Shakespeare's only rebuttal would be a head scratch
I haven't been amateur, ever, never
Iambic pentameter, clever, better
Nobody even seems this deep
I got niggas stayin' awoke to put my dreams to sleep
But, watch me maneuver
New maroon drop for my jewel
I need moon rocks for my mule, I'm the future
Tell these niggas I need my proper spot
They a bunch of Papa Docs and Chocolate Drops
My 16's proper, give me my props or not
I went Pac at 16 when my Pops was shot
Uh, it left my mind out of place
I guess that's why in my rhymes, I spend time out of space
So, I speak life, rappers talk
Can't be a rap god if you've never rapped for God
Gotta be close to him like the woman in The Bible who felt she could be blessed just to grab his cloth
Uh, bulletin: we full of sin
If we wade in the water, the weight of it might pull us in
They, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Can't fake what you ain't, ain't, ain't, ain't
Wait, if you're searchin' for a way, wait
I made a way, all my homies used to weigh weight
Brakes, pump your brake, brake, brake, brakes
My niggas break in and take, they don't take breaks
I can't fail, I don't believe in it
You don't possess humble nor obedience
Comedians told me that I wouldn't fly
I remember losin' family members and I wouldn't cry
Nigga if you had wooden eyes
You could see I'm fly in my future, so why wouldn't I?
I'm too good, these niggas good and high
Boys in the hood don't rock wit' you Cuba Goodin' guys
Niggas on that "be alike" shit
Guess they "copy, paste" us cause we the right clique
Uh, get it? Right click, copy, paste?
Life hit a rocky phase, ice wrist, Versace shade
White whip, a hockey blade, grill like a hockey mask
Chop it like a hockey stick, niggas pop it to pocket cash
Talkin' bout you poppin' gas, runnin' wit' those sloppy cats
Same suckas probably be watchin' you get your pockets tapped
Fuck all that cocky shit, where I'm from they cocking straps
Think you wavy 'til you get hit with 8 in your stocking cap
But, I choose to excel
Made my old ex mad, gave my new ex hell
Went from no X to one X to two X, well
I been nice since my tee shirt was 2XL
Yeah that's XX, like two exes ago
But it's still all love like X's and O's
Cause at some point, we feel we have exes who owe
You know an explanation why they made an exit, and oh
If you think I'm talkin' bout my exes, come on, man
Tell XXL they got one more chance
But, man I lay low
If I ain't on ya list, then that bitch don't exist, Manti Te'o
I'm anti A-roll, that shit they puttin' up corny
Tell these niggas they ain't good enough to bore me
I'm just paintin' so y'all see the story
I can't be guarded in rap, to God be the glory
King

[Verse 2 - Los]
She said “Los, come fuck me and my BFF
Boy you put a spell on me”
Last night I came between
Best friends like jealousy
Fuck you telling me?
Fuck with my cake I’ll bomb you
We beef over that cheese
You gonna think I’m making lasagna
You ain't no G neither
I’m from where the D.E
Will take a quarter off your back
And turn you to a receiver
Maybe if these rappers
Study me they wouldn’t be lame
I flips this muthafucka
Like a mattress with a pee stain
I got 24 bars that say you not
Great but only dropped half a 16
You still got ate
[Intro: Los]
You can't
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Hook: Los and Ty Dolla Sign]
We ain't trippin' cause them lames
Mind your business, get your change, can't fade us
Nah, nah, they can't fade us
You can't fade us

[Verse 1: Los]
Hold up, um, I whip a two to an eighth
I fuck the one not the two, stick a few in the safe
I'm slippin' through the Wraith
Can't get this shoe in a states
Nigga, you're in the way, your bitch a two in the face
I rock yellow gold, fuck hella hoes
Rock Maison Martin Margiela clothes
I tell a ho like I'm sellin' O's
Look, once I bag it I let it go
I floss up with the top off, I boss up like the top office
This bitch hop off of ya knockoffs
We make movies, no box office
I slide off with a brunette, wake up with a few blondes
My hoes do Louboutins, your hoes do futons
Ride with no roof on
If I hit, my man hit like we buy hoes on Groupons
Let me fuck you to my new song

[Bridge: Ty Dolla Sign]
I'm a beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho
Beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho

[Hook: Los and Ty Dolla Sign]
We ain't trippin' cause them lames
Mind your business, get your change, can't fade us

You can't fade us

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
They can't fade us, can't fade us

[Verse 2: Los]
I don't scoop a groupie, unless she got a floosie wit' her too
They'll Daffy Ducky you to come and get Goofy with the crew
Naw, my shoe ain't Gucci, but I'm Gucci with the shoe
Yeah, there's bodies in my trunk and my roof be in it too
I got nine hustles I'm tryin' to juggle to make the profit double
You try to jungle, I'll hit your head, do my time humble
Squad tight, they talk white like Bryant Gumbel
Count the money, no time to duffle
I paper bag it, drop the top, I paper tag it
Got a new Glock and I'm laser taggin'
I made it happen like two blondes, woke up with a brunette
My favorite things; new shoes, new sex, new checks
We all got on V-necks, but you should do the crew next
Ooh, yes, give me head first like a suplex
Cause I just wanna

[Bridge: Ty Dolla Sign]
I'm a beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho
Beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla Sign]
Beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah
If that thing fat, go on, shake it
You ain't camera shy, take a picture, trick
I'm just tryin' to come through a visit when you ain't busy
You got your homegirls, I got my homeboys wit' me
We them boys from the city, yeah, I run my city
And when I come to your hood, I got some real ones with me
Yeah, I've been grindin' all day and night
Tryin' to make sure I get it right
Get her tight, make it go "good night"

[Intro]
Uh, King, Zero!
I got it

[Verse 1]
You are now havin' your sandwich made
With extra mayonnaise, 808's, and a hand grenade
Cause any man could get played in my all in phase
I mean my flow pass words like the log in page, ugh
See how my last words do?
I put my log in your girl cause we past words too
Your BM sent me a DM and you be chasin' that hooker
You steady stalkin' her Twitter, she gave me face when I booked her
She treat me like the Facebook logo, now that's a true slut
In other words, she f'in blew me cause I f'in blew up
Acknowledge my knowledge is polished, cowards get power dropped
Man my flow could make a suicide pilot apologize
I'm piling guys in a pile, a pile of guys on they pals
I silently swear I'll kill'em, I'm finalizing my vows
I'm shitting on them, I’m vitalizing my bowels
Like I took a vitamin, something vital lies in my bowels
Im the truth times two, I ain't inviting lies you should bow
(Paow, paow, paow) I'm taking shots in the dark
While taking shots of the dog I'm taking shots at your thoughts
You can take these shots from a vet while I'm taking shots at your dogs
They gon' have to have me shackled and tackled at tabernacles
While havin' my adam's apple detached in a baptist chapel
Attacked by the fastest travelin' javelin'
While attached to a dragon dragging a cage; these niggas gon' trap me
And while I'm laughing, I'm lappin' 'em, they collapse as I'm passin' 'em
Man I'm coming with the K, like they lackin' Potassium
I'm Jordan from the free throw while every frame is in slow mo
And every fan in the stands got they head in they hands like "oh no"
Somebody get the promo, so somebody flick the photo
And somebody stitch the logo, I'm bodying this shit bro bro
Get it? You don't get it? My nigga, you gotta get it
I'm bodying this shit, his logo had his whole body in it
Oh my Ice tea, coco, ice cube, vanilla ice
Tom Cruise and Vanilla Sky, tell these guys that I'm hella nice, right
When I spit, it tear wind, the air bend
I'm wicked son, these niggas buns like hair pins
Amateurs, I scientifically handle bars
And you just Jodie, putting bikes together in your man's garage
Damn it dog, I fold this guy
I ain't talking 'bout no rapper, I said "fold the sky" nigga
In half and disperse the worse grin
As I write a verse in reverse that reverses the earth spin
You worse than a scared nigga who popped the thing off then flee
I got a flow that can lock in and knock the wings off a flea
Yeah I'm a King, I'm elite I could never dream of defeat
I could Dr. King you a speech while I'm Rodney Kinging ya beat
You playing the victim nigga, I'm saying the vicious scriptures
You niggas is in denial like you bathe in Egyptian rivers
I wrote this in Hieroglyphics, I'm focused and I am gifted
I hope that I just provoked you to notice that I am different
I feel so blessed I should mention, I pushed the depths of extension
Much higher my type of talent requires special attention
Kendrick I think you genius, J. Cole got these niggas worried
Big K.R.I.T. is a southern killer, Wale is a visionary
Pusha been pushing so long he truly defines a hustler
Meek did his time like a G, came back home and shined on them suckas
A$AP mastered the facets of fashion
Snatching the essence of brandin' his whole fam and a no man demanding a presence
This nigga Drake nice on the mic and act
So many hits he fucked around and brought light skin back
And Big Sean you did it, you really did it, no bullshitting
You putting the D on I could see the future, no Warwick
Get it? Dion Warwick, I went to war with critics like Jay Elec'
I let him see my exhibit, get it? Exhibit C
I exquisitely make a segue down to Tyler, my future's odd, I salute you dog
Mac Miller, young white boy track killer, gotta feel that
I think real rap back, nigga
King...
Yeah…
Yeah. We like to call this, the Ten Minute Million Dollar Massacre. And ya’ll niggas ‘bout to see why. BLOC Gang its ya boy LoS. Easy...
Look
Listen
[Purple Rain- Beanie Sigel]
I had to pay a visit to my diva, “Set It Off” like Jada, Vivica, Latifah
I’m in that GT, with the fly sneakers, and this a top model like Eva
And we could pop bottles like we the San Antonio Spurs, if a nigga want beef, the cannon's under the fur
If you say you want beef and you stand up under your word, your man’ll put brandy onto the curb, but the herb…
It got my eyes low, and make me ride slow, I keep the hydro, lit like a pyro, this how I try ho!
I’m goin’ big places bitches you try and go
But we can kick it like Taebo, I know, ya heard it all before, but you never pushed convertible Azzures
Tryna get you out that skirt and then them drawers, and pull back the curtain ‘cause the view is just perfect of the shore
I’m perfect and I’m sure
For certain, and the merkin’ is for sure
Kill the smirkin’ when I’m burstin’ in the door
I’m worser than before
I’m worser than them verses I beversed without rehearsin’. It’s for certain I’m the boar

It’s curtains for these whores, tryna work me, tryna jerk me, I'mma score
This is urgency, I burgundy your floor
Throw my mercy on the court, I’m like Worthy on the court
Ye ain’t worthy of my sport I wake up early in the morn’ then I’m gone
They should call me “over the fence” I choose offense over defense
Plus I run niggas home, like a home run over the fence
So run home before homes jump over the fence
I’m in that Rover with tens, bumpin’ that HOVA and Cris
-stopher Wallace, my cliques the wildest, I’m a soldier ya bitch
Momma show me them tits, I got that MO AND THAT CRIS
They names was Chrissy and Mo, so sip some more of that crisp, switch!

Now I’m crawlin’ through the window of your crib, while you’re playin’ Nintendo with ya kids, what it is?
I hear niggas got a lot to say
I’m tryna make it to the top, they tryna block the way
I put Chronic on the block, like I’m Dr. Dre
My niggas got that blow out, like they Docta J. I was told the cockle spray…

Aim that fuckin' ratchet, Hold it, load it, toad it, and choke it, made in fuckin’ basses
Blow they ass to smitherines, ‘til it ain’t enough of caskets
Tech’ll make such a mess, you can’t clean it up with napkins
Sicker than mixin’ liquor with angel dust and asprin
I’m cool as a motherfucker, but I’m dangerous when rappin’
Niggas thats on the block, they masters slingin’ bustin’ trappin’. Getting money, if you think that you could hang with us, I’m laughin’. Yeah, it’s funny
See money rule the world, I don’t know what it do to girls, for them diamonds jewels and pearls
Break it down like: Is it the money that’s makin’ em feind for the shit that they know we could probably screen?
A lot of the ______________________________
Maybe that was too fast for you so just let me slow it down
If you didn’t know I was the shit well now you know it now

I gotta hold it down, my city right behind me
We rockin’ tanks and kapris, homie we like it grimy
We live that life of crimies
Hold two gats like they Siamese, eyes runnin like we Chinese
Look you know where to find me
B.A.L.T. to the I. Need I say MORE? Heat to the sky
Pop with with you, and then we rockin’ jewels so what we gotta do to get a piece of the pie?
Real G’s gon’ ride when shit get big
We comin’ and dumpin’ them flips and shit
You dummin’ to something your whip ain’t shit
I’m stuntin’ in something ridiculous

Do you know what this is? I do this shit to live
Nigga these clips are spare, I don’t need no witnesses
This fit for hit your head, get shots’ll split your wig
Til your brains on the fishin graves. Rockin blue you fit the crib
Bang and Rang, what up with you blood? I ain’t claimin’ nothin’ but the crew love
Bloc clique shit, I fucks with true thugs
Knew a lot of niggas that wasn’t too tough
Now it’s bloody murder and ammunition when hammer’s clickin’ niggas runnin’ pockets with potem problems we’re bangin’ out
Plus I’m burnin’ for recognition, they jammin’ cause this shit is gonna cockin we’re watchin’ plottin’ and hangin’ out
It ain’t a doubt, that’s that’s shit that you feel
Shit that you love is that shit that you real
This shit is the shit with explicitly skill
Terrific, exquisite, exhibit you bitch
My niggas, they ditch if we’re snitches you bitch
They clap with the mac, for they’ll scratch if you itch
Forgettin’ you peoples, and sleep with the fish
They fear me, you hear how I’m freakin this shit?

We deep in this bitch, my peeps in this bitch, I don’t wanna hear a peep in this bitch
Please! Tell Money stop grillin’ I ain’t peepin’ his bitch
And even if I creep, I ain’t keepin’ his bitch
I represent the streets in this bitch, the project life, the plush presidential suites in this bitch
Ya’ll niggas lookin’ sweet in this bitch- pause
I guess I got a little wrapped up in my bars
I play with the flow, like a cat to a mouse
Right before he kill it, then it’s back to the house
I’m in the lack with the pouch, some call em pokeouts
I hop out and choke out the nigga that got the choke out

Then get smoked out
My niggas loke (look) out
You still wipin’ off your sneakers, we pull boats out
To get in your folks house, pull the bolts out of the door
Pull up with guns, nigga pull the coat out of the floor
When I pull the stroke, out of your whore
She like damn LoS, what you don’t got it no more?
I’m like damn ho, what you don’t get it no more?
You get it once and you don’t get it no more
Ho why would she get it now, if that hooker ain’t get it before
I get it down, like a Jeep, you inconsiderate whore!

Get in some shit with your bore, I’m finna get it for sure
I’m finna rip me a tour
I’m finna kick that is ore
Look if rappin don’t work, I’m finna flip me some raw
You finna attempt me c’mon. I’m finna dip from the law
I’m finna get me this little bitch that finna give me some jaw
I’m finna pent me a broad. You finna attempt to be hard
You finna wile like you a problem, but you fit to be solved
I’m finna figure if my four-fifth’ll fit in this jar

Motivation every time I sit in them cars
Feel the plush leather seats, and keep spittin’ them bars
Hit your broad to get some brain she like The Wizard of Oz
Hold on my pivot on the block I can’t wikit with starve
I mean we’re starving for the scratch I’ll scratch these bitch niggas off
Til I’m flying in a plane like I’m too big for the car
With the wheel scrape on the wells cause they too big for the car
Put this cig to your jaw. Man I’m sick of the yard!
Oh yeah this nigga is raw, like Eddie Murphy in leather
Hear my voice on these tracks, don’t they go perfect together?
I could merk it whenever, workin I’m certainly clever
I am perfectly better, I will irk you for cheddar
Got the worstest vendetta, that a nigga could have
So sit down, if you can’t stand me getting’ this cash
Man I get in this ass, call me wedgie, no webbie
Screamin’ give me that pussy, push me to pull out this dezzie
In the truck with a lezzie, Jewels cut to the bezzie
Play the grip for the slippers, a few bucks for the Chevy
This is nothing, I’m ready
Niggas bluffin’ and petty
Pop my trunk and grab my bump, turn his guts to spaghetti
I’m feeling tougher than Pesci

Feeling lucky? Don’t push me
Pull your skirt for what it’s worth; you get fucked in your pussy
Nigga don’t hush me and shush me I’m talkin’ loud for a reason
You a punk and you jump up, then you’re down for a beatin’
You hear the sound of the beat, and you just start poundin’ your feet
When the pussy niggas ridin’ by, duckin’ down in the seat
You can tell they being rebellious from the sound of the feet
They in the pool with a fool, they ‘bout to drown in the deep
See this is shake ‘em, I’m a wake ‘em, and then clown ‘em for sleepin’
When that pound get to squeakin, they get found in the Reapin
Holdin this own and its leakin, lay him down for the weekend
Movin ground when I’m speakin, don’t wanna be around when I’m geekin
Welcome to hell nigga peekin. What I’m gon tell to the deacon?
When you catch shells in your beacon like what the hell he was sleepin
Guess the devil could meet him
Guess the reaper could greet him
Like I need to defeat him, as I proceed to delete him
This the key to your freedom
Feed ‘em the D.E. and heat ‘em, beat ‘em leave ‘em bleedin and blind, barely breathin and dying
That nigga dying like withering wheat
Im in exerting energy just shiver and they’ll speak
Yo! ___ is deep
So I fall in the page, silently swear to keep it real wit ya’ll for all of my days
Back in school, you can catch me in the hall with my haze
Bitch you ain’t hittin this blunt, why you all in my face?
Ya’ll niggas call us and race, im bout to lap you and pass you
Anybody in my way, fuck the hassle I’ll clap you
See me I razzle and dazzle, cuz im fresh like “Uh”
Hangin out the window, banging that tech like “uh.”
You stumble when you catch one in your neck like “uh”

Cuz im walkin like a man, my finger on the trigger
Pocket full of money, im a Baltimore nigga
Call the law nigga, this is murda- first degree
These niggas buggin, they don’t wanna trade a verse with me
Adversin me is a-a-additional adversity, I add verbs for free
But don’t think my adverbs are free, cuz im a pro now
I reflip the prefix to metaphors and pronouns
Shorty slow down, its bout to go down. And any nigga who don’t know, he bout to know now

See no clown gon stop my shine. Long as I got my 9 and my block im fine
I know niggas gotta drop sometimes, that’s how it be cuzzin
I can stop my grind just cuz the streets buzzin
Cuz when the heat bust in, niggas’ll scatter
And if anybody ran em then what nigga is badder?
It ridiculous chatter, real niggas call it ho talk
That’s the way that hoes talk, that’s the path that I don’t walk
So don’t squawk, when I run up with the beat either
Squeeze the D.E. and leave three in your cheap beater
I cheap the sweep jeeber until I get nice
And it ain't stress or nothing homie its just life!

Cuz im the slick type
Pose-in-the-whip type
Clothes-in-the-flip type
Put-hoes-on-the-strip type
We need a broke type
Neighborhood joke type
Bullshit smoke type
Can't flip coke like damn
I thought he was the man
I thought he had a plan
I thought he was movin grams
Lemme give him a hand (clap clap clap)
He about to get his fucking man (clap clap clap)
In his van (clap clap clap)
And his fam (clap clap clap)
Damn I smashed that track
I ain't even started motherfucker im retarded
I ain't even lyin man, I ain't even tryin damn
This jungle music, im the king of the lion fam
I ain't playin my stilly’ll killy you
Im off the hizzy fashizzy nizzy im really ill

I like the billyill of my hat to be really low
The feel skillyills of these rest could really blow
They like the wheelios on my lat cuz they really glow
I keep it trilly with these bitches and silly hoes

No really though, go and roll that philly ho
Hit my nigga on the jizzer- like what the dealio?
Here we go. Grad some drank, I’ll grab some smoke, we’ll mix ‘em both
Get some hoes and switch your clothes
Jizzy grab that chris and mo!
I attract the biggest hoes, cuz I attack with a vicious flow
Ride in the back and my wrist is froze and on my back is the slickest clothes. Yo!

You know that nigga Los?
Yeah man, that nigga dope
Nah man that nigga broke
Look man im sick of folks
The first prick I poke- imaa leave the knife in him. Twist it counterclockwise then ask him if he like livin
It got a rusty blade on it, so its like venom
But itll turn you boys to men, like Mike Bivins
Ya’ll like kittens, when the Pitbull come
Blow up, empty your clip for fun
Lets live more tongue. These chicks lick dick for fun big clip, spit clips for fun
And by the time your boy done, its gonna be ugly
But…(you, and you, and you, and you, and you gon, you gon, you gon, you gon, you gon, you gon you gonna love me…..
[KING LOS]
Uhh
I wish you all good fortune as well as foresight
This Rollie on my forearm forcing my Porsche lights
Then reflect, reflecting back to that porch light
When it was on, we was on the steps we was taught like
It's so symbolic to follow steps to be taught right
I leave the court like Jordan
See the court like Kid
I seen kids leave the court like, life
I can see the pain of your father's past
I can see the pain that your father passed
I can see your pain 'cuz my father passed
The same pain I had to see further past
Your father had a chance to take you further but your father passed
It's a present in your past
That's present from the presence of your past
It presents itself here in the present
Just don't look past it you got to catch it
Speaking of catching the essence of being caught
Perfectly captures the lessons that being taught
Be it in thought or in deed, Indeed it weighs on us
I’m praying for us, I know they preying on us
Keep no pride in your heart
Let hope rise cause pride pried us apart
Logic and thought consistency with obedience
Time and humble and selfless acts lead the leadership
Lead the ship, be a captain or capsize
Suckers hate cause I up the case like the caps lock
No back space, I'm from the back block
It’s like I hit the space bar on that black drop, ughh
The whack watch but the wise learn
And jealousy will make your best friends' eyes burn
Why turn? Nigga it was our turn
Now a nigga gotta catch the fade like some side burns
The love of money will get niggas on your side burnt
That’s why its wise to sever ties before the tides turn
Apply my ethics, my efforts unmatched
I open doors from my city and left 'em unlatched
Run that, they rob niggas bare face until they face a bear and feel bare look in their face, Uhh
The rare tapes of the incredible
These miracles you can't pencil in on a schedule
Conceptual, exceptional, exception to the rule yes the truly intellectual
Cool introspective of a dude in a confessional
Move, peep the moves of the grooviest professional
I’m blessing you
Seek freedom break free from whatever stressing you
Try to gather the rest without letting em have the best in you
I wish the best for you but it’s probably the worst for you
Shit might not even work for you
Is it worth it to
Be giving my gift if its like a curse to you
Try to write this in cursive too without picking a pen up
Then sign it sincerely yours
The man that has many flaws but master picking his chin up, King
Uh, jumped off a building
Landed on a chick that was Brazilian
I don't know, I just made a million
I'm thinking about dealing
Or making another dealing
I'm thinking about willing
Or making another willing
They gon' have to get Batman
They making another villain
I was chilling
Now everything I'm concealing
Is being exposed
When I reload and unload
These dudes gon' lose control
Oh - remember Control that I did over that one beat
I don't give a fuck nobody can sit in Sun's seat
Cause that's the throne
I su seeked the throne
Sun seeks the throne
Now Sun eats your own
Hold on, break it down
I'm about to take it down
Earthquake flow, my shit can shake the ground
They don't understand me, me and Sway gon' shake the town
And anybody in my way I'mma shake 'em down
It's about to happen
I'm on full blasting
On Captain
Niggas can't stop me
How they blocking
I'm blacking out
Hold on nigga I'm zapping out
I don't understand what's happening
These niggas's backing out
Since Mace and Puffy
They can't face me
They way too bluffing
I don't give a fuck I'm like stuffing
Inside your chick
And I'm rocking I'm ripping
These niggas ain't getting what I'm saying
I'm Mike, you Pippen, it's different
On a mic I'm ripping, you slipping
I'm Michael back sliding
Moon Walking
You coons talking
Nobody is happening
My platoon awesome I'm awesome
I assume [?] will happen
Every time I flow know what's going on
I don't give a fuck I'm showing out because the show is on
You don't get it? Nigga that's bilateral symmetry
Any enemy
I break niggas down chemically
This is going down for real niggas, you timidly
Looking like you really wanna end of me
The energy
Your entities
I've been drinking Hennassy
And Remy and
I think I got no remedy
These niggas got no energy
Damn I'm about to break it down take it down
I don't even like the beat
Fuck it, Imma shake it down
Just like the Haitian nation
Niggas facing
Allegations, I'm a alligator
It's different, uh, uh
I am like Al-Qaeda
Blowing niggas up
Right in the elevator
On the escalate, I done escalated
They done told too many stories I don't believe it
Hold on
Jesus creepers, Jeepers creepers
I'm old school just like beepers
I need Franklin's, Aretha
Beverly Hills I'm in my sneakers
Bumping Stephanie Mills through my speakers
And I only fuck with Divas
And New York chicks that puff Cheeba
Cheeba Cheeba Reefa Reefa
Uh, I break it down I think you needa
See what I see nigga I'm the seeded
Top One but I'm not conceded
Like Remy had that one song if you was conceited
Uh, but I black on cats
I don't even understand cause I'm back with a rap
Did you say a word Sway because I can inter-corporate
And I don't give a fuck what they saying they gotta hate
[Hip-Hop]
He said Hip-Hop
I'm old school like G-Shock
Flip-Flops
Wristwatch
Bucket hats

Leave your body by the seashore
On a seashore
[My man Rob Markman!]
Rob Markman, MTV

M.V.P, the MP3 is bumping

How I'm crispy fly, kicks be fly
And I am more than meets the eye
Like a Voltron
I go on, and so on, and so on
And I flow on and flow on
[Name your favorite new MCs]
I couldn't hear that word
Because your flow was so loud
I wasn't near that word
I think you said it too low
I think I scared that word
I think I put it on a [?] and smeared that word
[Name your favorite MCs]
Name your favorite MCs?
I couldn't hear
It's just the energy
That you was doing when i was saying it at the same time
Me and you incorporated that rhyme within the same line
I dont really get it
I got two brains in the same mind
I break it down and get two different thoughts at the same time
Had to decypher which one that im gonna do
And when I let it
It's like when a chick end up pregnant
It's the one sperm that made it through the cell
[Ok, lets talk about Drake]
You said Drake

Rest of these niggas fake
You got Kendrick, Wale
Everybody in the game

I told a bitch hold this, that's the whole dick
Got a whole different way of doing shit
I'm super rich
You should get the cutest
Chick you know and tell her come through
We could kick it like Cung Le doin kung fu
You should get comfortable on my bed
One two, One two, One Two
You and I got a nigga runnin back and forth like I'm doing suicides
And you screamin oo and ahh
While I'm watchin you move side to side
As you ri-da-da-da-da-da
Like Pac on a nigga
Climb on top of a nigga
Like a six four bustin on three wheels, with them shocks on em nigga
Throw that box on a nigga like a nigga ???

[Hook]
[Hook: Carmen]
I’ve been all around the world and I, I, I, I
Never met a guy as quite as special as you are
But it feels like I’m dreaming
So many options I’ve had
But those relationships went all bad
I said I won’t look back
But I’m waiting, waiting

[Verse 1: Carmen]
Got me waiting patient, just for your love
Got me going crazy, when I’m not in your arms
Feel your kiss
Feel your touch
All the above, make it yours
Feel my love
Feel my lust
Make it yours, make it yours

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Los]
I’m talking black Tom Fords in a ‘74 Challenger
This is the allure, but never before caliber, I
Said she was Day and she said I was Night
So we had a picnic on the Moon
And she said I was bright
I’m talking out-of-this-world shit
How did this girl get out of the projects
And making the projects the product of thorough shit?
Paris, Sunday
London, Monday
Walking tall, like Project Runway
The more I look in your eyes
The less trouble I see
When you let me H-town
You’re SWV
You give me TLC
And it got me silly
It’s a cold world, and if you left
I’d be chilly

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
Black Tom Fords
[?] zipper
Boy got drive, like a four door pick-up
Flick up
Paparazzi  up on our penthouse do’
Never could top, it’s like the penthouse flo’
Been around all around the world and I, I, I
Never met a nigga to match my fly
But you take the cake with meticulous taste
And you make the fake a ridiculous waste
‘Cause you the realest shit I ever had
And ain’t a iller bitch, who hella bad
So I’m your perfect fit, like a cork in a bottle
All we go is get it poppin’, Full throttle

[Hook]
[Hook]
It's all on me (all on me)
Man it's all on me, man it's all on me
Man it's all on me, man it's all one me

Rich nigga don't sleep
Bitch nigga gon creep
But a nigga gotta eat
Man it's all on me, yeah it's all one me

(All on me)
If I'm number one I'm gon get this shit on my own
(And that's what it's gon be!
Cause it's all on me man, it's all on me.)
Then they fucked around and got a nigga back in their zone
(I ain't worried 'bout you, why you worrying 'bout me nigga?)
Man it's all on me, man it's all on me
Man it's all on me, man it's all one me
Rich nigga don't sleep
Bitch nigga gon creep
But a nigga gotta eat
So it's all on me
Yeah it's all on me, man it's all on me
Man it's all on me!
Rich nigga don't sleep

[Verse 1]
U ain't know nothing nigga
It was touching blocks and got chill
Feds are calling my niggas
I still made it off the block and got rich
You ain't know nothing nigga
Had it harder in the slums
Lost my cousin to the streets
Lost my father to a gun
You know we famous for the blow
Everytime we roll, dropping hella bands, 50K or more
Know I got brothers in the game 1 locked up and just came home
Do anything for my niggas
So fuck you lames I'm back in my zone
I'm back in my zone, I'm reloaded bang
Fort like Norte Dame, buddish rollie
My little nigga told me put you out
All he want is a frozen chain, And this shit go bang
I don't really know what's in his brain
But I tell you niggas simple and plain
It fall on me, My nigga said he need bail
Fuck it! Charge it to the game

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
U ain’t know nothing nigga
Lost a homie to the feds
Lost a record deal still said imma get this bread
Man U ain’t know nothing nigga
Said imma hustel hard, they can take away the fame imma trust in God
You know i’m famous for the flow
Everywhere I go, pumpin' hella fast 50K or more
You know it’s suckers in the game, they do lame shit like faking they wrong
Told my city imma get it, i’m just mad it took me this long
It took me too long, how [?] running with the feds
Hella shit was running through my head, niggas ending up dead
Hate to see marty like that, they took his girl and they hit him for the bread
Nigga we was bread, right in the [?] shit
Where love don’t really mean love
Where smile don’t mean a nigga really happy for you
So since the day I found out what it was
It’s all on me!
[Intro:]
I got ghetto dope in my vein, I got yellow rope on my...
I got ghetto dope in my vein, yellow gold on my chain

[Bridge:]
I got ghetto dope in my vein, yellow gold on my chain
I fly in that Maserati like Melo go through the lane

All right then, all right then
All right then, hah?

[Verse 1:]
Melo go through the lane, we men all do the same
That one McLaren with a seat in the middle now
Raised with the killa can while you playin mad man
Ain't no superhero here but the X-Men
Everybody lookin for survival so they are so
The man that hold the gun is the hand that rocks the cradle

Born in the gutter, covered in struggle
Smothered in hustle where brothers hate you as much as yo mother can love you
Motherfuckers that buck you over them green bags
Subtracting crème's the method, I'm method over the clean trap
It was shock when they shot my father, the shock was on em
Was hoppin off em and onto me is a prophet, recall it

When I landed in the land of glory I was barely ten
I was raised in a hut with them barbarians
Burner hear my bubble good, shootin from the project roof
Papa was a preacher, I was bishop cause I had the juice
Real talk when I rode gone til November
It's cause if Baltimore that murdered my nigga in November

All right then, hah?

[Bridge: x2]
I got ghetto dope in my vein, yellow gold on my chain
I fly in that Maserati like Melo go through the lane

[Hook:]
I say fuck these niggas and what I say
You don't know me, pretend to know me
Fuck these niggas and what they say
You don't know me, pretend to know me

All right then, all right then, hah?

[Verse 2:]
It's the author, unorthodox
Orthodoxin the water, no culture shop
You ain't strapped, you a hold the top
I holt the top cause the bottom comin
Got em runnin, call the cops
I'm callin shots like tech whistles
Fuck you like groupie tex, detects missiles that be technical
Ya'll niggas is ho oh oh oh oh oh
Fuck em, we flippin bundles, them bitches tumble like
Gold medal winners, gold medal in em, boy we stretch em
When we catch him it's like he caught a cold
Cause he get a coffee, never speak on it cold
Never geek on yo niggas and never creep with a ho
That be exactly how they found you, just a creep and a ho
My niggas be quick to pull them litres, leave you leakin for dough

All right then, all right then, hah?

[Bridge: x2]
I got ghetto dope in my vein, yellow gold on my chain
I fly in that Maserati like Melo go through the lane

[Verse 3:]
Pour some liquor cause the good die young
Banana clipped up but he sure young
Welcome to the jungle where they treat us like we animals
Haiti, the Bitstock chronicles
Murder murder – that's what you hear when they pull up in the middle of the night
When they ready for the stick up
Hiccup hiccup hiccups, you ain't bout the rubber grip
If you only had 3, why would one be a death wish
This is the truth but I said this before
Whether I'm in Haiti or Baltimore
Import more shooters who run through yo door
And it'll be yo body lying on the floor
Out in the mob, they go through your organ
In the church they play the organ
C-c-c-c-ca-cry-cry-crows-crows fly fly
It's 5 o'clock, do you know?
You kids, ha-have you been notified-fied-fied

All right then, all right then
All right then, hah?
All right then, all right then
All right then, hah?
[Verse 1]
So I think they cut my loose leaf, from the forbidden fruit tree
Oo,wee, excuse me, Allow me to introduce me
It's all star Los, from the ball hog show
Don't make me make a target out you walmart flow
You know who I B. add the E.S.T
You playin games boy? I bring you this PS3
Finally The nerd and the bully had words
I throw bullets at bullies I throw bullies at nerds
Since the days of macintosh I just mac' and talk shit
Baby shut yo apple down With this mac and toss it
God damn what I got to start callin' names nigga
Like I don't do this for breakfast , I charlamagne niggas
Magical ass rappers y'all niggas is trash
Every bar talkin' 'bout how you saw niggas in half
Well that seems odd and cause niggas to laugh
So I'm at your door step with dog shit in a bag

[Hook]
I could go
Snapback, Louis belt, Vans on niggas
Polo socks pulled up, Raybans on niggas
Hitman, I ain't tryin' to make plans on niggas
Pray for 'em 'fore I have to lay hands on niggas
Whoop his ass, whoop his whoop his ass all the way to church
Whoop his ass, whoop his whoop his ass all the way to church
Whoop his ass, whoop his whoop his ass all the way to church
I just figured that the bigger man oughta say it first
Like lord jesus tell that boy to leave this
Situation alone holmes im jus goin' easy
Whoop his ass, whoop his whoop his ass all the way to church
I just figured that the bigger man oughta say it first

[Verse 2]
You know put 'em in the streets he a awkward ass nigga
They tell me he sneeze wrong I a cough in that nigga
He ain't 'bout that work ol' talkin ass nigga
Put the tommy to you Tommy off Martin ass niggas
Lames flippin' my bars but im landin' shit the best
Nigga think he got heart cause he sayin' it with his chest
We marines my niggas grab that metal and we serve
And come occupy your street like the federal reserve
Ye ain't never choppin a scale wit rock for sale
Look in your eyes and I can tell your pops was frail
So for my younger and my older brother locked in jail
I dig in these niggas ass like its lobster tail
Yeah nigga name 5 rappers fuckin' wit me
And leave square niggas with they pineapple's under the sea
Say los bring the greatness back holmes im just stating fact
And all y'all niggas suck "April Pratt"

[Hook]
Snapback, louis belt, vans on niggas
Polo sized ,pulled up, ray bans on niggas
Hitman, I ain't tryin to make plans on niggas
Pray for 'em before I have to lay hands on niggas
Whoop his ass, whoop his whoop his ass all the way to church
Whoop his ass, whoop his whoop his ass all the way to church
Whoop his ass, whoop his whoop his ass all the way to church

Whoop his ass, whoop his whoop his ass all the way to church
I just figured that the bigger man oughta say it first
[Intro]
Umm you already what this is baby, it’s your boy Los
You what I’m talking bout, I mean it’s only right that we go in
So uh, Im amazing, so so amazing (Welcome to swagsville)
Had to turn the lights off
Let’s go baby

[Verse 1: Los]
Cause I go harder, faster, further, stronger
Director, facilitator, illustrator, author
All of the above, I’m falling so far in love with this all over again
This is awesome
Hip-hop be my darling, tell me you gon marry me
Cause without you I’m nothing, and without me you’re boring
Look how we be performing, when we get together
Yeah we the shit forever, you see this shit I’m better than all of the rest of ... them
They phony like wrestlers, when you gone I’m restless
But when you close them gestures
Cool as I could ever be, smooth as you could never be
Never out my groove I’m way too cool of a celebrity
F with me I’m definitely the deathest to the death of me
Everybody left me so the only one that's left is me
Never thought my life would be filled with so much destiny
Till everything is right with me, I write whatever’s left of me
And can't nobody write for me, so I guess it’s left of me
To make it all right, you can say I left the recipe, definitely
See me a king it ain't a ‘ting when a pawn a verse me
Me no fear when me ‘ear all the controversy
Lord ‘ave mercy how them tink a response could 'urt me
When me make it ‘tru the hard time and all me friend desert me
Allergic to chilling these millions I’m grinding
Shinning with the brilliance of a trillion cut diamond
Of course I’m the hardest
They should teach courses at Harvard about how I horse other artists
I’m the Rolls-Royce to these Hondas
Better known as my compe-tition but in compe-tence I am not fond of
If it’s not a compli-ment, that’s a response to this shit, what could you offer?
Homie, I am off the far corner of Mars with my bars and fuck gravity I actually walk on the stars
Heard a redneck say “Where the fuck is this nigger from?
All we know is he just jump on the track and he get ‘er done
Lord forbid he get a goddamn beat with a bigger drum
Cause Lil Wayne done lost his goddamn brain and Jigga’s done”
Where the fuck do I get it from?
Since the moment this shit begun, it’s like God put a pen in my hand and said “nigger run”
I been running ever since, presenting stunning evidence
With such cunning relevance and like running elephants
You can hear my arrival, I fear for my rivals
My flow’s so righteous should of appeared in the Bible
Prepare for the final chapter of a stand up nigga
Cause most rappers got spinal fractures
But mine will capture the minds of the captured
Under these lines I’m underlining the answers
Can’t tie me, down or deny me
My ribbon in the sky provided by such a fly me
How deep? I stimulate your brain more
And lames taking shots at me cause I’m something to aim for
Game score, forty-nothing
Fucking with Los, I’m sure he’s bluffing
My fans say “Homeboy you’re disgusting, you don’t have to say anything more to 'em than fuck 'em,”
So “Fuck 'em!” I say, and I’m so sincere why the fuck would I play?
He ain't walk in my shoes, nigga fuck what he say
I just murdered this shit, come fuck with me Ye
[Los]
Listen okay, last time I Hustled Hard ‘cause rappers just pussy
And The Crown Ain’t Safe in the hood, what’s goody?
Uh, I picture my goal, picture this go getter. Y’all niggas is slow
I’m pitching this no hitter. No nigga paint pictures with this fly repetition;
Don’t I paint the perfect picture like it’s high definition?
I’m too Jurassic, future classic, class-act, Louie backpack - do the math
Bitch, don’t make me black ‘cause it’s ugly. I’m back on my study
Loosen up the snap backs, back to the skullies
Make me flashback to the Lacs and the Cudi’s
Don’t make me relax, and run laps around dummies
Relapse, he’s back, it’s a wrap for you mummies
Weak rappers, ease back to the background for me, trying to handle more biz
So I can get that Rolls(Rose) on them 23’s - something like Amber on Wiz
Crown ain’t safe, so all you niggas screaming out you "got next"
Tell them I said now it ain’t safe! I eat off rap, I eat rappers
Keep snapping, so keep slacking, I’m lap running and speed bagging
Heavy bagging, body hooking and left jabbing
Make you miscount an attack, then I step back in it’s one hit, two hit
Three, hit you four like a one dick, two chick, threesome these whores
One watch, two chains like a three degree breeze
I’m the one air like the 23’s on my sneakers!
It's a lot of Big K.R.I.T.(c)'s every time the kid blink, another comment
Talkin the Kid’s Ink. Fuck y’all think? I get the job done
I ain’t make XXL but they can’t God(guard) son, it’s game time, y’all pretending to ball
I got a flow that school boys, no Kendrick Lamar. Oh, let me stop it
I’m just killing every topic. I ain’t dissing, I ain’t bitching if a nigga dissing me
I don’t know ‘cause I ain’t listen, I ain’t missing, I ain’t missing
I’m the nigga with a mission, got a plan and a vision
I want the crown, you don’t understand that? Fuck it, I want the ground
Niggas run around blocks, I run the town
I don’t chase a dream nigga, I hunt it down and never close an eyelid
Never met Los, you never known fly shit, but try this on;
See how its fitting you could never be number two so see, I ain’t shitting
You could only be number one and I see why it’s pissing you... off
Soft niggas lack the backbone and the heart, you don’t even act grown in your thoughts
In this movie the nigga that act wrong get the part(Depart), hope we can take two
No "Drama Queen", you'll get director cut, I don’t mean behind the scenes
I’ve been doing this shit since Francis and Yao Ming, 80’s baby, fly on the low life
Tracy McGrady’s eye on the low, when I had gold teeth and I was high on the 'dro
And my big homie had a whole pie on the stove. Had my eye on the goal
Hog tie on the floor and even when I ain’t drive, I walk fly on a ho, Los!
[Produced by Bangladesh]

I'm slick and I'm fly, I'm fly and I'm slick
So slick I could fly like oh my God, I'm flyin oh shit
Am I slicker or flyer don't know, I'm trying to pick
But if I kill you while your driving you'll be ghostriding your whip
I whipped your girlfriend, Now her and her girlfriend both ridin my dick
My flow so ill I told the doctor help me I'm dyin I'm sick
Stizzick a nizzedle that mean I'm, supplying some shit
Dope as heroin, Every word I'm sayin get you high as a bitch
High as a brick fallin from the towers
Now I'm ballin on them cowards
So hard NBA commissioners gon' call me any hour
Sour face dem coward haters, Fuck dem niggas
Now I'm racist, Give em 40 cal. abrasions
Now I'm facin, Allegegations
Dick her then I cum, Sicker with the words
Wiggle with a verse, Quicker with a trigger hit a nigga first
If he get us hurt, Lift him in a hearse
Stick 'em in the dirt, Ditch him then I murk
In the kitchen with the work
Den I be whippin round that pop, Like I'm whippin coka ain't I
I'm a lion from the jungle, No heyena
Both my ninas, Get em in a jam
Stick em in a van, Hit em with the blam
Think a nigga playin, Think he give a damn
Squeeze the trigger, Blam
See the nigga ran, sweet as Peter Pan
Leave 'em with a tan, See the beater man?
I beat 'em with the hands
Oh momma sorry, I don't want no drama from these cats
If I pull my Glock up on ya, You'll run like Barack Obama
If we beefin bring ya armor fo' I knock a pothole
Take dat beef, Bring some shells and make a fuckin taco out you
See if it's not clear nigga, It's my year nigga
These other rappers cool, But this shit rite here nigga
Ya ain't tellin Los shit, I'm so outta dis world I make telescopes squint
Shit I just wanna ball with no drama
Black face presidential rollie call it Obama
Oh momma, I'm so sick they tell doctors
She rubbin on my seats like she never felt ostrich
My roof in the trunk like it's bein held hostage
My links so juicy fat people think they smell sausage
And I don't mention you clowns
You niggas wouldn't shoot a tech you caught intentional foul
I pick a new town, Trick a few thou
Make my wrist like a blizzard blue, blew Pikachu round
You kiss and you clown, Niggas done beat ya chicken to the gizzards wow
I'm bout to slide it to a level where I'm hotter than the devil
Cause ya ridin with a rebel like da rocks that's in my bezzle
I'm a shine, I'm grindin with my metal everytime
In my mind never settle for a dime
I'm petty with my metaphors, To rhyme I'm a climb
I'm better than my predators outwit em every time
Count every president that ever did it hyper irrelavant I recite em in my line
I don't give a fuck about these niggas or the cops, Tryna spend a buck and put spinners on the drop
And it's cold as fuck every winter on the block
So you know what's up wen I'm aimin at ya spot
Give it up smooth or ya gonna get shot
I'm da kid dats movin on ya block
I think it's been proven Los is hot
Let's get shit movin, I'm focused biotch!
[Verse 1]
I heard a whisper from my angel in my sleep
She said you need to let go all that pain in which you keep
Baby I know its deep but how you gon' live
With bottled up emotions because you never forgive
Your fathers in a better place he wouldn't want you stressin'
What about your family, what about your blessings
How you gon' focus and be steady on your goal
If you don't get rid of this burden that's so heavy on your soul
Well I didn't know hiding my problems wouldn't work
Nobody knew my pain I was just smilin' when it hurt
I guess I gotta cry 'cuz since I ain't get it out this long
Dealin' wit it everyday I thought that meant that I was strong
You may figure that its better like its easier to take
But when that pressure build up it make you easier to break
See God kept me safe through all these violent situations
Through these trials and tribulations, im jus glad that I can have

[Hook]
A conversation with my angel and I'm flyin' away
All the clouds leave out my sky to bring sum sunshine in my day
Suddenly everything's okay and I hunger even more
To conquer everything I dream and I'm much stronger than before
A conversation with my angel and I'm already fine
Got no time for nothin' petty homie I'm ready to shine
A conversation with my angel got me in the clouds
And I'm good enough to get up 'cuz she got me when I'm down
A conversation with my angel

[Verse 2]
The story gets deeper I ain't even scratch the surface
She said when I was born I always had a special purpose
She told me how she always use watch me as I lay
How she use to wrap her wings around me as she pray
How the devil want me gone but god won't give him the permission
She said there's somethin' bigger for you jus stick to your vision
Watch who be in your circle 'cuz the company you keep
Could be the very ones that bring you nothing but defeat
So I focus on my future leaving history behind
Now I feel like I could make it I feel victory is mine
All the hatred that I felt all the agony and pain
Makes the sun so beautiful after seeing rain
See some people hold it in and throw they life away for years
'Cuz they never had somebody there to wipe away they tears
See god kept me safe through all these violent situations
Through these trials and tribulations, I'm just glad that I can have

[Hook]
A conversation with my angel and I'm flyin' away
All the clouds leave out my sky to bring sum sunshine in my day
Suddenly everything's okay and I hunger even more
To conquer everything I dream and I'm much stronger than before
A conversation with my angel and I'm already fine
Got no time for nothin' petty homie I'm ready to shine
A conversation with my angel got me in the clouds
And I'm good enough to get up 'cuz she got me when I'm down
A conversation with my angel

[Verse 3]
This will fulfill me for ever
For the prophecy reads I was built to be better
Inclined to understand the mind of a hater
Divined before my time designed to be greater
Yes sir you feel that surge when I'm rhymin'
When the pressure is on me then(what) emerge is a diamond
Time and focus determination, ambition
She said pay attention to every word I'm saying and listen
Patience, obedience, humbleness, tolerance
Getting knocked down help you master lifes balances
Challenges, obstacles, road blocks, pit stops
Don't stop till it stops, tic toc
The clock goes, then time goes by so fast
Your chance might pass while your eyes closed
So thanks mom for every time you made me laugh
All call you tomorrow just so I can have a

[Hook]
A conversation with my angel and I'm flyin' away
All the clouds leave out my sky to bring sum sunshine in my day
Suddenly everything's okay and I hunger even more
To conquer everything I dream and I'm much stronger than before
A conversation with my angel and I'm already fine
Got no time for nothin' petty homie I'm ready to shine
A conversation with my angel got me in the clouds
And I'm good enough to get up 'cuz she got me when I'm down
A conversation with my angel
Uh, Zero
Los
It's like this how it's supposed to happen, you know?
When it comes to the pursuit of more
Why the fuck would I settle for less?
I'm ready
Got angels around me now, heheh

Yeah, yeah, yo
Ayo, I'm laughin' at the critics in the booth
I just throw on the Raybans
And pour a lil' liquor in my juice
My flow ain't a critical dispute
I push myself so hard -
It could be considered physical abuse
Life like a circus when it come to this fame
I been walkin' the tightrope for years, jugglin' pain
Had to struggle to gain
You can see the thrill in my eyes
I like to shake these niggas hand
And feel the girl in they vibe
I'm leavin' niggas by the curb on this ride
There's something buried inside
That felt different back when Gerald was alive
Yeah, I'm on my grind, whatchu whinin' and mad for?
I ain't throwin' shade, you can't shine in my shadow
Compare my voice to the pathetic in you
Pardon my rhetoric, but you better get etiquette school
You embellish irrelevance you unintelligent fools
And you lack the vernacular that deems you eligible
Walked through hell and I'm cool
Swim through the pool of forbidden water
Hell fire, scorch I lived it amidst the torture
Hardships distortion, unfortunate misfortune
Ultimate grief for it's no ultimate resources
These courses I ran made a man of me
It's funny how I used to think pain made a family
Love harder, but love only bring the pain
All that shit confusin' as a bitch, and it seem the same
Seen the game from angles you couldn't imagine
It's pushin' your luck to say I'll never be pushin' a Phantom
I'm from where it get heated in the trap
If you get beaten in a scrap
Then you reachin' for ya strap
And it's funny how they greet you with a dap'
How the hug you, tell you to stay up
Before they bring you an attack
If I ever feel defeated with this rap
It's a wrap, I will literally chase
Success down and beat it with a bat
I'm a heathen when I zap
There's a reason that I rap
You will never see the day nor
The evening that I slack
No stressin', progression is no question
And tribulation with no faith is no blessin'
No guessin', and I'm so sincere
That I'm so on yo ass if you don't concur
Cuz rappers all fake like smoke n' murrs (mirrors)
And I've been known to snap like spoken word
Audiences, y'all ridiclous and hardly vicious
Guard ya trenches, be conscientious, y'all all pretenders
And I'm from where the choppas be
Where niggas get bagged like a shoppin' spree
Way nice, I'm on my Ray Rice, it ain't no stoppin' me
And that's just what they do for fun
And if you standin' next to him, that's a two for one
Welcome to The Wire, where we hirin' a goon or two
It'll look like we made flyers for ya funeral
Who are you to judge me? Assuming you above me
But you never been around for all my beautifuls and uglys
Trust me, I ain't even on my third style
I ain't even start reachin' in my word pile
With no words I could make ya girl smile
With four words I could make the world bow
Y'all niggas thorough? How? Let's get this real clear
I been thru everything - and I'm still here
Some say I'm cocky - too conceited
But they ain't see all the superficials I superseded
No more fallin' - Forever standin'
And this time when I take flight, I'm never landin'
Wavin' at everything be-low
Had a smoky past, but my futures so Deebo
Watch what you record, and I ain't talkin' TiVo
Meet me in the sky mothafucka, Zero
[Produced by Bink! and Mike Dean]

I dedicate my everything to ya’ll, I’m over-faithful
In the world where everyone that love you, grow to hate you
My motive ain’t never to knock you it’s to motivate you
Dear momma I love you and your glow is graceful
Notice I had to shout-you-out on something slow and tasteful
For my girl, I miss every minute I don’t embrace you
You better not never leave a nigga, how I’m gonna replace you?
To my ballers getting money, thinking dough will make you
Chasing them hoes, just get your paper and them hoes will chase you
Don’t ever mention me with niggas I don’t relate to
I’m so driven boy, if you listening my flow’ll take you
You heard Los on ‘Freedom of Speech’, I think he going racial
Never that I’m just dropping knowledge, tryna flow-icate you
So in the midst of your troubles just keep going straight thru
You going straight, keep your chin up don’t let opponents break you
And I give glory to God because I know what it takes to
For him to show a breakthrough you got to show him faith too
So I be more than faithful even though no one’s label wants to sign you
Unless it’s a show that can go on cable

Uh, get off my dick hater, quit that old girl shit
City on my back, flip it till it some whole world shit
Now all the fly ladies screaming ‘you go boy’
All the backpackers screaming ‘we seen you on 2dopeboyz’
Damn no way that Nas ain’t sign you yet
You ain’t pressing the vinyls going viral yet
Yea huh, Guess how I spiral that, I can do all things through Christ
Homie you ain’t read the bible yet?
Now where all my rivals at, lets kick this disrespect off
My flow move mountains, and ya’ll niggas need to step off
Like my step dad when he stepped and I was left off the right track
But then I came right back and never stepped off
I’m just talking, I ain’t even rapping
Tell you what, let’s pretend this shit ain't even happen
I take these niggas for a joke and I ain’t even laughing
So if I’m reaching for this pound, I ain’t even dapping
Fuck sleep I ain’t even napping
This shit was more like poetry but I ain’t even snapping
If my past couldn’t stop me what could?
The crown ain’t safe in the hood, whats good
[Verse 1: Los]

Ayo I'm laughing at the critics in the booth
I just throw on the ray bans
And pour a lil liquor in my juice
My flow ain't a critical dispute
I pushed myself so hard it could be considered physical abuse
Life like a circus when it come to this fame
I've been walking a tight rope for years juggling pain
Had to struggle to gain
You can see the thorough in my eyes
I like to shake these nigga's hand and feel the girl in they vibe
I'm leavin' nigga's by the curb where his ride
It's something buried inside
That felt different back when Jerl was alive
Yeah, I'm on my grind what you whinin' and mad foe
I ain't throwin' shade you can't shine in my shadow
Compare my poise to the pathetic in you
Pardon my rhetoric but you better get etiquette school
You embellish irrelevance you unintelligent fools
And you lack the vernacular that deems you eligible
Walk through hell and I'm cool
Swim through the pool of forbidden water
Hell-fire scorch I lived in the midst of torture
Hardships distortion unfortunate misfortunes
Alternate grief for us no alternate resources
These courses I ran made a man of me
It's funny how I used to think pain made a family
Love harder, but love only bring the pain
All that shit confusing is a bitch and it seem the same
Seen the game from angles you couldn't imagine
It's pushing your luck to say I'll never be pushing a phantom
Hurt from where it get
Hated in the trap
If you get beaten in a scrap then you reaching for your strap
It's funny how they greet you with a dap, how they hug you
Tell you to stay up before they bring you and attack
If I ever feel defeated with this rap it's a wrap
I will literally chase success down and beat it with a bat
I'm a heathen when I ?
It's a reason that I rap
You will never see the day nor the evening that I, slack
No stressin', progression is no question
And tribulation with no faith is no blessin'
No guessin' and I'm so sincere
That I'm so on your ass if you don't concur
Cause rappers all fake like smoke and mirrors
And I've been known to snap like spoken word
Audiences, yall ridiculous and hardly vicious
Guard your trenches be consciousnesses yall all pretenders
And I'm from where the choppers be
Where nigga's get bagged like a shopping spree
Way nice I'm on my Ray Rice it ain't no stoppin' me
And that's just what they do for fun
And if you standin' next to em' that's a two for one
Welcome to the wire where we hirin' a goon or two
It'll look like we made fliers for your funeral
Who are you to judge me?
Assuming you above me but you never been around for all my beautiful's and uglie's
Trust me, I ain't even on my third style
I ain't even start reachin' in my word pile
With no words I could make your girl smile
With four words I could the world bow
Yall nigga's thorough how
Let's get this real clear
I've been through everything
And I'm still here
Some say I'm cocky, too conceited
But they ain't see all the superficial's I superseded
No more fallin'
Forever standin'
This time when I take flight I'm never landing
Waving at everything below
Had a smokey past but my future so Debow
Watch what you record and I ain't talkin TiVo
Meet me in the sky motherfucker, Zero
[Hook]
Do you know what today is?
It’s our anniversary, our anniversary
Do you know what today is?
It’s our anniversary, our anniversary

[Los]
If lies hurt, but the truth heals
And 1+1 equals love then how does 2 feel
Minus 1 thats so heart broken
Its hard to divide a future unless its both arms open
Jus show trust through your actions
I know its hard to say that ones that got over
Took a fraction of your heart away
I mean its bad enough that when problems multiply
Then someone gets carried, it ain't adding up
Why when you say you dont want nobody you see somebody
And when you say you dont need nobody you need somebody
Hard as the concrete but soft as a whisper
Thats the mystery of love in all this enigma
Its like the farther you dive in the harder it hit cha
Now the ones that say they love ya is arguing witcha
Ask VAR and LARISA about them senseless rumors
Real love ain't censored just have a sense of humor
Funny what we remember from a kiss
Met on october 30th, then september 25th
In the blink of an eye, in the midst of a minutes time
Shes officially mine, we Mr and Mrs fly
Now its necklaces for Christmas, unlimited kisses
And how eternally precious 1 minute of this is
2 wishes that came true at 1 time
So I dont give my flower no flowers
I give her sunshine
And the rain too to wash away the bad days
To bring the sunshine back for all the sad days
Hope you followin your dreams till you livin em out
If I could provide you one thing it’d be infinite smiles
So smile baby, you be gone lately
When you shine I shine, you motivate me
So waking up next to you feel like I never slept
And laying down next to you make me think I could fly
We comin full circle now with every step
And when I look into your eyes I think of the sky
Best I ever had took away the worst of me
1 year strong happy anniversary

Today is the day that we bought is all together
And I don’t want nobody but you baby

Do you know what today is?
It’s our anniversary, our anniversary
Do you know what today is?
It’s our anniversary, our anniversary

[Intro - Los]
I think it’s safe to say, that I’m officially back
Like Martin I’m a king
I just don’t sleep enough to dream
Oh yeah, Bad Boy is the team
Let me talk to ‘em

[Hook - Los]
Piss me off, I’ll kill this world in one hour
Give your girl back shots, leave her smellin’ like gunpowder
She sip that lean, get high as the Eiffel Tower
Then salute my dick, call it General Eisenhower
Man, A-Ks all in that pussy
Glocks inside that punanai
Leave the window open and the fuckin’ door cracked
Nigga come and find me

[Verse 1 - Los]
Climbin’ in it, like I’m findin’ diamonds in it
Divin’ in it, like I’m Dennis Rodman in it
Flew that that pussy to me now my private flyin’ private in it
Shot it in her eye
Horry Robert in it
Fuck your story
I will end it if I’m offended
You gon’ make me take your spot
Make me take your block then knock it off
They’ll take your block and block it off
Then tape the block, cops get called
If haters plot to block it all
If I’m involved, I’m riding off
Like I just threw a Molotov
Smile and drive a mile and toss
Slidin’ off through the jects
Cruise and flex in that new thing
That cost me a little pocket money
Like losing bets at a pool game
Cool change, not 2 Chainz
Just two chains at one time
I do things, like take loose change
And cop two chains at one time
I lose chains, take loose change
And cop two chains for every lost chain
No plaque, good smile, floss game
Fuck around and

[Hook - Los]
Piss me off, I’ll kill this world in one hour
Give your girl back shots, leave her smellin’ like gunpowder
She sip that lean, get high as the Eiffel Tower
Then salute my dick, call it General Eisenhower
Man, A-Ks all in that pussy
Glocks inside that punanai
Leave the window open and the fuckin’ door cracked
Nigga come and find me

[Verse 2 - Los]
Somebody told me a nobody told him something about me
Bout something about me, but nobody know nothing about me
That’s something about me you should know
To use a flow such as mine
You’s a pro, losers know
But I don’t know you losers though
Battle me you’ll lose your dough
You’ll have to use tubes through your nose
And count the views from your YouTube to blow
Blow a dick and pick a flower
Nigga I provide the rest
Suicidal pilot swag
Yeah I think I’m fly to death
Silence best describes what I do to all these rap niggas
If you wack niggas

[Hook - Los]
Piss me off, I’ll kill this world in one hour
Give your girl back shots, leave her smellin’ like gunpowder
She sip that lean, get high as the Eiffel Tower
Then salute my dick, call it General Eisenhower
Man, A-Ks all in that pussy
Glocks inside that punanai
Leave the window open and the fuckin’ door cracked
Nigga come and find me

[Verse 3 - Los]
Piss me off, I’ll kill this world in one hour
Give your girl back shots and shoot em back to you in an hour
Move forward from the bullshit
Gotta take a ride in a hearse
‘Cause settin’ clocks back the only way I was reversed
When I say I was reversed
You thinkin’ I was in time
I’m thinkin’ hours is
Everything that’s ours is fine
Man, them hours was flyin’
Man I was just fine
Damn, you soft as collagen
All you cowards is dyin’
Man, acknowledge this
Hoes giving me knowledge is fine
I’m talking knowledge like they really got college in mind
I drop knowledge like my mind got a college in mind
And I’mma school you, I already got a college in mind
Nigga polish your grind
When your grind polished you shine
This is large quantities of high quality grind
It’s all policy
These niggas be robbin’ me blind
They love to copy me
Like they ain’t see the piracy signs
Man, you gotta rewind
I’m on my bold shit, Devo
Welcome niggas back to my old shit
Zero … point two, haha
