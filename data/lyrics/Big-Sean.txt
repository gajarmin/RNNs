[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(I, straight up, look)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd and Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
Cause that implies that we back from something
If we back from something there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I couldn't give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed
[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down
How many times I gotta?
Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
For the weekend, ohh

[Hook: Chris Brown]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time
You know how I feel about waiting in line
You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time
You'll only ditch him for a moment in time, take it in stride
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
How many times I gotta tell your ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell you I gotta chauffeur?
Think about it, think it over, everything is gon' be kosher
Call me when you getting closer
If you take a taxi, how much I owe ya?
Don't send me no naked pictures
If I can't get naked with ya
This dick deserves recognition
I don't mind paying that commission
Is you with the shit or nah?
If we ain't fucking then bitch, bon voyage
How many times? I said how many times?
Too many times and bitch I ain't got time

[Hook]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time
You know how I feel about waiting in line
You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time
You'll only ditch him for a moment in time, take it in stride
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay phone off the hook, yeah that bitch won't stop blinking
I'll pick up for you though on the second ring
You've been drinking and drinking, you're drinking for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leaving
Calling shots refereeing, no drama
Pussy so wet I'mma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodging the leeches, I'm signing agreements
I'm signing new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimming with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixing, this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favourite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

[Hook (partial)]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?

[Bridge]
Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down
How many times I gotta?
Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
For the weekend, ohh

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwing bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feeling generous, throwing my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm boning
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning
Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whipping the bricks

[Hook]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time
You know how I feel about waiting in line
You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time
You'll only ditch him for a moment in time, take it in stride
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?
[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty

[Hook: Big Sean]
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get
Bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes that y'all don't speak the same language
I know that you just wanna let it go with all the bitches that you came with

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs, wanna get away
Baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with,  is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

[Verse 4: Big Sean & (Jhene Aiko)]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing
But no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
(I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain)
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
(Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know goin' runnin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...)

[Hook]

[Outro]
I know it look like like you need a vacation
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia
Take you places other niggas can't take ya
Don't forget the make up
Yeah
[Produced By DJ Mustard, Kanye West & DJ Dahi]

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

[Hook: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that its makin' me sick
I see you calling, I be makin' it quick
I'mma answer that shit like: "I don't fuck with you"
Bitch I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah
And everyday I wake up celebratin' shit, why?
Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories, that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me, she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'm gonna text your ass back like

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook x2]

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You liable to  find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah we in the buildin' but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah I know that karma's too real so I hope you doin' cool
But still stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass I ain't fuckin with
I ain't fuckin', I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you
(Straight up)
[Intro: Jeremih & Chance The Rapper]
I don't wanna be you, I just wanna be me
I don't wanna be cool, I just wanna be me
You don't wanna be cool, you just wanna be me
I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be cool
I don't wanna be cool, I don't like being cool
I ain't trying to be cool, what's it like being cool?
I just can't stay cool, I don't wanna be cool
I don't want you to be me, you should just be you
You just wanna be me!
You just wanna be me!

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, I grew up without a chauffeur
Man, I'm talking straight out the dirt and sulfur
Only birds in my city is vultures
I mean back before I could afford a faux fur
I was off in that debt, me and my mama
Hand-me-downs was the only time I got designer man
Only class I'm passing is English and Math
I don't know, maybe because they both got commas
Maybe because my older bro was on the honor roll
And the other one was always up in front of the honor
So I'm in the middle like the line in the divide signs
Spending all my money on girls and Sean John
Way before anybody called me Sean Don
I was dropping fifties man to look like 50
Rocking pink Polo's, shit ain't even fit me
Looking for the inspiration that's already in me
All the confidence I was trying to buy myself
If you don't like me, fuck it, I'll be by myself
Spend all this time for you to say I'm fine
I really should have spent it trying to find myself

[Bridge: Jeremih & Chance The Rapper]
It's cool with just me
I'm cool being me
I don't wanna be cool
I ain't trying to be cool
I just can't stay cool
Whats it like being cool?
I don't wanna be cool
I don't wanna be cool
I don't want you to be me
You just should be you

[Verse 2: Kyle]
Is being cool that cool? (Really?)
Is being a tool that big of a duel? (Is it?)
It doesn't matter if a nigga is wearing Supreme
If a cool guy shits his shit's still gonna stink
If a cool guy's cool in the middle of the forest
Man nobody fucking cares
So why don't you just be the you that you know you are
You know, when nobody else is there?
You'll be aware, it's easy, and it's so important
Being cool shouldn't cost a fortune
Baby got her jeans from Goodwill
But I bet that ass look good still
Okay let's remember that shopping at Payless
It just means that you pay less, it don't make you bae-less
If you don't get re-tweets, it don't mean you say less, okay?
So I'mma post this shitty-ass selfie on IG
And I don't care if anybody likes it or likes me, it's cool

[Outro]
I don't wanna be cool
I ain't trying to be cool
I just can't stay cool
Whats it like being cool?
I don't wanna be cool
I don't wanna be cool
I don't want you to be me
You just should be you
[Hook]
I always wanted to stunt so hard
I always wanted to ride that whip
I always wanted to fuck that bitch
Thank you, God, I fucked that bitch
I always wanted to live this life
I always wanted to wear that ice
I always wanted a paradise
I always wanted a paradise

[Bridge 1]
Look, now it don't take a lot to make you rich
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit
Man, I feel like money is the best drug
Sometimes hate can be the best love

[Verse 1]
Walkin' in like I got cameras on me
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

[Bridge 2 (x4)]
Money bag, money bag, money bag

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Straight up, Finally Famous, nigga
Aw damn, damn

[Verse 2]
Aw damn, I'm illuminated, man, I knew I make it
And I get that shit accumulated
Never throwing money out, I boomerang it
Finally famous over everything, that's a numerator
Weed lit, yeah, it's luminated, room lookin' like it's fumigated
Bitch, my crew invaded, when I walk in, man, they body to body
Hol' up everybody, don't worry, man, I got it, I got it
I need a hundred dollar bill, photocopy the email and copy
Man, I'm going hard all season
These hoes goin' both ways, offense, defense
Livin' life on the deep end, F-F allegiance
Beat the odds and got even
What you think, that we just started, nigga?
Boy, the sword just got sharper, nigga
This ain't war, we just sparring, nigga
I was on the rooftop with my nigga Mike Carson, nigga
Shootin' that "Too Fake" video, my nigga, we all in
We set ourselves apart from all our apartments
Was up in Florida, no Marlins, nigga
I'm that Shawn, no Marlon, nigga
Look at my girl nigga, fuck yo' bae list
Fuck yo' night list, fuck yo' day list, fuck yo' playlist
I'm from the D, fuck your A-list
I been working 8 days a week
I don't even know what the fuck today is
I hit the booth and I just went super saiyan
I run with the purp like I play with the Ravens
These bitches rant and rave
I hope I never have to go back watching
Everybody Loves Raymond
Eating ramen, nigga, this paradise
Life's a fucking paradox and pair of dice
If they not rolling with you, then they parasites nigga
I had that vision, it was ClearSight, nigga, Sean Don
[Produced By; Amaire Johnson]

[Hook 1: Big Sean]
They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?

[Hook 2: Kanye West]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My grandma told me if you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they broke, they need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying

[Hook 3: John Legend]

[Outro]
Grandma: Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about me
Big Sean: It's all good I love you grandma
Grandma: Bye
[Verse 1: Ro Spit]
Check, yeah, the track got hot once I got on
I wear my heart on my sleeve Comme Des Garcons
I know I’m the shit, my French Pardon
A king in the booth I get my troops march on
We outta here, bars drop ya thinkin’ I’m a enigma
Cause I been had swag back when it was charisma
You know I’m a champ by how I’m raisin' my fist to
Not be number one I couldn’t live with that stigma
I figure, I was at the top and I’ll never slump
Neva pump fake nigga I’d rather dunk
You feelin’ good about yourself go head bet a hun
I take ya girl then ya pride, then the cheddar come
You’ve neva won and ain’t dreamed about ever winnin'
Second place the highest place that you ever been in
I do whatever for the cheese, I’m forever grinnin’
This verse amazing and it couldn’t a had a better endin’

[Verse 2: CurT@!n$]
Curtains, I’m the best at it, number one
With the flow, KRS at it
And I’m handin’ out L’s like Nike I’m a chess addict
You try to battle but you lost like a Meth addict
I’m like Meth at it, I’m the fuckin’ man
I done ran them all like Cunningham
No gun in hand, but these warning shots
Try to diss me, then I’m on your block
You lookin’ shocked, like we done fucked up now
I stay in the cypher like puff, puff, pass
No Spliff, but I’m a star like Busta man
Already said it once, but I’m gone tell ‘em again
I’m number one, uno, no dos
I’m like an atheist I got no hope
For your week raps, you can keep that
I got the game all Twisted like Keith Sweat

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
What you know about, being the best at
Any place you reside or rest at
Used to have to check back, now I hand back checks
And can’t remember the last time I seen flat chests
Out of town luggage lookin’ like a chess match, Louis
Or a tournament, chain look like a ornament
Me and your bitch fornicate and she ain’t on no foreign shit
But I hit her from behind and leave a wet back
And then I pass out
Then I took ya girlfriend & turn her to my mascot
Hometown hero but I never pull my mask out
Bet the crowd love me love me like I hit the last shot
Sometime your first shot, can be your last shot
So see what I do when the ball get’s passed out
Yep, but everybody call me Big
Go hard or go home, so I don’t ever see the crib, bitch

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Say, I’m bout to handle my business, who is this
The Big Dawg of the South, don’t forget this
Now sit back and bear witness like LeBron
To the King, AKA boss I’m so the Don
All that, been that, now I’m ahead
On some other shit tryinna get my hands on my bread and don’t
Let it be said that I do not run it, run it
I bet you what you tried to do, I done done it
Ridin’ foreign cars, doin’ foreign shows
Makin’ foreign money, fuckin’ foreign hoes
Held down VIP and popped bottles
Made it rain up in the club and knocked models
Later for that mane, it’s all in the rear view
I got my eyes on the prize in the clear view
Ya gunnin’ for the top spot and yeah I hear you
But me I ain’t three and I’m nowhere near two
So looka here dude
[Produced by Don Cannon]

[Hook]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type
Same shit different nights, till I live a different life
Sean you looking tired, damn homie that’s all
I’ve been stressin’ so hard I’m surprised I ain't going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into ya’ll, hatin’
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleepin with that mac and I ain't talkin’ bout computer love
Owe the wrong people you a price tag
Now you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag
Make it where I’m from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there too

[Hook]

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
If I just stop breathing
Even though I got all this muthafucking money
Won't keep my heart beating
Just don’t wake me up
Don't wake me up
You can’t catch me dreaming
Bout all of this muthafucking money
Cocaine rush, I’m speeding
Cocaine rush

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
I’m just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection at the same time
I’m accepting the fact that there’ll never be nothing perfect about me
Shit, I’m just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks
The hoes’ll take it on the chin
We are 6 mile bred
That's why you see our sick style yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, Daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks' y'all can imagine is chatty yapping at me
5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I’m Cali swagging, my nigga listen, I’m over the fame
You number 1, I’m number 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin’ with lames, we ain't rolling the same
I’m the best out in this muthafucker
If I could get a cheque out of this muthafucka
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this muthafucka with no regrets
If you ain't living your life for your kids
I ain't giving yo ass no respect
Sean I love you my nigga, I’m out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I gotta break your fucking heart
I gotta climb these fucking charts
I gotta do something that’s innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia’s momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of Carne Asada
I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
Need to know every detail about this Earth
The devil controls it
So before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important
The end is near

[Hook]
[Hook: Chris Brown] x2
A hundred fuckin' bottles (x6)
Stuntin' is my motto
With two-hundred bad models

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
A hundred fucking bottles, I wanna fuck a model
I got her on Patron, she open like a novel
I told her make it wobble while I grab her from behind
Then she made it wind so I ordered some Moscato
A couple hookers and a bucket of that Rose
We up in this bitch, niggas grilling like chipotle
Twenty bottles waters, cranberry and some OJ
Throw that money in the air, watch it fall like a snow flake
I smell like Kush and Dolce
I'm on that gin & juice and I'm feeling like the old Dre
I'll be lying if I said I wasn't drunk
It feels like I smoked a hundred blunts
And I ordered like

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Oh my god waiter
We packed up in this bitch
And I'm feeling the hater vapors, yeah it's hot up in this bitch!
But boy you will never phase me
And I know why you hate me
Cause my fucking cleaning lady
Look hotter than your bitch
And you know I'm about to spend
A hundred racks up in this bar, bar
You don't wanna drink you wanna be noisy Mrs.Aard-Vark
And I know that you not used to rejection
But if you don't get naked get the fuck up out my section!

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
You know I do it the biggest
Got these bitch niggas hating
Got these bad bitches jizzing
Holdin' down my city, but I picked up that commission
Boy, I run my city so you might need my permission
I'm just champagne pissing? Drink it till I might drown
Seen her in a wedding dress, I've seen her in her night gown
Will she take me out to eat, while you'll be trying to eat her out
Got a hundred fucking bottles boing with my weiner out
Damn right, I got a hundred fucking bottles

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2
[Intro: Big Sean & Mac Miller]
I do it, I do
True players what we is, man
True players don't dissolve
It's B.I.G. Sean don
Mac my boy (Let's give them some shit to ride to)
Oh God!

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Now give me everything I ask for or end up in a cast, ho
Never slow down, that's why I'm getting paid fast forward
Standin' on my money, that's a cash flow (Oh)
Smokin' medical, sippin' chemical I need a lab coat
From where they're livin' on food stamps, that's past poor
Thought about it as I got a stamp in my passport
Yeah I made it out, made it up, Butler remain makin' it up
Never satisfied what I make, no such thing as makin' enough
Bitch I'm livin' like it's Monopoly
Tryin' to dodge jail and I'm buyin' up the property
Wifey was down with monogamy, 'til she started massaging me
But you can't have a dollar ho, blame it on the economy
A young player at the tip-top
Bitch niggas hatin', bad bitches wanna lip-lock
I could show you the ropes since I got the game in a slipknot
From a city of g's, I'm just the one that was picked out
Yup

[Hook: Big Sean]
Wake up in the morning, first thing I need is my paper
Paper, paper, paper
You might pass out and die if you try and match my labor
Labor, labor, labor
Man every time they see me they say, "Boy what you doin'?"
"Boy what you doin'?" "Boy-boy what you doin'?"
Bitch I'm tryin' to build a hundred dollar bill skyscraper
Scraper, scraper, stackin' my paper

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Bitch, unzip my pants 'fore you try and take 'em off
Open wide, say, "Ahh" then you cough
See I got so many shows, think it's a season of LOST
Get money, uniform, you could see I'm on my job
Aw damn, bitch you better stand in your lane
All my jams are so insane, you're just Danity Kane
Straight pussy and no balls, rockin' jeans and thug
Sandals that's a faux pas, have 'em all like (Oh God)
Every time we showin' off
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve
They involved into what Gotti was
Iller than you thought you was
Now we in Bugatis ridin' shotty when we shoppin'
For some good shit, I don't claim no hood shit
But I guarantee you I ain't on that Hollywood shit
Hey, unless it's chillin' up at holiday hills
And rap sixteen bars, all of 'em ill, what

[Bridge: Big Sean & Mac Miller]
Say, say, say, say
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve (x6)

[Hook]
[Hook: Big Sean]
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I play the keys, handle dope, Barry Manilow
The game a bitch, but at times she sweet like cantaloupe
Hit the road, key of coke in the manifold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes
Japanese denim, down south numbers
Hit it once, trust it'll make a fat fiend stumble
Do the speed limit, Argo shoes
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too
I'm tippin' strippers but I call it penny pinchin'
She talkin' shit but I can get her titties lifted
My new crib got its own city limit
Motherfucker got his own city in it
Blue marble on the floor, wet as salt water
Underboss I'll just play the holes like a golf course

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
One hundred keys, one hundred please
My gesundheit could make a whole city sneeze
Walked the mud jungle where they grinded out the leaves
So they swarm to my honey comb, hideout for the bees
You know what this sound like, money counters' sound bites
Machine gun fire, name ringin' through the town like
Church bells ringin', know what he was found like?
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white
She live on her knees, I live in a condo in the trees
The air's a little thinner that I breathe
The Iron Man Audi, let the top striptease
My life's in slow motion, but the watch screamin' freeze
Ugh, young nigga gettin' money
The feds' dragnet couldn't take nothin' from me
The decoy car is a crash test dummy
What follows is a hundred of 'em, wrapped like a mummy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
B.I., boi
And they gon' risk a hundred lives
So they could rock a hundred whites
Baguettes lookin' like a hundred lights
Man when Blade died my city cried a hundred nights
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred tight
Every wrong I do I'm steady tryna do a hundred rights
Got her for cheap, compare the price
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White
And don't worry 'bout the info
From where they rob Pintos and could afford Enzos
Cause everybody knows keys open doors, but bricks open windows
Counting a hundred hundreds, more by more
Built this from the tile up, floor by floor
Talk shit, I'll send 'em door by door
Made for the Snow White like 4 by 4s

[Hook]
[Intro]
Imma' be paid forever
I look up
Finally Famous Nigga

[Hook]
I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 1]
All this bread can’t be too good for my cholesterol
Don’t come round’ talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire, dawg
I can’t lie bruh lately I’ve been stressing heavily
Im sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off
You bitch you, FF Imperial til my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti-fuckboy material til I’m dead, I’m living proof
If you focus on what’s in front of ya and not what’s in the peripheral
It’s gone, word? Boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama over comma on comma
I’m bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like its haunted
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments
Went to sleep, snoring

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though
One cook, one clean, the other PMS’ing, no Hablo ingles’
If police have questions they don’t know what that mean nigga
They say Detroit going through the great depression
Still it’s been depressed so long I can’t even tell depression here
My homeboy still gon’ pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb my lil cuz thought the fair was here
Like oh, Im primo, top spot redeemed ho, for who? My team
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego, pussy and flamingos
Got me thinking the fuck I need to sleep for?

[Hook]
[Hook]
I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Bitch, I do what I do, I feel how I feel
Got my drink on the rocks, got my house on the hill
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her, for real
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill
After bill, but I still pay respect to my city
So much man you thought I was in debt for real
Every day is a chase, every night is a thrill
I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will
G.O.O.D music or die ho, shout out to Ye-Ye
Dumped all my other hoes, shout out to Nay-Nay
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay
I'm higher than Day-Day, no off day just pay day
Boy, since I was a baby I swear I was OG, you was a no G
Textin' these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's
When you was a OG, bitch, I'd still be more G
Fuck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares
About not gettin' that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped "Control" just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearin' the same clothes
Going to the same club, taking the same pose
Pillow talkin' with the same hoes
All day about how Em ain't the same Em
And Hov ain't the same Hov
Some niggas never grew up, boy, they only grow old
I guess that what coming up in Detroit do
Finally famous is a Detroit crew
Fuck with me and you Detroit food
End up on the fuckin' Detroit news, better off in the Detroit zoo
Everybody got haters, I swear we been through this
Martin had Malcolm, Caesar had Brutus
Fuck am I sayin', man, Jesus had Judas
I guess I'm alright though, if I just got you, bitch
You gon' pull up friend to friend, I'mma pull up Benz to Benz
While you and her are cheek to cheek, me and her dick to chin
That's the difference between a 9-to-5 and a 10-to-10
Sean Don...

[Hook]

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
They done fucked up now, ha-ha
Mastermind...

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My kilos on ice, my sneakers snow white
I got a place at the Trump, just to pray for advice
My new bitch is Hispanic, got me speaking bilingual
Some call it trickin' cause this bitch thicker than Trina
Anybody wanna motherfuckin' die? Come try me then
You ain't real till you fucked your dawg's ho
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz
Comin' through and I don't fuck with niggas
Bitch you wish you wanna fuck a nigga
Good chance she done fucked a nigga
Turned around and said "fuck a nigga"
Stack on my belt, double M we a cult
Mastermind's in control, so nigga fuck what you thought
16's of coke, all my verses be dope
Fuck XXL cause I'm the source to these quotes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Travi$ Scott]
I've been up from ten to ten, swear I won't sin again
Raising Hell in my residence, Godly presence with presidents
My day job ain't made me shit, public housin' ain't got no fence
And college ain't make no sense, niggas whole home invaded quick
I done work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue
One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain, one problem
Plus the issues, I can't solve them
But it's nothin', and I'm still in the club on the couch still fuckin' up somethin'
Nigga please!
Mama please, I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred G's
Scratch that, 'til I make a hundred million
Then I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion
Who knew one day your son would grow up and learn how to be the boy
Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy
God damn, how you do that?

[Hook]
[Produced by Key Wane and Travis Scott]

[Intro]

My girl the baddest, too, G.O.O.D
I'mma just keep countin'

Okay

[Hook]
I always got a grip, I never slip, I never panic
Got my Rolex set Pacific, while I fly through the Atlantic
And just like a know-it-all, I always got the upper hand
And if I listen to you bitches I would still be on the campus
But instead I'm in The Standard, with a girl who got some standards
Gettin' head in the Jacuzzi and she claim she from Los Angeles
But she ain't come up for air one time, I swear she from Atlantis

[Verse 1]
It's so fuckin' hard to have manners since I bought a manor
I never take off, I just take off her panties
To partially nominated, yeah, yeah nigga you know me
Hop on a song and kill with niggas, who just won all the trophies
Bitch I ain't playin' no more like D. Rose or Kobe, it's Kobe the beef and it's shrimp ravioli
Sean Don, you know me, my cash homophobic, I swear it's so straight
Then I double it up like I cloned it!
My homie called me like "Sean Don, look
You know I got a girl, like you, so my nigga this one's off the books
But could you hook me up with Ariana Grande?"
Seems like niggas just call me for the hook-up or to get up off the hook
I'm back in this bitch like I'm parallel parkin' (swerve swerve)
Get hit with that 18, what's that? Bitch it's two 9's, that's parallel sparkin'
I look up to the stars and God damnit I swear I can hear them shits talkin'
To you they the stars but to me they a target
She said that I'm fine and I say that I'm gorgeous
I'm livin' so lawless, I promise
We just landed, Bora Bora
Champagne, I pour, I pour
Model girls, old Kimora
Fuck more or less, it's more or more
I'm stackin' paper, safe to safe, drawer to drawer, bank to bank, floor to floor
Touch a dollar and them killas be door to door to door to door to door to door
Face to face, Hennessy, case to case
Day to day, I paper chase, amazin' grace
I've been plottin' since '86, and I was born in '88
So what the fuck that make me?
A young visionary
My secretary finna be a millionare
Imma call her military
Finally Famous militarian, I rep that, that
'Till I hit the cemetery
And I'm way too skinny for jail, ho
So I gotta stay rich enough just for the bail, ho
I'm collectin' this change like I live in a well
Heaven on Earth, I could get it through Hell
Bitch, we did it and did it ourselves
So now I'm presidential, my life, presidential, my wife
Residential, the lake, presidential estates
Like my homie Tone said, I could talk about my watch all day
But that's a fuckin' presidential debate

[Verse 2]
My homie talked to me like "Man why the hell you look the way you lookin'?
How you feel the way you feel

Man, tryna sit and build
You got every girl that's in Detroit that's hot tryna come chill
Cause I just lost my nigga Doe B and a fuckin' Uncle Phil
Nigga, Ye layed the Blueprint
So I need hundred dollar bills, new print
Hangin' from my family tree, I'm a nuisance, millionaire
Fuck your two cents, you ain't do shit

Lightin' struck like Zeus sent
Sometimes, to see the bigger picture, man you gotta zoom in
Sean cold, bitch where you been?

For y'all, man I do whatever it takes

[Hook: Big Sean]
Wishing I could rap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I’ve been dreaming ’bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money I could rule the world

If I ruled the world..

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I’m addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I’m addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hard top
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up, Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise
So my dog can quit wearing a 44 up on his waist like it’s his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping Ready or Not
Who was just trying to do it Big, but wasn’t Ready to Die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Is this a dream, well that’s how it feels
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it’s real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I’m a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet the young Dennis, the menace of society
Check my sobriety fuck hoes in varities
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I’m getting doe man these flows ‘gon retire me
Splurging all crazy, switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerv)
Style on Nadal, I’ve been serving ya’ll lately
Cheddar on Federer
Ball ’till I fall, et cetera, et cetera

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Grey walley black stitchin on a train same slang plain Jane
The strial is crispy
24 Karats gazelles clear..
Im so fly real year
Price so la fill weary
Besides killin gear
Its sniffin plain white lines
But jumpin off phenomenal missions
Yep drugs sellers that was in '88
Learnt how to true
Shoot through my coolers
Escape my Uncle huskie karate nigga
Die who stayed in jail
He did a twenty piece
He came home, block movers still know who he is
To us we was kids he said get rich and love life
Dont fuck with no pigs yo
Those days are hazed
Now we in chronic mode
No more plays
Runnin up a rob a clothes home or what
All we had was us and its sucks
Fly niggas is broke
Smoke coke, weed, and dust
I changed for the better
Brand new Beretta
Slappin a nigga face at the steal give me your leather
Through it all I learnt a lot
Plus I burnt a lot
The chronic now returned the clock

[Hook]

Now he can rest in peace while he alive

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Seems life's never at a stand still, even in a photo
Thinking about the ex girl, I hoed though
Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho
The things I think about the most are things I never know though
Like, why don't school teach more mathematics
Less trigonometry and more about taxes
They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards
How about preparing us for life, instead of lab rat us
With a mansion that's about five floors
No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got five more
With the fam that reminded me what I'm alive for
And at the same time remind me what I'd die for
A world where you wouldn't need sleep
That way we'd catch up instead of chase dreams
And finally get the speed boat my dad always wanted
I swear I feel it coming

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Is this a dream, well that's how it feels
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise Hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace of society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varities
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough, man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy, switching lanes in the range swerving all crazy
Style on Nadal, I've been serving ya'll lately
Cheddar on Federer
Ball 'till I fall, et cetera, et cetera

[Hook]
[Intro]
Earl Mac waddup though
Yea Boi

Dirty Glove nigga, That's my fame

[Sayitaintone - Verse 1]
35k, That's a large ass number
Large ass rims, on that large ass Hummer
Damn my bitch got a large ass bumber
But don't you try to touch it cause you will be in a Slumber
See Stuntin' is my job, Rapping is my hobby
Look at Kinko niggas tryna watch me just to copy
See I'm a USB, while them motherfuckers Floppies
Put my dick up on they arm, Now them motherfuckers Cocky
Time to Flex, Diamonds on my neck, Diamonds on my wrist
Time to Flex, Diamonds on my neck, Diamonds on my wrist
Ricky Gliss, Bitches on my dick, they know I'm the shit
Yes I is, I am too legit, too legit to quit, HAMMER

[Big Sean - Hook]
Thirty-five thousand
It'll make yo bitch fine, Then make yo bitch mine
Thirty-five thousand
It'll get yo chain stole, It'll get yo chain Brozed

[Earlly Mac - Verse 2]
Aye Thirty-Five Thousand
Let's a- Let's a keep it comin' (Do It)
Zero divided by two, that's a- That's a gravy number
Okay, what's, in your bank, at the same as your mouth
Got a girl at the bank, and be pullin her account (Ching)
Bounce witcha Boy, You know I'm on a ball
Party at the loft, and we all had a ball
My niggas in the back, and they all got a broad
Go girls sing along, cause we all got a song
Louie with the stacks, and the raps
Spittin' Friggle you
Body been same size as a Wooden Bagel
You niggas better boss up, Get your money up
Like a coin toss up, Aye

[Hook]

[Dusty McFly]
Look, L-look, look
35k, I say 35k
I know some niggas in the D doin' like 35 a day
Profit person controversy, Oh boy we straight
We straight tell the judge to send that Briefcase
We'll make that shit a Brief Case
Boy I'm out here, I'm out here, You on that panty shit
I flex the Lexus with yo bitch while you still drive yo daddy shit
See these Bucks was Thirty-Five, But they retail Twenty-Three
I had the Ice, Throw C's, I had the Ice the nose Piece
Time to flex, On my left's Scum, I'm a Young Fiend
I'm out in Cali, Hightop Ally's Platinum Rolly got the D-Town
Why yo bitch be on my dick so much
I need a Colostomy baby, Cause I shit so much Luh

[Hook]
[Intro]
I look up
Straight up
I gave 'em time, time
Time

[Verse 1]
Now it's back to me nigga
I took my clique turned it to faculty nigga
Took my operation to factory nigga
When I'm in the zone they won't tackle me nigga
I touched down in the city, a fuckin' walkin' target
Still man all my bitches miss me, yeah they miss me but not misses
If you ask me what my interest, all my interest involve interest
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off but you can't cut my percentage (No no)
With the bases loaded all we need's a hit, boy I'ma still swing for the fences (Gone)
I guess you tend to over do it when you come up underprivileged, look
I came to my senses, I can never count on people
I can't even trust the senses in this world full of venom
All I need's my spider senses, my short temper to cool out
Yeah sometimes I need woosah, time to get paid by the goo-ghaas
My office on top of that rooftop, for my mama Myra Anderson
Tell me who gon' be set for life, Myra and her son, fo' sure
One time for the fam, they don't eat, I don't eat
I can't rest on my feet till they all on they feet
They say rest your eyes, I'm just like why?
Bitch I ain't never seen Ben Frank asleep
But I do need that paper like sheet after sheet
I got so much drive ho, look both ways in the streets
When I heard 'bout all these singers and all they naked pictures I'm like "Did my email just leak?"

[Interlude]
Hol' up
Lemme check, oh nah nah nah
They fake, we good, we good

[Verse 2]
The stock goin' up, makin' all the right moves
Boy you would have thought I got tipped off (Tipped off)
You would have thought these niggas fell off a skateboard
The way they take these hoes and trick off (Trick off)
I got a rich girl, I swear to god dawg, man she's like a walkin' ATM
Except she ain't come in with drawls
I know you've been having G.O.O.D. Music withdrawls
I can not deal with the fuckery that fake shit you be in
All that bullshit that you rappin' honestly just makes me cringe
Money doesn't grow on trees, okay someone explain to me
Then how the hell does my whole team just keep on rakin' it all in, hah?
We stressed on, we pressed on
Met with Hov and Bey they told us we next on
We dream that, been slept on, we kept on, we left home
Mama earlobes is VS stone
Her earrings so big she can't even fuckin' hear nothing nigga
Don't give a fuck, no I can't spare one nigga
No I do not have five wheels, I can't spare one nigga
Talkin' like I'm on the last cigarette because I had to take it back to square one nigga
Sometimes to win the war man you got to lose a battle
But if I lose a girl just know my next one gonna be badder
When I pulled up to the church, ooo, they thought it was the pastor
Heaven sent, raisin' hell, same time, what that's the rapture?
Didn't go to class for a second I swear I woulda failed everything
My passport was the only thing I'm passin', flyin' overseas turnin' dreams into habits
Turnin' coach to first classes, mom I'm never movin' back
And I put six years in the flow, okay, no wonder it got mastered
The flow need a dam, why it's doin' too much damage
God damn it's good to get it, even better with ya niggas
Call up my dog who been in and out depression
Said boy how you living, don't lie to me 'bout your feelings
On the outside you look fine but on the inside could be killin'
You act like a comedian but now you're Robin Williams
And now we cryin' rivers that nobody wants to swim in
When one phone call coulda been the one to prevent it
So I'm there for my dogs till we forever on
Till we hit the dealership and cop the Megazord
Nigga that's the red range, white range, black range, green range, pink range
Yellow range, blue range, every neck comes with a few chains (Ohh shit)
I learned that every bad bitch comes with mood swings
Just like Mortal Kombat, Liu Kang, so true man
G-5 down to Mexico, G.O.O.D. Music familiar man
We back at it to let you know, I figure it's best you know
In the middle of recordin' we got caught up in the news
About what happened in St. Louis
We midwest kids that shit coulda happened to us
I looked up the flight tonight
Then I realized man I got a grandma now that's half alive
And honestly what happened in St. Louis probably happened in Detroit like twenty times
I hope we finally see the signs
Puttin' gas off in my Benzo, I ran into a youngin'
The same age as me except he in the trash huntin'
Asked me for some change I gave him like one somethin'
Man to keep that shit a hunnid I wish I woulda gave a hunnid
Cause if you ask me how I'm doin', shit you could do the math
I just bought a five bedroom, four bath
Three story, two car garage, I'm one man
I just did it for my mom, finna do it for my dad
And I ain't even sell my soul, imagine what I coulda got for that
I made something out of nothing, it's like I pulled it out a hat
Man when I'm done they gonna statue me, I turned my clique faculty
Operations to factory, in my zone they won't tackle me
Touched down in the city, the fuckin' walkin' target
Still all my bitches miss me,  yeah they miss me but not misses
If you ask me what's my interest, all my interest involve interest
Nigga
Straight up
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
OK, I'm smoking loudly, I woke them all
I pick up that tree, when it's not fall
I'm gone off that tree, when it's not tall
I'm in love with tree, I'm an avatar
I pick up a O from, my nigga Ralphy
My bro and me, but he is not alphy
Gone off that goo punch, it makes me drowsy
Roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy, Damn, if you ain't know
I made these girl night, smoke a paper and bowls
My ladies like blunts, hit 'em twice if not once
Then I blow 'em off and just pass 'em to my bro
Now catch you getting brain if a nigga not learning
I be spending money if a nigga not earning
Catch me in the backseat if I'm not stirring
And I be rolling up if a nigga not burning, boy

[Hook:]
I got five on it
Have your bowl and get beat
I got five on it
Nothing with that endo weed
I got five on it
If you got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it
Now let's go hop outside

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper:]
You know a nigga like to stay at that cruising altitude up in the sky
Try to fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high
Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarillo smoke
If you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke
Cause this shit I blow can get smelt on the next block
Ain't no middle mans every thing you need is in stock
This Glock is all the security I need
I be solo dolo, when you see me blowing on some weed
Why speed, no need, I be just taking it slow
I be so clean, diesel over powers my cologne
Now all the bad bitches who blazed on shifting this way
Y'all just some white belts, with leaves I am the sensai
Now bow to the bag never, save the best for last
When I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass
Fuck a dime sack, let's cop a quarter pound now
What the fuck is you gon' put down?
Nigga I got five

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
How wired, 6-4 hydraulics
Not stolen, lost my keys, I was high partna'
Fuck you want? This the raw paper not a blunt
You must, got me mixed up with Chip cause, This Spitta
Zig zag a whole zip up, shit strong shoulda' came with a bed pick up
Bitches calling me, wanna smoke beggin' for me to pick up
She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killa'
That weed you smoking brown, fake weed to much make up, clown
Get real smoking green, strawberry fields
High standing up feelin' like I'm layin' down, couple bugie Judy's came round
Actin' all stuck up, now they just stuck from smokin' with us
Had the hallway smellin', Is my windows opening enough?
I hear walkie talkies, Is security coming up?
Fuck

Abstain
You got to abstain
Yungboyz

"Civility is not a sign of weakness."

[Hook]
I'm just trying to let y'all see the way
Abstain and y'all will see some better days
Don't mess with drugs or try to creep
Unless y'all want to end up six feet deep

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Big Sean 'bout to claim the game
When it comes to sex and drugs I stay abstain
I saw all my momma did for an easier world
I'mma mess it all up for a sleazier girl
Don't listen to these fast girls bringing drama
Cause they don't even want to be a baby momma
Listen, let me tell y'all 'bout Percy
Hustling on the corner selling coke and Hershey
Geared up too, straight down to his shoes
He had an E-class Benz on top of 22's
In his own head he thought he was lethal
Until he bumped heads with the wrong people
Now Percy was pissed, a push and a shuffle
A couple cats try to knock P for his hustle
To make a long story short, the gang got to his head
He heard a boom, he was dead
Shot, found under a bridge
Worst thing is he had a baby girl and a kid
Man, now how that sound to you?
Had a wife and a kid then his life was through
Caught up trying to make some money
For real, sex and drugs ain't even funny

[Hook] x 2

[Verse 2 - Part 1: Yungboyz (?)]
I'm a dozen years old, keep my ... froze
Abstain the game, I fall to thugs ...
Avoid the drugs, stop girls from pregnancy, stop boys from sex
All I know's the whole world's correct
All the pollution, stop the confusion
People killing each other for no reason, everyday of the season
Who's looking at the face of the Earth? - Uh
Who's looking at you smoking a blunt? - Uh
Who's looking at you doing bad things? - Uh
Who's looking at you flashing a ...

[Verse 2 - Part 2: Yungboyz (?)]
I run this beat like my name was J Hova
Don't do drugs it will blow your mind over
Don't follow people when the streets dealing weed, it rude
Because your peeps looking straight at you

[Hook] x 3

R-J-98, it's great

[Intro]
Finally Famous in this..

[Verse 1]
It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit
Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March 9th
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbies out, you know?
Stuntin' like a bitch, prom night me out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back
When
I was seventeen
It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had
It all figured out

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]

[Verse 2]
It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times that I missed out on
More than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have
More than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way
Two lying and one bed-never too tired
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin overseas I do buy it, who higher?
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks
SUV swervin like it's O.J.'s car, oh
To me and my dogs is all gettin out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all triggered out
Even when it.. all of it... when you still ain't got....

[Outro]
Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Every minute turns to the longest second, yet never ending
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
How old or young minded someone is
Cause we all start at the same starting point of a woman's legs
But each have our own finish line
Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized
Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized
And remembered for all the right reasons
Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
With who thinks about you:
Your family, your team
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it
Winning the game: hall of fame
[Big Sean]
Yeah, Finally Famous gettin'.. yep
Could you tell me where to go? I need direction
Where are we now? Where's the
Intersection?
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception
In this cold world, it's all about collection
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world
I made a promise to the mirror
That I'd, never ever ever go broke
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

[Hook: Big Sean]
So I'mma drink and smoke and fuck and go-go-go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know-ow-ow
Ow-ow-ow {*8X*}

[Wiz Khalifa]
While I'm flying over literally, flying over cities
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints
Seen the how-to video now he on point
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some
And there's only one, you know you know
Khalifa got, I stay high like Pluto

[Big Sean]
Okay, I'm going hard (I'm going hard), I'm going dumb (I'm going dumb)
I'm
Going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)
I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue, I just hold money, don't hold me up
Rolling in more green than a hole in one; you got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck
I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee

[Hook]

[Big Sean]
...Yeah
Ohh, yeah

"I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy"

[Hook: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same, J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit, and my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets, I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales, I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances, then I just got paid like eight advances
God damn!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything -- everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back? (no more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous, clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
‘Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man, now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do
[Intro: Big Sean]
All night, yeah

[Verse 1: Mr Bentley]
Batter up, forget the sign, here come the wind
He swing away, I knuckle up
Been in the clutch, he drive a stick
No not bat, you missed that, I'm not in fifth gear, switch
Six Bent, chopped and screwed
I ain't talking 'bout the beat, I'm talking 'bout my suit
Keep four hand not like bi-fon-du
When I move they telling me they loving my colours
All that talking 'bout the clothes, I'm talking about the under
Huh, ground sonic kings I rap while pimped with a wease
My audemar maid bring me green tea
Tell foreign election girls, I massage her feet
And she love me long time, my woman stay on her knees
Use the head for prayer only, Bible to say thank you
And now you know for sure that I'm not like you
I'm not shallow, watch out, I just signed a tape
You can't catch a fish unless you got the right bait
And though I have a stable with the best milkshakes
The booty pass, formaldehyde
Abstinent like ebony in fashion league, why? We different
You complain that there's not enough metaphors
I complain that there's not enough candy for us
We got different tastes, you get hot when you're not getting enough green
Uh, some more collard greens? I got enough pepper sauce
You hear things and let 'em go over your head
I write 'em down and Google 'em before I go to bed
'Nough said, pays the parallel park, rim brand, let the driver take a day, Big Sean got the big Benz instead
Yeah, and if you got all that, the result tab, points are factual, red

[Hook: Big Sean]
It's on, roll up, post up
Here come the pig seats and pose up
And tell 'em that we going all night
Cause we know what you like
Bentley know what you like
Big Sean know what you like
88 know what you like
So tell 'em that we going all night, alright?

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I miss Cherie Amore I see
Won't you come be my Cherie Amore for me?
Oui oui, baby I can make it better for we
She got that baby phat fat, not Kimora Lee
I used to be underground like the pipeline
Now I'm everywhere like Wi-Fi
So long on to a Don Corleone
Who was known to be known off performing his songs
And that's honest, I'm from a place that's so unprotected
Need more than a condom
But now a nigga label mates with Common
So how them haters feel? Shit, no comment
You like Kanye? He cool with Hov
Oh, you don't like Hov? Well I know you like Beyoncé
Ain't looking for a wife but, maybe a fiancé
The man on my team from the D like Chauncey
Billups babe, mhmm, and we could leave
I'm tryna beat like 88 keys
High living like we smoke 88 trees
Hot shit baby, I might radiate heat
Excuse me if I don't come all cordial
I don't mean to put you through this whole ordeal
Baby I'm more real
Coming from a city where the niggas keep it popping like Orville

[Hook]
[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this "give or take" world I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'mma let it shine

Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh
No lights but them infrared lights
Long life, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life

[Hook - Rihanna]
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
Ready, set, go
Go, go, go, go
Go til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
"Westside bitch," quote, unquote
Woah there boy, don't go there ho
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named "Big" got bodied?
But every rapper named "Sean" got money?
Well I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20 so I be counting a hundred 100's
Oh my Allah, Lordy lordy lordy, I took your chick
Now you want beef and I am chuckling like I'm Porky
Cause you spend all day with her spooning
I spend all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
They want these bullets to book it for me
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gonna book report me
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard, because bitch I'm an emergency

[Hook - Rihanna]

[Bridge - Big Sean]

So good, so good, Westside, so hood
I do it.. B. I.... G

[Verse 3 - Drake]
Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding
Weezy with me, I just stepped out of the strip club
Made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I don't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your own girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with ME when she tells you she needs some "me time"
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
I'm really about to go Spring Break now start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long 'til they can see the lights

And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one
So call it a night, call it a night
And I run this, so y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that
All in the Sprite, all in the Sprite
