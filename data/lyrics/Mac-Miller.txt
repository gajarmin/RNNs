[Intro]
Some people, oh, whoa, oh-oh...
Yeah, people say, people, oh-oh, say...

[Verse 1]
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking 'bout her all the time
I've never seen somebody put together perfectly
What do I have to do to call you mine
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'mma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

[Hook]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
I wish, we could go and be free, once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever and never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view, let's leave it all in the rear view
You don't have to cry, you don't have to cry

[Verse 2]
Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I ain't so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shooting stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did, I think I'm still myself

[Hook]
[Verse 1]
It's the, rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
Bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rapping head honcho, rocking shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my g pass, none of your fucking beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish them
Tryna find a balance reaching from my equilibrium
Fools I pity them, I'm not a human I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men
I ain't saving nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'till the angels come and skipping all the famous functions
How do the famous function?
The A list can't be trusted
I strong arm them like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich this is piracy (piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fucking eyes to see
Come and die with me

[Hook]
Cause everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies

[Verse 2]
Uh, okay
My mind is Yoda I'm on Ayatollah
These other rapper just a diet soda
I find Jehova in the darkest places
Empty as apartment basements
This a marathon gentlemen go ahead and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
Don't come up missing
Tell your bitch that you've been trippin' now you on vacation
Rapping like it's automated
Lights I keep em' on like Vegas
Love I'm making so hot I'm turning hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star I'm way farther with the constelations
Contemplating suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind it's a prison homie leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets
Ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewriting history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Running to the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle I'm a show you the commercial
I've been popping like a kernel
Reading Justin Beiber's journal
Treat you like a urinal

[Hook]
[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yeah you know I'm smokin' at the beginnin' of the song like a damn rapper
Aww man, man, it's crazy bein' so rich, damn

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When it still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we were on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd's brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
And thick lens coverin' my eyes now
They ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if this a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doing fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
And posted up drowsy
In the cut so much that it's pus 'round me
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (nah)
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin
Between you and all these fuck niggas
Is about as large as it gets
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' cause he ain't workin'
Like a long distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlison win, nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds branch out
And I'm out with my face in the shallow, drownin' again

[Hook: Mac Miller]
I've been drownin' with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

[Verse 2: Da$h]
Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian
Just look at the state he's in... yo, yo
The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost
Facin' a port out in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman while that cape was off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a mothafucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane
It was like Cobain hit his last number... mothafucka

[Hook: Mac Miller]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Isn't he dizzy off the up's and down's
Got a little Whitney, put it in a blunt for now
She was supposed to get me high, why the fuck I wanna die now?
And I'm strung out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house, I told the bitch slow down
Stop runnin' your mouth
You holdin' my money, just shut up and count
My right nostril hasn't worked in a week
Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheep
Me, I'm swervin' in the Jeep
Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street
How I'm playin' my shit'll wake a baby up
I get her faded, put her back in the labia
All my life I've been afraid of powder
All my life I've been afraid of power
Where did all that go?
The wrong decision always called my phone
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones
I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone
That can save me from the war unknown
Shoutout to Soulo (SOUL!) and rest in peace Alori Joh
The devil on the other side of the glory hole
Any time, any place, you could bet I'ma eat
Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road
Look at all these new faces
I see, I see, I see
They're comin' on the plane but they're leavin' in suitcases
Been a criminal before scales were digital
Used the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics
Hate myself up to strangers
But the raps are just way too flagrant, so
Here I go, here I go
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary
I've never been religious but I feel like the scripture's got it all there
It's not just gypsies and fairies, this could be my last breath
I'ma take my time, cause I'ma go out the same way I came in
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind

[Outro: Mac Miller]
You are standing in the shallow soul
You are speaking with the shallow soul
Shallow soul
I've been drowning with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinking from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
(fades)
[Hook: Nas] (x2)
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike nike nike nikes

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Aye lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em
Blue suede shoes stay crispy like bacon
Nikes on my feet make my cypher complete
Uh, I stay shining like the lights on the street in the night
Revis take me shoppin' when I'm up in New York
Hit the shoe store go and cop a few more
You at the mall getting dinner at the food court
I'm at LA eatin' 22 course
Young boss bitch, paper in my pockets
I got a closet filled with shoe boxes
Mom says my spending habit a little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes wear-em-out
Hit the club bitches pull they cameras out
Livin' in a dream they beginnin' to believe
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed
Shit, with what I'm spittin' they should give me a degree
Good liquor what I'm sippin' isn't cheap
Uh, finna blow, don't snooze, don't sleep
All I really need is some shoes on my feet

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I make 'em so mad, they got no swag
Pippens on my feet they the throw backs
Look, my money good but these hoes bad
So they stay attached to my gonads
Wakin' up to a few L's
Open up my closet to that new shoe smell
I guess I'm goin' well
Smoking all the weed that I used to sell
But once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now we sellin' tapes out my shoe box
Any spot just set up my shop
Ya mad that ya girl always says that I'm hot
Shes buyin' my t-shirt but shes spendin' your guap
Say wuddup if you see me around
Nike Airs separate my feet from the ground

[Hook]

[Intro: Delusional Thomas]
Hallelujah, thank God I have a future
Praying I don't waste it getting faded
Cause I'm smoking *censored* 'til I'm coughing up tar
Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Tripping out, looking at a bunch of Google map stars
Shit, they got a app for... that

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
But me, I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm living paradise, so would I have to worry 'bout?
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure
Find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
The difference between love and war inform me
I'm above the norm
But, give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhyming like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm running from, but I'm running still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you ain't talking 'bout some money I'mma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's letting me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow
That's just me all wilding out and being extra doe

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly, watching horror movies
With some foreign groupies, thinking this decor suits me
I do drugs to get more loopy, I'm in tune
To ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful
Looking out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet
I think I'm JFK's final speech
They try assassinating all of my beliefs
But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind
And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same
I'm looking my window ashing on the pane
Shit, wonder if I lost my way

[Verse 3: Delusional Thomas]
Don't you ever wanna hide away
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today
I'll greet the devil with a smiling face
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with Freemasons
My girl's switching the locks, the keys keep changing
Dreaming of places, my own personal creations
If there's a party in heaven I plan to leave wasted
Retracing my steps way back to Biblical times
We-we all gon' end up meeting at the finishing line

[Outro: Mac Miller]
And these words that I command you today shall be in your heat
And you shall teach them diligently to your children
And you shall speak of them when you sit at home
And when you walk along the way, and when you lie down
And when you rise up, I am the lord, your god
[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Think I can see a fucking halo, about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano, some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches, he got special needs
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping
Al be fucking with the fader, sipping mind eraser
Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it
Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public
We the Republican government, abundance of substance
Having consumption to fuck a bitch
You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

[Hook: Action Bronson]
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle

[Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first
After rapping take my people out for octopus
We all deserve it; dedication to the fam
Don't hold your hand out for nothing if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
Blow the dice, roll them chips, hit another trip
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the 6 in the summertime
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma
My look is Jay Buhner, dawggy, cause some of us just age sooner
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio, I fixed the game
Between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor, chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
I came from that basement, now look at this view
Making this money, blowing it all
Fuck what you did, just show me results

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]
Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly mothafucka
Leather to the foot, horses I lead 'em to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no mothafuckin' faking that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs

[Outro: Loaded Lux]
You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name say "Crack dealing trap nigga
Slash cap peeler, back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my minds first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir
Taps liquor the pass 'til it
Goes around the room like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
Yoohoo, I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure to look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you Beastie Boy
You can't match your killer with that wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were strucking blows, bloody nose for your honey rolls
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You're a bully's Best Day Ever
With those Nike's on your feet
Coming through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga give me that shit
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac
With the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say "ow", make 'em say "oh"
The hoes that tell me "yes", the same ones that tell you "no"
Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope

[Hook: Mac Miller]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone, move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie I'll be sure

[Hook]
[Intro: Big Sean & Mac Miller]
I do it, I do
True players what we is, man
True players don't dissolve
It's B.I.G. Sean don
Mac my boy (Let's give them some shit to ride to)
Oh God!

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Now give me everything I ask for or end up in a cast, ho
Never slow down, that's why I'm getting paid fast forward
Standin' on my money, that's a cash flow (Oh)
Smokin' medical, sippin' chemical I need a lab coat
From where they're livin' on food stamps, that's past poor
Thought about it as I got a stamp in my passport
Yeah I made it out, made it up, Butler remain makin' it up
Never satisfied what I make, no such thing as makin' enough
Bitch I'm livin' like it's Monopoly
Tryin' to dodge jail and I'm buyin' up the property
Wifey was down with monogamy, 'til she started massaging me
But you can't have a dollar ho, blame it on the economy
A young player at the tip-top
Bitch niggas hatin', bad bitches wanna lip-lock
I could show you the ropes since I got the game in a slipknot
From a city of g's, I'm just the one that was picked out
Yup

[Hook: Big Sean]
Wake up in the morning, first thing I need is my paper
Paper, paper, paper
You might pass out and die if you try and match my labor
Labor, labor, labor
Man every time they see me they say, "Boy what you doin'?"
"Boy what you doin'?" "Boy-boy what you doin'?"
Bitch I'm tryin' to build a hundred dollar bill skyscraper
Scraper, scraper, stackin' my paper

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Bitch, unzip my pants 'fore you try and take 'em off
Open wide, say, "Ahh" then you cough
See I got so many shows, think it's a season of LOST
Get money, uniform, you could see I'm on my job
Aw damn, bitch you better stand in your lane
All my jams are so insane, you're just Danity Kane
Straight pussy and no balls, rockin' jeans and thug
Sandals that's a faux pas, have 'em all like (Oh God)
Every time we showin' off
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve
They involved into what Gotti was
Iller than you thought you was
Now we in Bugatis ridin' shotty when we shoppin'
For some good shit, I don't claim no hood shit
But I guarantee you I ain't on that Hollywood shit
Hey, unless it's chillin' up at holiday hills
And rap sixteen bars, all of 'em ill, what

[Bridge: Big Sean & Mac Miller]
Say, say, say, say
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve (x6)

10 hoes in the backseat and they all tryna get fucked
10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat, backseat, backseat

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
90's flow, mid though, catch us crawlin' in that Caddy
There he go, smokin' dope, man I swear it came from Papi (Hola)
Ab-Soul, so you know, don't be actin' unfamiliar
West Side, Del Amo, I got it tatted on my spirit
Spiritual, 10 hoes, hostage in the CTS
Lambo, windows up, that molly might make them undress
Oh for sure, Soulo ho­e, minus E and add the 3
3 eyes to the third, word to the 33
Holy shit, who is this? They call me the God MC
Perform miracles and shit, I turn water into lean
Man I'm always gettin' shaded cause I stay around some tree
Man I'm always gettin' faded, but no barbershop for me

10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat and they all tryna get fucked
10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat and they all tryna have fun
Don't stop
(Can you fit 10 hoes in your backseat?)
Made all them bitches lap up, say what
(You made all them women lap up)
Yup, 10 hoes in the backseat and they askin' me for them drugs
I got 10 pounds in the trunk, 10 pints in my backpack

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
I made 10 racks off 10 to 4s, I spit crack, need 10 a show
Keep bad chicks with their skin exposed, my hoes thicker than winter clothes
10 deep so they finna roll, gon' lap up, girl, make some space
10 pints in my backpack, more seals than a naval base
I stole a 6, I'ma drink an 8, the other deuce, I'm gon' save it
I know these rapper dudes hate it when they hear me on their boo's playlist
It's Young Fresh and my dues paid, fresh pair of cool greys
And I keep pounds on me, like I'm in the U.K
I'm on point like Jeremy Lin, and I'm reppin' that H-Town
Soon as all of her girls is in, I made 'em bust it like Greyhound
That's right, I'm a man, ho, haters cannot stand Short
No matter if it's made by Gucci, Louis V or Jansport, I

[Hook: Ab-Soul]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
10 mil' in my back pocket, 20 thou on these rap watches
Talkin' money, nah that's obnoxious, fuck these hoes, pass chronic
Came through, easily, Ab-Soul the new Eazy-E
Talkin' shit, leave him be, I'm chiefin' weed, watchin' DVDs
Eatin' 5 star meals in my home
My crib look like Johnny Depp's in Blow
Got a cast around my arm, but I'm still smackin' rappers
Don't fuck with these bars, no homie, that's disaster
Sittin' on a couple million
Will please someone give Vince a fuckin' Cinnabon (Aye, I'm hungry nigga)
You talkin' shit but where your facts at?
Bitch I got 10 million in my backpack

(What are you afraid of?) (4x)
Uh... 1 2 1 2...
Sometimes I see the uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Sometimes I see the world for how fucked up it really is
I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
Then I couldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows though
Get a pay check, spend it all on polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe though
Now I'm dressin' so expensive, for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'
I got a family, can't afford a coat
So I leave a little paper there before I go
Spend a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
Made me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just tryna set you free
Remember love, if you can't, remember me

[Hook]
Dear people on earth after I die, what's the weather like?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe get a second life
This time I'm a get it right

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
It's either God or the devil with these drugs I'm on
I don't know if we were meant to see it all like this
Still, plantin' seeds so my money long
Money addict, it's a habit that palms gon' itch
I wish we could just all get rich
Sometimes not havin' money is all I miss
And yet these hoes that roll up on my dick
The all American girl, that's just a blond head bitch
Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?
Could we figure out what God might've miss?
It's funny that these questions never get an answer
Life a bitch sometimes you got to reprimand her
Never understand her, why should I even try?
Live forever then you never feel the need to die
This a letter, open it to set you free
Remember love and remember me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
What does it mean to be a sensation? Do you have to be sensational?
And how you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam, watchin' Paid in Full
I never had good grades in school but, shock the world is what I came to do
I got a song I wanna play for you, so can you sing that back to me?
(2x)
[Hook: Styles P]
If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Black folks, crack smoke
Big head scientist, island of Patmos
Fake tears and snakes here
Question my thug cause I ain't shoot a nigga in 8 years
Sets superior imperious rex sket interior airing ya nearing ya death inferior
Listen, it's so thuggish to sniff 'caine
Make me cold-blooded, motherfucker, I'm Rick James
Hell of a drug, Sean Price, hell of a thug
Hang with Sheen, I got elephant blood
Listen to me, y'all better not listen to me
Fuck around and catch a case, trying to be like P
Listen, a ring on you brother, I'm harming you daily
Clown, Ringling Bros and Barnum and Bailey
P, now download this on a disk
If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this
Bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Phew, just made the cut baby
Let me light this motherfucking weed I'm smoking
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
For real
Light the crack pipe so I know it's real

Whoa, young Bill Murray
I'm 21, but I feel 30
A little birdy out in Jersey said my raps were too wordy
Told his bitch to suck my dick and do a curtsy, dirty, slurpy
I smell earthy, puttin' curry on my turkey
I'm Blade 3, you're more Blades of Fury
Blonde dykes love me for my Klondike tummy
Getting all types of money, I'm with Sean Price, dummy, P
Polite stuntin' at a nice white luncheon
Met your wife, pipe plumbing, led to all night humping
Oh no, the end of your life coming
We the tribe, don't make me Phife something
My bitch from Beirut, she get loose
110 proof, call me Zeus, pussy tighter than a wet suit
Jesus Christ, he so nice

[Hook]
[Hook]
They think that I'mma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up
Said I don't care, I'm livin' it up

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, they wonder where I'm gone be at, posted with my chief sack
Seat back, keep this shit together like a knee cap
He's that, bad mothafucker with an attitude
Haters tryin' to play him, I ain't even gettin' mad at you
Fruity Judy spittin', but he rappin' like kiwi
I, receive better than your satellite T.V
Three beat rhymes, that'll give 'em hebegebies
Hoes showin' titties, tryna to get a CD free
Please, grass stay together like its welted
Turnin' down groupies, now they think I'm gettin' selfish
I'm not cocky, I'm just confident
Wave you off, move along, if you not convinced
Got way too much shit up on my shoppin' list
While your broke, doin' choke, tryin' to copy Vince
Hop off the dick, let me be on my way
I don't pay attention, stay havin' good days
So

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, as I'm ridin' next to Tree J, speedin' down the freeway
Headin' to the money, no pause, no delay
Racin' like a relay, hear me through the PA
Chief till I'm sleepin', fuck the D to the EA
I'm in this game, no playin' for the pesos
Try and dip into this cheese like queso
Classes never seem to be there when they take role
I was runnin' to my dream, tryna to make mo'
Music, make another song
They tell me they supported, they was hatin' all along
Love greater than the hate that I was gettin' didn't phase me for a second
So lately I've been gettin' kinda crazy, and I mention
To my lady when she stressin' that I'm cakin', it's a blessin'
I'm just tryna to get her in the right direction
You wanted war, then I'm comin' prepared
Most Dope, put ya thumb in the air, mothafucker

[Hook]

[Outro]
"I think I'm having an overdose and so is my wife"
"Overdose of what?"
"Marijuana, I don't know if it had something in it, can you please send rescue?"
"Did you guys have fever or anything?"
"No I'm just, I think we're dying"
"How much did you guys have?"
"I don't know we made brownies..."
"And I think we're dead, time is going by really really really really slow."
[Intro]
Uh huh, Uh huh Uh huh, yeah. x8

[Verse 1: DJ Clockwork:]
Smacking asses till they wiggle
How'd I get myself in this pickle?
Dick trickle, hoes racing fast tryna chase that issue
Who's the best? Point them out
Fresh Kiwi, hold the sprouts
Shave the ice, Lemonade, seeds thats the chosen route
Life is what you make it, live that shit like you supposed to
We coastal
We crashing hoes like Fogell, this ain't Superbad
Yo ho, she sounds super mad, Yo bitch showing she super sad
My name is aye aye aye uhhhhhh

[Hook: DJ Clockwork]
It's 4:48, you ain't cutting the cantaloupe straight
It's 4:48, you ain't cutting the fucking apples right
It's 4:48, you ain't rinsing the grapes off right
It's 4:48, you ain't taking the kiwi right
It's 4:48, you ain't cutting the bananas straight
It's 4:48, you ain't baking the muffins right
It's 4;48, you ain't stuffing the stuffing right
It's 4:48, you ain't eating the peas right
It's 4;49, you ain't drinking the water right
It's 4:50 right now, and I'm out the booth

[Verse 2: Smoke Mo' Purp]
Came with the motherfucking raps, blowing cocaine with a hundred dollar bill, Rice
Love to make a bitch ass clap, hit it from the back then I'm off that pill
Sprite with a fo', Edgar Allen Poe, do a lot of blow can't feel my face
Bitch I'm chilling, MTV show killing, 4 million dollars in the bank God damn
Armani, Versace, Dugatti, Buggati
Last name Cash and my first name Johnny
I don't slap you, your bitch might
(Yo Willy Whips, what that dick like?)
Polo hat, Polo chinos, Polo socks, Polo shirt
So many horses in my stable, the fact been out, I had polo first
My new rap name is Smoke Mo' purp, step in the club and hoes gon twerk
I-I-I-I-I-I am fashion, am fashion
Yo bitch hopped on the dick, and then she hopped on my bandwagon
That money thats all mine, that pussy thats all mine
You don't need to ask around, I'm the best rapper of all time
[Produced by Thundercat]
[Hook]
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest
It's (5 o'clock in the morning)
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
The streets empty 'round 5 o'clock
Driving by the cops
Low key microscopic to the eyes that watch
Everything a hustle when you trying come buy some guap
I'm a keep grinding 'till I'm still shining like a diamond watch
Me and bo-head here bringing you the truth
With all night sessions we just living in the booth
Strong bars like we spitting out 150 proof
Take shots get loose 'till you spitting up yo' food (like ohh)
You see that I'm a need a recap
Grab a weed sack cheif that 'till my feet flat
I got this covered like a pro bowl d-back
Breathe rap been a been known to make the beat clap
Need cash so I'm trying to move some trees fast
Tell you where to meet at
Ask you where the cheese at
People 'round the city see the younging and respect the grind
Putting in the extra time
Guaranteed next to shine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Boaz]
I rise before the sun come up and get my day started
Pray to the most how I roll up my hays and spark it
And then my paper starts to roll in
Money in paper bags
Hammers with laser tags
We grown men
Out on the corner 'till the early morn'
The blood of a hustla getting mines before I was born
You get stormed by these hot ass bars
From me and Easy Mac
Crusin' in lac smoking weed with no season at
There ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us (why?)
Except these labels anticipating and waiting on us
They get the BBS's radios play us
Then we blaze in the Benz's
And sit this off on BBS's
And from P.A to Texas
These niggas know about me
International hustler can't move no snow without me
Or get no dough without me
Niggas getting hardly stacking on her
Early bird get the worm
I'm knocking at the crack of dawn

[Hook]
[Mac Miller:]
Hey, hey. . . What up, Term?
Uh-huh. . . and it go like
I'm just gonna let the beat ride out a little bit
You know what I mean?
Just so you can feel what I'm feeling
Alright, now that we on the same page
Alright, look. . . hey, hey

[Mac Miller:]
We be making that classic shit
Rapping on some Statik hits
Immaculate Mac'll spazz and laugh at all these average kids
Be with the baddest bitch
Style's so miraculous
And you heard me spit
But you don't even know the half of it
Keep it funky hungry like I need some money
Cheeky so my speech is funny
Own it like it's bees and honey
Tweedle-dee and dummy
Trying to take some Gs up from me
Yeah they hate me but they love me
I be sillier than putty
Motherfucker, y'all be shapeshifting
Hate spitting, but with them wack bars
Take pictures with 8 bitches, boy we some rap stars
Used to fuck around and just kick it in my backyard
Now I'm on the road, hitting shows with some bad broads
Me and Term be on that hip hop shit
Surprised this young one here know what real hip hop is
Everybody here be like, 'Oh, this my ish'
Hey yo Term, go on kick that shit

[Termanology:]
Listen my mellow the metal will turn you into jello
Claimin' that you peddle with mettle but never in the ghetto
Kill a fellow rapper, immaculate never will I settle
With a middle class budget cause buddy I get the cheddar
Scrape up you amateurs, babble on when I batter ya
Bakin' brownies with hash in 'em, bachelor who be smashin' them
Gucci wallet attractin' 'em hoochies always be flashin' them
Loosies yo I be stackin' 'em so really I'm imaginin'
The wax killer, with Mac Miller my rap's iller
Just ask spitter, for currency I'm a cash getter
I smash Twitter and Facebook, you straight shook
I do a song with you homie and it's a great look
My shotty handle is Armani, they all on me
Call mami and twist her back out like origami
I pour Johnny Walker in my cup
Ever since a little pup
I knew me and Stat was gonna live it up

(Sicker than your average-- who's really the shit?)
(1-9-8-2. 1-9-rhymes-too.)

[Mac Miller:]
I'm better than good it sounds so
Now they mad they hating on him
Girlies be waitin' I'm skating a figure 8 up on 'em
Bitches be making me lemonade and cupcakes
Now you on my dick bitch, tell me how my nuts taste

[Termanology:]
And we like 'fuck jake', trying to get this puff cake
We bad boys for real, homie you trunk space
I'll put a body in a Maserati from the lottie
I'm packing y'all in, a Rottie mixed with the Dalai Lami

[Mac Miller:]
You mad I ain't as lame as you
Eating beats like some Asian food
Flowing that's uncontainable
Rooftop, amazing view
A million rappers in the game but I'mma make it soon
They spending money for me, now I'mma pay for you

[Termanology:]
Squash you like a tomato do
Burners while high will blaze at you
My mami take the pillow and bite it when I be lacin' it
It's undebateable
Roll around with a hater crew
Mac was born in '92 but he rhyme like he from '82

(Sicker than your average-- who's really the shit?)
(1-9-8-2. 1-9-rhymes-too)
(1982, the album coming soon, bitch!)
[Scratch out til end]
[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Y'all is dead weight, less great, always getting second place
I tend to race ahead of pace, dipping while I'm dressed in Bape
Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain't Dicaprio
This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall
Capicola sandwich's are tasty from Primanti's
I'm a 5'7" giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning
Girls want makeup, get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming
For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more
With money, cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for
Feeling like a hundred wars are going on currently
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus
Acting like you fucking with me, that's some shit I can't excuse
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe
You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works
I plan to do, something that ain't tangible
Now I'm 'bout to hand it to the homie Michael Rocks, hear what he saying to you

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
Take a trip, took a molly out with Banco Populari
The word around the city is he sit in a Ferrari
I told myself I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry
That's my bad, I party 'til my cardies get foggy
Can't keep her hands off of me, got her lock, then lost the key
Weed smoke, make it hard to see, we go harder then the Carter one
Excuse me baby pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?
Not saying it's coming soon, but I want the real show
Get me the treatment that you getting all the heels for
The shit they paying all the bills for
Man, I missed it, that cake taste delicious
They can't wait for vacations, paid for, by pictures
I'm feeling good, I'm peeling bills, I'm real as hell
I don't front, I roll blunts and papers
I don't fuck with fakers, your girl is asking me if I'mma take her
I'm straight though, you see, I'm booked up 'til April
That's mine, that's me, I take those, you tryna see some pesos
Then shake though, you get exactly what you pay for
Stop acting like you can't go, you swagging to the ankles
I feel you baby, hopefully I look familiar maybe

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you will never ever get it because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holding the drugs
And you can never ever see her because

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Life a cliche, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land, and then the bags come
We walking on this planet seeking action
Break a girl's heart, sorry Miss Jackson

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Mac Miller]
And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top

[Outro: Mac Miller]
I'm so high, won't you think about that babe
On some other shit that tend to make me act crazy
15 thousand, blow it on clothes
6 in the morning, still sitting here throwed
I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home
[Hook: Mac Miller]
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it’s a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world

[Verse 1: Mac miller]
I got my cup filled, bitches all around me on some bachelor shit
Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks
Around the world I use my atlas make a map of it
Globe trotter, ho hopper, superstar asterik
People always wonder so they ask us who we are
Rolling up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar
Wanna be on top and tryna to get there by tomorrow
See the money, bitches, bubbly, designer clothes, foreign cars
But I ain’t never gonna change
Different city everyday
You hear these people scream my name
They think I’m underage
They don’t know shit about the game
Till I’m drunk as fuck, on the couch, pouring out champagne
Living life like it’s my job, and I don’t ever take a day off
Shit ain’t been the same since I seen my music take off
I be on some “I don’t give a fuck” shit
Still with my homies I came up with so celebrate the fact that we young, rich, and famous

[Hook]
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it’s a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France
Bitches of every nationality get up and dance
So, let me see your hands please
We makin’ noise like a stampede
So much smoke up in this bitch you can’t breathe
Somewhere where it’s sandy, Cali or Miami
This the only way to do never made a plan B
Can’t we, get it how we live
Tonight ain't the night to chill, tonight we do it big
Girls, comin’ all dressed up and they takin’ off their clothes
We know your man an ameteur so come party with some pros
You need something new, I know your life is gettin’ old
We ain’t gettin’ younger so tonight's the night to go
So, crazy, treat it like your last night
Even if you broke, spend tonight like you cash right
It’s the fast life, don’t worry baby we ain’t here to slow it down
Tonight we goin’ crazy and tomorra’ you can hold me down

[Hook]
[Hook]
Girl I don't wanna share you
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by, baby all I'm gonna want is you

[Verse 1]
Look, they told me never fall in love, it never works out in your favor
You way too young and right now that's just human nature
You think you love her, but you don't
Think you gon be with her for the rest of your life, you prolly won't
But on my side, shorty just attacked me from the blindside
Used to be a player now I'm sidelined
Connect like Wi-fi, mixed like tye-dye
She feelin cute wanna wear a little lingerie, voila
It ain't a sexual thing though
We be stayin' up smokin' weed out her window
In love with me now, she never huntin' me down
I'm tryna have it all, she ain't comin' around
It's like a never endin' chase, longer than a marathon
See the smile on her face, and I can't help but carry on
I know you love me don't lie (don't lie), but you just gotta be mine
Cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look, I know this girl who want the world to call her own
Goin' through these dudes like some minutes on a phone
And once she leave, she ain't comin' back home
Hit the road forgettin' about everybody she know
Miss hasn't called me in four days
But then we hit the bed and she obsessed with foreplay
Hey, she tryna be a lil player, think she cute too
But I'mma yank her out the game like a loose tooth
When the boy blow, I know she worried
About all these girls who approach me actin' flirty
See that's the thing thing, I don't give a fuck
I want your heart so baby give it up
In this life girl, all we can do is try
Forget that dumb stuff, it's just you and I
We can travel round the world movin' through the sky
Or we can stay right here and you'll be mine

[Hook]
[Bun B]
The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and the status and the game
But it's deeper than all that

[Mac Miller]
They just want the women and the cars
Getting high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that

[Bun B]
They thinking that it's all about the shows
And the chains hanging down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that

[Mac Miller]
We're here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believe me, it's all that

[Verse 1 - Bun B]
I got that money on my mind, the grind
And the ability, the knowledge and the know-how
Stamina and agility
Soon as I step in the facility these haters start
Testing my civility, I'm telling you
They killing me. Some of them feeling me
And some of them be grilling me but
I just blow my kush smoke up to the ceiling G
Yeah, and take a toke of the Swisher smoke
They got the paint and the brush, but not the picture, loc
What is an emcee if he can't rap?
Just a monkey with a mic just waiting to get slapped
What is a DJ if he can't scratch?
The one rotten apple that's spoling the whole bag
What is a B-Boy if he can't break?
Might as well do the Dougie or even the Harlem Shake
And what is a graffiti artist if he don't tag?
No homophobia, but he's a fag
Cause it's deeper than all that..

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Mac Miller]
One time for the world cause we do it for y'all
That logo light up in the sky when the studio call
Moving the crowd, get em loud without a gimmick
Spit with a golden ticket, I'm whipping it up in minutes
My feet up in this game
Rapping even made a divot
Don't worry about the critics
If it's happening now, forget it
For my heart is where I give it
Stay thinking about the future
When I'm rich, I'mma call my mom before I call the movers
These haters are just losers
Hate to see you winning
Gave my all from the beginning
I'm in it for extra innings
Here to change the world like a change clothes
Wouldn't mind a little bankroll, pesos
But I"m right here for way more
What is somebody if they can't love?
A hater.. someone give em a hug
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
And homie, believing is all that..

[Hook]
[Intro]

Uh, Uh. Yeah yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
When you finally gettin' paid, everything be feelin' great
Went from diggin' in the crates, to chillin', gettin' faded
Don't live a normal life, but I hope you can relate
And it's hard to see it right, blowing smoke in all your faces
Coolin' at the crib, can't believe it's where I live
Can't believe it's what I'm doing, can't believe I got this big
Can't believe this what I'm driving, can't believe this what I'm wearin'
Yeah the Benz is pretty cool, but I need a McLaren
When they see me out in public, dap me up, say what's good
Don't need to take a picture, it's better if you look
Going for your Queen, give a fuck about a rook
Papa was a player; took some pages from his book

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
[X4]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
To the seven telly and it's peanut butter, jelly
Chillin' with da homies, smoking weed and watching Belly
Headin' to the deli, rollin' with some Pirelli's
Now I'm gettin' money like 2001 Nelly
They wanna take my photo, my finger in my nose though
Dutch's from the Cogos
Playin' water polo
Above the ozone, young Han Soulo
You start rapping and I'm like no no no no no, no
Do you get it? Tell me can you feel it
I'm only gonna get a bottle from you if you steal it
Time on this money, money all the time
Lookin at me funny cause your money in decline

[Hook]

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Big bank won't throw loans or free things
Stack that dough, go get yo paypuh!
Dividends could devastate ya
Make it right don't let it play yeah
Big bank won't throw loans or free things
Stack that dough, go get yo paypuh!
Dividends could devastate ya

Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
All the...
[Hook]
We spending all this money
Getting all this shine
Hitting all this cuddi
Spending all this time
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for better or for
All this money
Getting all this shine
And its all so funny
Cause its all just fine
Im feeling better than ever before
This my life for better or for worse

[Verse One]
I'm looking out the window
The kid stayin' lit like a Zippo
You hatin' I don’t trip bro
It's gravy cause your bitch know
Cup of henni, I sip slow
The spins, yo
Hit the stage to bust a rhyme call me Flipmode
This, that the other rhymer make it happen
Travel all around the country in a station wagon
Take it back, you reminisce on all your favorite classics
My words play more than madlibs
I got plenty lyrics
They got plenty adlibs
Want a holy spirit
My fathers on some rap shit
Listening to Tribe, getting high puffin loud
See some people ridin by
Come outside say what up
I ain't nothing like a star
I’m chilling, layin back
Travel all around the whole world
Enjoying everwhere I'm at
Meeting different people
Eating different food
No one like a gourmet meal
More than Que

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
They actin like they jealous
Everybody be thinkin’ that they was cool
Getting money since my mommy was dropping me off at school
Now I got a whip to cruise in
You the Pirates so you losin’
Im in the news, you let them bring your news in
I bowl strikes you always leavin a few pins
I do me you keeping up with them new trends
I got fam you worried about makin new friends
Im in my PJs you had to wear your suit in
Thinkin without doing, where, how, why me
Relax myself kick it like Tai Chi
You could find me, only where I’m at
There ain't no other Mes
They be checkin on my stats
How Cat I find them up in a tree
Homie be spittin bars they ain't fuckin with me
Im just turning up the heat to 100 degrees
Spittin like I got a razor blade stuck in my teeth

[Hook]
[Hook]
Good weed, fine women, fast cars, new clothes, and I'm ready to go
The further we get the bigger the check new cities more people to know
I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin', but that's how it's always been
I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin', but that's how it's always been

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah a little bit of Kush, break it down, sprinkle it in the joint shit
The type of stoner who be late for his appointments
Fresh white Crest shit, good
Festive, infest the internet, now my shit congested
Got stupid flow, musically amazin'
Let it out like water, so I'm fluid with the cadence
New York, drove up, flew up took a train then
Hit smoke, when I got here we blazin'
Smoke weed and maintain
And Most Dope with me at any of my engagements
Bunch of fine bitches, line em' up and arrange em'
Black, white, Asian, got a whole compilation
They say I'm talkin' crazy, but I'm young and I don't give a fuck
You wanna hate me, but I'm dope so now you're givin' up
Give me your money and I'll dibby it up
Make sure my homeys got some liquor they can drink in their cups

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I'm in the, wind, plus I'm cool like a Cali night
Might shoot through a few zips, but that's somethin' light
You know I charged through it
Soaring over the clouds, might fall through it
You can't take me out this sour state of mind I'm in
Plus Mac hit me so it's marathon time again
How far is the high life and the finer things
We worldwide they doing minor things
If you ain't flying high then you might as well hate
36 thousand feet in the air I'm feeling great
And I ain't never coming down
You need your pilot license with you whenever I come around
The dispensary I done ran through there
It-it's heroina and it's bamboo here
Courtesy of my homey Brock
Smoker's club baby, we got it all in stock

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Da$h]
Swim in fallopians of Ethiopian women
The wheels are spinning, moon is glistening
Few exquisite, Now if you have witnessed
The youth is twisted, off purple liquid made to cure the sickness
Feel like my vision took a pitch shift
Smoking that Samson got me lifted
I'm the one who gave your girl cousin them drugs
Your little brother's plug, Spit inside your mother's mug
Take a finest bottle, pour the liquor out for em'
Once above, the last shot is for the homie's locked
Liqour crop, hit the lot, double spinning till the Guinness drop
Pull off in fourth gear, put it in park
The whores, they see me, say the lord's here
My voice is hoarse for them, pause there
Like over here, we don't support fear
Road to the riches, and the course clear
I'm riding till the tires sparking an exhaust tear

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Actavis in cactus cooler
I bit the Apple on the Mac computer, you a loser
There ain't a subject I can't tackle, either now or sooner
Ain't got no shoulder pads, but collateral pass to her
Running back, running rap, I bet you wish she knew ya'
Black Lip Pastor, hallelujah (Soulo, Soulo)
Soulo in this ho, that mean this church up in this bitch
Gave her a sermon then I hit, god
I'm an entity into titties, a fat ass, some clean pussy, and some good weed
Knowledge and wisdom in abundance, infinite energy
And I'll be sure to write night and day, literally
Deadline snapback, Backwoods in my backpack
Xan with that lean nigga, shit you never seen nigga
Put that on my team nigga, 3 i's, you see me bruh
Careful, you know the game's T-D-E us

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
I heard they out there praying for the death of me
I been down to knock, it's my destiny
I been round the block, it's no testin' me
We been ran the north, it's no extra key
So whatchu' got on lock my nigga?
I tried to tell him, they ain't gon' get it
I been prolific, been on this shit
You can check mo millie, that was like 08's
You niggas ain't no factors, Just come around cause we ain't no actors
It's no scenes cut, just checks
Don't want 25, but I'll take my time
If a nigga come around, tryna' take what's mine
Tryna' take my life? good luck with that
We got guns for that, you not coming back
I got Fade in the bushes, lurkin' & lookin'
Bout' that life, don't get yours took quick
Just a story of some kids left stranded
Couple of the homies and a couple automatics
Come to the hood, get a good pack out
Tombstone RIP, with your hood whacked out
You know what he about, at Ramona Park till after dark
They drain they pool, we swam with sharks
We shooting fools off 7th street
You make the bed in which you sleep
I stay awake like visiting dead
With the hammer sitting indiscreet, in the streets

[Verse 4: RetcH]
Sold drugs in your granny building
In front' the children
A piece of shit, I'll be considered the most
Baby hand on the dinner plate
I start the meal with a toast
Three assorted cheeses, then garnish them both
Cut the slices even
Distribute them to my assemblage of these fucking heathens
A bunch of demons in these polo fleeces
I clutch the reapers into bay polices
I burn the Priest and vanish in the breezes
I talk to Jesus, reconsidered features
Rain dance on black sanded beaches
Pick from the tree that bare the fruit of peaches
Slaying these skeezers and it feel the Eden
These backwoods got me with the heavy breathing
Connecting Venus and the shit the cheapest
I hit the party with the Sherm perm
Ear rings look like strobe lights
I cop the gold fish platforms for the cold price
Hop out the V in all sequence, fish is Swedish
Sway Padorian, my shit the meanest, you need it
And I'm the founder of this shit
On the forty-sixth floor eating flounder with the shrimp
Got a awfully thick splore and I just pound her with the dick
Get the dope from out abroad, destroy the county with the shit
Piece of shit records, where dreams come true
You saying fuck me? Nah fuck you
[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well that's ridiculous
I'm a live forever, cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in its design
I spent some time just thinkin', where did that get me? high, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try and understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world, a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal is a loaded gun
And I'm a shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one, but I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

[Hook]
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch spliff
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America, motherfucker, welcome to America

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options
American born, impeccable form above and beyond, never the norm

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? bet I steal her
Shout out to my wigga Mac Miller
Comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
They don't know I come from the illest
City on a map, we don't know how to act
Realest young rappin go getters in America
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go
CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal, Veggies

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach 6
Rise to the top, the topics change the Glocks in the stock
Exchange that watch the price of life on the block
Drop insane, you can't stop this reign, Don't name drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains it's awkward strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Everybody love him and chicks offered top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters so up in the flow
No deal but flow so real keepin' in the scoops
Sun got shine, now he said he shady but he never dippin' though
Still facing L's you would think the niggas wins was low
What you think I'm in this for? Won't stop till the nigga who
Invented dope in the flow will behind bars droppin' prison soap
Begging for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources now he in the store
[Hook]
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'mma make a million
Bitch please, I'mma make a million
Cause, I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch Please, I'mma make a million
With ease, I'mma make a million

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]

A lotta' times I don't get the credit
Forgettin' about my ethical work
Let it be first said that I'm here to earn bread
I been dedicatin' ever since I turned 10
Got the type of style quickly gonna turn heads
I been workin', part time hustla'
Hit you with a dub, feedin' bubblas, (got this bruh)
On the road with a dollar and a dream
Cause anything is possible, believe bitch please
It ain't nothin' to spit, sparkin' up in the whip
Stayin' stuck up on my dreams like they rubber cement
No one ever sees a legend when he stuck on the bench
And my screw's so loose it'll fuck up your wrench
My head, can't contain all these dreams of mine
When I'm rich there's some shit I'm gonna' leave behind
For now, it's food for thought it'll feed your mind
But you can't get a piece of mind
Nah homie

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]

Now, I can either try and be a hero
Or I can grab a one with six zeros
What would I do with a million dollars?
First off, I'd start payin' bills to my father
Then pay for college, get TreeJay a camera
Grab a spot in LA, a crib in Atlanta
Cop a phantom just to ride in
Some celebrity friends to get high with
Couple four models that I find dine with
Cause the music that I make is timeless
The pressures on, don't choke, Heimlich
Maneuver, got my songs all through your computer
You wonderin' "is it buzz or just a rumor "
I'm Superman, y'all just Lex Luther
I'mma make a mil, that's for real no deal
Just the illest mothafucka in the bill, so chill

[Hook X2]
[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Umm... uh...
Ladies and gentleman
Yeah, whew, that drip
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Writing on writer's block, haven't slept in days
They wanna put me in the psycho watch
Everyone's afraid of what I do inside my studio
Worried I'mma lose control
They ruffling my feathers and they shuffling the Yu-Gi-Oh
Execution flow, at your neck like new cologne
Uno, dos, bitch I'm in your head like Freddy Krueger though
(My brain fried, always chasing the same high
I'm too fucked up to function, do nothing but waste time)
Woke up annihilated, lying on the pavement
Covered in items I regurgitated under a fire escape
And I know that it's Friday, cause every Friday they have a parade
In-front of city hall, hear them celebrate, they having a ball
My pupils dilated, highly dehydrated
I'm lost inside a giant matrix
Isolate myself from eyes I find contagious
Jump above the come down
I'm strung out and not in ops inside the dugout

[Hook]
Don't be scared just come with me
It feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of? Tell me what you're made of!
What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust!
Just a little Angel dust!
It's just a little angel dust!

[Verse 2]
I'm playing hot potato on a Winnebago
The chips are stale, they taste okay though when they dipped in queso
And what's an angel with a missing halo
She will drop out of school to take a trip to day glow
Found a twenty laying by the sewer rats
You know little Stewart hasn't been in any movies lately
He's spent his paychecks on cocaine and latex
His agent working hard to try to book him a commercial
What I do should not concern you
Do this till I turn blue
Not Eric Sermon, I'm more Merlin
Curses, turn 'em into bird food
Hurried to make the first move
I'm walking like Herschel
Now we at the end of verse two
Oh..

[Hook]

[Outro]
Don't fuck with the angel dust
Don't fuck with the angel dust
Please don't fuck with the angel dust
Oh! Please don't fuck with the angel dust!
