[Produced by Nineteen85]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here?
Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other
Whoop! Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude, what's his name? Not important
I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunechi and Barbie
You know
[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down
How many times I gotta?
Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
For the weekend, ohh

[Hook: Chris Brown]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time
You know how I feel about waiting in line
You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time
You'll only ditch him for a moment in time, take it in stride
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
How many times I gotta tell your ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell you I gotta chauffeur?
Think about it, think it over, everything is gon' be kosher
Call me when you getting closer
If you take a taxi, how much I owe ya?
Don't send me no naked pictures
If I can't get naked with ya
This dick deserves recognition
I don't mind paying that commission
Is you with the shit or nah?
If we ain't fucking then bitch, bon voyage
How many times? I said how many times?
Too many times and bitch I ain't got time

[Hook]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time
You know how I feel about waiting in line
You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time
You'll only ditch him for a moment in time, take it in stride
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay phone off the hook, yeah that bitch won't stop blinking
I'll pick up for you though on the second ring
You've been drinking and drinking, you're drinking for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leaving
Calling shots refereeing, no drama
Pussy so wet I'mma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodging the leeches, I'm signing agreements
I'm signing new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimming with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixing, this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favourite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

[Hook (partial)]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?

[Bridge]
Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down
How many times I gotta?
Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
For the weekend, ohh

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwing bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feeling generous, throwing my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm boning
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning
Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whipping the bricks

[Hook]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time
You know how I feel about waiting in line
You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time
You'll only ditch him for a moment in time, take it in stride
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?

[Verse 1]
Woo, this that shit they didn’t want me on
I’m ‘bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lam, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in the wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little girls
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, Holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'Cock-a-doodle'
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you, glory

[Verse 2]
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-boo, I got them spooked too
I drive a neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

[Verse 3]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely, I'm soarin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord

[Verse 4]
Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

[Verse 5]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tie is Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
P.O
One time for A$AP Yams
Let's go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
What's this I see? Niggas tryna act like G's
Got A$AP, got Fergy with me
It's a new day, no Black Eyed Peas
That's that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, that's that shit
(You ain't got no Flacko in your Serato?)
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
She knows, went to ATL for my C-Note
'Member, I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least (2 Chainz!!!)
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
I tell her, "throw on the dress with the pinstripes"
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight, that's right
Yeah, you that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, move that shit
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold, the rest is froze
Sex and hoes, best of both, girls and girls, perpetual
Sippin' slow, Texas throwed, comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded, I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded, shit, I'm surprised that we made it
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded

[Pre-Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up takin' longer
Can't impress with them diamonds though, them diamonds

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Talkin' about M's
Talkin' bout M's, nigga, M's
Make 'em talk about, make 'em talk about M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Make 'em talk about, talkin' bout M's, nigga
Talkin' bout M's

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
It's like lately all I ever seem to think about is M's, nigga
Talkin' 'bout M's
See the same thing all up in my bank account
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's
And my YouTube account say the same amount
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Money talk and dogs bark
I got a pocket full of stones in my stonewashed
Lambo, brand new Lambo
With tiger stripes on it call that bitch a golf cart
I'm outchea, I'm so outchea, I swear niggas have no idea
I swear niggas better wear riot gear
Cause I appear and pow loud and clear give 'em diarrhea, oh
I re-up tonight, I'mma be up tonight, cookin' a key up tonight
Niggas de-up I slide to the right, throw up a three up in time
Put a B up, let's fight, don't get beat up tonight
Feet up in my European, I ride with me heater inside
Kill you and your dog then go put on a shirt that say PETA for life
Like you sneeze you on tight, you got beef I got white
You got beef I got white, I got green, I got white
I got pink, I got pints, I got lean, I got ice
I got needles and pipes, I got clean, I got right
I got mean, I got nice, That's that Tina and Ike
I don't lean on her price, I don't cheat on her price
Try to cheat on the dice, you get beat on the spot
I get keys on the spot and I keep it on lock
And I keep it up safe, what you keep in your safe?
S'what I spent on my watch and I wave it like Ma$e
Bout to redo the face, get a see-through AK
I eat seafood and steak
But girl I'mma treat you like cake til I get a sweet tooth tooth ache
But wait let's talk about M's, not about them
I love my BM's, I love my YM ain't no more CM
Let's pluck out the stems, let's fuck like a nymph
She walk out, she limp, it's dark and we dim, yeah
We dem niggas, handcuffing him niggas back up and skim niggas
See that we strapped up we cap up your brim nigga
Fill my cup up to the rim nigga, Tunechi
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo! I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt's fake,worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key or maybe high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up
So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, aye)

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nic and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, street beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses, with army guns
So think about, your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is brazy my nigga, I been praising, my nigga
That money talk; I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the 'B' off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off
Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully, with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To please pour me a drink and celebrate with me

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy
I'm watchin Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors, nigga

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Money, money, money, money; money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me nigga, you not impotant
I'm focused
(2, 3, 4)
Bring in the horns
They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket, I'm short of a sandwich
I'm peanut butter, Boyce Watkin's a faggot
Please come and get me
Said I suck him at your neck
Like a hickey, boy I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin wit me
I got banned from New Zealand
Whitey called me a demon
And a terrorist, goddammit, I couldn't believin it
Ban a kid from a country; I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent -- your child idols a niggur!
I clearly don't give a fuck, so you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack
And fuck your Snapchat
Cherry Bomb the greatest fuckin album since the days of sound
And that shit gon pop just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin, we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves
Tyler the Creator sweatin Jesus juice
Put that fuckin cow on my level cause I'm raisin the stakes
Mom I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
When we ate its the steaks, now our section is great
Cause that's the level I'm at, my niggas pass 'em a plate
'Ye!

[Break: Kanye West]
Why oh why, why, why don't they like me?
Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my weddin
They say I'm crazy but that's the best thing goin for me
You can't Lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em
I believe you like a fat trainer takin a bite or somethin
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac -- he asked me "Are you still down?"
"Yeah my nigga; it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on"
I know they tell they white daughters don't bring home Jerome
I am the free nigga archetype
I am the light, and the beacon; you can ask the deacon
It's funny when you get extra money
Every joke you tell just be extra funny
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me
Oxford want a full blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, err, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck, hold up
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin at a Autobahn speed level
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin God
He said "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"

[Hook 2: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy
I'm tryna pop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin Freak and Geeks, got a trampoline in my room
Damn

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
(2, 3, 4)
Hold your fuckin horses
Niggas really fuckin thought that T lost it
Like I bet it at a auction been exhausted
I been workin while y'all cylinders smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin losers

[Lil Wayne]
Hold your fuckin ponies my homie
I'll whip your donkey by my lonely
I eat pussy like Shoney's
(Yeah)
It's Tunechi, homie, master of ceremonies
I knock 'em down, domino effect -- no pepperoni

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
This them Golf boys, like them Hot Boy$
For the nine nine and two thousand
But its the two thou'
And the one four, and the one five
Yo what up Wayne?
(What up Slime, nigga go hard)
Yeah, I'mma go hard like before came
Got too much drive, need like ten lanes
Life is a broad and she give brain
That's that road head (yeah) thats a dream car
Got a full tank of that same year I was born
That's that one nine nine one
'nother nigga like I, you won't find one
Cuz nigga I'm a god, a divine one
Tune

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
My trigger finger wise but my 9 dumb (Yeah)
Middle finger blind so its fuck A-N-Y-one
Fuck, skate, and die son; a hundred ways to die son
I'm starin at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks, wake my high up
Stakes are high; well done, and prime cut, eat up
I stick my rollie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda
Oh my goodness

[Verse 5: Tyler, the Creator]
Wayne them bitches ugly
These niggas colder than Tommy buddy
'Ye we hittin models like Tony Parker be hittin bottles
Bitch I'm goin harder than yellow cabbies stoppin for Lionel
(Black ass nigga)
They be duckin us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling
Boy lets get a scrimmage
And cut some niggas
I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German
You bring the nooses, and a couple trees
Where the money grow, and get bodies burning
Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
I need musics all over the street like Erick Sermon
Was
Fuck us
Maybe we should team up
Anti Golf boys, cuz I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot

Uhh...

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Son you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset to go on tour with Yeezus, well
I'm prayin for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin that we squash the beef like zucchini
I know --
It ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or lame, nor strange

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Nah faggot it's Golf Wang
[Intro: RiFF RAFF]
Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker
Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

[Drake]
Yeah, sound sound sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

[Hook: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 2: Drake]
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

[Hook: Drake + Lil Wayne]

[Outro: RiFF RAFF]
Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview
[Intro: Lil Wayne]

Go
Weezy Wee, bitch
S-Q-A-D Siddeven, holla at us, underground
Muhfucka, what you know bout Weezy huh? Holla at me dawg
I got it, it's right here, listen

[Verse 1]
Holla
I'm off the rocks squat the box dont rock the spot
The Sqad pop 'em I'ma fuck with the hottest
Diamonds droppin’ temperature, bitch I'm one of the finest
And to be honest, I got all these hoes stocked up like sinus, now who you fuckin'?
Ice shining colorful, like a sack of fruit or something
With no heart for bitches like ??? or something
I be the true to nothing thorough nigga, young, raw, and famous
Get money 'til I'm dead or 'til the day of my arraigning
Spittin' game through the platinum smile
You can see the fuck I be saying from half a mile
How I hop out of the colossal Tahoe filled up with models
Poppin' bottles with pussy poppers that gobble until they swallow
See I'm a pimp Playboy when it come to these hoes
Cause all I give is cum to these hoes and run from these hoes
I comfortably roll in the latest sleepy eye Mercedes
Heat up for the haters speed up for the ladies
Miss, so watch your back, and watch your mouth cat
Weezy shit, this our click
You 'bout that? I send my Sqad to where your house at
All of a sudden niggas gs, why the fuck is you trippin'?
I cock and shoot up one of your knees, why the fuck is you trippin'?
You listening? I'm official pimpin'
Be lowkey dippin', Range Ro' be twistin' on blades
I'm O. J. Simpson, pretty limpin'
Big fucking cannon, holding me back
With some shit from off the Discovery Channel on my back
My niggas drowned in smoke, underground, pound daily
My hoes like Nelly cause they go "Down, down baby"
I used to dog chickens, cluck 'em, fuck 'em, and duck 'em
But now I'm more mature, I fuck 'em, fuck 'em, and fuck 'em
Stuck inside of the game for damn near two decades
And I'ma make you see the insides like a x-ray
Aww fuck...
Huh? Drunk off Cris', mami on e
Weezy on e, mami cummin' on me
The diamond long links sparkle, tough in the light
You do a lil' something tonight, I buy you something with ice
And I ain't stunting a price, shawty I can afford it
I been had dough before I was recorded
Started to order you a Mercedes C 240
But I thought it would be more nice for you in a Ferrari, peep me

[Interlude]
It's whatever, holla
I ain't stopping, I ain't stopping
Check it, check it

[Verse 2]
Muhfucka bet' not fuck with this nigga
I'm itching, clutching the trigger
Muhfucka you can end up in a river, shit
I'm like a tornado I’m twisted off of shit
And my pistols off my hip but I give a shit about who I hit, fuck
I'm fucked up, I'll fuck you up for fucking up
Guns up like "What's up?", get your fucking guts cut
Tough luck bruh
Wonder why your bitch act stuck up?
Cause the slut got Weezy nuts stuck up in her fucking butt
Yung mack flip crack quicker than acrobats, get at me man
Look call me Wayne a. k. a. Big Daddy Kane
Nigga can't tell me nothing 'bout the game
Been in that deep shit, every year I'm M. V. P
It's just in me
Rims on the 'Lac like 22 inches
Play with me, I open up your back like 22 inches
Guerrilla pimpin'
And it really isn't wise for niggas to start poppin'
At any given time them niggas could start droppin', peep it
I'm off the strip muhfucka what you want?
This a freestyle coming from off the top out the trunk
Niggas be like Mase and go to Church
But I go to the trunk and then I go to your shirt
Holla at me, I'm the don bitch
Look we can get it on bitch
Gotta get another rap to flow on bitch...
Hold up, aight, aight, aight
Listen, playa, all I do is get bread, I'ma head to them cowards
And if they ever try me, I'll bring y'all the head of them cowards
This big spending, see the heads on them dollars
It's big pimpin', you see your bitch lipstick red on my boxers
Choppers pop at any time for any given reason
Leave 'em not breathing under cement for one disagreement
Freedom, we ride on them bitches, rollin' through sittin' high on them inches
My mission's to make sure Squad get expensive
And if anyone of you niggas better get defensive, your care will get intensive
Shot put humps on top of your head like Bart Simpson
I spark instant, now who want it? I'll light your set
Cause I'm all about money cocksucker, my life a check
I'm spectacular, I let the Tec tackle ya
I spit 16 after ya like I rap with ya
Put your chest in the back of ya
You would think a truck hit 'em, it's Weezy, don't fuck with him
Better lock me up or get me to the graveyard quick
Come and get me I spray, spark, spit, it's straight war bitch
Niggas is hoes, like they take long dick
I wave chrome shit at home, shit, make domes split
And may I say these fake niggas on some Ray Charles shit, blind to the fact
9 to ya cap, blat, put your mind in your lap
I ride with the gat for hard times, crimes, and rats
It’s rhymes of the crack, my Sqad, I'll die for that
I climb in the 'Lac, drunk off 190 ?
Don't try me cat, I take this shit beyond the rap
And this Ecstasy is why my eyes are black
Don't like baby moms but the X make her thighs look fat
But fuck the bullshit I grind for scratch, I scrape and scruff, bake and cut
You hatin' us? We tape you up
I spin ya corner make you duck from blazin’ bucks
Bandanas, braids, and cuts, I'm gangstad up
Muhfucka

[Interlude]
Oh, oh shit, oh shit
What they want?
I dont think they want Weezy. Do you think they want Weezy?
Check it, check it

[Verse 3]
Lil' nigga pass slow in a S 430, ya ho be like "That's so purty"
Fuck with me I'll show your chest no mercy
Sqad get so dirty, but still we do it clean
Bring action to these fake ass niggas like movie scenes
I pop so much X man I feel like Wolverine
Wake up in the morning, lips burning, can't move my spleen
See this lil' dude is mean, strapped up with tools and things
I'll get you different drugs mixed up like Smoothie King
The heavy platinum jewelry bling over the white tee
Watch your wifey, she's mostly likely to blow me pipey
I'm so exciting
Money, murder, steal, kill, rape
You should do like the Internet and start to Bill Gates
This whole world gon' end up with some bad fucking tumors, listening to these Cash Money rumors
I'll blast, bust, and shoot you, hit your block without the mask, fucking screw you
Treat you like a bitch, bitch look at me while I do you


[Interlude]
Ok, ok, homie, ok
Peep it out, Squiddad
Let me catch my breath, let the Danger track roll
And let me holla at you, now let me holla at you, check it out
S-Q-A-D


[Verse 4]
Don't fool with any niggas like me
We pull triggers like weeds
Swigger off the Piña Colada
Dreams of having cream and the power
You need a problem? I'm the meanest to start with
And got grams the size of the head of Gina on Martin
For any discomfort the Ninas is sparking
Be in your apartment, many assault men and semi-revolvers
Keep it clean, I'm a young Sqad street teen, only into green
If you intervene I'll leave your ass colder than Winter
And y'all just look like bitches
You get fucked then I nut up
And just like bitches, I leave you face down and butt up
Nigga what up? I just bought a record to say fuck Hip-Hop
I spit it for them niggas who grip Glocks
Dip cops, flip rocks, and when the bricks drop
We fix blocks, suddenly watch the income
Fuck with me, watch the outcome
Niggas don't wanna hear the Glock rung

[Interlude]
That's that real shit, that's-
K, ok, ok
Yea, holla at me, holla at me
This for all these niggas, you know me
Listen, let me tell you who the Sqiddad 7 is, bring it
It's Weezy Wee, Lil' Jay, Lil' Tez, Lil' Fee Fee, Lil' Yo, Lil' Sammie, T-Redd
Holla at us, holla at us, holla at us
Can't forget Bidd-Ugg-G, don't forget it
Check it, check it

[Verse 5]
Playboy I pimp huge
See the whip cruise on big shoes
Slide out the shit, cool, frostbit jewels like igloos
See Weezy gets loot, that be why your bitch choose
But dude, I ain't got nothing for her but some dick juice
I stick tools in the pocket of the S. Q. leather
They gon' have to rescue this fella if he stress my pleasure
I tells you once, I'm the don, you can trust my word
I say with a Herpes dick, nigga fuck the world
I be with niggas that could get me years
I be with hoes and bitches that favor Britney Spears
Listen here, you see the Sqad Minked up, Platinum S. Q. linked up
With a freak that drink nut ‘til my dick shrink up
You think it's soft? Let the thing bust 'til I'm seeing pink guts
Niggas watch them pigs come, they trying to sink us
You know who I be, Weezy Wee muhfucka
I ain't gon' stop the flow until the end
K we got a new game, I'm running, punting, I ain't passing the ball
You other niggas just be crashing the boards
With a team full of great players, but I'm a veteran, all-star
And let's be real man, I'm better than all y'all
I'm the truth, I'm the reason, I'm the meaning, I'm the shit
I'm the alleged convict in any Sqad incident
Last name Carter like Vince and shit
But I don't slam balls and goals, my life's money, cars, and hoes
Cadillac white walls and 'Bauds, pimpin' partna
Plus I can get more work out than a fitness doctor
Let's get this partna, I'm the young don these niggas honor
And those of you who ain't cheap can't buy a vowel
It's cause the child's mom will eat me up like Jeffery Dahmer
Libel to find my condom inside of dry vagina
I'm kinda calm, drama goes with my persona
A minor with intentions to harm ya, holla

[Interlude]
Ok, ok
Switch it up right here, switch it up, switch it up
Listen, listen, take this money, make this money, get this money
Puff holla at me

[Verse 6]
Homeboy it's Sqad shit
It's gon' be Sqad shit, swallow it
He who disrespect, hollows follow him
Flash the pistol, watch 'em stop and pose like they modeling
Blast 'em, watch em stop, drop, and roll like they firemen
Seriously man, I got enough money to buy ya men
Turn 'em against you and make 'em kill ya mom and them, don't fuck with me
Buck 50 on the dash of the box but that's only approximately cause it really do like two ?, blue fire
Wrist looking like blue fire
Piña Colada got me spiked like barb wire, Weezy Wee, Sqad rider
Holla at me, you know you know me
Got out the streets and start hustlin', there's still some fiends who owe me
Blow me some dro, nah I ain't smoking I stopped that
My niggas still get puffed out, I catch the contact
I'm kinda fucked up, fuck with me and I ain't gonna leave you kinda fucked up
I leave you fucked up, believe this stuff bruh, it's Sqad shit, bitch

[Interlude]
Oh shit, I ain't finished
Oh shit, I ain't finished
I ain't finished Duke
Check it, listen

[Verse 7]
I come up from a shit deep town, where you hear sounds like "Click", "Squeak", "Pow"
Get down or you dying, niggas tote iron
Got that coke flying like birds, not the ones with feathers, I'm talkin' weight like birds
And you might get served if it’s proper enough
Or find your nerves on the curb if you a cop or something
A baller blocker or something, I'll send your noggin a hundred
Have the whole block sprinting, dashing, jogging, and running
Type of life I live, Gotti would love it
Sqad property buddy, some young niggas with a mafia budget
Can't nobody put nobody above it
And if they do, they find they body with your body above it
Fuck it, let's take it public, nah leave it the gutter
Fuck it, let's go and dump 'em, nah leave 'em in the gutter
Hustler, keep it thuggin', why the fuck you niggas buggin'?
The hot 9 slug it, dug inside of your fucking jucket (jacket)
Call me Weezy you bitch

[Interlude]
Ok, ok
The d. j. just informed me that I got 20 more minutes to rap
How the fuck I'ma do that?
Holla at me, if you feel me holla at me

You know me, let's go

[Verse 8]
Listen, I keep the pistol hidden in the big pockets, hear shit cockin'
Better get flocking or get gotten
Dawg I speak with the gun, nigga's holla in the street like "What's up?"
I tell 'em "Chika buck buck chika, get the fuck"
The droughts come bring the pots out, let's do what we do
You fuck with me I send more shots out than D. J. Clue
Now who seeing me? Not a person
Got a personal grudge with these commercial thugs
No studio with me, true
I shine hard and I be flossin' very sweet
But I'm like Iverson dawg, I be ballin' but very street
Keep my name out your yapper, or you gon' have to try to keep my flame out your cappa
I ride around with like two bodies framed on the clapper
The tool cocked for he, do pop for beef, move out for chiefs
Supply two blocks a piece two blocks a piece
My crew watch for cheese and I do stock my cheese

[Interlude]
Dude, dude, who you know fucking with me man?
Check it, check it


[Verse 9]
What up world? This here your people Weezy, holla at the don
Real nigga dude, I promise that to God
When I swallow half the Dom I go loco, stressed, hoping I'm not cursed
Walk around with TECs poking out my shirt
Niggas show off for them hoes, try play hard, with they chest poking out they shirt
Try me and I send shots, leave they chest poking out they shirt
Yes, expect the worse when you fuck with the Squad right
Pull you out your car at a stoplight
Catch you in the waist, make you my height
This shit's not nice, I'll have you chopped twice for a hot price
Or I can take off my ice and hit your block and stop life
Can you see that?
Properly under my seat is where the heat at
Directly in your head is where the bullets meet at
I be that cat who make sure my Sqad ball gracious, 'til The Lord take us
We gon' all get paper, just stay faithful
Cross the gate bitch and we rape you
Ain't nothing sugar nigga we all salt
Fuck y'all and that's y'all fault

[Interlude]
Holla at us
Man this Sqad shit is real, real biddig
Ooo shit

Homie I speak for the streets, scream for the ghetto, and holla for my folk
Die for my Sqad, kill for my dough
My attitude is fuck bitches, fuck haters, fuck cops
My real father is a ho, my attitude is fuck pops
I'm living it up in a nice home, riding in trucks, tough drops
And I'm a young nigga, I don't even know how to do the bus stop
But I got my money right
When I hit the club, make it a sunny night
See the fake flossers, bum ballers, is a funny sight
Watching dudes front for these hoes in they Chevy right?
Pull up next to 'em in a 500 bumpin' Betty Wright
Keep my shit spaghetti tight
Playboy put the hood on that
We buy sports cars and put the fuckin' hood on that
My bank got too hot to sit on so I stood on that
Any place, you be careful cause I could own that
Moët and E, I'm good on that
Your bitch looking at me, I should bone that
Y'all niggas know where the fucking don at, holla

[Interlude]
Holla at me, Weezy Wee, holla at me, Weezy Wee

Flip pies, I used to do that shit in like '95
But I'ma switch it up to '99, 2000, 2001
I ride cars that's 2000 and fun
You know the motherfucking whip be cruising on shit, 22's
And hoes be losing they mind, boy

[Interlude]
It's about to come, it's about to come
What y'all want? What y'all want?
Check it, check it
Fee Fee Favorite

[Verse 12]
Flippin' in a whippa
Peel the top back like a zipper
Skippin' on them chrome dip slippers
Rippin' on the lips of a stripper
If that's your bitch mister don't kiss her
If so you might as well kiss a pistol
Cause all I do is shoot off in her whistler
She finna get my name on her shitter
And I ain't even hit her
My nigga Fat did her, and slid her to the rest of the Squidda
Forget her, another bitch just paged in
Weezy blazing, come through in something amazing
I ball so good I need a sports agent
Look at me and squint your eyes like Asains, what's wrong?
My jewelry's like a white boy, always stoned
I got a big home but I'm always gone
That's why your bath towels is always gone
Hoes I meet nowadays panties always gone
And baby after I fuck I'm always gone

[Interlude]
I mean I got a wife at home, you know me, holla, ha, holla
Bitch I can't love you
Holla, hahaha
Listen

[Verse 13]
Homie I go hard, push a whip with no hair on its head
So all I'm feeling is air on my head
With some ho that you might know, she sucking all the air out my head
Meet you close to knock you square out your head
Sip the Cris’ to clear out my head and try to get my loot up
In Cuba with a translator ?? coke newer
Plus the prices is cooler
I Come back through the hood with that dirty
And tell 'em I'm like Tiger Woods, all I got is birdies
Got bitches in they 30's calling Weezy poppa
But Weezy not daddy bitch, cause Weezy in and out ya
Weezy never spouse ya, Weezy give shit about ya
And Weezy don't Master Suite, Weezy living room couch ya
How about you be a good bitch, and take these pies I just cooked up
And tape 'em to the pelvis, arm or your thighs
I gets high 'til I can't focus
But a main focus to remain focused, they ain't focused, muhfucka

[Interlude]
Holla, shit, holla, oh shit, oh shit
Boy, boy, boy
Ok

[Verse 14]
I spit it for them niggas who run the corner, palm the revolver with honor
Any beefs involving homie, your momma
Homie we swarm out the Eddie Bauer, thoughts to devour
Spark and shower, we get more stupid than Austin Powers
Smell the aroma of marijuana, Coronas when upon us
We do just what the neighborhood have shown us
We murder opponents and don't think about it, forget about it
Niggas won't do shit about it
Wave the pistol, get the bitch up out 'em
I'm off the ????, chicks on my dick, proper than Cindy Crawford
Any problems I pop the chopper and knock the appendix out him
Hit the block with bricks of powder
What you know 'bout doing that?
And splitting a key with flour, making it two in fact
Dawg I'm all street, if you want Hip-Hop, here's what I give you instead
I'll make you hip out when them fuckin' bullets dig in your leg
Positive niggas talking spooky, y'all ain't scaring nobody
Y'all love Mos Def, I love fucking John Gotti, holla

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aight
Listen

[Verse 15]
I wish that there was no taxes, no cases, no police, and no racists
No rapists, wish they had a 700 Mercedes
Wish my Sqad live happy
I wish my kids grow stronger than me
I wish my momma live longer than me
I wish the cops stay off the corner this week
I wish the gutta, ghetto neighborhood hunger would cease
I wish them niggas who ain't got shit would stop hating on niggas who got shit
And you know I wish for Pun, Biggie, and Pac shit
I wish that I could get high but when I'm high I wish I wouldn't get high
Sometimes I wish I wasn't alive
I wish for Heaven gates to enter
Wish for Lakers' tickets at the Staples Center
My seats, floor me
Wish Chris Childs wouldn't of hit Kobe
When I see Lauren, I wish I knew why my heart burns
Wish 22 inch rims wouldn't rub on sharp turns
I wish these hoes stop lying
I wish these niggas stop lying
Wish dope heads stop using, as if they not dying


[Interlude]
Fuck it. That's just some shit I wish for, fuck it

Fuck, I wish I ain't have a jail record
Wish every bitch gave head
I wish I could've saved Dad
I wish I make money 'til I'm a dead man
I wish my chain wasn't heavy around my neck
Wish hoes wouldn't suck dick and try to kiss down my neck
Wish I ain't have to get locked up for slapping her to the ground for that
Bitch I wish you wouldn't wanna be down for that
I wish there wasn’t no droughts
I wish there wasn’t no fucking coke ??

Holla at me, holla at me, holla at me

Boy, boy, check it

[Verse 18]
Nigga we peel guns, and homie we fear none

Guzzled Belvedere ever since we heard Jay
Be dying the worst way
Who want it? You bitch you
Sqad is the official shit
Pistols spit behind little shit

She never cook pork but only cook coke
Die for respect and hope, look beyond I’m a celebrity
Hold moms for ransom, head sold separately

Trapped in the jungle, can’t escape dawg
But I bet you be the last man standing like a 8-ball
And I ain’t worrying ‘bout balin’ no more, I’m past that stage

My Sqad ride, I bet we be up on the street to heat somethin’
We peace nothing cousin, this here is war and we battle
Big guns with deep barrels, bullets leap and leap at you nigga
Bricks go for 10 gs on street value
Patience is fragile, niggas be glad to come smash you
The S Class is casual for the summer

[Interlude]
Holla at me dawg, holla at me, holla at me

‘Cause this shit that I palm in my arm is going blucka
And I’m young but a wise nigga
But in the meanwhile I’m wild going at it
Fuck it, tryna join my daddy
Automatic weapons, pow
You can call the paramedics now
And if any test the child he stepping on deadly grounds
I’m repping Hollygrove to my fucking grave woa’
And chase dough, slave hoes, and keep my head low
We can’t let the feds know nothing
We keep it quiet as kept
If someone frontin’ you find him dest

[Interlude]
I’m sorry
What the fuck is “find him dest”?
I meant, “If someone frontin’ you find his death”
Death
7, S. Q
Holla at us, check it

[Verse 22]
Pistols burning
Pop the barrel, turning
It got the faggots squirming
We closing any open shop we ain’t concerned in
Coke the size of Sherman Klump we flipped and doubled
And dropped the whip on dubs and dipped in Bubble
Get a bad bitch to hustle and move product
And split them niggas quick as fuck if them dudes try her
Not behind the ho, but only behind the dough
And behind the dough I kill whoever stand behind the door
You ain’t tryna go that route with the Sqad, it’s rough, I promise
We kidnap your mommas and sit our johnsons on her tonsils
We reside inside the S. Q. bombers
And we leave families emotional like Carl Thomas
So stay from ‘round us
And to be honest, ain’t nothing for me to do away with you
I be the same nigga that blow a Tre with you
Then let a K hit you
Fuck you nigga, I ain’t got no love for none of y’all
Make you my underdog, put you under dawg

[Interlude]
Under dawg, holla
This shit we doing is under dawg
Man, listen

[Verse 23]
Bitch I’m explosive
All this niggas know this
Weezy, I’m your woadie

You know how I do it bitch, I do it for me
I do it for the streets, I do it for my peeps
I do it for Sqad
I do it ‘cause I ride
I do it ‘til I die
I never gets high
I’m always on my toes
I never fuck bitches, I never fuck hoes
But I only gets my dick sucked
That’s because I got a real bitch that’s on my siddide
Down with the Squiddad

[Interlude]
Oh, oh that my nigga Six Shot
Yeah, bout to run it
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Check it, check it
Listen

[Verse 24]
I do just what I motherfuckin’ want
I never live with regrets
I speak from the shit that bleed on the left side of my chest
Take heed to the shit that gleam on the left side of my waist
Or take three to the left side of your face
A multiplatinum artist still riding with TECs and 3-8s
A hustler, you can see the crack residue left on them plates
They fucking with me, I’m predicting death on them snakes
I ride in a frenzy
Ride in a Benzy
Fuck it, tryna fire my enemies
Fire a sack, recline back, and feel me
I spit that filthy shit
That gutta, guilty until proven guilty shit, get back at me
Let’s just spit rapidly at chests, you better fucking halt
Or the Glocks with the thunderbolts make you do somersaults

[Interlude]
Holla at me mothafucke, holla at me
Holla at me muhfucka, holla at me
Holla at me muhfucka, holla at me

[Verse 25]
This is for the Sqad I sip Moët with
This is for the Sqad that I pop X with
This is for the Sqad I be in the house of blues with
This is for my Sqad that I usually fools with
This is for Lil’ Jay, this is for Lil’ Yo
This is for Lil’ T-Redd, this is for Fee-Fee though
This is for my nigga Sam, all call him Supa
This is for my nigga Tez, stupid ass nigga

[Interlude]
Haha holla, holla
I was feeling that one, that was real nice
Was real nice
Ok, ok
Listen

[Verse 26]
We carry automatic machine objects in jean pockets
And clocks with beams cocked and fuck with me - seeing doctors
The Sqad be in monster trucks with screens and bobbers
Passing green and brown chocolate like John Stocktan
Who stopping these lil’ niggas? Nobody, it’s impossible
Find me in a Benz – aqua blue
Rims colossal dude
And right under the seat’s a Glock or two
Don’t make me pop at you
And got two Hawaiian tropical bitches that will swallow you
People ask me “Weezy, why you do it so big?”
I pop my collar, drop the roof off the 6, then shoot up the bridge
Listen, I’ve had loot since a kid
I ain’t just start having dough
As a matter of fact, I started having dough
I’ma be fancy, send some warnings at folks
Be very cautious or them Glock 4s get pointed at throats
I bet he choke

[Interlude]
What you don’t know?
It’s Weezy the Squiddon squiddy
Get with it

Holla at me listen

[Verse 27]
Nigga fuck with me, get washed away
Glocks and revolvers spray
Cats get they corners blazed
Blast with enormous Ks
Understand Weezy be the don an ain’t no fading him
Play with him, shots turn him dome into a stadium
Beef with me and my gun immediately bust repeatedly
Unleash this pop one in your bitch Victoria Secre-
‘Atures creepin’ without the lights on
Doo rag, G Nikes on
Hope the choir sing your ass a nice song
Niggas ain’t tryna collide with the Squiddad
It is not wise
I’m robbing your block with Glock 9s
Pull out, cock, pop moms
Drop bombs
You niggas ?????????
Sqad bitch, ain’t no replacing me
Come to take shit
We be on some money make shit
Simply basic, you hate I put more designs in your head than Anthony Mason
Have you parents in the front emergency room pacing
Crying an waiting for the doctor to come out and say
“Miss your motherfuckin’ son didn’t make it”, holla
*Moans* all y’all better know no disrespecting Weez’
Come to your fucking street and kill families
Holla at this muhfuckin’ nigga
You know me
And ask your bitch, she blow me
You know I’m in love with Kobe
And Hovi

[Interlude]
Ok, ok
What they want?
Check it, check it

[Verse 28]
Nigga it’s pistol play regardless of the matter
I’m a heartless lil’ bastard
Since Rabbit died my life’s been darkened and shattered
Fuck all of you faggots
Regulator, warrior, bandit, gun busta
Spit the cannon make you fall to the canvas muhfucka
It’s Lil’ Weezy in the flesh nigga, Hollygrove candidate
Running with The Sqad scavengers, we on some family shit
Niggas ain’t understanding it but they will in a minute
Or my K peel in a minute, make your head drill to your tennis
I’ma stay trill for the spinach
Tremendous when I’m on that green shit
Menace when I’m on that green shit for that green shit
I’ma a soldier, some Army, Navy, Marine shit
My appearance is ? shit, but I got Korean chips
Fuck with me I blast you idiots
Let the Mac and Semis spit like Pakistinians muhfucka

[Interlude]
Muhfucka, ok, it’s real time

"Nigga I crash parties crash-"
Oh I ain’t know that was next

I really didn’t know that was next
Sorry. I’ma freestyle to it

[Verse 29]
Ok ain’t no nigga like this nigga Weezy
Ain’t no click like the Sqiddy Sqeezy
You know how we do it, we dos it easy but we gets loot
And if a muhfucka fuck with us we shoot
We do the things, we do it big, we ride big
And if a muhfucka fuck with us he die quick
I make your momma and your child spit up blood

[Verse 30]
I’m a outlaw

[Verse 32]
Nigga I crash parties, crash shorties, crash Bacardis, crash Ferraris
Crash authorities, crash sororities, crash quarter kis
Infected with a raw disease, call it H. I. V
That stands for Hoes, Incoming Violence
That’s what I die with
I pop shit, don’t fuck with Sqad shit
We on some mob shit
Some lil’ niggas who seem harmless, but nah bitch
Glocks spit behind anything
Bitch lick anything
‘Cause I got plenty change like Bill Gates’ piggy bank
Got a young pretty thing sitting beside me in the whip
With Limo tints to hide me in the whip
Told mami you can keep your clothes on, I wan’ see where your head at
In other words I don’t wanna fuck, I wan’ see where your head at
You can catch me laid back in the cut with ounces and bundles
Bouncing from hustles, doubt me I’ll fuck you, fuck it
Lounging in bubble
Rocky watch resemble mountains or something
Fronting get your body found behind some mountains or sum’n
Aye, when you fuckin’ with me you fuckin’ with cheese
You fuckin’ with Streets, you fuckin’ with heat
You fuckin’ with Sqad, you fuckin’ for free
You touching your knees
And if you hate, you’ll be lucky to breathe
Now how you like lookin’?
When the double gauge is ???? you get your fuckin’ life token
Despite the business, fuck rap
Picture block on a motorcycle wheeliing
But the Glock ain’t right for kidneys
I don’t like you bitches, I hate you hoes
Date you hoes, bust nuts in your facials hoes
Then replace you hoes, that’s the type of shit that makes you hoes
All the women in this nation hoes
Hot since my creation woa’
Who the fuck want him?
Bitch niggas with no nuts on ‘em
I got pistols with blood on ‘em
Whips with dubs on ‘em
Niggas with chips and drugs on ‘em
Got bitches with hips and tits on ‘em
Lips with dicks on ‘em
Chicks with bricks on ‘em
Chicks with chicks on ‘em

[Interlude]
Holla at me, I’m still not done
Holla at me, check it, I’m still not done
Nigga holla at me, holla at me
Listen, listen, listen

[Verse 33]
Don’t get it twisted ‘cause I’m younger than most
I come with the toast
Get it hot like summer was close
I’m hanging out the Hummer with Sos’
Exploding missile Glock ringing at the front of your door like Jehovah Witness’
Sober? Forget it
This C. M. B. thing, I’m over committed
The youngest soldier come with it
Cock back, guns put holes in your fitted
Nigga I told you to quit it
I load it with 50
I blow ‘til it’s empty
The dro and Henny got me lokin’ and limpin’
Ropin’ up when I drink ‘til I’m over the limit
Hoppin’ out the Rover with Semis
Wildin’ out, go straight to your momma’s house
With a rag on my face with more 9s than dialing out
Now who hating?
Niggas cheapskating, underestimating
The heat take him, put him under extra pavement
Some one week in Jamaica, come back with a accent like -

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Whoo, whoo, fuck it
That’s 10000 bars for y’all bitches
Holla at me
Weezy Wee, Raj Smoove

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
This is for the hood, this is for the ghetto
This is for the niggas getting that money
That cash money, that 100 million dollar money
We got money
We the best

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Ridin' big, gettin' mine
Two microwaves flip a brick at a time
Bandanna on the handle ready for the whip
When I wear the whitest soft watch it disappear
I disappear in the middle of the night
When I reappear, bet the boss look so bright
For life, dough boy
More strikes, oh boy
We ridin' low, gettin' high
80 round drum let ya know the time
When you see the Maybach, niggas know it's mine
Ridin' on the 2-4's I'm ahead of my time
Watch runnin' from kind, another one on my mind
Phone bill 4 grand get your ho on my line
In the hood, ho niggas act funny
Only real niggas really get to touch cash money

[Hook: Dre]
I spent 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Everyday a new whip homie, So you know I gets my shine on
Flip after we flip homie, So you know I gets my grind on

Move them things, Get them things, Switch that lane
Get that chain, Flip them thangs, Get yo money hommie do your thing
See I got em like 10 times, spend money got em like 10 times
Flip that got em like 10 times, Got money like 10 more times nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I'm from the ghetto, the bottom, the hood, the slums
There's money out here, we just trying to get some
Cool like Dre nigga, A like K
When ya talk about me you better watch what ya say
Don't ever keep them things where ya lay
Cuz them pussy ass niggas show the folks where ya stay
Ya thought he was ya dog, said he was a G
Sounds like another co-defendant to me
Niggas move sloppy and I really don't like it
Fuck around and get everybody indicted
Saw this shit coming, you woulda thought I was a psychic
Fuck around go dead broke trying to fight it

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I, I, I all night it, I every day it
And when it comes to my dues, I over payed it
Rated hood bitch, Bitch I'm hood bitch
I ain't a asshole, but I'm on some hood shit
I wish I would switch, I don't know how
Blood gang swarm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile
Like my grill didn't, Cost me a 100 thou

I smell a lot of 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto

And since I'm the president, she tried to catch it on her blouse
I tell her, whoa, easy, baby

Wait, shit gets way more crazier
We flip the bitch like she was in the gymnasium

[Verse 2]
Bitch I spit the hundred winters on my snow cone
Lil' nigga walkin' like he get his bowl on
Boss man, pimp stro, pimp stro

See, baby, I'm so high
All I need you to do is just shut up and ride

[Verse 3]
Me an' Mac is just two niggas from the same hood
Fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
I'm just the young lion and he the young bull
Not Sammy the Bull, that pistol on my hip, now I gotta hand in the pool
I had a Lammy in school
I think it was diablo red
I'm t-i-red, I'm T.I red
You D.I-ed because of what you said
Chyee, I'm sharp as an image
And I keep it bumpin' like a mothafuckin' blemish
Two twins drink me up like Guinness
When I'm finished, I say, "Billion"
When I'm finished they say, "Weezy, you killed it"
Hop on your shit and say, "Weezy, you healed it"
So fly I got wings tattooed on me
A gun glued on me, but I pop ya in ya stomach
Now I got yesterday's food on me

And I smell like a weed plant
Young Money mothafucka, where that cheese at?
[Hook]

Money long and we comin’

[Hook x2]

[Lil Wayne]
I ain’t have to touch a piece of work since ‘94
I lost my daddy in ‘96 and started makin’ moves
In ‘98 (i got a brand new Lexus coupe)
(now them laws won’t leave me alone)
They pull me over, lock me up, I bail out on my own
I call my poppa on the phone, tell him cook up a zone

I move through the club with the tool on my hip
Watch how you dap me off, the strap might go off, POW
And I can take it back for y'all
Like the old '77 Cadillac with walls
I be peepin' in the back, Maybach for y'all
Weezy dope like crack dissolve
Ain't no cases round here gettin' cracked or solved
Cause ain't no boys around here 'bout to crack at all
Baby girl, what's really good? I'm trynna crack that off
Leave your man where he at, and ain't a Mac get off
Man, I got the dreads in the rubberband swingin' in the air
Got this thing in my other hand, ain't bangin' in the air, naw
And I ain't singin' this for help
I mean what I say, and say what I felt
I lean cause the K heavy weight on my left
Yao Ming couldn't block these shots himself
Gudda
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ok, Gucci backpack, fresh black Adidas
I'm rollin' on a pill, rollin' up some reefers
Declining all the Keishas, replying to the Kims
Still knockin' boots like hammers on tims
I'm a mothafucker baby, Weezy F. Baby

And I'mma come through in something so cherry
And I'm sittin' on Pirellis, bumpin' Makaveli
Showed your girlfriend my house she think I live in Italy
Just bought a jet I'm 'bout to take that bitch to L.A
Bitch I never met I'm 'bout to meet that bitch in L.A
Ooh, I'm feeling myself
I'm so fly shawty think I really fly stealth
I'm so paid shawty I could really buy stealths
And I'm feeling my belt, and I'm feeling my sneaks
Cause I don't see them on anybody
Got the semi by me for anybody
Yeah I'm from uptown, yeah I'm from uptown
Yeah, I'm from uptown, Eastside, I'm lighting up two blunts at one time
And I thank God I can say fuck one time
I'm sipping on two cups at one time
And I thank God I can say fuck one time
Fuck one time, fuck one time, fuck one time, thank God

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Louis V. bag, all black hammer
Louis V. shoes with the Louis bandanna
On the Louis phone case with the sidekick case
Might put L.V. on the side of my bitch face
Man I'm a dog, I go so hard
Man I'm a dog, 'bout to come in your yard
'Bout to, 'bout to cum in your lady
Weezy F., Weezy F., Weezy F
Baby, hahaha

And Young Mulah, baby
Can't forget that
How would you do that?
I beat that track 'til that bitch blue 'n black
It's Weezy F. the monster, even F your mama
Even X your mama, leave you next to mama
You are so pussy gonorrhea's your aroma
Blind gynecologist could see that your vagina
Who? Me? Me? Turn beef to balanya
And your girl ride me like a Honda
Better yet she ride me like Travis Pastrana
Fuck the X Games, it's ecstacy games
Show me a mirror cause I'm so glad to meet Wayne
And I'm feeling myself
So fly shawty think I really fly stealths
But I'm so paid shawty I could really buy stealths
But I'm feeling my belt, I'm feeling my sneaks cause
I ain't never seen them on anybody
Got the semi by me for anybody
Yeah I'm from uptown, yeah I'm from uptown
Eastside!
[Intro]
Yessir! They can't stop me, even if they stopped me
I'm on it, ooh, I'm on it
I'm so on it, and however you want it
You can get it tonight ho, and all night ho
I get the beat from (Maestro), fuckin' right ho

[Verse]
I might go crazy on these niggas, I don't give a motherfuck
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up
What! What! I don't give a motherfuck
Getcha baby kidnapped and ya baby-mother fucked
It's tha Carter 3, bitch, better put your supper up
Hollygrove I throw it up like I'm trying to lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level? you can't get on my level
You would need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you bout to suck my dick, bitch!
Swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
2 more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor I could have died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches like Magic
Abracadabra I'm up like Viagra
I just do this shit for my clique like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'mma keep it on my channel
Watch me, bitch, watch me
Bitch watch me! But they cannot see me
Like Hitler, it's the New Orleans Nightmare
Money so old it's growing white hair
Young Money, baby, yeah we right here
I'mma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
And mama, don't cry, your son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put her in the hills
Yeah, when I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14 I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I say
I told my girl "when you fuck me, better fuck me good
Cause if another girl could, she gonna fuck me good"
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it
Yeah, I got game like Stuart Scott
Fresh out the ESPN shop
And when SportsCenter poppin' everything stoppin'
But you can't fool me, I know what you watching
Me! You watch me, you watch me, cause I be
Weezy, must see, T.V, C3
Nigga that's me and I'm me, I'm me times 3
So retreat or suffer defeat
I'm back 3-peat, C3
[Verse 1: Curren$y]
442, 442
I'm burnin' gas like a 442
I'm rollin' past that BMW
That new shit pretty, these old-schools move
I ride city-to-city, my motor fine-tuned
I've got your girl with me, she so unfollowed you
I'm a paper on paper mission, caper to count the loot
We super fly fishin' with Yachts and Gucci shoes
Started with no pot to piss in, now I smoke pot and kick it
Beautiful stranger bitches trying to get more familiar
New Orleans know I feel 'em, wherever I go, I bring 'em
Real niggas in the building, smoked out any whip I've driven
Only focus is gettin' in the door, so we ripped it
Up off the fuckin' hinges like: "Where's the dope? We know it's in here"
Hoes already told us, give it here
Fuck them, we ball, so high, on this motherfuckin' jet
Check my rhymes, I ain’t told a lie yet, nigga

[Hook: Curren$y]
442, 442
I'm burnin' gas like a 442
We comin' through, convertibles and coupes
My OG told me, "Smash anything in front you"
442, 442
I'm burnin' gas like a 442
Convertibles and coupes
If it's 'bout that cash, there's no tellin' what we'll do

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Money to the ceiling
Pimpin' is a gift I opened way too early
Like my hoes hair curly, redbone curvy
Make 'em run from this dick Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Alright, lipstick on my boxers, these pills fuck up my posture
Quick frankly I'm Sinatra, I'm shark and you tilapia
I've got shooters on payroll, but I grab my binoculars
I'm lookin' for my reason to tell my shooters I don't need 'em
Alright, revenge taste better than pussy
Man, ain't got no purple, gotta get it from Whoopi
I'mma put it in your mouth, I don't know how else to put it
I bet they ain't fuckin' with me, where's the bookie
Alright, I'm a motherfucker, quote-un-quote
She ride this dick like it came off the showroom floor
Lil' Tunechi aka No Baking Soda, I'm high, Lamar Odom
I'm smokin' like a motor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Birdman]
We poppin' off
We get to stuntin', you know it's bang or ball
Rollin' off, slidin' free shopping spree we clear them streets
Third wall, we bend them niggas
Reppin' mines to the end, my nigga
High life, we can't fake [?] so we'll show them niggas
Take they bitches, bring 'em home
Stunna holla, bang and ball
Layin' low in my old school
Top back for my old cool
Gave them niggas fresh game stay fly in that Bentley Coupe
Told my bitch how to get this money
Showed a bitch how to get this money
Pimpin' hoes, we pimp this game
Got the money, we kept on runnin'
Hard top and that new school
Drop top and that new school
Roof wide open nigga out the pound with them big tools
What up five? We in this jungle
What up five? We keep it bumpin'
What up five? We shine and hustle
What up five? Bugh

[Hook]
[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Question; What y'all know about swangers on slab
30's on a Hummer with the butterfly doors
Lucky Charm teeth, lack on them D's
Chevy sitting high, iced out everythang
Stacks on deck, no bank
What y'all know about five of the hottest young niggas in the game
Bow Wow, Short Dawg, Scrappy
The boy Lil' Wayne, the homie Pimp C
We got a little story to tell y'all bout where we come from

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I come from where a Chevy with a trunk full of bump is all that's wanted
And the year don't matter long as you throw some, throw some Ds on it
Mouth cost more than your house, house on ten acres
And the inside so fly niggas call me Jim Baker
From Ohio to Texas, we're so infectious
A-T-L to S-T-L it's gon' be hard to catch us
I'm talking bout bills sipping on bar
Drinking crunk, living like there's no tomorrow
See out-of-towners can't understand, cause I cut all my words short
Popping Texas, mandatory, Saturday at the mall
Hoods ain't hoods, they called wars and zones
Guns cart choppers and when it's on, it's on
See the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, hear me out
Said the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, now answer me this

[Hook x4: Pimp C]
Unh, now what y'all know about the country boys
Coming down with candy toys, playing hard talking noise

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
The boy country like overalls you know that dawg
Catch me in the slab, the same color as Bubu's rust
Cruising up the Ave and I'm probably gon give yo' ho a call
Cuz I ball hard and I'm stuntin' like there's no tomorrow
So yesterday, I swear I spent about fifty G's
On a wristwatch that shine brighter that a Christmas tree
If you was getting cheese, you would probably spend it, too
So don't hate me cause I blow paper like the wind do
And hop out clean, so watch out, Queen
I'm the biggest balla in Houston homie, not Yao Ming
I'm getting money maine, so my pockets hella chubby
And I be sipping drank that's purple like a Teletubby
So when it comes to the women dog, I can tell they love me
They put they panties in a envelope an mail 'em to me
Now how's that for some fanmail
But me an Bow got a question, know the answer, raise your hand, yea

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Lil' Scrappy]
They call me Fisher Price cause all I do is play nice
And I ain't gon run a gang of gorillas that love to fight
I'm the Iceman, I'm far away from the sun
But I'm still hot like a bullet pushing up out a gun
My charger look like a muscle lifting a ton
If you picking on me, yea you picked the right one
You passed another drink and I'm sipping another one
You trust me with the blunt and I'm blowing myself a blunt
Got a Fruit Loop Coupe looking like orange juice
When them niggas see the troop, they don't be knowing what to do
Yea I'm Scrap, greatest young nigga in the nation
Y'all niggas quit hating on the money that I'm making
I'm just country

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]
Look they call me Wayne, dirty south chaperone
So far ahead in the race, I don't know which lap I'm on
No homo, Young Louisiana
Hit you wit the .357 like MC Hammer
And money talks, so that's my grammar
If you ain't about money, you can step like a gamma
Am I the illest doing this? Hell yeah
I am fresher than the Prince of Bel-Air
And OG kush I what you smell here
Smoking the biggest blunts, don't worry I brought a spare
They say I'm at the top, but I'm almost there
And when I get, I will sit, don't worry I brought a chair
I put ice all over the Audemar
Piguet watchface, now time is hard to tell
And I will do whatever The Carter shall
So hot, going out with me is like going to hell

[Refrain]
[Hook: Drake]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, all hail Mr. Lyrical
Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?
I can show you new things, have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes - miwacles
Yeah, ok, they say that I'm the one, in fact
Some say that I'm their favourite
But I ain't hearing none of that
I’m about my team, ho, Young Money running back
Cash Money superstar, where the fuck is Stunna at?
Damn

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Untouchable 40 with my AK
Mastermind, big money heavy weight
On the grind, flipping money in every way
Headline, my bitch shine everyday
Pearl white Don P, Marc Jacobs gloves
Cartier Louis case with a dope plod
From the mud where they what you leave in your blood
Going in, flipping hundreds get the young plug
Show ‘em where it go
Floating on the floor, getting more dough
Grind hard, go, black diamond show, watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded? Cash no go
And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow
And how you stay shining? Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro
Diamond minks, fur, February snow

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, you know you paid when you got Baby with ya
It's Young Money like Ben Frank's baby pictures
I’m a lady twister I kiss her whiskers
I been running this shit - blisters
Sticking to the script: movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car running
I’m a big smoker, I’m a little drinker
My peace sign is just the trigger and the middle finger
Wha-what you know about it, man ya’ll clueless
I let two women ride me, that's car-poolers
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers
If y'all in the building then we are intruders
Simmer down pimpin', let me handle this
I know the game - analyst
Man I’m the shit, And y'all janitors
Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the cameras
[Verse 1: Tyga]
T-raww, fuck y'all, money tall, dick large
Tiger in my backyard, bitches on my futon
Dog house, no dog, shootout, Chris Paul
Walking on the marble floor, take your fucking shoes off
Bitch this is fox fur, killing shit, fuck a hearse
I can show you my choppa works
She give me head, when my head hurt
Deep throat, till the bitch burp
Her best friend said let me at 'em-Cousin Lurch
Smoking on that turf, get your feelings hurt
At your neck like a collared shirt, ball like a Nerf
Word, more green nigga than smoking pot
When I see more, I'm that horror from that little shop
Shop, butcher shop, open up your top
All you see is gold watch, Rolls Royce, road blocks
Sun roof, fogged out, chrome grill, gold mouth
Take a fuckin' look around

[Hook: Tyga]
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I say fuck them other niggas
Fuck them other niggas
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I'm the hottest nigga, all I do is turn up, bitch

Augh, I say fuck them other niggas, fuck them other niggas
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I'm the hottest nigga, all I do is turn up, bitch
500 degrees

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Thrilla manilla, I buy straight from the dealer
I'm politickin' in Paris, I'm buying statues and pillars
All from the Louvre nigga, mosaics from the museum
You niggas counting per diem, your bitch is in my DM
I never read 'em, weak bitch probably get seasick
On the yacht eat shrimp, see my name on a blimp
It read T-Raww's a pimp
Nigga I ain't dancin' but my hand on my hip
Full clip, movie shit, Bruce Wayne, Alfred
Niggas want a verse, can't even get a ad-lib
I'm killing this shit, and I'm killing your mind
One verse at a time, the shivers are mine
I murdered this shit, just takin' my time
Got bars, front gate, face shot, blind date
Rolex, timepiece, ain't got no time for no bitch speech
120 that six speed, pull it out that's all me
Just call me T-papi

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi over bitches
Smokin' color purple, blunt fat as Oprah Winfrey
I'm the nigga, the nigga, nigga, the nigga, nigga
I be snappin', I hope you get the bigger picture
I said fuck that nigga that you fuckin'
She say that nigga rap, I say he couldn't wrap a mummy
But let me pass the weed, and stop passin' judgement
Before I have to beat him like a dick he had it comin'
Been eating so much pussy, man I'm starting to get chubby
Schoolin' motherfuckers, I'm their favorite subject
Broomstick in my pants, I'm 'bout to go witch hunting
I'm already loaded, these niggas still bufferin'
I fuck my girlfriend and her best friend, these niggas is lesbians
Don't cross me like a pedestrian, I'm getting head watching ESPN
She holdin' me and carressin' me
Don't hate the player, hate the referee
If she F with me, I am definitely a necessity

[Hook]
[Lil Wayne talking]
It's the real shit, yeah
500 Degreez this time biotch
Yes sir, you already know

[Lil Wayne verse 1]

They like, "Wayne why the fuck you dressed in all black?"
I'm about to bring CMR back
And all the lames, we done lost that
And all we got is Weezy, Weezy, and Lil' Weezy to fall back
I'm about to lock it from the summer to the fall and back
"Its Weezy baby!" The ballers back
And the wheels on my car you got all of that
Stop playing, I've been balling jack
You don't want my Glock spraying - I hit all them cats
You don't want my stomach ache - I shit on them cats
I get all them gats - Fresh and B it's all a rap!
If I'm the only Hot Boy what do you call that?

[Hook]
You don't want to fuck with Weezy
You don't want to fuck with Weezy

And shit got me 'bout ass up

And I heard they got a nice chain
And for the right price I'll bust the right brain
And mommy hot cause pull up in that white thang
Yo nigga might be fly but I still get trifling
Riding through the city just me and my friend
Friday night special, professional tight aim
A gangsta is who you hearing

Got more skill than them there
I'm a Cash Money Millionaire

You don't want to fuck with Weezy

Hot Boy, Hot, Hot, Hot Boy, Hot, Hot, Hot Boy

So I can throw a 500 Degreez platinum party, then the after party
Me and my Squad stomping in this bitch, fuck a Kappa party
Don't go to rapper parties - I'm no rapper man
But when the homies come home we throw a monster jam

Get money
Or should I say young money
Ay killa you know the rules dip set for life

[Hook: Jim Jones]
I'm all about that motherfucking paper ho
This song goes out to all my money making hoes
60 rackz in my pocket, 60 rackz in my jeans
60 rackz in my pocket, top back when I lean
I pull up in that motherfucking Phantom Ghost
This song goes out to all my niggas getting dough
60 rackz in my pocket, 60 rackz in my jeans
60 rackz in my pocket top back when I lean

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
60 racks thats no dough, mattes fact thats ho dough
I made that when I transported, back and forth taking Nodoze
Rolex rose gold, my neck so cold
She seen't that quarter chill, V in black, quarter mill
We don't shop at saveraux, 60 thou for the roll
Drop top foreign flow, this is not affordable
Wrist cold, caught the flu, Cartier said quarter to
She sucked my dick, swallowed it, my watch still said quarter to
Dipset, Young Money, niggas know that that money grown
Wanna talk to me, you better talk to me, from that pool deck of my summer home (Can't hear you niggas)
My summer home, pool deck with like a hundred on
Who's a threat? Got a pool net, and my jewels wet like a thunderstorm

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Swear to God I go so hard, they call me Tunechi fuck 'em all
Can't pack no gun, so I keep a knife like that fuckin' Chucky doll
I'm at your neck like a shawl, on your ass like some drawers
I got 3 hoes with me, fuck, I look like Santa Claus
And I got bad bitches all over me, real niggas that roll with me
And we get off weight like that one bitch from Floetry
Got a pair of pants with 4 pockets, 15K in each of 'em
Do the math you mo'fucka, I'm on my Robin Leach, blood
Skating with my homeboys, talking shit smoking weed
I oversee everything, niggas call me overseas
Young mulah mothafucka, click clack boo ya, mothafucka
60 rackz in my pocket, try to jack and get bodied
Young Tunechi

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
I got an ill gift, I'm real swift, they be like, "Damn, he still rich"
When I send my men in black listen none of them niggas is will smith
I sell coke, I deal piff, when I ride by in that black on black
Ménage à trois with two double D's, come to see that's racks on racks
They ship it in, I give it to ya on the ground or in the air
They drop it off, they're like LeBron in the 4th quarter, I give it there
I be me, you be you, apologies to Groovie Lou
Sorry, brah, I ain't fuckin' with mase, yea yea tell 'em you be cool
Me I rep that Hud 6, I ain't even gon' play with 'em
Harlem Underworld for real, you can fool Wale and them

[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'mma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall: outfielder
You know I'mma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'mma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna
[Intro: Cassidy]
Yeah, I go by the name of Cassidy the Hustler
And I brought two of my niggas with me
And we about to shut the industry down
Aiyyo Wheezy let's get it poppin!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hit me,  Fuck that shit this the south side
Got a fat dick when your mouth wide, I'm from the take it outside
Nah do it right here, nah, how 'bout later on
Yeah when everybody home
Look, you fucking with Weezy F baby, please say the baby
Riding with your bitch, got keys on the lady
Triple gold D's Vogue tires on the whip
Young Carter sliding out, I'm flyer than the whip
Yeah, higher than an angel, or hotter than the devil
The pot or kettle, uh
The metal let 'em burn like "Usher" but worser
If there's any beef, I come Ron like Mercer
Word up, eagle street I'm throwing my curve up
We take your ice cream and turn you into Sherbert
I got flow I'm like "Sure" but
If it's about dough, I'm like "Sure 'nuff"
I'm from the bird bunch, Birdman Jr. you niggas bird lunch
I see your lips moving but I ain't heard much
You see the wrist moving, it look like pure punch
I hear the playa hating but I don't endorse such
I got the Escalade, guts like the tour bus
I got the styrofoam poured up with syrup
And in the tires where the package is gone
Midas been a Goodyear with these Firestones
I spit like Maya's poems, palming chromers
For the buyers chromosomes I got soma's
I got vicodins, valiums I ain't stopping
Got powder, heroin, ex, oxycontin
And that's how we rocking
How can you hear that bop unless I'm be-bopping?
Yeah skip when you hear that click
Cash money, nigga, I'm that shit
Weezy Baby

[Interlude: Cassidy]
That's what I'm talking about
Now Fab, spit at these niggas
And let them know why they ain't fuckin' with you

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You're goddamn right I'm feeling myself
A chauffeur, no sir, I'm wheeling myself
Looking for a chick chilling for self
So I can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
I'm having problems dealing with wealth
But you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
You niggas must've got a deal for your health
Your CD is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
I spend big, at any time I can start splurging
The twin SIGs open chests like a heart surgeon
And I'm buttoned up, I'm just a blue-collar crook
But I keep a stack thick as few college books
I got a new polished look
And 20 dime bitches, to show y'all niggas how my 2 dollars look
The boy's got at least 6 digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like 10 bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers
The 2 grand 20's make the hustlers suffer
Plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em
And the niggas in the hood keep quoting my lines
I don't jump ship, I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting, I'm fine
I'ma have these dick sucking niggas deep-throating the 9
I jumped in the English ship, Benzed whip
It's Terminator 2 chrome the engines dip
I'm reading scripts, no, not the penmanship
The box-office shit, a box off this bitch
Jessica Alba, Kirsten Dunst
And still make a mil' on the first of months
These dudes be the first to front
'Til their family and friends is in limos, they in hearse in front
I'm in the top position, I can make you a proposition
I'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
To hell with the patience
I'ma send a nigga down under like Australia vacations

[Cassidy: Interlude]
Yeah it is what it is
My niggas just killed y'all and I'mma close the casket

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
I'm tryin' not to let this industry get the best of me, y'all
I work hard for the fame, the game's stressing me y'all
All they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
From the hood to Hollywood, they're respecting me y'all
And even overseas, they're accepting me y'all
All the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
I get a lot of dirty money, so expect me to ball
But I'm saving all my checks, I'm investing 'em all
They say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall
Even the stars, but success is my destiny, y'all
Look, I cook tracks I got the recipe, y'all
You can't name another cat that can mess with me, y'all
At the shows all the hoes be molesting me, y'all
I got broads crying trying to get next to me, y'all
I got broads craving begging to have sex with me, y'all
Screaming, "Cass you don't know how sexy you are!"
And I'm happy I'm alive, God's blessing me y'all
And all the problems that arrive is God testing me y'all
So I pray everyday, but I ain't praying too much
Cause I be sinning everyday, so I ain't praying enough
And we all could be beat, and I ain't saying I'm tough
But if it's beef I don't speak, I ain't saying "What's up"
If it's beef when we meet then I'm spraying shit up
Prraat prraat. I ain't saying too much and that's that
Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
Cause the folks you call friends tend to envy the most
Some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
Burn the bridge and don't give a boat, let 'em sink
Sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
But sometimes you gotta give 'em the 9 and let 'em stink
You can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut, them niggas will ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die but, I ain't ready to leave
That's why, even if it's petty, I'll be ready to squeeze
But put a cheddar in cheese, the guac-a-moola
I pop the Ruger, send that hot shit through ya
Like booya, that's the sound when the pound busting
Ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
Clowning's nothing to pull out and blast you
I try to only resort to violence if I have to
But, man, niggas out here are playing fair
So before the odds even I'm leaving them laying there
And I ain't even playing, believe what I'm saying here
Cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
And found in a hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role I'll stomp a mud hole in your ass
And this Cass, nigga, I'm that sick
Full Surface nigga, I'm that shit
Bitch
[Hook]
And when they hear that new Weezy
All the dough boys go crazy
And watch the dough boys go crazy
Weezy f. ya heard yea I do it for the money baby that's my word
And when they hear that new weezy it remind them of that old baby

I'm the Birdman Jr

[Verse 1]
Yeah, jumped in the game as a youngin' no sisters no brothers
All i had was some money (yea)

In the kitchen tryin' make a 20 turn in to a 100 (yea)
The pot runnin over wit hot water
Throw a 8 ball in it watch it come back harder (harder)
The come back kid come back carter yea
That's what they screamin' loud as Aretha
And for them Franklins we pop at the ceaser
Ridin round with the whole block with the speakers (yea)
We in Miami we stoppin at teasers (yea)
Have a cigar and a shot of tequila (patron)
I use to wear two socks with my sneakers (hey)
Back when i was puttin all my rocks in my sneakers
Yea but now i'm rockin ya speakers
I'm all grown up now i'm rockin with divas yea
I could rock 'em to sleep
But I rather be at home straight rockin the kibeler
I'm up in traffic bobbin and weavin
I'm in and out like pussy and penis
It's lunch time I'm a cook up genious(yea)
20 for Serena 10 for the Venus
Yea i can get ya higher then a tennis skirt
Never filled out a application got plenty work

(chorus)


(verse2)
I'm lookin at 24 bricks on the counter
I'll make them dissapear in 24 hours (gone)
(yea) i'm really so honest that hot boy shit it's really so behind us
We on some new shit you niggas can't find us
That's like lookin in the rough for a diamond
We might hook a nigga up on consignment
And for the rest his life we keep an eye on 'em
Bussiness bad, fuck you pay me
Oh you had a fire, fuck u pay me
I'm might run through 80 in a week
But i can make a quarter million dollars off 1 street
Top in the game off one feet
Then i landed on two and i walked on through
What can you do when you living like me
Get fly in the house leave the pimpin in the street
As quiet as a mouse when you dippin through the street
If you lookin for some work you probably run into me
And on the humble the number still cheap
But the judge got numbers for a nigga to steep
Yea from a youngin to a g
Weezy baby from bundle to a key

(chorus)
And when they hear that new weezy all the dough boys go crazy
And watch the dough boys go crazy
Weezy f. ya heard yea i do it for the money baby that's my word
And when they hear that new weezy it remind them of that old baby
93 94 baby yea before the stunna yea the real bird man
I'm the bird man jr

Verse 3 birdman

And jumped in this game upon one roll
And got the game off the floor got the game on the low

This the family homie where g's man up with the hammers on 'em

And i remember when i first saw puff nigga i was in the projects camouflaged up nigga
Like fuck them shiny suits we hood nigga white tee's is what we do
Yea we young and tough nigga fuck the other foes man we's is standin up
Nigga jumped in the same lane same niggas all shouting out the same thing
Like 93 wasn't a shame a nigga playin with me and i'll bust his mother f**kin brain
I'll cook a thing nigga give it to the lil homie keep the change nigga
Deep boys deep in the flame know it ain't nothing but the bling bling king
Certified of made man me and the j.r so kiss a nicca pinky ring

(chorus)
And when they hear that new weezy all the dough boys go crazy
And watch the dough boys go crazy

And when they hear that new weezy it remind them of that old baby

[Hook x2: Akon]
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gone make me reveal it ay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tool on deck, why would I lie?
Nigga you a pussy, hope you got 9 lives
I can hit a nigga with the 9, 9 times
Country ass boy, country like LeAnn Rimes
Mississippi D-Banner and Lil Weezyana
Everybody got tools so you will need a hammer
I'm a pill poppin' animal, syrup sippin' nigga
I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fucking antenna
You fucking with this man, you can be this man's dinner
The 9 give me brains but the AK add liver
The rapper is insane flowing like a mad river
Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho, hard time giver
I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver
I got a girl, you wanna meet her?
Her name is 9 millimeter

[Hook]

[Verse 2: David Banner]
If I got 9 slugs, 9 bullets gone fly
If I got a red beam, 9 people gone die
9 mamas gone cry, 9 spirits in the sky
9 preachers preaching, 9 sermons telling 9 lies
Cause each and every one of y'all 9 niggas wasn't shit
I would have rather kept the 9 rugers in the ruger clip
The index finger slipped, the 9 let 9 spit
I lick em all like eighteen tits on 9 chicks
I'm a suicide risk, 9 slits on each wrist
If I die 9 times the next go-arounds a bitch
And if I come back, I'll throw 99 shows
And shove 9 inches of dick in 99 hoes

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a west coast original, black John Wayne
Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang
You better stop that, mang
Fat mouth to Dogg and I'ma pop-pop-bang
Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me
Niggas wanna touch me, none of that, trust me
I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride
I set aside all my feelings when I'm killing like a villain
Move quick like a cheetah, I'm a killa, I ain't here to lock up
I flash the heater, then lock your whole block up
Dip-dop-deeter Banner turn the beat up
Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught
You niggas always acting hard
I keep a 9 millimeter in my waist and got 2 more in the car
Yeah you're all about to get it so quit it, tryin' to conceal it
You'll fuck around and make me reveal it, so killas kill it

[Hook x2]
[Intro]
Huh
YMCMB
Huh
As I look around, we the only niggas with that A1 Perico
Huh

[Hook]
I’m smoking dope, I’m on my cell phone
I’m selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He wanna quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought four, I front him 5 more
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls

[Verse 1]
Suave House, still independent
Distribution Mexican, he still sending
No contract, take my word
Send a hundred packs, bitch, them my birds
Shoe box, no shoes in 'em
In the 2-seater, me and 2 women
No Def Jam, went solo
Took the custy’s price so low

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
It’s Lil Tunechi, what up doe?
I’m talking white girl; Marilyn Monroe
And I can get 'em for the sweet 16
Hard dope, call it HD Flat screen
Fuck outta here, your shit water whipped
You got that tan dope, look like a Florida bitch
Automatic leave 'em dead in the living room
Get it? Leave 'em dead in the living room
Fuck all these niggas and tell them bitches to kiss my ass
I put that pistol to his head and tell the nigga to have a blast
Fuck you mean I’m talking keys like Ray Charles
Rack 'em up, pool table full of 8 balls

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Soft white, I got that G-mix
I'm going gold, crumbs to the bricks
I'm on the road, lets buy some new whips
Trick a hundred hoes, spend a few chips
9 piece, straight 8 balls
Bitch I'm blowing up like napalm
Got your bottom bitch going AWOL
Nigga's looking at ya like you fell off
No sir, not me
I'm double platinum just like my Ferrari
Bullet proof nigga Teflon
Why you snorting that, that shit stepped on

[Hook]
[Hook]
I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

[Bridge]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

[Hook]
