[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]

Like oh, I'm here, this is my year

Boss her name, I call myself
Type of pussy nigga talking out her tongue
Yeah, yeah, that's how it goes with me
I just got a check up and ain't no ho with me
VIP bottles over D
On the couch got 'em all throwin fours with me
Hoes up, hoes down, all I gotta do is smile
You ain't want me back then, but I bet you want me now
Body going crazy, he want me to have his child
Fucking with them hoes, yeah I heard you getting around
Whisper him in the ear, tell him "I want it now"
He said "stop talking all that freaky shit, ain't tryna get aroused"
That's how it's post to be, yeah
That's how it's post to be, yeah

[Hook: Omarion]
If your chick come close to me
She ain't going home when she post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be
Ooh all my niggas close to me
And all them other niggas where they post to be
Ooh the hoes go for me
Have your chick send a pic like pose for me
Ooh, that's how it post to be
Ooh, that's how it post to be
Ooh, that's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
They about to take your phone, just see
I don't need no hoes exposin' me
Ain't another nigga cold as me
Ain't another nigga cold as me (cold as me)
And I'm living like a movie, pretty women in the jacuzzi
The way she kissing on her friend, do she even like men?
My nigga she could have fooled me
I be tryna chill, stay tight
But they all want some, can you blame 'em?
Want their walls decorated, rearranged
Cause a nigga handsome, wealthy, famous
Who gives a fuck what they say, he say, she say
Hey Trey, ain't ya hear Jhené say
(But he gotta eat the booty like groceries)
You know how wild I be
Had that pussy like "Clean up on aisle 3"
Had that pussy like, slow down, whoa now, please
Every time I go down, go down like sheesh
(I make em do it!)
They know my name, I ain't even gotta say it
Put it to rest every time a nigga lay
Ain't another nigga cold as me
Butt, butt, butt naked is what you're post to be

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
AMG kit on the Benz
You got home girls, I got friends
Y'all should have come to the house
Get all topless then let's go swimming
I just made a million like it's post to be
That's just the beginning like it's post to be
Pocket rockets stay real close to me
And a new bitch stay close to me
Oh, she a ho to me
We don't love hoes, how it's post to be
Ooh she did some blow off me
Told her I don't fuck around, I just blow the tree

[Hook: Omarion]

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Dead or alive, sayin' boss top 5
Let my top down just to throw the rock sign
Not Jigga, Jay Dilla and the Pharcyde
I'm the realest, disagreeing with a Glock 9
But fuckin' with us, so he had to get the Benz truck
Cutting corners, lil nigga fuck your rims up
She can't fuck with me, she say she rock with Wale
Double M we throw them alley oops, that's all day
West side, it's going down at the Polo Lounge
Half pound for my rounds just to go around
Copy paste, tweez niggas even 'bout that slang
Black bottle in the sky, free Gucci Mane

[Hook: Omarion]
[Produced by Kanye West, Mike Dean & Plain Pat]

[Intro: Bon Iver]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker– now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example:

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm about to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get
Ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said
"This the number to dial
If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit them with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gonna do now?
Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now"
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles
I kill the block, I murder the avenues
I rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
OK, first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'm a start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan that's the monster do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbiez got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki cause she's fake
She's on a diet but her pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give them whiplash
I think big, get cash, make them blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
I'm a motherfucking monster

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I crossed the line
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am heading home

I get 'em up! (I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (Fuck it, I'm 'on one)
I get 'em up! (I said I’m on one)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say anything I don’t mean
Like "what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!

[Hook: Drake]
All I care about is money an' the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and Imma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya "everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say "cheese" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches Mazeltov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence
(Young mula baby, YMCMB)

[Intro]
I love it though
I love it though, y'know?

[Hook]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
I know I’m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it’s rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I’m looking at her like this what you really wanted, huh?
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When the sun go down it's the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don’t leave while you're hot that’s how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme", not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?

[Hook]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven’t said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping Rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding. running signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings never stumble, retracing my steps
[Hook]
I ride for my niggas, dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas, dawg, I ride for my niggas, dawg
(Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg)
I ride for my niggas

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Damn, life's so short
Fuck, I don't wanna go to court
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though
Fuck it, I’m on the run for the money
I’m in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil niggas thuggin’, even got me paranoid
I’m gettin money, that's in any nigga category
Double M, I got G’s out in California

[Hook]

(Young Frankie Geechi Liberace)

[Verse 2: Drake]
It bothers me when the gods get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn’t come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y’all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don’t be ducking like you never wanted nothing
It's feeling like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from DC that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty M’s
Kobe my nigga I hate it had to be him
Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym
(Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it", I’m tearing holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em butterfly it, she’ll love it
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fucking finish line, we can’t wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker getting mine off rap with my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dog
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog
Dwight Howard on the post, dog
My niggas got the powder through the post, dog
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the Feds
10 grams off my last 250 now
Big ass crib, 250 down, damn
Gave my nigga Max 7-5
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30
Fuck it, got me thinking like I'm 7-5
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30

[Hook]
[Intro: Game]
Get my people out them chains nigga
I mean handcuffs, time to man up
Put my hands up? Fuck you sayin' bruh
Cause I'm a black man, in a Phantom
Or is it cause my windows tinted?
Car cost 300 thou' and I blow Indo in it
You mad cause your daughter fuck with me on spring break
Well, I'mma fuck her 'til the springs break

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, roll another one cause I’m winnin
In my four door looking real photogenic
Gentleman attire, in threads that won’t expire
I’m in a class of my own, my teacher got fired
Money getting long, pussy rate keep rising
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the P houses, did it from the wee hours
Selling that chicken no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power, then you get respect
I’m getting so much money I can buy ya bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women working naked
Fell in love with a waitress what the fuck I’m thinking
Bought that ho a ring it was for her pinky
Uhn, that’s pimpin’ that’s slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent

[Verse 2: Game]
Fuck y'all mad at me for
Got a black card, and a black phantom
With a white bitch in Idaho, I do the same thing in (Montana)
Got a thick bitch in Atlanta, got a redbone in the Chi
Got two chains, they two-tone, two hundred racks, no lie (true)

[Hook 1: Game]
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!

My lawyer threw them gloves on and beat another case

[Verse 3: Game]
Fuck y'all mad at me for, cause my belt got two G's on it
Her bag got two C's on it, my daughter's stroller got D's on it
Free Big Meech, Free Boosie and C-Murder
Like New Orleans, like Baltimore, come to Compton you'll see murders
And my AR see murders, that's beef nigga no burgers
I'm insane and you Usain, nigga better turn on them burners
Got coke swimming in that glass jar, bitch go turn on them burners
Got dope to sell in this hotel, no half price, no retail
You a bitch nigga, no female, I smack niggas, Sprewell
I'm on the block like D 12, I got the white, no D-12
Like a little nigga in Africa, I was born toting that K
And that's real shit, no Will Smith, and no Nona Gaye
But they yellin'...

[Hook 2: Game]
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle fuck it let 'em spray

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
I take my case to trial, hire the Dream Team
Robbie Kardashian, Johnnie Cochran, I seen things
I dream big, I think sharp
Inhale smoke, Hawaiian tree bark
Humble yourself, you not a G, keep it one with yourself
Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf
I got rifles with lasers, swing it just like the majors
Hit you right above navel, now you swimming in pavement
Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settling for less, I call 'em bottom shelf
Niggas tough on them blogs and never did nothing at all
On the road to the riches, bitches not tagging along

[Verse 5: Game]
..Unless it's ass in a thong, hit that ass and I'm gone
Disrespect my nigga Boss and I'm flashing the chrome
I'm waving the Tec, Tity spraying the Mac
Extendos in the back, gonna lap
Got a bitch that look like Laila Ali sitting in my lap
Got a call from Skateboard, pick 'em up at Lax
Speaking skateboards, where Tune at?
Fuck with him, I'll break a skateboard on a nigga back
2 Chainz!

[Verse 6: 2 Chainz]
Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie, No Lie already got a plaque
Mama got a house, daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with a ounce
Bad bitches and D-boys, we bring 'em out
If them niggas pussy, we douche 'em, we clean 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence
If you got work, go to work, don't work at your residence

[Verse 7: Game]
...For presidents
Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent
Riding through the jungles in that muthafuckin' elephant
That's a gray ghost, with the ears on it
Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the muthafuckas in, made another mill'
Got a nigga feeling like Cassius Clay
Thrilla in Manilla, nigga want it whip his ass today

[Hook 2]
[Verse 1: Future]
Smoke the first 48 hours
Grind 22 and sleep 2 hours

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She so high, her nose bleedin', my coke clean like chlorine
Got a white girl and she barefoot in my old-school, my floors clean
Maybach that's two-tone, phone tapped, got a few phones
Headphones on my futon, gangsta on my Groupon
I don't bop, I do the money dance, nah, I call it that Robert Kraft
Your whole clique look dead broke
My young bitch said "Roger that"
All my dogs got fox furs, teacher said I was a big dummy
Bitch better come suck my dick
These diamonds on me cost big money
Waitin' you to come jump my fence
I paid the bitch off of brick money
Dade County my body count, I whack a nigga on Easter Sunday
Smoke a blunt and might eat some pussy
Tell the truth, my mind gone
Piaget cost one ticket, you could never be in my timezone

[Hook: Future]
Fuck up some commas, let's fuck up some commas yeah

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Boy, I came from the grind up

D hat on me, bitch, it's just to remind you

Fuck a money counter, boy

Threw a party wit' Future, that's Futurama
Got a future baby mama lookin' like a young Madonna
Mixin' wit' Rihanna, boy, I couldn't tell you where to find her

Man, y'all fucked the game up, boy, I got to reset it

No unleaded, countin' up Aretha Franklins, you got to respect it
What the fuck these niggas want from me, nigga?

Boy, I'm a beast, head over fireplace, nigga

[Intro]
"Oooh, now you are one lucky nigger."
"You better listen to your boss white boy."
"Oh, I'm gonna walk in the moonlight with you."
"You wanna hold my hand?"

[Hook]
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves, so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black Bibles, while we send them all to hell
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!)
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!)
Black coffins! (I need a hundred...)

[Verse 1]
I seen a hundred niggas die
I put that on my life, Lord, I wouldn't tell a lie
Unless it had to do with mine, in the middle of the night
Killers coming for you life, all you wanna do is shine?
I broke off the chains only the realest remain
I see your praying to Jesus, but will that help ease the pain?
Seen a brother get slain for a jar full of change
Yet I post on the block, look like I'm Big Daddy Cane
Is you a cat or a mouse? Keep them rats out the house
A lotta scars on my back, get tattoes all around
Hundred dead bitches, hundred black coffins
Money on his head, bitch, I'm trying to make a fortune

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I seen a hundred women burn
As they stood firm, treat a nigga like a germ
What did she do to deserve? Put me on the farm
Pigs' feet in a jar; serve it to me warm
Any questions, they hang 'em, better pray for Dj-Django
Got me working in fields, too many years it gets fatal
All I want is my woman, such a wonderful mother, (mama!)
On the days that it rains, her smile bright like a summer
Our revenge is the sweetest, bitch cause I'm coming
Gonna die in my arms, for what you did to my mother (my mama!)
Hundred dead bitches, (Lord) hundred black coffins (why?)
12 gauge, shotgun, chest full of carbon (boom-boom)

[Hook]
[Hook: Big Sean]
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I play the keys, handle dope, Barry Manilow
The game a bitch, but at times she sweet like cantaloupe
Hit the road, key of coke in the manifold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes
Japanese denim, down south numbers
Hit it once, trust it'll make a fat fiend stumble
Do the speed limit, Argo shoes
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too
I'm tippin' strippers but I call it penny pinchin'
She talkin' shit but I can get her titties lifted
My new crib got its own city limit
Motherfucker got his own city in it
Blue marble on the floor, wet as salt water
Underboss I'll just play the holes like a golf course

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
One hundred keys, one hundred please
My gesundheit could make a whole city sneeze
Walked the mud jungle where they grinded out the leaves
So they swarm to my honey comb, hideout for the bees
You know what this sound like, money counters' sound bites
Machine gun fire, name ringin' through the town like
Church bells ringin', know what he was found like?
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white
She live on her knees, I live in a condo in the trees
The air's a little thinner that I breathe
The Iron Man Audi, let the top striptease
My life's in slow motion, but the watch screamin' freeze
Ugh, young nigga gettin' money
The feds' dragnet couldn't take nothin' from me
The decoy car is a crash test dummy
What follows is a hundred of 'em, wrapped like a mummy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
B.I., boi
And they gon' risk a hundred lives
So they could rock a hundred whites
Baguettes lookin' like a hundred lights
Man when Blade died my city cried a hundred nights
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred tight
Every wrong I do I'm steady tryna do a hundred rights
Got her for cheap, compare the price
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White
And don't worry 'bout the info
From where they rob Pintos and could afford Enzos
Cause everybody knows keys open doors, but bricks open windows
Counting a hundred hundreds, more by more
Built this from the tile up, floor by floor
Talk shit, I'll send 'em door by door
Made for the Snow White like 4 by 4s

[Hook]
[Intro: DJ Khaled]
This is for the hood, this is for the ghetto
This is for the niggas getting that money
That cash money, that 100 million dollar money
We got money
We the best

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Ridin' big, gettin' mine
Two microwaves flip a brick at a time
Bandanna on the handle ready for the whip
When I wear the whitest soft watch it disappear
I disappear in the middle of the night
When I reappear, bet the boss look so bright
For life, dough boy
More strikes, oh boy
We ridin' low, gettin' high
80 round drum let ya know the time
When you see the Maybach, niggas know it's mine
Ridin' on the 2-4's I'm ahead of my time
Watch runnin' from kind, another one on my mind
Phone bill 4 grand get your ho on my line
In the hood, ho niggas act funny
Only real niggas really get to touch cash money

[Hook: Dre]
I spent 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Everyday a new whip homie, So you know I gets my shine on
Flip after we flip homie, So you know I gets my grind on
Birdman daddy, Pullin up in the brand new Cadi
Got money, living lavish, Got bitches, shipping package
Move them things, Get them things, Switch that lane
Get that chain, Flip them thangs, Get yo money hommie do your thing
See I got em like 10 times, spend money got em like 10 times
Flip that got em like 10 times, Got money like 10 more times nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I'm from the ghetto, the bottom, the hood, the slums
There's money out here, we just trying to get some
Cool like Dre nigga, A like K
When ya talk about me you better watch what ya say
Don't ever keep them things where ya lay
Cuz them pussy ass niggas show the folks where ya stay
Ya thought he was ya dog, said he was a G
Sounds like another co-defendant to me
Niggas move sloppy and I really don't like it
Fuck around and get everybody indicted
Saw this shit coming, you woulda thought I was a psychic
Fuck around go dead broke trying to fight it

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I, I, I all night it, I every day it
And when it comes to my dues, I over payed it
Rated hood bitch, Bitch I'm hood bitch
I ain't a asshole, but I'm on some hood shit
I wish I would switch, I don't know how
Blood gang swarm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile
Like my grill didn't, Cost me a 100 thou

I smell a lot of 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Cash Money Millionaires, Cash Money Billionaires, Cash Money Trillionaires
We rich
We ain't never gone stop, never
We got money nigga
[Hook]
I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Bitch, I do what I do, I feel how I feel
Got my drink on the rocks, got my house on the hill
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her, for real
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill
After bill, but I still pay respect to my city
So much man you thought I was in debt for real
Every day is a chase, every night is a thrill
I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will
G.O.O.D music or die ho, shout out to Ye-Ye
Dumped all my other hoes, shout out to Nay-Nay
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay
I'm higher than Day-Day, no off day just pay day
Boy, since I was a baby I swear I was OG, you was a no G
Textin' these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's
When you was a OG, bitch, I'd still be more G
Fuck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares
About not gettin' that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped "Control" just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearin' the same clothes
Going to the same club, taking the same pose
Pillow talkin' with the same hoes
All day about how Em ain't the same Em
And Hov ain't the same Hov
Some niggas never grew up, boy, they only grow old
I guess that what coming up in Detroit do
Finally famous is a Detroit crew
Fuck with me and you Detroit food
End up on the fuckin' Detroit news, better off in the Detroit zoo
Everybody got haters, I swear we been through this
Martin had Malcolm, Caesar had Brutus
Fuck am I sayin', man, Jesus had Judas
I guess I'm alright though, if I just got you, bitch
You gon' pull up friend to friend, I'mma pull up Benz to Benz
While you and her are cheek to cheek, me and her dick to chin
That's the difference between a 9-to-5 and a 10-to-10
Sean Don...

[Hook]

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
They done fucked up now, ha-ha
Mastermind...

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My kilos on ice, my sneakers snow white
I got a place at the Trump, just to pray for advice
My new bitch is Hispanic, got me speaking bilingual
Some call it trickin' cause this bitch thicker than Trina
Anybody wanna motherfuckin' die? Come try me then
You ain't real till you fucked your dawg's ho
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz
Comin' through and I don't fuck with niggas
Bitch you wish you wanna fuck a nigga
Good chance she done fucked a nigga
Turned around and said "fuck a nigga"
Stack on my belt, double M we a cult
Mastermind's in control, so nigga fuck what you thought
16's of coke, all my verses be dope
Fuck XXL cause I'm the source to these quotes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Travi$ Scott]
I've been up from ten to ten, swear I won't sin again
Raising Hell in my residence, Godly presence with presidents
My day job ain't made me shit, public housin' ain't got no fence
And college ain't make no sense, niggas whole home invaded quick
I done work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue
One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain, one problem
Plus the issues, I can't solve them
But it's nothin', and I'm still in the club on the couch still fuckin' up somethin'
Nigga please!
Mama please, I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred G's
Scratch that, 'til I make a hundred million
Then I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion
Who knew one day your son would grow up and learn how to be the boy
Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy
God damn, how you do that?

[Hook]
[Hook]
Look at my wrist
Look at, look at
My wrist
Equivalent to 10 bricks
10 bricks to the fish

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Look at my wrist, it's 200 thou
That mean fuck that nigga, come and fuck me now
Suck me down, blow my socks
Push that coupe, Ima drop that top
And all them niggas that talk, them bitches never had money
Whip it with a fork and get that extra mall money
Get you first million and the come in with a test
Watch for the feds, jack boys, and IRS
4 Jesus pieces and a motherfucking tec
Clapping at all you niggas imitating Sammy Gravano
Got them argentines and kilos up in the condo
And my European bitch always screaming Armani
10 bricks on the wrist, I find it funny
I'm counting cash, you don't know me nigga
Its Rozay, the one and only nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Birdman]
See I'm richer than the richest
Filthy by my riches
Dope boy fresh, made man getting tickets
Holiday sunshine how we get it
Flipping in the Bentley every time we come and spin it
So she love the way I shine homie
Put on her mind, do it big time homie
Priceless, you know the game with no line homie
Tote it all the time, see my son did time on it
So 100 mill what we eat
The feast of the streets, Cash money young beast
Full grind, Cash Money all the time
Fire flame spitter do this shit in day time
Flip a nigga another top
The watch on rocks, do this shit hard knocks
A all red new fleet, swagged out nigga, YMCMB

[Hook]
[Verse 1: Tyga]
T-Raw's, rock my own kick game
8 figure deal how I'm court-side at Clip game
Still pop ace king shit I'm with Rosé
Black Maybach leather gloves on that OJ
OK the day you beating me bitch no day
Bandz A Make Her Dance, that's thousand dollar foreplay
AK get a full clip not a sound wave
You kissed her in her mouth, ask her how my dick taste
Bitch nigga you don't want no drama I'm worth a couple commas
It's death before dishonor
Last king come sign up all my shit be designer
Extraordinary rhymer I bodied yo' shit for nothing
West up, hot temper
Get wet up she give me head not neck up
She clean the mess up
One false move death from gesture
Cash in the safe I don't feel no pressure

[Hook 2x]

Cuz it's 187 how I'm killing these hoes

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

Hating on hood niggas dying 'round here

Hands clap like a nigga in the stadium
Million dollar chain but I'm rocking 8 of 'em
I see you sleeping boy don't make me pick your label up

Another triple got me tripping like it's angel dust

It's global
This worldwide right here
From London, Africa, U.S
Booba! Rozay! Ugh!
Need the money on a scale baby
Real niggas worldwide you heard me?
It's all we know, yeah

[Couplet 1 : Booba]
J'suis sur la Lune, sont au Moyen-Âge
V-12, "sans rancune" dit le carénage
D'puis Beat de Boul c'est le carnage
Parait qu'j'suis juif ? J't'enfonce une grosse bite ashkénaze
Carré d'as, VIP dans marécage
Brazamizi R.I.P. Malekal
Alerte aux rappeurs français, v'là les nazes
Combien font rap de poucaves : v'là les blazes
J'suis posé, tranquille au calme
Un mètre quatre-vingt douze, 102 kilogrammes
J'peux toutes les kéni, j'suis polygame
Ici c'est Tallac, fuck Sony, fuck PolyGram
Y a qu'dans la rue qu'j'ai eu du piston, c'est dommage
Aller-retour en prison, c'est normal
Remonte l'avenue des champs en DeLorean
Ma source de revenu dans du cellophane

[Refrain : Booba]
On a perdu des frères, on ne s'en est jamais remis
Si peu d'adversaires, tellement d'ennemis
Haches, kalash, négro, bougnoules sur la mélodie
Crack, shit, rap, renoi pour nous c'est la belle vie
La belle viiiiiie, la belle viiiiiie
Uzi, mitraillettes, code 1.8.7. sur la mélodie
Bouteille en l'ai-ai-ai-air !
T'attends qu'Jésus revienne on prend du biff on refait nos vies
Gangster shit

[Couplet 2 : Booba]
Les royalties c'est mieux qu'la cess
J'vais plus au hebs, mon studio c'est mon Classe S-
600, Lorinser puissant
Après-skis sur mon terrain, terrain glissant
Sénégalais personne peut m'égaler
Sur un million d'euros mon négro j'aime bien m'étaler
J'aime faire la guerre demande à mes alliés
Ma mère est fière j'suis tellement médaillé
La drogue c'est compliqué donc je l'ai détaillée
Criminel en stage enfermé dans cage d'escalier
J'suis chaud comme le premier août
Ding-dong bâtard t'es KO premier round
La jeunesse en dé-T-R-esse
En France qui roule en CLS, attire les CRS
Rebelle comme Casamançais Mendy, Gomis
Nos flingues sont plus gros qu'ceux d'la police

[Refrain]

[Couplet 3 : Rick Ross]
{Maybach Music}
I ride for my dawgz and I swear to God
From a scrub on the corner, webs on the wall
I used to be that youngin' on a air mattress
Now it's Panameras, fly private to Paris
Niggas on the sideline wanna see me touch
I wanna see their faces when that trigger bust
All them boys I ran with, they gave 'em ten and up
When I made forty mil I tatted "live it up"
We glorify the niggas who done did time
Homies love you and they hate you at the same time
Gold Cuban Linx with the Benz sign
Club photographs throwin' gang signs
Niggas sound spiteful when you livin' right
Michael Tyson money winnin' is a sacrifice
Don King nigga, milli on the ring (boss)
It's Ricky Rozay, Booba do your thing

2Pac back, 2Pac back
There’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better Picture Me Rollin’
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming 2Pac back, 2Pac back
There’s all these btiches screaming that 2Pac back

[Meek Mill]
Huh, 2Pac back, I’m 2 Glocks strapped
Rolling down in Philly this the new Iraq
Soon as I hit the the hood they screaming who got wacked
It’s a recession on the work, I’m screaming who got crack
I’m sippin Hennessy, riding on my muthafucking enemies
Sliding in the back screamin MMG (Maybach Music)
10 bitches and they dime so it’s Tennessee
Hail Mary, put my wrist on froze
Presidential is gold, nigga play with my money my shooters lifting his soul
40 kick like in soccer, bullets hitting the goal
Bitch I’m like John Wall cause I just give em and go
Plotting on this new 7, I can picture me rolling
Pockets look like they pregnant because them bitches is swollen
Got a clip I can loan, all them snitches could hold em
Look at them muthaf-ckin’ wheels, them bitches is stolen
They screamin’…

[Hook]

[Meek Mill]
Mommy a soldier, daddy is dead
Catch the nigga that did it, and we gon’ carry his head
Fuck 911, tell em have him in?
Talking Death Row records, tell em have me a chair
Let it burn, I’m screaming: "Free my nigga Earl!"
He’s due in, no hestitation we can’t even get a turn
And my Mackaveli CD then I listened than I learned
Grabbed my Mac above the dresser, my OG’s say hold it firm
I’m dreaming spitting with Pac, cyphers with BIG
Try to send me upstate with the license ?
Had me scraping my wax, sleeping, my knife in the bed
They got a nigga on point like there’sa price on my head
I going max, got me knocking suckers and they back
In these cells, raising hell, tryna get back to the trap
But don’t ever get it twisted it’s Meek Mill spittin’ facts
Plus somebody said they seen it
And they mean it so they steady screaming
Right back at you

Yeah, classic hip hop shit
Dr. D-R-E, Rozay and Jay, let's get 'em

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
We started out mopping floors
And now we front row at the awards
Number one for the last twenty years
If you real, mothafucka scream cheers!
Mothafucka scream cheers!
Heh, and it is what it is
He wanted to shine at the swap meet
Til the white boys got him in that hot seat
I only love it when her hair long
You should listen to this beat through my headphones
Money long, number one twenty years strong
Fuck a gym, I am him, I'm Andre Young
G5эs to 64эs, Dre got 'em
If the bitch bad I got her in red bottoms
Great weed, nice homes, bread proper
Tec nine, one chamber, top shotta
Bentley coupe, new yacht, my helicopter
Born broke, real nigga straight out of Compton
The fuck you magazine niggas want from me?
I rewrote the game, nigga, now talk money
All black on my Al Capone shit
I built a house, nigga get your own shit
I only love it when her hair long
You should listen to this beat through my headphones

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
See y'all niggas
Hit the switches on that shit one time, ugh
Let the top down

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I came a long way from the weed game
Twenty stack seats at the Heat game
And I'm still strapped with the heat man
Can't be steppin' on a nigga feet man
80 pair of sneakers came from the D game
Cousin was a Crip, said it was a C thing
Brown bag money in a duffle bag
Fuck 'em all, wet 'em and we gotta double back
The homie whippin' chickens in his momma kitchen
On the mission, said he get it for his son tuition
Real nigga's dreams comin' to fruition
Stumble, but I never fall, leanin' on my pistol
I only love it when the ass fat
We should listen to this track in my Maybach
I'm just tryin' to be a billionaire
Come and suck a dick for a millionaire

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Uh, it's just different
I know it feels different

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Uh, I only love her if her eyes brown
Play this shit while you play around with my crown
King H-O, y'all should know by now
But if you don't know, uh
Millions on the wall in all my rooms
Niggas couldn't fuck with my daughter's room
Niggas couldn't walk in my daughter's socks
Banksy bitches, Basquiat
I ran through that buck fifty Live Nation fronted me
They workin' on another deal, they talkin' two hundred fifty
I'm holdin' out for three
Two seventy five and I just might agree
Ex-D-boy, used to park my Beamer
Now look at me, I can park in my own arena
I only love her if her weave new
I'm still a hood nigga, what you want me to do?
Been hoppin' out the BM with your BM
Taking her places that you can't go with your per diem
Screamin' carpe diem until I'm a dead poet
Robin Williams shit, I deserve a golden globe bitch!
I take a Ace in the meanwhile
You ain't gotta keep this Khaled, it's just a freestyle
Fuck rap money, I've made more off grapes
Fuck show money, I spent that on drapes
Close the curtains, fuck boy, out my face
I whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermes store, somebody save me
Stuntin' to the max like wavy, oh shit!
Oh, stuntin' to the max, I'm so wavy
Used to shop at TJ Maxx back in '83
I don't even know if it was open then
I ain't know Oprah then
Have the XL 80 bike
Loud motor, they be like, "Damn!" when I'm comin' through, rrraaanngg
Had the grill in '88, y'all niggas is late
You got all that, right?
I love this shit like my own daughter
Let's spray these niggas, baby, just like daddy taught ya
Young, this is just different
[Intro: Adrien Broner]
40, 40
Woo!

[Hook: Adrien Broner]
Hit the club at 12:40 with like 40
Strapped at the 40/40 with two 40's on me
If I get 40 bricks, I let two go for 40
That's 40 gone, now I need 40 more
F-f-forty, the watch I got, it cost me 40
The drop I dropped, it cost me 40
Ridin' with that 40 got me [?]
Don't say my real name, just call me 40

[Verse 1: Adrien Broner]
I'm ridin' dirty with the 40
I just may be a dirty 40
You got caught and told 40 stories
Before a nigga tell shit, I'm doin' 40
My bitch Rollie cost me 40 racks
5K on my pinky, that cost me 40 flat
Niggas see the 40 and start runnin' track
Swear to God he ran a 4.4 in a 40 flat
40 licks, that's 40 bricks
They gave my uncle 46 for 40 bricks
And he went in when he was 40
Now he come home 2040

[Hook: Adrien Broner]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Just poured a half a pint up in this Mountain Dew
They call me Kilo Shawty, known to act a fool
So if you come with 40, then I'm snatchin' 2
I learned to whip it back in '92
I keep a pack of bitches like they backwoods
First nigga with the wraith with the black wood
Spent 400 on another rolls
The lambo sat so long I even had it towed
40 on the Rollie with the Glock 4
I run this bitch if a pussy bitch block 4
It's not funny if you hear me knock
Narcs come and get the money, stop money, switchin' numbers

[Hook: Adrien Broner]

[Verse 3: Adrien Broner]
In the club with like 40 niggas
That's 40 40's, 16 hundred with us
I know you see me, sometimes I see you niggas
If I put 40 on your head, bet they don't see you, nigga
These niggas' 40, still tryna be that nigga
Bet when I'm 40, I'm still gon' be that nigga
Miami night, like KOD, man they took 40 bitches
Man that was 40 bottles of liquor and 40 strippers
40, hit two licks on West 40th street
Me him at the spot, charged him 40 apiece
I'm up 80 at 9:40, my mornin' was sweet
Now I'm done for the day, I made 240 this week

[Hook: Adrien Broner]
[Intro]
This the realest shit in the streets
Untouchable empire
The only niggas breaking Backwoods in the Bentleys baby
Believe it
Let's get this motherfucking money
(Rich gang)

[Hook]
I'm down to fill this empty safe
I'm down to fill this empty safe
My loyal niggas gon' set me straight
My loyal niggas gon' set me straight
Trying to flip these 50 plates
It's time to flip these 50 plates
This lil' juug gon' set me straight
This lil' juug gon' set me straight

[Verse 1]
Chrome wheels on my 68
Double M strong in fifty states
My Mexicans gonna get me straight
But that phone bill it can't be late
Six mil in that interstate
I'm down to fill these empty safes
Grinding nigga wanna beat this case (Boss)
Gun charge in New York state
Ho niggas up in my face
Painkillers take pain away
Raaa them sticks come, they bang away
Raaa bang, bang, bang anyway

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Big wheels on my big V8
Fuck with me you wanna get this cake
Diamonds fill my empty safe
These hundred bills just made my day
Strip club is where we meet
Big booty is how she eats
Them fuck niggas she know they fake
I'm in the club get to flip my pays
My loyal niggas gon' set me straight
My loyal niggas gonna set me straight
My Cuban plug he got that weight
Tell Swalu come get this cake

[Hook]
[Refrain: Rick Ross]
600 Benz, house six hundred grand
That was six years ago, whips come from Japan
I get that work from my face
I get that work from my face

[Wale]
600 Benz, condo six hundred grand
I got twelve hundred kicks, them bitches straight from Japan
My ambition is wicked I put that shit on my hand

[Rick Ross]
I get that work from my face

[Wale]
I put that shit on my man

[Verse 1:Wale]
Wale, real nigga, where the totem, blowin' bomb haze
I just tell CJ keep on rollin’ that's my shorty
Tinted out, you ain't seeing through
All black everything, this shit like a HBCU
Maybach music, major moves
I’m saving major loot
I make my old bitch buy me all the latest shoes
One whip just ain't enough, I just seen 33
You only half a W without a second V
Gotta be dreamin, gotta be chosen
Shawty when I was 20 I had a Camry and tokens
But now I’m ok, bitch I got my shit together
Rozay told me keep on working, shawty you’ll be rich forever, ever
Forever my endeavours and I sever my opponents
I’m cold like its in Denver
The dilemma is, you think I got no conscience
You think I just here flossing and talking?

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Dependin' on how I feel, either the coupe or sedan
I’m only dealin' with you, nothin' to do with your man
Niggas ruin your plans, it’s best to do what you can
I’m up to six hundred bricks, started with two hundred grams
Hand to hand in the cold
Pockets on hella swole
I was breakin' ‘em down, now I’m sellin' ‘em whole
Work straight out the kitchen
Ain't no competition
You just shut up and listen and you can complete the mission
Know you want me to fall
I don’t do nothing but ball
You heard I was in jail, well I just came from the mall
I’m on my way to the jeweler bout to cop me a Muller
Keep the digital ruler at arm's length of the Ruger
Life’s a bitch and I feel her
Ain't nobody iller, perico Godzilla
Catch me blowing vanillas
Used to be blood money

Now it’s go hard scrilla
After I count it all up, I’ma go to the dealer and get a…

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Hope you heard that intro
This that I been grindin' cause I’ve been savin' for that Benz flow
To mash on assholes with petty badges
Tell em’ niggas we throwed, but they never gon catch us
If I am pulled over, I know they gon be on it
Cause it’s hot in here and I got no L like the ’72 Dolphins
Woooh, race my niggas, and I bet you never pass me like a free safety
I’m Polamalu, 600 the newest model
My newest motto to use a condom with newest models
Uhh, got a hundred on the dash, young
Ya ain't killers ya’ll got hundred yard dash guns
I’m a rare one, camo’s and some rare ones
Where I'm from is a circus hope you don’t expect a fair one
Dropping hundreds like it ain't nothin'
Really it was but you know I never sayin’ nothin'

[Hook]
[Intro]
God forgives...I don't
In other words, retaliation is a must!
Boom boom boom boom!

[Hook]
I bow my head, I pray to God
Survival of the fittest: help me hold my chopper lord!
If I die today, on the highway to heaven
Can I let my top down in my 911?
In my 911?
In my 911?
In my 911?
In my 911?
Financial fanatic, 40 bricks in my attic
400K in my baggage, 80 round automatic
You can't stop a bullet, this one for the money
Secret indictments, Porsche costs me 200

[Verse 1]
Fuck all these broke niggas cause all I do is ball
Ain't no more off days, my crib look like a mall
Fired the stylist, went and bought a big and tall
Niggas still scheming, but we sliding on 'em all!
I remember picking watermelons
Now the Porsche cost me a quarter million!
If I die tonight I know I'm coming back nigga
Reincarnated: big black fat nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fuck your investigation, study my elevation
Cherry red 911, straight to my destination
Mayweather got a fight, make me some reservations
Knew I flew private nigga, strapped with no hesitations
Gucci Pucci money long, he got 20 cars
Graduated from them blocks, now it's stocks and bonds
Hoes wanna know, hoes wanna show
They know a nigga's name, they know a nigga's strong
Fuck wit me!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck your insinuation, work come from Venezuela
Love me some skinny bitches, fat boy just 'bout his paper
Hustle while niggas gossip, hating, that switch the topic
Jump in my 911, 2 bricks in my compartment!
She let me smell her pussy!
I know you smell the money!
Still smell the gunpowder
911: 100 miles and running

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
When I climb on top, I say I'm into you
A lot of chickens in the coupe; cock-a-doodle-doo
I fucked the secretary, fuck the interview
If I was in the NBA, I'd hoop in Gucci tennis shoes
Chopper spray like antihistamines
Triple beam, Versace swag on creatine
When I left the lot, I spent a half a milli
When I pulled up to your spot, I had a half a ceiling
Got your bitch with me, trying to suck up
I don't trust my chauffeur, so shut the fuck up
Uh, the new chopper hold a hundred rounds
When I park on the curb, the grill look like Bobby Brown

[Hook]
[Hook]
I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He want a quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought four, I front him 5 more
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Suave house, still independent
Distribution Mexican, he still sending
No contract, take my word
Send a hundred packs bitch, them my birds
Shoe box, no shoes in 'em
In the two seater, me and two women
No Def Jam, went solo
Took the custies prices solo

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
It's the king young gunner
Hotter than a sauna in the summer
Nigga think I'm playing round if you wanna
Bring the thunder and the lightening
Like a sighting if you try me
On my Warren Buffet shit
That monkey shit behind me
You want a square, nigga, you know where to find me
Don't call me on my cell
You tryna send a pimp to jail
If you buying 25 you can get it for the twelve
Uncut, rocked up, got tan and pale yeah
Hey let me send a little message to my enemies
You nigga get to telling have 'em buried 'fore they sentence me
Come to ATL, hit any trap bet they remember me
Billionaire swag with a dope boys energy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Soft white, I got that G-mix
I'm going Gold, crumbs to the bricks
I'm on the road, lets buy some new whips
Trick a hundred hoes, spend a few chips
9 piece, straight 8 balls
Bitch I'm blowing up like Napalm
Got your bottom bitch going AWOL
Nigga's looking at ya like you fell off
No sir, not me
I'm double platinum just like my Ferrari
Bullet proof, nigga, Teflon
Why you snorting that, that shit stepped on

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
It’s Lil Tunechi, what up doe?

And I can get 'em for the sweet 16
Hard dope, call it HD Flat screen
Fuck outta here, your shit water whipped
You got that tan dope, look like a Florida bitch
Automatic leave 'em dead in the living room
Get it? Leave 'em dead in the living room
Fuck all these niggas and tell them bitches to kiss my ass
I put that pistol to his head and tell the nigga to have a blast
Fuck you mean I’m talking keys like Ray Charles
Rack 'em up, pool table full of 8 balls

[Hook]

[Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
Ay yo, it's DJ Kay Slay, the drama king
So this is what it comes down to, huh?
Y'all niggas think y'all 'bout that life?
Well it's time to show and prove
Fab, set it off!

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Look, I terminate a bitch, like her name was Sarah Connor
Where I'm from, we never meet daddies; swear on mommas
I'm high fashion, so my Gucci reeks of marijuana
My shoes are killing them! I call these a pair of homi-cides
Put me in the passenger and I'mma ride, cause my mind is full of massacres
Killer verses, I lay 'em down and fill up hearses
You can't be the best without knowing who the worst is
Me and Kay a lot alike, we don't fake nothing
Thick bitches in my sheets, I be straight stunting
You got the wrong keys, I ain't who to start with
Rise of the apes, now who you monkeys getting smart with?

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'm bout that money, I'm bout that fetty
I'm down to get it by any means necessary
I'm bout that drama, I'm bout that strife
Now fuck with me or with my team and you gonna see
Bi-bi-bi-bitch I'm bout that life!
I-I-I'm go-going hard, go-going in
Tryna get what I can get before these people give me 25 to life
Now tell them hatin' ass niggas, that hatin' only makes you die quicker
Cause bitch I'm bout that life!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
In love with the money, infatuated with coupes
Immaculate living, money stack up to my roof
The baddest of women, purse matchin' the boots
That's the half, you don't wanna see what's in that fuckin' bag
Pull it like a flip cam, first you aim it, then you fire
Penthouse smoker, nigga, I can't get no higher
Hella bad heroine in every bag she carry "O."
You niggas ain't getting money, fuck it and carry on
The biggest and the richest, fucking self made
Ricky Rozay and my nigga Kay Slay
Pound of purple green, 2 liter of pink Sprite.
I could flip a brick before a chick can blink twice!

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Nelly]
You know what? You don't like me, I don't give a fuck
Respect is like some money to me, I don't get enough!
Like I ain't put on the hardest city in America
St. Louis, and we ain't scared of ya
King of the drama, see him rollin' with the drama king
Yo Kay Slay, you want lil' momma from your magazine?
You know the one that's got a body like a cartoon
Ass like a whale 'til lil' durrty gotta harpoon
Woo! This stacking racks on racks
Go check my hallways mother fucker, plaques on plaques
These niggas lying a lot, I'm speaking facts on facts
My hotel room's infested durrty, rats on rats

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Looking at a dollar bill, saw the White House
Then I flipped a couple bills, bought a white house
Triple beam on a triple stack, triple back
Going back court like I dribbled back, simple fact
When that drop roller and that top fold up
Bitches going both ways like they're bipolar
Pop the ace Black Jack, ski mask, black mac
Hit the back of your head, turn your fitted to a snapback
Best of the greatest, bought the pussy and paid for maintenance
Waste of money, wack head, the bitch brainless
Word to Kay Slay, you niggas straight stuntin'
I be spending seven digits like it ain't nothin'

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 1: Nas]
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of em pull through but one didn't, son's finished, you took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, cause of a

[Hook: Nas]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We grew up doing graffiti, now hollow heads getting heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up
20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight
We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a TEC off the shelf, live forever; that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodging my clique
Cut a check; I use your bitch for some bargaining chips
In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't

[Hook]

[Bridge: Nas]
Accident murderer
Accident murderer, you just an accident murderer

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sista?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping
But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Think of my nigga Drawz, but you aren't a name to me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary
[Hook]
