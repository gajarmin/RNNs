[Produced by DJ Pooh]

[Verse 1]
Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinking will I live another 24
I gotta go cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm asking y'all
"Which park are y'all playing basketball?"
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexing, didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watching "Yo! MTV Raps"
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas and watch me break 'em
With the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7 even back door Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yelling domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion, hit the 3-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
2 in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp"
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I got to say it was a good day

[Outro]
Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit. What the fuck am I thinking about?”
[Produced by Sir Jinx]

Fuck All Ya'll

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight Bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stomping
While y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the Whites, one big house
And not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? (Who ya fooling!)
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my Mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ay yo Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you Benedict
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
Cause you know I'm the one that flowed
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B, and ya'll disgrace the C-P-T
Cause you're getting fucked out your green by a White boy
With no vaseline

[Hook]
Now you're getting done without vaseline (3x)
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it

[Verse 2]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls
Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a mothafucking Ready Teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
Cause he's going out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren, cause I remember when you drove a B-210
Broke as a mothafucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the First Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green, oh yeah
The Villain does get fucked with no vaseline

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
And I'll think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fucking your homeboys
You little maggot; Eazy E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E a'be hanging from a tree
With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light em up, burn em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking bout
Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple
Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a White Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk, too
Trying to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Eric Wright, punk always into something, getting fucked at night
By Mista Shitpacker
Bend over for the goddamn cracker, no vaseline
[Intro]
Dr. Dre: Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
Ice Cube: Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
Dr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself)

[Verse 1]
I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel

[Hook]
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Verse 2]
Now, getting back to the PG, that's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks, I mean hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians curse at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say "Hell no!"
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer and in the spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just

[Hook]
[Verse 1:Eazy-E]
Yeah, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff with this and don't slip
On a funky-dope track jump back
Strapped with a fat buddah sack and a 7-8 'Lac
Go clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing
It's so sweet, when you got money to spend
I got a proper big tilt and a fabec Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho
That's how it is, and that's how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow
Givin love to them playaz that I know is real G's

[Verse 2:2Pac]
Mobbin' like a motherfucker stuck
Can you put your middle finger out the window gettin' fucked off - liquor
Get loaded can't control it
Nigga pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bones act to the whole stack
Keep your dough fat

[Verse 3:Eazy-E]
Or you might get what we call the rat pack
I gives a damn bout a skanless trick
Let me hit it one time and trick that sick
I don't trip, gives my dough to no ho
That's how it is, I got no love for ya

[Verse 4:2Pac]
And jealous muthafuckas can't see
That it's the fame that caught these stupid bitches, pass the pussy free
So tell me why u sweatin' a muthafucka like me?
A young nigga tryin' to a hustle up some G's
You pussy ass playa hatin' hoes speakin' down on niggas
Jumpin' around at the shows
And your the first muthafucka to jump
To the trunk when it's time for fun
Little trick ass punk

[Verse 5:Eazy-E]
Dump dump on fools with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a g-ster, an OG-ster (who's that?)
A real playa named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk fools payin me
And broke groupies and hootchies don't faze me
I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinum and gold on the record shelf
I don't brag, but I do it like a straight up iz
Before you do a record, partner, handle your business

[Verse 6:2Pac]
And tell me what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce and bounced to a key
You gotta watch your back stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt
And now im in the rap game like the crack game
I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun
Stuck it, buckin' my muthafuckin magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Plus, shots at my adversaries
Dem niggas scary best it's time to be buried
Cause ill be buckin' in a fuckin hurry

[Verse 7:Ice Cube]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why you dont fuck with thugs
You wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck wit us (you know)
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why you dont fuck with thugs
You wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Outro: Ice Cube]
Every hood's the same {x6}
Stop trippin on me
Every hood's the sames(x6)

Head-butt ya, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, punk mothafucka

[Das]
So come on and chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self

[Ice]
Cause shotgun bullets are bad for your health

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Tricks wanna step to Cube and then they get played
Cause they bitchmade pulling out a switchblade
That's kinda trifle cause that's a knife, ho
AK-47, assault rifle
Hold the fifty
I'm nifty, pow
I gotta new style, watch out now
I hate motherfuckers claiming that they folding bank
But steady talking shit in the holding tank
First you wanna step to me
Now your ass screaming for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row
Now they running up in you slow
You're gone, used to be the Don Juan
Check that shit out
Now your name is just Twan
Switch it, snap it, rolling your eyes and neck
You better run a check

[Refrain]

[Das]
So chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity-wreck yo self
So chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self

[Ice Cube]
Cause big dicks up yo ass is bad for yo health

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate
You coulda had a V8
Instead of a tre-eight slug to the cranium
I got six and I'm aiming em
Will I shoot or keep you guessing
Cause fuck you and that shit you stressing
Bitch get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighbourhood hooker
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Giving up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop the coochie and you dead
The bitch is a Miami Hurricane head
Sprung, niggas call her Lips and Lungs
Nappy dugout get the fuck out
Cause women like you gets no respect
Bitch you better run a check

[Refrain]

[Das]
So chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self

You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow it's R-A-W, R-A-W

[Ice Cube]
You looking at the grand wizard, war lord vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches to pull up pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona ain't nothing like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothing like man on that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga I'm hot as Phoenix Arizona
I'm utah I got multiple bitches
It's a new law keep a hold of yo riches
Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant

[Hook 1]
I can say what I want to say ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Ice Cube]
I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle
Just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga y'all spit saliva
And I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this ho
If you sacred to go
I keep it gangsta and why should change that
Fuck you old motherfuckers tryin to change rap
But arent you the same cat that sat back when they brought cocaine back
I'm tryin to get me a Maybach
How you motherfuckers gonna tell me don't say that
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

[Hook 2]
So if I act like a pimp ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy headed ho ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Ice Cube]
Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin bout real life so you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain not your back use your brain not a gat
It's a party not a jack (for real)
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal (fuck them fuck them)
Don't be material a nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial
Look at my life Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
Cuz me and Allah go back like cronies
I don't got to be fake cause he is my homie

[Hook 3]
If I sell a liitle crack ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq, ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Intro]

[Ice Cube]
Oh yeah and another thing
For all ya niggas that don't do gangsta rap

Listenin with your arms crossed
Questionin Dre's credibility {What?}
Wondering if it's still in me to produce hits;
Y'all be killin me
As if I need to make mo' - I got a mansion
And six cars that are paid fo' - suck my dick! {Hello..}

Sellin tapes out of a trunk to movin this far up
Now we got the whole world starstruck
Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Motherfucker I'm Dre - I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album bitch I don't gotta do shit

Thick dames
Headhunters get brains
Big thangs
Give niggas shit-stains
The shit, man
And don't you forget, man

[Verse 1]
We be
The best of CG
Greedy
Abduct the PD
See me?
Nigga, not in 3D
Be me?
Hah, it's not easy
I'm breezy
And off the heezy
Me and my woman's like George & Wheezy
Movin' on up, niggas use to tease me
See me on top
It makes you queasy
Sick with it
Bitch, I'm Bruce Lee
Seduce me
You're nice and juicy
In the parking lot, I gots to get mine
Why the fuck we goin' in when there's bitches in line?
I spend my time watchin' bitches' behinds
Thinkin' bad shit in the back of my mind
I bump and grind with nothing less than a dime
Making movie money, you still investin' in rhymes

[Hook]
And I'm in this bitch
With a hundred dollar bill, y'all
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
I got a hundred dollar bill, y'all
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
Who got a hundred dollar bill, y'all?
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
I got a hundred dollar bill, y'all
About to spend this bitch

[Verse 2]
I'm in here
Got all you freaks lookin'
When we walk by, pussy start cookin'
Rookies start tookin'
Get your ass up, V.I.P. section's gettin' tooken
Might dance, might not
Might spend enough
Cool as hell, but still pipin' hot
Soon as I find a spot
All my people gather 'round
The nigga with the shiny watch--me
Ice Cube, motherfucker
Next to me, you a test tube motherfucker
We kinda rude, motherfucker
Get too close and bucka! Bucka! Bucka!
Don't want no problems, y'all
Fuck around, I'll pull out the problem-solv'
And watch egos dissolve
Nine times out of ten, you hoes involved

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Security pat downs
I'm a star, motherfucker
I been put' the gat down
I been put' the mack down
But check the people that I'm with
Cause they'll lay you flat down
And they'll do it right now
Yeah, you scared of the phone numbers that a nigga might dial
Club-hop, car shows, picnics
Big cars, big jewels, big dicks
Rush doors
Or gotta hop the fence
Blow this door
Gotta blow my rent
Gotta show my ass, then go repent
Gotta call in sick
And tell 'em where I went

[Hook]
[Ice Cube]
Put the whoop on 'em (Ice Cube, a.k.a. Don Mega)
Put the whoop on 'em (a.k.a. Poppa Don)
Put the whoop on 'em (a.k.a. the Big Fish)
Put the whoop on 'em (a.k.a. Brainiac)

Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (uh huh)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (Keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (all my life)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (all my life)

(verse 1)
Everyting is real on this concrete and steel
Niggas peel your cap for a happy meal
I got to deal with this ball of confusion, world of illusions
We ain't losin' playa (never), weez winnin'
Playin' every night when we sendin' paper chasing, grinin'
While you still chasin' women 'round tables no lieutenants
Use your own man grown, (hook it up)
It's Ice Cube and the family stone
Breakin' bread every night in L.A
And I pray, for one more day that's unate (check it)
It's 90 degrees no enemies in sight
Even the Don gotta fall to his knees every night

(chorus)
Can I get 24 more hours (can I get get)
Without dealin' with these killers and these cowards (can I can can)
I don't wanna loose, all I wanna do is win
I fucked up today, can I try it again?

(verse 2)
I'm lovin' every breath like a cold sip of soda
While I'm bankin' down these back streets, thanks for lookin' over
Damn sure nice to know ya, fuck a four leaf clover
And thanks for this range rover
We gets down with this underground gangsta shit
Politians and parents, always havin' a fit
Everybody wanna know "who you with?" "where you from?"
Why you lookin' at me dumb?
Here's a bullet cause you number one
Nobody knows, the fate of a platinum rap star (nobody knows)
We gotta wait until tommorow
(yeah yeah)
And I'm a nigga like you (yeah yeah)
You know I got the bar

(chorus)
Can I get 24 more hours (can I get get)
Without dealin' with these killers and these cowards (can I can can)
I don't wanna loose, all I wanna do is win
I fucked up today, can I try it again?

Put the whoop on 'em (look to Allah)
Put the whoop on 'em (pray to your God)
Put the whoop on 'em (I look to Allah)
Put the whoop on 'em (pray to your God)

(verse three)
Mister prosperity, these niggas wanna bury me
Your bitch wanna mary me
Rollin' more than a cherokee
Don't, I drive what I want, and what I ain't drivin' I don't want
Let it be known (let it be known)
Permits hit the conk in the reagal
But weez legal niggas dollars got bald eagles nigga
You can't undermine Mister Grime
You rappin' 'bout the same shit I rapped about in '89
Tryin' to be the new fiend (never), with raps complex
They love you one minute and they hate you the next
Push my lex thru the california sunshine
Look back on my life and say "damn I've done fine"
(damn) (I've done fine)
Mister Ice Cube, I'm always on the grime
(always, always)
The Don Mega Mega Don, Don Mega Mega Don

(chorus)
Can I get 24 more hours (can I get get)
Without dealin' with these killers and these cowards (can I can can)
I don't wanna loose, all I wanna do is win
I fucked up today, can I try it again?

Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (everybody)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (Keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (all my life)

(outro)
I know we can make it, I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out
I know we can make it, I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out
I know we can make it, I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out
I know we can make it, I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out

And we can work it out, we goan work it out
My niggas work it out, help us work it out
24 with an L
24 years old
And I got life in this motherfucker...

24 with an L as I bail through the concrete, shit is kinda deep
Deep, deeper than Atlantis, you got to know who the man is
L.A. better known as Pelican's Bay
The ghetto bird's got the word from the stool pigeon
A bird in the hand can't beat a chicken
There ain't no warden (shit)
Just broken glass fucking up my Jordans
Twice upon the time in the projects
I done got jacked for my Rolex
But I keep going, let it pass
Cause the swap meet got a sale on ski masks
And my little homie Kevin
Been carjacking since '87 (really doe)
L.A. is like a jail cell
And I got 24 with an L

"Get in that cell, nigger" (Repeat 8x)

Now, I made a little money, good
But I still want to live in the hood
But buying new fly shit
Is just like inviting ants to a picnic
There's just too many sets
And now I'm getting those kidnap threats
But who wanna get wet?
Cause I'll soak ya, you think I'm fat like Oprah
All I got is a little piece of nothing
And now you want to jack all the sudden
Rather have me face down on the floor
Instead of that devil you work for
Motherfucking coward
And clowning my man cause he wants to go to Howard
Now I got a strap when I bail
Through the hood, 24 with an L

"Get in that cell, nigger" (Repeat 8x)

24 years, but see I got life
Sorry Mike, it does matter if you're black or white
Cause I'm up against the black and white
They spread my legs and grab my nuts tight
Niggas keep hitting me up
And bitches try to get a drop of nut
Asking me to dick this
So they can blow up, throw up from the morning sickness
Keep my shoulder on the wall like the county
Cause you buster-ass niggas can't clown me
South of pee go, that's where we go
Deep in a Regal, Desert Eagle
Sitting on my lap like a bitch with a gat
Westside's on the map
So if you want to scrap or even drop shells
24 with an L

"Get in that cell, nigger" (Repeat 12x)
"Yeah this is a story of a famous dog
Of a dog that chases it's tail, will be dizzy"

[Ice Cube]
Met her snake ass at a barbecue bash
She had a lot of ass and a twenty dollar stash
.. of some of that superb 'erb
She said, "I got the chronic, so fuck whatcha heard"
"Ice Cube do you wanna hit this?
This shit is hype, sho' you right"
Soon as she passed me the J and a lighter
Me and this hoodrat bitch got tighter
Talkin all day on the blanket (so whassup?)
With her ass jacked up, beggin me to spank it
Lookin like a host from the Barbary coast
Nigga don't wanna get burnt like toast
Whassup wit deez nuts in ya me-outh
Aight everybody.. c'mon we out
Took her to the six dollar hole in the wall
And I like how she's holdin the balls
Gobble gobble, from the incision
Stuff that bitch and it ain't Thanksgiving
Didn't even have to fuck all night long
Take me home, damn it's on
Jumped out the cover, snatched off the rubber
Met the ho's mother - yo whassup?
Got the seven digits and I'm gone'n
That's the kinda bitch you can call at 2 n the morning

[Hook: Ice Cube]
Not just knee deep, she was O.G. deep
When she did the freak with me
Not just knee deep, she was O.G. deep
When she did the freak with me

"Yeah this is a story of a famous dog
Of a dog that chases it's tail, will be dizzy"

[Ice Cube]
I bumped this ho on the danceflo'
Where you wanna go? She said, "I don't know"
I thought I had a treat in the passenger seat
Now her ass wanna get somethin to eat
From where? She said, "Denny's I figure"
I said, "Hell no cause they don't like niggas"
Let's go to my house and order Domino's
And maybe I can get the bitch out her clothes
Got to the panties, her ass started fightin
And I'm thinkin bout my dog Mike Tyson
Took her ass home, all alone (ring ring)
Whoa-oh, there go the phone
Ay whatcha doin? "Nuthin"
Then what about screwin?
Now I'm fuckin and I'm yawnin (*YAWN*) yup
But thank God for the bitch
That'll come/cum at 2 n the morning

[Hook]

[Ice Cube]
You the kind of girl to eat a dick up raw
And drink a 40 through a straw
And I love ya, cause you're down to get dug
And your man don't know you're gettin fucked by a thug
You a woman that's true (that's right)
Doin what the fuck you wanna do
And it's cool, cause you got a purse full of rubbers
And I'm a friend of your brother's (yup)
So jump your freaky ass in your Hyundai
I got a room at the Omni
Nothin tricky, no you ain't picky
Whassup Nikki? Down for a quickie
Get your lil' dickie and your Mickey and you're straight
And gotta be at work by 8
Called you last night, you wasn't home and
Damn - it's half past 2 n the morning

[Hook]

"Yeah this is a story of a famous dog
Of a dog that chases it's tail, will be dizzy"

[Girl] Hello?
[Cube] Yo whassup this Cube, whatchu doin?
[Girl] I'm asleep
[Cube] Asleep? Get yer ass up and come over here
[Girl] Want me to drive way over there?
[Cube] Yeah, come on through and shit, y'know, it's about 2
[Girl] Alright, here I come..
Jay-Z: You ain’t got enough stamps in your passport to fuck with Young H.O
Ice Cube: Dada Dada
Jay-Z: International
Ice Cube: Papa Dock
Ice Cube: What up Jay
Jay-Z: Show young boys how to do this thing
Ice Cube: You know me, Ice Cube, I'm like a Glock nigga, I always got a hot sixteen, knamean

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
I was a young lad of seventeen
My life had yet to show its ugly face
Only a pretty façade, hey God it's me
Remember three, thousand
The one who used to pray to be a rapper
My child's in the third grade
His favorite rapper wasn't rapping till he heard me
I wasn't rapping till I heard something called Erik B
And Rakim's Paid in Full
Rapper's really gettin' paid in full
So full that the kid's dont go to school in hopes of becomin' one of us
The only requirement is your bus
Now college is lookin' slim, product is hookin' them
Before their brains fully develop they get enveloped by the the vision tele
The television tells them their vision
Now it's hard for them to make decisions with out feelin'
Uncooled, unschooled, thumb rule
Rule of thumb, can't be dumb
I wish I would've studied abroad
Well I studied a broad and she studied me back
And my course was hard
That was that, this is this, listen up
Cause all I'm saying is
If thirty's the new twenty, thirty's the new twenty for them wheels as well
They lookin' for the mic or some pills to sell
While the girls are steady graduatin'
Nigga's standin' on the corner hatin', debatin'
Well should I get the new J's or the Kobe's
And they rollin' so they wide awake for four days
Ha, I'm a G-entleman, let's get re-aquainted
I am Andre Benjamin

[Hook: Jay-Z]
I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to play the block like that
I used to carry knots like that
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy, cause I’m all grown up, ha

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Ya’ll roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day
Ya’ll young’uns chase, I’m Patron' it straight
I like South Beach but I’m in St. Tropez
Ya’ll drink Dom, but not Rose’
Hey, ya chick shop at the mall
My chick burning down Bergdorf’s
Comin' back with Birkin bags
Your chick is like, what type of purse is that
I’m from the era when niggas don’t snitch
You from the era where snitchin' is the shit
I’m afraid of the future
Ya’ll respect the one who got shot, I respect the shooter
Ya’ll go to parties to ice grill
I go to parties to party with nice girls
Young boys gotta chill, thirty’s the new twenty, nigga I’m so hot still

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Jay-Z, what can a young motherfucka tell me
About the LAPD, about the air that we breathe
Nothin', nada, zero, zilch
I want tits for fun, you want tits for milk
I'm all leather and silk, your fuckin' t-shirt look like a quilt
Playground king, climb the monkey bars that I built
Thirty's the new twenty, Phantom's the new Bentley
Nigga, dont tempt me, I'll bury you up in Tempe
And if I catch a ghost rider, tie him to a tree, gasoline like the lighter
Burn, you motherfuckin' fighta, treat you like George Bush treat Al-Qaeda
This is Guantanamo, think I'm a ho, I made the honor roll, mixed with Geronimo
Before this mic will pass, learn how to wipe your nose before you wipe your ass

[Hook]
[Intro: The D.O.C. & Fresh K]
Here's a mix to make you move, smooth enough to soothe
Slow and lower you can go inside a bassed up groove (So funk it!)
It's gotta be, ain't no need to discuss it
(Yo Doc!) I finna kick this shit, alright! (Alright, then bust it!)

[Verse 1: The D.O.C.]
Rhymes created by the Doc, most definitely down!
I could be bitten by this brother with some bad ass brown
It ain't no joke, he needs some scope
Cause his breath is (cold!) dope
As he talks I can smell it, and I'm seeing the smoke
That's the bad breath bandit, you know what's in store
Stay away cause they breath will knock you (to the floor!)
That boy is (rough!) de soda (tough!) I don't understand
Tests his breath inside his palm, and burned his hand!
He's a tucks destroyer, a Listerine killer
A cavity employer, a yuck-mouth filler
(Say man, you bullshit!) no, that's a fact Fresh K
I wish Velamints could take his breath away
But he's.. always in effect, smelling like dead vermin
Honking the bitches with his firewalls burning
Winch his witch as a curl, just as funky as well
I mean he has a little woman that can match his smell (Yes!)
He has a girlfriend, this is not pretend
She uses deodorant to spray for men
(Scratch and sniff wallpaper all over the house)
Aww shit! (Yeah boy, that's what I'm talking about)
They need ten bars of soap, three boxes of Tide
To make them presentable to go outside
Now my story is true, and my opinion candid
But that is my tale of the bad breath bandit

[Interlude:]
[The D.O.C] But you know, that ain't even half of the shit
[Fresh K:-] Man, what's up?
[The D.O.C] This bitch who stay around the way, you know her K!
[Fresh K:-] Yeah?
[The D.O.C] Y'all want to talk about her?
[Fresh K:-] Bust it!
[Dr. Rock:] Oh kick her ass, man

[Verse 2: The D.O.C.]
Let's talk about girl who's a bonafide witch!
Name is Tammy, better known as bitch!
The boys in the hood all treat her like liquor
Quick is the way they pass her around and then stick her
I'm not saying she minds, she's a first class skeezer
Always on the jock, but only if he's uhh..
Man with the money and the looks to show
(So you saying she's a witch?) yeah Tammy's a material whore
You're getting laid, if you can rock a cross-fader
You got the bank, to make the bitch who'll get paid
Tagging Tammy's a process like when you use a computer
Use her and do her like they did in the old days (Shoot her!)
A whore and she knows it, yeah the knowledge is there
So they say that she's slutty and she tell them she don't care
But y'all I'm keeping my clear, even though she is pretty
(Cause we only use Tammy for a guest to the city) right on!

[Interlude:]
[The D.O.C] But bust this, Tammy ain't the only fucked-up freak in the city
[Dr. Rock:] Well who else, man?
[The D.O.C] Aww, come on Rock, you know her now, You know her
[Dr. Rock:] Seabiscuit breath, right?
[The D.O.C] Yeah, that's her
[Dr. Rock:] Yo! Go on! Bust it homes!

[Verse 3: The D.O.C.]
You stand around the bitch and your nose turns white
You ever thought about what Big Bird's shit smells like?
Well, you take that aroma, multiply it times two
And you think about Sue (Sour-smelling Sue!)
She's a girl that has the power to kill a fresh flower
Rock smelled the whore and said (Damn that bitch is sour!)
Now, I don't judge, I mean that's not what I'm thinking
People do what they want, and I guess she like stinking
But whatever the deal, I think someone should call Guiness
Cause this is kicking a scent that fucks up K's tennis shoes
And a dress, dress it fresh to impress
She really ought to be embarrassed because that girl is a mess
If you ever see her, you'll duck and cover
She looks like your sister but smells like your brother
And since they tell me Trey, honestly phrase:
I let her know that she reminded me of the Gunsmoke days
But it ain't no (thing) if she stink she'll (sing)
But to me it's like she needs a little (Irish Spring)
You ought to know what I'm saying, I hope I made myself clear
About the three ass whores, but Troll I'm out of here

[Outro: The D.O.C.]
Yo yo yo, these three people make me so sick that I gotta go 1988 on it
Tammy your momma ain't got no legs be talking about
I ain't gonna stand for this.. Ha ha ha ha!

[Dr. Rock]
Boy you sick man! You sick! Yeah yeah

[Fresh K]
Yo man! I got a story from 1988, check it out
Sue, you got so much butter on your teeth
That when you brush your teeth you have to use a butter knife!
Ha ha ha ha!

[Dr. Rock]
Get ready for the king, here I come, now check this out
Sour smelling Sue got so much dirt in her ear
That she can grow potatoes, Ha ha ha ha!
[Hook: W.C.]
If you was born in the '80s then I'm probably your papa
Cause 9 times out of 10 I fucked your mama
9 times out of 10 she gave me drama
But, fuck that shit, I'm all about the dollar

[Ice Cube]
When you see me in the streets you can call me daddy
When you go see your mama know I hit that fatty
Back in the day, before she got ratty
I, had her ass in the back of my Caddy
And, you know I done it, I'mma keep it 100
Back when she had more ass than stomach
Back, before her looks started to plummet
She would call me everynight, beggin' she want it
I would go pick her up, then dick her up
Then stick her up, for some gas bucks
For some lunch money, and some fast food
Nigga was a pimp before a Nigga With a Attitude
And when you picture that I know you wanna get your gat
Understand atomic dog always get the cat
And if young motherfuckers ain't feelin' that
I wish she can open up, and put ya back

[Hook: W.C.] (Ice Cube)
If you was born in the '80s then I'm probably your papa
Cause 9 times out of 10 I fucked your mama
9 times out of 10 she gave me drama
But, fuck that shit, I'm all about the dollar

[W.C.]
Stomp down, bang loose for the cash figga
It's the candypaint blue '6-deuce ass lifter
Talk trash off of liquor then we kickin' yo' bitch ass up
Wipin' the grass off your back nigga
I'm one of the few of the true last y'all
Reppin' the G's and I ain't easin' off the cash y'all
Disrespectful ass groupie new nigga
Can't do shit but shut the fuck up and salute me nigga
Lench Mob, Big Swang the chrome eight arms
Been doin' this since Magic was playin' at The Forum
When Boogie Down and Scott La Rock
I was at the Raising Hell Tour fuckin' your mama in the parking lot
When LL was rockin' the bells, before Cardia and Chanelle's
I was skeetin' on the Gazelle's, in slow motion
But only if a nigga knew she was havin' you
I would have made the bitch get an abortion

[Hook: Ice Cube] (W.C.)
If you was born in the '80s then I'm probably your papa

(Big Bird: Sesame Street)
Say look at this! I was cleaning out my nest
And I found a old book of my poetry

(Ice Cube)
Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job cuz I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid by rappin' to the nation
But thats not likely, so here's my application
Pass it to the man at AT&T
Cause when I was in school I got the A.E.E
But there's no S.C. for this youngsta
I didn't have no money, so now I got to punch the
Clock, gotta slave, and be half a man
But whitey says there's no room for the African
Always knew that I would clock G's
But welcome to McDonalds may I take your order please
Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
Cuz my son doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and similac
Do I have to sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from Bush
Or Jesse Jackson, and Operation PUSH
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A Massengill what the hell crack will sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss Parker, little Joe and Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I copped me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I never get love again
But blacks are too fuckin' broke to be republican
Now I remember I used to be cool
Till I stopped fillin' out my W-2
Now senators are gettin' high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is our only room to walk
Cause we don't want a drug push
But a bird in the hand is worth more than the bush

Tell the politicians, the hustlers: live and let live (yeah)
Tell the politicians, the hustlers: live and let live (yeah)
[Keith David]
Only three short years after the 1965 Watts Riots
And the death of Malcolm X
And of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr
A boy was conceived
Whose lyrics would change the world

[Mike Epps]
Cube, please stop rapping so we can come out and get some, some more of this action man. You know when we ain't doin' no movies I'm back out here selling half ounces and quarters of that good weed in the neighborhood

Geto Boys, NWA, Schooly D in the CD changer
Reclining like The Mac
Swoop on the ave

In a seven and a half

Sitting low __ so __ to the Pro Fitted
Hustler, hustler, nigga all I know is a goal get it
Ah, ah, ah the flow is so wicked
Strip for me baby

Diamonds on my neck shining in the club like daylight

Lench Mob and gangsta shit
Money's my addiction, nigga

I'm addicted to it
Getting closer to it

[Verse 2: WC]
Making it bounce, making it bounce
Chrome frame making it bounce
I know girls like money
So I'm sticking them and dicking them now
Dick in their mouth
Putting a dick in their mouth
With a .44 on me sticking out
Windows getting foggy while
We doing it all night doggy style

Acting up run the weed up
Jag in cup, G'd up
Fucking it up my Chucks moving and doing
My new dance while I'm holding my n-eez-uts

Back down then side to side
I skip skip throw my dubs up high
Running around South Central bottom
With a bandana on my steering column

Slap boxing, dominoes
Jail breakers squatting low
Switching up and our fly S5
On mine, middle finger out the window
With one time riding
When I beat up on the concrete I be sliding
When I get up on a bitch their eyes get wide and
When they see me sagging and lagging them
Lench Mob medallion blinding them

Hood screw up your stars
And it ain't no killing ours
Still the stars whoop your ass for the cash
Yeah, I'm guilty as charged

Quarter pounds, assholes, whatever you need
Best believe don't trip
If the price is right I take a trip for flip
And get them ___ ___ by one zip for zip

Sitting on
But I'm dipping on
But I'm tipping on
Nigga getting it on
With a freak on the side of me
Sipping Patrón
Trying to whip it on
Baby licking my bone
And I'm starting to moan
Cause them lips are long
And I can see me getting my pimping on
And she tripping on
But I'm twisting on
My swap meet corduroy slippers on

Cause I'm real with this
I was built for this
Nigga muthafucking WC is still the shit
And I ain't leaving until I get another meal in this
So every time I spit it I'm killing shit
So nigga dig a ditch
Get out the wilderness
I'm hood-certified and and still with this
When will I quit?
Oh, fuck it nigga
I ain't quitting until I'm filthy rich

[Ice Cube: Hook]

I'm addicted to green that don't burn
Up in the kitchen without a concern
Muthafuckas will learn it's my turn
I'm addicted to it
Getting closer to it

Intro: Little Russ, Ice Cube

[Story-teller] Once upon a time, in the black part of the city
[Young kid] Yo G, yo G you better get out of here man, 5-0
[Door swings shut, car peels out]

[Russ] Yo Ice Cube, man
[Cube] Whassup man?
[Russ] Why you...
[Cube] Whassup?
[Russ] Yo Ice Cube man, why you always kickin the shit about the bitches
And the niggas? Why don't you kick some shit about the kids, man? The
Fuckin kids?!
[Cube] Word

Verse One: Ice Cube

Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-C-E
And let me tell ya a story or two
About a punk-ass nigga I knew
Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop
Dropped a line or two, and he had the ho
At that type of shit he's a pro
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way
To make some money, why not?
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out
Saw, her and her friends sellin sheepskins

[Little Bo Peep] Yo yo I got them sheepskins
Yo, my empty sheepskins
Yo baby, what's up with that?

Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence? Yo I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go

Interlude: Little Russ

Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit!
[Well, you know the rest]

Verse Two: Ice Cube

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
With a joint, drinkin some 8-ball
Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville
Lookin for, the wolf to kill
They're fucked up and they want revenge
Them and Humpty used to be friends
Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And Mister Rogers is gettin mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next
So Mister Rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho
Cause Cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve, givin up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em
Little Boy Blue is up front givin orders
Little did they know Cinderella was a fink
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink
A bad influence? Yo, I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go

Outro: Little Russ, Ice Cube

[Cube] Aiyyo man was that dope enough for you?
[Russ] Yeah you aight, you in the house
We outta here, seeeee-yaaaaa
[Cube] Yeah you better go home before I whoop your little bad ass

[Barney Rubble] Some bedtime story huh?
[Bugs Bunny] It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't wanna live here

[Andrew Dice Clay] Ay, good ol' Mother Goose, remember her? I fucked her
Yo nigga, let's go scoop up some of these hoes at the 'Paradise', man
Hey man, ah - I'm engaged now, man
What?
I'm engaged
To that bitch?
Aw man, don't be talkin about my woman like that
Oh, now you're gon' trip on me
Wait, wait, hold up, hold up

[ VERSE 1: King Tee ]
How you gon' go and put a ho before me?
When I'm the one that helped your broke ass on the streets
'Damn, I'm starvin, what you got to eat?
I'm short, I need a place to sleep'
Oh, but amnesia, that damn skeezer
Made you forget who was down witcha
I thought birds of a feather flock together
And don't a damn thing change but the weather
But now I know the real, I guess I had it all wrong
We used to hit the Ides until the shit was all gone
Where was she when you needed niggas off your ass
And who'd you come to get to go blast?
Not that once-a-month-bleedin, always on her knees
Suckin every Tom, Dick and Harry like a berry
I seen her with a trick at the Motel 6
And you still tryin to get that bitch Afro Fix
She got you by the nuts, playin with your wiener
Wrapped around her finger when the last time you seen her
Well, when you do, bust her lip
And if you don't, you'se a bitch
So sit down when you piss, muthafucka

(It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me) --] Deadly Threat

[ VERSE 2: Deadly Threat ]
The bitch got you gone, talkin on a phone
Tellin muthafuckas when you see me, it's on
But little do he know that she a zero
And I'm still her favorite superhero
See, I got the 411 on a ho
Just like I was tellin you before
You're just a piece of the mission
Guess where her lips been?
I told you don't be kissin, but you don't listen
[ King Tee ]
Yeah, Jaws (Jaws) Jaws the only ho I ever saw
That could suck a basketball through a straw
She don't like niggas with Nissan trucks
Unless they got the monster bumps
[ Deadly Threat]
That's right, honey, bunny's money-hungry
And she'll frame ya, she's out to getcha
Get the picture, cause the bitch'll
Take you for a long-ass ride like the hitcher
So don't be surprised if they find you in a ditch
With your guts hangin out lookin like Top Ramen
And when I see the bitch, I'm bombin
Cause she's a false tenderony, plus tossed balony
And she ain't your home, she's a ho
Don't put a ho before the homie

(Hey yo bitch, you better tell em) --] Ice Cube

[ VERSE 3: Ice Cube ]
Who's wearin the pants, who's wearin the pants, nigga?
If you ask me, I think that her dick is bigger
Than your little dick, and I'm tellin you, Jay
The bitch got you locked down like Pelican's Bay
Now I told you if you fuck with the ho
She's guaranteed to have you trippin
And me and you set-trippin
I told my muthafuckin crew
To kidnap the ho, and they came back with you
[ King Tee ]
I can't fade a nigga that's bitch-made
Kool-Aid pumpin, tell a bitch somethin
She'll have your ass cookin dinner
While she's lettin every nigga in her hood run up in her
[ Ice Cube ]
Got you runnin like Bruce Ginner, and the ho be
Pussy-whippin your ass like Toby
Now you act like you don't know me
Only a mark'll put a ho before the homies

Word - this muthafucka is different
Yeah
Tell me your secret
Not just any secret
Just answer one question for me, baby
Do you love me?
I love you
Very, very, very, very much
Baby
Can I come pick you up and take you shoppin?
Spend all my money...
I love you
I love you

Don't put a ho before the homie
[Hook]
"Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I like it..."

[Verse 1]
I'm chocolate like a bar but my name is not Roseanne
My skin has a pigment, reminiscent of a tan
I plan to grow dreads but first a nappy fro
The longer the hair, the easier to scare a foe
It grows from my head until it covers up my face
People look and stare when I walk into the place
This is just a taste from the Funky Human Being
Ain't no misbehavin', ain't no use for ravin'
Surrounded by the people who would stab me in the back
My skin is really brown even though it's labeled black
Sometimes I wear a cap, and sometimes I wear bandanas
Forbidden in L.A. but I wore one in Atlanta
I chiseled up a sculpture to complement my culture
Thoughts of silly Nubians is prone to give me ulcers
Hangin' with the brothers who are tribal in their ways
For this is how I like to spend my days, and it pays
To steal a groovy sample form the archives
Use my mental staff to eliminate apartheid
Still gather papes like my man Malcom Forbes
Ponderin' my life as I look into my orbs

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I love the shade of green like my brother Billy Bixby
I utilize a sample that I salvaged from the 60's cause I'm picky
My meal must appeal to me like Morris
Far too many fraudulent opponents in the forest
I fall into the Gap when I need to purchase clothes
Easy on the fads cause the posers always pose
I suppose they will bite, they'll try not to show it
I came very plain and then feelin' rather loaded
I ditched all the beads cause my needs seem to differ
Me and CM-P are like the Gil and the Skipper
He will use his clippers to give himself a fade
I give my fro a sheen with a smidgen of Pomade
I laid in the shade and I greeted mixel place
With a rhythm and a rhyme and he said that it's a twist
From the ordinary everyday continual assumption that RnB and rap makes a winner
Guess who's comin' through for dinner
A native-like brother with the passive little style
That most certainly will smother
Suicidal rhymes with apocalyptic tunes
I will drink a seltzer while you dabble with the booze
And giggle when I see ya liver shrivel to a prune
I'm the Funky Human Being not a monkey or a coon
Assume that the style is Funkadelic in the 90's
Del is livin' phat as I leave a foe behind me

[Hook]
"We'll shut this motherfucker DOWN!" (2X)

[B-Real]
Yo, this is B-Real from Cypress Hill
Kickin it with the motherfuckin Lench Mob
Showin yo' ass, that you ain't got no class

[J-Dee]
Everytime I see you (whassup) you always on a mission
You're up too early in the mornin to go fishin
Wishin you can catch you somebody slippin
So you can sell his shit, and go get you a hit
When you need to be at home with your god damn children
That's why your landlord wants you out the buildin
Cause you haven't paid your rent in six months
You got rats and roaches and your kids've got the mumps
Cause you like to spend your checks on bumps
I saw your little boys eatin oatmeal lumps
My oh my, I wish you was my father
Cause I'd take your ass out and wouldn't even bother
Tellin them I did it - yeah fool I did it
Pops kept smokin so I had to end that bullshit
This ain't a story bout a kid from a broken home
It's all about a son, who father that was gone
So if you're out there and you're lookin for a blast
I'mma blast cause you ain't got no class

Chorus: B-Real

Ain't got no class.. (Stucky Mack)
Ain't got no class.. (Stuck-y-Mack)
Ain't got no class.. (Stucky Mack)
Ain't got no class.. (Stuck-y-Mack)

[J-Dee]
In my neighborhood, there's a girl named Sonya
For a hit and some (??) you're guaranteed to bone her
The funky-ass aroma, comin from her crouch
I see why +Mama Said Knock You Out+
Now this is a shame, to seen a girl look this way
I been everywhere, ain't it only in, L.A
Not only do I see 'em, I always try to greet 'em
I say do you have some kids? (Hell yeah!) Feed 'em
Cause I remember one thing that Mom Duke told me
"Never let a motherfuckin kid be, hongry"
Went into my pockets, and got a twenty dollar bill
I said, "Go buy your motherfuckin kids a Happy Meal"
And followed her to Mickey D's and made sure she bought the shit
And if she wouldn'ta man I swear to God I woulda hurt the bitch
Threw her ass in the ditch where the crackhead at
Cause the bitch, ain't got no class

Chorus: B-Real

Ain't got no class.. (Stucky Mack)
Ain't got no class.. (Stuck-y-Mack)
Ain't got no class.. (Stucky Mack)
No the bitch ain't got no class (Stucky-fuckin-Mack)

[J-Dee talking over Hook]
It's a damn shame
Smoked up her kid's money
Boy can't even eat

[J-Dee]
You come home fucked up, with the basshead calls
Kids got no lunch money cause you smoked it all up
You get your first period, stomach just growlin
Look outside, the teacher think that it's thunderin
But it's not thunder it's your little boy's tummy
Now don't it make you feel like a motherfuckin dummy?
He can't feed hisself, and his moms can't either
Basehead parents; man we don't really need 'em
Especially if they smokin and the home is broken
At nutrition time, my niggas be like jokin
Sayin that I'm bummy, I'm thinkin bout my tummy
I'm hungry as FUCK and moms smoked up our bucks
Now I gotta do her with a slug (Stucky Mack)
Now I gotta do her like a thug (buck buck buck!)
Now I gotta go, shoot up the drug spots
Mr. Police, could you please take my mug shot
Three hots in the cot for my ass
Cause my moms, ain't got no class

Chorus: B-Real

Ain't got no class.. (Stucky Mack)
Ain't got no class.. (Stuck-y-Mack)
Ain't got no class.. (Stucky Mack)
No moms ain't got no class
Ain't got no class.. (Stucky Mack)
Ain't got no class.. (Stucky-fuckin-Mack)
Ain't got no class.. (Stucky Mack)
No moms ain't got no class

[B-Real]
Ain't that right J-Dee?
She need to get on with her sorry ass
Beitch!

"We'll shut this motherfucker DOWN!" (4X)
[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Now take my bitch, she won't complain about shit
Because she's my ho, she don't belong to a trick
So when you fuck her, and give her all your cash
I get paid, or put my foot in your ass
I won't marry the bitch, and give her half
I get more head, and then I laugh at the one bitch shit
I got a gang of hoes, I get, freak, ass, lick, these balls and toes

[Ice Cube]
Now stupid little bitches get tossed
If they don't realize I'm the motherfucking boss
Come on down and get your ass pinched
And if you talk shit get your ass lynched
Cause I'm the B the I the T the C the H
The K the I the L the L the A
Ice Cube, a nigga that's bigga than a nut
Cause a bitch is a bitch is a ho is a slut

[Hook: Too $hort]
You say how can I call a women a bitch
It ain't nothing but a word like shit
Ain't no slipping in my motherfucking pimping
And all bitches ain't women
You come home and get smooth cussed out
You gotta a bitch with a foul-ass mouth
Scared to tripp her with a left hook
You'z a bitch in my book, bitch

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
My nigga Jinx made the mix
So punk-ass motherfucking bitches get the 86
I keep hoes on five, cause I'm fucking more pussy than the law allow
With my boy Too $hort, see he quick to grab a bitch by the throat
And slam her ass, cram her ass with a fat dick, cause she's a trick bitch

[Too $hort]
I like fat bitches, and I like 'em slim
I'll take a fat bitch, and stick my dick right in
Her big fat ass, she'll make me cum again
I'm mack daddy bitch, fuck her friend
I saw your homegirl, she said whats up with us
I said nothing, fucked her on a tour bus
She got it good too, dicked down on the floor
The bitch was fine, but the pussy ain't good as yours

[Ice Cube]
She a straggler, struggler, straight salome smuggler
Everytime I see the bitch, she's looking uglier
And if you got a trick-ass on your left, sitting there with dick on her breath
Last night she sucked my dick, now she's kissing little man
Won't he suck my dick and let's cut out the middle man
And if you have never heard of me, you's a bitch
It ain't but a word to me

[Hook]
I'll stop calling ya, beeyotch

[Too $hort]
Man Fuck these hoes man, ya know
Nappy ass bitch ass tramp ass slutty ass ho

Female voice:
I'll stop calling ya, Beyotch(echo)

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
I go hard on a bitch, fuck respect for ya men
I get my way with a bitch, when I act like a pimp
Always carrying bank, but I fooled the bitch
Cause all she ever got was to drool on my dick
Ice Cube will slap a ho for the fuck of it
Just like me and that's some real shit
Bitch got bold with her loud ass mouth
Tough ass bitch got knocked out
You know a bitch ain't nothing but a word to me
Some of you punks are just scared to see
If you could call that bitch a bitch you would
And if you can't, you probably should
I'm spitting game to you mark ass lames
On how how to get a bitch and treat the bitch like shit
You can't buy love, all pimps know that
It's all about the way old Short Dogg macks
Don't hold the bitch hand or walk side by side
Go first class everytime you fly
She'll go Greyhound, and just meet you there
I'm just an ice cold hard ass Oakland player
You want to tongue kiss bitch, it figures
I introduce you to my homeboy Richard
Also known by his nickname Dick, now let's tongue kiss bitch

[Ice Cube]
I like big butts, so let it be known to the public
I bust a rap or two and the bitches love it
I'm only out for one thing so hate me, I ain't the one so don't try to fade me
I don't wear too much gold cause it's tacky
I bust a Raider hat t-shirt and khakis
See a lot of hoes in freaky clothes everyday
So I talk to 'em in any ol can I way
See a bitch need a nigga to coach 'em
So I grab my dick and smoothly approach 'em
I say hi, and I'm really kind of pitched
If they ignore me then I say yo freak bitch
Give up the number hardly, we'll have a slumber party
You see I'll fuck you to death and then I'll dump the body
Cause I'm a nigga that's bigger than crew or a gang
And when it comes to bitches I'm out for only one thang
Yo, bitch ain't nothing but a word to me, $hort
Down at the best spot
Its me and JD and they sellin more birds than a pet shop.
The spot's hot and everybody nervous
That's when the blue car served us
Oh why did fools have to let loose?
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce.
Big Tom had to push us
13 niggas runnin straight to the bushes
For they gats so they could draw down
But why a motherfucker like me have to fall down?
Not knowin' why I dropped out
Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out
So now I gotta jet
Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin' wet
Tryin to see if we got 'em
Looked down and my sweatshirt's red at the bottom.
Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out

Woke up in the back of a trey
On my way, to MLK;
That's the county hospital, jack
Where niggas die over a little scratch.
Sittin' in the trauma center
In my back is where the bullet entered
"Yo, nurse, I'm gettin kind of warm!"
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin form
Coughin up blood on my hands and knees
Then I heard, "Freeze, nigger! Don't move!"
Yo, I didn't do a thing
Don't wanna go out like my man Rodney King
Still got gaffled
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel
Now I'm handcuffed
Being asked information on my gang affiliation
"I don't bang, I write the good rhymes
And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime."

I need to see a MD
And ya'll mothafuckers giving me the third degree?
Look at the waiting room
Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room
Nobody gettin help
Since we poor
The hospital'd move slow
Now I'm layed out
People steppin' over me to get closer to the TV
Just like a piece of dog shit
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet?
One hour done passed
Done watched two episodes of M*A*S*H,
And when I'm almost through
They call my name and put me in ICU.
Halfway dead
No respect and handcuffed to the bed
Now the drama starts
Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart.
Then I begin the ass kissin
Just to get looked at by a overworked physician
Had the chills, but my temperature's a hundred-and-three
Only got a band-aid and an IV
That's when I start cussin
Police steady askin me who did the bustin

Why, oh why, can't I get help?
Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self
Too many black bodies the hospital housin
So at 10 P.M. I was Audi 5000.
[Intro]

[Mack 10 talking]
Goddamn! New York City!
Skyscrapers and everything!

[Ice Cube]
Back in the day, we used to respect y'all niggas
We used to be down with y'all niggas
All you have for the West Coast, is criticism and disrespect
So I say to you and your city
Y'all niggas will never get our respect again
Westside nigga (Keeping it real)
Yeah! (Keeping it real)

[All]
WESTSIIIIIDE!
Is Brooklyn in the house?!? (Check it out)

Staten Island in the house?!? (Woop woop)
The West Coast is in the house sayin
Why you talkin loud?!?
What you talkin bout?!?

[Ice Cube]
Fuck all the critics in the N-Y-C
Who wants to rock the microphone after me?
Think of who you are and who you be
My energy holds it down like the NFC
I'm going thorough thru your borough
Wit my Raider jacket and my jheri curl, gangstas rule the world
On the west, nevertheless, W-S
We got the bomb and you niggas got the stress

[Mack 10]
You couldn't have said it no better homeboy
With my automatic toy, I kill and destroy
These buster ass critics from the N-Y-C
Don't they know that I be from the I-N-G
My peeps play for keeps, deep crews pay dues
By murder ones and twos, rip riders and Damus
Choose to stay gangsta, you never ever ran us
We bustin clips like bananas, sportin colored bandanas

[WC}
It's the Mister hoodsta, cap peeler
Dusty ass New York critic killer
Dumping and pumping the motherfuckin lead in their chest
Because ain't none of them niggas ever gave it up for the West
So now it's on and, the gauge in my pants got me limpin
Fuck U-N-I-T-Y, I'm coast trippin
Saggin as a Pelle, smashin tape recorders
This is 187 on a New York reporter

"New York, New York"
"New York, New York"
"New York, New York"
"New York, New York"

[Ice Cube]
Fuck all the critics in the N-Y-C
Tryin to get an East hip-hop monopoly
But I've been writing gangsta shit since '83
When y'all was still scared to use profanity
Now everybody wanna run and go and get triggers
And blame it on these West Coast seven-figure niggas
Just because we made it real niggas got to deal
I hope blood ain't got to spill, I kill

[Mack 10]
It's like the battle of the sexes
You wanna treat us like bitches cos we're platinum when we flex this
With mic in hand, fans in the stands
We make a mill-ion from California to Japan, bitch
Went overseas, seen D's how we done it
88's to 100's to let me know who really run it
This West Coast gangsta shit got it crackin, or we jackin
Packin nina's and sellin out arenas, niggas

[WC]
You make me wanna holler, throw up both my Dubs
And roll these niggas up, I got to beat em
When I see me, T-Roller cut off his scrotum
Leave em bleedin in particles for them biases articles
I'm mashin and blastin so get the casket
I bet you after this I get a fuckin hip-hop classic
I'm banning you niggas from the scene
Kickin over newstands, pouring gasoline on your magazines

[Ice Cube]
To the West my niggas, to the West
To the West my niggas, to the West
To the West my niggas, to the West
We the best my niggas don't stress

Fuck all the critics in the N-Y-C
And your articles tryin to rate my LP
Fuck your backpacks and your wack ass raps
Sayin we ain't real because we make snaps
Sellin six-fos to the Japs, what you lookin at?
With your Brooklyn hat and your pen and pad, nigga
I got a pocket full of green busting at the seams
Fuck your baggy jeans, fuck your magazines

[Mack 10]
Hey hey hey, what's happenin round tre?
It's still N-Y critic K on mines all motherfuckin day
It's a trip the script flipped from when you niggas was bossin
Got to flossin, fell off, and got the nail in the coffin
Who wanna regret, fuckin with my set
I be a 24-year street Westside Connect vet
You niggas better watch how you greet us when you meet us
We packin heaters and the only way you beat us is cheat us

[WC]
AIIIIYO!!! Nigga fuck that shit
I gotta, kill it kill it, fuck a New York critic
He write about how I lived it, did it, plus I'm still with it
Puttin it down on all these DJs, hate, fakin and flakin
Never once played my record on their radio station
No love for a New York critic or disc jock
Matter of fact I'm blamin all y'all for fuckin up hip-hop

[All]

What about Queens in the house?!? (WESTSIIIIIIIDE!!!)

WESTSIIIIDE!!!
Ice Cube with The Lench Mob, I got it goin on
A nigga that's livin in the city of the criminal zone
One-time can't keep the law in order
Cos everybody's goin crazy for a quarter
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area
The way I'm talkin I'm scarin ya
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
Cos if you is or you ain't a gangbanger
Keep one in the chamber
Cos you'll get them thangs put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin did my head grow?
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay
I keep my 9 anyway
For the day one of my homies wanna squab
I'm still rollin wit The Lench Mob

(AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted)

Back in the day I did my share of dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
To bust a cap cos it's all about survival of the fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I reap all your fat shit, jack
Back to the criminals set
I leave clue after clue but they can't catch me yet
Cos I'm slick as slippery
They can't get wit me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad, mad cos I'm the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted

Aiyo, here's what the poster read:
'Ice Cube is wanted dead'
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and si-reens
When I fiend first they yo' rings, now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
It's the American way
Cos I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Ice Cube - a motherfuckin klepto
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap
You know I'mma beat the wack
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
So get the Kryptonite cos I'm a rip tonight
Cos I'm scarin ya, wanted by America

(Aiyo Cube man, they on your ass)

Word, but who the fuck is Herb?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let em see a nigga invasion
Point blank on a caucasian
Cocked the hammer didn't crack no smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewellry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin in the den, yo it couldn't be
(Whattup G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Packed my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
Cos the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbin the white folks
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope
I said it before and I'll still taught it
Every motherfucker with a colour is most wanted
