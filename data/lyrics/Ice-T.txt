[Verse 1]
6 in the morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make a escape
Don't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music, but happy cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told 'em bout my morning cold bugged' em out
Shot a little dice til my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to her, ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]
-Word-

[Verse 3]
Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a louie interior
Solid gold the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin' off like a high school bell
Looked in the mirror, what did we see
Fucking blue lights: L.A.P.D
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade
Threw us in the county high power block, no freaks to see no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the shit must fly, squabbled this sucker shanked em in the eye
But just living in the county is a serious task
Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track
Told me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough
Be bop's a pimp, my old freaks a ho
The batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said, man you out early, we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I bought a Benz with the money the rest went to clothes
Went to the strip started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
I didn't want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew, some punks got loud
Shot gun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit, two punks died
All causalities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 6]
Swat team leader yelled, hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my .44
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the back door like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn, goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 7]
The rollers gave chase at a serious speed, one more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di
Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew, we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun
And all I was thinking was, murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew, we're gone into the night
Broke to my old lady's who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

[Verse 8]
We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie, a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus as I watched TV
A technician with a mission that's what she was
If there had been a crowd she would of got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
The she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop as I was screaming for more
After she waxed by body she let me crash
She knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 9]
Up the next morning, feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my A.M.G
Ho's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red Some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said he's jumping bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

[Verse 10]
Fell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C
Called up my posse when I got there, hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devil's nest the rest we passed, back doored the Palladium just for class
About 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce, we never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shoot-out jumped off mine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask

[Hook]
[Intro: Ice-T]
Yo, check this out
This Ice-T, Body Count

[Hook]

Get out my face motherfucker, unless you wanna see what's up
(Turn down for what?)

[Verse 1]
Bartender just hit me with a double
Drink tequila so you know we're in trouble
Showing up to every party tipsy
Living life like a stunna can you blame me?
Now that's my kind of party
So light 'em up, up, up
Cause tonight we just don't give a fuck

You know we're always up to no good
This is rockstar shit motherfucker, you wish you could
You know we're always up to no good
Fire up that loud, another round of shots

[Hook + Ice-T]

[Verse 2]
You can find me chilling at the bottom of a cold drink
Blasting Pantera, taking OE
Sipping on that coldcock whiskey
You're fucking right, we're fucking crazy
Now that's my kind of party
So light 'em up cause tonight we just don't give a fuck

[Ice-T]
Swear to god, this security guard looks at me one more time
I'm punching him in the face
Yo cuz, why you bumping all up into me nigga
You drunker than me, what's happenin'?
Yo bitch, you ain't damaged your bottles bitch

Put the bottle down, this Upon a Burning Body
Bitch, you trying to get cooked?

This is rockstar shit motherfucker, you wish you could
Turn down for what?
Yo check this out
Turn down for what?

Turn down for what?
Check this out, this Upon a Burning Body, bitch
Yo Ease let's do this...

I am a nightmare walking, psychopath talking
King of my jungle just a gangster stalking
Living life like a firecracker quick is my fuse
Then dead as a deathpack the colors I choose
Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter
Sucker die for your life when my shotgun scatters
We gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply

You see they hit us then we hit them
Then we hit them and they hit us, man
It's like a war, ya know what I'm sayin'
People dont even understand
They don't even know what they dealing with
You wanna get rid of the gangs it's gonna take a lotta work
But people don't understand the size of this
This is no joke man, this is real

You don't know me, fool
You disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistance
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors, my honour, my colors, my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me, what have I got
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homie got jacked
My mother's on crack
My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks
Madness insanity live in profanity
Then some punk claimin' they understandin' me
Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my sect, guess my religion

Yo my brother was a gang banger
And all my homeboys bang
I don't know why I do it man, I just do it
I never had much of nuffin man
Look at you man, you've got everything going for yourself
And I ain't got nuffin man, I've got nuffin
I'm living in the ghetto man
Just look at me man, look at me

My pants are saggin braided hair
Suckers stare but I don't care
My game ain't knowelgde my game's fear
I've no remorse so squares beware

But my true mission is just revenge
You ain't in my sect, you ain't my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homocides my favorite venge

Listen to me man
No matter whatcha do don't ever join a gang
You don't wanna be in it man
You're just gonna end up in a mix of dead freinds and time in jail I
Know, if
I had a chance like you
I would never be in a gang man
But I didn't have a chance
You know I wish I did

I'll just walk like a giant police defiant
You'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't
My gangs my family its all that I have
I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph

You don't like it, so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
Phsyco-analize tried diognising me wise
It was a joke brother the brutally died

But it was mine, so let me define
My territory don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy
Cause the bitch dont thank me
You can be read like a punk
It wouldn'ta made me
Cause my colors death
Thou we all want peace
But our war won't end
They'll always see

See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me man
But I don't wanna be down with this situation man
But I'm in here, if I had something betta to do I think I'd do it but
Right
Now I'm just down here boye
I'm trying to get money cause I'm smart
I'm gunna get paid while I'm out here
I'm gunna get that paper, ya know what I'm saying
If I had a chance like you
Maybe I would be in school
But I'm not, I'm out here living day to day surviving
And I'm willing to die for my colors

Yo'll please stop, cause I want ya all to live
This is Ice-T, Peace...
Got any last words
Yeah I've got some last words
Ice Cube's in the muthafuckin' house
The nigga you love to hate

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Here comes the nigga with the ruff, the terror
The paranoid, gots to get the boy
Get your steel cause I feel like a headbanger
Yeah I got a gang of shits, styles guns
My Uzi weighs a motherfucking ton
Bucking down one, bucking down two
Bucking down your crew, muthafuck you
Pigs were blue, I wear black, nothing but black
Cause Goddamn it's a brand new payback
Fuck Pat Sajak, never did nothing for a nigga
On the trigger the zigga the zag the nickel the bag
The nigga the sag the forty four mag got you running like a fag
So, keep your muthafucking jokes
Cuz, I'm that nigga with a fresh pair of locs
No yokes but smokes
Crakers and them dirty mackers friends aren't jackers
Get yah for your drawers, young niggas out to kill for cars

[Hook]
Ice-T in the motherfucking house
Black Playa

[Verse 2: Ice T]
O- to the muthafuckin G, I break crazy
A lot of niggas hate me but they can't fade me
Stop me, clock me, cops wanna Glock me
But the punk motherfucking pigs can't stop me
UHH am I a G, I got proof
Banged in my youth, keep niggas on the roof
With a scope, dough, Cube keep the rope 2Pac string a nigga up
[?Hit the mob dope?]
So whats up Punk
You want what I got, step to me wrong fuck around and get shot
Your moms crying fuck her bust her
Bitch start screaming to me and I'll dust her
Pops got the LP phat, track on hit
Laid by the mutha fuckin' Bobcat
Ninety three suckas want me to go out
Throw the ho out, bitch muthafucker I'm rich

[Hook]
2Pac's in the muthafucking house
Nigga I'm loc'd, 2pac's gonna get'cha motherfuckers
Got any last words

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now they're after me, why cause a nigga's Black, sit back
Ain't afraid to pull a trigger back
Let em come step to a real muthafucker
(Boom Boom) Mama ain't raised no suckers
Dan Quayle, don't you know you need to get your ass kicked
Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets
Muthafucker Rednecks all the same
Fear a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained
That's why we burn shit and wreck
Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dread, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga, but they can't take us alll
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place (ha ha ha)
Keeping the smile off their white faces
I ain't racist but lets trade places
Trace the hate 'n face it
One nigga teach two niggas
Three teach four niggas
And them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last words
[Intro]
Yo what's up man, I need to get high man
I need to get hold of some big time dope man
You know where I can get a ki?

I know where you can get an LP

LP, man? Have you went crazy man?
I'm talking about some dope man
I need to get high right now man
Why don't you hook me up with a 5-O?

I can hook you up with a 12 inch

12 inch? Man have you went crazy?
You don't even know what time it is
Out here on the streets and don't know what time it is
Man youse a fool

Yo homeboy you a fool
You don't know what time it is
Out here, messing up your mind
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is Ice-T talkin' to you boy
I'mma tell you what time it is

[Verse 1]
Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record's revolvin'
Evil's the mixer, I'm the rap trixister
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, coolin', yo colder than ever
Punk-Executioner E, pull the lever
Rotate the wax then cut an' axe the tracks
Push up the levels till the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
I'm sellin' dope in each and every record store
I'm the kingpin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high? Let the record play

[Bridge]
Aww man, I like this dope here man
It's feelin' alright boy
What you say your name was man?

[Hook]
I'm your momma
I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your brother when you need
A true player to emcee
You know me, a true friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
MC Ice-T
I'm your pusher

[Verse 2]
I know you're lovin' this drugs as it's comin' out your speaker
Bass thru the bottons, highs thru the tweeters
But this base you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep your hype
Groovin' like I see you doin'
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high, why? .. That ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
From sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T

[Bridge]
Aww man, you ain't ever lie man
This dope's alright man
I gotta get back with you man
Let me get your number man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'll bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up
You want it? ... I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot 'em up
Cops found 'em in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean'em up with no Ivory soap
I leave 'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope
Because you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give, makes me invincible

[Bridge]
Aww Mr. Dopeman
I'm lovin' you man
You got it goin' on man
What else you got?

I got some of that Kool Moe Dee
Aww yeah man, I want some of that

Got some Doug E. Fresh
Aww yeah gimme an ounce of that
I want that all night long

I got some Eric B. & Rakim
Aww that is some real dope right there

I got some LL Cool J
Nah, nah man, I don't want none of that
You can keep that man

I got some Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One
Aww now you're talkin' man, come on

Public Enemy
Yeah don't stop, don't stop

Biz Markie
Makin' music with yo mouth Biz
I love it

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The cops don't know what to do, because my dope breaks through
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut, then removes it
IZ checks for purity, then approves it
And then you get it, try it and like it
And if it ain't potent, we remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Because if you're doin' crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope, come look in my trunk
The dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit
So get real fool, and try some real hit

[Bridge]
Word up my brother
You got me high as a kite
I feel good tonight
Ice-T, you alright

[Hook]

I'm your pusher
[Hook 2x]
"You gotta make the money first"
"Then when you get the money, you get the power"
"Then when you get the power, Then you get the woman"

[Ice-T]
The problem is you broke, You ain't got no car or job
You slow with your hustle, You dress like a slob
Ladies ain't looking for no brothers like this
They want the dub-twisting ballers with the ice on their wrist
You gotta get your cash right to get in the game
Might have to pull a pistol, Flip some caine
Get out in them streets and hustle hard in the rain
Take your come up and reinvest to the game
"You gotta make the money first"
You need a lot to go far
What you think is rich, I just spent on a car
What you think is paid, I just blew on a watch
What you think is wealthy, I just dropped on a yacht
Flip the street cash and try to pick some stocks
Kick back in your pad and watch it roll like crops
But it really ain't that easy, Or we all would be rich
One mistake, You're broke, The come up's a bitch
Make the right moves and forget about sleep
Concentrate on the paper chase, Join the elite
Few dun got mad cash and money to spend
Money to straight blow and money to lend
And only then, You made it past stage one, My friend

[Hook 2x]

[Ice-T]
Now you got the money and the cash flow thick
But you really ain't nothing but a richer trick
Just because you're paid, you can still get thick
By your low life homies or skanless bitch
You gotta move it around, put it in the right hands
Maybe a judge, Make a PA your friend
Understand what really moves the world
Recognize what really moves these girls
Juice is more important than cash for real
Money you spend, But true power you feel
It ain't that easy to reach
Respect is about the hardest damn thing in the streets to get
Make your moves correct, Watch your crew
Watch your back, They watching you
Anybody round you has gotta be true
Or you never make it past stage two
Listen, when you get the real true power, You know
People will feel you, Wherever you go
And when you really max this game
You'll never have to say your name

[Hook]

[Ice-T]
Now you got the power, It's on, My friend
Cuz the one thing women love is powerful men
The one thing women hate are brothers that bend
They act like they like 'em, But they only pretend
They wanna be with that man in the V.I
They don't wanna stand in line
You outta your mind?
That other player's got cash, But no juice
Cuz the powerful men get to choose
From a multitude of women that be steppin in crews
Willing to do much more than before
Give you quick brains, It's insane
Just what the woman'll do just for you
Cuz if you got the power, Then they gets it too
If you rollin benz, Then they rollin too
If you livin phat, Then they ballin too
That sounds stupid to you, Not to me
They winning one move when it takes us three
Cars, Big houses, And shopping sprees
While most of us see the penitentiary

[Hook 2x]
[Havoc the Mouthpiece]

Dictations how I write my raps
Cold maxin' with two freaks upon my lap

Whole days of my life are spent inside my bed
Just maxin' an' relaxin' like I'm at club med
Ya say you like this record,you think it's fun?
Party people get stupid we just begun!!!

(break)

You're get,get,gettin' real stupid
As the beat hits your body get ill!!!

Go on homeboy and grab her.....
Tape recorder turn up the bass
No time to waste just dog the place
R-R-R-Rocket like a missile in space
Evil E keeps his 1200s in an anvil case
We fly T.W.A.,Pan Am,P.S.A
To places close to home,far away
L.A.,New York,Detroit,Miami
If I see a girl and like her then I let her see my....
Jam rockin's how I got my fame,Ice capital T
Evil E's his name
If you can't see who's rockin' you must be blind
You better clean your gazelles with some 409!!!

Go Ice get busy (x2)
Go Evil Get busy (X2)

Turn up your stereo,equalize treble
Bass be kickin' stupid hard as metal
On the mic tonight that's right your rhyme opponent
M.C. Ice T just microphonin'
33 and 1/3 revolutions per minute
This record is def because my heart is in it
Vocals laid by the Ice,tempos tight and precise
Special effects will be created by an editor's splice
The funk is in it,ya dig it so stop that frontin'
Bust a move to my groove work your body do somethin'
No way in the world that you can deny my method
As my record rotates,my words get more impressive
I'm an M.C., Evil's my Dj on Sire Records not M.C.A
C.B.S.,Capitol,cause they move too slow
Now Sire/Warner Bros. clocks all the dough
As the record revolves money's gettin' made
A.S.C.A.P. pays me every time it's played
I chill in def leathers pure silks and suede
And the gold around my neck will never fade
Down with my Syndicate organized rhyme
Kickin' def tempos that I design
And if you can't hear'em thats such a crime
You better wash your dirty ears with some 409

I always rhyme elite,stay on beat
Travel in a posse when I walk the street
Loved to say my rhymes when I used to max
Now I don't speak much,I save my words for wax
I just wanna make a little point in this song
With a little nonsense we can all get along and on and on
Till the break'a break of dawn
This jam will never play out because the grooves too strong
Guys grab a girl,girls grab a guy
If a guy wants a guy,please take it outside
I wanna make ya enjoy yourself
On the mic tonight Ice T!!Who else?
Evil's on the cuts,Henry Gee's shot gun
Islam's my producer,Bambattas son
Bronx Style Bob's cold watchin' my back
Melle Mel's just layin' for some punks to act wack
Grandmaster Caz and Donald D ,Scott La Rock
Red Alert,Chuck Chill Out
If you're down with my crew you will be fine
But if you ill we'll get dirty-bring your 409!!

(BREAK)

409......
[Verse 1]
6 in the morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make a escape
Don't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music, but happy cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told 'em bout my morning cold bugged' em out
Shot a little dice til my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to her, ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]
-Word-

[Verse 3]
Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a louie interior
Solid gold the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin' off like a high school bell
Looked in the mirror, what did we see
Fucking blue lights: L.A.P.D
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade
Threw us in the county high power block, no freaks to see no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the shit must fly, squabbled this sucker shanked em in the eye
But just living in the county is a serious task
Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track
Told me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough
Be bop's a pimp, my old freaks a ho
The batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said, man you out early, we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I bought a Benz with the money the rest went to clothes
Went to the strip started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
I didn't want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew, some punks got loud
Shot gun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit, two punks died
All causalities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 6]
Swat team leader yelled, hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my .44
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the back door like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn, goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 7]
The rollers gave chase at a serious speed, one more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di
Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew, we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun
And all I was thinking was, murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew, we're gone into the night
Broke to my old lady's who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

[Verse 8]
We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie, a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus as I watched TV
A technician with a mission that's what she was
If there had been a crowd she would of got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
The she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop as I was screaming for more
After she waxed by body she let me crash
She knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 9]
Up the next morning, feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my A.M.G
Ho's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red Some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said he's jumping bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

[Verse 10]
Fell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C
Called up my posse when I got there, hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devil's nest the rest we passed, back doored the Palladium just for class
About 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce, we never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shoot-out jumped off mine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask

[Hook]
Yeah, last year a lot of motherfuckers asked me
Why I didn't do no old sex nasty shit
But this year I went down to Miami and got my nigga from 2 Live
Brother Marquis in the house! (Yeah I'm the motherfuckin nigga)
Yeah, we gonna answer the question about girl problems
All these niggas is havin girl problem, Marq
(Huh, tell them man, tell them how it is)
Lemme tell you what time is it..

I got a ho from the East, got a ho from the West
Got a ho that likes to jack it off and rub it in her chest
I got a ho from the North, a ho from the South
A ho that likes to suck it long and hold it in her mouth
I got a bitch with hair, a bitch with none
A bitch with a knife, a bitch with a gun
A bitch with a ass big as a TV set
And there's a bitch over there; hey, the one I'm gonna get
But yo but maybe not, she might not like me though
No sweat to a vet; I'll slam her sister, though
Word, Ice in the whole damn herd
I fuck 'em all and leave 'em on the curve
I got a bitch with a mink, who rocks a fat gold link
Who likes to fuck me with her ass up on the kitchen sink
Got a bitch with tits, a bitch with ass
A bitch with none, but hey, I'd give her a pass
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit it

[Hook]

Nah, a bitch ain't one

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
I got a bitch that's old, a bitch that's new
A bitch who love velvet in the colors blue
I got a bitch who's fat, a bitch who's built
A bitch who all her titties give out powdered milk
I got a bitch who's funny, a bitch who ain't
A bitch who can sing, a bitch who cain't
A bitch who loves fucking on a airplane..
I even got a bitch off Soul Train
I got a bitch who rolls a rag-top Benz
Long ends
I got a bitch who's broke as a bum
But she's the most fun
I got a bitch who play piano, a bitch who don't
A bitch who dances naked, a bitch who won't
A bitch who's short, a bitch who's tall
A bitch who burns my pager with priority calls
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me

[Hook]

Yo Marquis - you from Miami man why don't you show these motherfuckers all the over the world
The 2 Live style of how the bitches treat a mothafuckin' fly nigga like you

[Verse 3: Brother Marquis]
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one of them
I don't trip on hoes, cause I don't need none of them
Pussy's the temptation, dick's the persuasion
All hoes suck cock nigga how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em, I just freak on 'em
Stick dick in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The nigga the one-nighter, the bitch exciter
I only love my hoes when I'm going up inside her
Problem number one is getting money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nothing cause I ain't offering
I go hard on my bitches, cause I'm never never softening
Putting the demand on 'em, fuck 'em and scram on 'em
The "wham, bam, thank you ma'am" game is ran on 'em
So fuck how you feel, your fucking cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Getting pussy's just another expense
If pussy pays the bills then dick pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to cum
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one

[Hook]

[Ice-T]
Ha! Yo Marquis my motherfucker you got problems man?
(A bitch ain't one) Aww shit!
Now let me tell you how to do this shit

[M] I got a bitch that loves to G
[I] She'll fuck you right after she fucks me
[M] I got a bitch who loves both
[I] I got a bitch who loves handcuffs and ropes
[I] I got a bitch that's fast, a bitch that's slow
[M] A bitch that's a virgin and a bitch that's a ho
[I] A bitch that lies
[M] A bitch that's true
[I] A bitch who's a man because they're "Bitches 2"
[I] I got a bitch that's cool
[M] A bitch that's hot

[Ice-T]

And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you having girl problems, I feel bad for you son

No, a bitch ain't one

[Hook]

Huh, you know a bitch ain't one

[Brother Marquis]

[Ice-T]
Youknahmsayin? A bitch ain't one

[Brother Marquis]
All them motherfuckers can kiss my mothafuckin' ass.. for real

[Ice-T]
Really, niggas worrying about bitches
They better, they better find something else to worry about
[Fades out]
[Ice-T]
Ban me? Try it
You might cause a riot
What the radio won't play, the underground will supply it
I'm a MC pirate, this loud not quiet
Radical as they make, they make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise, some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
Cops hate kids and kids hate cops
Cops kill kids with warning shots
What is crime and what is not?
What is justice? I think I forgot
Squeeze The Trigger, 1986
Ain't a damn thing changed, motherfucker!
[Intro]
This goes out to all you ladies out there
A lot of you won't grow up to be lawyers or doctors
But you have a dream. And I think you should follow your dream

When you was just a little girl, you used to love nice things
Pretty party dresses, candy and rings
You was your Momma's little angel, Daddy's little girl
They used to fix your hair up in pretty ribbons and curls
Your sex drive was much deeper than the rest of the girls
You used to freak your boyfriends, take them 'round the world
As a teen, you didn't like school that much
Your moms drank, your daddy likes to cuddle and touch
Too much, so you hit the street looking for love
Affection and devotion, met none of the above
Met me in the club working your fake id
Looked me in the face like a slave set free
I said walk into my eyes baby, come with me
I can show you things that you dream to see
Take you off the street get you something to eat
Something nice to wear and a place to sleep
My name is Ice, I'm the nicest guy you're ever gonna meet
Tell me what you want, I'll make your life complete
She said, I always wanted to be a ho
I always wanted to be a ho

You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true

The first thing we're gonna do is buy yourself a new dress
Take some pictures, put you in the LA Express
Teach you how to walk in some high heeled shoes
Let you strut your stuff by the House of Blues
Or farther down Sunset where the tricks all cruise
"Are you my pimp?"
Oh dear God don't say that
I'm your manager, your boyfriend, you're agent, your mack
Now I'm a do my hair baby, I'll be right back
Because we gotta look good when we hits the track
Now your real name? "Shirl"
Yeah, we gotta change that
I think I'll call you Apple, cause your ass is kinda fat
How old are you? "16"
Well that's just right
But you're 18 if anybody asks tonight
I'm a teach you how to get this long paper right
Catch a trick, suck his dick, break his ass for life
Cause I love you, that's all you really need to know
I'm 'bout to miss my hair appointment, girl I got to go
She said, I always wanted to be a ho
I always wanted to be a ho

You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true

"Now what if I meet a trick that got long cash?"
That's when I call the crew with the black ski masks
But right now we'll only worry 'bout the basic stroll
Hooking up my Cadillac, and upping my gold
A hundred for a full hit, 50 for a hand
Throw in a blow job, they'll fuck off grands
I may even put you where the real johns at
Some call the strip club, I call the indoor track
They got lap dancers, table dancers, mad back rooms
And you can double up your profit if you take them home
"I wanna be the best"
Well this game's the test
G-string bikinis and silicone breasts
Suckas break themselves just to sniff your nest
And if you get tired, I got crystal meth
"I think I'm in love..."
Baby doll it's on
You were made for me baby, since the day you were born

You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true

[Outro]
Yeah baby, we gonna do a lot of beautiful things for each other
You know what I'm saying?
We gonna get me a new car
We gonna get me some better jewelry
Some nicer rags, you know what I'm saying?
We gonna help each other out, you know what I'm saying?
We gonna get me a new pad, you know?
Maybe get me a Rolex
We gonna do a lot of things for each other, it's gonna be beautiful
Me and you
I love you baby
We gonna put a whole lot of money in my pocket
That's what we gonna do. You are so cute in that dress
That's right
Damn, go on
Get your ass out there and do something right quick for a player
Yeah I love you, get your fucking ass out there
I love you, get the fuck out.. aiite..

[ VERSE 1: Ice-T ]
Ice-T, let me kick my credentials
A young player, bred in South Central
L.A., home of the bodybag
You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: "Lay down!"
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name
He told me: "Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street
Rap on my record, man, Kimiko, send Ice the beat"
The Dude is def no doubt, what can I say?
The man can roll with Ice-T or Michael J

I'm back, on the block, on the screen
I'm on the wax, I'm on the stage, I'm on the scene
I'm on the case, just like an attorney
The Dude took me on a magic journey
To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when I was young and hung out
He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

[ Tevin Campbell (& Andrae Crouch Singers) ]
Stokie's just Stokie, mama
(Stokie's Stokie)
And one by one each woman he kiss
(He kiss her and she gon' fall in love)
Stokie's just Stokie, you know?
(Stokie's Stokie)
Till someone shows that they care enough
(Ain't nothin gonna bother Stokie much)
Some say they can't take it no more
(Comin here, comin here startin stuff)
But Dude is back on duty fo' sho'
(Back on the block to stay)
They say he ain't gonna be with it
(Comin back, comin back to the street)
But Dude he know you'll never forget it
(Back on the block to stay)

[ VERSE 3: Big Daddy Kane ]
Back up and give the brother room
To let poetry bloom to whom
It may concern or consume
As I reminisce before this
The bliss that exist
But now we brought about a twist
Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner
You never seen a blackman on _The Honeymooners_
But now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
The elevation of a people built is so
Jesse Jackson, Miss America a black one
No more livin for just a small fraction
I was once told by the Dude that knowledge is a food
To nourish, so to conclude
This from an Asiatic descendant, Big Daddy is shocked
Yo Q, we back on the block

[ VERSE 4: Kool Moe Dee ]
An everlasting omnipresence is my present
State of being, seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds, and I put em in flight
As I transcend, a-scend or de-scend
Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that don't know how God blessed us
Because man messed up, the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before
]From Babylon to the Third World War
I'm more than a man, I'm more like an entity
Back on the block, and this time my identity

Oooooohhhh, oooooohhhh
Oooooohhhh, oooooohhhh

[Ice-T]
It's going down, yo, the girl got a gun
Best run, because she is, quick to flip and empty out the clip
And make the men understand where she is coming from
The hardcore is connected to the base of her fate
She just breaks and brings drama to the situation
Ejaculation of her projectile, she buckwild
Better recognize that she comes, she comes correct
Collects respect, and if not, you'll catch a broken neck, buddy
Look down and your shirt is all bloody
Looks like she caught you with the bad one
For messing with the mad one
Told you about this girl before, you didn't listen to me as I talk
Now you stalked, by the hunter of the fronter
Who's size five and sexy
Quick to catch your body and another one next week
Huh, it doesn't matter cause the girl stays strapped
She said she had enough of men and now she's looking for payback (WORD!!)
And there's no way that you can fade her son
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

[Chorus: Hen-G X2]
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
[Ice-T] And there's no way that you can fade her son

[Ice-T]
The most venemous feminist, homey she ain't soft
You give her trouble then she might cut your head off
Or something that you like to think's the best
She'll blow big holes in your shest (*Gun Shot*)
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies won't
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies don't
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies can't
She said she gotta cause she knows a lot of ladies
Romance the thoughts of giving men their own medicine
Electrocute them, light them up like Con Edison
She got no fear, five rings in her ear
Holes in her nose, way out clothes
Living life to the fullest, buckshots and bullets
Triggers she'll pull it, Earth she wanna rule it
Maybe she will, cause she is quick to kill
The city lights make her dresses tight, yes she bites
You'll never know where she'll coming from
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

[Chorus: Hen-G X2]

[Ice-T]
She got no time to trip or argue, you're through
I bet she gets you
Homeboy'll catch a stretcher like so many before
She is on the Bodycount tour, but not rock
She couldn't suck the punks and cops
You say she is nothing but a woman then you'll come up shot
You say why you wanna kill me? - and she says why not!
Pop, she got a body that'll make you cry
Pop, she got a shotty that'll make you die
Don't bring drama to her homey, cause you'll wind up flat
She'll put your ass horizontal then she'll pull your cap
She got no love, and love is something that she never had
She loved the mother but she hated the motherfucking dad
So stay the hell out of her way, cause the girl don't play, none
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

[Chorus: Hen-G W/variation X2]
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
[Ice-T] So don't even try to play her son
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
[Ice-T] So don't even try to front son
I once knew this brother
Who I thought was cool with me
Chilled out together
Even went to school with me
Fly nigga, my ace boon coon
Used to low ride together
Shot dice in the bathroom
Ya want trouble?
Well trouble ya found
Cause we diss ya, then issue
The critical beat down
He needed money
I would always come through
Needed a car? He could use mine too
But bust this!
Out on the street
People say he was riffin'
Callin' me a sucker
Talkin' bout how foul I'm livin'
Someone heard him
Poppin' that shit last week
Frontin' for some pussy
From some big-butt freak
Sayin' I'm his worker
I was on his dick!
Talkin' that craazy old weak assed shit
And after all of that
She still walked away
How ya gonna diss your boy
To get some play?
And when I stepped to him about it
He said, "Who snitched?"

[Chorus]
Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' bout you
Cause some of you niggas
Is bitches too!

I knew this brother named Mitch
Stone player
He meet a girl, in five min. he lay her
Trucked crazy jewels
Hands smothered in ice
Been to prison not once, but twice
Kept a stupid thick posse
Made of thugs and
Crooks and hoods
And vet hustlers
Who were up to no good
But they all stood behind him
And watched his back
That's the only way
To roll on the track
But yo
Mitch got rushed by feds last week
The snatchbared the runk
Of his white Corniche
Took a look inside
And what did they see?
Two keys, and a gallon of PCP!
Oh shit! The thought crashed
Mitch's subliminal
Three strikes, that's called
Habitual criminal
So insted of goin' under
He snitched on his whole posse
Maxed at the crib
And sipped Martini and Rossi
Sold out his whole crew
That rat named Mitch

[Chorus]

I knew this guy
That was never that fly
Couldn't act cool
Even when he tried
When we played rough
He always cried
When he told stories, he always lied
A Black brother
Who was missin' the cool part
He had the color
But was missin' the true heart
When we would fight
He would always go down quick
So he took karate
And he still got his ass kicked
But now he's married
And he kicks his wife's ass
Says it comes from problems
That he had in the past
Doesn't like Blacks
Claims he's upper class
Joined the police, got himself a badge
Now he rolls the streets
And he's cut to jack
Doggin' young brothers
Cause they usually don't fight back
Got a White partner
And he asked for that
And every night
Another head they crack
So now he's big man
But he really ain't shit!

[Chorus]

Out one night with my crew
And some new kid
I didn'T know homeboy, but Evil E did
So I thought he was cool
We rode in his ride
Rag top tray on Daytons
Lifted side to side
We hit the party deep
Niggas was hawkin' me
You could feel the vibe
Of thick artillery
Parliament was on, some O.G. shit
I put my back to the wall
And felt my pistol grip
Al of a sudden
Niggas started trippin'
Flippin', the record started skippin'
Wildin', fools started locn up
Gats cracked
The room started smokin' up
Me and "E" hit the floor
And then the back door
My boys let off an automatic encore
But when we made it out to the ride
It was gone, we had to shoot it out
Side by side
Punk left us there to die in a ditch!

[Chorus]

So if you're wonderin' why we lookin' at you funny, it's cause
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
You always tell a brother you're gonna loan him money but you don't cause
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
Yo, Aladdin, you know why they be frontin'? I'mma tell you why
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
You always act like you can fight, but when it's a real fight you find out
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
"Yo, I'mma do it Ice, I'mma do it, Ice." No you ain't, no you ain't, cause
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
A brother think he got backup, but he really don't cause
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
I wouldn't even hit you with my fist, I'mma smack the shit out of you, cause
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
I know the real brothers
[Intro: TV Interviewer]
Ice-T, after your tremendous success on your past album
Some have said; you have sold out
Because of the use of rock'n'roll in your music
How do you reply to that?

[Ice-T replying]
You see, a lotta people don't realize that, you know
Rock'N'Roll is truely black music
It was created by Chuck, Berry, Little Richard
Even black people like that, who started it off back in the day
You know, and as far as I'm concern music is music
I don't look at it as Rock or R&B all that kind of stuff
I just look at it as music, you know
And anybody who said that I've sold out, they can basically suck my dick
Cause I really don't give a fuck about that shit, you know
But uhh.. I do what I like, I haven't like Rock'N'Roll
And uhh.. I feel sorrow for anybody who only listens to one form of music
You know, right now, I got my own Rock band, it's got to jump off
It's really black hardcore band called Body Count
And uhh.. on some of the records I'm like laying some vocals on it
And uhh.. I got a tape of it right here, yo, check it out

[Song's Intro: Ice-T]
You know, sometimes I sit at home, you know, and I watch TV
And I wonder what would be like to live in some place like
You know, The Cosby Show, Ozzie and Harriet
You know, where Cops come and got your cat outta the tree
All your friends died at old age
But you see.. I live in South Central, Los Angeles
And unfortunately... SHIT AIN'T LIKE THAT!!
It's real fucked up!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
God damn, what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red and white and blue
What? I gotta die before you realize
I was a brother with opened eyes?
The world's insane while you drink champagne
And I'm living in black reign
You try to ban the A.K
I got ten of them stashed
With a case of hand grenades

[Hook: Body Count]
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
You'd know what to do
If your kid got killed on the way to school
Or a cop shot your kid in the back yard
Shit would hit the fan motherfucker and it will hit real hard
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count

[Break: Ice-T]
Yo Beatmaster V, take these motherfuckers to South Central
Ha ha ha, yeah, fuck that
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count
Last weekend thirty seven kids killed in gang warfare in my back yard
NO!!, NO!!, NO!!
Yo Ernie C, take these motherfuckers home, yeah
Yo, we're in the house, Body Count fool, 1991 motherfucker
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
God damn what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red and white and you?
What? I gotta die before you realize
I was a nigga with opened eyes?
The world's insane while you drink champagne
And I'm living in black reign
Don't you hear the guns?
You stupid, dumb, dick sucking, bum politicians!!

[Hook: Body Count]
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!

[Outro: Ice-T]
The tension mounts...
[Intro]
Yo Ice - We heard what happened man
We heard some niggas ran in on you man
Yeah yeah, shit was fucked up man, it was real fucked up
Don't worry - We know who did it
What're you talkin about man?
The shit just happened about 3 hours ago
Yeah - but we know who did it man... it was your boy
What? Naugh man I'm not trying to hear that
Yo listen man, it was your boy man - He talks a lot
I can't believe this shit man, I grew up with this nigga man
This motherfucker, I would've died for this nigga man
And this nigga set me up?

You're now fucking with your last nigga
Quick to blast nigga
Gauge Masturbator
Chest Plate disintegrator, rider
I never wore no mask, wacked the witness - vestless
I'll put you on the graveyard's guest list
ICE - cause I lack all emotions, I'm heartless
That's why I can't figure for the life of me
You'd want to start this
My crew is bottomless
Street Lobotomists
Gun slingers
Glock cocked and diamond ringers
Hustlers
My nigga got shot but still alive
He took a full clip from another player's 25
And he said he's rolling with me, if you're coming
I told him, stay home, rest up, I got enough gunning
Homiciders
Ballin' rag Rolls riders
Blood letters
Money getters
Life betters
The last thing I heard you say you said I was a dead man, bitch
I'll put you right into gun point, you snitch
Now I know your plans are rolling on me, late when I sleep
Why don't we do this man to man? Let them bitch niggas creep
I still remember in the days when we was friends chillin
Now it seems you going to have to be my next killin

Chorus x2:
You wanna go to war, nigga tell me why?
Punk niggas talk shit, bitch niggas die
I never backed down and it ain't no time to start
Let's take it to the streets and I'm a check your heart

You must be death wishing, what's up? You know my steelo
Got love with the illest of blacks and amigos
Your jealousy is outta hand, I can't fuck wit'cha
And all your so-called down niggas, say good luck to ya
They know you're off the hook and you're soon to bleed
My reputation states that I kills with speed
More drama than a rap verse
You'll feel the mack first
In your back first
Then the black hearse
Goddamn, I can't understand the drama why?
To tell the fucking truth I thought your crew was fly
Now you're talking that shit like a bitch on the rag
Don't give a fuck about your set or the pants you sag
I drop a hot one in your forehead, neck and mouth
Then rush a hospital and bank ya if you don't check out
Cause I'm a mad nigga once, a crazy nigga twice
A cold blooded motherfucker, that's why they call me ICE
And if you told me this would happen
I would said never - no, we down forever - we flipped keys together
Now the street talkers say you want my spot
A lotta niggas did, A lotta niggas shot

Chorus

It's obvious some sucka niggas got ya gassed
Let's see if they around you when the gunshots blast
It ain't nothing nice, letting off slugs under the street life
Early deaths, dry gags and last breaths
I seen your time before you want - war till it's on
How to fuck with the king, when you're a bullshit pawn?
I can't comprehend your stupidity, miscalculation
Word to obstetricians show your crews anhiliation
Predicted, Brains get evicted, Fuckin with me kid
Bullets lift your lid
And watch your weak kool aid heart run down the drain
I got the Method Man who came to bring the pain
Let you know quick, niggas suck dick if you trip
Used to be my homie, now you just a punk ho bitch
Frustration leads to aggravation and dismay
Now you're player haten, but that's the wrong game to play
I light your block up, kidnap your moms - snatch your woman
You beg for me to stop, but I'll just keep coming
You're fucking with the illest fool in Southern California
I can roll with ya, or motherfuckin' on ya

Chorus x2

Yeah, I know the real nigga can feel this
This is dedicated to all my "friends"
Yo Ease let's do this...

I am a nightmare walking, psychopath talking
King of my jungle just a gangster stalking
Living life like a firecracker quick is my fuse
Then dead as a deathpack the colors I choose
Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter
Sucker die for your life when my shotgun scatters
We gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply

You see they hit us then we hit them
Then we hit them and they hit us, man
It's like a war, ya know what I'm sayin'
People dont even understand
They don't even know what they dealing with
You wanna get rid of the gangs it's gonna take a lotta work
But people don't understand the size of this
This is no joke man, this is real

You don't know me, fool
You disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistance
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors, my honour, my colors, my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me, what have I got
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homie got jacked
My mother's on crack
My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks
Madness insanity live in profanity
Then some punk claimin' they understandin' me
Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my sect, guess my religion

Yo my brother was a gang banger
And all my homeboys bang
I don't know why I do it man, I just do it
I never had much of nuffin man
Look at you man, you've got everything going for yourself
And I ain't got nuffin man, I've got nuffin
I'm living in the ghetto man
Just look at me man, look at me

My pants are saggin braided hair
Suckers stare but I don't care
My game ain't knowelgde my game's fear
I've no remorse so squares beware

But my true mission is just revenge
You ain't in my sect, you ain't my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homocides my favorite venge

Listen to me man
No matter whatcha do don't ever join a gang
You don't wanna be in it man
You're just gonna end up in a mix of dead freinds and time in jail I
Know, if
I had a chance like you
I would never be in a gang man
But I didn't have a chance
You know I wish I did

I'll just walk like a giant police defiant
You'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't
My gangs my family its all that I have
I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph

You don't like it, so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
Phsyco-analize tried diognising me wise
It was a joke brother the brutally died

But it was mine, so let me define
My territory don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy
Cause the bitch dont thank me
You can be read like a punk
It wouldn'ta made me
Cause my colors death
Thou we all want peace
But our war won't end
They'll always see

See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me man
But I don't wanna be down with this situation man
But I'm in here, if I had something betta to do I think I'd do it but
Right
Now I'm just down here boye
I'm trying to get money cause I'm smart
I'm gunna get paid while I'm out here
I'm gunna get that paper, ya know what I'm saying
If I had a chance like you
Maybe I would be in school
But I'm not, I'm out here living day to day surviving
And I'm willing to die for my colors

Yo'll please stop, cause I want ya all to live
This is Ice-T, Peace...
The underworld watches in horror
As this marks the day that
3 of America's most notorious outlaws
Will be executed for their crimes

Together the states of Michigan and California
Will conduct the executions behind prison walls
The 3 prisoners are set to be executed by 3 separate methods
Electric chair, hanging, and firing squad
Midnight tonight will mark the first execution

[Violent J]
Death waits in my cell I can smell him
Somebody tell him that I still breathe, leave
I'm alive I'll never see 25
Yet still I can feel, I'm real
When it all happened I was in the lime light
News, camera, gaven killer stamina
Another year I'm here but forgotten
Skin is rotting feeling old, cold
Motherfucker in a robe gonna sentence me to die in a metal chair
Fizzle my nut hair
Bad enough I'll be dead
Yet I'm tryin to figure out a way
To keep my eyes from poppin out my head
Oh they'll remember my ass
Twitchin, with my eyes drippin down the glass
Shaggy I think they're tryin to start a riot
And then it's Ice T but he don't seem fazed by it
I know the devil's waitin on me
But does God like him playin his role in killin me though
Lock me up until I die maybe
But you can never tell
We might sharing a cell in hell
Cause, my last request was
Let my homies smoke my ashes and catch a Violent J buzz
One more thing before you hit that switch
Please tell my momma that I'm sorry, I never

(Chorus x2)
Dead end no escape from it
Should've thought about that shit before you done it
Why? I, never wanna die
Don't nobody cry for me, it's only murder

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
The lights dimmed in my cell block
Cause all the power they got surged into one spot
J's chair hear him screamin, fully loaded
It was funny at first till his head exploded
It's something else for me
Another kill just as wicked
But cheaper on the light bill
It all starts with a thick rope
Make a noose and I'm gone
Stretch out my neck bone
Minutes left I think about my brother
When we was young...
Wait I don't have a brother
What the fuck?
My minds in a tangle
I wish somebody was here that I could strangle
I keep waking up on the floor
Cause I strangle myself but what the fuck for?
Haha starin at the cracks on the walls
Whistlin necks, fidgetin my balls
Kill me it'll still all be the same
Wicked clown Juggalo phantom of the night train
What if I drop, but don't die
Tie weights to my legs
And give it another try
Still coming think of something, I speak
I'm not feelin so hot let's go for it next week
Didn't work, I pulled down my collar
At least they won't be hearin me holla
My neck shut

(Chorus x2)
Dead end no escape from it
Should've thought about that shit before you done it
Why? I, never wanna die
Don't nobody cry for me, it's only murder

[A bit past 1:30 a.m. now
And the 3rd prisoner slowly makes his way
To the disignated spot on prison grounds
Where he will be executed by way of firing squad]

[Ice-T]
I got seven bitches aiming at me
My backs against the wall
If I only had my strap then I could plug 'em all
Watch 'em fall
But they got my ass tied up behind this wall
So the homies can't ride up
Known killer in fact I killed the most
At random though some of them I planned 'em
Fuck it, I kicked your bucket for you, floor you
Got more guns if there's more of ya
War with the cops no prob
They shouldn't took the job
Blow holes throught they heads like donuts
Grown-ups, kids and girls
Gather round and get gunned down
I do it for the fun of it, adrenaline rush
Coked up quick to bust
Plus I love my dust
Gun son, watch the blood run son
I'm on one, muthafuckas
But check it this time I'll be the one dissected
I can't wait to feel the heat when lead and flesh meets
Bitter sweet baby, I been waiting for this
Go straight to hell kick it with the rest of my clique
Fuck a blindfold I wanna look 'em deep in they eyes
So they can see the fool's face of a dog as he dies
Plus I wanna see the muthafuckas squeeze
I got a hot date with my soul mate
Bust I can't wait

(Chorus x4)
Dead end no escape from it
Should've thought about that shit before you done it
Why? I, never wanna die
Don't nobody cry for me, it's only murder
WAR!!!

Our government is fucked
Sure to bring us down
The media incites civil unrest
Hatred can bring you down
[Hook]
WAR!!!
I don't want your war
WAR!!!
WE DON'T NEED YOUR WAR
We don't need your war
WAR!!!
Military beasts starvin countries
Drama brings you to your knees
Spill your blood to save humanity
Dyin for the food we feed
[Hook]
Our government is fucked
Sure to bring us down
The media incites civil unrest
Hatred can bring you down
Injustice drives you crazy
It drive L.A. insane
In this generation
Hatred is the name
[Hook]
WAR!!!
L.A. '92

Bastard magic should make you cry
The answer to the question is we ain't gonna die
L.A. '92

Police can make me under stress
While all L.A.'s a fuckin mess
Don't patronise my fuckin ass
Some heads will get crashed
L.A. '92

Bush has got his upper cut
He's goin to fuckin war
He won't revert to sticks and stones
Just bullet holes and broken bones
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Don't give a fuck!

Everybody knock ya down
No weight support so taken down
The juk-jock, ??? ??? ???
We ain't got shit, now had enough
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Don't give a fuck!

Disorder!!! (x8)
Cruisin' for a bruisin', I'm takin' no crap
Pipe bomb in my trunk, got a nine in my lap
I'm layin' for a sprayin', tonight there's no playin'
My posse's most strapped, tonight the crew's weighin'
Dust is burnin', the steering wheel's turnin'
I'm out a week, I'm already earnin'
Suckers crossed, tonight it's their loss
Payback time, boy, life's the cost
Gauges out the window, one lay cross the roof
They all die if those suckers ain't bullet proof
I'm rollin' death tollin', of course the car's stolen
But I'm blind to what's wrong, all I want is what's golden
A fool in a fight, too dumb to know right
Fuckin' blue light, read 'em their rights

Drama (x4)

I copped an alias bailed out in an hour or less
I keep a bank for that don't know about the rest
Copped another piece, hit the dark streets
Rollin' once again, fuck the damn police
Called up my boy Joe, a roof job pro, 459 on his mind car stereos
He said the spot was sleek, he cased the joint a week
3 a.m. on the dot inside we creep
Got Alpines, Fishes, JVC's
Motorola Phones, Sony Color TV's
Had the ride packed up 'til we heard "Freeze"
Fuckin' blue lights, read 'em their rights

Drama (x4)

4 in the morning, lights in my face
That's the time, you know the place
Cuffed in the room with the two-way glass
Detects in effect cold doggin' my ass
"What's your date of birth?" "What's your real name?"
I stuck to my alias, I know the game
If they don't know who you are, then they don't know what you've done
"You're just makin' this harder on yourself, son"
I know this shit by heart, I'm too clever
"Have you ever been arrested before?" Nope, never
D.A. reject all over his face
You see, no confession, no case
Then my boy started illin', talkin' and tellin'
Son of a bitch, he was a snitch

Drama (x6)

Under I went, I caught a case and half
He dropped the mallet, then the judge laughed
Now I'm in the penzo, chillin' like a real pro
I can't move 'til the man says go
A puppet of the big game, an institutional thing
I wouldn't be here if I fed my brain
Got knowledge from school books, instead of street crooks
Now all I get is penitentiary hard looks
The joint is like an oven of caged heat
You're just a number, another piece of tough meat
Killers and robbers are all you greet
Act soft you will get beat
On death row they got their own hot seat
For those who feel that they are truly elite
The last thing you see's a priest
The lights dim, your life ends

Drama
[Intro/Hook: E-40 X2]
Ex D-Boy used to sell that girl
Now, they know my name all across the world
They say Earl, EARL!!
They say Earl, EARL!!

[Verse One: E-40]
I'm from Vallejo, California, land of the homer
Sides lost lives, politics and drama
Over supersize, thump young in a hornya
Watch out for that boy in the hoodie, man, he a monster
Light a sucker up, fried buster like Chimichanga
Somebody come scoop his ass, call a coroner
I guess that's the way we bread
Chemical babies mislead
It's spooky out here in the Yay
These goblins will get on your head
These thundacat's management ain't scared to be deceased
They always cover up they ears
When I'm yelling and hollering out peace!
They going through it, they cranky, stressed out and tense
They starving, they hungry, they eating soup with chopsticks
Plus, it's a shortage on purple, and it's a drought on them bricks
So he'll go decide to do a kick door, and pull a few licks
Some of them parents on drugs, some of them never been loved
Some of them want to be thugs, some of them just need a hug

[Hook: E-40 X2]

[Verse Two: E-40]
I'mma be around for a minute
So get used to it, I was through with it
Before most of you marshmallows knew want to do with it
Pushing them zones, serving that drome
Balling like I play hoop with it
Never at home, always be gone
Doing a show on the verse split
Let it be known, I tote my chrome
Refuse to get caught loose with it
Looking down at my shoe with it, I'mma real baboon with it
40 over there slipping, he snoozing, he ain't wake
He looking like a plate, he chipped up and draped
You fuck niggas got me fucked up, nigga, I'm a shooter
Think about the consequences, nigga, I got gouda
And niggas with gouda will send a nigga, fuck a case
Cause niggas with gouda will have your whole family erased
But that ain't something I endorse, I only wore it by force
I'm trying to teach the youth to be loyal and play sports
Instead of in and out of court
And back and forth to prison, utilize they skills
And stay up out the system

[Hook: E-40 X2]

[Hook: E-40 X2]
I'm from Vallejo, California
The land of the homer
Sides lost lives, politics and drama
Sides lost lives, politics and drama
Sides lost lives, politics and drama

[Outro: Ice-T]
E-40 nigga, this ain't no motherfucking news to you, man
This nigga been running the motherfucking Yay
Running the motherfucking Bay for years now, nigga
These niggas don't play, this is Vallejo, California
Nigga, you heard about it
Iceberg, nigga
Let me tell ya a little story
Bout my homeboy Ed
Use to drink every day
Straight 40's to the head
You try to snap on him
He'd ask what you said
You still try to break
He'd start given up lead
Love to gamble
On one knee he stayed
Tryin' to hit seven
On one knee he stayed
Worked tees and weights
So he always got paid
Blew on the hoes
Every dollar he made
Crazy friends, crazy friends he had
Superfly drobe, super dope pad
Cars for your ass
And I'm talkin' class
Benz's and better
With his name on the dash
One night he got drunk
And started drivin' real fast...

Ed's dead
Here we go
I'm movin' off death row
Ya gotta keep up hops
Ya can't be slow
Cause their towers are high
They got the hype gats
Check the perimeters good
Read the maps
It's night
They might not see us
Cause if they catch us out there
They'll bleed us
Shoot us, kill us
Dump us in a dark ditch
Clean it up, call it a gang hit
I gotta make my move
Cause I'm a renegade
I recognize
When mind techniques
Are being played
It's a plot they use
To keep down another
Here comes another
Brainwashed brother

"Yo man, it sounds like you're selling out to me, cause I'm from the ghetto, I lived in the ghetto all my life
We ain't supposed to leave here, we're black... we're supposed to be poor."

Shut up do you know
How dumb you sound?
That mentality
What keeps my people down
No one wants to
Live in an urban war
You live there cause
Your parents were poor
They live there because
Theirs were also
Get yourself together
Hit the gates bro!

CHORUS
Ya gotta get out!
Ya gotta get out! Why?
Ya gotta get out!
Ya gotta get out! Why?
Ya gotta get out!
Ya gotta get out! Why?
Cause the fields
Are where you die!
Escape from
The killing fields

You try to keep us
Running and running faster
But I ain't runnin' from ya
I'm runnin' at ya
And my posse's thick
About a mil strong
Too late to make up now
Cause it's on
I'm the one that's got ya
In constant fear
I'm the nigga
You shoulda killed last yeaar
But you played yourself
You let me gain wealth
Now I can change the way
The cards are dealt
I've schooled my homeboys
Made 'em all understand
The tricks and twists
Inflicted on the Black man
How ya make me think
To be down
I gotta stay around
Down in the motherfuckin'
Battleground

"We got the Puerto Ricans where we want 'em, we got the Mexicans and the Blacks where we want 'em-
Well shit, they're all Black- we gotta keep 'em together, the same way we got those fuckin' Indians."

There'll never be any good
Schools in the hood
There'll never be any cops
That are any good
The hospital is a great place
To go to die
Real estate's cheap
Let me tell ya why?
The man's got a
Sure fire system
A economic prison!

CHORUS

Escape from
The killing fields!
[Evil E]
Yo Ice man, we halfway done with the album man
You be throwin all this strong, dope, stupid fly pimp shit
But what's up with the sex rhymes man?
You ain't throw no sex rhymes yet man, whassup wit that?

[Ice-T]
Yo man, I didn't even wanna really do nuttin this year man

[Evil E]
Yo why you ain't wanna do nuttin man?
Titties man~! Sex sex sex man, all that
We need some sex

[Ice-T]
{*laughing*} Man I wasn't really about that homes
Y'know I..

[Evil E]
C'mon man! Just throw one sex joint man
For me and my boys man, me and my man
The niggas man, WHASSUP!

[Ice-T]
Aight aight aight check this out E, check this out
The other night I was out at the club aight?
(Uh-huh, what happened what happened?)
I met this FLY-ASS freak, crazy fly
(Word, she was dope?) Dope, had BIG ol' titties aight
(Ohh shit, BIG titties!)
Crazy titties and a BIG ol' ass right?
(Ohhh shit.. what happened?)

I FUCKED HER
Upon initial contact with Ice-T's music, I had envisioned him to be an ill-mannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric frame of mind, whose raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jargon, shocking sexual audacity, and repulsive images of the ghetto

However, after further analysis of his music I can deduce that he is the epitome of antidisestablishmentarianism who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle

But to make things more plain and simple to the layman, I find Ice-T to be the dopest, flyest, O.G., pimp, hustler, gangster, player, hardcore motherfucker living today

To be honest, I'm totally and irrevocably on his dick
Intro

A-yo Ice, man. I'm working on this term paper for college. What's the First Amendment?

Verse 1

Freedom of Speech, that's some motherfuckin' bullshit
You say the wrong thing, they'll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says "Profanity - No Airplay"?
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?
You're bitchin' about rock'n'roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get

Verse 2

[You have the right to remain silent]
Fuck that right! I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin'
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers deprivin' the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfuckin' apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek

Verse 3

Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said "Fuck"
So I thought for a minute and said "No
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show"
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's comin', cos I'm mad and I'm gunnin'
Homeboys, and there's no runnin'
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothin' but a piece of fuckin' shit on the damned map

Verse 4

Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away

Outro (Jello Biafra)

What they're trying to do with radio, with this, uh, McCarran-Walter Act and a lot of other ways, is start by saying that they're protecting the public from wicked rock bands, or girlie magazines, or whatever. But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down what they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information itself

If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it
