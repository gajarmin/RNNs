[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, this year we finna make a killin'
Now the money stack up to the ceilin'
All I know is payback, all I rep is A$AP
Now we finna go off in the buildin'
I could really give a fuck about your feelings
This'd be a schoolboy and a rude boy too
Not a jerk like the New Boyz, groovin' like Schoolboy Q, nigga
I done killed a few boys, nigga
Down a couple shots, turn it up another notch
Got a bitch that's in the spot and she faded
Yeah, corset top with the new ass shots
Couple Instagram likes, now she famous
Nose job, workin' on some payments
On a new car, now she finna trade it
Next time, you shouldn't've sucked a nigga dick for free
Man, I swear the smart girls are my favorite
(Oh, my God, your cable's turned off
You shouldn't've sucked the nigga's dick for free)
Brand new 'Rari, finna race it
I am not the nigga you should play with
This year, I turned it into the racist
All I wanna see is green faces
All I wanna count is green numbers
Man that shit is weird, lookin' like the Matrix
Gave 'em HiiiPower, Always Strive And Prosper
Only took a little bit of patience

[Hook]
Shorty she like to pop ass high
Popped her way up to first class high
She clap-clap-clap-clap-clap, she drop it low
Then she clap-clap-clap-clap-clap, down to the floor
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
Ever seen a crib like this? Diamonds in my ear like wrists
Pull off at the light like, 'Wuh', lookin' like a mil in that trunk
Two-seater got me lookin' all clumped, hit a nigga wig on sight
Serve a nigga mom off white, I'ma get it so high, I'm Christ
Nigga, ball so hard like Mike, I could whip that bitch like Ike
I can fuck your bitch off hype, pink ring, got bling all right
How a hot nigga rock this ice? 14, almost got that strike
14, almost did that time, 14, had a 905
Clip small, but the shit shoot fine
Shoot a spine, make a nigga recline
Start sparkin', a nigga go blind, G Rides, hoppin out of Nissans
Do I got them hoes chirpin'? Yeah
Do I put the work in? Yeah
Do I got them hoes out workin'? Yeah
Do I make 'em put the work in the Birkin? Yeah

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ohh, memories x8

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver
Watch this, no tick, yeah, I'm the nigga
Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver
Faded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer
Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiending
Give me, give me, give me some
Freak the freckles off your face, frenchy, freaking, swapping tongue
Click my link and spread your buns, loose your denim, make it numb
Blow it baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Fucking in the car service, thank me for the car pool
Chromosome, part full, prolly off a Norco
And gas, not the Arco, popping since the intro
You shopping from the window, play my favorite tempo

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Hold up, biatch, this your favorite song
Translation: Ven aqui, mami, ese culo
Tu quieres cojer mis huevos, y papi me desespero
Chuparse puto pendejo, el pinche cabron - let's get it
Nights like this, I'm a knight like this, sword in my hand, I fight like this
And I'm more than a man, I'm a God, bitch, touche, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo-doo, doo-doo," bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this, I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, I'm forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down, alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics, popping out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steering, ah!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Bummy nigga famous, straight from the bottom
Broke niggas hate it, still never robbed him
Guns in the basement, out they have a problem
Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana
Function on fire, burn the roof off this mothafucka
Psych ward is balling, go craze like no other
Weed steady blowing, pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiending
Faded, faded-faded right
Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no it's not the Westside
Stick it up ya Southside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year, I spend that on my daughter shoes
Smoking weed and drinking, all the college students loving Q
We gon' turn it out until the neighbors wanna party too

[Hook]
[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
I gotta close the window before I record
Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
Stand up

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Coogi down to the socks like I'm Biggie poppa
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
Cause you know the Fergenstein getting plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shining in the Benzo
Balling! Got me feelin' like Jim Jones, I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the buildin', semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they getting on my nerves
I ain't lying, lay 'em on the curb
Riding on a killer who be coming at Ferg! (Damn)
Girl you twerk, twerk that kitty girl make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel he gon' put him in the earth
Trinidad maniac with a all gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work
Schoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth
Polo Ground, A$AP World

[Verse 2: French Montana]
(Haaan!) That ain't Kanye
That's Montana, loose cannon
He shot me so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in it first
I just sold a swammy with ten hommies on it
Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin' for your life
Baby don't pray for me pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies

[Hook]
Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Shout out that motherland, 12 years old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga, all they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica I'm your brother
I know a bitch from VI, yeah yeah yeah that's my partner
You got a problem with it, then, then, then, then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggas and I fuck with Migos
I fuck with Haitian niggas, all they speak is Creole
I said all I speak is real, y'all niggas might hate me but
That don't get no deal, I said no that don't get no deal
I just now got my deal, but I been gettin' this money
No green card in this struggle, immigration give you nothing but work
(Put it in work)

[Verse 4: Schoolboy Q]
YAWK-YAWK, YAWK-YAWK!
A lotta niggas died, should've been from Hoover Street
No I do not have a car, but I could buy one every week
Pimpin' like I'm 33, move keys like I'm 36
Ship O's like I'm 28, Tacoma know I'm pushin' weight
O-X-Y I'm in your state, eatin' off your dinner plate
My heart live where Santa stay, super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip, she say she never had a crip
Uh, put in work, all big booties make ya twerk
All big titties lift your shirt, show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front the Church
Deacon said I did my shit, the pastor said, "That nigga turnt"
Pop my collar on my shirt, make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units, Captain Kirk, takin' xannies poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb ya first, turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth, had to give Young Ferg a verse

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Out of line, pistols barkin' "Ar, ar" ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress, side bitch won a beauty pageant
Got a chick that worked at Magic
But I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
See my daddy in heaven, right next to Ferg's
You know what's up I'm throwin' bucks, Loaded Lux, put in work
[Hook: Chris Brown]
You can tell by the way I walk that I got 'em
Bail any girl that I wanna
Got bitches n marijuana
I can tell by the way you move that you a problem
Bail any girl that I wanna

Ooh, she bad, she don't do it for free

Got a bunch of pre-rolls and a gold lighter
Think you on fire? You gon' need more fire
I tell her that's all you get like Street Fighter
Nah, walk with me, talk to me
That body cold, chess game like a pawn to me
She wanna ride with me, kick it and vibe with me
I got that long clip, fall asleep to the movie
Motherfuckin' goonies, Cartier rubies
Coupe, no top, yeah I took off the Kufi
I'm high, I'm woozie, D'usse, I'm doosing
I might just be right with my bitch in Jacuzzi
Right, nigga, gettin' right, nigga
I'ma knock that pussy out, fight night, nigga
I'mma light it up, pass it to the right nigga
All bitches at the crib, don't invite niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Pull up, got the fat sack

Yeah we suited and booted, you know your bitch 'bout to toot it
She want love from a nigga, that's a heart attack, Yack!
Loud pack, give me all of that
Don't be sending naked pics cause my phone tapped

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]

[Intro]
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

[Verse 1]
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say

[Hook]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga

[Verse 2]
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like "It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight"
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
"Fuck police" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere and I'mma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'mma always be right here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Living in a premature place... wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates... break
Every time a bullet detonate... dates... of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't (blessed, my nigga)
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all

I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
See I've been in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
All night layin' verses though I'd rather lay with you, baby
Bra and panties matchin', nail and toes, you all kinda lady
Angel out of Heaven, such a goddess have a nigga prayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
You need a real nigga, shorty
So come and throw that pussy, shorty
See I think you and me can make it
This little verse to get you naked
See, your heart ain't meant for breaking
Cupid's never been mistaken
See, I been caught up in the moment
Shit, my type ain't quite her type but now this gangsta nigga on it
She can twist my weed and hit the 'yac
I can hit your type without the hat, put that pussy on the map
I see qualities in a bad girl, I know that ass you got
Come with attitude and your swag, girl, you ain't wrong, girl
Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl
Cause you girl, cause you girl, girl, cause you girl, girl
Cause you girl, girl...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Throw a loc your pussy, girl, you knowing that your nigga faded
Can I hit that pussy way I wanna while this record playing?
Put my tongue in different places, play a game of Operation
Like, na-na-na, la-la, la-la, you get what I'm saying
No metaphors, nothing like that
I'm keeping it straight to the point with you
So, I'mma put this dick up all in-side-of-you

[Hook]
[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Oh, you the motherfucking man, huh?
Oh, you be fucking bitches, counting all the bands, huh?
Oh, you be trapping out the bando selling grams, huh?
Oh, you be smoking, drinking lean, and popping Xans, huh?
You see, that's the bullshit that I don't need
I'm telling y'all niggas, y'all ain't fucking with me
See, I look in the mirror and he said, "You are the man"
And I said, "Hey man, I agree"
Rocks on rainbow, Ben's a nice fellow
Your neck reflects your personality, and mine is yellow
Boy, I hit the block, like I hate Legos
They know, they got thirty seconds; Jared Leto
Before they see some halos, and I reload the ammo
Boy, it's Golf Wang-o, and that's the squad I bang-o
Until my fucking brain go, now let's reload the aim-o

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Can't a nigga get some fucking chaos in hurr?
I'm the truth and the dare
And you can get your ass beat like a kick and a snare
ScHoolboy's my niggy, you know I'm good in the 50s
That boy's not that bad, enh, it's no Biggie
It's the G-O, the L-F, we go-go, no homo
We black out, and go hard like JoJo and fuckin' Diggy
No ship in this series, since I pissed off Iggy man
We been that man since Batman had a sidekick
Catch me in some Vans like one of them soccer mamas
And them bitches blue like that family went to the Dodgers
Solve 'em (Oh no!) You can't bitch, I'm a problem
And you'll get fucked up like the thoughts inside of my noggin
Going harder than the quidditch in Harry Potter
All my shows got one black in it like Larry David
And I'm that nigga, meaning I'm two niggas, I'm schizo
Brent Lowe, my motherfucking bingo
Pink and yellow on my neck remind you of my dickhole
And I don't really fuck with you niggas, shout out to Jim Crow
Don't get offended, love being darkskinned
23 with the crib and I don't got no tenants
And I don't like sports, but the court got a tennis
Is that diamonds on your neck? Stay the fuck out my business
See, that's that cherry bomb, get my burr on
That's McLaren, '91 out the Chevron
Motors Flog Gnaw, Vans on, fuck your Jordans
Went from throwing up to throwing carnivals
Boy, I'm a sicko, flaco nigga, but kinda macho
Boy, I got some vatos and shout out to ScHooly, he kinda loco
Pack a de la pistol, we splitting nachos, then for that cheese
Boy, he was using some shells just like a taco, so grab your goggles
Nigga, Taco Tuesday, you don't want none of that
Have you heard of Fairfax? Boy, we was running that
Nigga took the store from us, yeah, fuck all of that
(Man, he really took the store)

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Crack a cracker with a barrel, uh (yeah)
Gang bang tattoos, this ain't a Louis rag (rag)
Orange Paisley got me crip crazy (uh, sup cuz?)
Pants heavy, sag to the left with the belt strapped
No face mask, nigga, just toe tags
Still the blunts getting passed, yeah
Ain't worried 'bout no niggas (nigga)
Grieve over suckers (sucker)
Gunpowder on my knuckles (knuckle)
Call the ambulances (ambulances)
I'm from the era of crip walking
You was clown-dancing, you wanna be me, huh?
Cause is wack in his raps and what he rap, he ain't done
Top Dawg, Wolf Gang, smell the cat on your tongue
Pussy boy, you fucked over, nigga, control your gums
Teeth missing, moms' won't recognize your face when it's lump
My square homie's license, double life in my trunk
Mind, power, body, and soul, we break handcuffs
Got a strike on my record, double cups, and duck
You want the life like us, you need to crip that coast
You want to steer that wheel, you want to smoke that kil'
Wait, who am I?

Contradictions in my thoughts and I just execute my feelings
Shake the nonbelievers off, I'm tryna navigate a million
But you first let's hit the store you know I love Korean

Turn you job into a ki, turn that ki into a beach
Turn that beach into ur sleep, rest ya head, remain neat
Haters love to hate a G, gossip on ya bakery
Wish they had the recipe, swear this life is meant for me
Tired of cracking niggas heads in the stolen challenger
Hopped up out the passenger and merked the DA's messenger
Every corner, camera, nigga I'm just tryna live
Shitty on a shitty curb, niggas kill ya front your kids

You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB that my brother like a Wayans
Just know I only show up if you payin', nigga
Yea, I always been on, I always been too on
For like the past five years all these niggas wanna shine
I got the flashlight here man

Old soul livin' in the past life here man
You, bring the cash right here man
Miracle, sit your ass right here man
Man, you know I hate to wait
That's why I get it first and you get it late
Yea, OVO sound man that's everyday

[Hook: Tinashe]
Man, I love to get on

[Bridge: Tinashe]
I love to get 2 on
Let-let... let's roll

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Yea we can get active

If you a lame, nigga you ain't making no noise
Get faded, turn up with the big boys
Live fast, die young that's my choice
Get money, get money like an invoice

We can mob all in the whip
Make the money make a grip
I be stuntin' with my clique
Getting faded 'till we trip (oh)

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Uh, pull your panties down from under you

Drunk than a bitch, high on that Mary Jane
Pussy in my mouth, pussy on my pinky ring
Nasty, baby me do it in the backseat
Swear this marijuana keep it cracking
Lights, camera, action, I ain't doing nothing 'til the cash in
Money, money, money, weed, fashion
Draped up and dripped out, keep the trees passing
Girl toot that thing up, fuck me, fuck rapping
Days of our lives so clap, clap that cake
Spreading your thighs I pump, pump your brakes, ay

[Bridge 2: Tinashe]
Just give me the trees and we can smoke it ya
Just give me the drink and we can pour it ya
And my enemies, they see me living now
And if you roll with me, then you'll be winning now, oh

Bring me out with all them other niggas over there
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Said I'm a fuckin' monster
A massive attack I haunt ya
Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
Mastered that after that I went for thermometors
Popped 'em all, then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Holla back they promised us
No pajamas insomnia
Will attack, I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet (BLAHH!)
And you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendars calisthenics and silencers exercisin' that trigger strap
Rock with us Metallica, competition no talented
I'm in a jungle what's wild enough
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin' my soldiers dyin' this is Iraq
Alliances lining with stars and bars of a prison rep
My science applyin' pressure her stretcher is needed pay the proceeds
Or your livin' debt y'all soft as a giga-pet
You niggas can't see me unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet
I spit 'til I feel my breath
Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest
She fuckin' the fuckin' best
Mean my dick is the dick of death
Means I'm killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah Dre
Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin'
Whether you storm to your climate
Whether your beat makin' or rhyming
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman
Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island with Ray Bans
Glasses palmin' asses that probably came wit a great tan (laughs)
I be the motherfuckin' mecca of these hub city spectrum
Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frog rectum
Why you wreckin' with irreputable my worst flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera etcetera Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you 'bout, about face with army outfits
The generals here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair and me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet
Put me in a category
I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory
Your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they Crippin
Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Bitch I been doin' before you niggas ruined it
Show me somethin' different
You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies I know your statistics
Who your boss, he more like my assistant
Get lost have a egg and a biscuit
Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missin'
Q...Q

[Verse 3: ScHoolBoy Q]
Double up, shit, what the fuck?

[Intro]
Play them, play them, play them loud
Yeah, all night
Comin' down, bangin' that new shit

[Verse 1: XV]
From the moment you said I was over my head
I wrote on my hand your name in my Grammy speech
(You made a monster out of me)
My label tried to change me, well congratulations
Now look what you made me, I done turned to a motherfuckin' beast
(You made a monster out of me)
And I will go wherever you take me
But the only place you drive me is crazy, cause baby
(You made a monster out of me)
And magazines said I couldn't blow like Lohan
Now I'm making all my haters Earl, no ToeJam
Mess with me and I am on your head like Zohan
Flocka no hands, that is no man, that's a monster

[Hook x2]
Real monsters, real monsters
Real monsters, play it, play it, play it loud

[Bridge x2]
They say, "Put on for us, make us proud"
On top so see me now
If you hate don't make a sound
Play it, play it, play it, loud

[Verse 2: XV]
When they see him with the green shock the world like Blanka
Whipping through the city in a Phantom of the opera
Tell every interview and blogger
(You made a monster out of me)
So I dressed up in a old tux
Smoked four blunts then I took a horcrux
Buried myself alive, now look what woke up
(You made a monster out of me)
And my ex girl said I wouldn't make it
Now she ass-naked
Revenge so sweet on her knees make her taste it
And I'm just sayin'
(You made a monster out of me)
But what you ain't make is a dude from the midwest
Who grind for ten years just to get himself these big checks
I am overkill, Cloverfield meet T-Rex
What's that mean X? That just means that
I'm a monster

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Mom told me that I need to grow up
I was in the room trying to blow up
Could only get an eighth, I'm tryna roll up, turn up
(You made a monster out of me)
Yeah, she was on her own and could do well with the support and
Thank God that you didn't get that abortion
And thank you for them J's, man them shits was so important
(You made a monster out of me)
Homies laughin' and girl done left me
Just borrow money, now I'm owin' like Jesse
Same clothes, underarms smell zesty
(You made a monster out of me)
But now I got a whole new steez, polo tees
Matchin' drawers, suck on these
And yes the honeys all on me from the way I be's
Lil' Q, Figg Street, bitch now couldn't be
Can I sit 'em down
Top Dawg bow wow

[Hook x2] + [Bridge x2]

[Verse 4: B.o.B.]
Look what you did to me, look what you started
Now this middle finger's higher than the planes in Laguardia
There'll be no apologies, don't beg for my pardon
Sir, you'll just look retarded, so get the fuck off it
Listen, they know I done been with beast mode
Been turned up, ya'll niggas late to the party
Been caked up, ain't no fake in this balling
Got accounts overseas that they can't even audit
So be aware of the angel of death known as debt
You just living now-a-days to protect head and neck
That's a billion lost souls that the government collects
In the belly of the beast and she harvesting a nest
That's why I never sleep, tell me what the fuck is rest?
Niggas thought I sold my soul for the money and respect
But I ain't playing checkers my nigga I'm playing chess
So checkmate, exit now, stage left motherfucker

[Hook x2] + [Bridge x2]
[Intro: Will.I.Am]
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh, haha, oh!
Oh, haha, oh!

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
East side, wild city; got my block with me
Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
Death around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
Bring the word like a preacher
Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa
When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like a [warner?]
Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Not  just because you [?] guns
Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
But I was built in [?], in the ghetto (stop)
Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock
I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)
Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)
Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows
Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)
Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods
Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
In full, like ace till momma's straight
And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight
Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
Cause you might need it, more than I
All My Life Remix, brought to you by:

[Hook]

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
This what you doing for town, huh Rock
Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
[?], make the pain get lost
Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
Scream "New West" had everybody pounding
Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
Go to hell, i got records to sell
Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese
You can ask my homie Adolf, he wrecked them niggas in [?]
I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees

[Verse 8: Nipsey Hussle]
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on a block, blue collar wasn't me
My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"
We [?] pick you up and drop you off down the street
And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
But they all ever seem to hear is all red [?]

[Verse 9: Sinful]
Vamos, todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
Long Beach California vecinos de Watts
Mira como abrazo el [?]
Y ahora mira lo que toque, yo
No más pistolas y rosas, no
No más [?] con fácil copas, no
Aprendí si no hay [?] nadie avanza
El barrio nos [?] [chansas] y [los] [planchas]
Amor a las calles, que me criaron a mi
A ese que murió porque me brincaron a mi
Fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocí
Mucha sangre, mucha lágrimas yo lo vi
El esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
El mejor secreto guardado por cierto
Descanso con un ojo despierto
Silencio soy el águila del [?]

[Verse 10: Ya Boy]
I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
I was right there at that corner store
I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
I even had cream, like Rocky Road
I thought getting out the hood was impossible
That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note
If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!

[Verse 11: Roccett]
Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
Got the black bandana with the strap to match
Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
As I rock throwback like the huxtables
Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine

[Verse 12: T.K.]
I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
My whip lean, my shoes clean
Diamond watch, low-key
All sip, mint green
Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas [?] don't fronting me
I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it

[Verse 13: Problem]
(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?
I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all
Look like new waves but I' stuck them home
Niggas want to creep when they think you on
So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!

[Hook]

[Verse 14: Young Keno]
(I feel you Jay)
I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
And even though I moved a little  work
I still suited up for a Sunday at Church
Then back to the block, to diss a few [packs?]
Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
This day and night though, I know it ain't right
But down in the hood, man, this is our life

[Verse 15: Spider Loc]
I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water
Both feet [?] hard on the angle
Hood on the back [?], stars on the ankle

[Hook]

[Verse 16: 211]
Product of the block, young rider from the block
Used to run on 'em niggas, [?] rob them with the Glock
In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
Got my enemies hot, cause I made a [?]
We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
I heard the [?] want me, they gon' have to come and catch it

[Verse 17: Bangloose]
Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping
What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?
I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
I'm so cocky, you wish you could be [Bane?]
You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
Banging you so tight, like a [bike chain?]
You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
Yeah, [?] socks, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 18: Mistah F.A.B.]
Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope
My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!

[Verse 19: Roscoe Umali]
Came from nothing, rose from slums
Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
Half these wack rappers is some good actors
Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta
But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit

[Hook]
[Hook: Decadez] (x2)
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money

[Verse 1: E40]
All we want is the money, the mozzarella, Galbani
I got more guns than the army, can't let no bitch nigga harm me
I got that purple like Barney, I got two bitches that's horny
They say they niggas is corny, they never there and they lonely
They bought a bottle of 'trony and now they ready to blow me
If you know me you owe me, that's what I told her for sho'
I'm a mac just like Goldie, me and my cronies and brodies
Rollies and stogies, stay with the fifties and forties
That's us if you smell smoke, cookies the antidote
Puffing that rope-a-dope, my partner's they kinfolk
They rap and they sell coke, bust ya head like a cantaloupe
In the summer, a peacoat, my iPhone is jailbroke
Leaning like the Tower of Pisa, promethazina
Sweatin' like we under a heater, it's hot in here
All them suckers that's talking crazy, they not in here
Never tell my right ear what my left ear hear

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
I'm up before the sun up, the work it be uncut
I break it in pieces and tell your auntie to run up
Shooters keep guns up, snitches get tounges cut
Talk to the peoples, and get your daughters and sons touched
I'm up in the chevy, we bangin blow job Betty
I just whip up a 80, so hit my phone when you're ready
Turkey bag of the loud, we ain't fuckin with reggie
Trump the trailer with pounds and touchdown out the [jevy?]
So c'mon! About to hit another Lick
‘Bout a 150 bucks, for that tax on every zip
Gerber bottles of that lean, tax on every sip
Cause they got the Qualitest and I got the Actavis
So Im rollin' (rollin'), thizzin' off that molly
Stuntin' (Stuntin'), no hands on the Ducati
My big homie E-40 put me on the Carlos Rossi
I stay younger than the muscle
Got the game from Charlie Hustle

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Pockets will advance, clear the room
If the bitch ain't with the shit, then your boy don't approve
See, Hennessy, Bacardi turns the party
Backwoods pre-rolled, club get foggy
Niggas mean muggin', well leap then froggy
Though I see why you mad, her ass applauding
That's your bitch, she flip like dolphins
We gon' work out and bounce the bed springs
No credit cards, just debit and large cash
And a real big bag, smell like a forest
I used to sell weight 'til gastric bypass
Pass with a Mac that smack your car glass
Addicted to ballin', no Timbs, ate Wheaties
Learn from Doo Dog, he taught big gritty
King East Bay, E-40, boss leany
Money all there, your money Houdini
[Intro]
Being here in America doesn't make you an American
Being born here in America doesn't make you an American
I see America through the eyes of the victim
I don't see any American dream, I see an American nightmare
Power to the people

[Hook: Boaz]
We got more crack in the ghetto than they could grow in Columbia
Put this shit right in front of ya, this is America!
We got more guns in the hood than soldiers out on the line
See hustlers out on they grind, how you get rich in America
And we all just tryin' to make it, all around the world
For those who never mistake it, ain't no place like America
And your pride get hard to swallow when everything controlled
By that all mighty dollar, we don't fear God in America

[Verse 1: Boaz]
Okay the sun rise from the east, the west marked by the beast
The crime rate in my city still risin' like yeast
My young homie said, "Fuck school" and hit the block
I try to tell him, "Be thankful for the shit you got"
Cause ain't nobody gon' do nothin' for you
They gave the ghetto dope to hang ourselves then kick the bucket for you
Still throwin' rocks at the pen, full of dope spot
My homie just got out and locked up again
Cause ain't no discipline (Not at all)
Speakin' frankly, it's all about the Benjamins
More chiefs than Indians
That's why I just be playin' my part (my part), keep doin' my thing thing
My phone like a telethon, it always go ring ring
My hands cash registered, they always go ching ching
Call me Joe Blow, cause I'm smokin' that mean green
Gotta stay high to deal with all these characters
Cash rules everything all over America

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
Na nigga, we tryin' to ball nigga
Bullets ejecting enter give him a hot winter
From a nobody nigga to top-tener
To bitches givin' head just hopin' that I remember
Obama lied, ain't see shit changed
The cocaine came, with no shame, we does our thing
My gang go bang, his blog be the same, her block be the same
I just might get rid of that range and cop me a plane
I'm ghetto fabulous, not corporate but nigga rich
Jesus Christ can't believe this shit
The pistol on me make me feel grave
Ya man murked could make you feel hate
A murder squad get the ?
God couldn't help me with the bills I pay
So I'm stealin' the collection plate
Prayed to him, guess he answered late
On my knees just tired of tryin' to get his attention
So fuck it, I'm back to bitchin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boaz]
Everybody on welfare, nobody got healthcare
War goin' on right here, the president well aware
Come through your city, but won't visit the ghetto there
We in our own world from California to Delaware
The black market, yeah the hood be arrangin'
How the prices be inflatin' all the goods we exchangin'
To be doctor was my earlier plan
Til experience let me know I had the world in my hand
Now I got so many girls in my pants
Don't know if they reachin' for me, or the Jacksons and grams
I see my fans, they all happen to ask
Young Bo, when you gon' put the game back in the trance?
I'm like, "I'm on it, I'm on it"
You see how I be doin' it
I feel it then I record it, sound the same when I'm performing
To tell the truth, the crack game was never boring
Bet they'll be the best memories we talk about tourin'

Load up Dreddy van, hit the L.I.E
Niggas rapping, they be trappin, that's a L-I-E
I really live that let me tell you who the hell I be!
Had a nigga in the spot in the Hamptons, used to grab 4 of em
That's 25 a piece at least
Nigga getting chicken off that liquid petroleum
That OG kush, I used to ounce that
Fucked a little money up, it help me bounce back

But e'rybody in the world need that loud pack
Riiiight?

Had a nice year and the bitch just started
OF Tape went fucking retarded

I was Doms OG, puffing and coughing
Man niggas ain't real this often

Nigga, it be green like a jersey in Boston
It's Doms nigga, you better get real fine nigga

I had my back against the wall, nigga
Said fuck that and I balled, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Backwoods keep a nigga's mind stuck
Off OG niggas tryna OD
With a NY bitch who want a mouth rush
She let a nigga skeet, all the girls know me
And I got the head too, cause the weed's so good, made a bitch say "Q!"
And a nigga so faded, racked out man a nigga straight made it
And you won't hit it if you're corny
Just got a ounce, more dope for the homies
I'm a rap Willie Nelson and Monster Kody
These raps is the end
I don't fuck with Kony, sliding in a Benz, no top up on me
50 for the bill, nigga fuck that Tony
Ride around gettin it, smoking on doty
(Fire pack)
My mama with a bag with a little bit of hash
My daughter hear my grind and she had covered it with cash
Brought behind the wheel on me and gas
My nigga was in my drawers, so she smothered me with ass
Girlfriend are bugging, happy cause they keep me hoes
Switching up my flows cause a nigga getting blow
Dollar after dollar, man, this money getting old
Still buying eighths, what you know about O's?

[Hook]
[Hook]
Too high, can’t come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round

[Verse 1: Game]
Back to the hoes
Ridin' down 7-4th and Hoover with my nigga ScHoolboy
Cadillac and a coupe
See them niggas hatin from afar, can’t catch em now
But they getting smacked when we do
Ra ta ta like we snoop
Crown on the vic
Crown on my wrist, crown on my bitch
And a couple crowns on my crew
Couple pounds of the blue
Ivy in it, tsunami in it when I be in it
Got the lobby in it, Tommy in it
The trunk got a body in it
Niggas be like he bodying it
Ziplock full of J’s, closet full of J’s
Workin' on my Pippen, he’s Scotty in it
Bath tub big enough to fit a Audi in it
8 gold chains like a Saudi in it
Murder with the ink, I’m Gotti in it
Don’t get too popped get your ass 2 Pac'd
Cargos with the 12 gauge shotty in it
Plus I still got a crib on Brazil
I ain’t never hardly there but I got a Maserati in it
That’s my new addition, nobody in it
Chop shops in the hood, no karate in it
So much money, got a money tree
Whoop so many niggas’ ass, shit we money team
Same fuck niggas with they hand out
Same sad song, bring the bands out
Nigga should be workin on they money scheme
Back to the convers, kill 'em with one verse
Converse with the worst til one of our gun burst
Call the mortuary, tell him niggas in one hearse
‘Cus Compton ain’t like the city of commerce
No back talk, back wall, end up in asphalt
Niggas got them choppas like we flyin' the black hawk
Put you with the roots, thinkin' a nigga was black thought
Now hold that thought
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Pray for me, I’ll make 30
Desert, even my nails dirty
Everything on life and I’d die for it
Made a mill, you ain’t even know it
Tell Illuminati I’m down for it
Call Jigga, I'm next nigga
Son niggas my new litter
Fuck the world on earth day
Her booty clap on my birthday
I would take the cake but I’ve been paid
I’m a real nigga, you’s arcade
Had a switch blade in the 5th grade
Smoked plenty weed on my mama’s couch
Now I’m going big, I can buy the house
You sound water down, I sound off a ounce
See this for those who say "where you from"
If those hoes who gonna make me cum
With them fuck niggas we don’t fuck with them
And fuck niggas gonna lose a lung
Knock knock nigga, come feel the drum
If the bread low I’mma stack the crumb
Up the contraband in-between my gun
Before smoking dope I was selling coke
Well rocked up to a 8 year old
When it popped up, call it pot luck
500 G’s, nigga pretty please
Condos, where it’s sun and trees
10 keys with my 8 G’s
Hoover hats like the star of David
Pull on shots unless keep me faded
Ran up on 'em, I ain't good with aimin'
Move out the set but the set I’m banging

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Look, a young nigga really tryna stunt, fuck it
West side Ingles and I ain’t budging
Independent niggas with no budget
If it ain’t about a dollar gotta change subjects
Rap ass niggas ain’t sayin nothing
This flow here, niggas can’t touch it
Motherfuck friends, tinted windows on the Benz
Doing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket
Sox gang off in the streets
10 hut, bring the squadron with me
See niggas talk ballin like they been in the gym
But you lookin like a novice to me, now quit talkin to me
Can I vent? All you niggas sound retarded to me
Killin these niggas, I’m a general nigga
Turn yo head to target for free
Now I’m on, look at me
Started, started with them pistols and palm trees
Now when niggas come through the wood
Niggas gotta know that that’s all me
See the set catch rap
When I slide through throwin up all bills
And niggas wanna act like they thuggin like us, we said boy please
This S to the K to the E to the Mmm nigga
New Rolls go vroom nigga
.45 cocked back like boom nigga
Got enough loot to fill up a room nigga
And I’m rolling these blunts at 100 a go
Gave her that dick now she beggin' for more
Made me a millie, yo bitch load is illie
But I ain’t got, still got 100 to go
And I do it, I does it

I just left from Newark, got bands in my luggage
Play with you rappers, my nigga this bloodin'
Take out my dick, take a piss on the public like fuck it

[Hook]

[Welcome To California]
[Intro: Too Short]
Welcome to California bitch
Welcome to California bitch

[Hook 2]
Sky’s not the only place
Sounds like a BS
I know another place
Where you can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining

[Verse 4: Game]
Nigga done been everywhere
Left trails in my city everywhere
But nowhere like home
C-O-M-P-T-O-N on
Bitch come and dust my throne
Stand from grandmother’s porch to my executive Porsche
Now I’m driving through London and Rome
With a Parisian bitch
Rockin corn rows, backseat of my Panamera watchin' pornos
Where we goin? What we doin?
Fly to Johannesburg, leave the city in ruins
Then fly to Dubai on my poolside, coolin'
My Audemar ain't waterproof, fuck it go and get a new one
I done been everywhere around the world and that’s cool
But can't no hotel fuckin' reserve us parked through
My hood gorillas move whenever sharks move
Move to back to Compton shit, we ought to
Condos on Wilshire, shit I bought two
Livin' down the street where BIG got shot, I haunt you
And the very next day where Pac met his fate
It’s how we live our life, surrounded by tape
Pause

[Verse 5: Game]
Where the angels fly, city of angels I will never let you down
Kill anything approaching my crown
Still undefeated
That’s why I got my kids building sand castles on the beaches
But don’t get it confused, city still got rules
Wear the wrong colors, nigga end up on the news
Lights out like Durant in a Drew
Then I’m right back down Compton avenue in a Buick
If you had a heart, niggas put a bullet through it
And it took a coma for you to be king would you do it?
Would you do it?
If I dropped you off at Watts would you walk through it?
Would you be from Grape Street or would you Piru it?
Here’s my red rag, it says, "ain’t nothing to it"
They go the 60’s, motherfucker good luck
(Welcome to California bitch)
They go the 60’s, motherfucker good luck

[Verse 6: Schoolboy Q]
From the corner where that hoes said to kick at
Short dress, hair down the bizack
You know me with my thumb in my index
Nah, I ain’t bloodin' nigga
Pass blunts to my cousins nigga
Turn hell into gold, I can pon the river
HiiiPower, you a Amish liver
Cali dro in my lungs and such
Twisted blunts from dawn to dusk
My shoe box should’ve been a armored truck
Everything good, feeling marvelous
Came to the city, that you honored us
You don’t talk me a Game, no game homie
Get greedy with the clip, no aim on it
Uh, and this the 3rd degree
Burn like the bridge and yo business, uh
Started at the floor, at the beginning, uh
Now I rep the floor until the ending, uh
Smoking on L's cause I’m winnin', uh
Wax getting blowed, just to kindle it, uh
Uh, yea now back to the groove, back to the hoes
Ra ta ta in the lap with the 2
No Cali J, I still ran all blow
All in the trim, straight lookin like you
Figg tattoo

[Verse 7: Schoolboy Q]
I’m in the gangsta shit, gangsta clothes and gangsta crib
Need a gangsta bitch to take the dope and hop the fence
Might die on the freeway
Hey, much love to the Kee-Way, aye
Watch you know about LA?
(Welcome to California bitch)
Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they dome us
(Welcome to California bitch)
Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they, pop pop pop

[Hook 2]

[Verse 8: Skeme]
Got a bitch, say she wanna fuck in Beverly Hills
And I swear I’mma bring her to the set if she will
And if I do the pussy better be killed
Just the way I make her feel, no Stephanie Mills
These niggas heavily trill, these haters never be real
I came up in a world where it’s kill or be killed
I swear that every bitch I used to fuck, fuckin' me still
Just give a dick, never covered a bill
This shit is real, this west side INGLCL
Bands on them bitches, getting ends on them bitches
Gold framed Cartier lives on the bitches
Last long like I’m using extends on them bitches
I’m a native, I got real niggas with me
Golden state, gold grills, I put on for the Betty White
Middle fingers for the pigs
Tell them bitch niggas suck a dick
Man come and get me aight

[Outro]
This nigga Chuck want a nigga be in here
Rappin' all day and shit
Blood, I got to go get my shit braided
Nigga ends and shit all out
And I ain't got no lean?
Fuck this, we out this bitch
What's happening though?
(Welcome to California bitch)

[Hook 2]
[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
I done beat the breaks off niggas
Shot the face off niggas
Pending case with the state, and I'm still out trippin'
All the feds take pictures, fuckin' up my image
Even mama bringin' drama, I don't trust no (bitches)
See these hoes be out here switching their sides
When its time for the killin' i ride
Look right in my eyes, been ready to die, risk felony time for threatening mine
Better than I, nobody alive
Nobody live the life that i did
Fighting to live since I was kid
Playing in the yard with a 30-06
House look like a gun range
Room look like a gun store
Either you're gonna know my name, or niggas dying young and poor
Either way don't give a fuck, you gon' find me northbound
With the shit, I'm in the shit
You know I love them gun sounds
7's cry, macs applaud
They taking shots, I had to call
You catch 'em out the shot gun, that's Roddy White from 50 yards
No body shots, I'm hitting jaws
Tryna run you Stephen Hawking
You see I mean this shit I'm talking
You don't want no problem

[Hook]
Slave to the rhythm, shoot my master in his back
Two dope boys, in the Cadillac strapped
Wood grain dash, windshield stained glass
Beatin' down the ave, like we back sellin' crack
Killin' for the karma, but livin' for my mama
Trouble what the call us, and nothing what they offer
Off 'em, and they wonder why niggas get shot
And they wonder why niggas shot

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Where you at, where you from?
Cause it's hot where I'm at
Any time of the day you get robbed you get jumped
It’s a game we play, to get paid
From the wants to the needs to the young
Snakes slide through the grass
Blades slide in the back, of the used and abused
Tryna walk in my shoes
Get tripped by my fuse, too short
Ask God what you want, he said I want your life
Well I ain't live mine right
But if I do the crime I do the time
I ain't scared of shit, I was born to die
Extended clip, big .45 been quick to trip
Been lost my mind
When I die, please don't let mama cry
Cause she know it had to be him or I
And I got caught slippin'
Get a gun and go knock that nigga
Run up on him, no mask, no feelings, no room for that
They shoot at us, then we shootin' back
Burnin' shells till I burn in hell
And I'm cool with that, that uzi packed
I done learned a lot in these 19 years
Lot homies ain't shed one tear
God decide what my curfew is
So till that day, I'mma do my shit
I proved my shit, they know my name
Not proud of the outcome either have regrets or
Be out young, don't sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
I took the blue pill and its evidence was shown
Homies from elementary some them niggas gone
I got this cocaine
But my stove ain't turning on
I got that knock-knock
Uuh, yeah you know
Riding in the whip for sure
No Ls in the whip for sure
All the homies strapped but it ain't for show
Tryna hit a lick, no envelope
Nigga, weed ain't the only thing get smoked
Cuz got ghost 'fore he even got ghost
Cuz got toast and he ain't old enough to drink
Shouldn't been singing
Now his ass Murder Inc
Sunny LA, where we never need a mink
Sunny LA, where the youngers don't think
Sunny LA, where the heat get sprayed
And every other word on the wall get K'ed
All the homies taking you to parking space
This my set, I ain't hearing whatcha say
Back then had to be in by 10
But out by 12
My man just said the word
I got the text on the cell
Back with the Locs raising Hell
Found out the homie in a cell
I know we hated school
But it's better than jail
Gotta thank God I was saved by the bell
Tryna spit bars
I ain't trying to live behind 'em
So I keep my face here
Right where I found them
Nigga my rawness
Fuck through a condom
Ready when I'm rapping
No wonder why they signed him
I'm with the house
So whatcha still pining
Dead by the street lights
Boy you shining
Talk about you grinding
[Intro X3]
I'm turnt up right now
I'm turnt up right now
I'm off half a bean it's like eighty degrees
But I got the chills right now

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
She looks hot so i need that bop if you can understand my language
A dollar might fuck your main bitch
I fuck a main bitch
Ain't got no main bitch
That was back then, no disrespect to none of them
Cause what i learned from all of em', is that everything comes to an end
So I'mma party to the end, can i finish, counting ends
I don't drive but I'm in a Benz, she don't lie 'less she with her man
She don't smoke, but she roll my dope,
I don't licky lick, she knows that's a joke
She suck dick off impulse, that's 69 if you can't divide
I wasn't great in algebra, but i can talk you out ya bra
Take you places you can't see, with just two eyeballs (Three Eyes)
I got three eyes, I got three legs, pick one
Long-term, tre piece, but this will be my fifth run
Harry fraudulent on the beat I beat Up that's my word
Action Bronson got the weed, I need, I didn't have to pee

[Hook]
Back Then, way back when, I was broke as Bruh Man
Nigga my time is coming, look what i done did
Swag on 300, TDE we ballin' man
Inside the game, ain't too much change, I told y'all I been gone insane, but that was
Back Then, way back when
Back Then, way back when
Back Then, way back when, look what i done did

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Where your nigga at homegirl, he ain’t shit

I’m ballin' man, i’m ballin' man, i’m a baller, man
Hit her one time don’t call her, man

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Back then, way back then you’d have thought I had sense
That’s ‘cause you ain’t know what I had since
Ask you I’m getting … dude don’t call me BMF
I’m spinning every dough I get, old marijuana by the zippy
Chicken Fetuccine Alfredo, teenagers of promethazine
Codeine, that’s 16 and lean
Keep that on the low, I’m talking too much, I had two eatables
Pour up a foe for soul, I’m doing incredible
Considering my schedule
BET Music Matters, if it don’t, it pay, though
Show ‘em the sing, that top dog, should’ve signed a page row
Grade A though you keep coming, just keep coming

Grab your brownie, sit the party, shake the party
Break the party, murder party, leave the body, tell nobody
Put it down, Figg Side rip ride
Grooveline wig line shots fired knock-knock, YAWK!
You ain't really 'bout that, you don't want to see a Glock out
You a pussy ass nigga, you be hoping for a cop out
Got a nine and a clip, put a nine on your hip
Keep talking that shit, knock five on your lip
G-Ride ski masks and colored rags
Contraband in bags, focused on enemigos in jags
Big sips out our flasks, we faded who next to get famous
Them bangers get banging that barrell keep changing like click-click
Shit, I wish a nigga would
Feeling fucking good, crack and scramble up your hood
Get it understood, I could have cuz leaking blood
Personal as fuck at your door drop you on your rug

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing sweet 'bout rumbling with B's
You don't need water to travel through the seas
Unravel the backwoods and crumble up the trees
Nigga, please, your skull missing now homie feel the breeze
These bullets burning gon' be hard for you to breathe
These bullets burning damn near 'possible to bleed
Off that alcohol, that nozzle flammable
Beef I prey on my preyer react like animal
Pussy, I split you like camel toe, my shoelaces matching my flannel
We be loading up ammo, y'all be making them channels
Yellow tape by them candles, gang members with killing sprees
On our agendas, real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Facial expressions say surrender
When that iron enter, lay back recline nigga
Access denied nigga, refrigerate Ziploc'n
And all genders, rather Crip or Piru hoes get it too

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Y'all really into talking, we with that bullshit
Them shots is steady sparking, we on that bullshit
Your hood gon' hear them sirens, we did that bullshit
My 50 niggas wilding, we 'bout that bullshit
You know Atlanta with that bullshit
New York to Miami with that bullshit
You know Chicago with that bullshit
Kansas City down to New Orleans with that bullshit
Texas to Alabama with that bullshit
Boston and cats from Philly with that bullshit

Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
In the two door through the night
I be zoned out living life

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
I'm mixin' apple juice and XO
That's the type of shit we be drinking on the West Coast
I stay open when the rest closed
I got the most game never said I had the best flows
Uh a real nigga and yo ex know
Mad you can't go everywhere that us vets go
When you see me out you just gotta pay respect though
From Benz, truck, coupes, lex-o's
I like shrimp in my pesto, ya girl kinda ugly but she got a nice chest tho
I'm so disrespectual, I'm not no fucking intellectual
I'm trying to get this money so I can get me a boat
And stay away from niggas that be dirty and broke
Cause a nigga like me won't be 30 and broke
And you gone lose your life if you think its a joke
Let that simmer down for you, im not nobody thats gone clown for you
I'mma make em put a mound on you, nigga I be all around town on you

[Hook]
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes

[Verse 2:Casey Veggies]
Dark shades in the party, ain't worried about nobody
Man that girl know she got it, I might get her nigga watch me
And I ain't just gone pull her, ima make that girl love me
But this world full of darkness im just trynna stay above it
I just need some inspiration, maybe some ventilation
Maybe I should stop racin' the hardest shit that im chasin'
Take it slow, slow and you use to letting it go
One thing that I learn is just a bunch of shit I dont know
I'm riding round town and I made a left at the store
Ran into a girl I know, got her new number fasho I said fasho, so
She heard a few of my songs and after that I proceed to run through a few of her thongs
I keep mental philosophies that I learned even at my home
Now I'm gone for the scrilla, mom on the phone let her know that i'll be home in December
Since I can remember I was on the grind so our home wouldn't be so cold in the winter
Till I get a whip with a chick with a grip and zip I can flip and a home I can lend her

[Hook]
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
I be zoned out, getting mine
What I'm worried bout shit is fine
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
In the two door through the night
I be zoned out living life

[Verse 3:Schoolboy Q]
Shit, shit, all I can do is me
Few coronas or blue moons and bet I got some weed
Top Dawg fuck a bitch scratch my balls and flee
Eat pills, now fufill your drills be all that you can be
Aw, place this product in ya bra stash, smash
Fuck the police as the lights flash, crash
Got away but shit it caught the dash
Turtle necks and long sleeves because my body tagged
So back to the beats cause I fucked up my lease
Rhymes increase release to the streets heat how you need
A gangsta thats sippin pink, need to see a shrink
Going insane im crazy, going ham in that pussy Miss Piggy
Dont eat it though Veggies, the cycle goes around a regulary, wait
Slide in the path a nigga dont phase me
Dos cuatro siete I keep my nueve

[Hook]
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
I be zoned out, getting mine
What I'm worried bout shit is fine
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
In the two door through the night
I be zoned out living life
[Verse 1: Jaybird the Purdy Boi]
Never thought I'd be rappin' on the cypher, this a blessin'
Never thought I'd be rappin' for Premier, this cat's a legend
Never thought I'd get picked out the whole country by Khaled
To rap on BET, guess he saw me as the best man
619 to 858 to 760 I'm reppin'
San Diego to all you foreign, Daygo's what we call it
Shout out to all the haters watchin' this
Eat a plate of blue waffle disease
Drink some water with some AIDS mix
I got lines that Holly hookers wanna sniff
Flow is poetic justice, make Janet recite the lyrics I spit
Who hotter than me? You hotter than who?
All Eyez On Me, I'm way 2Pac-er than you
Man I murder beats for a living, I murder the competition
Celebrate it, dancin' like Serena at the olympics
Y'all put me on national TV, thinkin' I wouldn't show out?
Man I'mma take over like Jay-Z, I'mma rock out

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Grab your Slurpee and popcorn, I'm bout to make it hot for 'em
They didn't even invite me to this shit, man I just walked on
If I didn't come, then every bit of hope for rap is all gone
I'm ill, in the past you thought I wasn't, but you thought wrong
"Hop I lost respect for you, I'm pissed and you just lost a fan
All you do is diss, I'll never bump your album "Raw" again"
If what I say gets on your last nerve, then holla man
But truth is, y'all can't touch me like Pac's hologram
Don't dare to try it if you scared of dyin'
I'm terrifyin', the real Boogie Man, who even got your parents hidin'
When you're sleeping, I'll find your window, and just stare inside it
I'm a animal, momma raised me inside a lair with lions
Prepare for violence, Funk Volume's an unfair alliance
We embarrass giants, and rip mic's till we get laryngitis
My wave's sitting like a sandstorm, and I know what you mad for
Cause I'm living my dream, and yours

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Dropped out of school and became richer
Retired from the pliers, kept balling like I'm a clipper
Black hoodies, black bitches and black Benzes
She know these chains fit, so now she want my forensics
Got love for my city, shout out to Kendrick
October 22nd, the album, so go and get it
Look, turn a good kid to wig city, I serve plenty
Shoot til the chamber and clip empty, that's real crippy
Have a shirt, and my knuckles smothered with hate powder
Die and go to hell, and have the devil getting higher
How ironic that we smoking fire, gangsta rap Messiah
Mid-20's but 20 racks an hour
Bucket hats and designer beans, the Bosselini
Young slimmy, your chance see me?, your chance skinny
(?) placed rappers get paid pennies
A million off of tour this year because of all this talk about Romney
Iffy, Puffy

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
My flow is captivating, Magic Chick is watching this and masturbating
Basket cases, spitting in yo picnic, better pack a lunch
Chop 'em down, bag 'em up, Bill Murray, Daffy Duck
Yeah my squad the illest, y'all a little fishy, halibut
Chickens acting ratchet get split open with this hatchet
We the kids that causing racket with that automatic riot shit
Irises is violent, air balloon, we high as heck
Play the violin, fucking models wearing Iverson's
This my moment, don't blow it like my old chick
You the type to still tuck your shirt behind your phone clip
Whoa, and I think I might need a lawyer
Hov bout to have me killed for trying to talk to Rita Ora
I'm sorry that's just extra there
I'm going crazy like Clint Eastwood iat the empty chair
Keep your eyes peeled, running through a mine field
Even Lord Finesse will tell you I'm ill

[Verse 5: Mystikal]
Mystikal flex your style on em, transform and get wild on em
Growl at em, "Rah"
Trukfit nigga you a monster, you out the attic
Yeah scare a nigga, "Rah"
I sit your stupid ass down wherever on the side
Let a real nigga back in this bitch, get it live
Off of that performance, y'all might consider a different job
That ain't gon' cut it partna, at least you tried
How many niggas can't spell live cause they tired?
Some of them think that they the shit but they not
Move to the Shakers, make it happen when they pound
Hustles out to get it bustin', layin' on they side
Big Truck, Cash Money rapping Baboon
Ya auntie and ya momma know bout that (?) fool
Your grandpa and your grandma heard that (?) rule
White boys and white girls gon' buy that (?)
[Produced by Havoc]

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Most of these niggas shouldn't be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Zany imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Your wig'll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap pillers, gangbangers, and dealers
Streets keep watching, aye, click boom the ghetto bird get shot down
Straight to the top now, they want a third strike on my background
But nah homie, put the mask on when I slide on 'em
Put the cash in the safe and here's a extra slug 'fore I shake
You smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet a wet break on a plate
Burning your faith, all your senses covered in tape
Fuckin' with them boys in blue, chill out before I send them rags at you
You running to the cops saying, "How we do?"
Saying it's just rap and them lines ain't true
So I just do Q, fuck it, a ménage à two, or maybe trois
Baby girl need a papa, I be her dada
Coochie smacking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, with Oxymoron, Rock

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I ain't no backpack rapper, I ain't no lyricist
And if we ain't talking to you, mind your business then
Cold with it, Black Hippy, yeah, we cold niggas
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us
They bones quiver, heard some clown throwing stones at us
Holding boulders champ once you hear that "YAWK," watching domes shatter
It's Top Dawg we runnin' rap, whack rappers, feline
Reason why we don't run with cats
Nine double O five nine, where my family at
Pull up in that family van holding tools like the handyman
And to be real not with all this rapping politickin'
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
'Til I'm finished, 'til I make a couple tickets
Then I'm outtie on them islands with my crimmies chillin'
Hide your feelings, now can I live?
Look I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
Cause everywhere I go they like "When you dropping some work?"
Been a threat since birth
The rap game's pallbearer when I'm droppin' the hearse
I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Industry's nightmare, red strings in my Nike Airs
Yeah, the white pair, I'm Jay Rock, America's most wanted
My charges? Killing MC's without warning
Rock!

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
It's Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, I'm the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing a sticky
All odds against me, still even the score
Probably why I'm always OT on tour
TDE, believe me we want war
I don't even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, two triggers, what's the difference?
We all gon' die one day, until then I'm gettin' paid
My grandma watching so I ain't gon' curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse, backwood full of OG
Bobby Johnson medicine in my soul to trynna dodge the coffin
And these days are so bittersweet
I guess it's just a balance we battle naturally
And y'all still trippin' off of Jay-Z tweets
I still got laps to run when me and Jay-Z meet
Peep, Soul brother number two
The first one used to make beats for CL Smooth
Top got the S550 but the CL smooth
And rolling weed is the only time I see L's move
Soul!

[Verse 4: Isaiah Rashad]
I think I found my second home
Sunny California and it's your little nigga brother
You ain't meant for corners, it's what they told me
So I never looked back, I got a shell in the bag
Fat as elephant ass, so we flirt in the path
Passing propellers I tell her, tell her we flying just listen
See we diamond just shining and they gon' find us glistening
Brought sand to the beach and we left with your bitch
For the record in Guinness I'm a hecklin' menace
Where is Robin, I'm Given', fuckin' minding my business
He a regular victim, of some regular in women
Regular niggas, you always cater to sluts
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk
I put your motherfuckin' dream in your face
You keep lookin' for some women to be all in your face
That deep dussy reach niggas, keep dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a nigga be dussy
You can never rap better than me, cause you ain't dedicated
You ain't underrated, you ain't  underlooked
You ain't overbooked, you just undercooked
It's supposed to be me and my niggas in the record book
Now they got me out here by myself still fresh as fuck

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
I hate y'all, I'd do anything to replace y'all, shout out to Face Mob
A ghetto boy 'til I'm unemployed with a day job
And kicking boxes, I kick ass and then kick knowledge
I'm way more polished than 99% of the scholars you thought had graduated
I'm the master that masturbated on your favorite emcee
Until the industry had wanted me assassinated
You either corny or an opportunist
I let you eat, now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
What I been doing? I'm about to crack the Da Vinci Code
Yeah, and nothing's been the same since they dropped Control
And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you, high-five
I'm bulletproof, your shots'll never penetrate
Pin a tail on a donkey, boy, you been a fake
I got my thumb on Hip Hop, and my foot in the back of your ass
Aftermath get the last laugh
I serve niggas like master Geoffrey
Jump on the curb, turn a shotty to a verb if you let me
You know I'm a killer, I'm on your head, you know I'm a killer
The West Coast Cosa Nostra under oath 'til it's over
You over owe us, so what the fuck?
I fuck you niggas up, I fuck you niggas up, she suck and fuck
I fuckin' duck you fuckin' niggas like when I want
You go at us, you going fuckin' nuts
Acting irrational, pop you then pop an Adderall
Know the drill like a lateral, nigga
I'm more Pappy Mason than Pastor Mason
Pacing back and forth, racing my thoughts on embracing Daytons
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
I feel like some of y'all is hating
Quite frankly your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick?
Accidents never happen when murder's involved
Emaculate tactics so follow me, if you need me just call on me
I say "Hold up, wait a minute
Your career ain't shit unless you got some Kendrick in it!"
Your pussy ain't shit, ain't no room is left on my dick
Unless you look like Jordin Sparks, make my mark on the clitoris, muah
Hollywood's been good to me, lil' hood nigga used to pawn mom's jewelry
Family jewels big as fuck and I got the balls to say it
Balls deep, ballin' out 'til Spalding need a replacement
I'm outchea, the West in your mouth, chea
Invest in the vests of Vietnam vets when you out near
The white court building spilling its Merlot
Fillin' women, a Virgo, pimp the industry
Remember these Stacy Adams and furcoats
Shook, you're scared to death, you're scared to look
In the mirror when Kendrick is near you
King, Kendrick
Verse 1:
Everytime that I wake up, I swear I'm never down
Even when I'm in my dreams, I'm high off self esteem
Blowin' on that Jamaica my nigg its not a ting, marijuana fiend
Keep your Black N Milds and cigs cuz me no nicotine
I keep my pimpin' mean
Me and Musa as we pulled up on them sixes just to go and bust some bitches
See them motherfuckin' wheels, sex appeal
And if I'm in the backseat with them tints, that Glock concealed
They eye us as we peel like the, orange hat that I be stylin' in
Like a zanny or a klonopin
All your swishers, they be model thin
We plus size, nigga!
Like Tocarra and them, shining like a halogen
So bright, like highbeams, headlights and midnight
That one of Rhode Island's watchtower sights
Yeahh, the world is all I need
But if you don't know anything just know I got some weed

Chorus
Bet I got some weed
(x2)
You don't know anything? Just know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
(x2)
Ain't got no money mayne, but bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
(x6)

Verse 2:
Let's go chill up on my balcony and feel the breeze
Open up a corona and see who got some weed
If we don't have no trees then let's gather up the fees
Hundred dollars, that's a seventh of the sour D
Make a order it'll be here a quarter to three
Smoke it till we on E
Then we fill up again with another 10
Then we just go run back to the cheese fulfill our, family needs
No worries, smoke one for our G's that ran with a strike of 3's
We dyin' up in every plea
So for ya'll my niggas swear to god my heart will bleed
Kick the shit for my lifers and ones who kickin' seas
Even if it's just 5 dollars keep your brain on free
Elevate your mind cuz in due time you wine and dine
Something fine in that
Kush blunts soon be your valentine and my shit be Columbine
My fans is all I need
But If you don't know anything just know I got some weed

Chorus
Bet I got some weed
(x2)
You don't know anything? Just know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
(x2)
Ain't got no money mayne, but bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
(x6)

*shout outs till the end*
[Verse 1: SchoolBoy Q]
Straight to the block, to the hood, to a spot
Cocaine to a rock, duece duece in a sock
Every dollar closer to a drop
Every drop is closer to a cop
Every cop is closer to a cell
Hit the cell your ticket right to hell
No job, no bail
No fam, no mail
Institution another nigga fail
Go from pussy to a prison tale
Fuck that, I quit while I'm ahead
Ship my music off with Amistad
Turn it up and here the ghetto pledge
Live righteous nigga like my brother said
King Tut, Martin Luther, Malcolm X, but ima shoota'
Top ramen, knowledge for the noodle
Finally gettin' praised
Yeah kudos
Doing bad, still love the need
Connect said it's something up his sleeve
Said, I rather bust off them keys
Yeah nigga birds and the beez

[Bridge: Schoolboy Q]
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

[Verse 2: SchoolBoy Q]
Wanna do a song, but its hard to carry on
And my daughter hungry sitting home
And my girl said she feeling lone
I can't tell its over in her tone
Only time I call is for a loan
She be stressing, so depressing
Always worried every time a lil nigga gone
Stay strong for the future, stick together, yeah suture
Get a couple wipps, yeah kunta
Schoolboy but gangsta was his tutors
Say money be the root of evil, look around and see what it do to people
Veins full of heroin using pcp inject the body with a needle
Lord help us, swear to god, dope dealers, get a job
Keep it real this shit ain't really cool, being in a cell, you ain't alive
Niggas quick to show out over cheese, love to help the devil do a deed
So I rather bust of them keys? yeah nigga birds and the beez

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change

(Kendrick Lamar)
Q I wanna see you do your thang
Entertainment business living limelight
Hop on every track and move them trains
Show these motherfuckers that you been tight, then they ever been
Its evident that you intelligent but you can't escape that life
And for you my nigga
I would sacrifice myself to make it just to see you hold the mic
And hit the stage and rock the set
But its hard to change when your from the set
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death
Like a cracker would like to hang you by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them run way jets
Fly to Singapore one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to god, its hard out here for a young black men to live
If you dont do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
My nigga won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter
Please dont let her grow up life without a father
Look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy
All she need is love, put that shit aside
At the same time know they got to eat
Know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HTC, no a.c
And the block hot, you keep runnin', cop say freeze
Blue pill, red pill, choose now, birds or the beez

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro]
Count my change
Count my change
