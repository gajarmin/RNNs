[Intro: Miguel]
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

[Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout "that's supposed to be you, girl"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

[Hook]

[Bridge: Miguel]
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

[Hook]
[Khaled] DJ Khaled!
[T-Pain] Hey! Yeah
[Khaled] We the best!

[Hook: T-Pain]
All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go UP
And they stay there, and they stay there
And they stay there - up down up down up down
Cause all I do is WIN, WIN, WIN
And if you goin in put yo' hands in the air, make 'em stay there!

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Yeah, listen, LUDA!
Ludacris goin in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down
I never went nowhere, but they sayin' "Luda's back"
Blame it on that conjure, the hood call it Luda 'gnac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down, like strippers' booties go
My verses still be servin, tight like a million virgins
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out, y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year (yeah) the South's champion (yeah)
Cause all I do, all I - all I - all I - all I do is
AY, WOO!

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Rick Ross]
Win, win, who? Boss
Boss, swervin in my lo-lo
Head on the swivel, you know serving me's a no-no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger, they see it they say "oh boy"
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo'-fo'
Ask you what you laughing at - represent that mud life!
Dirty money bitch you better get yo' mud right!
We come together holdin' hands and holla "thug life"
We all strapped in all black, it's like fuck life (all we do is win!)
You riding to what (WHAT!) cause we riding tonight (tonight!)
Now she riding with me cause you wasn't riding her right
Ross!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg]
Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water gettin boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of 'em, bust 'til I burst 'em up
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, boss 'em up
Pardon me, I'm bossing up, pressure up, bless you bruh
Don't mess with us, we like the U in the 80's
Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track, bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, "Just win baby, win!"

[Intro]
Oh whoa [3x]

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I’ll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said "there’s another," looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like:

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby ooh
Thought you’d always be mine

[Verse 2: Justin Beiber]
For you I would have done whatever
And I just can’t believe we ain’t together
And I want to play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'd buy you anything, I'd buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me and you shake me
Till you wake me from this bad dream
I’m going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around
And I’m like:

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, no-one could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck
She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, I skip a beat
When I see her in the street, and
At school on the playground
But I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, because she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

[Hook]
[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with me y'all

[Hook: Ludacris]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale that's usin' a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for $free.99
Later on I might charge for menage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug
She asked "Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?"
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give ME some head, that'll really piss him off

[Hook: Ludacris]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the four dot six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
"K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam"
So say my name like Candyman
And I'mma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

[Hook: Ludacris]

[Outro]
"And you say Chi city?" scratched repeatedly
[Intro: Usher (Lil Jon)]
Usher (Lil Jon, Ludacris!)

Baby how you doing? Hope that you're fine

Got me feenin' like Jodeci, girl I can't leave you alone
Take a shot of this here Patron and it's gon' be on
V-I-P done got way too crowded
I'm about to end up callin it a night
She should holla at your girl tell her that you're shaking the scene
Pulled off beep beep shotgun in the GT with me
She said, "Ohhhhh! I'm ready to ride
(I was like) Yeah
Cause once you get inside, you can't change you mind
Don't mean to sound impatient but you gotta promise baby
Ooh!!

[Hook: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Ohh! I gotta know baby, oh yea)
Tell me again (Make sure you're right, oh before we began)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Ohh! Oh it's a good look baby)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It's a really good look baby, look here

Sometime wanna be your lover sometime wanna be your friend
Sometime wanna hug hold hands slow dance while the record spins
Opened up your heart cause you said I made you feel so comfortable
Used to play back then now you all grown up like Rudy Huxtable
I could be your +Bud+ you could beat me up
Play fight in the dark then we both make up
I do, anything just to feel yo butt
Why you, got me so messed up
I don't know but you gotta stop tripping
Be a good girl now turn around and get these whippings
You know you like it like that
You don't have to fight back here's a pillow bite that
And I'll be setting separate plays
So on all these separate days your legs can go they separate ways

[Hook: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Ohh! its a good look baby)
Tell me again (Tell me over and over and over again)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Make sure you're right before you choose)

[Verse 3: Lil Jon]
I's been knowing you for a long time (shawty)
But fucking never crossed my mind (shawty)
But tonight I seen something in you (shawty)
That made me wanna get with you (shawty)
You ain't been nothing but a friend to me (shawty)
And a nigga never ever dreamed we'd be (shawty)
Up in here kissing, hugging, squeezing, touching (shawty)
Up in the bathtub rub-a-dubbing (shawty)
Are you sure you wanna go this route (shawty)
Let a nigga know before I pull it out (shawty)
I would never ever cross the line (shawty)
Shawty let me hear you tell me one more time
One more time

[Hook: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Ohh, it's a good look baby)
Tell me again (Make sure you're right oh before we leave)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Tell me over and over and over again)

[Bridge: Usher]
Ah, ah, oooooooo
Ah, ah, oooooooo
Ah, ah, oooooooo, yeaaaah

[Outro: Ludacris & (Lil Jon)]
Please tell your lovers and friends
That Ursher, Jon and Luda had to do it again (heyy!!)
Uh, please tell your lovers and friends

That's right, yeah, please tell your lovers and friends

[Usher]
Peace up, A-Town down

[Verse 1: Usher]
I was up in the club with my homies, tryin' to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key
You should know how it feels
I seen shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear
You would think that she knew me
I decided to chill
Conversation got heavy
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
She's sayin', come get me
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, baby let's go
When I told her, I said

[Hook: Usher]
Yeah, shorty got down low said, come and get me
Yeah, I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah, her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
Yeah, next thing I knew, she was all up one me screamin', yeah

[Verse 2: Usher]
She's all up in my head now
Got me thinkin' that it might
Be a good idea to take her with me
Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave)
And I got to keep it real now
Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that's just ain't me
Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way's she Get Low
I'm like, yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave
And I say

[Hook: Usher]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And roar, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'mma milk the cow
And forget about game, I'mma spit the truth
I won't stop till I get 'em in their birthday suit
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin', then I put em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris fill cups like double D's
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed that say

[Hook: Usher]

[Outro: Ludacris]
Take that and rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go clap
Take that, rewind it back
Ursher got the voice make your booty go clap
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go clap
Take that, rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go clap
[Hook - Ludacris]
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Oh no! The fight's out

Get the fuck back, guard your grill
There's something wrong, we can't stay still
I've been dranking and busting too
And I been thanking of busting you
Upside your motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in, they'll be mo' dead
Causing confusion, Disturbin' Tha Peace
It's not an illusion, we running the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and gold diggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? No nigga!
I'm doing a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the fuck outta my way
I'm D.U.I., hardly ever caught sober
And you abouts to get ran the fuck over

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Mystikal]
Here I come, here I go
Uh oh, don't jump bitch: move!
You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin' crowd?
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down
I fuck the crowd up - that's what I do
Young and successful - a sex symbol
The bitches want me to fuck 'em - true, true
Hold up, wait up, shorty
Oh what's up, getting my dick sucked, what are you doing
Sidelining my fuckin' business
Trying to get my paper, child support suing
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fucking TV's and jewelry bitch, tell me that
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'mma tell you like this bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - I-20]

Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggas
We on the dance floor, throwing bows, beating up niggas

[Infamous 2-0]
I started with ten mack tens
And ten clips and ten pens
Got ten times richer in the span of ten years
Bitch I'm ten times two on a scale of one to ten
I'll battle ten crews with the strength of ten men

[Fate Wilson]
At nine, I was into crime, sex, and drugs
Pushin' an '89 Box Chevy sittin' on dubs
Nine thugs all ski masks, black suited with gloves
Break the imprinted chest with at least nine slugs

[Ludacris]
Man I ate eight clips with eight chicks
Watching eight flicks
You's 8-6 if you ate pussy with fake lips
I figure eight when my mind goes in circles
DID I DO THAT or was it Mystikal and Urkel?

[Infamous 2-0]
On to 7 Ak 47, so what?
I got seven hoes stoppin' by at seven to fuck
Then put seven in your chest seven days a week
And add a foot for good measure you'll be seven feet deep

[Hook]
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score

[Fate Wilson]
I got six hoes distributing on six blocks
It's blistering from cops tryna stop these rocks from distributing
Six gun shots left
One pint of Vodka before this pimp will hit
It's street justice, now it's six hole in your casket

[Ludacris]
Give me a high five and I'll put that nine lower than your esophagus
Then smack you so hard that you have to come with 2Pacalypse
Five stars, twenty rims, five cars
I'd add more but I had to subtract one from five bars

[Infamous 2-0]
I got four forty-fours on a rip on the floor
For you niggas talkin' shit
I'm fixin' to show you what for
I did four months in the bing instead of a hearse
Now it's DTP for life, dog for better or worse

[Fate Wilson]
I fuck three best friends
Ran on all three the same game
In these streets I'm a murderer
I got three alias names
I'm three times insane
Three shots will cave your brain
On 3 fire and ready, cock back and aim

[Hook]
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score

[Ludacris]
I'm packing two twenty-twos and twice the ammunition
But at Friday the 13th
What's up now superstition?
I'm a two timer with a couple of twins
Double jeopardy
With a pair of two deuces in the two seater Benz

[Fate Wilson]
I got one motto get dough till your gone
I got one main lady the rest of y'all is hoes
I'm numero uno with one more before I go
If you think I ain't the one bitch you too slow

[Infamous 2-0]
And all you zero ass niggas ain't nothin' to me
Because I chop up O's, move dro', and chop keys
0-6 is my clique along with PC
Pretty Rick, Calil, V-Slim and Shondrez

[Ludacris]
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1
Ludacris, Fake Feeze, and that nigga I-Twun

So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score
[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
We're never done, we found a place where we belong
Don't have to stand alone, we'll never let you fall
Don't need permission to decide what you believe
And jump, down on Jump Street

[Hook: Angel Haze]
Jump, down on Jump Street
Say jump, down on Jump Street
Say jump, down on Jump Street
Say jump, down on Jump Street

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Work hard, play hard
You may not wanna quit your day job
Undercover, on the loose
Don't let 'em recognize your face card
This king shit, the team equipped
We 'bout to empty out like three clips
Got a mean grip on this street tip
Tearin' up the club like 3-6
We out of control, all over the place
And somebody gotta put it to a stop, quick
Out on the road and all up in your face
You better know we steady lookin' for the drop, bitch
Yeah they'll crack the case and yeah they gotta crack it fast
They're the Jump Street and 'bout to jump up in your ass
This the special unit that's designed to keep it quiet
We infiltrate the dealers and we find the damn suppliers

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
Your friends'll be there when your back is to the wall
You'll find you need us cause there's no one else to call
When it was hopeless, the decision is what you need
You better be ready to, be ready to jump

[Hook: Angel Haze]

[Verse 4: Angel Haze]
Don't be afraid to die
A lot of bad guys should be afraid to die
Got Schmidt, Jenko, the whole damn crew
Same ole same ole with a whole lot of new
You know there can't be love without an inch of pain
It all goes hand in hand like yin and yang
In the city but I'm mothafuckin' sky high
Tryna find a new drug called WHYPHY
Wait, we just here tryna find us
Schmidt went lookin', 'til he found love
Got his life sweet, bon appetit
Spring break, bitch, throw a party on the beach
Shit did change, but all that means
Is that your real friends don't ever leave
Will it ever be complete?
Jump Street won't ever cease

Stupid retarded crib, and all my whips clean
Rockin' some Jays that don’t come out til 2015
I’m moonwalking bitch, yeah, I’m Michael Jackson +Thriller+ fresh
Slipped inside the +Mirror+, saw a pimp nigga in the flesh
Spray some Polo cologne, to match my Polo socks
Now Coke bottle bitches, make your soda pop
And drop it like I ain't ever seen you drop it before ho
Drop it for a legend or this DTP logo
Drop it for a little free marketing and promo
And let me Instagram this photo

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Scrolling through my Ho-lodex
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, let’s see what ho is next
So many to choose from, I can’t make up my mind
But whoever I pick better get up on the dick real quick, don’t waste my time
Cause I got shit to do, so I’m just bout to smash
Soon as I’m through with you, back to countin’ this cash
I’m hung low to all these women, I’m their antidote
And when they on my dick look like they riding a banana boat
But on they period, I don’t want them mislead
So it’s a sign by my bed that say “No turn on red”
Treating women like spades, I’m so unstoppable
Just tying to leave the club with 'bout 3 and I’m possible

[Hook]

[French Montana]
Luda! Hahhh

Coke Boys in the house, that cost a house
Disturbing The Peace, smoking that loud
Throw up 50 like nothin’ cause bitch I’m worth 20 Ms
Brick throwing got your bitch jumping like Shawn Kemp
Got a neck full of gold, fresh out the 'lympics (bling)
Stack never fold, pussy clap on the pole
Louis tax counting mills, Louis on that field
Coming fresh out the corner, now he on that hill
With your, bitch, blowin', smoke, nigga
I ain’t, gang, bangin', but Luda, that’s my, folk, nigga
9 times out of ten, house money I spend
Take your bitch and her friends, MONTANA!

It seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears

Sheep skin on the rug, +Golden Grain+ on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride

Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I LOVE TO PARK IT
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the petal to the floor, radar in the GRILLE
TV in the middle of my STEERING WHEEL
It's my car's birthday so we BLOWIN THEM CANDLES
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
Cuz the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so F what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a FUCKIN BIRD
And the fools, we gon CLOCK ONE and we'll POP ONE
Cuz my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun

[Hook: Ludacris]
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL
Now them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth
BOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL
If anyone talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'm gon do? ACT A FOOL

[Ludacris]
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is TIPSY
Off the off ramp doin about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin and we startin SHIT
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire cuz we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and beez that's fantastic
So gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a +Change of Heart+
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm ABOUT TO BLOW THIS WHOLE SHIT UP TO SMITHEREENS

[Hook: Ludacris]
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL
MAN, THAT AIN'T STICKY, THAT'S JUST STICKS AND STEAMS

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You're beautiful, beautiful, you should know it
Beautiful, beautiful, you should know it
I think it's time, think it's time that you show it
You're beautiful, beautiful

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Baby what you doin', where you at? Where you at?
Why you acting so shy, holdin' back, holdin' back
We're not the only ones doin' it like that, it like that
So DJ, bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back
Cause all around the world people want to be loved
Yeah, cause all around the world they're no different than us
All around the world people want to be loved
All around the world they're no different than us
All around the world-world-world
All around the world-world-world

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You're crazy girl, crazy girl, you should know it
You're crazy girl, crazy girl, don't control it
Light it up, light it up so explosive
Crazy girl, yeah yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, once again, the dynamic duo is back at it
JB, Luda
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itchin' for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it then don't give in
Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

[Hook]
[Khaled] DJ Khaled!
[T-Pain] Hey! Yeah
[Khaled] We the best!

[Hook: T-Pain]
All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go UP
And they stay there, and they stay there
And they stay there - up down up down up down
Cause all I do is WIN, WIN, WIN
And if you goin in put yo' hands in the air, make 'em stay there!

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Yeah, listen, LUDA!
Ludacris goin in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down
I never went nowhere, but they sayin' "Luda's back"
Blame it on that conjure, the hood call it Luda 'gnac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down, like strippers' booties go
My verses still be servin, tight like a million virgins
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out, y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year (yeah) the South's champion (yeah)
Cause all I do, all I - all I - all I - all I do is
AY, WOO!

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Rick Ross]
Win, win, who? Boss
Boss, swervin in my lo-lo
Head on the swivel, you know serving me's a no-no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger, they see it they say "oh boy"
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo'-fo'
Ask you what you laughing at - represent that mud life!
Dirty money bitch you better get yo' mud right!
We come together holdin' hands and holla "thug life"
We all strapped in all black, it's like fuck life (all we do is win!)
You riding to what (WHAT!) cause we riding tonight (tonight!)
Now she riding with me cause you wasn't riding her right
Ross!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg]
Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water gettin boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of 'em, bust 'til I burst 'em up
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, boss 'em up
Pardon me, I'm bossing up, pressure up, bless you bruh
Don't mess with us, we like the U in the 80's
Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track, bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, "Just win baby, win!"

[Hook]
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I've got hoes
In different area codes
Hoes! In different area codes

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Now you thought I was just 7-7-0, and 4-0-4?
I'm worldwide, bitch act like y'all don't know
It's the abominable ho man
Globe-trot international post man
Neighbor-dick dope man
7-1-8's, 2-0-2's
I send small cities and states I-O-U's
9-0-1, matter of fact 3-0-5
I'll jump off the G4, we can meet outside
So control your hormones and keep your drawers on
'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bones
3-1-2's, 3-1-3's (oh)
2-1-5's, 8-0-tree's (oh)
Read your horoscope and eat some hors d'oeuvres
10 on pump one; these hoes is self serve
7-5-7, 4-1-0's, my cell phone just overloads

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ludacris]
Now every day is a ho-ly day, so stop the violence and put the 4-4 away
Skeet, shoot a ho today
5-0-4, 9-7-2's
7-1-tree, whatcha gon' do?
You checking out the scene, I'm checking a ho tonight
With perpendicular, vehicular ho-micide
3-1-4, 2-0-1 (hey)
Too much green, too much fun (hey)
I bang cock in Bangkok
Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot, think not
I'm the Thrilla in Manila, schlong in Hong Kong
Pimp 'em like Bishop, Magic, Don Juan
Man after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the motherfuckin' phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big ass sack
I'm slanging this dick like a New Jack

[Nate Dogg]
Is it cause they like my gangsta walk?
Is it cause they like my gangsta talk?
Is it cause they like my handsome face?
Is it cause they like my gangsta ways?
Whatever it is, they love it and they just won't let me be
I handles my biz, don't rush me, just relax and let me be free
Whenever I call (I call), come running
2-1-2 or 2-1-3
You know that I ball (I ball), stop fronting
Or I'll call my substitute freak (hoes)

[Hook]

[Outro - Ludacris]
9-1-6, 4-1-5, 7-0-4
Shout out to the 2-0-6
Everybody in the 8-0-8
Ha-ah, 2-1-6, 7-0-2, 4-1-4
3-1-7, 2-1-4's and the 2-8-1's
3-3-4, 2-0-5, I see ya
Uh-uh, 3-1-8, 6-0-1's, 2-0-tree
8-0-4, 4-0-2, 3-0-1
9-0-4, 4-0-7, 8-5-0
7-0-8, 5-0-2
Hoes in different area codes, know that
Southern Hoes-pitality, Northern Exhoes-ure
Ha-ha, ho ridin' on the West coast
Ya understand what I'm saying?
Ho-cus pocus, you the dopest
Hoes to the right, hoes to the left, 5 hoes this time
Whoo! Ho no!
The Hip-hop ho-ller-coaster, that's what we on right now
Ha-ha, no need to get all ho-stile
Def Jam South baby, Disturbing Tha Peace
Jazze Pheezy, Uncle Face
Ludacris, uh, hoes...(*whistling*) I'm sweating like a motherf
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm obnoxious, I'm flowing crazy, I need to stop this
Don't knock this, you niggas lazy ya'll need to watch this
Preposterous if you can fathom how you can block this
My phantom was seen on Candler, you ride the transit
No options you niggas can't act like ya'll forgot this
I'm tired but switch ya flow up, it's so monotonous
It's my metropolis, I'll drop a 12 on ya so colossus
My swag plus my drop top yellow jag why they gossip
I'm the nigga upload your twitter, bitch I'm the topic
Profess it but Gucci didn't graduate from college
Your girlfriend says my ear rings are erotic
My lambo doors open upward they're robotic
It's Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (gucci)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Drop beam, off set things, color ice cream
White dreams, she can fuck me, that's a pipe dream
X-O, poppin' x-pills so exciting
My ex chick and ex homeboy uninvited
Cases of Ace of Spade, bitch getcha wasted
The waitress, I made her reload it like the Matrix
I lean laid with a bad bitch Black and Asian
On 20, headed to Buckhead, I'm racing baby
But take that fake jewelry off, that shit is fugazi
You think that you're hotter than the kid you're mistaken
Real and you niggas really really good at fakin'
So trill, I'mma keep it real, I'm back to the basics

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Heads up, my partner stashin' bricks up on his roof top
Whole key, half a key, quarter key
Gucci got more quarters than a motherfuckin' juke box
Pop-pop hear the Glock cock, and I gotta Colt 45 like Billy D
Semi automatic that I keep up in the attic and a shank that shape like Tennessee (ugh!)
I cut ya, I cut ya to the white meat
And my partner pushin' more crack than a bike seat
I smoke the best, I get my dro from California
Get high and go to sleep you couldn't wake me from a coma
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma
But these niggas ain't got no heart not even if they had a donor
I roam the streets, so who the fuck is you?
Southside, Collipark, king of the jungle
My name is Ludacris, living in Atlanta zoo

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Intro]
Oh whoa [3x]

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I’ll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said "there’s another," looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like:

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby ooh
Thought you’d always be mine

[Verse 2: Justin Beiber]
For you I would have done whatever
And I just can’t believe we ain’t together
And I want to play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'd buy you anything, I'd buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me and you shake me
Till you wake me from this bad dream
I’m going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around
And I’m like:

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, no-one could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck
She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, I skip a beat
When I see her in the street, and
At school on the playground
But I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, because she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

[Hook]
Big Bada boom, Luda’s in this bitch
Pussy niggas clear the room
I came through the door, I said it before
I’m the truth in this booth and you niggas all hoes
Counterfeit rappers say I’m stealing their flows
But I can’t steal what you never made up bitch
Y’all some duplicate rap cloning niggas
I manufacture you hoes -- put on your makeup, bitch
Let me explain, nothing’s been new since Big Daddy Kane
Flows will get recycled passed around to different names
But what’s the same, that every verse I spit is insane
Got more styles than any rapper in the game, 11 years and still counting
And y'all get a couple hit records, make some noise and have the nerve to start shouting
Who’s gassing ‘em, they blowing smoke up your ass, you fired up but I’m just puff puff passing ‘em
Until they roaches, buried in my ashtray
Nigga burn slow, better pray like it’s your last day
You lying to yourself, just admit it
May not like the way I use it but you know you ain't invent it boy
Do your research before you make a claim so bogus
That's disrespecting pioneers in the game
Fuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes
Then you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants
See I’m ya past, I’m ya future and ya present
So watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend
16 times platinum, 6 number 1 peaks
So I can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week
You’s weak, softer than the Pillsbury dough boy
Don’t make me expose the truth, you’s a ho, boy
Don’t make me get on that "Stomp" shit and get back at it
You rappers ain't even in my fucking tax bracket
Why am I wasting my time
Yeah I admit I get a little ludicrous with my rhymes, sometimes
But my fans know the difference because “My Chick Bad” went platinum
Still winning, motherfucker

The nerve of you niggas man
You ain't got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy
Fall back in formation, y’all outta line
I was told not to kill a mosquito with a cannon
So the next time you gnats got a real problem
Don’t be a coward like a nigga that used to be signed to me going on twitter rants and shit
Nigga, say it to my face
[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or ugh..
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley, Bentley

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Shawty look at my Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Bentley, Benz or Beamer
The four door or the two seater
She’s all on me with no breather
My cologne's exotic reefer
And the chrome wheel is my sneakers
750 full body clap a plastic ke-ke-keep her
This is ether the brand new speaker
My girls a diva, me and lisa, Rosé and Keisha
Lets take things deeper, peddle pusher
Tire screaching you can’t ask girl to freeze her
He’s a pinky ring from freezing
And a hundred dollar season
New GT, millimeter. Get too close you’ll get my fever
Throw throw throw up as I roll up
Windows rolled up blowing reefer
Don’t compare me to no jacker I originate the flow
The flow is so unusual, nothing you have seen before

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Get in my Beamer, Benz or Bentley
My pockets never empty
I got dead animals on and every dead president with me
But I’m all about them Benjamins
All about them C-notes
Suck it til it’s dry, my pockets' got a deep throat
Always was a hustler, never was a fool
Always go that work but I never finished school
Honor roll lifestyle, nigga get your grades up
Highest in my class because I stayed down and blazed up
Graduated from the thousands to the milli’s
We drinking Conjure we graduated from the Henny
And now I got my night cap driving with my night shades
Call me a jerk but I ain't going through that tight phase
Clothes still baggy enough to let my nuts hang
Ludacris, I’m built Ford tough like a mustang
DTP I got my whole crew with me
Pull up on your bitch look her in the eye and then I say get in my...

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]

[Verse 3: The Dream]
Look at what I’m driving
Shorty you should be beside me
I’m gonna be your provider
I heard you a rider
Like a pony!
Tell me what you gon' do
Tell me what you want, boo
Hit the car lot, buy what we want to
Lloyd want to know what kind of car you choose
And after that I’mma drop a stack on them shoes
Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Gucci, Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Gucci, Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Gucci, Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Tell me, tell me what you want babe, tell me what you want babe

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
You know I keep the choppers in the cellar
There’s nothing you can tell us
If it ain the M its the GT or the CLS
You ain't got to see us, if we there you can inhale us
You either or niggas
You either broke or either jealous
Been a problem since niggas is rocking perry ellis
They really just don’t like us cause they wifeys wanna nail us
Just like we from Portland cause we blazing in their trailers
So we sharper than propellers
We sparking them vanillas
The Larkins and Barrettas, the narks is tryna get us
But we only getting chedder so we down for the whatever
The grass is even greener, the water’s even wetter
Maybach flying spur, new 7 even better

[Modified Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or UGH

[Verse 5: Yo Gotti ]
I bought a set of twenties for my very first Benz
And then I left the club with my baby momma's friends
Back in '03 getting head behind ten
Club parking lot I never want this night to end
Mr. Cocaine got it, all I do is set trends
White on white Lambo with the fishscale fins
Yankee blue top, Yankee blue fitted
D on my block like I’m from New York city
If it ain't a Bentely it’s a beamer
Keep a chopper or a Nina
Keep a cutlass up a Chevy
Trunk sound like a arena
If it’s g-unit and it’s thug gang and Mr. Coca-ina
All the cars foreign cause they Bentley, Benz or Beamers

[Outro: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Bent, bent, be, Bently
[Intro]
Uh, mic check 1-2 (Go get 'em)
Listen close, nigga, yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, if rappers want it, they can get it
Flow tighter than four fat bitches sittin' in a Civic
My flows are unimaginable, Hannibal Lecter shit
Eatin' emcees for breakfast, bitch
Since I was born to touch the mic
The first time it's been a problem
Your life was a mistake
Your pops should've wore a condom
You niggas think you hard
I think you better come harder (Go hard)
I leave rappers confused like will.i.am barber
Ah, fuckin' with Luda's not a great look
A verse'll make your fans unfriend you on Facebook
Click, my styles are goin' into labor
So if stars won a war I'm their daddy like Darth Vader
And since I'm always high, it's kind of hard to overlook me
For over a hundred stacks, it's kind of hard to overbook me
And a whole 'nother house for my cars is on my checklist
Cause to fit 'em in one garage is like a nigga playin' Tetris
But they say patience is a virtue
Cause I got your bitch stayin' out way past her curfew
Guess I was a thief that got away with these words
Slangin' chickens out my whip like I been playin' Angry Birds
In a black Rolls Royce, Dark Knight like Batman
Everywhere you turn, the Ghost follows like Pac-Man
And I sleep with the John Dillinger
And always keep an eye half-open like Forest Whitaker
No, you boys ain't ready for combat
Be more worried if I renew my Def Jam contract
What path is he on? Opponents, I laugh and be gone
They handin' in the towels like they work in Bed, Bath & Beyond
But in the midst of all the melee
Y'all niggas just bitches with dicks like Sheneneh
Your rap styles are phony, your lines are just dead
And I be on them lines like a nigga just played
Guess I'm tryin' to say I'm advanced, you intermediate
You wouldn't know the real me if your bitch Wikipedia'd it
Just know that I never tried to be hard
Probably cause Mr. Glock 40's my security guard
You'll get chopped like judo
Gangs in my hood make you reverse
And change your color like the block's playin' Uno
And, yes, some of my friends is still sellin' them drugs
But I just say they Weight Watchers like Jennifer Hud
They show me love
That's why I'll always stay reppin' until the death of me
Rappers talk shit, but ain't nobody ever stepped to me
I hereby command all my fans' to inject it
Overdose on Red Bull in your veins if you ever slept on me
Yeah, my mind is sharper than a guillotine
All the nines extended from the knuckles of Wolverine
Not a X-Man, but, man, I got that X
Some of my artists switch labels, but I still get a cheque
The more albums they sell, the more we all win
And I can be seen in thirty rocks like Alec Baldwin
Or watchin' CBS in a Cadillac DTS
I plan to reach the world, man, your plan is MetroPCS
I changed my music up cause I was gettin' bored
You may not like the way I shoot, but my points go on the board
My name still engrained and these books will be the outcome
And this one verse is harder than a lot of niggas' albums

[Outro]
Peace, fuck out of here, rewind that shit
Ha-ha-ha, Luda, ain't shit changed
[Verse 1:Wale]
Uh! If I ain't ready to listen I'm never gonna listen
Most follow intuition while they wishing it would work
And my vision isn't perfect so I will never learn for it
Don't wish for some change like a church worker
Hallelujah, preacher I am not influenced
If I don't donate to your movement am I not improving?
And while the poor kill the poor for a portion
A piece of American society pie
I get high, the munchies I got so bear witness
I got this girl looking at you cause my reps kissing muah!
And I ain't ready to wait when there's dollars on the brain
Why would you expect

[Bridge:Wale]
Ain't shit changing but diapers on babies
Get higher than the background singers singing
Ain't shit changing but diapers on babies
Get higher than the background singers singing

[Hook:Mike Posner]
Yes I know it's been too long
Probably seems I'm always gone
Still don't know where I belong
Wrote this song
Heaven just a plane away
I know my mom, she can't wait
When I feel I've lost my way
Back home

[Verse 2:2 Chainz]
I said baby I’m ready, I got work on the Scale-y (Scale-y)
Still got it maid like I stayed at the telly!
OK, I know that you fear me
I won’t come down ‘til you feel it
Put your back in the flo', put your feet near the ceiling!
Now you know I’m the realest gotta handle my bidness
You got your girl on lock, I pay her conjugal visits
You know my campaign, I support strippers
Got a table of ones, I use pyrex for my dishes (TRUUU)
OK, I've been on my job, and they switched the position
Yeah, I got my ends up and it’s just the beginning!
You say you do it, I did it, and you know that I’m with it
I got a bitch in your city, that got a bitch in yo city!

[Bridge:Mike Posner]
It doesn't feel too much changed
I still get called my government name
Everything still feels the same
Still don't know where I belong

[Verse 3:Ludacris]
Listen, look I got feed my family by all means necessary
Cause paychecks are comin' up shorter than February
Can't get a real job, I never finished school
Can't get no new clothes, I wore the same tennis shoes
But now the game's changed, I'm all about the hustle
And even Hogan Knows Best, I'm all about the muscle
I'm all about my team, I'm all about my green
I'm 'bout supply and demand, I'm 'bout to serve the fiends
And I'm a workin dream, I keep the circuit clean
See I'm the FUCKIN FUTURE~! I'm a workin machine
Don't trust a soul,I turn 20 into 50
50 to a hundred and a hundred to a Bentley
A Bentley to a building and a building to a 'scraper
Can't keep up with the news but I get that Daily Paper
And youse a daily hater cause my foot game is major
After a while, crocodile, see you later alligator

[Bridge:Wale]
Ain't shit changing but diapers on babies
Get higher than the background singers singing
Huh singing.X3
Beep beep beep beep beep
Remix baby

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
Shorty been eyeing me (Valentino)
She looking like she thinking about trying me (Haha)
She want it she can't take no more (Yeah)
I'm about to take her to my spot
I'mma get it hot she going, she going... (And let me)
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep (Hahaha)
She gonna let me (Ooh)
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

I'mma have her screaming like
Go, go, go, go, go, go (Come with me)
I'mma have her screaming like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'mma tear it up

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, hahaha, LUDA
She told me that she wanted to knock my socks off
So I slid my three-thousand dollar crocs off
She got her rocks off, and I got the cops off
In my fire red lamborghini, hot sauce
I was just a block off of Peachtree and Pharr Road, hey
I scanned her over like her booty had a bar code, hey
I made the car fold (yup) and then the car slowed
Weeooo weeooo wee, I went into alarm mode, ooh
Cause she was badder than the baddest of the baddestess
Her butt was fatter than the fattest of the fattestess
And I was glad it is, see what the saddest is
So I can take her home and she'll see where the apparatus is
Hey, in my private pool, yup her body drips dry
She was bare foot, I did her in my flipflops
Ooh, tick tock, the clock goes boom
So we quickly Luda-christened every room
LUDA

[Hook: Bobby Valentino (Lil' Kim)]

Yeah, I need love like an orphan
So I could be your bug-a-boo, no arguing
Lil' mama let me beep beep like a motorola
Now I'm in love knee deep but it's at her shoulders
But being that I'm a G, I try to keep composure
But I swear shorty got me weak like the weekend over
From the window to the wall she get even lower
Yeah, she got the game, I'm just trying to keep the score
And I promise to be good and never leave it sore
And if I do I promise I will treat it more
Gentle the next time and neither/nor
Will I lie or cheat, either/or
Shit I'd rather beep like a freaking horn
And keep it blowing, aiight

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
Shorty been eyeing me (Oooooh)

[Marsha Ambrosius] (David Banner)
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!! (David Banner, 9th Wonder)

[Verse One: David Banner]
One for the money yessir two for the show
Three for all the ladies that's standin outside my do'
Yellin OH!!!! It's that Mr. David Banner
If I say yes she want me to beat her like I got ani-mosity
Then walk to the bus with a pimp's velocity
Then open up my hand and say y'all all can come with me

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Two: David banner]
I got a bar on the bus we could discuss future plans
Me and you and all your friends we could visit foreign lands
Like showers in Okinawa, barefoot in Thailand
Or we could sop up some biscuits and syrup with bare hands
That's back in Mississippi
All you gotta do is close yo' eyes and come with me girl

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Three: Ludacris]
LUDA!!! I told her, I got the chips if you got the dip
She said when I dip then I better be equipped when you keep my hand on her hips
I told her gimme all you got until your givin is gone
She said her love's eternal and I won't be livin that long
Well! I'm not immortal and I swear I'm no wimp
Cause I died twice and keep comin back as a pimp

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Four: David Banner]
Too close for comfort too close for home
You too close to the front of the stage to be alone
Here's my number when I'm gone you can call me on the phone
I don't buy you bein shy you supposed to be grown
This is more than a pass Hail Mary's bein throwned
Line four up on the line and head to the end zone girl

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Five: Ludacris]
Now put your hands up in the air yeah put 'em where I could see 'em
Put 'em up anyway cause where I'm 'bout to take you you don't need 'em

Believe in Luda like you a like you believe in God
Hallelujah!!! Please pass the offerin
You so wet that I be comin up for oxygen

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius] (Ludacris)
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!! (Don't worry baby I can swim)

[Verse Six: David Banner]
Those huge baby eyes, keep runnin off at the mouth
And they tellin me, how you love these rappers from the South
And I was thinkin how splendid I just wish that your girl wasn't so long winded
We could go to Planet 'Lac
Where the land is made of leather you could lay off on your back
When the clouds are made of tint so you know it stays black, girl!

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Seven: Ludacris]
Look! I was one of the best guys (What) Not one of your ex guys (What)
If you get drunk don't worry I'll let my sex drive
I keep my hands on the wheel if you put it in reverse
Buckle your safety belt, or I'll put you in a hearse
Your frame will strain eyes to women the same size (OH!)
You so fine I'm 'bout to put you in my Fave Five

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Chyna Whyte]
Chyna Whyte don't suck no dicks or lick no nuts
Bitch I hit licks and flip bricks
Every two hours switch whips to keep the peoples off me
What you know about that No-Doz and coffee
No sleep, I'm lookin' 40
With three bricks in a 740
Bitch I ain't got time to party
I'm breakin' bread with Dominican niggas
Over a hot Bennigan's dinner
Thinkin' how I'mma cop the 6 at the beginnin' of winter
Chrome it out and then fit it with timber, that's wood grain
What you ain't know, this a hood thang
All my thugs let ya wood swang
Bitches make ya ass clap
I'm takin' all y'all ASCAP and BMI
Catch me drivin' DUI
Look cause I don't give a fuck nigga I'm livin to die
Who on this track fuckin with me, y'all is willin' to try
Chyna Whyte the thug bitch with no feelings inside, motherfucker

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Well pour out the Henn and Coke and fire up that dro'
It's Ludacris off Old National and Godby Road
The block is sold, "CLEAR!" then I shocked the globe
I clock the hoes, lock do's and drop the 'bows
I rock the shows; pop lock and knock yo nose
You Bia' Bia', I grab my .44 and mop the flo'
I +Mop & Glo'+; the Feds tryin to stop my dough
They claim they caught me at the docks with a flock of snow
I bring the pain - cock back and swing the thang
Yo' girl mad cause she told me don't even bring the thang
And then I told her - I said it's cool, get at me
And then my voice got raaaassspy
Cause I was smokin' on some Cali and my eyes were dazed
I was in the zone, coulda thrown up them tre's
And if you lost, Lil' Jon's got some Eastside ways
So stop actin' like a Bia if yo ass ain't blaze

[Hook]

[Too $hort]
Bitch niggas in the house tell me what's up
A nigga slapped you in the mouth and told you shut up
Somebody holler get 'em and now you just a victim
Shorty tried to stick 'em, told the pit bull to sick 'em
I know he wanna run but he can't he assed out
Punched him in his chin and then he passed out
Woke up with his pockets turned inside-out
Always hit them weak motherfuckaz right in they mouth
You better stay out the way and act like you ain't havin' shit
Cause niggas will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch
You little bitch, that's what the callin' you
You'd be a damn fool to act like you ballin' dude
Mindin' yo business, they grabbed you by yo collar
You feel like Marvin Gaye cause they make you wanna holler
But since you can't run, you might as well fight
Quit actin' like a bitch and live a real life
You just a - "Bia' Bia'!"
[hook:TTHRONE]                                                                                                                       They ask me what I do and who I do it for and how I come up with this shit up in the studio all I want for my birthday is a big booty ho all I want for my birthday is a big booty ho when I die bury me inside the Gucci club when i die bury me inside the Louis club club all i want for my birthday is a big booty ho All i want for my birthday is a big booty ho                                               [verse 1:tthrone]                                                                                                                       She got a big booty so i call her big booty scrr..scrr wrist moving,cooking,getting to it I'm in the kitchen,yams everywhere just made a jug i got bands everywhere You the realest nigga breathing if i hold my breathe Referre,with a whistle,brrrrrt,hold his tech extend clip extend roll when your girl leaves me she need a hair salon have wig killer going on a trapathon, see i den had more bombs in Pakistan dope bomb,dro bomb,and a pill bomb See nigga,I'm balling,you in will call Whan i die bury me inside the jewelry store When i do bury me inside the Truey store True to my religion Two everything i'm to different So when i die bury me next to two bitches
[Hook: Ludacris] (x2)
See I’m black man chillin with my black man stride
Seat back man, cruisin’ in my black man ride
Making white man money
Supplying all the fiends
Yeah I guess you say I’m living out the black man’s dream

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Punish all these niggas
Fucking all these bitches
Buying every diamond, every weapon in existence
Terminator X, I’m a public enemy
Born in the ghetto, Ferrari born in Italy
Head of a family, like a Don, Sicily
Sex, money, murder, I’m investing all my energy
Billionaire eventually, hustler of the century
Source cover, Man of the Year, envy me
One for the money, two for the hoes
Got 3 bricks headed straight for your nose
Smile for your camera while your whole face froze
Stack up all them bodies I’mma whole case load
Middle of December I will melt your fucking snow
While my price is high, I get you dealt with for the low
Black man’s World, white man drugs
No discrimination for my Mexican plugs

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Check me out, it go one for the money
Two for the hoes
Three to put that sticky green scent up to my nose
Nigga roll it with precision and fuck an intervention
I’m the boss muthafucker don’t need nobody permission
You can catch me all up in new additions like Michael Pippens
Girl face upon my lap, now that’s a head on collision
We find out who been snitching then these niggas come up missing
Yeah the chopper see right through it got x-ray vision
Now my culinary arts, hustlers cooking in the kitchen
Get your money then get out, you better make the right decision
Or you might be clanking metal maybe swimming with the fishes
But I guess it’s do or die for these black man riches
So I bought myself a Rover and a Beemer for the Mrs
Chrome lips all on the whip and yeah that bitch be blowing kisses
Now some niggas may not like me cause I never flip the bird
But these niggas gon respect me mark my muthafucking words

[Hook]
[Funkmaster Flex]
Yeah Dirty South baby - Ludacris
Shout to Shaka Zulu, my man Shawn Taylor

[DTP]
Yeah, Funk Flex, Volume Fo'
Disturbin The Peace, Def Jam South
'Cris (yeah) you ready?

[Ludacris]
Oh it's my turn? Aiight..
I got permission to put ya mamma in a headlock (what?)
She tried to jook me in a figure-fo' leg lock (ohh)
She said she like the way I stick and make the bed rock
Or how I lick and leave her twisted like a dreadlock, and it's on
So stop the sweatin like a wristband
And get some balance like a bike without the kickstand
I think I changed the definition of a hit man
Cuz I could really give a fuck about that bitch man, c'mon!
We puttin holes in your residence
And lose anybody for the right president
We thugged out street niggas with intelligence
So all that bullshit you yappin is irrelevant
Oh yeah, I represent the Dirty Southside
I'm a dentist makin women open they mouth wide
You be in jail still runnin it on the outside
Thank not then won't ya open up ya mouth riiiight, but who cares?

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I got my corner on lockdown
About to hold this whole block down
Ludacris tell um how the South sound
UUH BUDDAH-LAA AH, UH UH UH BUDDAH-LAA
UHH BUDDAH-LAA AH uh oh uh oh uh oh

[Verse 2]
Comin to Shady Park is like a peep show
It's some respectable ladies and there some freak hoes
I know killers that go to church up in they street clothes
You'll end up missin more than Shaq when shootin free throws
They packin and bout to open up the dope spot
My neighborhood is stoppin cars like a roadblock
They movin' weight like Atlanta was movin boat rock
And catchin ums like seeun Muslims eatin pork chops - never happen
And meanwhile I been thinkin man
Niggas been slangin tapes like they slangin 'caine
Cuz in the hood its gettin ugly like orangutang
So if you tryin to stop the hustle get the dangalang
Okay, we tryin to make our own White House
Paint it black and start yellin our fuckin pipes out
You try to tackle some players and you'll get psyched out
They can't fuck with us niggas you think they dyked out, so don't play

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Disturbin The Peace, we do that funky shit
Hey, what can I say? We got a monkey clique
See Dre'll throw on them shades, and make that funky shit
And keep y'all women away if they got funky clit
Understand, we got that dough and it get rolled up
You pay the price and still we got the block sold up
Ain't nothin nice a full house don't make you fold up
You full of heist and try to jet and I'm like -
Hold up, god damn - I need to say it on a megaphone
And tell your sister get the fuck up off the telephone
These fools is tickin me off like fifty metronome
I'm takin all of ya money just call me Pebbletone!
Alright? I got the pistol and the safe key
You betta tell your bitch to follow you to safety
How dare you wanna be heroes and chase me
It's Ludacris won't leave no evidence to trace me, you know why?

[Hook]

Funky shit oh
Do that funky shit oh
Do that funky shit oh
Do that funky shit oh
Do that funky shit uh
Do that funky shit uh
