[Skit: Seinfeld & Wale]

[Intro: Usher]
Couldn't make you wait forever, for forever
This is forever
I gotchu

[Hook: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Verse 1: Wale]
(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'mma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong

[Pre-Hook 1: Wale]
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin', "let him go"
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now, but I can promise you forever though

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
(Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote
Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move Ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

[Pre-Hook 2: Wale]
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

[Hook]

[Outro: Wale]
We ain't nothin' but some planets

(Outro Skit)
[Chorus: Miguel]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Verse 1: Miguel]
We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shot guns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Chorus: Miguel]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Bridge: Miguel]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Verse 2: Wale]
Ay we back though
The sun's still there, look
Good morning baby, didn't mean to wake you
But the buy-in is your precious time and my temptation
Never mind that, I guess I'll climb the ladder later
'Less you try and put your back on me then I'ma take it
What is this, macchiato I'm tasting?
Caffeinated your body, I swear that y'all only stay up
Grab a towel, she need it, now she open again
She say my stroke is a scone, I let that soak in her bean
What's up with it? Ok what's really good (more)
I never know your bad side until you show your good
Ok what's up with it? Just let me set the mood
She said she don't on the first night, the morning wood
We talk, recent movies and old tunes
Emulate 50 Shades over Jodeci grooves
But I'm joking, I'm tryna sing your body that notion
If nobody throw me a float, then I'ma drown in the ocean
Come and take this work
Fuck around and be late to work
As the conversation fades let's play "you hang up first"
With your silly self, pictures in my celly, well
Kisses give her goosebumps, well that's cool I used to tutor braille
'Sup baby, ain't mean to wake you
I can put you back to sleep if that's a consolation
And I'm tired of waiting, so no more disappointment
I'm not your regular Joe, I'll be your coffee in the morning

[Bridge]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Part-Chorus]
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
Pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Bridge] x2
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Outro: Miguel]
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Two lost angels discover salvation
Under glass pink skies watching the sunlight
(Coffee in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Coffee in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Coffee in the morning)
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
(Coffee in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye

[Intro: Jerry Seinfeld (Elaine Benes)]
I guess maybe some little problems could arise
(There are always a few)
If anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad
(Devastating)
Because this is very good
(And that would be good)
That would be good too, the idea is to combine this and that

[Verse 1: Wale]
Tryna keep it low
Keep 'em on that need to know
Tell everybody that we're just friends
But to be honest that platonic shit's for TV shows
Same place, we're with different folks
Case closed if they crack the code
Is it me, or is you cold?
Cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes
Go put a sweater on or get a room
Forbidden fruit, swim in your juice
Lot of ways I can get to you
But my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo

Pre-[Hook]
Still we keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Could somebody tell somebody
I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go

[Hook: SZA]
I'm not tryna pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time
We can hook up
We can hang out, we can just chill

[Verse 2: Wale]
Tryna keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Tell 'em all that we're just cool
As far as me and you, we got a simple code
Spendin' nights, well that's optional
No telephones in the afternoon
I know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin'
Every time your ass in the mood
Sharin' thoughts when we share a room
Though we barely talk when we share a room
In the dark, still see your curves
Body like what, swear to God you're a miracle

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook: SZA]

[Interlude]
I mean let's say, what if we did?
(What if?)
Is that like the end of the world or something?
(Certainly not!)
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
(I know!)
I mean really, what is the big deal? We go in there, we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. It's not complicated
(It's almost stupid if we didn't!)
It's moronic
(Absurd!)

[Hook: SZA]
[Kramer skit]
Hey! Happy Festivus everyone!

[Intro]
I promise you ain't never really freak out until you be out at freak hours and see each and every freak out from free couch to free couch

[Chorus x4]
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light

[Verse 1]
Man they really ain't serious
Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?
I used to pop blues with my lil' chick
I call her boo cuz her real one I will forget
I use a Uber to scoop me to SLS
What you expect, a little groupie to see my crib?
Oh no, these niggas ain't serious
Man they really ain't serious
Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?
Try to tell me adderall make her get a rush
Used to use it to study until she fell in love
Told me that lil buzz just make her think a lot
Told her "Nah you lying, cuz you don't eat enough"
Nah Nah Nah
These women ain't serious
She sprinkled a little something up in her liq
Start sipping and now she sweating, her lips clenched
Kind of dizzy, her friends tell her to get a grip
I'm trying to get me a real woman to take out
But for now, they're wild
They rather get it in

[Hook]
Girls on drugs
Girls on drugs
Girls on drugs
Pills and subs when them beers ain't enough
They still need love

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
In her purse where her hand go
She disperse by the handful
Coco make her go up
Nothing popping, pop a Xan' when she laying low
Bars to break, so many bars to break
She at the Grammy's turnt, none of the stars is fake
She like "Oh my God, I'm on the moon and shit"
And my particular moon like a platoon and shit
You know the niggas I be dealing with
Politicians and niggas living it on the rip
And my position to give this shit to little kids
Is not official unless I'm giving them authentic
We're all living with small demons
We're all sinning, it's all similar
Broads with us and they bong hitting
Let me tell you about the women I've been chilling with
The really insecure ones look good in here
Nothing fill the void of a little pill
A little shot, she ain't shy when the shit spill
And it's hard to feel alive when you're feeling dead inside
Beside that the lime light be so real
Let me tell you about the bitches that I be chilling with
Told me nobody love her and so she cut her wrist
Not enough for the hospital but cut it close
That's why she want to get high because she's feeling low
Told me pour me a vodka, pill and little smoke
So I could numb her insides and we will never know

[Hook]
[Intro: Rich Homie Quan].......
Came in at first, had bad luck
Got a whole lot, remember I ain't had nothin'
We done sold out, now everybody mad at me
Tell 'em roll out, now everybody smashin'
Get ready cause you know we 'bout to be a problem
Hope you ready cause you know it 'bout to be a problem

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway
Cash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way
I fight you like a matador, fresh out the catalog
One fall we all fall, crew like dominoes
Paper chase, vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke
Mob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold
We are not alone, boy, better check your tone
You gone need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans
Sit with us, table last supper
Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers
Yeah, ain't nothin' but pure luxury
You lookin' left to me, should be looking up to me
Preferably one of the best
She ridin' cause we next now and forever to death
Be loyal, real, and respect, stay ahead of the rest
We just sit back, relax, doin' things to impress

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Got no time to waste
And no way these niggas stoppin' me, oh no
Flyin' from a mile away
It's not a problem, only real ones follow me
And I can do this with my eyes closed
Blindfold two times over
Ride solo, I got women and got soldiers
I ain't trippin', you try to get it your night's over
Talkin' on Melatonin, get it and fight coma
What's defeat to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire
History, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'
You don't believe it? Then try it
We don't believe in just tryin'
I call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided
That's cold cutting
And I've been this dope for like four summers
And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say
Keep it G for Pete's sake
I know this shit that bone you pick
Might leave you niggas fillets

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YG]
It's YG 4hunnid!
Is you ridin'?
Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence
If Jimmy got caught up, but you was right there with him
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet??
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate
You got that fake-friend syndrome
There's no cure so them symptoms is gon' show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up, each one teach one
Motivate each one to be something
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this, this, and that if you wanna get specific
I'm just tryna make bread come quicker
For me and my day one hittas

[Outro: Kid Ink]
Ride out!
[Produced by Pro Reese]

[Skit]
I had a lady once stop me on the street. I was wearing white shoes. And she says, "I'm glad you're sticking with the white shoes." She says, "It makes me feel good."

[Hook]
Take this good advice
If they're gonna judge you for life
Say we can't always be fly
We gon' be good long as them sneakers white
You'll be alright
Said you'll be alright
Said you'll be alright
Said you'll be alright

[Verse 1]
Gucci S. Dots, whole hood had 'em
Ice cream 'fore the hypebeasts that's into fashion
Being forreal, yo try being Pharrell
When your black ass in a back class, the fronting was real
No Lauren London, we was on a budget
You know, sharin' Old Navy so the army could be fresh in public
Where the sneaker stores and laundromats get all the money
Cause it ain't 'bout what you're doin', 'bout how you're lookin'
When they love you for your status and your catalog
And everybody got a jersey to play along
Back then the hoes checkin' for your zapatos
So even dirty niggas had the foams

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Viotech trainers on the way to work
And we would quietly complain while Eric would lurk
That was the PG Plaza manager, managin' us
Yeah I'm standin' in Lucky 7s but slingin' them Lugz
Still have them Js for the low, low, and I could get 'em early
But I'm not without a conscience, I see people out there hurtin'
Got 'em for Penny Foams that was bought at this very store
And I think that was my shift, then again I'm not very sure
And that's a lot that can get to ya
When you're not sellin' drugs but the outcome is similar
Cause out come them niggas with pistols, tellin' you give 'em up
Now out come the moms with tissues cause you ain't give a fuck
Free lunch for everyone, income was very uh
On the second and 16th everyone would have every 1
And Reebok would carry pump, and that's not the scary part
These niggas love white shoes so much they'd be buried in them

[Skit]

[Bridge]
You'll be alright
You'll be alright
You'll be alright
You'll be alright

[Hook]

[Outro]
No matter how good or lavish us niggas got it
We just a bunch of ravenous addicts living for fancy haberdashery
[Hook: Jeremih]
Baby, you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just trying to drive it once again
Baby, you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just trying to drive it once again

[Verse 1: Wale]
Shawty, can I fill your tank, yeah?
I start off with that, "what you drinkin'?"
Pardon if I'm road raging
But I know you heard my drive is crazy
Yeah, let me pace that with some patience
Let me do it till I fill every void
You're like a Maybach, thinking damn
They ain't even make 'em like you no more
It's like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling)
I adore you up, baby suicide
A little wordplay, I'm hoping I can make you smile
Least until I'm out of line like a DUI
Girl, you remind me of my Jeep
Can I see what's up with that G-Wagon?
Can I take you off of these streets?
To the side of me, I'm trying to see your hazards
Trying to be with the baddest, won't be the fastest
Gotta make it last, I hope you comfortable
I need to get to you, you're like a '62
A little work then it's curtains when I'm skrrting through
Came through in the group, trying to leave in the coupe
That mean I gots a few, but I believe in you
Trying to chase the cat, know I'm killing it, dawg
You ain't feeling me naw, that mean I don't need the roof

[Bridge: Jeremih & Wale]
You remind me of my Jeep, I wanna ride it
You something like my car
I got the keys to them, I need the keys to you

[Pre-hook: Jeremih]
You put on a show, you don't need no clothes
Give me little bit more, always take it slow
I know you don't wanna stop, I'm trying to make it go
Now speed it up like a Maserati, and look at me and pose

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
A good woman is scarce to us
And I wasn't prepared to love
I know it sound crazy, but your miles scare me
I'm just here cause your character good (truth be told)
A good nigga is rare to her (truth be told)
You heard it all, but hear this love
One night with dude, I be the reason you cool
So let me know am I clear enough, yeah, what's up?
Way I, way I, that's the way I think
Shawty straight like a concept on Bayonne Street
In the morning I slide over, she needs a ride I'm like
"Tight, let's keep it AMG"
Sliding down, precipitating is straight
Top down, let me kiss your physique
I'm digging your fleek, I'm checkin' your gear
Can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet
She like when I drive it, I like it in park
Pull that thing over you likely to sore
I got her floating like riding on stars
So I keep it GPS, see where this going
Nothing will stop it, I slide in no prob
Ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts
Sex is her weapon, my snake in her garden
So know when I'm not here the viper is on

[Pre-hook] + [Hook]
[Wale]
I promised Ricky and Milly that I’ma kill it
Runnin' throughout them digits and dollars homie I'm Emmitt
I’m runnin'
I’m so 100 with every nigga I run with
Tell them niggas we coming
We fuckin' it up this summer

[Meek Mill]
And I’m stuntin' like it ain’t nothin'
Most of these niggas frontin'
I pull this Rollie from trappin'
I got this Beamer from nothin'
If they ain’t talking bout paper
Just tell them end of discussion
And now that I’m getting money
My neighbors turn to my cousins

[Wale]
Gold bottles, lot of bitches
Deep thinker, I’m sorry you're such a shallow nigga
The mind on me just shine on them, you shadow women
Ridin' with rats you niggas should be in glass slippers

[Meek Mill]
Ha, and I don’t never ask the price on it
Married to the money hater, throw some rice on it
I told my jeweler get my Muller, throw some ice on it
I treat that pussy like its Tina, I go Ike on it
Beat it up, I’m getting heated up
When I say I’m high, I ain’t talking weeded up

[Wale]
Bitch I’m talkin' G5, Teterboro, feet is up
Beaverton my sneaker game although I never be with ducks
Me and Meek, treein' up

[Meek Mill]
He lying I’m on papers
But when I knock this shit off, I'mma go and buy some Laker shit
I’m talking bout that Cali kush, We get work and Bally push
Two bad bitches in the back, they pretty everybody look

(Wale)
Bitch I’m hot as Wasabi in Abu Dhabi
In a sauna with some models, who treat it like edemame
I ain’t thugging, I ain’t robbing, I’m puffing on my broccoli
Doing 100 in a bucket, do like 20 in a ‘rari

(Meek Mill)
And I’m back on this shit again, Pressie blue like Michigan
I put on for my city I should ball with Vick and them
When I get my V12, I’ma be in Six of them
Riding round with Lou, me, and your sister, and your sister’s friend

(Wale)
Hold up
Got the fridgedest temperature on my wrist again
Shiny shit to niggas is like givin' children Ritalin
Bamma's sittin' in the pen, see you in a minute yo
And them haters went away as soon as I left Interscope

(Meek Mill)
Big money, I’m talking bad hoes
You niggas full of shit, fucking assholes
I’m in this presidential suite, I’m in my bathrobe
Counting 100 grand I pulled it from my last show
Shitting on them, something I ain’t mean to do
These hoes do anything, our wish is like a genie do
A nigga buy a point, here take the nina too
I get a chick to come and serve you like Serena do

[Wale]
I think its genius leanin' will do when you in a groove
Stuntin', I’m in the sixth
I call that shit that middle school
High as shit, I’m in a booth
Denver Nugget number 2s
And I don’t gotta front, I play these niggas like a wisdom tooth
This is where the Wizards play, this is where them bitches play
We'd have you fallin' and now you scrapin' from that Kemba shake
On the day a hater treat a nigga like he fake
That'd be the day his label treat him like a signal fade

[Meek Mill]
And I’m ballin' bitch
I’m ballin' bitch
Me, Wale, so hard - as shit
Get your budget money back, fire all your artists-es
We be burnin' everything, they label us as arsonists
If I ain't middle of the track, I'm 106 and Parkin' it
Bitch
Yea
Chip, check it out
25 wives
Wish I could have...
If I could have 25 wives..

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
Just me with all y'all, that'd be so wonderful
Make daddy proud: I love every one of you
My angels - I feel like Flava Flav but sexier
The sex is gonna be messier
But ain't gonna be no stress in here
We living good all of us, we winning, that's obvious
We got whips, Cars R Us, we smoke good: it's foggy
Plus the status: they all mad at us
Teamwork: that's our recipe for living lavish
Yeah, we get this cabbage
I'm the head coach of the team
If everybody play their position, we can win this thing
Called life, happiness, liberty, freedom
If I got all y'all, there won't be no sense in cheating
Y'all the truth, got a connection with you all
Ambisexuals. If this ain't Heaven what's it called?
Must be life. No greater feeling in the world
If I had 25 wives, I would love all my girls..

[Hook] x2
I wish I could have 25 wives
We'd all get it poppin, we'd all get high: that's fly
If I could have 25 wives
I'd love them all like they love me
We hustle to survive

[Verse 2: Wale]
Got women in every city. Winning in every city
Her body's been paranormal since buying that pair of titties, look
Silicone bitches got the confidence
But natural bitches get all my compliments
I ain't trying to conflict: Nickels to dimes and shit
Make something out of nothing. Nigga, I MacGyver that bitch
Niggas wild as shit. No rubber, just climb in that bitch
Take your hat off and get to cuttin: Kung Lao on that bitch
Mortal Kombat, my shit is beyond rap
I keep it 100 nigga: Warren Moon, Warren Sapp
Hit, I never call her back. Bet she keep on coming back
You keeping her dry, shit, I named that bitch "Tsunami Cat"
I'm too polished, I ain't looking for acknowledgement
Put my squad on my back like I'm wearing me a starter jacket
Yall lame niggas. No bitches when yall are out
I get that Ivy League brain, catch me with a Dartmouth

[Hook] x2

[Outro: Wale]
It's Double M-G yo
It's nothing but a motherfucking undefended free throw
I'm getting each ho
Eyes lower than Ichiro
[Wale talking]
So yeah like
I'm not really like worried about fucking up or you know what I'm sayin'
The plight of a rapper or whatever
Or the trials of tribulations
Cause you know, aside from me strugglin' or coming up in one of the most
Fucked up, hating ass areas in the world
I played football for twelve years you know
And anybody who plays sports, you know you got politics
And you got all the other bullshit
So I'mma talk about a little bit of that
And I'mma stop rappin' and start rappin' now
So drop the slam and let's get sick

[Verse 1: Wale]
Halfback toss to right
Yeah the coach used to say I was awesome, right
O.D. was in the weight room all his life
But I was more self concerned with the broads in life
On to college, Im always on the yard like farmers
Never in class
Dorm room hoppin' if workouts optional
Im not rockin'
I can run an option best in my conference
Look at my accomplishments, I'm all county
You double A niggas should be lucky y'all signed me
Lucky y'all found me, lucky y'all stole me
I could be with Bowden, I could be with Friedgen
Two a day curfews, where's my Freedom?
School ain't even start yet, there ain't not freaks here
Might as well prepare
Season opener, finna be there
When the depth chart came, there was no me there
I mean me is there, but it's like three there
Which made me have to wait like leap year
Cause I ain't really lift weights, I didn't need them
I run a 4.4, so they won't catch me there
Knocking on my coach door like a missionary
Playbook like a Oxford dictionary
Attitude that was not really felling
And he put me on ice, I was Oksana literally
I keep talking, I keep talking
My scholarship won't straight like Rodman
So Im walking
Fuck it, Im leaving
VSU next season
Peace

[Hook: Kanye West]
I need you right now
I need you right now
You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya

[Verse 2: Wale]
They say, Trojans never break but it ain't that
For God sake, you can call coach Faison
I've seen dreams turn dust, cause he made them
Cause he played them, when he ain't played them
I've seen niggas loose cool, niggas leave school
And back to the block with nothing better to do
VSU don't regret you
Just regret the fact that I left too soon
I got kicked off, I used to shit talk
Excuse my complaint, but I got to get it off
Hey Mr. coach, I don't like you
You don't me, that don't mean I gotta move
You see the way I move, I am in another gear
You can ask Los, I was like a young Gale
My coach ain't care, so I ain't care
He ain't even respect the name, he said Whale
So I said yeah, and he was like yeah
You fumbled in a drill, young man get on the hill
So Im like fuck it, Im out get on your head
Such Karma, next year they 4-6
A few niggas stay, a lot of niggas quit
And now I only listen to this hip-hop shit
A few niggas stay, a lot of niggas quit
Man fuck this shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
I go, in when I start putting words out
Words sharp like a Jerry Rice curl route
Im moonshine, y'all merlot
I got on, and I gotta thank Marlon
Thank Kenny Burns, though we not talking
But my squad like the 72' Dolphins
Climate Shula, my flow Csonka
Im so Bonkas, Im not conscious
They are not confident when Im talking
Make them more insecure when they caught one
He tried tossing to Andre Johnson
Now Im getting compliments on how charming I am
And Im way out London, way out conscious
Y'all never seen
Exclusives, y'all never seen
They wait on my return, I am Vai Sikahema
Write it in my leisure, I rather go shopping
Gucci & Nike, that’s what I call an option
Um Tom Frazier, new LeBron haters
Got you niggas all over my bars just like Frasier
I've become immune to you no name haters
They can not pause like Ryu on Sega
I get inspired about your make up
You no good like a stripper with a "A" cup
Young Arrington, coming for you Aikman
Aye Jay, 8 grand skins gonna take that
Aye Bo, 10 stacks on the Patriots
Aye Rich, another 5 on the G Men
Another 5, Eli won't even be there
No Strahan, y'all need to rebuild
Back to you homo spittin so, so
You can't kick it like Romo hold for ya
No more for the broke I am more so
A first rounder, y'all don't want a Russell
I must go like fly route
My tires align with the play, but the times out
Yeah hail Mary full of grace
I swear these off rhyme bums are full of hate
Young Peyton don't huddle, still run my play
Still run that break, still get my ring, still run my shit
And it ain't no thing, you in Dungy's dungeon
So get that straight, yeah get that straight
Ain't nothing to Peyton
I am Marvin with mind, but I listen to Wayne
And I listen to 'Ye
Still listen to Big
And I listen to Jay
They are the coaches in this
And I listen to thought
And I listen to Common
We have nothing in Common
The shit that I spit is more
[Wale]
You gotta understand man
Personifying hip-hop
Try to

[Verse 1: Wale]
I rely on no man, but him that's speakin'. Him that lead him
Bleed on a track, like a pole vault freakish
Accident victim. Meanwhile beatin' up the beat via Benzi
Haters eyes gettin' wide like bench seats
I bring Maybach. You getter get me
Wale, yeah. All them haters get me
Osmosis, now niggas get me
I spit that halitosis. You got Listerine
I'm that extreme, So haters complain
So Blame It On my Rain. You all lip sync
Wale: I turn beef into mince meat
Your condescending ways don't convince me
And I didn't know what condescending meant till yesterday
So I threw it in a rap so I'd remember that
Yeah, it ain't nothin' to me
I play the background whole time Mario 3
Gone

[Hook: X8]
Second Time around

[Brother Ali]
Ha. It's Brother Ali. Hey Benzi my man. You gotta forgive me
I might go a little long. I got some shit I gotta get off my chest right now
Bring it back for me

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
Rappers can't clap me
Jackers can't gat me
Original meaning of Jazzy Fat Nasty
I don't bite rapper's lines, I bite the captain's arm off
I don't throw shots in the air, I throw that Molotov
Cocktail, reservoir dog my collar off
Y'all scared to get that revolution popping off
You really got the guns you claim in the track
Then my question to you is who you aiming 'em at
You complain that the rap police caught you with a gat under the seat
Misdemeanored that twenty bag of weed
But little old me with the few facts that I speak
The homeland security gaffeled me over seas
Froze my bank account and seized my guarantee
And y'all are soundscanning like a hundred more than me
They kicking you off tour for freaking a chick or two
Verizon dissed me too cause I was too political
Y'all are all safe and shit, y'all are not saying shit
You just snap your fingers and dance and make your label rich
Gotta pay back that advance, so they ain't gave you shit
This is your chance to say something and you're wasting it
People are starving, you talking bout balling
Can't think of nothing more important than that jargon
Hundred different ways to describe diamonds sparkling
Eighty percent of kids are listening to y'all shit
I heard that statistic I almost cried
Never wanted so bad for 2pac to be alive
What the fuck happened to rap when
The gangsters are scared of upsetting they industry masters
It ain't my place to say and I hear all that
But fuck that, I live in the hood and we need y'all cats
So as soon as I hear y'al on some real pro black
Then I will gladly go back to my emo rap
They say the truth don't belong to nobody, if you see it you speak it
It would be a sin to keep it a secret
So if I need to breathe then believe that I mean it
Quit trying to be somebody's boss and be a leader
If it wasn't bad enough your labels are hoeing you
You can't even scan, your fans are downloading you
There's no connection, so they're not supporting you
You ain't never shed light on nothing that they're going through
We ain't buying CDs, we striving to live
And these artists don't need me they already rich
I ain't hating on you, rock them shines
Just remember us from time to time when you drop them lines
Rappers can't clap me
Jackers can't gat me
Original meaning of Jazzy Fat Nasty
Busy raising babies and living on tour
Signing off Brother Ali, sincerely yours
[Intro - Wale]
Welcome to paradise
Paper planes, long flights

[Black Cobain]
Destinies fulfilled off the filling from the pillow talking
How you killing my highs I hope you built the coffin
I got virgin lungs please excuse the coughin'
Think I’m bout to blow, they call me George from Boston
Respect is never given so I confiscate it
Get acquainted with mine, I get em acclimated
Cherry red dice I’m a gambling man I’m never thinking twice
Had to escape the life
This ain’t for all and every people, don’t compare me to rappers
I’m trying to be like The Beatles
Give me some soul money, niggas is gassed up
Tell them to keep it running, I’m keeping the grass cut
No snakes, royalty hating niggas don’t get no pussy
So it’s more for me, she invited me in her mouth
You know it’s cordially we throwin’ racks, she said please don’t torture me
All my niggas is winning, shout out to Charlie Sheen
I spitting bars the metronome the money machine
A money machine, of course I’m trying to
Be the king, that was part of my dream
And Wale told me fuck y'all, so we fuck y'all, we don’t love yall
Loud P.O.T. above y’all, patron at 4 am, fuck the last call
The way your heard of that, the way yo heard of y’all

[Wale]
Thugging, Heartless and mean mugging
For when niggas don’t see their seeds till they see the judges
Dark side of town, baby mama blues
When drama ensues niggas Ndamukong Suh
All lying ass defensive ass boys
Why you knock that bitch up if you can’t tend it out boy?
I’m attentive my opinion is monumental
I’m here forever, these other niggas scribble in pencil
Got indelible colors, only local they’re buzzing
I’m at Dulles with luggage fly straight to the money
And you don’t understand my slang my colloquial’s lovely
So they quote me and love me like I’m a poet or something
Ho I kick it, I punt it like Reggie Roby or something
Shady bitches offend me, Reggie smokers disgust me
Make the least of you haters, make the most of your money
Have that consistent drive long as your motor’s running
I used to heat up mama house by opening ovens
Now mama see that shit on Oprah and know that it’s coming
That’s real shit, it’s bigger than rap
My nigga Co-Bizzy Virginia is back
I light up my spliff take a sip of my yack
Thinking back of when the city weren’t thinking of rap
They weren’t thinking of Ralph, they weren’t giving a fuck
Now everywhere I go they be giving it up
I seen it all from Barry Farms to Sursum Corda
They had that rock in Lincoln Park that’s word to Mike Shinoda
Shout out to captain Ginnny and free my nigga Ricky
We always pray for polo, we miss you little Benny
We skip college, chase dollars and black pennies
Not in the kingdom of Zamunda but it’s mad semi’s
Where bad bitches with bad intentions just act friendly
This where they love you then they hate you, go and ask Fenty
Yeah, go and ask Fenty
They love you then they hate you, go and ask Fenty
Go and ask Fenty, hating ass nigga, sweeter than a simply
Who got the juice nigga?
Juice nigga
Juice nigga
Work, work, work, work, work
[Verse 1: Black Cobain]
5 AM in this muthafucka, we still sippin
Spending cheese on the women, nigga that's big pimpin
Forever faded, I know Lucifer waiting
Brought this shit to fruition, took my niggas to Vegas
Who's better? Them never, Lo sweaters
Motion pictures, my niggas, no extras
This BOA know they loving the crew
She just wanted the last, thought I wanted it too
Real niggas never hate another man
You see em gettin it then you get it, pardon my hand
But you forcin it and it's unfortunate
They won't be reaping the benefits of new porches is
Folarin said we 6 million and running
So I'm just making sure my verses count for something
62 dreams, roll a date with some lean
It's 5 in the morn, yea I'm on the scene

[Verse 2: Black Cobain]
5 AM in this muthafucka we still sippin
Sin City, my God, we still tippin
Get these niggas the blues until they all crippin
This for my niggas hustlin until they last minute
My niggas buying time: Rolexes
If XXL frontin on me I do it four X
I stared death in the eyes a couple times
My passport got stamped before a couple rhymes
Laugh in a hater's face, tell him that he a broke nigga
The devil is alive, but what's it to a cold nigga?
I know I know, I do not mean to boast
It's looking easy my nigga, a rap finger roll!
Road to riches: who riding shotgun?
Who knows my worth and gonna take the charge when the cops come?
Righteously living, I know all my verses be cold
I be asking myself: am I selling my soul? Huh?

[Verse 3: Wale]
Born thuggin' , heartless and mean-muggin
You bulemic, struggling niggas ain’t eating supper
Forever well-off
No Kenny Smith, no I'mma jet off
With rhyming skills, you in amish village
How simple they are
We are thee lyrical CPR, some decent broads
See Gods eating Philippe Chow
We be like chow
They be like now?
We be like wow
They be like damn
We be like go
They be like where
We be like.. Down
Fellatio is frequent, still I treat them decent
Jamaican for the weekend, rice, peas and King fish
In hindsight, I think alot of yall should try to see this
From college cheatin', to bodyin' all these coliseum
You oughta see this, my modded sneaker is often three much
Til the hype deceased I'll likely put all of my three’s up
Bumpin' little brother feelin every word to love it
This warren moon meets warren buffet I throw up numbers
Double M self made we forever rich
Uptown, MoCo, Prince George, represent
Hit up mo hit up vic, an we rollin a swish
Lexus with me for the night pick up hoes with my bitch
Nigga flow like a missisipi river in a pitcher
That mean im overflowin all you rappin niggas in cups
This shit pay my momma bills, stackin my shit for real, she say you in my belly
I tell her i'm too sincere, that's a nas reference, lyrically ain't not impressive
If I hear another model-bottle rhyme, im flippin
My mind is like a lotto ticket yall dont get it
Like a monica skinded with a madonna spirit
Material girls I got a fetish for ,so I got the best rapport
With business hoes an college strippers
D.c thats drugs come in dumb choppas
With no garden I know hoes that pump water
[INTRO: Wale]

This is only for the hip-hop lovers
You want that bullshit - turn the radio on
Skyzoo, Wale

[Verse 1: Wale]

The one and only, homey still Thelonius with it
The only one spittin' like no one else livin'
No one that's breathin' is seen as an equal
Could breathe on the mic and give it epileptic seizures
They turn narcoleptic when them niggas start speakin'
Ridin' in that ES with my Nefertiti queen
And eyes low, pardon me, hah
We smoke the kind of green that turn the Simpsons Bruce Lee on
Hi-Ya, the higher part of my hierarchy
My mind potent like you high off keys or something
Shit, we don't believe none of them
Motherfucker, your career is a conundrum
And none drum, iller than Ninth Wonder
IV, no I can sell like mitochondria
I'm out the country, I'm jet lagging
They can't see me, I'm like the team that brought Brett back
And I'm man-genie, flyer than the rest of them
Wale Ovechkin
Fuckin' with that ice, them Landover niggas check ya
Check one-two, the mic is my weaponry
Lyrically or physically, step to me, you rest in peace
Watch what I do to beats, I don't need no jewelery
I was underground but wasn't trying to renew the lease
Yeah, hello mainstream, I'm a walking dollar bill ain't a damn thing changed

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]

I got mine while the rest of ya'lls was still looking
I'm top five, but no begging, dawg, I for real took it
So how they grilling me is literally just serenity
Literally, if you say you feeling me, then you feel Brooklyn
[Wale: Whatup!]
And I don't do colorful jeans or shiny kicks
My shoe game is Penny in ninety-six
I move aim, hit 'em and final flip
Whether it's a beat or a scam
I gave ya'll wizardry with my hands
I made ya'll want to be what I am
And as far as your fades I raised them all underneath where I stand
I'm pushing it for the corner
Keeping them on the hip
And, yup, I gave lyrics a reason to want to live
Fresh off the plane, Hong Kong, Beijing
Felt like I was home, the groupie love was the same
I'm Kobe in an orange jersey
And wrote this from 4:25 to 4:30, hah

[Wale] Okay

[Skyzoo] Yeah, I mean, I literally wrote that from 4:25 to 4:30

[Wale] That's about five minutes, guy

[Skyzoo] For real
They call me, S-K-Y-Z-O-O

[Verse 3: Wale]

And I'm Wale Folarin, was raised on go-go
They style is so-so, my Louis from So-Ho
Hoping that hip-hop can surface and go-go again
They go major, the flow is no longer
So everything retro come across so corny
Everything from Bradfords to gimmick spitters
To every nigga who rap and say, 'My shit's different!'
So get with us or lose like them niggas
Spent more on these kicks than Pac-Man spent on strippers

Haha! This just the beginning of the, uh, you know, the whole process of this Back to the Feature mixtape
DC whatup?
BK whatup?
PG whatup?
MoCo whatup?

Let me do some shoutouts
Mo betta - what up?
UCB - what up?
Hey Sycamore, whatup?
You ain't' doing shit til you put 10 gees on fantasy football
That's when you know you doing shit
Yeah, bitch
[Refrain: Rick Ross]
600 Benz, house six hundred grand
That was six years ago, whips come from Japan
I get that work from my face
I get that work from my face

[Wale]
600 Benz, condo six hundred grand
I got twelve hundred kicks, them bitches straight from Japan
My ambition is wicked I put that shit on my hand

[Rick Ross]
I get that work from my face

[Wale]
I put that shit on my man

[Verse 1:Wale]
Wale, real nigga, where the totem, blowin' bomb haze
I just tell CJ keep on rollin’ that's my shorty
Tinted out, you ain't seeing through
All black everything, this shit like a HBCU
Maybach music, major moves
I’m saving major loot
I make my old bitch buy me all the latest shoes
One whip just ain't enough, I just seen 33
You only half a W without a second V
Gotta be dreamin, gotta be chosen
Shawty when I was 20 I had a Camry and tokens
But now I’m ok, bitch I got my shit together
Rozay told me keep on working, shawty you’ll be rich forever, ever
Forever my endeavours and I sever my opponents
I’m cold like its in Denver
The dilemma is, you think I got no conscience
You think I just here flossing and talking?

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Dependin' on how I feel, either the coupe or sedan
I’m only dealin' with you, nothin' to do with your man
Niggas ruin your plans, it’s best to do what you can
I’m up to six hundred bricks, started with two hundred grams
Hand to hand in the cold
Pockets on hella swole
I was breakin' ‘em down, now I’m sellin' ‘em whole
Work straight out the kitchen
Ain't no competition
You just shut up and listen and you can complete the mission
Know you want me to fall
I don’t do nothing but ball
You heard I was in jail, well I just came from the mall
I’m on my way to the jeweler bout to cop me a Muller
Keep the digital ruler at arm's length of the Ruger
Life’s a bitch and I feel her
Ain't nobody iller, perico Godzilla
Catch me blowing vanillas
Used to be blood money

Now it’s go hard scrilla
After I count it all up, I’ma go to the dealer and get a…

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Hope you heard that intro
This that I been grindin' cause I’ve been savin' for that Benz flow
To mash on assholes with petty badges
Tell em’ niggas we throwed, but they never gon catch us
If I am pulled over, I know they gon be on it
Cause it’s hot in here and I got no L like the ’72 Dolphins
Woooh, race my niggas, and I bet you never pass me like a free safety
I’m Polamalu, 600 the newest model
My newest motto to use a condom with newest models
Uhh, got a hundred on the dash, young
Ya ain't killers ya’ll got hundred yard dash guns
I’m a rare one, camo’s and some rare ones
Where I'm from is a circus hope you don’t expect a fair one
Dropping hundreds like it ain't nothin'
Really it was but you know I never sayin’ nothin'

[Hook]
[Intro]
Got this thing in my mind, about being great
Or attempting to be

[Bridge]
Yeah, so it's on me
So it's on me, so it's on me
I copped threes for the whole team
So it's on me
I copped threes for the whole team
Now we at the top, MJ, 88
And I ain't ever gonna stop

[Verse 1: Wale]
Carolina blue kicks
Hottest nigga on your block
I ain't J.R. Rider but them wolves coming for my spot
From the percentage of youngins winning without no college
I'm in my Laneys but nothing JV about this balling
I lost my deal, got with Will he seen a nigga genius
My rapping skills is on Chapel Hill but you ain't see it
Eyes low, pyro
Grape swisher, my 5's on
My opposition decline slow
My J's straight out of China like baby Cairo
Shout out to Tyga but my squad Balenciaga
One of the rarest in flyest niggas to rep the chocolate
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Never Michael Jeffrey in 17s, I'm staying with my team
No bullshit loyalty rare
And don't worry 'bout it shawty we here

[Hook]
So it's on me, I got threes for the whole team
Now we at the top,  MJ, '88, and I ain't ever coming down
Work, so it's on me,  I copped threes for the whole team
Now we at the top, MJ, '88 and I ain't ever comin down
Work, and the people say, and the people say

[Verse 2]
Groupies everywhere, I'm mentally prepared
I got a black and red joint, I bet they thinking bred
They tryna see me fail, just know my thinking and my sneakers rare
Get that Chi-Town love, I'm in Leaders gear
Bet they got they pom-poms up soon as I see O'Hare Seven
I make a damn movie fooly
I been the dookie, these rappers is Sam Bowie to me
I was a Bowie student, it wasn't really nothing
That's why I kicked it and blew grass like Boise punter
This is no Space Jam, I'm out the globe stunting
I'm a one man band, I prolly Jordan 1 em
And all my singles golden
I will not forfeit, this my defining moment you know
Seven Eleven, yea I got 'em open
Eleven pair of 7s, they touching my rap touring
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
And when I'm 45, do it like I'm 23
And premature, tell me I'm wrong if a nigga swing I feel it jack
I was just waiting 'til the sixth ring

[Hook until end]
[Hook]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nose bleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
She live her whole life like T.V
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is 90210

[Verse 1]
Ms. Rodeo, tell me where your day go
Part-time waitress she really want to make it
In the "City of Lights", it's hard to see clear
She don't really care about anyone advice
And nothing here's real, and everyone's alike
Cause everyone dreams of the millionaire's life
She barely eats at all, if she do she eats light
Indulging a meal when a toilet's in sight
Expose those fries, can't hold those down
To read for Seven Pounds, you must release several pounds
This is Heaven on Hell
This is how she want to live
But she ain't really tripping, she's on Beverly Hills

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Just another day out in Beverly Hills
She sing, model, and dance, but can't sit still
Believing the screens or anything there
But reality shows ain't real
So pretentious with no potential
She goes to catch up, although her rent's up
In her defense she a part of the crowd
She going to borrow some money
So she can party at Chows
It's apart of her goal
It's all she knows
Graduated from Rosé, addicted to blow
Addicted to stardom, a wish to blow
So she kisses the stars
And she gives them a blow
After every show, a dream she hold
Inhibitions is gone, she just want to be known
She want to be know, she just want to be known
Pulling down her skirt
"I never done this before"
Nah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know big-breast girls
Never ever pay rent
They meet them rich boys
Throw D's on that bitch
Lease on the whip
Beach on the weekend
Hotel suite, room keys is a gift
Dream of the fame or a ring on her finger
Now you just a whore to the known entertainers
Word spreads fast that your knees spread quick
The sun's always out
But it's clouds over here
Look, cocaine addiction, apartment eviction
To add to the list of Beverly Hills victims
Hold on you can see my vision
Next time you look down on a nigga

[Hook]
[Young Joc]

911, 911

(i tried)
And it feels like the worst aggression is passive
They were my niggas but, observe "were" is a word is past tense
Now they act fickle cuz I guess they hate to see me follow my passion
When everything they follow's either ass or fashion
Now I'm sitting, wishing for them days way back when
You ain't diss me when I said click me on Datpiff
Ain't that a bitch, is this game so strange,
You forgot when you said things ain't gon' change
Always be my brother and I'm always gonna love you
But you started looking up to me as if I was above you,
Ironic cuz I tried to keep it humble
I'm talking but it feels just like a mumble
Telling me to speak up and gain a little confidence
Coming from the Glee Club, I just wanted accomplishments
Then I got some and you thought I got cocky shit
Started doing right so tell me what's wrong with this
When the kids wants an autograph and bitches want a picture
Coming home from the road friends say they missed you
Then you leave and they diss you...
I said my name Wale, if you don't know me
You better read a book or something, this is D.C
By way of PG, we call that DMV
This song about you, then you probably need to leave
Pew! Diggity- go girl, you need to go for it
Jordan 4s won't find me in no loafers
Hold up, Maryland, I am so tour
I've been so thorough, that's what I boast for
I know you thinking, "I ain't gotta go there"
You sitting at the bar wearing Barbaro's hair
Yeah, that ain't you love, you can't fool love
Blue eyes but she blacker than Kunta
We don't believe you, you need more people
You need more grease in your hair, so they weaves you
Shake your hair like them track ain't coming out
Bartender, no ice, bring another shot
And I ain't tryna be trife when I call 'em out
I just call it like I see, know what I'm talking 'bout?

I gotta tell you right now
As much as I wanna leave
I gotta know if it's real or not
Ain't nothing fake about me
So if you wanna leave
I gotta know if it's real or not
Is it real or not?
[Intro]
Yeah, turn the lights on
Yeah, turn the lights on
Yeah, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on

[Hook: Rico Love]
These hoes be acting up
These hoes be acting up
These hoes be acting up
And these niggas be letting 'em
These niggas be letting 'em
These niggas be letting 'em
These niggas be letting 'em
And me, I don't be sweating 'em

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
These hoes be acting up
And these niggas be letting 'em
I crushed them hoes, I never love them hoes
And these niggas be sweating 'em
Cause I run shit like Edgerrin
Or better yet, like Rev and them
And on the bottom of my sneaks they red, man
And I ain't talking 'bout no damn Meth and them
Stay Louboutin and I super grind
VS stones, they super shine
I pop the Perc, I get super high
And I drill your bitch, root canal
I rock Tom Ford, Concords
And I shine on these dime whores
This bitch done bought me a Rolex
And I still ain't got no time for her
These hoes be acting up
These niggas be acting tough
I'm in the Phantom, I'm backing up
And I'm bust down, but I'm strapped as fuck
So hold your horses, Polo horses
Aston Martin, we roll in Royces
Real niggas up in the building
Them hoes choose us, ain't no more choices

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
These hoes be acting up
See, me, I don't practice much
Gold albums from the word of mouth
Gold bottles in the back of us
These Jones be broke as fuck
Too uptight, they won't open up
She got her arms folded even on the phone
I'm like, what the fuck is she here fo?
These hoes be acting up
These niggas keep wifing up
Please homie, got me cracking up
Never spent one more than a night with her
These hoes be a fucking joke
They'll never say a nigga didn't warn you though
Cause you can hit my phone like four in the morning
And I be like, hah, told you so

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
These hoes be acting up
Big bread we racking up
Straight to the bank, cee-lo
Cancel that bitch like Nino
Ratchet ass ho, don't play with me
Want to Kobe me, want to Humphrey me
Want to Michael me, Russell me
Take me to the bank and Tiger me
Now these hoes be acting up
These clothes ten stacks and up
These cars 100 racks and up
These drums 100 rounds and up
Bitch, blow me like a trumpet
Twenty thousand, all in hundreds
Fuck it, money, money, money
Money, money, money, ah!

[Hook]
[Hook:]
I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Perfect niggas ain’t real
So I just keep my cash right and say fuck how haters gon feel
Cause I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Said you know real niggas ain’t perfect
Said I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Perfect niggas ain’t real
So I just keep my cash right and say fuck how haters gonna feel
Cause I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Said you know real niggas ain’t perfect

[Verse 1: Skeme]
It goes real niggas ain’t perfect, perfect niggas ain’t real
So I just keep my cash right and say fuck how haters gon feel
Cause man I was born real and gonna die real
You gotta stay down, that’s how I feel
Can’t be worried about another nigga
No, I just worry bout my bills
And I’m livin life to the fullest
Trigger finger itchin bitch then I pull it
Got me a 4-5, 19-11
With 4 metal jackets for these bullets
I done did everything that you couldn’t
You might sail out but I wouldn’t
And if the rap fall out then it’s traps all out
Bring the pots back cause I’m cooking

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Skeme]
And it go real niggas ain’t perfect
Perfect niggas ain’t real
Man ain’t one rapper in the game right now got a half a ticket with no deal
See I don’t fuck with niggas cause that shit weak
Besides dirty drinkin ain’t shit sweet
Snake niggas wanna go behind your back
Just like the past repents pistol pete
And these little niggas that be dissin me
Let nina sing to you, no symphony
To keep it 100 I got old money
Now put it on yo head and you’re history
You can’t fuck with I, not physically
Not mentally, you ain’t shit to me
Money talks and bullshit walks
So you broke niggas just don’t mention me and I

[hook:]

[Verse 3: Wale]
They say trill niggas just working
I’m supposed to bitch
Real niggas ain’t perfect
But I’m close to it
Coast to coast, where your focus at?
Big up the coach and niggas stole from that
Where yo soldiers at? Where yo hoes is at?
All my niggas in tracks but all my hoes in check uh
Thought I told you that
DMV, you know we on the map
P.I.M.P they callin me cause all the H.O.E.S is calling back uh
Now we like em, love em and leave em man
You heard big brother’s CD
Now we both stay skeming
I’m out

[Hook:]
[Intro: Rick Ross]
Boss is my position, I got the ammunition
All Wale talking is Ambition

[Hook: Rick Ross (Wale)]
In the caravan with some Latin bitches
Talking caramel with them asses like the strippers
Oye mami, ven aca, come her for papi chulo
Let me knock it out the park, I'm talking Albert Pujols
(Albert Pujols, trial left two hoes up in my new muh-fucking two door
This shit ain't nothing new though
I'm tryna knock that out the park, Albert Pujols)

[Vamp]
Schematic, hold the fuck up nigga
Bring that shit the fuck back
This the big boss Ricky Ross nigga
We ain't playing no fucking games

[Verse 1: Wale]
Made a million with the pen
Make my women follow dreams, pussy popping follow head
Bitches check on my stats, women get too attached
Fuck what them niggas saying I hit whoever at bat
John Rocker Atlanta's Bravest know that I'm awesome
Bet I be like Fenway out in Boston, my green is a monster
We don't speak to informants, they just look for a way out
They just hating on the game, they just way too Canseco
Gotta thank my crew, my label, everything I do they ate, Oh
K with, who the fuck gon' say something?
Shit grand like a muh-fucking bass load
Three strikes put a muh-fucking K up
Double M nigga now we up
Three strikes like a muh-fucking C.C
You wife ain't shit, we G'd her
Huh, we G'd up, G'd up
Up in my new two door
Knock it out the park, Albert Pujols

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Feel like I seen it all, but I can't say so
Be a snitch? No way, Jose Canseco
Face down, ass up, ain't none of my bitches planking though
We got stripes in my city, ain't none of my niggas Yankees though
It's going down in history, the way I valet two doors
She blew a kiss at me, I told her da le culo
Listen b, just give my stylist kudos
And my consistency? I call that Albert Pujols
Shouts out to St. Louey, swag champ I got the belt
Big H if it ain't Louie, cuffing you bitch is not gon' help
They asking me what I wear, I think YSL is how it spelt
And I might just let you touch it if you don't go tell 'em how I felt
Real nigga, that's just how I'm built
From turning white into cream, powdered milk
To getting rich off a dream, I throw it the bag
This the Ambition anthem, I flowed it to the flag

[Hook]
[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
I been all around the world
Came from the bottom, aiming for the top
And I'm still climbing
Say what you wanna but
I'm not coming down
I been all around the world
I still got haters
Blacktop shades
You came blazin'
Baby heading down a cloud

[Verse 1: Tiara Thomas]
I'm on my pedestal
Yeah I said it ho
Fuck whoever said the rap game wasn't edible man
I'm incredible homie I been beasting
I be murdering bars
Y'all leave bee stings
Sippin' bitches what lemonade
I ain't even made it
You already afraid
You already are caged
You fucking lab rabbits
You was hot for a season
Little industry gadgets
You scatterbrains
So much to say a scrabble game
But habits have changed and I've been trying to change mine all the way
But I feel my transformation gon' smash the entire game
My brothers alone said fuck your entire
Name, and your entire
Fame, What you know about it
I take the title from ya'
What you gon' do about it
You're emotional bitch, Fuck your period
Your reign of glory, your balls wetter ending the sentences
Hate me if you want to but always remember this
That I'm the future of this game, and of course I spit this shit
I'm not A but I'm the bitch
MC Hammer too legit
And more than confident
Anybody ever doubted me
Coming back with this shit bitch

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
I been all around the world
Came from the bottom, aiming for the top
And I'm still climbing
Say what you wanna but
I'm not coming down
I been all around the world
I still got haters
Blacktop shades
You came blazin'
Baby heading down a cloud

[Verse 2: Wale]
Who got the flow?
Its somethin like Manute Bol
Blowin' fluke horns, I'm not high
Bitch I'm four wings, I'm two flies, I'm net fly
I ain't with that hoopla, dolo and the coopers
I maneuver the two-cloud smokin' like I'm supposed to
Flowin' like I'm in poker, you never﻿ know my emotion
Never will you survive if you ever rhyme for a poser
I just light up and focus
I just ride for the coaches
I just ride for my niggas and give the bitches the business
Callin' these bitches cuz bitches ain't even women
Yeah
We been all around the world
You gon' know a lot of haters when you know a lot of girls
I know a lot of money bring a whole lot of vultures
That's why a little more bring a whole lot of toasters
Cooler system on it
Pray you never use it
But I ain't tryna see my momma
See a nigga blueish
Album coming soon
Sneaker may come sooner
I got alotta phones
I'm Alleta Reluva
Far as lyrical precision I'm imperial loser
Inferior clueless niggas ain't really conducive
To what we doing here
Fuck is you doing here
I swear these bitches look up to me like I'm doing here
Tear zero
You appear as if you care
Haters you hate on the lives now they hate on the player
Player
You like how I said player didn't ya gentlemen
Playrrrr
Ha

[Hook: Wale]
And I been all around the world
Smoking my reefer
With my dope sneakers
Thousand dollar jeans
Keep the bitches on my dick
'Cuz a nigga so clean cuz
I been all around the world
Smoking on the doja
(Intro - Wale)
I appreciate your resistance shawty
I wouldn't fuck with me either
All of me that is

(1st Verse - Lloyd)
Hey girl, I like what you got on
How bout you take it off
It's just you and me don't be shy
Baby show me what you're working with
Damn you're so fine
I've never seen a body so divine
What you waiting on, come and get it
Baby I just want a little bit, better yet

(Chorus - Lloyd)
Take all of me
All of me
Cause I just wanna give you my all
So can you take all of me
All of me
Your body's telling me what you want
So Ima give it all

(2nd Verse - Lloyd)
Where you going girl, don't run away
You was talking all that shit the other day
Bout how you can take it and how I wasn't ready
Baby I think your mistaken
Cause you're over there, I'm over here
Now you're looking scared, watch it disappear
Told you Ima come correct
And I ain't even break a sweat
Girl I ain't even finished yet

(Chorus - Lloyd)
Can you take all of me
All of me
Cause I just wanna give you my all
So can you take all of me
All of me
Your body's telling me what you want
So Ima give it all

(3rd Verse - Wale)
Hold up, Wale though
Love what she need
But a brova really just can't give in
But that's it what she bring
Got me thinking I can reconsider
Got me thinking she can be my Mrs
Got me thinking that I need to stop tripping
Smoke and talk about our pain
Drink until we in our feelings
Uh, what's rough for her is I like her when I like her
And she dislike the fact cause I like the fact that can't fight back
But she loves more
And she loves hard when she does so when Im on and on
Cause the last time I said the last to my old flame was a false alarm
I know I know I'm not the best
A monogamy would be a optimist
And let God protect as far as having you
Give me half of you, He can have the rest
No promises believe it's all just game girl
Cause if I go inside that I bet you go insane girl

(Chorus - Lloyd)
Take all of me (work)
All of me
Cause I just wanna give you my all
So can you take all of me
All of me
Your body's telling me what you want
So Ima give it all (x3)
Yea, this that good ole top down
For you shawty, just you
So Ima give it all
[Verse 1 : Game & (Mario)]
(Just me and you girl... Woaaahhhhhh)
She leave her hair in the sink
She leave her hair on the floor
Her hair all over the bed, that make me love her more
She wear a scarf, Louis V to be exact
It's a wrap, messing up her wrap, blowing out her back
Never let another rap nigga hit it from back or the front
On my mama nigga, I be gone for months
I come back
(And it's still tight, I like when it's real tight)
I'mma lick in circles now..
(Tell me what that feel like)
Feels like when you try them red bottoms on
It feels like the song cause we all the way gone..
Between me and you, do anything for old girl
Like hit it in the morning, yeah, Cole World

[Hook : Mario]
Baby you're the one
You ain't gotta hit the club no more
Cause we done did that
Tryna find the one
But you been looking for love in all the wrong places
Every day's a movie, girl, you make the scene
They gon keep on watching, give em something to see
We gonna be all the way gone
We gonna be all the way gone

[Verse 2 : Wale]
She call me all the time, I ain't no regular Joe
I be staying at the Roosevelt more than Marilyn's ghost
I met some bitches with Chuck, but I was wearing some Foams
Shorty been fly forever, these bitches' parachutes broke
TC's is on her person I'm aware that you know
And you know the flow, they jack it, I'm apparently cold, you know
Life's lemons is bitter, I need another fruit
She know we can't elope, look at what honey do
Straight G thing, double M G thing
Weed they can't fuck with, I'm puffin A.C. Green
When I peep in the public, bet I'm leaving with something
And I'm so fly I make some homebodies ?? leave the luggage
Shout out Donny Sublime
Shout out Bobby on Hundreds
Not too many is touching, double M G this summer
The RED album, lil red shortie, you can't touch her
I know Mario's on the hook, but I was playing Duck Hunt

[Hook : Mario]

[Verse 3 : Game & (Mario)]
Yeah, he blowing up your cell phone
Send him the voicemail cause we all the way gone
And you ain't doing nothing wrong
But killing the competition in that Cosabella thong
Turn to the side, let me see them thighs
Profile, damn I'm digging your style, we can start slow now
Then speed it up, this playing in the background
While I beat it up - I beat it up
(Baby soon as we get home, it won't take us too long)
(We gon make it to the bedroom, I like the guest room)
(You can pick the next room)
(Put the camera on the tripod, got me playing on your iPod)
(I know you feeling me on my job: Director)
Cut!
[Intro: Wale]
The time is now, on everything
Took my heart away from money
I ain't interested in fame
And I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless
It’s something that’s in your veins
And I put that on my name

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind cause times was harder than a cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the Glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Servin' raw and, fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Ain't get accepted, was rejected and now they regret it
Ain't get my message, was no signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I’ll be the cornerback
Me and Folarin MMG gon' bring that Warner back

[Hook: Wale]
For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
Look, they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
It speaks for itself
Define ambition for me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My ambition to win, just to get me some ends
Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz
I saw momma praying as she wait on results
It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch
My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North
Life was diggin’ me deeper, I kept on coming up short
Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark
Who cut my power off? it’s time to move that powder soft
Not too many options when you coming from the projects
Sittin’ in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper
Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that’s something that's in your veins
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name
And I doubt that ever change

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Well wishes to my opposition
You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
Subscribe, niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
And I ain't spend a minute up in the streets
But I’m limitless mentally, I’m lyrically ZMT
Lebron shit, I was in that 6 after 23
And family is everything, and money is less important
Long as your mama love you, don’t ever love a woman
I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And that ain’t no Donnie Simpson
I retire you niggas: fuck you and your position!
They placeholding so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
Y’all rambling, talking shit to these bitches
You know you real you don’t say it
You know you real, we gon feel it
Ralph!

[Outro: Wale]
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition
