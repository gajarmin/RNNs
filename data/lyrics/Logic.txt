[Verse 1]
I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I’m just not as strong as I once was
When we’re together lately I don’t even feel a buzz
I’m addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go
Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I’m wondering what I’m paying for
All these other bitches on my dick but I can’t fuck with that
You the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black
Tell me where you've been jack
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that’s what I thought at first
Me and you together swear to god I saw that work
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years, goddamn took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can’t fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it’s outrageous
All I know is I’m living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don’t get me wrong, can’t forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won’t
I look away but my head don’t
I love it when you’re fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you
Nothing can replace you
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go
But you’re everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don’t seem to understand
I’m just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
Man you’re everything I crave
You’re the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I’m a king, you’re my Coretta
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine

[Outro]
Slave for the
Said I’m a slave for the nicotine
Been a slave for ya
I’m a muthafuckin slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine
Nikki, Nikki slave for ya
I’m a slave for ya Nikki
I’m a muthafuckin slave for ya

[Hook]
Hold up, let me get my mind right
Let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright
You know everything is all

[Verse 1: Logic]
Just ride with a mothafucka
Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucker hold me down
Chillin' in a-gadda-da-vida, rockin' Adidas
With a senorita and she sippin' liquor by the liter
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino
He know we be in the casino lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito whenever I step on the beat, ho
Like a killer on the creep slow
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with the sawed off
Blowin' up like a molotov
This is war everybody ain’t no reason I'ma call it off
Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright
In the studio everyday so you know this shit about to be a busy night
Everything is all, everything is alright

[Bridge: Big Sean]
It's Finally Famous Over Everything
RattPack Gang
What up though Logic, yeah
Day one shit right there

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Oh my God they plottin' and schemin'
Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'
They tryna take my blessings away
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday
And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got champagne problems, and I order more
My wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up
Hype nigga back-back-back it up
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop
That's the type of shit I boycott
Yellin' fuck the 5.0, state troops
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts
I got these good girls hoin' out
Tell me what the fuck you know about
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know about
Then they throw you in the game then you mothafuckin' blow it out
Now everything is alright

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Logic]
Whippin' through Gotham, hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off ‘em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain but I be killin' cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela
Hit you with a Beretta get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me
Probably wanna fight me, but I just keep the peace
No need to keep a piece
I keep my enemies on a leash capiche?
And keep it real for the people I reach!
[Produced by Logic]

[Hook]
Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'mma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks
Who the bitch riding with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally getting cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothing at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be asking us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judas is who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch I'm still the same
Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasing fame, chasing glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I been working hard, I been searching for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
Cause lately it feel like I’m just not your sister at all, all
I’m sorry for calling and bawling, I’m all in
And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
As as for [?] he left and he ain't coming back
I hate the man, if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting, selling that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To parish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful
Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinking of incredible moments we've had
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of your family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand with me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feeling under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga

[Verse 5]
Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors
I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now
I heard that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati cause then I gotta kill ya. I love you, son, bye
[Verse 1]
Yeah, livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just cause
Type of shit I see and probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug
Basedheads coming through looking for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night its hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Living life to the fullest, I got to blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
God damn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Waking up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat (GunShots) like that
Guarantee you it’s a wrap, finna put you on your back
Like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Got to leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh
Just stop, stop, stop
‘fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even got to drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

[News Reporter]
"Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight."

[Verse 2]
Living life like this, hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it Imma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about
What I pray about, check it uh yeah
Got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I want to run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the- (Gunshots) -in the dead of night
Selling crack to my own pops
Pushing this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
Take the chance cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
[Pause]
Get down or lay down
Hit you with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Living how I'm living with the life that I'm given
Anybody that’s riding with me, I’m riding with them
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit em
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em, and hit 'em with the venom
Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it, already been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang related
[Pre-Hook: Lil Durk]
Cut that music off, I ain't wit' other shit (I'm tryna' turn up)
I ain't tryna chill baby, I'm wit that fuckin' shit (I'm tryna' turn up)
You came for me, well I came from nothin', shit (I'm tryna' turn up)
You ain't fuckin' with me , then who you fuckin' with?

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I'm just tryna, tryna, tryna, tryna (turn up)
All this money, I'm just really tryna (turn up)
With the gang, and I'm really tryna (turn up)
This my city, and I'm tryna tryna (turn up)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
How many licks do it take till you get to the center of her mouth?
She geekin', she tweakin' we turnt up we got it, we all in the pot
KOD, QOD, Magic,  we fuckin the sacks up in five
Gas and mud I be off the drugs, don't touch
I'm feelin' a little cocky
They ring any bitches wanna fuck now
Pop bottles like I won a fuckin' touchdown
If you sober, scoot over, I do drugs now
Party prolly got me all in the clubs now
Pour some lean with no coco, we rockin' rollies, no JoJo
And we off the drinks so slow mo, I get twenty a show, no promo
Bitches get naked and do it for the Vine
So she gon' turn up and do it for the guys
She sippin' on Henny, she mix it wit' Remy
She suckin' on me while I pull on her Remy
She shy like the city but change for them Benji's
The mula, the Fendis, I turn up for what?

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Logic]
Dressed up in that white linen
All black windows, I had to tint 'em
That work work, put 'em in the dirt
Let em' all lurk, know I had to get up with Durk
We never hurt, hurt know the deal
Tour sold out so you know it's real
From the Chi City to the fuckin' bank
Sinatra, money I've been Frank
Lemme get it I got it never feelin' divided only on the real though
How you feel though, V's up, keep it trill though
Oh yeah, one time, oh yeah, one time
Bitch I been under pressure
Always giving it everything that I got
Never the lesser, turn on my compressor
It's right on the dresser
Been ruling the game and nobody could measure
I know it's ...

[Bridge: Logic]
You and me, you and me
They don' give a damn who I am
Bitch I'm doing me (you and me)
I said it's you and me
I know who I am, don't give a damn
Bitch I'm doing me

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]
[Verse 1]
I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corners selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door
While gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker put the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace, and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn you evil
And just don't understand cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit, but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't in a fairy tale, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you've got a fucking problem bitch I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill'em with kindness, yeah we leave ‘em deceased
And tell it like it is and now you got it capish shorty waddup !

[Hook x2]
Let me bring it back down
You think it's a game right now (yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)
Back where I came from now
We're gon' live it up
Till we bring it back down

[Verse 2]
I hope you live a long life hatin'
And watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they'll probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
Rattpack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make a shooting from the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, woah
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it Rattpack, till the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mind stays celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz
My flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor
Murder all rappers in front of they momma's
I rep Artanis
Decipher the word cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra
Yes, I gotcha bitch it's Logic

[Hook]
[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
God damn, god damn, conversations with legends
Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus
Money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe and think down and leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack, cooking where my sister be frying soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass, I kill him, I kill him, I motherfucking kill him
I said I really want to kill him, but I can't
Cause if I do po po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it, I grip the mic and then kill it
Okay, I'm gone, as memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin’, sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little bobby, just a youngin’, skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Can’t take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day I pay homage to the Gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I’m from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon
Catch me rollin’ with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I’m De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like Thriller
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We don’t do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does

[Thalia]
Hip Hop

[Part 2]

[Interlude]
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

[Verse 2]
See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be
Bitch, I said I bet I be
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me how is they gonna remember me
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just because I was different, just because I was doing what I love
And the fans they say they love you, but they push and they shove
Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hundred
I just see it as a challenge,  I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry about bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun
So when people that never knew me they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?
I just stop, and do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending one must understand the prequel
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him
Spit it like Holy water, prophetically repent 'em then we gone
[Verse 1: Logic]
Living life like this is so crazy
This world is amazing
One day you're on top and then she having your baby
Living life like this I get down... Uhh
When they come around
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop this shit, they gonna run it back
Stupid shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money, my bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back cause I'm gone
[Verse 1]
See, I’m a motherfucking lyricist, bitches they fearing us
Back in the day they wasn't hearing this, now I’m the one who’s steering this
I’m self-driven, will he kill it? – That’s a lyrical given
New-School style but the 90’s is where my lyrics living
My flow is like another Earth, Second nature
I disintegrate ya’, migrate ya’, then light-saber decapitate ya’
In the beginning they said it was fabricated, as soon as the numbers escalated
But these fuckers just mad that I made it
More chains than when a slave traded check it
I’m under MC’s skin like muscle tissue, what’s the issue?
If you talking shit then Im’a hit you
Grab a pistol then whip you, then dip you in lava, ain’t no one ‘liver
Second I arrive I murder it, no you never heard of it
So sick my lyrics I don’t spit – I regurgitate them
As listeners chronologically study my words, verbatim
Assassinate em’, the second I raid them like five-0
We pull off the heist and flee to Cabo now
I mask emotions like a robbery, cause when it comes to matters of the heart
Women will clog your arteries
Visionary - V’s up – Rattpack
Young Sinatra, Maryland's what I'm reppin'
Conceal the flow behind the image like a murder weapon
[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Your boy got it popping like Crisco
Number one independent on the east coast
I rep the streets, I don't do it for the weirdos
I am really with the [?] yo
I been having women and gold around my neck
I'm a hustler, what the fuck do you expect?
Roll with the lex, ride Benz don't roll with the Lex
But y'all push 700's they ain't mold to you yet
Been getting bread so long, is there mold on it yet?
Something like a pimp no ring on my pinky
Full in fur, coming through all minky
Big cuban chains coming through all linky
Shitting on haters, leave you all stinky
Phew!
Said I would leave you blue
Get it, men do what they say
Troy Ave did it
I brought New York back like Earl the Pearl
Now BSB records 'bout to conquer the world

[Verse 2: Detroit Che]
Yo, yo, yo
Last year I was watching it from the couch
I stayed in tune with all my dreams
Haters see me living them out
I'm from Detroit, Michigan, homie, it's the home of the Lions
My homies was dying, rock hoodies during moments of silence
Passionate, practicing activists doper than [?] put a cap in this
Renisha's shooter switched it and said he did it on accident
Rest in peace to Mcbride and Mike brown and Trayvon
They days gone and they was so young and it touched me
Like an iPod but I won't cry
Government they gave us nothing and they say that we don't try
We get robbed like corner stores for justice and I'm so tired
I'm super tired like carrying ten Mariahs
Put tires around my neck I'm finna start a riot (let's go)
This the book of hip hop [?] illustrate
Don't compare me to Nicki, my titties been deflated
And that wasn't a diss, I swear I look up to that chick
But critics be talking regardless putting these bloggers in coffins
Queen Che

[Verse 3: Dee-1]
Just holla at me if you need that real
And if it's true that words are weapons, Dee packs steel
I did it solo, no aid
But Dee's that ill, I [?]
And thieves that kill can't steal that skill for real
I'm a positive black man, beware in the streets
Don't compare me unless it's to the man America leads
Sit back an reteach [?]
Unashamed coming for they neck, watch your clavicle
They say "Dee, who was your cosign?", mine was God
My watch made out of concrete, times was hard
You's a mental slave dog, why you robbing and stealing
Money don't buy happiness, ask Robin Williams
I'm in the building, I'm probably on that pelligrino
Dolphin that rhymes on my feet, I think I'm Dan Marino
It's Uno, cut the deck, you know he won
Cause New Orleans watching this saying "Go Dee-1!" (yeah)

[Verse 4: Logic]
Allow me to murder this
For anybody that may not have heard of this
It's the L-O-G-I-C I'm repping MD yes y'all know the deal
We keep it real all the time, V's up, that's on my mind
I'm feeling infinite, like Eminem's first album
Speak to the people like Malcolm
Murder your mind in a minute, like the Millenium Falcon
Rip the mic and yeah I know the outcome
Check it, I'm biracial, but couldn't tell by the facial
So everybody swears that his parents wasn't interracial
But if I had dreads, sold drugs and screamed "Fuck the feds!"
Then maybe, just maybe they might give me some street cred
Even though I grew up with that all in my house
Ain't gotta glorify that shit, there's more to talk about, but
Don't get it twisted, I'm far from a mad rapper
If anything I'm the finest of dead president kidnappers
I got so much on my mind but not enough time to mention
Cause I'm ripping and living and striving and killing [?] going and flowing
I'm only spitting this fast cause that's how y'all gonna pay attention
Cause we on TV
See they don't care about what I'm saying, just how I'm saying it
So I gotta spit it fast and make sure that there's no delaying
Yeah, well, but if you're one of the few that want the real and not the lesser
Go to iTunes and cop that Logic album "Under Pressure"
Yeah

[Verse 5: Lil' Mama]
I said don't ask me about no broads, no rap wars
I do this for my Mike Brown brothers that's really at war
Therefore, y'all better close y'alls jaws
When it come to me, cause y'all gonna need wraps and gauze
I'm the underdog, clear, y'all ain't gotta like me
Gather your best armor bodying me less than likely
I swear on James Brown if you try me
Red Hook Summer like Spike Lee
Bloody gloves, we in the ring like carats
This ain't the first quarter, but I'm balling like it's March Madness
Heh? I got 'em pinched cause I'm lavish
When you're in a motel you better hold your bladder
Now what they talking about this MC deficit?
Like I will run up on that stigma put a death to it
Man, realize that I'm the best at this
And I don't gotta wear a dress to be addressing this
[Verse 1: Lungz]
I am legend, legendary position
Vision blurry behind the wheel of my drugs’ prescriptions
Got no love for these bitches
Got no love for these niggas
They don’t fit the description
They distorting my friction
My addiction is money
Undeniable habit
I'm still writing my story laid out with something Spanish
She fucked me like a demon got her speaking in tongues
We on the roof overlooking the city I’m from
All the places I’ve been many places I’ve hung
Same shit that I spit
Same shit that I slung
This is more than just life they ain’t doing it right
I’m just writing my wrongs 20/20 in sight

[Hook: Lungz]
I got that 20/20 vision I can see the money clearer
I was wrong was before now I’m right
Watch me bang and fuck the picture
It’s just me and all my niggas and my bitches
My nigga it’s the life
It's the life (x8)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Drop top with a couple bad bitches in the back of the 'Lac you know the deal
Let me get it up RattPack how we live it up little bit of Hennessy up in the cup
All up in the cut, Motherfucker what
Maryland what I be repping the moment I step in I’m killing this shit
Killing and killing this shit
Fast cars bad hoes fuck that I got mad shows
I guess this is the life that God chose
Finally high but I been low
I got vision boy that’s 20/20 getting paid but man fuck the money
It’s that real recognize real tell me how you feel
They say they gotta lot of money but they never seen a mill
Grip the steel but they never kill all they do is grill
I just keep posting up with my homies man we got different blood but you know we fam
Living my life till the fullest by keeping it real
Yeah you know I am

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lungz]
One time for my niggas in the cold night (go right) ???
North side and you know where I’m from right
Like you ain't never really know right
Niggas shy till I put 'em in a low ride (light)
Might have to ride around in your side of town
With my music up If I wake your neighbors and they start complaining I don’t give a fuck
Got 20/20 no specs on
Rear view nigga get lost
Blue print now I gotta plan
Fuck a Traffic jam I just drive thru it
Fuck the bullshit I learn to slide through it
Lungz with logic you don’t want a problem
Fuck the progress they just digest be silent no violence
Big dollars I digest you put a topic no subject
Less was more, more was less big picture more success
Vision blurred I'm focus you hopeless and you know this I'mma keep rhyming till I’m homeless I’m chosen and you know this

[Hook]
[Hook: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe

(Fight!)

[Verse 1: QuEst]
Chip on my shoulder, fuck is you sayin' ?
Swear to God our fathers were playing nigga relay the message
Breathless, every morning was forced to skip on breakfast
Mama told me don't let these peasants throw rocks at the king
Pawns tend to carry on with no conscience
Straight non-sense, pay homage or K's vomit, verbal
Fucker wanna know Biggie was making certain while niggas was getting iffy
Heart is bigger than derrières of Vicky and Nicki
But fuck up and diss me, this shit will 360
And must I mention my body count?
It's murderous, to be humble
Murder is to be humble?
Ever heard of me stumble?
I was born in the jungle where niggas belly's will rumble
Get checked for thinking or mumble
But y'all still stuck on rap
Fuck all that
I do this in my slumber, merely ventilation
Tryna stay afloat be on a boat shit
I swear that I'm lost inside of the spirit of Biggie back in his lumberjack
Or Nasir with the fatigue, I felt stifle, street's disciple
My raps are trifle, I shoot slugs for my...you get the picture
I was raised in Miami, niggas'll smack your coofie
Just for acting coochie, your goofy actions'll never move me
No sir, needy no, all my homies is ready to roll
Never the matter the chitter and chatter
I did it cause I can machete the flow
And comeback, here's a fun fact
I'm not a dumb act, run that
Little punk rat, fuck it, Pun's back
In the middle of Little Havana
Holding a hammer outside with pajamas
Better watch your grammar around me
These haters surround me, I swear it's unnecessary
Gambino, you childish niggas could never see the shit that I do
VMG, yes nigga VMG
Only competition that we see is TDE

[Hook]

Happy birthday to my nigga doe
(Fight!)

[Verse 2: C Dot Castro]
Imma be the guy that rap slow, sike nah
Dictating bitches and smoking Cubans, I'm Castro
My life is like the movie, and I'll be the director
And just to get a small role, got bitches acting extra
I wrote this verse in one minute cause Bobby said that he wants rhymes
Intelligent, but I'm getting brain from bitches that's dumb fine
Got punchlines like prom with the, world on my palm
I knew that we would blow up cause bitch, we be the bomb
Rattpack out to get the cheese, drop a verse get fifty Gs
Hit the studio drunk as fuck but still drop a verse with ease
I don't give a fuck
Bitch you know the flow is second nature
With no pen and paper break it down disintegrate a hater, wassup

[Hook]

(Fight!)

[Verse 3: Jon Bellion]
Let's have a money conversation
Four hundred thousand from Eminem that's a payment
Kennedy Reagans presidential arrangement
Please don't let this Pop kid take it back to the basement
I'm still here screaming Beautiful Mind
Sick of the noodles of rhyming all my cubical grind
So I just grew and decided to put you in your spot
Ooodles and boodles of blue bags from Louis Vuitton
Getting money with lawyers we have a Jew of a time
With liquor in a Poland Spring like a Junior at prom
Yes I chose to pop charts I'm doing the crime
And that just means I'm fucking dope to you and your mom
Working in the summer, AC on freezing
Working in the winter like I got no heaters
Spring rolls at the damn four seasons
In the Red Octobers screaming thank you Yeezus

[Hook]

(Finish him!)

[Verse 4: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Chilling with me and my Tribe
Gotta spit this to survive
How long have I been alive?
Twenty-four years and counting not including my momma womb
I'm here in the lab, and I'll be here until the tomb
Album coming soon watch the Rattpack consume
I've been on that real shit
That fun shit
Spit artillery, like a gunship
V's up we run shit
Don't come around with that dumb shit it's scandalous
In the studio in Los Angeles
At No I.D. spot hit you with the heat rock goddamn
With Bobby on the board everybody on the floor
Hold up let me take a breath here come more
This a freestyle let me redirect my intellect
Drop this shit just for fun, it's all over the internet
Cause bitch I'm in effect
Wait hold up, y'all did get the Memo?
You Lumbergh rappers is Initech
Bitch I've been a fact
Hit you like Hiroshima then intercept
Check it yo
See now all the real fans know the album goin be crazy
Spit it off the top and get dirty like Pat Swayze
From the cover of XXL
Fuck around and then propel
Tour coming soon man I know the tickets finna sell
Really, coming for everybody's Achilles
Put my own money into this album, like half a millie
It's Logic, coming for their neck no disrespect
I did this shit in two minutes or less
Spent a year on the album, who knows what to expect (Sinatra)
Spent a year on the album, who knows what to expect
This is Logic

(Flawless Victory)
Happy birthday to me motherfucker
It's my birthday !

[Hook]
[Intro]
Wake up, you bitch-ass
Cracker-ass motherfucker

[Verse 1]
See all I ever wanted was a window to sit close to
And you don't understand but in the end you ain't supposed to
I'm talking first class, 30,000 feet under my ass
Living life on the dash, constant pursuit of cash
Now I'm living a life that you and yours could only dream about
And just a couple years ago this shit I used to scheme about
Rehearsing for hours in front of my mirror
Until my voice was hoarse but my vision was clearer
See this that new school style but the flow remind you of them old days
Fast forward to the present, rappers have no class like snow days
Good God, let me bring it back to hip-hops first renaissance
96' Kool-Aid and Sega Genesis

[Hook]
"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
I love the way your lyrics make me feel"
Roll it and get high, Light it up and fly
Feeling like I'm 30,000 feet up in the sky

I got em' saying

"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
I love the way your lyrics make me feel"
Roll it and get high, Light it up and fly
Feeling like I'm 30,000 feet up in the sky

[Verse 2]
So many people think that they know my whole situation
Conversations with people that handle public relations
Nothing but hundred dollar bills and standing ovations
Slowly pacing until I kill like that boy Jason
It ain't nothing, never folding or bluffin'
Get money, fuck bitches but respect women cause we love em'
Kiss em', touch em' and rub em'
Fuck em' but never grub em'
Hit it fast but then I slow it down like Robitussin
Shorty giving me brain until concussion
The club run out of vodka the second we rush in
Never under estimate the power in which I'm bustin'
My lyricism got yo girl blushin'
Ain't even touch her and yet she gushin' (ha)
Award shows, chilling with all my bros
Three-piece Ralph Lauren and some Jordans, I suppose

[Hook]
[Woman Singing]

[Intro]
"I love her smile, I love her hair, I love her teeth. I love this heart-shaped birthmark she has on her neck. I love the way she sometimes, licks her lips before she talks. I love the sound of her laugh"

[Verse]
I can feel it now
It's coming soon
It is my world, my sun and moon
Once upon a time, this world was love
But now I know this is everything that I've dreamed of
So take it slow
Speed it up
Every time I see you I just want to beat it up
Maybe not, but that's a lie
C'mon baby girl, there ain't no need to cry
Just let me go, or let me know
Why the hell you wanna stick around fo'
Arms length
That's all you do, don't get to close, that is the rule
I remember when I met her back in high school
Science class, sitting on the stool
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Cause I cut that tie months ago, this girl is cruel
Maybe not, just very lovely
No matter what she says I know she still loves me
So can I love?
I've already asked
Who would've known matters of the heart would be such a task?

[Interlude]
"I hate summer, I hate her crooked teeth. I hate her 1960s haircut. I hate her knobby knees. I hate her cockroach-shaped splotch on her neck. I hate the way she smacks her lips before she talks. I hate the way she sounds when she laughs"

[Verse]
She used to be my girl
But now she just a girl I'm fucking
She used to mean the world to me but now that world is nothing
I would've put a ring on that finger but I couldn't afford it
So I laced it with ribbon, she adored it
Sometimes I wonder if she thinks of me
But my mind tells me to focus on work so instinctively
How could the pussy be that good?
Cause my feelings involved
Till my shorty evolved
And her feelings dissolved
But that's what happens when you find them young
Treat them like royalty, and they will run
Searching the world for perfect love and realize you're the one
But they fucked up cause now that shit is done
This is a letter to the woman of my dreams
Love what she brings
So listen baby girl cause everything ain't what it seems
You either know me now
Or I'mma meet you after fame
But one thing's for sure
Your life will never be the same
Cause you're gonna be my wife and my mistress
So understand now I can't be there for every Christmas
I love you more than anything, but I could never risk this
On stage living life, while you're forced to miss this
[Verse 1]
I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corners selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door
While gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker put the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace, and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn you evil
And just don't understand cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit, but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't in a fairy tale, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you've got a fucking problem bitch I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill'em with kindness, yeah we leave ‘em deceased
And tell it like it is and now you got it capish shorty waddup !

[Hook x2]
Let me bring it back down
You think it's a game right now (yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)
Back where I came from now
We're gon' live it up
Till we bring it back down

[Verse 2]
I hope you live a long life hatin'
And watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they'll probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
Rattpack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make a shooting from the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, woah
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it Rattpack, till the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mind stays celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz
My flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor
Murder all rappers in front of they momma's
I rep Artanis
Decipher the word cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra
Yes, I gotcha bitch it's Logic

[Hook]
[Intro]
Now if you feeling how I'm feeling put your hands up high
If you feeling how I'm feeling put your lighters in the sky

[Verse 1]
Now if you feeling how I'm feeling put your hands up high
If you feeling how I'm feeling put your lighters in the sky
I'll be damned if I ain't living the life I always wanted
Started from the bottom as a youngin' gettin' blunted
Now I run it like a marathon, ho
Yeah it's on, ho
Hits motherfucker, hits Barry Bonds, ho
In the studio for twenty two days
I'm too paid
Might fuck around and kick flip in my new J's
I got a show in Paris then Tokyo so I'm lu paid
Fucked a shorty in Paris I'm getting crème brûlée

[Hook x2]
Fuck a 9 to 5
I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dreams

[Verse 2]
How you feeling, ho?
I'm making a killing, ho, really doe
Talking all that shit behind my back just Like a silly (Ho)
Had a dream Dr. King
Now that money ain't a thing
I've been through a lot of pain, looking like we overcame!
Goddamn! Life just ain't the same, all ya'll know my name
Fuck the fame, Maryland where I came
Broke up in the game, and it feels good, good, real good, good
Now we livin' in the hills pissing off the neighborhood
It's just me Castro and 6ix, going crazy in this bitch
Plus my homie Jon
And the whole RattPack you know we on
Livin the life of a don
While my homie Slay roll up the swisher
I get richer while they hate, watch the Money Gravitate
Finally eatin' grab a plate
Hell yeah that's sounding great
I've been high, I been low, but there's one thing that I know:
It's been a long time coming now my whole team got it
And if you hatin' suck a dick and bitch about it

[Hook x2]

[Interlude]
You know it's funny doe, man, white people be frontin'
And you ever noticed like you'd be the only nigga some place
And you go where white people, they be like:
"You wanna move out of the way fellas? Excuse me, thank you very much - taking up all the fucking area, Jesus Christ!"
I love when white dudes get mad and cuss
Cause y'all are some funny motherfuckers when you cuss!
They be saying shit like "Alright cut the shit! Facking jerk off!"
[Intro]
This right here, homie
This got first tape shit, you know what I’m saying? For my real heirs
All my real hip hop motherfuckers, they know they're losing shit, you know what I mean ?
So we gon' get it like this
Let that beat drop, Psychological

[Verse 1]
I spit fifties and shit hundreds
Do shit that's undid
Spontaneously combust in these bitches guts
I get 'em wet, no need to touch
Break their back like Dutches
Keep 'em close like the toast I clutch
Never the less
I'm never depressed
I keep feelings suppressed
One of the best but need to listen if I'mma progress
I'm ready to live, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to ride for rap
I said it on a record, now I can't take it back
Stop, I shut it down like a bloodclot
Smoke MCs, like a fuckin bumbaclot
Mic check, I come to catch wreck
Death before dishonor so I'm coming for your neck
I pop MCs like Hymens
Y'all glass posing in studs but I'm a diamond
Now recon, you need to listen
I'm never dissin'
Unless your shit is wack, I'll beat you into submission
Catch me fishin'
Cause I'm eating for a lifetime
Wisdom in my mind
I'm a star watch me shine
Fucking your bitch from behind
Record it and hit rewind
I'm nasty, construct rhymes like rhinoplasty
A hip-hop statue
Rhymes coming at you, God bless you
When I kick wisdom it never stress you or test you
Unless you a dumb ass motherfucker

(Psychological) Yeah, no want no more
Fuck it, ayo

[Verse 2]
Said this is mathematic tactics
Murder this rap shit
Intravenously inject my prophylactics
Inhale my words like a fresh batch of Vicks
Similar to black ice cause the flow so slick
What's up, rappers hear the rhyme they slit they wrists up
Do a whole 'lotta talking, no rapping like fisticuffs
Ah, yeah, (Turn my headphones up)
That's all you sayin' but I'm sprayin' and I can't get enough
Raw, rugged and rough
My alter ego, Mr. Tough
I'll call your bluff
Face to face never snuff
I murder you with predicate poetic balletic shit
No mercy cause if I grip the mic they might curse me
Da Vinci flow
Then I grip the mic I'm in control
Before I manifested tendons I was rhyming as a embryo
Living in vertigo
Half of these fuckers don't know

Yeah, all day
Drop tracks like that
All nuts in
Maryland stand up, that's it
I'm out, peace, one love
Fuck if you doubt me

(You are watching a master at work)
Dawg, Dawg, Would you care for a glass of grape juice?
Nigga, what the fuck is juice?
I want some grape drink, baby
[Intro]
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...

[Hook x2]
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing how to grind
Knockin doors down, showing how to grind
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing how to grind
I'ma, I'mma come through and show my wood pine


[Verse 1: Logic]
Boy I know my shit was on another level
When people would joke around and say I signed with the devil
Cause it's gotta be a sin to be this good
Hating on my music shit I wish you would (i wish you would)
Yeah I been offered four of five deals
Bust like banana clips boy that's four or five kills
Doing the most accumulating so much bread
I think it's time for toast and I ain't talking fine wine
I'm talking semi-automatic shit that blow your mind
Then when I blow like mine the whole world gon' see me shine
This is the life that I should live homie
I'm never going back, I'm addicted to the game
Y'all can tell by the tracks

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x2]
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough


[Verse 2: Logic]
I'm addicted to the game, addicted to the pain
Of sacrificing matters of the heart just to obtain
Living a life that most won't attain
And I know it is essential
But when it comes to love, man, that shit is subsequential
For now I just be chillin' with ballers
Poppin collars, pushing Impalas, cutting records and counting dollars
I'm addicted, my lines is cocaine
And when they disperse blow minds like propane
And you know these haters that never made it this mad
Cause they never had what we had
Addicted to the game and I'm glad
On my Amy Whinehouse I'm saying fuck Rehab

[Hook]

[Outro]
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...
Produced by Statik Selektah

[Hook: Francesca]
Is it real?
Is it fake?
I woke up, suddenly I just woke up

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Look, yo, it only makes sixth sense
They sleep on the creator of Pineal Gland
No offense taken, I’m just racin’, the savior of man
Crucifix, positive, addition, it’s all the same
Given that getting head is cool, but what is it if you don’t use your brain
That’s one plane, negative subtraction, but still a balance
If dyslexic then play this shit backwards
Uh, the black lip captain of the ship
When you dividing the pie, rats come, it’s all math son
So is it really really real? Or do you need to shapen up my G?
I’m a tree, you know peace be still
The irony of my movement, they eyeing my every movement
The pioneer of the future, another Statik selection
With a dab of perfection
Whether it’s wax in your bong or your eardrum
I’m here now, I’m guessing you live in fear now
So be it, when they speak about the real Soul be it, no debate
Don’t just give ‘em the fish, teach ‘em to fish, let ‘em pro-create Shout out to Joey and ‘em, was dope before the cake
I went from selling records out my record shop
To my record selling out the record shop
That’s a paradox like a pair of yachts

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
It’s hard to be optimistic when Connor’s your opposition
Ain’t no competition, you just a confident contradiction
And what I am in the future, refuse to dispute it
I’ll prove it through music and all you dudes can do is salute it
The most authentic, they get lost in it, I spit raw venom
Jump when I say jump, I feel like Kriss Kross, nigga
Never average, cut from different fabric, fans they never last
My shit’s eternal
Moving so fast that I probably won’t notice a hurdle
Look, Best of the best expect nothing less on my quest
To save the game, I’m walking around like there’s an “S” on my chest
It’s Aftermath out here acting bad, I wave the flag
We the only thing moving, the fuck you go’ say to that?
No lies, all truth, make all you call truce
Watch all just fall off like you tossed off a tall roof
For getting this verse off I paid the cost of the lawsuit
‘Cause I keep hitting them hard with these lines and they all through
Connor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Logic]
Another day another dollar from that 9 to 5
Yeah, you living but ask yourself, are you really alive?
I worked outside, I worked with food, I worked behind the desk
I’ve even hustled around my block, but hold up, I digress
I’ve paid my dues, see this life I didn’t choose
My face on the ten o'clock news, shit I refuse
I was born in a lower class, where gangsters with dough amass
And police would ask questions, but we never answered when asked
Momma bitching while my sister baby daddy cooking crack in the kitchen
Getting rich in the street from slanging prescription
He showed me how to cook it, he showed me how to cut it
But deep down I always knew that life just wouldn’t cut it
So I started writing, it was a dark time
Only fifteen, but the shit I seen would blow your mind
School was getting harder due to my life at home
Principal always calling ‘cause I had barely shown
No father figure, my mother tried her best to be both
But let’s be honest a father really helps with your growth
But I was raised by Nas and Jay-Z and Big L and Eminem
All of them set examples through they lyrics
Listen close so I could hear it, about life and how not to fear it
How to grab the wheel and steer it, and so I
And so I did just that
Word of advice follow your dreams and never look back
I said it’s Logic

[Hook]
[Intro]
"Ayo, shout out to Black Diamond. I got them Nikes on my feet as we speak, homie. Shout out to Mac... Miller..."

[Hook]x2
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

[Verse 1]
My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my grind
And at this moment in time, I’m on a road when I write this rhyme
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while he’s passed out
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out, oh my
Good god you know we fly
Day dreaming out the window watch how buildings pass me by
See I ain’t signed but at this point in time
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl
All I do is rhyme and get money, that’s my repertoire
Holla at honeys, "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?"
Baby what’s the deal, have you ever heard of some shit so real?
(Cudi what up?) It’s going down, feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare

[Hook]x2

[Verse 2]
This is the joint that when you hear it you like, "That’s my shit!"
Maybe at a house party while you getting lit
Or while you cruising round town riding in a whip
One thing’s for sure, you better get all of your friends hip
If a shorty like my music, then she a (bobbysoxer)
Got a booty, know how to use it, homie yes I rocks her
The second I jump on a stage, I’m rocking it, ain’t nobody stopping it
Whoever goes on after me, I’m sorry, you ain’t topping it
It’s going down, feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare

[Hook]x2

[Verse 3]
Ever since I was a youngin I knew I’d break in the game
While you worshipped other rappers that leave you less entertained
I was strategizing, before the people knew my name
Fame, but I shall attain on the road to success
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain
Yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito
I know we fight, but that’s poquito
Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito

[Hook]x2
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ayo I force MC's to bleed, retreat and recede
That's the Young Sinatra creed
Killin' a track with incredible speed
And doin' it like it's nothin' no bluffin', gotta kill it everyday though
Slice MC's like Kato, gotchya head spinnin' like dreidel
Assassinate em so fatal, grip the heat and then tell ya to freeze
Gettin' chedda' at negative 30 degrees
I'm talkin' mula, money, euro, dollars, that yen
Blow it, let's spend it again, I'm livin' the life until the end
Can't comprehend what I got goin'
Never knowin' when Logic flowin', cause I'm creepin'
Like ether the way that I seep in
Swimmin' in women like the deep end
Chillin' with shorties that smoke reefer and blow like aretha
Uh, now, Sinatra said the best revenge is massive success
I guess that's women and multiple digits in excess
Ya family broke bread but my family's bread was soggy
'Til my brother's broke bricks like Mr. Miyagi
Now what the fuck…

[Verse 2]
All of a sudden I feel the inner killer emergin'
Never splurgin' bingin' money and never purgin'
Urgin' women to fuck on the rug cause it's imported Persian
Then bypass matters of the heart like a surgeon
Now, it's hard to ball when there's problems within the inner circle
One moment they cool as Stephan and flip it like Urkel
Or flip it like keys, yeah they flip it like ki's
From drug lords overseas that export it with ease
Bitch please we stack cheese so old it's mold
I'm 'bout that money so excuse me if my heart is cold
The magnum deployed, then I destroy mattresses
Late night love affairs with New York City actresses
I, Broke in the game and destroyed the first couple stages
Visionary takin' over regardless of our ages
Makin' history today to solidify in the pages of tomorrow
The industry is fucked, nothin' but sorrow but I'm
Playin' for keeps in other words no need to borrow
So you can keep your advances, wack hooks, and pop dances
Don't get me wrong, I'm all about the mainstream
As long as I sign the deal I want and have the same team
And now they trippin' like a flight to Vegas
Tellin' me that I'll never make it and this shit is outrageous
Now what the fuck...

[Verse 3]
Therefore you never mourn like a memory repressed
MC's digest quicker than bullets shot from a gat with the barrel suppressed
One to the dome, two to the chest
If by chance they got a vest, however nevertheless
I'm lookin' for that real deal, shit that make me feel
Pleasure and pain, ain't no way to measure the game
I got haters in 57 languages watch me vanquish this
The come up, bust quicker than 357 caliber
Sharp as Excalibur, crushin' muthafuckas like Galaga now
Time is money, something you can never recoop (recuperate)
So stop wastin' mine, hit rewind and then fuckin' regroup
Never messed with them chicken heads, but watch me in the coup
Never in public cause I'm a studio fiend
Rockin' diamonds and gettin' money, we call that ice cream
Now, allow me to give you the scoop, shit I'll make it a double
I came up around more rocks than Barney Rubble
Murderers and drug dealers, I knew it no rebuttal ain't no need to claim it
Picked up the heat but never aimed it now
Jay gave us The Blueprint, I lay the foundation
Tell ya what I'm facin', bars like incarceration
Cause my mind is always racin', ain't no time for vacations
I'm never pacin', unless I'm on the phone talkin' business, get wit' this
Best witness like Christmas, I'm fuckin' rappin'
Walkin' the spot and all these haters go for the dap and I never carried them
Kill 'em with kindness then bury 'em, yeah!
I was born with talent, God gave me the gift
And now I pull more strings than guitar riffs
Now what the fuck…
Now that's all sinatra everything!

[Hook]
Hold up, let me get my mind right
Let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright
You know everything is all

[Verse 1: Logic]
Just ride with a mothafucka
Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucker hold me down
Chillin' in a-gadda-da-vida, rockin' Adidas
With a senorita and she sippin' liquor by the liter
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino
He know we be in the casino lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito whenever I step on the beat, ho
Like a killer on the creep slow
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with the sawed off
Blowin' up like a molotov
This is war everybody ain’t no reason I'ma call it off
Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright
In the studio everyday so you know this shit about to be a busy night
Everything is all, everything is alright

[Bridge: Big Sean]
It's Finally Famous Over Everything
RattPack Gang
What up though Logic, yeah
Day one shit right there

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Oh my God they plottin' and schemin'
Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'
They tryna take my blessings away
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday
And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got champagne problems, and I order more
My wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up
Hype nigga back-back-back it up
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop
That's the type of shit I boycott
Yellin' fuck the 5.0, state troops
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts
I got these good girls hoin' out
Tell me what the fuck you know about
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know about
Then they throw you in the game then you mothafuckin' blow it out
Now everything is alright

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Logic]
Whippin' through Gotham, hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off ‘em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain but I be killin' cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela
Hit you with a Beretta get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me
Probably wanna fight me, but I just keep the peace
No need to keep a piece
I keep my enemies on a leash capiche?
And keep it real for the people I reach!
[Hook]
Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go
Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go
(Hey!) Are you ready to go? Ready to go
Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go

[Verse 1: Logic]
On my Charlie Sheen, homie, yes I am a winner
And when it comes to making music, I am no beginner
Hit the stage and get wild, my braniac's loud
Call me 007 because I bond with the crowd
You shine like a star but I sun it
50 keep it a 100, homie you know I run it
The game needs change and Logic can break a 100
I had a shorty to bun it, until she didn't want it
So I focused on the flow and they gon' put me on the map
With a pocket full of change, every day a different dime
Only fuck with golden girls and I ain't talking Lifetime
When I rhyme they up on me cause they seen how I'mma shine
Now you may be wondering how my raps rock
Cause I'm so fifth key to the right of Caps Lock
And when my tracks drop I'mma be sipping Ciroc
With a whole skyline chilling in the backdrop

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Phil Ade]
Shit, nigga I was born ready
And I swear I'm what these rappers can’t bear, warn teddy
My Pro Tools bouncing like a '64 Chevy
I'm trying to win fast y'all on that Eddie
Plus Carl and Harriet, G is how I carry it
Been in it for miles, don't believe ask Darius
Running this beach like Chariots of Fire
I aspire to be higher than these superficial liars
The attire I acquire cost a grip, buy your pliers
I'm a ball out and die in Maryland, Len Bias
Apply a sire to my name, yeah you ain't know I'm royal
I foil from slick talk, yeah trip of that oil
Toying with girls feelings, lord forgive me I need healing
I know you said it's wrong but a long would make a killing
Hit the bong I hit the ceiling, hit the drink I hit the floor
If they show 'em in the buildin to the crowd then let me know

[Hook]

[Repeat Intro]
[Intro]
I know what it's like
To be all, all depressed
And not wanna go out and
And live life man
That's not healthy man
You can't be living like that what's wrong with you?

Hi
Yeah hey you, yeah you
Yea yea uh huh
I know you been feeling down
There's something's pissin you off
And something's wrong- you know what
We're gonna, I'm gonna cheer you up
I'm gonna help you out
Just go ahead and just
And just listen alright?
Here we go

[Verse 1]
Hi there hey friend how are you
Cheer on up you superstar you
Don't let them try you
Fuck that shit
Don't let them deny you
Cause you're gonna make it some day
And you're gonna make it some way
No more waitin for the bus
And no more riding on the subway
Live life how you want to
So get on up now go get out there
Face your fears
No need to be scared
You better rebel
And if they hate you give 'em hell
No more hiding in your shell
Cause we are not defined
By how hard we fall
So dust yourself off and stand tall
Cuz you can make it
Of this im sure
Just spread your wings
And you will soar

[Hook]
I know
I know, know
That I'm gonna blow
You away
And when I wake up
I'm gonna shake up
The fuckin' world
And you're gonna love me
You're gonna take me
As I am (as I am)
And not a single one of you
Can tell me no
Ohhhh yea

[Verse 2]
I'mma go where nobody before me has gone
And I know that the journey is gonna be long
Livin' life like a mademan like a don
I was in the dark but now all the lights on
It's real hard on the rise to fame
Cause everybody's mad and you're the one to blame
And just last year you didn't know my name - Logic
Now they all demand it
Used to hate me and I can't stand it
Cuz now you love me you so damn manic
Said I'll never make it said I'll fail
My ship would sink
But motherfucker I sailed
I know I'm gonna prevail
Eyes on the prize right on my trail
Middle finger to the haters that are on my tail
Cause I got heart boy I got spunk
Feelin' just like Jordan before the dunk
And if you fuck around I'mma put you in the trunk
*Ha* I'm just playin around
Wait for the sound (wait for the sound)
Wait for the sound (wait for the sound)
Oooowwwwww

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I swear to God that I love the life I live
And I'm grateful for every breathe it gives
I remember thinkin' something's got to give
New day but it all just feels the same
No clouds but I can feel the rain
Pointin' fingers lookin' for someone to blame (lookin' for someone to blame)
'Til I came across my own name
I wasn't in control of my destiny
Feelin' empty thinkin where's the rest of me
I gotta make it but I need the recipe
Only then will I find the best of me
I didn't wanna listen, didn't give a fuck
I was so selfish, I was so stuck
Cleanin up food, for a little buck
Then I quit that, livin' on luck
I was so lost, at what cost
Why be the worker, when you could be the boss
Still doin' wrong, trynna live right
Get my mind righteous, man I what a fight
Shit gettin tight, man that ain't right
And my girl left, so I just might
So I just might
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and uh
Happiness last, and uh
Haters kiss my aaaaaaaaaaaa(ss)
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and uh
Happiness last, and uh
Haters kiss my aaaaaaaaaaaa(ss)
[Intro: Phil Ade]
Yo it's your boy Phil Ade
Ah man it's crazy here
Logic I think they're ready for it
Let's get it !

[Verse 1: Logic]
Yeah I got it now what is it
Pay the world a visit
Let them know I'm 'bout it with this golden ticket
See my curriculum is flippin' 'em
A hundred and fifty one yeah we sippin' 'em,
Bitches they trippin' all up in the club
Show me love if you really 'bout it
I don't never doubt it
One of the best out of Maryland I'm down to shout it (oh really ?)
Never cocky I'm just confident the flow is prominent
This is the reason that I'm dominant
That automatic platinum plated flow know I'mma shine with it
All of y'all is down to conform but I realign with it
Performing at a full house
Feeling like Uncle Jesse
Bitches they stress me
Take them to the crib undress three
Children lie, men lie, women lie then we die
But I'm here to tell the truth and let you know I'm finna rise
To no surprise
Fake rappers meet your demise
The microphone and Adobe Audition my only supplies
Look within my eyes
Yes I'll bury the odds
Now I ask em
Is you feelin' me?

[Verse 2: Logic]
I got it back and now I'm on again
Hit you in your chest like breathing after a shot of Gin
I'm just a living organism that has arisen
With so many bars I can manufacture for various prisons
So let me show you what I'm bout and baby how I do it
Flowing for hours every day just so I can improve it
When I perform I envision a crowd and how to move it
See I am lyrically inclined
Alphabetically take apart and rebuild your mind
I'm on my grind
And guarantee ain't no style like mine
I bring the force of course with no remorse
I'm married to the game don't even talk about divorce
'Till death do us part
Reincarnate then restart
With Biggie's eyes, Big L's mind, and Pac's heart
Rip it apart, intravenously like poison dart,
Y'all bananas if you think I'm slipping in Mario's Kart
He was a, class clown
Lover all around
He was kind of goofy
Make you feel good any down
But one day he disappeared and never came back
At 17 got kicked up by his mother just like that
He moved in with his father
That he never grew up with
But we're not gon' get into that like cocaine we gon' cut it
He loved music, but never had the time
Cause he was working two jobs and they both was over time
His girlfriend always told him that he was destined to shine
He smiled, said "really ?" but really paid it no mind
And when he was of age the situation was shitty
So he packed up all his stuff and then he moved across the city
Went to the room from his homie's mom and dad
They saw the situation and they felt so bad
They let him live with'em, and he was doing good
Working at the street fixing cars under their hood
He got up with his mentor, that he knew for a while
He met him back when he was a yougin' only a child
A real good guy
That gave him some equipment
And then he sent him packing like a UPS shipment
He said "lay some tracks, and maybe we can get it"
So then he quit his job and he moved in with his sister
They leaved together as children so yes he really missed her
But then he got another job, still working on music
Trynna find a style and figure out how to use it
But one day he got it
Yes he's so excited
But then he stopped
Said I got a way to go on top, they gon' find me
Such a long journey like I'm walking I-90
Three thousand miles leaving the haters behind me
Along his path, he ran into a wise man
Said "please tell me how I let'em know I'm great"
Wise man then said "drop a mixtape
But not just a regular shit that everyone doin'
You gotta let'em know that you for real on what you're persuing"
Then he was gone, just as quick as he came
After this encounter he would never be the same
But a hundred miles he ran and, he started feelin' something
What's that ?
Maturity
Every single night, sacrifice rest to write
Dusk 'till dawn he be rapping'till the sun up
Call him super Mario he always get the one up
Finally dropping tracks, now the mixtape is completed
His apetite for perfection was seriously needed
Then it dropped
He would, sell it for twenty but his country in recession so
Take it for ten homie consider it a blessing
Yes he a rookie, but you know they respect him
The botox flow, so whenever he inject'em
Them haters tighten up their game but now it don't affect him
Cause if they step out of line yeah you know he finna check'em
He grew up on the bottom, but dreamt about the top
He finally found out that until he reach it he won't stop
He's headed to the summit, where everybody plummet
The game need change and Logic can break a hundred
The consul to the game so you know we run it
Nah, that last line was, over dramatic
But he coming for that ass and he gon' let'em have it
[Hook]
Aye girl
It's obvious you fine
I just want to know what's deep inside your mind
Maybe we could play girl
I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand
But I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin
If I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
I could give you my number you could give me what ever we'll have a hell of a time

[Verse 1: Logic]
What up baby girl won't you come here
I put it on my life I seen you some where
Where you stay at I'll come there ha
Ain't no stalking shit
I just want to talk and shit
Maybe grab a bite then after walk a bit
I just want to converse
Come on baby ain't no need to disperse
Shorty got that type of beauty that inspire this verse
So whats up
I'd be lyin if I said I didn't want a cup but it's deeper then that getting knee deep in the cat
I'm looking for that ride or die type of women it's what ever
I can be your king you can be my correta
Ain't no better
Get you wetter
Fuck em all
Think outside the box baby girl you know I ball
Yes you know I want it all
So make that shit a double
This is Young Sinatra and I'm rising from the rubble
People never say whats on there mind Im like fuck a muzzle
Cause I got the feeling your the missing piece to my puzzle

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Logic]
What ever she wants I let her pick it like a fence from the suburbs everything coach but her plane ticket yea heard
We real all the time that's my word
Catch me in the cut tryna book her like a nerd
She a red bone bobby soxer
I had to stop her ha
Shorty a dime so you know I'm tryna cop her
Pop a bottle at our table periodically
Now check the science of that last line do it logically
No stopin me
I bet she would've never guest I never
Graduated
Cause the way I put my words together she infatuated
Mama I don't want no drama and I'm serious
Pause like a comma for I end it like a period now
Girl, dont treat me like your ex man
I'm a beast on the track but if I am your next man
Ima treat you tender
Take it slow like one video render
I remember
When I seen you for the first time
It was special like when I wrote my first rhyme
So if all I do is grind and never sleep
Then how in the hell is me and the girl of my dreams supposed to meet

[Hook]
