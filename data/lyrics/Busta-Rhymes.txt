[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Heyyo Mr. Chance The Rapper, I greatly appreciate the way you roll out the red carpet, allowing me to articulate myself, and now I stand on my own two below me. Yeah!

[Hook: The Social Experiment & Maceo of The O'My’s]
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I’m a man understanding the plan and I'm on
To be greater than anything make you a fan in this song
How I stand out and wonderin’ what planet I’m gone
The one and only God of kings come from
A hundred grand on, a child I always ran from the wrong
Standing on his own two but wanna stand with the strong
Please get to turning on the fan cause it’s warm
While I build just a little 'bout the man I was born to be
This whole planet belongs to me
We all feel the same so it belongs to we
We talkin’ all night but this is my birth right
Please can you get to bringin’ the crown to me?
Yea I know you all for it
You’ll only be deemed worthy if you stand tall for it
When you and your men were sitting, yeah, I know you all saw it!
This great ship we got goin’ on
Don’t slip

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I was born on my own two feet watching Bruce Lee
‘Fore I grew teeth I had a pen and some loose leaf
Pots and pans when the roof leak
‘Fore I ever smoked mids ‘fore I ever blew trees
Used to drive a hoopdie that broke down on me usually
Nas was lookin’ at me, pockets was lookin’ through me
Never planned on college I dropped out as a student
My GPA started with a decimal like Dewy
That’s lower than low, that’s lower than most
But if you thought I wouldn’t make it, you slower than slow
I make the type of music that stoners should know
If I plant one of my thoughts marijuana would grow
And I be high enough to go where I wanted to go (Reefer)
Might be covered in glitter but all of it’s gold
A nigga got that loud and it's all for the low
And everybody sayin’ “aww, let’s go”

[Hook]

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
It ain’t so easy
It’s not too hard
It ain’t so easy
But it’s not so hard
To stand up
Stand up
But it’s just too easy
To sit back down
(Turkey)
[Verse 1: Ceza]
Sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir
Bak jak burada mikrofonuna tak
Kağıt kalem bir de ilham alınacak
Tam gaz choppers, havada düşman avına çıkalım
Akalım, haydi bu battle'ı kazanalım

[Intro]
We started in the Midwest
Now we 'bout to take it
All over the world, baby
This is the pinnacle
Yeah, Tech N9ne

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Follow me, all around the planet, I run the gamut on sickology
They could never manage, we do damage with no apology
Pick them out the panic, a little manic cause I gotta be
Frantic, I’ma jam it cause I'm an oddity
Gobble the track up like I'm grubbin' at Mama Nakas
I can pop at you proper cause I’m partners with Waka Flocka
Give me the top of hip-hop and watch him make 'em rock
With a show-stopper, chakras popping off the (Worldwide Choppers)
If you anybody, you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle, not an identical soul is it
Loaded cold as the polar get wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo it exploded the flow behold it cause when the motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the real
Better ya just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Give me the knock and I’ma chop, he came and he went tomorrow
But I’ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas
Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trip when I rip it up, I be the ish when I split em up
Sort of like I was liquored up and backing up in the gut
Everybody be knowing I be acting up when I bust
From Missouri to Canada, I be keeping the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man, the planet's unanimous
Can I cuss, fuck anybody Tech is calamitous
Leave them in the dust, ain't nobody tough when I'm standing up
Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinking he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killing everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go

[Hook]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

(K.C.)
[Verse 3: J.L.]
Check it, I'm ahead of 'em
Chop it up with the veterans
A legend developing
Ain't gotta tell him it's evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
You're delicate, but loving every second of this

(Denmark)
[Verse 4: U$o]
De vil alle tjekke når vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smækker det beatet jeg vækker det
I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle vild "Fucking Chopper"

(Alabama)
[Verse 5: Yelawolf]
What if I ran into you with a pogo stick
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness
With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches like I was playing Hamlet
Syllable burning, that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree, like I was peeling pecans
But instead, I'm peeling rappers' heads, making a sand-a-wich
Pick up a 22 and put a bullet inside of a
Motherfucka from inside a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make them feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But I hopped on the fucking beat
And I worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne
Twist up the pine and
Smoke a beat with Mr. Busta Rhymes
Well, sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
Wit' an alien probe

[Hook]

Twista (Chicago)
[Verse 6: Twista]
Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
And hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'mma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies cause of cannibalism
Breaking them off into particles, they get in a predicament
That be never reversible cause a nigga be too versatile
Makin' you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then your respect I better have
Because I'm an anomaly, then I'mma give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challenging my astronomy
Hopping, I don’t stop with the fire when the flames thrown
I'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwing it up in the air, takin' it there
We WWC, if you can't keep up, should've stayed home
My alien knowledge be making other astronomers'
Work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
So play me and I'mma be shining on them haters
I'm finna be using it as energy, watch how radiant I'mma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
Don't even try to stop us cause we choppers and we worldwide
And I'm

[Hook]

(New York)
[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
See, now they ask when I'mma stop it, my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it, and when I'ma drop it my dude
Inevitably, it's that I'mma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask “what in the world is you proving
When you were already the best” and “what the hell is he doing”
Well, I'ma be chopping and cutting and breaking and beating and shaking
And fucking everything up 'til there ain't no further mistaking
And busting everything up like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shutting everything up, especially the ones who be hating
They loving everything until I got 'em stuttering-stupid
You hear 'em now?
“D-d-d-d-don’t do-do-do-do it
P-P-P-Please
Wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest”
And now I'mma come and kill 'em, get them, hit them, and finish them
And bang 'em in the head and diminish them, and then I'll
Hit 'em again at a minimum, repeat it coming to killing 'em
Then he be gotta be drilling them
Thinking “they gotta be feeling him”
Spitting lithium, see the way a nigga be spilling them
And getting them stupid to the point where there's no forgiving him
Hoping you're listening and you're paying attention
And you're witnessing the way that I be christening in the mic
And getting in the zone, I be flattening and packing in
People from the front to the back and
They got me acting a fool, I'm Black and
Nigga now I’m home

[Hook]

(Kansas City)
[Verse 8: D-Loc]
My fire annihilate make fighters retire instantly
I’m choppin' ‘em, call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killing 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any, in a predicament
Any enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of a lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals
Check my resume, they said the Gillgod’s biblical

(California)
[Verse 9: Twisted Insane]
I hit 'em with venom when I get up in 'em
I bend em and send em and you can feel me
Digging up in your brain and bringing the pain
They often wanna kill me
Filling 'em with that fury
Get up and hurry, you can feel the Real me
Coming up with that shit, I'm having a fit, and you will never peel me
Off of you when I'm on top of you, I got the drop on you
And popping often hit ‘em up with a bullet to the (brain)
You can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathing, you’re fiending
And dreaming to find a demon, name insane, I’m a worldwide (Chopper)
[Intro: Chris Brown]
I don’t see how you can hate from outside of the club
You can’t even get in
Ha ha ha l'ego

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missing
Yeah, yeah
That shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in ten years, in two days
Ladies love me; I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh I’m getting paper
Look at me now, oh look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
Cause I’m killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said on my dick
I ain’t really mean to say on my dick
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I’m done

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo Breezy, let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When you're doing that thing over there, homie
Let's go
Cause I'm feeling like I’m running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
Cause you know I gotta win everyday, day
See they really really wanna pop me
Just know that you will never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Everytime I come a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing that nigga think that he be doing
Cause it doesn't matter cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing
I gotta do a lot of things that make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again, and again, and then again
And I be doing it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm banging in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next (let's go)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin' in
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y’all doing
I’m Lil Tunechi, I’m a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don’t eat sushi, I’m the shit, no, I’m pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dressed like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then I’m like olé
I don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That’s word to my flag, and my flag red
I’m out of my head, bitch I’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain’t hotter than mine, nope
Not on my time and I’m not even trying
Whats popping slime
Nothing five, and if they trippin’ fuck ‘em five
I ain’t got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas, as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight, bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice and my daddy’s dead
You faggots scared cause I’m too wild, been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
I’m so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now, bitch

[Hook]

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Okay, okay

Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout niggas!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my lord, lower the casket down
Sprinkle the ash, or get your ass kicked, pow!
Frown while I shit on your crown, skip town
Ground zero, shapiro the king cash cow
Do I make 'em say 'Wow!', strip, ow, bow
I sit with the pound, click, pow
Blow, click, click, pow, click, pow
Stop traffic dropping them classics, flip now
Bitches I’m making them skip with thou
Art, you don’t really want start when I growl
(rawr, rawr, rawr) let me come and mop up the knock offs
When I pop off and never stop, cause
When we do come through, you better lock doors (PAUSE)
The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lockjaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see we cop raw
And if you ain’t had enough
What in the fat fishes of a phenomenal Fahrvergnügen fuck is going on?
Back with the B.A Baracus callous, bang on another song I’mma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling and witness them
Nibble them like sunflower seed shells
Set these scales got my weight up heavy like three whales
And I shit on these males ‘til it's stinkin' fouler than a weed smell
Nigga your tree fell
See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming a email
Talking, I’m sick, I got them shook and I bang em at retail
Until they cripple, see I cook like I’m slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bread and whoop ‘em and drag 'em like females (gasp)
Oh see well, these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details
The case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt kind of an ancient slut
It's going down like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas and attacking like apes in the cut
I’m waiting for the taking while I break niggas neck like a bracelet, fuck
It’s kinda like me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted harassing and erase a nigga (what)
Keeping 'em open and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
And got ‘em happier than a child in a park chasing a duck
While I’m chasing a buck these funny niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up like boots when I’m pushing they face in the mud (ahh)
Missiles I fling while I spit live wire
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit that'll cause a quick
Worship and gatheraround, it's
Certain this shit'll splatter cliques painful and make ‘em scatter
Shameful the way I shatter, split shit apart, it doesn't matter (rip)
Your head up off your shoulders (with) bullets bigger than a boulder
And they break ‘em and they know us, classic
And the way it’s going you could easily get your ass kicked
See, me and Shady together we’re crazy
Like baking a vomit and rabies cake like a pastry bitch
(We that sick)
Like I'm from Haiti, I’m suggesting you pay me
Don’t make me wanna spazz (Alalala)
Like I’m a crazy Israeli, bastards
While I bite the beat up and I'm starting to heat up, yack
I’m chopping your foot off, now it’s mine
And I’m putting my feet up, black
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child
And I been blacking out so long niggas is asking if the hook had died
Naw, but the beat is fried!

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Apparently there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick
So irate with this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? Cause I'm lit, narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up in Clive Davis' driveway
With his personal memoir saying he's bi
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry "rape" then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade, yippee-Ki-Yay
Cause here I - wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign? Maybe to take 'em back into time (Shady)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave em the finger
To take the attention away from my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking
An inkling of replacing the kingpin
Of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen and
Who raps nasally, eyes hazily, rhymes crazily
But sounds like he may need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Hey Mrs. Abraham Lincoln
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down faggot
See me on a ballot? I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat, bitch, so I'm just a candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am eight
So let's get smashed and wake up the next day with the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed, champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president, ho
Don't make me go take it back to the days of old
Where Sway & Tech radio when I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the wake up show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets dawg, fucking internet bloggers
"I sit in front of my computer all day and comment on
Everything, I'm an expert on everything, everything sucks, play the next song"
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong
Son of God I'm the S.O.G. like a wet log, pores never get clogged
I'm so full of self-esteem that I sweat fog
Yes, yes y’all, steady on the left, y’all
Step off 'forr you get stepped on, soft?
Bout as commercial as my fucking Lear jet
Jealously’ll get you as green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dawg
Alert, alert, girl, alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt, so
Jump around, jump, jump, get that ass shaking
Jump around, jump, came to hit you with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms and freaking hands flailing
And jump like Van Halen, and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya?
That on a grand scale I don’t give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing

[Outro]
Chill, man, chill
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Big man, when mi talk, hear weh yuh fi do?
Shut your mouth, listen close, weh we come fi do?

Bass a lick yuh, make it clap, go on go take it off

Uh, uh
Niggas is mad I get more butt than ash trays
Fuck a fair one, I get mine the fast way
Ski mask way, nigga ransom notes
Far from handsome, but damn a nigga tote
(What you tote)
More guns than roses, foes is shaking in their boots
Invisible bully like The Gooch
Disappear, vamoose, you're wack to me
Take them rhymes back to the factory
I see the gimmicks, the wack lyrics, the shit is
Depressing, pathetic, please forget it
You're mad cause my style you're admiring
Don't be mad, UPS is hiring
You shoulda been a cop, fuck hip-hop
With that freestyle you're bound to get shot
Not from Houston but I rap-a-lot
Pack the gat a lot
The flav's bout to drop uh

[Hook]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's a brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
Word up, no rap no crap you bore me
Wanna grab my dick, too lazy, hold it for me
I'm straight rap great
Busting heads, straighten dreads
I'm everlasting, like the toe on Pro Keds
A Tec-9 when I rhyme
Plus I climb, word is bond
Your album couldn't fuck with one line
It's been three years since you last hear
But now I reappear your heart pumps fear
To your gut, did your girl's butt
I scraped it, shaped it, now she won't strut
I smash teeth, fuck your beef, no relief
I step on stage, girls scream like I'm Keith
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rampage]
Twenty-one ninety-four
Mad motherfucking hardcore
It's my time to burn now explore
The flava in ya ear it's the boy scout
I make outs, I make other rappers have doubts
You're fucking with the wrong clan
And the wrong man, that's it
Now you got to get your dome split
I'm going into my knapsack with my gat
Take off my hat, yes I'm just cool like dat
The dangerous, the ruggedness, from the Flatbush abyss
BLS 97 KISS bounce to this
I'm gonna live long in this rap game, niggas know my name
Yo Puffy

[Puff Daddy]
Burn 'em in the flames

[Interlude]
You're jingling baby (go 'head daddy)
You're jingling baby (go 'head daddy)

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Hee-shee, uh blowticious
Skeevee, delicious
Gimme couscous, love me good
Um damn, Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
I guess like the jeans - uh
Flavor like Praline, sick daddy nah'mean
Papa love it, when he does it
Niggas buzz it
But tell me was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear
It's all for you, it's really all for you
(Now what)
Hunchback, close your eyes try to munch that
Coil up your ankles let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor it reacts to your gold caps
Word to Mama, I tongue kiss a piranha
Electrocute a barracuda, I'm here to bring the drama

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Flavors in your ass crease ha
Busta Rhymes about to bring the noise don't cease ha
Let me loose from the belly of the beast ha
Everybody, hey hey hey
You better believe it's Busta Rhymes the great
We 'bout to rip the Tri-State
Yo yo, hey hey hey
I'll split your face and give you stitches
Throw niggas in ditches, slap the ass of fat bitches
Wait one sec, as I get down
I'm rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now, don't you get suspicious
I grant your wishes every time
Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme
I know one thing the whole world least expected is how we all connected
To break fool on the same record
Five new flavors on a beat, feel the fucking heat
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When I get down I disappear, reappear and blow up
Everywhere, fucking with these flavas in ya ear

[Hook]
[Intro: Kay Slay]
G-Force (what's up Slay?)
I need you to make a hit for me (talk to me)
Four suspects (who?)
Busta Rhymes, Layzie Bone (who else?)
Twista, Jaz-O (I got ya)
There they go, take the shot!
Take the shot! DAMN!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
When I come and I hop and I skip and I rhyme
And I dumb and I drop and I spit and I shine
Ay-ay-ay nigga what you really wanna do?
You ain't knowin that I'm comin to take what's mine
Every time I come to hit'cha
With a little bit of killa
Better know that you can never
Never see me little nigga
While I'm at the TOP
I will never STOP
When a nigga POP
See the way I run it, and leave a nigga bitter
Y'all know when I do my thing and I bang
Bidi-boom with a bomb and a BING!
Everybody know that when it comes to the shit I gotta spit
Motherfucker better crown me KING!
With a passion and a lot of action
See the way ya grab 'em, HOW YOU DO IT!
Then they wanna ask him
How a nigga smash 'em
See the way ya have 'em, DRAG 'EM TO IT!
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-HEY!
Now you gotta know what a nigga do all day
Count bread make a nigga wanna bounce heads when I drop heat in these streets, okay?
You shitty with a get'cha gimmick
And I hope a lot of niggas live near a clinic
It don't really matter who you wanna ask about me
Cause I be the fiercest with it
While I'm givin you the final chapter
With a lot of laughter
See the way I capture
Everybody probably tellin you the same shit you don't really wanna come after!
Now I suggest you listen whenever you hear that the beat up in the buildin
Trust me, this is not the place for you to bring yo' children

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
The B-O-N-E we got plenty of flows;
From Cleveland, Ohio we rollin on vogues
They told me this record was only for pros
So Layzie gon' get in M.V.P. I suppose
Foes slammin them Cadillac do's
My story they caught has never been told
Sit back while I'm tellin this thuggish we blaze
Forever I'm young and'll never get old
Poppin a bottle of Rosé when I rolls
Smell the aroma, just follow your nose
We thug on the corner from night 'til the sun up
You run up get done up, I'll let it explode
Blow only where gangstas roll, so
Homie we smash around and we crash collide
Whoever don't wanna be foes, oh
O.G. status, still got money up under the mattress
Nigga come get it I'll stick like cactus,
Money so tall those niggas need ladders
Try to come close but they never could match us
So catch us, we the masters
Y'all already know how we do it on the Clair
Never compare we livin' on stretchers
Willin to bet ya, when I twist and bust
Nigga come through with Twist and Bust
Nigga been famous they know to aim it
They spittin my languange, "Adrenaline Rush"
Feminine niggas that been on a rush
Back to the dust we winnin the clutch
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Verse 3: Twista]
Now I be the coldest on the island, country or on the peninsula
Hit them with the venom and then I'mma
Disintegrate 'em or fade 'em, fuck 'em cause I hate 'em,
I'm hot if you not check the temperature
Mayday one Kay Slay, drop the bomb on 'em when they put me on the track and I'mma
Show 'em who was out when I make 'em go and commit suicide dressed like a Phantom or
Do and I'm about to get dinner
I'm about to open the do'
Cause I'm dope with the flow
Never know how flow was the 'dro
I'mma eat a bitch up and I hope for some mo'
So long is the poem, I'm never a ho
You can go check the portfolio
Kay Slay 'em just after fuck at you and then I'mma stick 'em, you know we can go
I'm cold so go get your coat
This be the season for niggas that's sneezin and snoozin
And if you keep testin me you gon' be catchin a beatin and bruisin - what's up?
Look at the mojo and look at the swag, and look at all the vernacular
Things I be doin cause I'mma stay infamous so they be callin me Dracula
Oops I mean Blackula when I'm attackin ya
Pullin up on 'em up in the new Acura
Or new pre-Camaro or new super Lego with the Pinot Grigio seats
I see when you niggas be hatin, so the next time when you see me don't speak
Now you know not to send me no beat
Cause I'mma kill it
And murder anybody That'll wanna get it
Where they wanna get up in it cause I be the realest
I'm a menace all the way up to the finish
Make an enemy diminish
When I get up in the battle even if it gotta be on the block
2010 hip-hop, the shit don't stop

[Layzie Bone]
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Verse 4: Jaz-O]
What can it be?
Rappers and thuggin on beats
None of 'em keepin it street
Look at them calves, all of them wanna be bulls
None of 'em ready for beef
What about me?
Been through the pain
Sorted the lames, keep it the same
Skillful syllables kill
My rhymin technique is impeccable still
Anybody ever wanna run up
Will get done up in a hurry
Got a flurry
I'mma hunt 'em for the come up
With a bang you better run from the one until you permanently feel it
I will live it, idiots gettin it
"The Originator," gotta keep it greater
Keep the fader for the haters
Nigga real for real
The all-time thriller, ready rockin the death of it definite
On it cookin and cheffin it (ooh!)
Takin over the world
Made of with your girl
Motherfucker recognize the nigga Hugh Heff'in it
Doin what you never did at double time, triple shot president
Ain't nobody better in the residence
Cream of the crop, seein' it stop
Over the top, bringin the soul makin it pop
Got a old school banger make you do the wop
Got a Louisville slugger make you diddy-bop
Ever incredible gotta keep it way ahead of you
Screamin at my niggas in the clink doin federal
No trip, no travesty
I call the lick now I'm up like anti-gravity
Spit words from the brain like charity
If hip-hop was a broad she'd marry me
Gotta keep it gutter, gotta get the bread, gotta get the butter
Make it hot, you can toast word to mother

[Layzie Bone]
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!
Save (shift+enter)Cancel
[Busta Rhymes]
UHHHH!! You don't know what we doin right here!

[Intro/Hook One: repeat 2X]
One two three we gon' turn it out
And make you rock to the beat and then scream and shout
We gonna hit you with the shit we got here
We gonna blow your miiiinnnd (blow your miiiinnnd)
Keep it movin like this, keep it movin like that
If I die, I'mma only come back
Yo, I'm saying if you think that you can step to me wrong
Don't even waste your tiiiimmme (waste your tiiiimmme)

[Hook 2]
You niggas talk shit then abandon ship
Niggas talk shit then they abandon ship
Niggas talk shit, then they abandon ship
Niggas talk shit then they abandon ship

[Verse One: Rampage the Last Boy Scout, Busta Rhymes]
I 8Off like the Assassin, now I'm blastin I'm takin over
Stick you for your blue Range Rover
I told ya, Rampage a real live soldier
Been in the game, sinc the age of thirteen
A microphone fiend, so I'm goin to see my P.O
It's August the 1st, so I guess I'm a Leo
My P.O., look like Vanessa Del Rio
She pulled my rap sheet, just like, Neo Geo

Hahahaaa! I always roam through the forest
Just like a brontosaurus, born in the month of May
So my sign is Taurus, kick you in your face
Like my fuckin name was Chuck Norris, make you sing my chorus
Rock to the beat and then, turn into a walrus
You remain nameless, my victory remains flawless
Acting like you wild, but I know you really harmless
While your time is coming, I make the fat shit regardless

Many niggas wanna know when the Ramp return
Yo I'm gettin phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern
He wants to know about my Flip Mode click
The way we get down and BUST NIGGAZ SHIT
LP after LP, we make G's
I run up in your ganks den take you for your keys
I'm not lying or joking, you get broken
Dead in Flatbush, back to Roanoake and...

People always askin me, how your shit be sellin
For makin shit guaranteed to bust your fuckin melon
Police throwed me up on charges like I was a felon
There was no tellin, when I was strikin had you swellin
Cruisin in my Lands, watch the police how they be gellin
Lock you up for days and got a nigga ass smellin
Yo FUCK THAT! You best believe there ain't no time for dwellin
If you ain't makin noise you need to kill the fuckin yellin

Chorus One
Chorus Two

[Verse 2: Rampage, Busta]
Yo, yo, yo I run up in your set like a New York city...
I can't slip, I beat you down with my vice grip
You're lost, that means you way off course
No remorse, I'm gettin five in The Source

I be saddleback biting motherfuckers like a horse
Turn and toss, niggas all up in my applesauce
Watch me reinforce, my shit feel good like intercourse
Ever since I was a shorty rockin Hugo Boss

Aiyyo Bust a Bust (why) you just made my day
If you didn't put me on I'd be locked like O.J
Now I'm writin rhymes hittin shorties everyday
In the full runnin drinkin ice Tanqueray
I don't eat pork I take a fish fillet
Now I'm knockin out niggas from .. to .. touche!
Now I'm goin back around the way
I'm rippin shit, like my name was Marvin Gaye

Yo, now I'm back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers
Got you niggas open like a bunch of wide receivers
Time is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners
Chickenhead, give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins
Squeeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin
When you talk shit you really don't know what you startin
Now your shit is done like a fuckin empty milk carton

It's on for the nine-six, mad shows at the Ritz
Now we got you open like Vicks
Stickin to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits
Fisherman hat with my brand new kicks
On the low, I still rock my Girbauds
See the show, I got my nickel plated fo'-fo'
All my rough niggas open the do'
Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'

Yo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper
Fuck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker
Everytime I hit I always hit a little harder
Blazing to the point where niggas look a little darker
Catching suntans from my music, fans understand
Making fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand
Organized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan
While your ride is busted, I be your luxury Sedan
Number one nigga in the chain of command
Breakin fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan
Aiyyyyyo, I see intruders on my scan
Singin at your funeral like Bobby Bluebland

Chorus One
[Intro: Busta Rhymes (Raekwon)]
Aiyo, Shallah, what up? (Yeah, you know how we do it)
(Turn me up, kid, let's get it popping)
Crazy, let's go get 'em killa (Yo Dre, good looking on this coke, man)
(This shit is official)

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Aiyo, it's back to business, making them diskettes, pushing sixes
Rocking wild animals on jackets are sickening
Hear me? From here to Rockaway to Cali, we flipped this
Broad day, Chef'll saute, his lyrics is crispy
Now I got Dre up in the kitchen, Rae stuck in position
Bout to flame broil his coke and get busy
What? Politics, pop collars and drive violent whips
Stay fly, hungry and wise, you know the code, honor it
Sit back, yelling it's nothing, unless his buttons get pressed
We don't stress nothing, we only get dressed
Stretched out, moving professional, frying more fish
I heard it in slurs, them niggas is blessed
While we ball to the maximum, give me the floor, for real
I show off and let my money get stretched
Take it to a new level, new bezzle, few rebels
Few wolves with medals on, you know we get test

[Hook: Raekwon (Busta Rhymes)]
Me, nigga, me, that's who, Cash Rule
(Hah, better slow it down, niggas'll smash you, homey, uh)
Me, nigga, me, pass through, rascals
(Hah, half gorilla, half ape in them track suits, black, come on)
Me, nigga, me, capsules, birds, whips
Ounces and fifths (no licking the glass, duke, yeah)
Yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yeah (yeah)
I'm here, so it's there, yea-yea-yea-yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Here comes the, a lethal presentation taking you places you never been
Deadlier than the combination of coke and heroin
I see the weakness in most of you niggas that be hollering
So I toned it down, so these words be piercing your lower obdomen
What I meant to say abdomen, keep on listening and following
While I'm ditecting a German, hateful niggas, chicks be swallowing
And if you look funny to me, and there's a problem then
I put you under an ultraviolet light or a halogen
As if I was busy deciphering counterfeit dollars and
Hoes in like some kind of Biblical figure, King Solomon
Hah, just for the record, what we do is essential
While I captivate the masses and keep the moments eventful
Doc Dre, Bust, Shallah Rae, see the vision?
Most you niggas still in disbelief, just came into fruition now
Pop the cork up off this bottle and you pour it
So euphoric, document this moment, shit is so historic

[Hook]

[Raekwon]
King of kings spit blood, all on my apron
Wash a nigga's face with the MAC, smoke them like Steak Umm's
Yeah my dynasty's brolic for real, we hunt, eat, catch the rat
Blow his waist, float in the stream
You know we all-pro with it, anti auto-tune
Boom, my flow fire, sit by the stove, hit it
Real niggas, official as listeners, gangstas and visitors
Step in the shit, we all prisoners
Might take the hammer from you, know I'm the animal
Rock a spur fur hat, no niggas in sandals, boo
Everyday get money and dress rugged, these are the times
Keep a nine on you, blow off in public
And I will surely feed my niggas the streets
Cop the hottest things to get, and haters they can eat and then preach
And while it go down, worldwide, this the team, this the theme
Me, Dre, Rhymes, my money makers is mean, what?

[Hook]
Intro/Chorus:

Who's on the microphone? A BUNCHA NIGGAS! (repeat 3X)
I got my crew so other niggas better leave us alone

Chorus

[Third Eye]
The Group Home's down yo, flippin with West and me
Charge a gap quick kid, best believe it G
Oh, I like to flip the script and have a track record
Wreckin it swift, I'm tellin ya to heck with tell to get with the
Crazy hairy thinkin drinkin cripple drunken monkey
Style back alley freaky ass to gas technique
So peak, it's about to get deep, we just kick
Your Third Eye right open don't let your eyeball sleep
The next step is the check, let's tell theses niggas whassup
Cause we get freaky G, no you can't get with me
Save yourself the trouble step back black, and don't even bother
Word to Shop and Swift they get called in like I'm your father

Chorus

[Guru]
Aiyyo, it's time for me to flow and get down with this
I'm pullin out my mic, spittin off some rounds to this
I gotta known rep, so son you better slide out
Cause when I'm flippin, I'll be rippin your pride out
So called gangsters play roles like in the movies
Oughta save that, they're way bad, you could never do me
I'm real as they come, I'll beat ya numb with my vocal tones
Words hit like aluminum bats to your dome
No charges against me cause I'm jumpin the law man
A-men, punks should cancel their plans
As the invincible principle Gang, is gettin bigger
Sayin peace to the Heavster rollin with a buncha niggas

Chorus

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I bring drama like ya, spit on my momma
Cannibalistic, like that nigga Jeffrey Dahmer
I'ma head peeler, girl stealer
Coffin sealer, ex-drug dealer, HUHHHHHH!
When I hit you with the blow of death I leave nothing left
I cook you up so quick they call me Biggie Smalls the Chef
My burner's in my left, I'm not the type to fight
I'm blowing up quick like a stick of dynamite
So call nine-one-one, Biggie's got a gun
The gat to your back, I'm smoking everyone
Quick to pack, quick to squeeze on the trigger
Who's in the house? HUHHHHHH! A buncha niggas!

Chorus

[Rob-O]
Like yo, beg your pardon, whoa
When I put one to the head nuff funk shit startin
Fine, so I headline for the public
Get mine for my rap subjects
Packed with potential, wisdom versatile elements
To quench your sense, I get down so feel the mental
Rhyme pro I'm Rob-O, the super spectacular
Brown skinned junior from Africa
Blowin up so it's, possible to freak
See the highlight, in fly writing, don't give a [fuck]
I split when it's through then it's get with the Guinness brew
And give a shoutout to my Uptown crew and still I'm wreckin

Chorus

[Heavy D]
Yo, here I go, here I go, here comes the man again gain
Ruff with a pad and pen, so run go tell your friends
It's the big belly babalu boogaloo big, boy
And I got plenty honies there's no need for no sex toy
Free me, slavery, let me go oh no no no
No longer will you treat my beautiful sisters like they're filthy hoes
Never ran from static men to crew get dramatic
And I get crazy respect from crazy crews with automatics
Now push could come to shove because they love the way I flip a skip
And that's what keeps me kinda popular with all the honeydaps
So look at me now, and tell me who is bigger?
When I'm on the block I'm with my flock and I'm rollin with a buncha niggas

Chorus

[Busta Rhymes]
Well HELLO HI! HELLO HELLO! How ya doin?!
HI! Hello hi HEY, how ya doin?! Voltronic!
Busta Rhymes comin with the mad ultrasonic
Esophagus to rock it, wreckin niggas need to stop it
You get your style busted that's just what they get for comin
You want some?! Yes I know you want some of the TALENT!
But you can juice up, and em-otionally get wicked
To stick it, in your inner groove watch a nigga kick it
Ohh hah! Yo Bee, Busta Rhymes
Be my niggan, never muggin, only lovin and huggin
My niggas, as we get bigger we come diesel
As masculine figures, L.O.N.S. we gettin thicker with a buncha niggas!
YESS!

Chorus 2X
[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo Kayslay, Papoose (huh)
I finna cook some shit in the kitchen with ya'll niggas
Let's go

[Busta Rhymes]
Busa Bus and Papoose will come and really hurt this
I fuck you niggas up, see none of you niggas serve a purpose
I hook on niggas like Kareem and jail em like Julius servants
See these niggas powerless on how we reemarges
So deserving of the title, crown it, whatever you call it
And though you niggas was havin fun, see we come to spoil it
Treatin niggas like the shit they are, flush em down the toilet
Bitch see you can't afford it, see I'm advising you to forfeit
Gotta come up off it, homie what you doin ain't that importent
See we don't need what you got plus the street don't want it
Yo Pap come get these niggas and slap them across the face
With some more venomous rap, spike the strappers up on our waist
When we in the place, I know you know he we do this nigga
If you think you new muthafucka, I'm the newest nigga
With the newest money, with the newest album, the newest label
The newest cars, cribs, roll chains, used to call them cable
New commercial landscapes, get me a new stable of bitches
Their thoroughbreds, I'm meticulous and very anal
About how I'm gonna strike and attack you cus I'm able
And give it to you niggas back and white like I'm interracial
And continue to keep it lyrical just to make them hate you
Sometimes make me so cynical until I come and stick you
Stick a pitch fork in em, watch while I come to take them up
To another level, if you sleep, we came to wake em up

[Chrous: Busta Rhymes]
See you might get a blister when we give you the heat
Better address me as mister, see me in the streets
Mr. Papoose, Mr. Busa Bus, this is grown man shit
Repect niggas like they born with it
The hood they always talk with it (you hear them talkin about us?)
But we the top rank, flawless in our weight class
You niggas don't really want problems, see every time we come with it
Shit is obvious, you muthafuckas straight ass

[Papoose]
Papoose, you can call me Mr. Clientele
My mixtapes make more sales the Nextel
I ain't hard to find, they know where I dwell, hell
Never been a chubby niggas, I'm skinny like twelve 12s
You had that cocaine for so long it smells stale
I make hell sales, my caine GOAT like LL
Rip the smif n wessun with quick aggression
And get the reppin, rip the nigga's neck in
Bang his head in and cave his chest in less than sixty seconds
Spit the weapon through his intestines
Hit the exit, can't get arrested, it's pig infested
Got sick obsessions, for walking in nigga's sessions
I make illest efforts to disrespect em with different gestures
My wisdom threatens these wicked peasants with ill intentions
He said he was laying in the cut, but shit's infected
I got disprefected, I am the sheppard, so spin the record
I'm representin for this profession I ressurrected
I'm giving belssings within the lessons of his intentions
This is the essence of my lyrics brethren, Busta Rhymes is a living legend
I don't know what you acting like you're heartless for
When you know that you're a target like the department store
Cus Justo gave me the crown, and ya'll knew it
My song's ruthless, your bars truthless, it's all foolish
Fill you with embaldment fluid, this is ex con music
I'm like the Van ???, I'll show you how a con do it

[Hook]

[Raekwon]
Blood on the Chef's hatchet, I'm here for the action
Kill a hundred niggas with aspirins and piss in they caskets
4-5s rip through your glasses, all mine, Mr. Gymnastics
Gimme more time, or visit the blasters
Cus I'm starving, hungry for classy, I'm dead up your lassy
See it's nothing, press a few buttons, the city's diasaster
Ayo anthrax em and axe em with sianide acid
Choke em out, escape in the cold and left through Lake Placid
Stop fronting, know you a pastor, you know I'm a master
I'm like six sixes in traffic, you niggas is taxes, hardbodies come
Through jurassics
It's all about mausberg lugers, loadin them rachets, blow them like napkins
Cus I'm elevated at the top of my flowest power
The m-o stay young, fly, and rish like ?raw child?
With transaction, grandmaction, niggas on the stove maxin
Throw a thousand birds off the road, while my soldiers catch it
Playin all the lobbies, the Gotti's the red Mazaratis
My colleagues will blow something, show you Karate
We know the code, pot, X and parties, the live section
Keep him on his toes, take off them chromes and pass them to mami
Cus the feds around us, watchin us, ?Gottis? is everybody's laundry
We could prbably get more if we hunting, probably
We hang niggas, bang pistols, take a piece of your finger
Same whistle, you better respect it cus my name sizzle

[Hook]
[Baby Sham]
Aiyyo, balls your pencils
As hollow tips get in you
Bots cutting to slice your face you
Rhymes is natural
Hold two lives and four wives
Up in the crack capsule
Flipmode cruddy styles has been past you
Rush pass
You couldn't touch cash
If it was under your nose
Like a mustache
Nigga
What ass
Show your whole cheek
Slugs with no heat
Diamonds that don't break
You thugs is so sweet

[Rampage]
I float so much I get seasick
Flipmode is the Squad who I beez with
Who I get plucks with
And push German V's with
Rampage I'm psychic I can see shit
To the next millenium
You not gon be shit
Scratch your name off the list
Cut your wrist
You know the issue
I'm official
When you die none of your niggas is really gon miss you

Chorus:
FLIPMODE SQUAD
Here to drop bombs
AGAINST ALL ODDS
Still remain gods
GRIP YOUR ARM
We always come hard
THE WORLD IS OURS
Call a National Guard

[Rah Digga]
Here we go
Any bitch that rhyme wanna flex she ass
I'm stomping all things like I'm plexi-glass
Niggas make way like when they hear sirens
Treat you like park and too close to fire hydrants
All up in the board
Kicking back long islands
Get your wig split first solid defiance
Rah Earth and sun in this Imperial alliance
You do the science

[Spliff Star]
I'm getting money shitting, turn intruders into vixens
Fall off beeper uh-uh niggas stay getting
Dirty nigga for life
That's how Spliff's living
Throwing niggas in caskets
Tired of a yellow ribbons
I buck my duck if you touch my one
Rather Jamaican than belly boy make you people for fun
Fat Man's Son, street educated
The colonel of ghetto jurors, still thug related

Chorus

[Lord Have Mercy]
We enemies of three strike felony laws
Gorilla dicking K-Y jelly for whores
Lapdances trap grands without laws
My baby moms, three eighty for your arms
That bust with loud force
The ghetto with us
That bang Makaveli in trucks
That whatever the fuck to give a cheddar in chunks
Who gazey chase
Fake thugs with lazy aid
Track marks
Rap stars
And a rain of aids

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, what you want from us
Now visualize more of us
Stay toting under my given flavor from Nauticas
Destroy every arch rival or any challenger
Make you remember this day
Nigga mark it on your calendar
I'm showing you something
You ain't saying nothing
My niggas make noise
Like a bunch of volcanoes erupting
None of y'all niggas really wanna war
The type of nigga to crash my plane in your building
In the name of Allah

Chorus
[Hook: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
Whenever me and Khaled do the remix everybody's hands go up
And they stay there
And they stay yea
And they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you going in put your hands in the air make em stay there

[Verse 1: DJ Khaled]
Sittin' on the top floor, what you think I'm hot for
Every summer drop more, hits to make my stock go, up
Them hands go, up; them fans go, up
I'm number one in this bitch and I'ma, stay there
We the best of the best, grind while you haters just sleep
I'm yellin' "free Weezy", I rep the heart of the streets
Who hotter than me, I'm wearin' the crown
We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti
Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti
Mario Andretti, money comin' fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
I could never be a racist, wake up every morning just to count white faces
Neo in the Matrix, glorious as Morpheus
Employed all warriors, I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'
Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'
And I come and say there ain't [motherfuck ?] nobody better, better, better, better!
Uh-huh, Okay
Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter
Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut
So sick when I come and hit 'em in the gut
You will crown me king (no matter what!)
(Kill 'em!)
Ok, let's shine my friend
Get up on my grind again
Some niggas will be happy that I chose to rhyme with them cause

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Diddy]
Her heart racing like she snort cocaine
I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name
Got the most paper Mr. New York Times
I'm a natural born winner nigga New York mines
Everybody getting money but I cop the first six
Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch
Yea, I'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch
If it's less then nine digits nigga, that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, all I do is win, ain't that the reason that you really mad
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad
I ain't mad ma, see you on your bummy swag
I'm in that money green Jag, lot of money bags
I told Khaled you the best but I'm the bestest
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
You could talk slick, all the way down to the welfare
Ask the IRS bitch, I'm paying for your health care

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
I'ma make this here official, Let me clear some issues
First off I am not for Britney Spears initials
Thats no B-S, at your re-quest
Lean back you and your crew, Fat Joe, T-S
Yea it's Young Funeral, all black on me
So act like summers over and fall back homey
Winnin' is all I do, I'll answer all of you
But y'all ain't sayin' shit, like prank callers do

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Jadakiss]
It's already proven, I got them birds movin'
All I do is win, I'm allergic to losin'
Yellow gold cuban, nine mil Ruger
I'll show you what to do with em
Finish em, I'm through with em
They gon have to jump me, it's gon take a few of em
They don't want no problems, they might end up suing em
Disassociate yourself, have nothing to do with em
We already got a jet, we tryna get two of em

[Verse 8: Fat Joe]
Just blew trial, crack lobsters Little Italy
Your wife she a screamer yellin' slow down Joe, you killin' me
Beat her like a prize fight mommy I’m a rude boy
You just hit the Power Ball, everyday a new toy
Nigga it’s a stick up, a motherfuckin' robbery
I done did some things that have Haitian Jack proud of me
Ridin' through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me
Puffy surfin' on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin' me

[Hook]
Turn it up (ha ha ha)
Flimode (ha ha ha)

[Verse 2: Remi Martin]
I catch you backstage, give me the keys to the Escalade
You think you cute ho, take off them Gucci shades

Yo yap that fool cause I don't know money
For my peeps that hate slow money, I put em in the industry
So they can come and take all your money

Fuck hip-hop, rip pockets, snatch jewels

Run up yo' stash house, tie granny up
Make you strip butt-naked, young buck got struck with the gun butt

Don't hide when you see me, I'm on the guestlist

[Verse 4: Lil' Fame]
(Ante up) show no mercy
B.K., nigga, thirsty thirsty

Motherfucker you lame and your chain hollow

Yap your chain, smash the lens in your specs
Listen it's, Lil' Fame right

[Verse 5: Billy Danze]
Hey yo I'm firing out a coppertop city With a whole empire
A clip full of blue-tips and a hand full of fire
Eat deep dirt nigga, it's Berk'

[Hook]
[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Ron Browz, yes!
Oh, we back in the most amazin' way
Well, lemme introduce you to the new talk
Let's get straight to it
C'mon!

[Hook: Ron Browz]
La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo
We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money

Hala sheiki, ha lini falla
Mili ha lan shi inni mala
We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Now, there ain't no way that you could kill the beast dead
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread
I got oil well money in the desert playing golf
Dolce shorts, dashiki with a Louie Scarf
Chest cold, diamonds make a nigga wanna cough
In Dubai, 20 million on the villa loft
And then I step up in the club and then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Seven star hotels, Maybach, movie sick
Big bitches, knock-kneed camel-toed groupie shit
Women walk around while security on camelback
Club on fire now, niggas don't know how to act
Sittin' in casinos while I'm gamblin' with Arafat
Money long, watch me purchase pieces of the Almanac
Y'all already know, I got the streets buzzin'
While I make you bow down and make Salaat like a Muslim

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
See, now I take trips to Baghdad dummy
While I use stacked chips and count Arab money now
I don't need to get fresh, about to grow a beard duke
So much cake even the money look weird too
Domestic bread, and I'm broad, I'm tryna eat right
Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Al Saud
They respect the value of my worth in Maui, Malaysia
Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia!

[Hook]
[Intro - Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo, somebody tell Steven Spielberg and George Lucas thank you for directing this movie!

[Ron Browz]
Hashi Miki Hallah! Means "It's The Remix!"

[Hook - Busta Rhymes]
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine

[Ron Browz]
Oh! We getting Arrab money! We getting Arab money!

[Verse 1 - Busta Rhymes]
Look, you can talk about your money but I really don't care
I'm into copping strange shit, now I'm trying to buy air! (gasps)
As the first black nigga that's a rap trillionaire
I control heat, I'm about to buy the ozone layer!
I'm into copping minerals now: diamonds and granite
So much paper I could probably gift wrap a planet
And clone a million Janets
Respect my accomplishments
As Salam Alaykoum Wa Rahmatoullah Wa Barakatouh !!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - Diddy]
Hamdoullilah with my billions pilin'
I'm just wyling, bought 2 islands
Lakshmi Mittal-in', diamonds is salmon
Bout to buy 5th Ave, bitch I'm just stylin'
Money insane; while Jay was popping bottles
I was buying out planes just to fly around Spain
Fuck a recession, I'm still invested
Bout to buy Dubai and swim in the shark section
Fuck it, the dark section
Bitch, that's the Barack section

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Ron Browz]
You might catch me in a coup that cost 100 thous
"Haka la Sheika" means "I love you, Ron Browz!"
My money make noise, yours quiet as a mouse
Send an e-mail: Ether Boy's in the house
All the girls love me, yeah I pop bubbly
"Haka hashahi" means "shorty, dumb, ugly"
Find me on the dance floor doing the duggy
Trucks sit high, dude, next to your buggy

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Swizz Beatz]
Don't call me Swizz no more
Call me Kasim Daoud Shams ul-Din
When I come through, hit you with that brand new
Bugatti Coupe; damn thing only-only seats 2
But you know who (who?) Goon who be riding in my passenger
Side, we be flying shit, 2.5 in it
Hey, h-hey-hey-HEY - I'm in my Jeezy watching TV
She call me "Ha-habibi" while she feeding me linguine
Left right, l-left right - that Arab dance popping right
Swizz Beatz, Busta Bus, the money-money buss pipes

[Hook]

[Verse 5 - T-Pain]
I let my chain hang down with the rest of them
Teddy Pain rain down on the rest of them
Mr. Stripper Man that be hollering "get em man!" I'm at em, man
Rubberband; dropping money bombs like a Taliban
Oh la la, we getting Arab money
You want this hook, you gonna pay that money
Save that money, give it to my kids
I'll take that honey, give her all my kids like -

[Hook]

[Verse 6 - Akon]
I got that Arab money
4-star Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim
Straight cash when I come in
Lemme exchange the currency cause it's all foreign
I got that A-RAB MONEY!
Waking up to 5 concubines in the morning
Diamond mines still runnin'
On all of Africa, you can ask Tarzan

[Hook]

[Verse 7 - Lil' Wayne]
Calendar say I get money everyday
Smile look like iced-out Perrier
Bury me a G and tell her kids that I was
Now jump into your grave if you dig what I dug
Cash Money Universal multi-check
20 chains look like a scarf on my neck
Young Money Entertainment: girls and fame

[Hook 2x]
[Skit]

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, it all began like, bust it
My nigga City bout to bounce on a trip
We met some niggas with alot of things they want em to flip
I told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip
Travel safe, you know that I'mma hold it down on the strip
Good lookin, word to mother son I give you my wit
But when I get back, I'mma bounce straight to your crib
On the strength, son slid until you to the Greyhound
Wit a burner in the knapsack, headed straight outta town
Now, three days pass I'm still on the strip
Doin hand to hand with twelve collapsible, stashable clips
With little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like a project
When police come we stick the clips in any metal object
Throwin a nigga on the walls and try to search me down
I laugh knowin that my stash'll never be found
Well anyway, on the third day, son came straight to the strip
Wit a new floss and shiny shoes on the whip
My nigga hit me with the latest, greatest
He told me get inside the whip so I can know just what the up to date is
He said he fuckin wit some Guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is
What kind of dough they get, and how they handle they biz
How they connect with Jamaician niggas who speak American
And how they chains swung a medallion iced out pelicans
And how they stay wit four pounders
And speak American to try to blend in
Like they ain't obvious out of towners
Okay, I've never heard of workers gettin five G's pay
For trips that last for only 2-3 day
How these Guyanese niggas be eatin pasta but they love zucchini
Rockin valor tennis suits by Sergio Tecchini
Them type of cats that call you because you can't call 'em
Rockin baseball fitters with wild animal skins on 'em
How they rock silks and tailor made pants
And get a matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance
Washrags hangin from every one of our back pockets
]From every fine wine to champagne them niggas'll straight cop it
And set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential
Rock laced whips while the workers'll floss the latest rentals
How they fuck with arrogant bitches who act pussy
And love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy
After all of that I wanted ones
The way my nigga was talkin so next trip I went to bounce with son
So now we out of town with Guyanese cats
Up in they gates bubbling packages and layin wit gats
Shit was slow until the main fiend was offed
Just like a thief in the night
And spread the word that we was back with the white

[Intermission]
"Ayo why don't you tell that crackhead to close the fuckin door
And shut the fuck up"
"Yeah man and clean the motherfucking spot up, smell like..."
"Break the fuckin breakdown in the working city... yo go get the plates
And the gym star"
"Yo light that up, lemme hit that, gimme a light, yeah man cut that"
"Fuck this shit"

[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, see how we blowin pa
The lookout niggas holdin fort like they was watchtowers
Buggin on how we went through, a half a brick every couple of hours
So on and so on, shit is good and we eatin
First nigga to short a package will catch the most brutal beatin
The whole town, see we now own it
Carryin on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments
We stackin cheddar now and shit is all clear
And we was growin as workin niggas wit aspiring ideas
We love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit
But in the grand scheme these niggas'll love to have they own shit
Now these niggas was really ready to swell up
We decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop
Off in to the wilderness of the wicked Husid
We set up shops and watched the games begin
So now we ballin like a motherfucker, money was sick
Gas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin the dick
Fuckin everything from the local McDonald's bitches with the biggest ass
To attorney bitches that'll beat a charge fast
We used to takin niggas' custies and leave they set up on tilt
And watch 'em angrily scheme on the shit that we built
Ain't it funny how shit transpire in fact
Not too long after our ride we took the winner's stash, house was at
Some niggas tried to run a jook with things in they palm
Not a problem so immediately reach for the john
Right away the gun BUST! straight lifted a nigga
How we moved his organs with kickback, shifted a nigga
Wild shots fire, everybody scatter like rats
Leavin nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats
Now we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands
But fuck it, determined to fulfill the best of these plans
Shit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall
My son said he shot, but he wasn't bleeding at all
Word, I started buggin when my nigga said he feel cold
Then I looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole
So as we continue to radically blaze the fifth
Flame the iron, not giving a fuck, y'all niggas wanna rip?
Well we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook
One nigga slid and think he got off the hook
Now let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied
Was one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party
He was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes
Stupid motherfucker tried to front, we had to leak his brain
Suddenly my nigga fell to the floor
And said his legs feel like them shits ain't got no feelins no more
More the actin up the more the shit I felt in my gut
The shit was all over as soon as the director said CUT!

That's a wrap, good actin motherfuckers, good actin
That's the shit I'm talkin about
Y'all ready to watch the playback?
Fuck around, that shit'll be a box office smash motherfuckers
[Applause]
THE END

And we gon stay big time 'til it's time to see Big (B.I.G. forever!)
Get a grip, Bad Boy never slip
We, runnin strips while y'all runnin lips
Haters wanna stop my lute
They don't want me wearing Sean John, they want me wearing lawn suits
P.D. increase the heat in ya streets
Keep ya tapes on rewind, CD's on repeat
My mental, more older, jewellery, more colder
Got a lot like its '97 all over
You know what I came to do; change the rules
Even when I stand still I'm makin moves
I, paid my dues as soon as I stepped in
P. Diddy a.k.a. News at Eleven

[Hook 2x]
Throw your hands up in the air now
We're gonna hit you with the heat
For the streets
Throw your hands up in the air now
We won't stop
It's Bad Boy For Life

[Lil' Fame] (Billy Danze)
M.O.P.!
Catch me walking on the wildness side of your block
Yo, I bang mine, niggas showing me hood love throwing up gang signs
(Yo, is that who I think it is?)
You see it, Brooklyn Military remains in blazin
Respect our hood because the clove is a ghetto
But niggas start switchin like hoes in stilettos
(It's Lil' Fame and them!)
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
We still bangin 'em!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

[Billy Danze] (Lil' Fame)
Sound the alarm
It's the First Family and we're back to drop bombs, boom! (Napalm)
Nuke those justice, it's the worlds, famous, fast Caress' street
Vow, to keep the homies proud in the street
To make our music loud and stomp over beats
Like (ba ba bom bom ba bom bom!) There you go!
Yeah, we ain't goin nowhere

[Hook 2x]

[Busta Rhymes]
Niggas put a hundred grand up
Stand up, before I stick your bitch-ass you better put your hands up
Hate if you want and front like you ain't wit it, nigga
I bust your motherfucking head with a skillet, nigga
More rugged nigga, heat for the track
I'm like a Pick-up Truck with broken concrete in the back
Now let me add a couple G's to the stack
I know we got you dumb and how we put this together
And run when you didn't even see it coming
Back the fire armor and pop your car
Nigga watch me shatter your windshield with a rock guitar
We be them zero tolerance niggas
I'll turn on your ass, bitch
And melt you niggas like a fire, burnin yo' ass bitch
Relax bitch, the fact is we trifil with heat
With cycles with lyrics right from the street
I'm sayin "AS WE COME THROUGH, PUT THE SHIT DOWN"
Soldiers get up, faggot niggas need to sit down, what?

[Hook 2x]
[Busta Rhymes]
Yo - me and my niggas and my clique be gettin mad cream
Ball in the club, now I'm drunk havin a bad dream
This muh'fucker tried to greet me with wealth
I never knew that I would see that day that I would meet the devil himself
This nigga was eagerly waitin to prove it
Astonishingly, already dancin to his own burial music
Well anyway, he plottin' to do it to me
In a certain kind of way, and started off directly poppin shit to me
While he spoke a couple of fires would spark
While he sat in the shadow talkin his shit we watched the sky gettin dark - he said

[Devil]
Well isn't you (?) where it hurts, I'll leave you in a rock sample
Straight up leakin in the back of a church
Then I ghost ya crib and haunt you like a ghost in your home
Leavin you old and decrepit like them ruins in Rome
Watch your body shrivel up and turn your ashes to smoke
Fuck your flesh don't get yo blood sucked, the blood of ya foes
I be that nigga that'll torture your spouse
And leave a thousand body bags like truth.com in front of your house

[Busta]
Got me buggin on a whole' nother level
Tell me how the FUCK a nigga really end up havin beef with the devil
Shit bugged the whole effect the nigga had on my dreamin
Body reactin mentally, goin to war with the demon
Semi-chaotic like a typical storm
So embellished in the dream a nigga felt it in the physical form
The dream got my nose runny and shit
Eyes watery, shorty watchin my body twitch funny and shit
Givin shorty sleepin with me the creeps
She buggin off how a nigga just sweatin and breathin so hard in his sleep
Determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin
Absolutely focused on killin the demon within
So now we fight in the name of my brethren
And every blow connect durin the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven
Inhale a deep breath of fresh air
The devil's presence blows a cold draft leavin a scent of death in the air
While my mind was reassemblin now
Simultaneous wifey watchin a nigga body tremblin now
Couldn't conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead
Stabbed a nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head
Yo it's funny how the devils'll test us
But it's only select, niggas blessed with somethin so miraculous and precious
Til I'm dead I'm always battlin through
You disbelieve then cut my main vein that all my blood be travelin through
Somebody got to die, settle the score
Because it's me or this nigga, I'm fighting to the death
I'm ready for WAR!!!!!!

(*devil laughing fades*)
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Y'all niggas know who be the waviest
Fuck y'all niggas up again just like
The Giants did the Patriots
Everybody know I be the craziest
But it down sicker than a crazy bitch
Y'all niggas don't want no problems, boy
You don't really really want to play with this
Bussa Bus, M.I.A
When I'm in the building, niggas get to M.I.A
I get their women playing with some other women
Then they get to looking at a nigga as if "Am I Gay?"
"Yes you is, shorty"; then I stay
Partying with little mami bend okay
You want to enjoy a little when I play
Fuck it up and cause a little anarchy
Shhh, hold up, mami wait a minute
I know you love it when I call
Black boy, I'm in the place
Look here, know you love it when I ball
Know I'm winning here around this bitch
Got my hand up on the turn-on switch
Life is good every day and I'm rich
YMCMB, Conglomerate

[Hook: M.I.A.]
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio
Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands high
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang
Ahhhh

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
It's getting hot in this bitch
Shorty, please hold my jacket
Funny how baby girl well
Bad girl come, hold my ratchet
Give me that back, can't play with it
I'mma finish everything and put them all in a casket
Finished with the club, take shorty back to the crib
When I'm done with her, she'll be calling me "bastard"
Now let me give you the magic
Y'all niggas must like getting your ass kicked
You think you're playing with fire?
Nah nigga, y'all playing with acid
Face it, see the spaceship just landed
Got a nigga wilding like Animal Planet
You don't want a violation -- it's a hazard
Y'all still struggling to meet the standard
See, this shit is a habit
Attract bad bitches like I'm really a magnet
Wack niggas, instead of swallowing a pill
Y'all niggas really need to swallow a tablet
Until they really come get me
Shut shit down, never go against me
Y'all already know a nigga gotta move with a bad girl
Shorty ride shotgun with me

[Hook]
[Intro: sample from Scarface]
You got to be kiddin', five hundred?
Who you think we are, baggage handlers?
The goin' rate on a boat, is a thousand a night, man
You know that (first you got to work your way up to 500, cedigo)
Ok, what I did for you guys in Freedomtown, what was that?

[Raekwon]
Return of the kitchen kid, with the axe
All I know is real detail, coke, lasagna and them E pills
Million dollar merchandise, we on, get ya groove back
A hundred yukons, we all moving crack
All my soldiers got big rank, pa, Sicily money
Y'all had a bitch that got pregnant in Iraq
What's the movement? Superman money in the Ooh building
A few dudes who make a lotta rules sayin' 'you get it'
Right, wavy hair, all my niggas is polic'
You stay off the roof, or jakes see the crib
No snitchin', this Amityville detention
Might fuck around, get caught, or shot down, play position
Yeah, here they come, sizin' them up, you know my status
This is raw way, lookin' in his eyes, and he butt
Yo, what's happenin'? I heard you got the streets back, captain
Yup, all niggas is dead, unless they team clappin' something
He felt the generals plans, recognize, we going all out
I might throw three in his man
Had the slick look, looking all Cubaned up
Don't get it twisted, nigga we'll swiss swish you up, what?

[Hook: Raekwon (Busta Rhymes)]
From all day to morn', noon, night
Recognize we gotta re-up (Yo, it's Cuban Link 2, motherfucker)
You all listen, pay attention
Word to the team, we gonna key up (Yo, it's Cuban Link 2, motherfucker)
Get ya birds off, playground
Yo, stay out my business, you gon' see us (Yo, it's Cuban Link 2, motherfucker)
For all them real Cash Rule Everything Around Me
Niggas get y'all stee up (Yo, it's Cuban Link 2, motherfucker)

[Raekwon]
The kid that endorse Maxmaris, shorty show support
Take your sweatpants off, fix your mascara
Four hundred nineteen ounces, out in Long Island
Twelve strong bitches that's real, who not scared of housing
Yes, throw on them raccoon, chinchilla feathers
Let it drag on my boots, the jean burned leather
Jog through the back of the building, drop the L
Got the scope on your nosey ass mother, fuckin' up sales
Forty karat locked in, bowtie, chillin' at the Democrat party
Yo, Chef, your coat, got it poppin'
Coming soon, Purple Tape, circle up the city let 'em know I'm back
Four hundred bricks, and yup, the kids stance
Sponsored by my cousin in Stan', maintainin'
Got the call from Tony Young Montana, my son campaignin'
Yup, I'm not no fuckin' bellboy, I war anything out there
The ring is mine, you can tell Roy
That's when I was hit with the call, your whole motto is get tour
Drug rap owner, you will rip all
Live like the pope, and get a big hall
Flipped them a claren, the front, like the Jag back like the store

[Hook]

[Outro: Raekwon (Scarface sample)]
Yea, we back in the motherfuckin' staircase, nigga
You know that kid is coming, Cuban Linx, nigga
Louis Rich, the signature, bitch
(Every dog has his day, huh, Mel?
You wanna job Ernie? Ok, then, you call me tomorrow)
[Hook: Stevie Wonder]
Been through the storm, through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillacs with sunroofs mayne
So many ways to make a dollar
Huh, sometimes I think about my father
You see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young
Tryin to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin down my do'
Wonderin where my next blessing is comin from

[Busta Rhymes]
My momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice
Hard living gave him hard hands and callous
As a young'n, peep how much they loved each other's space
His hard hands rubbin against the pretty skin of my mother's face
Dig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie
So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
On the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs
Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed
Got older, developed ways of grippin the steel
Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin
Blendin in with city folk, down in Flatbush Brooklyn
Feel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it
Homey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin I been through it
In other words I

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Got a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights, plottin to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious
To visit other cities, out of town kick was serious
Guayanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on
Wreck is all for the good, gettin into shit
Like we innocent, actin older than we should
Walk around broke in the hood, watchin all the rich niggas
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas
Thinkin 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin
To hell with just gettin by and economizin
It's kinda hard bein humble in the belly of struggle
Doin things that probably get you in trouble
That's why we stay up on the block, gettin money while we keepin it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin the faith
Mom and pop be worryin for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin look and see just what I become
A scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin
Across the line until somebody tryin to cap me - ohhhh shit {*gunfire*}

[Outro: Stevie Wonder - singer slower with more ad libs]
I been through the storm
Through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
Woooooooooooooo-whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yeahhhhhhhhhhh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
