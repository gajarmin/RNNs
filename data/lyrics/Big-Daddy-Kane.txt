[Intro]
Aw Yea, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics
Cause it's '88
Time to set it straight, know what I'm saying?
And ain't no half stepping
Word, I'm ready:

[Verse 1]
Rappers stepping to me, they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory
They can't get with me
So pick a BC date cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And, stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basing
Friday the 13th, I'mma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes Big not little
So define it
Here's your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk
As the Kane start to talk, cause

[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane

[Verse 2]
My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of emceeing, for those who want to be in
My field in court
Then again on second thought
To have emcees coming out sounding so similar
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it's the
Climax, and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ahh shit!
I stop and stand strong over emcees
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know there

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be want to be competition
Trying to step to me--must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'mma get you at
You think I'm losing?
Psst, picture that

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make emcees evaporate
The party people say 'Damn, that rapper's great'
The creator conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MC's that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'mma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slooow doown
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
Your title, namely me, cause I'm homicidal
That means murder, cause I'm about to hurt a-
Nother MC, that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him
And take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign
As Salaam Alaikum!
[Verse 1: Scoob]
This here for the motherfuckin record
Here we here we here we go, here we here we go
Can I can I can I kick a motherfuckin flow
Chitty chitty bang bang, I chitty bang bang
Motherfuckin niggas can't hang
Well oh no, look at the cloud, it's gonna rain
But I don't give a fuck I'm letting niggas know they can't hang
Don't give me no lip, don't give me no backtalk, yeah break North
Don't make me get my gun and blow your motherfuckin head off
Once again, niggas know my style, God damn it
Unless it's on the cut so give me the mic and watch me slam it
Hard like Shaquille, oh you better kneel
When you see me comin, Big Scoob got em runnin
Sex when I flex I catch wreck on the world tour
With dough in my pockets big like the Biscuits, in CB4
Set up a contest, I'm coming, I'm taking the dough
They wouldn't pick you even if you had a afro
So don't try me, you better walk by me
I'll do you like the first part in Menace II Society
Like Cypress Hill, yo, I'm insane
I'll shoot a hole in your toe
I'll make you jump like the House of Pain
Bang biggy bang biggy bang bang
Niggas can't hang, niggas can't hang
Bang biggy bang biggy bang bang, motherfuckin niggas can't hang

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
We gonna do it like this
Anytime you're ready, check it:
I got seven Mack-11's, about eight 38's
Nine 9's, ten MAC-10's, the shit never ends
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
That's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lambsbread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns,I make number runs
I give mc's the runs, drippin'
When I throw my clip in the AK,I slay from far away
Everybody hit the d-e-c-k
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Mateo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my god, I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin', smackin' babies at their Christenin'

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Yeah, where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw up your motherfuckin middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this
I thank the lord for my many blessings, though I'm stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothing separating us from a MAC-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
A straight soldier, buckin at the bustas
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me striking down the block, hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I wanna
And ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug life, motherfucker crime pays
Let the cops put their lights on: chase me nigga!
Zig zaggin' through the freeway: race me nigga!
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw

[Verse 4: Shyheim]
Yo, this goes out to everybody from Staten Island
{*ah Mister Cee, and you don't stop*}
Yo, times is getting hard, word is bond, I swear to God
I even got caught trying to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, a rebel without a pause
I never had a good Christmas, so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks all you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parking lot
In front of my building I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigger then tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day

[Kane] This how we gonna do it, hold up Cee, aiyyo, let's try this
[Shy] Staten Island in the motherfuckin house!
Wassup, Wu-Tang Clan in here or what?

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Now what's the bullshit niggas been saying
Dont try to act like Martin now with that "I was just playin!"
No need to grieve now on, now that the beef is on
Uhh!! Oh yeah motherfucker, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap don't meant that you're catching wreck with me
Step to this I'll give your mic a vasectomy
I only know one nigga that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle, cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle, I gots to have it, 'lest you're gonna rob me
Like they did, Whittaker when he fought Chavez
Cause when it comes to going against Kane rappin
That's like a pimp trying to pull a nun, ain't nothing happenin
Non-resistible, non compatible
I'm not saying I'm the best, I'm just saying I'm fuckin incredible
And let's just get one more thing understood
If I fart on a record, trust me nigga, that shit gon' sound good
[Masta Ace]
Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off then, I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can lift your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital "A" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like Crusoe
Sleep if ya wanna, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm
Next up (Yo, I believe that's me)
Craig G, light up the mic for the Symphony

[Craig G]
This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, cuz now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on the tip when you heard me and the Juice Crew
You said, "Mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo Craig, I heard you in that jam, and it's pumpin'!
I apologize. Oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?"
That's how I'm livin': on surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
Cuz if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, cuz on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up...(Yo, I believe that's me)
Kool G Rap, light up the mic for the Symphony

[Kool G. Rap]
Yo, Marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When G Rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
That make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and wanna sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's death
Makin' veterans run for medicine
Cuz I put out more lights in a fight than Con Edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
So if you want rage, I'mma make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, todays the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though. Solo. Cuz you're still all...soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than Brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me
Bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me -- I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Serve the sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, G Rap wrecks, he's rated X, that means the boy is sex. Next
The amplifier gets used and abused. Pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang a
Rapper or singer: I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up... (I believe that's me)
Big Daddy Kane, get on the mic for the Symphony

[Big Daddy Kane]
Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord;
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear -- then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
Cause rockin' a party? Yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution. I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kicked it
Cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, cause Daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to your health
So put a quarter in your ass, cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade. You need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that Allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun; on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
Cause when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, emcees, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge. Don't barge, cause goddamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant. You're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin'. So put Kane in, that category. Period. End of story
[Here it comes...]

[Documentary sample:
Since the far-off days when man first heard a scratchy noise
On a cylindrical drum accompanied by staccato human tones
It has been his aim to add breadth and depth, to give realism
And spaciousness, and, even where it applies, to convey actual movement]

Intro:
I start to go, my rhymes'll flow
So, get up and dance cause Kane said so
If you were lounging around it's time to get up
Pardon my expression, but I'mma tear shit up
I appear right here, and scare and dare, a mere musketeer
That would dare to compare, I do declare
Getting busy is where it's at
But what you're saying, you wouldn't get a point for that
Cause you're a featherweight, and your rhymes you carry light
But I drop bass just like Barry White
So how could you think that you pose a threat?
You say you're rocking, how many shows you get?
All your vocals go local on the M-I-C
Mines go a great distance, like AT&T
I'm not new to this, I'm true to this, nothing you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So, yo, go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme, word for word, verse for verse
Get you a nurse, too late, get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct, I get respect, I'm out to collect
Cash money, cause I get raw

[Break]
Everybody get up! (x4)
Kane: boy do I hate a...
I'm coming! (x5)

Here I am, R-A-W
A terrorist, here to bring trouble to
Phony MC's, I move on and seize
I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
Cause I'm at my apex and others are below
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo
Second to none, making MC's run
So don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it, so I don't see why you all
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi
To stage a rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party until the A.M
I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a
Little rhyme with authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues
I'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw
Cause I get raw

[Break]
Everybody get up! (x5)

With speech like a reverend, rappers start severing
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been
Beaten, or eaten and just tooken out
You know, come to think about it, I keep MC's looking out
And real nervous when I'm at your service
Give me that title, boy, you don't deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme, you that it has to
Be perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know
I damage ya I'm not an amateur but a pro-
-fessional unquestionable without doubt superb
So full of action, my name should be a verb
My voice will float on every note
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote!
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get them in a battle and make them all history
Ruling and schooling MC's that I'm dueling
Watch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling
On my throne, with a bronze microphone
Hmm, God bless the child that can hold his own
Cause I get raw

[Break]
Ain't it good to you? (x3)
Documentary: here's an experiment to begin with...

Twenty-four sev chilling, killing like a villain
The meaning of raw is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever, take a loss, never
And the rhymes I bust, coming off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff
Only crushing MC's that be trying to riff
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic
Make MC's panic, they all get frantic
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rock but hey, what you expected?
I'll get raw for you just like a warrior
Rapping like a samurai and I'll be damned if I
Ever let a Fisher-Price MC hang
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but yin-yang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And I'mma preach your funeral
Tell me who in the world could ever come with more
I get raw
Chorus:
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, they go:
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't eeeeeee-zyyyyyy) 6x

[Greg Nice]
One-two-three-four, to five-six-seven
Eight, nine-ten, then ya got eleven
Twelve, thirteen, start your age;
Fourteen-fifteen-sixteen, the pubic stage
Like an apple, like a cherry, like a peach, like a plum
Let me get off the virgin before I cuuuuum!
Pick up my pants and thump and thump
I think I'll call up Tootie, she'll give me some
Watch out, watch out I'm drippin' live scum
I say damn, I love the way I make my posse roll-a
'Specially when the hoochie's on birth control-a
Lift her up just like a pick up truck
Then I sat her down and we started to fuck
Made whoopie, made whoopie, made whoopie, YO-O-O-O-O!
I hope this time I don't make a cookie
Brothers everywhere be callin' me a rookie
Two from the Greg Nice from the o-o-old schoooooool
But bullshit, I ain't no fool, cuz

[Hook]

[Big Daddy Kane]
Well, I say...Extra! Extra!
Here is a bachelor comin' straight at ya
I see trim and bag it, take it home and rag it
The Big Daddy law is anti-faggot
That means no homosexuality;
What's in my pants'll make you see reality
And if you wanna see a smooth black Casanova -- BEND OVER!
Cuz I don't half-step when it comes to broads
The K-A-N-E 'll go the whole nine yards
There's no time for coversation my dear
[MOAN!] is all I wanna hear
So let's make a move, as I get smooth
Cuz the purpose I serve is to soothe
I'm tall, dark and handsome and all that junk
Even white girls be sayin' "Ooh, Kane's a hunk!"
Even Puerto Rican girls be callin' me papi
Some try to copy, but they look sloppy
So imitators that wanna step to a
Brother like me, lick my manure!

[Hook]

[Smooth B]
I'm just goin' and I'm flowin' like a gigolo
And when I used to be with Scott, I was a Super-Ho
But now I'm coolin' with Kane and Greg N-I-C-E
And if you girlies want my tip they gotta pay a fee
I love bonin', and all my friends they will agree
That when it comes to pimpin' hoes...it ain't easy
First name: Smooth. Last name: B
When I'm bonin' a girl, I make her feel heavenly
I like to make 'em wait, and then make 'em beg
And when I take off my clothes, the I form a third leg
They rub it with oils and suck it with ice
Now I'm sweating....my mind is in paradise...

[Hook]

[Scoob Lover]
Tip-tip-toein', Scoob Lover's out hoein'
Braggin' to the fellas how my flattop was growin'
Buyin' drinks for the ladies, money I was blowin'
Right in front of me...mmm...not even knowin'
A brown-skinned cutie; big, plump booty
Nametag earrings readin' off "Tootie"
Bullseye, bing, the girl of my dreams;
From my eyesight that was what it seemed
I said, uh, "Come a little bit closer"
To Scoob that night, choice guy, she said "Hi
Hi...hi, I've really been wantin' to meet you
I just got paid and I'll be very glad to treat you
How 'bout dinner, a Salisbury steak?"
I said, "Sorry Honey-Dip, but I already ate"
So I nudged the other girlies off my shoulder
Went for Tootie cuz the girl was much older
East to the Benz, I slowly walked;
Clearing out my throat so I cold start my smooth talk
Sex in my mind, I was sure of it...
I wanted to tax that ass like the government!

[Hook]
[Ant Live]
Well, it's Friday night, ain't a damn thing funny --
Bitch better have my money
[Intro: Big L]
Yo yo what the fuck man, Big L takin' over the streets
Flamboyant Entertainment

[Hook 1 x2: DJ Premier]
"What y'all bout to witness"
"Big L, Big L, Big L"
"My-my-my-my, my whole crew wild"
"The game is called rap"
"Other MC's ain't got a chance at all"
"My-whole, my, my whole crew wild"

[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo, I'm straight loco, to hell with you and your broke ho
You ain't a big dog, you more like Toto, you got no dough
I smoke 'dro mixed with cocoa, strong as bolo
I pack a fo'-fo', platinum ro-ro
Anti-homo, that's a no-no so fuck po-po
I push the seven-fo'-oh and not the Volvo
C-Town push the six-oh-oh, I'm with a bitch on dolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While y'all buck for legs I, buck for heads
I even buck celebs, nigga fuck the feds
My underground niggas, y'all can shine with me
Got my own label now, so y'all can sign with me
Y'all can take me from the bottom and climb with me
That's fine with me, that's how it was designed to be

[Hook 2 x2: Big L]
Gats we bust, backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust, crazy stacks we clutch
And we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
Cause half of you niggas that's rappin' now is wack to us

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
And cats still wonder can they get as hot as he been
That probably depends, let me show you how to begin
Bang chicks in Marriotts down to Quality Inns
Hit the bar spend cash like Monopoly ends
Plushed out, rock gators and exotical skins
Come in the hood, flippin the chicken and broccoli Timbs
Niggas come in the game, block they shot at the rim
That ain't in you - the fuck you gon' possibly win
I do it, "Booty Calls" on the BlackSTREET Teddy tip
Keep a steady grip, make cream just like Ready Whip
Heavy with, styles that's the deadliest
Cats on that petty shit watch how much lead he get
You tryin to go places, chasin Oasis
About nothin gettin low wages
Drink Hennessy with no chasers
Right hook is like Joe Frasier's
I'm the bodacious, body parts are big and like Schwarzenegger's
Smokin' Garcia Vega tryin to get the larger paper
If you, block the cash, we lockin ass
I'mma put it in your chest like a Stockton pass
Only out to earn figures like we please
But I don't mind to burn niggas like CDs
Now - exhibit, styles I kick with it
[*COUGH*] Pardon me, but I'm fuckin sickwiddit

[Hook 2]
[Hook 3]
[Scratches: DJ Premier]
Bust a move, we show and prove

[Verse 1: Scoob]
Ha ha, hey hey, laugh now nigga
My man's right behind you, Kane pull the trigger
I don't play, I'm from the hill where shit is real
And I'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield
So bring your grip or you can think twice
Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
I'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon' rock it
Once the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket
I cut hair and you still can't get no part
You couldn't deal with Scoob if we was playing cards
But if I got beef then it's time for code red
My gun is like a ho, it be taking mad niggas to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join the army, you still couldn't battle
So where you from? England, you somebody great?
You burning Scoob, "I don't think so mate"
I got the style that get you open like a bag of smoke
I'll have your friends saying "Ah man, that shit is dope"
Leave me alone when I'm rocking on the microphone
And play like E.T. and phone your black ass home
Yo Sauce, if you're down with the groove
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Verse 2: Sauce]
Hey, here I come with a slick rap, tic tac toe
When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back
I flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder
How you got dope like Sauce, money you didn't do it
I write my own with bigger hope, drink of Scope
Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
NBA style, fantastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight
I write left-handed cause I like to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win lose or draw, I'm booking whores, anyway
As I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take Eddie
If I was Fred, I think I'd have to bone Betty
Sucking and lucking, hey, niggas I'm ducking, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass
One line and that's fear
Rappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear
So Shyheim, if you're down with the groove
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Verse 3: Shyheim]
I spark the mic like weed that's in a cipher
And I get girls open like a reggae song by Tiger
So check me out, as I flip this here track kid
And make mad noise like a Metallica record
I'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killing
When I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted
Cause I rock the world from U.S.A. to Asia to Russia
If your shit stinks I'mma flush ya, then bust ya
Like a crazy man from Cali son
My jams be packed like a Farrakhan rally, what?
You know my style, I put the F in effin foul
The Rugged Child lock shit down like Rikers Isle
And got more girls than a trailer load with Shabba
More Super than Cat, I'm the punani Don Dada
So Big Daddy, if you're down with the groove my man
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Verse 4: Big Daddy Kane]
Now tell me who is the man?
With the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And stepping to me, thinking I can be touched?
Not even Michael Jordan'll gamble that much, yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ahh yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That is I thrown ya, scold ya, Jones ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What I just shown ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
And see that I got, more essays than the Mexican
The Messiah that's feared great, leaving rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run
I see the way you're trying to get to me
But with that speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better G
You're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with
The non-resistable, non-competible
No No No I'm not saying I'm the best
I'm just saying I'm fucking incredible
And let's just make one more thing understood
That if I fart on a record, trust me nigga it'll sound good
So Jay-Z, if you're down with the groove, my mellow
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Verse 5: Jay-Z]
One checking it two, checking it three
Check out the J, check out the A, check out the Y, check out the Z
Aight G!
I'm breaking MC's up like EPMD
And these nuts if you rappers trying to see me
I'm buckwild with styles, ta-dow
I've been in it running a hundred miles I'm well endowed, baby gal
Uhh, the greatest nigga to touch it, you niggas can't fuck with
The, incredible skills of the G from Brooklyn, big up kid
And ain't no eating me up, you fast fuckin with jigga
I'm like Prince jeans, I bring the ass out a nigga
When I rock it it's in the pocket, baby mop it don't knock it
Till you try it, once you start, you can't stop it
I'm the cocky breed, I'm dope like poppy seed
I live one rent from besides that be
Between get off my dick and stop jockin me
When I bust a rhyme you're diggin the sound
I know you loving the way it's, goin down baby
So Ason huh, if you're down with the groove, why don't ya
Get on the mic and show and prove

[Verse 6: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Come on
Wu-Tang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a flick, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream "Ow!"
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like "Well god damn what's the recipe?"
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
She says "Go ask your goddamn father!"
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas think they all that, yo, that shit is G
Mad game and it's a motherfucking shame
How many enemies wanna claim the name
Of Ason, who carries on like a manager
Yo! Sounds fly, right?
Danger!!!
[Kool G. Rap]
The last time I caught a body it was recent
Gimme a HK, four banana clips, and I'll take on a precinct
Yeah, the murder rate is on the rise, with niggas like me
Steady poppin, niggas are droppin like flies
To get em up when I hit em I hit em hard, there'll be no get well card
Niggas straight to the motherfuckin graveyard
Cause me no wanna get undone
Me pickin the one and lickin em up and hit em up for fun
He thought them bullet hit me but him didn't get none
You better run son, because me beginnin to get the gun
Yo, murder me, you musta heard of me
And if you get rushed to emergency, I'm shootin niggas in surgery
Another nigga life is took
I'll be at your wake motherfucker signin my name on that book
Inside the morgue another body freezes
It's one more bitch nigga that was sent to meet Jesus
"Come on down!" "Whassup nigga?"
No ambulence, just paramedics scrapin your brains off the street
So yeah motherfucker come get a taste
Cause I'mma give your punk ass my two in face and beat the case
My finger's on the trigger, I'mma pull it
So now you know that Kool G Rap is number one with a bullet

[Big Daddy Kane]
A one man gang to bring the bang
So the next nigga can't even hang, yang yang yang yang
You know my style, and know my pedigree
You can ask Sadaam Hussein about me
I'm never to let a brother bass
And if you bring on a crew, I hope the bitches saw Scarface
Cause I'mma send em to the morgue
Six feet under, gettin their mail from the groundhog
Cause I'm the wrong brother to push
When put to the test, I go to war like George Bush
And I got apartments to give
The landlord of the morgue, now who need a place to live?
I'm rough and tough, the man on the scene
The baddest the maddest, you know the routine
I flip and rip, to set the rank
The coolest in rulin the gangsta lean
I got my gat to your dome and I'mma pull it
I'm number motherfuckin one with a bullet

[Kool G. Rap]
Niggas are wavin white flags, then dragged
In a hospital bed, full of lead, with a shit bag
You get a slug in your mug
Just give him a kiss and a hug, I pull the mother, "flatline"
I'm fuckin him up I'm buckin him up all properly
No poppin me is stoppin me even if he go look out for me
I'm quicker to flicker the nigga the trigger is the plan for me
You try to run me comin to kill the whole family
Cause in the city there's no pity or no sympathy
You gotta hem em up, and now you're just a memory
Yeah nigga, I leave em done when I hit em
When pussy comes to get em, tell em Kool G Rap did em
With my fingers on the trigger I'm Terminatin like umm..
(Who Schwarzenegger?) Yeah that nigga!
So fuck all the bullshit
You know a nigga's number one with a bullet
[Verse 1]
On the streets of Brooklyn, you see this kid looking
Tightning his MJ's, white and cement grey
You're sure to see a pair of Jordan 3's
Now you wanna talk legendary talk to me
Some break records, so no one forget 'em
But we don't break records, we the ones to set 'em
What's in a legend but cutting edges, perfection
With one obsession for staying on the top of his profession
And if it ain't broke, we don't fix it
And no remixes, no pre-fixes
And if it ain't hot we ain't repping it
You ain't getting no half stepping
Half court lames that could never play a full
Any little game just to see what they could call
A wolf in sheep clothing caught in lion, shit gets wool
You wanna be like Mike then save the bull
Many try to stick 'em, many try to pick 'em
And think slow, you made your D silent like Django
A broken ankle, and now your tanks low
One octane, but homie, not Kane for short
It's evident I'm the rawest specimen
Warlords and testaments to change your regimen
Spitting to the beat or either the record spin
You wanna see the magic? All I need is just a pen
Sheer excellence, to say thus far
You can ask Isaac Newton how you greet a star
You asked for 16, I went way too far
And I gave you 28, just to raise the bars
Times was simply plain I knew they'd eventually change
Let's take a trip down memory lane
With the game talker, native new yorker
Gators on my feet, formerly british walker
Yes love, that's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Parlay with your crew at the corner store
Carrying a boom box 'til your arms were sore
We be wildin' on the corner free stylin'
Or politickin' 'bout doe we see pilin'
Or either girls we be getting with, how we be hitting it
Lying bout skins that we didn't get
Slow moving at paces through the rat races
The jordache look and fat laces
Making moves any type of way
I remember it like yesterday, hey

Chorus
Here's to you
That's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Way back in the days how we used to do
Thank you for the good times y'all
Repeat

Verse 2
Déja vu, things ain't nothing new
Shorties make me think how we used to do
When you couldn't be sleeping, if you plan on keeping
Hold of your sheepskin, heads do be peeping
Think it can't happen to you, now could it?
Came to school wearing Puma's went home barefooted
And on the weekends when everybody click
To slide to the deuce to check karate flicks
Come back around the way after dark
So the crew could embark on the jam in the park
What would happen that night, was to scrap in a fight
Only way to break it up was playing Rappers Delight
And as I sit back watching you
Shorties out there doing what you got to do
I feel for you being sincere
Cause where you trying to go I already been there, yeah

Chorus

Verse 3
Ain't nothing but love I got to give
I don't playa hate cause we all got to live
That negative lifestyle I prohibit
Good life I got to live it, bubbly I got to sip it
Now I'll admit that I sort of be flashing
But yet and still I do it in an orderly fashion
Bring on the honeys and watch me mack these, stack cheese
Go on with your bad self, black caes
Just when the game got the stakes set high
Straight from bed stuy, the return of the jedi
With a jewel cause I'm tired of seeing
Charges being brought up, on brothers getting caught up
Now it's about time we connect, organize and collect
A new wold order's in effect
I send this out to the shorties in the hood
I wanna see you all live good
Funkdafied one time for your mind
This is how we gonna get it off baby
Now dig the flavor, ohhhhhhh yeah
I got the Mister Cee in the place to be
Of course, I be the Big Daddy Kane, here to entertain
I got Ax-el, ready to max well
Yessir, we gon' get busy one time for ya dig it right?
We gonna call this 3 Forties and a Bottle of Moet
Why? Cause I drunk 3 Forties and a Bottle of Moet
Plain and simple, but this is how it's gonna go for ya
Mister Cee, yo
It goes a-one, two, three..

Some people call me Kane some people call me Big Daddy
My momma's name is Ruth and my pops is Clay Bradley
I got a little brother, some of y'all may just know him
I would say his name, but we ain't speakin at the moment
I walk through the streets of New York everyday
I hang with rappers like Doug E. Fresh and Cool J
I hang with Tone Loc and Don Cheadle in L.A., plus
I Got a Man, you know the Positive K
I get blasted with the Ol' Dirty Bastard
So peace to the RZA, the GZA
And to the rest of the Wu-Tang niggas
My man Shyhiem with the gangsta lean, da cream
To rise to the top, and you don't stop
And Mister Cee, is in the place to be
And Mister Cee, is in the place to be
Oh Mister Cee is in the place to be
And missjones in the house most definitely
Ax-el, ready to max well
Ax-el, ready to max well
The B to the I to the like to the G
Rockin on to the break of D
As I keep it strong I won't steer you wrong
I'm tired of this, let's go on to the next song
[Big Daddy Kane]
You in the perils of the lyrical heroes
That rule just like the pharoahs
Robert Dinero's got it covered just like sombreros
Seek shelter, here comes the warpath
Anyone who's tryin' to reign, I change the whole forecast
If I slip, half a herd he learned
This murder he earned turned his body to third-degree burns
You're purely pathetic, I won't let it
And once I set it, the after-party's in the paramedics
Vultures, come back when you're older
Talkin' like you're grown, you cats is Small Soldiers
Enough of them as the god muscle in, it's puzzlin'
You couldn't carry weight if you was hustlin'
Style ain't even de-cent, them not gonna squeeze none
Please dun, give me one rea-son
What I, say in a verse will be slayin' you worse
As I wet 'em up just for the sake of obeying my thirst
Anytime anywhere, without any fair
I'll do it with any hair, what da deal, ain't he there, wha wha what
What I do will be crucially brutally
Usually legal and rippin' stupidly, ain't nothin' new to me
What I spit attract felons, crack melons
Leave the chickenheads back swellin'
Game tight wit the way I'm livin'
I bag birds and I stuff em like Thanksgiving
My bad self, get more love than tennis
From New York to Venice
Black as a Guinness here to represent to live with the menace
To win The Apprentice, if your heart shows stealth
You better watch yo' self before I stop yo' health
Cause any props here baby, you ain't gettin'
You better recognize, the true and livin'
You played yourself fast, put two quarters in your ass
What I meant, arcades done went up to fifty cent

[Chino XL]
That lyric tarantula, Chino about to make this example of
Wit one verse, shittin' on a whole label roster sampler
My first name: Chino, my last name: Went There
Leavin' rappers curled up and dyed like Immature's hair
Wit lyrical warfare, when I spray shit
My style like AIDS, half a y'all got it just none of y'all is sayin' shit
I hate and spit at devils that want to posses Chi
Jesus came in the vocal booth, like "Nigga, you the next me"
So test me, battle and you will become a dead man
And there's a lot of fake Chino's like Craig Mack's a fake Redman
But I'm above the surface of this rap circus
Writin' more incredible verses on accident than you can on purpose
You a worthless waste of flesh, like fat asses on a nun
I'm God's bastard son, that blasts and thinks bloodbaths are fun
I hate you with a passion, make white chicks faint like I'm Hanson
Historically known for bringin' down the house like I'm Samson
My damn tongue bursts, in the the first verse there's a bad curse that hurts
I'm leavin' wack church passengers inside of a fast hearse
Escapin the wrath of Jerse
It's a sad earth when my pen dirts
Axe murderer type of massacre occurs if we match words
I'm past blurs, I smack herbs
Gritty-green eyes like Badu
Leavin' minds fucked up like Maxwell's hair-do
And I'mma be the sickest till I'm dead
The type to rent Halloween 4 eight times just to laugh at LL's head
My new album is Flo-Jo's heart, watch it blow up
You ain't just wack, you're what wack wants to be when it grows up

[Kool G Rap]
The Godfather saga, hit you dead in the chest like shots of Vodka
Funer-als crowded like soccer while I'm watchin' opera
Last like Sinatra, blast like Binaca
Binoculars is how I'm watchin' droppin' from the chopper
Mafia imposter
You're left for dead with your face inside of your plate of pasta
?Freddy in a hasa?, salute to my crew to prosper
You know how we do, we icepick the boulder
You get dabbed over glasses of ice with the Bolla
Blood on your shoulder, make costra nostra
Keepin' the heater with the toasters
Dough in the sofa, cashmeres and gator loafers
We bullet-proof the Rovers, pimp-smack you sober
Our whole crew is skippin' to lieutenants and soldiers
Flip on you the way Montana did to Minola
Condition vulgar holdin' on blowers older than Yoda
Leave bad odors when we give cobras crystal like Yoga
Colder than the caps that's in the Polar, bubble like soda
Bend these old Lola Falanas over
Cross me, cut our your momma's ovaries
Kid you know the steez, have your wake smellin' like potpourri
On the low-key, ship keys to over-seas
My shit gets sold quicker than groceries
K-double-O-L-and-G, you know it's me
[Verse 1: Ghostface]
Yeah! Come on! I know many boney niggas that knock big niggas out
Force MC's to write more when my pen is out
Indian Gym's pedestal prince sit on thrones
Crack bones hardly pay back loans
Fuck a Maybach I hash back a three G stone
One bitch, four fifth, rubber grip, never hidden it's shown
This is for dirt balm niggas wingworm babies who smell like piss in school
Smoke wombs, rob and tote tools
Jail and poke fools, bash niggas in the head
With forties after thatm shake your hand and get more brew
Please be at ease God, fuck the disease God
You rap niggas front on me, I'm a squeeze God
Headline, man get sprayed by retard
Ghostly thing, he left behind the red clark
His gun bark up big trees
Made his best with a bomb and fluid, olivie oil and mint leaves
When y'all bag up your fuckin bottles is empty
We serve glaciers that's why the fiends is friendly

[Hook]
Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime
I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave!!!

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
Then, uh, what! Bread ridiculous, heads want a whiff of this
Glad for hypocrites layin back and triple this
Model heads hollow heads and the nickel fifth
When I juggle fuck a double nigga flip with chips
Sets I cripple this let a nigga nipple kiss
The scene'll hit or miss I'll show you where you ticklish
The more iceyed out need to bang your wifey out
She like the way my Rose Gold chain swing my thing bang
Know I got niggas in Sing Sing like Ving Rhames
I'm not a nigga that maintain the same dames
I'm steady switchin up, Chevy truck glistened up
I'm not them other suckers motherfuckers listen up
This nigga riffin what, who the fuck is kissin up
You own the cake you'll get ducktaped listen up
The goon trace when they say Buck lift 'em up
New York plates on the interstate shiftin up, what

[Hook]
Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime
I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave!!!

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Aiyyo! Squeezin your hammer jammin it
Each of my niggas gamblin with people don't think we family
Clark whip up call up Sammy
I clash with major paper my blood is an alligator
My style is a mile away from y'all niggas Sal of haters
We came to take it over my plane is delayed I drove up with hangers and back up rovers
Movin through the rain with golfers
Who carry heavy armor with bangers and rep regardless
Chef will play the Jeffrey Dahmer dig you when I'm in your garments
Y'all niggas is 'spicious, supercrabfragilistic
Niggas that I'm against is ginzu 'em with the quickness
Rappers is pussy so soft, mad gushy
Go north, your your dad pushed me schooled him cause he had a pussy
We puff crazy reefa too tough the thing'll heat ya up
Got them leeches off your ass nigga keep shit up
We blown the speakers and Chef go and season shit up
Release of the gutter and still wanna beat shit up, whattup!!!

[Hook]
Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime
I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave!!!

[Verse 4: Lord Tariq]
Lord the borough's mainframe, I remain the same chain
Lames play the game to gain cock and aim the than thang (Bang!!!)
I let the thang rang then became the king of caine
Gettin chains slingin thangs no different than Richard mane
Call a order off the water y'all native New Yorker
Caught a case the law was lacin y'all with eights and raw the states applaud
Facin it for sure with just the taste the states and laws
Made to degrade my age limit diminish my cause
Ain't nothin to us nothin move us tightly knitten up and through us
Type of shit the hype the gripe I got despite my life is it
And what you talk is what we walk
And what we up we love this spot
Place none above me of course faithfully yours
I hate when it warms, rapin the law
Came through the door with a cape and cane
Sayin my name wavin the four
Displayin the false aim and then buss claim it was yours
Ain't no team hotter than Team Saga sign the Lord!!!

[Hook]
Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime
I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave!!!

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Who wanna feel the fire from me fuckin with the don
Just save the Ying Yang for Lil' Jon kid it's on
Got the coffin case Slay they try to connect
They know that, Stuyvesant vet a be the livest we get rid of
Greasy is from where the sleezy is from
Devious one, and anytime you need me it's done
Some talkin off the yap trip and what they gonna do?
But know they couldn't find the fuckin heart with John Q
I'm hear to warn you, we vouched your plans
My name is sent to 'mounts of millions you get thousand fans
Little fly by night nigga that's about to land
Let me take the shit up out of your hands
Understand, your games won't work can't hide your own jerk
And any technicalities I'm pullin on skirts
Beside the mink jacket that be where the chrome lurks
So make sure my paper write like we checkin homework, come on

[Hook]
Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime
I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave!!!

[Outro: DJ KaySlay]
DJ KaySlay Drama King!!! Five deadly venoms!!
Ghostface Killah, Kool G. Rap, Raekwon The Chef, Lord Tariq, Big Daddy Kane!!!
We out!!!
[Verse 1 - Akil]
Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you wanna crash the spot
And unlock explode (BOOM) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from G. Rap to Kool Moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin, fast rappin

[Verse 2 - Zaakir]
Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two Glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (HIT IT)
Like Operation PUSH, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop Hobbes, I'm hot like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother get over
The fly Cassanova with the frankincense odor

[Verse 3 - Percee P]
Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brain's software'll glitch
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to BOO and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro, mean like Joe Greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your ho have ta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, or Dahmer', I'mma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

[Verse 4 - Big Daddy Kane]
Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of D-cepts
On streets of L.A. I'm a whole E-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin, still that coochie pressin
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin
Fuck explainin it, who's he testin?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin like a Mystikal song
Please Dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean One less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggas all recruitin a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with Remy
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

[Verse 5 - Chali 2na]
Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Manouvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin yo' backbone
Attackin you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! We just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the King Asiatic and Percee P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-D
Spit venom and burn your body like a STD

[Verse 6 - Marc 7]
Put a 20 on the next brother steppin to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like King-Kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
OFF to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hang-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight
Murderer worldwide the stage is yo' knife
[Intro]
Aw Yea, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics
Cause it's '88
Time to set it straight, know what I'm saying?
And ain't no half stepping
Word, I'm ready:

[Verse 1]
Rappers stepping to me, they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory
They can't get with me
So pick a BC date cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And, stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basing
Friday the 13th, I'mma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes Big not little
So define it
Here's your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk
As the Kane start to talk, cause

[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane

[Verse 2]
My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of emceeing, for those who want to be in
My field in court
Then again on second thought
To have emcees coming out sounding so similar
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it's the
Climax, and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ahh shit!
I stop and stand strong over emcees
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know there

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be want to be competition
Trying to step to me--must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'mma get you at
You think I'm losing?
Psst, picture that

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make emcees evaporate
The party people say 'Damn, that rapper's great'
The creator conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MC's that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'mma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slooow doown
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
Your title, namely me, cause I'm homicidal
That means murder, cause I'm about to hurt a-
Nother MC, that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him
And take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign
As Salaam Alaikum!
Here we go, here we go on the smooth side
Let's take a ride in stride and I'm the guide
With the source, and of course - I don't wanna be the king or boss
I just wanna get my point across
Cause it's time to organize and open your eyes
Realize, we on the rise
To the climax, time to take charge
Whoever said we can't live large?
To seek out fortune without distortion
And stop livin for just a small portion
There is a move to make, we gotta take a chance to break
All chains become awake
Cause this is the new way, to be proud and brave
And I ain't goin out like a slave
In eighty-nine, I'm livin like a champ
Step out my face, talkin bout a food stamp
Child please, put it at ease
Freeze, it's time to get paid in times like these
We can't take shorts or take a loss
So take it from the Kane and go for yours, because

* Chorus *

Uh-huh
There, comes a time, where we can't be in the rear
We gotta step up front, to get our share
Make the change, cause we're not inferior
For example, there was a black Ms. America
Let's start to do for ourself
We can't depend on no one else or the board of health
So hold your own or else you're gonna find
That if you play off of crime you go out like Aunt Jemimah
We gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive
To stay alive, that's the reason I've
Came to, motivate us to the length
Effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch
Takin no mediums or small at all
We gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall
What used to be just hopes and thoughts
Are now in effect, and we can't take shorts, because

* Chorus *

Swing on that right there, pump it up, here we go
Uh-huh, uh-huh, pump it up, here we go
One more thing
Let's unite together, we can't sever never
No matter what or what-ever
Because we need unity to find justice
Just I See Equality so bust this
Take a stand and command to demand what's grand
I know we can if we just understand
The true way of livin that was really meant for us
So one more time, kick the chorus!

* Chorus 2X *

Ah keep it goin y'all
A Prince Paul, rulin em all y'all
A Prince Paul, schoolin em all y'all
And Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony
And Tony Tone never leavin the girls alone
Tony Tone never leavin the girls alone
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stop..
When you work, sometimes it's wet
And when you sweat you're gonna get wet
You're gonna get wet (OW!)

Work it, oh come on now, work it, ow
Now work, come on work it, ow
(You're gonna get wet)
Work it, once agin come on now, ow
Oh, oh, oh, oh now

[Verse 1]
I was the one to say I'd get the job done, I did it and got with it
I must admit it was well fitted
A piece of the pie would be fly
Instead of a crumb for a bum, uh I gotta get some
But I don't wanna be a second hand, middle man
I wanna take a grand stand and
Makin' the cash flow grow
Pullin' myself outta the dirt
And a job ain't nothin' but work

[Hook 1 with various ad-libs]
WORK!
A job ain't nothin' but work
WORK! WORK!
A job ain't nothin' but work
WORK! WORK!

[Verse 2]
Mo' money, mo' money, mo' money got get me
To get paid in this trade
And I believe that I can acheive
To make ends meet like a hair weave
Survivin' in this economy people in the wold wanna be
Stayin' in the upper class so you're the path
The rich gets the most and the porr gets so little
And only money love can make it in the middle
I can't let life get the best of me
I gotta take, take control of my own destiny
Control what I hold and of course be the boss of myself
No one else will bring my wealth
I gotta hit them streets to make ends meet
So just bust the style of a hustler
Runnin' scam so damn many people will probably get hurt
And a job ain't nothing but work

[Hook 2 with various ad-libs]
Workin' everyday
All the damn week
A job ain't nothin' but work to me
Workin' everyday
On the subway
A job ain't nothin' but work to me
A job ain't nothin' but work

[Verse 3]
No more workin' overtime
You get your's and I'll get mine
I won't stop at any cause
I won't stop till I'm the boss

[Hook 2 with various ad-libs]

[Verse 4]
Straight outta the ghetto
None of the Beverly Hills or Flushing Meadows
I made it this far had to gamble, scramble, ramble
Ain't no shame in my game
And I came through like a double bread
But still there's more here
I'm not the greedy I'm the needy, seekin' that financial status
That where my pockets will be the fattest
I'm not gonna be employed when times are hard
I'm so against workin' I wouldn't even take a blowjob
I'd rather do my own thing
I gotta be the one in charge
To make myself live large
A J-O-B is not for me, I don't want no parts of it
So take this obe and shove it

[Hook 1 with various ad-libs]

[Hook 2 with various ad-libs]
Verse 1:

Here comes the conquering brother that fathoms and never ceases
Violators pick up the pieces (uh)
That are left behind as you're left to find
The fury of the five fingers of death are mine
Rippin' on the microphone, receitin' poem
Givin' competition a Big Daddy syndrome
Some step up, (mmm) none kept up (mmm)
They rap a brief moment and then shut up
Lips are sealed because all of this is real
I'm not about frontin', I tell the real deal of society (what);
So how we livin
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving or like Robin Givens?
Not to offend
I just want you to comprehend every message I send (tell 'em)
Cause I don't understand, I have to wonder, damn
How could this lifestyle be fun to man
To see a brother gettin' paid undercover
Sellin' drugs to one another
Cause all the glamour you get is miscellaneous
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
Like um, um, let's say, un, poison
Destruction to all your own boys and girls who like to buy and give it a try
Admire and can't deny the high, that's why they soon die
These are the games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay
No sign of brotherly love
Just scavengers in search of.....

Chorus:

Another victory (cut and scratched)

Verse 2:

When I'm ridin' in my Volvo, cops harass me
They never ride past me, they hound me like Lassie
Wantin' to give me a summons or a ticket
Huh, I got a place for them to stick it (kick it)
They can't understand to see a black man
Drivin' a car that costs 25 grand
The first thing they say is "Where'd you steal her?"
And then they assume that I'm a drug dealer
Huh, that just makes me wanna laugh
Cause now I'm a star and your son got my autograph
So all the cops on the highway gettin' me
My name ain't Keith, so could you please stop Sweatin' me
So I can flow and go on, so on and so on
To all the jams Cee throw on
Reachin' a summit as you learn from it
A lesson taught from yours truly, so here cometh
The royal majesty, others have to be
Fully prepared, though they still won't last with me
So when you hope to hang or even handle
I'll show the meaning of power and just cancel (period)
Out of order, conquer and slaughter
You're comin' up shorter, boy, you'll need more to
Compete cause the heat is deep in concrete
Defeat, bring up the fleet, flee 'fore we meet
Or stay away, puttin' new rhymes on layaway
Then come get this when you're ready for business
Cause aaaaah yeah, I'm with this (I'm ready)
Yo, Mister Cee, what is this?

(Repeat chorus)

Verse 3:

MC's and enemies I freeze at 32 degrees
Because they can't drop rhymes like these
Competition never saw none done
So pay attention as I mention the 411
Just the other day, I heard a brother say
"Taxi cabs don't even come my way
They all be afraid they won't get paid
So they zoom right past and pick up a lighter shade
And if they stop, the first thing they want
No more than two people and the money up-front
Treatin' me like I'm some type of thug
It might sound bugged but they don't wanna get mugged."
Who's in the right or wrong? It's time to unite along
The righteous with a walk in success and be strong
Instead of lookin' for someone to beef with
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
Rappers of today like (Kid'N'Play)
Hey, even my man L.L. Cool J
(Stetsasonic) and EPMD
Public Enemy and (BDP)
Salt 'N' Pepa cause we can't sever never
Wheihter, whatever, we better stand together
That means unite, not fightin' or fussin' or cussin'
Save all the base for the pipe and start lovin'
One another cause separation is a flaw
So endure for more and stop lookin'; for....

(Repeat chorus 'till end)
Uh Yeah
Ayo Prim' man
I be hollering at these cats man, you know
Trying to make them understand the realness in this here game man you know
This how serious it is on these streets
Yo check it, uh...

[1st verse]
Survival of the Fittest today, that's still the test
I seen em kill the best, in this ghetto wilderness
It's real in the field, cause they bring the drama hard
Guliani got New York looking like it's Amistad
Be whatever's clever, with the thought of slipping
Thugs start to flipping, black women resort to stripping
When they say, the drug game's dead, that's not a fable
Hustlers is locked down, or either got a label
Either try to keep the heat on ya, on the street corner
Ya sleep, a week later, your peeps mourn ya
Stick up kids, pudding in working in pea's
Your food stamps feed the next cat Turkey and Cheese
Ain't no devourance, I speak it now in defense
I'm only here to make dollar, outta knowledge, power, sense
So be about the paper, till your pockets are full
Please stop with the bull, less is profitable, come on...

[Hook: scratched by DJ Premier]
"Making moves any type of way"
"Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb"
"Take it back to the days of..."
"Do or Die"
"Straight from Bedstuy"
"Know what I'm sayin"

"Making moves any type of way"
"Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb"
"Put these rapper's under pressure, till they break"
"Ya'll know who this is"
"You know"

[2nd verse]
If you in this for the cheddar, you better get it fast
Cause in another minute, ain't gon be no middle class
What you think this shit will last, time to Monopolize
Streets got lots of guys, and I know we got the size
What I prophesize, is the way to start the rise
Cross the T's, dot the I's, and we will not demise
I come through the door, four four's to get at your's
The Eye of the Tiger, no, I'm coming with the claws
It's my chance to get the finance, so why dance
With proper guidance, To take it to the next high stance
I'm tryin to live Incredible, get dat revenue
Thinking ahead of you, that's your girl, let her through
What you better do, is try to chase the paper
Society will rape ya, when you fight forces of nature
I been walked that path before, so I do feel you
The early bird will get the worm, and drink it with Tequila
Ya heard...

[Hook]

[3rd verse]
I've been sitting outside, building with this O.G
Never will I forget the jewels, that he told me
He said when you holding, never show your wins
In this ghetto, your friends flip on you like Doberman's
Dat buldge in your pocket I see, you better hide
While you at it, tuck that medallion inside
Forget the microphone, you need the iron we squeeze
So you can, clap four like Siamese seals
Distrust and greed, this was indeed
Given by the man's, and know we living by the land
And life I tackle, with my soul trapped inside this Tabernackle
The only thing that's missing is the shackle's
Do what we gotta, to enterprise with the dollar
Create a different aura, for the children of tommorow
Therefore I kick styles, to make my cash
Come to me in big piles, and I'm out like 6 files
Ya heard...

Ice-T, let me kick my credentials
A young player, bred in South Central
L.A., home of the bodybag
You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: "Lay down!"
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name
He told me: "Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street
Rap on my record, man, Kimiko, send Ice the beat"

I'm back, on the block, on the screen
I'm on the wax, I'm on the stage, I'm on the scene
I'm on the case, just like an attorney
The Dude took me on a magic journey
To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when I was young and hung out
He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

Back up and give the brother room
To let poetry bloom to whom
It may concern or consume
As I reminisce before this
The bliss that exist
But now we brought about a twist
Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner
You never seen a blackman on _The Honeymooners_
But now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
The elevation of a people built is so
Jesse Jackson, Miss America a black one
No more livin for just a small fraction
I was once told by the Dude that knowledge is a food
To nourish, so to conclude
This from an Asiatic descendant, Big Daddy is shocked

An everlasting omnipresence is my present
State of being, seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds, and I put em in flight
As I transcend, a-scend or de-scend
Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that don't know how God blessed us
Because man messed up, the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before

(Now I would - I would contend that ah -
The rappers - rap is here to stay)
BDK: Because of "Raw Attitude", that's how I ended up getting the music for "Young, Gifted and Black". Me and Antoinette was cool, and Marley asked about doing a promo. I was like, you know, I'm gonna have Antoinette do it with me. I made a track over at Marley's house, and me and Antoinette, we did that "Raw Attitude" promo, cause I had "Raw", and she had "I Got An Attitude". So we called the promo "Raw Attitude." We did it just for Marley, for the BLS show

But Marley took the beat and gave it to MC Shan for his album. So afterwards, I'm like, yo, that's my beat! How you just gonna give Shan my beat? I'm like, well, you owe me a beat, homie. And he's like, alright, we'll work it out. And I'm like, no, I already know what I want. Cause I had already heard that track, and that was a track that he had originally had for Shan. So I was like, no, I already know what I want. That one with the [sings beat], yeah, I need that. And that's how I ended up getting "Young, Gifted and Black"
BDK: "Set It Off." I think about James Brown's "Sex Machine," how you're amped before it start. How he just, [adopts James Brown voice] "I'm ready to get into my thing. Moving, grooving. Can we count it off?" It's like, the energy James is bringing. You ain't even hear the beat drop yet, but you sitting there feeling like Bobby Byrd -- "Yeah! Yeah!" You know what I'm saying? And then they, [singing] "1,2,3,4 -- Get up"

I'm like, I want to do something like that, where I just bring the energy before the beat even drop. So that's why, with "Set It Off," you see it start off just with the rhymes -- "Let it roll/Get bold/I just can't..." and then the beat, [sings] "Duh nuh nuh" -- it comes in later. That I tried to model behind James Brown's "Sex Machine"
BDK: We did that the day that Biz was supposed to record "Nobody Beats the Biz." I came there with the lyrics and knocked on the door. Marley was talking through the chain on the door like, "Nah, Biz ain't here." I'm like, "You remember me? I was here with him the other day." He said, "Well, he ain't here"

I said, "I took the train from Brooklyn." "He ain't here, money -- I don't know what to tell you." So I was like, "Alright, man. Here's the lyrics he's supposed to do today. Just give them to him." And that's when he was like, "Yo, you writing Biz' stuff?" I'm like, "I mean, I wrote that."

So then he took the chain off, and he's like, "Well, how this go? Can you say it for me?" And I said the rhyme. And he said, "Oh yeah, come on in." And then we got to talking, he asked me to rhyme. I spit another rhyme for him and then we worked on a song, and it ended up being "I'll Take You There."
SameOldShawn: You've kind of hinted at that before, that maybe you did a little more production work on your early stuff than is commonly thought

BDK: Yeah. It's the type of thing where at that time I was young, so I didn't know. I was just going by what I was told. "Raw," "Ain't No Half Steppin'" -- pretty much everything off the first album except for "Set It Off." "Set It Off" was actually done by Mark 45 King, and Marley did "I'll Take You There"

But other than that, pretty much all that stuff is me

SOS: Really?

BDK: Yeah. "Half Steppin'," "Long Live the Kane," "Raw," all that stuff is me. I mean, "Just Rhymin' With Biz," we didn't even really do that at Marley's house. I did that at my man Shemshawn house in L.G., Lafayette Gardens, and just brought it to Marley's house

SOS: And then somehow the credits ended up saying something a little different

BDK: Yeah. See, what I was told was, "We got the deal with Warner Brothers because they look at Mr. Magic as the air personality that's gonna play any of our songs because he's on the radio, and they look at Marley as the super-producer. If they thought that Marley wasn't the super-producer, we all lose the deal, and none of us would have no label. So it needs to say, 'Produced by Marley Marl.' I mean, don't worry, you gonna get your money." And my dumb ass, like 18, 19 years old, I believed that -- oh, okay
SameOldShawn: On the "Show and Prove" song, there are a couple lines that kind of sound maybe like they're aimed at Erick Sermon. Did you guys have any kind of disagreement or back-and-forth during that era?

BDK: Honestly, yeah. We talked afterwards. But by the time we talked, it was too late. The song was already pressed. But, yeah

SOS: What was behind that?

BDK: It was something that he said on a song. Someone else came back to me and was like, "Yo, I asked him, and he said, yeah, he was talking about you." And I was like, let's get the party started then

SOS: Nice

BDK: So I took a cheap shot. When I went to go approach him about it, he told me, nah, that's not what he meant. You know, you're probably the first person to ever ask me that, too
[Big Daddy Kane]
Mmm.. ohh yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, ohh yeah

Allow me to introduce myself
As the Big Daddy Kane
A smooth lover from around the way
That's bound to drive any bitch insane

[Dolemite (Rudy Raw Moore)]
Well Dolemite is my name
And rappin and tappin is my game

[Kane]
Oh yeah? Well me tell you somethin Mr. Dolemite
The shit you talkin years ago, I could see
But it's the 90's now and rap is all about me

[Dolemite]
Listen.. when it comes down to rappin
I was THROUGH with it before you learned what to do with it
I'm the KING so I'm stakin my claim
In the rappin game
Y'know? For all players, I am the speaker
I'm also known as the hot pussy seeker
When it comes down to ridin up and down in some pussy
I make it weaker
Also it gets a little deeper
I was walkin down Broadway the other day
An old old lady came my way
She said, "I'll be glad when you 'come 18
I'm gonna give you a funkin like you ain't never seen!"
I said, "LADY! Why wait for so much time to pass?
I've been WANTIN to tear up yo' old gray ass"
So I pulled out my dick
It was so shiny it looked like it was painted
The ho took one look and damn near fainted
I stuck it in the bitch and the bitch began to shout
That, "Oh Mr. Dolemite, take that motherfucker OUT!"

[Kane]
Well you ain't sayin nothin slick to a can of oil
I walked barefoot from New York to Dallas
Won for Pimp of the Year at the Caesar's Palace
Made a big snowstorm on the 4th of July
And drunk the waters in the Atlantic Ocean til that shit was dry
I was makin money before Washington was put on a bill
And I kicked Jack's ass and took his ho Jill
I'm the one who broke the bull's back
And made people say FUCK McDonald's and call ME the Big Mac

[Dolemite]
Why you long lanky motherfucker
You ain't nothin but a sucker!
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives
Shot in the ass with two Colt .45's
I've been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel
I chew up railroad iron, and shit out steel!
I jumped in the ocean and swallowed a whale
Handcuff lightning and throw THUNDER's ass in jail

[Kane]
Why you ignorant decrepit motherfucker
Let me tell you somethin
I'm the one that put the M in mackin
Because when you did it you was only actin
I made pimpin a full time job
So bitches wouldn't have to go out and rob
I made the streets of New York hot as a SAUNA
And hung a Home Sweet Ho sign on every corner
Yes I'm the player of all players and the mack of all macks
Give a headache to Excedrin and knock the SHIT out of Ex-Lax

[Dolemite]
Why you insecure no business barn junkyard
Rat soup eatin motherfucker!!
It was in the early 1960's when I originated my pimpin game
I was callin whores jives ass bitches
And pimps - sucker ass lame
KANE, before you can take my reign
You gotta cook me a chicken and a half a day
Walk from New York to Los Angeles and throw the bones away
You gotta be BORN BLIND and cannot see
Yo' bitches have the POCKS in the ass so bad they can't even pee
Ride a bald eagle a million feet in the AIR
And get out and do the runnin man while you up there
Have the Mumps and the Asiastic Flu
And the Crabs around yo' ass start singin the Yankee Doodle Doo!
