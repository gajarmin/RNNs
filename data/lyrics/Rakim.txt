[Produced by Eric B]

[Intro]
Yo Rakim, what's up?
Yo, I'm doing the knowledge, E, man I'm trying to get paid in full
Well, check this out, since Norby Walters is our agency, right? True
Cara Lewis is our agent, word up
Zakia and 4th and Broadway is our record company, indeed
Okay, so who we rolling with then?
We rolling with Rush of Rushtown Management
Check this out
Since we talking over this def beat right here that I put together
I wanna hear some of them def rhymes, you know what I'm saying?
And together we can get paid in full

[Verse 1]
Thinking of a master plan
Cause ain’t nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking how could I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain’t nothing funny
Stop smiling, be still, don’t nothing move but the money
But now I learned to earn cause I’m righteous
I feel great so maybe I might just search for a 9 to 5
If I strive then maybe I’ll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place cause, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B and a nice big plate of
This, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it’s still a wish
Cause I don’t like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now's a test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, cause I’m paid in full

[Outro]
Rakim, check this out, yo
You go to your girl house and I'll go to mine
Cause my girl is definitely mad
Cause it took us too long to do this album
Yo, I hear what you're saying
So let's just pump the music up
And count our money
Yo, well check this out, yo Eli
Turn down the bass down
And let the beat just keep on rockin'
And we outta here
Yo, what happened to peace?
Peace
{DJ Premier cuts early Eric B. & Rakim records}
"It's been a long time.."
".. Rakim, the microphone soloist"

[Verse 1 - Rakim]
Follow procedures, the crowd couldn't wait to see this
Nobody been this long awaited since Jesus
Who wouldn't believe this - I heard the word on the street is
I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
With Mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics
Cause new days is dawning, new ways of performing
Brainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning
On and on and, I got the whole world responding
Ra, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warning
The Emperor, well known for, inventing a sentence
Full of adventure, turning up the temperature
Rush with adrenaline, how long has it been again
To be in the state of mind that Rakim is in?

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Rakim]
When I'm out propping - either hanging or shopping
People see me, stop, and ask me when the album dropping
The wait is over, in formation like a soldier
Like I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older
I broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents
My only challenge, is not to explode in violence
I'm Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit
At least once during the course of a day, it's automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharoah
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me
You know, Ra want property like Muammar Qaddafi
More thoughts than Bibles, recital - taught disciples
A sawed off mic, so words scatter like a rifle
Thoughts that's trifle, I'm busting these for you
Aiyyo, technical difficulties is through

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Rakim]
When I flow at night, I show them new heights, I go to write
They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
Critics and biters, don't know where my source of light is
Still leave authors and writers with arthritis
Cursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile
The rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now
Cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while
So be alarmed, what you bout to see is the bomb
Like, 3-D in 'Nam, vivid like CD-Rom
Info kept like "internet.com"
My note-book's my bond like the Holy Qu'ran
Since I came in the door, said it before
But no I ain't down with Eric B. no more
At night the open mic be inviting me to rhyme
So, yo, I'm online: it's been a long time
[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Hook]
And now for my next number I'd like to return to the

[Nas]
Classic

[Kanye West]
Uh, uh, - timeless

[Kool G Rap]
Live straight classic

[Nas]
Classic

[Kool G Rap]
Live, straight classic

[Kanye West]
Timeless

[Sample]
I'd like to return to the classic

[Rakim]
Kanye West

[Rakim Sample]
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Uh yea, is y'all ready for 20-07
It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer, why are we bugging out
Since '86 showin' the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of classic is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubting the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosigning, even non-believers
Since I came in the door became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair Air Force One sneakers
Uptowns, we call em uppies, when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One teaches
Nas made you look before the heaters
I bet you Kan' had em on when he walked with Jesus

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You can't buy this Superfly-ness
Like a shine is, your highness
Is performing, look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, til you listen to my pace
Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident
And y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic, it's gon' last forever then
I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been

[Hook]

[Nas Samples - One Love & It Ain't Hard To Tell]
Hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Nas'll rock well

[Verse 3: Nas]
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper
To them, it hurts to hear this
Oh you went platinum, yeah that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it, the car ain't important
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Leaving you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's, the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to, yeah

[Hook: Samples]

[KRS-One Sample]
"Of course - we have Blastmaster KRS-One"

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
How many of y'all got Criminal Minded
You, you, you, y'all don't be blinded
Me, I got no jewels on my neck
Why, I don't need em, I got your respect
KRS-One, twenty years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we's a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at?, c'mon where you at
This is the difference between emceeing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun
These are the lyrics of KRS-One

[Hook]
[Verse 1]
Turn up the bass, check out my melody, hand out a cigar
I'm letting knowledge be born and my name's the R
A-K-I-M not like the rest of them, I'm not on a list
That's what I'm saying, I drop science like a scientist
My melody's in a code, the very next episode
Has the mic often distorting, ready to explode
I keep the mic at Fahrenheit, freeze emcees and make 'em colder
The listener's system is kickin' like solar
As I memorize, advertise like a poet
Keep you going when I'm flowing, smooth enough, you know it
But rough, that's why the moral of my story I tell will be
Nobody beats the R, check out my melody

[Verse 2]
So what, I'm a microphone fiend, addicted soon as I sing
One of these four emcees so they don't have to scream
I couldn't wait to take the mic, blow into it to test
Then let my melody play, then the record suggest
That I'm dropping bombs, but I stay peace and calm
Any emcee that disagree with me, wave your arm
And I'll break, when I'm through breaking, I'll leave you broke
Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke
So stand back, you wanna rap, all of that can wait
I won't push, I won't beat around the bush
I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
You might try but you can't get close to
Because I'm number one, competition is none
I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun
Whether playing ball or bobbing in the hall
Or just writing my name in graffiti on the wall
They shouldn't have told me you said you control me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your money, pull out your cut
Pull up a chair, and I'mma tear shit up
My name is Rakim Allah, and R and A stands for "Ra"
Switch it around, it still comes out "R"
So easily will I E-M-C-E-E
My repetition of words is check out my melody
Some bass and treble is moist, scratching and cutting a voice
And when it's mine, that's when the rhyme is always choice
I wouldn't have come to say my name and run the same weak shit
Putting blurs and slurs and words that don't fit in a rhyme
Why waste time on the microphone
I take this more serious than just a poem
Rock from party to party, backyard to yard
Now tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods

[Verse 3]
The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp
I can swing off anything even a string of a harp
Just turn it on and start rocking, mind no introduction
Til I finish dropping science, no interruption
When I approach I exercise like a coach
Using a melody and add numerous notes
And with the mic and the R-A-K-I-M
It's attached, like a match, I will strike again
Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
Put in a order to pursue with the momentum, except
I say one rhyme out of order, a longer rhyme shorter
Or pause, but don't stop the tape recorder

[Verse 4]
I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor
Melody arranger, poet et cetera
Extra events, the grand finale like bonus
I am the man they call the microphonist
With wisdom, which means wise words being spoken
Too many at one time, watch the mic start smoking
I came to express the rap I manifest
Stand in my way, and I'll veto of the word's protest
Emcees that wanna be best, they're gonna
Be dissed if they don't get from in front of
All they can go get is me a glass of Moet
A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
I take 7 emcees put 'em in a line
And add 7 more brothers who think they can rhyme
Well, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine
Now that's 21 emcees ate up at the same time
Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doing
No fessing, no messing around, no chewing
No robbing or buying, biting, why borrow
This slob will stop trying, fighting to follow
My unusual style will confuse you a while
If I was water, I'd flow in the Nile
So many rhymes, you won't have time to go for yours
Just because of applause, I have to pause
Right after tonight is when I prepare
To catch another sucker duck emcee out there
Cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe
And after this, you'll call me your majesty
My melody

[Verse 5]
Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorized it
Eric B made a cut and advertised it
My melody's created for emcees in the place
They try to listen cause I'm dissin' them, so pick up your face
Shook off your neck as you try to detect my pace
Now you're buggin', almost doggin' off my rhyme-like bass
The melody that I'm styling, smooth as a violin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island
My wisdom is swift, no matter if
My momentum is slow, emcees still stand stiff
I'm genuine like leather, inclined to be clever
Emcees you beat the R, I'll say "oh never"
So Eric B, cut it easily, and
Check out my melody
[Produced By Eric B]

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Follow me into a solo, get in the flow
And you can picture like a photo
Music mix, mellow maintains to make
Melodies for emcees, motivates the breaks
I'm everlasting, I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as x-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard
Flip it - now it's a daily word
I can get iller than 'Nam, I kill and bomb
But no alarm - Rakim'll remain calm
Self-esteem makes me super, superb and supreme
But for a microphone, still I fiend
This was a tape, I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I want to see you keep following and swallowing
Taking and making, biting and borrowing
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
But I'mma let you sweat, you still ain't formed, you a
Step away from frozen, stiff as if you're posing
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me and while you're thinking you were first
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe
What could you say as the earth gets further and further away
Planets as small as balls of clay
Astray into the milky way, worlds out of sight
Far as the eye can see not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As you stare in the darkness, your knowledge is took
So keep staring, soon you suddenly see a star
You better follow it, cause it's the R
This is a lesson if you're guessing and if you're borrowing
Hurry hurry step right up and keep following the leader

[Verse 2: Rakim]
This is a lifetime mission, vision a prison
Aight, listen
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep you moving cause the crowd said so
Dance! Cuts rip your pants
Eric B on the blades bleeding to death, call the ambulance
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone, murdering emcees
Let's quote, a rhyme from a record I wrote
(Follow the leader) Yeah, dope
Cause every time I stop it seems you're stuck
As soon as you try to step off you self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showing and proving and letting knowledge be born
Then after that I live forever. You disagree?
You say never? Then follow me
From century to century, you'll remember me
In history, not a mystery or a memory
God by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave
But remember - you're not a slave
Cause we was put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, rebuild my name
I guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted, it can't be changed or switched
Here's a lesson if you're guessing and borrowing
Hurry, hurry step right up and keep following the leader

[Verse 3: Rakim]
A furified freestyle - lyrics of fury
My third eye make me shine like jewelry
You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when it fade, I'll watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait, to break and eliminate
On every traitor or snake, so stay awake
And follow and follow because the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
I'm not him, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt, cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed, slow down and let the leader lead
Word to daddy...indeed
The R's a rolling stone, so I'm rolling
Directions told then, the rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin' a brother said dig him, I never dug him
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug him
Into danger zone he should arrange his own
Face it, it's basic, erase or change your tone
There's one R in the alphabet
It's a one letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B, be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state, followers tailgate
Keep coming but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant, clap your hands, you won a trip
The price is right don't make a deal too soon
How many notes, can you name this tune?
Follow the leader is a title/theme/task
Now you know, you don't have to ask
Rap is rhythm and poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might catch up if you follow the records he wrecks
Until then keep eating and swallowing
You better take a deep breath and keep following the leader
[Verse 1]
I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone, no one gets on cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tamed
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
Competing cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me, the one you got your idea from?
But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher
When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of
Biting it will make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should have broke
Because I ain't no joke

[Verse 2]
I got a question as serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling
Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits
Get the style down pat then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours
The E-M-C-E-E don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me, come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those seven emcees
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your offbeat DJ, if anything he play
Sound familiar, I'll wait til E say
Play 'em, so I'm a have to dis and broke
You could get a smack for this
I ain't no joke

[Verse 3]
I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation cause when I invent
I nominated my DJ the president
When I emcee, I'll keep a freestyle, going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
There'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiending
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the middle of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
Cause I'm moving the crowd and B a record fader
No interruptions and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
Cause everything is real on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And I'll take you for a walk through hell
Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple stage darkness
When it get dark again then I'm a spark this
Microphone cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finished when the beat is gone
I'm no joke
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claiming they bangers
Doing all sorts of twisted shit with their fingers
Disrespecting the game, no home training or manners
I was doing this shit when you was shitting your Pampers
I was moving them grams before you knew what a hand in hand was
Ducking the vans, radars, the scanners
Before you knew what "hard white" or "tan" was
I was hitting the turnpike, aight, with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, cuz aight with them hammers
I was pricking my finger before you knew what a "Fam" was
I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
300 mil later, now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night, grand fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was putting Peter Pan up in your room, y'all fucking with whom?
Allow me to retort
You cowards is just now learning the shit that we taught
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
About a high speed Porsche, i.e
You niggas ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door
Like Eric B. for Pres, respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking 'em so long, fucking your little neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggas that got life really like what I sing
Cause they know what it's really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I don't write be the illest shit that's ever been recited
In the game word to the hyphen in my name!
J-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa
The past, present, nigga the future, proper
The holy trinity of hip-hop is us
We give Dre his props but that's where it stops, it's the Roc

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before
People I used to know, just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played, the best to emerge in the game is the Watcher

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rakim]
I'm Rated R, my brain contains graphics thangs
It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends
It's like, watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
Take away the added profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try copin', I've seen enough shit
To leave your frame of mind broken, I'm still alive and scopin'
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'mma die with my eyes open, the watcher

[Hook]
[Verse: Rakim]
What, uhh, yo
Just when things seemed the same, and the whole scene is lame
I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains 'til things change
They strain to sling slang, I'm trained to bring game
History that I arranged been regained by King James
Go to practice, with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics
Women that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's
Stacks of mathematics to feed yo-asiatics
As I find out, what the facts is, for geographic
No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is
I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers
While you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious
And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses
Shine permanently only my mind's concernin me
Fire burns in me eternally time's eternity
Followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary
Determinely advance technology better than Germany
Since the first days you know of, till the last days is over
I was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah
From a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom
Some of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn
From the ancient hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures
I study I know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious
Date back I go beyond, check the holy Qu'ran
To speeches at the autobahn, now we get our party on
So being benificent, I bless em with dialogue
They expectin the next testament, by the God
I roam through battlezones with chrome for chaperone
Blast beat with saxophones one of the baddest rappers known
Every country city and borough, sidestreet and ghetto
Isle and alley and meadow, theories thorough enough to echo
When it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man
And the whole mass was ran under one master plan
Since the world's metamorphis, and the plan is kept in orbit
Turntables we spin awkward but needles never skip off it
Rhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors
It'll answer your questions if you understand the message
From the days of the slave choppers, to the new age of prophets
As heavy as hip-hop is I'm always ready to drop it
From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs
And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme

The 18th Letter, the prophecy professor
I stay clever, long as the planet stay together
Bring up praise from Mecca, make a phrase for the better
In new days to remember, always and forever
(repeat 2X)

The R baby
[Verse 1 - Rakim]
You off the planet, wherever you at you stand out
Plus you specialize in freakin your man out
Put it all in one pot lets see if it pan out
Stick ya hand out, I got it all planned out
Layin out the way, I set a date to wed on
Plus you got your head on, you my queen from here on
Lookin like lady Revlon with all red on
She fiending till I'm in her arms, I'm King
Put the silk bedspread on
Rose pedals and scent candle lit
Victoria's Secret set on
Rough sex turnin her on
So ghetto, innocent but scandalous just bling and fur on
Million dollar habit, she said its a fetish she gotta have it
Once she get it, she holla thats it
Keep the waters rapid
The hotter its automatic

Oh shit, she OD'n again I got an addict

[Verse 2: Truth Hurts]
He breaks me down, he builds me up
He fills my cup, I like it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes in late, but it's okay
He do, I do, he knows the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on his team, he keeps me clean
And gives me things, he makes me scream

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessing, spontaneous
He's so persuasive and I'm his lady

[Verse 3: Truth Hurts]
Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Rakim]
Thinking of a master plan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted
You OG'd and you OD: addicted
[Hook: Truth Hurts]
Do you ever think
What life would be
Where you will go
After you die?

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Do you ever sit back and get a little too high
Start thinking what happens to you when you die?
Does your soul rest where your coffin is
Or is death just a metamorphosis?
Does life go on in the mental form
If we live a good life will we get reborn?
Is it a heaven or we trapped in hell?
Where do we go from here, nobody came back to tell
If we reincarnated or perish in time
Could you shine when darkness inherits your mind?
And your eyes closed for good, you out the galaxy now
Is this subconscious dream my reality now?
Listen to brain, with no physical frame
Could we return to the hood on a spiritual plane?
Ask yourself, If I pass tonight
Am I prepared for what's after life? (After you die)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rakim]
Could we come back, do we get left in the past?
Fuck that, I'mma kick death in the ass
To come walk with the creator, 'til my mind is greater
Get insight so I could design and find data
'Til my third eye gives me a bird's eye view
Focus 'til my ghost is on a curb by you
Watchin you mourn my death, like im lost in time
But im with you even if I don't cross your mind
When you pour out liquor, im catchin the Cognac
When you pull out a spliff im catchin the contact
Try to look after my people, that's trapped in evil
Playin craps and c-low, to get gats and kilos
And still do some of the things that I love to do
Hang on the streets, throw it up in a club or two
See women and catch'em in their wildest dreams
Possess 'em, make'em do the wildest things
And my peeps, what I'mma do, is pray that you blessed
And my kids, keep'em away from the angel of death
So just in case if I pass tonight
Yo, im prepared for what's after life. (After you die)

[Hook]
[Verse 1]
I'm back, the god remains, still at the end
They sabotage the game, still I'm a win
Rakim Allah's the name, ill with a pen
No one can dodge the rain, kill'em again
In a club or the streets I swerve, cool in the cut
Looking to see what occurs, crusin' the truck
Shorty got deadly curves, soothin' her up
If I must explain with words, I smooth as a fuck!
The world's most greatest hip-hop's elite
You obsolete, you cannot compete, drop the beat
Keep ya ear to the ground when I rock the street
Cock the heat, we deep papi got to eat
So cut on the mic and spit, I much rougher
Plenty of ice and a whip, plus a crusher
Because I don't like to stick, or bust a brother
Long as they never forget I'm a ill muther fucker

[Hook]
So if you love to get your party on
And you feel that your game is strong
And you get mad when the broads is gone
You like it all-night-long
And when they love it when the place is warm
And they go out for their favorite song
They hate when the player game is wrong
They like it all-night-long

[Verse 2]
My caliber's out rated
Yeah player, so why hate it
My rhyme through out of control, when I say it
Spit back with a rap or a gat, can I spray it
How can I say it? I leave it de-hydrated
I take aim, and he keep the place flamin'
Till the place cave in, aye yo this ain't a safe haven
The best is yet to come, so they stay in
They keep the music loud, the lights is low
The kid with a different style, I like to flow
It's time to move the crowd, tonight's the show
See what it's all about, they like to go
Get henny and mo and cris
The clothes, the platinum, gold, the wrist
Plenty of doe, and chicks who pose for flicks
Women who love roll their hips, when I'm holding this

[Verse 3]
My mic's a equipped with a microchip, with a million Megs
Bite this I might flip, spread a billion plagues
Put medicine in it before I kill ya dead
You can get away, if you can feel your legs
Could you walk? No, at least you fought though
Auto fours blow a hole in your torso
Damage his brain with more flow until he talk slow
Try to say something now? I thought so!
I leave emcee's bleeding, while I'm fleeing across sea-in
Start breeding, double my Swiss cheese in Sweden
Free on the weekend, come back see if he breathing
They breathing, somebody left his brains beat in
A deadly attack is rare, style will be raw
Be ready to rap you'll hear, as wild as before
If I bust a gat in the air, watch the galaxy fall
And the world will be splat on the floor, that'll be all
Knowledge will begin until I finish this song
'Cuz the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on
You sweat as you step about to get hype
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic
You're physically in this with me but how could you tell
If it's meant to be hip-hop if you're not mentally as well
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured
Into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored
If you just keep kickin' listen - to the mix
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
Holds and controls you 'til I leave
You fall deeper in the style - it's hard to breathe
The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then
Bring 'em to the front 'cuz my rhymes' the oxygen
Then wave your hands - when you're ready I'll send you
Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue
And so on and I'mma go on simultaneously
And even if I stop - the rhyme remains to be
Rising to the top - and I came to drop it
Catch it and quiz it - is my topic
Universual 'cuz I move everybody to come
By exercising your mind you'll coincide as one
You look around and see how packed the party starts to get
I draw a crowd - like an architect
The five borroughs react and all the islands attract
And every state can't wait - so they attack
Off a spot on the floor - squeeze in cuz it's packed
It'll be more room if MC's play the back
I'm the R the A to the K-I-M
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
The microphone fiend if I was a fake
Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make
I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite
Sung it on stage some said it don't sound like
The voice on the record - I see what you mean
Because the system was wack, so I had to scream
So just - give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it
If not - into the crowd I'll throw it
Pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well
Before I let go I'mma spark your brain cells
I took time to write - tonight I will recite
So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight
Rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin
MC's are knowin' that's why they're goin
Home to tell a friend when the party ends
"Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again"
Cuz mic by mic and stage by stage
Tape by tape and page by page
When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix
The rougher the cuts - the rougher the rhyme gets
Deeper and Deeper - I hope you understand it
I made it up myself and I planned it
For other MC's who waste time
Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme
I cross my arms and I was waiting - but I was hating
The rappers on the microphone was fronting - just faking
They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin'
To get up on the microphone and then start takin'
Control of the mic - uptight when I grabbed it
So hug the speaker- your ear's a magnet
Attracted to a freestyle put in effect
You listen to the man while you're sippin' Moet
So Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight)
Give me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little
I want you to hear this perfectly clear
Catch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea?
I hope you knowledge the beginning cuz I'm finished this song
The rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on...
[Intro]
Bring it on…
Come on, bring it…

[Verse 1]
Boom! My idea fill the room with light, soon as I write
Tunes are dynamite
Scenery’s out of sight
Show’s tonight, I seal your doom tight
My platoon is right, puttin’ bullet wounds in the mic
Once again it’s the paragraph chemist
Inventors are finished, the experimentist
Rakim is the elementor, I invent more courses
The editor with thoughts of a sorcerer (bring it)
Act like you want it –
It isn’t a man that’ll take it from me, I hold the mic prisoner
Rescues that’ll reach next crews, that speech
Unless you know how to teach, retreat to the beat
I swing it better than Tarzan
Once it’s in the R's hand, all they can say is “aw, man”
A mass of people in hysteria
Yo, any bitin’ emcees in the area?
Bring
It…

[Hook]
Bring it on
(On and on and on and on)
Bring it… bring it on
(On and on and on and on)
Come on, bring it…
Bring it
Bring it on
(On and on and on and on)
(On and on and on and on)
Don’t stop rockin’ ‘til the break of dawn - one

[Verse 2]
Poetry is drastic, hazard when it’s put on plastic
Havoc if blasted - if I get sarcastic
Your thoughts is short, mines go far past it
He didn’t wanna pass it
I took it – believe me, it’s devious
If they wanna see me it’s worse than hideous
Look – I drop another rhyme and the place gets shook
If you don’t get back, react to the hook
I hook it – highly explosive, it could blow at any time
With any rhyme, without a nine
Get out of line, too late if you wait ‘til I perform
Mics get blown out of tune, so bring it on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The crowd didn’t hear the original
When the wild first one to ever let a rhyme float down the Nile
Stomp it, comp it, flowin’, a similar style
Rhymes attack, now they want rap exile
Never – ‘cause I get militant, that’s why I’m still in it
You give me a mic and I’m killin’ it
When it drops, autops and x-rays give them heads displays
I say, ate away the microchips
Instead of yappin’ about a gun
Rappin’ about things they never done
You’re sterile, you’ll never come
I’m thorough since I came, I’m still comin’ with more
In ’94 I ain’t go on tour, I went to war
Whatever, I’ll be right here ‘til the next year
At the mic site with a bright idea
Brothers come wrong and better split, get gone
When I rip the song they get torn
Bring it on…

[Hook]

[Outro]
(On and on and on and on)
(On and on and on and on)
Bring it
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Don’t stop rockin’ ‘til the break of dawn - one
Bring it… bring it on
Bring it on…
Bring it on…
Come on, bring it…
Bring it on…
Bring it on…
Bring it on…
Come on, bring it…
Bring it!

Billy Danze: Representing 1 7 1 8, dangerously
Cousin, you know the drill
Lil Fame: Respect mine we Brooklyn bound, bound!

[Method Man]
Playing my position, hot Nixon
This one, for all the sick ones, confliction
Posionous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itching with two broke legs, now I'm tripping
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly, tap your jaw
From my punch, watch your son and you
Got you shitting in your last Huggie, running who?
Fucking punk, get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu

[Redman]
Aiyyo I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin your ex ho
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobbling
Shit I'm driving in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be taking notes
I drop like I should've invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots

(Chorus)

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Today's agenda
Got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest
If no money exchanges
I got these kids in ranges
Believe them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless
You just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go thru
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo killings clean
Slugs up in between
They eyes, like True Lies
Kill em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, yo life is on the shelf
We mean this Frank
Them cats we fucking wit put bombs in yo moms gas tank
Lets get this money baby
They shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies
And burn em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies

[Raekwon]
We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Laying on the bed, looking like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, looking at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who would've ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitching noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor

(Chorus)

[Ghostface Killah]
Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust
If he holding the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot
Up early in the morning, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'
(fuck) the brawling, cause Tony for the stalling
And all I see is $ signs, here's the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggas)
Working out, all I curl is my index finger
Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggas) respect winners
I got them big spenders coming through, hourly
Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully
Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me
You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga

[Rakim]
Its mister word renowned with the best verse
One of the illest the streets, from the east to the west, heard
Get greeted with ghetto gestures like "yessir"
A pre-meditated killer for the way I stretch words
Some of us love to flow 'til the club close
And some in love with blow for the love of dough
In it for fortune and fame, flamboyant for girls
They extorting the game, exploiting the hood
Rappers ride for bread while the gossip spread
It's only hot cause we ride, spotted cops with feds
Plus, lots of heads go Pop instead
That's the word on the block is, "Hip-Hop Is Dead"
So consumers quit copping, rappers flip-flopping
Artist pimped by they labels like a slave pick cotton
Pop Charts killing underground Hip-Hopers
While the world still looking for Ra like Bin Laden, let's go

(Chorus)

[Busta Rhymes]
In God we trust
Yo its a must that you heard of us yo we murderous
A lot of niggas is wonderin and they curious
I'm making my niggas deal with it so mysterious
Furious all of my niggas is serious
Should niggas be walkin around fearing us
Frontin nigga like you don't wanna be hearing us
Gotta listen to the radio be playing us
30 time a day shit'll make you delirious
Damagin everything all up in your areas
Yo its funny how all the chickens be always serving us
All up in between they ass where they wanna carry us
Hitcha gonna hit em off with the illiest
Varias chickens they wanna marry us
Yo its Flipmode my nigga you know we bout to bust
Settle for your money the label preparing us

[Kool G Rap]
Suckers I clobber, because my town is full of cops and robbers
You're not promised tomorrow in this Little Shop of Horrors
So I got to get with the business of hit quick
Moneygrip's pocket's looking thick so I stick Slick
Hold it right here, hands in the air, I know you got the loot
Or better yet, face down on the ground, empty your pockets troop
Hit the deck I got the Tech right on your neck
And I expect to make a buck to heck with a traveller's check
But if a vic' tries to choke me
I'll have to smoke him like I'm Smokey the Bear, so okie dokie
Goodbye, or bon voyage, have a good journey
Don't even try begging for your life, that don't concern me
So to the next weasel that freezes
Your begging and your pleases only getting your closer to meeting Jesus
Yeah, I shake a schmuck just to make a buck
Then I break a duck and if the duck gotta get bucked then I don't give a f**k

(Chorus)
Casualties of War!

Casualties of war; as I approach the barricade
Where's the enemy? Who do I invade?
Bullets of Teflon, bulletproof vest rip
Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips
Cause I got a family that waits for my return
To get back home is my main concern
I'mma get back to New York in one piece
But I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets
Sky lights up like fireworks blind me
Bullets, whistlin over my head remind me...
President Bush said attack
Flashback to Nam, I might not make it back
Missile hits the area, screams wake me up
From a war of dreams, heat up the M-16
Basic training, trained for torture
Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya
Addicted to murder, send more bodybags
They can't identify em, leave the nametags
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X)

Day divides the night and night divides the day
It's all hard work and no play
More than combat, it's far beyond that
Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack
Area's mapped out, there'll be no, Stratego
Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go
But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall?
Somebody give the President a call
But I hear warfare scream through the air
Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare
A Desert Storm: let's see who reigns supreme
Something like Monopoly: a government scheme
Go to the Army, be all you can be
Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me
So I start letting off ammunition in every direction
Allah is my only protection
But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same
And this is Asia, from where I came
I'm on the wrong side, so change the target
Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant?
Blame it on John Hardy Hawkins for bringing me to America
Now it's mass hysteria
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X)

The war is over, for now at least
Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace
It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about
Whole generation, left in doubt
Innocent families killed in the midst
It'll be more dead people after this
So I'm glad to be alive and walkin
Half of my platoon came home in coffins
Except the general, buried in the Storm
In bits and pieces no need to look for em
I played it slick and got away with it
Rigged it up so they would think they did it
Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet
When THEY call, I'm going AWOL
Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war
When I don't know who or what I'm fighting for
So I wait for terrorists to attack
Every time a truck backfires I fire back
I look for shelter when a plane is over me
Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G
Kamikaze, strapped with bombs
No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam
Did I hear gunshots, or thunder?
No time to wonder, somebody's going under
Put on my fatigues and my camoflouge
Take control, cause I'm in charge
When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor
CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X)
It's not your situation
I just need contemplation over you
Over you

I'm not so systematic
It's just that I'm an addict for your love yeah

I'm not the only one that holds ya
I never ever should have told ya
You're my only girl
(Never should have told you/me)
I'm not the only one that holds ya

Lock and key

And now for my next number I'd like to return to the

[Nas]
Classic

[Kanye West]
Uh, uh, - timeless

[Kool G Rap]
Live straight classic

[Nas]
Classic

[Kool G Rap]
Live, straight classic

[Kanye West]
Timeless

[Sample]
I'd like to return to the classic

[Rakim]
Kanye West

[Rakim Sample]
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Uh yea, is y'all ready for 20-07
It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer, why are we bugging out
Since '86 showin' the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of classic is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubting the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosigning, even non-believers
Since I came in the door became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair Air Force One sneakers
Uptowns, we call em uppies, when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One teaches
Nas made you look before the heaters
I bet you Kan' had em on when he walked with Jesus

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You can't buy this Superfly-ness
Like a shine is, your highness
Is performing, look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, til you listen to my pace
Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident
And y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic, it's gon' last forever then
I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been

[Hook]

[Nas Samples - One Love & It Ain't Hard To Tell]
Hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Nas'll rock well

[Verse 3: Nas]
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper
To them, it hurts to hear this
Oh you went platinum, yeah that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it, the car ain't important
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Leaving you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's, the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to, yeah

[Hook: Samples]

[KRS-One Sample]
"Of course - we have Blastmaster KRS-One"

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
How many of y'all got Criminal Minded
You, you, you, y'all don't be blinded
Me, I got no jewels on my neck
Why, I don't need em, I got your respect
KRS-One, twenty years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we's a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at?, c'mon where you at
This is the difference between emceeing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun
These are the lyrics of KRS-One

[Hook]
Verse 1:
No sun will shine in my day today
The high yellow moon, won't come out to play
I said darkness has covered my light, (oooh)
And has changed my day into night, (oooh)
Where is the love to be found (Where's this love to be found)
Will someone tell me because life sweet life must be somewhere to be found (Sweet life)
Instead of Concrete Jungle, (Jungle, oh, oh oh,)
Concrete Jungle, (Jungle)
Where the living is hard
Man you have to do your thing yeah. (Jungle)
Oh yeah

Scratches:
Come On

No chains around my feet but I'm not free
I know I am bound here in captivity
Ooohhhh
Never know
Never known happiness
Never known
Never known what sweet caress is
Well I'm always laughing like a clown (oh)
Still ill be laughin jus like a clown
Concrete Jungle (Jungle)
Illusions, Illusions (Concrete Jungle)
Concrete Jungle (Concrete Jungle)
Oh, no no no
Concrete Jungle

Rakim:
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (come on)
In the lions den
You hear the cry of the dying men
The lions in
Every puddle about it then
You try and win go against the blind to win
It'll put the eye of the tiger in iron men
The heart beats like animals in dark street
Starve to eat
In the jungle it's concrete
Instead of wood we use the metal to draw heat
The habitats the hood
They single the god beats
The tribals in a deadly game of survival
Genicidial
Read you Koran and your Bible
When the merciful get merciless
We need to read Psalms 82 verse 6
Its real so make you sure you do real thing
Females never forget your still queens
Feel it till you feel free with wings
And the male we ain't got to kill to be kings

Concrete Jungle (Jungle) (Come on now)
Concrete Jungle (Come on) (3x)
(sample No Doubt's "Don't Speak")

(You and me) You and me
(We used to be together) used to be
(Everyday together) everyday
(Always) always

You was there from the beginning all I had to do was to vibe
In a race against millions where the loser die
No rules apply but you was my safe haven
At the end of the race waiting so I used your guide
I found heaven in you, you shared your life with me
Gave me insight, way before the light hit me
It's more than just a bond cause we inseparable
Even when they cut the cord on the umbilical
Never more than a moment away
You fixed whatever was wrong and always know what to say
The same way to my sisters and brothers
Always honest and showed me what unconditional love is
The voice of a goddess, and stars twinkle in your eyes
My heaven on earth or an angel in disguise
If you was here, I'd just hug and kiss you
Cause a million words can't explain how much I miss you

You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always

I watched the lady shine and stay on the grind
While the world weighed heavy on a ladies mind
It was a crazy time
It's like the world stopped fast when pops passed in '89
Harder we cried the harder you cried too
My father kept your blue skies blue
It's hard to keep going, the harder you try too
At January 18th part of you died too
You tried to be stronger keep the fam together
You said we had to keep on and plan for better
While you smile with your open arms
It took awhile to die-tect your broken heart
You said it takes some time take it slow
But time will take it's toll and the stakes is high 'til the day you die
But I refused to accept eventually that I would have to say goodbye

You and me, We used to be together
Everyday together, Always
I really feel, that I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be, the end

I'm starting to see how short life is
Every second it get shorter but your heart get warmer
And you get stronger even when they said you need a transplant
And dialysis to live longer
It put us in fear, put us in tears
You still managed to live life to the fullest for years
Then things got complicated, they found a donut so they operated
A gift and a curse, it's a risk, will it work
And concerned, then things took a turn for the worse
And even if I'd seen the signs I doubt the actions
Nothing could prepare me for what was 'bout to happen
In the hospital, the 18th floor, vivid
July 18th, 2005, I can't forget it
Since that day, I'm forever numb
The end, the day I hoped would never come

You and me, We used to be together
Everyday together, Always
I really feel, that I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be, the end
Hey yo, this right here man
Is like a documentary of a gangsta, man
The rise and fall

(Hook)
How em boys gone play me, they must be crazy
Baby, oh you better pay me
How em actors gone act up, like I ain't got back up
Back up, 'fore you get smacked up (where my paper man ?)
Why they wanna play games with me
They don't know that I'm crazy
I don't know what they thinking
They must have been drinking, but look I'm that kingpin

He said slow paper is your outro, it's like spitting
Currency is all about floss, like he can't eat his cake
And he starve, when the count low
He call the lab the bakery, he all about dough
Stuffing bread his pockets is hungry
You talking nonsense unless the topic is money
He call a hundred dollars a honey
Mommy's he call em dimes
So his mind's on his money
But Mommy's is on his mind
Like an O.G. focus on the come up
Think he F'ing around he approach you with the gun up
Roll the blunt up and forget it happened
Stash the dollars, bag the product and get it cracking
He get pies, he flipping em
Tricks, he tricking em, he call em heffers
He Hugh Heffing em, he pimping em (where my money ?)
Fonzie, he getting the ones for the connects
So have the ones correct when he come to collect
But here he come

(Hook)

That sound like blood money
And I ain't just talking double dubbs club money
I'm talking drug money, move out the hood money
Double up money, you can catch a slug money
This kid will murder you, more than a business
If you live it for revenue, it's principle never personal
Get rid of you if you blocking the bigger picture
He on the block thinking of guap and getting richer
He flips some urban blue, play with them keys
For them c-notes so he can handle the whole piano
Hammers unloading ammo if his army ain't in harmony
He kill his own famo like Tony Soprano
He's trying to take it from mine and majored in grind
But the caper is mine, it's made up and die for the paper
Crime is second nature when you love cash
Doing dirty, he turn the ave. into a blood bath
Here he come

(Hook)

The heater buss that mean the reaper coming
Drug money keep em bugging not the trees he puffing
Streets is buzzing about the repercussion
But he so much in love with his bread the beef is nothing
He got metals for war just like a veteran
But now he bringing cheddar in more than he ever been
Banked up, he stepped his hustle pimp smoked cold crack
Heroin game up, american gangster
Sleep with the fish while he rather loot and
You like balling, he like stealing and shooting
Comrades, customers, competition connects
And hustlers is wishing and plotting the day of his death
What's his focus? Keys is, even when karma catching up
It's hard to set him up, he's always holding heaters
But yo, they know his weakness so they gave that bread to him
Somebody put a gun to his head, guess what he said to em

(Hook)
[Verse 1: Rakim]
I idolized my father
He taught me to survive the horror
Cause times is harder, the skies is darker
Look through the eyes of a snake, see inside the monster
To rise they divide and conquer
If it's all about money I don't respect your power, that's weak
They deprive and devour, they cowards if you ask me
Powers that be mistreat us, mislead us
Thinking eventually we gone bite the hand that feed us
We son 'em and try to keep all other from 'em
Novus ordo seclorum, E pluribus unum
New order of the ages, out of many: one
While the rest of us is conned out of pennies: none
I'm starving, it's problems if we ain't fed quickly
My breads use to be the ones taking heads with me
Jealousy, hate, lust and greed is spread quickly
Don't call me brother if you ain't breaking bread with me

[Hook: Shontelle]
Don't call me mother
Don't call me sister
Don't call me brother
Don't call me father

[Verse 2: DMX]
Don't call me brother, we ain't got the same mother
Or the same father you get down like the other
Don't speak on wisdom when you know you don't love her
Don't shake my hand when you wanna see me under
Don't talk slick behind my back
Don't walk like this when you act like that
What you trying to bark for when you let you a cat
Come to your hood like ''brrap, brrap, brrap''
Mess with the kid if you want to
Cause your mans and them to tell you
It'll be the last thing that you going through
You built like a scooter, I'm built like a Hummer
I was built like a tank; you don't want it, baby, nuh-uh
Stop playing with things that'll get you hurt
You a girl, you can't play in the dirt, you got a skirt
You don't know a damn thing about putting in the work
With your whole effing block something murked like irk

[Hook]
[Hook]
Don't sweat the technique

[Verse 1]
Let's trace the hits and check the file
Let see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass,'till mc's get weak
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep
Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a president's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits
With beats, parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped and wrecked
But researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to labs to observe them
They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens, are swords
Letters put together from a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, forged with structure
Because of my culture, I'm equipped to construct the
Technical styles that'll be full of technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then complete the
Poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old, techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new cause it's real
And in a while the style’ll have much more value
Classical, too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant. Mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
You fought and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique
[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnetize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
The rhyme will be kicking until I hit my last note
My mind remains refined, all kind of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So Eric B make 'em clap to this

[Verse 2]
I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cause to me, MC means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Say indeed and I'll proceed cause my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
His fingertips sew a rhyme until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it cause it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
Cause I'm better than the rest of them
Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim

[Verse 3]
Go get a girl and get soft and warm
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must have got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch with my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me
Yeah, you know what this is. NYC
The triumphant return (Rakim Allah)

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Remember being introduced to rapping your first rhyme
It's pivotal like a fiends first high
Hustlers first ride, players first dime
Unforgettable like a ladies first time
The world been waiting for euphoria
The true form with a sixth sense new nausea
True talk to the tomb so you forced me to go hard
Like the streets is the womb
And New York be the birth place of hip hop
Get it, it's the model where swagger was born
We set trends to follow
The home of the gods, the go-getters and my flow
Ain't a city been so prolific since Cairo
Hiero-glyphic, graffiti paint of view
Slang language too, just naming a few
Still claiming through that thing that you do
Til you famous and just love for the game and this bangers for you

[Hook: Cocoa Chanelle]
Euphoria, Euphoria natural high
Feeling good off this hip hop I supply
Time goes by, still world wide
Still top five rapping, dead or alive
Euphoria (The world been waiting for euphoria)

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I love hip hop to death, drop science like Rakim
My thoughts manifest
Yeah I'm the ghost but you can see me in the flesh
Created a father that he can see me through the test
It wasn't for rap my life will probably be a mess
Used to sell crack outside had a bad attitude
Used to scrap outside but listen to that motherfucker rap outside
You can hear me over the guns that clap outside
True warrior raps my euphoria
Only my mind can bring me this many stories up
No elevators, no escalators spit hard 'til death or respirators
This is alpha omega nigga get your data
I transform when the mic plugged in
Cause the feelings euphoric cause I spit boric

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
At the end of the day what does it all amount to
Verses too strong to be sold over the counter
Industry is like a night club and I'm a bouncer
I don't give a fuck about what you can sell and ounce for
Nah, that ain't the topic of discussion
It's the music ya'll niggas think it's knocking it's disgusting
I rather just pull it out, cock it then bust it
Feels like he plugged into a socket when you touch it
Ain't a thang for me, pain then glory
Temporary thug exchange the same story
That's why I'm still militant, still killing it
Soon as it enters the blood stream start feeling it
Then it's all good long as you know what you dealing with
Knowledge of the game that I got I'm concealing it
I'm talking to all of ya'll put the four four to ya
Kiss is a warrior, this is euphoria

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
It's like I'm dealing with spirits
And 'bout to send a ghost to get 'em
When they hear me spit I make them tremble like the dope was in 'em
Going into convulsions from the size of the weed bag
Victims is regular junkies this celebrity rehab
Respected by all of the godfathers and the new names
They got a love for my product insert it in their blue vein, okay
They on my neck when I come around like a new chain
Niggas know my rep and the dosage when I bring the new flame
Niggas all feeling the same effect, this shit is lethal
Like they was shooting the same shit, using the same needle
When I'm steady busting hollows I'm always ready to start this
You niggas is like ? the cartridge
You can see how the drug impacted the street from the responses
It saturate the planet was all apart of the process
The shit we get we take it to another place you can't ignore it
To a higher stimulation, nigga shit is so euphoric

[Hook]
[Instrumental]
[Intro]
It's the R, baby
It's the God, baby

[Verse 1]
I got rhymes I love to bust looking for a club to rush
It's like thugs will rush the illustrious
We all love to touch the voluptuous
It's a must that we lust, plus we love to crush
Women pose, from timberland's to feminine clothes
Check there portfolios and put'em in centerfolds
Pen explode, draw crowds respond re-el
I stay calm as hell surrounded by bombshells
Careful as I get near'em, stand near and compare'em
Or all girl heirem, I'm the man with the serum
Assets, probably dressed but still bear'em
It seem like they wear'em, just for me to tear'em
In quakes I see more things shake then spring break
It's like a dream state, perfect shape same date
You got a lot to give and look how hot it is, you so provocative
And it's your prerogative. Baby bounce

[Hook: Clark Kent]
Ladies, nothing but the finest ones
The lavishist ones, the ain't hard to findest ones
From the boldest to the shyest ones
Which city got the livest ones
New York, L.A., Atlanta, V.A., Miami, D.C., tell me!

[Verse 2]
Bonjour, baby here go my brochure
Give me a phone call, I'll show you the whole store

You wanna know how much the whole package go for?
My spectactale, like a festival, it's majestical, special guest for you
Ready to party hard the party's in yards to the mardygraud
Rap say on's, please give you a body massage
Rock jams, have you hot in your pants and nasty
Forbidden dance with me? Or tickle your there see
Let Ra take you on a rendez-vous
Couple of days will do if it's o.k. with you
Deserted isle style middle of winter with no bed
I'll comfort you like you were Jennifer Lopez
You get what you deserve if I said we swerve
I'll hit more than nerve and that's my every word. Baby bounce

[Hook: Clark Kent]
Ladies, nothing but the finest ones

From the boldest to the shyest ones
Which city got the livest ones

[Verse 3]
Baby you wake up the next day lingerie negligee
Give you a sex ex-ray before we catch the rays
Let's blaze a lot more games left to play
While you still amazed from yesterday's escapades
Steadily show my pedigree so thoroughly
To the b-o-n-e like chemotherapy
Sex and triple x you ready to wed next
Relax baby you need plenty of bed rest
You've been a passenger of a high speed crash with a wild style fashioner
Dark skinned ambassador, chiropractor with a passion
For smashin' your ass like a cardiovascular massacre
You've be through shock heading at your cu-wop
Body'so hot, you need a shot from your new doc
With better cures where's it sore I'll wetter more
And let it pour from her to head to her peticular's, baby bounce

[Hook: Clark Kent]
Ladies, nothing but the finest ones

Ladies, nothing but the finest ones

From the boldest to the shyest ones
Which city got the livest ones
Chi-Town, Boston

[Hook]
Ladies, nothing but the finest ones
The lavishist ones, the ain't hard to findest ones
From the boldest to the shyest ones
Which city got the livest ones
Cleveland, B-More
Ladies, nothing but the finest ones
The lavishist ones, the ain't hard to findest ones
From the boldest to the shyest ones
Which city got the livest ones
Orlando, N.O
