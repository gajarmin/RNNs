[Intro: 2Pac]
I ain't got no motherfucking friends
That's why I fucked your bitch you fat motherfucker
West Side, Bad Boy killers
You know who the realest is
We bring it too
Take money, take money

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Lil' Cesar go ask you homie how I'll leave you
Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces
Now be deceased
Little Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
So fuck peace
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride the night
Bad Boys murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get your caps peeled
You know

[Hook: 2Pac]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Who shot me, but your punks didn't finish
Now you about to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga I hit em up

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Check this out
You motherfuckers know what time it is
I don't know why I'm even on this track
You all niggas ain't even on my level
I'm going to let my little homies
Ride on you bitch-made ass Bad Boys bitches

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Get out the way, yo, get out the way, yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Moo' pass the Mac
And let me hit em in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right
For setting traps
Little accident-murderer
And I ain't never heard of you
Poisonous gats attack when I'm serving you
Spank you, shank your whole style when I gank
Guard your rank, cause I'm a slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm running through, nigga
And I'm smoking Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready-power tucked in my Guess
Under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour
I push packages every hour, I hit em up

[Hook: 2Pac]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Peep how we do it
Keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas getting killed with your mouths open
Trying to come up off of me, you in the clouds hoping
Smoking dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talking about you getting money
But it's funny to me
All you niggas living bummy
Why you fucking with me?
I'm a self-made millionaire!
Thug livin', out of prison
Pistols in the air
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
5 shots couldn't drop me: I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker I'll hit em up

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
I'm from N-E-W Jers'
Where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees
Copping pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click looting, shooting and polluting your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique moving up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
And all your fake ass East coast props
Brainstormed and locked

[Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]
You's a beat biter
A Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke. We ain't no motherfucking joke
Thug Life, niggas better be known
Be approaching in the wide open, gun smoking
No need for hoping, it's a battle lost
I got em crossed as soon as the funk is bopping off
Nigga, I hit em up!

[Outro: 2Pac]
Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressing up trying to be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob when we always on our job?
We millionaires, killing ain't fair but somebody got to do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep: you wanna fuck with us
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or something
You're fucking with me, nigga
You fuck around and catch a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that want to bring it, bring it
But we ain't singing, we bringing drama
Fuck you and your motherfucking mama
We're gonna kill all you motherfuckers
Now when I came out, I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth with a motherfucking opinion
Well this is how we gonna do this
Fuck Mobb Deep, fuck Biggie
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label and as a motherfucking crew
And if you want to be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too
Chino XL: fuck you too
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too (Take money, take money)
All of y'all mother fuckers, fuck you, die slow, motherfucker
My .44 make sure all y'all kids don't grow
You motherfuckers can't be us or see us
We motherfuckin' Thug Life-riders
Westside til we die
Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya
We'll bomb on you motherfuckers. We do our job
You think you mob? Nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob
Ain't nothing but killers and the real niggas
All you motherfuckers feel us
Our shit goes triple and 4-quadruple
You niggas laugh cause our staff got guns under they motherfuckin' belts
You know how it is, when we drop records they felt
You niggas can't feel it, we the realest
Fuck em, we Bad Boy-killers
[Intro]
Little somethin' for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corinne

[Verse 1]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares, if don't nobody else care
And, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl, keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
Cause sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy
When brothers make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up

[Refrain x2]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
It ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

[Refrain x2]

[Verse 3]
And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want 'em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to surviving friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please, you got to keep your head up
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself:
"Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?"
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
"Give the crack to the kids: who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!"
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
"It's time to fight back," that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start making changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change... and that's the way it is

[Hook: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
Cause both Black and White are smoking crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact:
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you staying in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Being real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
"I made a G today" but you made it in a sleazy way
Selling crack to the kids, "I gotta get paid!"
Well hey, but that's the way it is

[Hook: Talent]

[2Pac Talking]
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start making some changes
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do to survive

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they "can't touch this"
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Coming back after all these years
"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat!" That's the way it is

[Hook: Talent]

[2Pac]
Some things'll never change
[Intro]
Makaveli in this, Killuminati all through your body
Blows like a 12-gauge shotty, feel me
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh

[Hook]
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-lalala

[Verse 1]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggas coming for me, through my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention: bless me please Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams, in the dark, evil lurks
Enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip; never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wasting
Instutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble: we ballin'
Catch me father please, cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy I hear ya callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live but I got nothing to lose
Just me and you on a one way trip to prison
Selling drugs, we all wrapped up in this living life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doing their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thugging eternal through my heart: now Hail Mary nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kastro]
They got a APB out on my thug family
Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me: thug-living, getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs

[Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever and that mothafucka
Nasty new street slugger, my heat seeks suckers
On the regular, mashing in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, 60 seconds til the draw that's when I'm deadin' ya feet first
You've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preaching church, I gave you love, now you eating dirt
Needing work and I ain't the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond: when I was broke I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up to all my niggas: get your pay and weight up

[Bridge: Kadafi]
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate

[Hook]

[Prince Ital Joe]
We've been traveling on this weary road
Sometimes life can take a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet, Hail Mary
We won't worry, everything well curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything well curry
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty, Hail Mary

[Outro]

[2Pac Shakur]
You try to plant somethin in the conrete, y'knowhatImean?
If it GROW, and the and the rose petal got all kind of
Scratches and marks, you not gon' say, "Damn, look at
All the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete"
You gon' be like, "Damn! A rose grew from the concrete?!"
Same thing with me, y'knahmean? I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin, "Damn, he did this, he did this,"
Just be like, "DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?"
That's what they should say, y'knowhatImean?
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty
Y'knowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
I'm just tryin to make somethin..

[Nikki Giovanni]
When no one even cared
The rose it grew from concrete
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet
It came from concrete

[Spoken part]
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but, by keepin its dreams
It, learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared
No one else even cared..
The rose that grew from concrete

[Spoken part]
Did you hear..
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned to walk without having feet
Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams
It learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else, even cared

[Nikki Giovanni]
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet (to breathe the fresh air)
It came from concrete (to breathe the fresh air)
(to breathe the fresh air, to breathe the fresh air)

[2Pac Shakur]
You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its
Tenacity. We would all love it's will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses - this is the concrete - and these are
My damaged petals. Don't ask me why, thank God nigga, ask me how!
Hahahaha..
[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
17 years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

[Hook: Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" (w/ 2Pac)]
Lady, don'tcha know we love ya? (Dear mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don'tcha know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
You just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise 2 bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
[Intro]
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the nigga kingdom and shit basically, know what I'm saying? I was like, this is like a fucking election
(2Pac) It is that. Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1 - The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - 2Pac]
It's on me
But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed "thug life" and emptied the clip
Got tired of running from the police

[Outro - 2Pac]
They wanted a new regime
And my regime includes East coast
Includes West coast

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was more shocked than anything, you know what I'm saying?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him... Pac is a strong dude yo
I know dude, you know what I'm saying? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot
I was just more like, "again"
You know what I'm sayin'
He always gettin' shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm saying? But when he, when he died
I was just like, "whoa", you know what I'm saying?
Kinda took me by
I mean even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody, you know what I'm sayin'
Because there ain't no coming back from that
[Intro]
Death Row, that's where motherfuckers is endin' up

[Verse 1]
Dear Mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich
Don't wanna commit murder but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin' and talkin' behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic; I'm in this shit to win it
Cause life's a Wheel of Fortune, here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin' trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
Niggas gettin' jealous, tryin' to find my stash
Whip out the nine, now pull that dime out your ass
Peter picked a pepper but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin but swear I'm nothin nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these mics
I listened to his screams, until he went insane
I guess the little mice had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers
And fuck five-O, blaow blaow, turn 'em into forty-niners

[Hook]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me, 16 on Death Row

[Verse 2]
Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell, is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt when you're black and you're trapped in a living Hell
I shouldn't have let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin' torn
They made me an animal, can't sleep
Instead of countin sheep, niggas countin cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me (why?)
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Dear mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin every breath
I'm bitter cause I'm dyin, so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that mothafucka never cared for me
He's only here to be sure
I don't drop a dime to God 'bout the crimes he's commitin on the poor
And how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
To keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin mothafuckas
Steer clear of these Aryan mothafuckas
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin shot up
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin' for the chair

[Hook]

[Outro]
16 on Death Row
It's to all my partners in the penitentiaries
[Hook: C-Bo] (2X)
West side, it's 187 on a motherfucking hook
Niggas out of bounds should have shook
We bangin' by the book
Got shot in the neck tryin' to get away
And to a vigi it ain't nothin' but gun play

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
HEEY!
Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?
Used to love niggas, now I plug niggas
And slug niggas, am I wrong?
Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky, how many die?
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me - look bitch!
I cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
THEN! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride - on our enemies

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Nigga to catch this nigga, I'm ready to peel one
Instead of the shoulders I gotta diss toward a niggas grill some
Vigilante and villain regime niggas come with steel guns
Get ready to sleep cause you tripped when you fuck with a villain
Which one of y'all motherfuckers said fuck Tech N9ne
Shady Pacino turned C-ho when I clutched that N9ne
Me and my nigga C-Bo Yuk mezzole not only bust that rhyme
We can do it illegal so the evil'll give a fuck next time
Nigga don't you ever spit my name
And thinking that shit's the same
Two thou we switched the game and spit the flame (Wah)
"Allah hu akbar" - is what I say before I buck you
Motherfuck busters like vell Bacardi yeah nigga had enough you
Get ready to suffer - kneel down
Nigga, Tech N9ne Killer Klown
Nigga, six feet underground is where your found
Nigga, 40 water would never did a song wit you if he knew the song
Was about me never make a million
Next time say my name say my name like destiny's children - bitch

[Hook: C-Bo] (2X)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain
Nigga, time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes - when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigger nigga
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep!
Don't fuck with me!
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie
But I'll kill all'a y'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant, every motherfuckin' word
When we ride on our enemies

[Verse 4: C-Bo]
Buck these niggas, I'm a killer screamin' regime
Deep navis with heat like the A team
And when my K scream, it's causin' nothin' but murder
Bucking these niggas makin' hate me
Yeah, nigga, we don't give a fuck, nigga we thug lords
Connected from Tech N9ne and touched for the thug war
Whose got love for these niggas with no love
At all give a fuck guns clutched
Only left a ball I know you heard of me wanna murder me
Cause I'm the nigga that cooked the bird (?) in the kitchen
Moms itchin' had the whole gang unwrappin' chickens
Nigga and we was headed for the jack strapped
With a fat gat, all my niggas down to rat-tat-tat-tat
West coast bad boys we was yellin'
Now West Coast Mafia regime and thug zellin' Nigga

[Hook: C-Bo] (2X)
[Intro: 2Pac](Snoop)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
You done put two of America's most wanted in the same
Motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time
Y'all niggas about to feel this
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us aight
(A Toast to the gangsters)

[Verse 1]
[2Pac]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin' homie
You'se a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

[Snoop]
Sho' 'nuff
I keep my hand on my gun, cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin' on the outcome
Free 2Pac is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time it seems, they tryin' to take mine
So I'mma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

[2Pac]
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion
I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missing
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas living lavish

[Snoop]
I've got a pit named P, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And ... I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream's to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

[2Pac]
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these
Motherfuckin' G's
If you got it better flaunt it
Another warrant for 2 of America's most wanted

[Hook several times w/ minor variations]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfucking gangsta party

[Verse 2]
[2Pac]
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me, I bust and flee
"These niggas must be crazy, what?"
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

[Snoop]
It's like Cuz/Blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you about life and about the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

[2Pac]
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floating in the black Benz, trying to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm trying to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

[Hook]
[Intro: Biggie Smalls]

Ready nigga? Ready for that raw dog shit nigga?
Okay,Alright
Let me see how im gonna hit you with
You wanna set it off?

[Verse 1: 2pac]

I'm scared to do some freestyle
Flow
I'm too high
And I might go of tempo
But now I'm back to let these niggas know just how
Deep
My game run
2Pacalypse don't sleep
I keep a motherfucking Glock in my car if I'm holding in the club
I gotta be the fucking star
So everybody wanna smile, and raise they hands
I got a razor, case I gotta
Do a necks (next) man
Cause you know how niggas be
They wanna see if Pac is real
Or is he like that nigga in the movie
I guess I gotta prove my point
Slicin' motherfuckers now I'm doing the joint
I got my nigga B-I to the G beside me
Bitches on my dick you know the hoes wanna ride me
And my other homies out here like Spike Lee
They got the camera on a nigga guess they like me
But now I'm bout to pass this motherfucker on
Cause this Tanqueray is getting hella strong

[Verse 2: Biggie Smalls]

Uh,Uh
Money, hoes and clothes blunt smoke coming out
The nose is all a nigga knows, flippin' on foes, puttin' tags on toes
Watchin' the stash grow, clockin the cash flow, the neighborhood grave digger
Gettin' paid so much all the bitches wanna see a nigga,I guessed they figured im
Paid i wanna get laid or since i got loot i wanna knock boots,huh, i rather beat
My dick then trick and if she dont suck then we dont fuck huh, I rather lick a buck drive a
Fatass truck grab the nine two clips and run them up,yes, flex out the 2 or 3 benz's since i
Wreck shit,what the fuck do you expect it, a fly guy, well fuck it imma' high guy from bed-stuy
Puttin' the swellin' on your eye and your nose even, when I choke ya you stop breathin'
And when police come, I'm leavin'
[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
17 years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

[Hook: Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" (w/ 2Pac)]
Lady, don'tcha know we love ya? (Dear mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don'tcha know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
You just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise 2 bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Big Lock!

This is for the hustlaaaas, ohh
This is for the hustlaaaas, come on
This is for the hustlaaaas, ohh
Ohh, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I make money like a motherfucker
It ain't no thang to me
$hort Dog in the house spittin game with Breed
Ain't no bust partner, that's the third week
I'm going to pimp these hoes, they can't work me
How the hell you think I get to ride a B-12?
The phone and TV ended with a green smell
I went from Oakland to Atlanta with my top down
$hort Dog, my shit is nation wide now
You can ask Breed or Pac it don't stop
I ain't bull shittin make a mill when I rock
Three players in the game and it's a major
Bitch you wanna get me better hit me on my pager
Today I'm on the westcoast
Tommorrow I'm in Texas
Flip the Benz and Farri, sold the Lexus
$horty drop the bass in the mix
You know what's next bitch
I'm sure to get rich

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Haha
I'd be the thuggin ass outlaw
Til my fuckin casket drops
Fuck around and make me blast on these bastard cops
This is for the hustlaaaaas
Believe me coming stapped with the gat
When you see me
Label me a threat to society, but I ain't quitin
Thug life motherfucker ain't no bull shittin
Born in these projects destined to fate
Collecting mail on these broke bitches
Slanging that game
Now shit done changed
It ain't the the same
I ain't lyin niggas are dyin
Three strikes have you motherfuckers flyin
In the penatentary or in the cemetary
Gettin high no need to worry
Last year niggas knockin up the block and in between shots
Pumpin tapes from that nigga Breed and Pac
This year bringin you the fix
Including Ant Banks in the mix
We're sure to get rich
Still I ride

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Breed]

I'm a cold-hearted fool
I mean a fool at heart, head strong
And I won't be headed home if he falls apart
Conatact niggas like a part time
When I ride the beat
Ain't no way to hide from the darkside
Man of many mens till the very end
And blend in and change my iden
Just to mix up with the game
They know me by the Breed and they don't know it's my last name
It's mind over matter
I don't mind, you don't matter
Pull a Glock and watch the whole block scatter
And we can have us a gat to gat talk
Do it old style and do a back to back walk
Count to ten and say goodbye to your friends
And we can put the bull shit to an end
I figure if he plays around he lays around
And he's a motherfucker goner, call a corner when I'm around
Bodies are buried and found all around
And parish and charish and thoughts just to be true
Punk, fellas behave ya and it just might save ya
So guard your girl and pickup your pistol
Cause you can't get wit Breed the weed head lyrical nit wit
The shit won't change as long as I'm alive
I gotta survive and keep it tight

[Hook]
[Verse One: 2Pac]

My Mossberg goes boom, gimme room, can I catch it
Talkin quick and then I vic just tryin to keep from gettin blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Boo-yaa! Turned a snitch into a casket
Now they after me, prowling for a niggas bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck buck, big up and livin reckless
Niggas with a death wish step in with a Tec and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
True to what I'm writing, representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm what's mine
Some niggas need to feel me with a passion
I'm old fashioned, run up on me, nigga, and get blasted
With five deadly venomz

(Yeah 'Pac, fuck that, still hittin em up with
That old deadly shit. Aiyyo Treach where you at?
Step up and hit they ass up with the wickedness.)

[Verse Two: Treach]

We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
To the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like skunk blunts
Stunk like funk cunt
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin mother out
And that's the street scarred style
I shout, "I'm de MC wit de nasty mouf!" and kick the bitch out
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin shit
Pickin pockets with a razor stoppin Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin shop
Once you sound hot, cause if you ain't a perfect ten
My sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin styles in em
Like women I did em I'm in for deadly ready venom

[Verse Three: Live Squad]

Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Mad
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin em down, I make em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Rob and steal and runnin from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make 'em scatter, leavin trails of brains and bladders
Blowin em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, somethin that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit em, I lit him
He's out! A poison, a deadly venom

(Yeah Mad, fuck that! You know how we do
KnowhatI'msayin? Squad in effect, YG'z in effect
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent)

[Verse Four: Live Squad]

Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggas can't touch me when I wreckin G you better flee
Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uhh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking all fake niggas back to the stomping grounds
Line em up single file, dome runnin in em
A nigga hit em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom

(Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin? Fuck that!
I told you, we takin over, yo 'Pac.)

[Verse Five: 2Pac]

Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggas don't even worry me, see
I got a Glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops cause my gauge gets me... PAID
As I sit and reminisce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggas need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I passed let the glass spray.
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now your mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin blunts
Deadly venomz

(Hahaha, yeah pass that shit over here
Apache bout to clean shit up.)

[Verse Six: Apache]

Throw up your middle finger! Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'mma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin trigger
I'm a cinch in a clinch, your punch is like a pinch.
Test the rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Fuckin up pooh-butts, cut em like cold cuts
Choke em with my boot lace, then leave em hangin like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get em
That's the results of fuckin with the fifth venom in denim

(Yeah, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Five motherfuckin deadly venomz, in effect for ninety-three
Ninety-four ninety-five all that other shit
We takin this motherfucker over this larger hit
YaknowhatI'msayin? Follow us, come along. Yaknowhat I'msayin?
We takin this motherfucker over. TRUST. We out.)
[Intro: 2pac]
Where the fuck do these niggas live where all this shit be goin' down?
You want to know how I did this shit? You want to know how real my shit is?
Nigga, go read the mothafuckin' newspaper, you trick-ass nigga

[Verse 1: 2pac]
How many broke-down rappers got some shit to say?
I sit and strategize, in due time, them bitches pay
Plus all day, I puff weed till my eyes bleed red
Undercover tactics, leave my enemies dead
Check this, I know you niggas got no love for me
But how the fuck your whole clique turn to thugs, homie?
Like misdemeanors, it's a small thang
You niggas ain't ready for war, let my balls hang
Bust it, I took apart your whole crew, lack heart, I ain't concerned
I bust at Bad Boy, Mobb Deep and murder The Firm
When you scream "Fake thugs," who the fuck you mean?
Get more cream than all of y'all, nigga, fuck your team
Now Dre want to switch sides, tricks hide in war
Last year, I shed tears, but I don't cry no more
Plus Jay-Z tried to play me, won't last long
Go ask King Sun how it feel to have your ass gone
Listen Doo-Wop, don't get your shit knocked, you can't win
Tell 'em all to let the games begin, we havin' war games

Yeah nigga, y'all niggas can't fade this shit
Got shot 5 times, got out of jail on bail
And sold 5 million

[Hook: 2pac]
I'm a self-made millionaire!
Thug livin', out of prison
Pistols in the air
(Background while Chorus:
Sold more records then all you trick muthafuckaz put together
More then the Firm, more then Bad Boy, murder Mobb Deep)
5 shots couldn't drop me: I took it and smiled (3x)
(3rd time parallel:) Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my A-K, I'm still the thug that you love to hate (love to hate, love to hate)

[Verse 2:]

[? 4 different Rappers, but not 2Pac]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2pac]
First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Little Ceasar go ask you homie how I'll leave you
Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces
Now be deceased
Little Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
So fuck peace
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
So let the Westside ride the night
Bad Boys murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get your caps peeled
You know

[Hook]

[Outro: 2pac]

(Ray Tyson)
Postal border was makin' me mad
So I get up in my cruiser, broke out of the pad
Rolled to the West Side to check out my boys
Twenty brothers in the park, all bringin' the noise
Stepped out the car, Levi's saggin'
Gold around my neck with my limb-walk laggin'
Walked up on my boys with the old E chillin'
The box with the big beats and my boys started illin'
A hoop game started so I jump in
Had the hoods' toughest team so I just had to win
Diz to the outside, 2Pac up the center
A ten minute game and we were the winners
The boys started smackin', talkin' that slack and
Till he see my posse and the suckers started backin'
Tried to say we cheat, because he got beat
Another lightweight sucker that can handle defeat
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's just a day in the life

(2Pac)
Finally I'm on vacation and school is through
So here I am, on Monday mornin' with nothin' to do
Tried to get outta my bed, but I can't move
Ya see I'm stuck to my matress like crazy glue
So there I lay, for half the day just thinkin'
Got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'
But I was all alone so it wasn't no thing
Got up to take a shower and heard the phone ring
Picked it up, the salutations, little bit frustrations
Who could be disturbin' me on my vacation?
Speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' tone
Now I know what Michael meant by leave me alone
So I'm askin' who is it? and the answer shocks me
It was the voice of my homeboy Roc-T
Him and Dizzy had been waitin' for me
Had a show at three and now I'm late as can be
Said I have to take a shower, I'll go ahead and take it
If I leave within the hour, I still might make it
I'm rollin' in a sweatsuit, wasn't tryin' to get cute
Hopped on to the stage and said: "Sorry that I kept you"
I started rappin', girls started clappin'
Couldn't wait to finish so I could start mackin'
Jumped off stage, picked up the girl for the night
Huh, that's how I'm livin', a day in the life, come on
A day in the life

(Ray Tyson)
Stretch white limo hits the colessium
A crowd full of people sayin: "I can't wait to see him"
Who is in the limo, who are they talkin' about?
Strictly Dope in the house, hear to turn the party out
We get out the car and can barely stand
Cause everywhere I look are screamin' fans
Girls on my tip but I really don't sweat 'em
They'll tear my new clothes if your bodygurad'll let 'em
Hit backstage with two minutes to spare
Just enough time to grip a breath of fresh air
We hear the introduction, the audience is loud
I stepped out on the stage and then I moved the crowd
Winners all over, we tried to leave the scene
But there's a whole crowd of people at the limousine
Pen and paper in my face, I couldn't be mean
So I was signin' autographs at the age of seventeen
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's a day in the life

Kick it, kick it, kick it

(2Pac)
Coolin' with my posse at the neighborhood disco
Talkin' to a cutie as I'm sippin' on my cisco
Askin' me to dance but I keep on sayin' "No"
Hate to dance fast, I only like to do it slow
Dizzy's on the dance floor, funky, funky motion
Girl keeps on sweatin' me with sexual kind of totions
Roc is signin' autographs makin' girlies dizzy
Crowd sweatin' Strictly Dope cause we're gettin' busy
Suckers wanna battle us, we move in silence
Strictly Dope is positive, we're tryin' to stop the violence
Started feel tipsy, I'm lookin' for the door
The Cisco had me dizzy, I stumbled to the floor
And more I try to sit up, the less I seem to get up
My stomach starts to turn and my head feels wit' up
The room begins to spin, I pass out for the night
Just another way of livin' a day in the life, kick it

(Ray Tyson & 2Pac)
Knew I was a genius, soon as you seen this
Avoid ho's value, don't have to redeem this
Teenage terror, no room for error
A girl start dissin', and I SCARE HER!!
Risin' like inflation on your favorite station
Rap is my forte and my recreation
Girls wanna kiss me, suckers wanna diss me
My mother didn't want me to be, but I'ma emcee
The ladies desire, emcees admire
That's why many hate me and call me liar
Hoods of the hype-tip, girls on the ill-trip
I'm through rockin' this whack, so that's it
I am the high type, my style is so right
It's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life
[Intro]
One love, one thug, one nation
Twenty-one gun salute
I'm hoping my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, getting blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke

[Verse 1]
Twenty-one gun salute, dressed in fatigue, black jeans and boots
Disappeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas thinks he live like me
Talking bout he left the hospital took five like me
You living fantasies, nigga I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed them out
Next time grown folks talk, nigga close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy lets be honest you a punk or you will see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me being a thug
You can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with Macs, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas looking like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Trying to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known this is how you made me
Loving how I got you niggas crazy

[Hook 1]
Against all odds
Hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, getting blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke, against all odds
Hoping my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote

[Verse 2]
I heard he was light skinned, stocky with a Haitian accent
Jewellery, fast cars and he's known for flashing (What's his name???)
Listen while I take you back (NIGGA SAY HIS NAME!) and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was working for the FED's, same crime, different trials
Nigga, picture what he said, and did I mention
Promised a payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listening, The World Is Mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch, play the game nigga
All out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga, "Why you lie?"
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots too Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga this M-O-B
So believe me we enemies, I go against all odds

[Hook 2]
I'm hoping my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, getting blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I'm hoping my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds

[Verse 3]
Puffy getting robbed like a bitch, to hide that fact
He did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we riding for that
And that nigga that was down for me, resting dead
Switch sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathing or dead
Lord listen to me
God don't like ugly, It Was Written
(ey yo Nas) Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard My Melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life, so what's a Hausa Nas?
Niggas that don't rhyme right, you've seen too many movies
Load em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die, goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me nigga

[Hook 1]

[Outro]
Against all odds
Twenty-one gun salute
One love to my true thug niggas (Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
Twenty-one gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
Representing to the fullest being soldiers with military minds
That play the rules of the game, twenty-one gun salute
I salute you my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you bitch made niggas, I'm coming for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is, nigga
You touch me I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers think that I forgot
Hell no I ain't forgot nigga
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war unless I got my money behind me
Aight, I got my money right here, now I want war
[2Pac] They say

[Intro/Hook]
[B-Legit] Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
[C-Bo] Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich] And niggas call me a timer
[2Pac] I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
[E-40] Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[2Pac] That's right, that's right boy start that shit off

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watching for thievin' I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin a bullet in motherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
I got my locs on hard hat goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin' on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, 2Pac and the Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

[B-Legit]
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find

[D-Shot]
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'

[Hook]

[2Pac] C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
[E-40] Da Bay, beitch!

[Verse 3: E-40]
Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the trauma plate
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him

[Richie Rich]
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double-edgin' for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleeding and you needing
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

[2Pac] Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo] The whole clickilation fool
[E-4]) Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch

[2Pac] Why them niggas acting like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at? It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?
[C-Bo] Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
[E-40] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[2Pac] Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some hurricane
[E-40] A motherfucker's gonna get his Marlboro's regardless playa
[2Pac] You supposed to
Sideways to the next light...
[Reporter]
Good Evening
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
[crowd starts chanting 2Pac]
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of 2Pac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by 2Pac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

[Crowd]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...
[Intro]
[2Pac] Ahh yeah!
[Down] Yeauhh!
[2Pac] It's all about you, one time!
[Down] I'mma say it's all about you baby, yeah!
[2Pac] Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you - it's all about you!
[Down] This Dru Down in the house, with my boy 'Pizznac, youknowhatimsayin'?
[2Pac] It's all about you
[Down] Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you, but you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauhh

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause
Addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true, what I'm sayin', boo
Is this is all about you

[Hook: Nate Dogg] (x2)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you, yeah nigga

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]

[Hussein Fatal]
Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo, I gets down like Dru
And my nasty new niggas, too

[Yaki Kadafi]
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

[Hussein Fatal]
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

[Hook] (x4)

[Outro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean ... god damn, youknowhatimsayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin'?
And then, yaknahmsayin', what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video
I mean - damn - everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real
Yeah
[Intro: 2Pac speaking]
Big Syke, Newt, Hank
Beugard, Big Sur
Y'all know how this shit go
All eyes on me
Motherfuckin' O.G
Roll up in the club and shit, is that right
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
But you know what?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
So many playa hatin' niggas tryin' to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin'
Well are you still down nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die; live the life of a boss playa
Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh Benz flauntin' flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin jealous, and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got foe niggas, and low riders, in ski masks
Screamin' THUG LIFE every time they pass - all eyes on me

[Hook: 2Pac (x2)]
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
(All eyes on me)

[Verse 2: Syke]
Heeyyy, to my nigga 'Pac
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tech
Devoted to servin' this, Moet and pay checks
Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin'
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin' I been there, came back as lonely homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay
My little homie G, can't you see, I'm bust a free
Niggas can't stand me - all eyes on me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive, will I die, come on let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money, motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it
All eyes on me

[Hook]

[Outro: 2Pac speaking]
Pay attention my niggas
See how that shit go
Nigga, walk up in this, motherfucker
And it be like, bing
Cops, bitches, everymotherfuckingbody
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
I got bustas, hoes and police watchin' a nigga, y'know
I live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Livin' life as a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
Hehehe ... it's like what they think
I'm walkin' around with some Ki's in my pocket or somethin'
They think I'm goin' back to jail, they really on that dope
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa
I know y'all watchin', I know y'all got me in the scopes
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
I know y'all know this is THUG LIFE baayy-bay
Y'all got me under surveillance, huh
All eyes on me, but I'm knowin'

[Kastro & Napoleon]
We goin all out (aiiiite)
We goin all out (aiiiite)
We goin all out, watch ya motherfuckin mouth niggas
(That's right, fuck these fag niggas)
Do it, do it, do it

[2Pac]
Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brand as my strap
Back like a cobra, I stay drunk, cause I'm a mad man
Whenever sober, on a one man mission
My ambition's to hold up the rap game
While I pluck holes in niggas like donuts
And still down to die for all my souljas
Like hillbillies, they don't fear me
So refuse bringin' war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of dirty niggas, who all got me
While bitches wonderin' who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin' sluggs like Muammar Gadaffi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper, bustin caps to Jay-Z
(buck buck buck buck buck buck)
And still avoid capture, while y'all caught up in the rapture
Still after me, I'm in Jamaica sippin' daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin' nothin', then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug-nigga, that my old man wasn't
I came to a field, catchin' cases, litigation
Niggas playa-hatin', got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin DEATH ROW, throw my WESTSIDE, ain't no thang
We was raised off drive-by's, brought up to bang
We claim mob, M.O.B. if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this, I'm hard to kill, when I peel with this live spot
Father, how the hell did I survive, these five shots?
Live it up, or give it up, and my demons
Late night, hear them screamin; we goin' all out!

[Hook: EDI]
We goin all out, bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle ya own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga go all out
Bustas playin with ya peeps, betta go all out
Try'na see the next day, nigga go all out
Obstacles in ya way, you better go all out

[Napoleon]
I'm on my land sled, walkin through the belly of the beast
Feelin like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, that we mobb niggas hidin' in bushes
Claimin that they ride rough, but they soft as they cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers, I'd die for these thuggs
Say hi to this slug, it's a shame how some niggas on the west coast
Was ridin with Pac, but when he died, they went pop
I'm on the Jers to the fullest, like some west coast love
But after Pac stopped rappin, it ain't no west coast thug
Just westcoast what? To my real niggas stuck in the street game
Cause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin Kool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what I'm sayin? Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo-fo put peek holes through your door
I ride or die, but these other fag niggas be bitin this
It's all from my heart when I was writin this
All out

[Hook]

[Kastro]
Now, we all ride, and down to die who wit us
Speak up, or get treated like you comin to kill us
Ain't nothin but squealers, in this rap game, swearin they rough
Tattooed up, and now them niggas swearin they Pac
Stop that, and watch ya back, we ain't forgot bout cha
These Glocks hot, and when shot, it'll bring the bitch up out cha
It's me, Kastro with the goattee
Walkin' like a OG, cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
I pray to the thug lord, like that motherfuckers holy
Frontline soulja, till the heavens call me
I go all out, and if you real, you real
Feel what I'm talkin' bout, cause this game is ill
I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'till they feel it
Livin' proof, Pac breed niggas, they can't deal wit'
Holla back, right back, and watch ya mouth
Or get blood in it, WHAT, we goin' all out
Nigga

[Hook] - 2X

Fool, you better go all out
Keep goin' all out
All my niggas goin' all out
Without a muthafuckin' doubt

[EDI talking]
Ey, you niggas just gon think that you gon be uhh
Talkin and slippin on all of these motherfuckin records
And we ain't gon say shit, now it's 1999
It's a different grind, don't disrespect the Don
It's still war motherfuckers
So let's see you act like you know
ALONE
Lying, thinking
Last night
How to find my soul a home
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone
I came up with one thing
And I don't believe I'm wrong
That nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.

Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
There are some millionaires
With money
they can't use
Their wives run round like banshees
Their children sing the blues
They've got expensive doctors
To cure their hearts of stone.
But nobody
No, nobody
Can make it out here alone.

Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.

Now if you listen closely
I'll tell you what I know
Storm clouds are gathering
The wind is gonna blow
The race of man is suffering
And I can hear the moan,
'Cause nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.

Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
