[Produced by Thelonious Martin, co-produced by DDot Omen & A$AP Rocky]

[Sample]
Gotta find my way back home, I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home, I'm moving...

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
War Lords, we all Lords, but we your Lords
Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim, raw dogs
You other niggas mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mad salt, 'til I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr. Miyagi in Issey Miyake
Asshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home

[Hook]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi
Roll through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it
On plenty, any foe or a -BEEP-
That ever voted against me, dissed me
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated all of the wrong that they did me
You stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of
Means more from my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies
Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis
Bitches been sniffing
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
How in the fuck could you front on em
My old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends
Bronson told me not to eat ham, rest in peace Yams

[Break: A$AP Rocky]
Rest in peace Yams, RIP A$AP Yamborghini
We gon' take it uptown one time
We gon' take em back home, show em how me do
They call me Pretty Flacko ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to introduce Pretty Flacko Sr
Yasiin Bey

[Verse 3: Yasiin Bey]
Magnum spectacular, black man megalas
Shine amethyst, fly champion, it's like that again
What's happening? Mathematics master blin'
Flacko season, all day, erryday
Ask me how it's going, I tell em on and on and on and on and
You led me out to Arizona
Steady flowing, staying golden
Sand cover, ready rover
Flacko glowing in that Owens, that's how it's going
Awareness to the areas, familiar with the routes
Travellin' man, moving through places, space and time
In a country called earth

[Outro: A$AP Yams]
Nah'mean, these tacky ass muh'fuckers be in the pictures. Wearing all types of mother fuckin' red and green stripes, over accessorizing out this mother fucker. We from Harlem, we gave y'all mother fucker this wave. Grab y'all surfboards, cause y'all got your boogy boards right now, fucker. Ya'll just gon' keep watching us at the beach show with your mother fuckin' khakis rolled up. With your chancletas in your hand and we just gon' keep surfing on this mother fucker. Straight up. It's ya' boy, A$AP Yams, Yamborghini. Yo Rock man, let these mother fuckers know what it is out this mother fucker. A$AP, bitch!
[Intro]
Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha!
You know the deal: it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, negroes and latinos
And even the gringos

[Verse 1]
Yo, check it
One for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forthcoming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell, 8 Million Stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keep in orbit with the probable tenth
The universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide project-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor: better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the "cha-pow!" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got, 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets like
69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki
A 5-minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right: "You Are Not Alone"
Rock your hardhat, black, cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This new math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
It's mathematics

[Hook]
"The Mighty Mos Def" "it's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"  "I revolve around science.."
"What are we talking about here?"
"Do your math"
"1, 2, 3, 4"
"What are we talking about here?"

[Verse 2]
It's one universal law but 2 sides to every story
3 strikes and you be in for life, mandatory
4 MC's murdered in the last 4 years
I ain't trying to be the fifth one, the millennium is here
Yo it's 6 Million Ways to Die, from the 7 deadly thrills
8-year olds getting found with 9mils
It's 10 P.M., where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill pumping krill to keep they belly filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M
The white unemployment rate? It's nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still living
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business: no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your zip code to S-S-I digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for "who is" and "who ain't niggas"
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it: it's all mathematics
[Hook]
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

[Intro]
Man, duke I was in love with this girl, duke
I was tore up dog, I'm telling you man
Shit is wild man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

[Verse 1]
In she came with the same type game
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!
What's your name love, where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, "Yo, I'm leaving now"
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up, shaking, winding her waist up
Scene 2: my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
"Ayo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce"
I turned around (Say word!) it was the same pretty bird
Who I had priorly observed trying to play me for the herb
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feeling? "Oh, I'm fine" My name is Mos "I'm Sharice"
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sitting directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh, yeah, you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, "How you gon' leave before you dance with me?"

[Hook]

[Interlude]
She blew my whole head with that duke, I was like, word?
I played it low though, I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell ya
Yo, honey was so blazing she was just
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother man
She was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor
And she start whispering to me and shit

[Verse 2]
"Yo, let me apologize for the other night
I know it wasn't right, but baby you know what it's like
Some brothers don't be coming right, I understand, I'm feeling you
Besides, can I have a dance ain't really that original"
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, "Honey, let's exchange numbers"
Scene 3: weeks of dating late night conversation
In the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Isaacs
Like, "If I don't, if I don't have you"
Showing me her tan line and her tattoo
Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., come now, I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rocking the P-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever
Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really trying to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ahh, damn it, my shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up
What!?
I got a feeling there's gonna be a riot

I don't read the newspapers because they all have ugly prints

Check me out, Check me out

Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on cause there's gonna be some shit tonight!

[Verse 1]
At the starting of the week
At summit talks you'll hear them speak
It's only Monday
Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

(come come come come come with it)
(come come come come come with it)

[Verse 2]
You could be sitting taking lunch
The news will hit you like a punch
It's only Tuesday (what time is it?)
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fool's Day (what time is it?)

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

[Interlude: Yasiin Bey]
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another....bomb, bomb, etc

Fire!
Shot!
Escalation
Devastation
Generation
Separation
Situation
Dissipation
Shot!
Another shot another shot the tender vessel pressure pop
The heart is cold the gun is hot(shot)
I'm not sure if they done or not
I'm not sure that they wanna stop
The gun is cold the blood is hot(shot)
(shot shot shot shot shot shot shot)
The hearts are weak the guns are not

[Verse 3]
You hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday (what time is it?)
You feel the shaking of the ground
A million candles burn around
Is it your birthday? (what time is it?)

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
(get tomorrow on the phone, trying to reach tomorrow, get tomorrow on the phone)
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
(I need to see tomorrow, trying to reach tomorrow)
Think tomorrow's come I think it's too late

Another day!

Bomb, bomb, etc

(tomorrow is another day)
(tomorrow is another day)

Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on cause there's gonna be some shit tonight!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Two words, Chi-town, South Side, worldwide
Cause I rep that 'til I fuckin' die
One neck two chains, one waist two gats
One wall twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight, Blueprint five mics
Go Getters rhyme like, should've been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated
Barbershop playa-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words, Chi-town raised me crazy
So I live by two words: "fuck you, pay me"
Screamin' "Jesus save me"
You know how the game be
I can't let 'em change me
Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God, it's the same me
And I basically know now
We get racially profiled
'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom so the top's
The only place to go now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Two words, free way, two letters, AR
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Joyner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car, my God
Two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
Free, young boss, freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs
To brawl, forget ya squad, better fend for yourself
Have you screamin' out four words, "send for the law", uh
Two words, Freeway slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad

[Outro: Mos Def (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)]
Red, white, blue, black (Throw your hands up)
Calm down, move back
Motherfuckers askin' "who is that?"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Driving around town looking for the best spot
For the drunk and hot girls
Up in the club look at here what we got

Stop talking 'bout your boyfriend since he is not me
Stop running up my tab cause these drinks is not free
You drunk and hot girl

Please don't throw up in the car, we almost crashed
Oh, now you sober, how'd I know you'd say that
You drunk and hot girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
Love the dangerous necessity that people seek
Without regard to where they are
The human heart is curious
Above all things, love, the lights are low, your eyes are bright
The music plays, it's sweet delight
It's out of sight, I'm feeling right
Your dress is tight
Oh howwwwww, I want you right now

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Don't tell me, you sing, you about to get a deal
You drunk and hot girl
"Ah da da da da." That's how the fuck you sound
You drunk and hot girl, yeah
You only live once, do whatever you like
I thought I'd be with you for only one night
Now I'm with this girl for the rest of my life
That drunk and hot girl

[Outro: Kanye West and Mos Def]
We go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

[Intro]
If I say surely the darkness shall fall on me
Even the night shall be light about me
Indeed the darkness shall not hide from you
But the night shines as the day
The darkness and the light are both alike unto you
Amen

Thou preparest a table before me
In the presence of mine enemies
Thou anointest my head with oil
My cup runnneth over
Amen

Run

[Verse 1: Yasiin Bey]
Pure pedigree horse power
Balley at the summer buffalo soldier hour
Black and blue dawn in the shadow lands
Dub cry high-noon make the shadows dance
Preacher man say a prayer, bless the caravan
Bandolero clans and jackels in the valley pass
Mindset on the treasures and the talisman
Hand set on the holy book and battle axe
Sun, moon, and stars, built a map
Where you at
Frontier
Clear
Expansion, exodus, run
Frontier
Clear
Exodus, expansion (run)

[Hook: Lucy Liu]
They die by dawn
They die by dawn
They die by dawn
They die by dawn
They die by dawn
They die by dawn

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
My grandmother told me
Never ever go to sleep in the church house
Wear a shirt and a tie to the court house
Look the judge in the eye like a man
Not a dove, not a lamb, not a slave, or a church mouse
You a king, you a god, you a holy El
Get out this hole and give these motherfuckers holy hell
So over time, I perfected my rhymes and
That's why I shine like I climbed out the Holy Grail
Mainstream dropout, white widow cotton mouth
Out in Queen's Park with a crew of dirty stopouts
London bridge is falling down
The Bullitts lickin' shots on the Parliament grounds
Every devil, every scoundrel, every henchmen, every hound
Get lassoed by the sound
Ran across the desert, then shackled to the mound

[Hook: Lucy Liu]
[Intro: Mos Def talking]
A lot of people wonder...a lot of speculation goin' on about...who's in control. Who is God? Who's on top of this thing? Am I God? Is God in me? Well I got the answer. Let 'em know. 'Bout to give it to y'all. Let 'em know oh oh. It goes like this

[Hook]
God make the world get up and move
God make the world go round
God make the moon rise high
God make the sun [?] Allah, a ha ha
We are, we are, the grand groove, grand groove
God make the world get up and move
God Allah make world the get up and move
Allah make the world, God make the world

[Verse One]
Yo check
All praise due to the merciful and beneficent
Sovereign universal dominate black element
That's the space, ancient like Sanskrit
Even though man made transmit my transcripts
And they can't be tamped with
Allah protect this
I make jams for crime clans and working class fams
And all y'all mans who eat aci with chams
And heads in the flats who dispatch the dollar vans
Young kids in badlands with great escape plans
Who eat most of they meals outta boxes and cans
Casualties and cutbacks of social programs
Dedicated
To all those who rode slave ships
Who screamed and cried but survived the ride
I know that my life is better cause you weathered the tide
Harder work on this side making truth magnify
Devils can't stop me, but they damn sure try
Shine the light on the Earth that receive and radiate
Ain't no surface I've seen that's too dense to penetrate
There are plans by many hands to make us deviate
So I speak on plates so that all good life regenerate
Baby ain't no time to deliberate
He put the wonder in the world let's activate
Let's activate, let's activate, let's activate
Cause

[Hook]

[Verse Two]

You know I ain't gotta lie to you
God made the world get up and move
You know I ain't gotta lie to you
God Allah made the world get up it's true
You know I ain't gotta lie to you
God made the world get up and move
You know I ain't gotta lie to you
God Allah made the world get up it's true
Yes you know I ain't gotta lie to you
God Allah made the world, Allah made it all
Allah made the world, Allah made it all
Allah made the world, Allah makes it all
Allah made the world, Allah controls it all
Allah makes the world, Allah controls it all
Allah made the world, Allah controls it all
[Intro]
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Oh this takes me home
It makes me think about sitting outside of my old home when I was younger and singing something like

(K'Naan in Somali)
Gabaryaray shuxaano
Maro Shabeel eh xirato
Maro qafiif eh huwato
Magacaaga ii sheeg
Magacayga waa Sharaf
Sharaf, Xaaji weyaan
Aqalada xiriirta
Dhinac baa ka jooga
Ala yaa usheega?
Tinta ushaleeya?
Naa hoéy Zamzamey
Sabaax nuurey
Adoo kilkiley
Iyo
Kaloon badanay
Adoo xajka jira
Xasuus badhanay!
Saxiibtaa
Caasho, cashaq baa dhilay
Ugu dhambaystina
Aniga iyo geel uba
Ugu banaan bixin
Waa aniga orodneey
Nabad dheynee
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
[Repeat x2]

[Verse 1: K'Naan]
There are certain things fresh and certain things mish
I got my own sound I don't sound like the rest
And even my attire and my choice of dress
And not long ago I don't spoke English
My point is police pull me over a lot
They wonder what kind of rap sheet I got
And sometimes I take a young girl out to eat
And hold the door open, "Oh, you're so sweet!"
Of course my affection's super illustrated
And I like to give don't reciprocate it
Unless you could give me someone innovated
Well lets cook it up we dont refrigerate it
But back to the country of the educated
Where people get robbed and they celebrate it

Waa aniga orodneey
Nabad dheynee!
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
[Repeat x2]

[Verse 2: Mos Def]
Maraken, my country 'tis of thee
Sweet land for robberies
Dope smoke and SUV’s, red meat and army greens
Fat and frills, thrills and spills
Eat and sleep, hump and kill
Shop til you drop, work til you dead
Get all you can, then get in the wind
Outta my face on your knees
Sleep in the mansion, shut out the streets
Make that cake, whoop that trick
Lick my swagger suck my sick
Get high get low get stcky get rich
Get yo own show get down get quick
You slow you blow you broke your fix
Terror dome, home swag home
Terror dome, home swag home
Home swag home, home swag home

(Somalian(America))

[Verse 3- Chali 2na]
There are some things pure while certain things blur
Dilute it with the lie and you believe when it occur
Falsified information got my people in the stir
We have to be in search of something equal to the cure
Straight out the door, I come to give you more
Lay the law keep it raw, when I speak it from the core
Get underneath your skin like especially with the claw
Conflicted with the rich cuz I kick it with the poor
I laugh in the face of adversity
Sound clashed with the bass cuz its natural to me
But if you pay attention to the past you will see
Not long ago you black they'd hang your ass from a tree
Certain things things change, while some stay the same
Some are recluse others are lovers of the game
I'm trying to walk the lane, the Sirat al-Mustaqim
Instead of doing things they keep you covered in the flame

(Somali)
Nanananana that shit was cool in English, but let me get that Somali verse
(Somali)

(Somali until fade out)
An Open Letter From Mos Def
By Mos Def
February 1999

An Open letter From Mos Def...
Diallo was a West African immigrant with no prior criminal record who was shot and killed by police in the dark of night for simply being black. He was unarmed and shot at 41 times! No unarmed man should be shot at even once! One of the police officers involved in the Diallo shooting was involved in the killing of Patrick Bailey no more than a year and a half ago! Tyesha Miller was shot in her car in Los Angeles while she had a seizure! I could go on and on with the names of black people who have been killed at the hands of police just this year. But the list is so long that it would turn this letter into a statistic sheet.

Most of the people that got killed by police this year and in the past have probably been some of your fans; fans of some of your favorite artists. They are black people who love us, who defend us, who protect us, who put us in our comfortable homes an dour luxury sports utility vehicles and our well kept hotels suites and our oversized tour buses. They're the people that buy our records, our t-shirts, our concert tickets, and so on, and so forth. They're the same people that are getting murdered, harassed, maimed, and beaten in streets all over the world everyday!

The only people in our community who have not responded to this incident are us. Hip-Hop made one hundred billion dollars last year!... A lot of those dollars came from the 'Comptoms', the 'Brooklyns', the 'Crown Heights', the 'Chicagos', the Detroit ghettos, the St. Louis ghettos... the same ghettos where police run around literally hunting black folks to murder... then cruise the streets shortly thereafter with impunity and arrogance.

We are the Senators and the Congressmen of our communities. We come from communities that don't have nobody to speak for them. That's why they love us. Because we talk about what nobody else will talk about. We represent them. And they need to know that we really represent them. Not when it's just a romantic notion or a paycheck attached to it. When something happens to them it matters to us, because when something happens to them it's happening to us. Because Amadou Diallo is your brother, your cousin, your man... Tyesha Miller is your sister, your aunt, your girl, your wife, your daughter... All of these people are you! You are no different! And just because we're at the top of the Billboard charts, seen on MTV daily, livin' comfortably doesn't mean that we can't get shot, we can't be harassed, we can't be maimed and mistreated.

I hope this is as important to you as it is to me cause when I pass by the projects and when I pass by the hood I don't see nobody but me. I see everybody who looks like me. I see me many years ago as I'm sure many of you do. So it's time for us to come together from the 'jiggy' to the 'hardcore'; from the 'backpacker' to the man with the Lexus and really unite and show the world that we got strength. Show the world who we are. Represent who we are. Who we really are and where we really come from. Let's show people where our heart is... that we haven't forgotten.

Now I'm askin' you and anybody who looks on this letter to come forward and show your heart, to show your love, to love the people who love you back by speaking out against the injustices that they suffer. Because believe me, if the clock was turned backwards we'd be those same people.

Please stay mindful of this. Please be considerate of this letter. Pass it around! Talk about this! Think about it! Keep it on your mind because if you don't... it's going to keep its mind on you.

I wanna thank everybody for taking time out to read this letter. I hope I didn't take up too much of your time. All of the contact information and other information you need to know is enclosed.

I want to wish everybody, each and everyone of ya'll peace, prosperity and love.

Peace,
Mos Def
[88 Keys]
Yo, this is 88
This is for Amadou Diallo
Rest in peace, you still here

[Fre]
Yo, I'm in a brownstone singin like Brownstone
Bird's eye view of the bodega
No Omega like Rakim
Thinkin about brother Diallo
I find it hard to swallow
Cause 41 is a hard act to follow
Who is it, it can happen tomorrow
Goes down all the time in some African community
This one just hit closer to home
Cause it happened in our backyard
This that *shit* bring us closer to home
They ask "What you writin fo'? What you writin on that paper fo'?"
Don't ask me nothing, just tell me
Who Howard Safir got it safer for, that's why my raps sour
My peoples screamin "Black power!" and "La Raza!"
From the Bronx, police bustin, it's redemption time

[J-Live]
Now on the squad car, CPR's supposed to be the motto
But in they minds, they be like "Yo, I'ma do Diallo"
I guess master's noose was a bitter pill to swallow
Cause nowadays, tips ain't the only things that's hollow
Constitution, 41 more holes in it
And cops swingin sticks like they tryin to win the pennant
And stickin sticks places where they ashamed to admit it
But that's the straw that broke the camel's back
THEY GON' GET IT!!

[Rubix]
Possessed by a nervous twitch and itchy writing finger
41 strokes through the barrel of pen for Amadou
More than a few of my personal friends
Since the beginning, it seems like it never ends
The story, ancient as biblical allegory and it's all gory
The Little Shop of City Hall Horrors
Who bakes infiltrate, agent, provocateur mission statement
Assassinate the Senate candidate, heavenly mandate

[Hook: Mos Def]
We proceeded on a country road
His mother's eyes withered swoll
Her child was never comin home
Said a prayer for his soul
As the coffin had closed, committed to the earth below
First seed she had sewn, would be a tree never grown
Shade that was never known
Who controls the Terrordome, the men with hearts made of stone
Who love only what they own

[Invincible]
Stay on your toes for a troop whose description match
Blue suits, walkin round wit a stick and...
Ready to blast with the wrath of a hollow tip
And the fact is my taxes are scholarship
I feel it in my chest cavity
The only death's apathy, so I change it for who's next after me
And that's the fullest reward
Keep the face of the lost on my bulletin board

[Wordsworth]
Yo yo, it's blue uniform, sirens, names, and badge numbers
Clubs, walkie-talkies, recipes for bad summers
Frisked, pissed after I tuck in my stuff
I really think they just like touchin my *nuts*
What's real stain they thoughts
Swear, but they won't say it in court
All they do is change the report
Riots, tryin to keep the crowd in control
They even got shows, Cops, LAPD, Highway Patrol yo yo

[A.L.]
From the cradle to the grave, they made you a slave
Brainwashed to kill each other, that's the plague that they made
I search em like readin scripts that could save you today
White is right, black is wrong, that's the label they gave
Fryin in hell, applyin jails, they got you dyin in cells
Triple six in the mix, Levine to ?spell?
Prepare for the worst, and try to hope for the best
I take a stare at the hearse, can we cope wit the stress?

[Kofi Taha]
See I live in the land of plungers
Illegal chokeholds and excessive gunshots
Where there's one millionaire for every million empty pot
And Adolf Guili think we static but he's in for a shock
They come wit automatics but we flip it
Use the one, create the four Glocks and while stocks get washed
While school doors get locked and when jobs get blocked
The confi-dence get's rock
And when the welfare's drop into the jails we stock now
After Amadou wrestlin wit freedom tacks my mind into a headlock
But *fuck* H&R, I'm a true cat
Refundin power back to our Blocks

[Hook]

[Tame One]
Good life, you can bubble or struggle
But use your brain muscle if you hustle
Don't let nobody touch you
Don't even trust the ones that trust you
Cause the ones you showin love to might bust you
Seekin as a cancer, my man got shot by Haitians or Jamaicans
Confrontations and school my mind's racin
I pride these sensations over this, now I'm hopin this
We shine for, I never got a chance to rhyme for
My role models sold bottles and stole cars
And when they got locked, I accepted all the phone calls
That's when *niggas* was real
Back before I had a deal
Back when people called Villsburg Hooterville
ILL!!!

[Jane Doe]
My mind wonders on melodic jams
An exotic bird, caged with the rage and the violence of my words
The same things I down I turn around and do
The white cops say nigga, but I say nigga too
Truth be told we hypocrites
In a materialistic society, spirituality shunned or
While young kinds get gunned on
Hibernatin in projects, which you project-ing
The pigs is crucifyin but Africans is resurrectin, Jane Doe

[Grafh]
Pataki, sending cops to come and catch me
He better send a running back to run a track meet
When I'm running through the back streets
The rat teeth of beast loving the black meat
Eatin brothers like our pigment color is that sweet
To lock a man up in prison, the standard of living
Thinking they make a better brand of man
Than the man when he went in
Rub up a man for sinnin
Handcuff his hands to the system, banned from his wisdom
With insanity in him, his mind roams like a cyclone
Damagin victim, his eyes hold savage within him
Wrath with the venom, poison his life
No ointment to boisten the might
If it's on the left, walk to the right
Until death, do your part through your life
Like a boyfriend and wife, because the day times shorter than night
You know?

[Hook]

[88 Keys]
Yo, black is fragile remember that
Cherish everyday
Live life to the fullest, aight?
[Verse 1: Mos Def]
The way I feel, sometimes it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face but it's really no joke
You feel it in the streets, people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down their focus
The focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes you don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep
And it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral of a shell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Soul is the lions roar, voice is the siren
I swing round, ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckas trying to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well

[Hook]
What it is, you know, they know
What it is, we know, y'all know
What it is, Ecstatic, there it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is

And always on time and rockin ya mind

[Verse 2: Slick Rick]
Sit and come relax, riddle off the mac
It's the patch, I'm a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well say about noonish, comin' out the whip
And lookin at me curious, a young Iraqi kid
Carrying laundry, "What's wrong G? Hungry?"
"No, gimme my oil or get [fuck] out my country"
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff
'til his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, feeling like I've pissed upon wound
I'm like, "Surely hope that we can fix our differences soon!" Bye!
Buying apples I'm breakin' on
You take everything, why not just take the damn food, black monster? Like I don't understand it, on another planet
15 month of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasing the sentiment, gentlemen
Getting down on their middle eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crowd
Walk over kicked one of my fabulous raps (la dee da dee)
Arab jaw drop, they well wish, they glad rap
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad

[Sample]
Omar: Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries
Ali: They sent you?
Omar: Yeah, so? Here

[Hook]
[Produced by Thelonious Martin, co-produced by DDot Omen & A$AP Rocky]

[Sample]
Gotta find my way back home, I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home, I'm moving...

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
War Lords, we all Lords, but we your Lords
Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim, raw dogs
You other niggas mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mad salt, 'til I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr. Miyagi in Issey Miyake
Asshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home

[Hook]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi
Roll through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it
On plenty, any foe or a -BEEP-
That ever voted against me, dissed me
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated all of the wrong that they did me
You stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of
Means more from my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies
Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis
Bitches been sniffing
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
How in the fuck could you front on em
My old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends
Bronson told me not to eat ham, rest in peace Yams

[Break: A$AP Rocky]
Rest in peace Yams, RIP A$AP Yamborghini
We gon' take it uptown one time
We gon' take em back home, show em how me do
They call me Pretty Flacko ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to introduce Pretty Flacko Sr
Yasiin Bey

[Verse 3: Yasiin Bey]
Magnum spectacular, black man megalas
Shine amethyst, fly champion, it's like that again
What's happening? Mathematics master blin'
Flacko season, all day, erryday
Ask me how it's going, I tell em on and on and on and on and
You led me out to Arizona
Steady flowing, staying golden
Sand cover, ready rover
Flacko glowing in that Owens, that's how it's going
Awareness to the areas, familiar with the routes
Travellin' man, moving through places, space and time
In a country called earth

[Outro: A$AP Yams]
Nah'mean, these tacky ass muh'fuckers be in the pictures. Wearing all types of mother fuckin' red and green stripes, over accessorizing out this mother fucker. We from Harlem, we gave y'all mother fucker this wave. Grab y'all surfboards, cause y'all got your boogy boards right now, fucker. Ya'll just gon' keep watching us at the beach show with your mother fuckin' khakis rolled up. With your chancletas in your hand and we just gon' keep surfing on this mother fucker. Straight up. It's ya' boy, A$AP Yams, Yamborghini. Yo Rock man, let these mother fuckers know what it is out this mother fucker. A$AP, bitch!
[Intro: Mad Skillz (Mr. Eon)]
Yeah
What it look like?
Mad Skillz
Mr. Eon (the mighty Mos Def)
Mighty Mos (the E.C. Rawkus connection)
Coast to coast (from '88 to '99)
What what what what

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
It's on fire tonight
Everything on my side is looking alright
It's the high power original, b-boy traditional
Raw bass material, Brooklyn individual
True brand imperial you're hearing on your stereo
Transcribe the live, the Mos Def initial
Sit back and listen, you ain't in no position
To deal with my conditional mentally and physical
Strength is indivisible, crews be coming pitiful
Speech be sound typical, downfall habitual
Ock, I'm not feeling you!
Don't know what your label telling you
Or what magic beans they selling you
I can flow, you can't though, example
Of a cat who just a modern day Sambo (yeah)
Who be bitching out to A&R demands so
You can collect your little petty cash advance ho
You knock-kneed and sloppy, but not me
I'm I-N-D, E-P-E, N-D-E-N-T

[Hook: Mos Def singing]
It was a jam at the center and the party was shaking
And the poppers was popping and the breakers was breaking
And it won't be long til everybody know that
B-boys rock the document

[Verse 2: Mad Skillz]
Yo, yo, you on the injured, I'm hot to death
I'm foul, plus I'm winning, you think I shot the ref?
Rock a vest if you out of tone speaking
Cause I'm right there like nightmares, I catch MC's while they sleeping
I'm back, these rap cats is wilding
Got em in the studio poppin valiums, remastering they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game
Put your head in the toilet and look son
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't rocking raw, what you rocking for?
Without heat, y'all MC's ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats trying to put your hit out
Try rocking back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mr. Eon]
I'm Jedi Master, Mace Windu, what you been through
Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Badu
Hip-Hop's Cleon Jones, when Eon Jones
Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claiming they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown when I kidnapped Snoopy
Eon, sale or performance, in any ordinance
Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leaving any pimp whoreless
Stereo stomping
Defeating me is like Latrell choking up John Thompson
Charles Bronson had a Death Wish for this next to left shit
Leaving all these hot air MC's breathless

[Hook]

[Mos Def]
I said b-boys rock the document (..ument ..ument *echoes*)

* DJ scratches "b-boy, document" *
[Mos Def] (Isley Brothers)
And ya know

My name Black Dante
I cannot resist when you pass my way
Your name Beauty In The Dark
I'm staring through the fog trying to find where you are
You got to take my hand
You got to at least give me this one chance

I'm smelling your hair and feeling on your charms
Baby please come close
Don't let me go
Baby hold me tight

All night long (so long)
And know they're playing this song

Gangsta [6x]
[Verse]
Beef is not what Jay said to Nas
Beef is when the working folks can't find jobs
So they trying to find niggas to rob
Trying to find bigger guns so they can finish the job
Beef is when the crack babies can't find moms
Cause they in a pine box, or locked behind bars
Beef ain't the summer jam for Hot 9-7
Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic
Beef don't come with a radio edit
Beef is when the judge is callin' you defendant
Beef: It come with a long jail sentence
Handed down to you in a few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for a visit
To tell you that she pregnant, by some other nigga
Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit
Need a loan for your home but you're too broke to get it
And all your little kids is doing is getting bigger
You're trying not to raise 'em around these wild niggas
Beef is when a gold digger got your seed in her
A manicure handout like, "Pay me nigga!"
Or I'm telling your wife
Or starting up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life
Beef is when a gangsta ain't doing it right
And other gangstas is deciding what to do with his life
Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic
Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight
Beef is what Ja said to 50
But beef is all my homies not being here with me
When a soldier ends his life with his own gun
Beef is trying to figure out what to tell his son
Beef is oil prices and geopolitics
Beef is Iraq, the West Bank and Gaza Strip
Some beef is big and some beef is small
But what ya'll call beef is not beef at all
Beef is real life happening every day
And it's realer than them songs you gave to Kayslay
This has been a real niggas P.S.A
From Mos Def pretty flaco
Black Dante
And the Black Star Embassy B to the K!
[Verse 1: Mos Def]
For sinners, saints and scramblers and gamblers
And dirty money handlers, dignitaries and champions, narcotic traffickers
Talented number runners and racketeers
Stars of stage, page and cameras, slang swingers and swaggerers
Double barrels and Derringers, automatics and miracles
Europe Asia and Africa, all the time in America
Atlantic, Ashland, Alblemarle to Albany
Bridge into Baltic, Bedford Ave, Bergen Street
Clinton to Cadman, Church Ave to Clarendon
Road to Central Avenue, Cooper House, Cypress
And live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest high flyingest pilot bombardier from Pyrrhus
Stationed live and direct, Medina mastermind set
Ya can't lock my set now lock off, cool
Peace to the nation of the Gods and the Earths
And the Sun, Moon & Stars, furthermore born knowledge go hard

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Remix, rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
Strainin' to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowin' I'm sowin' them seeds
Let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said it I mean it
And did it because I need it
Eat sleep it and bleed it
Write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement
Your trash talk is deleted
Blastoff, I lay them out like a Tempurpedic
Black Thought, I told you I'ma win eventually
This unsung, underrated, under appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated from something that's so hated
To one of the most sacred, nobody gonna take it
Face it, I keep doing it well
Doin' it sans assistance
Is do it yourself, doin' it below the radar
We doin' it stealth, doing it again
For Illadelph and who else? But check it out
Y'all see him on a job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
I'm like Martin Luther King you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear Diary, my fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now like here's Johnny
Swimming with them great whites now is where you'll find me
Funny how it break right down but never mind me
I'm forever grimy, guess it's just Philly shining
Rock rolla bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Like a dope fiend opening up a bottle of dopamine
You're just hoping you don't get roped for your throat get choked anything
Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding
I hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs with a switch
And stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
My dick is so big, if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it
I'm not a baller but you can bet your fuckin' bottom dollar
That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet
Now watch me kill a koala while I maul a chihuahua
Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holler at you, mama
It's like I'm off the bombom when I bring the fuckin' drama
Used to bomb ya like Saddam but now that I'm a little calmer
I'm a fuckin' cross between Osama, Dahmer, Obama, and Dalai Lama
So Miley I'm a knight in shining armor
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer a picture
Of my genitalia with a note saying "bitch, I can't wait to nail ya"
Drug paraphernalia beware the werewolf will kill ya
That's him in the sheep's clothes; he just shaved his hair off Cecilia
Yasiin Yasiin Yasiin
Top 40 Un-rah! (Underdog)

Bey
Soft shoulder, imported cotton, single button
I ain't gotta talk loud to be sayin' somethin'
They doin' them, I'm doin' this
I'm too legit... Why would I quit?
They brains in they ass, what they talkin' with
You can smell it on they breath, they just talkin' shit
Get a tic-tac and get back

Scared of who? Not at all, not nobody here
Not nobody comin', not nobody there
Trill, therefore movin' on
The simple shit don't move me move along

[Intro/Chorus: De La + Mos Def]
Now this goes out to all area cliques
Centralized or way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the De La in the mix
Just like log cabin syrup our sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area cliques
From manicured lawns to projects bricks / from 718 to the 51-6
Remember to keep the Mos Def in the mix
Straight butter hits, drop as a good as it gets now

[Verse One: Mos Def, Dove, Posdonus]
Now, come on y'all, get live get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So don't none of y'all just be misled
The De La's gonna do the body good like wheat bread

Shakin laces out of shoes, Mos Def brought the brews
Sittin indian squats to make that bread tie knots
See I'm out to get the coin like in them rainbow pots
Swingin life like a hammock, invested like stocks

Through your sinus complex, I aims to clog it up
Slappin fives with pain is a crew here to gain
We remain on your mind like skulls
Not a dull moment shown
When in the house all perimeters are blown

Native Tongue come through to make you say yes yes
This is the mighty Mos Def style fresh like baby breath

We are the killer combination with the size to administer
The beatdown to swell up all three of your eyes

[Chorus]
Now this goes out to all area cliques
Centralized or way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the De La in the mix
Just like log cabin syrup our sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area cliques
From manicured lawns to project bricks
Remember to keep the Native Tongue in the mix
Straight butter hits, we as good as it gets

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop
(repeat 2X)

[Verse Two: Mos Def, Posdonus, Dove]
I don't bug out I chill, don't be actin ill
No tricks in ninety-six, Native Tongue gon build
But we be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cause to me, MC mean, makin' cream
When I speak on groups and I'm smooth like gabardine
Tryin to hang out with Dove and catch love in Aberdeen (word up)
I bag dimes like my man born on August 17
Life be nuttin but a river son I'm swimmin upstream

Playin wait up, with the data servin your ears
With information due to confirmation of the nation's most
Wicked ways of livin, like them glassy eyed beans
Inhale the smoke of fiends, while bangin the tape
Rated at the high point of the mass
Rippin MC's at the top of a class, occasionally
Rippin some sucker's face
Or some suckable ass from a girl
It's a big brother beat for the wide wide world

I'm makin memos off these demos back in eighty-nine
Took you all on encounters of an unknown kind (right)
Did the hustle with a couple of us, but soon noted
That my niggas buttered Benedict rolls, and then voted
I wrote in the dark so I could feel it like braille (uh-huh)
Heard the big brother beat, got locked with no bail
Came to set it like equators invented, with the heat
Yo Mos Def how you radiate to make it complete

RIGHT *echoes*, so when I shine the light crabs wince
Manifestin for the future here in the present tense
No doubt, I love the sound biggin out off your Jeeps
Son I want the little kids bangin big brother beats

[Chorus]
Now this goes out to all area cliques
Centralized or way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the Native Tongues in the mix
Just like log cabin syrup our sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area cliques
From 718 to 516
Remember to keep the De La in the mix
We straight butter hits, we straight butter hits

We straight butter hits, we straight butter hits
Manteca, manteca
(repeat 3X)
Word up
[Intro: Mos Def]
Man you hear this bullshit they be talking
Every day, man
It's like these motherfuckers is just like professional liars
You know what I'm sayin
It's wild
Listen

[Hook x2: Mos Def]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I pledge no allegiance
Nigga, fuck the President's speeches
I'm baptized by America and covered in leeches
The dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features
Drowning you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers
And if you speak about the evil that the government does
The Patriot Act will track you to the type of your blood
They try to frame you
And say you was trying sell drugs
And throw a federal indictment on niggas to show you love
This shit is run by fake Christians
Fake politicians
Look at they mansions
Then look at the conditions you live in
All they talk about is terrorism on television
They tell you to listen
But they don't really tell you they mission
They funded Al-Qaeda and now they blame the Muslim religion
Even though Bin Laden was a CIA tactician
They gave him billions of dollars and they funded his purpose
Fahrenheit 9/11
That's just scratching the surface

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam
But that's bullshit
I'll show you why it's totally wrong
Cuz if another country invaded the hood tonight
It'd be warfare through Harlem
And Washington Heights
I wouldn't be fighting for Bush or White America's dream
I'd be fighting for my people's survival and self-esteem
I wouldn't fight for racist churches from the South, my nigga
I'd be fighting to keep the occupation out, my nigga
You ever clock someone who talk shit, or look at you wrong
Imagine if they shot at you
And was raping your moms
And of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit
After Ronald Reagan's election
Mercenary contractors fighting a new era
Corporate military banking off the war on terror
They controlling the ghetto with the fear of attack
Tryna distract the fact that they engineering the crack
So I'm strapped like Lee Malvo holding a sniper rifle
These bullets will touch your kids and I don't mean like Michael
Your body be sent to the morgue
Stripped down and recycled
I fire on house niggas that support you and like you
Cuz innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily
This ain't no alien conspiracy theory
This shit is real
Written on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal

[Eminem]
I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President dead
It's never been said but I set precedents)

[Hook - Mos Def]

[Eminem]
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Let the choir sing

Everywhere we go
People wanna know
Who we are
So we tell them

Yasiin Bey from BK
Fresh from NOLA

[Hook]
Hallelujah
Sweet Black Jesus
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Halle-Holla
Hallelujah the prophet Black Jesus

[Verse 1]
A big beat with a bass
Arrangement each piece in its place
BK, NOLA, The Boogieman and The Go DJ
Good God, a yes y'all
I work it out, make it run, lift it off
Fly. I'm like a dove from up above
And when I rock they say, "That's my one!"
"That's my one!" Yeah "That's my one!"
"That's my one!", "That's my one!"
"That's my one!", I turn it up bump it up
And when it feel good to you it's good for real
And when it's real baby that's how it's how it's supposed to feel
Testify

[Hook]

Experiment:
Black radio
Experiment, black radio

[Yasiin Bey]
Radio, sucka never play me
Triple shade of black that my bleach should never fade me
They say he crazy
New York raised him in the 80s
Kill the Koch administration
Gangster renovation
Born in isolation-ation
Ill communication-ation

Ma Bell fiber optic
Presidential miscroscopic
Soul sonic remedy
Clinic right in the street
Operating in the dark
Surgery your wounded heart
Come together peel apart
Peel apart come together
Smoking on something good
Praying for something better
From out of better
Never rocking for forever ever
Ever ever ever ever
Forever ever ever ever

It's still a secret even when you tell em dumb dummies
Hush money, rent receipt and drug money
They cold gutter, want gun money
The chief rocker, fuel-injected Zulu horse proper, love boogie

You so black and bright
You so bright you black
Shining you crying to fight them back

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah [repeat]
[Kanye West]
It’s like I wanna spit something written
But keep forgetting
So I guess it’s from the heart from the start
Played my part
Seemed like I just wasn’t reaching the charts
5000 hours, rewritting Power
Over and over
Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual
So unusual to be in this position
Everything I say everybody tryna diss ‘em
Everybody playin him, truth be told
The last nigga ever let the truth be told
And oh Mos Def ran to my home
And said they gon have yo ass gone
Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks
Can't even take the piss
They gon’ test your urine
Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!
“Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?”
I dont know, ask, ask Hennesy (thats Coca-Cola)
Say ‘he ain't clean enough’
But rappers ain't mean enough?
Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough
On the real, this is like the neo-Emmitt Till
Whistling, get yo fuckin' ass killed
Lets keep this shit real!
Now who the realest
Everybody feel this
And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites
Cause I said what's right
I go to sleep and deal wit it every night
And wake up every morning
And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa whats worser?
Its no verse that would reverse the-
In print or in cursive
They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane
Let's have a ‘toast for the douche bags’
Black people wanna talk about me on blogs
Cause I like clothes like, 'look at this fag'
Thats what I have to deal wit real shit
Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man
A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin’ my part
And all this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't ‘Jesus Walks’
For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears
They playin’ wit niggas careers
Felt like I’m the only real nigga here
From my last breath
They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left
Then they even sent Beyonce up to give the Award back
Didn’t even know I afford that
And she rode the wave as I rode the slave
As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave
Nigga behave, nigga behave
Be the first one
I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin’ and stay frontin’
And get up and just perform, Shit is enormous
Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit ’bout
My whole family, now I’m scared of Grammy’s
Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history
So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded
Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be impor-ted
Uh, it’s too real for these niggas, you feel for these niggas
How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand
Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya

[Mos Def]
No matter what goes on
They may not agree, they may not understand
But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand
And his hand and that hand
And ideas, and all of theres
And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere
So make it clear, live long and prosper
Much success, even if you wish me the opposite
To quote Nas, I stay on my job
Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm
And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me
My life is real even when I’m in the movies
I’m on the ave, I’m in the cave
I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago
My life is real, as it ever been
To all my friends and even foes
Each and every one of those, let em know
I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart
Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position
Feel blessed to make the whole World listen
And just glisten without even trying
Even when I die, I won't stay dead
And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs
Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young
And I’m straight from the slums
And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum…
This thing ups, let us all give some
Number one yo, I’m number none, no comparision
And make the whole world aware of it
Brooklyn in the building we take care of it
Peace out to all the Sagittarius
And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too
And this go out to all area crew
And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me
From the present, and the past and the future and beyond
Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on
[Intro - Mos Def]
Alright y'all, slow down, I'm trying to
Aight, yo, I only took a little bit of Spanish, you gotta
Aight I hear what you're saying but yo, alright, okay
Alright okay, alright okay, okay
Alright okay, I'm feelin you, okay

[Hook]
All my people in Brooklyn and you know we're hot, I say:
We don't stop the Body Rock
All my people in Queens, and the land in between, say we:
Don't stop the Body Rock
Shaolin and L-I, say you know we're fly, say we
Don't stop the Body Rock
From the East to the West, son, we take it to the chest say we
Don't stop the Body Rock

[Verse 1 - Mos Def]
Check me out y'all
I'm in the lab with Ab, I got the pen and pad
My man T-A-S-H take it to yo' breastplate
It's the Mighty Mos Def, complete the trilogy
Just shot myself a dime, see are you feeling me?
Son I'm wicked and nice when I'm on facility
Let me take a sec to review what I wrote
.. "Mos Def and does it sound far fetched?" OK it's dope
Let's record this ('cord this) they gonna award this (award this)
And all area crew is gonna applaud this {*clapping*}
And when we step to the plate Pah it's flawless
My man T-A-S-H with styles glory great
Great, great great, great great

[Tash]
Up next we got CaTash with that West coast rhyming
Bombing niggas with the style as dangerous as mountain climbing
Cause the Alkie words I'm spitting be twisting while you listening
Plus I'm in this motherfucker with the Likwit coalition
That'll leave you in position, twisted backwards like yoga
While you staring down my throat like, "Is he drunk or is he sober?"
Who knows?! All I know is Tash got flows
And got the technique to get the ladies out of they clothes
I been overly exposed to the forty-oh's and chickens
So I'mma keep it pumping til the beat stop kicking
Or til the plot thickens, cause this is how we do
CaTashtrophe, Mos Def, and the brother man Q!

[Q-Tip]
What's up Tash, hey yo, Tip can't call it
Sure as Mos is Def and you Alkaholik
I'mma be surfing at, thing that's worth dealing
Hypodermically, shoot up your feeling
Figuratively speaking, of course, now
Old and greediness seeking it's course now
What we gonna do? Eradicate them
Shoot them from the jam, they be diseased phlegm

[Mos Def]
Tash Love... are you ready to rock the mic?
Q-Tip... are you ready to rock the mic!
Mos Def... are you ready to rock the mic?
We got the universal style that you got to like!
And ain't nobody steppin up when we got the mic
So turn the A.C. up cause it's hot tonight!
And til the bright early morn' we be rockin you all
Don't stop, the Body Rock!

[Tash]
Cause I'm next to flex, and I'm technically advanced
To turn you on like cybersex, so in less than two sec's
I blind MC's like Thomas Dolby with the Science that'll leave
They braincells fryin slowly (FIRE!) so slowly I flow and
Express written consent, from the undergroundin niggas
Coast II Coast I represent cause gettin bent, I do
But I'm doper than sherm plus the way I put it down
Could burn the perm off Big Worm, so peep this private screening
Of the Last Action Hero that be freezin rappers dead in they tracks
Like Sub Zero (Zero), cause Rico ain't no joke
I eat yo' flows and yo' beat up rappers even feel my presence
When I'm home with my feet up

[Mos Def]
Yo what you skied up or treed up?
Relax and pull a seat up, make your landlord turn the heat up
Got the opposition shook like Tiger Woods about to tee up
So niggas no competition with the clear Mos Definition
MC's screamin now for years can't rhyme without they mom's permission
You just a young'un comin out, gettin gassed to run your mouth
Wildin on the Runabout, Baby Pah you comin out
Barkin that you want a bout but son you know the comeabout
When Mos Def blow up and, you don't, nuttin
Don't you know nuttin? My crew go huntin
We keep it on the norm then we transform som'in
And while, we do it, you bounce to it
The cops wanna stop the Body Rock but don't do it

[Q-Tip]
DY-NO-MITE!!! Like Jimmy J.J
Slobbed down pen-ny, somewhere in L.A. (A)
Now we got to bond like Voltron (tron)
Tash you the bomb, Mos you the won ton (ton)
Q will pick the lead, I must drop on thee (thee)
A-B-S, I bust down, facility (ty)
T-R-A-C-T is the MC (cee)
It's the LL, inside the place to be (be)

[Mos Def]
Tash Love... are you ready to rock the mic?
Q-Tip... are you ready to rock the mic!
Mos Def... are you ready to rock the mic?
We got the universal brothers that you got to like!
Now ain't nobody steppin up when we got the mic
So turn your A.C. up cause it's hot tonight!
And til the bright early morn' we'll be rockin you all
Don't stop, the Body Rock!

All my people out in Queens that know you're hot, you say
Don't stop, the Body Rock!
All my people out in Brooklyn and you know we're hot, say
Don't stop, the Body Rock!
Shaolin to L-I and you know we're fly, said

All the people on the Greens and the land in between said
Don't stop, the Body Rock!
