[Intro: Grace]
You don't own me
You don't own me

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Woah, let's go
But I'm Gerald and I can always have just what I want
She's that baddest I would love to flaunt
Take her shopping, you know Yves Saint Laurent
But nope, she ain't with it though
All because she got her own dough
Boss bossed if you don't know
She could never ever be a broke ho

[Verse 2: Grace]
You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

[Chorus: Grace]
And don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

[Verse 3: Grace]
You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down cause I'd never stay

[Chorus: Grace]
And don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

[Verse 4: G-Eazy]
Really though, honestly
I get bored of basic bitches
She's the baddest, straight up vicious, texting her asking her
If shes alone and if she'd sent some pictures, she said no (what)
Well goddamn, she said come over and see it for yourself
Never asking for your help, independent woman
She ain't for the shelf
No, she's the one
Smoke with her till the weed is gone
Stayin' up until we see the sun
Baddest ever, I swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done
Never borrow, she ain't ever loan
Thats when she told me she ain't ever ever ever gonna be on

[Verse 5: Grace]
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please
[Intro: G-Eazy]
You know if I say something I mean it
These things happen
Yeah

[Hook: Remo]
If I ever said I'm never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know I mean it
You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
If I say that shit then I mean it
She calls me, I screen it, I'm only fuckin' if it's convenient
You lie on pussy, that's weak shit
We pass pussy 'round, that's G shit
But you ain't fam so what is this "we" shit?
You cuff yours and then leash it
Listen, I'm tellin' you, it's my world, I does what I wish to
If you're mad well too bad, sounds like a personal issue
I walk in, they all stare like "Who the fuck is this dude?"
Kicks game is just rude, don't get jiu-jitsued
Tunnel visions how I get ahead, stayed solid I never fled
My haters feel like I'm better dead
But I'm quite alive getting bread instead
With a better girl, with a better face
I'm in a better place gettin' better head
"I just wanna stay broke forever,"
Yeah that's that shit no one ever said

[Hook: Remo]
If I ever said I'm never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know I mean it
You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Signed Gerald, I'm sincere
This year I'm in here, I'll spell it out to make things clear
Meanwhile your end's near, I've got a lane and I'm in gear
You people wonder who's next up
That conversation really ends here
You rappers just talk a bunch, stress me out, I chop a dutch
Weak rappers tryna bite the sound, but my style is a lot to munch
I'm more like whiskey neat, and you're more like vodka punch
G’s dope, he might blow up, think I know, I've got a hunch
On my side it's authentic, you try to stunt but it's all rented
But you're dope you got a bad chick, yeah, cool bro we all get it
She wears a ring, came through without it
You really think she stay true? I doubt it
Cause I'm fucking your girlfriend, and there's nothing you can do about it

[Hook: Remo]
If I ever said I'm never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know I mean it
You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
[Intro]
Just made a way
I can't complain, I'm doing fine, 
No games to play
I came to say whats on my mind

[Hook: Pell] x2
Who you know got it like that?
Who know run it make rappers get lapped?
Who you know got it like that? spend what I make but I get it right back
Then give it right back,work ten to ten I'm committed like that
But I might celebrate cause we winning like that
We been working the streets for a minute like that

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Eazy
Who you know got it like that?
Burberry trench, I'm just mobbin' like that
Who you know takin' models down like that?
She wants me, I don't got a problem with that
But I'm not the one to call back
Fuck love, I want commas in fact
Interviews wanna know "heard your with so and so"
But let the whole world know that I can not comment on that
Cause I've got the biggest of plans
See what I do when I'm givin' a chance
Told RCA give me the biggest advance
I do this for me, not the critics and fans
And no, I don't listen to rants
From out of line fucks who can't stick to the dance
I might end up fucking the world
You better hope I keep my dick in my pants
Mobbin' out Oakland, A's fitted
Haters keep tryin', I hope that they quit it
Watch me, I got this, you know you'll admitted
See what I like and I go and I get it
This is my sermon to tell, I got the world under a permanent spell
High life is where I'm determined to dwell
There's no games to play now that words to Pell

[Hook: Pell]

[Bridge 1: Pell]
Just made a way
I can't complain I'm doing fine
No pain today
I came to say what's on my mind
(For a minute like that)

[Verse 2: Pell]
Heh, Pell, right
I'm grindin' so hard that I'm fuckin'
No wonder that mulah keep comin'
Stock got so big I might even go public
Cause sharing is caring, break bread with my loved ones
Love for the custard, cream the only thing that I come with
My life so sweet its's disgusting
Love at a distance cause god all I'm trusting
Them graces inside of my safe holy hustle I'm blessed
Labels want equity, but I ain't invest
In Paris with pops, and the louvre ain't impress
Probably cause I bagged my own Mona Lisa
Da Vincis ain't as fly as my writing on features
Easy as Eazy
Calling the bay like Kehlani, my BB
Hit silver lake roll with CC
He Handle my business like Scooter and ScHoolboy like yawk and repeat it
Don't say you can't see it

[Brigde 2: Pell]
Shit
You ain't that blind to the fact
Let me show you what you're missin'
Don't fool yourself
Ain't dropped in a year still they play all my raps
Man who you know got it like that?

[Hook: Pell]

[Bridge 1: Pell]
[Hook: Dominique LeJeune]
I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh, I wish we could just pretend to be
Like we always were before as happy as the Kennedys 
No one told Jackie about Marilyn's tendencies 
Ignorance is bliss when you're married half a century
Life is too short, trying to hold it all together
It's gone before you know it but tonight could last forever
I wrote it out on paper but forgot to mail the letter 
And you could walk away but you won't find nothing better 
It's whatever, I just hope that you remember
Then I said some shit that upset her
Arguing in public, talking loud as Big sweater
She said, "You're always gone." 
I said, "'The fuck do you expect from me?" 
Then she look at me and she said to me

[Hook: Dominique LeJeune]
I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh, maybe in some other lifetime
Or somewhere down the road we might meet up at the right time
Girls come with the profession when you write rhymes 
Clocked me and she told me I'm a pig like I fight crime 
Well, maybe G is just an asshole
Fuck around with bitches Alfalfa, little rascal
I swear my intentions aren't as evil as you think
But temptation's always pushing people to the brink 
Fuck, I always lose my judgment when I drink
My only wish is you would settle down and hear me out
I know I haven't been completely honest and devout
It's difficult for me, these girls try to seek me out 
I try to talk it out but this was all she speak about, she said:

[Hook: Dominique LeJeune]
I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Uh, so if tonight turns out to be
The last night before you peaced then walked out on me 
Let's let it all hang out like a balcony
One last time, the best is what you about to see 
So make it worth it tonight, only so you know I never hurt you in spite
Love me like you never will again, it's our last time
Tonight forget about the pastime 

[Outro: Dominique LeJeune]
Everything will be alright
So baby get some sleep tonight 
[Hook: P-Lo]
When she see me, she wanna take a flick
Come to my house, then I make her strip
I'm a player, you on the bench
I said I might, I might just fuck your bitch
I said I might, I might just fuck your bitch
I said I might, I might just fuck your bitch
I said I might, I might just fuck your bitch
I said I might, I might just fuck your bitch
I said I might

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
I said I might
You know I'm thinking about it
I'm pondering the decision
Yeah, Eazy

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
You ain't wavy, there's no beach around, please, sit down
Stretch Armstrong ass rappers out here reaching now
Pay attention, listen up, I'm teachin' now
Hit your brakes, you're screeching now
Pulled two bitches for the threesome, each are down
Have no mercy on a person with a bitch who's thirsty
Because firstly, you will lose if it's you verse me
Hop on Google, you can search me
Been this person since the nursery
Bow down, you're not worthy
Damn, her ass is fat and boobs are perky
Should I hit that? I may or may not, still on the fence
Snatch if I want her, I'm willing to bet
Bet the house, if I ain't stealing her yet
By the time she meet me, you don't feel I'm a threat?
You'll feel the regret
Bitch, I'm a thief, don't you see these gold teeth?
I'm as evil and cold as a villain could get

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Look, dog, dog out, ain't nothing changed
New city, plus new hoes, equals, new pussy, just to entertain
Capping out, I want the whole thing
Let her swallow the whole thing, freaky hoes got no shame
If you throw that back bitch, I won't complain
All in the club, go commando
She a trap girl, met her ass at the bando
Pouring up more than she can handle
Ones on the booty, man, R.I.P Nando, damn
Let the lil bitch take that like Diddy
You know what it is, everytime I'm in the city
Slums in this bitch, let the shit get gritty
Whole lotta ass, plus the face real pretty
Okay, but look at the shit that I'm on
Bought a new whip, bought a new home
Bought her new lips, that for the dome
Bought a new bitch, I can't go wrong
Ho at the six, leave me alone
G it's too easy, I'm growing like phones
She gave me the pussy, boy, off of this song

[Hook]

[Verse 3: P-Lo]
Damn, I done took your beezy
Everytime I'm gone, she say that she need me
She ain't get no call, she know I got reasons
They ain't really balling, you know that they reaching
I'm thuggin' with my bros, I bet she make it grow
Don't got love for these hoes, lil stunner
She want it in her, raw, you know Imma tell her naw
I put it in her jaw, lil stunner
Took your bitch after the club, she wanna fuck, aye, aye, aye
She in a rush, maybe she think she in love, aye, aye, aye
I just took your bitch and I ain't even try
All I say is real and I can't even lie

[Hook]
[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Cause I'm in love with these Tumblr girls, with skinny waists and drug habits
Pretty faces love status, she acts as if she's the baddest
Man I swear she's just like tons of girls, she expects the free drinks
And I'm successful she thinks, always comes around when weed stinks
We fuck off and on, off and on, only ever really fuck off and on
Never see her these days cause I'm often gone
When I'm home off tour never stop for long
Back this week from across the pond
Noticed I was close to the block she's on, elevator to the floor her loft is on
Drinking whiskey, she likes vodka strong
But after we fuck it's over, walked out the door; that's closure
No I can't stay here and hold her, tomorrow act like I don't know her
Wouldn't ever be here sober, can't tell which one is colder
My clothing's on, we both did wrong, I gotta go that's what I told her

[Hook: G-Eazy]
She said she can't feel her face, right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings there's no place, but you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last (x2)
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
She's fine as fuck and she knows it, sexy body she shows it
Loves the drama she chose it, she draws the line then she blows it
The most fun I suppose it, pops a bottle won't close it
Fills a fifth then she throws it, she pops a bar now she's dozing
She's hot and cold, hot and cold, homie I don't know she's hot and cold
Truly the bullshit has gotten old, superficial with a rotten soul
Fucking off and on, always stop and go
Probably got someone, choose not to know
Head to her place then we lock the door
Making bad calls when I'm off the blow
Cause she's a bitch, I'm selfish, want every girl, can't help it
And it's tough for me to shelf it, it's you I see myself with
Right now I know you felt it, I touched her then she melted
We shouldn't chill but we do it still, gotta play the hand if you dealt it

[Hook]

[Outro: Christoph Andersson]
Missing everything you say, it's not important what you stand for
You're asking will he be the one, I'll be gone before you're done tonight
Waiting for another day, you're not getting what you paid for
Trying to salvage what's undone and deny you got outrun tonight
Never knew her name, they're looking all the same to me
They only chase the fame, there's no one left to blame but me
[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
Let's get lost (x4)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
What it is, what it could be?
My imagination runs fast
Only if you comin' with me
4 AM staying up past
Or however long these drugs last
Don't know why I live so fast
They be telling me to slow down
I be screaming out "fuck that!"
I really wanna take you down
Moaning is how I wanna make you sound
Can't wait until I get you home
Fuck that I wanna take you now
Let’s do it all - have a ball
Hook up tonight in the ladies' room stall
Follow you there I'll let you make the call
You can text all your friends say you'll see them tomorrow
That's if you're down
She never fucked the first night until now
Let me, plow
Faded, I'm drunk off the brown
Stayed up all night on the town
Act like tomorrow just doesn't exist
Time isn't real ain't shit on my wrists
Let go of everything then you have bliss
Then she told me this

[Hook]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Let's get lost tonight
You can be supreme Kate Moss tonight
Turn up in the Soho loft tonight
Do drugs, take 10 shots tonight
Awesome I’m naked with Naked and Famous jeans on the floor
Live a wild life, you ain't seen this before
You should give brains and I mean this for sure
That's what genius is for
Beautiful girl that I just met on tour
Another good girl that I'll probably destroy
Her life was stable until she met me
Sheltered and safe so she never gets freed
But she loves trouble she's drawn to the danger
Never goes crazy, I bet I can change her
I could make her fall in love with a stranger
Switch up the pace I don't mean Danny Granger
Can’t wait until tomorrow? I'm fine with today
You pretty as fuck and I'm tryna slay
"Let's do this right now" is what I'm trying to say
I can tell you don't love him, you're dying to stray
I do not give a fuck 'bout your ex
I'm not looking for love, I'm just looking for sex
Tension between us had me feeling vexed
Then she sent me a text...

[Hook]

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
That's that endless summer, never going back to school
We do what we want to, can't tell me no rules
Every night on the town, going out all the time
And I'm tryna take you down, only thing on my mind

[Outro: Devon Baldwin]
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
[Intro]
Yeah, I got it fam, yeah, young Gerald
All the way from the Bay Area to London
Overseas, across the pond
Yeah, let’s go, yeah

[Verse]
Hair slick backwards, I’m dapper
Your bitch is cool, mine is badder
You haters gossip and chatter
All my team we're eating as if we hunt and we gather
Your girl tweeted that I was her favorite rapper, I’m flattered
Yeah, some are still on the fence like “come convince me”
I was with your girl last night, she gave Lewinsky
It’s me against the world right now, don’t go against me
Cause every single thing that I do, I do intensely
I’m a safe bet while these others are sort of risky
When you think of G you think of the girls and all the whisky
Looking from a distance you think that I came up quickly
Yeah, if I ever kiss the game goodbye I’ll leave a hickey
Yeah, just tryna say I’ll leave my mark on it
Biggest journey starts right now, so I’ll embark on it
Man I hop on a track and I shart on it
Yeah, I eat beats I’m a shark on it
Paid dues and I kept my receipt
Hella hours in the studio, rehearse and repeat
So it’ll be a hundred years before I’m reaching a peak
I’m from the Bay bruh I grew up on 40 and Keak
Yeah, yeah and this shit was so unexpected
Son my flows unprecedented, they know I’m up next to get it
Your shit I’ve been unimpressed with
No I’m not the one to mess with
Move aside and make some room
I come through, make you wanna exit
Yeah, cause I’m arriving right on time
Wear a dozen socks to fit my shoes if you tried on mine
And I, have been killing shit lately
Everything is good, I’m never tripping off what they say
I’m with Westwood, overseas
Back from Amsterdam, we was blowing trees
It’s still the same team, yeah, I roll with G’s
I’m just tryna seize all these opportunities
Had your girl over tip-toeing in her socks
(Hahaha, yeah, ay, ay)
And I feel like we picked the locks
I’m not invincible but you can’t put me in a box
Yeah, it’s like I walk through walls
Man these hoes keep calling, I just dropped two calls
Ay, and I ain’t got two flaws, I got my word and I got two balls
Eazy

[Outro]
International
These Things Happen available now
Out in the UK July 21st
Yeah, yee, Yeah
This beat is just so fucking perfect man
Like, like thank you Drizzy for contributing this to the world
And just giving us all this
Yeah, Unmesswithable
Black on black Vader, soundtrack is so cynical
It’s for certain, keep a cup of Bourbon it’s so critical
I’m just getting started, still a couple years from pinnacle
Lowkey I been killing y’all in another interval
You kiss that girl, you imbecile, her mouth stay on my genitals
Text me ten times I never hit her back, pitiful
I hate how this industry is soooo political
You should just sit down with all that bull go and get a stool
I just don’t believe you, don't know who you think that stuff would fool
Yeah, legendary status what I must achieve
She came thru to smash right afterwards I made her up and leave
You don’t even know what I got up my sleeve
Told my team, “We’d make it in a second, trust me, just believe"
Yeah, rap game James Dean, been here
I’m just out here doing stuff they ain’t seen
Yeah

And don't I look good on the TV screen!
Hey mama, I know I act a fool but now I'm on the show I used to watch after school
Yeah, except difference is nowadays I’m making like triple times your dividends
Walk my stage like Johnny Cash, hello to a massive crowd
Quiet but I’m passing loud, solid crew - no rats allowed
Everybody know I’m next to win, you could ask around
Classic shit, that’s the sound, labels tryna track me down
Faked it ‘til I made it, everything’s official now
Don’t fit in, I stand apart from everybody, that’s just how
Everything I do, I put my name on as original
Skeet on a rich girl’s boobs and watch it trickle down
I want in on every dime bag or nickel now
Every rapper that I’m about to pass up's in a pickle now
Eazy
[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
My momma said I ain't got it all
To tell the truth I believe her, I ain't got it all
13 tucked the water gun in my drawers
Shot at the police because I thought I was in the movie Set It Off
Boy was I wrong now I gotta big choppa
And I stay in Versace Big Pappa
Played no games I don't duck duck goose
I just goose goose goose, that means you, you, you
Shooting won't stop I just don't get it
Cause I [?] more about it than a plane ticket
Hoes running a fam, look where the mom did
Niggas ain't loyal either look what Lebron did
New winning game [?] dough
Just hanging with shooters that be on lines, wet clothes
'Bout to catch a body, chill leader
In the Philly with a motherfucking cheerleader
Sleeping on me Red Beam
Hundred shots, everybody horny, wet dream
I'm on west side and I don't low ride
2 door Bentley coupe, I'm ready to fucking shoot
Light skin girls I had a hard time with
I was dark, so they used to treat me like dogshit
They called me midnight, shadow, oil stain
Ok enough is enough that's not my fucking name
So I turned up, bought me a couple packs
Turned one into two, oh how I love the trap
I'm the man now, no caption
All in they redskins, Desean Jackson

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
You know Gates stays stupid mane who am I to say
You gotta peep him when you see him
Check out how he do his thing
That dont match he got on louis with a gucci wallet chain
Bottom line, never had a mind who am I to think
It was times I had to grind, me and you are not the same
I be movin' in the coupe, you just pulled up in a daze
Playing ball on the ball courts to hoopin in the cage
I went from hoopin' on the ball courts to hoopin' in the cage
I don't know him but he better keep that metal when he walks
Be behaved I wanna break him off nail him to the cross
Look when he got his weapon off ain't no steppin' off
Different interests afflicted how he led us with his thoughts
Dedication mistaken, so what saw people crazy
Done meditated for days and then elevated to greatness
I listen bad with intentions of hearin half
Partner was the driver the cops were clearing path
Riding with us a chopper, shot through the steerin shaft
Baby mother blamed me for killing her childrens ass

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
With the all black attire on like somebody died
You heard I'm not a real one then somebody lied
Fuckboy's soft I know he's pink
I care less about the haters, I care more about what OGs think
Hit the store copped the OE drink
Just imagine meeting legends like I wonder what the old me'd think
Played a show cashed the check copped a rollie quick
Flip you off while I hold my dick
Why the bums wanna hate on Eazy?
Probably because I'm pretty and my smile looks great on TV
Surely he can't spit, surely he ain't shit
Surely you ain't paid enough attention to your bank slip
It's cheap if you sleep on G
See I run with the wolves of wall street
You wear the sheep all b
Whiskey, condoms, and tree what I keep on me
You can't climb as high as me like your Jeep's on E
Get used to me I'm leaving no time soon
Y'all are about to see some shit you can't imagine like you just did shrooms
So forget what you thought it was, I just finally caught a buzz
Son you all like a father does
I gets a lot of love, G

[Verse 4: Loaded Lux]
Lux on BET, you bet your luck
I draw more blacks than etch a sketch does
Protect your neck up, pray for the predators
Show 'em open arms so they don't open the register
I'm with the band we came to dance, baby James Brown
I see the circus ain't changed just the clowns
Hard luck, momma said not like shots out of Starbucks
Balled up punches that cars crush on these [?]
Gone what? that ain't what neither you or your mom's want
Fronting on the phone getting 50 dudes on your lawn front
Pops don't screw up, in the club with losers
Before I met y'all I thought scrubs were loofahs
And you was stable, saving for that cash
Now ok go get payed
You be lying I cut you [?]
[Wires in every speech?]
Why are you being discreet?
A rapper cover gets blown when this fire's being released
[Intro: Blackbear]
(90210, 90210)
Oh

[Verse 1: Blackbear]
What are you yellin' for you’re screaming out your lungs all day and night
I can’t control a girl like you
She need a Saturday away from home to drink more champagne
I can’t mold a girl like you
In all designer to remind ya
You can’t buy her, just her clothes
Can’t define her, can’t design her
In the 90210

[Chorus: Blackbear]
I can’t find her, I can’t find her
In the 90210
In the 90210

[Verse 1 + Chorus]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, uh
Reverb on guitar plucks
Cigarettes and Starbucks
And her line of credit's high
High as the line gets her that her credit card cuts
So in love with the scene, uh
So in love with being seen
Probably it’s time to intervene
But she doesn’t care, so she keep the party goin' in the meantime
Till it's all over, she can’t rewind
If she gets her fix well then she’s fine
I should prolly hit her with the peace sign
Says she wants me and I fall for it each time
She’s aware she’s a bad chick
Studyin' in FIDM cuttin' fabric
I really think her soul's made of plastic
End of the story is inevitably tragic
Uh, yeah

[Chorus: Blackbear]

[Outro: Blackbear]
90210, 90210
Yeah, yeah
I need you, come get it
I need you, I need you
Come find it, come find it
[Produced By: Christoph Andersson]

[Verse]
And this verse is just a method to communicate
Stunt on everybody just so you can hate
I think I'm the one, I'll show you why then let you debate
So direct, shoot it straight
If you just heard about me then you're stupid late
Get right or get left ho, choose a fate
Follow no one I move at my own pace, you can wait
Notice how you stop touching bread like you're losing weight
One day you will see why I'm truly great
I be on the road till I'm old like Willie Nelson is back
20k for a verse you need some help on a track
And I swear I've been all the way to hell and I'm back
Without a cosign at all I put myself on the map
I was chilling with a girl that I just met
Mid conversation got impatient so I asked her can we fuck yet?
Guess that she was upset
That was about the time she stormed off, steaming mad
She was bad but I just let
Her go, why you sweat girls like a fur coat
In the summertime? You're a nerd bro
Never leave work never furlough
Think you're fucking with me? K, sure bro
Ready all times say the word go
Sippin' drinking merlot, started drinking early
Still the same Gerald half killer, half nerdy
So far, my 20's they've been one hell of a journey
Bob Dylan told me don't trust no one over 30
Damn, draped in Saint Laurent and Supreme
Amount of money that I spend on what I want is obscene
All surreal how we live this good off of a dream
And I swear I do it all for the team
Drunk off of the Heem
Truly feel I'm the coldest alive
All I do is work, focus, and strive
Split a swisher, roll a fatty I'mma smoke this and drive
I'm a threat, now some of you can really only hope to survive
Grab a glimpse I'm as rare as it gets
Forget whoever else you might've thought was apparently next
Out here and I'm blessed
I come to town and every girl in the city's at my show and all the parents get stressed
I'm maneuvering with flair and finesse
Working out so I could carry the west
I'll prepare for the test and I'm ready after 5 sets
Lift the whole bay with my biceps
Caution if you try to follow my steps
You will trip and fall get exhausted and collapse
Most of these haters carry germs so I'm cautious giving daps
I just can't fuck with everyone my circle stays the same size
Enjoy the lifestyle that fame buys
After party is at Drai's in Vegas where they have the view
Get some girls, grab a few but only bring the baddest through
Rappers imitate the style, I'm not even mad at you
I'm not even throwing shade, I just overshadow you
Yeah I'm in my own lane, run my own pace
Chasing nobody marathon my own race
I do it for the bay area that's home base
They try to run next to us but there ain't no space
I feel like life just switched to hyperspeed though as of recent
The difference between yourself and me is you're just decent
A garden full of flowers grew its way up through the cement
If I ever said I'm never scared just know I really mean it
I dreamed about the top I had a vision and I seen it
If you know the work comes first than you and I are in agreement
And it's a long haul but I work harder than them all
So come back in 5 years and we can talk about achievement

[Skit/Outro]
[Interviewer]: Hey let me ask you something. Do you worry about achievement? Does it worry you or do you just do your own thing and say "here it is you either accept it or not"?
[Tom Waits]: Well, do I worry about achievement?  No I worry about a lot of things but I don't worry about achievement
[Interviewer]: No, well I'll scratch achievement off

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
I stand here waiting for you all the time
Hope you recognize before I fall apart
The one question staying on my mind
Is why you keep playing with my heart
And I've been waiting for a long, long time
Sometimes I wonder what made me start
The one question staying on my mind
Is why you keep playing with my heart

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I keep saying Imma' change, Imma' change
I'm 22 now it's time to fucking act my age
And I just keep telling her this is just a stage
Where every other night we go party and we rage
And umm.. I be fucking up I know
So immature, I just hope she doesn't know
She's thinking about peacing fast if he doesn't grow up
In the next 5 minutes then she'll up and go
And I'm just saying wait up
Let me show and prove
I know I did some things that you really won't excuse
You really got something I don't want to go and lose
But then she cut me off like when you blow a fuse
And she said to me

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
See I fucked around and always cut it close
Sex is like a drug, I always need another dose
I swear I got a problem they can't even diagnose
And I always seem to stumble every time I try to coast
Saying adios to the groupies
Hello again to you
I swear you got something only shown in a few
And much, much better is what I'm goin' to do
And not sweat someone so miniscule
Have you ever loved somebody, that didn't love you back enough?
Brings on a bunch of extra baggage like you packing stuff
I apologize cuz' I know you really had it rough
It's my word, Imma' stop acting up

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]

All I could do
It's all I could do
All I could do
It's it's it's all I could do

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Take a look around I am not the usual
Music never stops like I'm in a fucking musical
I rap cause I don't never wanna work inside a cubicle
This music is
All I could do
Stoned to the bone thinking life is so beautiful
Sorry if you can't relate or this is all new to you
Ten bad bitches at my party all doable
Took one to my room it was
All I could do
You still rapping with a normal flow
I had your girl in the back giving oral slow
They be rolling up the finest California dro
It's all goodie, all this I am born to go
I'm just doing what I can, living like I'm supposed to
Most can't even comprehend what I'm close to
Blowing off a bitch right after she blows you
That's fucked up dog, but it's what the girl chose too
Cop me a zip, so I rolled me a fatty
Me and some bad chick blowing granddaddy
It's all I could do fool, don't get mad at me
It's just...
It's all I could do

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Skizzy Mars]
Stellas and yellow cabs, I get haters hella mad
G said "get em" so I got at 'em extra fast
We in a city of blonde models and bombshells
But I got that ocean type swag, bitch I'm ill
I like moms who like Dons and don thongs
And like skinny black kids who like to write songs
They pull up in a Honda, we in Pagani Zondas
Getting money you promise? Syke
Wanda told me to be humbler
But every day I'm getting Facebook fans, and features on every Tumblr
Man, haters can't understand
They really can't stand the Heat, they just Cavs fans
Ay look, I get money out the ass and I don't fuck with bank accounts
Used to walk in but all my niggas buying tables now
These white girls got a fucking penthouse fetish
I got the crowd out on they toes like they fucking stretching
I told home girl to meet me in like 10 minutes
It's just me, G-Eazy and like 10 bitches
Got dreams of living lavish, rings like I'm the Mavericks
Man I'm a fucking savage, it's all I could do

Bitch, I got a lot of a hoes and they all up on my dick
All up on my dick, all-all up on my dick
Bitch, I got a lot of a hoes and they all up on my dick
All up on my dick, all-all up on my dick
Bitch, I got a lot of a hoes and they all up on my dick
All up on my dick, all-all up on my dick
And when they get chose I just go and take my pick
Go and take my pick, go and take my pick

[Verse 1]
See these thugs wanna hate cause I got bitches on my dick
I snatch a lot of hoes just because I'm that sick
And when I go to clubs I just choose and pick
Cause I don’t give a damn even if that's your chick
I will snatch your wife thing so do the right thing
And hand her over to me, you don't wanna fight, man
It's nothing to me, I could have her in no time
Hop on the phone line and hit up my old dime
I say “What’s happening?”, she say “What’s up boo?”
Say “What’s good, is it good if I come through?
I’m trying to fuck you, are you trying to get run through?
Cause if not then bitch motherfuck you"
I ain’t playing with you, see what I’m saying to you
After I’m done then I ain’t cup-caking or laying with you
I gotta go, sorry, ain’t trying to hurt you
Don’t think of it was dirt, think of it as a virtue

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
See these hoes wanna do me as I get a lot of booty
She put me in her mouth first and then she did her duty
I signed it on her face “Yours truly” ‘cause she is just a groupie
And I am just a dog like Scooby
Said she gives good brain, I’ll let her school me
While I’m just cooling, see this is what I call a good schooling
It’s better than college when she gives me knowledge
Got boppers on my dick cause my swag is polished
And getting dollars out the ass, pop my collar then I flash
A rubber band full of cash and then I start to laugh at you lames
‘Cause you can’t do it like us, I’m like Piff
Bitch I’m getting brain while I write this
Go and ask the town, I beat walls down
I get around, got more bitches than the pound, I like 'em dark or light brown
Say real let me holla here, take my number down

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I don’t seek ‘cause I’m a “G” till they marry me
Stepped up in the club, I seen your girlfriend stare at me
She was with you ‘till she walked up over to where I be
And then I take her home for sexual therapy
Since I’m on all these bad ones wanna work with me
And they hop up on the dick with urgency
Too many lames up in the game, it’s an emergency
It’s like doctors giving hip hop surgery
I’m stealing girls from their happy like a burglary
Make a lot of dudes wanna fight, but they don’t worry me
I am the freshest, be late, if you ain’t heard of me
I’m G-Eazy not [?] Google me
I don’t have to try to get in pants
I got a lot of hoes that would fuck if they had the chance
We straight to it, there’s no romance
So, uhm, please go ahead and remove your pants
[?]

Young with too much cash, watch how I came up fast
They say I'm next to get it
They bring your name up last
And while I made it splash, rappers came and passed
But still I ask myself
How long does famous last? (5x)

[Verse 1]
I'm addicted to this lifestyle, never going back to no basic shit
When we on tour every night's wild
Thinking about the days we weren't making shit
Spending everything just to make it back
Saying everything never take it back
So if you don't fuck with me
I'm okay with that (2x)
In a black shirt and some faded jeans
Been around the world in these APC's
Working non stop trying to take the keys
Off the lot next week spending 80 g's
Intro my floor to your lady's knees
Always on tour cause I'm making cheese
Michigan in February is 8 degrees
And the fans waiting outside could maybe freeze
Yeah, smoking on killa
Never going nowhere unless your team is strong
Yeah, finally making skrilla
Everywhere I go bring my team along

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah, now I'm almost famous
Still right here with the oldest faces
Swear I came up from the coldest places
Young man gets everything, he goes and chases
Aw man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to marry Kate Upton, blow this money too quickly
To them squares who trying to hate: fuck them
You can't catch me I move too swiftly, I'm always going through customs
When I leave I'm knowing you miss me
We run through bottles like nothin', like I'm tryna drown in this whiskey
Indulge in everything we wish
We drink it straight with no mixers, got bitch drinks if you squeamish
At the after parties, no pictures
My bag of trees looks greenish, got a bad bitch to roll swishers
This lifestyle's the sweetest
Man I'm shining now just like fixtures
Yeah, do it for my city
Everywhere I go bro, I rep the Bay
Yeah, tell you it's a pity
But hating fucks always got shit to say

[Pre-Hook]

How long does famous last? (5x)
[Hook: Sample from Heart's "Alone"] x2

[Hook]
Til' now I always got by on my own (On my own)
I never really cared til' I met you (Til' I met you)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh, This wasn't typical for me don't confuse it
Only thing I've ever loved before you was music
Took my heart and bruised it, You ain't give a fuck
I guess you never know what you have til' you lose it
I know soon you'll probably see it all clear
And realize you lost a real love
Who was here for you unconditionally, but it's ugly
Now years down the line, you reminisce to the point you shed a tear
But I'll be long gone and I never will appear in you're life no more
So gimme 'bout a year, Turn on the radio and I'll be all that you can hear
And you'll be mad you ever went and let me disappear
Now it's only my dreams that I run to
It just sucks that one of them will never come true
You did some shit that you can't Apple "Z" undo
You cocked back and shot me down witch'ya gun boo
And I still got the wounds that'll prove it
What the fucks the point of having love if you lose it?
Took the energy, that's what I go into the booth with
Now I write a song from my heart, You abuse it
And paint the picture of a love lost
Now I know I can't afford the price love cost
Feelin' feeble and weak from the blood loss seeping from my chest
Now I know it just ain't what it once was

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
And since you peaced every day has been a struggle to
Maintain sane when I know I'm still in love with you
Seeing you around with somebody else touchin' you, I'm sick to my stomach wondering is he fuckin' you?
And I know I'm buggin' too, wishin' I could let it go and stop thinkin' 'bout you
But I can't forget it though
You were my queen and you were my dream, til' you turned nightmare I just wanna scream
Somebody please pinch me, I just gotta wake up
I just keep missin' how it was before the break up
Stuck in the past when you were my ace
I just hope you know you could never be replaced
It burns like mace in my face, a vodka shot straight no chase, When I think of us being erased
But you don't feel the same, showin' no empathy
Whatever fuck it, I guess it wasn't meant to be
Aha ha, It is what it is, Take it how you want it."

[Hook] x4
[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
The other day seen this girl walk by the other way
I would have spoke but when I looked at her she looked the other way
Had it been another day I would have grabbed her by the hand
You don’t know who I am but see I love the way you smile
Do you got a man I’d be honored if I can walk with you for a second
I said if you ain’t got no plans
I’m trying to get to know you cause you’re the type I go to
The type I write a song and make a beat about and flow to
Anything to show you how beautiful you are
Wish I could hold you at night and every morning say hello to you
But you don’t know it yet
Maybe I’ll approach you next time and let you know exactly how I feel about you
Until then I think of how fly it would be if it were her and I
The apple of my urban eye
And next time no lie I guess I’ll try cause I

[Hook: Erika Flowers]
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye (no lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye (no lie she the apple of my eye)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
It was one week later when I peeped her at the bus stop
Laid eyes on her and it damn near made my heart stop
Caramel skin tight jeans and some high tops
Knowing I should go and talk to her fuck it why not
I walked over but I still couldn’t do it
It was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
See fly girls always hurt you when they kiss you
And I’m never out of dodge when cupid aims with his pistol
They leave wounds and they scab and they pus
Just when I was thinking that I look up and seen the bus
Come back to reality awoke out of my fantasy
That’s when I could swear she whispered come sit in the back with me
I put my eighty-five cents in and walked to the back where the only open seat was next to her
And I was extra sure until somebody sat first
Damn I guess my story got to wait until next verse

[Hook: Erika Flowers]

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
It was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of July
But she was so cool and so fresh and so fly
So this my opportunity to try and get at her
"Is it cool if I sit?" and then a smile was her reply
I sat down and started talking to her
Be careful of what I say cause I ain’t want to sound awkward to her
Said I been peeping you but I ain’t never spoke
And I figured if I try I probably choke
Then she laughed and looked at me acting like I told a joke
And said "Joke for what? Lighten up, real talk I been trying"
And plus I always see you with him and she laughed again
But what she said next took me for a spin

[Bridge: Erika Flowers]
I saw you on stage never thought you looked my way
Waiting for a shooting star every night of everyday
To wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye
Forbidden juices had me so weak

[Hook: Erika Flowers] x4
[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
You say we never should've been
But I disagree
So like an apple ad I simply think differently
And nah, I'm not lookin for your sympathy, but
You got my heart you know
I know last time we might've failed dismally
We both did some shit, shady as the industry
When we lock eyes, I know you feel it instantly
Despite all the history, you still got a thing for me

[Hook: Metronomy]
I told you how long we got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me
I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Recently I've seen my daydreams vividly
Every time I space out in class, see the imagery of you and I together
Starts fucking with me visibly
Damn, that's what the fuck I get for thinking wishfully
And lately, I've been looking for some quick relief
Liberally, accepting Monica's but missing Hillary
But inside this is all causing misery
Why I ain't got you right now is a mystery

[Hook: Metronomy]
I told you how long we got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me
I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for me

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
So, tell me how you missin me?
Or am I absent like a Jewish familys Christmas tree?
That new dude is a phony, and he isn't me
And I bet you he don't satisfy you physically
But when we sex you experience a symphony
I conduct your body and I beat it like a timpani
For you baby, I would walk across Tennessee
But my chances were tinier than Timothy
But I never get to keep you, we weren't meant to be
We're in a different key, you just wanted middle C
I miss you love, I miss you kissin me
We broken up and gotten back together two times, but this is trilogy

[Hook: Metronomy]
I told you how long we got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me
I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for me

Marty Grimes
KDE on the boards, I see you boy
This shit is just so Ignorant
So fuckin' Ignorant

[Verse 1: Marty Grimes]
VIP bottles all on my table
My niggas with me, we sippin' up
I got bad chicks and they able, these fools ain't hot or cool as us
Its stallions all in my stable, I'm screaming out "fuck a label"
Cause it's dollars all in my pocket
And I'm living life like I'm famous, you know
I stay high, yeah I'm racking up on my air miles
She raise it up, I'mma tear it down
Got the party poppin', I'm here now
Got Kev with me, Phil with me
Beaucoup bottles, takin' shots of Henny
Joint lit, I got Rasta in me
These dudes fake, they deserve an Emmy
Clique full of RNs that go in, no penetration
Young fly nigga what I'm demonstratin'
Don't cuff your chick she need ventilation, breathe
No suffocation on my side, I'm on cloud nine in a high rise
And that European how I ride, deceased

[Pre-Hook: Marty Grimes]
See me coolin' with my crew and no one new
To the point where we do anything we wanna do
We be deep to every party when we rollin' through
In that old school, thought you knew

[Hook: Marty Grimes] x2
Four 12's in the trunk gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know my clique gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know this beat gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know that we gon' bang, bang, bang
We gon' bang, bang, bang

[Verse 2: Marty Grimes]
Find me riding through your streets
My beat loud, my windows down
Chunkin' deuces up to my peeps, I'm getting money and they wonder how
Big faces I'm touching now to yo chick city I'm flying out
Fly me out and I put it down then we blow a pound before the second round
See, I'm the boss of this town
Young king of the city like "where is my crown?"
No joking around, if you're talking about money then I hear you out
Bitch I'm balling, Spalding, Mike Jordan
In my nudies, belt Louis and that two piece Ralph Lauren
Some call me cocky, shit I ain't tripping, that might be true
But check the whip while I'm sliding through
And I dropped the grip on these Nike shoes
I ain't even on but I'm signing boobs
She ain't know I rap, just think I'm cool
Cause I smoke trees, roll deep
Rage all night and get no sleep

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Let's take 'em back, '06, four 12's just to make it slap
Beat knocks like we had gorillas in the back
Every day same shit just listening to Mac Dre
Go to the lab just to make a clap
If I don't fuck with y'all I don't shake or dap
Everytime I rap now I make a stack, and everytime you rap now I take a nap
Playboy from the Bay boy, ain't shit changed but the clothes fit now
Always sell out when my show's in town
Marty this beat go, your shit pound
He's heating up, he's on fire, his shit's hot, go hose it down
You're not on my level, bro sit down
I rep for the Bay and I holds it down, listen (shwoop)
It ain't no one new in my crew
Been down since tall tees when Marty would come through after school
Now this shit bang, this shit bang
Might get a gold tooth, just one fang
Rapper pulling hoes like he R&B sang
Come from the Bay, still speak that slang
Eazy

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook x2]
[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah, rappers try to brag about accomplishments
But nothing you've been dropping yet astonishes
Yeah, next shit I'm about to say is obvious
But criticism's worth some more than compliments
Yeah, we're living at a different speed
Trying to sprout a money tree, we started out with just a seed
Always working, never hindered by a little fatigue
Rapping in arenas, I'm still playing in a different league
Yeah, you still playing wiffle ball
Dropping opportunities I'm picking up a different call
Holding out for bigger checks to lift us all
Never kept a safety net to catch us even if I fall
Rather risk it all than play it safe
You like to sprinkle salt and player hate
My team can eat, I'll share a plate
I had the black on black, I swear you're late

[Hook: G-Eazy]
Everyday I got some fly shit on
Keeping all black outfit on
I already bagged most the chicks
That you out here trying to get on
You just catching up to what I've been on
Yeah, that's what I've been on

[Bridge]
I see what you trying to do, that's not even kinda new
That's the shit I've been on
All these girls you see around, I already took 'em down
That's the shit I've been on (x3)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I be thinking forward though
Thinking quick and making plans, y'all be thinking sort of slow
You be thinking more bitches, I be thinking more dough
Showed them all I do this shit but trust me, I got more to show
Yeah, yeah, I'm just getting started now
All that swerve and spill my Bourbon, brody that's a party foul
Rappers try to swear they're cool
Really? I'm like "hardly, pal"
Black on black with hair slicked back, boy I got the hardest style
And I'm always snatching chicks, flier than Aladdin's whips
Haters on the sideline bitter, hella fucking mad he's rich
Took your darling off your arm, now she just wanna be daddy's bitch
They can't even find me where I'm chillin', like my addy switched
Yeah, breaking rules we all bent 'em
Dreaming about these m's, told my team let's all get 'em
Make a classic song, last as long as raw denim
Every track's a problem, what I spit is all venom

[Hook + Bridge]
[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, funny how these boys front but they hustle backwards
They send Rockie on for a lot of factors
You can keep your lil' tweets cause they don't even matter
You got a bad bitch? Well, all my homies gettin' at her
Show no love, show no mercy
I ball on these niggas: old school, James Worthy
Praises to the most high, I'm so fly
And you know I rep the Chi 'till a nigga die
But I'm in every other state every other week
Climbin' Rocky Mountains, shorty takes a while to reach that peak
Yeah, it's double M, bitch, I fuck with Meek (Maybach Music)
These niggas waitin' on the album praying that it leak
I'm droppin' heat, I'm on fire, nigga you a lie
If you disagree, get some money, fuck with me
They said a young boy slept on
But what I spent on I probably went and put your rent on
I get gone

[Hook: G-Eazy]
Everyday I got some fly shit on
Keeping all black outfit on
I already bagged most the chicks
That you out here trying to get on
You just catching up to what I've been on
Yeah, that's what I've been on

[Bridge 1: Rockie Fresh & G-Eazy]
They wanna talk about the lights
They don't even know the price man
That's that shit I been on
(Yeah, that girl you got is nice, I already had her twice
That's that shit I been on)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, okay, that shit's what I've been doin'
I'mma do what I'm meant to and get money, this shit's been brewin'
If I'm doin' it in store beware the rise I'm ensuin'
Ah, look what the wind blew in, it's your girl who I've been screwin'
Yes, higher standards, higher class
That L.A. confidential will always keep a fire stash
Rappers want me on their songs? I make them wire cash
That's your housewife? She let me on-top-the-dryer smash
Life, don't smoke with us if you've got fragile lungs
Reminiscing being broke when I ain't have the funds
Breaking bread with the homies, now you snack on crumbs
Black on black, I'm looking like a ninja in these Shadow 1's
Yeah, I'm breaking swishers for the broccoli sesh
Coming to a city near you - it's me and Rockie Fresh
Might spend the rest of my life on tour
The Bay's what I put on for
This remix was an encore
They want more

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Tory Lanez & G-Eazy]
Niggas try and gash now first class through the clouds
Nigga that's that shit I been on
Yeah, and that's how it's going down: every night, another town
That's that shit I been on

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, look
And I remain that nigga, spittin' gettin' lifted off a swisher
Awkward, I just hit your bitch up off a picture off of Insta
It's the, uh, youngest on it, honestly I'm markin' targets off the list
And plan on kissin' Kate Barlow with ya bitch
Look, a nigga don't fuck with no hoes that don't give the dome
I'm gettin' dough, sick nigga I be spittin' foam
Gettin grown on my yard game, buy hard Balmain
Jeans cost half a trap-star plus a hallway
More Jordans, Fendi, Dior, sportin' your whore on my corridor
And I'm pourin' her four Porsches
Pull up for Porsches
Cops, they try and court us
These bitches let me in their slots like quarters
Old money in my spot like hoarders
Get shot like ballers on that court, bitch I'm hot like spoilers
See these niggas, you cannot control us
One umbrella stock hot like Glocks and sofas, nigga
Canada!

[Hook]

[Bridge 1]
[Hook (x6)]
I wanna be big, I wanna be big
I wanna be big, I wanna be big

[Verse 1]
Fucking right yea I wanna be big
How the hell else I'mma ever feed kids
But shit is fucked up cause its shady in the biz
All bad you know what it is
Honestly I'm just waiting on the right deal on the table
Truthfully I've met with like 5 labels
They fly me, put me in a hotel and dine me
But they all say that it's early to sign me
Fucks that mean? Wanna wait till I'm big
When My price tag triples and I'm on my shit
Fuck y'all then if I make it on my own
Fuck I need y'all for I don't need another bone
I'mma make it on my lonely, Y'all sound phony
Cause A and R's ain't shit but fake homies
So no lie I'mma make it one day
If I had one wish I would say

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
See and everybody raps, but they don't act fly
Now I ain't on, and everybody ask why
I'm on the phone with the industry on standby
And I feel like I'm watching everybody pass by
Rocked with Chiddy Bang at his very first show
Year passed by, now he's booked on the road
Everybody's getting deals, I'm saying where's mine
Everybody keep asking me why I ain't signed
Did a show with Donnis out in NYC
Read the news night labelmate with TIP
Big ups to that I'm just trying to survive
Hungry wondering when my train will arrive
Do my own production, I'm good with the words
I appeal from the hood to the Burbs
Spots right in front of me I'm trying my hardest to emerge
But there's no greater pressure than an artist on the verge

[Hook]
[Sample From: Sunny Afternoon by The Kinks]

[Intro]

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah, I woke up around 12
Looked to my right found a bag on the shelf
I twist one up burn a zag to myself
And i don't give a fuck if it's bad for my health
I'm mad stressed out
Cause last week see my girl just left out
I went to roll another j and I'm fresh out
And see I'm bummed i ain't even get none last night when i went out
Damn, and now the room's all hazy
Eyes start to look Asian when I'm blazey
Think I'm about to lay around today and be lazy
Maybe might call a squeeze over to amaze me
Yeah, as you can see i've got some issues
I've got my medical card it's gettin' misuse
So I'm stop it if it's bammer? I'm off it
I'm cheech with a fatty full of maui wowie dog shit
[You mean we're smokin' dog shit, man?]

[Verse 2: MOD SUN]
G-Eazy, Mod Sun!
Now I ain't gonna do that regular stoner rap type shit where I like
Take a hit to the mic right before my verse but..
I'm hippie hop, 70's mentality type shit
Came from a family, hipp-ays
My parents both smoked J's in '70s
See even when my mom was pregnant she still blazed
So i've been high before I even lived one day(zed)
But I ain't confused
Could chop it any way, whatever paraphernalia you choose
Ain't nothin' bar on top night for solar puffin vapor
Space cake whatever [it takes to get us copper?]
And we do that!
Yeah we blazed it and strained a lot of eyes? for tastin?
Sour d without the Brooklyn based me
[?] straight from the guy that raised it
Don't say shit
Faded but not so vibrant
Never been to high to keep climbin'
Got a fresh crop but a harvest moon
Wake and bake with me I guarantee every day just like a sunny afternoon

[Outro: MOD SUN]
G, hit me up
Said he was on some 1967 type shit
See that's where I am
Mod Sun
Hippie hop
M.O.D. and some air
[Verse 1: Oktane]
Ok you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
To the hide out and think 'bout what we'll get high 'bout
I got my girl I blow her back out until the lights out
I marry that, gimmie that (inhales smoke)
I like my weed like my music, loud
Ladies always scream when they choosing, ow
So if we gonna do this than lets do this right now
Cause the way the world moving we could all be going down
Just know that we're behind the steering wheel just moving right
Peace and love smoke to that, who's gotta light?
Puff it now pass it down laps around the room
They want me to rap about shooting like dying is cool
No colors one race that we're losing
We'll win tomorrow, move that table and bring those brews in
Tell your followers you bring 5 girls get 2 dudes in
Gotta keep the ratio, don't play this on the radio
These models check in for me now
It's sweats and flip flops, oh this one for the pretty girls
That fuck with hip hop or real rap music or whatever you wanna call it
You never get the bigger picture from inside the wallets
So stop chasing the bread, start chasing your dreams
Internet is the feds, molly got us like fiends
Only drugs that hurt us seem to be the only ones doctors prescribe
And everything that kills us makes us all feel alive

[Hook: Oktane]
So you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
Cause you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise

[Verse 2: Pricetag]
I'm at the bonfire combing out my naps with a black pic
With a black fist vibing to some boom-bap shit
Pocket full of cash and carmax for these chapped lips
Telling stories about a black kid who loved to backflip
And rap with us cause we making booths out the mattress
Granny mad cause we recorded over all her classics
Stop the story reach into my jacket to grab some pre-rolls
Cause there's some cool people around me that I can match with
See some white skins, dark skins, mexicans
All unified by the vibes I came to represent
Fuck where you reside or your residence
You hesitant, rappers couldn't walk a mile in these shoes I'm steppin' in
Taking all challengers
Coming harder than Murphy Lee's Welcome to Atlanta verse
Ashes all on my flannel shirt
There's only one creator and love is the religion
To your heart you must listen life is too short for divisions

[Hook: Pricetag]

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Thump thump, okay, let him rap
Time to come together and connect the gap
Known as the bitch snatching bandit that always dressed in black
I think The Pack hit me like a brick I just woke up from an epic nap
Missed text about a party yea I'll probably go
Hit the lobby flow before I go, cup of coffee though
On good days the honda feel like a bugatti though
But the volumes low, hold on let me push this audio
Splendid, so now I'm headed to this shin-dig
Figure I'ma listen to this new shit that my friends did
Still the same homies ever since we all ascended
Siri interrupts the silence to say the trip has ended
Park and hop out as I wonder what could transpire
In the event of someone talking shit I'll pull my pants higher
But it's good vibes only homies 'round the campfire
Then my tribe marauders at midnight just like some vampires
You bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up don't bring no dudes
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
To the bonfire

[Interlude x5]
Get your vibe on, go on and on
Get your rhyme on, go on and on

[Verse 4: Hit-Boy]
My pack louder than a cop siren
Thats why these police ask niggas wanna silence my squad
We came to save the game from drowning like a licenced life guard
Defying all odds took trips off of water and had hawaiian broads
Suckers pray that I stop and get off the ladder
Cause they know I got the tropicana
The juice no less than a jug full
I step in one leg at a time like a fucking jump suit
You sit back and watch the show from home like Hulu
I stay on my toes like a ballet, no tutu
Haters tryna dim Gang Starr rip Guru
But I've been doing this shit since FUBU
Girls sit in traffic during rush hour just to bring me mushu
I'm like a chemist in the stu just to make sure the feel ain't dead
Big homie said you can't loaf around all day and still make bread
Shit is changing
I had to reprogram my mind and make new living arrangements
Getting rid of self imposed immitations
Still practicing patience working on my cadence
Flow high Oktane like a service station
That boy nice feigning for that feeling of significance
But you can't enjoy the benefit if you can't accept the Price
I continue to push this audio
Is he better with the producing or lyrics?
They bumping heads with they questions like Super Mario
I'm repping throwing big dubs as I coast through Cali
Repping like Chilly Chill squabbling at the bowling alley
Repping like Kent M$ney passing me gucci [?]
After I seen her at the Vibe in Riverside
I'm reppin the ill and I kept it alive
I'm reppin the ill and I keep it alive
I'm reppin the ill and I kept it alive
[Intro: Cisco Adler]
Aloha (Whoa oh oh oh)
G-Eazy (Cisco and Don Carlos, yeah)

[Hook: Cisco Adler]
All my baby girls, all my crazy girls
All my classy ladies and my shady girls
Just wanna party and move their body
So DJ put on that shit that goes
Boom Boom Boom
All my wild girls, all my fly girls
All my beautiful but really don't try girls
Just wanna party and move their body
So DJ put on that shit that goes
Boom Boom Boom

[Verse 1: Cisco Adler]
Everywhere I go, the people want to know
Where the ladies go, where the ladies go
To dance all night, drink all night, party all night
It's going down
All around the world, the beautiful girls
Dance to the beat, dance to the beat
And the boys watch and flash their watches
Thinking that the girls like diamonds, but they like beats

[Hook]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I'm trying to leave this party
Soon soon soon
Hop in my beamer that goes
Vroom vroom vroom
You're the baddest in the
Room room room
And I assume sume sume
That by the way we eyefucked
For the last hour and a half
You're down to leave this party
And get a room room room
And I promise, I don't do this on the regs
Though ain't worried about the next ho
The sky is where your legs go
I'm so into you
I wish there was ten of you
To see in every city
But for now shall we continue like

[Bridge]
All my baby girls, all my crazy girls
All my classy ladies and my shady girls

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Your friend is cool too
But I was hardly into her
Seen a lot of other girls
And you were hardly similar
Been all around the country
Lately I gotten so lucky
I'm from Cali to Kentucky
And the mountains up in truckee
Man I swear
Nothing can compare to California where the women are
Superior and fit model criteria
"I swear"

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Don Carlos]
It's just a world of girls
Woah, oh oh, eh eh, oh oh
Come on girl, come and rock with me
Hawaiian girl want to rock with me
Jamaican girl, or American girl
Canadian, England girl
Woah, woah
"Yeah"

[Hook: x2]
[Hook: Ground Up] x2
Lord forgive me, I'm talking reckless
She from Philly, but her ass from Texas
Bad bitch, she gon' make me breakfast (x2)
Lord forgive me, I'm talking reckless
She hate me but she love my necklace
Bad bitch, she gon' make me breakfast (x2)

[Verse 1: Malaki]
Eleven in the morning, chillin' with a Sarah
Might've been a Tara, didn't really care-a
Know I had to roll up, tap her on the shoulder
Bed over there but we slept on the sofa
Bed over there but we fucked in the cab ride back to the crib
That's backwards and shit
She woke up horny, did a nigga laundry
Made a nigga breakfast, I was kinda hungry
She ain't even eat though, said she on a diet
Pussy was a riot, how could I deny it?
So inspired, when I'm inside her
She a roughrider, never hold back, and she never too tired
Got no man but she could be lying, could be spying
Wanna be an actress, never really made it
But she still trying, she still trying

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Ahem, with the bacon on the side
Friends with benefits cause she know what I provide
Got her in bed then I slid it inside, says she always loves it when I hit it from the side
Besides, I ain't never lied
On the way back home she blew me in her ride
First things first, let me tell you about the vibe
On point, I about died
Look, flippin' eggs her ass is twitching, cooking naked in the kitchen
Bro this verse it isn't fiction, I'm just feeding her addiction
Yeah, while she feeding me bacon, think it'll never work out seeing she's taken
Eating in the house of the dude she's dating, that's a lucky man
No I ain't even hatin'

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Azar]
I state the facts, I stay relaxed
My bitch so bad, you will pay for that
We fucked till the sunset, fade to black
Wearing nothing but her heels and a Raider hat
She's laid back, no makeup on, shawty still so fly
Cause my chick just fill my belly up, my bitch don't kill my vibe
I like the way she stay by me, she weighs my weed
And she knows when I'm not myself, fake I.D
C'est la vie, that's just life
She's just right, does that dirt but she clean up nice
Smoke and sex, no regrets
Just this once I'll be gone by lunch, damn

[Hook] x2
