[Hook: Big T]
Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty-inch blades on the Impala
Call her, gettin' laid tonight
Swisha rolled tight, got sprayed by Ike
I hit the highway, making money the fly way
But there's got to be a better way!
A better way, better way, yeah

[Verse 1: Yungstar]
I'm a -- baller, I'm a twenty-inch crawler
Blades on Impala, diamond rottweiller
I-10 hauler, not a leader not a follower
Break these boys off I'mma twenty inch crawler
Bust a left, a right, I'm outta sight I'm throwed
I'm bouncin off the road Iâ€™m in a mode n fo dem throw dem
Take it to 'em -- hop out my big body form
Chain with the charm can't forget Moet along
I'm hot, find me lookin good, diamonds against my wood
Man it's understood -- got money in my hood
I'm pushing big body can't stop me
For the nine-eight got to sell a million copy
I'mma crawl slow puffin on the Optimo hit the sto'
I'mma go real slow -- puffin indo out the do'
I'mma lit the stash green, man I'm lookin clean
Want remote control screens and nice byzantines

[Hook: Big T]

[Verse 2: Fat Pat]
Big ballin, smashin, makin my ends
Smokin big killa gettin high in the Benz
Big ballin, smashin, makin my ends
Smokin big killa gettin high in the Benz
In the wind smoke goes as I crawl down on Vogues
Twenty Lorenzo, smoke all up in my nose
Yo' eyes, get froze, as you see my low
Candy-red, two-do', let my top down slow
Hittin, my remote, sittin, in my shit
Presidential V-12 with that AMG kit
It don't quit, as I get high
From K.C. to H-Town, connectin SouthSide
Now we worldwide, watch me highside
Fat Pat blowin killa, can't be denied
187 thugs, oh yeah we got love
Blowin sticky green we flow through and above

[Hook: Big T]

[Verse 3: Lil' Will]
Sittin' Fat Down South, rollin Benz on blocks
Mo' scrilla I got, signin with Shortstop
And that's for real, so tell me how you feel
To make a million dollars out my first record deal
Shortstop -- puttin up your motherfuckin ear
Really really don't give a fuck and I ain't drinkin on no beer
Codeine what I sip, pistol grip when I ride
Trunk hittin' fo' life baby it's SouthSide
We on a fuckin mission Expedition Navigator
That's how we be ridin, alligator suitcasin
Puttin it in your face, and that's for real
Shinin harder than the grill it's the player Lil' Will
Down with the 2 Low, Yungstar be a thug
So nigga nigga what? I'm down with Mo'Thugs
Mo'Thugs an' da Bone, you know it's goin down
Represent that H-Town, pop trunks surround by sound

[Hook: Big T]

[Verse 4: Yungstar]
I gots to get better man, it gots to move on
Switched from Motorola to a PrimeCo phone
Broke in two chrome, now you know no dope pigeon
Used to count my spoke, now these hoes count my inches
Had to get older -- man it got colder
I done got grown and got a chip on my shoulder
Links in Kuwait, got links in Pakistan
Boys don't understand virtual reality Caravan
Double doors marble floors naked hoes around me
Everytime I'm comin out, niggas they wanna sign me
Got the Lil' Will diamond grills ??
Blaze in the Benz and you can't forget DenDen
Boobie diamond Ruby's, I'm watchin on a movie
Drop the top on Scott, and you know I'm in a jacuzzi
Bourbon and I'm swervin, man it's gettin hot
My last name Lemon, drive my tight'um off the lot, David Taylor

[Hook: Big T]

[Verse 5: Hawk]
I hit the highway
Everything's my way, I parlay
Everyday all day, ain't no way
Boys can't stop as I slide through your neighborhood
Chop chop chop, headed straight to the top
I only play to win -- bout to close up shop
Showstoppin dead end, pimp the pen once again
Peep the message I send
Take these levels that you devils can't comprehend
Big body Benz -- as I floss through the south
Big blue lens -- now whatcha talkin about?
Close yo' mouth -- as I settle all scores
Scream and shout -- my similes and metaphors
Mansion doors -- I constantly close
All you hoes -- go and take off your clothes
Lord knows -- ain't no time to play
Commence to fuckin and-a suckin on the H.A.W.K

[Hook: Big T]"Bitch wanna die cause she know I caught her lyin!"

[Nattie *singing*]
I met her in a bar outside a little part of Texas
Never know she's sleepin 'round on me
I found about it one night when we were sexin
Cause she accidentally called me Gee
Now you're lyin, fake cryin
Wanna die cause you know you a tramp in my book
Misleadin, steady cheatin
You run the street and you know you a bitch in my book

Now Lil' Jane, I guess that's what we'll call her
Had all the homies goin crazeeee
Had to join a convent, wanted to be a baller
Now the bitch fuck every guy she see
See you a slut and, in the mud and
Havin fun and you're still a bitch in my book
Trampin, soon you die bitch
And that's why you just a bitch in my book

Now I'm livin lost, don't know where my next meal is
Had to try and find a wayayyyy
Cause you left the house and you took everything I deal with
Now bitch I'm wonderin where you stayyy
See you a die-ho, I'll bravo
I'll kill you, still a bitch in my book
Loaded, and smokin
Now I'm blowin, cause you a bitch in my BOOK...

Just a bitch in my BOOK...
This ho is a slut in my booook...

Just a tramp, sick and tired of feedin whores
Everytime I'm walkin down the stree-eeet
And I'm sick and tired, of always seein closed doors
Wanna slap every tramp I meet
See you started, then you parted
Now you bought in, still a tramp in my book
Low-life, do Snow White
Now you crow and you're still a bitch in my book
Know that, I go there
I'll beat you, you still a bitch in my book
Holdin, these .. *cracks up*[Troy] Where the love at?

[Willie D]
Momma told me there'd be days like this, but I didn't listen
Never question the woman's intuition
My ambition is to give you what you missin, sweet love
Take off your shoes, come and get your feet rubbed
Us in the tub, takin bubble baths, that'll be the shit
Anybody that don't believe this can eat a dick
I think we soul mates, cause we got so much in common
You make them hoes wait, when you find the proper woman
Lay next to me, put yo' head on my chest
Attraction stimulates me but it's not all about sex
I respect you got a mind and you... self sufficient
Opinonated... yet know how to listen
Now what's mine is yours, if I'm ballin you ballin
Tell that other nigga, he can stop callin
Check this out

Chorus: Lil' Troy (repeat 4X)

[Sung] I want to be your man
[Troy] Where the love at? Where the love at?

[Willie D - over Hook]
I wanna be your man baby; I'm talkin about
Providin you with all of life's.. securities - I mean
I think the first step is, goin to pick out some rings
What you like? Baguettes and pistol skirts

[Ardis]
Can I spend a night, without givin you my ends tonight?
Cause I gotta catch a early flight
What you yellin bout? The simple fact that I'm bailin out?
I'm makin moves, my album sellin out
I need some affection, love could you teach me a lesson
I might be sittin fat down here in Texas, but the thugs is mean
So how deep is your love for me?
How real do you cut for me?
If the laws came and got me, how long would you-a stuck with me?
If not long then don't fuck with me
I want you down on my team and support, when I'm tryin to make my green
If you're real, I'll throw some carats in your ring
I'll make it last forever, cause you know I had that cash forever
We can ball till we pass together baby
Where the love at

Chorus

[Willie D - over Hook]
Hahah, yeah
My nigga Lil' Troy, Short Stop Records
Puttin down like a G.O. ..
That's how we get our groove on!

[Willie D]
Recognize the mob, I bet you co-workers stare
When they - see the flowers that I'm sendin to your job
Read the cards, stick it in your purse, let's keep it rosy
Cause everybody so nosy
So you can't believe what people say
Misery loves company - tell them keep away, it'll be ok
If you trust in me to make it right
Before I hit you I'll freak ya that's on my baby's life
Will you be my wife? Please take this ring - let it serve as a token
To make you realize baby I ain't jokin
I'm copin, but my adversaries got me noid
I need a God-fearin woman, who understands my heart
Leave your baggage from past relationships, out of the picture
I put my old flames out and changed, all of my digits
And that's real

Chorus

[Willie D - over Hook]
I want to be your man, sober
Ain't really no need to question me
And we're together as far as..
For my loyalty or my commitment life
You know my presence, but you alone, should let you know
You don't want to mess with me
I need you to spend time with me

[Ardis]
I brang the heat
You want to play? It ain't a thing to me
You say you changed, you look the same to me
Eat and ball too much
On the real, cause I done stall too much
Girl I want you all too much
Ain't no way in the world, me and you can ball too much
Imagine having cabbage, straight lavish
Your friends wish they can have it
Cause I push a Rolex, sip crystal glasses of Moet
Don't listen to your friends about me cheatin
They don't know that, your best friend want me
Tell that ho that, fo' sho' dat
You know she want the kids you shoulda knew this, true this
Few real niggas left, I'm one of the fewest
Holla at me girl, I'm Ardis, we can do this
Do that love thing girl, so I can prove that

Chorus (to fade)Back in effect!

[Scarface]
Dig it
Comin back, I'm too large, I'm widdit
Come test me, you wanna get scarred, back in effect
That means that Ak is comin hard
And you're regrettin that you tried to pull his card
I start to sweat, when MC's get out of hand
And I don't let you amateurs get on the stand
I just go get Johnny B the right-hand man
And watch em jet, when the Akshun takes a stand
I'm on the set in other words, I'm in effect
Grab your cassettes, hit your rewinds, and your ejects
Tell your friends that Ak is back and Ak is def
Another head put to rest

"When you wanna step to me I think you should know that.." -] Kane
	"I am a nightmare walkin, psychopath talkin.." -] Ice-T

"Akshun!"

[Scarface]
I go for broke, so why would you waste time
Here comes an Einstein, bringin the bassline
Boy you're a sad case, still wanna test mine?
Yeah this is Brad's race, and here comes the next rhyme
You shoulda thought, before you stepped into
The center square, now I'm gonna bend you
You shoulda broke out, right after when you
Had the chance, so let me continue
I've got rhymes that can go on forever put em in mines and combine
And make em clever, irritatin the most minds
Aiyyo money, it's toast time, let us compare
Who's got the dope rhymes?
I take it as it comes, I got the gall
I couldn't fake it, so who's the one you call
To rock a party, and you know that Ak won't stall
Pass me the 40, I'm back in effect y'all
And step, and give the man some respect
You guessed, another head put to rest

"When you wanna step to me I think you should know that.." -] Kane
	"This is how it should be done.." -] Rakim

"Akshun!"

[Scarface]
Back, comin back like a crackfiend
Strong, I leave a mark like a vaccine
Stop, you comin off on a wack scene
You're steppin on Ak's green
Move, up close, to the animal
Not a vegetarian, I'm more like a cannibal
I'm comin hard, I'm comin hard, you can't stop the press
Ak is a madman and I'm grabbin hostages
Flow, at will, stand at attention
Now go, no more plottin and no mo' bitchin
Ak is a man, who's gonna get off
Whassup?  Step off
I heard your rhymes, and nevertheless
I never fess, and I'm back to progress
I yell whassup?  Put you to a test
Another head put to rest

"When you wanna step to me I think you should know that.." -] Kane
	"B. is on the cut.." -] Rakin

[Scarface]
As you sit, in your crib just imaginin
How to make up a jam that just hasn't been
Used, by the Ak kid now that's a laugh
It's over, on the level, stack up the trash
Pause, and let me break it down the way
I want to break it, and see how it sounds too
I couldn't fake it, cause Ak ain't around to play
I couldn't take it, now H-Town is bound to pay
Bet, the man tried to hold me back
Now sweat, you couldn't control the Ak
Go get, upset cause I told the facts
You'll jet, cause here comes a load of wax
I cool, on the scene I'm in the spotlight
A fool, tried to test me then I got hype
I taught school, told them to take a hike
Grab the mic, psych, that jam is too hot right
I prove, to all you punks just like Willie D
Ooooh, don't mention names, oh silly me
But on the real tip, take it seriously
You couldn't handle Ak, I mean really D
I'm coolin, and steppin, whassup with that?
Backs to progress, another head put to rest

"When you wanna step to me I think you should know that.." -] Kane
	"Ain't.. no.. half.. steppin.."

Yeah he did that big lacs ya'll gotta brag
Young cat with the act to mack
Sharper then the crease of your slacks
I did one song and got carried away
If I could recall your boy got carried away
So many kisses and hugs like I'm married today
If I have a girl she love me she stare at my face
But I live my life with a baller's choice
Practice my game on a thousand-broads but you know
This young baller is certified, don't look at my ice
It'll hurt your eyes now the snake and the rat
Trynna kill my plan

I'm the younger baller but I'm alright
With that dark shades, dark hat

For you to fool this cat I spit lyrics on
A track like a Uzi on-max
My Daddy told me bite my teeth around
A switch he also told me fight my sleep
Around a chick and then he told me
He paid the price fa sho so what wrong road
That he took I wouldn't have to go
Now I'm the center of attention and my class
Is broke now I can rap,write,and recite
Fast or slow movie scrips, Uzi clips, Jacuzzi
Freaks it sound cool wit me if you don't work
Then you don't eat so move back get some motion
Playa move your feet now I'm steppin'
Through this industry rooflessly
I got the young world whisperin' who is he?

[Hook:Troy and T2] (x2)

[Verse Three: T-2]
When it comes to basketball I'mma cold young
Fella ask Lil'Romeo we was in the
Hoop-it up together
Now you might see me in a movie on BET
Called "Wanna Be A Baller"
Stares my pops and me
Guess I like to have fun and that's fa sho
Hit the skatin' rink and show you how fast I go
When we dance on stage we performin' life
I had to stop I heard this girl say I was fine
So I stopped my groove to see what was up
When I got too close man she grabbed me on my butt
So I asked her for her number and see wrote it down
That's how we do it in H-town
Now I know exactly why your girl's likin' me
The bling in my chain and the gliem in my teeth
Now my name is T-2 and it stands for Lil'T
Now I'm burnin up the charts like my boy Jay-Z

[Hook:Troy and T-2] (x2)
Big ballin' smashin'

It don't quit, as I get high
From K.C. to H-Town, connectin SouthSide
Now we worldwide, watch me highside
Fat Pat blowin killa, can't be denied
187 thugs, oh yeah we got love
Blowin sticky green we flow through and above

[Hook: Big T]

[Verse 3: Lil' Will]
Sittin' Fat Down South, rollin Benz on blocks
Mo' scrilla I got, signin with Shortstop
And that's for real, so tell me how you feel
To make a million dollars out my first record deal
Shortstop -- puttin up your motherfuckin ear
Really really don't give a fuck and I ain't drinkin on no beer
Codeine what I sip, pistol grip when I ride
Trunk hittin' fo' life baby it's SouthSide
We on a fuckin mission Expedition Navigator
That's how we be ridin, alligator suitcasin
Puttin it in your face, and that's for real
Shinin harder than the grill it's the player Lil' Will
Down with the 2 Low, Yungstar be a thug
So nigga nigga what? I'm down with Mo'Thugs
Mo'Thugs an' da Bone, you know it's goin down
Represent that H-Town, pop trunks surround by sound

[Hook: Big T]

[Verse 4: Yungstar]
I gots to get better man, it gots to move on
Switched from Motorola to a PrimeCo phone
Broke in two chrome, now you know no dope pigeon
Used to count my spoke, now these hoes count my inches
Had to get older -- man it got colder
I done got grown and got a chip on my shoulder
Links in Kuwait, got links in Pakistan
Boys don't understand virtual reality Caravan
Double doors marble floors naked hoes around me
Everytime I'm comin out, niggas they wanna sign me
Got the Lil' Will diamond grills ??
Blaze in the Benz and you can't forget DenDen
Boobie diamond Ruby's, I'm watchin on a movie
Drop the top on Scott, and you know I'm in a jacuzzi
Bourbon and I'm swervin, man it's gettin hot
My last name Lemon, drive my tight'um off the lot, David Taylor

[Hook: Big T]

[Verse 5: Hawk]
I hit the highway
Everything's my way, I parlay
Everyday all day, ain't no way
Boys can't stop as I slide through your neighborhood
Chop chop chop, headed straight to the top
I only play to win -- bout to close up shop
Showstoppin dead end, pimp the pen once again
Peep the message I send
Take these levels that you devils can't comprehend
Big body Benz -- as I floss through the south
Big blue lens -- now whatcha talkin about?
Close yo' mouth -- as I settle all scores
Scream and shout -- my similes and metaphors
Mansion doors -- I constantly close
All you hoes -- go and take off your clothes
Lord knows -- ain't no time to play
Commence to fuckin and-a suckin on the H.A.W.K

[Hook: Big T][Lil' Flip talking]
Yeah, Lil' Flip puttin it down wit Lil' Troy
R. Dis, back to ballin nah what I'm sayin
Down South we gonn' lean though
I dont know what y'all do but ugh...

[Hook 2X]
We gonn' lean to the left
We gonn' lean to the right
We gonn' lean both ways
Ya better give us some room!

[Lil' Flip]
When I'm leanin to the left I'm gone off that drank
When I'm leanin to the right I'm gone off that dank
Light green do-do with no seeds
I wear cardio I threw away my Roley
You know me I keep rollin up the block rocks
Frozen in my watch hoes holdin by my drop
I'm in tha parkin lot tryna find a parkin spot
My trunk popped up I dont care if its dark or not
I'm ballin hot but my grill so icey
I'm ridin candy paint but my wheels so pricey
I'm wearin Nike from my head to my feet
Baguettes on my teeth carvette candy peach
With DVD's I'm watchin Scary Movie 2
Jammin DJ Screw HPD's can't see through
Cause I'm tinted up nigga I can do dat
When I pull up kids sayin where's your roof at?

[Hook] - 2X

[R. Dis]
We gon' shop we gon' pop get crunk it won't stop
Back back you in my space, you know I need some room to rock
Move over on man it's just somethin I do over
Get wilder if you was eatin I would knock ya food over
I'm tryna set it off dogg and you all up in here
Gimme some room before I bump ya and you all in my ear
I'mma say somethin back and it's a fight up in heah
I got all my goons wit me I'm aight up in heah
I ain't tryna be rude I jus' lean like that
Popped up thirty-deep - I hit the scene like that
Everybody lookin - why? Cause I'm clean like that
Got sweat on my nose - why? Cause I'm mean like that
I'm rockin arenas - why!? Cause my shows like that
I stay starched down - why? Cause my clothes like that
I might stop a minute - why? Cause I pose like that
Then get back to leanin why? Cause I'm throwed like that

[Hook]

[R. Dis]
What, what, what, what mayn we crankin it up!
We gon' buy the bar tonight and we drankin it up
Puttin smoke in the air we stankin it up y'all
Know me who I am say my name R. DDDDIIISSSS!
I'mma roll I'mma crawl I'mma knock down walls
I'mma asshole somebody help me get out my drawers
We gon' ride we gon' drive we gon' swerve we wreckers
Off the chain we puttin it down we gon' lean for Texas
I'm fantastic my music mo flow but I'm chillin
Hit the block and make a killin big car no ceiling
Don't let me hear a song that I'm feelin Screw tape
I'mma ball I'mma shake I'm holler eeeaaarrrttthhh qqquuuaakkkeee!!
(eeaarrtthh qquuaakkee!) Pass me a sweet so I can blaze it up
Click then keep the lighter lit then raise it up
If you standin too close I dont know whom is whom
But I'm bout to go off you better give me some room!

[Hook] - repeat to end[Troy] Where the love at?

[Willie D]
Momma told me there'd be days like this, but I didn't listen
Never question the woman's intuition
My ambition is to give you what you missin, sweet love
Take off your shoes, come and get your feet rubbed
Us in the tub, takin bubble baths, that'll be the shit
Anybody that don't believe this can eat a dick
I think we soul mates, cause we got so much in common
You make them hoes wait, when you find the proper woman
Lay next to me, put yo' head on my chest
Attraction stimulates me but it's not all about sex
I respect you got a mind and you... self sufficient
Opinonated... yet know how to listen
Now what's mine is yours, if I'm ballin you ballin
Tell that other nigga, he can stop callin
Check this out

Chorus: Lil' Troy (repeat 4X)

[Sung] I want to be your man
[Troy] Where the love at? Where the love at?

[Willie D - over Hook]
I wanna be your man baby; I'm talkin about
Providin you with all of life's.. securities - I mean
I think the first step is, goin to pick out some rings
What you like? Baguettes and pistol skirts

[Ardis]
Can I spend a night, without givin you my ends tonight?
Cause I gotta catch a early flight
What you yellin bout? The simple fact that I'm bailin out?
I'm makin moves, my album sellin out
I need some affection, love could you teach me a lesson
I might be sittin fat down here in Texas, but the thugs is mean
So how deep is your love for me?
How real do you cut for me?
If the laws came and got me, how long would you-a stuck with me?
If not long then don't fuck with me
I want you down on my team and support, when I'm tryin to make my green
If you're real, I'll throw some carats in your ring
I'll make it last forever, cause you know I had that cash forever
We can ball till we pass together baby
Where the love at

Chorus

[Willie D - over Hook]
Hahah, yeah
My nigga Lil' Troy, Short Stop Records
Puttin down like a G.O. ..
That's how we get our groove on!

[Willie D]
Recognize the mob, I bet you co-workers stare
When they - see the flowers that I'm sendin to your job
Read the cards, stick it in your purse, let's keep it rosy
Cause everybody so nosy
So you can't believe what people say
Misery loves company - tell them keep away, it'll be ok
If you trust in me to make it right
Before I hit you I'll freak ya that's on my baby's life
Will you be my wife? Please take this ring - let it serve as a token
To make you realize baby I ain't jokin
I'm copin, but my adversaries got me noid
I need a God-fearin woman, who understands my heart
Leave your baggage from past relationships, out of the picture
I put my old flames out and changed, all of my digits
And that's real

Chorus

[Willie D - over Hook]
I want to be your man, sober
Ain't really no need to question me
And we're together as far as..
For my loyalty or my commitment life
You know my presence, but you alone, should let you know
You don't want to mess with me
I need you to spend time with me

[Ardis]
I brang the heat
You want to play? It ain't a thing to me
You say you changed, you look the same to me
Eat and ball too much
On the real, cause I done stall too much
Girl I want you all too much
Ain't no way in the world, me and you can ball too much
Imagine having cabbage, straight lavish
Your friends wish they can have it
Cause I push a Rolex, sip crystal glasses of Moet
Don't listen to your friends about me cheatin
They don't know that, your best friend want me
Tell that ho that, fo' sho' dat
You know she want the kids you shoulda knew this, true this
Few real niggas left, I'm one of the fewest
Holla at me girl, I'm Ardis, we can do this
Do that love thing girl, so I can prove that

Chorus (to fade)Back in effect!

[Scarface]
Dig it
Comin back, I'm too large, I'm widdit
Come test me, you wanna get scarred, back in effect
That means that Ak is comin hard
And you're regrettin that you tried to pull his card
I start to sweat, when MC's get out of hand
And I don't let you amateurs get on the stand
I just go get Johnny B the right-hand man
And watch em jet, when the Akshun takes a stand
I'm on the set in other words, I'm in effect
Grab your cassettes, hit your rewinds, and your ejects
Tell your friends that Ak is back and Ak is def
Another head put to rest

"When you wanna step to me I think you should know that.." -] Kane
	"I am a nightmare walkin, psychopath talkin.." -] Ice-T

"Akshun!"

[Scarface]
I go for broke, so why would you waste time
Here comes an Einstein, bringin the bassline
Boy you're a sad case, still wanna test mine?
Yeah this is Brad's race, and here comes the next rhyme
You shoulda thought, before you stepped into
The center square, now I'm gonna bend you
You shoulda broke out, right after when you
Had the chance, so let me continue
I've got rhymes that can go on forever put em in mines and combine
And make em clever, irritatin the most minds
Aiyyo money, it's toast time, let us compare
Who's got the dope rhymes?
I take it as it comes, I got the gall
I couldn't fake it, so who's the one you call
To rock a party, and you know that Ak won't stall
Pass me the 40, I'm back in effect y'all
And step, and give the man some respect
You guessed, another head put to rest

"When you wanna step to me I think you should know that.." -] Kane
	"This is how it should be done.." -] Rakim

"Akshun!"

[Scarface]
Back, comin back like a crackfiend
Strong, I leave a mark like a vaccine
Stop, you comin off on a wack scene
You're steppin on Ak's green
Move, up close, to the animal
Not a vegetarian, I'm more like a cannibal
I'm comin hard, I'm comin hard, you can't stop the press
Ak is a madman and I'm grabbin hostages
Flow, at will, stand at attention
Now go, no more plottin and no mo' bitchin
Ak is a man, who's gonna get off
Whassup?  Step off
I heard your rhymes, and nevertheless
I never fess, and I'm back to progress
I yell whassup?  Put you to a test
Another head put to rest

"When you wanna step to me I think you should know that.." -] Kane
	"B. is on the cut.." -] Rakin

[Scarface]
As you sit, in your crib just imaginin
How to make up a jam that just hasn't been
Used, by the Ak kid now that's a laugh
It's over, on the level, stack up the trash
Pause, and let me break it down the way
I want to break it, and see how it sounds too
I couldn't fake it, cause Ak ain't around to play
I couldn't take it, now H-Town is bound to pay
Bet, the man tried to hold me back
Now sweat, you couldn't control the Ak
Go get, upset cause I told the facts
You'll jet, cause here comes a load of wax
I cool, on the scene I'm in the spotlight
A fool, tried to test me then I got hype
I taught school, told them to take a hike
Grab the mic, psych, that jam is too hot right
I prove, to all you punks just like Willie D
Ooooh, don't mention names, oh silly me
But on the real tip, take it seriously
You couldn't handle Ak, I mean really D
I'm coolin, and steppin, whassup with that?
Backs to progress, another head put to rest

"When you wanna step to me I think you should know that.." -] Kane
	"Ain't.. no.. half.. steppin.."

[Scarface]
I'd like to send a shout out to Class Quarter Productions

Too cold with my frees and flows high G's
And lows Short Stop bout to hit you out
I'm in the mix to ball sittin fat
Yeah he did that big lacs ya'll gotta brag
Young cat with the act to mack
Sharper then the crease of your slacks
I did one song and got carried away
If I could recall your boy got carried away
So many kisses and hugs like I'm married today
If I have a girl she love me she stare at my face
But I live my life with a baller's choice
Practice my game on a thousand-broads but you know
This young baller is certified, don't look at my ice
It'll hurt your eyes now the snake and the rat
Trynna kill my plan
I'm like Samuel L. Jackson I'm still the man maan!

[Hook:Troy and T-2] (x2)

[Verse Two: T-2]
I'm the younger baller but I'm alright
With that dark shades, dark hat
I'm the coolest cat I got too much game
For you to fool this cat I spit lyrics on
A track like a Uzi on-max
My Daddy told me bite my teeth around
A switch he also told me fight my sleep
Around a chick and then he told me
He paid the price fa sho so what wrong road
That he took I wouldn't have to go
Now I'm the center of attention and my class
Is broke now I can rap,write,and recite
Fast or slow movie scrips, Uzi clips, Jacuzzi
Freaks it sound cool wit me if you don't work
Then you don't eat so move back get some motion
Playa move your feet now I'm steppin'
Through this industry rooflessly
I got the young world whisperin' who is he?

[Hook:Troy and T2] (x2)

[Verse Three: T-2]
When it comes to basketball I'mma cold young
Fella ask Lil'Romeo we was in the
Hoop-it up together
Now you might see me in a movie on BET
Called "Wanna Be A Baller"
Stares my pops and me
Guess I like to have fun and that's fa sho
Hit the skatin' rink and show you how fast I go
When we dance on stage we performin' life
I had to stop I heard this girl say I was fine
So I stopped my groove to see what was up
When I got too close man she grabbed me on my butt
So I asked her for her number and see wrote it down
That's how we do it in H-town
Now I know exactly why your girl's likin' me
The bling in my chain and the gliem in my teeth
Now my name is T-2 and it stands for Lil'T
Now I'm burnin up the charts like my boy Jay-Z

[Hook:Troy and T-2] (x2)
Big ballin' smashin'
Makin' my ends

Chorus

[Lil' Troy]

Chorus

[Ardis]

Cuz if I get crunk I pop the trunk

You dont know how far our money extend
Pushin tha benz ridin shotgun
Cop twins in case I have to die for the ends
It was a half of a meal
From the jump when he started to burn
One lick was three and a quarter to burn
Throw three hundred in the aisle these niggas full like that

I stay sober when its good for me
And grab my Glock and make sure i put enought on me

Chorus

[Lil' Troy] talking

Yea fuck these niggas

You motherfuckers, fucking nickel and dime niggas and shit
Talkin bout stopping me, how the fuck you gonna stop me
I started this Short Stop ass shit, nigga I Short Stop
Every motherfucking body you know dat, huh

[Lil' Troy]
What's up y'all, Lil' Troy is back
The more you try to stop me, the more I stack
Money, clothes, cars, hoes
S.U.V.'s, six T.V.'s
How the fuck did I come up
Boy mama ain't raise, no dumb punk
I stepped in the game, flipped my change
Got the fuck out, 'fore the people came
But I still got caught, in the cross
Just got released, from the half way house
Threw a champaign party for myself
Paid fifty G's, like I never left
So bow down, when I come through
Short Stop Wear, that's my shit too
Dream about it, I done that
I'm the first nigga, signed Scarface to a contract
You might say, I'm ahead of my time
I did FED, and regular time
Nickel and dime, niggas always bumping
Let me tell y'all motherfuckers something

[Hook]
I've been making this money for years
I've been breaking these hundreds for years
I've been driving these cars for years
Making the deals, shifting the gears
I've been fucking these hoes for years
I've been buying these clothes for years
I've been with Pat and them for years
Making the deals, shifting the gears

[R-Dis]
H-Town is the spot, where niggas get shot
Hoes sell cock, every block is hot
Try to take what I got, we gon box
9 times out of 10, I'ma knock yo motherfucking ass out
Nigga I'm trained to whoop ass, and count cash
Can I rock the mic, you god damn right
But if I got my tool, I'ma drop a fool
From a distance, I'm not gon fight
You can make it easy, or you can make it tough
Why rassle with a nigga, when I can just bust
My nuts hang, to the flo' like drapes
Niggas tripping off my tapes, since 1988
I make money money, make money money money
Pretty hoes I trap put down my mack
Get that cat, from the back
Gon be like that, until I fall
I'm with y'all, fuck the laws
Gots to ball, try to put me on pause
I'ma bust em, in they motherfucking jaws
When it comes to paper, I ain't a stranger
Mark my fucking words, ain't nothing gon change cause

[Hook]

[D-Man]
Guess who jumped in the industry
With Lil' Troy, niggas tried to finish me
'Fore I started, departed
Now I'm back, as a junior mack to make noise
Like Too Short, I just can't stay away
Cause I'm tired of putting shit, on lay-away
So I gotta get up, and try to make a way
I feel great, I signed my contract today
Can you believe, Lil' Troy didn't even
Want my style, raps, flows, rhymes
Just my loyalty, so he ended up spoiling me
I got God with me
And now I'm as hard as can be, nobody harder than me
You see through niggas, just like water to drink
I'm like Pinocchio, when my flows start to grow
The big we ego straight
Now I'm in the game fa sho, who say I ain't no pro
Who said a making ass nigga, can't go
Let a nigga know, so I can put it in your face
And take it on your toe
Since 9-1, nigga I've been doing this
Been around the world, airplanes and cruise ships
Don't cap, even if you could prove the shit
Trying to get rich quick, by moving hits
So fuck fame, I'ma sold game
Make hits get mo' change, but won't change
I'ma be a star soon, platinumize myself
And turn it all to a cartoon
Short Stop is the hardest, Lil' Troy, Bay-B. Doll and R-Dis
We top notch, we taking over that's a promise bitch
Wanna know me, look me up under max anonymous

[Hook - 3x]This album is dedicated to lil mike my little brother
He got two life sentences never shed a tear though
You know baby we all locked in this game
I'm gonna hold for a dime till you get back
Much love baby peace side

I've been in the industry, since nine-three
My so-called dogs, haven't paid me no royalties
Lord please, SouthSide G's from fo's to threes
Cook up ki's, watchin out for the enemies
They can't fuck with me, I'm a ??
Straight up G, cleaners keep me creased
Middle finger to police, Grim Reap meets to slay the beast

[Yungstar]
Get yo' paper, watchin out for them haters
Dressin up in gators, takin flights to Vegas
Rollin' Navigators, on the seven acres
I'm a money maker dough baker bitch breaker
Never ever be a faker, try to make a hit like Anita Baker
In the rap, in the dope game, tryin to make some hits mayne
Fo' sho', gotta let the people know how the game go
Shortstop break a bitch and gotta let the world know
Who back with the tracks, I guess I'm the junior mack
Hell yeah, I'm rollin 'llac, Shortstop paper stackChorus: Fat Pat
Wanna be a -- baller, shot caller
Twenty inch blades -- on the Impala
A caller gettin laid tonight
Swisher rolled tight, gotta sprayed by Ike

But there's got to be a BETT-ER WAYY!
A better way, better way, YEAH-AHHHH

(Yungstar)

Break these boys off I'ma twenty inch crawler
Bust a left, a right, I'm outta sight I'm throwed

Tiny tune -- hop out my big body form
Chain with the chong, can't forget Moet along

Man it's understood -- got money in my hood

(Fat Pat)
Big ballin, smashin, makin my ends
Smokin big killa gettin high in the Benz
Big ballin, smashin, makin my ends
Smokin big killa gettin high in the Benz
In the wind smoke goes as I crawl down on Vogues
Twenty Lorenzo, smoke all up in my nose
Yo' eyes, get froze, as you see my low
Candy-red, two-do', let my top down slow
Hittin, my remote, sittin, in my shit
Presidential V-12 with that AMG kit
It don't quit, as I get high
From K.C. to H-Town, connectin SouthSide
Now we worldwide, watch me highside
Fat Pat blowin killa, can't be denied
187 thugs, oh yeah we got love
Blowin sticky green we flow through and above

Chorus

(Lil' Will)
Sittin' Fat Down South, rollin Benz on blocks
Mo' scrilla I got, signin with Shortstop
And that's for real, so tell me how you feel
To make a million dollars out my first record deal
Shortstop -- puttin up your motherfuckin ear
Really really don't give a fuck and I ain't drinkin on no beer
Codeine what I sip, pistol grip when I ride
Trunk hit fo' life baby it's SouthSide
We on a fuckin mission Expedition Navigator
That's how we be ridin, alligator suitcasin
Puttin it in your face, and that's for real
Shinin harder than the grill it's the player Lil' Will
Down with the 2-Low, Yungstar be a thug
So nigga, nigga what? I'm down with Mo'Thugs
Mo'Thugs an' da Bone, you know it's goin down
Represent that H-Town, pop trunks surround by sound

Chorus

(Yungstar)
I gots to get better man, it gots to move on
Switched from Motorola to a PrimeCo phone
Broke in two chrome, now you know no dope pigeon
Used to count my spoke, now these hoes count my inches
Had to get older -- man it got colder
I done got grown and got a chip on my shoulder
Licks in Kuwait, got links in Pakistan
Boys don't understand virtual reality Caravan
Double doors marble floors naked hoes around me
Everytime I'm comin out, niggas they wanna sign me
Got the Lil' Will diamond grillers ??
Blaze in the Benz and you can't forget Den-Den
Boobie diamond Ruby's, I'm watchin on a movie
Drop the top it's cotton, and you know I'm in a jacuzzi
Bourban and I'm swervin, man it's gettin hot
My last name Lemmon, drive my tight'um off the lot, David Taylor

Chorus

(Hawk)
I hit the highway
Everything's my way, I par-le
Everyday all day, ain't no way
Boys can't stop as i slide through your neighborhood
Chop chop chop, headed straight to the top
I only play to win -- bout to close up shop
Showstoppin dead end, pimp the pen once again
Peep the message I send
Take these levels that you devils can't comprehend
Big bout it Benz -- as I floss through the south
Big blue lens -- now whatcha talkin about?
Close yo' mouth -- as I settle all scores
Scream and shout -- my similes and metaphors
Mansion doors -- I contstantly close
All you hoes -- go and take off your clothes
Lord knows -- ain't no time to play
Commence to fuckin and-a suckin on the H.A.W.K

Chorus
