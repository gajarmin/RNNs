Ay man before these bitches was trippin
It was a task
MF 2000 a whole different story
Ay Spado, let these fuckin hoes know

(Spade)
Uh she used to be mine
See me career on recline
Now that doe low
I ain't seen her ass in eons
Walkin around talkin bout the Spade like a peon
Took you to a 3-2-5 from a neon
Baby speed on
See me wit all V on
Yeah I heard bitch you got your cheat on
You played a good game
But I got a good name
And all the hoes love me in that thing on wood frame
Ain't a damn thing changed
Bitch I'm still a baller
And my new boo appreciates when I call her
I know you ain't mad
I know you ain't sad
Yeah I heard you pregnant
But I know I ain't the dad
Your new man got a coupe
But I know it ain't the Jag
You heard about the vapors
I know you got em bad
Hey ho, why you go that route?
I had you coupin
Now rumors say your new man got you troopin
On the block sellin it from crack to hash
Disrespect you
Let a nigga smack yo ass
Bitch I wouldn't think twice about hittin yo ass
You lookin skinny
Baby is you hittin the glass?

(Bumpie Johnson)
Minkied up
10 karat pinkied up
And the whore find suites wit a slinky slut
Baby you had your chance but you chose to step
See the top off the 'vette
Jewels cold as death
Hittin me up sayin that you the best for me
Is it because the other chick havin sex wit me?
Used to think less of me
Now you pressed for me
Baby this money got you wantin to get next to me
Uh tell me what you want from Bumpie
For a dubbie, buggy, jewels, truckie
All these chicks love me
Sayin that you the one
You got to proove to me
All you doin now baby is just losein me
Thinkin diamonds and rubies
Seduce me to use me
Hate to hear me laid up
Smuttin in jacuzzis
Bitch you a groupie
Won't get none of my cash
Find another man to stand behind your slimey ass

(Chorus)
Bitch you didn't feel me then
But I know you feelin me now
Don't you think it's funny how
Tables seem to turn around
When a nigga didn't have no deal
Didn't wanna keep it real
Now that Figgas struck it rich
All yall bitches on our dick

Is the money why you wit me?
Then just leave
Only time you call me
Is when you need
It ain't that my money funny
It's just me
Yeah I like spendin money
Just for me
Whats the truth to you is a lie to me
Bitch I don't ride wit you
You ride wit me
My man had you first
You think you sly wit me
Beepin my man searchin for me
Sleep wit my man
You'll be closer to me
Everything you own you owe it to me
I bought you a shop
You chose to be dumb
I still want my money
All the heads that get done
Your jaws ain't fucked up?
All them heads that you done
Cum and all
Just for some threads that you want
You fresh out of luck bitch
I'm sayin that you done

(Gillie Da Kidd)
Yo, I met her at the clam bar
Double parked in my mans car
S-Type Jag
She had the best type ass
Conservative look, linen
I had my lower Tims on
And she was starin at the Ro
I had the gems on
I must admit, I'm lovin the waist
Chanel outfit, glasses
I'm lovin the taste
Grabbed her arm
My other hand clutched the Phillie
Said she heard about the Figgas
And had love for Gillie
I knew she was sweet
Ordered food to eat
Checked in 243, the Westin suite
Cracked the door
Bitch gave me her breast to eat
Pushed me straight to the floor
Start carressin my feet
Body like I never seen
Small waist and all butt
Type to have you fuckin up
Paid on 8th and Walnut
I'm trippin
Before the Kid write a check
I'd dance butt naked at the Vet
You gotta respect
She was married wit a hubbie
So I woke up 4 AM and left the bitch at the telly

(Chorus to end)[Dutch:] Put two trees on mine
[Spade:] Okay home boy
[Dutch:] So gangsta
[Gilly:] Gangsta!
[Spade:] An A+, we gon' stay up
[Dutch:] I said get back nigga
[Spade:] This shit gangsta

[Chorus - Dutch (Gilly)]
Ev-ery-time we drop its gangsta, so gangsta (Gangsta!)
Ev-ery-time we drop its gangsta, so gangsta
You know whats up (CMR)
You niggas can't fuck wit us (Figga for life)
Cause everytime we drop its gangsta, so gangsta

[Spade]
We gon, keep it gangsta and drop it like its hot cause
Muh-fuckas ain't gon' rock it if its not
You say them whores modelin, them whores swallowin
When you in the Bently Azure with the Halogens
We CMR so hunnies see the bling and we
Out the car screamin money ain't a ting
Throwin hundreds out the window, blowin on some endo
CL, spendin Sprewell's on the Benzo

[Gilly]
I never claim to be the toughest or the hardest nigga
But you know I ain't the softest nigga
What you want a coffin nigga?
Philly baller like A.I., I stay fly
Hit a nigga with three, but not from the key
From the Desert E hand gat
You get your mans clapped (when?)
When I pop up on his ass like anthrax
So who you ridin with? And who you slidin with?
If it ain't the Kid and them bitch get ridda him
I'm so gangsta!

[Chorus]

[Chops]
You catch Dirty at the dice game
Bets hittin the concrete
When the bricks and bones meet
Jags gettin new sneaks
Chrome dip size 20 on the feet
Plus the name gettin stiched in the Coach butter seats
Where I'm from we get tossed birds, never cross words
Act tough get your wig bust with the Mossberg
Philly nigga, four stars, I'm high rank
Played the pie, now I grind sellin denk countin bank nigga

[Dutch]
If you ain't got shit
Lemme here you scream life is a bitch (its a bitch)
If you ever hadda take a niggas shit (gimme that shit!)
Put your gun in the air and wave it (yeah)
Yeah, yeah like that
Man I ain't listen to pop but I listen to Pac
Once again its Dutchman with Spade to the you-know
You know you know what you don't want
Dutchman sittin in your crib with the pump bitch!

[Chorus]

[Ab Liva]
Its beautiful when gangstas meet
See I had to learn, watch craw slow
Gangsta to the crossroads
I speak in codes
Got the foresight for soft white
The yay brighter than them Porsche lights
(With poor sight) Thugs fall victim to the jakes
On my block (was on all night like a portch light)
You niggas is borin, I'm snorin, ignorin
Your cars' on Drexlers, my shit on Jordans
Two three, who we, heartfelt
I riddle my life over looseleaf, heartfelt
I scribble my life over looseleaf, thugs relate
Bout to break the thin line between love and hate
Thugs debate, Glocks show, caskets come
Shots blow past, half masked, flags is up
Drop low fast, too late, gasp it up
So gangsta how I hit you bastards up

[Chorus x2 (to fade)]( gillie )
Yo they found me .. cut me ground me
Made me powder .. say I'm expected across seas in an hour
I was born in columbia they shippin me out
Package tight so them dogs ain't sniffin me out

( spade )
But me I ain't changed I'm a household name
Considered common but play a major part in the game
People keep me in cabinage, drawers and shells
And say I do magic turn four into twelve

( gillie )
I'm transported cross borders on planes and boats
I dont know my name yet but there calln me coke
I'm usually around the waist and in the line in the coats
So they can sneak me past customs and the guards dont bust 'em

( spade )
And I heard about that cat called coke and I dont trust 'em
Cuz all the other dudes I know be scared to touch 'em
They say he from columbia .. they want us to meet
They must know how I react when I'm under the heat

( chorus ) 2x
I'm the coke .. you know you can't move wit out me
So wut .. I'm da cut you gone loose wit out me
But I'ma drug dealers dream
But I'm da one dat make the drug dealer mo' cream
Nigga .. lets make a team

( gillie )
They got me in .. they passin me out, city to suburbs
State to state .. they put me on china plates
Chop me up .. make me look like shake then call me weight
And now they wanna introduce me to this kid bake

( spade )
O0o you da cat coke that I heard about
From word of mouth, put us in the pot stirred us out
I gotta admit .. man I like this guy
They cooked us up into a pie allowed us to dry
When together we frew from 20 to 25

( gillie )
This kid bake is live ..
Now we headin to the hood
To dem niggas on da corners dat be up to no good
This one cat .. he picked me up in a benz
He brought me, bake and like 11 of my friends
We headed to the kitchen .. shit we at it again

( spade )
And it was magic again
I mean we jus got larger
I got stronger .. coke strength got smaller
Put us in the hands of these niggas dey call ballas
And hustlers .. and fiends on the streets they all lustas

( chorus ) 2x

( spade )
Me and dope is like brothas
( gillie )
Da fiends they all loved us

Verse 1 (Spade)
Yo listen here playboy we gone get that dough

Cats sayin, "Spade where you get that flow?"
Smoke to the sky when I hit that dro
Three to the five as we skip that four
What you need to know where my crib at for?
I know cats be on some slimy shit
And they be floggin in them whips we had in '96
And when Tone died it left my mind in a twist
Yeah that's us at the bar with the Don and the Cris
And I promise you this
Blow up I'm gone do that
5 coupe land on the lot royal blue that
Real dog never drop soil where his food at
Don't shit where you eat
And don't spit if you weak (I don't feel like hearing it)
New Benz driver's kick matchin feet
Platinum on the chain Alaskan in the piece
Yeah that's us

(Chorus)

Verse 2 (Ab Live)
Smooth thug with the good hair
Mami wanna holla now
Oh he Live?

(Chorus)

Verse 3 (Gillie)
I look at us and look at yall

They love Gillie I ain't writin the checks
Black out at the Phillies' game jewelry light up the Vet
Yeah that's us ballin in them cars and them jeeps
And that's us if you ain't seen your broad in a week
A young blue chip, too slick, move bricks
Ooze spit two clips out the new 6
You won't do shit
A lot of women but I really like a few chicks
Vivrant things like Q-tip
Playa I do this
Cats know I smoke so I ain't got no lungs
And you cats wanna smoke but yall ain't got no ones
All the thugs scream drama ain't got no guns
Ain't satisfied till ya momma ain't got no sons
Never messin' with them chicks in them 5-0-1's
You best believe its icey if I own one, shit

(Chorus)

MF future of the rap game
Yeah that's us at the bar

If you lookin around and you wonder why its like it is its cause of  us
So either roll over or get rolled over, playboy
That's the way its gonna be in 2000
You know they gonna feel this one(mixed and scratched sample)
P-H-I-L-L-Y, North, West, Southwest South side
P-H-I-L-L-Y, Give it to them bitches and niggas who stay fly

[Verse 1 - Beanie]
You know my flavor
Low linen double s gators
Jeans ripped on purpose
Moure written in cursive
Tool shirt with the belt to match
Four pound send shots through your Celtics cap
You know me, B. Sigel with that lethal spit
Fuck around and get your people hit
Tek 22 see through clip
Niggas know who I creep through with
Major niggas, you know, Major Figgas
I roll them corners and drop four birds with four words
Niggas get the flippin
Before niggas get the missin
I'm known for that duct tape, rope and pistol whippin
Back door, dope and coke from when boat ship in
It ain't no tellin what I do for a trunk of crack
Told y'all dudes that I'm quick to trunk a cat
You know my tools, either the pump or the mac
Catch me at your kids school playin Uncle Mac

[Verse 2 - Journ]
Yo what you think I couldn't shine on you cause your chain glistenin?
When they said the name Journalist you wasn't listenin
Change the condition of the Range that you sittin in
Pull out the pistol in, shoot out your Michelins
Leave you in your boy Rover with a poor odor
Journ, slim bulldozer with the broad shoulders
Week into your tour I'ma call your broad over
Before she hit the salon, bustin the whore rollers
You tryin to play the fast role
Dawg you an ass hole
Your chick gave me your cock, cigar and your bath robe
Test the circle, beat you till your purple
Then have my man search you from your hat to your workboots
Fam fuck you and the cats that co signed you
Catch you while you on your Ducotti and clothesline you
Tryin to cop a spot like the one they shot Tony in
Journalist for Doo Wop, the true Mitronian

[Bridge - Dutch]
P-H-I-L-L-Y
Why should we tell y'all why?
Where why and how we ride?
P-H-I-L-L-Y

[Verse 3 - Gillie]
A'yo rap cancer, flow sick I flow iller
My goal is to move more units than Thriller
Its G-D-K slash God damn killer
Slash Gillie Da Kid
Nigga can I live?
Guns keep, never get rid
Did a minor bid
Only for one week
A Thug let his gun speak
Real player, never fall in love with a freak
My raps is like crack, I distribute to the street
O's in the form of flows, China Whyte
You say I'm okay, your chick think I'm dynamite
She love my flow, she love my clothes
When it come to them, I'm like Snoop "I don't love them hoes"
See my niggas cop cars, watch flooded with stones
Knowin that my voice'll probly sell a million alone
Nigga bout robbin Gillie? Un uh, pullin the chrome
Aimin straight at your face then I'm killin you holmes

[Verse 4 - Dutch]
MF it don't get no realer than that
See the jails got my niggas I'm takin em back
Serve em out for any smoker who got taste for the crack
I'm takin it all, whether its a safe or a pack
I'm layin you down, whether its a eight or a mac
See I love to bust guns, but I hated the sound
And I muzzled em up dawg just to quiet em down
Where my West coast niggas at? Shots to the ground
Where my East coast niggas at? Safes's and pounds
I got, pimp in my walk nigga, pimp in my talk
Dawg I bust you niggas first before my players fall
I'm already called it quits, don't want it in no more
Put the gun to my head, blaow say fuck it all
You can't get no women player, they don't want a war
You can't sell no cane dawg, you too damn soft
Me I sell it all player, from the hard to soft
You just a boss player, tryin'a roll with boss

[Bridge]

[Verse 5 - Bump]
Seems like you don't know how much life is left
Till I revolve six in your chest
Start at your vest
Send you into cardiac arrest
Chokin, weezin
What gave you the idea that Bump wasn't squeezin
Bump ain't packin? Bump ain't holdin?
Bump won't put it in your face leave it swolen?
Do it for the paper, yeah players hate my hustle
Young nigga, chrome 38 I hate to tussle
Six hundred platinum skates from the muscle
Keep work on the strip, shit I live to the hustle
Step my game up to a bird from a bundle
Football shit, cook wrong nigga fumble
Blocks on the shoes, twelve on the wheel
Cris till I spit in the club with the steel
I hope you niggas thinkin Bump J won't kill
You be dead on arrival

God damn playa I love being a gangsta!
I got ah million dollar face and uh million smile
And uh million dollar flow and ah million dollar style
And in my lifetime I thought a million worth of vowels
Cats thinking I'm sweet I ain't been killin' in a while
I heard a lot of cats rhyme I ain't feel one in a while
They must be all broke they ain't been wheelin' in a while
Yo it's hectic man, I bring the pain like I'm Method Man
Respect it man, when the Spade got the tech in hand
My nigga G.D.K hooked up wit a Texas Klan
Now when we swerve, hittin' nerve, bend a Lexus Land
Respect the fam or ya ass be out
And for sure in them Bentley Azores we go the Classy routes
And when that cash be out we down South
With cats that sell crack gold caps in they mouth
Mom kick me to da curve for holdin' crack in the house
Since it's real in the field, keep the steel in the wheel
Niggas killin at will
First meal, I'mma chill, yeah I promised
But I ain't getting paid for being honest
I'm gonna break that, rap or drug money I gots to make that
Opportunity knock at the door I got to take that
One in ya face and throw your body where the lake at
It's Spado creepin' where yo yayo and yo cake at
Charismatic flow but I get nasty where the break at
Real Philly nigga put in work like I'm work AWAC
Type voice that can't even be heard on them Adacs
Your hoes and mines Phonelines saying play dat
This the "Payback" but naw I ain't Mel Gibson
9 to 5 I'm cooking up pies in Hells kitchen
On a jail mission, run around doing stupid shit
Doing sticks easy on some ruthless shit
Now I'm cheesy toe the whip on some ruthless shit
Man I'm a thug till' I'm old on some toothless shit

(Chorus)
See the expression on they face when we step in the place
God damn playa I love being a gangsta!

Henny and weed dizzy
Chickens like who is he
Lenin sittin on tan butter
Shit I'm getting funny stares from my man mothers
Thousands grams of butter
Bounce that sick in the kitchen cold cook
Always bring the right amount back
Haters doubted that
I ever would blow to here bout' me out in places
And never could go
Nights guzzuling mo'
The ice smothers my ro'
Got advance money top pies
Double the dough
6 double the O
Push me if you want
I know your style you a bitch without the pussy in front
Niggas approach me on the streets I'm like what do you want
No I can't get a deal
Can split you a meal
No you can't play passenger in my wheel
Niggas coppin' GS3's with tore paper
Why not the biggest one you ain't have full paper
You niggas maybe dough, but I'm for shore paper
I love being a gangsta

20 inches on the wheels Candy paint
You want MF to stop
Man we can't, man we ain't
I love being the shit damn I stink!
It's Dutchy man playboy want you think
From the watch to the link
And if you don't know by now then you ain't
Uh I'mma gangsta

Chorus

(Gillie Da Kid)
Blaze the steel
MF with the rays to kill
Slow flow murderers Ducth,Spade and Gill
Who better
Ya'll don't know the smell of that new leather
The V twizzy
Henny and weed dizzy
Chickens like who is he
Lenin sittin on tan butter
Shit I'm getting funny stares from my man mothers
Thousands grams of butter
Bounce that sick in the kitchen cold cook
Always bring the right amount back
Haters doubted that
I ever would blow to here bout' me out in places
And never could go
Nights guzzuling mo'
The ice smothers my ro'
Got advance money top pies
Double the dough
6 double the O
Push me if you want
I know your style you a bitch without the pussy in front
Niggas approach me on the streets I'm like what do you want
No I can't get a deal
Can split you a meal
No you can't play passenger in my wheel
Niggas coppin' GS3's with tore paper
Why not the biggest one you ain't have full paper
You niggas maybe dough, but I'm for shore paper
I love being a gangsta

(Chorus)(mixed and scratched sample)
P-H-I-L-L-Y, North, West, Southwest South side
P-H-I-L-L-Y, Give it to them bitches and niggas who stay fly

[Verse 1 - Beanie]
You know my flavor
Low linen double s gators
Jeans ripped on purpose
Moure written in cursive
Tool shirt with the belt to match
Four pound send shots through your Celtics cap
You know me, B. Sigel with that lethal spit
Fuck around and get your people hit
Tek 22 see through clip
Niggas know who I creep through with
Major niggas, you know, Major Figgas
I roll them corners and drop four birds with four words
Niggas get the flippin
Before niggas get the missin
I'm known for that duct tape, rope and pistol whippin
Back door, dope and coke from when boat ship in
It ain't no tellin what I do for a trunk of crack
Told y'all dudes that I'm quick to trunk a cat
You know my tools, either the pump or the mac
Catch me at your kids school playin Uncle Mac

[Verse 2 - Journ]
Yo what you think I couldn't shine on you cause your chain glistenin?
When they said the name Journalist you wasn't listenin
Change the condition of the Range that you sittin in
Pull out the pistol in, shoot out your Michelins
Leave you in your boy Rover with a poor odor
Journ, slim bulldozer with the broad shoulders
Week into your tour I'ma call your broad over
Before she hit the salon, bustin the whore rollers
You tryin to play the fast role
Dawg you an ass hole
Your chick gave me your cock, cigar and your bath robe
Test the circle, beat you till your purple
Then have my man search you from your hat to your workboots
Fam fuck you and the cats that co signed you
Catch you while you on your Ducotti and clothesline you
Tryin to cop a spot like the one they shot Tony in
Journalist for Doo Wop, the true Mitronian

[Bridge - Dutch]
P-H-I-L-L-Y
Why should we tell y'all why?
Where why and how we ride?
P-H-I-L-L-Y

[Verse 3 - Gillie]
A'yo rap cancer, flow sick I flow iller
My goal is to move more units than Thriller
Its G-D-K slash God damn killer
Slash Gillie Da Kid
Nigga can I live?
Guns keep, never get rid
Did a minor bid
Only for one week
A Thug let his gun speak
Real player, never fall in love with a freak
My raps is like crack, I distribute to the street
O's in the form of flows, China Whyte
You say I'm okay, your chick think I'm dynamite
She love my flow, she love my clothes
When it come to them, I'm like Snoop "I don't love them hoes"
See my niggas cop cars, watch flooded with stones
Knowin that my voice'll probly sell a million alone
Nigga bout robbin Gillie? Un uh, pullin the chrome
Aimin straight at your face then I'm killin you holmes

[Verse 4 - Dutch]
MF it don't get no realer than that
See the jails got my niggas I'm takin em back
Serve em out for any smoker who got taste for the crack
I'm takin it all, whether its a safe or a pack
I'm layin you down, whether its a eight or a mac
See I love to bust guns, but I hated the sound
And I muzzled em up dawg just to quiet em down
Where my West coast niggas at? Shots to the ground
Where my East coast niggas at? Safes's and pounds
I got, pimp in my walk nigga, pimp in my talk
Dawg I bust you niggas first before my players fall
I'm already called it quits, don't want it in no more
Put the gun to my head, blaow say fuck it all
You can't get no women player, they don't want a war
You can't sell no cane dawg, you too damn soft
Me I sell it all player, from the hard to soft
You just a boss player, tryin'a roll with boss

[Bridge]

[Verse 5 - Bump]
Seems like you don't know how much life is left
Till I revolve six in your chest
Start at your vest
Send you into cardiac arrest
Chokin, weezin
What gave you the idea that Bump wasn't squeezin
Bump ain't packin? Bump ain't holdin?
Bump won't put it in your face leave it swolen?
Do it for the paper, yeah players hate my hustle
Young nigga, chrome 38 I hate to tussle
Six hundred platinum skates from the muscle
Keep work on the strip, shit I live to the hustle
Step my game up to a bird from a bundle
Football shit, cook wrong nigga fumble
Blocks on the shoes, twelve on the wheel
Cris till I spit in the club with the steel
I hope you niggas thinkin Bump J won't kill

[Chorus]

[Ab Liva]
Its beautiful when gangstas meet
See I had to learn, watch craw slow
Gangsta to the crossroads
I speak in codes
Got the foresight for soft white
The yay brighter than them Porsche lights
(With poor sight) Thugs fall victim to the jakes
On my block (was on all night like a portch light)
You niggas is borin, I'm snorin, ignorin
Your cars' on Drexlers, my shit on Jordans
Two three, who we, heartfelt
I riddle my life over looseleaf, heartfelt
I scribble my life over looseleaf, thugs relate
Bout to break the thin line between love and hate
Thugs debate, Glocks show, caskets come
Shots blow past, half masked, flags is up
Drop low fast, too late, gasp it up
So gangsta how I hit you bastards up

[Chorus x2 (to fade)]( gillie )
Yo they found me .. cut me ground me
Made me powder .. say I'm expected across seas in an hour
I was born in columbia they shippin me out
Package tight so them dogs ain't sniffin me out

( spade )
But me I ain't changed I'm a household name
Considered common but play a major part in the game
People keep me in cabinage, drawers and shells
And say I do magic turn four into twelve

( gillie )
I'm transported cross borders on planes and boats
I dont know my name yet but there calln me coke
I'm usually around the waist and in the line in the coats
So they can sneak me past customs and the guards dont bust 'em

( spade )
And I heard about that cat called coke and I dont trust 'em
Cuz all the other dudes I know be scared to touch 'em
They say he from columbia .. they want us to meet
They must know how I react when I'm under the heat

( chorus ) 2x
I'm the coke .. you know you can't move wit out me
So wut .. I'm da cut you gone loose wit out me
But I'ma drug dealers dream
But I'm da one dat make the drug dealer mo' cream
Nigga .. lets make a team

( gillie )
They got me in .. they passin me out, city to suburbs
State to state .. they put me on china plates
Chop me up .. make me look like shake then call me weight
And now they wanna introduce me to this kid bake

( spade )
O0o you da cat coke that I heard about
From word of mouth, put us in the pot stirred us out

They cooked us up into a pie allowed us to dry
When together we frew from 20 to 25

( gillie )
This kid bake is live ..
Now we headin to the hood
To dem niggas on da corners dat be up to no good
This one cat .. he picked me up in a benz
He brought me, bake and like 11 of my friends
We headed to the kitchen .. shit we at it again

( spade )
And it was magic again
I mean we jus got larger
I got stronger .. coke strength got smaller
Put us in the hands of these niggas dey call ballas
And hustlers .. and fiends on the streets they all lustas

( chorus ) 2x

( spade )
Me and dope is like brothas

Da fiends they all loved us

Cats know I smoke so I ain't got no lungs
And you cats wanna smoke but yall ain't got no ones
All the thugs scream drama ain't got no guns

Eleven karats on the chest
And it's all in bigettes

Walkin around talkin bout the Spade like a peon
Took you to a 3-2-5 from a neon
Baby speed on

Yeah I heard bitch you got your cheat on
You played a good game
But I got a good name
And all the hoes love me in that thing on wood frame
Ain't a damn thing changed
Bitch I'm still a baller
And my new boo appreciates when I call her
I know you ain't mad
I know you ain't sad
Yeah I heard you pregnant
But I know I ain't the dad
Your new man got a coupe
But I know it ain't the Jag
You heard about the vapors
I know you got em bad
Hey ho, why you go that route?
I had you coupin
Now rumors say your new man got you troopin
On the block sellin it from crack to hash
Disrespect you
Let a nigga smack yo ass
Bitch I wouldn't think twice about hittin yo ass
You lookin skinny
Baby is you hittin the glass?

(Bumpie Johnson)
Minkied up
10 karat pinkied up
And the whore find suites wit a slinky slut
Baby you had your chance but you chose to step
See the top off the 'vette
Jewels cold as death
Hittin me up sayin that you the best for me
Is it because the other chick havin sex wit me?
Used to think less of me
Now you pressed for me
Baby this money got you wantin to get next to me
Uh tell me what you want from Bumpie
For a dubbie, buggy, jewels, truckie
All these chicks love me
Sayin that you the one
You got to proove to me
All you doin now baby is just losein me
Thinkin diamonds and rubies
Seduce me to use me
Hate to hear me laid up
Smuttin in jacuzzis
Bitch you a groupie
Won't get none of my cash
Find another man to stand behind your slimey ass

(Chorus)
Bitch you didn't feel me then
But I know you feelin me now
Don't you think it's funny how
Tables seem to turn around
When a nigga didn't have no deal
Didn't wanna keep it real
Now that Figgas struck it rich
All yall bitches on our dick

Is the money why you wit me?
Then just leave
Only time you call me
Is when you need
It ain't that my money funny
It's just me
Yeah I like spendin money
Just for me
Whats the truth to you is a lie to me
Bitch I don't ride wit you
You ride wit me
My man had you first
You think you sly wit me
Beepin my man searchin for me
Sleep wit my man
You'll be closer to me
Everything you own you owe it to me
I bought you a shop
You chose to be dumb
I still want my money
All the heads that get done
Your jaws ain't fucked up?
All them heads that you done
Cum and all
Just for some threads that you want
You fresh out of luck bitch
I'm sayin that you done

(Gillie Da Kidd)
Yo, I met her at the clam bar
Double parked in my mans car
S-Type Jag
She had the best type ass
Conservative look, linen
I had my lower Tims on
And she was starin at the Ro
I had the gems on
I must admit, I'm lovin the waist
Chanel outfit, glasses
I'm lovin the taste
Grabbed her arm
My other hand clutched the Phillie
Said she heard about the Figgas
And had love for Gillie
I knew she was sweet
Ordered food to eat
Checked in 243, the Westin suite
Cracked the door
Bitch gave me her breast to eat
Pushed me straight to the floor
Start carressin my feet
Body like I never seen
Small waist and all butt
Type to have you fuckin up
Paid on 8th and Walnut
I'm trippin
Before the Kid write a check
I'd dance butt naked at the Vet
You gotta respect
She was married wit a hubbie
So I woke up 4 AM and left the bitch at the telly

(Chorus to end)
