(intro)
Where you at? Where you at?... Yeah

Now where you at, where you at? (x4)

(chorus)
It's really real, the way I'm feelin' right now
At 5 o'clock in the mornin-a
The crack of dawn-in-a (x4)

(verse 1)
It's really real, when I feel the way that I do right now
I see all my brothers underground
Pushing up daisies, man, it amazes me
That you can't see where you gonna be
A statistic, everybody's gon' call ballistic
If you had a good day, damn, I must have missed it
Cause you mad at the Universe, going to hell with everybody else
Cause you want your own first
I got the urge to let you in on a little secret
Cause you keep dying if I keep it
All the killing that you're feeling is from within
For the copper check the color of your skin
Why lie? I couldn't try even if I had to
Born with the bullet-proof vest when I had you
A black woman trying to get through to the few
So you can live the next crew

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Wella, Mr. Black Man tell me where you're heading
The last few years I watched while you were sheading
Pounds and pounds on growth for the population
Soon we won't be able to have a strong black nation
A shooting here, a stab there will it ever stop
Cause now you're dying from the dose of the crack rock
I'm just a Nubian Queen that needs a king to stand strong
And try to press on
It's not white man's finger on the trigger
Car-jacks, drive-by's, callin' each other "nigga"
I'm not here to scold but rather shape n' mold
A young black mind that won't live to grow old
Cause you're fronting smoking on the blunt and
Down with your friends cause you think you're making ends, but you're not
And it's the truth of the matter
Your brother gettin' skinny, cause you want your pockets fatter

(chorus)

(verse 3)
It ain't no lie, I'm sick and tired, I feel the fire
So baby can you grab my hand so I can take you higher
Coz I've seen you sinkin'. so get your mind to thinkin'
But all of that shit you did has got you shrinkin' low
The moves that you made, got your faith in the wrong direction
But some love and affection would change that
With the quick-mix, could this sickness
Is spreadin' so damn fast, a black major can't last
But what can I do, a strong black woman
Give you loving and affection keep you focused when you come in
Cause it's real, I've got to find out how you feel
To keep your shit fixed, and your hands up on the ceil' (yeah yeah)

(chorus)

Now where you at?
Now are you a criminal? (repeat)

A where you at, where you at? (x4)

(chorus)(chorus)
(Said I'm lookin' for the good stuff)
Bald head, strong back and not a weak mind
Bald head, strong back and not a weak mind
Bald head, strong back and not a weak mind
Bald head, strong back and not a weak mind x2

(verse 1) (sung)
Now I don't have no time, to feed you no fake lines
I only want to see a smile upon your face
'Coz the things you seem to do, keep me runing back to you
But it seems your love won't stay in just one place

(rapping)
'Coz see I'm lookin for the good stuff, ooh and boy you got it wit'cha
Where your girlfriiend at si I can smack her out the picture
Cruisin in your Benz-os sippin' on a forty
Lookin' all sweet but your nature is naughty
Pull on the side for the ready chit-chatter
In the back of my mind I'm thinkin' sex on the platter
Give me the seven digits and I don't want no beeper
Just a girlfriend 'coz cheaper ain't a keeper

(chorus)

(verse 2)
It's like look but don't touch because you're lookin' so scandalous
But the man is so vicious and delicious
I wish this one time that I could have a taste
Without a trace be conspicuos the chase is so ridiculous
I see stars when you come around 'coz you got the Boom from the underground
Smooth move without a sound
Just one call and then I'm droppin' my drawers
Like a boo-boo but I won't start it off
'Coz-uh, ain't nothing like a strong hung brother
To give you what you want in and out under the cover
And your so smooth I see you in my dreams
In my erotic thoughts your doin' wild things, Mr Good Stuff

(chorus)

Aahhh, Mr Good Stuff..., in the 95, Aahhh...
Strong backs, bald heads, no weak minds

(chorus)

(verse 3)
I said hey, young lover with your smile so fine
Now with the slick ass style and the glitter i your eye
I seen you chillin' on occasions
And even a sister with the slickest persuasions could amaze ya
I need another to touch me, and-uh
All through the lovin' know he won't rush me
Even if it takes all night
To the caress of his lips pressed on my chest
(take your time baby)
Don't hide from me Mr Right, you're lookin' for the wrong ones
Scheamin' on an oaky dope and lookin' for the small funds
But a bank roll ain't what I'm after
I'm lookin' to get caught up in your raptures
So don't waste your time on a nickle and no dime
'Coz if you do baby, yeah you gonna pay a fine
In a big way, 'coz you might get dissed
Why you losin' sleep about the lover that you missed
Mr Good Stuff

(chorus till fade...)(intro)
This track, is by no means, to disrespect, you men and women in blue, that's
True...
But you know there are a few of you out there...
That's just fuckin' it up for everybody

(verse 1)
I see the red lights flashing, damn here they come, what did I do?
I gotta think about what's already done so I'm pulling over
My Range Rover, windows tinted
Got my hands on the wheel while they flashin lights in here
What you lookin' for is underneath your nose
If you take a look around, while you pattin' down my clothes
But it never fails, you got me payin' bail
While the true bad boys is on the streets raisin' hell
I couldn't see it, I couldn't be it, another dirty cop
How the hell is the crime rate rise gonna stop
Transactions, his-a-action, you keep passin'
Every damn day cause I see it around my way
You think you true, but who's gonna win or lose in this crime game
Niggas on the street, doin' dirt through the time change
You writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

Chorus()
Through my window
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue...
(Cause I can see you comin', I can see you comin') x2

(verse 2)
Mr Officer, Mr Occifer
Where the hell are you at when I be callin' ya?
Nickle and dimin' passin the time in a doughnut shop
Why don't your ass be a real cop?
Ain't no stayin' at the borders, check your sons and daughters
The judges don't avenge us cause their ass is out of order
I can't plead my case, but when I don't need you
Your ass is in my face sayin' I see you
But I can see you too, and everything you do
Swinging your night stick, Mr man in blue
Yeah, you writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Now raise your right hand, and your oath, now what's your motto
To break all the rules that your ass is 'sposed to follow
That right hood on your head is just invisible
And when I dig deep, yeah it all gets political
Cause drug orders come from the borders not from the streets
Ships and planes, check the first class seats
But you still pull me over, put your foot on my neck
Hold me down till I stop breathin', said that I flex
But everything must change
Nothing stays the same, so I'ma see that you have your day
When the shit hits the fan and starts to spray
Find my tape, stick it in and then push play
Yeah, this is your foretold warning
And you know I'm getting practise from the deserts that I'm storming
Yeah, you writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

(chorus)

Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue...
(Cause I can see you comin', I can see you comin')
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue...
(Cause I can see you comin', I can see you comin')...(chorus)
Crab rappers!, You need to shut your mouth you don't want none
You need to shut your mouth you don't want none...

(verse 1)
Yo! stoned is the wake of the walk, I know you feel me
My crew might be sway, yo, but I can see you clearly
Smilin', while you robbin' me for my stylin'
You need to stop, before you find your grave on Long Island
I'm pilin', blowin' stacks, closin' racks
It's all Non here, over ruffneck tracks
I'm on a mission, dismissing, all that ass kissin'
Before my lyrics burn a hole in your neck, that's what I'm wishing
I'm tapping spines along with your mind
Cause I made you feel good when I rocked your whole 'hood
My soul run deep, like a crack in the street
I keep it real, so you can feel, my true skills
100%, like Absolute, Get gin, you wanna blend with the new trend
I got you swaying, whats to say..., You never felt the really real
Let me run a tab, and let your ass pay the bill

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Now wait a minute, hold up, you still wanna test me
I'm spraying out lyrics like water from a jet-ski
Oh no! You're still not stepping
Towards the same mic I rocked as soon as I crept in
Cause I been doing this thing for a whole lot longer
And if you wanna rock the spot, you better funk stronger
Keep on, and I'ma have to unleash
The true funk baby that ain't nothing but a beast
You need practise. then again, it ain't worth it
My brain is a computer so that means I'm word perfect
Blowin' through the 'hood, just cold knockin' spots off
Get nothing but a chicken and Nonchalant's got your hot sauce
Play your cards right now you sweat the inner city
I got all the diamonds so hard so plus I got the kitty
You still wanna test me, you must be gun simple son
I kick a funky flow like a bowl of rolled chilli's

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Now put your mind on the matter, to call your next batter
I'm knockin' home runs in your ass so what's the matter
A' take your time cause the funky rhyme blow your mind
Strut my stuff cause I'm so tuff, and hard to find
In this maze of amazement I got you cornered
Cut your dimes and your nickels cause you know your money's spent
Meanwhile back at the ranch, take a chance
On this funky head bob that's gonna make you dance
Now even the funky chickens who can make up on the twist came in
But do the chicken with the twist and you can blend
Put your eyes on the prize, we gonna take a ride
So deep in your soul you got tears in your eyes
You blinded by the light, now can you see me
Cause I know that you feel me cause I'm cutting like a knife
With the phife, you flow is so weak I call your punk
You starvin' for some soul, yo, you need to bite a chunk

(chorus)(intro)
Sexy, brown, brother, sexy, brown, brother

(verse 1)
Said I'm lookin' for brains, good looks and skills
Step on up if you think you fit the bill
I know what you look like but looks can be decieving
Let me tap the brain so I can justify the reason
Why I'm callin' your name in my sleep
Why I memorised the tag number on your jeep
I think your skills is something that I wanna check
Judging by your looks and your thighs when you flex
I been askin' around tryin' to figure what to do
I know all the names of the fellas in your crew
I ain't playin' no game I'm for real
The cards is on the table so I think you know the deal
I bet you if I got closer you wouldn't doubt it
Everything would be clear and not clouded
But I don't want to get deep yet
I wanna make you feel all the love you can get, yeah

(chorus)
You're lookin' good to me
You're lookin' good to me
You're lookin' good to me
You're lookin' good to me (w/ ad libs)

(verse 2)
I gotta come correct, make it clear, state me claim
I want you to know you're drivin' me insane
Now I don't wanna press, but I must confess
That it won't take long 'fore the lifting of the dress
But that's the ways, damn that I know you're fine
Plus I gotta know that you're gonna be mine
But check this out, do you have any kids?
Even though, I gotta say I wouldn't mind if you did
But with the kids comes the ex-girlfriend
And then I wanna know, is she still tryin' to blend?
Cause I ain't one to be fightin' in the streets
Tryin' to duck flyin' bottles every time that we meet (from a dumb ass
Bitch)
So tell me when the coast is clear so I can get near
Fell your soft lips when you whisper in my ear
Cause ain't no reason to hide when you ride
I wanna scream your name when you holding me tight (in the middle of the
Night) yeah

(chorus)

(verse 3)
So what's up? Can we do this or not?
I'm ready to give eveything that I got
I'm waitin' on you to make the next move
But I hope you move quick or you're gonna knock the groove
The green lights flashin ready, set, go!
Everything I think you need, yeah you know
Sexy little buggar, heart strings tugger
Tell me where she at cause I wanna thank your mother
I don't give a damn about the rules that I'm breakin'
Step onto your face, straight up with no fakin'
You're killing me softly so I'm pressed for time
Why don't you just say that you're gonna be mine
Cause ain't no other in the world for you lover
And that's what you are, a sexy brown brother
I'm keepin' it real so you know how I feel
Cause I want to be with you and just chill

(chorus till fade...)Hook:
Only God knows how we'll all end up
Get so corrupt, we can't give up, we got to keep on pushing
(Keep on pushing, ain't no stopping us)
Ain't no stopping us

Bahamadia:
A child of the essence, turning degrees into perfection
My struggle is now objective to meet the rightous direction
The life lessons, but what they all about?
If I took the dolo route, and I left the people out
Non-personal connects, low-cost effects
Bound to meet my doom for regrets so I just
Put all praises down to Allah, plus the block
Pull my family ties in one big knot
Respect the divine that makes me help me ride to the top
And do a trip to a past never forgot
"Clap your hands now"

Nonchalant:
Where do I go from here, I don't know, I don't know
Till I find my past, the life I knew, the life I knew
I'm holding on to my roots cause they pulling my leaves
I traveled over seas, got 400 degrees
It's the city life, trife concock the scheme
To play apon my dreams still fulfillin' my needs
Well I don't know, whatever happened to my past
Wait I gotta think about (I don't care) how long I can last
I don't know as long as I get over my worlds most biggest fears
Cause I'm drenched in sweat for family tears
So ah, where do I go from here, I don't know
I don't know, till I find my past, the life I knew
(The life I knew) the life I knew

Hook (x2)

Yo-Yo:
All in the game a young female, so intelligent
And deep like seashells, uh, I'm from L.A. so I gotta cap to adapt
Plus interact with the black folks
And blowin' smoke ain't never been a problem
It's waking up and facing the drama
Can't let you hang, maintain, run game, pimp thangs
And roll my land cruiser like it's on Danna Danes
Uh, it's show low, the west coaster, you know
Let you boost like I'm suppose ta
"Clap your hands now"

Hook (x5)(intro - Rampage)
Yo, you ever walk up into a jam right? (uh uh, Uh uh)
Know what I'm sayin', you chillin' wit' your peoples, and y'all just hangin
Out
And somebody just spill a drink on you (Oooh)
Or, a cat just squeezed your girl's booty (What!)
Or, anything could happen (Uh uh, Uh uh)
See, this is what this song is about... you know
You gotta bring it, you gotta take it there (C'mon)
You know what I'm sayin', a lot of y'all can relate to this
You know what I'm sayin' (Yeah)
But yo, I'm gon' let my homegirl tell it, you know what I'm sayin'
How she wanna take it there, you know what I mean (Uh)

Feel me...

(verse 1 - Nonchalant)
When I stepped on the scene, the skies was black with no lights
The stage was too small for all the fly mics
Wasn't nobody sayin' nothing for getting the crowd hyped
If you ain't gon' shine don't be comin' round mics
This is life, in my my life I'm living life like I got
Twenty-four hours a day, or one night
This is it y'all, I'm bout to hit y'all
The camera's on when I risidual
I bet y'all said niggas will be gone
So where you gon' be at 5'O clock i the morn'
Gettin' your lax on or gettin' your mack on
We got one mic down with the lights still on
Who want a piece of this here, ask Sean c'mon
Got that street hype, street team hype
Don't know team like my team hype, what it seem like
My movements is gettin' faster, can't see me like Casper
I'm ghost and hit this spot from coast to coast
There was cameras, so you could not miss my damage
I rip two mics in one city, single-handed
Like a bandit, coz streets was dark with no knowledge
I said my piece then I let my action relieve
I left, I saw the light shine on the street
I was back, smack-dab in the belly of the beast
I'm about to hit the clubs with this brand-new release
Who minds like bodies with the bounce of the beat
Cause when I get on, believe it it's on
Want the meaning of my words, dig deep in my song
So baby gets on, it's all mics down with the lights still on
Who want a piece of this here ask Sean c'mon

(chorus - Rampage)
Midnight, after dark, we gonna take it there
Nonchalant in the party, she gon' take it there
If you do the wrong thing, or you say the wrong thing
Ha ha, Ha ha, we gonna take it there
We gonna take it there, we gonna take it there
Midnight, after dark we gonna take it there
Nonchalant is in the party, she gon' take it there
We gonna take it there, we gonna take it there

(verse 2 - Nonchalant)
For all you foo-els, I rock jew-els
While you cop jew-els, I drop jew-els, and do it well
Really drink champagne, while you drinkin' shan-day
You tippin' bitch scales, them just tales, now listen here
Your career... fool you wanna chance your mic
So where your action, cause I can't see the light
The camera's on, the lights is dimmed, now what's your point
Took your last mic, cause you couldn't rock the joint
Feel my venom, sweatin your palms
And any MC to disagree with me, wave your arms
Now that's all mics down with the lights still on
Who want a piece of the here ask Sean c'mon
If you got what I want, then I got what you need
If the green light, then I proceed
Your to lace it, I'm not lacin' it with basics
But all I need is basics to lace it
Cause in with my facts and figures
With more broads and gold-diggers
Painting a perfect picture for my sniper to hit her
]From a rooftop, then I makaveli like 2Pac
Still I'm non-stop, makin your body rock
Keepin' this thing hot, all these on lock
To the beat, uh, and you don't stop
C'mon to the beat, uh, and you don't stop
Take it to the streets, uh, and you don't stop, c'mon

(verse 1)
It's Saturday night, I'm on the usual standing in the long line
Waiting for my hand to be stamped so I can get mine
It's never me and who, it's always the same crew
Me with a few ends rollin' with a few friends
Fake smiles, yeah we got 'em in the pocket books
For all them frontin' niggas with the rented cars that wanna look
Music blastin' in the cars while they passin'
Mini skirts high, hoping we can catch an eye
To get a duplicate number from the last week
You rap outside but inside the club you can't speak
Talkin' bout yeah, you wanna keep it real on the phone
But got me on the list just to bone
I don't think so, let me mingle, cause I'm single
Movin' to the next man, with a drink in my hand
It's all about a good time on the weekend
Party on the Sunday when you should be sleeping

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Gin, juice and tonics, stereophonics got me open
Swayin' up the crowd make you wanna go wild so high
Can't stop Cause you feel good
When you brushin' thighs catchin' eyes off the guys when you walk by
It's Saturday night, now can you see this
And if it wasn't packed in the club it wouldn't be this good
All the fellas from the hood
Be givin' out your number all night if you could
Relaxing, no pistol packin', now what's this feelin'
Temperature's risin', bass lines through the cieling
Time to get a drink, I think champagne will do
Pass a glass to me, and slide four bottles to my crew
Why I thought you knew, that Nonchalant will make you feel right
It's past midnight, and this funk's tight
It's all about a good time on the weekend
Party on the Sunday when you should be sleeping

(chorus)

(verse 3)
]From inside to outside, fellas on the slow ride
Creepin' while they peepin' out the jeep an' damn
Yeah I feel like swayin'
And if you ever fronted all night yeah you know what I'm saying
But oh, what I'm feeling, and you know I'm willing
To give it to you like it is so you know you're dealing
With the true one, big fun, hell I 'fess
If I roll past you're house then you're best to get dressed
While I'm sippin', still trippin' off the last week
Honeyz makin' moves but they still can't catch me
Cause I'm swervin', been in ever curve an'
Checkin' out the scenen so I'm just observing
]From a 8-50, ladies are you wit' me
And if you want's to roll, holler, can you come get me
Cause it ain't no joke when we creepin'
Yeah, just party on the Sunday when you should be sleeping

(chorus)

(ad libs till fade...)

A'yo turn that shit off!!!(chorus)
I got this feelin' up inside of me that's keepin' it real
I got nothing but love inside, it's all love
Ain't down for faking, no mistaking, let me know how you feel
I got nothing but love inside, it's all love x2

(verse 1)
Hey baby I can see reflections of a life long dream
The sounds of screams got me wonderin' if my life is worth the means
I see it's only been a while, I can barley feel it's real
But niggas know about the way it goes with me, I know you know the deal
I'm only about makin' mine, brothers takin' time
And if you want to move with me then never try to fake in line
Just know how temporary life can be
And find a way to say you tryin' to live this life with me
Don't call me crazy 'coz I say the things I say when I feel them
'Coz I could never blame you for the times you said you had to feel 'em
Just get your story straight 'coz I can be a saint
Tryin' to put you in the paint, flip the shit, and try to get you back
It's never easy when you dealin' with the realsits
So just relax with us and hope to God your nervous ass don't miss
'Coz you could easily take a turn for the worst
So listen first just remember when it starts to hurt, It's all love...

(chorus)

(verse 2)
The longer you wait to turn around the longer your ass
Is gon' be pointing in the same direction, alone with no affection
I got it all if you want it come and get it
If you're thinkin' you're the first, it's all love, baby just go with it
I feel the fire when you're vibin' wit' me
That's justified by the lines if you can find them this week
I'm puttin' it down for all my sisters livin' life like this
Through all the times you thought that one was just a sight like shit
I get this crazy feelin' knowin' that your minds not here
And I can tell the way you stare up at this world you fear
But listen, ain't no need to be afraid fool, you got it made
The ground work is laid, and if you're careful then you won't get played
Just make it easy for yourself, be a soldier for yourself
If not for nothing but the love you get from nothing else
'Coz there's a reason that I'm telling you this
To keep your mind from getting wrapped up in the turns and twists, it's all
Love...

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Look, I don't want it if you can't recline
Find you're timing wit' your best self, look at you just sweatin' mine
Even if we had it all night to do, I couldn't comment on this shit
I hope you might find it too
It's automatic that the way I feel I would if you please me
Never let your mind get you thinking I'm the one who's easy
Just live your life without what you might fear
And get your hands on what you know is lookin' tight right here
It's been a minute now since we've all felt the first impression
But it seems with all the love I showed you haven't learned a single lessson
Is it that you're fellin forced to do
'Coz if it is then we can always try to talk shit through
But look I need a little feedback from your side, young
Just see if you can get with that and let's have some fun with this
Love that you've been hoping for with thoughts alone
Now get yourself up off your ass before your times all gone, it's all
Love...

(chorus)

Nonchalant, bringing all the love in the '95, Bring me on.....
Yeah, for all the felllas tryin to step, come correct baby
I'm lettin you know

(chorus)Hook:
Only God knows how we'll all end up
Get so corrupt, we can't give up, we got to keep on pushing
(Keep on pushing, ain't no stopping us)
Ain't no stopping us

Bahamadia:
A child of the essence, turning degrees into perfection
My struggle is now objective to meet the rightous direction
The life lessons, but what they all about?
If I took the dolo route, and I left the people out
Non-personal connects, low-cost effects
Bound to meet my doom for regrets so I just
Put all praises down to Allah, plus the block
Pull my family ties in one big knot
Respect the divine that makes me help me ride to the top
And do a trip to a past never forgot
"Clap your hands now"

Nonchalant:
Where do I go from here, I don't know, I don't know
Till I find my past, the life I knew, the life I knew
I'm holding on to my roots cause they pulling my leaves
I traveled over seas, got 400 degrees
It's the city life, trife concock the scheme
To play apon my dreams still fulfillin' my needs
Well I don't know, whatever happened to my past
Wait I gotta think about (I don't care) how long I can last
I don't know as long as I get over my worlds most biggest fears
Cause I'm drenched in sweat for family tears
So ah, where do I go from here, I don't know
I don't know, till I find my past, the life I knew
(The life I knew) the life I knew

Hook (x2)

Yo-Yo:
All in the game a young female, so intelligent
And deep like seashells, uh, I'm from L.A. so I gotta cap to adapt
Plus interact with the black folks
And blowin' smoke ain't never been a problem
It's waking up and facing the drama
Can't let you hang, maintain, run game, pimp thangs
And roll my land cruiser like it's on Danna Danes
Uh, it's show low, the west coaster, you know
Let you boost like I'm suppose ta
"Clap your hands now"

Hook (x5)(intro)
This track, is by no means, to disrespect, you men and women in blue, that's
True...
But you know there are a few of you out there...
That's just fuckin' it up for everybody

(verse 1)
I see the red lights flashing, damn here they come, what did I do?
I gotta think about what's already done so I'm pulling over
My Range Rover, windows tinted
Got my hands on the wheel while they flashin lights in here
What you lookin' for is underneath your nose
If you take a look around, while you pattin' down my clothes
But it never fails, you got me payin' bail
While the true bad boys is on the streets raisin' hell
I couldn't see it, I couldn't be it, another dirty cop
How the hell is the crime rate rise gonna stop
Transactions, his-a-action, you keep passin'
Every damn day cause I see it around my way
You think you true, but who's gonna win or lose in this crime game
Niggas on the street, doin' dirt through the time change
You writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

Chorus()
Through my window
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue...
(Cause I can see you comin', I can see you comin') x2

(verse 2)
Mr Officer, Mr Occifer
Where the hell are you at when I be callin' ya?
Nickle and dimin' passin the time in a doughnut shop
Why don't your ass be a real cop?
Ain't no stayin' at the borders, check your sons and daughters
The judges don't avenge us cause their ass is out of order
I can't plead my case, but when I don't need you
Your ass is in my face sayin' I see you
But I can see you too, and everything you do
Swinging your night stick, Mr man in blue
Yeah, you writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Now raise your right hand, and your oath, now what's your motto
To break all the rules that your ass is 'sposed to follow
That right hood on your head is just invisible
And when I dig deep, yeah it all gets political
Cause drug orders come from the borders not from the streets
Ships and planes, check the first class seats
But you still pull me over, put your foot on my neck
Hold me down till I stop breathin', said that I flex
But everything must change
Nothing stays the same, so I'ma see that you have your day
When the shit hits the fan and starts to spray
Find my tape, stick it in and then push play
Yeah, this is your foretold warning
And you know I'm getting practise from the deserts that I'm storming
Yeah, you writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

(chorus)

Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue...
(Cause I can see you comin', I can see you comin')
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue...
(Cause I can see you comin', I can see you comin')...(intro)
Sexy, brown, brother, sexy, brown, brother

(verse 1)
Said I'm lookin' for brains, good looks and skills
Step on up if you think you fit the bill
I know what you look like but looks can be decieving
Let me tap the brain so I can justify the reason
Why I'm callin' your name in my sleep
Why I memorised the tag number on your jeep
I think your skills is something that I wanna check
Judging by your looks and your thighs when you flex
I been askin' around tryin' to figure what to do
I know all the names of the fellas in your crew
I ain't playin' no game I'm for real
The cards is on the table so I think you know the deal
I bet you if I got closer you wouldn't doubt it
Everything would be clear and not clouded
But I don't want to get deep yet
I wanna make you feel all the love you can get, yeah

(chorus)
You're lookin' good to me
You're lookin' good to me
You're lookin' good to me
You're lookin' good to me (w/ ad libs)

(verse 2)
I gotta come correct, make it clear, state me claim
I want you to know you're drivin' me insane
Now I don't wanna press, but I must confess
That it won't take long 'fore the lifting of the dress
But that's the ways, damn that I know you're fine
Plus I gotta know that you're gonna be mine
But check this out, do you have any kids?
Even though, I gotta say I wouldn't mind if you did
But with the kids comes the ex-girlfriend
And then I wanna know, is she still tryin' to blend?
Cause I ain't one to be fightin' in the streets
Tryin' to duck flyin' bottles every time that we meet (from a dumb ass
Bitch)
So tell me when the coast is clear so I can get near
Fell your soft lips when you whisper in my ear
Cause ain't no reason to hide when you ride
I wanna scream your name when you holding me tight (in the middle of the
Night) yeah

(chorus)

(verse 3)
So what's up? Can we do this or not?
I'm ready to give eveything that I got
I'm waitin' on you to make the next move
But I hope you move quick or you're gonna knock the groove
The green lights flashin ready, set, go!
Everything I think you need, yeah you know
Sexy little buggar, heart strings tugger
Tell me where she at cause I wanna thank your mother
I don't give a damn about the rules that I'm breakin'
Step onto your face, straight up with no fakin'
You're killing me softly so I'm pressed for time
Why don't you just say that you're gonna be mine
Cause ain't no other in the world for you lover
And that's what you are, a sexy brown brother
I'm keepin' it real so you know how I feel
Cause I want to be with you and just chill

(chorus till fade...)(chorus)
(Said I'm lookin' for the good stuff)
Bald head, strong back and not a weak mind
Bald head, strong back and not a weak mind
Bald head, strong back and not a weak mind
Bald head, strong back and not a weak mind x2

(verse 1) (sung)
Now I don't have no time, to feed you no fake lines
I only want to see a smile upon your face
'Coz the things you seem to do, keep me runing back to you
But it seems your love won't stay in just one place

(rapping)
'Coz see I'm lookin for the good stuff, ooh and boy you got it wit'cha
Where your girlfriiend at si I can smack her out the picture
Cruisin in your Benz-os sippin' on a forty
Lookin' all sweet but your nature is naughty
Pull on the side for the ready chit-chatter
In the back of my mind I'm thinkin' sex on the platter
Give me the seven digits and I don't want no beeper
Just a girlfriend 'coz cheaper ain't a keeper

(chorus)

(verse 2)
It's like look but don't touch because you're lookin' so scandalous
But the man is so vicious and delicious
I wish this one time that I could have a taste
Without a trace be conspicuos the chase is so ridiculous
I see stars when you come around 'coz you got the Boom from the underground
Smooth move without a sound
Just one call and then I'm droppin' my drawers
Like a boo-boo but I won't start it off
'Coz-uh, ain't nothing like a strong hung brother
To give you what you want in and out under the cover
And your so smooth I see you in my dreams
In my erotic thoughts your doin' wild things, Mr Good Stuff

(chorus)

Aahhh, Mr Good Stuff..., in the 95, Aahhh...
Strong backs, bald heads, no weak minds

(chorus)

(verse 3)
I said hey, young lover with your smile so fine
Now with the slick ass style and the glitter i your eye
I seen you chillin' on occasions
And even a sister with the slickest persuasions could amaze ya
I need another to touch me, and-uh
All through the lovin' know he won't rush me
Even if it takes all night
To the caress of his lips pressed on my chest
(take your time baby)
Don't hide from me Mr Right, you're lookin' for the wrong ones
Scheamin' on an oaky dope and lookin' for the small funds
But a bank roll ain't what I'm after
I'm lookin' to get caught up in your raptures
So don't waste your time on a nickle and no dime
'Coz if you do baby, yeah you gonna pay a fine
In a big way, 'coz you might get dissed
Why you losin' sleep about the lover that you missed
Mr Good Stuff

(chorus till fade...)(Baphomet MC)

Yeah, there's so much shit that I'm going through
And most times I don't know what to
Do I toke on that green? *Yes*
Do I smoke dank ass weed? *Yes!*
So I'm kind of sorting out my problems... bought condoms
Got latex for that safe sex I'll never have
Keep falling in love with crazy bitches
So I'mma flame this swisher and get prop with the pen and pad
Now I feel it!
Nonchalant with my collabs 'bout to kill it
Manipulate more minds even though my mouth is still, bitch
I know what I know
And I don't feel you bruh
I've seen the water rise
Recedes when Martyrs die
I'm a loser now but wait for my fate
To take me to that place where I can blaze with the greats
And escape...

Hook

Punch out ya damn teeth x7
Punch 'em out x3

(Nonchalant)(intro - Rampage)
Yo, you ever walk up into a jam right? (uh uh, Uh uh)
Know what I'm sayin', you chillin' wit' your peoples, and y'all just hangin
Out
And somebody just spill a drink on you (Oooh)
Or, a cat just squeezed your girl's booty (What!)
Or, anything could happen (Uh uh, Uh uh)
See, this is what this song is about... you know
You gotta bring it, you gotta take it there (C'mon)
You know what I'm sayin', a lot of y'all can relate to this
You know what I'm sayin' (Yeah)
But yo, I'm gon' let my homegirl tell it, you know what I'm sayin'
How she wanna take it there, you know what I mean (Uh)

Feel me...

(verse 1 - Nonchalant)
When I stepped on the scene, the skies was black with no lights
The stage was too small for all the fly mics
Wasn't nobody sayin' nothing for getting the crowd hyped
If you ain't gon' shine don't be comin' round mics
This is life, in my my life I'm living life like I got
Twenty-four hours a day, or one night
This is it y'all, I'm bout to hit y'all
The camera's on when I risidual
I bet y'all said niggas will be gone
So where you gon' be at 5'O clock i the morn'
Gettin' your lax on or gettin' your mack on
We got one mic down with the lights still on
Who want a piece of this here, ask Sean c'mon
Got that street hype, street team hype
Don't know team like my team hype, what it seem like
My movements is gettin' faster, can't see me like Casper
I'm ghost and hit this spot from coast to coast
There was cameras, so you could not miss my damage
I rip two mics in one city, single-handed
Like a bandit, coz streets was dark with no knowledge
I said my piece then I let my action relieve
I left, I saw the light shine on the street
I was back, smack-dab in the belly of the beast
I'm about to hit the clubs with this brand-new release
Who minds like bodies with the bounce of the beat
Cause when I get on, believe it it's on
Want the meaning of my words, dig deep in my song
So baby gets on, it's all mics down with the lights still on
Who want a piece of this here ask Sean c'mon

(chorus - Rampage)
Midnight, after dark, we gonna take it there
Nonchalant in the party, she gon' take it there
If you do the wrong thing, or you say the wrong thing
Ha ha, Ha ha, we gonna take it there
We gonna take it there, we gonna take it there
Midnight, after dark we gonna take it there
Nonchalant is in the party, she gon' take it there
We gonna take it there, we gonna take it there

(verse 2 - Nonchalant)
For all you foo-els, I rock jew-els
While you cop jew-els, I drop jew-els, and do it well
Really drink champagne, while you drinkin' shan-day
You tippin' bitch scales, them just tales, now listen here
Your career... fool you wanna chance your mic
So where your action, cause I can't see the light
The camera's on, the lights is dimmed, now what's your point
Took your last mic, cause you couldn't rock the joint
Feel my venom, sweatin your palms
And any MC to disagree with me, wave your arms
Now that's all mics down with the lights still on
Who want a piece of the here ask Sean c'mon
If you got what I want, then I got what you need
If the green light, then I proceed
Your to lace it, I'm not lacin' it with basics
But all I need is basics to lace it
Cause in with my facts and figures
With more broads and gold-diggers
Painting a perfect picture for my sniper to hit her
]From a rooftop, then I makaveli like 2Pac
Still I'm non-stop, makin your body rock
Keepin' this thing hot, all these on lock
To the beat, uh, and you don't stop
C'mon to the beat, uh, and you don't stop
Take it to the streets, uh, and you don't stop, c'mon

(chorus)

(outro - Rampage)
'98... Chucklife... Flipmode... Nonchalant...
Forever... Bona-fide Platinum![Verse 1: Victor]

Soldier mentality
Still tryna battle me?
The best there ever will be
After somebody kills me
My actions are irrational
Top notch classical
My talent is immortal
But my swag is unstoppable
Still tryna get it?
But I still got it
Some doubt it
Let em' hate bruh
Cause I'm bout it
Top Notch G
V.I.C
The best in my city I'm a rap king

[Verse 2: Nonchalant]

Man I'm a shogun, top ranked general
You won't even be the best after my funeral
My rhymes are immortal
You got your five minutes of fame
I stepped in the game
And you took the walk of shame
No. 1 Mc put me in the hall of fame
The rap game wild it just got tamed
And I'm the best its not self proclaimed
And I just killed it R.I.P rap game

[Hook: Victor]

I'm the best in my city you can't be like me (aye)
Hating on cause I'm as fresh as I can be (wassup)
Wanna get wit it I'm a show you where I be (aye)
Everywhere we go we some top notch g's

[Verse 3: Zay]

I'm a top notch g, and I'm known to go off
Haters always talking man, but I just brush em' off
Cause they don't compare to me, cause my swag too classy
They don't got nun, so I stunt on em' badly
But sadly, I done took over the rap game now
So all you other rappers get back or lay down
And if you wanna start something, then get ready for a showdown
Like the Superbowl I'm a score the last touchdown

[Verse 4: FDG]

Coming last slash illest on the mic its Mr. Grey
Coming up in this rap game, making dollars in the A
Haters wanna flex all day
But they do not wanna play
With Mr. Grey AKA Mr. Make them haters pray
That I never spit like this
My lyrics sharper than a knife
I am something like a match I put this fire in your life
So I'm here to let you know, that I really am the best
You not on my level yet so never put me to the test!

[Hook]
