I got a feeling there's gonna be a riot

I don't read the newspapers because they all have ugly prints

Check me out, Check me out

Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on cause there's gonna be some shit tonight!

[Verse 1]
At the starting of the week
At summit talks you'll hear them speak
It's only Monday
Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

(come come come come come with it)
(come come come come come with it)

[Verse 2]
You could be sitting taking lunch
The news will hit you like a punch
It's only Tuesday (what time is it?)
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fool's Day (what time is it?)

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

[Interlude: Yasiin Bey]
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another....bomb, bomb, etc

Fire!
Shot!
Escalation
Devastation
Generation
Separation
Situation
Dissipation
Shot!
Another shot another shot the tender vessel pressure pop
The heart is cold the gun is hot(shot)
I'm not sure if they done or not
I'm not sure that they wanna stop
The gun is cold the blood is hot(shot)
(shot shot shot shot shot shot shot)
The hearts are weak the guns are not

[Verse 3]
You hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday (what time is it?)
You feel the shaking of the ground
A million candles burn around
Is it your birthday? (what time is it?)

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
(get tomorrow on the phone, trying to reach tomorrow, get tomorrow on the phone)
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
(I need to see tomorrow, trying to reach tomorrow)
Think tomorrow's come I think it's too late

Another day!

Bomb, bomb, etc

(tomorrow is another day)
(tomorrow is another day)

Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on cause there's gonna be some shit tonight!Producing

[Intro]
From listening to records I just knew what to do
I mainly taught myself
And, you know, I did pretty well
Except there were a few mistakes
But um, that I made, uh
That I've just recently cleared up
And I'd like to just continue to be able to express myself
As best as I can with this instrument
And I feel like i have a lot of work to do
Still, I'm a student - of the drums
And I'm also a teacher of the drums too

What makes cancer tenacious?

The moon rules the fluids
Including the inner juices of human beings
That which assimilates and feeds the body
So the crab feeds his astral plane
Assimilating and distributing all he receives
Slowly, until it becomes apart of you

I fly to the strangest lands

And I would like to able to continue
To let what is inside of me
Which is, which comes from all the music that I hear
I would like for that to come out
And it's like, it's not really me that's coming
The music's coming through me

The music's coming through meI'm a rabbit in your headlights
Scared of the spotlight
You don't come to visit
I'm stuck in this bed

Thin rubber gloves
She laughs when she's crying
She cries when she's laughing

Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...
(Away....away....away....)

I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Christian suburbanite
Washed down the toliet
Money to burn

Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...

Sample from movie Jacob's Ladder :
If you're frightened of dyin' and you're holding on...
You'll see devils tearing your life away
But...if you've made your peace
Then the devils are really angels
Freeing you from the earth.....from the earth....from the earth

Rotworms on the underground
Caught between stations
Butterfingers
I'm losing my patience

I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Christian suburbanite
You got money to burn....

Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away.....
Away, away, away
Away, away, away[Verse 1]

Sit ya ass down while I rip the tracks and spit the facts

Government officials put taps on my mobile phones
Nations overthrown hold my own on my zone
Prone to leave your dome blown poem after poem homes

Paragraph presidentPeep through the door
It seems as though the grass was much greener before
The dead life has been washed upon the sea shore
Money and greed deluded what is truly pure
And yet our flesh keeps reaching out for more

Now you're trapped
A hole in the ozone about to make the world collapse
Pollution fills the air and minds with bullet twisted facts
Midnight is now upon us people righteous laws are coming back

Don't turn your head away cause you can't get away
Your mind is lost because your spirit has been led astray
Don't ever say you gave it all if you ain't gave it all
Just fade it in the hazy purple twilight
No more time I tried to warn you all it's now approaching midnight

Panic's in the air
Some jumping out of buildings others on their knees in prayer
Some cry out to the sky and yell they aren't quite prepared
You looked god in the face and said forgive me all he did was stare

Now you can run
But where you gonna hide from all the power of the sun?
The cosmic repercussions of what human kind has done
No understanding of the fullness everything is simply one

Soon to be none again so that new life can come again
Illusions rule the mind your soul is never gonna end
So don't pretend you gave it all if you ain't gave it all
Just fade it in the hazy purple twilight
No more time I tried to warn you all it's now approaching midnight

So I bid farewell
No more good times or bad times, no more heaven no more hell
Now brace yourself for impact it's a half hour to twelve
Complete in total darkness empty space is where you're left to dwell

And all you had to do was live today for your tomorrow
But now it's over and you're drowning deep inside your sorrow
You could've led but instead you confirmed and chose to follow
So once again I bid farewell

There's only seconds left you'd like to second guess
But through your foolish ways you've literally beckoned death
So just don't say you gave it all if you ain't gave it all
Just fade it in the hazy purple twilight
No more time I tried to warn you all it's now approaching midnight1, 2, 3, 4, 5

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Tell me what the faith is, flow is on a wait list
Someone keep that shit shut, all white, no cut
I fucked up but I still came and I still reign like thunder
Everything's been done some, screamin' like we love them
But I still get what I deserve
You live, you learn, you wait your turn and you crush 'em
Fall back, all that, freshmen you're welcome
Still flip with these young hoes, still stunt with these fly clothes
Still rep for that East side where they bang toys like Tyco
I'm busy one percentin', I'm rapper Armageddon
Introducin' all that bullshit all these other niggas spittin'
Yo it's Childish, I'm wild, bitch, all white coke like scientist
Stupid busy, fuckin' with your main like a lioness
Nigga scrunch your face up, all we get it queso
All we watch is cartoons, hatin' man, that's all you
Fuckboy, that's all you, say shit when I saw you
Say shit on that online but that's fake beef like dog food
Panic room blue, too soon to be into it
These Silver Lake niggas know hood like a clitoris
Bang, bang, bang, bang, shots fired, A-Town, Empire
What you think we all about? Watchin' bitches trippin' out[Gift of Gab]
A forty ounce for breakfast gets a brother through the day
I guess I shoulda had a V8 instead; anyway
Let me contemplate my thought something back to a time
When my fridge was full of booze but in my pocket not one dime
I remember back on Willis Ave, with my ace-boom homey Mark Black
I would start the day off hearin the sound of the fo'-oh crack
I went to work blitzed, so eventually I got dissed
And caught a shocker when my supervisor said "You're dismissed"
Now as I stare at my last check now my mind is stressed and depressed
I spell relief S-T-I-D-E-S yes with a little excess less the worry
Why go job hunting today?
When I can sit back and smoke this sack and drink
And feel my problems shrink away
And by now, the rent's due in two weeks
But inside my mind that's just another problem brew can delete
I got evicted, to the point where the court martial came to my door
And said, "Get this kid: get your bags and split you don't live here no more"
And now I'm ass out; I'm so damn hungry I feel like I'm gonna pass out
I asked my brother for a handout and he hooked me
Though I knew he had doubts
And rightfully so, cause I had new shit to deal with
I'm so confused I have no control of my life I think I'll get lit
So as my problems compile, I steady smile, oh yes
Sippin on that forty ounce that's leadin me to a path of nowhere
So as I think about tomorrow, I hesitate and say:
A forty ounce for breakfast, will get me through the day..

A forty ounce for breakfast gets a brother through the day
I guess I shoulda rolled a joint up instead; anyway
Seems like everytime I start I don't know when it's time to say when
Now my mental gets all blurred and inside talk the ill-behavin
Coolin with my boys, no names need to be mentioned
At a party with some brothers I don't know I'm chillin in some E&J
With a forty O-Z to wash the shit down
And plus a lot of marijuana now I need to sit down
I can't remember the last time I was this blew out of my cranium
My ears and head begin to hum aloud as the room spun; anyway
Next thing I know I blacked out woke up with vomit all over my coat
Start talkin out my ass I can't see straight but yet I quote
And I don't know what came over me, I started dissin both my homies
That I used to freestyle with and now I'm askin them to show me
What they got not thinkin straight I don't know why I posed the challenge
Now my ego is erupting as if I was Mt. Saint Helens
Some shit was said I know I can't erase and now shit ain't the same
I wish I had just one more chance to live that day again
I strain; cause this bid was to find a true friend
And loose them to booze in my system just ain't how I'm livin
Nothin I could really say to mend up how someone else feels
And so I guess I gotta wait and see if maybe the wounds will heal
And I really didn't mean a word I said though I can't prove that
Now the only thing that I can really say is I went out
And out I went and now and then I get irate and say
A forty ounce for.. nah
A forty ounce for.. fuck!!
Just one more forty just one more I'll make this last day
A forty ounce for breakfast, can get me through the day[Intro] [Phonte Speaking]
She told me I've taken her to places she has never been before, but really
She was taking me places I promised myself I'd never go to
Pff, damn, let me start from the beginning

Alright now
I want all of you brothers to get ready for some sho' 'nuff sweet honey
For your mouth

[Verse One]
Some say she was from Cali
Some say the Carolinas
Mom was a belly dancer
Pop was a never minder
No drugs or alcohol and
No weed or marijuana
You think the backstage was the last place you'd find her
First time I saw her, kinda
Reminded me a of them chicks you see at CaroWina
Friendly and talkative and
Lookin' so marvelous had
That nigga Tay
Feelin' like Li'l Ze in the City Of Goddess
But, I'm digressing'
Please pardon if, I start trailin' off
Or fadin' out of my consciousness
It's just that when I think of ole' girl my whole world collapses
I, was so enraptured in all of her flawlessness
She approaches me with a smirk
That said, we can do work
No matter what time or day of the week it is
So thorough that backstage girl
She'll fall to her knees just to pray on your weaknesses

[Phonte talking]
I mean I told her straight up, you know
I got a significant other. She ain't care
She said, "For tonight I just wanna be your insignificant other."
Huh, what?
God damn!

[Verse Two]
Oh we left the club at around two
Just enough time to meet my niggas for round two
At another spot, DJ playing the sounds too
Hopefully divert me from being a scoundrel
In the spot making my rounds through
The crowd trying to throw her off
But she's on me like a bloodhound Jew
Wouldn't believe how hard I tried to fight it
Passions and desires were closin' in
And that's what it amounts to
I looked her in the eyes
And say, "I don't even know your name
It feels wrong even though I don't show it."
She said, "I wish I could tell you the same
But I won't tell you my name
Cause I want you to fuck me like you don't know it."
I responded with a smirk
To let her know we can work
No matter what time or day of the week it is
So thorough, that backstage girl
Fell down to her knees just to pray on my weaknesses
Maaaan can you fight her? Go head

You'd think the backstage would be the last place you'd find her
You'd think the backstage would be the last place you'd find her

Been ridin' all around the world
Seen so many faces
But I'm always lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Been ridin' all around the world, seen so many faces
Backstage girl
But I'm always lookin' for love in all the wrong places

[Phonte talking]
I woke up the next morning all tangled up in her hair
That's when I realized she had me all where she wanted me
She told me I'd taken her to places she'd never been before
But really she took me to a place I promised myself I'd never return to
And I was fucked up
And the thing was I didn't feel bad about what I've done
I just felt stupid for trying to fight it for so long
I mean really who I was fooling?
I knew what time it was soon as I saw her
Soon as she smiled at a nigga I could tell what the favorite position was
And I damn sure gave it to her
I thought I had changed
But niggas never changes
But it took that one night
That one passionate night for me to realize what I needed to do
I gotta stop fucking with these hoes off of Myspace dawg

Some say she was from Cali
Some say the Carolinas
Mom was a belly dancer
Pap' was a never minder
No drugs or alcohol
No weed or marijuana
You'd think the backstage was the last place you'd find herBob, Bob Wood

The music's coming through me"Whole house freeze!"

It was a Thursday. I stepped in the club. There she was
Draped in a burgundy dress, silhouetted superbly
Curved indeed. She started staring in my direction
Luring and urging seductively
Body language instructing me
I offered her a drink instead she took a cup of tea
And then I lied about my luxury lifestyle
And I said "So who you be? You looking kind of tight, gal
I would love to see you in a nightgown"
She said "They call me the Dragon Queen and I come from Tibet
I'm calm in the face of pressure and you'll never see me sweat
I've come to your country in search of a lost Scroll
That contains directions to a hidden village comprised of gold"
I looked at her confused and said "But why have you told me this?"
She said the description that I fit
Was that of the Chosen One who'd go beyond
Then slipped a concoction in my drink
That immediately set my consciousness adrift...

Now I'm in that zone dwelling. I woke in a warehouse tied to a chair
With an abundance of flare surrounding me in a circular angle
Glared up at the Dragon Queen's Lair, and wasn't imagining a thing
Her steps on the stairs had a magic gleam, glowed brightly
To prepare me for my journey, a Sword was hovering towards me
Plus garlic from the Keepers of the Gate who bore all the secrets and take
Care of trespassers, but at last it's prophesized that I would gain
Access to a cultural dynasty buried and seize and capture the Scroll
Massive helicopters patrolled the rooftops, strapped in
Began travelling into the darkness, knew not of what awaited
I thought of a way to get out of it, just then the bottom gave way
I began falling and gave it ten seconds, pulled the cord on my parachute
Landed surrounded by a herd of wild barracudas, lions
The sounds of the wild kingdom piercing like a siren
Was I entering near the mere mortal life span's end?
Defiantly I stood boldly as they began closing in
And time seemed to be moving rapidly just then...

"Whole house freeze!"

Just then I pulled the Sword and somehow
It affected all the creatures as they stepped back and bowed
And the same Glow that I seen in the Sword I seen in the eyes of the Lion
Who began leading me in a specific direction as if trying to tell me something
Just over the horizon, the same creatures who had been described
Appeared in statue form, but their eyes scoped
And as I approached the gate they began to break open and cried
"AFTER YEARS WE HAVE FINALLY BEEN AWAKENED!"
The assault was on, I got knocked to the ground by one
Shocked in an unorthodox form boxing
Throwing an abnormal proportion of body blows, karate chops
And drop kicks, plunged struggling deeper into the swamp
Then I grabbed my Sword, the garlic put it around my neck
Saw that it was draining all of their energy and then with a swing
Off with their heads!
The gates slowly and mysteriously opened
Curiously I moseyed in with intensity focusing on my objective
Spider webs the size of king-size beds
Fell in a secret passage not knowing to where it lead
Just then the same Light beamed brightly and in the distance
At that instance, lo and behold, The Hidden Scroll!
And just as I thought my mission was over
I could feel the Dragon Queen breathing heavily over my shoulder

She began to transform and metamorphosize
She took on an assortment of legs, arms, heads and eyes
And sprouted two horns and began to breathe fire
So once again, I grabbed my trusty Sword, but to my astonishment
She burned it to a crisp, turned and grasped the Scroll
And exited much faster than the secreted gas. I'm gasping
Clasp full of flames cast in my direction
I saw my whole life flash and the possibility of death
And a casket passed into the ground, pound for pound, astounding
How could I survive and last another round inside this madness?

J’en ai rien à foutre, j'passe des rires aux pleurs
J’suis içi l’auteur, et j’suis pile au cœur, de ta vie d’merde
Entre tes business, la rue, ses mystères, les p’tites tess, les filles d’l’est
J’vadrouille depuis l’enfance, connait les bonnes les mauvaises ambiances, je sais ce que mes collègues en pensent
Malheureusement, j’m’suis déjà défoncé à tout, pas toujours su, dompter ma fougue, faire danser la foule
Mais maintenant
J’viens cracher la foudre. Casser la croute... J’suis paré à tout, chez moi on chiale en cachette
Demande à la daronne le nombre de cachets, mâchés, HS
Jamais lâcher l’affaire, même si le diable m’a déjà cramé la tête, j’vais pas rester à terre
Et à terme, j’vais bouger d’al, rouler l’blaze, coucher l’train d’merde. J’suis saoulé d’ça
Moi je veux toucher l’grall, avec ma clic. Trop des miens ont chialé leurs morts. Pété la tise, sous les drames, tout les soirs, certains écroués. Juste un mandat, pole espoir
Tu voulais un guignol, tu t’es gouré man, tu veux jouer les ouf, mais j’vais d’goomer grave, moi j’me dis qu’avec un smile, tout se répare
Mais tout reste à faire, j’vais m’écrouler sale, en écoutant les haineux dire que j’chiale. Nique ça, j’vise la vie de star
Pour l’instant c’est pillave, shit, gras puis l’soir
J’écris ça en m’disant qu’il est tant d'être riche et roi

You could be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst
So dont test me
You better move over
You could be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst
So dont test me
You better move over

[Verse 1: Astro]
Im still grooving, feel the vibration when i move in
Leave cats ruined through the doodling, schooling
These low class G's on how to cool it
Leave the coolest females drooling
You got to ball like pool and laugh at those who be losing
Dont talk to every chick cruising 'cuz you know they be acusing
Tryna up my figs like newton, bars
Keep mines mines turn yours into ours
Shaky like a berry gordy contract
Very sporty shorty in the stone washed jeans, the best i've seen
Tighter than a fist trying to make a vein pop out
My punchlines bring the knockout
Stro flows cold like December 25th with the sock out
Brooklyns own, yall are just clones
Got to keep it real in the field of rap
I can't feel your tracks you could have that back

You could be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst
So dont test me
You better move over
You could be as good as the best of them

Realer than most, that be the motto homie simple and plain
Without a cheat code we still managed to live in this game
Lifes a movie, my characters main
Never no extra
Making moves, crews check the motion detecters
Perfecting, ever since my poppas erection
Direction is up trying to get the top no smuts
It's enough of that back home, im on a new road
Trying to tell these haters kudos, 'cuz you know
They use their power just to pull your card like uno
Mad when you jamming and your tracks slamming like sumo
No wrestler, hustler, get the rest of your
Folks and check out this lyrical dope
Rap game, crack game same thing only difference is
It's no baggies, skinny jeans and saggies
Im so nine o, but stro never add the two one o
I keeps it real you better chill

So dont test me

You could be as good as the best of them

What they be asking when i flip the tracks
They reacting like macs but i hacked em
Spitting just like a captain, its deeper than rap
Dont mention us in the same sentence, im all caps
It's the mac daddy mac, oh my god dont trip
I mop em up with flows i kick their waiting for me to slip
Dont pass the microphone, unless your trying to set it off
Let it off, got to cure my ill with the lords doctor
Kick rocks like poor socker
Chart topper, living in hell i bet i leave hotter
Represent for the Brooklyn borough
Stro gets props on every block like matumbo
Killing by the bridge i caught a body in Dumbo
You can't verse my verses, i turn a rapping mayweather humble
Dont put me in a box and recognize who be the ink king
Got more bars than sing sing
I flow def up until i hear the ching ching
Trying to get my piggy bank brolic
Get a grip your falling
AHHHHHHHH, its nothing they can tell us
Alright your nice but dont get too overzealous(That music makes you feel downright patriotic, doesn't it?)

[Jello Biafra as George W. Bush]
Our nation must come together to unite
I know that human beings and fish can coexist peacefully

But I do need somebody to tell me where Kosovo is

[Cage]
I wake up to a caffeine, cigarette vaccine
Then bathe in water I wouldn't drink before gasoline
Feel like a loser cause I'm not in Fallujah
Painting a land cruiser with an Iraqi then taking his Ruger
No M-16 to give me a callus
Inhuman super malice for GOP uber alles
Baby suicide bombers hurdle suitcases in a nursery
I'm in a deli eating tuna, tasting the mercury
Then try to wash it down with a two dollar bottle of water
Get on the train and think of terrorists with box cutters
Gun concealer cause I see a realer reality
And what I breathe through my nasal cavities, killing my batteries
Bombs in metropolis, out all eye sockets
Esophagus melted out some shiite group will get their props for this
Look, I need petro for my Mercedes
But I'm not trying to kneel or die for emperor Cheney
Maybe I'm crazy but I will not just follow the herd
Unless, of course, it's en route to lynch Mike Bloomberg
Being pimped by a gas pump and all its Saudi members
Are like "fuck you!" with New York's two middle fingers
If the opposite of pro is a con then look beyond this
The opposite of congress must be progress
What if the second coming's aborted and put in the dirt
I still don't know what to wear with this orange alert

(Run, coward)

[Jello Biafra as George W. Bush]
I was proud the other day when both republicans and democrats
Stood with me in the Rose Garden to announce their support
For a clearer statement of purpose: you disarm, or we will

[Cage]
American flags fly, moral's high
A unit of twenty or so repelling from apaches in the sky
Into a village of killers, little Jimmy from Jackson
Mississippi, just graduated and seeing action
M-16 locked, loaded and spitting properly
Whoever's in that line of fire - chest full of democracy!
Turn the corner, team leader, neck up, to the nose gone
Blown off, this is not PS2's Soccom
Jimmy stays so calm, shoots, count nothing
Riddled in his back answers come flying out his stomach
Face down, then it's face up in a bed, almost dead
Eyes slightly open, IV bag and no legs
A couple sandwiches and some bloody bandages
In a room full of amputee GI amateurs
He gets the word that his unit didn't make it
Got a free ticket home but flat lined before he got to take it

[Jello Biafra as George W. Bush]
We're certain there are people that can't stand what America stands for
We're certain there are madmen in this world
And there's terror, and there's missiles
And I'm certain of this too

(I hunger)

[Cage]
Cops tape the scene up, gunner downs 9
They're chasing away kids playing hop-scotch in this chalk outline
Two F-16's, screech an iridescent sky
Look down, we're not in Iraq, we're in N.Y
Rats in the streets, we move underground like earthworms
Two coasts couldn't abort Satan in his first term
The army in the subway, walking with toolies
I'm on the train with the back of the dollar bill still talking to me
Drive with my left, I know what's right - my weapon hand
Like the map of DC streets still shows a pentagram
License on the car window when I pass through
You've seen the news, no joke, New York pig department will blast you
My Weathermen party is invite only, soldier
Cause with one wave of King G. Dub's scepter it's over
The right to assemble puts the bureau's team on you
Look into my file and nod to this while Jello screams on you

[Jello Biafra as George W. Bush]
By our efforts we have lit a fire in the minds of men
It warms those who feel its' power, it burns those who fight its' progress
And one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world
It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth
Of democratic movements and institutions in every nature and culture
With the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world
Except right here at home! Hee-hee-hee-hee!
Yee-Haw!
Don't mess with Texas! (x4)
Connie...Connie, give me some pretzels
Mommy, mommy, give me that bible
Give me that bible with the pages cut out and it got that cocaine in it
C'mon, c'mon, don't mess with Texas!
(snorting sounds)
I'll fuck anything that moves![Erinn Anova] (Chorus)

Come along and reap
I need my song
We're climbin' over
Beneath the sea
March on
Time is almost gone
It's all in me
No maybe

[Gift Of Gab]
Here we go again
Slip into my conscience, come along an take in
A story bout a battle, in this corner, Satan
Cunning, baffling, and jumping into half the drink
And suddenly disasters and catastrophe
And acting unrationally
Reacting savagely
To passionately
Bask in everlasting like escapes from just what its creating
Jeopardizin' love
Look at all the people that you took advantage of
See your hypnotized
Rom be gone, take another cup
In consequences lurk
While the reaper got your shirt size
Nigga wake up
Times overdue for the birth of a power that the universe grew from

(Chorus 2X)

[Gift Of Gab]
You search for the answers outside
Refocus causin' time and time again, backslide
You've noticed times before the presence of that "I"
But never did submit to it and let it apply
Whatever be his will in this present life time
Or essence like mine
Know the blessings you might find
If you let your higher power inside
Emerge and apply to every single thing in your balance
You will truly find
Who you really are
Die and become reborn
When God is present in your life than you can come reap on
And ain't a storm that you can't weather
You got a purpose you was born to create
Destiny is waitin' for you
Arms open, take with ya
Knowledge bestowed by the great giver
Lakes, rivers
Mountains and steams
Now reality's the dream wraitha
No more searchin' for truth that was always wit' cha
It had to hit ya through the struggle and the turmoil
Ya soul was planted and it sprouted out above soil
And let the sun shine freely down
At times it looked like it wouldn't
But the plant came to flourish
Now it's standin' on solid ground

(Chorus 2X)

[Lateef]

Sun rises like water up in my eyes
I'm watchin' changing times but like a changing tide
Tryna to keep my head above the ed if I could be

[Lateef & Erinn Anova]

The sun rises like water up in my eyes
I'm watchin' changing times but like a changing tide
Tryna to keep my head up
Above the ed if I could be
Least
If I may

(Chorus 4X)God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
Yeah, yeah

I believe there's a time and a place
To let your mind drift and get out of this place
I believe there's a day and a place
That we will go to and I know you wanna share

There's no secret to living
(There's no secret to living)
Just keep on walking
There's no secret to dying
(There's no secret to dying)
Just keep on flying

I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name
I'm gonna die in a space that don't hold my fame

God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls

I believe there's a time when the cord of life
Should be cut, my friends
(Cut the cord, my friend)
I believe there's a time when the cord can be cut
And this vision ends
(Let this vision end)

But I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name
And I'm gonna cry in a space that don't hold my name

Walking in the cold, just keep on flying
There'll be a searchlight on the mountain high

God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, I'm a lonely soul

I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name
I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name

God knows you are lonely souls
Lonely souls, lonely souls
Lonely soul, I'm a lonely soul

So long, little chapel
Sweet is the sound
Pack up your light
Pack up your light
Say goodbye to the Holy water life
Sweet sound, in and out
Ahh
Pushing it inIs there anyone close.. by.. who can listen to this?
And who can see it.. plain as day
Look how it FALLS down
Falls down upon everybody!
This is it

[Lateef]
Looking, over a city, that's gritty, and rather pretty
A pity, it's hard to find, but inequity, cover
Every itty bitty square diamond of jiggy
They givin ??, up to woodsy
Manipulating they minds in the alleyways
These dizzy and shitty rats, the sizes of kitty-kats
They cross paths when traffic subsides; somewhere
Some brothers is overstanding on a hot black rooftop
Freestyling for they GOT damn lives, the spirit, it gets live
And answers the question why God blessed the Earth
But, buildings block out the sky, and the children
Are oversexualized, media-wise, brutalized by parents
At the tender age of five, in front of they siblings wide-eyed
Nah not surprised, just the real scene regularly
Up in between the lies, try to put it together GET
They pieces of the pie, hope they clever and tough
Make it better before they die, plant the next seeds
Somewhere in the South Bronx, or Patterson ??
The baddest with sharp chomp, to splatter when mouths-off
Retali' and swear he could damage em Dunn
But that will shatter his Mom's faith
In the art that she burns, herbs and candles of perm'
It's hard to call it see cause times change and the world turn
Some end up slanging dope, some end up strung out
On coke and sherm, some party every night for the rest of they life
And some learn, go corporate all professional rhetoric
With sensational glory, let me tell you all one day
That it is it ain't boring, and so hard to ignore it
Cause any day in this fork, that they callin New York
Based on nothin but currents, you can find yourself a failure
Or a success story
On the subway, at three in the mornin, huh
Or on the corner, or up on a rooftop yawnin
Meditatin upon it, lookin over a city that's gritty
And rather pretty, a pity
It's hard to find but inequity covers every itty bitty
Square diamond, the engine, of America, inchin
Toward hysteria, pimpin, every fate

[El-P]
My friends are the faces you sit on, lickin a profit popsic'
Where food is just a necessity between sitcom watchin
Soak up quick image instead of black marks on papyrus
Fabric logic, where true to dirt perps go incogninant
Think of Soup Nazi, empatzi project hard copy
Books will suffer Farenheits, quality of life flesh sliced
Omega daylight quota, pop luck lottery info
GigaPet rapist, internet pedophile disco
Sensationalist function of truth, dirty ass fetish
Glass bubble lo-cal profile, the year's fiscal
Workin family, Social Jowe, boot camp
Rehab group home kid, idolized cartoon missile
Mostly, lonely, plant life
Cement arena scream when you don't listen closely
Switchblade amaze young gun Brooklyn blood transplant
Immature Menendez fashion
Crystal Method lover, buy the bottle, jungle captive
Where MC's got little cocks on teeth with fillings out like magnets
Caught up in the dragnet, tri-felon
Shoula packed a plastic handheld lead shark repellant
I sense the tension building, since canvas killing
K-9's roam trained our district
Culture murder politic sadistic
Policy autopsy backtrack, caught up in a tune from rockin fat cap
I told him it was art but just got laughed at
Burner liquid concoction on hot celsius
And kelpachlorics for the fatal facial, spray deface you
Sooner than never, most lawless progress together
Fuck the bullshit, I react to acid flux product definitive junk
Brain rape train bottle by the burners of books, FUCK THAT!

[Lyrics Born]
Imagine this, Angeles, or San Francisco
And everybody sandwiched in, can't stop here and ambulances
Don't nobody ass-kiss, ain't practical being passive
In the city you ask so much ass and mo' asses
It's a batch of latin girl, actin rappin off the spanish
English quest, can't understand, as the languages clash
And every ad is vandalism, the trash gets aneurysms
It's delegates and panelists all representin they nationalism
And the battle inches on, every section separated
By eth-nic features decorated veterans deliverin
Les-sons to the younger people stoops that double as bleachers
And I'm part, of an elite fleet, of MC's, and Truthspeakers
I import, concrete beats, that just speak, when my moods flavor
My peers I beg forgiveness, I just don't buy twelve inches
Too many independents, they share the same resemblence
Too hard to make decisions, I built up a resistance
Like I'm fighting off a sickness plus they just don't hold my interest
But, missionin out, to the indigineous birthplace
The first day, I inched below the sur-face
And found, inspiration, in surplus, in my, in-terpretation
Of disturbed crazy world, of love, dope shit, attempting contemplation on
Uniquely woven and continously flowin intricately sewn into
The fabric of the nation New York City keep on mowing em down baby!There...there...there...there...

Put aside the everyday world and come with us

Too much equipment, and little by little we went insane

A ticket to nothingness...
UNKLEI was born with the voice of a riot, a storm
Lightening the function, the form
Far from the norm, I won't follow like cattle
I'm more like a catalyst; calm in the mix of battle
Who let the cowboy on the saddle? He don't know a missle from a gavel
Para terror troopin' flippin' loops of death upon innocent flesh
But I'm back in the cipher my foes and friends
With a verse and a pen, against a line I won't tow or defend
Instead I curse at the murderous men in suits of professionals who act like animals
This man child, ruthless and wild
Who gonna chain this beast back on the leash?
This Texas Führer, for sure a, compassionless con who serve a
Lethal needle to the poor. The cure for crime is murder?

On the left, left, right, left
But it's just a march of death

I read the news today, oh boy, a snap shot of a midnight ploy
Vexed and powerless, devoured my hours I'm motionless with no rest
Cause a scream now holds the sky, under another high-tech drive-by
A lie is a lie this God is an eagle or a condor for war and nothing more
Islam peace, Islam stare into my eyes brother please off our knees
To beef now we feed their disease, interlocked our hands across seas
What is a flag but a rag, a shroud out loud, outside a faceless crowd
Cause a cowering child just took her last breath, one snare in the march of death

On the left, left, right, left
But it's just a march of death

Here it comes the sound of terror from above
He flex his Texas twisted tongue
The poor lined up to kill in desert slums
For oil that boil beneath the desert sun
Now we split flame we flip this game
All the targets are taking aim
All targets are taking aim
We're the targets, they're taking aim[produced by DJ Shadow]

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Tell me what the faith is, flow is on a wait list
Someone keep that shit shut, all white, no cut
I fucked up but I still came and I still reign like thunder
Everything's been done some, screamin' like we love them
But I still get what I deserve
You live, you learn, you wait your turn and you crush 'em
Fall back, all that, freshmen you're welcome
Still flip with these young hoes, still stunt with these fly clothes
Still rep for that East side where they bang toys like Tyco
I'm busy one percentin', I'm rapper Armageddon
Introducin' all that bullshit all these other niggas spittin'
Yo it's Childish, I'm wild, bitch, all white coke like scientist
Stupid busy, fuckin' with your main like a lioness
Nigga scrunch your face up, all we get it queso
All we watch is cartoons, hatin' man, that's all you
Fuckboy, that's all you, say shit when I saw you
Say shit on that online but that's fake beef like dog food
Panic room blue, too soon to be into it
These Silver Lake niggas know hood like a clitoris
Bang, bang, bang, bang, shots fired, A-Town, Empire
What you think we all about? Watchin' bitches trippin' outPeep through the door
It seems as though the grass was much greener before
The dead life has been washed upon the sea shore
Money and greed deluded what is truly pure
And yet our flesh keeps reaching out for more

Now you're trapped
A hole in the ozone about to make the world collapse
Pollution fills the air and minds with bullet twisted facts
Midnight is now upon us people righteous laws are coming back

Don't turn your head away cause you can't get away
Your mind is lost because your spirit has been led astray
Don't ever say you gave it all if you ain't gave it all
Just fade it in the hazy purple twilight
No more time I tried to warn you all it's now approaching midnight

Panic's in the air
Some jumping out of buildings others on their knees in prayer
Some cry out to the sky and yell they aren't quite prepared
You looked god in the face and said forgive me all he did was stare

Now you can run
But where you gonna hide from all the power of the sun?
The cosmic repercussions of what human kind has done
No understanding of the fullness everything is simply one

Soon to be none again so that new life can come again
Illusions rule the mind your soul is never gonna end
So don't pretend you gave it all if you ain't gave it all
Just fade it in the hazy purple twilight
No more time I tried to warn you all it's now approaching midnight

So I bid farewell
No more good times or bad times, no more heaven no more hell
Now brace yourself for impact it's a half hour to twelve
Complete in total darkness empty space is where you're left to dwell

And all you had to do was live today for your tomorrow
But now it's over and you're drowning deep inside your sorrow
You could've led but instead you confirmed and chose to follow
So once again I bid farewell

There's only seconds left you'd like to second guess
But through your foolish ways you've literally beckoned death
So just don't say you gave it all if you ain't gave it all
Just fade it in the hazy purple twilight
No more time I tried to warn you all it's now approaching midnight[Verse 1]
Paragraph paralyzer rhythmic aristocrat
Mister rap it's the Gift of Gab about to twist your caps
Swift the fist so fast fury worry hit the switch ya ass
Its 'n bits 'n fragments so midget quit this diss ya ass
Sit ya ass down while I rip the tracks and spit the facts
Hit the grass--green, brown, or purple I'm the diplomat
Rip your raps, really you don't get the math
Just a half-breed phony rhymer, I was meant to rap into that
Fire breathing, rhyme heathen, kidnap your mental black
Hijack your fly dap or con head your intellect
Mind state, arrow blast, center crack, mind gaps
Blind from their eyes back, send ya back crying act up
A pencil pad, my utensil grab thine attention
Get hit so bad with jiu-jitsu stabs I uphend you
And if you rap I'mma send you back rappin' in a tavern
If you mad kid it's just too bad

Hit you with the funk it's like, "who cut the provolone?"
Government officials put taps on my mobile phones
Nations overthrown hold my own on my zone
Prone to leave your dome blown poem after poem homes
Jones for the tones roam with me turn your motor on
Overall this war just just got it goin' on
Overgrown child never growin' old sowin' oats pokin' notes
Till the never nose ho overdose

Leave your city burnin like Gamera
Stamina, blaze up your space, plus I got it on camera
And I'm a animal, animator landin' a

Punching through your granite a goodwill ambassador
From another planet I could kill and smash ya up
And it won't stop and I can't stop - better-er

On a frenzy after ya yellin' "that's enough!"
And it tempts me, that it does, and I'm glad it does

Paragraph presidentI'm a rabbit in your headlights
Scared of the spotlight
You don't come to visit
I'm stuck in this bed

Thin rubber gloves
She laughs when she's crying
She cries when she's laughing

Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...
(Away....away....away....)

I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Christian suburbanite
Washed down the toliet
Money to burn

Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...

Sample from movie Jacob's Ladder :
If you're frightened of dyin' and you're holding on...
You'll see devils tearing your life away
But...if you've made your peace
Then the devils are really angels
Freeing you from the earth.....from the earth....from the earth

Rotworms on the underground
Caught between stations
Butterfingers
I'm losing my patience

I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Christian suburbanite
You got money to burn....

Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away.....
Away, away, away
Away, away, away[Gift of Gab]
I got rhymes for the deaf dumb and blind
And a 20/20 eyesight; big mouth yappin
Crystal clear ear competition mere child's play
When I'm formin up, can't be guarded now, sendin y'all to the
Drawing board, I floored niggas with the skills
I'm sick and bored, of all the triggers and the steel
That you're cappin; why don't you give all that weak shit a rest
And start rappin - I'm puffin the buddha bless yes I'm packin
BOWLS, and spittin the rhymes on ?testabra?
Be like D'Wayne from _What's Happening_ talking about "Uh-uhh!"
Ya, can't defeat me, delete me, beat me, greet me
With a grin or, get your chin jaw and your neck broke
And then I'll rip off your arm and throw it in a stew --
Boy I'll make mincemeat of you, ? speed a few, wimps eat a few
Shirmps need a new, temp-orary mind-boggler, follow me, G
Niggerole, bigger flows, hover over small ones
Others flows will fall, come and get some
Runnin shit one rhyme AFTER the next
Master the flexology, follow me, take all of me
Fuck a beast, buck a beast, sucker please
Don't you know _Miuziweighs-a-freakin-ton_ like Chuck D's?
Psych! Thought I would contradict myself, didn't ya?
I'm gettin ya
I'm hittin ya ass with bass all in your face so taste the bit
In ya, bowls of Soul, get on a Train but I'm not Don Cornelius
Really it's not no gimmicky shit like chicken popcorn
Now new and meatier, shootin like a meteor
Beats fat and beatier, feed me your brain child
The strange style contains foul language
So tell you kids to go to sleep so the beat can enhance you ock
If you a rapper grab your mic broke cancel the Glock yo'
Ass is grass and I'm the lawnmower hey bonhead nigga
Put your rhyme in the towaway zone
Red's all I see like if my name was El Toro
On the land, smokin a reefer, underwater smokin a coral reef
I squash beef like a meat grinder
I'm the kind of chief rocker to seek and destroy boys
Oy, I'm all of that and a plate of chitlins
So won't you sit and listen to the way I flip the script
Like, a beat to make a flip to beat to breakin shit
Delete you makin hits complete awaken kids I eat ya
Like a batch of bacon bits takin it to the next step
LET'S GET ILL[Verse 1]
I hear voices whisper tell me, "Banner kill yo'self"
Man I call on the Lord, pain doesn't easy from wealth
These cars, these clothes, these hoes
Never meant nothin, havin nightmares screamin and busting
At my enemy, I put a bullet in that nigga and I see it's me
Is it my soul?, killing self hate
Or does that nigga in me have to die before I reach them pearly gates
Either way I got somthin to say
Jam Master Jay used to yell walk this way
But it's hard to walk like a man the industry's ..
And these the same motherfuckers thats controlin my cash'
And the same ones, the government, controllin yo ass
Why George bush ain't in jail for stealin them votes?
Why the CIA ain't closed man, for pushin that dope?
Get it crackin America, the CIA, aka the KKK
It's judgement day!

[Verse 2]
In a Chevy, I'm wondering if the Feds broke the levy
Are they in with the devil to control the weather?
Hurricanes and typhoons every other week
While po' folks are drowning in the middle of the street
We too scared to speak, or too busy on the internet
I heard they about to put lo-jacks in our kids necks
Marshall law, tell Bush naw we ain't ready to flip
The hood is like a modern slave ship
We packed like sardines and shackled to the streets
And crack is cotton that grows up from the concrete
Shit, but I guess I'm seein thangs
We'd rather not learn, we'd rather fuckin gang bang

[Hook]I got a feeling there's gonna be a riot

I don't read the newspapers because they all have ugly prints

Check me out, Check me out

Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on cause there's gonna be some shit tonight!

[Verse 1]
At the starting of the week
At summit talks you'll hear them speak
It's only Monday
Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

(come come come come come with it)
(come come come come come with it)

[Verse 2]
You could be sitting taking lunch
The news will hit you like a punch
It's only Tuesday (what time is it?)
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fool's Day (what time is it?)

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

Tomorrow is another day

Fire!

Escalation
Devastation
Generation
Separation
Situation
Dissipation
Shot!
Another shot another shot the tender vessel pressure pop
The heart is cold the gun is hot(shot)
I'm not sure if they done or not
I'm not sure that they wanna stop
The gun is cold the blood is hot(shot)

The hearts are weak the guns are not

You hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday (what time is it?)
You feel the shaking of the ground
A million candles burn around
Is it your birthday? (what time is it?)

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
(get tomorrow on the phone, trying to reach tomorrow, get tomorrow on the phone)
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
(I need to see tomorrow, trying to reach tomorrow)
Think tomorrow's come I think it's too late

Another day!
