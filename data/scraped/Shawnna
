[Intro - Ludacris]
Stand up! Stand up!
Stand up! Stand up!

[Hook - Ludacris (w/ Shawnna)]
When I move, you move (just like that?)
When I move, you move (just like that?)

Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back
(When I move, you move) just like that?

(Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back)

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
How you ain't gone fuck?, bitch I'm me
I'm the goddamn reason you in V.I.P
CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ludacris]
Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

[Hook]

[Bridge - Ludacris]
Stand up! Stand up!
Stand up! Stand up!

[Verse 3 - Ludacris]
Damn right, the fire marshal wanna shut us down
Get us out, so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting so cut up
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over; Luda got something to say
Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry about me stepping all over your feet

[Hook]

[Outro - Ludacris]
Stand up! Stand up!
Stand up! Stand up!(Chorus 1)

[Ludacris]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy

[Trina]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes

But you gotta let me kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy

Verse 1 - Trina
You know what I need
Somebody that who can come li-li-lick the clit
(Alright)
And a nigga who ain't thinking 'bout a Trina LP
And I'll make him go and get my shit
We can go from a fly ass jetta to a Coupe De Ville
Hotel tally ho or the Beverly Hill
A real nigga not the run of the mill
Come and spank me and make me shoot to kill
From the kitchen then you can move me
To the jaccuzzi and out the booty
Come and do your duty
Me and fat dick Ludacris making us a movie
Bare naked in a bed of cash
Make st st sttutter when I bare my ass
*Damn she back, I though she a*? thing of the past
Cause I'm a bad bitch and I'm off the glass (Okay)
Having sex in lil' jets menage'tois
Getting buck wild no matter where we are
Indie 500 in the back of the car
In a dark ass club or on the back of a bar
Never want, never ever wanna leave
Work for me like league over seas
I want a man to fulfill my needs
To keep my body trembling and buckle my knees

(Chorus 2)

[Ludacris]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor

But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy

(Verse - 2)

[Shawnna]
I wanna do it on the canopy
I wanna do it where your girl gon see, and get mad at me
I want a nigga that'll grab the weave
And turn my eyes Chinese
Tell me baby can you handle me?
I wanna do it all in your mouth
Then I'll pull the ass out
Make it bounce till you pass out
Or we can cut up in the grass
And give the neighbors a flash
Can you tell me who the bad motherfucker now?
Said I wanna take-ta-take-take a nigga back to the crib
And I wanna do all the things, do all the things that I never did
Like up on the top-to-top-top of the projects getting head
Or you can find me in a dro-drop-drop-drop on dubs in the candy red
I like a nigga when he face down, mouth wide
Polo down with them blades on the ride
Keepin the pound with them K's on the side
But it's okay I'm gon break something tonight
Oh see get on your knees
And I'll show you what's my fantasy
Like up in the coupe, coupe
Tell your bitch she ain't gotta be mad at me

(Chorus - 3)

[Ludacris]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
(Remix, remix)
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy

(Verse - 3)

[Foxy Brown]
You gotta li li li lick me from my ass to my clit
Then you gotta su-suck the pussy while I sit on your dick
And I wanna talk some shit while I feel it get stiff
And then ruba-dub on my tits while I nut on your lips nigga

I'm a BK bitch, love to ride dick
Ass in his face, cock spread out
Nigga uptown, nigga down south
Same ol' shit, bust in his mouth
F-O-X call me rough sex
Especially when a bitch get right on the X
Get it, right on X
Fuck him, check
Right to the next
Bitches go right, Fox right to the left
Nigga can't fuck, burner his chest
36 D's, Prada on the breasts
Baddest, send him home, na na on his breath
How you think a bitch got my rep?
3 Mills, still BK to the death
Still don't give a fuck
Still pose naked
Still specialize in sittin' niggas faces
Pop magnum's by the cases
X5, bitch, still spend big faces
Big frown, brown, hold first places
You know what you can do nigga?
You can li li li lick me from my ass to my clit
And ruba-dub up on my tits while I nu-nut on your lips, fucka

(Chorus - 4)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, uh, me and Luda wasn't good at computers
So we dropped out of school cause we tried to fuck the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit him with this maneuver he just couldn't recooper
We got vouchers to stand on these couches
James Brown couldn't tell me, "get down!"
We got foreign cars and houses
We got porno stars and spouses
You trying to stab one like Jack The Ripper
Trying to get two like Jack "The Tripper"
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home from the street he gone want those strippers
And I'm a big tipper I don't even be tripping
This my first real Rolex, it don't even be ticking
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without'em clouding up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Four G's in a paper denim jeans
The pink rocks red hot like Anthony Kiedis
You see these, these is the sweetest Adidas
We FIRE, y'all RETIRE
All ugly people please!, be quiet!
Hov ain't get a beat from me in a minute
He heard "Just to Get By" and I was rehired
I got a track right now that could save my ass
It ain't a song it's a video, call Dave Meyers
Y'all drop 20 G's on the Sprewell rims
I give that money to another to get some real spins

A slut gone be a slut, a trick gone be a trick
I keep my drank all in my cup, gloss all on my lips
Coup parked in the front, Audemar on my wrist
Two bad bitches on deck, one Chocolate one Red
One say she wanna fuck, the other givin’ up plenty
No ménage a trois, five hoes in my car
Got ecstasy, promethazine, we trying to find some mo, where them boys?

With a one piece that look painted on and a Birkin bag on my arm
With a slash of that bronze, oh my God
My body scent alone known to get a nigga dick hard
I keep that loud in the extension
My name all in your mansions
My song all in your iPod, I’mma stand up bitch no tripod
I got your nigga comin’ to get me
All my bitches with me

On our way up in the 50

I keep my choppers on beam

And my ass so fat, I swear it’s bustin’ out the seam
Hair all down my back, 500 a pack
I’m a high class hood rat
And my ass big and fat

I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin' for that action
Gucci Mane, you stupid man I love the way you flowin
Ridin' in my drop but I don't know where I'm goin
On two eighty five I keep ridin' in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple
"Gucci, show time!" Give me five mo' minutes
And a cold orange juice cause I'm really really trippin'
Went to the strip club and requested "I'm Da Man"
The next thing you know I was throwin' rubber bands

Face in the seat, wait for the beat, rockin 'n rockin 'n makin it squeak
Stop, stop, stop, stop - what'chu gon' do? Somebody might see
So make it fast, take it slow

Take control, make it swoll

This cafe Patron got me sippin real slow
I'm lookin like a star, ice on my neck
Ice on my wrist, ice on my chest
You might want to flirt, but I ain't on that
I'm way fucked up, I'm way to' back
And I don't give a fuck, I got it like that
They took a nigga deuce, I got it right back
And now they like "Damn!" Now they like "Amazin!"
Tondra rolled four, five blunts and we blazin
Look at shawty gazin, he lookin like he want me
I'm sorry lil' daddy, I'm tryin to get your homie

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
(Lames can't call her) Lames cain't call her
(All she date is ballers) She only date ballers
(Shawty got a fetish) For boys who go get it
(Squares can't call her) So the squares cain't call her
(Lames can't call her) Lames cain't call her
(All she date is ballers) She only date ballers
(Shawty got a fetish) For boys who go get it
(She only date ballers) It's Miss Shawnna

[Gucci Mane]
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm MVP
I know your baby momma real proud of me
The Benz line say they get tired of me
I'm young kush man I sell nuttin but QP's
Shawnna so fine, Gucci Mane I'm good
She's so pretty but still so hood
Hey little darlin, how you shawty?
I'm so mall-less I can't call it
I'm so Southern, you so Northern
We so crack rock, they so corny
It's 2:30, early in mornin
The way I cook a brick it's like I'm doing a performance
All eyes on we, homegirl want me
Zay he on the track, so the track real funky
Pants Red Monkey, Gucci go donkey
Niggas play crazy, get left stanky

[Chorus]

[Shawnna]
Yo, yo, ay, Shawnna
I wrote the verse three, for bitches in the hood
My Air One bitches, smokin on the good
Sittin on the po'ch, sippin on the 'gnac
Or posted in the parkin lot sittin on the 'llac
Them bitches got weight, them bitches got work
Them bitches wanna trip, them bitches gettin murked
And stick 'em in the dirt, and go on 'bout our bid'ness
And it ain't nuttin personal it's all about the figures
It's M.O.E., 'til a bitch a dead
And I don't give a fuck about what a bitch said
I'm still gettin money, I'm still gettin rich
I'm still that woman that'll take yo' dick
And yeah the truth hurts, you still gotta face it
I spent your whole deal on my ring and my bracelet
It's top notch twat, cream of the crop
I'm beatin down your block and let them choppers chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop... {*fades*}

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Geah~! {*3X*}(Twista Verse)
Bastards and Bitches, after my riches
I'm so spectacular with this now lets get back to the business..
I'm like Dracula with this, my vernacular's endless
Ask if it's fact or fictitious, but it's just the act of a menace..
Nigga this far from scary and I'm like a barbarian
Arian, air he inhalin' until I start to airin' 'em
So don't even start comparin' em, or I'mma just start to bury 'em
I'm darin' 'em, to come take a swim in the shark's aquarium
Lyric extortionist, turn you to carcasses, every portion is
Thoughts of a awkward vocal contortionist..
On my mom and them I'm better than them who copy my flow like a homonym..
And Amoxicillin will not stop the villain, it's pain I inflict when I'm bombin' 'em
God like I'm Andromedan, better yet Osiris or should I just say Asaar
Father of Heru, I told you that I was astonishing
Take a walk in my moccasin, I can send you through a journey of knowledge and horror
Sodom and Gomorrah, biblical verses as if I was reading the Torah

(Shawnna Verse)
Bastards and Bitches, after my riches-
But I count my stacks and my digits like I was 10 mathematicians..
You gonna slice your wristiphon...tights be glistenin, do what I can maestro the brightest like nitro glycerin
My oral skill is a horrible chlorophyll
Hallucinogenic that you get so dumb like cannabis or a pill
Shawnna can do shit that be damaging
Leaving them standing stiff as a Manikin
Burn a bitch up cause I'm hot
Ain't nothin that can be cured with no medicine
But the way that I spit is magic cause Iam a sorcerous conjuring fortresses leaving the floor full of carcasses
Motherfuckers should bow to this
On the core with this, I am a beast a hottie bangin bodies with niggas
My hobby is triggas, so don't make me have to come and go shotty your niggaDown my back, big and fat
Down my back, big and fat
Down my back, big and fat
Down my back

I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
Hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
She can't do it like this
She can't do it like that

I keep my tats all on my neck, tats all on my back
Gucci all on my feet, stacks all in my lap
Your man wish he could fuck, your bitch wish she could lick
A slut gone be a slut, a trick gone be a trick
I keep my drank all in my cup, gloss all on my lips
Coup parked in the front, Audemar on my wrist
Two bad bitches on deck, one Chocolate one Red
One say she wanna fuck, the other givin’ up plenty
No ménage a trois, five hoes in my car
Got ecstasy, promethazine, we trying to find some mo, where them boys?
Say he want it like this, say he want it like that
But Man that pussy too good
But Man that pussy too fat

I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
Hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
She can't do it like this
She can't do it like that

I keep my hair down my back, that 30 over that blonde
With a one piece that look painted on and a Birkin bag on my arm
With a slash of that bronze, oh my God
My body scent alone known to get a nigga dick hard
I keep that loud in the extension
My name all in your mansions
My song all in your iPod, I’mma stand up bitch no tripod
I got your nigga comin’ to get me
All my bitches with me
Deep as hell in this Bentley
On our way up in the 50

I keep my choppers on beam
I’mma dope dealers dream
And my ass so fat, I swear it’s bustin’ out the seam
Hair all down my back, 500 a pack
I’m a high class hood rat
And my ass big and fat

I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
Hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
She can't do it like this
She can't do it like that[Intro]
Awww yeah, welcome back to Battle of the Sexes Radio
Where it is 12:45 in the A.M. and Disturbing Tha Peace is our in-studio guest
Our hotline is lit the fuck up with people with relationship issues
Caller number one, you're on the air

Yeah man, y'all tell me if I'm crazy cause this girl in here trippin
Y'knowmsayin? I'm a real man, I take care of her
I take care of my kids, I pay all my bills
I mean I ain't gon' lie, I may check a lil' female from time to time on the side
Y'knowmtalkinbout, but what man don't? So how can I break this down to her?

Ludacris, how do you feel about this particular situation?

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, get your money right ladies, learn to sign your own checks
But don't call me after midnight, unless we havin sex
Don't ever assume nothin, a man gon' be a man
A groupie gon' be a groupie, a fan gon' be a fan
These tricks gon' keep trickin' so hustlers gon' keep hustlin
Long as there's new coochie then dogs gon' keep fuckin
So don't be all up in my phone replying to women's pages
I thought your momma told you, you should never talk to strangers
Don't ever ask no questions that you really don't want the answers to
Stop poppin off at the mouth or like Nino Brown I'll have to cancel you
Handle you, stop the ride, leave you on the avenue
Half of you, always seem to want some nigga to pamper you
And that'll do for him but not for me, I'll probably baffle you
And if he wants to act a fool I'll show him what the gat'll do
Run along, go find somebody to snitch or go chit-chatter to
Then your name will follow with, Ay! Whatever Happened To..?

(Exactly, that's just what she need to hear)

[Interlude]
You damn right playa, aight thank you for callin man
Next caller
Yeah I hear you but let's talk about the fake-ass brothers
With the 24's but can't pay the note on they lease
And my nigga with his iced-out chain
But I can't get him to pay his damn child support
That's why we makin mo' money, ownin our own property and ride just as nice
So now, I guess if we want to, we can bail y'all too now, huh?
Interesting, Shawnna you wanna speak on this one?

[Shawnna]
Uhh, yo, get your mind right niggas get a bitch that can keep up wit'chu
I'm tired of thinkin to myself why in the hell did I ever fuck wit'chu
I'm stuck wit'chu, sick of yo' childish games and all the stuff you do
I'll probably mention yo' name but true to the game I've had enough of you
I've seen yo' type befo', throwin yo' funds all over the flo'
He flashin his chains and flashin his dough, he drinkin the fifths and drinkin the Mo'
But what you don't know this nigga broke, he can't even afford to smoke
And back in the hood all the hustlers and G's know he's a joke
That's why I cheat a nigga, just when he eat it I tell him beat it nigga
Real bitches true to the game, that's how you G a nigga
DTP stay in the zone, like we on PCP
Chrome on the SS, Shawnna blow there recently
Y'all niggas ain't on my level, I do it so hood
Pineapple and Belve', we feelin' so good
Lightning is so wood, I get my own stack
That's why I leave him 200 and never call back

(That's right Shawnna, pussy rule the world!)

[Interlude]
Yes it does, next caller what's up?
Man what's up, this is Marcus
I wanna know do y'all got somebody to talk to these triflin-ass women?
Like me, I'm a good man, but all these good men get treated like shit!
All friends callin at 3:30 in the mornin
Marcus don't wanna talk about no numbers
Marcus wanna talk about that ass, and I ain't havin it!
Y'all got somebody to talk to these women?
Cause they need to be TAUGHT!
I-20 you better talk to 'em!

[I-20]
Yo, get your money right ladies, tell the man to get gone
But you don't you show up to my crib with your period on
This is lesson one baby, listen, how should I begin?
Um, ain't no such thing as a plutonic friend
You're lying to yourself if you don't think you want mo'
So don't you call me insecure when he show up at your do'
You all claim to have substance, self-respect and some class
But half naked in the club and steady shakin yo' ass
Screamin I ain't done enough to touch you under your skirt
But who the hell are you to tell me what my money is worth?
I run the streets, and you trippin I don't make you feel safe
I stay at home and you complainin that I think we need space
I'm not sayin that it's fair but it's the way that it is
Ain't no nigga tryin to marry you with four or five kids
It may sound a little harsh but it's straight from the heart
A nigga didn't write the scripts so I'm just doin my part, yeah

(Preach my brother, preach! I hope you women out there heard that!)

[Outro]
And you better believe they did, it's millions of people listening
But that's our show for this evening ladies and gentlemen
I gotta go get a piece of ass my damn self, alright? (c'mon baby)
Check us same time, same place tomorrow

Break sumthin', take sumthin'

[Verse: Ludacris]
Yea, Fe, Fi, Foe, Fum
I smell an ounce of that good and a fifth of rum
Ain't no mistakin' Shady Park is where I'm flippin' from
It's so Shady my old lady gotta' keep a couple guns
You get the runs and I ain't talkin' about the bowel system
I'm talking bleeding, hurry wrap 'em in a towel system
Get the fuck out now system
It's animosity, curiosity, robbery
Probably the reason why theirs no stoppin' me 'till you cop a plea

[Verse: Shawnna]
Man, see now these bitches wanna fuck wit Shawnna
When I bump that thang and keep a pocketbook of marijuana
Better keep that mouth out my business
Cause I got that 50 for ya
And I'm off the whip in this bitch and somebody shoulda' told ya
I'm drinkin' Remy and these bitches lookin' at me shady
They must don't know that I'm that bitch that smoke 'em in the face
Better take me up out the club cause I'm about to break
And all bitches and thugs know how we operate
We 'bout that take nigga

[Hook]

[Verse: Fate Wilson]
Little Shorty from G-Roll
On the hustle to see six figures or more
Whether rappin' or pimpin' hoes
I'm high capping the gold
And I know I made them boys sick when I popped up on 24's

[Verse: Tity Boi]
You see me diggin' in my gold
I'm a ghetto bastard and when I'm smokin' on 'dro
I get the munchies directly after
I made doe by offing hoes in transactions
You see I stay on Riverdale Road
But I'll meet you up on Naston

[Verse: Fate Wilson]
Cause in the south side partner we break you off proper
And the doctors can't help ya when the guns go block-ah
Time to notify the pastor ya family you'll mourn after
Yea the day after your ashes get scattered
You're all out next batter

[Verse: Tity Boi]
I don't need no approval for poodles cause I'm a fool dog
Get to fighting in clubs and swing with pool balls
Shorty raw, walking by I try to grab sumthin'
If you don't say sumthin' I'm gon' take sumthin'

[Hook]

[Verse: I-20]
Shit..

I love that pretty brown round
She shaking got me shook
Cause her print so fat between her thighs

Can I look can I rub it
Matter fact fuck that let me cut it
Can I touch it can I grab it
That hairy nappy fat rabbit
Meet me there I take a flight
Your dark chocolate fittin to be up in the air like a kite
Caught up in the Chicago wind
Just to be up in your guts from dust to dawn
Humpin like a camel back

Hold up wait a minute step back let a nigga just catch my breath

They Like it how I move it up and down and make that booty roll

And I wish you would-would be my slave for the night
We could turn the bedroom into my cave for the night

[Shawnna]
I'll be yo' favorite delight
And make me call you daddy while I'm takin the pipe
You makin me bite after you push it too deep
I need that type of lovin that'll put you to sleep

[Ludacris]
Well I could see it if you want me to, we could get the camera
We could roleplay, you the artist I'll be your manager
You could be the nurse I'm the doc (doc fill me in)
Play "cops and robbers" or "cowboys and Indians"
In the end, let's say you won't know what hit ya

See the watch got chilly, and the rocks got freeze
And ya broads act silly, couldn't jack my steed
For slippin in your pimpin ma, ya boy chose me
And now we got 'em "hey lil mama, can you give me a sec

This nigga yawnin while he talkin, so I knew he was weak
And by like six in the mornin, he forgot what he said

[Hook]

[Shawnna]
You know I keep a 4-5 whoopers in the trunk

You heard of D.T.P., we give the people what they want
And when it comes to hustle, yo you know we ain't no punk
You catch me in the town, we blowin dro and gettin drunk
And when we hit the party, yo you know we keep it crunk
Yo nigga actin tipsy on the floor and gettin stomp
Don't act like you ain't know, now tell yo ho to pass the blunt
You bitches wanna be cause you know that I'm the shit
You see me on the TV cause I roll wit Ludacris
Don't hate Shawnna baby, just be mad at who you wit
I keep a couple hammers so you know too I'm legit
Just so you understand, so you know I'm bout the bread (I'm bout my bread)
And don't you try to play me for a joke about my cash (I'm bout my cash)
Before I hit the tip and got my heat up out the stash (Up out my stash)

Tell me if it's out of sight, tell me if he's slow and long
Then he made his tongue above his nose, I said "You know you wrong"
But I'm really like sho' you right, tell me where you wanna go tonight
Anywhere, any place, I can see it in your face you are the prototype
To the ceiling I'm so so high, so-so feelin like I'm so so right
Please tell me why the 'dro so fire, I can't stop zonin and I don't know why
Ay look - beep beep get up out my lane, y'all hoes can't do it like me
If you're thinkin I'm 'bout the game, take a look at my U-N-I-T
That's right I'm back on deck, but don't get it twisted the strap on deck
The mac on deck, the pack on deck, and e'ry damn day keep a rack on deck
And that's on Jeff, that's on we, that's on Hoover and that's on me
That's that wood that match them seats, and that's in the Caddy and that's on 3's
No matter what they said I been gettin my bread, get my paper, get my check
But anybody wanna try to ask I've been gettin some heeeead

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
How many women can I fit up in my Cadillac?
So high I can't SEE, feelin like I got cataracts
Some in the middle of the night say I get drunk and don't know how to act
I don't know how to act

[Shawnna]
He don't know how to act
And I don't know how to stop, and I don't know how to quit
Blowin on a couple zone, now we need another fifth
And I mean I'm out my mind, not I mean I'm out my body
See we do this all night, is you comin with me shawty?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
East Atlanta slum man is where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy 'til yo' bitch came in
'Bout the same time that that thang kicked in
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up thinkin this Buffy the Body
Ain't yo' name lil' Trina? Cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin' for that action
Gucci Mane, you stupid man I love the way you flowin
Ridin' in my drop but I don't know where I'm goin
On two eighty five I keep ridin' in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple
"Gucci, show time!" Give me five mo' minutes
And a cold orange juice cause I'm really really trippin'
Went to the strip club and requested "I'm Da Man"
The next thing you know I was throwin' rubber bands

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Game]
Bitch I might be hyphy
I'm from California and these might be Nikes
Come and run up on 'em nigga I wear yo' size, you wear my size

I'm high as a plane, pop a pill disappear like David Blaine
Come back on the track, with Gucci Mane
I got ten pills, ten hoes, I'mma run a choo-choo train
All through Atlanta my new nickname is Coochie Game
I don't let 'em swallow, I show 'em how to use it mayne
Wa-da-tay my day we make 'em sell they Pootie Tang
You got some bad bitches I suggest you do the same
Treat my hoes like my cars drop 'em then blow they brains
Wash 'em up then blow they brains
If she swallow the whole bat and the ball she can roll with Game
I been a +Soulja Boy+, niggas know the name
I +Superman+ that ho, and call her +Lois Lane+

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane, Laflare nigga get your mind right
Order Crys by the twelve like a case of Bud Light
Sell kush by the bell so you know my shit tight
7:30 in the mornin on an all night flight
I'm high like Fabo, hood like Shawty
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
Like a rich rock star nigga I'm gon' party
Got a party pack of pills that's at least 'bout 40
I'll pour 'em in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pills call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pills man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill that's a damn good deal

[Hook: C-Mob][Too $hort]
All rise...order in the court
The honourable judge muthafuckin' Too $hort
Presidin' over Superior Players Court
The first case is the State vs. Fate Wilson A.K.A. Baby Flex
You bein' charged wit home invasion and ho slaughter
For fuckin' another nigga's bitch

[Lil' Fate]
Listen close to what I say
Dog, it might hurt ya
I be cuttin' ya girl while you be goin' to work bruh
When she first called my conscience was like, "Hell naw, Fate don't"
But she said, "I'm only around the corner", and popped her lil' punt
Apartment 5-7-0-1, told her I was eatin' right now
Be over there when I get done
Got there, knocked on the door
She opened up the door half naked, lookin' exquisite
Ackin' mad 'cuz I ain't spoke to her since the last time a nigga hit it
She said, "Don't worry forget it since we only have 30 minutes"
'Fore her man came home for lunch
So I bust my nut and raised up wit
Five minutes to spare, her man unaware
I saw him in traffic, beeped the horn and threw a deuce in the air
Yea I'm a playa
But I feel guilty 'bout cuttin' a broad
I need counselin' dog, 'cuz it's guilty as charged
Simply because I felt victim to lust and
Knowin' all the while it was my cousin girlfriend I had been fuckin' (Damn!)

[Too $hort]
The court finds you guitly as charged
Your sentence is PUI school
For pimpin' under the influence, nigga
Next case...
Oh we got us a repeat offender in the house
Jenny Jones A.K.A. Shanwnna
Same ol' charge...wanted in 8 states
What's yo story this time?

[Shawnna]
Oh yes yo' honor I see we talkin' again
I have no representation now shall we begin
I know you seen my face before but...hold on my friend
It's niggas gettin' away wit doin' the...same shit I did
I...can't do no bid
I got a mortgage and my kids
In a forest by the bridge
And I drives a Rolls Royce in a porridge wit dem grills
So you undertand I was tryna pay me some bills
When I was flippin' outta state while I was takin' a chill
Shootin' deem and a couple friends, spend a couple ends
Took the top off of the drop and let the bubble spin
Niggas got off in my knot and let them troubles in
So I decided to put that shit in my own hands
None of these hoes can fuck me, only God judge me
That man told me he love me and he flash money
My only crime could just be livin' it filthy
So let me hear it on mo' time--not guilty

[Too $hort]
Bailiff, take her into custody

(Woman screaming)
Oh, not my baby!
Hell naw!

[Too $hort]
Next case...
State vs. Velvet Jones A.K.A. Ludacris
You bein' charged wit impeedin' how traffic
Spendin' too much time tryna fuck one ho
How do you plead Mr. Jones?

[Ludacris]
Man I'm the pimp of all pimps and y'all comin' up short

[Too $hort]
Calm down before I hold yo ass contempt of court

[Ludacris]
Ya honor, just be cool, let me approach that bench
And sprinkle seasonin' on yo ears 'bout how I choked that beeyotch!

[Too $hort]
Well did she promise you the pussy, mayn?

[Ludacris]
She ceratinly did
I got empty McDonald's cups in my car and my crib
She owe me sumthin', bitch betta show me sumthin'
Wrap her legs around my waist and start to throw me sumthin'
I'm simply the meanest, you lookin' at the stroke of a genius
The only verdict made should be the subpoena uh this penis
No objections or appeals, let's cut us a deal
And I promise to tell the truth if my partner don't squeal
She's awfully cautious, said the jury makes her nautious
She said she said she'd suck my dick if I dropped the charges
Oh no! Time to make ya kidneys shift

[Too $hort]
But didn't you fuck her best friend?

[Ludacris]
Oh, I plead the fifth

[Too $hort talking]
Yea, that sound like some shit you'll say
Ol' pimp ass nigga
Due to lack of evidence, I'm droppin' the charges
Don't let me see you in here again
Let this be a lesson learned
If you don't know you player rules
You liable to violate the game and get sent away for a long, long time
Remember...never hate on a real player
It ain't gon' get you nowhere, mayn
It's a lotta hoes out there player so...
Ain't no reason fot yuo to fuck ya best friend
Or ya cousin or ya brother's girl
Get ya own bitch, mayn, you know what I'm sayin'?
You runnin' around here...
Violatin' major player rules
You 'bout to get the muthafuckin' book thrown at yo bitch ass
Fuckin' 'round in this court
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all about the money baby
It it ain't about the money...it ain't about SHIT!!
To all you niggas runnin' 'round here...
Corny than a motherfucker
Just tryna fuck a bitch 'cuz you wanna get a nut off
Think about that money first, mayn--what is that bitch doin' for you?
What are you gettin' outta the situation?
Tryna give a bitch sumthin'
What you gon' give her sumthin' for--some pussy?!
It's trickin', mayn
Don't be a BEEUTCH!
Be a real pimp, nigga
Make that ho pay you for everythang you do
Everythang you do you gotta get money, mayn...all day, all night
I wouldn't fuck a bitch for free
Just like I wouldn't rap for free, motherfucker
Yea, you know my favorite word...BEEUTCH!![Dru Hill]
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight... {*echoes*}

[Shawnna] + (Ludacris)
Ayyy, I can make that thang

[Hook: Dru Hill]
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight (hold tight)
Hold tight (hold tight) cause we're gonna take a ride tonight
Uh, said we're gonna take a ride
Up and down, front to back, side to side
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight (hold tight)
Hold tight (hold tight) cause we're gonna take a ride tonight
We're gonna take a riiiiiiiiide
Take a riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide tonight

[Ludacris] + (Shawnna)
You got yo' boots, strapped up
And I got my ticket, got my ticket
And I'm ready for the ride of a lifetime
Is you wit it? Is you wit it?
Fasten yo' seatbelt, buckle up
Take two shots, double up
Play this song, pump it up
Then get a little closer, snuggle up
Take yo' time I'mma take my time
Sip a little somethin then relax yo' mind
Let's do it like we never did befo' (did befo'?)
Yeah, I got you screamin "Oh my God"
The headboard hit that wall so hard
Sound like somebody knockin at the do' (at the do'?)
Yeah, keep yo' hands inside the ride
When you up in the air and ridin high
Tonight it's on, I wanna hear you moan
When I put a little kiss inside your thigh
Put a little bass inside your ear
When I whisper and tell you that daddy's here
Daddy's here, the heat is on
And I love you with your little Vickie Secrets on
Even though I'll never let you keep 'em on
Cause you pressed my button and the freak is on
Let's make it a night to remember
And bend that mattress that yo' sheets is on
Sheets is on, yank 'em off
And every little kiss I'mma make 'em soft
Yo' undergarments, take 'em off
Take 'em off so you can

Shawnna kick hot shit for bitches that got they baby daddies locked
In the pen gone; fittin to rot cause he did wrong
Run up on the cops and he hit 'em with the Glock left his wig home
Sellin rock on the big phone

Puffin the sack and we be sippin on 'gnac
Fittin to react, and pop a nigga for them stacks (OOH-OOOH!)

I gotta pop a nigga drop a nigga rock a nigga shock a nigga
Lock a nigga fuck a nigga, cop the floppin nigga
Roll for my bitches that be droppin in the strip clubs
Tryin get 'em a lil' somethin
If you gotta take it off, take it off like a boss for the big ones
Then you get you a big gun
Motherfuckers in the Chi like to put it yo' eye if it's on bitch
Put it straight to you don't miss
Now you fuckin with them gangsters, ballers, hoes, hustlers
Bangers - niggas that with them real motherfuckers like whoa!

[Hook 2X: Ludacris]
It's real real - on the block I been up for days

So now what's the deal deal?  On the street you got nothin to say
So when I see him I'ma get him (WHAT!) drill him (WHAT!)
Fill him fill him (WHAT WHAT!)

[Twista]
Twista kick hot shit for hoes and thugs
In ghettoes and clubs that get crunk; for my homies locked down
To whoever hurtin in the hood and ballers with 22's on big trucks
To my thugs that call over to they mob
And to the hustlers that be servin hydro and cocaine
To my niggas that ain't hoes; if they have to
They will steal a nigga touch a nigga check a nigga cut a nigga
Pull the trigger bust a nigga, yellow motherfucker nigga
Ready to fill and spill a drink, I'm drunk go and weed it up
And I'm talkin about go like I'm smokin the bone
Full of some shit that damn sho' wouldn't seed it up
Got you feelin the holy ghost through your body
Probably reanimated with all my Legit Ballaz rollin up
Up the streets stuffed the beats
So you see them Navigators, Escalades, Benzes
Beamers, Excursions - bumpin systems TV's and them 20's spinnin
Mob for them niggas that done came up off them hard times
K-Town, West side, South side
Murder us for the money that's why I'm known to kick a hard rhyme
Whatever set you represent throw it up
If you buck or crunk then take yo' motherfuckin shirt off
Dealers get your work off; you wanna party
Full of hustle niggas killer niggas gangsta niggas chill niggas
Baller niggas thug niggas player haters real niggas

[Hook]

[Shawnna]
I'ma kick hot shit for bitches up in the industry tryin to compete me
I'm from the hood South side, West side
Where niggas'll put a motherfuckin slug in my enemy
Motown, Pucketown, do or die
The difference between a motherfuckin thug and a gangsta
One's thug in a chamber
Get a nigga stick a nigga put him in a ditch and then forget a nigga
Hit a nigga pop a nigga little with the rocket nigga
Puff pass say you love that
We in the 'Llac and put the lemon in the 'gnac
Remy and sacks that got me scummy in the back
Puffin the raps that got me layin out slacks
And it's speakin like, "Wow, that, blunt let me hit the weed"
Cause I been feelin like
Fuck a nigga bust a nigga Shawnna never love a nigga
Chi about to show the motherfuckers how to rush a nigga
Crush that put it on momma
On everything I got a thang for the drama, puff marijuana
To things Shawnna gonna throw it on ya
Flows leave you froze in a comma
We so relentless, you know Chi gone bring the business
Blows to yo' dome in an instance
Home of them Folks and the Mo's and the King's and the Fo's
And the BD's and lows and the fiends and the hoes and God!
