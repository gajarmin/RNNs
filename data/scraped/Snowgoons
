[Hook: Sticky Fingaz]
Niggas sleeping better, WakeDaFucUp
This weed habit, drink the fuck up!
Bloody murder, you get ate the fuck up!
Your whole crew, we will break the fuck up!

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Who better than us? The fuck will spark the East coast up
Oh shit, the fucking beast woke up
From out of deep sleep, niggas is boring
Fucking all these weak beast, the beast was snoring
Now the beast is hungry, stomach is growling
Nigga ribs and such and now it’s stuck in the island
Motherfuckers is smiling but nobody smiling
‘Cause where I'm from, motherfucking niggas be wilding
And the wolves be howling
Mines be rolling, cars be stolen
We're coming out the gutter, like fucker we bowling
The shit that I’m holding
Niggas talk shit, put the fifth to your colon

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Oh shit, you done woke up the monster
I smell rappers, no wonder
It's obvious, y'all have got too comfortable
And all these rappers now a days is bullshit
You colorful like a bitch
Lala you signing and dancing, you bitch!
You need to loosen up your clothes nigga
And leave the dancing to them hoes nigga
Hip Hop started out on the block
I fell asleep at the wheel, the shit crashed into pop
When I speak, the hood got the ears up, Spock
And I’ma leave my mark and you gotta get hit with the Onyx
Nigga you know, nigga you know, nigga you know
Am I wrong? Hip Hop need a face lift
And what better face than the mad face to get?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skits Vicious]
Blades and nunchucks, brazing gun shots
When I’m done they can rake their guts up (motherfucker)
This heat turns your face to slush pop
Ride to Hell, this is Satan’s bus stop
Got a hot bitch cuffed up
Take the drugs, love, you get raped and butt fucked
I snort speed then I WakeDaFucUp
Kind of off topic but hey
I’m somewhat crazed and drunk off Jamaican rum shots
(White noise) White boy’s cables cut off
Angels dust drops, how that taste?
D.O.D. mad face, closed case

[Verse 4: Jay Reaper]
Niggas got no taste, but when I’m looking that fuckers in figures
We hard body karate, Killuminati niggas
I’m Picasso, an apostle, Hip Hop deliver
Y'all niggas pop so I'm popping a shot in your liver
Try and copy what I got and I’ll copy your chopper
Niggas claiming they heartless, we'll put 2 in yo mama
Brains leaking and your head leave you looking like pasta
Ain’t speaking cause you dead on the floor, an imposter, yeah
See I’m obsessed with this sport, lesson, I’m core
Repping with the Onyx, niggas back with the force
We back in this war, we back in, of course
So all y'all boot-legged niggas, get yo' ass to the store

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Keep sleeping, beds is burning (x3)
Keep sleeping, keep sleeping
Keep sleeping, beds is burning (x3)
Keep sleeping, keep sleeping

[Hook][Verse 1: Viro the Virus]
Yo, I light up the jar under the light of the stars
And write a few bars until the silence dissolves
Contemplatin' if I'm right or I'm wrong
For dedicatin' most my time to holdin' mics in my palm
My dream has been life long
And though the finish line is still outta sight within my plight I fight on
And I ain't singin' no sob stories of sad songs
I stick to tellin' the total truth and that's all
It's ironic when your rap's best thing
And yet somehow your career is still fledglin'
That's my predicament and it's perplexin'
But instead of sweatin' it I just keep progressin'
While waitin' for the stars to align
In a moment in time when it's my moment to shine
But until then I keep my eyes on the prize
And try to survive night-after-night goin' for mine
Because...

[Hook]
"In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time"
(It only takes a moment)
"It's the evening of another day and the end of mine"
(For your life to fly by)
"In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time"
(It only takes a moment)
"It's the evening of another day and the end of mine"
(Just to find you're outta time)

[Verse 2: Viro the Virus]
And every evening at the end of another day
I'm buckin' the system tryin' to figure out another way
And budget what I gotta pay to phone a lifeline
Hope rainy days don't last my whole lifetime (Please!)
That's why the moonlight is mine
When the moon starts to shine a feelin' moves up my spine
Yeah, I stay in tune with the shadows
Lone trooper on the road less traveled
Lone wolf, sole controller, only soldier still in the battle
Only slave on the boat who's really rowin' his paddle
Still I sit in the saddle and dip from the hassles
Others get rattled and just dibble and dabble
I think bigger, connectin' the dots on the big picture
Like identifyin' the 'Big Dipper'
Fueled by haters' comments
And one day I promise that I'll light up the sky like Halley's Comet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Viro the Virus]
I hope the struggle don't murder me
Before I find out how many people heard of V from Jersey to Germany
And yeah, I try to act fine as though all is well
But at times I feel like a snowball in hell
I'm tryin' to find my way, that's why it's all grunt work
Got no time for play, no time for games
So while my time remains I won't wait like a time delay
I say what I mean and mean what I say
Chasin' dreams night-by-night and day-after-day
I met a broad at the titty bar
Called 'Starlight' because her eyes twinkled like little stars
She had a smile that could shine for a million years
I told her I got a trail of a trillion tears
Ask if she could help me make it disappear
And felt no fear, when she said this here, she said

[Hook][Intro: Slaine]

God I think the world is about to collapse! C’mon
The buildings and walls are all falling
If you don’t know, you should by now
It’s the motherfucking Snowgoons (Snowgoons in the building)
And you’re rocking with Singapore Kane
And Slaine
Motherfucker fucking around no more
No one's fucking around. C'mon
It’s 2008 dummy

[Verse 1: Slaine]

All eyes are staring at me, people watching the villain
They see me rising with the rebels to the top of the building
Being stuck down at the bottom is the vilest feeling
Desolate soul for vodka that’s swilling, popping the pilling
Jealously swirling in their eyes, they’re plotting to kill 'em
But I been there and believe me, I ain’t forgotten the feeling
I lived the dark nights and heard the paint drops from the ceiling
I mean the raindrops hang in ‘caine spots with dealers
Now fighting a different war, smoking less, sniffing more
Every week a different chore, every month a different tour
I got a gang of haters everyday I piss 'em off a little more
What you think I got a fucking pistol for
Jealousy’s a disease that affect my enemies
They’re scheming while they’re sipping on the Hennessy
Me, I’m overseas making G’s like I stick banks
Rocking mics, sniffing foreign coke out of Swiss Francs

[Hook: Lord Lhus (X2)]

We bring the devastation, never a moment of hesitation
When we smash your face and leave your blood pasted upon the pavement
The sons of Satan, keeping it rugged, fuck the debating!
What you talking about? You weak! Our fury is full of hatred

[Verse 2: Singapore Kane]

It’s no benefits trying to test me and my affiliates
Soon as you consider it we smack dudes illiterate
Sidestep the petty shit, forever it’s a militant’s mission
To get the cheese and stretch it like mozzarella sticks
Test me, I’m ready, my girl got my machete
And she’s ready to cut your throat like Chequeta in Belly
You was hard as a rock, now you sweeter than jelly
No one believes the shit that you spit on your telly
Despite how you think it looks, I never play by the books
The silent kid in the room is really the biggest crook
Pulling out the biggest jux, fill every cranny and nook
Fight to the death with guns and knives and left hooks
Dude's talk the talk but they don’t walk any similar
We’ll separate your soul from your body like oil and vinegar
High off the sticky, insane when I’m sober
Spit poison in my verse like killer cobras

[Verse 3: Lord Lhus]

The style raw, kick it rugged like its sting’ll crack your face
This demonic place, ditched me in hell what I create
This the rhyme squad, so my mind is gone with the wind
I’m better than half you rappers who faking it like pretend
To the end I’ma murder this, MC’s keep on observing this
I hear you bite my shit and they’re gonna find you where the murder was
I kick it ill sick twisted acapella when I rock a fella
Rolling with dime bitches and cock inhalers
My rhyme is torture, slowly pulling out your guts
While your whole body soaked in alcohol and paper cuts
Then the knife slides into your right thigh
You think you might die, you right, you see the visions of your life fly
Right past you, my clique’ll really bash you
Into your skull then suck your brains out like a vacuum
My backroom is filled with goons and street thugs
Killers hate love, swing at me coward, I'll pull a straight thug

[Hook: Lord Lhus (X2)][Verse 1: Termanology]
Termanology, so uh, aye yo I
Send my condolences to any rapper holding a crown
I'mma blow his wig off his body and roast it
Rocking with my dudes flicker
Move when I'm with the goons
It's a fool run any rapper that wanna diss the crew
I'm with the Switzerland wolves we bout to spit some jewels
For the ? ? ? ? ? caring flaring with the tools
I'm the hardest spitter and I got the heart to kill you
I put your squad up in the grave then I party with you
You not soldiers you stock brokers, the Glock's smoking
I'm Pac over Nas I'mma start rock and rolling
I'm Michelangelo eating you like a cannibal
Greeting you with my hammer-lo
Deepest flow I'm mechanical
Mandible like Canibus
Render these rappers like amateurs
Panicking what she should be my uzi weighing a ton or two
I got determination, that's right the term is waiting
To turn your safe into my personal bank and burn your paper
The MC slaughterer, pardon us we make horror flicks
We chopping bodies like calamari, you pounds of fish
On a scale lucky lefty
Sonnie turn your vessy messy
It's Termanology rock with me
I be repping SC

[Hook x2: Lil' Fame]
If you don't want to get buried alive or get tossed in the grave
You better get off the ground, get off the ground
And from New York, we do it our way
You better get off the ground, get off the ground

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Yo you can't rap, understand fam you can't rap
Overhand blam, you got slapped
Now get off the ground, pull my dick off a ral
Click and hiccup the pound
Pop a few bars, who eat and devour the bars
Nice rip you a bitch, still a coward in cars
Off the marijuana, I will Sarah Conner your squad
On the scene clean, we are the champions Pa
Rap Gouda, it's a rap the gat shoot you
Dough fight the dyke, ????
Provoke Mic ice pick, your bitch shoot coolers
P, good night Pa you're a loser
Listen I rap better than most dudes
Most dudes can't rap and tap on your boat shoes
P, bust my nine
Sean Price thinking Justin Tyme, let's do it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ruste Juxx]
Machine gun skunk I blow dolo
That's why your bitch jocked me like Polo
I ain't gotta go get it cause I got it on me
I smell like palm trees, nothing but exotic on me
Hoes get erotic on me, I put the pipe down
Stick the pipe in her mouth tell her pipe down
Now lick a shot for niggas doing life inside
Grabbing you by the neck, sticking the knife inside
It's B-R-double-O-K, double A-K brining trouble your way
Knock niggas out, they can't get off the ground
Shell cases found, the cops get off the ground
So put a muzzle on that bi-suiter rap shit
Nigga knuckle up, cock rugers back bitch
Ruste Juxx bullets blow out your brain
Think it's a game, listen to Lil' Fame

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Justin Tyme]
Foul lyrical assassins, patented the truth
We gonna carry the torch son when we get in the booth
Looking for proof, ask ???
Everybody follow is watching, yeah you better salute
Nobody move until we say so, we murder ?? to BK
You better lay low ho
It's a takeover, the game's over, we stay sober
It ain't over, who told you dawg we can't honor
It's the 2K11 and we still push figures
Got mad haters, but they still don't get us
It's the Clash of the Titans, you want beef start biting
Like Iron Mike Tyson in his prime make you fighting
We got the tracks make, Mr. Who gon smash
Legendary friend, got the hook on smash
Yeah, we make all these cool girls gone mad
It's a no-brainer, bout to steal game

[Hook]

[Verse 5: H-Staxx]
Move motherfucker, what part you ain't understand
I'll murder something with the steel in my hand
Blaow, blaow, blaow
Knock something off quick
Can't dance with the wolves I walk with, we'll talk shit
We holla at the moon, let you feel that boom
Sookie, run or you are doomed
Send your punk-ass to the upper room
We do this, AMs, PMs, evenings and afternoons
Mornings it's on, a new day is dawning
Popping off over here, international warning
From New York to Switzerland, we gets it in
Competition, don't want none
We send them things whistling
Vision that, holla back it's beast mode
Unleash ??
Who gotta problem with that, hey yo Slap
These clowns get slapped, word to G-ma

[Hook][Verse 1: Sean Strange]
Yo

Punish the game, I grabbed the mic and shut your label down
Fuck all the fame, I trash your life then come and take the crown
Sean might dock, I make your whore like cock
Because before me, shorty was a poor dyke twat
Im not the type to like to keep the shit fair when I'm fightin'
If i don't have a weapon then prepare for the bitin'
Im lighting your crib up like a holiday decoration
We sick fucks thank god for my medication
I bomb on your reservation, Osama is in my basement
The problems your probly facing, the obstacles I'm creating
Illogical observation make your dream empty
I'll leave your style cramped like PMD

[Verse 2: PMD]
Aiyo

I destroy tracks with real MC's skills and tacs
PMD, Parish Making Dollars, so get the Prozac
Dom radio rap, cold plays from the shotgun
Lettin' the hands go, airin' it out, the P's hot son
Doing shows on rooftops with Nas and Rakim
P's on this indie hustle who can stop him
Nothing, so what you saying?
This is rap of the titans, still poppin' off, still producin', still writin'
Using the slack…(?)….that's no cypher
Its the grim reaper reaping, time to pay the piper
And if you still into P kid, then spark your lighter
Im on fire, PMD rocking gods attire

[Verse 3: Prevail]
From the stronghold of the BAX WARS, elite service brigade
A formidable performer with abnormal feats of strength
To great lengths, he trained
Hot suns and cold rains
Young age taught how to crack axe through foes brains
Throw spears at long distance, control the chariots reigns
Finally if combatted attitude is hand to hand
Understands the one who wins will still be standin' in the sand
Fills competitors with lead as blood splatters on the fans

[Verse 4: Mad Child]
Okay, Peter Parker, Norrin Radd
Silver Surfer, Spider Man
We can light a room up brighter than a million lighters can
Ain't nobody tighter than this titan I'm a fighter man
Quick, Vitals fans got too excited taking vitamins
Iron man on acid
Tyranny fantastic
Im a ball of fire, I'm for hire if your askin'
Calling me a liar, put that bastard in a trash can
Im a fan of P and never laughing wearing Afghan

[Verse 5: Jus Allah]
Im cutting my appetite
Just till fright night
The blood filled me up with white light
Gotta strike right when the donor is just right
Should of got the name of the owner and blood type
Maybe I should go back and roam the abduct site
Lookin' for a lady with the path to love bite
Gotta use a whole lot of Dove and plus white
Hopefully I don't smell of blood and bloodlight

[Verse 6: Impakt]
This the entourage, a revolution of rhyme
Turn that garbage music off, its pollutin' your mind
Wake up, we some Reel Wolves amongst a bunch of cloned sheep
They wanna bring you down I'm staying up like no sleep
I want it all, fuck getting a portion
I killed the fucking instrumental
Gave the beat an abortion
Im a titan up right here exciting your life when I'm writin'
Ignitin' the mic, I'm fightin' like Tyson strickin' like lightning
Impakt, got the strength and i hold the force
To keep deliverin' the …(?)… with no remorse
Ill take your son, highway to hell yeah I'm trafficking
Somebody let me out my cage, I'm a savage beast

[Verse 7: ODoub]
Don't be a retard
I was killing it when the beat start
Youll see stars, got fans screaming like teens at them parks
Spitting mean bars, every line i come to life
My musics beautiful
You make butter faces with underbites
And you the sucka type, homie time to take off
I break jaws, tackling faggot rappers off skateboards
And fuck you whack dudes
Im bout to puff a fat deuce
Then cover my body full of illuminati tattoos

[Bridge: Sean Strange] x2
Yo get the fuck back, we run rap
(Reach in to the toolbox)
Cause every one whack, we on maps
(Spawned in the Goondox)
Die fighting, flesh cracker to lightning
Knife in the back from the raps of the titans

[Verse 8: Klee Magor]
Swing the battle-axe, unleash my Hit Squad
The cliques hard, like a pack of Reel Wolf savages in the yard
You step on land mines, your man dies
Body blown apart
Napoleon Bonopart, ….(?)
Fighting like David and Goliath
Try and face a messiah
The fire is higher
Never put my faith in …(?)
The mind of a writer, the heart of a lion
Apart of a dyin', divine breed
More to me before I stab your arteries
With raps of the titans
Strengthened with lines that I'm writin'
Hear the blast of the siren
…(?)…trapped with the iron
Im fighting like on my own verse is an Aztec
I blast tech, slash necks
Smash you in the face with a brass knuck

[Verse 9: Virtuoso]
Yo, Yo
Its the spas metropolis
With the sky's black apocalypse
Your fascist politics of oppression make digestion impossible
Need acidophilus
Either that or a lot of clips
You weak faggots soft as shit
Get left in a necropolis
Colossal, the Raps of the Titans
Im faster than lightning
Like a vampire bat I will siphon crimson plasma from your cadaver
Through chrome capture this, brimstone vernacular
Virtuoso master of the microphone masters

[Verse 10: Meth Mouth]
Its the meth eugenic lieutenant
Anti-federal veteran
Since 9/11 I've been hidin' and plottin' my regiment
I can't afford not to be independent
A definite detention for these rappers is evident
I ain't let 'em out, the torcher chamber
I am a force of nature
The foulest to record a banger
Since they put cameras in the court of Bodega
This ain't Shawshank Redemption, but I'm sure to shank you
You ain't sure to wake up, you swaying thought you'd destroy your maker

[Verse 11: Shallow Pockets of Psych Ward]
On that medieval shit
If you walking on needle tips
Shallow Pockets talk illegal, rob your leadership
Up to me to make your heart pump beat skip
Plus this speak will … (?) bleed trip
Cut deeper than a cleaver with a clean tip
Blow a hole through your people like a clean inch
Reel Wolf, my squad team flicks
Snowgoons, Goondox, thats the streets best

[Verse 12: J Nyce of Psych Ward]
J Nyce turn the stage to the colosseum
Yeah, burn a flag for the non-believers
Whats swag, y'all fags, whats the meaning?
Cut bad, y'all mad, y'all screaming
Fuck rap, stop that y'all dreaming
My young bucks got you rug rats fleeting
Reel Wolf, show their teeth and you bleedin'
Psych Ward thats the team of the season

[Verse 13: Jaysaun]
Now I don't know nothing but Karate or Kung Fu
But I've been here before the Art of War without Sun Tzu
So I just let the bullets take flight like a javelin, travellin'
I don't deal with the back and forth babblin' of battlin'
Nah, beefs unravellin'
Blood starts spatterin'
So turn the lights on watch the roaches are scatterin'
Choke …(?)... your poked in the abdomen
Thats pure savagery, grabbin' men, stabbin' them
Apocalypto, rockin' a sling
Or bong hits with a skitzo while your knockin' the king
When they say Jaysaun, ain't nothin you can say to the God
But when you see me, the deity, just pray to the God[Prevail][Intro]
Ill Bill
Apathy
Brooklyn goons to Snowgoons
Demigodz, LCN
Doe rakers

[Hook] -- Apathy
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow

[Verse 1] -- Ill Bill
I'm a diamond in the rough
Leave hollows in the gun
Leave large holes in your skull
Cause you ain't never coming home
You'll never fucking survive
I'm leaving nothing alive
Nobody's gonna escape
Everybody's gonna die
Like the angel of death
Creep up with the four-fives
And chrome nines
No love lost and no smile
No mercy, no retreat
No surrender, coke and heroin
I'm the man on the street
Like a old school metalhead
Riding dirty, mind perverted
Shooting pornos behind the iron curtain
Do more dirt than Tide detergent
Fuck peace, I'm a violent person
My mind's a distorted and fucked-up pile of wires and circuits
Uncle Howie Records there be drugs around me forever
A foundation of terror that rise together
Buck off dimes and motherfuck dames together
We fight til the motherfucking death and die together, La Coka

Chorus

[Verse 2] -- Apathy

Motherfucker I'm Zeus
In a bubble goose with Timberland boots
They try to hang me with a noose
I rip the tree from its roots
You in cahoots with Lhus
Suffer if you got a den of some hating troops
I got a blender full of forbidden fruits
The force of my flows could fracture forty bottles
Got a posse of apostles and pussy from supermodels
I'm a monster in mosh pits, powerful as Pac spits
Launching rockets from Glock clips and my six
The Mossberg moss and that kill sound clash
Only fuck thick chicks with a big round ass
Outlast motherfuckers, I'll be taking out trash
Need to get up, get out, just listen to Outkast
Ap's flows smack foes, jack dough, mack hoes
Spitting rhymes, making dictators resign like Castro
The heavy ammunition is the weapons of choice
Run up on these motherfuckers like, "Sprechen sie Deutsch?"

Chorus[Hook]
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Yeah, if you want it, you can get it right here
You can get stuffed in the trunk in the rear
Niggas gettin dunked in the pier
Rollin' thru the truck with a blunt in the ear
Think it until you make the dope, you're no high roller
I can sip two beers, I can turn bipolar
Schizo, crazy, I'm flipped, I warped
That's why no more fuckin' with prescription drugs
Everybody got stuck on that road to stardum
But the banks aren't empty, shanks aren't empty
My brain's all safety, I'm locked to the beat
Neva fall off, even if I loose my feet
I work all day, so I sleep all night
Then wake up with the Bentley with the football lights
That's how I took yo wife
Told "baby, we can kick it like a football high"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Sticky fingers, God of the underground
Girls be like "Oh my God" when I come around
You waskally wabbits, now I gotta gun 'em down
First you wanted beef, now you givin' me the runaround
I'll take yo pride, you'll give me my respect
See if you can cash this reality check
I'm half from Ret, but rest assured
When it come to ya'll niggas, less is more
Yeah, I took the hustlers oath
They said money don't grow on trees, I'm raking the doe
Make something outta nothin', that's my upbringing
We don't play God but we got the club swingin'
I'm br-br-br-br-brolic, don’t need no trainer
Don't need no friends, don't need no favors
I'm way too loud, I don't need no neighbors
Shawty ain't giving head? Well that's a no-brainer

[Hook][Verse 1: PMD]
Time to time, travel back in time
When I wanted to be a b-boy, when I wanted to rhyme
Listen to the Magic rap attack, tryin' to get mine
Dreams of a * world premiere, ready to shine
Way before satellite, radio, * and *
Before the internet, GPS and textin'
Before the e-mail, cellphone, Fed Ex and
Hip-hop was in the making
Kool Herc, Bambaata, Zulu Nation
I was only 13, but I was tuned in
Checkin' and peepin' the new movement
My brother * was signed to Tommy Boy Records
Connected, years later met Sermon, started to wreck shit
* * down, I was * * * of the * Squad
* * * * the birth of the Hit Squad
EMPD, Das EFX, Redman and K-Solo
Knuckleheads, Boondocks, I'm on a slow flow

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Strange]
Ey, yo, I been * hip-hop, kept me alive
Ready to die, never that, in fact, heavily grind
From * * to halftime, my mind I can't find
Some times the man cried, * * * * *
You should pay attention, take a * from the great depression
My tape collection responsible for the cake I'm catchin'
And now I got the game locked like I'm state correction
My brain's reflection is deadlier than the * *
Sean * * * before the show, gotta roll the dutch
I'm * * *, I throw you up in the * *
I'm old enough, I like being covered up like a * *
Until I grab the mic, prepare to * * *, now hold it up
I paid my dues, you can't deny that I grind, dog
And rhyme bars * when I'm on the mic feel like I'm God
PMD the teacher gave me knowledge that'll rock the crowd
I'm all around the world, motherfucka, ain't no stoppin' now

[Hook][Intro]
The brain controls every human action
Voluntary or involuntary
Every breath, every heartbeat, every emotion
If the soul exists, it exists in the brain

[Verse 1: Viro the Virus]
As a lyricist I flip scripts way on some different shit
And spit to pick at your brain like The Mentalist
Though some bump their guns like a tattle tale
I'm Top Gun, number one like an alpha male
Nightingale fly in the pole position
So sick, niggers forfeit on their own volition
While I chief on organic plants to keep my brain performance enhanced
Plus my third eye wide, can't override my hard drive
Now jive, I pass you by to the far side
Cause encounters of unusual rhymes off the powers of a beautiful mind
And it's a shame some lames can't manage
How the ways of the game can make your brain damaged
But what you seek you shall find
If you just peek inside, use the eye in your mind

[Hook: Viro the Virus]
Yo, it's all in your mind
So go hard on your grind like your soul's on the line
Time is the inner mind's eye
If you just keep it wide you can see through the lies
Cause it's all in your mind
To survive in hard times, you can't stall on your grind
You never now what you'll find
If you open your mind cause it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind, it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind, is it all in your mind?

[Verse 2: Qualm]
Ey yo they listen through the fiber optics
Don't try your options
Provide the doctrine

Recieve the message
Police investing

My mind acknowledge his
Stay wary
Bring war and the God turn to Ares

The nature of the beast is beyond what you can think
This instict that make the Pope turn your chest ?
Simply I do it cause I gotta not cause I oughtta
The ghetto saga raised me no father

I move proper psyched-out bitches is head doctors
Crazy bitch trapped a few bugs in my apartment
Got love for Mary Jane like Peter Parker would offer
Cut music in my veins
You hear the bass when my heart pumps

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Knowledge]
Through my mind's eye, doze along, time pass by
Move with a cold shoulder, arm pointed all times
Feet in the fire, while the beast behind
So I stick and move like Ali in his prime
It's just my will to survive
Primal instict with DNA tied strong minds
Long lives we live, some cursed, some doing the bid
Locked in a box where the animals live
Burnin' the piff while I roll with the cannibal kids
Some Hannibal shit, livin' life on a wimb
Out on a limb, nice with the hands
Nice with the gun, nice with a pen
Mentally prepared for the win
Black hoodies, black shirt, black tims
Black burner, black ski mask and accidents
Black trash bags and packages
It's all mathematics, you livin' life backwards

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lord Lhus]
Lhus is gifted, I keep my feet planted when I'm lifted
Get levitated with force before my target, but missed it
Stay spliffted, I roll the dice in life with antichrist
Communicating through mics with families in afterlife
I seen the poltergeist, it arose through smoke and lights
Broke the ice with visions of Armageddon, the return of Christ
I see burning ice and the loss of Earth's gravity
Insanity, slipping away, but something was grabbing me
The hands of space, I was chosen to procreate
By an alien race ten million light years away
What a beautiful thing, so great that I couldn't see
Billions of people on earth, but they chose me
Slowly my brain took on this incredible thought
Looked down upon Earth as it was falling apart
I blacked out from the image and when I opened my eyes
To my surprise I realised you're living life just to die
You still wonder why[Intro]
"The brain controls every human action; voluntary or involuntary. Every breath, every heartbeat, every emotion. If the soul exists... It exists in the brain."

[Verse 1: Viro The Virus]
As a lyricist I flip scripts way on some different shit
And spit to pick at your brain like The Mentalist
Though some bump their gums like a tattle-tale
I’m top gun, number one like an alpha male
Nightingale fly in the pole position
So sick niggas forfeit of their own volition
While I chief on organic plants
To keep my brain performance enhanced
Plus my third eye wide, can’t override my hard drive
No jive, I pass you by to the far side
Cause encounters of unusual rhymes
Off the powers of a beautiful mind
And it’s a shame some lames can’t manage
How the ways of the game can make you brain-damaged
But what you seek you shall find
If you just peek inside, use the eye in your mind

[Hook: viro the virus]
Yo, it’s all in your mind so go hard in your grind
Like your soul’s on the line
Time is the inner mind’s eye
If you just keep it wide you can see through the lies
Cause it’s all in your mind
To survive in hard times you can’t stall on your grind
You never know what you’ll find
If you open your mind cause it’s all in your mind
It’s all in your mind, it’s all in your mind, it’s all in your mind
Is it all in your mind?

[Verse 2:]
Hey yo they listen through the fiber optics
Don’t try your options, provide the doctrine
And eyes is watching illegal connections
The eagle’s nest is the people’s death
In the center of the beast with wings, receive the message
Police investing, crime profit the deepest essence
But my mind acknowledges nervous habits as secrets present
Stay wary, bring war on the god, turn to Ares
Thinking prepares me, no talking from where you squares be
The nature of the beast is beyond what you can think
It’s instinct that make the pope turn your chest to miss me
Simply I do cause I gotta, not cause I oughta
The ghetto saga, raised with no father?
I move proper, psyched out bitches is head doctors
Crazy bitch dropped a few bugs in my apartment
Got love for mary jane like Peter Parker with?
Got music in my veins, you hear the bass when my heart pump

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Knowledge]
Through my mind’s eye saw a long time pass by
Move with a cold shoulder, arm pointed all times
Feet in the fire while the beast behind
So I stick and move like Ali in his prime
It’s just my will to survive
Primal instinct, my DNA ties, strong minds
Long lives we live, some cursed, some doing a bid
Locked in a box where the animals live
Burning the piff while I roll with the cannibal kids
Some Hannibal shit, live a life on the whim out on a limb
Nice with hands, nice with the gun, nice with the pen
Mentally prepared for the win
Black hoodies, black shirt, black Timbs
Black burner, black ski mask and accidents
Black trash bags and packages
It’s all mathematics, you living life backwards

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lord Lhus]
Lhus is gifted, I keep my feet planted when I’m lifted

[Hook][Intro]

Das wird dir zu Absztrakkt, vielleicht verstehst du das, "I just don't give a fuck..."
Snowgoons!
Das wird dir zu Absztrakkt, vielleicht verstehst du das, "I just don't give a fuck..."
Yeah!

[Part I: Jinx]

Die letzte Bastion in Nordrhein-Westfalen ist das Hochland
Nur die Stadt des Lichts hält der schwarzen Legion dank der Tradition stand!
Drei an der Zahl durchschwärmen in der Nacht diesen Torgang
Sie halten Wache am Ortsrand und stützen die Nacht wie die Vorfah'n!
Die Bodyguards! Jeder Feind erstarrt bei den Worten und weiß
Dass Kugeln nicht treffen, scharfer Stahl nicht durchbohr'n kann!
Auch das Blei aus deiner Gun hat somit keine Relevanz
Mehr für den einwandfreien Stand dieser Verteidigungsphalanx!
Yeah! Ich führ' die Guardian-Klinge
Es fall'n Granaten vom Himmel, wenn ich die Bars überbringe!
Nach dem Gefecht steh' ich vor städtegroßen Kratern und springe
Doch wenn ich unten aufkomm', rührt sich nicht ein mal eine Linse! [Der Ninja]
Die Hochlandkinder inspiriert die Tradition der Ninja
Wir sind unauffindbar, bis an dir mal wieder ein Dämon 'rumfingert!
Dann gibt's Strophenschwinger direkt auf die Nuss gezimmert
Mission Complete! Es wächst Gras nach, wo wir hin lang'!
Wir schau'n uns gern an, wie gut du die Sache kannst
Und vielleicht macht dich das mal zum Security-Praktikant
Doch zur Zeit sind wir das einzige Movement in diesem Land
Dass weiß: Allein der Sinn für das Gute hält uns zusamm'!
58! Wir sind zwar nicht lupenrein wie'n Brilliant
Doch ein Super-MC-Verband auf Tonmelodien und Drums!
Und wenn du mich fragst: Tu dir das Beef nicht an
Wir sind Jahrelang als Verfechter der Trueschool-Schiene bekannt!

[Part II: Absztrakkt]

Kein Grund, daran festzuhalten, also lass' ich los
Der Bodhiguard, ich pass' nur noch zu den Großen wie [?]!
Und ich mein' damit die großen der nächsten Generation!
Neues 58-Shirt aus dem Schrank, das alte in die Dreckwäsche!
Ich trag' in mir den Red Dragon
Doch bei deinem Auftritt Almosen sammeln ist die einzige Art, wie ich dich weg battle!
Du stirbst langsam! Ich steck' in der Schlechtheit wie 'ne Heftzwecke
Und sie verliert ihr Blut bei mir auf der Bettdecke!
Du meinst, wenn ich rhyme denk' ich um sechs Ecken
Aber ich denk' um sechs Dimension' und rhyme immer next Level!
Mit außergewöhnlichen Mitteln, so idealistisch
Ich könnt' mit einer Punchline direkt alles Böse vernichten!
Die Druckwelle würde dir das Fleisch von den Knochen zieh'n
Und du würdest enden als blödes, sprödes, poröses Gerippe!
Aber es würde zu viele treffen, die noch Potential für besseres hätten!
Du Dämon bekommst die rötliche Spritze, so groß wie 'ne Posterrolle
Mit Todesfolge! Lass' deine babylonischen Wichsgriffel vom Diamantgeiszt!
Meine Personenkontrolle eskaliert!
Bullen fixier'n mich zu viert und neh'm mich mit auf's Revier!
Ey Bulle! Weißt du nicht: Mein Rap ist der Shit im Revier?!
Ruf' den Staatsanwalt an, ich hab' nix zu tun mit Gangsterkram!
Du schützt Gesetze, gemacht von Machtmissbrauchenden Menschen
Ich schütz' das Glück mit Macht im Raum ohne Grenzen!

[Part III: Sirviva]

Ich prügel' dich durch Spiegelkabinette bis zur Selbsterkenntnis
Spür' die Grenzen deiner Existenz als Exkrement
Und wenn ich dir das Übel aus der Psyche würge
Bis das letzte Fünkchen Überheblichkeit dein eminentes Lächeln ist!
Weggefickt! Es ist Krieg, ich werde nicht das Messer zieh'n
Ich schicke dich auf Ketamin durch Felder voller Tellermin'
Durch die Rezeptoren deines Serotonins, bis du den Dämon siehst
Vor dem dein großes Ego flieht, als wenn er nach dem Chemo-Trip
In schwerer Depression versinkt! So wird es
Wenn du olle Fotze mich zum toben bringst! Ohne Shit!
Du willst mich am Boden seh'n
Doch ohne mich wirst du von den negativen Emotionen totgefickt!
Brumme nicht! Dein Kopf bekommt die Medizin in Form von roher Energie!
Du Vogel torkelst wie getroffen von dem Basey aus der lächerlichen Szenerie
Und wirst noch aus dem Bett getreten! Hier wird nicht dein Film gedreht!
Willkomm' in der Realität!
Es int'ressiert nicht wirklich nicht, wie du sie findest
Denn du wolltest sie im Sterben seh'n! Du sollest besser sterben geh'n!
Geh' aus dem Weg, ich hab' grad' andere Probleme, denn ich folgte, um mein Wert zu seh'n!
Mit Herz und Takt, verstehst du das?
Ich rede mit der Wand, denn sie ist wenigstens gerade und sie hält den Schlägen stand!
Mein Karma wird mich gut belohn', solange, bis ich glücklich bin
Dein Karma ist ein Hurensohn und wartet im Gebüsch auf dich!

[Outro]

"You're a bitch [babbling?] son of a Babylonian bastard
Bad Karma!"[Verse One: Masta Ace]
Walking through my hood feeling good about my destiny
I realize that God's only testing me
I can't complain cause when I look at the game
I see dudes that got a whole lot less than me
A lot of dudes got a lot more stress than me
I'm Looking Out The Front Door like Extra P
Other cats still stuck in the backyard
Everyone running round like a track squad
Just cause you rap hard, don't mean the fans care
Cause you can have a lot of hype, a lot of fan fair
It don't mean your air play is gon' match that
Heavy row you be happy to get half that
When I think about it, I'm quite fortunate
Cause this is something that I never made a fortune with
But looking at the grand scheme of things
It was never 'bout them black Benz and Beamer dreams

[Scratch Hook]
"It was all a dream" - Notorious B.I.G. 'Juicy'
"A never ending saga when I rap to these beats" - Gang Starr 'The Squeeze'
"Never forget where you came from
Never forget where you got your name from
And the game from" - Cali Agents 'Neva Forget'
"Now before making records the hood was my savior" - Lords Of The Underground 'Tic Toc'
"New York, New York" - Rakim 'New York, New York'
"Are you ready?"
"Original heads represent the Brooklyn all night" - The Crooklyn Dodgers 'Crooklyn'

[Verse Two: Strick]
Where I'm from, record label niggas won't come
They say they will, get you all thrilled and don't come
Damn, I think I said that on an old joint
Cause it was true and you dudes kinda missed the whole point
Yeah, so then I bounced to see some other places
Try some new ideas, see some other faces
I even tried to take a break from rapping
Then I decided to break so I could make it happen
When I'm home I see the same cats I started with
Trying to start their career with the same starter kit
My phone rings but I'm scared to answer
Cause they gon' ask me some things that I don't really care to answer
It's not that I'm the greatest or I'm balling out
It's just that I'm good where I'm at and that's what it's all about
But looking at the grand scheme of things
It was never 'bout them black Benz and Beamer dreams

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Masta Ace]
Was I rapping hoping I could cop a black five?
Prolly, I wanted to be one of those rap guys
Popping the champagne cork getting baptized
But God said "no" and the boat capsized
Then I washed up on shore and discovered that
If you doing this and don't have a love of rap
If you covet that crown for the king of things
You just living for them black Benz and Beamer dreams

[Scratch Hook][Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze] (x2)
This is Black Ops, I ain't talking about Xbox
This is war with drugs and gangs and black cops
Watch your back or end up with your back shot
In Philly it feels like we playing a game of Black Ops

[Verse 1]
Gun shots burst and hit a fiend, your enemy's curses
Many things are not guaranteed but death is certain
In the bushes in all black is an insurgent
Strapped with a bomb to his person waiting to hurt shit
The street level surface is filled with workers goin' shirtless
Trained in the weapons of torture
And the oppressed just live with it
It sounds like Iraq or maybe a Palestinian village but
If you change just a few details you see Hell
It's in the same streets that we dwell
Where they hardly spar, they get their arms to call?
Mask on like Mardi Gras and leave you harshly scarred
It is God we call from when there's no answer it's arms we draw
Hit a house from the dogs of war, this the place where you meet death
You can't stop the game, there's no reset

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Revolution in the hour of black steel, raps filled
With the plague attack from the black hills
Storming the Bastille with a bat to smack grills
Selling sex, death, guns, crack, pills, your last meal
All that's up for grabs, cops with batons
Got their foot all up your ass
Hear the blast when that thing crash up the ave
It's just a game, no winners, we all come in last
Helicopters in the hood to remind us Hell's upon us
The light shines in the manhunt the hood Osamas
And their baby mamas hiding hoping they don't find them
But the black Black Ops swarmed on em like piranhas
There's no glory to be found, no honour
Kill or be killed or beg for mercy from your honour
It's sad fam but the facts stand
It ain't too difference for an American black man or a brother who's Afghan

[Hook][Intro]
Ill Bill
Apathy
Brooklyn goons to Snowgoons
Demigodz, LCN
Doe rakers

[Hook] -- Apathy
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow

[Verse 1] -- Ill Bill
I'm a diamond in the rough
Leave hollows in the gun
Leave large holes in your skull
Cause you ain't never coming home
You'll never fucking survive
I'm leaving nothing alive
Nobody's gonna escape
Everybody's gonna die
Like the angel of death
Creep up with the four-fives
And chrome nines
No love lost and no smile
No mercy, no retreat
No surrender, coke and heroin
I'm the man on the street
Like a old school metalhead
Riding dirty, mind perverted
Shooting pornos behind the iron curtain
Do more dirt than Tide detergent
Fuck peace, I'm a violent person
My mind's a distorted and fucked-up pile of wires and circuits
Uncle Howie Records there be drugs around me forever
A foundation of terror that rise together
Buck off dimes and motherfuck dames together
We fight til the motherfucking death and die together, La Coka

Chorus

[Verse 2] -- Apathy

Motherfucker I'm Zeus
In a bubble goose with Timberland boots
They try to hang me with a noose
I rip the tree from its roots
You in cahoots with Lhus
Suffer if you got a den of some hating troops
I got a blender full of forbidden fruits
The force of my flows could fracture forty bottles
Got a posse of apostles and pussy from supermodels
I'm a monster in mosh pits, powerful as Pac spits
Launching rockets from Glock clips and my six
The Mossberg moss and that kill sound clash
Only fuck thick chicks with a big round ass
Outlast motherfuckers, I'll be taking out trash
Need to get up, get out, just listen to Outkast
Ap's flows smack foes, jack dough, mack hoes
Spitting rhymes, making dictators resign like Castro
The heavy ammunition is the weapons of choice
Run up on these motherfuckers like, "Sprechen sie Deutsch?"

Chorus[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm at the opera sitting up in the balcony
Gun aimed at the valkeyrie
Backstage I dabble in black magic & alchemy
Briefcase of cash, passports with a fake name
Traveling through Russia with bombs on a freight train
Turn popes to cokeheads cause they broke bread with goat heads
Paranoid skitzophrenics with no meds
Weaving through the Vatican traffic on a moped
Carrying machine guns, cops scream code red
Command center computers scramble to find intruders
Police scan the local rooftops for sharp shooters
I'm cold as Siberia, flow is so superior
The smell of cigars stain Mercedes interior
The black snow, black hole leader like Castro
I'm sitting in a cemetery poisoning black crows
The mass knows nothing of my fiendish plots
They try deciphering the rhymes that this genius drops
I concoct concoctions to make your heartbeat stop
We're locked in a Russian gulag sleeping on old cots
Guards moving like robots patroling the cellblocks
30 below zero, who the hell said Hell's hot?
I swore to my maker I'd never spit a wack flow
Or spend eternity in Hell shoveling black snow

[Hook: Ill Bill]
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we are after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow

[Verse 2: Sicknature]
The Snowgoons are battering rams through your speaker
Hazardous craft that´ll freeze ya
Earthquaking bangers and them smackers that slap up the sleepers
Landscapes are collapsing when we shatter the sets
We are like the Four Horsemen breathing down the back of your neck
Curtains are met for competition with no further regrets
Have you floating the ocean face down with a bird on your head
I'm leaving rivals flabbergasted, minds can have you backless
That´s why I´ll design my raps to chop heads off like flying battle-axes
Green Mile on beat, killing it, you as relevant as garbage
Stomp through your empire like the elephants of Carthage
Colder than the poles when the notions are woven
Stay in control and always keep one eye open like Odin
When the market is too numb we march to the goon drum
'Till it´s a wrap, leaving you wrapped in a carpet of goosebumps
The storm comes, there´ll be no time for a last phone call
When the dark skies open to let the black snow fall

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
I got a sinister plot to administer shots
Samurais that let hammers fly, ninjas with Glocks
Bust through brick walls, walk through glass
Terminator Titled, let 'em live, why would I do that?
Dumping everything I got at ya
Don't you think it's odd that I run this shit from Antarctica to Ottawa?
Stuff you in a garbage truck,cause you been trash
Wear your hat straight, but I'll put snaps where your brim at
Make you rock a special needs helmet cause you been wack
Uppercut punch, left you bent back
Halfway up your nose was the chin strap
The doctor handed me some notes and this graph
That said this boy need a skin graft
I don't talk to cops so save that report
My interrogation video's a Charlie Chaplin short
So when you hear the gat blow we comin' through the backdoor
I let the brrrat go repping for Black Snow

[Hook][Intro: Absztrakkt]
Der Track is' für euch ihr Helden
Für die Helden des Alltags
Claudio, der Song is' für dich

[Hook: Cr7z]
Gibst du die Liebe in die Herzen so erblüht die Rose
Auch wenn sie dich nie belohnen weiß ich doch, du ziehst das durch
Selbst wenn dieser Zeiten Zeichen weiter Krieg und Tod sind
Wirst du nich' müde, sondern fügst dich still zu ihrem Wohle
In Güte und Mitgefühl, ohne, dass man dir ein Lob gibt
Solang wiederholen bis die Wesen hier in Frieden wohnen
Hilfst, wenn ich in tiefer Not bin
Du bist ungerühmt, unerkannt und doch da - aus dem Schatten wie Shinobi

[Verse 1: Absztrakkt]
Ich hass' es wenn ihr besoffen und ich hass' es wenn ihr drauf seid
Und dann hass' ich mich wieder selber, denn dann rauch ich mich auch breit
Um das alles zu ertragen
Lass mich, ich bin nich' meditativ (lass mich)
Ich war nur mehr als die Hälfte meines Lebens bekifft
Ich will ehrlich zu dir sein:
Für die Mehrheit der Menschen ist mein Denken gestört
Du solltest gut aufpassen, wenn du mich hörst
Du weißt, dass ich in Sekten lebe, doch egal
Du kannst weiter mit Insekten leben
Ich respektiere Insektenleben, doch rap' für die Elite
Ich werd das nich' weiter vertiefen
Doch ihr seid die Sterne die für andere leuchten werden
Und die Nachricht wird euch erreichen

Facebook sagt, die meisten von euch sind jetzt zwischen 18 und 35
Mein Jahrgang fängt langsam an, gesellschaftlich was zu reißen - '79
Ich setz' nix auf, ich freu mich richtig
Meine Zähne sind schlecht, doch mein Lächeln ist echt
Du hast dich in die Nesseln gesetzt
Der Kampf gegen uns selber ist das letzte Gefecht
Ich hatte auch andere Pläne, doch hegte und pflegte unter anderem die demenzkranke Marlene
Du rappst für die Szene und hast damit gepunktet
Doch wenn du Rap aus 'nem ehrlichen Grund willst stößt er an auch in dei'm näheren Umfeld
Also bleibst du allein - weißt wie ich mein?

[Hook: Cr7z]

[Verse 2: Absztrakkt]
Energievampire werden gewollt gezüchtet
Ich bin in die Falle getappt, hab spirituellen Stolz entwickelt
Du bist voll bemittelt und alle feiern dich
Nur was machst du, wenn du alleine bist?
Was machst du dann, wenn es keiner sieht?

Langsam verkleinert sich das Bild meiner Jugend
Ich wurde groß mit gestrecktem Piece, mit schlechtem Weed und mit billigem Fusel
Aber ich finde die Ruhe - yeah
Denn ich weiß, sie liegt nur in einem zufriedenen Geist
Also bau' ich kein' Scheiß - lieber Medi statt Fernsehen
Lieber Training und Anstrengung statt bequemlicher Ablenkung
Lieber Anwendung statt Theorie, Disziplin statt Weed
Kochen statt Fastfood; Wasser statt Cola, Großzügigkeit statt Geiz - sowas

Ich trag Liebesperlen im Patronengurt für dich Totgeburt
Und grüße die Blockbanger auf dem Weg zum Jobcenter
Niedriglohnsektor - Realnessprotektor, niemals Aggressor
Und dann auf den Streets wie'n Professor
Droppt er die Knowledge, die dir hilft, dir selber zu helfen
Wonich?? es ist pur Essenz, du musst es nur erkennen
Ich trau den Helden des Alltags, aber nicht denen, die uns regier'n
Wir sollten uns selber organisieren
Von A bis Z, und ab jetzt steht dazwischen nur das B und das S -
Bodhishinobi[Verse 1 - Fredro Starr]
Hey yeah, we're coming in
You can feel the place crumbling
Gotta tumble in
Legal back it up, nigga come again!
We're coming in
You can feel the base crumbling
Gotta tumble in
Niggas chop it up, we gotta dumb again
Son, throw your guns again
Shots for the dead and gone
Niggas that wrong, took your chain
You got dead it on
Broke killers, dope dealers what I'm rapping for
Them broke niggas, that's why I keep rapping forward
I keep rapping till get reprimanded
The way I shoot with the left, niggas think I'm left-handed
Niggas get left stranded with the tech 9
When I connect 9, leave your body ready to collect time
Never let nobody disrespect my
Rushed where you were when you hit me on your right lines
Cause anything you say can and will be used against you
And this against the shit that you don't want a nigga into

[Hook]
Powerful impact Boom, boom!
Powerful impact Boom, boom!

[Verse 2 - Sticky Fingaz]
Fuck on this stranded wing
Gun shots let it rip
I still play the blank blink
This is what you better get
Death is always settling, fuck your confederate
20 years later, same niggas, just a better whip
Ya niggas delicate, one hitch ahead and split
I don't work for penuts
I'm a tiger, not an elephant!
But for now I stay to quit just for the hell of it!
Just to bitch at asses once I call settlement
Ain't nothing changed but the Glock and the caliber
You funny ass niggas is not in my caliber
Caught me acting crazy, you can pop in the cabbage, bro
Niggas need to stop, before I caught back the hammer
I scream so much, I type in all caps
You couldn't fuck with me, if I was writing your raps
What if no gangsta said if it's feel right and [??]
Sticky Fingaz get niggas hype and all that

[Hook][Intro]
Have you ever heard the legend of the Boxcutter Samurai?
He was a great warrior

[Verse 1]
On the real none more alive than this
Just a rhyme with this
Your gonna need survival kits
Beat the flow and how live it is
Your team is all turkeys like [?]
Our sum is wild, y'all can't handle sun like Irish kids
You ain't never heard this type of shit
I spit on types of plague and viruses
I don't know what style it's in
Or what a stylus is
I just huff and puff and turn your house into a pile of bricks
Dialysis surrounded by heavy hate
You're testing fate
You die laughing like Chevy Chase
Wait, No way, no weight but it's got heavy bass/base
CBC we got heavyweights in every state
See me coming mean it's time to go
The lost cauze make you see stars like kaleidoscope
You must be high on dope
I don't even know how you grieve with so many dicks lodged inside your dome
It's the boxcutter samurai

[Hook]
Samples

[Verse 2]
Smoke a glassy bowl
On the grassy knoll
Me and my man make classics like Abbey Road
I'm the baddest 'fro
I'll be gladly known as a nasty foe 'til I'm paid like Daddy Knowles
Word to Solange I bomb, I'm Pompeii
Three stacks like Andre, rap beyond gay
I bring that masculinity back
This, that, evaporate into raw energy rap
Keep the town wet
With spit that ain't reach the ground yet
[?] it's two legs and ran in fear of my sound check
Disgusting like a hound's breath, after he found flesh
Blood spews from pews
When I'm found dressed in the sharpest threads
I'm off my meds and you're marked for dead
Wearing dicks across your head
Wearing [?] as a skirt
You're a fucking jerk
Get your mother merced
Like she's a shuttleworth[?]
The boxcutter Samurai

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah. It's a lock cos I hold the key
Who you supposed to be?
The gold[?] MC?
To outdope MCs
Leave 'em holding like rosarys
Holds[?] a ring around the face so you won't know it's me
The game was taught rather than sold to me by the oldest G's
Who sell coke and love they kids and hold their toasters squeezed
Hurt in their eyes and scars on the back of their hands
Back to the bar playing cards with cigars in their hands
And inhale wisdom
And blow back a swarm of locusts
Man I'm focused
Stay well lit like royal oak is[?]
Be the opus
Snowgoons beats is focused
Animal in it to commit acts atrocious
FBI got posters and photos of my soldiers
Inside of black folders, trying to fool us
But we remain wizards that's cloakless
Open razor, black roses, to rap for Moses
The Samurai

[Outro]
Samples[Intro]
You know why we here, you know what we came to do

[Hook]
When I go buc buc, you better buc back
(Buc buc buc buc. Buc buc buc buc)
Put yo middle fingers up, niggas say fuck that
(Fuck that, fuck that! Fuck that, fuck that!) [x2]

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
We should pop off, niggas ain't never around
We pop off, we don't care whoever's in town
Never trust us, never us if the cops ask questions
Neva trust a nigga, even pop my best friend
Your end's coming near, your niggas coming here
With that tough guy shit, the tough die quick
So wake the fuck up from the dead, you bitch niggers
Or get your hair done, roll with the vicious wig splitters
The kick-back from the pistol will break your wrist
I'll put you six feet in the ground and take a piss
I'm disrespectful, yeah, I'm known to fuck you
I know a couple niggas that will kill you for a buck or two
For five bucks they get loud as fuck
Five years on the allen, can't survive the cuts
So buc back, put yo midle fingers niggas up
And fuck that if you feel just like me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
When I buc back, y'all niggas running like bitches
Im like fuck that, always keep a gun in my bridges
It's none of your business, nigga, where the fuck Sticky been?
I show up at your place of business with fifty men
Betta let Sticky in, 'fore I get ticked off
Pockets get ripped off, jewelry slipped off
I screw face niggas when I walk by them
Those two faced niggas, don't even try it
Cause niggas know, I ain't taking it short
Fuck a witness, he won't even make it to court
Yeah, Fort Vaine, Vic Houses Ground-ville
From here on out, nigga, it's all downhill
My four pound fill heavy like a motherfucker
And you don't wanna test it
So when I go buc buc you better buc back
I hope you get the message!

[Hook][Intro: Sean Strange]
Yeah, yeah
New York to Czech Republic
Sean, Sean Strange
Yeah, yeah, what up!

[Verse 1: Sean Strange]
My life is like a movie in HD, you truly can hate me
But I do what I got to and break free, Sean!
I'm not the type to wait, I go and take this shit
Why you tryna break up all the brain that I'm creating with?
Who you debatin', bitch? I'm not a politician
Only a man with a dream, already got the vision
Now watch me put it into motion, open up your mind
If I don't like the verse, I kidnap on another rhyme
Too many of you treat the game like a hobby and shit
Buying a copy and it's true that you probably should quit
'Cos you ain't go for the real, forget that wound, it will heal
Don't wanna turn, you just do what you feel, so who are you now?
On the day of judgement, ain't no way I'm frontin'
I never go to a battle and walk away with nothin'
No payin' homage, I promise you I'm a future legend
I thought I told you do the music, I'ma do the rappin'!

[Hook (Samples from Nine's songs)]
I'm the man untestable, with the extraterrestrial flow
He's so nice, I've heard him before
He's so nice, I've heard him before
I'm the man untestable, with the extraterrestrial flow
He's so nice, I've heard him before
Bring the best rap goons, bet I murder a flow (What up)

[Verse 2: Řezník]
Brečíte jak ženský, kurva vyndejte si vložku
Sešiju vás dohromady, udělám lidskou stonožku
Votírám podrážku o tvůj rapovej sen
Mám z hip-hopu rohožku a už jsem prošláp hodně hoven
Jsem dítětem, který porodila Rosemary
Vyvrženec z pekla, jsem fantom opery
Ztělesňuju horory, útočim na tvý sny
Jsem jako Freddy Krueger, co tě ve spaní sní
Chceš bejt krutej jako my, na tom není žádnej fígl
Řezník, Sean Strange, zkurvenej DJ Illegal
Můj rap, co tě bolí jak zánět na řitní díře
Řveš jako zvíře bez umrtvení na chíře
Je to zářez pro českej rap, ZNK svět
Dej hlavu na pařez ať ti useknem head a můžem jet dál
Zatímco jsi stál a péra sál, ze mě se stal král
To bys, ty buzno, nečekal!

[Hook]
I'm the man untestable, with the extraterrestrial flow
He's so nice, I've heard him before
Bring the best rap goons, bet I murder a flow

Don't worry
My heart, it don't ever quit
I ain't ready to check out

[Verse 1: Sean Strange]
Pay attention I'mma walk the line
And make the kind of music that will get you through an awful time
Pour the wine
I kill your mind with every rhyme
Yo, you ain't gotta be weak
Living in poverty we, ain't thinking logically, B
Your own man, get with the program
I'm grinding for me
And give the people an outlet
Cause ? ?in the game ain't even about shit

I paid dues Sean Michael, NGP
Should have been number one, they cheated me on MTV
Another MTB, for me to fill with my train of thought
Got caught in ?
But had to break it off
Kid I'm from New York, a product of the Golden Era
My album, true talk, the anthem for the golden weather

We fall apart

[Hook: Sean Strange] (x2)
I can hear your heart beat
Through all the pain in the track
And everything you took from me you know I'm taking it back
And﻿ in fact
I'm never giving up without a fight
When shit get trife you gotta live your life

[Verse 2: Sean Strange]
Never giving up I have to die a legend

How much

I never had no money and grew up without a father too

Forbidden pleasure
Bit the apple and I fucked the virgin

I wipe the dirt off my shoulder and keep moving on

While the whole room eyeing me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Music touch your heart like the cardio surgeon
Music touch your heart like the cardio surgeon
Life of a creep hear the audio version
Life of a creep hear the audio version
Music touch your heart like the cardio surgeon

[Outro 2: The Sopranos]

- Clear!
- Please don't leave us, we love you[Once, I built a tower to the sun.]
It's official. Snowgoons. King Syze
[Once I built a tower.] Eh yo TP
[Now it's down.] Cue the medic
What, uh

[Verse 1]
Eh yo you not spittin', and you also ain't cop killin'
I'm top billin', you kicking this shit I'm not feelin'
I work hard everyday. That's why I'm fightin' these drums
While y'all no-name niggas keep fightin' for crumbs
In Philly, know nothing but the Uzi spray
My only concern, really man, is who got paid
He's a underground rapper why he rapping 'bout cash?
On a real, you can't live off of incense and ash
Plus I - does for the flash, right. Uh
I gots to have it. Whip so fly
Shit looks like it's magic
Work hard. Play hard
If y'all safe up in the graveyard, my niggas be spittin' AWOL
And we never hate, really we don't notice you
So step to the back man, and do what you're supposed to do
Take a step to the side when that red carpet roll out
AotP in the buildin', killin', just roll out

[Hook] x2
Now it's the last call. Right here it's time to do this
Not just getting money, make a living through music
From - State to state, man, I show 'em how I do things
And anything I talk on the track, man, I prove it

[Verse 2]
Eh yo y'all need to give it up, man, this rap is too in it
Fuck bringing it back, man, I'm trying to start a new trend
Niggas is big-timers. Big-timers rollin'. Gas guzzling, whip with crip
That's how I'm rollin'
Get off my dick, haters. Yeah, man, I'll see y'all later
A dictator addicted to getting paper. The capital K.I
Fuck spendin' my days high. Man, a nigga stay fly
When they - Come to that rap, I'm on cruise control
Y'all dudes is old, the nigga done abused y'all robes
Fuck - Giving it up, trying to be livin' it up
Ain't trying to spend my life randomly pissin' in cups
I'm - Lightin' it up as soon as I get the freedom of being my own being
And really, that's what my visions be. I won't ever reach the top
My whole life is failed. Thirty years in the union, man, that's life in jail

[Hook] x2[Intro: Absztrakkt]
Das ist eh die Grundlage von allem
Sonst geht gar nich'

[Part I: Absztrakkt]

Du tust was ich sage
Nicht weil ich der Boss sein will
Aber weil ich mir anmaß zu wissen
Die Sache hier einfach weiter zu überblicken
Du wirst dich verstricken in die Sehnsucht und Tränendruck
Aber ich will nicht das du dir weh tust
Bleib weg
Das ist meine Empfehlung
Oder genieß' einfach nur die sonnigen Tage hier im bodhigen Garden
Aber ich bin so Anti, auf mich gibt's keine Garantie
No Woman no Cry
Keine Weiber, kein Geschrei
Also what the fuck
Schon wieder wurde ein Gott erdacht
Der Bodhiguard
Ich erschoss zwar den Teufel, aber er hat vorher Gift in dein Geburtswasser geträufelt
Die Präsenzkraft ist am Leuchten und bastelt an der Ausdehnung des Kraftfelds
Das einzige was zählt, ich hab dich Deep Lieb
Aber betrittst du mein Schlachtfeld, wirst du getroffen von Schrapnell'n
Ich bin wie ein E.T., und es gibt noch so viele da draußen in der Maschinerie, die mich brauchen

[Hook: Absztrakkt]
Und du bist jetzt ein braves Mädchen und du stellst keine Fragen
Den ich bin dein Meister und du tust was ich sage
Auch wenn du jetzt noch nicht weißt warum, du kannst blind vertrauen
Nicht in mich, aber in den Raum
Und du bist jetzt ein braves Mädchen und du stellst keine Fragen
Den ich bin dein Meister und du tust was ich sage
Du wirst meine Hure sein, und du wirst für mich töten
Alles andere interessiert mich nicht, sei mir nicht böse

[Part II: Absztrakkt]
Auch deine Freunde finden mich blöde
Sie meinen, ich hab zwar die Sache mit Absztrakkt, aber sonst nichts aus meinem Leben gemacht
Ich bin keine Pfeife, die springt, wenn Pfeifen pfeifen
Da können sie im Dreieck springen und sich verpfeifen
Mein Erfolg ist für sie nicht sichtbar
Weit außerhalb ihrer Realitäten
Alles wonach sie streben:
Karriere, Autohaus, Blitzlicht ist für mich völlig unwichtig
Ich will nur glücklich sein
Und Baby ich stütz mich nur auf dauerhafte Werte
Wenn sie nicht selber meditieren werden sie das auch niemals bemerken
Was nicht härtet, tötet ab
Ich trage zwar den schwarzen Mantel, aber auch sehr viel Zorn in mir
Wie soll ich's anstellen?
Ich kann nur handeln innerhalb der Grenzen meiner karmischen Tendenzen, die sich mit den der anderen ergänzen
Wenns 'nen Menschen wie mich gibt es zwar nicht mit dem zusammen
Jemand wie mir folgt man, verstanden?

[Outro]
Ba ba da day ba da da day
Das ist einsam
You are fucked up, man!
Ba ba da day ba da da day
I'm looking for someone like me...
Ba ba da day ba da da day
You are fucked up, man!
Ba ba da day ba da da day
I'm looking for someone like me...

[Outro][Verse 1]
He was a real nigga, stayed on the block pitching
He and his crew would rock jeans that said stop snitching
He wasn't the violent type but he would see evil on all kind of nights
And chose to remain the silent type
I'm not saying call the cops, the beast won't help
But shit in the hood we police ourselves
Hate on no man trying to increase his wealth
But don't turn your back on your neighbour when they need your help
And he did that night that they robbed that old lady
They ain't mean to kill her but the bitch went crazy
Seen the whole thing and just shut his blinds
But he couldn't get the image of her busted spine from his blunted mind
Time passed and the summer was sick
That was until his little brother got hit
Now he's out for answers but niggas stick to the script
So when he asked what happened ain't nobody seen shit

[Hook] [x2]
And there's only so long you can play devil's advocate
Before the snake comes back and now your back is bit
Half the worrying, half the risk
But a whole world of problems come from playing devil's advocate

[Verse 2]
He was the youngest VP of a Fortune 500
Porsche out front, Armani suits by the hundreds
His bosses screwed over anyone that they wanted
The type to fuck the wife and then fire the husband
The ruthless titans of industry
There's lawyers and accountants are more organized than the Genovese
Made plenty enemies but his logic was
If these people were smart then they'd be as rich as me
His ambition blinded him so
He was a good man once but loot divided his soul
Now his company is floundering, about to be jobless
He's under investigation for trading on stock tips
Reporters out back sifting through garbage
Got a lien on his house, they trying to take where his mom live
Went to his old boss who's met at the door
He said, "I'm sorry son, we've never met before."

[Hook] [x2]

[Verse 3]
Never turn a blind eye to the evil that's upon you
Cause if you do believe me that shit will haunt you
I remember a few years back I witnessed a heinous act
And I did not react, I sat back and just let it happen
I just sat there stunned, I should've helped but I guess I was young
I guess I was dumb, felt like a punk
The stench of guilt hung on my skin for weeks like a skunk
And to this day I see the face of a stranger
Who was drowning and I could've been her anchor
If I had to do it all again I would've stood tall and lent her my hand
I would've fought like a man, I would've come to her rescue and done all I can
But the fucked up thing is I'll never get that chance
Never never never

[Hook] [x2][Chorus: Fredro Starr]
The old neighborhood screamin out dirty cops
Cause they up to no good fuck the dirty cops
Wanna slam me on the hood, dirty cops
Tried to rob me of my rights but I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know
The old neighborhood screamin out dirty cops
Cause they up to no good fuck the dirty cops
Wanna slam me on the hood, dirty cops
Tried to rob me of my rights but I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
I'm on the block with a couple racks on me
Dirty cop tried to put a couple packs on me
Use his knife stick to fuckin beat the black off me
Then I ran, bumped him made him spill his black coffee
Better back the fuck off me, I know my rights
Sais the kid had a gun and ya know that's hype
Tried to throw me on the ground on a cold ass night
But fuck a dirty, cop you know that's right
They only make like twenty three a hour
At the chinese spot, always eatin sweet and sour
This where you find the cops, in hot pursuit
Late night tryin to find a prostitute

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
The old neighborhood screamin out dirty cops
Cause they up to no good fuck the dirty cops
Wanna slam me on the hood, dirty cops
Tried to rob me of my rights but I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Dirty cops is good if you pay 'em off
Cause they could kill a nigga they won't even lay him off
Tryin to plant drugs so they could send them way up north
Keep the money comin in it's like sprayin off
Cause you see, police won't bug a nigga
Won't fuck with me but put the drugs on another nigga
But miss a payment, then find yo' ass up the river
Keep my dirty cops paid off like whattup my nigga?!
If it's there word against yours, then dead it
Now you got a felony and a court case schedule
Get a good lawyer my nigga is what you better do
Should've paid the dirty cop now you in federal

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
The old neighborhood screamin out dirty cops
Cause they up to no good fuck the dirty cops
Wanna slam me on the hood, dirty cops
Tried to rob me of my rights but I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know

[Verse 3: Snak The Ripper]
Yo you dirty cops on the block watchin with binoculars
Wanna talk to us well piggy we ain't tryin to talk to ya
It's obvious you really got the low low on my shirt
Actin like you tough cause you know your a homo when it hurts
See you robbin drugs at work so you could sling 'em on the side
Pull me over with no warrant to investigate my ride
But I know my fuckin rights so I ain't lettin you inside
Every time you write a statement yo I'm bettin it you lied
You the, only motherfucker let you serve and protect
Walkin with your chest out like you deserve the respect
All the laws that you push you got the nerve to forget
Tried to arrest me for this verse cause every word is a threat
Bitch!

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
The old neighborhood screamin out dirty cops
Cause they up to no good fuck the dirty cops
Wanna slam me on the hood, dirty cops
Tried to rob me of my rights but I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know[Hook] x2
Do dreams really come true?
And if so what must you do for your dream's light to come through?
I'ma dream till I come to
A time when my dreams ain't dreams no more cause I've realized them

[Verse One]
In a field of dreams I feel my dreams like I slept on a braille bed
And live 'em cause well done is way better than well said
Like life is way better than well dead
I've marched so many miles I can't even spell tread
Countless dubs of blue and quality time in the stu'
Slaving overtime to make this dream come true
(It's got to)
I'm just manifesting the predestine
And blessing each who digest me like beef stew
In school they called me "Quiet Boy"
I mean I had a lot to say but I was trapped in my scars, stuck in a silent war
No time for whores, my goal was planetary
My own lone companion and soul adversary
And to my dismay to this day still a war's on
Formed a truce with my spirit now we grapple morons
And poor songs is spreading all over
They got it all wrong, I'll make their art over arz nova

[Hook] x2

[Verse Two]
Pour my soul into a soundscape
Paint the horizon with my mind state
Don't worry I'll shield you from the flurries
This a tale of insatiable yearning
My always there hunger, the pillage plunder and tear the industry asunder
The sound from the ground under
For heresy weapon V will technically slice you like a section C
But it seems execs will never see
Still I strive the rhyme restless
Despite my like five denied efforts
Train of thought drive reckless
Prime objective to crash on the market
Then blast off my star ship's divine essence
Designed infectious
Serpents plot to see me fail
But it's a lock the V will prevail
Global takeover with these CDs through retail
Use the equator as my three rail
And speed line to a direction above to
Lessen your love for these thespian thugs
Pretentious panders and amateurs
Nursery rhyme handlers, meet the sorcerer
Bet you'll get vanquished before I finish dank spliff
I'm warning ya, broadcasting from my third cornea
And grasping endlessly for rap supremacy
This is a starving man's plight
The saga of an author who white gloves by day and rocks mics by night
Hitch my wagon to my calling and writing deep meditation
While waiting impatient for dream realization

[Hook] x2
