I like the way she do it

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64

[50 Cent]
I suppose to blow, you suppose to know
Not to go against me or it R.I.P
I'm stupid rich, got retarded money
I'm special ed, I got special bread
It's easy now, please believe me now
I dismiss a ho, bitch leave me now
I fuck when I want, I do what I like
She want the same chick I want, the bitch is a dike
She a super freak, the freak of the week
I give her something a suck, she give her something to eat
It never enough, she like it rough
We keep it going and we switch positions, listen

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it

I like the way she do it

[Tony Yayo]
I need a dollar for every time that my heart beat
Now how much it that
I can breath on a track and make money, ahha ahha
Now how much is that
I'm getting money baby, my truck a Lamborghini
I'm in ali-dibi, where the girls are freaky
Haters wanna be me, hoes glad to see me
Ma I love it when you lie & say my eyes are dreamy
Curtain niggas fall in love with a bitch
Patron in my dick, I fuck the blood out a chick
I'm in the club frontin, I'm in the club stuntin'
10 Grand to buy the bar, Ma it ain't nothing

[Lloyd Banks]
If home girl wit it, I'm get it, hit it, split it
She'll think about me everyday, hour, minute
Second to nobody, baby check it
You look as good as your check
And when your neck it, I'm ready to fuck
A little head in the truck
If her tougue game good, I'mma let her come up
When the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town
Stash box down, put the magnum down
I'm with G-Unit, See you next
Nigga you not ballin a the G 2 jet
How ever do you want it, how ever you do need me
OPE on a fuckin' CD, it's ME

[Bridge]

[Young Buck]
She got a nigga on the count down
Waitin on it like... three, two, one - yeah right now
You got skills on them high heels
When we leave this club, I'm take you were I live
Do me before I get her
I might eat out tonight, depending on how I feel
Baby girl got a thang for me
She do what every I say and I ain't got to make it rain money
Go getta and she ghetto with it
Told shawty dont do it, but she already did it
I'm all on her back, when she move like that
You can find me where every she at, Like that

[Hook][Intro]
Would you agree when I say
That a man's freedom only exists when he's free of pursuing his desires
Which means when the law conflicts with our desires
Then we must operate outside of the law

[Verse 1]
Uhh, I keep it brief its the code of the streets
I'm here to feast with the global elite, mi amigo
Noble when I speak, a young mogul
More social with the local police is I supposed to
Charity checks sitting with xavies x
Wedding invites who's marrying next, I noticed
Envelopes is the end results for my folks this is mental notes please absorb
Traveled through the countries abroad
Got my first thirst once I flipped through the Forbes now its a ritual
Polling with public officials heads of state I'm a heavyweight
My life's a tribute no pension
Though pleased with honorable mention
I'm from the land where my great grands ran from lynching so niggas listen
You can't master if your mind ain't right
If your vernacular ain't Islamic-like of some structure
Substance illuminate luster
Learn the game cause you know who remains to suffer

[Hook]
Take the 12 Jewels of Islam, live prosperous
PRT 5 Percent of the Populous
Older than the Sun Moon Stars Even The Hieroglyphs
Apocalypse, government falsifying there documents
You know what time it is when the 12th comet hit
You know what time it is when the 12th comet hit
You know what time it is when the 12th comet hit
Promise this, follow me I show you where Elijah live

[Verse 2]
Qu'ran coast on testament taught
In Milan with the loafs on the lessons was lost
I deal with the essence of course
I got the smarts and the heart of a Mexican boss, we the indigenous
Trapped in a mental imprisonment
I know and understand when its time to get ignorant, I live it
Alive with a hustler's spirit
Certified I survive through these precious lyrics, I'm so vivid
From negro to CEO for my PO to see me blow, no lie
A favorite of the Fortune 5
On front line got that corporate eye, I'm suited
And since a shorty I was ranked and recruited
To say thanks take bank and do this

[Hook][Movie sample]
Turnt on the TV this morning. They had this shit on about
'bout living in a violent, a violent world. Started thinking man
Either they don't know, don't show, or don't care about what's
Going on in the hood...

[Verse 1]
The Ghost is deeper than most is
Leave out the house grab the toaster, stuck in the sofa
Pop in the clip, hop in the whip, tryna get the last drop 'fore it drip
Hoody 'tire, any hood he ride
Fall back get good and high
Where the phone at, next to the cognac
Bring your chrome at wherever you bone at, it's on, Black
But you should've known that
I hit a dutch, hit another one and rip a clutch
I get your block blickied up, bitch nigga what
It feel good to hear the real hood
I could then and I still could
Cause my 9-mil is real good
I'm coming for you then I'm gunning for you
I don't get blunted with you get hundreds with you
Bitch nigga I'mma kill you if I want it with you
You can join on the list and get your number issued

[Talking]
You know my main problem in life, is being too hungry
I stay focused nigga. I'm on top of my game

[Verse 2]
Catch me where the haze is sticky like gum is
The guns is louder than thunder
You can get rained on, depending which cloud that you under
Ain't nothing fouler than hunger, I wonder
About a lot of shit, you ever shot a clip or got a brick
Me I did a lot of shit
But no scholarship, give a crackhead the keys, let him polish it
Street life, don't abolish it
They breaking rules now, making ratting seem cool now
You should bat the fucking fool down
Learned the game from a old timer
Big money made the hoes finer
Why you think he sold china? I could dig it like a gold miner
I ain't lame and I can't forget the game with Alzheimer's
This is SP the Ghost
Puffing on a bone, when I zone it affects me the most

[Talking]
I'm passionate about what I do. The streets affects me
In a very major way. I'm close to the concrete. I believe
What I say

[Verse 3]
Pocket full of DPs, honey from DC
Cayenne with the TV, living is easy
Back in sixth grade, who would believe me
Switchblade crazy wear my clothes looking greasy
Now I'm the boss of the bosses
If you think you married to the streets I could make you divorce it
Always hear me speak on the Porsches
I think it's the horses, and how it zig-zag on the courses
Big bags of money, try grabbing a fortune
The wheel get real, gotta spin it with caution
I ain't really into the flossing
I'mma stay dark, follow you home, get into your portion
The guns on fire like stovetops
I think you on the road to perdition
And, here's where the road stop
I ain't tryna fall, I just want it all
Why'on't you let me get the ball, I'mma show you the globetrot

[Talking]
Everybody need a turn. This time is mines. And if I fail
This time, I be up at bat again and again and again and again...
Sometimes you gotta accept where you coming from. But matter
Fact, fuck that. I'm kicking down the door. I'm on your ass
Niggas. Watch me. SP the Ghost[Talking]
Yo wasup?
Yo what what up oh shit aye whats good nigga?
Look at you nigga you still out here?
Oh I'm chillin man I'm holding the block down baby!
Word?
You know that, that's my style
No doubt
Let me hold something man would you let me hold something man?
You wanna hold something?
Yeah let me hold something
I ain't seen you in five years, you not throwing dirt all on my name and all that
Aww come on! don, come on! so you gonna blow up on me like that? aw man!
You don't think I hear nun?
Yeah whatever, whatever

[Chorus]
Everybody want, everybody need some'll speed hit a bump while the others succeed
Some'll just breathe 'till they pack up and leave
So watch what you do cause that could be you

[Verse:1]
Where's everybody when the shells and the shotties tryna sail through your body nobody wanna polly
Everybody cool when they cruisin in Denali's all crude up and jolly tryna screw all the hotties
Right they beside when them labels wanna sign me
Soon as the tsunami everybody got grimy
Couldn't understand even fan try and try me like, "Damn you a man this a stand up comedy?"
Wheres the honory the real you'll promise me it's still dishonesty I feel no harmony
Can't cope when the cold is near when niggas broke if they soul ain't there
Or reverse when your man from the dirt get his hands on some work
Everything seem good start expanding his turf with the dreams from the hood figure family is first 'till you call like you should and the number's no good
Nobody's perfect once you scratch through the surface see life's like a circus and we all serve a purpose
What your worth is? are you worthless ?
A work-a-holic for yours or on your first bid
No joke we was all better broke had to ante up for smoke thats when everybody spoke
Kept it all hood everybody had hope and them boats came afloat everybody had coke

[Talking]
Ayo you remember when the, when the spots was coppin' man we's had cheese lines gettin 30 40 a day?
Nah nah nah, I remember when Demi was out there in Dacata you kna' I mean? way before Larry was poppin' gettin bout 40 or 50 day haha

[Chorus]
Everybody want, everybody need some'll speed hit a bump while the others succeed
Some'll just breathe 'till they pack up and leave
So watch what you do cause that could be you

[Verse:2]
Now everybody rap how confusing is that
Confusing all these dudes like it's cool to get clapped
Be a fool if you choose but how foolish is that
When the move is to move like you smooth as a mac
I refuse to get trapped with them boys on my back
Cause that shit gets you hit at the ball with them macs
Now think about and ask how annoying is that
Now multiply that by 15 flat
I rather lean back with 16 stacks and something european with the flip screen flats
We all human beings but we get things fast
So watch what you do cause that could be you
Some ain't got a clue others know not to do
A few souvenirs in some water aqua blue
So which one is you? what this shit coming to?
Just don't be the next one the crew come and view.. atleast no time soon

[Chorus]
Everybody want, everybody need some'll speed hit a bump while the others succeed
Some'll just breathe 'till they pack up and leave
So watch what you do cause that could be you
Cause that could be you
Cause that could be you

[Talking]
Yeah for all those that ever did it, got away with it, this for ya'll. Hahaa
It's life baby. It's two sides to everything.  Up or down, left or right, right or wrong. Don't get it wrong get it right. Hahaha[Intro]
It’s so much
In so little time that needs to be accomplished
For the fact wit’ me on this track is so live
How could this be denied?
It’s hater-proof
Like Snoop once said
“This here’s protected by ballers wit’ big dicks and 187 skills”
(I put my life)
That’s if it's a must you test us
(Put my life on the line. Hustlin' the streets tryna keep you a dollar)
Hustlers
(So put my life)
What it do?
(Put my life on the line. Let’s come and love each other, give me some shine)
My life’s always on the line. Dig?
(I put my life, put my life on the line)
I’m a soldier, survivor. Period
(I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme)
No question mark is needed
(I put my life, put my life on the line)
You already know what it is
(Put my Life)
Allow me…

[Verse 1: AZ]
From them brick tenements to them cinema flicks
So many quick nightcaps it’s hard to remember some chicks
Flashbacks of certain cats in a similar mix
Sit home doodle semis—such sinister shit
Converse wit’ my Old Earth.  In any event—
Them hot shells ever hit me, just tell my sons gently
Simply, I’m a rider.  I provide for the fam
A Da Vinici wit’ the smarts. Hard as ‘Semite Sam
Empty I am, but my subconscious so in-tune
Love the nonsense. They harmless
They know I’m immune.  I’m a goon
Geared up, properly groomed—
Appear square so the unaware can only assume
From the womb to the tomb, it’s a bottomless doom
You pop shit outta pocket, I’m a pop ya balloon
Prop maroon low Maurys with it cocked on glory
See, some may know the half but here’s the whole story, Shorty

[Hook]
Put my life, put my life on the line
Hustlin’ the streets, tryna keep you a dollar
So put my life, put my life on the line
Let’s come and love each other, give me some shine
I put my life, put my life on the line
I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme
I put my life, put my life on the line
Put my life

[Verse 2: AZ]
Blood set, crip set, G-Unit, Dipset
Nas got rich and reached back
I ain’t riff yet
With checks crack sells. Elmira black tales
So many wires and you wonder why it’s packed jails
Pink border pastel, mink sporter, snatched mail
Rap well since Sugar Hill, homie. Ask L
It’s a life that I learned to enjoy
Higher fire employed. My attire’s McCoy
Not a toy.  Not a tear when they bury the boy
Not a care. No fear; nothing’s here to destroy
So don’t annoy.  I do this for them Chips Ahoy
I probably die for the cause, blood risin’ through the gauze
It’s a underworld hiding in the floor
Hand on the Bible; still lying to the law
I’m still rhyming.  I’m surviving on tour with the war wounds on me
Y’all dude’s so corny.  Cowards

[Hook]

[Verse 3: AZ]
Back from hibernation, high classification
Certified, I survived from the last generation
Verbalized about pies and past situations
The fly guys, and they demise, how they lives was taken
How they cries was deprived, and they sided wit' Satan
He was sittin’ wit' twenty-five,  and got fried from the basin
Manipulation.  Mood swings the minds of men—
Have them do things to get out, then they right back in
Once again, heard it said hip hop was dead
Before Bust shaved his head, cut off his dreads;
Before Kim went on a limb, got sent to the feds
It seems deep but she chose street-cred instead
Just like me, a true G is hard to find without a fee
I still put my life on the line
It’s modesty when you reap from a life of crime
And honestly, it’s no receipt for that price to shine

[Hook][Intro]
America, the bondage is off, knowledge is freedom
We all niggas never ignorant getting goals accomplished
Let's have a drink, it's on me

[Verse 1: AZ]
Yes, I'm doin' it a few soo-wooing it
My man Lou crew bandanna blue-ing it
They buck at cars won't give a fuck who in it
Bust at broads the gods say they ruin shit
20 to a clip hollow heads loaded them legislators ain't doing shit college heads know it
Raps and its influences turning kids out
Was trapped but still intuitive learn to switch routes in drought
My reality's placed on principalities so
Any casualties gracefully done carefully
The real attracted me re-exchange and bill
Mathematically calculating maintain and chill but still
Mind of Muhammad signs of the Masonic both combine I'm a verbal rhyme Galenic
Promise, pay homage only here for a spell and like that
I'm back where the highest form dwell its right back
Just like them 9 milli shells that systematically let off and murdered Sean Bell in hell
Smell the corpse of the homies we lost from a era so pure you could never be sure
The game's so sick I'm just looking for the cure
Like that Dead Prez flick when they was lookin' for the score
This whole shit here is forceman's sure ya'll talk about war well a nigga from the core
Sci-fi tricks I'm the spook by the door
Men in all black took the coupe out on tour
Hi-top kicks, kept the sweatsuits velour
Fitted all colors we considered all brothers
First we all chilling now we killing one another
See these hustlers on the covers of these FEDS and DIVAS
The game's dead trying to make these young heads believe us either
Understand or be under the land..my man

[Verse 2: Papoose]
Peace to the world, peace to the world, Papoose Pa-poose
Knowledge is freedom hop in the BM and drive to New Zealand
Rhymin' with reason I could defeat him, I could delete him
I could just eat him, not to deceive him, not to mislead him
Drop it to feed him lock in and teach him proper believin'
Cockin' and squeeze him pop him and leave him
His pockets is bleedin'
So know I got your per diem, I hug the block 'till the P.M
I was wise and strategic on the rise with the thesis since I was rockin the leases
Since I was coppin' Adidas
Since small sizes of sneakers like Barack with the speeches
You bloodclots is anemic
My mugshot in the precinct, your gunshot is the weakest
My young mind is the deepest
You cockblockers and leeches, I'll blow your Pradas to pieces
Hold a thousand my queen and fill her vagina with semen
It's so exotic and pleasing I gotta stop when I'm skeetin'
When I was my momma fetus, her stomach sat by the speakers
The music got in my features, that's just why I'm prestigious
Hold my bottle and drink it ain't suck it out of her cleavage
Cause I was ingenious since doc was circumcising my penis
I'm a scholar succeedin' and all of my dollars increasin'
Got a lot of achievements cause I divide with the weak ones
Sick and tired of these heathens
I see a lot of 'em schemin' they hearts throbbin' and tweakin'
But I could stop 'em from beatin'
Drop the hottest releases I don't bother with demons
I leave 'em whinin' and screamin' just like a toddler who teethin'
I pledge-alizes allegiance from the bottom I'm creepin'
All ya'll could line up and meet him, the God inside of his Kingdom
You claimin' you done bidded what that did prove
When you couldn't walk one visit in that man's shoes
Competition becomes timid cause Pap can't lose
I got the young, gifted, and black man blues
The 49th law of power your time is hourless
Cross Papoose and you cowards is powerless[Intro]
For money, I assassinate
Today, I have an opponent that's worthy
Now, killing me, you won't find that so easy

[Hook x2: Jimi Kendrix]
Clap your hands
Let's start the show, c'mon
1, 2, 3, 4, oh

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Revolutionary gangster, the will to kill
Everything up, my roots is steel
Do it big time, march through the desert and shine
Let the C's live free while we open the minds
Of every black man, white man, no color, my writing hand
Is like dynamite, I fight for land
Blood stains yo, gettin money affect the plan
You travel to Beijing and end up in Japan
Hoods everywhere, bring the goods and gear
And teach them how to hold mics and grow them beards
Then stop, check my brothers and my sisters in Africa
We know that's theirs, yes, we been actin up
Bush fucked the world up, and left our soldiers
Out in Iraq, bless them with roses
Foes try to approach, we roast them goats
We terrorize the city while forgettin the quotes

[Hook x2: Jimi Kendrix]

[Verse 2: RZA]
They trying to take us down through (Reaganomics) and atomic bombs
On Islamic countries to stop them from being Islamic
But Islam is a way of life, Islam is the way of Christ
Islam means peace, the beast must pay a price
For his wickedness, politics is the trickiest
Business on this planet, the bandits are the slipperiest
Snakes who ever slithered, you ever stop to consider
Who's pulling these strings, from Napoleon to Hitler?
Is there an unseen hand with the unseen plan?
The unclean man from the unclean land
Desire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest
Give his life in this world that seem so lifeless
Put a price on things, that are priceless
Convince us that meanness is stronger than the niceness
Who really has the power - is is theirs, is it ours?
Is it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?
Do we have a press or President?
Is it a test or a testament? Pest or pestilence?
Who got the evidence?
Who got the common sense? Stop all the negligence

[Hook: Jimi Kendrix]

[Raekwon the Chef]
I oversee the world
You taught me that, basically
I'm moldin rap to be more than I can see
Chef, Senator of Thoughts
Democratic cats
Saved by the judge
The flavor, that was brought about that day
Steaks come out, raw

[Hook x2: Jimi Kendrix]

[Outro]
"WU, TANG!" [16X to fade][Intro]

That a man's freedom only exists when he's free of pursuing his desires
Which means when the law conflicts with our desires
Then we must operate outside of the law

I'm a scholar succeedin' and all of my dollars increasin'
Got a lot of achievements cause I divide with the weak ones
Sick and tired of these heathens
I see a lot of 'em schemin' they hearts throbbin' and tweakin'
But I could stop 'em from beatin'
Drop the hottest releases I don't bother with demons
I leave 'em whinin' and screamin' just like a toddler who teethin'
I pledge-alizes allegiance from the bottom I'm creepin'
All ya'll could line up and meet him, the God inside of his Kingdom
You claimin' you done bidded what that did prove
When you couldn't walk one visit in that man's shoes
Competition becomes timid cause Pap can't lose
I got the young, gifted, and black man blues
The 49th law of power your time is hourless
Cross Papoose and you cowards is powerless[Intro]
For money, I assassinate
Today, I have an opponent that's worthy
Now, killing me, you won't find that so easy

[Hook x2: Jimi Kendrix]
Clap your hands
Let's start the show, c'mon
1, 2, 3, 4, oh

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Revolutionary gangster, the will to kill
Everything up, my roots is steel
Do it big time, march through the desert and shine
Let the C's live free while we open the minds
Of every black man, white man, no color, my writing hand
Is like dynamite, I fight for land
Blood stains yo, gettin money affect the plan
You travel to Beijing and end up in Japan
Hoods everywhere, bring the goods and gear
And teach them how to hold mics and grow them beards
Then stop, check my brothers and my sisters in Africa
We know that's theirs, yes, we been actin up
Bush fucked the world up, and left our soldiers
Out in Iraq, bless them with roses
Foes try to approach, we roast them goats
We terrorize the city while forgettin the quotes

[Hook x2: Jimi Kendrix]

[Verse 2: RZA]
They trying to take us down through (Reaganomics) and atomic bombs
On Islamic countries to stop them from being Islamic
But Islam is a way of life, Islam is the way of Christ
Islam means peace, the beast must pay a price
For his wickedness, politics is the trickiest
Business on this planet, the bandits are the slipperiest
Snakes who ever slithered, you ever stop to consider
Who's pulling these strings, from Napoleon to Hitler?
Is there an unseen hand with the unseen plan?
The unclean man from the unclean land
Desire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest
Give his life in this world that seem so lifeless
Put a price on things, that are priceless
Convince us that meanness is stronger than the niceness
Who really has the power - is is theirs, is it ours?
Is it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?
Do we have a press or President?
Is it a test or a testament? Pest or pestilence?
Who got the evidence?
Who got the common sense? Stop all the negligence

[Hook: Jimi Kendrix]

[Raekwon the Chef]
I oversee the world
You taught me that, basically
I'm moldin rap to be more than I can see
Chef, Senator of Thoughts
Democratic cats
Saved by the judge
The flavor, that was brought about that day
Steaks come out, raw

[Hook x2: Jimi Kendrix]

[Outro]
"WU, TANG!" [16X to fade]Good morning ladies and gentleman
And welcome to today's seminar entitled Conspiracy Theory
Where the focus will be conspiracy itself
And today's special guest speaker is legendary lyricist AZ
Ever since society's inception there has been a hierarchy where in which you have
The inclusive and the exclusive
And today he will be expounding on the two entities
Of the included and those of us who are excluded

Sky high gas prices another housing unit being built right in Rikers they opportunists
Society don't like us we like mutants
What happened to the dark cyphers the loves lost
Neighborhood street wars
Scientist manipulating G-4's we not alone
Hurricanes cyclones bomb threats suicide on the Whitestone I palm tecs
Straight from the heart of the hood but overstood
Played my part til I'm parted it should but meant good
Move by the moss(?) and the morns metamorphosis
Offered me optional doors I wanted in
With the wild life wanted to blend but then again
With them satellites they sucking us in we being tracked
So many got chips in they back they blindfold
Me I'm trying to run that victory lap and find codes
Cursed with that ESP I seen they hold papa for a PS3 so is it me
Or majority wanna be slaves
They don't wanna behave but they wanna be saved praise the Lord
Moving on they own accord too content to implement a sharp in they sword so all aboard
Bruised by the height of recession hunger scarce in fears by the vice and infections
I'm aware of the war going on this world we can't escape from
We can run but we can't hide forever
Its deep the system got the masters asleep
Religion mean to rely on they supply and deceit they putting chemicals in food we eat
Polluting the waters it cause slaughter to sheep we the meek
And money ain't worth what its printed on
I'm posted at the Sprint store trying to put minutes on
Its flying(?) on the same line I'm trying to do business on
I guess they applying what they learned from the Pentagon

Fuck out of here...[Talking]
Yo wasup?
Yo what what up oh shit aye whats good nigga?
Look at you nigga you still out here?
Oh I'm chillin man I'm holding the block down baby!
Word?
You know that, that's my style
No doubt
Let me hold something man would you let me hold something man?
You wanna hold something?
Yeah let me hold something
I ain't seen you in five years, you not throwing dirt all on my name and all that
Aww come on! don, come on! so you gonna blow up on me like that? aw man!
You don't think I hear nun?
Yeah whatever, whatever

[Chorus]
Everybody want, everybody need some'll speed hit a bump while the others succeed
Some'll just breathe 'till they pack up and leave
So watch what you do cause that could be you

[Verse:1]
Where's everybody when the shells and the shotties tryna sail through your body nobody wanna polly
Everybody cool when they cruisin in Denali's all crude up and jolly tryna screw all the hotties
Right they beside when them labels wanna sign me
Soon as the tsunami everybody got grimy
Couldn't understand even fan try and try me like, "Damn you a man this a stand up comedy?"
Wheres the honory the real you'll promise me it's still dishonesty I feel no harmony
Can't cope when the cold is near when niggas broke if they soul ain't there
Or reverse when your man from the dirt get his hands on some work
Everything seem good start expanding his turf with the dreams from the hood figure family is first 'till you call like you should and the number's no good
Nobody's perfect once you scratch through the surface see life's like a circus and we all serve a purpose
What your worth is? are you worthless ?
A work-a-holic for yours or on your first bid
No joke we was all better broke had to ante up for smoke thats when everybody spoke
Kept it all hood everybody had hope and them boats came afloat everybody had coke

[Talking]
Ayo you remember when the, when the spots was coppin' man we's had cheese lines gettin 30 40 a day?
Nah nah nah, I remember when Demi was out there in Dacata you kna' I mean? way before Larry was poppin' gettin bout 40 or 50 day haha

[Chorus]
Everybody want, everybody need some'll speed hit a bump while the others succeed
Some'll just breathe 'till they pack up and leave
So watch what you do cause that could be you

[Verse:2]
Now everybody rap how confusing is that
Confusing all these dudes like it's cool to get clapped
Be a fool if you choose but how foolish is that
When the move is to move like you smooth as a mac
I refuse to get trapped with them boys on my back
Cause that shit gets you hit at the ball with them macs
Now think about and ask how annoying is that
Now multiply that by 15 flat
I rather lean back with 16 stacks and something european with the flip screen flats
We all human beings but we get things fast
So watch what you do cause that could be you
Some ain't got a clue others know not to do
A few souvenirs in some water aqua blue
So which one is you? what this shit coming to?
Just don't be the next one the crew come and view.. atleast no time soon

[Chorus]
Everybody want, everybody need some'll speed hit a bump while the others succeed
Some'll just breathe 'till they pack up and leave
So watch what you do cause that could be you
Cause that could be you
Cause that could be you

[Talking]
Yeah for all those that ever did it, got away with it, this for ya'll. Hahaa
It's life baby. It's two sides to everything.  Up or down, left or right, right or wrong. Don't get it wrong get it right. Hahaha[Movie sample]
Turnt on the TV this morning. They had this shit on about
'bout living in a violent, a violent world. Started thinking man
Either they don't know, don't show, or don't care about what's
Going on in the hood...

[Verse 1]
The Ghost is deeper than most is
Leave out the house grab the toaster, stuck in the sofa
Pop in the clip, hop in the whip, tryna get the last drop 'fore it drip
Hoody 'tire, any hood he ride
Fall back get good and high
Where the phone at, next to the cognac
Bring your chrome at wherever you bone at, it's on, Black
But you should've known that
I hit a dutch, hit another one and rip a clutch
I get your block blickied up, bitch nigga what
It feel good to hear the real hood
I could then and I still could
Cause my 9-mil is real good
I'm coming for you then I'm gunning for you
I don't get blunted with you get hundreds with you
Bitch nigga I'mma kill you if I want it with you
You can join on the list and get your number issued

[Talking]
You know my main problem in life, is being too hungry
I stay focused nigga. I'm on top of my game

[Verse 2]
Catch me where the haze is sticky like gum is
The guns is louder than thunder
You can get rained on, depending which cloud that you under
Ain't nothing fouler than hunger, I wonder
About a lot of shit, you ever shot a clip or got a brick
Me I did a lot of shit
But no scholarship, give a crackhead the keys, let him polish it
Street life, don't abolish it
They breaking rules now, making ratting seem cool now
You should bat the fucking fool down
Learned the game from a old timer
Big money made the hoes finer
Why you think he sold china? I could dig it like a gold miner
I ain't lame and I can't forget the game with Alzheimer's
This is SP the Ghost
Puffing on a bone, when I zone it affects me the most

[Talking]
I'm passionate about what I do. The streets affects me
In a very major way. I'm close to the concrete. I believe
What I say

[Verse 3]
Pocket full of DPs, honey from DC
Cayenne with the TV, living is easy
Back in sixth grade, who would believe me
Switchblade crazy wear my clothes looking greasy
Now I'm the boss of the bosses
If you think you married to the streets I could make you divorce it
Always hear me speak on the Porsches
I think it's the horses, and how it zig-zag on the courses
Big bags of money, try grabbing a fortune
The wheel get real, gotta spin it with caution
I ain't really into the flossing
I'mma stay dark, follow you home, get into your portion
The guns on fire like stovetops
I think you on the road to perdition
And, here's where the road stop
I ain't tryna fall, I just want it all
Why'on't you let me get the ball, I'mma show you the globetrot

[Talking]
Everybody need a turn. This time is mines. And if I fail
This time, I be up at bat again and again and again and again...
Sometimes you gotta accept where you coming from. But matter
Fact, fuck that. I'm kicking down the door. I'm on your ass
Niggas. Watch me. SP the Ghost[Intro]
It’s so much
In so little time that needs to be accomplished
For the fact wit’ me on this track is so live
How could this be denied?
It’s hater-proof
Like Snoop once said
“This here’s protected by ballers wit’ big dicks and 187 skills”
(I put my life)
That’s if it's a must you test us
(Put my life on the line. Hustlin' the streets tryna keep you a dollar)
Hustlers
(So put my life)
What it do?
(Put my life on the line. Let’s come and love each other, give me some shine)
My life’s always on the line. Dig?
(I put my life, put my life on the line)
I’m a soldier, survivor. Period
(I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme)
No question mark is needed
(I put my life, put my life on the line)
You already know what it is
(Put my Life)
Allow me…

[Verse 1: AZ]
From them brick tenements to them cinema flicks
So many quick nightcaps it’s hard to remember some chicks
Flashbacks of certain cats in a similar mix
Sit home doodle semis—such sinister shit
Converse wit’ my Old Earth.  In any event—
Them hot shells ever hit me, just tell my sons gently
Simply, I’m a rider.  I provide for the fam
A Da Vinici wit’ the smarts. Hard as ‘Semite Sam
Empty I am, but my subconscious so in-tune
Love the nonsense. They harmless
They know I’m immune.  I’m a goon
Geared up, properly groomed—
Appear square so the unaware can only assume
From the womb to the tomb, it’s a bottomless doom
You pop shit outta pocket, I’m a pop ya balloon
Prop maroon low Maurys with it cocked on glory
See, some may know the half but here’s the whole story, Shorty

[Hook]
Put my life, put my life on the line
Hustlin’ the streets, tryna keep you a dollar
So put my life, put my life on the line
Let’s come and love each other, give me some shine
I put my life, put my life on the line
I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme
I put my life, put my life on the line
Put my life

[Verse 2: AZ]
Blood set, crip set, G-Unit, Dipset
Nas got rich and reached back
I ain’t riff yet
With checks crack sells. Elmira black tales
So many wires and you wonder why it’s packed jails
Pink border pastel, mink sporter, snatched mail
Rap well since Sugar Hill, homie. Ask L
It’s a life that I learned to enjoy
Higher fire employed. My attire’s McCoy
Not a toy.  Not a tear when they bury the boy
Not a care. No fear; nothing’s here to destroy
So don’t annoy.  I do this for them Chips Ahoy
I probably die for the cause, blood risin’ through the gauze
It’s a underworld hiding in the floor
Hand on the Bible; still lying to the law
I’m still rhyming.  I’m surviving on tour with the war wounds on me
Y’all dude’s so corny.  Cowards

[Hook]

[Verse 3: AZ]
Back from hibernation, high classification
Certified, I survived from the last generation
Verbalized about pies and past situations
The fly guys, and they demise, how they lives was taken
How they cries was deprived, and they sided wit' Satan
He was sittin’ wit' twenty-five,  and got fried from the basin
Manipulation.  Mood swings the minds of men—
Have them do things to get out, then they right back in
Once again, heard it said hip hop was dead
Before Bust shaved his head, cut off his dreads;
Before Kim went on a limb, got sent to the feds
It seems deep but she chose street-cred instead
Just like me, a true G is hard to find without a fee
I still put my life on the line
It’s modesty when you reap from a life of crime
And honestly, it’s no receipt for that price to shine

[Hook](Make the money talk)
(Make the money talk)
(Talk)
(Make the money talk)
(Make the money)

(I'm gettin money) (money) (money)

(Money talk, bullshit walk)

(I'm gettin money) (money) (money)

(Make the money talk)
(Make the money talk)
(Talk)
(Make the money talk)
(Make the money)

(I'm gettin money) (money) (money)

(La-la-la-la)

[ VERSE 1 ]
See, I'm about money, a whole lotta cheese
Niggas talkin greasy - it ain't about me
Cause bullets cost money, but I give 'em out for free
If I hear my name out the mouth of a MC
Nigga please, niggas must be smokin good trees
Always poppin shit, you know how the hood be
They envy when you walk, they rather see you down
When you go broke, them niggas ain't around
Clowns, see 'em in the street, air 'em out
I'm deaf, I ain't tryina hear nobody now
Gotta tell my money shut up, it talks too much
They say my records won't sell, I'm New York too much
I keep a hammer on the hip, Henny in the cup
Money over bitches, now that's what's up
But don't get me wrong, you know I keep a ho
But ain't nothin that a nigga love more than the dough
I'm 'bout money

[ variation of intro sample sequence ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
See, it don't mean a thing if it ain't about green
Like when you mention the Bridge you think about Queens
I go all out for the cake, you know I love the CREAM
You hear the word Infamous, you think of my team
Ron Gotti, Hav and P, G.O.D
Gambino, Ty Nitty and the N-o-y-d
Money-hungry go-getters, fly hood niggas
From the ice in the rings to the 40-inch gleam
Too much dough for money clips, partners in this rap shit
All we do is stack chips and load the Mac clips
You know the money talks, so listen ma and disappear
I'm goin Hollyhood, I'm tryina be a millionaire
Who cares if we break up, we ain't gotta make up
All I do is cake up from the time I wake up
No time to slip up, just make sure my money long
You know you hoes disappear when the money gone

[ variation of intro sample sequence ]
