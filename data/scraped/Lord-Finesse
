[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Hello, aw shit nigga, what the fuck time is it
Oh goddamn, nigga do you know what time it is
Aw shit, what the fuck is going on
You alright, nigga what the fuck is wrong with you

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell
It don't make sense, going to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleeping all day, no getting my dick licked
Hanging with the goodie-goodies lounging in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
(You talking some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lying to my mother, even stealing out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
(Get a hold of yourself nigga)
Sucking on her chest just to stop my fucking hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them
(Naw nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
(Nigga what the fuck)
And squeeze, until the bed's completely red
(It's too late for this shit man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fucking buddha head
The stress is building up, I can't
(Yo, I'm on my way over there man)
I can't believe suicide's on my fucking mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling me
Naw you wouldn't understand
(Nigga talk to me please, man)
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no coming back
(Yo, I'mma call you when I get in the car)
Should I die on the train track, like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral fronting like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
(Put your girl on the phone, nigga)
She knew me and her sister had something going on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
(Yo, you listening to me motherfucker)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
(Eyo c'mon nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talking
(BANG)

[Puff Daddy]
Ayo Big, ayo Big

[Outro]
*Heartbeat slowing*
Please hang up, and try your call againVerse: 1
Fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expanding my chips
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowing is sharp
A while back I used to hustle, selling blow in the park
Counting g stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie hunting, trigger temper I'm quick to body something
You looking at me like I'm probably fronting
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hanging around y'all cause niggas like you
Be praying on my downfall, hoping I flop
Hoping I stop, you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe smoking the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more stitches than you
Fucking punk, you ain't a leader what, nobody followed you
You was never shit, your mother should have swallowed you
You on some tag-along flunky yes man shit
Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel Fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come you can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from?
So what you acting for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something, before I crack his jaw
You running with boys, I'm running with men
I'm a be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like "damn it this nigga done done it again"
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas

Verse: 2
Aight, let me kick some more shit, one more time
(Yeah-yeah… Spit, some more) - Bobbito
Aight, check it out, yeah, check it out
Yeah, check it out, yeah, check it out
Uhh, check it out, aight, check it out
Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo check it, yo my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you but with that cheap shit, you ain’t worth stickin'
I’ve got a left hook that be leaving guys knocked out
Keep fronting and I'ma choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that
Yo, I’m not in the mood son, so don’t push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight — gripping my dick like a pair of pliers
You fucking snitch; right now you prolly wearing wires
It’s not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
I’ma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smokin'
My album is done, so no there ain't no parts open
I’m not a sweet stud, I’m a street thug
That’s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain’t a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with fuck them too, I’ll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fuckin' chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo, I’m a take you out your misery
And after this, nigga, put you in the social study book cause you’re history[Verse 1]
Aiyyo spark up the phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick money grip or your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight friend, aight then
L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah cause I got all of them sprung Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw them they come back
I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C
I'm down with Diggin In The Crates and I'm MVP

[Hook]
If rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
Yo if rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C

[Verse 2]
Yo it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance Jack to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like beaucoup, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And everytime I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses cause I'm buying Porsches
Coming straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri, I'm MVP

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Battles I lose none, I make crews run
I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper, punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your Mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my ___
I'm coming straight out the NYC
Rap's my J-O-B, and I'm MVP

[Hook]Intro:
It's the number one crew in the area

[Verse 1: Big L]
The Big L be lightin' niggas like incense
Gettin' men lynched, too intense, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A Tec-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit so protect your fucking neck nigga
Not a role model I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap I got skills out the ass nigga
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all ya new jacks kickin' wack raps
It's a fact that I'll be on your fuckin' back like a knapsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Because bitches still gel me without a motherfuckin' LP

[Hook]
It's the number one crew in the area
"Known for sendin' garbage MCs to the graveyard"

[Verse 3: Microphone Nut]
Yo I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep
I'm giving these ladies something they can feel cause I'm real
Ya man get outta line and it's kill kill kill

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Party Arty of Ghetto Dwellaz]
Yo you step up and you'll get played like the small fry
I'm throwin' niggas off the roof said you wanna be the Fall Guy
So mess around you'll be a dead man
I get hype tonight's the night like Redman
Nuff respect to Big L who get wreck
Chiggidy check yourself cause I ain't workin' with a full deck
I'm lethal, eatin' people
Not Jeffery Dahmer I'm the sequel, head or gut like Illegal
So what cha want?
Yo I'm strapped with the gats step up plap plap
I'm leavin' caps in your back fool
I rip tracks wanna say peace to hip hop
A nigga disagree bring it on and get dropped
I get wreck I'm Party Arty so hit the deck
The kid with the Tec smokin' niggas like cigarettes
Now some ask me how I'm gettin' jewels
I say big up big up it's a stick up stick up
I stick and move

[Big L:]
And that's how we do. So I.U. grab the gat and let loose

[Verse 6 Grand Daddy I.U.]
Yo rat tat tat I got the gat cocked
Nigga we ghost man a punk?
I let it roast and leave your pussy ass comatose
I'm shootin' up like the west is
Fuck suggestions
I'll blow out a niggas intestines
Better dip fast quick fast or you won't last
One blast will put your ass in a body cast
And I be killin' for rep get ill in a sec
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Constantly comittin' grand larceny
Arsony niggas don't want no parts of me
Never past up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels was truck he got his ass stuck
So what the fuck is you sayin' hops?
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Who's ever around when I be sprayin' drops
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas but I ain't tryin' to hear shit
I'll burn you faggot niggas like toast
If you die and come back I shoot your spirit
Now your ass is just a holy ghost
You tried to play me to the left
You better put a target on your head
Cause you're marked for death[Dr. Dre]
This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God

[Verse 1]
Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us; so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded - wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seeing him leave, or watching him go

[Rell + Mary J. Blige]
If you wanna know why.. (why I live my life)
The way that I do.. (cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me.. {cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper

[Verse 2]
You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit you

Brother...brother...[Intro]
Aight fuck that, word word
Lord Finnesse, Jayo its been my jail since a day old but they know
Yea this ones for the ladies
Who be tryna have my baby

[Verse 1]
Ayo word to my mother
Two things I never do is leave the crib without some rubbers
Or tell a funky ho I love her
These broads be trying to get a brother caught up in a sticky situation
Missing menstruation cycles
They all psycho ask Michael
Before you give her dough for billie jeans and them nice clothes
Like whoa don't let them trap you on the tight rope
Spike holes in the condom to form a zygote overnight
Ask Kwon he know what it's like
He wore a hat but it exploded twice
But fuck a bad bitch I do this rap shit and put it over life
On the coldest nights son shine like a solar strike
And I swear I got the weirdest cases
Pipe chicks in the weirdest places from rooftops to staircases
Like get a load of their faces
Face it if you fear hate it you get put into this clear space

[Hook x8]
I dont trust these bitches they would never catch me slippin'

[Verse 2]
Hey yo, I’m attached too, to the cash rules, 'bout to go nuts
Niggas get their attitudes to these cash you
Who you know that cool that they drip swagoo
And I’m here to stay like tattoos on statues
Check your mirror nigga that’s the second time I passed you
Eating my gas fume, got me thinking like who gassed you
Your girl got gas too
She let me tackle for a Dutch and a Snapple
And that's who you decide to put on shackles
I’m that dude, fuck values, pump up the volume
All up in the cut, no alcohol just mad booze
Tryin to find a pad to bring her back to
Like a tadpole, I'm that folk, got bad chicks that I feel bad for
Losing to they back bones, looking at my cock tip
Down to do all all no matter what the synopsis is
All it takes is some exotic piff
They all unconscious topless exposing they crotch and shit

[Hook x8]

[Outro]
Ey yo It’s PE leaving no hope for these hoes
We leaving no hopes for these hoes
My nigga Jay Steez leaving no hope for these hoes
Leaving no hope for these hoes
My nigga A-La $ole leaving no hope for these hoes
Leaving no hope for these hoes
My nigga Kirk Knight leaving no hole for these hoes
Leaving no hole for these hoes
My nigga CJ Fly leaving no hope for these hoes
Leaving no hope for these hoes
My nigga Pow P leaving no hope for these hoes
Leaving no hope for these hoes
My nigga Jay Lee leaving no hope for these hoes
Leaving no hope for these hoes
My nigga Dyem Lewis leaving no hope for these hoes
Leaving no hope for these hoes[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo once again it's the Big L, that kid who got much props
From killin corrupt cops, with motherfuckin buck shots
So don't step to this, cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big but they make coffins yo' size too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Cali, it's Harlem nigga we do walkbys
No one can match me, tax me or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps G just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me being a virgin, that's idiotic
Cause if Big L got the AIDS every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
And I put more holes in his ass than swiss cheese

[Hook]
(Thugs better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'mma have your family dressed in all black

[Verse 2: Big L]
I steal lives like a stone thief, so leave me alone chief
Or catch a buck shot to your domepiece
I must warn, I got it goin on, word is bond
Ducks be gettin thrown off platforms like P.M. Dawn
I'm catchin bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers, not just on niggas but hoes too
So don't try to test me, cause I can't stand test-es
Fuck around, I'll introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears, pal
But man you've been rappin for years now
And ain't made a hit yet, you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews, I come out of wars barely bruised
I'm puttin motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the git-go
Leavin fags in bodybags with tags on they big toe

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big L]
Yo ever since I was young, I ripped mics and I killed beats
And I'm known to milk freaks and hit em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name, I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS, then I'mma start rapin bitches
I'm all about makin papes kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past, stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty G's is what the creep stole; so the next day
Knocked on his door and shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Got it goin on, from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style I'm wild, comin straight out of Harlem pal
It's Big L, the motherfucking problem child

[Hook]

[Outro: Big L]
This goes out to all y'all bitch-ass niggas
So if your mother ain't ready for a funeral, don't FUCK with me
Cause I know a good way to get your family together
And I ain't talkin bout a reunion motherfucker
Yo, I'm bout to sign out, but before I go
I gotta say peace to the NFL crew, you know who you are
And all y'all niggas talkin that gun shit
And won't bust a rhyme, stop fakin the funk!
Word, I'm bout to get up out of here
Yo I'm out B, yo peace man
I gotta get this money
So all y'all niggas on my hitlist get your suits ready
Hahahaha![Intro: 'The River Wild' sample]
"Where are you?" "Hey, there you are!"
"How does it feel to know you only have a few more seconds left to live?"
*gunshot*

("Big L" - Cut and scratched)

[Big L]
I stay jeweled up, pockets swelled up from banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep in a triple black dark tinted old jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put a Glock to his dome
Tell him, "Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split"
Grip, it ain't nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
Mad niggas be fronting a lot
Popping mad shit, tryna be something they not
Your faggot ass better stick to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing, that's right
In '97 Harlem kids is blowing
And we don't trick, we'll let a bitch starve till her ribs are showing

("Lord Finesse" - Cut and scratched)

[Lord Finesse]
Heated divine mastermind that turn nickels to dimes
The authentic genuine that's out to shine
The cool cat, the true mack, the smooth raps
Chickens be like, "Who that?" I be doing my thing, kid (True dat)
Forget fronting, I'm beyond that, I roll with brothers ready for combat
All for eye-to-eye contact
With skills, G, yo it's ill see, for real B
Ain't no barbecue, niggas better stop tryna grill me
Huh, sent that style to the essence
Got niggas stressing my style, pull like fluorescents
No question, tough type to clutch mics
The positive upright, I'm the "I don't give a fuck" type
Expose the facts, you know the haps
Could go to laugh astrological, like the signs in the Zodiac
Your rap crew out the stack loop, word up
My style's tighter than a fat bitch in a cat suit
Suprise G, it's not wise see to size me
When I operate, it's Smooth Sailing like Ron Isely
Gotta do my thing, word up (Beg ya pardon?)
Time to bounce, gotta skate like Tonya Harding

("A.G." - Cut and scratched)

[A.G.]
Yo I'm the cleverest top ten terrorist
Chickens ever diss they become featherless
Hate derelicts, certified gold medallist
You play fly cause I'm the most high like Everest
Look at all these fakes, musically you imitate the Crates
Won't succeed moving at full speed with no brakes
Like Jake, watch me take your entourage
Can't see me, I'm camoflauge and besides, I'm God
Mad hard like the S.A.T. who have shorties
Caught up in the mental, watch her bless A.G
Evidently you still don't know because you tempt me
Thought you was the boss when your fat thoughts were empty
Not Fat Joey Crack but still Jealous One's Envy
Who sent me? D.I.T.C., good and plenty
Like the doctor, smoke a Spike Joint and watch "Clockers"
Get rude like Shabba, make moves behind my blockers
Crazy sickness, you want the pure, you'd better pick this
Bitches can't get this, faggots remain dickless

("Fat Joe" - Cut and scratched)

[Fat Joe]
Before we get started, let's talk about these coward-hearted
MC's that claim to be true O.G.'s
And war specialists forever bust your guns on the sack of shit
But when the beef come, get on the ___ before I protest your licks
You know the deal, I come with nothing but the real
Certified pejente, recognize mi gente
Whether East Coast or West Coast, I'll make 'em all strip naked Bitch niggas will never get respected
Joey Green bagging devils up in Bowling Green for all is clean
Cock the 9 soon as I seen his Rolie gleam
You know the team, never giving a fuck
Laying thick in the cut, get your shit laced up
What the fuck!

("Diamond D" - Cut and scratched)

[Diamond]
Yo I'm flipping on niggas like treys of crack
My raps react on your cardiac like a heart attack
Some niggas front for stunts
Who want to take a puff of the blunt and play a nigga like a chump
But I don't play that shit with no chicks
Sucking the next nigga's dick, moving bricks
I'm too slick for you high school dropouts
You got knocked and tried to cop out
Couldn't fight when the kids pulled the mop out
And wails you out, writing home saying, "Bail me out"
Little small time, fucked up when you called mine
D Squared, one of the Greatest of All Times

[Outro: Diamond D]
Yeah, D.I.T.C. representing for the '97, word life[Big L]
Ayyo, I got the gift of gab
To lift and grab, the mic
And recite hype rhymes
That'll rip and rag, and drag
A fag MC, who likes to nag a lot
And brag a lot, talkin' about the lyrics that he have are hot
Step to this and get lit like a candle troop
Rhymes I hook up, MCs I cook up
Like Campbell's Soup
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you'll get bust and dust and crushed
Bum rushed and all of that
Rhymes never sound whack
Cause I got 'em down pat
Your rulin' time is over
So gimme your crown jack
I get hype fast
And MCs might last
A minute with me
Because their rhymes are light as
A feather
And mines are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick
When I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
MCs that tried to get wit' me hops
That's why they all got tooken out like a Bensi box
The crown is still mine cause I kick ill rhymes
A lotta rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I'm smoother than Vaseline
And I'm a stone cold rappin' fiend
A lot of new jacks are comin' out, but that's cool
Cause I'm the principal of the new school

[Big L]
Yeah, aight, check it out
I control the microphone like a robot
My lyrics are so hot, props I got a whole lot
Cause wit' a pen and some paper this man makes
Rhymes that're so damn great, with flavor like pancakes
I'm kickin' rhymes like a game of kickball
I'm rough like a brick wall, MCs take a big fall
For tryin' to get with this, I'm too swift with this
A microphone murderer full with magnificence
A def rapper and also a swell one
In a battle I cook MCs well done
My hits are consecutive
I'm a lyrical executive
Bite my rhymes and I won't let you live
So to be safe on the microphone homes
Recite your own poems or get your dome flown
Or put in a boot camp, L is the new champ
I'm not the type to go out like a food stamp
I'm throwin' rhymes like a pitcher throws a curve ball
And I'm a serve all punks that try to brawl
So stop sleepin' on me, don't even doze hops
Or I'm a heat you up and eat you up like Stove Top
Stuffin', I'm bum rushin', shorts I'm takin' none
My rhymes weigh a ton, I'm not fakin' son
You're the one who's fakin', tryin' to be a duplicate
Can't kick stupid shit, tell you the truth, you should quit
Rappin', start snappin', cause all you is a joke
Battle L and get smoked
Yo I overthrow ya and have ya screamin' like a rollercoaster
Guzzle you down like a small cup o' Coca-Cola
I'm goin' through MCs like a ransack
Stand back, as I cruise smooth like a Am-Trak
Your rhymes are rusty g, you can't fuck with me
That's why you're hidin' in protective custody
L's not the one and I keep MCs runnin'
I hurt 'em like bunions, make 'em cry like onions
I'm a lyrical fighter and I'm brighter than Einstein
Try to bite my lines and you'll get a size nine
Foot put in your ass for bein' a crook
Hit with a vital hook and get your title took

Yeah, I'm a pass it to my man

[Lord Finesse]
Now check it out, I'm a get paid for the nineteen nineties
I don't care who likes me or who stands behind me
The man to peep, far from weak so don't sleep
From stage to streets I still go one deep
So save that off the wall bullshit, ya get had son
Fuck around, grab the mic and catch a bad one
I come correct and strapped to bust a ill rap
Me take a loss to who? Ya oughta kill that
Back up, slack up, give a brother some head room
Hype on the mic, amazin' in the bedroom
Girls like me cause I'm straight and don't sidestep
I do shit Jack LaLanne ain't tried yet
Ask any female, bet you she'll say I'm good
That's why I'm Finesse, porn star of the neighborhood
Yeah, cause I kick slicker raps
It's Lord Finesse, so bow and tip your hat
And make way cause I get plenty say
And those who don't like me I don't give a shit anyway
Cause when it comes to lyrics I always find somethin'
That make brothers press the rewind button
I'm a get mine, tell me what you're gonna do?
Cause ya couldn't see me if ya wanted to
Get who you want, shit you could call the cops
But for now, I'm gettin' all my props
I reign terror, whatever's clever
I'm cooler than The Mack and Shaft put together
So chill, don't try to get ill dummy
Me get stomped by who? Be for real, money
I'm not havin' it so go on and get your best group
You'll see why they call me Lord Finesse, troop
I eat 'em like sandwiches, send 'em home in bandages
Gimme that mic, I'll show you what doin' damage is
Nice, swift and deeper than quicksand
I'm takin' out opponents like a hit man
I get the crowd hype like a sorta drug
It's Lord Finesse, who the fuck you thought it was?
I lounge and chill but still could get ill
I'm live and real with skill beyond skill
Pull girls like a lasso, keep the crazy cash flow
A nigga beat me on the mic? Don't be an asshole
I'm indestructible so bring in a substitute
What's up with a battle? Yo I can't fuck with you

[Lord Finesse]
I'm intellectual, gettin' the best of you
I eat MCs like the food at a festival
Drop science and math; stand tall like a giraffe
Completin' the…task, breakin' rappers in half
Puttin' suckers out of it, yeah I talk a lot of shit
But when it comes to rhymes I deserve a fuckin' scholarship
Won't front or perp the role, I get the most of hoes
I'm so cool, I've got pussy on remote control
Whether you're a virgin or a bad lookin' hot sister
I'm baggin' up bitches like a shoplifter
So Lord Finesse is not the one to fool
I was gettin' sex since they first invented Underoos
So set it off, no time to rehearse the rappin'
It's Lord Finesse, so prepare for the worst to happen
Mics get ripped up, good times get tucked
Throw your hands in the air, suckers keep your lips shut
Cause ya'll wanna waste time sayin' them fake rhymes
Gimme my respect and props or I'm a take mine
Cause I ain't nothin' to play with
And fuckin' with me ya need more than a first aid kit
So it's better that ya chill and max with me
I'm sendin' out warnin's quicker than a fax machine
I get funky and kick it so let's get wit' it
Opponents who think they can hang, y'all can forget it
I sit and write rhymes, makin' up hype lines
Achievin' shit you couldn't do in a lifetime
So don't care me and compare me to those other brothers
I'm Lord Finesse and I'm one bad ass muthafucker
I'm doin' MCs as ya hire 'em
Bustin' they ass and make 'em sign up for retirement
Without doubt I'm a brother with all the clout
Whoever said I'm whack, what the fuck is they talkin' about?
Yeah, you don't stop, so L, my man my brother
Tear shit up you bad muthafucker

[Big L]
Yo I'm the microphone murderer
And I'm known for bustin' mad caps
I was in rag tracks with rhymes that backslap
'Causin' a nightmare, I don't fight fair
Niggas playin' hard rock, hopin' they might scare
The B-I-G-L but I'm not to be fucked wit'
You're tryin' to take your idol's title?
You on some bugged shit
I keep the women fiendin' and screamin' for my smooth shit
My rhymes are mad thick and yours is thin as a pool stick
Fuck it, bust it, I like it rough and rugged
Your style is wick whack and played out like nugget
Bracelets, face this, you can't erase this, escape this
Break this, take this, cause I bake this
I get so loose on beats that I produce
Niggas be frontin' crazy hard and got no juice
They softer than paper plates, the lyrics I make is great
A few sheets of loose leaf and a Erasermate
Is all I need to write rhymes that are extra fly
Mics I wreck and fry, rappers I petrify
Pack a fo' fif' with eight shots
With one you get popped
And now you're locked in a box, dead, with no props
I'm not jokin', there's no time for snappin'
Niggas that be yappin', I'm puttin' caps in
So base up or get sprayed up to the waist up
You'll get found faced up, police can't trace up
Fingerprints, why? Because I leave no evidence
Big L's the name, one three nine is the residence, peaceVerse: 1
Fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expanding my chips
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowing is sharp
A while back I used to hustle, selling blow in the park
Counting g stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie hunting, trigger temper I'm quick to body something
You looking at me like I'm probably fronting
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hanging around y'all cause niggas like you
Be praying on my downfall, hoping I flop
Hoping I stop, you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe smoking the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more stitches than you
Fucking punk, you ain't a leader what, nobody followed you
You was never shit, your mother should have swallowed you
You on some tag-along flunky yes man shit
Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel Fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come you can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from?
So what you acting for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something, before I crack his jaw
You running with boys, I'm running with men
I'm a be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like "damn it this nigga done done it again"
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas

Verse: 2
Aight, let me kick some more shit, one more time
(Yeah-yeah… Spit, some more) - Bobbito
Aight, check it out, yeah, check it out
Yeah, check it out, yeah, check it out
Uhh, check it out, aight, check it out
Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo check it, yo my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you but with that cheap shit, you ain’t worth stickin'
I’ve got a left hook that be leaving guys knocked out
Keep fronting and I'ma choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that
Yo, I’m not in the mood son, so don’t push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight — gripping my dick like a pair of pliers
You fucking snitch; right now you prolly wearing wires
It’s not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
I’ma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smokin'
My album is done, so no there ain't no parts open
I’m not a sweet stud, I’m a street thug
That’s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain’t a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with fuck them too, I’ll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fuckin' chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo, I’m a take you out your misery
And after this, nigga, put you in the social study book cause you’re history(Sadat X)
When you say the name X, think synonymous wit fame
Only draw love off the mention of my name
I got a rhyme or two left then I'm a blend to the side
Go out on top like Jim Brown at his peak, I get wreck like ery week
Get my freak on, who dares to speak on
My armed forces recon, penatrating like decon
Guerilla tactics, stage theatrics
She's laying on the mattress
I'm hiking up the black dress
Finesse called on me to bless
I pulled the S off my varsity sweater, fine tuned to the letter
So let's make these stacks and max, relax, be waxed
The tracks receive faxs wit my picture, in a cowboy hat
Now top that, yo, kid, top that
Kid got blown away at exactly where you're sitting
Just the other day but nobody's admitting
To the crime, I'm a MC not a MD
The best in history or maybe one of the top 3
Says myself, no diggedy

(Large Professor)
I be synonymous to king, fling niggas to the mat
Like an acrobat, flipping the mental ass whipping
Is served when I un-nerved another wack Jack imposter
Trying to fraud, you gots to get the fuk down wit the Lord
Finesse, whether you think you're pimp status or the best
Mad crazy or stupid, find a hot beat and loop it
For what it's worth, I've been a hip-hopper from birth
Try to disrespect and get your ass played up like a smurf
I'm running over the track, type of nigga to stack
One million, hit my moms, then fuk it, make a trillion
To start, showing the world who's the man wit the heart
That's about to blast off on these kids that's mad soft
Don't fuk wit Large Professor or you get your ass mauled
So ah, say no more, them niggas that supports
Large Profess, Lord Finesse and Dat X for the tour
Grand Puba, who's probably coming back from Aruba
Wit the skill to build, I'm saying peace, you niggas, chill

(Grand Puba)
Dig it, I be that nigga wit the creamy ass rhyme flow
My shit's so hot, I'll burn the ass of an Eskimo
I'm saying though, it be the Grand flipping flam
Giving love to my fans and you know this man
My composition leaves competition wishing
They could be in my postition cuz I did it wit no ass kissing
I'll be there like Michael Jackson and you don't stop
Until you get enuff and I'll be damn if my nose drop
I speak Actual facts on how I feel
Don't worry baby, wit Puba, there's no waiting just to exhale
I bag dimes like Jada, step through playa haters
Keep niggas moving like a fuking escalator
Because it's poetry in motion
Pube keep it smooth like lotion, keeping MC's lost like Billy Ocean
Dig what I'm saying I be a buck 85 on the weigh-in

(Lord Finesse)
It goes dip dip diving, check who you sizing
It's the wize civilizing, pockets stll rising
When I drop it, I'm futuristic like Fiber Optic
Didn't buy my album, you played yourself, should of copped it
Nuthin could beat my elite rhymes throwing your hands kid
That better be a peace sign
You don't want it, that's my steelo, how we on it
When we do our thing, niggas spread the word like informants
But still advancing, skills enhancing
We got up on a shooken offbeat like white people dancing
We're too bugged, true thugs
Quick to get in that ass in ways that homo's wouldn't approve of
I'm not yapping, just rapping
Don't care if you're gold or platinum, don't think it can't happen
Whether wit a beat or acapella, it's the mic Rockafella
Strictly out for the mozarella
Fuk guns and toolies, we don't betray movies
It's yours truely that's smoothly, still sounds groovy
You can't do me or dis me, don't try to get wit me
My style is tricky like spelling Mississippi
Strictly, come and get me, if you can flip me
If this flow was whisley, I have you muthafukas tipsy
The ghetto type playas that caters
Famous to you spectators, the rhyme sayers, catch you later[Intro: Lord Finesse talking]
Ahhh, this how it goes down
Keep onn, and you don't stop
Ah keep it onn, and you don't stop
Keep onn, and you don't stop
Break it down one time for ya mind
Live and motherfucking direct for '95
It's Showbiz and A.G
And yours truly, the funky one
The Grand Imperial Lord Finesse
As it goes like this like that ya'll, keep it on
It's like that ya'll, keep it on
It's like that, ahhh



[Lord Finesse]
It's Lord Finesse, the rhyme vet
Like Biggie, I'm "Ready to Die" but it ain't my fucking time yet
I bring the noise like static, I cause havoc
When I grab the mic I pack a party like traffic
You know my style, I got the hip sound
I should be a construction worker, the way I be tearing shit down
One of the best, you ought to shout it
I bust a nigga ass and won't give two thoughts about it
Word, I hunt you down
I got a million reasons why none of you can fuck around
I slay beginners, sautee contenders
Shit, and be damned if I don't walk away the winner
I kick facts, flip raps over hip tracks
You know what I'm saying? (Yeah, I can dig that)
I'm gifted, my rhyme is wicked
When it comes to knowledge, I got jewels like the Diamond District
I'm the dopest, the baddest, one of the fattest
The nicest, chicken-heads know my status
For those that's waiting to doubt
I'm a play like Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth and "Straighten it Out"

[Hook]
Ayo Show, my man (Add on, add on!)
A.G. my man (Add on, add on!)
Ayo Show my man (Add on, add on!)
D-Flow my man (Add on, add on!)

[D-Flow (Diamond D)]
Check it, I got the herb to bomb your brain
I'm a threat like Saddam Hussein, niggas better know my name
I flow the same in a competition
I break them clowns up something different, buck 'em with the fucking Smith an'
Wesson, MC's never leave my section
Finger on the trigger, I figure I kill that nigga for stepping
I tote the four-fifth, riff and get your jaw shift
Flip phones and mad jewels got me looking gorgeous
Ignore the style and get bucked down, child
With the three-pound pal, BLAOW! How you like me now?
The new improved Flow, you know how I do so
Whatever, a motherfucking terror like Cujo
I'm out to get mine, I want mils, God
Niggas that feel hard, chill or fuck around and get your grill scarred
It's D-Flow, you know my steelo, ceelo will lie you know how we go
Chop him like a kilo and let him die

[A.G.]
And I'm a add on like arithmetic
Suckers careers get stopped so just watch who you riffing with
I'm on point with the snakes and fakes
Ain't the one (think I am?), you get hung like drapes
And it's proven, point blank that's the conclusion
Seeing me losing, it's all an illusion
Like the raw ism, I'm a kiss him when I hurt him
Then desert him, cause Show & A.G. shit is sickening
Giving stress to them snakes is a ritual
Nikes and North Flakes, oh yes, they bless the physical
Promote the Glock? No I'm not
I use it as a art, ain't got heart to disrespect hip-hop
Time to breeze, now I'm gone, the Crates is rolling strong
So add on and on

[Hook]Here we go, so pay attention to the teacher
Here to preach a lesson to reach ya
Brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews
Think that I'm joking? Well then F you
Cause I'm here to put you up on a crime scoop
It'll only take a minute of your time, troop
So don't be a dummy or a lame brain
Lord Finesse is teaching so just maintain
I'm not trying to diss you or even teach you
But here to teach you we are all equal
And show y'all in fact there's a better way
Than depending on Welfare or Medicaid
So finish up school and pass the scholar quiz
And show your children what the value of a dollar is
Cause many children are hard to please today
Cause they're searching for some type of easy way
But there's not, so who's at fault here?
So think about the lesson being taught here
How many brothers in the world you see today
Can say that they're living the legal way?
Out of 20, I could say a few of them
Out of seven I could say about two of them
Live correct and, show respect and
Don't sweat was is owned by the next man
Or front the role, being harder or tougher
Or live the life of a hustler
Selling that white stuff just to make a fast buck
But they don't stand tough when in handcuffs
So understand and comprehend and see, kid
You don't wanna take a fall like he did
Or she did or they did, or how others did
So don't sweat the lifestyle of another kid
Get yours by achieving and planning
So when they fall you'll still be standing
Set your goal, and know what your quest is
Open your ears to this positive message

"Listen up, listen up" "We're all in this together" - Cut 4x

Now I'll scramble, because life's a gamble
And like others, you go out like a candle
Like my man Tone who had crazy potential
Before he went to the house for the mentally
Disturbed, before he had crazy truck jewelery
If he wasn't scrambling, you could have fooled me
He was paid, to all the girls handsome
He could have passed for Donald Trump's grandson
He had what it took, the fame, the glory
Yeah, let's get deep in the story
Drug dealer Tone had everything sewn
Lots to own, he had a car with a phone
A cool brother, maxing, chilling
He always hung out in front of the building
But in the drug game there's no time for maxing
You always have others who want some action
And so many was jealous of Tone
Cause of the things he owned and how he got known
He had a few friends, or rather he thought he did
Some hired help, some really dirty naughty kids
Blood they shed, will kill people dead
And fill them with lead at the nod of Tone's head
For Tone, everything was going great
Because him and his friends would sit and conversate
He would chill, relax and just sit back
His friends got unruly, but Tone wasn't with that
Til one day he saw them sharing it
He thought to himself "It wouldn't hurt to experiment"
So they passed it (inhales) he hit it
There you have it, Tone got addicted
Like most drug stories, the end sound the same
Cause everything he had went down the drain
He lost everything, the money, the work
The car, to Tone, drugs came first
The wrong thing was for Tone to start that
He was getting beamed up like a member of Star Trek
The young brother went insane
Forgot his name, yo that's a damn shame
But someone in the street took responsibility
And checked Tone into a drug facility
Now Tone has a chance to get better
And clever, and get himself together
You may not like the way that I say this
But drugs ain't nothing to play with
So don't be pressured by what the grown say
Be yourself and walk your own way

"Listen up, listen up" "We're all in this together" - Cut 4x[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo once again it's the Big L, that kid who got much props
From killin corrupt cops, with motherfuckin buck shots
So don't step to this, cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big but they make coffins yo' size too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Cali, it's Harlem nigga we do walkbys
No one can match me, tax me or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps G just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me being a virgin, that's idiotic
Cause if Big L got the AIDS every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
And I put more holes in his ass than swiss cheese

[Hook]
(Thugs better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'mma have your family dressed in all black

[Verse 2: Big L]
I steal lives like a stone thief, so leave me alone chief
Or catch a buck shot to your domepiece
I must warn, I got it goin on, word is bond
Ducks be gettin thrown off platforms like P.M. Dawn
I'm catchin bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers, not just on niggas but hoes too
So don't try to test me, cause I can't stand test-es
Fuck around, I'll introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears, pal
But man you've been rappin for years now
And ain't made a hit yet, you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews, I come out of wars barely bruised
I'm puttin motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the git-go
Leavin fags in bodybags with tags on they big toe

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big L]
Yo ever since I was young, I ripped mics and I killed beats
And I'm known to milk freaks and hit em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name, I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS, then I'mma start rapin bitches
I'm all about makin papes kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past, stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty G's is what the creep stole; so the next day
Knocked on his door and shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Got it goin on, from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style I'm wild, comin straight out of Harlem pal
It's Big L, the motherfucking problem child

[Hook]

[Outro: Big L]
This goes out to all y'all bitch-ass niggas
So if your mother ain't ready for a funeral, don't FUCK with me
Cause I know a good way to get your family together
And I ain't talkin bout a reunion motherfucker
Yo, I'm bout to sign out, but before I go
I gotta say peace to the NFL crew, you know who you are
And all y'all niggas talkin that gun shit
And won't bust a rhyme, stop fakin the funk!
Word, I'm bout to get up out of here
Yo I'm out B, yo peace man
I gotta get this money
So all y'all niggas on my hitlist get your suits ready
Hahahaha![Fat Joe]
Welcome to the world of Joe, flooded with thugs and hoes
Real niggas, drug dealers, with villas in the Strolls
Lexus and Rolls parked in twenty-car garages
Living the largest, with Oriental massages in garbage
Shit, I get down for mine
Terror Squad run things in any town you can find
New York, New York, big city of dreams
Where there's nothing but foreign cars, bitches, and triple beams
I fiend for cash, fat pieces of ass
Never giving a fuck, get your shit laced up
The corrupt crutas wake me up to new crimes
On news prime: gangster rapper goes nuts and wounds nine
Joey Crack's the rock, known for packing Macs and Glocks
Stay away from Little Puppet cause his ass is hot
Shot, in the middle of the street
Pretty boys don't sleep cause beauty is only skin deep

[Lord Finesse]
While you playing games, we claimin fame slaying dames
The aim is to make Mo' Money like Damon Wayans
You know our names, we don't play jokes
Niggas ain't feeling us? You ain't supposed to, that's for gay folks
You stay broke, we stay holding and stay rolling
Rap's Beethoven, exploding, my game's golden
Pockets swollen, we make the freaks stare
Roll with some chocolate grimey niggas, but ain't nothing sweet here
Keep clear, ah yeah so get stepping
Make hit records off of loops that's six seconds
No question the cash tipper, the ass whipper
Need a chick that can hang, fuck you broads that wear glass slippers
Bigger, city slicker, you cats follow me?
Finesse is among the stars like astrology
Greater knowledge, G, shit's wild, I flip styles
On the mile, let me pass it off like Chris Childs

[Fat Joe]
Yo it's all love, thug niggas and all of the above
Drug dealers, killer, niggas at the Player's Club
Young ladies, sisters, rump shaking bitches
Niggas on the Island rock 150 stitches (Repeat 2x)

[Big L]
Yo my cash flow don't get low, it just increase
And whoever tries to take mine will rest in peace
Keep a stone look, peace to every known crook
Not those who go to jail and can't hold they own and come home shook
So hold on and prepare to get rolled on
My crew robs every fag that walks through with gold
Cats who act rah rah will catch a jim star scar
Punks who fake the funk don't get far, pah
Me and my clan parlay sipping Grand Marnier
At a party at the bar is where we stand all day
In '97 I'm bubbling, no more stuggling
If I fall, it's back to selling drugs again and busting slugs in men
No doubt, you know what I'm about
The last slouch that walked through my block didn't make it out
Because I stuck that nigga, then I bucked that nigga
(I felt sorry for that kid) I didn't fuck that nigga

[A.G.]
We be the bomb, baby, indeed I smoke weed
Been ripping shit since the late 80's, so what you need?
Not scared to fall, that's why I rise and stand tall
And send y'all back to the wall like I'm Darryl Straw
The truth is, don't give a damn if you're ruthless
Make it happen, I look at platinum niggas like "Who's this?"
Woe the the bloody city, Babylon will
Die in its inequities, project overkill
See me in the future shining, gold with diamonds
A nigga been used to climbing, my whole life
That's a trademark, if it ain't rough, it ain't right
We bring the heat, all you do is bark, we bite
I'm authentic, and once I send it, it's unretrievable
Like nuclear missles, cause meant it, now it's time to lace this
Resort to the basics
Niggas get rushed just because, hush and don't say shit[Intro: Lord Finesse]
Yeah...just about now in the studio, I'm cooling out with Scratchmaster
Rahiem, Andre the Giant, my DJ Mike Smooth, Shlomo on the engineering
Tip, my man DJ Premier from Gangstarr...We're gonna kick this off
Something funky for this track, know what I'm saying?

[Verse 1: Lord Finesse]
Now when it comes to rhymes, I'll drop a swift one
('They'll be another rough rhyme after this one' - Rakim)
I'm the rap senator, ake about ten of ya
The best MC on the southeast perimeter
Equipped to flip with the slip of a lip
So dance, hop, or skip or shake your hips
Cause I'll wax and tax, eat ya up like a Kit Kat
Don't even riff back, I ain't with that
Skillful sharp with the words of an index
Spark and glow MC's like Windex
Swifter, faster, microphone master
Lord Finesse writes rhymes by the chapter
Adapt to rap but I won't even break yet
So damn hype that I might blow your tape deck
Full grown, stoned to the bone
Write rhymes and poems just to get known
Superior sargeant, take your whole squadren
Toast MC's, eat em up with margin
Cause I'm smart like Einstein, I say the fly lines
I get funky while you play the sidelines
Here to take care of you, never sound terrible
Ready equipped, cause I'm always available
To rag, snag, and rip the mic
Cause me and Dre will get ya hyped
On top in rank and I plan to stay there
The funkiest poet out since Shakespeare
Take note of this soloist, cause I'm a pro at this
Even make the crippled want to get up and go to this
Now MC's try to get rid of me
But, I won't fall in negativity
Cause I'm well respected, Lord that's majestic
Rhymes are written by thoughts that's selected
Released in public, but not as a subject
Many are below it but not quite above it
Dre my brother, drop the know how
One, two three, here we go now

[Verse 2: A.G.]
Finesse, it's my turn to kick a swift one
('They'll be another rough rhyme after this one' - Rakim)
You know an MC, well tell him to hybernate
Cause Dre Smooth is flowing at a liver rate
You knock em out the box, I'm knocking niggas out
You fear the Giant, well money live it out
I'm not a punk, far from a chump
You sleep at all, and you will fall from the top bunk
I'm dropping math, science, and all that other shit
Step in the studio, it's just another hit
Take about ten from beginning to end
Don't mean to brag, but I am what I am
And that's a mean machine, a dream machine
You say, "Golly Polly, Dre's a jolly green
Giant" and you're not half or even semi
You say "Is he?" I say "Am I?"
The one you fear cause it's near
The time for your death so step to the rear
Now get off, let off, step off cause you're soft
Stop blushing I'm rushing/Russian like Mikael Gorbechov
Special tactics, you can't hack this
Brothers ain't half stepping, they're walking backwards
You can't get near, if you do, you're near here
Stepping to me like a man in a wheelchair
Pressure's like a new pearl, you're in a new world
I run with just a pen like a Catholic schoolgirl
Back in the first grade, thought you had it made
Got a tounge twister to catch a tounge blister
Sally sells seashells down by the seashore
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck more
No more twisters, for blisters Blistex
Now you're confused, you what's this, what's next
Tables rotate, you will go rate
Try to locate, but Dre won't negotiate
Slaughter toys say boys what's the science
You shugged your shoulders and quote "Andre's a Giant"

[Outro: Lord Finesse]
Yeah, that was crazy funky. Yo, like I said, we two brothers just getting
Crazy funky in the studio and we gonna drop it like this...see ya!(Bad mutha)

[VERSE 1]
Turn up the radio, better yet the phonograph
And I'mma school the suckers who don't know the half
I'm not a legend, I'm real and actual
Bite my rhymes, I get mad and come after you
I don't front or pretend cause that's imaginary
I get funky with the use of vocabulary
I'm more deadlier than a bottle of cyanide
When I dig in my brain and say a fly rhyme
I might bust and say a little somethin
Get the party pumpin, yo, that ain't nothin
So don't bore me, I've been naughty
Even as a kid people said: "Look at shorty"
Back in the days I had much attention
Speak of competition - man, listen
Even then I've coulda been a funky star
At the age of 12 I was rhymin on them monkey bars
A little kid with the art of poetry
Nice for my age, but nobody noticed me
Nowadays I tell it like it is
That makes my skill different from her or his
I sport my skills on a F.M. frequency
Lettin people know you better not sleep on me
I'm known as a smooth cool brother
A funky technician, call me a (bad mutha)

[VERSE 2]
I play MC's like a game of Mario Brothers
I hold my own, plus I can carry another's
Rhymes I make strong and watch em take form
On a sucker who steps out his face wrong
I'm the MC to fear and run from
Shockin so much you think I'm usin a stun gun
I hold the title cause I'm the cool champ
If rap was money you'd be rated as food stamp
You try to boast and toast, you go by what name?
You can't get with Finesse, you're just jump change
You couldn't cut it even if you had a hack-saw
You're just a rap that I laid a track for
Cause records get mixed up, foes get ripped up
If a mic was a freak, I'd get my tip sucked
So girls, don't sleep, don't even doze off
I'm good with a mic, plus I'm good with my clothes off
And I'm no joke, far from a slow poke
I school the young bucks, plus school the old folks
I got stamina, lyrical examiner
Moppin, sweep up rappers just like a janitor
Lord Finesse parallel to no other
The smooth lover, and also the (bad mutha)

[VERSE 3]
At a show I get fly and so legit
Gimme a mic onstage and that's all over with
On a stage I'm straight up wildin
I can kick a party like a brother from the Shaolin
Temple, I find it simple
I get the ladies cause they sweat my dimples
Me take a loss? Not by a long shot
Get off the tip cause you jumped on the wrong jock
Of the wrong man put up on the wrong scoop
You got problems, what you're on, troop?
Raise up, I light the whole stage up
So wild with the mic, I oughta be caged up
I'm a brother you dare not lay a hand on
I leave you more bloodier than a tampon
If you split, I'mma get you later
Rhymes more fresher than a virgin in a frigerator
Take caution to what this brother say
Come correct or turn around the other way
(Bad mutha) is the perfect description
Of me rhymin or just plain flippin
I'm no joke when it comes around to that
I start flippin when I hear the sound of rap
I'm enhanced to keep in step with it
And surprise MC's cause you slept a bit
So wake up, my man cause there's no time for dozin
My thoughts are set, and a rhyme has been chosen
From my brain which makes me insane
To gain some fame, Lord Finesse is the name
To seek and blame cause I came and rearranged
My style of rap will make suckers wanna leave the game
I'm superior compared to others
Call me Lord Finesse, better yet make it (bad mutha)Now we found out, some time ago that if you take a whole group of really
Superbad dudes, and hang em in together they'll make some music whether or not
Somebody else thought it was hip or not
You know, they be OK
You dig?
Somebody's got to start it

Verse One: O.C

It's like me against anyone
First full verse is spontaneous, combustion thrusts me
No rapper can dust me
Bounced upon the scene with a theme, Word...Life
I cut fantasy out cause I differ from a dream
Wisdom lies deep in my molecules, you assumed
I fell victim to, hip-hop blues
You way off I stay on tour often rockin spots
On the California coast, range you know back to Boston
Enforcin my theory, leavin rappers teary-eyed
Fly most who came and thought they had stride
You accustomed to cussin and bluffin fussin for nothin
Half of y'all crumbs are just soft like muffins
I bake, masterpieces, sharper thesis
Y'all candy coated motherfuckers stink like feces
Needless to say, are these running shoes yours?
You retreated when I gave out head for wars
My microphone set is immensely brick wall
Solid in and out you slept so now snore
Who got my back, you ask Lord and BlastMaster
Unorthodox, combinations from the masters
Mics I menace, when it's finished
You get an understanding of what we bringin, no gimmicks

Verse Two: Lord Finesse

My decision is precision, I'm ill in ways you can't vision
I got niggas worshippin Lord Finesse like religion
You can't fuck around, you're kiddin
You don't want no collision, you better fly South like a pigeon
Good riddance, I flip flows you can't imagine
I break down your Flintstone style, into fragments
So pay attention to the man rappin
Don't think that it can't, I'm livin proof, it can happen
I reign supreme logical, verbally, I drop it in ways
That you never dreamed possible
So lyrically, I personally figure
That my Harvard style, is too deep for you nursery niggas
When I clutch the mic, I'm comin rough and right
I build more than them workers on construction sights
I'm skilled at it, I'm Illmatic
So yes answers your question if you ask me do I still have it
I'm the realest, the illest
Comin out the woodwork, like them homos in the Village
But seriously, I'm got the remedy
If I's at the bottom of the toilet
You niggas still couldn't shit on me
Originally, it's the same the vet
I'm on that get rich list, but they didn't call my name yet
I make it special like a prom night I bomb mics
While other brothers are old news like Walter Cronkite
It's critical, you got these Xerox individuals
But word life, it ain't nothin like the original
I wreck kids, that's my theory and perspective
When it comes to hip-hop, I'm on the case like detectives
You better step to the next man
Cause the greatest soccer player couldn't kick it like Finesse can

Verse Three: KRS-One

This is the scientific extra-prolific terrific
Mystic simplistic metaphysic, no gimmick type lyric
When you hear it or hear me, runnin through the scrimmages
You see images, affecting your sight to make you go
(Yo there he is! No there he is!) No here he is
Rockin your superiors, in your hardest area
Your lyrical skills are inferior
It's because your video that they cheer for ya
I'll take care of ya, quickly, cause I cannot take it
Your weak head needs to be decapitated
Cause you fake it
If your heart was caffeine, well you're now decaffeinated
You scream battle but it's the end of your career
You anticipate it, I hate itCareer ended, how splendid
For wack MC's I come doctor recommended

Haha! You know whassup when Lord Finesse up in the piece
All you wack ass rappers better go rewrite your album
O.C. in the house, KRS in the house, yeah
New York style in the house, yeah
BDP crew in the house, YEAH...Yeah
This is clasic shit right here, vintage shit
Go get ya tape decks ready uh
You know I had to bring 'em back hahahaha
Terror era's the squad man
Yeah uh yo uh yo

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Aye yo I'm old school like Rick Ruler sick jewels to big buddah
Lift dudes wit the six shooter Luger (Ooh Yeeah)
That means bring it back NY king of that
The best tried a dead mind but just can't see to that
The 4th comin don't look now theres more comin
And we all stunnaz wit lil money but still hungry
True story once threw a nigga from a two story
Asked for my paper said theres nothin he can do for me
Thats like takin a steak out of a lions mouth
Betta yet that like takin a plate outta Ryans mouth
Thatll neva happen ova my dead body
Feds got me plastered on the wall like I'm the heir to Gotti
I swear to Mambo and Nore and all the left wreck
A nigga try front on his body he gettin sent back
Dont resent Crack I'm just what you wanna be
Young rich and famous bitches can't get enough of me
And they runnin up on me usually in groups of them
But not just everyday but you could neva be too use to them
I be abusin them squeezin fresh oranges
Breakfast in the mornin get some strength and then it's on again

[Hook: Fat Joe, Big L, & Big Pun]
I just had to bring 'em back
(Word you definitely know what I'm about)
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
(All my friends call me stout)
I just had to bring 'em back
(Flamboyant baby)
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

[Verse 2: Big L]
When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
I'm quick to buck a duck and I don't give a fuck about 5-0
A hard core life I toast to ex flaw
Therefore I live raw and went to war wit the law
My only picture was a mug shot slugs were thugs got pot
Get swellin hops from sellin tops to da drugs spot
G's was clocked fat knots was in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the Glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight
Cause we put the guns down and go one round
Wit the hands but man I ain't the one, you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style, cause I'm versatile
Quick to burst a child I'm livin worse than foul
I pack two techs in case ya crew flex
I wet up the set in a second yell whos next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like Shaft
Turn ya staff into a blood bath to laugh
You'll get smashed like a deli snack, you softer than jelly jack
I attack in black wit a gat and a skully hat

[Hook]
I just had to bring 'em back
(All my friends call me stout)
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
(Flamboyant baby)
I just had to bring 'em back
(Terror Squad cause we stunt)
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

[Verse 3: Big Pun]
No doubt I'm from the X and I seen it all
Shorties wit dreams of playin ball for Seton Hall turnin fiends a full
From Meda ward to Sacuon the same sad song
Is bein sung, its like gimmie a gun and I'm back on
Joey Crack, Pun, TS, Bronx regulators
Stomp little niggas to death for tryin to imitate us
Yall could neva see us, be us, TS, kill da bs
Cause Pun got more guns and funds than Undeas
Un be us, I'm from the BX so I have to roll
Blast the 4 crash ya door smash ya ho
Hack off ya skull, I'm stackin heads like totem poles
Blow a hole in ya colon throw you from here to Fordan road
Blow fa blow, I toe to toe with the toughest
Bring the ruckas to the roughest muthafucka its nothin but luckstress
My crews are cussin to bustin ass crushin glass
In niggas faces leavin traces of red out this bloody bath
I want the cash off the jiddump, I cock and blast the piddump
At any piddunk tryin to laugh at the Briddonx
You ain't no kiddon for the Terror Squadron
You feel the fear of God when I steal a car and flatten ya Pierre Cardan
I peirce ya noggin if you startin trouble, spark the dot above you
And watch it blossom like a flower throughout the borough
No doubt I'm thorough with a parascope rifle extended rycle
Cycle thatll tear the whole Bible out
I'm sweatin no idols a title's all I request
Best rappers know that Pun and Y the chaperones of death..

Capone:
It takes nothin' but a hot slug to fill a villian
Crook I'm about to make a killin'
So weed to escalate the feelin'
I regulate the dealin' jealous niggas hate the feelin'
I stack my safe appealin' jake on my trace I'm peelin'
And what a Mecca had whole fuckin' nation kneelin'
Embrace the wheel and hit a buck without crashin' fuck
My drug passion got a nigga stashin' fast what
One love to Hillbillies, run forever out to Chile
Playin' the cuts nigga what can't stop the willy
Cops harassin' niggas blastin' while the day' passin'
Time for action cock the mac what a satisfaction
Shoot laughin' slug caught up in the chest gaspin'
Nigga blanked out chopped before he start rappin'

Hook:
Khadafi:
Microchips in the celly the game don't stop (don't stop)

Noreaga:

Street niggas that's grown men
Bold face gat in your face stay in your place
Yo crime-laced, catch more beef than Scarface (x2)
Court case illegal minds too late
Back in '92 (you remember Juice son?)
I bucked toast and got locked General Emanuel
Cell block cold crop
Go bagged up weak by cream cop
(FUCK THE WORLD) The way the world cold dissed me
Haile Selassie, Papi, locked with posse, call up Khadafi
Collect call from Arab Nazi, the Foul Mahdi
You relate in jail gate (what what, what what!)
Them new jacks they comin' through
Scared to death of the jail stories that's true
You cold weak, live life on the street
While locked up, homoed out with pink sheets (bitch nigga!)
Discrete, in your cell, shook to sleep
I wiled out, no doubt, 'til the day I'm out
Me personally, (what!) I did three kid you weak
Your station in P.C
Outro:
Son fuck this jail shit so tell 'em about the streets son (echo)[Hook](Repeat 4x)
It's like that, y'all, check it out now
(Yeah yeah, now check the method)

Fuck that, you know who's bigger
Even though nowadays you got all these motherfucking new niggas
Fuck those who spread rumors, I didn't retire
Even though you got all these Lord Finesse juniors
Trying to get hype and rip mics
They just imitators that can't quite get my shit right
So won't y'all just face it
That y'all sweat me so much I gotta give my dick a facelift
Wanna battle, I'm all for it
When it comes to this, I've been through more shit than a toilet
Now we could get wild and search for peace
Cause right now I'm chillin', like the nigga home on work release
And even on a lover tip I'll still wax brothers quick
When I do my thing I be on some old other shit
Niggas I slaughter, just to bring order
Aw fuck it, my shit be flowing like spring water

[Hook](Repeat 2x)

Now it's the dictator whose style's greater
It's the man with more flavors than motherfucking Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fucking with me, I give 'em hell
Yeah, so don't try to front, troop
When your style is played out like an Osh-Kosh jumpsuit
Huh, I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit, so protect your fucking neck, nigga
I don't front like a man on a high horse
But yo, I make more noise than July 4th
So run, son, I ain't the one, bum, who dial 911
If you don't, you's a motherfucking dumb dumb
I'm not a role model, I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap, I got skills out the ass, nigga
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse, that's like the NBA without Jordan
So all you new jacks kicking wack raps it's a fact that
I'll be on your fucking back like a napsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Cause the ladies still jel me without an LP

[Hook](Repeat 4x)

It's like that y'all, and I keep figures
It's the hardcore ruffneck funky type of street nigga
Lord Finesse got the swift rap and
You don't need Dionne Warwick and them psychic friends to predict that
In years to come I'm bound to shine
Give me a mic and a minute, I'll show niggas I get down for mine
Word life, you know the haps
Fucking with me is like bungee jumping with no rope attached
Man listen, I got plenty rhymes
When it comes to props, motherfucks just oughta gimme mine
Word, cause I slay ya fast
Whether you're the best MC with a mic, or you're straight up trash
My lyrics excel, hops
From the ghetto street upstate to motherfucking cell blocks
No dought I got clout
I gotta give a shout (To who?) To my brother Show when I'm out

[Hook](Repeat 4x)[Intro]

[Hook]
It's like that y'all check it out now
(Yeah Yeah, now check the method) x4

[Verse 1: Mwenya]
I'm a beast, an animal; Feast on MC's like a cannibal
It's not my fault that they walk into my mandibles
Flow intangible, untouchable; God Particles
I'm not a God MC but I'm definitely spiritual
I'm indubitable, sick but not curable
Dr. Dre fucked up with my pharmaceuticals
I miss the doobies dude, life was beautiful
Back when my hair kept it shaggy like Scooby Doo
And who are you to judge the life I live?
I see my future like it's tatted on my inner eyelids
I'm not violent but I kill with silence
That's kindness, I give an inch and they take a mileage
I bust a rhyme like a leader of the new school
And I'm on point like A-T-C-Q tip, top shape
Bitch I bring the bass like a fucking earthquake, Wayne

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mwenya]
So now it's verse 2, you know I'm finna spit like perfume
Shhht Shhht, if you want you could learn too
I got that verbal that emotionally burn you
Make a grown man write it down in his journal (It was a nightmare)
And I won't stop
I never started from the bottom like some flip flops
They say Hip Hop is dead, well I'm a fucking Zombie
Keep it classy like I'm wearing Fitch & Abercombie
And I'm connected like Wi-Fi, even though I'm old school like tie-dye
I'm still fly like Sci-Fi, and Imma stay at your neck like a tight tie
It's simple, people pop champagne I pop pimples
I'm eighteen with a great dream and a sick instrumental
And I feel myself like blind men
Cause I'm breaking boundaries, like that hymen
So what more can I say?
I kill shit like an assassin, I should get paid
And I'm only a signing away
So Lord Finesse please just take it away

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lord Finesse]
It's like that y'all, and I keep figures
It's the hardcore ruffneck funky type of street nigga
Lord Finesse got the swift rap
And you don't need Dionne Warwick and them psychic friends to predict that
In years to come I'm bound to shine
Give me a mic and a minute, I'll show niggas I get down for mine
Word life, you know the haps
Fucking with me is like bungee jumping with no rope attached
Man listen, I got plenty rhymes
When it comes to props, motherfuckers just oughta gimme mine
Word, cause I slay ya fast
Whether you're the best MC with a mic, or you're straight up trash

No doubt I got clout (Word)

Yo, pitchin the mission itchin for niggas to mention
These rhymes don't catch attention incidental composition
But alas I kick that, pro rap, boogie for the rookies
Who can't adapt fully, basically that shit be bull, see

[Lord Jamar]
Ya see this track be pullin me like gravitation
Collaboration with the Artifacts, bustin on this Lord Finesse creation
Causin heart attacks and palpatations
Amalgamation like steel, we calibratin mics to keep it real

[Tame One]
I feel blessed by Finesse and Lord Jamar, sess my interest
Is invested in, testin men like lab specimens
My daily regiment of elemental babble
Keeps MC's rattled, I'm breakin my words up like Scrabble

[Lord Finesse]
Not the type to try to ever diss, lyrically, clearly, the cleverest
Don't front, we blow your spot like the terrorist
We do our thing and stand strong like Mt. Everest
The 'Facts, Lord Jamar, Finesse bringin terror kids

The new procedure is to keep a straight face like Mona Lisa
When we beat you with the speech
We break down and decipher the rap codes in any zip code
Now watch us flip the mode like our shit went gold
Bar playin stars get scarred and left salty
By the terror with more L's than Laverne loose in Milwaukee
Good Son like Macaulay Caulkin, stalkin and walkin
I express best when smokin sess with a good Walkman

[Lord Jamar]
I'm breakin rappers into pieces, the Black Jesus
Attack your system like diseases lyrics for the ninety-six releases
Find me in the mix, where the trees is
Puffin L's in threes, tryin to make G's kid
Studyin degrees, livin lovely with my universal family
Rollin in the MPV, makin beats on the MPC

[Lord Finesse]
Uhh, check it
It's the grand hitter, that's stands bigger in your transistor
That's historical like your late great ancestor
Ain't no hurtin me, certainly, personally
This verse'll be, the hottest shit out since Mercury
Check it, I deserve respect child because I project styles
More mysterious than the X Files
I can build and expand on it
Some got 'Five on It', fuck it, I got a hundred grand on it

[El Da Sensai]
Really y'all niggas feel me when we step on the spot
Lyrics on cock, stroke and pop, open crews that's hopin
That the punishment ceases MC with masterpieces
Out to burn so learn, and check this fat thesis
X's and O's diagrams shit to flow
Cram expertise the bro, nigga from the East so
As we start to shine, brothers get the dick
Lyrical spit for crews who can't fuck with it

*scratching of above to fade*Intro:
It's the number one crew in the area

[Verse 1: Big L]
The Big L be lightin' niggas like incense
Gettin' men lynched, too intense, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A Tec-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit so protect your fucking neck nigga
Not a role model I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap I got skills out the ass nigga
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all ya new jacks kickin' wack raps
It's a fact that I'll be on your fuckin' back like a knapsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Because bitches still gel me without a motherfuckin' LP

[Hook]
It's the number one crew in the area
"Known for sendin' garbage MCs to the graveyard"

[Verse 3: Microphone Nut]
Yo I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep
I'm giving these ladies something they can feel cause I'm real
Ya man get outta line and it's kill kill kill

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Party Arty of Ghetto Dwellaz]
Yo you step up and you'll get played like the small fry
I'm throwin' niggas off the roof said you wanna be the Fall Guy
So mess around you'll be a dead man
I get hype tonight's the night like Redman
Nuff respect to Big L who get wreck
Chiggidy check yourself cause I ain't workin' with a full deck
I'm lethal, eatin' people
Not Jeffery Dahmer I'm the sequel, head or gut like Illegal
So what cha want?
Yo I'm strapped with the gats step up plap plap
I'm leavin' caps in your back fool
I rip tracks wanna say peace to hip hop
A nigga disagree bring it on and get dropped
I get wreck I'm Party Arty so hit the deck
The kid with the Tec smokin' niggas like cigarettes
Now some ask me how I'm gettin' jewels
I say big up big up it's a stick up stick up
I stick and move

[Big L:]
And that's how we do. So I.U. grab the gat and let loose

[Verse 6 Grand Daddy I.U.]
Yo rat tat tat I got the gat cocked
Nigga we ghost man a punk?
I let it roast and leave your pussy ass comatose
I'm shootin' up like the west is
Fuck suggestions
I'll blow out a niggas intestines
Better dip fast quick fast or you won't last
One blast will put your ass in a body cast
And I be killin' for rep get ill in a sec
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Constantly comittin' grand larceny
Arsony niggas don't want no parts of me
Never past up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels was truck he got his ass stuck
So what the fuck is you sayin' hops?
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Who's ever around when I be sprayin' drops
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas but I ain't tryin' to hear shit
I'll burn you faggot niggas like toast
If you die and come back I shoot your spirit
Now your ass is just a holy ghost
You tried to play me to the left
You better put a target on your head
Cause you're marked for death[Diamond D]
Now its the mad magician with the ill deposition
No repetition holding down Bronx traditions
My compositions simply squash the competition
Step up and get beat into submission
Cause this musician with the street intuition
735 fuel-injected transmission
My opposition will have to recognize my steez
Exotic trees, leave a trail of scuffed up knees
So please you couldn't touch this cat with a stick
Quick to inflict tricks blaze up in the flicks
Son I'm sick and you could put that on my mama
Exclamation point, quotation, comma
Lay up on the beaches when I'm down in the Bahamas
The skills go back to the days of Wonderama
So pass the scama, son its time to get this money
So we can relax and recline where it's sunny

[Big L]
I went from standing on the corner selling cocaine
To ripping shows live on stage with hoes yelling my name
To be precise ripping mics is the light of my life
You fronting like you trife but never pulled a heist in your life
The price of my ice is sky high, I'm a fly guy
That's every thug's dream I really love cream, it's in my bloodstream
You mad cause I got more chicks than you, more bricks than you
More nines with extra clips than you
Where I live it ain't a nice town
You can't walk around iced down
Some clown probably getting stuck right now
Peace to D-I-T-C, Show and AG, Fat J-O-E
Diamond D, Lord Finesse, and me
I'm from the East Coast, this is how we roll in New York
A bunch of rowdy niggas holding the fort
Jacking creeps, packing heat, these Harlem streets is for keeps
Much love to all my peeps who got covered with sheets

[Hook]
Most these rap cats don't know where it started, where it came from
We been repping this shit since Day One
Digging In The Crates originators
Why niggas player hate us, knowing damn well you can't fade us

[A.G.]
You better take me out quick
Cause I'm accurate when I bust mine
And make it count like Jordan at crunch time
Just in case I play Fishburne and double up on nines
You could never make it rain or stop my sunshine
So I keep eyes on these chumps the whole time
Take note of your technique like we scheme on dimes
Disregard your crew, fuck your heart
Put a slug in me, it'll be marriage, til death do us part
Until then master this art and kill them
With the pen that's dramatic, automatics I commit sins
Hold my head, but when I've had it I test chins
If that ain't real then feel the stainless steel
Bang 'em and hang 'em like they did our relatives
Thought he was the best on the mic that ever lived? Negative
Wu-diggity if you with me then say word
Lets get twisted like bottlecaps [and] create like Spielberg

[Lord Finesse]
Check the referral, man my whole squad's thorough
We worldwide, niggas just nice in one borough
We all gleam, plus we fiend for more cream
You got some nice players, they just on the wrong team
Knah'mean? As the world turns
To who it concern we'll set you straight like a perm
Rap apostle, lyrical type Picasso, kinda hostile
Nothing less than colossal
You dig me like fossils, be the cat with the groovy soul
Lotta rappers out here acting with no movie roles
You know the deal, I represent skills
And niggas with bent grills that live to make a mill
On the real that's my motto, too hard to follow
Will die in sorrow before I'm going out like Gravato
Hard to hit like Lotto, underworld role model
D.I.T.C. we be them cats of tomorrow

[Hook]

[O.C.]
Holding it down for D.I.T.C, niggas stink like feces
Coming against raw dogs you're lost
The way I stimulate rhyme and rhythmatic timing
On beat, off beat, drunk flow here we go
Assignments handed out, each individual stand out
Carrying his own clout
Phenomenal Moses of rap I pose a threat
Foes I put 'em on a block like a hole in a pen
Lyrical genocide on the witty side
Niggas give me respect due, like the pope in a synagogue
Who weighing my odds? O.C. far from a fraud
You waste my time nigga so I bagged your broad
Blow your mind ditto with no conscience
I decide the law motherfucker I'm Congress
This concludes my repertoire of what I be on
MC's make way for mines or get peed on
Fuck that[Intro: Diamond]
And you don't stop, ah keep on (Repeat 8x)

[Diamond]
Yo praise the Lord for Showbiz
My partner with the beats with the Nikes on his feet
Buying old records is a habit
I get more run than a Volkswagen Rabbit
You know I gotta have it
I got more props than the cop called McGarrett
Who played on Hawaii Five-O
When I formed a production company with Show
And Jay's Studio is the lab (the lab!)
But the session is closed cause I know you got a big nose
Trying to sniff out the name
You lack originality, and that's a damn shame
Don't front, I know I got you open
Like a pack of tokens, yo I pulled your coat and
I'm not the one to be gamed on
I didn't know it was your girl we ran the train on
But no hard feelings, your girl was appealing
Did my share of dealing, sexual healing
You didn't know she was a groupie
But I'm a put you up on a scoop, B
Used to live in Forrest, my daughter lives on Morris
Used to play softball with my man Horace
I kick flavor like my man Sonny Chiba
Aries is my sign, I'm compatible with Libra
I like to program beats
Diamond D is out, I wanna say peace
Showbiz there's deals to make
So let's get busy and dig in the crates

[Showbiz]
Yo, thank Allah for Diamond D
No afro instead he keeps dreads in his head
My partner from the past, from 163rd
Back when I was a hoodlum beating on nerds
It started way back (way back when?)
About 12 years ago, I was 9, he was 10
Before smoking weed or hanging out or playing hooky
We used to breakdance in the jams, "Electric Boogie"
Girls watched jocking, my nickname was Rock and
Crowds I was shocking, freaks I was clocking
Step up and see Showbiz performing
My beats hit hard like big George Foreman
So MC's and DJ's who thought they was nice and
Get upset like Buster did to Tyson
That wasn't the plan and he's still my man
Since he beat up Mitch Green outside Dapper Dan
Wait a minute that's a different subject
Talk about the Moet and the papers that's in effect
Back to the Show, the Show B-I-Z
Down with D.I.T.C., A.G. is my MC
Relying on the Giant, the Giant I'm relying
Never crying for the crack because I'm not a crack client
Girls stick like Crazy Glue, they think they're getting dough
But I treat hoes like drugs, I just say no
I lamp in the residence I'm keeping dead presidents
In fact, I like my pockets fat not flat
A rapper not a singer, so hooker don't bring a
Problem to me, so go ahead you humdinger
Show's about to blow in '91 so I'm straight
Down with the crew called Diggin' in the Crates

[A.G.]
So get back, get your sticks and get your bats
Get your licks and I'm a still get fat
Try to diss and get the backhand
I'm dressed in black, a black hat for a black man
The Giant is better and clever
Go ahead and sleep, and you'll rest forever and ever
I'm like a bomb, sometimes I'm calm
No telling what can happen once the mic is in my right palm
Me and Showbiz too deep, but don't sleep
Go ahead and retreat or face agony of defeat
A.G. is in command
You remember the black hat and the bottom of my Timberlands
Save it, if you think you pose a threat
Just chill and watch how many hoes I get
Now you sweat the props I got
(Kick a rhyme) A rhyme? Sure, why not?
Always get fat to a hype track
So Finesse (What's up?) sike, give me that mic back
The crowd I'll capture, microphone master
Finger licking and kicking lyrics from here to Africa
I'm the bold kind, my rhyme's a goldmine
Let it off, set it off, just for old times
Think you're ready for this, you wanna battle
Your music is riddle raddle, your rhymes are scribble scrabble
The Giant is greater so I'm great
Down with the group called Diggin' in the Crates

[Lord Finesse]
Now when it comes to lyrics, mics I pulverise
It's Lord Finesse, time to go for mine
So stand back, let the men play
I put rhymes in shape just like Bengay
I'm great and honorable, suckers I bomb a few
I run more games than a carnival
I'm a get mine, as soon as you say start
Sweat hoods and funky rhymes is my trademark
I'm a get fame, not from her or his name
Cause yo (What's up?) I'm funkier than a shit stain
Mics I smoke, rhymes I hurl
My hobby is collecting fly-looking girls
Strictly for the ladies, call me Lord Finesse
And I'm all about money and sex
Finesse is the name to say, and I came to play
We could have fun, but put the whips and chains away
Sex and money is what makes me a happy man
And I sport more styles than Jackie Chan
I keep rising, I'm not the type to sink low
Me take a loss on the mic, I don't think so
Lord Finesse is out to make papes
Down with the crew called Diggin' in the Crates[Big L]
Check it
When I'm onstage you niggas know who's mic this is
Sport the presidential Rol' full of ice-eses
My name it ring a bid-ell, I'm hot as hid-ell
I live swid-ell, how could you mention Harlem and forget L?
Me and you can get it on, and we'll see who get shitted on
You tried to do what I did but you did it wrong
I'm not a child, I'm a grown man
You push a Six but I own land, try that
You can't buy that, pass the lye black, let me fry that
Where I rest frontin fly cats get robbed and shot at
Knuckle up, bet I swell you
I stay Rolex-ed and never get tested, so what that tell you?
My whole crew puff blunts and fuck stunts
I won't lie, I got stuck once
Then I seen the kids who did it, cocked my gat and got that back
Now you figure the rest, I'mma stop at that
You still living cause I allowed it, coward
Running round, fronting hard like you "bout it, bout it"
But I doubt it, doubt it
What I recite be taking hours to write
So if you bite just tell your man what kind of flowers you like

[Lord Finesse]
I be that underworld Don, certified bomb
(What you after Pah?) The paramegan and nice swans
By all means my theme is to gross the cream like Joe
"I don't wanna be a player.." I'll just coach the team
Reign supreme, straight and still great
Can you relate? I'm after ill papes like Bill Gates
Don't flip drugs, just a slick thug that gets love
Make chicks bug then take it all off like strip clubs (uh)
Too slick, on some ultra-cool shit
On some "You gon' need me before I need you" shit
I got chicks hooked, have your cash shook
I got the shit that make ya....
Nigga look I've been right, you're skatin on thin ice
I hem mics, this cat's nice like Glen Rice
Game's tight, so just get the name right
Cause I'll be damned if half you cats can rock the same mic

[Hook]
Yeah dignified soldiers, we roll like bolders
Some of us are whilers, just while money holders
Come test the click we'll see who's the boldest?
Who's strong who's weaker whose heart be the coldest?

[A.G.]
Now while y'all bite like termites, we'll shine like torchlights
Burn mics, truth is I'm better off mics
Get raw like, G.D. on mics of all types
Four mics ain't enough, this royal flush is clutch
Realer than most, stay concealin' the toast
But reveal the flames like the last days, there's mad ways
To make the paper, but these chickens taste the vapor
I lace the flaper, wanna be major, that's my nature
I'm forced to kick the dopest shit, load the clip
Let my mind spray, foes submit, it's over with
Hold my click like the cheebas, drop bombs like bad receivers
You wanna see us? Then beep us, cause we off the hook
I smoke the cheebas and remain here cause they need us
Sell outs, they want to be us, but it ain't here
I blow spots and hold Glocks, for those cops
That try to roadblock my road to the top, I throw shots
If you're not, I'm bird hunting in the Suburb fronting
And I been peeped Duke, in the rearview, ain't nuttin'
That's what you say, but I say, "It's probably something"
End up frontin, but on another note, y'all MC's
Better take it while y'all can get it
Cause where we hit it we gon' rape it
To let you know that D.I.T.C. shitted

[O.C.]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Now who can recall all of the phenomenon is flawless
Like diamonds being dug from a mine, priceless
I am too much for the average man, nigga, who can?
You ain't, fuckin with Diggin' is like walking on quicksand
Shit, my crew will run a blitz on your team
Fantasizin' ain't our thang cause we far from a dream
We live and learn concern for one another like brothers
Am I my brother's keeper? No doubt I'm a believer in karma
Which niggas want to bring the drama?
Fuck with O.C. and get smoked like scarma or ganja
Let me remind y'all once (once)
If I gotta say it twice we gonna find y'all
The way we roll we have teeth chattering, now who's coldest?
Diggin' in the Crates crew, Dignified Soldiers

[Hook]
