[Hook]
I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Whipping work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas getting money from the fucking start
I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Getting work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas getting money from the fucking start

[Verse 1]
My Rolls Royce triple black, I'm geechee ho
Ballin' in the club, bottles like I'm Meech ho
Rozay, that's my nickname
Cocaine runnin' in my big vein
Self Made, you just affiliated
I build it ground up, you bought it renovated
Talking plenty capers nothing's been authenticated
Funny you claimin' the same bitch that I'm penetratin'
Hold the bottles up, where my comrades?
Where the fuckin' felons? Where my dogs at?
I got that Archie Bunker
And it's so white, I just might charge you double

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
These muthafuckas mad that I'm icy
Stunt so hard make them come and indict me
I think I'm Big Meech, look at my timepiece
It's an Audemars, hundred racks at least
Look at yourself, now look at me
You can't see a nigga, I'm what you used to be
Look at it this way, you niggas sideways
Always getting money my nigga, crime pays
So fuck a nigga, I'm Self Made
You a sucker nigga, I'm self-paid
This for my broke niggas, this for my rich niggas
Got a hundred on a head of a snitch nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
The thirty-six holes leave you bleedin' fam
Word to them thirty-six O's in a kilogram
Blunt tip, orange like caviar
Wilding out, fishtailing Subaru rally car
Out the passenger, letting the automatty off
A egg of that girl I'll knock ya Mommy and ya Daddy off
Fuck around and knock the emblem on the Caddy off
Four shooters bugging out, blicking at ya Caddy doors
Did I mention guns from Red Dead Redemption
Nine mils, fifty clip extensions
Coke is like a mattress in the hood, I'm flipping on it
And the money's like a chair, I'm sitting on it

[Hook][Intro: Jim Jones]
Jones, Dipset
Byrdgang, bitch

[Jim Jones]
Balling
Peace Blood, peace almighty
We all thugs and we run the streets nightly
And get my lawyer, why
Cause I ain't copping out
And I fuck with b-boys who bring the choppers out
One shot of that'll have the boys bring the coppers out
And we balling, foreign toys is what we hopping out
My feary side, where we ride
And we all fly high in the Lear G5s
So twist your fingers up and bang motherfucker bang
Get your money up, this cane is what we fucking slang
And 9 trey is what I fucking claim
It's Dipset Cap, the Don of the Byrdgang

[Snoop Dogg]
They call the D-O-Dub, wasn't really tripping cause
Twenty-one, twenty Crips and all of us is cripping cuz
We from a different street all got that different heat
But when we move the Macs for Game we on the same beat
So if you fuck with Blood then you fuck with us
And we ain't busting duds cause we busting slugs
We sure to stay in touch and clean your mess up
And if you from the West Coast, my nigga, W-w-w-w-westside

[Nas]
Game got at me about the remix, it's an honor my nigga
I made rap, one blood, that say I'm signing with Jigga
I got rappers getting mad at me
I got these new jack rappers trying to clap at me
I got these corny wannabe diss-song kings on the radio
Talking bout how they gon' spray and take me away
But I'm the true living legend
I'm not to be questioned
Have your whole hood holler shit about my progression

[T.I.]
You knowing my attitude shitty only a buck fifty
So I keep the Smitty's with me shit how many with me
What you scared, I'm prepared in the mall and all
With two two's you can call me Quick Draw McGraw
Bitch I'mma cut that fool, better call the law
I start spraying make fuck nigga fall and crawl
I press play like Puff, no pause at all
Chopping holes in all the walls that's all they saw

[The Game]
Hip-hop ain't dead it just took a couple shots
I bring it back to life give it a couple shocks
The King's coming no, I'm not Jay-Z
Too many niggas hate me but they scared to face me
This ain't a movie dog, no not Waist Deep
I'm not an actor but I'll show your bitch big meat
She giving one blood, one love on dubs
A hundred forty thousand the first week

[Fat Joe]
All these niggas wanna front trill with them stiff faces
Till them niggas lying still up in stiff cases
Within styrofoam and embalming fluid
I been gone too long and I'm down to lose it
Somebody go and get this nigga a pine box
And I ain't just talking about a measly nine shots
Yeah I'm chopper-happy and my wrist loose
Call me Goldie I'll smack your bitch too

[Lil' Wayne]
504 gangsta New Orleans soldier
Banging underwater fuck around and soak you
Louisiana gunner, I'm bout my holster
And if you getting greasy I'm an ulcer
I'm bicking back being bool on the Eastside
Of New Orleans where the Bloods at the B-Hive
Ain't nothing sweet unless it's Presidential
That is where I sleep now give me my key

[N.O.R.E.]
New York get the blood money, dirty cash still sweet
We with Black Wall Street by the swapmeet with heat
Def Jam they gonna flop him and Reggaeton ain't hot in the building no more
It's ok I get it popping
Back to the forest trees for deep, these little me's
Who took believers an opportunity to breathe
And you ain't gotta go overseas to see Iraq shit
You can come to LeFrak Queens and get jacked quick

[Jadakiss and Styles P]
One Blood we used to the spilling
Came from the hood so we used to the killing
Used to the Black males making cracksales in the building
How else you get the Benz with the suede on the ceiling
Blood in, Blood out
Me and homie back to back
Both loaded working we about to pitch a shut out
I'm New York's king I'm New York's hardest nigga
Anything in between's a motherfucking target nigga
D-B-L-O-C-K, he spray
The hawk'll find a nice home right where your cheeks stay
We got a mean team hip-Hop dream team
Them boys is only in the projects on green screen
Yeah no security, I'll put you on the respirator
I'm the bomb I'm the motherfucking detonator
One dutch, one bud, one burner, one slug
Want a couple casualties, but we'll settle for just one blood

[Fabolous]
What it look like all I say at most
Shooters waiting on the word just say it Los
I let these niggas live yes I saw em pull the plug
Have them goons pulling gloves, leave the room full of slugs
Catch me trafficking on maroon colored dubs
Couple Africans with balloons full of drugs
If they like me tell em line up
While I sit behind team point em out like a line up

[Juelz Santana]
Mic check, one two, one two check
I'm strapped, you strapped let's play two-on-two
Let's go you're eyeing us in the iron bus, boom
Leak you, two liters of red juice, Hawaiian Punch
So what you boys gon do to me, I'm born street
Your life's sweet, MTV's Laguna Beach
Mama told me not to play with fire but
She never told me I would grow to be a lighter

[Rick Ross]
One love to the gangs but I'm in the thangs
Save the colors for the cars see we kill for the fame
The boss made it yeah, we floss flagrant
Shame how I lost your life savings up in Las Vegas
I'm a heavy better, I'm a heavy seller
Keep white in the office call it Jerry Heller
Letting off a hundred rounds let the barrel pick
And we gon sit here and wait for the derelicts

[Twista]
Bitch Chi got Lords and Gangsters show me where them niggas at
Chi got Two Six's and Kings show me where them killers at
Chi got them ballas and hustlers show me where them figures at
Game where them triggers at
Aim at them fitted caps
He got the clips, I got the scope let's get them choppers nigga
He got the kush, I got the dope let's get it popping nigga
Heard he in that cherry six fo, shit ain't no stopping nigga
Hit him in the head and the body with a bullet
When I put him in the cemetary then I gotta holler out

[Daz]
Whattup cuz

[Kurupt]
Yeah rolling with two grips
Glock holding on the hip rolling with two clips
Got two tiny locos ready to take trips
Shake and make trips high stakes to take grips
But they know what's cracking cuz cause as we huddle
They hold cards down nigga like spades and pinochle
West coast gang bang, riders erasing em
Got funny niggas raising up and riders replacing em, cuz

[Daz Dillinger]
Draped in blue, notorious gangsta crew
RIP for niggas who don't stay true
Deep down in the crevices see the jets veteran
Dwelling in the land of the gang bang profession
I'm legendary yes, yes a Westcoaster
Throwing up two C's with two guns in my holster
I'm from Long Beach City a crip next to Compton
Down with my nigga Game if you niggas want problems
From the streets to the suites anywhere we can meet
Del Amo to Compton, Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide get swept away by the tide
By Gs and BGs, OGs it's time to ride

[WC]
Who the rider, looter through the gutter man
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes
From the Westside striving to dead em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans, blue strings, blowing blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and a blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese chunking up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub C and one Blood

[E-40]
The Bay Area fuckers we pop em
Open you up if you got a problem
Up top born in Cali-forn-ia
Clean your clock open your can of tuna
Make a choice either it's hell or it's heaven
Get your chest layed out with the FM 57
This ain't nothing to do with nobody
But in the Yay there ain't nothing to do but catch bodies

[Bun B]
I'm coming straight outta PAT like Compton in all black
But when we say what it do they never say holla back
Bun B the OG like '95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club offa Fairfax
Ask The Hundreds, it's doable I done done it
At the summit of rap and I'm watching you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it to Bun it don't differ
Wipe the streets with you like you a swiffer as a gifter one blood

[Chamillionaire]
I'm the realest youngster thats breathing and I don't gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire, y'all competing to be competing
My purpose is to get the cheese and as a purpose that should defeating
So shut your mouth, have a seat and be quiet till I finish eating
My label tells me I'm greedy, hogging all the room on your tv
Like Eric they think its Eazy, but it isn't easy believe me
Need to make a room in B.E. television if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy, I had to make room for me, G

[Slim Thug]
It's one Blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug it's still one love
I rep my blue boy team but I do it for green
I do it for my folks Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers future rappers standing out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood man and stack em a knot
Put your sets in the air scream fuck the cops
We gon rep for the hood man like it or not

[Young Dro]
My feed mashable, murders are catastrophical
Cars is improbable I'm overcoming obstacles
Trapping I made it logical my topic is impossible
I got a partner named Shoe Strang cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux, cars be tropical
All guns choppable all blocks are mobbable
I'm unstoppable my calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical, cushion is not ???

[The Clipse]
Red rum, red rum such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest was he talking to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior, look what the Lord gave you
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And reviving the track like we flowing through jumper cables
What duo you know get XXL kudos while copping off Coolio
Classic shit we mastered this left for dead, I'm back
I'm Lazarus

[Ja Rule]
Nigga, one Crip, one Blood
LA, New York
The Game, the Rule, one love guns up
Hands down, can't touch the flow is a bit much
The style wanna keep up
I'd advise you to speed up
With money moving like coke these days gotta re-up
G up, cop some heaters and dare a nigga to act up
You see us in dual seaters and throw it up
It's all hood niggas rep your sets if your Cuz or Blood
Niggas, we all bleed
These niggas can't breathe
Only because the guns are drawn and aimed to part
Niggas that got bullets with names on them
Want em, come get em niggas y'all know where to get at me
Look at me now pass me maybe you can be half me
You bastards, I'm laughing bullets sticking in family
Who sadly gets torn between one Crip and one Blood
Y'all niggas know me, yeah[Produced by The Alchemist]

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Fuck the frail shit
Cause when my coke come in
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with
[Styles P]
Carlssons on the jeep, Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life
[JK]
Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked
[SP]
The house costs a million, sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know: if it's furnished I'mma take it
[JK]
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money then you rubbing the spot
[SP]
Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands
On a yacht with our favorite albums
[JK]
A bad ho and a plate of salmon
Smoking and drinking, nigga is you thinking that our fate is violent?
[SP]
I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal
[JK]
And if you facing capital pun, pass me a gun
And I'mma give you time to run while I rapidly peel

[Hook - Jadakiss]
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

[JK]
I learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent
So when I fly now, I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case who's the loser?
[SP]
Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger
[JK]
Motherfuckin' niggas is back, Jada and P
We got water, X, haze
Plus weight of the D
And I'm tired of hearing about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted
Talking bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back
[SP]
Gun work's official but niggas don't be wanting that
(Why?) Cause they puss and they mans is lame
[JK]
We Soul for Real in the hood, we make Candy Rain
[SP]
I could easily send you to God
[JK]
But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
If you can't remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver the hard

[Hook]

[JK]
Ja- da- muah, I'll kiss you, you bitch ass nigga
Bet the hood won't miss you, you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean
[SP]
He be aight though
[JK]
You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
Cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eating right, getting good rest either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
"Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!"
And, y'all just talking, I'm doing it well
Jadakiss, motherfucker, I'mma see you in hell[Intro: Jadakiss]
Yeah, ride out, they ain't got no money
I'm losin' weight, uh, ride out

[Verse 1: Jadakiss and Styles P]
Gather 'round, y'all, it's goin' down, y'all
Block work, twenty-eight for the pound, y'all
If he the king, I put a round in his crown, y'all
He just talkin', but he pussy in the town, y'all
I air 'em out, then put 'em in the ground, y'all
Hit 'em in the church if he prayin' on my downfall
It's either this or you wicked with a round ball
It's a burial whenever we sound off
Hands to the no-hander right after the round off
Peanut butter guts, chocolate brown Porsche
Word to Spanish, José, we was movin' the most yay
Had my boys runnin' and gunnin', sound like 'Coach K'
Listen, duke, you be shoot, but you know that it's both ways
My gun splash brothers, I call 'em Curry and Klay
In a hurry to get buried ever fuckin' with J
Ah, Dave, come on, nigga, I see you ridin' the wave
Brave like the crackers that helped hire the slaves
Keep talkin', I kill you, then slide in your bae
You got a homie up top, I have him die in a cage
And you trigger-happy, you can't wait to fire the guage
Go out on your shield, though you die in a blaze
Gunfire, one liar, gon' put the truth in a maze
I got the truck off the sour, got a coupe from the haze
In the telly down south, I got me a few dames
We ain't fuckin', but we stuffin' they pussy with cocaine
Whipped out, fuck around and hop on the 2 train
Robbed the first and last car to show you some true pain
Wolf on the phone when I show you a few fangs
It's a different kind of hot, my nigga, it's blue flames
Dudes is startin' to get out of pocket; loose change
Hard part: tryin' to stay still, move things
Right before you about to murder someone, your mood change
We came up like ninety bricks
We had the city under siege since '96
Go online: you still won't find these kicks
Like Frank White when he did the Chinese hit
That's it, it's us, then everybody else after
Our part of the good books a rough chapter
Everything dead serious, enough laughter
Fronto leaves, Raw papers and Dutch Masters, yeah
You read more, you see more
They tearin' shit up on the streets in B'more
Some people don't know what it's like to be poor
The hood is a one-way, ain't no detour
You know the love course, the hate come free, y'all
Those who protect and serve will knock your seed off
The energy is negative, it's not to feed off
Shit'll cool down when we knock the heat off

[Outro: Jadakiss]
Get it? R.I.P. Freddie Gray
Rest in peace homie that they shot in the back in South Carolina
Eric Garner, Mike Brown, Glennis, rest in peace, baby girl
And all y'all rappers one[Hook (Styles P in parentheses)]
"I get high, I get high, I get high, I get high
I get high, I get high, I get high, I get high
I get high on your memory, high on your memory
HIGH on your memory..."

"I get high - high - high - high" (Every day)
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every night)
"I get high - high - high - high" (All the time)
"High-ighhhhhhh..."

[Verse One]
Everyday I need an ounce and a half
S.P.; the only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)
You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Aiyyo I smoke like a chim-in-ney {*inhaling*}
Matter fact I, smoke like a gun, when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did; add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the, M-5 pedal, when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I'mma smoke 'til my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious, and I, know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta, ride for a livin'
With my, real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)
This is S.P., dump it in you bitch, I get high

[Outro]
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every day)
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every night)
"I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory" (All the time)
"HIGH on your memory..." (Every day)
"I get high - high - high - high" (I am the Ghost)
"I get high - high - high - high" (Float with me)
"I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory
I get HIGH on your memory" (I get high like birds to planes)
"I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory"
I get HIGH on your memory" (I get high like, smokin' dubs to the head)
"I get high - high - high - high"
"High-ighhhhhhh..."[Skit from 'Planet Of The Apes']
Beware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death

[Poison Pen]
Yeah! Immortal Technique! SP the Ghost! Poison Pen! Vinnie Paz!

We gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, call your number out, send your uncle ??? out
We gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, nigga ain’t nothing civilized about no uncle ??? nigga, you feel me? Don’t bring no uncle ??? out nigga, fuck outta here

[Immortal Technique]
All troops in formation? Let the siege commence!

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Back like I was locked up, putting in work
Burning through books like Nazi's in a Catholic church
I'm cursed like Cain when he murdered his brother
Cut your face off and wear it while I'm fucking your mother
I'm Mars Ultor, the avenger, the god of war
And if you don't believe in me, I doubt you believe in God at all
I breathe smokeless fire, the Jinn type
That'll make you hate the way that Allah made you to live life
Like Hindu, niggas that be bleaching their skin white
Other people's teeth in my hands after a fist fight
I was born with a sixth sense and a swift right
Skinned werewolves and rape demons at midnight
Sell your kids into slavery after we murder you
Or sacrifice them in the same fire we burnin' you
Barbarian funeral, nigga, you wanna know?
Damn the river, bury me, and let the water flow

[Hook: Poison Pen]
Chaos, mayhem, bang outs, slay them, uprise, rape them, raid them
Cage em, pandemonium, insurgent, death merchants, commit the best murder
Pillage, Kill them, erase history, make them a mystery

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Cut the nose off, the ears off, the whole head
Immortal and Ghost coming, code red
You never seen a black barbarian
Warrior, warlord, pussy, cut your balls off
More bodies come, more bodies hauled off
What you want the sword and get shit sawed off
Your throat need an axe in it
And I'm breaking your back because your spine needed a crack in it
You bugging me, I'm coming to fumigate
The Wolverine, the Sabretooth, the way that I mutilate
I'm like the viking in Valhalla Rising
Except I got black skin and both of my eyes in
Don't test him, please don't stress him
He'll hang you from a tree with your own intestines
How you wanna die? Make your own suggestion
Now talk to the lord and make your own confession

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
You pussies living in a movie theatre
Put the motherfucking spell on you like brujeria
Chop his motherfucking head like a ruthless leader
Guns drawn in a church service, shoot the preacher
You need to be godly to know Allah
Ain't no rappers eating around me, like a broken jaw
It ain't ever been a day that I ain't broke the law
What you think I hold a motherfucking toaster for?
I ain't going there, there's police in that room
And Vinnie walk around with bags of dust like a vacuum
Bury you under the earth inside a black tomb
My body covered in Dashiki and stab wounds
I'm a guerilla, barbarians is my ancestors
That's a part of my neurological transmitters
We Islamic and brought the story of shem with us (Al hamdu Allah!)
While we brought the motherfucking blam blam with us

[Hook]

[Outro]
The walls have been breached! ANFALL!!!
We came in the name of peace and brotherhood, you wanted us bound in slavery, poisoned our water, changed our names...
Burn their homes, take their jewels, skin them alive!
Hold on, hold on, hold on...
No one will know these people ever existed, and all that will be left is what we build upon their ruins...[Hook - Jadakiss]
Uhh, used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed RYDE OR DIE, I thought you would die wit me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit me
Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed RYDE OR DIE, I thought you would die wit me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit me

[Verse 1 - DMX]
When it rain, niggas get wet, so stay dry (uh)
Don't cross me, I can peep a snake eye (woo)
You just lost me, like yo' shadow in the dark (uh-huh)
Fucked around and forced me to hit the shadow with the spark (UHH)
Blew your shit apart -- now it's two halves of one nigga
"Look at him," I said after a few laughs, "Dumb nigga!
Stupid is as stupid does -- cocksucker (WHAT?)
And look what being stupid does, get you shot sucker (WHAT?)
I let you get too close and you bit me (uh)
I told you nah for too long, you tried to hit me
Thought you was wit me (uhh)
Well you might as well forget me, cause from this point on (uh-huh)
It's war, it won't stop until one of us is gone" (c'mon!)
I'm still mad at myself for lettin that shit go down (UHH)
Somebody shoulda told me, I was fuckin wit a clown (aight?)
And I think they found and let.. you.. nigga.. drown
.. you know how shit get around

[Hook - Jadakiss]

[Verse 2 - Styles P]
Aiyyo X fuck them niggas, them niggas ain't your dogs
Better treat like some cats and shake they ass to the floor
Been seen the foul shit, put the guns in em
Lil' wannabe you's, so why you run wit em?
You can't trust niggas no further than you can throw em
You don't wanna murder the niggas, then you blow em
He usin yo' style, that make him yo' child
Then he shouldn't make a move til he hear it from yo' mouth
We don't allow snakes - runnin wit dogs
Tell them ain't nuttin like a funeral that's gonna be yours
Double-R, and I ain't here to start trouble God
But if they wasn't your niggas I woulda BEEN hit em hard
Niggas look like they phony (what) sound like they phony (huh?)
Run around actin like motherfucker's homies
We all make mistakes, that's part of the breaks
But you can still call the apes, we bringin the duct tape
And the broomstick -- them bitch-ass niggas is gettin raped
Know how we ride, whoever on they side can die
And we ain't tryin to be blind, fuck eye for eye
Cause we only takin yours, you know the doggs you motherfucker

[Hook - Jadakiss]

[Verse 3 - DMX]
There was always somethin there, but I just couldn't touch it (uh-huh)
Wasn't somethin that would hurt me, so a nigga said, "Fuck it!" (uhh)
I let it slide, laughed and joked let it ride (true)
Now that you done killed it, I'm glad that it died (AIGHT?)
It's aight, I know where you live, I'm just waitin (uhh)
Til we knock on your front door, and let you meet Satan (c'mon!)
That's what you get for hatin -- FUCK YOU FAGGOT! (WHAT?)
I never did trust you faggot -- I'll bust you faggot! (WHAT?)
What you done forgot about the streets is this: (uhh)
You do a drimy nigga like you do a grimy bitch (AIGHT?)
You just STOP fuckin wit him, you got no more rap (uh)
No more, "Yo whassup D?" No more dap (uhh)
Be lucky if I don't spit in your face, off of G.P. (WHAT?)
AND WHAT? Bitch-ass nigga, you can't beat me (woo)
Don't take it as a loss, just take it as a lesson
Next time think twice, or get iced wit the Wessun
NIGGA! (Nigga!)

Nigga you lookin' at Kiza Söze,

The young Jet , the old G
Spend on smoke what these niggas spend on for the whole Key
Low key,or High key
Drop a piano on your head if you try me
Or Young Roddy fly in the Maserati
Or the fleet with grow hand for the best look
The work move faster then Russell Westbrook
Kevin Durant on the dope stamp
My niggas pot heads ,but we the most in
I ain't the swag champ, I'm the Lo champ
Come and light it up with the smoke champ
D-Block Jet Life you know both camps
I get it in and I get it out
Pitcher money to me I hit it out

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]

I started smoken' heavy cause times was gettin' Harder
Step brother ?? he left me a revolver
Welcome to me city land of the less fortun
Glenwood Apartment Aka the Carter
Where they dont through ?? they through crosses
Last name Spalding Aka I'm Ballin'
Us against the world, fuck them niggas we a problem
So sucky free sucka niggas pay extortion
Hold on video had rocks in my pocket
Linked up with Dza got a plug up that Sour
Hooked up with Styles now I'm good out in Yonkers
Good in any hood I don't need a Co- signer
My girl on that MOLLY me I'm on the Chronic
Tra 1st and D-Block , real niggas mobbin'
Bet somebody hamma round this bitch got a body
Went from no bottles into bein' a role model

[Verse 3: Smoke Dza]

Righhht

Hit my nigga Rout with Dour
I been that niggas since niggas da Eddie Bauer
A couple days I ran through a 1/4 pounder
Now I'm rolling up some Harlem shake no Baauer
Smell a stench that will wake the whole crowd up
Smokers Club client Founder
Run around Harlem on some Mayor shit
Nigga prob let the AR spit
On the block he do the Grave Yard shift
Stay on it like clock work
We don't prolong we pop first
Put him out like he pops perks
Shout out to my dogs
Three way call from behind the wall
My little homies straped like we goin’ to war
Like fuck it mystery goin’ to get me out in the morn'
Come out with Packs like crack of dawn
Save your profit nigga weather the storm keep hustlin
DZA...[Verse 1: Styles P]
Hell yea I'm pullin' my thang out, you gettin' banged out
Bitch nigga, you shit done came out
Kick it with a 914 nigga, four niggas beefin'
Guess what? my 914 niggas
I warn niggas like whoever will come through
My shit stay kicking so I'm calling it kung fu
Master my own style, punk show 'em what gun do
I'm lethal like a heroin bundle, yea
The beat rocks from Pete Rock, the flow from the ghost from D-Block
Four pounds send you to Esau, in other words Jesus Christ
Man, my shit stick together like beans and rice
All I need is weed at nights to smoke and rhyme
And I'm probably the nicest nigga to breathe in light
And can't nobody prove me wrong, I'm to strong
And the motherfuckin' street niggas need me right

[Hook: Pete Rock]
Ayo fuck what you heard and what you thought you saw
Been all over the world reppin' 914
Styles P and Sheek Louch, they wild fo' sure
Been all over the world reppin' 9-1-4

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Raised in the ghetto singing songs for survival
Late night, Valhalla, rollin' out the bible
914, every corner store got a nigga with the raw
Just bring your straw
Piff by the O’s, pussy galore
Little thief bitches get the monkeys out the store
Shit look real but a nigga ain’t sure, yo
You know a real nigga when you see him
Jewelry dripping, white tee, you wanna be him
Burner on him and don’t care about freedom
Bitches with him, other girls wanna' beat him
I’m trynna' stay alive, what up Mount Vernon?
Rest in peace two-five, Pete with the knot
Who else to ask for but Sheek from D-Block
Two guns down, calico up
I’m done here, pass my cup

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Nigga I get fresh like Easter
Who wanna get sliced like pizza, while I light my reefer?
You could come through with your crew nigga
Burner go through niggas
One shot is knockin’ off two niggas
I might come through with the Uzi, shoot niggas
Filmin' on Fuji, put the shit in a movie
Who wanna' get burned with a loose?
Black tie affair, I grown up
You get stomped with the Gucci’s
You oughta' be playin’ me two feet
I don’t need five, I gotta' knife you ain’t leavin' alive
I said the green and cream Beamer is mine, the Z8
I see hate, you get the three-eight right in your eye
Yo Pete, play this shit for the street
Niggas licking they heat, got a brick in the whip on the seat
Them niggas no different than me, so they listen to me
I understand all the shit that they see, what

[Hook] (x2)[Styles talking]
Yes, pay full attention
This is for gangstas, this is for gentlemen
There's two kind of people out there
I happen to be the boss type
I'm a product of my environment
Blame the streets, I am what they made me

[Styles - Verse One]
My pops came from Bed-Stuy, my mom came from Africa
I'm all nigga if you know what I mean
They hooked up in the '70's when liquor and weed was heavy
And had me in Corona, Queens
By the time I was seven my mom left my pop
Then we moved to the south side of Yonkers, New York
Then my mom remarried, had my little brother Gary
My sister a year later, let me gather my thoughts
By the time I was nine I was outta my mind
My step pops didn't like me beat me outta my mind
Ten and eleven the same I never would change
He still had to hit me, aggravate a little nigga
Still wearin' Skippys
Golf hats, Adidas and Pumas, I could a had a pair
My mommy said wait 'til Christmas but I needed 'em sooner
If you heard I was broke dawg it wasn't a rumor

[Hook (repeat 2x) - Styles]
I said Gangstas ride (Ride with me)
Gentlemen live your life (Live it up)
Cause Gangstas die (We all gon die)
It's only a matter of time (The clock tickin)

[Styles - Verse Two]
It was 1986 and I was twelve years old
That's right around the time when crack came out
It was the best thing that happened to me
I swear to God cause I was gettin everything that I was askin about
First we started off baggin up, me and golf
Then shit start addin up, we gettin smart
Now we on Broadway, coppin our own base
Bring it home and put it in bottles, send us a rottle
Drink an OE and scramble like it wasn't tomorrow
I'm gettin kicked out of Junior High, thinkin I'm grown
God bust with the yellow rabbit
And I had every color dealt we was gettin it on
I was out robbin Mexicans six in the morn'
Mom said I'd had to ep again, rip it I'm gone
Nigga get a little loony and grown, soup in the dome
Fuck me up worst when I went to the group home

[Hook (repeat 2x) - Styles]
I said Gangstas ride (Ride with me)
Gentlemen live your life (Live it up)
Cause Gangstas die (We all gon die)
It's only a matter of time (The clock tickin)

[Styles - Verse Three]
I'm leavin out a lotta shit, nigga it's too real
My alcoholic backround, the welfare motels
Abuse that I had to take struggle at my mom's recruit
How the fuck I'm gon bomb wit you
And the cases I got up to date told you that I bust a eight
Got niggas I can't name, outta state niggas fuck with weight
Little brother gone but I got a baby angel
You fuckin with a dirty name, don't let these niggas change you
The present's what you get
And the past is what make the man future
I can't tell you I ain't God or lil' Superman
No there ain't a 'S' on my chest, but it's a 'D' on my block (D-Block)
And said life the deepest lesson is death
I'm determined and I'm disciplined and destined to rest
I'm a Gangsta and a Gentleman, Panero the best
When I pass I'm like gas, motherfuckers
Cause I'm a leave a stain that you'll never forget

[Hook (repeat 2x) - Styles]
I said Gangstas ride (Ride with me)
Gentlemen live your life (Live it up)
Cause Gangstas die (We all gon die)
It's only a matter of time (The clock tickin)

[Styles talking in car]
This gangsta and this gentleman shit, is about being humble
But at the same time, let niggas know what's real
And when I say you real, I could flip
But at the same time, I could talk to a nigga at the same time
If he don't respect that, then you gotta show 'em you're gangsta
He respect that you show 'em you're gentleman
Cause you respect him as a man
That's what a gangsta and a gentleman is about[Hook: Curren$y]

Never stop, 'til we pick up loot on every block
The roof on the crib got that helicop
Coupe move with new shoes and socks
Not to mention the masterpiece watch
Not to mention the chain or the diamond rings
Material things, wasteful, I know
But I just use it as a way to keep scope

[Verse 1: Curren$y]

Shit bigger than a 6 plus, this is us
The crew who you hide your bitches from
Jet Life homie, you trying to get rich or what?
Closed this deal in a restaurant, power lunch
I had the veal with the parmesan
Bed of angel hair pasta it was resting on
Two mimosa’s, a to-go cup with Coca-Cola
Now I'm smokin', rollin', gas in my motor, sippin' my soda
We use the Pro Tools to break down boulders
My girl pull her own weight, with her sexy lil shoulders
In the strapless Vera Wang, Alexander or whoever made it
I just know she paid it, it cost me Nathan
Sexy, cool, crazy
My baby like one of them hot 70’s ladies
Under disco lights with her hips swaying
To the music playin'
While I'm making major moves with the boss playas
Win or lose I was there, beginning to end
I paid dues so I'm included and you never knew it
Until you saw we did it you was still tryna do it
Lookin' at us lookin' like stars, and we lookin' at you stupid
Sucks to be you kid
Drugs
In the music

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Boss playa I'll ask what it cost later
Throw it in the cut like fuck it I’ll floss later
In the mix like a cross fader
No DJ, givin' em' no leeway
We be everywhere from the mansion to the PJ's
Crown on the wrist, pound of the piff
Get around in the 6, ask in town I'm the shit
But who’s the niggas I’m shittin' on?
Come to money, you gettin' off or gettin' on?
You see that fly shit Spitta on
You see that fly shit Ghost on
The money and the weed, the guns and the Nikes
In the cars with the ice just might form Voltron
Or should I transform on 'em, they was goin ham on 'em
I was blowin' grams on 'em
They was showin' swag
I was blowin' bags full of strains that niggas didn't ever know they had
It's Jet Life, I except life
It’s knot life until you come through livin' block life
Carbon fiber stock pipes
I’m talkin' marble on the kitchen counter
You gon' smell like reserve if you sit around us
Should I keep goin' or quiet up?
If you got fire, then fire it up

[Hook][Intro]x2
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches


[Verse 1: Styles P]
I got a couple of niggas that’ll drop yo body
Ridin in Ferraris and Maseratis
Suits in Dubai and Abu Dabi
Catch em at the juice bar guzzling baji
They can chef it up like Emeril Lagasse
A game when daddy can’t play them posse
Martini and Rossi, asti spumante
You doin the science, I’m a giant just like Andre
Talk about washin the money like it was laundry
Probably smoking a blunt, sippin upon a Don P
Now all these whack rappers is beyond me
And the fact they think they nice; that alarms me
But like alchemist I smoke calmly
The army couldn’t harm me
Kill yourself before you ever think to bomb me
Yea boss of the boss, nigga Don P

[Hook]
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
-I got upmost respect everywhere I go
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
-I got love from my fans when they hear my flow, yo!
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
-I get saluted by the people when I’m on my block
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
-I ain’t got it all but I’m good with all I got

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I got some wild Albanians that come through the block
In some slippers and a jumpsuit and lift off yo top
All maple on the shifter,Armagnac up in the snifter
Catch me in the 5 with the Shiksa
Leather vest with the patches all embroided
I tuck Jackie with the soy milk
Mad ginger before I rap, bunch of joints like a bat rack
You warm pussy and it’s time to take a cat nap
Smoke the catnip, fiends rip the plastic
Hookers getting bread, no G waste band elastic
Talkin business in the bath house
Hilfiger hats rockin stack house
The crib look like Shaq house
Uh, sharp foot like i'm John Bones Jones, kid
Tomahawke chop, red bone in
Grab yo bitch, lay nuts on the ho chin
Only thing for me to do is go in

[Hook]
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
I got upmost respect everywhere I go
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
I got love from my fans when they hear my flow, yo!
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
I get saluted by the people when I’m on my block
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
I ain’t got it all but I’m good with all I got

[Verse 3: Styles P]
I got a couple of niggas that’ll smoke yo boots
Ridin on a train, know they flew in the hoop
Probably in the projects or most of the stoops
You can see em in the juice bar gulping the juice
Motherfuckers will shoot like they playin for doop
Deuces wild get the bricks, throw em off of the roof
Crack pack and yo sneakers are boots
With a gun on yo waist
Keep it movin when police in pursuit
I’m out here in the Jeep ball coupe
About that life
If you ain’t, I ain’t speakin to you
About that mic, SP a beast in the booth
Like I’m indian, I’m the fuckin chief in the booth
Know the difference between a sheep and a wolf
Trade deuce dues dues
You don’t wanna talk shit to a bull
Get yo higher than the first blunt, head in the pool
If your automatics are semi, get a full wuddup?

[Hook]
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably

Pain...

[Verse 1]
All I know is pain, all I seen is death
Couple homies and brother gone, when I'm gon' step
I ain't suicidal, damn, my brain need rest
Think about my childhood, pain in my chest
Past is the past, future ain't great
All right in the hood, when any day could be my last
Pop something back, they wanna sue me for my math
Hawk some back, they wanna sue me for my math
Hard bein a gangsta rapper, you don't know the half
You ain't got to condone it but you was never homeless
And you ain't never fast, so you don't know the wrath
To taking a long walk, down the wrong path
All I know is pain, everything I did wrong
I did it in vain, that's why I'm tryna change
Live for my seeds but the game ain't change
Only the strong survive, I will maintain

[Hook] (The Alchemist)
All I know is pain, all I get is pain
All I give is pain, all I live is pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
(It's no love, ice cold blood running all through my veins)
All I know is pain, all I get is pain
All I give is pain, all I live is pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
(It's more than rhymes, more shine than the diamonds on your chain)

[Verse 2]
What you know about pain?
Blood, sweat and tears where I'm standing in the rain
If I don't blow Mary Jane, I'm going insane
Before I had a car, I was in the fast lane
Drugdealing stick up kid for the neck game, a lot that I regret
But I made it as a rapper, and it's not what I expect
For a fact, this business is more crooked
The boys'll sell they souls to the devil, the Lord looking
See in you hell just in case that we all cooking
I got sins too, lot of foul shit that I been through
The world is God house, I'm just a window pane
Tryna maintain up to the end, yo

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All I know is pain, I feel so drained
Rap niggas is insane, they on Procaine
What they call hot, I would call so lame
They don't care about the art, and they show no shame
If you ain't getting spins, then you ain't gon' win
But if you came from the bottom, you should stay going in
The Ghost don't make it then the Phantom gon' win
I'ma make the kids richer, make grandma grin

[Hook]Verse 1
[Styles P]

I’m in the streets where the soldiers stay
You can talk about getting fresh with people where they close for days
You can roll in a nice whip, we be rolling haze
Maintained in the game, and I’m so amazed
Only Jews that we got was advice
From the brothers that been through it
But I can ask my mother she’s been through it
Back home in Africa where the struggle is real
I can say my blood line is spectacular
But it’s a sin and I don’t know my kin
I’m a ghost don’t know my beginning know my end
Yo Konvict calm my soul pray that I live
& I hope the lord forgive me for all of my sins

Chorus
[Akon]

Saw my life I could fight like a solider
Hustling was another mode a
That I can use to survive
Even though they said it ain’t right
So tell me where were you when those nights got colder
The day I thought that it was all over
As you can see I survived
Made the best of my life...

Verse 2
[Styles P]

I’m a man so I shed tears
For my homies in the jail and my dead peers
Lot of blood dropped the police the red years
Don’t show, cold sores, so the feds here
A lot of gangsters in my town like the Greb there
Outside all night cause it’s red there
Want to beef, forget invest, get headgear
This is the town where you get down
And drown nobody tread here
I swear to god that I’m telling the truth
Was a felon when I fell in the booth
They want me to feel
Like I was feeling I was scared of the truth
Yo Kon turn me up so I can give them the proof

Chorus

Verse 3
[Styles P]

I said I’m man enough to cry
I ought to let you know that I ‘m man enough to die
War for the cause when I do
21 salute, can into the sky
Have it for the drought when the grams gon’ get high
My friends are saying your man gon’ get high
Slide in the five just to gon’ get a buy
Sixth gear, 200 trying to die on the ride
Now I can outlaw, still arise, trunk full of pies

Chorus 2x[Intro: Styles P]
Hahahahaha
Ruff Ryder 3
Time for the younger generation to blow
You know I brought my nigga with me..
D-Block

[Verse 1: Jae Hood]
Aiyyo, it's Jae Hood, bitch, respect my bars
The doctors have to piece together your face like a collage
Niggas always talk greasy till the steel come out
And slugs rip through they gums and their grill come out
Motherfuck you and fuck your mans
If I don't clap you in the dome
I'mma leave clips in your diaphragm
I'm the hood prophet, puff purple instead of chocolate
Stay from around chumps and cowards cause they gossip
And I'mma stay on the corner like stop signs
With a pack of them creamy colored rocks and the Glock 9
When you speaking of the hardest, nigga
Bring Hood name up (Jae Hood)
D-Block bitch -- we about to have the game chained up
My words too strong, bars too powerful
And your towel can't dry you when them dumdums shower you
Y'all mad cuz y'all garbage and your lyrics is boring
And your whip was made the same year that you was born in

[Verse 2: Shiz Lansky]
Listen man; don't worry bout how many gats this crook has.. (that's right)
Just know I stay strapped like book bags
Bitch is shook ass
You just getting off your porch
And me? I'm just getting off in court
I could make sure your coffin bought
Why would you mention a burner?
It's a difference between rappin and attempting a murder
Talking the shit you living and the shit you heard of
You said fuck Larsiny?
What is you crazy, bitch?
Before you walk the streets, here's a few safety tips
Watch who you speaking bout, and watch who you speakin to
The cats you speak about'a show you what the heat could do
A respirator is What you'll be breathing through
And you got beef with who that you need toast?
The closest you came to beef, was meatloaf
When we post, with bats and P-coats
Y'all niggas better be ghost

[Verse 3: Keema]
Yo, to fuck with Keem, y'all bitches better hope and dream
Every gun that I own got a scope and beam
When I a-pproach the scene, shake dice, rope ya team
Best bitch on the East coast since Queen
Latifah, buy reefer, fly diva
Ride deeper, four-pound thump louder than five speakers
Spit fire, hot lava flow
Don't get twisted, not one of them Prada hoes
Catch me in Escada clothes, with a lot of dough
That's not mines -- it's his..
I need a lot more to live
You gotta give to Keem before your kids
How you think a bitch like me afford to live motherfucker?

[Interlude: Styles P]
Hahahahahaha
That's a bad bitch.. Shiz you a bad ass nigga
It's the younger generation..Killing y'all...
Lott... Get busy on these niggas

[Verse 4: Lotto]
Hey look, I'm trying to stack mad gravy
So I get birds from my crew, and make Erykah Badu my "Bag Lady"
You that crazy? Squeeze! I know you ain't spittin shells
Your hand shake so much, it shows up on the Richter scale
I made the huskiest niggas look like they had sickle cell..
I don't just sell bricks dog, I got a bitch for sale
So let me find out there's a nigga hatin' Lott
No coffin, he get buried in a refrigerator box
God damn, I'm a hot man
I'm tellin you straight up, I got my weight up
Jacob, call my wrists Roxanne
Cuz if I wore it in a dark room?
You and your man'a hate it, I'mma look animated like a cartoon (bling!)
Bottom line, I'm telling you that you ain't fuckin wit me
Hard, no body guards; you want a shot? Come and get me
I'm not a sucker, nor any nigga runnin wit me
And why y'all ballin on wheels, if they under fifty... nigga?

[Verse 5: Rockstar]
Lockin blocks the motto
Got more slow than Dr. Zhivago
Same mind state that made Capone boss of Chicago
But I don't get my gangster from movies, I'm a Rockstar
5-star teles runnin gangstas on groupies
Come through and leave a boy sick
Cause my F-Type steers with a joystick
I'm the heart in my era
Listen, I lead a artistic life
Paint pictures with my actions, ain't no margin for error
My innate features, leave niggas dismayed speechless
And please don't mistake weakness for kindness
I fuck with old timers
So don't make me forget that you real and catch Alzheimer's
Motherfuckin hoes, never I'll spoil them
I'm known to break a bitch for reckless eyeballin
The top, dog; nigga, I'm the bare truth
You want to get math?
Well, nigga, I'm the square root
The Rockstar

[Verse 6: Cassidy]
I got a mean stash, you seen Cass get his thug on
And strip my bitch; we kiss, and get our hug on
She what I put drugs on to get my grub on
And dog, when you park your car? Put your Club on!
The next cat I put the snub on?
I'm a clap the gat till it get too hot, and that's wit gloves on!
Y'all love drawin, y'all should go to a art school
I get my club on with the glow-in-the-dark jewels
Trees on my shoes, Polo and the dark blues
And I spark tools that the po and the narcs use
Fuck, is y'all stupid or somethin?
What's the point in, pullin out your joint if you ain't shootin at nothin?
Dude, frontin get you banged in the face.. (sure do)
And if you have braces, then you know how the banger'a taste
I'm wit anything pertainin to cake
And I just copped the blue Lottman
With the rectangular face... Easy

[Interlude: Styles P]
Easy niggas.. matter of fact... fuck that, go hard..
Cass', show these niggas how you built..
Grab your guns, bust off.. my nigga

[Verse 7: Cassidy]
Yeah it's Cassidy bitch, get the name clear
I'm what you lames fear, got the game scared (uh-huh)
I buy 'caine by the square, but sell it by the O
I run through snow like a reindeer
The coke heads nose red like Rudolph (true)
I grind on the strip so hard, I got blue balls
I'd rather knock a Q off, then get blew off (true)
That's how I stay on my toes like my shoes off
You dudes soft, really bitches like RuPaul
When's it's war, I move out like U-Hauls
I'm a true boss..
I send 8 balls to the corner
My strip like a pool hall (ya heard dat)
And I ball like I been in the sport
My trigger finger itchin like it got genital warts
Don't play around wit him, boy (why's that?)
Cause Cass is a pain in the ass like hemorrhoids
Faggot!

[Outro: Styles P]
Yeah yeah... it don't stop
This is R3, young generation
Showin y'all cocksuckers what it's about
When y'all get some young boys come talk to me
We could do it any time any place; you know our style
Get ready for R4, cuz we never stop, we still in the studio
We in the studio right now
Far as Holiday Styles goes, the Ghost, S.P., Paniro
Well, you know... I'll be out soon
A Gangster & A Gentleman, at a store near you
Cocksucker
If you find somebody who could do it better
Introduce me to him so I can shake his hand
Cuz you know, that's a gentleman thing to do
Then I'mma flip to the gangster and shoot him in the head
Cuz that's just my style
You know... my shit'a be the hardest shit on the planet
As a matter fact, followin this
So, I suggest y'all stay tuned to Ruff Ryders cuz we will not stop
There's a lot of cocksuckers in this industry and game but..
There's a lot of cocksuckers outside in the street, too
If you on the street... Don't Snitch[Intro: sample]
"Alone in the street"
"A-alone in the street"
"A-alone in the street"

[Styles P]
You fuckin with my soul right here
All night

I don't really care what I sell or what I sold
As long as I give my soul whenever my story told
I don't know how you roll but I roll, all alone
In the zone knowin damn well my little brother home
Still feel him in the passenger seat
I can't see him and I wish that he can chatter with me
In due time until then, you can say I got more than a few rhymes
Thought I'd be there to see him like more than a few times
Tryin to stay away from beef, but shit is gettin deep
I ain't restin right, it's like I'm on layaway for sleep
I think I shoulda been a author or somethin
Disappear like Hoffa or somethin, came back when they offer me somethin
My word I, got a little crust in my third eye
Headache's why I be meditatin; thoughts is devastatin
Could this be my last life? Maybe my past life?
Is the future when I'm sleep? So what was last night?
I'm goin in deep - and you know the Ghost

[Hook: Styles P]
{"Alone in the street"} One two three four
5 o'clock in the mornin, you know I'm tryin to see more
{"Alone in the street"} All day, all night
All by myself, you know that I'm all right
{"Alone in the street"} Seven eight nine ten eleven
12 PM, you know I'm tryin to get it in
{"Alone in the street"} All day, all night

[Styles P]
Mad live, could learn to bounce out on a bad vibe
Or either keep a gun in your cab ride
Have I thought about my life as a bad guy?
Made a little money sellin rocks that was capsized
Robbed a lot of people like I never was baptized
Yeah I was a very young teen when I took my shahadah
But got right off my deen when I could book the Ramada
Cause I'd rather be a robber or a midnight marauder
There's a part of me that love bein gangster, all of me
I couldn't help but get in the game, the shit was callin me
And I think that I was callin it back
But you can't help but trip when you fall in the trap
If the Lord call, who got the phone for callin him back?
Things are man-made, why don't you tell man to do that?
But he can't, so I'mma stay on the spiritual flack
Cause it's a uphill battle when I'm dealin with that

[Hook]

[Styles P]
Consider this a sermon, start to burnin
Never said you was hard, I ain't give you the permit
I might think you vermin, better yet vomit
Alone in the streets with the gun by the armpit
Can't put a shark with a pawn fish, it's conflict
Sorta like mixin boy scouts with the convicts
Somebody gon' pay if somebody gon' play
Cause the streets cold-hearted on a hot summer day
If you gon' rap please stop, run away
Go home, flush ya crack then, give ya gun away
Cause the rules is written down, in invisible ink
Just consider what the critical think
Don't rat, do your bid in the clink; stand tall lil' boy
Get yourself a shrink if you're feelin you're paranoid
But real talk, fuck jail talk, I know home's sweet
Even locked down in a cage is where your dome be

[Hook] - echoes at the end[Styles]
Kevin Garnett
Da Kid
The player of the present and the future
Ideal player of the 21st century

You call him KG da Kid (KG)
But if you seen him with basketball
You know that he grown (uh huh)
You seen him on the ball courts
You know that he home (right at home)
It's like every dunk is drastic (wooo)
First to get drafted outta high school since Moses Malone (remember that?)
Everybody gotta earn they turn (uh huh)
I think da Kid game got hotter since his jersey burned (phew)
And you couldn't find a finer kid (uh uh)
Than the 7 foot South Carolina kid obsessed with ball (obsessed)
And the rim need a hard net (hard net)
Better act like you know
C'mon dogg, that's Kevin Garnett (KG)
Bout to get an And1 all in your mug (And1)
Said he play around the clock coz there's ball in his blood (in his blood)
He ain't think about a turnover (uh uh)
That's KG, he the player of the future
And the game about to turn over (da Kid)
Think you got game, then you gon' have to learn over (yeah)

(talking)
KG, Kid, Kevin Garnett, And1, Styles P[Intro]
Turn it up (turn it up)
Swizz Beats the monster
(Fix ya face, Ruff Ryders)
LET'S DO IT
(D-Block) E-V-E, Styles P. and Sheek
(Wassup, wassup)
LET'S DO IT

[Verse 1] (Sheek)
Walk wit ya nigga, hawk wit ya nigga
I came to shut it down
Ski mask and four pound
Baby grenades, we deep like baby parades
D-Block I'm gon sharpen ya blades
Let's get it on
Videos with bullets flying through Korn
Blaow! Footage turn ya camcords on
It's the underground nigga with bricks, nigga with dough
A nigga fucking all y'all chicks, you know
I'm a gangster and a gentleman too, P
I'll lay a nigga down and send his moms a bouquet for free
I could start a pet store with these birds
I'm the rap Donald Goines with words
Still rob y'all herbs (And I came to)
Hit the club on my dick, light up a blunt
Thug a bitch out, I got the mud in the front
I got the flight jacket, came with wings
When I chase you to the roof
Clappin' at ya ass with one of them things

(Chorus: Eve & Styles)
I gots to live by my pride
Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
Cause I came to shut down the game

(Sheek)
And I gots to hold down this heat
Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash

[Verse 2] (Eve)
Yo, I was determined to sell
And not because I'm just a bunny with a fluffy tail
Had to prove that I could live hard and spit hard
Just a bonus that I'm cute and get ya dick hard
See, I ain't never lettin' mine go
I'mma be here forever with my dogs as the time go
And I know we makin' niggas sick
We in they face everyday every way and they can't handle it
Streets choosin' Double R realest niggas out no confusion
Cats don't want it over here--have you heard
S.P. ain't for games little boy lesson learned
I suggest you stay far from my nigga's face
Hop back go hard all day in a nigga's face
You see, you cowards ain't a threat to us really
Just figured that we let you know that testin' us is silly
Good luck, y'all---Naw forreal, fuck y'all

(Chorus: Eve & Styles)
I gots to live by my pride
Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
Cause I came to shut down the game

(Sheek)
And I gots to hold down this heat
Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash

[Verse 3] (Styles)
I live by my pride, I could never be broke
I'mma Ruff Ryde or die catch me bein' with dope
Smokin' weed in the hoopty with the three in the coat
Cause my ace boon-koon got a connect
Told me send a hundred bundles to the day room soon
If the shit go right, he know that it will
We'll be cash, he'll be movin' straight weight through June
But back to this rap shit who thug it the most
It'll take the whole coast just to fuck wth the ghost
He done shut down the game, shit on ya name
If you ain't hold down the street or bust off ya heat
Then me and you is different, we ain't get it the same
And I represent niggas who live it, keep askin' for it
And I represent niggas who give it
This a D-Block Ruff Ryder, Holiday Styles
Cock sucker and I don't give a fuck about you

(Chorus: Eve & Styles)
I gots to live by my pride
Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
Cause I came to shut down the game

(Sheek)
And I gots to hold down this heat
Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash[Intro]
Yea Poovs
Tunnel vision on these niggas
Araab, this shit is crack, Duke salute
My eyes on the prize

[Verse 1]
Phantom but not at the opera (Phantom!)
Death of the doctor
Shotty and chopper, he ain't gunning the whole
Give dineros proper (I'm proper!), certified
Hop up in the whip, you willin' to take the murder ride
Rolling with that Ecuadorians, Cubans, coke emporium (hahaha)
Came up, doing G shit real gangsta historian (I'm a gangsta)
On the real my nigga
I never squeal and I never do no sucker shit
Go out on my shell (I go out)
Yea, shoot my brains out, shoot my heart out
Catch me at the juice bar, pourin a little bark out
Catch me on the mic, just give it a little spark out (put out!)
I'm electrified, and you petrified
You niggas buggin me, spray a little pesticide
I take face shots, you could put the vest aside(put it away!)
No need for em bloody, you gon bleed for em (you gon bleed for em!)
You gon be the one to hold his dick when you pee for him (yeup)
Cuz he paralyzed, look at the barrel size (look at it!)
And I ain't buyin that gangsta shit you advertise (I ain't buyin it)
You a fixable problem
Kill him in Yonkers and dump the body in Harlem (Oohh)
I’m despicable, with a hawk and revolver
Ask the shooter or a carver if the ghost, is the hardest (Ghost!)
The answer's always yes (always)
So you could fuck around, cause it's always death, waddup?

Yea, should be a hook lemme just pop a little shit right here though
You niggas is nowhere near ready
I can't even figure me out

[Verse 2]
Every rapper reppin' the set, I know they pussy though
Take my knife, stick it up in 'em, like they a pussy hole (hahaha)
Yea I been a boss, but then my cars all verbal
And a hoopty playin' verbal intercourse (Figure it out)
It's foul thoughts when I'm reeing up
Cause I don't mean the ball court, when I say they D-in up (they D-in up)
I break the laws, fuck the court of law
Penny never seen, with a dime or a quarter so (never seen)
And I’d rather die before a dime or a quarter y'all
But you could get killed for your motherfuckin Audemar (get killed nigga) (get killed nigga)
But I ain't got time for time (nah uh)
Dancing in the shadows of the shadows, no time to shine (you do that)
I take the digits though, you don't get the picture nigga
I'm Samsung, lil' nigga you Vizio
I'm a better show, and a better sound
You don't get the picture for the paper, spread the lead around (patna!)

[Outro]
Fuck everything Poovs
I ain't even wanna sign off, I'm just rappin'[Hook: Masspike Miles]
I put the "b" in "banger"
Used to getting money
Now you know I'm no stranger to the hustle
I'm strapped up like a raider from the tomb
Force with my platoon
I do shit you boys don't do
I'm known in the streets as a nigga that done did it
Put infrared beams on your fitted
Trust me, you can get it
Nigga, you can get it
Throw the handle back and watch the motherfucker bang, bang, bang

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Yes
If I'm not the best, nigga, then I got next
Cause I talk that shit like a nigga with hot breath
You niggas not threats, them things'll bang in
Things could change if you never got shot yet
I'm quick to bust, like a man that never got sex
But you don't get the message, like a blind man that got text
I used to love to box, until I shot Tecs
Now I never brawl, like a broad that ain't got breasts
I'm not press, I don't wanna talk
Man, my motherfucking gun'll spark and make a nigga somersault
I'll shoot the damn thing and make a nigga handspring
Or I'll spark steel and make a nigga cartwheel
Matter of fact, clap the gat, turn him to an acrobat
Have the cat flip around before I put the pistol down
Your lame mouth which you better keep my name out
I ain't in a gang, I don't bang, I just banged out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I'm back out riding
Gun at your head, bullet the center like Bonham
Shotgun with the shotgun seat reclining
I pop up on niggas
Let it off, close shop up on niggas
Infection, stay in the cut on niggas
I'm in a whole nother section
I could look in the mirror, my reflection
Moves like Inception
Extraordinary gentleman, what more could I say?
Got the picture in the cut, like Dorian Gray
I'm a shooter like Allan Quartermain, I give you more than pain
First page in the hard nigga Hall of Fame
Duane Darock on the beat
SP the Ghost, I make it pop on the streets
Probably in the spot for a week
One eye open, with the Glock on a sleeve

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chubby Jag]
I let the thing blam, they call me the Rain Man
I'm out of bullets, get 'em hung, nigga, Hang Man
You get me, hang it up; there's problems, I flame it up
Bang it up, snap back, long t, banger tucked
Yup, my block pitching, yeah I got pigeons
I'm into cooking, I fuck with bitches that got kitchens
If I can't find Jordan, then I'll rob Pippen
I leave 'em bloody and skin red, like Rob Griffin
Home real spit, the shotty blast, you gon' see the body bags
Men in black, no Will Smith
Real shit, used to grind and we still grind
Beefing with the grill time, full metal, steel time
Niggas getting stole on trying to steal mine
Cock pack, peel mine
Tape 'em up, real time
Jump you, the mask on and Berettas bang
Sound clear, holmes? Out here, we gonna let it bang

[Hook][Intro]
S.P. this where it started at, on the microphone?
Rip a nigga, make him scream
(Yeah Poobs, let's get him nigga)

[Styles P]
Beats to the rhyme, street full of crime
Rap or the gat I got heat for your mind
Beats what a nigga got asleep on your spine
On the creep and the grind, rap the work or double up
Hit you with a scar on your cheek, watch it bubble up
Man pull the Hummer up, shoot any runner-up
Real cool niggas but we might fuck the summer up
Niggas wonder what I'm involved in
See me all alone when I'm runnin in Harlem
Bronx and Queens, fuck that I live life like I'm starving
You don't like me, fuck you nigga!
I don't trust you, I cut you or bust you nigga
I shoot up where you hustle nigga, fuck the program up
Rob all your workers, cut yo' grams up
You dealin with big niggas or pig niggas
P don't give a fuck when it's time to jig niggas
(I don't give a fuck) You dig? Niggas big
Run up in the crib and wig niggas and I don't mean fake hair
You can bet that I'm goin, they said that there's cake there
Might as well get them candles out; we ain't makin a wish
We sayin a prayer cause I blammed you out - what?
Guess who back? It's P with the P-91
38 Specials, the extra gat
In the souped up Mirada nigga, extra black - what?

You know
You know who I am
I'm that nigga! (Ghost)
Poobs we outI used to dream I would make it big
Told niggas I do when is done they would say I did
Lots niggas do it but they ain't do it the way I did
Its a cold world when your close friend they spray the crib
If you waiting on weight then you know what waiting is
Unless you waiting on freedom then you know what patience is
I pour the liquor then I roll it up
Seen alotta signs in my life but I ain't throw em up
Is cash that im trying to generate
If you ever been in a jungle you know my mental state
Cry when my homies done die but are my eyes rinse
Seen alot of dirt with these eyes here come the sirens
Is g code from them kilos
Be straight up with them niggas that put you below
I said the wolves might hurt you
Even when im all by myself im with a circle
Youll see when I spin around
I ain't just talkin boy I been around
Smell when the summer come could hear when the wind around
Seen when the spring comin pop when them things come
I ain't speak on fall cuz I won't mention it at all
If you dont know the rules then I won't tell you to ball
Ill let you know that the ghost back
Now to make you lean like you just hit the dope sack[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Chrome thing on me, chrome on the Lotus
I don't trust a motherfucking soul, and you know this
Cause all these niggas be having is ulterior motives
It be the ones closest to you that hit you the lowest
That's why you gotta watch niggas like B.E.T
Little stupid niggas, they ain't got their G.E.D
But they'll do anything for a fee
And damn near anything for a key
Yeah, so I keep em in my rearview
You acting like you ready to die

[Styles P]
Be prepared to

[Jadakiss]
They gonna think you had a deal with Nike, I'm air you
Coming through, knocking that Black Rob

[Styles P]
I dare you, yeah

[Jadakiss]
I'll send flowers to your wake

[Styles P]
I'll park a hundred and six bullets in your face

[Jadakiss]
I got a bunch of Rocsi's and Frees with me
I even gotta watch the niggas that be with me

[Hook: Fabolous]
Gotta watch niggas, B.E.T
You gotta watch niggas, B.E.T
Friends at a distance, enemies close
Sometimes the ones you call friends be who envy the most

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You gotta watch niggas, B.E.T
You keep your gun every day, I got my G.E.D
Everything's believable, anything's possible
Don't take it from me, ask the niggas in the hospital
You holding up your right hand on the stand
And then you put your right hand in the can
Friends like that, who needs enemies?
I'm fucking successful, it do breed enemies
Talking all that fly shit lead to gunplay
Tear your ass apart, rip the runway
I ain't with none of the sucker shit that they be with
Want you to pick em up all the time, that's baby shit
That's why when I breeze past, I'm with a broad
That reminds you of Free's ass at the Awards
My advice? Get your money, don't let it change you
And don't trust shit -- even the devil was an angel

[Hook][Intro: Styles P]
BET get your recorders
You rockin' with the Ghost, Papoose and Lupe the skateboarder
Welcome to the Cipher, the beginnin' of rap
Before record deals, first I'm gonna toss it to Pap

[Verse 1: Papoose]
Over one hundred soldiers died this month, I drop info
Out of a hundred, the majority was negroes
George Bush is on a roll like a round hero
They still findin' human remains at Ground Zero
They found 'em in the sewers, yeah it shows
Aww man yo, I guess that's why they call it a manhole
When we say B.E.T we ain't tryna spell bet
Black Entertainment, Papoose is the best
Nacirema wait 'till my album drop
He hop up I clap him in his hip, you can call it hip-hop
Rappers be actin' like they tougher then they really is
So I sit 'em in wheelchairs like Jada Pinkett kids
You was puttin' your sneakers on the wrong feet when Papoose was reppin' for the streets
Might as well face your defeat, look patna
I'll have you lookin at defeat like a foot doctor
That's right

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
They say the game has the belly of a beast
Blunts for fingers and hollow tips for teeth
Wire taps for ears Nike Airs for feet
Blasphemy for prayers the system for a heart
Rap music for beats heroin for the son and he's married to the streets
Crack pipes for lungs, and he never sleeps just spies with dice in his eyes
Love life cause he like when it dies
With baking soda soul he cough up pleasure
Clothes made out of dollar bills that he sewed together, he knows he's clever
Jail is his house, all the liquor that pours out and goes right in his mouth
Rides around on a stray bullet
With prostitute, pimp, dope dealers and killers tied to it to pull it
TV in his head, strippers slide down his legs
And he known to ride around with the Feds
He's out there [x4]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Don't call me Ghost no more call me The Phantom
Real brothers love him, street brothers understand him
This is to the man with his hand on his Cannon
Right at this moment I know we need an atonement
The Malcolm is dead, the Martin is dead
The guns, the barber, let me know who want a part in their head
And I am back to the clip fill to the top
I'll grill with a bop, police comin' through kids steal a rock
I don't give an F cause I wanna die cause I am gonna die
You to figure, don't boo who figure
Want to the play the game find out who's who figure
After you do that, find out who's true figure
Lots of brothers died over BS, nonsense
School of hard-knocks, no parent teacher conference
Got to learn the rules real fast, move fast
Stand up and mash shortie, cause they know that you ass

[Papoose]
Yeah that's hip-hop

[Styles P]
Before there was radio, before there were videos, before there were magazines
Put the camera down this what it was

[Papoose]
The cipher three hundred sixty degrees, the cipher
Show you cats how to rhyme man, take that [x2][Refrain: Phonte]
I say open the door, let me in
Teach us all, preach ya sins
Turn the cheek, let it slide
Give me five on the black hand side
The black hand side, oh
Oh, oh the black hand side
The black hand side, oh

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Give me five on the black hand side
I’ll tell you what I see through the black men’s eyes
Fly chick, in the Cadillac a black man rides
But every different day a different black man dies
Shawty momma tripping off a crack, mad high
Now you’re watching TV, loving the bad guys
Piss-poor with the Welfare check, you know we’re African
Cause we ain't get help here yet, no help
Now he puts down his knapscak, Got a crack pack
You don’t overstand if your vision ain’t abstract
Me and the projects, a lot of us is lab rats
Voted for Obama, hoping he wouldn't have that; don't have that brotha
Now I can tell you that I felt that, I felt it
I still remember how the cell smells
I still remember how the pigs at
Family crime up on the B.I. couldn't dig that
Open the door and teach your soul
Passin' the blunt around, and hoping to reach his soul
Now give me five on the black hand side
Ghost to Pharoahe Monch watch the black man ride

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Pharoahe's a Navajo chief, the way I'm making it rain
But never for a stripper with emotional pain
You wouldn't despite system nourishment for the brain
Cause rain plus soil equal fruits and grains
My hood told a nigga: keep it simple and plain
Let me explain the game, break it down a couple levels like Tetris
These young'ns kill they own blood for a necklace
Leave slumped over the wheel of your Lexus
Smoke kush, wake up and eat breakfast
What the fuck he expect
A generation overly obsessed with mobsters
Our revolutionaries won Grammys and Oscars
Impostors, fake auras and weak chakras
Makin' a mockery of the music to be pop stars
And they say I'm insane because I see the remains of the whips and chains
In my hood where it ain't all good
Peep the pain of a single mother, she struggling
Young child slain
Give me five on the black hand side
Let’s maintain like it’s Soul Train keep and move it together
I’m saying

[Refrain][Skit from 'Planet Of The Apes']
Beware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death

[Poison Pen]
Yeah! Immortal Technique! SP the Ghost! Poison Pen! Vinnie Paz!

We gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, call your number out, send your uncle ??? out
We gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, nigga ain’t nothing civilized about no uncle ??? nigga, you feel me? Don’t bring no uncle ??? out nigga, fuck outta here

[Immortal Technique]
All troops in formation? Let the siege commence!

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Back like I was locked up, putting in work
Burning through books like Nazi's in a Catholic church
I'm cursed like Cain when he murdered his brother
Cut your face off and wear it while I'm fucking your mother
I'm Mars Ultor, the avenger, the god of war
And if you don't believe in me, I doubt you believe in God at all
I breathe smokeless fire, the Jinn type
That'll make you hate the way that Allah made you to live life
Like Hindu, niggas that be bleaching their skin white
Other people's teeth in my hands after a fist fight
I was born with a sixth sense and a swift right
Skinned werewolves and rape demons at midnight
Sell your kids into slavery after we murder you
Or sacrifice them in the same fire we burnin' you
Barbarian funeral, nigga, you wanna know?
Damn the river, bury me, and let the water flow

[Hook: Poison Pen]
Chaos, mayhem, bang outs, slay them, uprise, rape them, raid them
Cage em, pandemonium, insurgent, death merchants, commit the best murder
Pillage, Kill them, erase history, make them a mystery

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Cut the nose off, the ears off, the whole head
Immortal and Ghost coming, code red
You never seen a black barbarian
Warrior, warlord, pussy, cut your balls off
More bodies come, more bodies hauled off
What you want the sword and get shit sawed off
Your throat need an axe in it
And I'm breaking your back because your spine needed a crack in it
You bugging me, I'm coming to fumigate
The Wolverine, the Sabretooth, the way that I mutilate
I'm like the viking in Valhalla Rising
Except I got black skin and both of my eyes in
Don't test him, please don't stress him
He'll hang you from a tree with your own intestines
How you wanna die? Make your own suggestion
Now talk to the lord and make your own confession

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
You pussies living in a movie theatre
Put the motherfucking spell on you like brujeria
Chop his motherfucking head like a ruthless leader
Guns drawn in a church service, shoot the preacher
You need to be godly to know Allah
Ain't no rappers eating around me, like a broken jaw
It ain't ever been a day that I ain't broke the law
What you think I hold a motherfucking toaster for?
I ain't going there, there's police in that room
And Vinnie walk around with bags of dust like a vacuum
Bury you under the earth inside a black tomb
My body covered in Dashiki and stab wounds
I'm a guerilla, barbarians is my ancestors
That's a part of my neurological transmitters
We Islamic and brought the story of shem with us (Al hamdu Allah!)
While we brought the motherfucking blam blam with us

[Hook]

[Outro]
The walls have been breached! ANFALL!!!
We came in the name of peace and brotherhood, you wanted us bound in slavery, poisoned our water, changed our names...
Burn their homes, take their jewels, skin them alive!
Hold on, hold on, hold on...
No one will know these people ever existed, and all that will be left is what we build upon their ruins...[Intro: Jadakiss]
Yeah, ride out, they ain't got no money
I'm losin' weight, uh, ride out

[Verse 1: Jadakiss and Styles P]
Gather 'round, y'all, it's goin' down, y'all
Block work, twenty-eight for the pound, y'all
If he the king, I put a round in his crown, y'all
He just talkin', but he pussy in the town, y'all
I air 'em out, then put 'em in the ground, y'all
Hit 'em in the church if he prayin' on my downfall
It's either this or you wicked with a round ball
It's a burial whenever we sound off
Hands to the no-hander right after the round off
Peanut butter guts, chocolate brown Porsche
Word to Spanish, José, we was movin' the most yay
Had my boys runnin' and gunnin', sound like 'Coach K'
Listen, duke, you be shoot, but you know that it's both ways
My gun splash brothers, I call 'em Curry and Klay
In a hurry to get buried ever fuckin' with J
Ah, Dave, come on, nigga, I see you ridin' the wave
Brave like the crackers that helped hire the slaves
Keep talkin', I kill you, then slide in your bae
You got a homie up top, I have him die in a cage
And you trigger-happy, you can't wait to fire the guage
Go out on your shield, though you die in a blaze
Gunfire, one liar, gon' put the truth in a maze
I got the truck off the sour, got a coupe from the haze
In the telly down south, I got me a few dames
We ain't fuckin', but we stuffin' they pussy with cocaine
Whipped out, fuck around and hop on the 2 train
Robbed the first and last car to show you some true pain
Wolf on the phone when I show you a few fangs
It's a different kind of hot, my nigga, it's blue flames
Dudes is startin' to get out of pocket; loose change
Hard part: tryin' to stay still, move things
Right before you about to murder someone, your mood change
We came up like ninety bricks
We had the city under siege since '96
Go online: you still won't find these kicks
Like Frank White when he did the Chinese hit
That's it, it's us, then everybody else after
Our part of the good books a rough chapter
Everything dead serious, enough laughter
Fronto leaves, Raw papers and Dutch Masters, yeah
You read more, you see more
They tearin' shit up on the streets in B'more
Some people don't know what it's like to be poor
The hood is a one-way, ain't no detour
You know the love course, the hate come free, y'all
Those who protect and serve will knock your seed off
The energy is negative, it's not to feed off
Shit'll cool down when we knock the heat off

Get it? R.I.P. Freddie Gray
Rest in peace homie that they shot in the back in South Carolina
Eric Garner, Mike Brown, Glennis, rest in peace, baby girl
And all y'all rappers one
