[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I've got hoes
In different area codes
Hoes! In different area codes

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Now you thought I was just 7-7-0, and 4-0-4?
I'm worldwide, bitch act like y'all don't know
It's the abominable ho man
Globe-trot international post man
Neighbor-dick dope man
7-1-8's, 2-0-2's
I send small cities and states I-O-U's
9-0-1, matter of fact 3-0-5
I'll jump off the G4, we can meet outside
So control your hormones and keep your drawers on
'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bones
3-1-2's, 3-1-3's (oh)
2-1-5's, 8-0-tree's (oh)
Read your horoscope and eat some hors d'oeuvres
10 on pump one; these hoes is self serve
7-5-7, 4-1-0's, my cell phone just overloads

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ludacris]
Now every day is a ho-ly day, so stop the violence and put the 4-4 away
Skeet, shoot a ho today
5-0-4, 9-7-2's
7-1-tree, whatcha gon' do?
You checking out the scene, I'm checking a ho tonight
With perpendicular, vehicular ho-micide
3-1-4, 2-0-1 (hey)
Too much green, too much fun (hey)
I bang cock in Bangkok
Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot, think not
I'm the Thrilla in Manila, schlong in Hong Kong
Pimp 'em like Bishop, Magic, Don Juan
Man after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the motherfuckin' phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big ass sack
I'm slanging this dick like a New Jack

[Nate Dogg]
Is it cause they like my gangsta walk?
Is it cause they like my gangsta talk?
Is it cause they like my handsome face?
Is it cause they like my gangsta ways?
Whatever it is, they love it and they just won't let me be
I handles my biz, don't rush me, just relax and let me be free
Whenever I call (I call), come running
2-1-2 or 2-1-3
You know that I ball (I ball), stop fronting
Or I'll call my substitute freak (hoes)

[Hook]

[Outro - Ludacris]
9-1-6, 4-1-5, 7-0-4
Shout out to the 2-0-6
Everybody in the 8-0-8
Ha-ah, 2-1-6, 7-0-2, 4-1-4
3-1-7, 2-1-4's and the 2-8-1's
3-3-4, 2-0-5, I see ya
Uh-uh, 3-1-8, 6-0-1's, 2-0-tree
8-0-4, 4-0-2, 3-0-1
9-0-4, 4-0-7, 8-5-0
7-0-8, 5-0-2
Hoes in different area codes, know that
Southern Hoes-pitality, Northern Exhoes-ure
Ha-ha, ho ridin' on the West coast
Ya understand what I'm saying?
Ho-cus pocus, you the dopest
Hoes to the right, hoes to the left, 5 hoes this time
Whoo! Ho no!
The Hip-hop ho-ller-coaster, that's what we on right now
Ha-ha, no need to get all ho-stile
Def Jam South baby, Disturbing Tha Peace
Jazze Pheezy, Uncle Face
Ludacris, uh, hoes...(*whistling*) I'm sweating like a motherf[Verse 1: T.I.]
My cup runneth over with pinot grigio, hold up
You bogus in the lambo if you ain't lifting the door up
You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up
For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Ay, nevermind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say
My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot
Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it
Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet?
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude
Where you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parley with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die
But find a nigga with more hustle than me I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemar
It's my time to shine so fuck ya'll

[Hook: Stacy Barthe]
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to (2x)
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker
I guess that's why I don't trust a motherfucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother
Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her
I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over
It's nothing, you numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fuck it, justify your action with stacking your dough up
You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up
Switch the flow up, cause these niggas be snitchin' so much
I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee, and donut
Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100
Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50
Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Andr√© 3000]
What it ain't, What it is? Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche
Feeling like I'm going off a course
Cut these fuck niggas off
Negative in my life, scream that till I'm hoarse
Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles, bitch he ain't really got a choice
I'm living my life live yours
I don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the world come to me
Talk to me sideways nigga that's your ass
Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma
Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner
And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours
I hated all the attention so I ran from it
Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that's how it is
Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again
'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost
That's dopamine, I mean dope, I mean you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault
Too much pressure, I peel off, I'm sorry
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do
Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance
There's this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good
It's boring? Boring? Really?

Well I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe and
Told so many lies, don't know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said
She said, "Lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up"
A lovely distraction but my mind don't wanna rest
But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes
"Ooooh, you so fucking fine"
I woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind

Ooooh, who pulls your ponytail
Who knows your body well huh?

[Outro: Stacy Barthe]
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?[Intro: Jazzy Pha & The Notorious B.I.G.]
The Biggie Duets! (Uhh!)
Jazzy Fizzle, Jagged Edge (Biggie Smalls)
Ladies and gentlemen!

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
I go on and on and on and
Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "But I don't usually"
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked - it all work

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Gotta love my lil' nasty girl
Know I love my lil' nasty girl
I love my lil' nasty girl
All the ladies if you feel me grab your titties for B-I-G

All my women from around the world

All the ladies if you feel me grab your titties for B-I-G

[Verse 2: Diddy]
You know I like nasty girls...
I need you to dance, I need you to strip
I need you to shake your lil' ass and hips
I need you to grind like you workin' for tips
And gimme what I need while we listen to Prince
Cause miss you ain't seen the world yet, rocked La Perla yet
Rocked them pearl sets, flew in a pearl jet
My style make a low profile girl smile
Blow a chick back like I blow through a trial (take that)
And now you and me can drink some Hennessy
Then we get it on
Made women wantin' to bone Sean Combs, sippin' on Patron
Speedin' be leanin' got 'em fiendin'
Then when I did it to you throw it right back (right back)
And tell me "Yeah Diddy I like it like that" (like that)
Lift your shirt, you know how I flirt
Heels & skirt let's take it off now let's work (LETS WORK!)

[Hook: Jagged Edge]

[Jagged Edge]
J & B-I-G (what! what!)
Got the keys from Diddy (uh! uh!)

[Verse 4: Nelly]
Okay ma, what's ya preference
Nice and slow or fast and reckless
Pull your hail girl, bite cha necklace!
Lemme show you what a nigga from the Lou' is blessed with (hey!)

I'm like the radical one

Either way mama I'mma make you do what it do

LET'S GO! LET'S GO! LET'S GO![2Pac] I don't know why I be fuckin witchu

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin, what am I tryin for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby, and there you go

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Baby there you go, actin like a ho
There you there you go, actin like a ho
Baby there you go, actin like a ho
Actin like a ho, actin like a ho
HOE! See the word on the streets you're a
HOE! Just a groupie on a world tour
HOE! Now I found out for myself you're a
HOE! Girl you need to check yourself

[Verse Two: Kastro]
These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
I got hoes that got more, hoes than me
So how I look, gettin hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin too much
When she be dyin to fuck me you be buyin her stuff, ho

[Verse Three: Kadafi]
See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin clown after clown, town coast to coast - see
I been tryin to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin like H20 it ain't nuthin for me to say
Why you keep actin like a ho? But there you go

[Hook]

[Verse Four: Young Noble]
Uhh, when I first met her I told her I was busy all the time
Now she, callin me flippin like she miss me all the time
How she, don't even trip she got a man at home
You need to stop chasin dick bitch and raise your son
I'm like - damn, we can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time
Girl you're thirsty; and stop callin while I'm workin you hurtin me
All this bullshit is irkin me girl, but there you go

[Verse Five: Big Syke - last few words of each line repeat]
I blame it on yo' momma, she need to holla at you
But should I blame it on yo' daddy for all the things that you do
Cause there you go, just like a ho, caught in the streets
Like givin yo' number out to every nigga you meet
I'm tired of the games you playin, so stop playin (ho)
You hear what I'm sayin, you only good for parlayin
I'm layin down the rules, this a game that you lose
So the streets can have you baby cause I stay on the move
(There you goooo)

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Outro: 2Pac]
There you go baby girl, THAT'S the story
There you MOTHERFUCKIN go
I coulda SWORE you told me you was gon' change
And you don't wanna go to clubs no more and
You wasn't fin' to dress all crazy no more and
You was gon' stay home and try to chill
What happened baby?
Ohh, so yo' FRIEND wanted to go out
That wasn't you that went out
You was just goin out cause yo' friend was
Okay, so you was pissy drunk up in that nigga car
Cause yo' FRIEND wanted to get drunk huh?
It's all good, cause there you go baby
Oh I ain't trippin on them niggas callin the house
It's all good, cause there you go
Me I'mma still be a player, all day baby
So uhh, there you go

Ladies and GENTLEMEN!
Jazze Pha, Field Mob, Ciara
Superstar DJ's, here we go

[Hook - Ciara]
They say - "He do a little this, he do a little that
He always in trouble," and I heard
"He's nuttin but a pimp, he's done a lot of chicks
He's always in the club," and they say
"He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips
He's sellin them drugs," and I heard
"He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nuttin' but a thug"
So whaaaaaaaaat, so whaaaaaat
So whaaaaaat, so whaaaaat

[Smoke]
And they say - I'm a slut, I'm a ho, I'm a freak
I got a different girl everyday of the week
You too smart you'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me
They say that I'm THIS, they say that I'm THAT
But all of it's fiction, none of it's fact!
But you don't be hearin it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
If they fake we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her, misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes - They're
Nuttin' but liars hatin, and I bet
They wouldn't mind tradin pla-ces
With you by my side in my Mercedes

[Hook]

[Shawn Jay]
Mo' Money, Mo' Problems, life of a legend
Haters throw salt like rice at a weddin
So what, that's your cousin, that don't mean nuthin
Her like missin is a type of affection you get
You just blind to the facts
See the lies just as obvious as cries for attention
Yield to the blindness, apply your suspicion
But listen, say you love me, gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess?
Break up never, they just jealous!
Drama from your momma, mean mug from your brothers
I'm that author of the book, they can judge from the cover
Yes - I, I been to jail
And yes - I'm grindin for real
I'm a positive talkin negative pimp
They hate to see you doin better than them, so!

[Hook]

(Ladies and Gentlemen, Ciara)

[Ciara]
Some people don't like, it
Cause you hang out in the street
But you my boy-friend
You've always been here for me
This love is serious
No matter what people think
I'm gon' be here for ya
And I don't care what they say
Some people don't like, it
Cause you hang out in the street
But you my boy-friend
You've always been here for me
I love the thug in ya
No matter what people think
I'm gon' be here for ya
And I don't care what they say

It was this bitch that I knew back from '86
Graduated and made it from the college of dicks
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me
Tryin to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key
Nah ho I ain't po', where did my motherfuckas go
I remember this ho, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well
How the hell you been since I had no job
Hum, why don't you give me some
Cause you know I flow and run for Suave
Nah, all of that was on the couch
No doubt y'all records spin, y'all shippin in gold
It's cold On The Outside Lookin In (Brrrr!)
You'd besta make yourself worthy
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their johnson very dirty
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit
Ain't this a bitch
I remember when you would not give me shit
Now you down for them habits
Put your numbers on the napkin
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom

Chorus:

Hoes with no clothes showin' love
Shakin that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes showin' love
Shakin that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothe showin' love
Shakin that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes showin' love
Shakin that ass in the club nigga what?

[Eightball]
No different from the rest
She's just an ordinary ho
Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo
Make it fast, takin cash, shakin ass in the mix
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks
Niggas in love
Can't stay out the club
All in the ho's face
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased
I see him in the back
Countin up that chedder
Talkin' loud, smokin hay, makin clouds, gettin ready for the crowd
I think I know one
I remember you, oh yes I do
Tryin to highside from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo
What time the club close, at 3
What's up, you comin with me
We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees
You want some cheese
Hoes don't stay at the suave house
Hoes around my nuts like knats
Real dogs don't pay for cats, dats
For real baby
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sho nuff

Chorus

[MJG]
Well I be God damned, this stout ass ho
Wants to get close to me
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow
Lookin for, confidants, and tickets to my next show
Check yo' bitch
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses
Oh yes it's very true
Your bitch'll be needin me, leavin you
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do
Let her loose or let her remain
Cause all she be lookin for is some fame
A bigger name
Lil' Miss Thang with bigger game
And she claim she ain't heard my music
Tryin to trick me
So I told that ho my name Bill Bixby
She still hit me
Now she, killin my dick softly with her mouth and I
Really just don't plan on takin it out cause I
MJ fuckin G you needs to knows 'bout these hoes shakin
They ass with no clothes like some pros, sho nuff

Only rich motherfuckers doin' beats like me
(16 Hoes) And they all obey
Bitch talked back to me, got dumped in the face
I flunked recess (bitch I don't play)
Do you really understand? (alright, okay)
(16 Hoes) Break brenzell with Phenzell
(Catch that trick) then *chirp* me on my Nextel
Bitch I could care less (if you meant well)
Get ya ass back on the track (and slang that tail)

When I was 16 used to fuck hoodrats, it's not a big thing
A few years later did some major upgrading
See a top-notch, I say "Hey, what's up baby"
(16 Hoes) Can't find your lost whore?
She's probably with $hort, playin' at the golf course
Another ego, a hole-in-one
The game ain't boring, my hoes are fun
I got (16 Hoes) all nicknamed Bitch
Make Daddy happy, y'all get that dick
Since they're everywhere, you figure I'll stop
Couldn't be a better player than me
Nigga, I got (16 Hoes)[Hook]
Pimp niggas don't pay a dime ppppppppppppooooooooooooooooopppppppppppppp
I'm fucking two bitches at the same time
Then I hit the studio and I write a rhyme
I call it "Tramp Hoes Ain't Hard to Find"

[Verse 1]
I took two bitches to a hotel
I told em both "you know I won't tell"
Bitch, curiosity killed the cat
You gotta lick the clit while I hit it from the back
Don't be stingy girl, lick my balls too
You was talkin big shit when I called you
You said you never fucked another girl before
And you wanted me to help you so
Bitch, I took you down to the strip club
I told you "look around, who you wanna fuck?"
You picked thick chocolate, big booty, big tits
I told her she could have you, and this dick
She got so excited she got off work early
Jumped in the back and started lickin on my girlie
I couldn't get home fast enough
Now it's time to fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When we got to my room she started actin nervous
Sat down and said "lets order room service"
I said "bitch, what are ya smokin?
A big fat dick coming from East Oakland"
I stuck it in her mouth, she started moanin
I said "hang up, get off my telephone, bitch"
I put the game down immediately
I'm a vet from the town, started freaking them freaks
And once they started, they couldn't stop
I fuck 'em for awhile then I kick back and watch
Two bitches at the same time
And neither one of these hoes is mine
I don't give a fuck, I'm a player
I been doin this for years, I got bitches everywhere
You think I'm paying hoes? You got the game distorted
You a trick, mad cause you can't afford it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Them bitches kissed twenty minutes straight non-stop
Strip girl on the bottom, 'lil momma on top
It was beautiful, you know what happened next
Spent twenty more minutes licking each other's breasts
Two titty sucking hoes, navels and toes
Bitch rolled her on her stomach, licked her asshole
I was smokin on a fat one, layin in the cut
After seeing this shit, I ain't wanna fuck
I wanna see how long they can keep goin
I don't know, I fell asleep on 'em
When I woke up I was getting my dick sucked
These hoes horny as fuck, they can't get enough
I was fucking them sluts 'til the sun came up
Nut in both their mouths, you ever done that stuff?
Dog baby, this shit ain't really nuthin to me
You better handcuff your ho or I'll be fucking your freak, nigga

[Hook]

Sing it, pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fuckin two bitches at the same time
Fucking two bitches at the same time
Let 'em know pimp niggas don't pay a dime, bitch
Hit the studio and write a rhyme
These tramps ain't hard to find nigga
Bitch
Two Bitches
Two of 'em
2 delicious Bitches[Jazze Pha]

Holla "WOOPT, WOOPT" homie if you see them laws
I got my pistol in my pants, rocks in my drawers

[Hook: Pimp C]
I was standin' on the corner slangin' 'caine (tryna make it do what it do)
Just another young nigga havin' thangs man (I gotta get, I, I gotta get it get it)
I was standin' on the corner slangin' 'caine (tryna make it do what it do)
Just another young nigga havin' thangs man (I gotta get, I, I gotta get it get it)

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm in the Porsche no passenger
Feeling like a filthy rich drug trafficker
See didn't nobody give me shit I got my ass on that interstate
Made sure my mama had food on that dinner plate
You not a boss if you ain't never took a loss
Some birds never landed but at least I didn't get caught
We don't even use scales, niggas break off a brick
Whatever over is yours homie, just take it and git!
They gave Big Paul life, but I ain't thinking about stopping
Cuz soon as he tried to quit
That's when the feds came, got him
Ain't nothin' in my name, and 50 cleaned up mine
I'm still paranoid though from what I left behind
Gotta put me some gloves on, they fuckin' wit Buck now
Tryna slow me down, got me pissin' in cups now
Three Kings on a mission, see we got it for cheap
You put us together, nigga the streets finna eat
YEAHH

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Hey
Remember standin' in the trap wit 5 or 6 over-vision and a pirat
That nigga who oderderd that quarter ki ain't even came by yet
Blew a whole O of dro, and I ain't even high yet

5ft 6in standing with his mouth piece near. Buyer making him wait
Smoked an ounce of hydro

Spent 4 G's or mo', and I ain't even fly yet

$4,000 on Moet and he ain't drunk yet

Viper truck, Bentley grill, big wheel pimpin'
They done gave her 20 mil, well big deal pimpin'
Think we fakin' when we spittin', better get real pimpin'
Cause we still will kill, you just better chill pimpin'
Get it how he used to live, and keep on fakin' for the women
In life we all make decisions even when faced with collisions
Like me at 13, out in no supervision
Straight thug livin', bumpin' pot drug-dealin'
Seen daily on the block, need Yay we on the block
Keep the hatin' to yourself, cause that AK be on the block
Dougy C be in the V, me and KT, we in the drop
Went from standin' on the block wit rock, to standin' on the top

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Young Jeezy]
Let's go
1 for the bread, and 2 for the blow
Mr. 17.5, ya damn right it's gon' snow
Told y'all I was gon' blow, kinky B said so
Or not, back to chargin' 600 for an O
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before (True)
Alleyoop nigga, all you gotta do is score
I turn the brick into a label, nigga I'm a boss
Brush my teeth in the morning, I ain't even gotta floss (Haha)
Sold two million records, and half a million O's (Damn)
Add it all up, it's 'bout a billion rocks
You can't be serious, you niggas ain't fo' real
Just my ears alone, is like a quarter mil' (That's right)
Hit ya by the tech, and blow half the budget (Yup)
I do it for the streets and mutha fuckers love it
Just copped the new Bent, you know ya boy pay cash
Now that's Thug Motivation for your mutha fuckin' ass

[Nate Dogg]
Is it cause they like my gangsta walk?
Is it cause they like my gangsta talk?
Is it cause they like my handsome face?

[Fish Scales]
My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hooks
You hear me flippin thru my pages out my favorite notebooks
The microphone was in the closet, no headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler
Always flirtin with all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin I got everything a country boy could ask for

[Big V]
Now what we do to get here? (say that boy)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (say that boy)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin, but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard, stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared of, but what was we afraid for?
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us
Being here is alright, but must believe we want more!

[Jazze Pha]
Them country boys on the rise
With them big fat wheels on the side
Peep them vertical grills on the ride
And awww-aw-aww-aw
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And awwwww

[Skinny DeVille]
My yegga, we hogwild, bet that from that roota to that toota file
Hell naw, them country boys ain't headed south for six miles
Kentucky mud, them kinfolk, twankies with them hundred spokes
Skullied on that front porch, plus you know they got dro
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille vertical Caddy grill
Interstate 65 heading down to Cashville
Glass filled, to the tippy top, back seat Benz
Spent my last cent on the rent, left with pocket lints
A damn shame, gotta grind anything and everything
Jimmy Crack Corn, cross the county line with Mary Jane
A long time, a gravel road, to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back, and back and forth, with same jeans and nappy 'fro

[R. Prophit]
I might, hop off the Harley, smoke mine like Bob Marley
Block parties with shawties, wallin like they swallowin Bacardi
Them butter-skin, Prophit gutter like kin
Understand you 'bout to lose ya life fuckin with them

[Cam'Ron]
Killer, uh, when it come to New York
I'm the man around town, just trust me
Down in the buggy, I that cat down in Kentucky
Outta Bowling Green, heard ya holding cream
Mess with a city slicker, we could mould the team
We'll talk in code, smoker be the sandbox
Could be the ham hocks, or be the lamb chops
We'll make wild mills, how ill
I'll show you how that denial feel, trade in that cow grill

[Twista]
Finna head south, get up out the city
Smokin' on a fifty, feelin' pretty good
With a hood chick, gotta hit a little bit
Now she call me daddy in a caddy full of wood
Call me country, TV's on the headrest
Even if there ain't no seats in the back of me
I play the DVD's, for the cars on the streets
And the people in back of me
I'm trailin', a chevy with a grill or the black cadillac, got the option
If it ain't got rims when the drop on the block with no locks than it's not my concoction
Hurt 'em with the chrome, rollin' on chrome rims it's the twenties
This Nappy Roots and Twista, if it ain't dope then don't call it country

[Jazze Pha]
Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!
Peep the vertical grills on the ride!
And aw-awww-awww-awwwww!
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And awwwwwwww![Asher Roth]
Uh, and it just keeps goin (yeah)
And it just keeps

So I'm in the airport getting ready to leave
Heading to a friend's wedding in the N.Y.C
But my head has been spinning, I'm forgetting to eat
All this jet setting has been really getting to me
It's already 11:20, I'm ready to sleep
But instead I end up sitting in a 27-C
An aisle seat, fine by me
But the guy that's inside's always tryin to pee
With a wild child behind me, he's cryin and keeps
Flippin out and kickin at me while he violently screams
So I silently plea, oh God, please
Let there be a honey sitting 27-B
But of course some morbidly obese
Beast is in the seat that wheezes when he breathes
Dude sitting D is at least three deep
And he keeps telling me what is wrong with his knees: (I got bad knees)
'Osgood Schlatters,' just need water
But for a bottle they charge two dollars" (what?)
And when I thought that it couldn't get worse
I forgot my iPod

[Hook: Jazze Pha + Asher Roth]
I'm havin a bad day
Nothin ever seems to go my way
Everybody needs to go away
Why? Because I'm havin a bad dayyyyy, yeah
Hey hey, and it just keeps goin (keep goin)
And it just keeps (goin on!)
And it just keeps goin (keep goin)
And it just keeps (goin on)

[Asher Roth]
So four hours and turbulence
We land when I'm about to turd in my pants
But the captain has "Seatbelt fastened"
So my ass is just passin gas and
Then at last I escaped from the plane
When I'm minutes away from clinically insane
I make my way towards baggage claim
When I hear a high-pitched voice scream my name (Asher!)
Some dumb bitch I went to high school with
While I'm sweating she's telling me she likes my shit
I just smile and think, 'bout how great it would be
If I could just hit this chick with a quick leg sweep (leg sweep)
So I pick up my L.L. Bean
And beeline for the next taxi
In need of weed, and boxer briefs
But my bag's only got Maxi's

[Hook]

[Asher Roth]
I check in to my hotel room
And I pick up my cell phone to dial the groom
Tell him my mood and I'm ordering food
And I'm probably gonna stay in and watch a movie
But the tube has no HBO (what?)
So anything I want, yo I'm paying fo'
But I'm lame and broke, so I'm laying in a robe
Watching that "Little People, Big World" show
Right then there's a knock at the door
It's my last hope for a Spanish whore
Who will change my sheets in exchange for penis
"Hi, I've lost my cat; have you seen it?"
Jesus, this day is the worst
At least I can give Little Me a jerk
And then go to sleep, healthy and disease-less
It guess it could be worse; but I'm just

[Hook]

Now I don't want to see no fatty full of rigor mortis
Go ahead and jiggle it for the one with money in his hands

And come over here by the table and give me a lap dance
Bend it over, come and get this dust
Got a player thinking that we fitting to cut
Gots to hit that from the back
Shorty got a little junk in the trunk
Look at how she make one butt cheek freeze
Look at how she make the other cheek move fast
Look at how she switch, make the other cheek move
Then work both sides and clap that ass
Remember them times
When you met two shorty's and you really want the cutey
But you let her slide

Making it wiggly baby you can never get rid of me
And uh, twerk something!
Oh yeah! Bet the booty's softer then a teddy bear
So fat I could barely stare
Girl the derriere's kind of scary there
Come and drop it for the nigga named Twista
Come and pop for me like a pistol
Got badunkadunks from my mob
And I got badunkadunks for Jazze Phizzle
Girl you deserve respect
You look so good girl I commend you!
The hottest thing on the menu
When I'm off up in the strip club I like when you
Strut that thing, floss that ass
Work it all the way down to the floor
Climb to the top, shake it upside down
Slide down the motherfucking pole
Work that crowd, give a lap dance
Shake it like it's one eighty proof
Take all the ballers up in VIP
Girl go and work your badunkadunk

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Badunkadunk - all in your face when you're at the club
Badunkadunk - slide down the pole for the dirty dub
Badunkadunk - look at your ass girl, it's so much fun
Badunkadunk - I tell the DJ, I need a hundred ones
Badunkadunk - What!
Badunkadunk - Drop your
Badunkadunk - all that
Badunkadunk - bounce your
Badunkadunk - big fat
Badunkadunk - I love your
Badunkadunk - I tell the DJ I need a hundred ones!

Looking for the niggas that say they finna attack me
Turn the music down low and let the 'lac creep
Fuck the police, I give a damn if they catch me
Wait a minute that's that nigga looking at me
Let off fifty shots you niggas ran like a track meet

But the shit a old folk so you can receive the letter

And the freshest of the fresh
Gotta pistol black out wit an Atlanta Hawk vest
Gotta lifetime of trouble and my brain still nervous

All the niggas on the block that got that work to move

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
It's Weezy baby, young and from the Dirty South
Get up your dope, I'm putting birdies out
Like thirty in my mouth, so I can say
Fuck you bitch you still ain't got a dirty mouth
The hood still ain't got over the drout
So you should sleep on your roof, just to watch over ya house
Nigga we timin', the cost of my watch over ya house
I'm a boss man, I watch over the South
Jazze Pha, let's hop in the Lammy (Lamborghini)
Stop by Sammy, chill in the hood, you good, you family
My boys like to pull them blammies, and big pimp
Mami suck dick 'til she pull your hammy, homey
You know we only, keepin it gangsta
Deep in the Range, 17 in the chamber
All I need is my banger, nigga it's Weezy
This shit is over somebody cue me

(Chorus)

(Verse 2 - Lil' Wayne)
You don't wanna play wit me, I touch you man
Lose ya man in a tussle, but y'all don't see me
Y'all can't hear me, this a def jam, call me Russell, man
I played on Martin, call me hustle, man
And now y'all know I'm the yee-yo muscle, man
But on the under, I got that wonder, to stop that thunder
That rumble in the side of ya stomach, piled on water
How do you want it, come through in a Coupe powder blue or
High with water, how do you want it man
Ay, I towed a lot of tullies dun, I den broke a lot of hoopties dun
I den drove a lot of QP's from, here and there on the road
For the nigga gotta move his son, and I show you how to do this son
That's, that boy Weezy We, CMB, BITACH, and ya stunned

(Chorus)[Hook]
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine?

[Outro]
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine? (Do anyone?)
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine?[2Pac]
Shit, I'm a changed man
Ay, turn the lights out
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look

[Verse One: 2Pac]
By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggas trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a balling cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin' is

[Hook: Johnta Austin + (2Pac)]
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin with a changed man

[Verse Two: T.I.]
In drop top, the Glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggas but hardly stop niggas
Not if they got niggas, doughboys and hot niggas
Who mighta shot niggas but only by skrilla
I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
To be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat - don't creep
Oh what you think, T.I., P and them sweet? (Don't sleep)
Get you hit from your head to your feet (And you don't know me)
I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload
You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G
No three niggas here are gonna let me be
Or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga

[Hook]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin through coastin'
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin' out
M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
#1 in the nation
I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin' to the whole nation
GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin' on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggas
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggas
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the mass of smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries BLEED
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin' with a changed man

[Hook]

[Hook w/ 2Pac speaking over it]
E'rybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggas don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man

[Outro]
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Nigga, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, I ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, fuckin' with a changed man, changed man[Intro]
Dig pimp... I'ma holla at y'all in a minute, I'm finna go change clothes mayne
Go get real spiffy mayne, go kick it with my broad, I'ma holla atchall later..

[Verse 1]
I left the kids at the crib, and the squad in the trap
Now I'm in the two-seater with my broad in my lap
The alpines beatin', but I'm far away from rappin'
Bumpin' Prince, Sade, or some Marvin Gaye perhaps, I
Put up my blues, put on some tailor made slacks
Some wing tip shoes, whachu know about that?
Button down, cufflinks, hair cut, no hat
Just felt like gettin' clean and show I know how to act
At Neiman & Marcus let my girl blow three or four stacks
Gotta forever to cut the food, and damn I'm relaxed
In a real cool mood, no beef, no gats
But then real close by, niggas better know that

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]
I ain't hangin' with my niggas, pullin' no triggaz
I'll be back to the trap, but for now
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today
I ain't hangin' with my potnaz, I'm out eatin' lobster
I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today

[Verse 2]
This shit look hard, no drama from none of my baby mama's
With my hottie, takin' shots of ??? in the Hummer
Known to kick it like we riches, got Richie and Madonna
Or either Will and Jada, on vacation for the summer
Me and my lil' mama, blowin' big as we wanna
Gotta big sack of some of that shit from California
A bottle of Patron and a six pack of Corona
Dro aroma got the six hot steamin' like a sauna
So I let the top back and I bend anotha corner
Check into the W, so I can put it on her
Got the suite for a week, but we can stay a lil' longer
I ain't trippin', that's the shit that make relationships stronger

[Chorus - repeat]

[Hook]
Tonight I'm gon chill with my lady friend
She the type to keep a nigga open
I'm chillin' with my bitch today

[Verse 3]
I left the stress in the streets and I'm a long way from home
Put up the vest and the chrome, even through with my phone
My potnaz don't wanna be on the shit that I'm on mayne
Livin' life and kickin' it like a grown man
Sittin' in the sand, drinkin' pina coladas
With a double shot of rum, just chillin' right by the water
No judges, no lawyers, in a whole 'nother world
Just a bottle and this ?? dro, blowin' with my girl

[Chorus - repeat]

[Repeat Hook][Verse 1: T.I.]
They say love blind, so why can't I picture this guhl mine?
Yea I dig her but I figure, I'm wastin this guhl time
I'm runnin from relationships, scared to commit
Mad at monogamy, sexually, I'm a misfit
But this shit's... way too much fo me
Usually I can take 'em and make 'em a cut buddy
Yo mama probably see me, and say that I'm no good
I was born in the burbs, I was raised in the hood
We from two separate sides of life, two different backgrounds
Shawty been legit and I just started to rap now
I ain't tryina act now, I'm bein' real witchu
Really, I just wanted to kick it and chill witchu
But the picture got bigger, 'fo I could even paint it
Thoughts got deeper befo' a nigga could think
A playa like me on this, strange ain't it?
One thang bout yo feelins is this, you can't change it
Yo perception on me, I don't think I can maintain it
We flirtin' with disaster, this game we playin is dangerous
You the best thang that happened since I done became famous
But sometimes I think we shoulda remained strangers

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
I.. chose you baby
(Stay with me now, stay with me, sing it fo me shawty)
Oh I oh I chose you baby
(Ah, come on, uh, uh, uh c'mon)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I like you to pursue, but still I respect it to let it go
Give it time, give it room to breathe and let it grow
I'll just tell her when I'm ready to change, I'll let her know
Hate to say it, but til then be friends and nothin' mo
Even though anotha time, anotha life, anotha place
I swear I know we coulda been great
But rather than great, you lil heart take the smile of yo face
So I can treat you righ, I'm willin to wait
And ain't shit fake, I know it sound funny comin from a felon
But I think I got a piece of what's up in heaven
So to keep from, blockin my blessings, think I better back up
Last thang a nigga need now is bad luck
But if my life was perfect shawty, I'da had her
I guess, I guess I don't deserve it, ballaz tell me you ain't worth it
So I gots to hit the surface, I'll holla when I holla
Act like I don't wanna see ya, and I don't wanna call her

[Hook: Jazze Pha] x2[Verse 1]
I just touched down, touched down
Quarter after two, flight 102
I know it's late, real late
But I'm calling you, calling you
Tryna figure if I, I
Can, can
I, I
Come, come
See, see
You, can I come see you
I know you're sleep, you're sleep
But you're on my mind, my mind
And I'm wide awake, awake
And I wanna stop by, come on over
So can you get up and get out of the bed
Cause I wanna see you
And I been wondering

[Hook x2]
Can I come over, can I
Come over, stop by
Come over, to see you
Come over, tonight
Can I come over, can I
Come over, get wit' ya
Come over, just wanna
Come over, be with you baby

[Verse 2]
So tell me what the deal
You're not that far
I just got my bags
And I'm headed to the car
Say yes or no, cause I'm on the road
{Um, wait a minute my battery's low...lemme, aight}
Baby, I wanna come see you
Said I really wanna come see you
Don't you worry about a thing
I'm just wanting to hold you
Embrace you, I want to
Look at you and tell you
How much I love you
I want you, I need you, I miss you

[Hook x2]Yeahh.. scene so thick
Talkin bout OutKast, Organized, Rap-A-Lot
Nuttin but that U.G.K
All the playas
All the hustlers
Eightball, MJG, Goodie Mob
Y'all know what it is

[Ludacris]
See I'm a Southern ass nigga with some Southern ass hoes
A hundred thou cash gets the Southern ass flow
I'm rich bitch no more runnin round cold
Or shootin up windows and gunnin down doors
Oh, yea I think the suckas now know
That the hummer got dropped keep it on the down low
I'm cruisin up highways, stunnin down roads

Luda cash cheques that'll break the bank
Then I'm in the Old School like Frank the Tank
You can't beat me join me, petes they bore me
But all the Southern asses they keep me horny
Oooh, Big Tymers in a private jet

Every coast watch out cuz the south's takin over

Fore me and my ace-a lay down the whole place

Surprise, fuckin with me wrong way to wise nigga

Big ol' bankrolls, that's all a nigga know
Throw yo' elbows, I'm sicker than I suppose
Hoes unchose, cuz my jewelry froze
You know how it goes, these young niggas don't want it like this
Go off and get yo' gat, to silence the chit-chat, blast!
So pass, outlast, bout cash

[Hook: Cee-Lo]

[Big Boi]
Look now beyond the rims and all the 'dro
The 'dro and all the smoke, my throat, it makes me choke
Like a serial killer was squeezin on my throat box
In the clutches of danger but not a stranger on the block
Is it the cheeferry reefer be blowin my chest up
Be riding from the club trying my best not to mess up
A professor of this lyrical thang, I'll take the purist strain
Of this slang and inject it into your veins
Did your heart stop man? Drop-top fade
Aviator shades with a mirror front face
Movin through the dirty at a slow pimps pace
Kinda like the turtle and the rabbit in the race
To the finish line, I jumped a pair of Reeboks
So bright, so fresh, snow white but no socks
Then I slip on some of that O with the wings
I bust it straight out the pack like a three piece
Prophylactic, before you splack it
You gotta prepare it and mack it, wear your jacket or it's tragic
Not intended for any illegal purposes
It's like anthrax and small pox in surplus to murderous
(Ya gotsta understand Trick love the kids!)
(Trick love the kids!)

I'd like to spend the rest of my night with you
[Yea so how bout you, so how bout you]

[Lil' Wayne]
I'll take your bitch give her back; take your bitch again
That's because you throw a 5 I pitch a 10
Now she wanna get inside of me 66
She sees that my wrist is blue and yellow like Michigan
She say she love her man she misses him
But nobody do it better than her distance dick (me)
I'm her long distance pimp
When I land my bitches want for me on the strip (yup)
And I don't lie I confess, I'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress
Gotta dress to impess though, Gotta stay clean, plus momma in a Lex 4
She with me, what you expect, I live to be fly to death
It's the Birdman Jr., sincerely yours
When it rains it pours, when it rain it whores

(Chorus)
[Li' Wayne]
Now why you wanna go do that
I can see through that
Tattoo right there like I view that
Girl what that say, what who that
Bet he was lame, bet he Lil' Wayne (no)
Cus I'm way more flyer
Have you hanging round a bunch of yayo buyers (nop)
And not a day go by us, we don't get high than the telephone wires
Cut your telephone we riding where phones don't roam they don't even come on
You're far from home so leave it alone
You creeping with the king of the throne
You sleeping in a tee and a thong
With your hair in a pony
I ain't got no blinds we can stare at the morning (yup)
But I can't be there all morning
Girl I'm a pimp, I'm going, going, going, gone

(Chorus)
[Lil' Wayne]
I'm Sorry I was grooving
Gotta love that laid back Mannie Fresh music
But let's get back to what we were doing
Laid back in that black on plat Ewing's
That's 33 tires he fire
These streets ain't papaya ma
You gotta keep heat on your side
2 must
So I'm a get 3 more and cop you one
Wait, naw hun cus you ain't exempt
If your ass ever trip I'll give you a clip (yea)
But I love the way your jeans suck in your hip
And you walk kinda mean how you strut with a dip
And you talk kinda clean and you lick your lips
But I can't fall for you cus I stick to the scrip (yup)
I said I stick to my grip; I stick to my money, that's life to me
Sorry honey Jazze

(Chorus)
[Lil' Wayne]
So how bout you yea
So how bout you
See what I'm talking bout sweet heart you ain't even gotta have John Madden
You ain't gotta have Dick Vitale, you ain't gotta Lee Carsole
You ain't gotta have Stuart Scott, you ain't gotta have Linda Cohn
Know what I'm talking bout, you ain't gotta have the staff of ESPN
You ain't gotta have ABC staff just to talk sports baby cus I got game
Just fuck with the boy and I'll get you a jersey
What you want me to put on the back
Daddy's little that's right, see what I'm talking bout
I can't give you the game but I can show the game
And you can see what you see and peek how you peek and get what you get
Know what I'm talking bout
Weezy[Jazze Pha] Chorus

Everybody loves a pimp
Chuurch. Tabernacle. Preach
Everybody love a pimp
Chuurch. Tabernacle. Preach
Everybody loves a pimp
The way I talk, the way I dress
I be so clean, I look so fresh
(Everybody loves a pimp)
The ice I wear, the car I drive
The hoes I got, they look so fly
(Everybody loves a pimp)
When ya pimp-ish, ya pimpin'
Everybody loves a pimp
When ya pimp-ish, ya pimpin'
Everybody loves a pimp

[Slim Thug] Verse 1

You know the boss got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but he got much more
From BK, N.Y. to the Malibu shore
I got a chick in every city, I can go on tour
You need a pimp in your life that's gon' guide you right
Won't handcuff ya when you tryna creep at night
I don't lose sleep at night [?], I don't care
I be hibernatin', call me Yogi the bear
I'm a pimp, baby
That's why I hold my nuts and walk with a limp, baby
I know you're tired of dealin' with all them simps, baby
So gon' hop on my team and drop your wimp, baby

[Slim Thug] Verse 2

Slim ain't with gettin' drama from chicks
So when my boo turn bitch that's my cue to switch
You won't catch me throwing licks 'cuz my feelings involved
I just erase 'em out the black book, problem solved
Bet she learn how to keep her mouth closed
I got zero toleration for hoes
Move to the next one, it's plenty fish in the sea
And plus there's plenty other chicks that dig me
I'm a pimp, baby
That's why I hold my nuts and walk with a limp, baby
I know you're tired of dealin' with all them simps, baby
So gon' hop on my team and drop your wimp, baby

[Jazze Pha] Bridge

I know you're surrounded by a lot of suckas
My advice is keep it pimpin'
All you see me with is G's and hustlas
Still a pimp. gon' keep some women
(Bitch where's my money?)
I see the game through the Cartier lens
Push a 'Lac 'stead of driving my Benz
Try to be a gentleman, as nice as I can
But bitches be playin'
