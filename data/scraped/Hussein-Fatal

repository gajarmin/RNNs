[Intro]
[2Pac] Ahh yeah!
[Down] Yeauhh!
[2Pac] It's all about you, one time!
[Down] I'mma say it's all about you baby, yeah!
[2Pac] Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you - it's all about you!
[Down] This Dru Down in the house, with my boy 'Pizznac, youknowhatimsayin'?
[2Pac] It's all about you
[Down] Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you, but you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauhh

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause
Addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true, what I'm sayin', boo
Is this is all about you

[Hook: Nate Dogg] (x2)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you, yeah nigga

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]

[Hussein Fatal]
Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo, I gets down like Dru
And my nasty new niggas, too

[Yaki Kadafi]
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

[Hussein Fatal]
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

[Hook] (x4)

[Outro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean ... god damn, youknowhatimsayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin'?
And then, yaknahmsayin', what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video
I mean - damn - everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real
Yeah[Hook: Carl Thomas]
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Murderous mind state, can't keep my nine straight
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waitin' for the time to break
Show up and motherfuckers bow down recognize
Westside, Deathrow, Outlaw Ridahz
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well known felons, labelled for drug sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed, roll with thugs and dawgs
Commence to lettin' off rounds, then escape in a fog
Who wanna see me solo?
Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
My mini fourteen murderin' niggas while they creepin', uh
Duck or you ass out, drink till you pass out
Ain't scared to die, drunk drivin' in my glasshouse
Niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
They heard the stories nigga now they wanna really see
Bomb first my motto, it's fully guaranteed
Niggas is playa haters, label them my enemies, I'm dumpin'

[Hook: Carl Thomas]
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get
Out the window on some uptown anthem shit
I'm stressin' but ain't no pressure here, I been there before
Fugitive, task force, at my girlfriend door
Now they checkin' our my bedroom, I ain't there
40 Cals, extended clips, still, I ain't scared
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive
I'm different and I'mma prove it if it take me to die
Knew that God had a plan for me
But he won't be layin' up in my casket to doing life in the can for me
Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch
Me dyin', you think I'd let them see the joy from that shit?
Walking dead, angel spend they last days by me
New Jersey giant like Dave Tyree
Young George and Jonathan Jatt, your guns clap
Mine'll go brraaatt, soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And come through cockin' the black pound
When they put twin towers up, Pac, I'm knocking them back down
Poster child cheque, Air Force Ones with the crooked dial checks
I'm supposed to wild sex
Money and murder, is all I breathe in my life
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the devil
G ridin' with extra boxes of bullets to the nine and the shell

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Papoose]
I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in a box cuz them graverobbin' bastards
Dig your grave back up, snatched you out the casket
Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
With the 'Pac keeping the shot money, progressive
They don't really want no drama, I know you're goons
That's why I keep pressure on them like a open wound
This God-given, he keep givin' me better music
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin'
Songs are evolution, If I load your gun for you
And we bang it out at some other niggas you better shoot it
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever stupid
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless, you got the same bullets that you had
When I loaded it for you, you never used it
The Nacirema dream get ready for execution
Papoose, Fatal and Pac, the revolution

[Hook]

[Outro][Part I: Fatal]
Ich setz den Hut nie auf - Gucci-Bauch
Breakdance-Battle abgesagt - Fuß verstaucht
Meine Jungs sind im Haus (EY), tieferer Sound (EY)
Deine Jungs sind im Haus (EY), ich schmeiß' sie vom Balkon
Für die ganzen G's mit den Allergien
Für die Möchtegern die als Straße stehen
Mein Gheddo und mein Name tief in Mund und in Arsch rein nehm'
Hat's dir geschmeckt? "nein", Dankeschön!
Du kannst jetzt gehn', ich lieb den Hate
Und fress die Kugeln von euch Schwuchteln
Mit Genuss so wie ein Steak
F a t a l, der Anwalt der Straße, wir rollen die Felgen
Jeder von uns hat minimum zwanzig Prozent Voddi-Patienten
Du trinkst Sirp, alles glänzt so wie goldene Ketten
Du schläfst ein, Junge ich rip dein Arsch
Komm mal wir Jetten

[Part II: Bonez MC]
Dikker was willst du machen, ich schnapp deine Taschen
Der Bass pumpt so krass das die Pappbecher wackeln
Und du machst dich zum Affen, 'das nicht zu fassen
Ich klatsch auf dein Nacken, hältst dich für klug
Stolperst, fällst von dem Zug
Scheiße deine ganze Crew hat nicht mal Geld für ein' Hut
Wenn ich mich locker mache brauch ich keine Vodka-Flasche
Mach bitt' ein Bomber klar, clean in der Doppel-Tasse
Bonez immer höflich, Codein macht's möglich
Nicht so geil, weil so gesehen ist Drogen nehmen auch tödlich
Digga alles dreht sich, Bullen schicken mich in Käfig
Sie wollen mich knicken doch es geht nicht

[Hook: Fatal & Bonez MC]
Obama ist auf Sirp, Toni Montana ist auf Sirp
Und Osama ist auf Sirp, auch deine Mama ist auf Sirp
Auf Sirp, genug Kohle für ein Kilo in der Tasche
Bruder komm mach uns nach gib den Sirup in die Tasse
Obama ist auf Sirp, Toni Montana ist auf Sirp
Und Osama ist auf Sirp, auch deine Mama ist auf Sirp
Auf Sirp, genug Kohle für ein Kilo in der Tasche
Bruder komm mach uns nach gib den Sirup in die Tasse

[Part III: Bonez MC]
Koordiniert trotz Codein, ist kein Problem was hoch zu ziehen
Paar Drogen-Deals im großen Stil, und damit die Million verdien'
Jap ich glaub dran, ab aufs Laufband, halt den Ball flach
Mach kein Aufstand, zwanzig Tags an deine Hauswand
Halt dein Maul sonst rast ich aus man, nicht mal richtig aufgestanden
Schon wollen sie ein Autogramm, Käse-Flöte auf entspannt
Verkauf ein Gramm im Hauseingang, Fotzen glotze wenn ich aus dem dreiundsechziger steige
Komm mir nicht mit Schaberlot, dieser Anzug kostet zwei Scheine
Krokodil auf Codein, der Hase grün wie Brokkoli
Kein Bock mehr auf Kokain, digga nur noch auf dem Sofa liegen
Steh nur auf zum Drogen-Dealen, kann mein Geld auch so verdien'
Bin paranoid und wenn es dann klopft einfach alles das Klo runterspülen

[Part IV: Gzuz]
Ey ich bin so high ich muss furzen (Furz)
Komm gib mal noch so ein kurzen
Bin krank geschrieben jeden Tag, doch ich hab nicht mal schnupfen
Häng' im Puff mit paar Nutten, die schlucken ohne zu zucken
Denn Codein ist so beliebt das die Weiber darauf durchdrehn'
Jap, das trinkt auch deine Mama, das' nicht mal 'ne kleine Straftat
Trinkt das auch der Geisterfahrer? Geld verdien' mit Scheiße labern
Lecker und gesellschaftsfähig, ich glaub sogar die Merkel trinkt
Seh' Apotheker Scheine machen, großes Zücken, kleine Flaschen
Eins acht sieben Strassenbande, Sirup in der Badewanne
Oder in der Plastikflasche, Maske auf und rammsch die Kasse
Andre' Rapper reden viel, mein Lebensstil ist credibil
Jetzt sei doch nicht so negativ, lass uns 'ne Runde Sega spieln'

[Hook Fatal & Bonez MC

(EY)[Intro: 2Pac talking]
You motherfuckers kill me
Why yall niggas don't ever talk that shit when we be in the physical form?
Why yall niggas get all shy when we right there next to you at the premiere's and shit?
Hahaha
Yall niggas get alot of heart when you get in the studio, huh?
Get that can the man motherfucker wanna talk shit on the mic
Well do this for me, would you?
Next time you get the notion to talk some shit about an Outlaw nigga
Or a nigga from the west side the best side, call me
Call me nigga, reach out and touch a nigga, cause uh
If you don't do that and I hear one of you niggas sayin somethin on a record, ha
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I'm comin'

*Beat starts*

[2Pac]
Ah, from the pressure, yeah
You know how we do this Quik, Outlaws, untouchable
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons, millions of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crates (shh)
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenseless I'm hitting fences then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless at these nigga's throats?
Only wish to breed, I explode into a million seeds
Y'all remember me legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take 'em to places face to face then erase 'em, and break 'em
Murder motherfuckers that are waitin' to quicken the pace

[Hook: 2Pac]
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlawz rushing you busting you
We untouchable
(Repeat 2x)

[Gravy]
Aiyyo we won't stop, I let the '44 pop
Tanqueray and Alize' make niggas get shot
I'm smokin on some kush baby, you know it's all Gravy
Calicos, AK's, nigga's yellin' mayday
Payday, soon as the red dots connect
Off that haze and that 'dro, that Cali sticky icky
Strictly 2-1-3, 8-1-8, 3-2-3
3-1-0, we Outlawz, baby

[Yaki Kadafi]
I'm surrounded by thugs, slugs with crystals and pistols, callin'
Copy murderers that be softer than tissues
Got my persona soldier dedicated to the fuckin drama
My foes retreat like pros when they post my pros
Mashin' like piranahs or a pack of pitts
Bodies get wasted, paper chasin', tryna stack a brick
Dear mama, I'm touched for lots of lethal clutch, clingin' for a life which ain't much
And a lust for these guns to bust
Ain't no trust for these herbs tryna wet ya, keep my burner on the dresser
Wake up bustin' in the mornin' from the pressure

[Hook: 2x]

[Hussein Fatal]
I never had a chance to be a buster, I was raised hard
With the only shed of tattooed tears out near the graveyard
I rep my Outlaws deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let the industry cheat me
Only behind the scenes do they see me as 2Pac the don
And this bitch with 2 Glocks, I'm wrong
The homie still gon' roll and standin' with your biggest G
You still gon' fold, I can guarantee you a lost
The homie 'Pac told me "I can guarantee you a boss"
And it was in for a brief minute, far as my life
Since he disappeared, I still ain't found peace in it
But still strugglin like Mumia Abu, it was 'bout to end truly I knew
Named my daughter Assadah, for that alone, make 'em more than a rider
Got every homie trigger finger under the set
Dope but guaranteed now my 1 on 1 will connect

[Hook: 2x]

[2Pac]
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlawz! We untouchable![Intro: 2Pac]
(Are you scared to die?)
Is reincarnation
(Are you afraid to die?)
Reach the whole nation
Me murderer?
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Uh

[Hook x2: 2Pac]
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole Nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Hard words is spoken, many promises broken as if it's
Useless to hope, they got me constantly smoking
My role model was a cold bottle of O.E
Surrounded by my closest homies but nobody knows me
I pray to God it ain't easy
Half the cops in California got a hard on to squeeze me
Running through the backstreets, hopping over fences tryna shake the
Fucking K-9s, running around senseless
I'll probably be a mystery to many, but a legend to some
I've been a man for many women, but a husband for none
In case you see me out in traffic, looking nervous and high
My hands, holding my pistols will they serve us or die?
May God forgive me for my crooked ways, I didn't mean it
Knew I'd fall in love with money the first day that I seen it
Maybe now they can understand, my occupation
It's clear that my only fear of death is reincarnation

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal)]
I keep my shit on safety
I've been shooting rocks lately
Everybody dies, they nickel plates don't penetrate me
I was suppose' to be the murder first to go
Them niggas missed, grazed my wrist, I took it personal
Kato told me that I was slipping
Got his strap and started tripping
Slipped two clips on the
Table, twist an L and said "Fatal listen"
Everybody don't be missing keep your vest on baby
And you know that shit that happens to the Teflon, crazy
You ain't gotta pack a gat I got your back just keep your front line
Or we can stall that, from the Cadillac we buck the gun shots
But we locked down, don't have your back in the casket
All he thought about was plastic and murdering bastards

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: E.D.I Mean]
I spend my days and nights
Not knowing if a stray's in flight
They'll probably catch me
Leaving my foes hella' happy
Cause look, at any moment
The game could be my main opponent
Niggas be swimming where the sharks are and man they don't even know it
But I stay focused, concentrate on my surroundings
Cause if I'm slipping, well that's when niggas will get to clowning
And I can't have it, I got a mission to complete
Raise my kids upright, make sure they got something to eat
And my daily ritual is, protect my physical biz
I just can't see now, I choose death before the penal
Cause what good am I? To that little Nigga with them big eyes
If I'm incarcerated, feel me now, I gots to make it
And If I don't, Re-Reincarnation ain't an option
Leave my ass dead until it's really poppin'

[Hook x3]

[Interlude: 2Pac]
How can y'all call us murderers and shit and
Blame all the problems of the world on us young thugs, Thug Niggas from the streets, ain't that a bitch
Tell me y'all ain't giving a fuck about us when we was broke and poor
How come when we get a little money, motherfuckers wanna stop us and block us
What part of the game is that? Who should we love, who should we believe in when the motherfuckers that's supposed to be our role models, supposed to be the people we look up to is tryna snatch us out of the game
What type of shit is that? Fuck 'em all

[Verse 4: Kastro]
I still whizz for the top Dolla'
Just a true thug, with a comma
High power, small drama, made niggas
Top Drazed with a mean way to play 'em
These days, Homie I'm saying though, They tryna play me
I gots to get them, hit em and lay low
I told you before, my, only fear of death is momma, crying for help and papa tryin' to help
When I know we ain't got it but shit I gots to handle it, it's hard
They hand it to me, snitches, suspicious bitch niggas who ain't insanity
Never worry
Apparently, I think I never buried but if so I gotta go, my nigga's will always love me
Thug family ties, I know they want me to die but ima survive, see the look in my eyes

[Outro: Lemika]
And this Lemika and I'd like to give a shoutout to all the tray-whizz kids out and I'm appreciating how I'm chilling up in the studio with 2Pac and Cocoa G and uh -laughs- Okay I'm out, I'm done, I went out, Oh Shit, put this back[Intro: 2Pac talking]
This go out to C. Delores Tucker, Bob Dole
And everybody else who feels like uh
They stronger than the constitution
Freedom of speech big baby
Freedom of speech
Ha ha ha
Outlawz
Goddamn! Rap music I hate that
It's just so violent and it destroys everyone, it makes the kids crazy
The kids kill people
There cop hater
Here going against society, I don't understand the music
It's too loud, it's too rowdy, it's too violent
Let's ban all rap music
(Outlawz)
Ban 2Pac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz ban 'em
[Verse One: Young Noble]
Listen it ain't no stopping
I gotta hustle
Cop it make it double, try to
Stop it and touch it, I'mma cock it and bust it
Niggas tryna get it addicted to fast living
Get rich or die trying nigga as 50
I've been Operating Under Thug Laws As A Warrior
Oppressed by the industry the Hip-Hop government ?? by the Hip-Hop Police
Why you think Nas screaming Hip-Hop deceased?
No justice (No justice)
All the judges got grudges
Giving my niggas life for a little next to nothing
So wherever you are, just a little extra something
You ain't the only one, we all going through the struggle
Penny pinching
It's like you really ain't living
? until eleven's, I'm cooking in the kitchen
Like we looking and we wishing
Praying will he hear it?
It's eating at my spirit
Speaking for the spirits

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
You can't break me
Never make me
Busta soft the beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Deloris Tucker sue me I won't stop
Till we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies
Tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites
Whistling Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'mma make you sorry
Trust me
Didn't cry when they dropped me
(Nah)
Can they stop me?
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spitting it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we coming from
Life as an Outlaw
Ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop

[Hook: Young Noble & Stormy]
No way no how we got to keep moving
And putting it down
We can't stop
(Outlawz)
Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not
I don't know what you've been, told
Real niggas don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep going

[Verse Three: Hussein Fatal]
Bury me with a Makaveli suit and a Mac
I've God strike me with lightning, I'm shooting him back
Skinny cause I don't work out, my man is in the gym
Long as I'm strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
Trapped in the storm
Fuck the world till I'm gone
I'm bucking at Corey Brooke he treating my niggas wrong
Until I'm gone
They gon' see who I be
I picture this bricks ducking from the penitentiary

[Verse Four: Kadafi]
See
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams its all wrong
Pop too long gone, and now 18 I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in the zone
Protect my thrown pal like a king, Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Living life as a Don, Guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton

[Verse Five: Hussein Fatal]
Yeah your boys back with the proper team
When they think I'm wearing Red I'mma rock the Green
On a whole 'nother episode
Cops never heard of ya
The otherside'll hide down the block from the murder scene
Catch ya man he dead with the Fifth
When it's hot on Nu he G-Ride from the clear to the bricks
So gangster how he switched from the clear to the bricks
Niggas hate it but they scared of the Fifth

(And we won't stop)
Outlawz!

[Hook]

[Verse Six: Big Syke]
This rap game like a robbery
Cause it seem somebody hiding me
My nigga, made a motherfucker cop a Ki'
Motherfucker ain't no stopping me
My nigga, It's Mussolini see me all in the midst
I'm still chilling like I'm bottle of Crys'
Enemies sharpen they ?
And when they see me they can give me a kiss
So I'm posing with the frozen wrists
Outlaw immortalized we survived and curst
So I claim it like I'm bangin a turf
Yeah it's easy like I'm putting in work
Not been easy you wanna jerk
Come the squeezey I'm ready to murk
Outlawz, Makaveli niggas ready to flow
So baby are you ready to go?
Outlaw my niggas be screaming at night
A Big Syko with the thug in your life

[Verse Seven: EDI Amin]
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Keep going (Keep going)
Even when the wheels fall off we keep rolling (Keep rolling)
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
It's number one at the top of the charts
Here to stay like 'Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my blood stream (Yeah)
So when I flow, I gotta do my thug thing
For the hood the under privileged and oppressed
Young nigga get rich, cash more cheques
Take the hood life
Put it on on wax
Get stakes now we living the good life
Car brand new and it shine so clean
Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
And we, sitting clean in the latest edition
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we won't stop

[Hook][Part 1: Kontra K]
Ihr baut den Rap zusammen wie Steine, ich fühl' noch was ich schreibe
Halt mich fern von eurer Scheiße, weil ich blute jede Zeile
Schieb ruhig Abfuck auf mich, weil deine Freundin mich hart feiert
Doch zum Konzert gehen lässt du sie nicht alleine
Ich mache meinen Sound auch ohne deinen Segen
Die, die hassen, hassen nur, weil sie selber nichts bewegen
Also Mund zu und Kopf runter, wenn ich mit dir rede
Hörst du nur kurz offen hin, schreib' ich auch aus deiner Seele
Zu ehrlich für die Szene, doch zu gerade für deinen Hass
Zu Beginn fickt es mich ab doch dann zieh' ich daraus Kraft
Für mich ab, ey - Alles okay, Straße genug, auch wenn ich tiefer geh'
Weil ich hinter das gebaute Image des knallharten Dealers seh'
Karma Bruder, es gibt immer noch ein Wiedersehen
Denn irgendwann will jeder wissen wer hinter deinen Liedern steht
Das was du sagst oder nur das, was sie wollen von dir
Ob ich dann hass oder lieb, liegt an mir

[Hook: Kontra K] (x2)
Hassen geht so leicht, wenn man was nicht versteht
Doch wirklich ehrlich sein, ist der steinigere Weg
Immer erst dagegen, bevor du die Props gibst
Doch is er wirklich besser, Dicker, hat er sie verdient

[Part 2: Skinny Al]
Hassen ist nicht schwer Bruder, lieben um so mehr
Ich bin immer ehrlich, gerade und fair
Unterbemittelte Menschen machen was verkehrt
Wenn du's schaffst, ich gönn's dir - werde Millionär (In schā'a llāh)
Neidisch sein ist lächerlich, weil mein Bruder besser ist
Vorne rum gibst du Props, hinterm Rücken gönnst du nicht
Weil du auf der Couch hängst und nichts auf die Reihe kriegst
Immer auf der Suche, weil hungrige Wölfe schlafen nicht
Weil du weißt wie wir sind, wärst du gern auch so
Alles wird geteilt Freund, Junge kompromisslos
Immer da für die Jungs; Fremdwort: Missgunst
Jeder der so denkt wie wir, Charakterstärke mit uns
Dicka, ist so, sag nicht "Is' nicht so"
Ja, ihr seid nur Massenware mit Strichcode
Unsere (?) schwinden, in Wahrheit ist nichts los
Ihr bleibt nur Möchtegern, labernde Fisos

[Hook: Kontra K] (x2)

[Part 3: Bonez MC]
Hat er sie verdient Dicka, alles ein Schauspiel
Du bist so lange Straße, bis der ganze Scheiß auffliegt
Bis man dich auszieht und sieht, was für ein Jockel du bist
Vielleicht war das alles doch nichts für dich, He
Krasser Rücken, ist klar; Im Block voll der Star
Auf der Bühne stehst du da, mit 'nem Stock in deinem Arsch
Wie soll das laufen? Ich dachte du willst Hallen ausverkaufen
Man so wird sich die CD auf gar keinen Fall gut verkaufen
Und jetzt wirst du neidisch, willst unbedingt an mich rankommen
Brauchst das Rezept für meinen Rap, so wie Plankton
Es ist okay, du bist der Gangster vor dem Herrn
Doch weißt du was Dicka, Talent kann man nicht lernen
Und jetzt bin ich arrogant, weil du dachtest wir sind Brüder
Du fühlst dich als Verlierer, weil ich gebe dir kein Feature
Hast dich extra tätowiert, dachtest du gehst durch die Decke
Doch jetzt fängst du an zu hassen und verblutest auf der Strecke

[Hook: Kontra K] (x2)

[Part 4: ?]
Junge, Hass mich ruhig, ich schenk' dir trotzdem Liebe
Bis es zu persönlich wird und ich komm' und dich kriege
Player, Hater, Player, Hater - du kleiner Krebserreger
Auf der Straße bist du nett, im Internet dann einen auf Gegner
Suchst nach Lücken im System und im Fundament nach Fehlern
Mach das bei deinen Rabeneltern aber nicht bei dem Elfer T EL
Classico, die Kommentare, ich lach' mich tot
Um die Sache ernst zu nehmen Bruder, ist mein Schwanz zu groß
Danke Jungs, Hass ist die größte Anerkennung nach Respekt
Aber das wisst ihr nicht in euren Cyber-Ghettos wo ihr hängt
Wo ihr denkt, dass ihr etwas aufbaut - ohne Talent
Jeder Pisser hat auf seine Meinung heute ein Patent
Mach dein Herz auf mein Freund, lass' die Sonne rein
Ich schmeiß den Grill an mein Freund, (?) komm wir teilen
Kommst du cool, bin ich cool; willst du was, kriegst du was
Leg' es auf die Waage, Liebe ist schwerer als Hass

[Hook: Kontra K] (x2)

[Part 5: Crackaveli]
Ihr könnt mich lieben oder hassen: überlass' ich euch
Von der Bühne auf die Straße, denn ich weiß was läuft
Jeden Tag Neid und man zeigt Leistung
Man zeigt Reichtum, jeden Tag Zeitdruck
Viel Gerede, Augen lügen nicht
Was ich sehe lässt mich kalt, denn ich fühle nichts
Wahrheit oder Pflicht - Echt oder Story
Fantasie ist ihr Hobby
Die Welt läuft verkehrt und ich geh vor, sie geht zurück
Hab und Gut wird beschützt und die Ernte wird gefüllt
Egal wie du's drehst, egal was du machst
Hass macht mich stark, Liebe schwach

[Hook: Kontra K] (x2)

[Part 6: ?]
Du denkst das darf nicht sein, wenn du die Wahrheit nicht verträgst
Außerhalb der Blase in der du lebst, das große Ganze nicht verstehst
Ich seh' den Blick in deinem Gesicht, ein viel zu kleines Licht
Ich sag lieber nichts, war alles ein Witz, bevor noch dein Weltbild zerbricht
Hass mich aber quatsch nicht, Dicker, du kannst mich nicht runterziehen
Hier rein, da raus -  was willst du mir erzählen?!
Ich hab' die harte Schule durch, um Respekt zu verdienen
Bei DePeKa musst du mehr sein als nur in Berlin
So wie der Rest, scheiß auf Rap und dieses hurenhafte rumgefeature
Jeder ist mit jedem cool aber eigentlich mag sich niemand
Ich hab gar kein'n Bock mein Album zu schreiben
Und meine tiefsten Gedanken mit so 'nem Idioten zu teilen

[Hook: Kontra K] (x2)

[Part 7: Gazi 030]
Ich sitze in meinem Zimmer, verlassen von mir selbst
Ich spüre wie der Hass jeden meiner Schritte lenkt
Auch wenn man auf dich schießt, bist du nicht 50Cent
Sondern einfach nur gefickt und gebangt
Es ist die Wut, die mir aus der Seele spricht
Es ist der Höhenflug, der dir dein Genick bricht
Egal wer du bist, mit mir fickst du nicht
Ich bin der Junge, der immer in das Schwarze trifft
Ob verschieden Optik, oft die Action, die ich mach'
Ich box dir in die Fresse, du liegst 20 Tage flach
Wirf das Mic aus der Hand im Battle wirst du weggeklatscht
Du wärst auch gerne ein Rapper, hast den Zug leider verpasst
Frisch aus dem Knast, direkt rein in das Spiel
Meine Jungs von Berlin Macht machen euch Opfer zum Ziel
Ihr seid uns nicht gewachsen, ihr redet nur zu viel
Hier komt Gazi 030 aus der Hauptstadt Berlin[Intro]
[2Pac] Ahh yeah!
[Down] Yeauhh!
[2Pac] It's all about you, one time!
[Down] I'mma say it's all about you baby, yeah!
[2Pac] Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you - it's all about you!
[Down] This Dru Down in the house, with my boy 'Pizznac, youknowhatimsayin'?
[2Pac] It's all about you
[Down] Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you, but you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauhh

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause
Addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true, what I'm sayin', boo
Is this is all about you

[Hook: Nate Dogg] (x2)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you, yeah nigga

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]

[Hussein Fatal]
Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo, I gets down like Dru
And my nasty new niggas, too

[Yaki Kadafi]
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

[Hussein Fatal]
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

[Hook] (x4)

[Outro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean ... god damn, youknowhatimsayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin'?
And then, yaknahmsayin', what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video
I mean - damn - everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real

And what ever it is then that's what is gonna be nigga
Hussein Fatal, the outlaw don, "Blood In My Eyes"
Shyea', Triple O stand up, Got your mind's back right
Jerse's mobbin' these cowards all the time
You know gunning them down, Every thing like that
Smooth stayin' forty below on these cowards, early nigga
Outlaw status only got these niggas on freeze
Get down and lay down, Draw heat and protect your self
Rule' holla at yo' peoples nigga..

[Verse 1 Ja Rule]
For now on call me the don, and bicthes call me don da da
Where ever I go niggas soon to follow'
Like when I dropped my first joint making the world "Holla"
I kept it "Between Me And You"
Cause that what real street niggas do
"Put it on Me, cause even thugs get lonely
Sometimes "I Cry", fo' niggas I'm a baptized
When will they realize I "Live It Up"
Cop tha coke sell it and re' it up
I'm "Always On Time" got bitches "Memsmerize"
From the "Thug Lovin" load the clip
Cock back the nine, open mouth shove it
Look in his eyes, and squeeze like fuck it
And just to think my niggas do this shit for nuthin'
When my wild Rule' thuggins, lookin' to get a come up
Come on in and catch the angel that's all in
Call me Lord remis' my time, and I'll arrive with
Blood in my eyes

[Hussein Fatal Talking]
That's what real niggas do u know
We hold it down for each other
We don't waste time we get it done
Why not, Why would'nt we, you know
That what goes down you know
You draw yours, I draw mine
Who ever get the drop that what it is
The object is to get it done, let's go it's nuthin' (Yo)

[Verse 2 Ja Rule]
Fuck tha world and niggas that proceed to run it
Rule' for prez cause I'm one of the best that done it
On the M-I, these niggas spittin' semi, to get by
But never really get right, livin off of the hit I
"DMX" was my dog, but now we just dog fight
Sucking on glass dicks
Calling
Them crack pipes
And I'm hearin' you letting yo' health slide these days
And yo lady's dicked up, and you contracted to aids
Who the fuck you callin' gay nigga, must a been talk to
Em' and "Dre", nigga, pour out a little liqour
And rest in peace to "2Pac Shakur", cause you let us know
That Dre was a queer before
And "Marshall" how dare you use his name in vain
Son of a panther, you'll never understand his pain
But you do understand trailer parks and cocaine
Disrespcting your mother what fuckin part of
The game is that man , I guess this world need change
So we got it, and now I gotta put 'em in the grave
Red, dot 'em before they put us in the cage
Rule' and Gotti america's most wanted to many..
Come and get me!!! (Pretty soon ya gonna pay)[Intro: 2Pac talking]
This go out to C. Delores Tucker, Bob Dole
And everybody else who feels like uh
They stronger than the constitution
Freedom of speech big baby
Freedom of speech
Ha ha ha
Outlawz
Goddamn! Rap music I hate that
It's just so violent and it destroys everyone, it makes the kids crazy
The kids kill people
There cop hater
Here going against society, I don't understand the music
It's too loud, it's too rowdy, it's too violent
Let's ban all rap music
(Outlawz)
Ban 2Pac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz ban 'em
[Verse One: Young Noble]
Listen it ain't no stopping
I gotta hustle
Cop it make it double, try to
Stop it and touch it, I'mma cock it and bust it
Niggas tryna get it addicted to fast living
Get rich or die trying nigga as 50
I've been Operating Under Thug Laws As A Warrior
Oppressed by the industry the Hip-Hop government ?? by the Hip-Hop Police
Why you think Nas screaming Hip-Hop deceased?
No justice (No justice)
All the judges got grudges
Giving my niggas life for a little next to nothing
So wherever you are, just a little extra something
You ain't the only one, we all going through the struggle
Penny pinching
It's like you really ain't living
? until eleven's, I'm cooking in the kitchen
Like we looking and we wishing
Praying will he hear it?
It's eating at my spirit
Speaking for the spirits

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
You can't break me
Never make me
Busta soft the beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Deloris Tucker sue me I won't stop
Till we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies
Tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites
Whistling Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'mma make you sorry
Trust me
Didn't cry when they dropped me
(Nah)
Can they stop me?
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spitting it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we coming from
Life as an Outlaw
Ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop

[Hook: Young Noble & Stormy]
No way no how we got to keep moving
And putting it down
We can't stop
(Outlawz)
Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not
I don't know what you've been, told
Real niggas don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep going

[Verse Three: Hussein Fatal]
Bury me with a Makaveli suit and a Mac
I've God strike me with lightning, I'm shooting him back
Skinny cause I don't work out, my man is in the gym
Long as I'm strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
Trapped in the storm
Fuck the world till I'm gone
I'm bucking at Corey Brooke he treating my niggas wrong
Until I'm gone
They gon' see who I be
I picture this bricks ducking from the penitentiary

[Verse Four: Kadafi]
See
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams its all wrong
Pop too long gone, and now 18 I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in the zone
Protect my thrown pal like a king, Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Living life as a Don, Guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton

[Verse Five: Hussein Fatal]
Yeah your boys back with the proper team
When they think I'm wearing Red I'mma rock the Green
On a whole 'nother episode
Cops never heard of ya
The otherside'll hide down the block from the murder scene
Catch ya man he dead with the Fifth
When it's hot on Nu he G-Ride from the clear to the bricks
So gangster how he switched from the clear to the bricks
Niggas hate it but they scared of the Fifth

(And we won't stop)
Outlawz!

[Hook]

[Verse Six: Big Syke]
This rap game like a robbery
Cause it seem somebody hiding me
My nigga, made a motherfucker cop a Ki'
Motherfucker ain't no stopping me
My nigga, It's Mussolini see me all in the midst
I'm still chilling like I'm bottle of Crys'
Enemies sharpen they ?
And when they see me they can give me a kiss
So I'm posing with the frozen wrists
Outlaw immortalized we survived and curst
So I claim it like I'm bangin a turf
Yeah it's easy like I'm putting in work
Not been easy you wanna jerk
Come the squeezey I'm ready to murk
Outlawz, Makaveli niggas ready to flow
So baby are you ready to go?
Outlaw my niggas be screaming at night
A Big Syko with the thug in your life

[Verse Seven: EDI Amin]
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Keep going (Keep going)
Even when the wheels fall off we keep rolling (Keep rolling)
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
It's number one at the top of the charts
Here to stay like 'Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my blood stream (Yeah)
So when I flow, I gotta do my thug thing
For the hood the under privileged and oppressed
Young nigga get rich, cash more cheques
Take the hood life
Put it on on wax
Get stakes now we living the good life
Car brand new and it shine so clean
Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
And we, sitting clean in the latest edition
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we won't stop

[Hook](2Pac talking)

Huh
But in turn busta's slippin' on it
So get up on it
Don't be an opponent
Cause this is feedin' my family
Take it away
And see me in every single place you plan to be
Don't stop

(Verse Three: Hussein Fatal)

I got 58 ways to get out of the game
But only one way's gonna fit my name
Hussein
Ride by with the block
I can't stop
Not even for the cop's will I close down shop
Yo
I broke nights to get big
Gettin' rope spot's
Hold it tight
Runnin' with fat blunts
Niggas ain't rollin' right
Temp this
I bitch this track I love rap
Senseless, relentless in every sentence but above that
Brain driller, fuckin' Fatal's a walkin' pain killer
Insane iller than caine Uzi cops, then watch 'em fear ya
Who's next?
I'm ready to check a neck in a second
Gripin' the Tek and slap' ya head because I snap under pressure
Cuttin' circulation
Stranded on the plant the earth's chasin'
Scared of probation now I'm facing death tryna hurt a nation
Burn like acid
Fart, blunts and Jurassic Park
My bastard ass click we got the strip mashin'

Chorus x2[Hook: Carl Thomas]
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Murderous mind state, can't keep my nine straight
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waitin' for the time to break
Show up and motherfuckers bow down recognize
Westside, Deathrow, Outlaw Ridahz
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well known felons, labelled for drug sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed, roll with thugs and dawgs
Commence to lettin' off rounds, then escape in a fog
Who wanna see me solo?
Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
My mini fourteen murderin' niggas while they creepin', uh
Duck or you ass out, drink till you pass out
Ain't scared to die, drunk drivin' in my glasshouse
Niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
They heard the stories nigga now they wanna really see
Bomb first my motto, it's fully guaranteed
Niggas is playa haters, label them my enemies, I'm dumpin'

[Hook: Carl Thomas]
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get
Out the window on some uptown anthem shit
I'm stressin' but ain't no pressure here, I been there before
Fugitive, task force, at my girlfriend door
Now they checkin' our my bedroom, I ain't there
40 Cals, extended clips, still, I ain't scared
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive
I'm different and I'mma prove it if it take me to die
Knew that God had a plan for me
But he won't be layin' up in my casket to doing life in the can for me
Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch
Me dyin', you think I'd let them see the joy from that shit?
Walking dead, angel spend they last days by me
New Jersey giant like Dave Tyree
Young George and Jonathan Jatt, your guns clap
Mine'll go brraaatt, soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And come through cockin' the black pound
When they put twin towers up, Pac, I'm knocking them back down
Poster child cheque, Air Force Ones with the crooked dial checks
I'm supposed to wild sex
Money and murder, is all I breathe in my life
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the devil
G ridin' with extra boxes of bullets to the nine and the shell

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Papoose]
I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in a box cuz them graverobbin' bastards
Dig your grave back up, snatched you out the casket
Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
With the 'Pac keeping the shot money, progressive
They don't really want no drama, I know you're goons
That's why I keep pressure on them like a open wound
This God-given, he keep givin' me better music
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin'
Songs are evolution, If I load your gun for you
And we bang it out at some other niggas you better shoot it
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever stupid
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless, you got the same bullets that you had
When I loaded it for you, you never used it
The Nacirema dream get ready for execution
Papoose, Fatal and Pac, the revolution

[Hook]

[Outro][Fatal Hussein]
From the bridge back to Jersey, all the way to the crib
I wear a vest from the west, stressed from the shit I did
Whether the body in a trench, and they trynna sneak the shotty in
Can't make bail in the same jail Gotti in
They all wanna murder me, bitches
So now they plot on my riches, finally they heard of me
Blast these trick niggas, fakin' jacks on the body
Killed jokers, browner than me, and you can ask Bobby
Vision goin' to prison, yeah I heard it before
Hang around the poor, put the riches on the floor
Spittin' that shit when I was locked back
Hands on the pump, make 'em jump when I cock back
You ain't real for real, you real for fake
When I'm steppin' with my weapon, we conceal the shake
And the waist lift chirl in, lost in the worldwind
My diamonds glisten value on your bitch and her
Girlfriend

[Hook: Niko]
Your hood and mine, is all the same
We're all thugs livin' in the black man's pain
I know that we can break this chain
If we come together, we can make a change

[Cormega]
Yo, I ask god what my future holds
Will I be quarterbackin' a package, in a fuckin' crack super bowl?
My sons stackin' one, private attorneys for captured ones
Indictment dismissed, the prints didn't match the gun
Rim shoppin', gem stars spinnin', 360 when d's blitz me
I'm grinnin', you see me, I'm livin'
Your mind finally injured, my ride lightly tinted
And stop sweatin' my whip, your lady might be in it
At nighttime, cruisin', listenin' to music
And analyzin' attentions of people that I'm cool with
In my hood cause I choose it, not cause I'm condemned to it
My kindness is weakness, but death if you abuse it
My contest, formed in an isolated project
Manifested alleged, think I need a sob
Next song, perfected, yo the bridge, tech nine protect it
My rap is cyphilis, the mic, a bitch that I infected

[Hook]

[Fatal Hussein]
Twist a Campbell, and round the team like Nelson Rambo
They only suit front commando, when they slippery with the handle
Cataclysm, you heard of us, get away from me nervous
He put his bond on a suit, and got his heart at the service

[Cormega]
Aiyo, I'm so ill, I wanna die like a criminal
Live deadly venom, Mega, invincible
Brain wave converter, paragraph inserter
Expert, my rap indicates murder

[Fatal Hussein]
Take ten steps, turn around, draw and drop
Mega, they die, cause they never be as raw as Pac
I got money on my mind, tyin' in my vision
Outlaw name travel pain through the prison

[Cormega]
Aiyo, R.I.P. B.I.G., 2Pac and Eazy-E
Stretch from the Live Squad, Scott LaRock from BDP
You see me in a CE coupe, watchin' TV
Yo, Fatal, you my nigga, I'mma die if you need me

[Hook]Who dat?, what?
There they go, there they go
There they go
The same motherfuckers
You know nigga it's fuckin' Friday
We doin' it like last Friday
(Niggas ain't got shit to do)
(So we gon' get fucked up)
Who dat?

[Verse 1]
Bert and Hussein, back to back now that's flammable
Smokin' ya brain, attack the track like we some animals
Mechanical, live wire jaw, rap cannibals
Fire force survive behind bars, like we unhurtable
Swervin' through Jerz emerge and serve you don't deserve to pull
Another breath of oxygen
Has is known for oxin' 'em
Kool Kas' chrome be droppin' 'em
Killa Kane be lockin' Philipane
Drip from a toxic tongue
Get done wid it
Out of control like we begun wid it
Bricks explode, licked you out the show
That nigga Bump did it
I block, like Murdock, army fatigued and
Bout to store blocks an' Fort Knox ya minor league shit
Breathe this, ballistic, shell like Khadafi
Bringin' the blizzards when I make bail you can't stop me
In jail all that I can see provoking hell
Chokin' at a third rail velocity
Obviously ya men have, been barkin' up the wrong tree
Microphone strong deep bomb first
Ya mind burst within a rhyme verse
Dirty Bert rehearse the worse of me
The black clip's burnin' me
The cat who act fraternity
The landscape's redded
Fuck it ya man said it
Ya shoulda never let it escape
We won't wet it
Squeezing, leavin holes in ya crew
Maestro can stand through
When I pass the Mac to Rock that nigga brand you
When I pass the Mac to Rock that nigga brand you

[Hook]
Ten out of ten
No ya chance is a ninth
We do jail wid no bail
Losin' half of our life
Livin' the life of the poor
Losin' sight in the war
You can slice it down precise
Shit's trife around the board

[Verse 2]
We in this thing together
Tryna build the same cheddar
It's strange sometimes I think paranoid clutchin' my waist
A fake couldn't relate to
Drugs and honeys
My hugs are funny
And thugs blow slugs for the money
Gunshots, mobbin' up quiet late nights
Walkin' down New, you betta think twice
This shit ain't right
It's all wrong
NARC's we slide on
It ain't safe season
Say it's strength in numbers
We rolled the whole precint
Rev the whip up
We live '98 stick-ups
Loadin' clips up
That flimsy ass vest we rip up
New Jerz, come check us
But don't test us
Oppose, we throw holes in ya Lexus
Act whatever, clap whatever
When we clap we clap together
Leavin' you cats on the stretcher
O.N.S. and the Embassy
Outlawz and Pentagon
If it ain't that
It ain't shit to me
It ain't shit to me

Hook

[Verse 3]
Fake lies, close ya eyes
Nigga die in the dark
You little hip hop cop
Playin' spy in the park
We turn schemes to cream
Cause we fiend for green
Wid the cops and streets watchin'
Ain't no need to dream
Codine my team
Full beam on ya knotty
Killuminati to ya body
Got mooned wid the shotti
Getto star you for Amaru
Yak see you tomorrow
I know you here
These other niggas be like where are you?
The Henny'll start you
Dirty ever semi I borrow
No confrontation or quarrel
I can't shake up or startle
The time taker
Tying 'em up like Ron Baker
Here to shake and break 'em down
Like the LA Lakers
I see through 'em
Ain't no tellin' what I'mma bout to leave through 'em
While he lay there I stay there
While the paramedics'll breathe through him
Squeeze through him
Put the E to him, hit 'em up
He gon' lay there shakin' waitin' for y'all to pick him up
Ya outta there
Quick as you squeal, I'll appeal
It's kill or be killed
In this world of free steel
Every crew's a game
Wearin' blues is strange
From how you move you'll be named
For what you doin' who you claim
You might, think it's a game
From bein' critically acclaimed
A war winner for pitiful game
Fuck wid Hussein

[Verse 4]
From cops got our feet tired
Everybody split up anybody get caught
Son just keep quiet
These C's watchin' me
Two CDS' of armed robbery
Terroristic bread and possession of stolen property
Keep to myself that's how I got to be, cats acknowledge me
For the simple fact I live everyday of the week periodically
Premeditated robberies, how could you possibly
Mistake Imperial S for a mental or methology
I'm realer than the cats that shot at me
I think I'll probably, ride by and let 'em sample the varieties
My hollow ain't easy to swallow
Like them five dollar bottles
Kill or be killed's my motto
I do it cause I got to
I'ma, straight up commodity
I thug in this society
On the side ah me's my niggas that'll die for me
Would you ride for me?, or get rode on?
Been in this game so long
I kick slick shit in every sentence
Y'all have to grow on
Throughout my hard times my vision was blind
Hustlin' dimes fake niggas wanna beef wid me
I ain't puttin' it in my rhymes
You ain't worth it
Wid out contact I catch perfect
Had the heart in front of the crowd
But in your eyes you nervous
Now start chirpin'
The .38 special start squirtin'
Leave two holes in ya shirt
And put you on the side street hurtin'
Now that's for talkin' out ya person
(Muthafuckaz)
Fuckaz

[Outro]
Fatal Hussein, Fatal Hussein
Aiyyo, (recognise)
Tell somebody come get me
(O.N.S., Outlaw)
If not I'll be home in like 5
Hahahhahha
Motherfuckin' Friday
(Tick like time)
For all y'all niggas that wanna fuck wit me
Before my shit come out
It's about to drop too bitch
(Y'all don't know O.N.S nasty new)
Hey Ric where the fuck the Henny at
Three hundred and sixty motherfuckin' three days in the Waker
Ahaha, yo fuck that calender
I ain't for that shit.....
Yo A-rock man
(Moddy Bang)
It's on for them niggas
(Killa Black)
Killa Black.....[Tame One]
Wait'll niggas hear that Tame and Fatal got down and made it straight
From Uptown with six sacks and this track that's in the background
Stop stressin from the chest up, we messed up
Off that best stuff that fits up in yo' Dutch
Situation like this, you get blown to bits
Fuckin with this Brick lyricist, more complex than the Pyramids
Here it is, Strictly Biz like small print
In between them bong hits, we drop the strong shit
Chickenheads say, "Who him?" with fucked up Timb's
Knotty fro and baggy denims, spendin up the Benjamins
In city tenaments, the Boom Skwadron odd man
Don't give a fuck like Rodman ("What are you doing?")
With no rings like Patrick Ewing ("What?")
Still I play hard regardless
Acquitted from the charges throwin darts up at the heartless
Aimin for your brain, Tame One, one of the darkest
Brown like the chocolate, poppin your metropolis

Chorus: Fatal Hussein

Around my way, all they do is shoot dice all day
Escapin secret indictments, gettin nice all day
Don't let em fold ya, Outlawz, the Getto Star soldiers
Give this letter to the President, before this shit is over
(repeat 2X)

[Fatal Hussein]
When Hussein aim, puttin they brains on walls like Tame name
Blastin these motherfuckers cause they just can't maintain
Y'all plain Jane's gel in the ?Well's? county of Sing-Sing
Me and Young Noble, got em strung hold em for hostage
Lyrics verbally toxic, spit like doubled edged optics
My shit is milk, wearin silk shirts with chocolates
Y'all broke and can't cop shit, I get, physically fit
On some evil eye ready to die shit
This Thug shit, niggas get beat down and shot up
I saw this one nigga, get stolen on and your soul got up
Stolen car, roll past the bar, toured a lot of city
Gave him an eighth and he cooked his whole product
It's a shame how you cowards change the game for narcotic
You don't get it, don't got it, the love of money get exotic
If you old you get shot at, and can't walk the streets
Without gettin your lil' money hungry soft ass spot

Chorus

[Fatal Hussein]
We adapt to the system like ?Eddie Bap? on mission
Get an ounce of izm, two six-packs, and kid listen
Just a dip on the task, my little niggas on the ave
Do a bid and laugh, come home and cop a half
Hit me with twenty hundred, what you got was fronted
Now run it, I got this fuckin drug spot where I want it
So don't be dissin new, when you ain't got shit to do
Five thousand dollars, charge free, right out municipal

[Tame One]
Niggas get played off to the left like they was southpaws
Toss you to the Outlawz, then let them shoot it out
For what you clock for -- got more than you expected
When I inject correct shit, it gets hectic
Fuckin comin up with that next shit, Thug niggas and bugged niggas
Luce? steel is tight, I'm straight up like midnight
We burn mics on turnpikes, we swervin through the lanes
We throw chains at bitches, it's back to New Jeru to get these riches

Chorus(Hook) Mr. Probz 2x
Where I come from (Where I come from)
Only the streets know (Only the streets know)
We live and die, stand by the cause
You gotta make it on ya own

[Willy Northpole]
Willy get the bakin', I'm Troy Aikman, it's Ballerstatus
Whether legal or ductapin', I gotta have it
Willy stranglin' beats, your career is hangin'
See it's danglin' feet, I'm disturpin' the peace
Got the urge of money in my sleeves
Hood dreamin', I'm schemin', gotta eat
Willy bout to crack blow, not smokin', it's dat flow
Big Lou, Probz and State Quo
Get low, get down or sit down
Any beat that I'm on, I zone, I Chris Brown
Any city I'm in, I throne, you kids ground
Some niggas ball, some lil niggas Bow Wow
Some niggas spar, some other niggas pal-pal
I do it the wild ways; you do it for Childs Play
Chunky ass niggas, so-unlucky ass niggas
Your hoes wanna fuck me ass niggas

[Killah Priest]
I'm from the slums where niggas squeeze guns
Police often come, homicide, mama's traumatized
Guns aimed at the skies
Kool G armor wit the llama on the thigh
Bang shots near train stops
Cocaine's chop for profit
Then came the Prophet in white garment
But we can't see him really because of the projects
Its nonsense, police charge us wit revolvers
Fiends noddin' on the apartment's right across the street
The police departments
They rush us, we squeeze at the sergeants
Brooklyn bullpens, no cushions, blood gushing
Thug's lookin', drug pushin'
Niggas who spilled crack while givin' you dap
Niggas pointed to the floor revealin' their gats
Dog, cat and a rat, the morgue casket, funeral's packed
The usual, black suits, veil, fall from their hats
You can be the one in the delivery room
Or the one in the visitin' room, under the mystique moon

[Stat Quo]
I am the reciter, sent from God to inspire
The writer of writers, stack ki's till the fire
My desire to acquire a position much higher
Still speak the truth tho I'm surrounded by liars
Keep it movin', lames shootin' at my tires
But my heads in the clouds, I'm flyer
Dead fish is my attire, King himself I'm sire
Hoes admire, eh, they enquire
Supplier and buyer, hip-hop's Richard Pryor
I'm no joke, folks sleepin' on Stat, they got the itis
Write so much you think I have arthritis
My voice is a quiet riots
Since the truth is transparent can't do nuttin' to hide it
Rep for my foes when I open my eyelids
And when revolution come I be standin' beside 'em

[Doitall]
I'm from a G state, where the G's are great
You can find me in the Brickz wit the shoes and lace
Cuz I be trip on you niggas but I don't need the case
One .9, one deuce, watch you fools get ate
Mr. Brickz, Mr. Doitall, I'm all over the place
I'm in the back of the Jeep ride wit a cup of grape
I know a couple gon' hate till I unleashed the eights
I'm from where a deadman walk, pick ya funeral place
I know the headman talk, but he a lil too late
Bitch, Mr. Brickz in here, make you fall to ya face
I'mma God and stay great, like its cognac straight
And I still don't trust a bank; I keep the save in a safe
If you against where I'm from, that ain't the safest place
We got them avenues and blocks, have you jumpin' the gates
Have you testin' ya faith, have you yellin' "WAIT!"
Jersey I rep it, but you can tell it on my face

[Big Lou]
I'm from the home of the 'DC Sniper'
8 Miles without Mekhi Phifer
Surrounded by criminals and lifers
That'll take the life away like diphers
I'm from Camden, the streets of the Bone Collector
That'll dug up ya ancestors
Kids stick plastic locks thru school metal-detectors
For protection cuz the teacher is a child molester
The best investor was the Mayor of the City
But the goons in his committee was buffoons
They got 'em lookin' all pretty, but fuck 'em
I know cats that wanna slump 'em and trunk 'em and dump 'em
Cuz the Mayor snitched on niggas that use to trust 'em
And in my ghetto killers take shots but it ain't on metal
Correctional armour metal, the shots from the beretta
Read another article, they cut a man into particles
For tryna play the game like a carnival
Till we got out the pocket without callin' an audible
Now his body is the size of a portable
Television, this shit is horrible

[Hussein Fatal]
Hey! You gotta make it on ya own out here
So if I'm RIP before I slip, I got the chrome out here
Ain't no second guessin' a sucka for a killin' in no time
And I guarantee you the walk is not a riddle of rhyme
I'm from the home of David Tyree, we catchin' that rock
But then the sins on time, I ain't stressin' that block
I'm gon', prrrr.... faster then Mickey and Lisa
Barber pitchin' ya starvin' tryna stick to these streets
I'm Harley, eva seen out there
Unless you catch me off my Outlawz shit but then I'm green out there
And even tho I got my team out there
I'm still on my own Grand Hustle ground like J.G. out there
Yeah.. when it's peace I'mma wear my gun
And that's word to Killa Kadafi know where I'm from
When they see me they know where I come from
Nigga cuz where I'm from? Homie the streets know I wear my gun

[Sha Stimuli]
We so backwards, that we measure the realness of a city by how many get killed in
I was a born in a building where I saw the most wonderful children
Growin' up wit drugs and drama instilled in and I'm still here
Braggin' callin' Brooklyn crazy is my home
Where you can get shot for an iPhone
Reachin' 25 is a milestone
We love to say we come from a wild zone
The flatline sound like a dialtone
It's sad but it's true
Ol' Dirty Bastard comepared it to a Zoo
We already knew if you escaped crack and heroin the folks wanna mug you
You didn't sell to feed ya self, then the hood ain't gon' love you
You made it out and went to college all you do is gon' say "Fuck you"
You get some chips and push ya whip or two they prolly gon' slug you
You can't win, I don't step wit no sex
But I'm pressed to protect where I rest in my head low

[Tha Advocate]
Geah, ayo welcome to the East Coast where you keep ya heat close
If you wonder bout there bread they might squeeze toast
G's quote a street oath to live by and keep close
Streets leaked wit needles and kilos
Of cheap dope, we need hope, but see yo
There's somethin' about being broke
That makes you appreciate the little things that be so
Minimized our bitter lives, makes us epitomize
Bigger rides and cribs wit five floors full of shit we buy
Look at my life, look thru my glasses
Look at my past - it's littered wit bad shit
But shit whose isn't? Stress infects the city
If you bare your arms you'll see Essex is grizzly
Me, Stat, Lou, Sha, Priest and Willy
Doitall, Mr. PRobz made an anthem like a milli
Chant if you feel me, cuz Jersey is in the building
This is where the fuck I'm from, now bring in the singing

(Hook) Mr. Probz 4xVerse one
I blow'em over wit the club scene
Try don, for my nine thousand thugs
In the clubs, that love green, one step
Behind Hussin, dogs the don, me and I'm
Well bomb on ya kind, like Vietnam
Against all odds, get cha Benz or rocks
Me and kada, go against all fog
Dog from jeerz, infotrate all herds
My last words, who gone blast and serve
They told me never say never, but I never stay alive
Hold me, look in my eyes, say I'm never gonna die
Blast pass, ya half ass, staff like Cassius Clay
Pass the tray, pound gripped wit the satin
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care, of my heartless strap
Hung over from Hennessy, wit a menace in Tennessee
To creep like, burglars hurdling all you suckas in the industry

Chorus
I know the rules, you all tryin' to change'em
Cuz, you a star, wit ya video models you be frontin'
At the bar, me and my thuggs in back, sippin Yack
Relax, tat it down, jus dyin' to go out wit macks

I know the rules, you all tryin' to change'em
Cuz, you a star, wit ya video hoes you be frontin'
At the bar, me and my thuggs in back, sippin Yack
Relax, tat it down, jus dyin' to go out wit macks

Verse two
It get's hectic yall, switch the rules
Get cha tools, my motor for runnin' down cuz
Ya bitch inproved, reelected as any, as respected
Outlaw Glocks, got it locked, wit all these blocks connected
From the east to the west, back home wit tha vest
Seen it all and still ball, a dog you can't impress
Cores ya soul, wit this gold mic molest
When I blow'em ain't nothin' less, drinkin' in front of ?
Don't get prayed over and laid, picked from bein' pounded
Tha 41. wit the quick flip speed rounded, clothes you identify
Bitch made niggas, I got a point
I'm out ta minimize, down goes ya squad and ya C.E.O, to
Step in the streets, steadily infectin' ya crew
He betta act, or get smacked, wit the ten mack two[echoes]

Chorus

Verse three
Secerts of war, we bust if we must plus
And handle business, when you jealous playas
Fuck wit us, turn the party out
Soon as they whip the lime beocardy out
It's all we out, been up all night, when the guards be out
Call me out, picture perfect life, when I live it
Run ya part of town like Emmitt, only five minutes in it
Militant minded, combined wit a sentence
All you fake thug niggas, ya crimes ain't constant
Even po-nine, they give me mine from a distant
My chain dangle, hold the Henny on a strange angle
Aim and bang you, who the fuck you tryin' run ya game to
It's crunch time, I'm servin'em when it's lunch time
Give me mines, stealin' ya ho, and I'll throw just one rhyme
Yall niggas squealin', my thuggs is still dealin'
Got niggas hittin' the ceilin', on them fiffty story buildings
Clack back the strap, give me that wit the equipment

Chorus

To all my thuggs, all around the muthafuckin' county nation
World wide, keep on sittin' in the back, wit that Yack
Keepin' it real, yall know who it go dowwnnnnnnn
Fatal dog once again, for my outlaw niggas
Keep it comin', none muthafuckin' stop
Kadafi rest in peace, my nigga 'pac rest in peaceFatal (Talking):

Hey, hey, you ain't no Outlaw
Get em'!
Ya'll niggas is hoes

Chorus: Fatal and (Young Noble) (repeat 8x)

Is you an Outlaw? (I'm an Outlaw)

(Fatal)
I went from Dirty Bruce man to Hussein, Its a two game table
Fatal i'll run up with my gun up, try to shoot tanks nigga
You dont want it when I cock the pump, cock and dump
Let off at ya shots and lump, I gots to dump
Shoot from jail, block ya bump
If I fell off, I caught on and forgot to jump
Sheech ya man, he'll never speak again
Greet ya fam, ice grill heat in hand
Whats the deal?, real niggas tuck the steal
Bust to kill, big bends is up the hill
Locks it down, take it when I cock the pound
Rock ya town, and roll when the top is down
Is Pac around? I dont know, Kadaf was found
One in the head, dead on the project ground
If its on then its on, we rape beat breaks
Outlawz! they wanna be us on a fake we takes

Chorus (Repeat 8x)

(Young Noble)
Apply pressure like pliars, whatever my kind desires
It ain't hard to find us, we even started as minors
Put the bullshit behind us, we movin forward
Eat cheese and get you killed, and whoever you wasn't caught with
Signing statments, now I'm flying places
Denying that you hating, thats the way that ya go
How did I know?
Look at what the game done to me
Mother-fuck the world cuz we grew up (???), trust me
I stay dusty like I live down in New, I'm used to
Fell off the block now we're selling out stores
Yelling Outlaw when we riding down you street
Niggas think that Pac gone that it ain't no beef
You fuckin dickhead, Outlawz spit lead
And tonight, when you come home I'm gon be laying in your bed
So when you put your key in the lock, make sure your heat cocked
You was scared when he was alive, but now you gotta face Pac, its on

Chorus (Repeat 8x)

Sicker than same faces, Hussein case is not to
Be forgot, nigga ask Pac who shot you
Last block I got you, burnt it up on ya'll
Can I stop you?, c'mon dogg, I turn it up on ya'll
Little homo thugs and thats word to Kadafi
I spit at Mobb Deep, had to holla at Junior Mafia
Toured with Yak, watching fake niggas spit out
Ignored the eyes, told them jake niggas "get outta here"
Hit em with that, I diss ya'll and stand in the jects
Handiling techs, lick off and hit your man in the neck
And you was next, you ran so I spit on your back
My daughter a firebug, so she sit on the mac
Stop with your job, I cock and put my Glock in ya eyes
You think I'd be sitting in the county if Pac was alive
I'm illa than that, Outlawz is realer than that
If ya wifey be feeling Hussein, then I'm feeling her back
You ain't no Outlaw

(Fatal talking)
Watered down ass nigga, Bitch made nigga
Suck a dick!

Chorus (Repeat 8x)

(Fatal talking)
Uh, Outlaw!
Operating Under Thug Laws As Warriors!
What? ya'll niggas thought we forgot!
We still together! Outlawz forever!
This is ressurection shit!
We gonna keep on riding!
Get down!
Liutenant will mash on you fake ass niggas!
Where you want it?!
Wherever you go, you got it comin, its smothered!
We got the game in check![2Pac]
Outlawz keep that rough shit
Outlawz keep that rough shit, baby
Outlawz keep that rough shit
Outlawz keep that rough shit, baby

[Fatal]
I'm down for mine, did it for Pac
Spitted the block, commited to Yak
And faithfully, we splitted the block
What did y'all do for em? forget the hunnies
You ever rob a spot with my dogg and split the money
I chose to rise, sacraficed, chose to ride
Controlled the nine and never once closed my eyes
Sometimes I feel my own doggz got me trapped
But I'll kill one of you cats, so it must not be that
Rap from scratch, with that local nonsense
Finish em and (?) about the coastal confrence
Fake thug type, my doggz barking up your lessons
Its been three years, you still talking over records
I'm the Don, Hussein's the dime
You came to bomb?
You still sniffing coke, thats the real weak line

[2Pac]
Outlawz keep that rough shit, baby

[New Child]
Thug life is who's?
Niggas done broke the rules
Now my niggas got to act a fool, bust the two's
Since Pac left, haters wanna step on toes
Some niggas get they casket closed, little hoes
Keep your mouth shut and eyes open
Eastsiders, Westsiders, Southsiders
Outlawz keep their guns smoking
All my niggas ride, down to bust
It's suicide when you fuckin' with us
In Pac we trust
I'm venomous
When you hear me bust, niggas chin em up
All of us can spit it
Got it once, you can still get it
Scared? nigga deal with it
Fuck a quarter magazine, never violatin my team
I'm an all out-law nigga
Founder of the city morgue nigga
Put that on my brother, you cocksucker
Whats poppin nigga, whats poppin, huh?

[2Pac]
Outlawz keep that rough shit, baby

[Fatal]
I served niggas off the 1-8-9
187's caught up in the sunday times
What the fuck you thought?
I ride for Pac, is you crazy?
(Outlawz keep that rough shit, baby)
I know
Crossed over, clap off, touch the glass
Whip out, no home, i'mma bust your ass
Pulled back the semi, sip the remi for Yak
One fifth, drip all the henney for Pac
I put it down, out of town
Don't worry you niggas
And my Brick City Outlawz will bury you niggas
Outlawz all over, we connect the block
Soldier formation, whip out and rep for Pac

[2Pac]
Outlawz keep that rough shit
Outlawz keep that rough shit, baby
Outlawz keep that rough shit
Outlawz keep that rough shit, baby[Intro Ja rule]

Holla back you bitch ass niggas

[Verse 1 Ja Rule]
Yo, cock sucka', I get squat and post and cocked tha nina'
In tha five series beamer, dump and lean ya
I fell off on a misdemeanor, ride red over black madina's
Take crazy for genuis, hated like Jesus Christ
My weakness have always been bad bitches
And new bills with krisis', my thesis more than extrordinary
And that nigga that got shot nine times can tell ya that I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, god may I ask yo' permission to take his life
This is a man be "I" N-C to R-U-L-E extrordinary, one for tha ages
When then sawed off with tha front of them gauges
To engage in combat
To send you and 'fem' where yo moms at
Motherfucka you hear that
And I ain't talkin about them heaven from skies
I'm talkin' about them fire from nines
Or maybe the fifty cal. cause you like five-oh
Or maybe somewhere in Cal where you like to lay low
You bitch made, and I heard about that bitch
You be slayin layin up with, some where off of Sunset

It's Murda (yeah)
Hussein Fatal nigga (It's Murda)
Muthafuckas...
Rule' these niggas crazy, reppin' him without me
"A.I" ain't in tha click, believe they won't win without me
Yo, I'm small lil' homies, frail but bold
Went from base to some bullshit like "Jalen Rose"
Got my blind D-O-G's readin' brail and coats
Keep tha heat in tha winter I can't tell it's cold
Clean my set, pieced out flame tha tec
Throw shots out niggas catch like "Wayne Cherbet"
Son of a gangsta, Talk dirty son I'm a bang ya
I'm tha truth with tha ox, keep gum on tha banger
Hussein, the only reason hoes chase tha thugs
Nigga blade part two I got tha taste for blood
Log on Fatal.com, see fatal drop bombs
More militant minded then y'all faded with 'Pac rhymes
Clucthing tha stick beam, suckin' tha stick green
Out tha window or tha sunroof, buckin' tha sixteen
You ain't a gangsta 'Em', this is gangsta shit
And "50" you ain't nuthin' but a gangsta bitch
"Pac'" would have never did no song with no wanksta snicth
He confusin' ya'll he ain't tha shit
We sex, money and murda you niggas
Ain't no playin' around with this rap shit
Banana clip, mack's spit bodies rap up in plastic
This tha city where tha skinny niggas die (no)

It's a letter to my homeboy, it's my dog. You know what I'm talkin' 'bout, it's my dog
Since the air ways been clear for like ten years, I thought I might write him a letter

[Verse 1]

Dear Pac, I shed a teardrop, missin' you and Yak for years
You changed my life man, I wish you was there
That night up in the MGM Grand, can't undastand
They gang bangin', nobody had a gun in they hand
Shot you down in the streets like President Kennedy, and we still pourin' out henessey for your memory
Setcha calmed down, Malik gettin' grown now. Resemble E.D.I a little bit, but he got his own style
Roddy shot Yak, Mu took the shahada I had another baby girl and I named her Assata
Her middle name your last name, her family tree. I can't help but think where we would be
Out on Crenshaw, Slauson', flossin' how we used to. Ridin' down sunset, bangin' the Juice Crew
Everybody takin' your songs and remixin' 'em. Mixtapin' are them joins so we don't get chips from them
Haters still hatin', I can't get no air play. It's rumors that you still here, but that's just here say
Snoop ain't reachin out to us, neither is Suge. He catchin' slack over your murder, so he ain't doin' good
Noble and E.D.I still on the grind, Keishia doin' her thing and Nuttso keep it real all the time
Niggas miss you with them Sunkist sodas and all your jokes. The older brother I never had, nigga, the dope
The greatest of all times, actin', rhymes, politically speaking,no silly ass punch lines
Treach took it hard when they murked you, brought us closer together, though, since now he a part of my circle

[Interlude]

Nigga we miss you. Straight up. I know I can speak for all the homies on this side. We all miss you. And it's more than just a song, my nigga. Cause that ain't 'bout nothin'. We did 400 of those in one year, ya heard me?

[Verse 2]

Ain't nobody lookin' out, I know they all hated you. I wonder how shit would've been if you'dve made it through
I can't believe they got you, you know how me and Yak do. I would've rolled out on them niggas before they popped you
And everybody feelin' us, but ain't feelin' the pain. I'm up against all odds, but I'm still in the game
What's wrong with these poo putts, how's it all over? And I'll come out squeezin' if I can start it all over
Tha mainstream ain't feelin' the laws, it seem weird now. We don't get the spins like before, cause you ain't here now
Only God can judge me, but tell that to these niggas. Learned one thing from Death Row, and that's how to read niggas
But now I'm back home on the east coast. They know I'm 'bout that thug life, so I keep my heat close
At least most wanted, niggas like us don't live too long, that's why I had to put this pain in this song
And if nothin' else, tell Storm, Yak, Gade, and Big, I'll see 'em soon but for now, later my nigg

[Outro]
Pac, I miss you nigga. And we still mobbin' out here for all ya'll. One love to all y'all niggas[Intro]
Uhh
Dizzy Wright nigga

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I told my mama this is me until my dying day
I'ma educate roll this weed and I'mma fly away
I'm blunted keep it three hundred I done found my place
This sound the fake is all around my way
But I just keep to myself that ain't no harm is it?
I'm about my business so I keep niggas at arms distance
These niggas iffy, money make a nigga move quickly
Couple dollars and now he want to go and hit this city
No way he strugglin but that money speed on getting bitches
Spending your gas money on different mission
This niggas fool these bitches pimpin niggas
Y'all got the game twisted, better decisions when I'm living
Get it my own I can't be sick
I'm testing my awesome ability surrounded by positive energy
My nigga the industry is fucking letting me down
I'm looking around like damn, these are idols?
People faces with these titles ain't no point of sticking around
Nigga I'm out, nobody teaching game

[Hook:Dizzy Wright]
Ain't nobody teaching us the game
So we had to learn the game on our own
Judging body teaching lesson bout nothing
I can't even tell my right from my wrong
Ain't nothing natural everything is in the back
One day if we speed it the last of time
So I'm working harder cause I did it god damn it
If I just let time just pass me by
Nobody teaching us nothing

[Verse 2: Capo Young]
Yeah we know too much to try to hole out
Holding on your flash it can't even let your soul out
I share sal and crasper, those who took the whole route
I wonder if you see some shit that day
Babies know what that about
But I ain't trying judge cause I din't do my dirt
But I'm just speaking up cause I I don't wanna see you hurt
Let me tell you bout my dreams
Cause I don't see the worst
From Malcom X murder too me inside the Hurst and
We just think we need a resolution
And salve a dick that we ain't solved a shit
Where we've been shooting
You want your chance and your whips shit
Get when you ride
But can't take none of the witch when you die
Gotta get back on my soul, gotta stay up on my mind
Gotta do me cause this niggas they pay a fee to see me be weak
I got my passion in my veins my God is all my soul blunt
Roll riding raps is our struggle

[Hook:Dizzy Wright]
Ain't nobody teaching us the game
So we had to learn the game on our own
Judging body teaching lesson bout nothing
I can't even tell my right from my wrong
Ain't nothing natural everything is in the back
One day if we speed it the last of time
So I'm working harder cause I did it god damn it
If I just let time just pass me by
Nobody teaching us nothing[Makaveli as Spoon]
I'm kicking... I'm kicking. And you gonna help me

[Tim Roth as Stretch]
Get the fuck out of here

[2Pac as Spoon]
I'm serious. I mean...
We don't even get high off the shit any more
We just do it to keep from getting sick

[Intro: E.D.I.]
These motherfuckers wanna know why.. why we get high?
That ain't a dumbest question I ever heard?
Check it.. listen..

Some people ask why (that's why nobody give a fuck, why?), why we get high... (high)
Doctor give me something for this pain, I need some Novakane (what you call it?)
Stimulate my brain (brain) escape to a higher plain (plain)
Hennessy, Ty weed, it's all the same, we call it Novakane (what you call it?)

[1st verse: Kastro]
Now we fall, it's my world, it's still spinning
Bent back wondering if GOD will let me in, in the end
All my life had been a constant fight
With the evil and these people ain't tryin' to see a nigga do right
Why is that? I can't shake this monkey on my back (back)
All that black clout, follow a nigga where im at
Now isn't that wild? (wiiiild) of course
I'll die and live my life high, deep inside im lost
And this show is showing, my people knowin' I'm dead
Walkie-talking to my homies wit' a bullet in my head (bullet in my head)
Still breathing, all my real G's leaving
Me, no choice, but to feed these demons
With murder and liquor in the mist drama niggas never heard of
Twist it, makin' it hard, even to listen to my mama, don't cry
When it's time for this nigga to die
Call it Novakane, ain't no more pain in the sky (get high)

[Chorus 2x]
Some people ask why (why?), why we get high (high)
Doctor give me something for this pain, I need some Novakane (Novakane)
Stimulate my brain (brain) escape to a higher plain
Hennessy, ty weed, it's all the same, we call it Novakane (what you call it?)

[2nd verse: Noble]
Watchin' time pass by my eye, that's why you always see me high
From this life that I was given it's like I'm livin' to die
Pass by my old hood it's all good, but it's dry
Tryin' to stray away from crime, these niggas ridin', but they blind
Nothin' in my hood, but dope, coke and herb smoke (got that coke, nigga, got that coke, nigga!)
Blowin' out all nerves, ghost, sittin' on the curb broke
Pockets lapped out, I thought you had it all mapped out (damn..)
Too far gone to back out South on a Novakane route
In and out the system prisons be wishing a nigga visit
I'm too young for this dumb shit, Novakane make me numb quick
Lord could ya, would ya help me, this crooked world won't accept me
But I proceed to get high, so just let me
Lost in the game (damn!) Novakane go to pain
The whole world looking strange
To me, get me high, Novakane

[Chorus 2x]
Some people ask why (why?) why we get high?
Doctor give me something for this pain, I need some Novakane (Novakane)
Stimulate my brain (brain) escape to a higher plain
Hennessy, ty weed, it's all the same (what we call it?) we call it Novakane

[3d verse: E.D.I.]
I lights up a Newport
Express my true thoughts
Put it down on paper
Got a dubsack, save it for later (got that blood, nigga)
And now I'm herb crumblin'
This words stumblin' up out my brain
Get a hold of that damn thang, to release the game
It destroys my brain, but I can't complain
'Cuz best believe, when I turn out the frame, I left feeling no pain
And on that note I came to the world high as dope
So how you think I'm gonna leave when Novakane holding me?
Tightly, that's how my blunts get rolled up
Quickly, hurry and light that shit before I go nuts, hold up
Before you take a sip of that liquor (aiyo nigga, pour some of that shit out, nigga)
You best to pour some more of that shit out for yo niggas (Makaveli)
'Cuz look, I breaks bread where homies livin' the dead (deal it)
We all need this shit, reminisce, squeeze the '5th
And Jesus, couldn't deliver me from the pain (pain)
'Cuz when I called him, he told me to get at Novakane (Novakane)

[Chorus 2x]
Some people ask why (why?) why we get high?
Doctor give me something for this pain, I need some Novakane (Novakane)
Stimulate my brain escape to a higher plain
Hennessy, ty weed, it's all the same, (what we call it?) we call it Novakane

[Adlibs: Outlawz]

Verse 1
[Fatal]
Never wastin' em
Had a slug bug chasin' em
Spin em before they spun
The M-1, close-casin' em
Defacin em like county property
He'd die for me
Spittin' on your whole image, I rob you and make a mockery
Yo ya see that party by Haus Cucasimenas
Trife on that ass
Who better hit the ground fizast
Fuck that financially
Fatal stable satanically
Mash on your little stash niggas testin' the family
Play the eddie cane with your petty game
Breakin' ya un-ready friend when you fuck with who-freddy sein
Nigga dip off blood, I get that back and let the free fall
Hit ya with six shots, let you in bail ass hits off
Fatal Hussein, from the cradle to the grave
Tokin' like big Suge till every label know my name
And they ask 'Whats up with Yak and who shot Pac?
And who rode on you tryin' to test the block'

Chorus x 2

Verse 2
[DJ Paul]
What the fuck!
Those niggas bailin out of range rovers
Lucky Louisiana, lucky as a fuckin fully clothed camera boy
The cast there, hangin mother fucker sat there
Sayin now she was a tear da little homies at chess game
Dodge all my life, these niggas no good the trigger man
Fatal flaw man from another hood doin yeah

Tear Da Club up Thugs mash down on a g-string...

Verse 3
[Juicy J]
When we drop
Always keep it comin'
Make em think tough
On the block
Niggas never stop
Tryin' to run const
Out the hood, Niggas no good
Ridin' in the wood
With the game fatal hussein
Gonna bring the pain
Put the coo to your 40 brew
Brothers on the loose
Nothing new cuz we let em out
If we fight or shoot
All you hoes weak
And I know do you wanna roll
With these thugs livins
In the blood ghetto hesito foo

Chorus

Verse 4
[Juicy J]
Now it is time to get rough with the drama
Bitches you cannot escape from the heart-a
Evil scarecrow
Devil spells go
Deep in my soul
Put on my clothes
I scrip little hands and I must squeeze the whelpin'
Listen to sounds of the lit when we step in
Infamous comes from the south territory
Listen to some of my d-money poetry
Circles a trip, plus it's me smokin' ganja
Rich almost ripped tear by these on the furniture
So many soldiers are coming to destroy you
Six million sinister satanic warriors
Ill still feel drill will kill ninni-milli flama philly
I will fill the enemy with up by twenty slugs
To the mug, four more tricks in the mud quick
I want all my tear da club thugs to rip this shit

Chorus (fades out)[Benzino]
Ima smoke until I'm fried
Help me cope with the demons that I can't hide
Intuition is a gift (nigga)
If you think that a nigga did it
Hit em in the chest and keep it movin'
Or go sit your silly ass down
Dont give me no excuses that you turned your little life around (naw)
You were born into violence
You weave pain, ain't nuttin but a g thang
Anyway, you better get him 'fore he get you (get you)
Fuck around, fall asleep then he wet you
Fuck around he call the feds then they get you
And your bitch is gonna flip and forget you
Drop to my knees, Lord I'm reachin out
I'm ordain to the streets (Tell me whats it all about uh)
Kill them niggas with the clout
Eliminate these haters
Ima deal with you later
Man this shit got me fucked up (fucked up)
Right up
I gotta keep token (pass that shit)
Conversatin with the devil
Im on another level
The evil thing that men do
Off with your head if you fuckin with Benzino (fuckin with Benzino)

[Hook]

God I'm droppin to my knees (to my knees)
My Rosaries in my hand
And I'm screamin Lord please (Lord please)
Gotta take the pain away (Gotta take the pain away)
Will I live to see another day (another day)

[Verse 2]
I was, boring in heaven, raised in hell
Fightin demons off my back
Attack and kill
Chill
When murder is an option
Gotta take precaution
I'm already known, the Lord has a plan
But it's so damn hard bein honest man
And I'm stuck in my ways
So Ima blaze for life
Give these streets some praise
I know they raised me right (haha)
Jesus Christ, if my life turns upside-down
I'll sit beside you in your kingdom with your angels round
Hear the sound of your choir
All in my brain
The streets is on fire
They callin my name
Even though they caused me so much pain (so much pain)
They lace a thugged up on so much game (so much game)
The agony in extacy
People mad at me
If Judas' is next to me
End up in tragedy
Fuck it
Im destined to die young
Im losin my religion
Speakin in tounge
Im on a one way trip to death
Inhaling this pain like it's my last breath (so whats next)
Ima kill you 'fore you kill me
Fuckin with Hobby ya dead body
Your bitch gonna feel me

[Hook]

God I'm droppin to my knees (to my knees)
My Rosaries in my hand
And I'm screamin Lord please (Lord please)
Gotta take the pain away
Will I live to see another day (another day)

[Fatal Hussein]
Hussein the don
It's nothin I get there early
Cuz I stay in the mix
Could you imagine all the demons
When you stay in the Bricks
And every night I hear em talkin to me
It's like I hear em when they call me in my sleep
But I ain't tryin ta feel em walkin to me
Six million ways to die
I choose the one, thats easiest to me
So I choose the gun
And if you choose the wrong one choice
You better choose to run
I had a soul of Makaveli
When you lose a lung
Take it from me
I make niggas learn respect
Disrespect hurt but pain is when I burn a tech
And it ain't nutttin like gettin ya head slittin ya wig
And the fed find you buried with your bitch and her kids
It was rough comin up nigga, I ain't eatin
You think Im tryin to turn the tables now, I ain't beat

Im finna do this, ride it out to the end
Rest In Peace to my niggas
Makaveli the don, Killa Kadafi

[Hook 2x]

God I'm droppin to my knees (to my knees)
My Rosaries in my hand
And I'm screamin Lord please (Lord Please) Rest In Peace
Gotta take the pain away

[Benzino - talkin]
No doubt, this one goin out to my brother Porky D
Hold ya head
Rest in peace 2Pac Shakur, Biggie Smalls, Big Punisher, Big L, Freaky Tah[Intro: 2Pac]
(Are you scared to die?)
Is reincarnation
(Are you afraid to die?)
Reach the whole nation
Me murderer?
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Uh

[Hook x2: 2Pac]
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole Nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Hard words is spoken, many promises broken as if it's
Useless to hope, they got me constantly smoking
My role model was a cold bottle of O.E
Surrounded by my closest homies but nobody knows me
I pray to God it ain't easy
Half the cops in California got a hard on to squeeze me
Running through the backstreets, hopping over fences tryna shake the
Fucking K-9s, running around senseless
I'll probably be a mystery to many, but a legend to some
I've been a man for many women, but a husband for none
In case you see me out in traffic, looking nervous and high
My hands, holding my pistols will they serve us or die?
May God forgive me for my crooked ways, I didn't mean it
Knew I'd fall in love with money the first day that I seen it
Maybe now they can understand, my occupation
It's clear that my only fear of death is reincarnation

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal)]
I keep my shit on safety
I've been shooting rocks lately
Everybody dies, they nickel plates don't penetrate me
I was suppose' to be the murder first to go
Them niggas missed, grazed my wrist, I took it personal
Kato told me that I was slipping
Got his strap and started tripping
Slipped two clips on the
Table, twist an L and said "Fatal listen"
Everybody don't be missing keep your vest on baby
And you know that shit that happens to the Teflon, crazy
You ain't gotta pack a gat I got your back just keep your front line
Or we can stall that, from the Cadillac we buck the gun shots
But we locked down, don't have your back in the casket
All he thought about was plastic and murdering bastards

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: E.D.I Mean]
I spend my days and nights
Not knowing if a stray's in flight
They'll probably catch me
Leaving my foes hella' happy
Cause look, at any moment
The game could be my main opponent
Niggas be swimming where the sharks are and man they don't even know it
But I stay focused, concentrate on my surroundings
Cause if I'm slipping, well that's when niggas will get to clowning
And I can't have it, I got a mission to complete
Raise my kids upright, make sure they got something to eat
And my daily ritual is, protect my physical biz
I just can't see now, I choose death before the penal
Cause what good am I? To that little Nigga with them big eyes
If I'm incarcerated, feel me now, I gots to make it
And If I don't, Re-Reincarnation ain't an option
Leave my ass dead until it's really poppin'

[Hook x3]

[Interlude: 2Pac]
How can y'all call us murderers and shit and
Blame all the problems of the world on us young thugs, Thug Niggas from the streets, ain't that a bitch
Tell me y'all ain't giving a fuck about us when we was broke and poor
How come when we get a little money, motherfuckers wanna stop us and block us
What part of the game is that? Who should we love, who should we believe in when the motherfuckers that's supposed to be our role models, supposed to be the people we look up to is tryna snatch us out of the game
What type of shit is that? Fuck 'em all

[Verse 4: Kastro]
I still whizz for the top Dolla'
Just a true thug, with a comma
High power, small drama, made niggas
Top Drazed with a mean way to play 'em
These days, Homie I'm saying though, They tryna play me
I gots to get them, hit em and lay low
I told you before, my, only fear of death is momma, crying for help and papa tryin' to help
When I know we ain't got it but shit I gots to handle it, it's hard
They hand it to me, snitches, suspicious bitch niggas who ain't insanity
Never worry
Apparently, I think I never buried but if so I gotta go, my nigga's will always love me
Thug family ties, I know they want me to die but ima survive, see the look in my eyes

[Outro: Lemika]
And this Lemika and I'd like to give a shoutout to all the tray-whizz kids out and I'm appreciating how I'm chilling up in the studio with 2Pac and Cocoa G and uh -laughs- Okay I'm out, I'm done, I went out, Oh Shit, put this back
