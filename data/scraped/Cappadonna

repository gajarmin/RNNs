[Intro: Method Man]
Ma, Ma, throw down some money
The ice cream man is coming

[Hook: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up

[Verse 1: Ghostface]
Yo honey dip, summertime fine, jewelry dripping
Seen you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clicking
I kept shooting strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smelling like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God
Attitude is very rude boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vine's Cee Allah Rule
They call me Starky Love hon, check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple curls was done by Billie Jeans
Black Mrs. America, your name is Erica, right true
Lazy eyeball, small feet, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smelling like cinnamon
Excuse me hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again
God damn, backyard's banging like a Benzi
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spuds McKenzie
I'm high-powered put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week
Back to you Maybeline Queen let's make a team
You can have anything in this world except C.R.E.A.M
So what you wanna do, what you wanna do
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Shaolin's finest, what up boo, peace your highness
Yo I'm lounging, big dick style y'all niggas is the flyest
Moves you're making too fly jewels are shaking
Not a rape patient, you're looking good fly colored Asian
Ghettoes, them is your hometown
We can go the whole round
After that, I'm shooting downtown
I'm rocking hats and your wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes pearly black
Freaks be moving in fly sneaks
Two-finger rings and gold teeth and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square dear
You better have C.R.E.A.M. to share, Ricans, ven aqui yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Black chocolate girl wonder, shake ground like Thunder
Politic to your deficit step, gimme your number
Your sexy persuasive ta-ta's and thighs
Catch my eyes like highs, I want your bodily surprise
Double down some time, Ice Cream you got me falling out like a cripple
I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh baby I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches
Orgasm in my mindstate, masturbate in your clutches
I want you for self like wealth, so play me closely
Chicks are at each other for the sting, who want the most of me
Only a hard dozen wanna be calling me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby shopping spree you're loving
Call me if you want to get dug like the pockets
I jism like a giant, break wombs out of the sockets

[Outro: Method Man]
Wu-Tang in the cut, for real niggas what
It's the after-party and bitches want to fuck

[Hook]

Ice cold bitches melt down when in my clutch
And want their titties sucked, ice cream
Yeah, your guts

[Hook]

Ice cold bitches melt down when in the clutch
They want they titties sucked, ice cream
One love to my chocolate deluxes, keep your nails done
And your wigs tight, word up
One love to my butter-pecan Ricans for calling me Papi
That's for real
One love to caramel sundaes, with the cherries on top
Yeah and big up to my French Vanillas
Parlez vous, francais, mi amor, merci, oui oui, bon bons
And all that good stuff, that good stuff[Intro: Ghostface Killah {Cappadonna} (Masta Killa)]
It's on {Where your sparkle at kid?}
(RZArector)

[Hook: Raekwon (Cappadonna)]
Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, "Wu-Tang's back for more"
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

[Verse 1: U-God]
This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
X Y  slam Nine Diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team
America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome and split the bone
Wig blown off the ledge by the alledged
Full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts
Acapella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld totem

[Hook: (first two lines)]

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learnt how to
Fuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MCs submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python

[Hook: (first two lines)]

[Verse 4: Cappadonna]
You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravaganza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, tryna get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black jack to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LPs back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick Hip Hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son, fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over by the Method Man Jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cause you weak in the knees like SWV
Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears
In Born Power, born physically, power speaking
The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching"What you doin' on our turf punk?
[I got a message for Smokey...]
Give it...
[Are you Smokey, man?]
Give it!
[If you ain't Smokey, it ain't yo motherf-ckin' message...]
Motherf-cker, I said give me the message!
[It's from Willie, in the slam...]
Nigga, you been busted?
[Yeah, the man picked me up...]
Well I ain't got no f-ckin time to play with you. Now give me the message...
[Willie's in Warwick, doin' 1 to 3. Told me to tell y'all motherf-ckers to keep cool. He be out one way or another, quick. Maybe I can stick around for a while?]
No, that's out man. You know, what could we the lords do with a punk like you?
[Kiss my ass, motherf-cker...]
Burn him!
[Just me and you motherf-cker, just me and you! I put trademarks around your f-ckin eye...."]

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Yo, Gambino niggas who swipe theirs
Deluxe rap cavaliers
Midgets who steal beers, give 'em theirs
Sit back jollyin'
My team be gaming like Three-card Molly and
Drug Somalians pollying
Many raps they crocheting
A-yo Iron, these niggas portraying
But haven't been paying
For real, slide on these niggas like a fresh pair
Caesar fade style, usually tuck grenade
Throw a blade, fuck getting laid
Guzzle this shit like Gatorade
Day to day Wallies half leather, half-suede
Connecting with the high stylist, dun
Light up a chalice
I run with nothing but the wildest, foulest
Come on now, long-dick style
Niggas on the hit out, ay yo Iron bite my shit out
Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally
Been doing this a century kid, just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin' off by P.M
Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
Palladium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians
The greatest lesson is don't owe, you might get stole on
When I go bury me with velour on

[They come to me, and understand, just let me get mines first. Then after I
Get mines, y'all can do what y'all wanna do. Fuck 'em up bad]

[Verse 2: Ghostface]
'Sho 'nuff, hit the bank and thrust
Wu Nauticas Jamie Sommer got trained on the tour bus
We upgrade, swallow raw eggs, read the label
Hitting white-label, left the Winnebago unstable
Smooth sailing, walked in, my Earth start kneeling
Started stealing, I'm too ill, see we're grilling at the parlay
Kicked up, mack, max motion
Michael Bolton magazine quote, I'm too potent
Louisville mix pain kill rap
Fuck benadryl the violin in 'Knowledge God' sounded ill
Tremendously obnoxious, no blotches
My telephone watch'll leave bartenders topless
Dead arm the prosecutor, smack the juror
Me and my girl'll run like Luke and Laura
We sit back on Malayan islands
Sipping mixed drinks out of broke coconut bowls, we wilding

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Deep meditation sound orientated, war the blizzard
Rap paramedical the wizard
Cappadonna, never catering to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You order five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowing with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of wilding, Park Hill profiling
I cut your face a Buck 50 sure why you smiling?
For violating my position
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
Cause I'm PLO TKO every day
Dancehall General, Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna son'a old school Disco Inferno
Veteran for rapping with the new set of Wu the hard rapping
Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clapping
When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evening, I have a by myself meeting
Thinking who's gonna be the next to catch a beating
From my mental slanging, bitching rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize, all competition catch hell here
Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards

[The way I, the way I wanna get 'em. I want 'em gotten. I want 'em layin'
Out. I want 'em gotten. Cause niggas need to be got. He need to be
Taken off of here. That's right.][Intro: Force MDs]
We are the G-O-D's
And we came to rock the spot
Like Ironman Starks
They be the illest MC's, in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Beez

"From where we at to my man's cell
From where we at"

[Verse 1: Raekwon the Chef]
Say peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges
Street astrologists, light up the mic God, acknowledge this
Fly joints that carry two points, Corolla Motorola holder
Play it God, E-pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Repel all fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait, drop it like Drake
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck a union
It's the same style, RZA train a boy, jump the turnstile
On the island he tried to challenge God for the new bals
Especially that, aluminum bat in the Ac
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black
The Mac-10 flex wipe cats like Windex
Index finger be sore busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing 'em, jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem
Abusing 'em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em
Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older Gods, build with the Sun, Moon and Star

[Hook: Force MDs]
All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us

"Ghostface--Ghostface Killah!!"

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps
Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbing niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be mellow like Vaughn Harper, Radio Barber
Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Phillipines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Biochemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Blond heads, inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zoom in like binoculars, the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex, was rockless, Chef ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man no die-cast metal, I'm steel-alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen, both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes
Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

"rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell"

[Hook]

"Cappa-Cappa-Cappa-Cappachino"

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Give me the the fifty thou, small bills
My gold plate, my slang kills
My beer spills, what up lils?
Murder one dun
Killer bee stung, guess who back home son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, Papi wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, lornadoones in fat pussy wounds
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill
Check out the mad skills
Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it and keep it
Jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang sweep it
Out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten Donna too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is hand-cocked
Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot

[Hook][Intro: Ghostface]
Tommy Hill rocking ice niggas
Tommy Hill ice rocking niggas who fuck...
Mira, afrente
Take a one on one to this shit y'all
Get your nostrils clear
Come on, sniff your brains out
All my Al Capone, Al Pacino niggas
Who's down with drug smuggling
Cappadonna, Golden Arms

[Verse 1: Ghostface]
Check out the rap kingpin, the black Jesus
I know a few niggas sniff coke and caught seizures
Peace to half-moon Caesars, and all the bitches in the bleachers
Hot weather, sex on the beaches
Jewelry shopping out of the country, deluxe luxury
People saying that my chains look truck on me
But what about the Wonder Woman bracelet
Two-oh point three diamond cut engraved rubies kid, I laced it
My sweet tooth gotta nigga throbbing, ready for robbing
But first hit Maria's for a butter almond
The bionic microphone is Smack Mechanic
Move like a bunch of Mexicans with bandanas
Son it's on, so we can just max a million
I got the spot sewn so we can make a billion
The God's tropical, ladies call me black fruit punch
Rainbow flavor niggas murder niggas for lunch
Peace to the Paris Crew in the avenue, and my nigga Jay Love
Who carry switchblades on the reg, duke

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Yo, the first branch, the third leaf, whoever want it got beef
I politic, show love, crush those who dare creep
Into my realm of sunshine I praise divine
Fine line between Donna dumb, deaf and blind
He ain't mine, he shook like the faggots in daytime
Crossed over grain while we was bubbling moonshine
Sipping on a Moet, laid up, Rae-Gambino
Mastermind the plan, Tony Starks, Cappachino
Developed while your head be swelling up off of the Nation
Blinded by the ice while I release the confrontation
Donna holy fat bags of weed, ravioli
Pasta, bodyguard the killa bee songs like Kevin Costner
Infra-red all inside your bumbo, rasta
Cappadonna pimp the derby like the mobster

[Interlude: Big Un]
Yeah, yeah
Eight spaghetti lame brain ass niggas
Quarters, nickels, and dimes bitch
Except for overtime nigga
Any ass money suit me fine
Cause I'm coming strong, breaking niggas backs
Keeping shit real
If you haven't noticed bitchy ass rusty, ass nigga
Let me tell you this one time
Tony Starks, Raekwon the chef
Cappachino and Golden Arms
Is coming through mad strong
From the isles of Shaolin
For all them faggot ass
Rusty chickenhead bitches too
Shup Shup baby?

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Yo back in the days, bagging cracks, scraping plates, flipping cakes
Who them heavy head niggas hating Jakes
It be us, wall to wall soldiers, hanging in halls getting over
City niggas shoot for blood money rocking Rovers
Stay dipped, don't have no money in your pocket in the streets
Why these people mob money in they Jeep
Crack bums watch your back for jums
Cost me for a fake twenty dollar bill
Get 'em son, we ain't the one
Politicking, plus vicking, sick of these Dominicans
Eating good, had to shoot my way up out of Bennigans
That's life, to top it all off, beef with White
Pulling bleach out trying to throw it in my eyesight
Yo what the fuck is on your mind?[Intro]
These are the men who lead the crime families of America
I control 26,000 men. Except for dope, we operate in all aspects
Of organized crime. And if there's one thing I'm sure of
It's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home
In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
We eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs
In the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams
My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens
Grey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons
Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms
Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns
You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips
Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis
Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one
Donna shogun-ing flip a ton of fashion
Destination be the cash one, I step past one
Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like Eskimo floe
Cappa villain stay chilling take shots of penicillin
Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out
But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives
I'll take a few hundred thousand dollar dives
And then I still never go down
Until the last round I shine
When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'mma do mine

[Verse 3: Raekwon the Chef]
Now, where I come from cats be carrying, marrying drug money
Fuck up your wife, get four to life
Cream we handling, Midtown niggas scrambling
Move and examine the fly shit, plus quick to buy shit
Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods astral
Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule
Big time, play it like Canadian wine
RZA's divine now, the sacredness of one's true mind
Now let's get colorful like money green
High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigger roaster
Yeah God, be having my whole steez laced
Now let's rap a taste, connect dots, aim Glocks, train stop
Figaro fly jeweling, tri-color Cubans
Swerving we'll pow with Germans in Suburbans
Twenty-four niggas with vests on, my own restaurant
Dons sending my sons membership forms
And still getting this paper scraper
Fake gators from Jamaica, wizards be passing like Lakers
And it be coming from Lex Louis Rich Liberace
Fetus style and blocking goals like hockey[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (woman)]
(You my Dirty whore, you that Dirty whore)
What else you gonna do to it
But bust it, bust it though baby, bust it
Who else, who else is gonna do it
This is dedicated to all you bitches

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Knew this bitch named Trash, she had a hella fine ass
Can't ask, blew my hope in the past
Niggarette gave me gonorrhoea
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina
Boy you should have seen her
She had a baby face creamer Purinas, called up talking Tina
I put my dick in her womb
She blew my head like a balloon, I had her walking on the Moon

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
I seen you at the five and dime wasting your time
Oh you shine, I'm looking at your ass from behind
You walked by smelling like watermelon
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swelling
My nuts start yelling, excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick
My medicine is can I walk with you
Fantasy, after that we can cheat
Laid on the bed, handcuffed with hard meat Long stroke smacking, smack it then broke
Nothing can't stop my continuous poke
Compound, porno flick music
Daddy came with it when I wrote it

[Verse 3: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Dirt Dog be bouncing on bitches like fog
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch
I'm up my jacuzzi, peeping this smoothie
My bitch is a floozy
Dirt Dog ain't choosy, pussy move me
Pretty black dick up in the booty, I like it muddy and swampy
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky
Don't got no fucking room me and my momma in my teepee
Blackberry squeeze, bitch you a tease
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese
Now to blow fifty G's overseas
I'm doing the breeze, in my 850

[Verse 4: RZA]
Suicidal, she been in more hotels than bibles
Idol worshipping bitch wasn't the type to make bridle
Strung on how the bitch manoeuvred her tongue
From the top of his dick to the bottom of his ass split
I told the God to jet quick, this wicked bitch was a harlot
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web
She wasn't choosy, fucked for a movie and a loose leaf cigarette
Pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons, big ass in tight denim
Had the most faithful niggas sinning against their women
And enjoyed to watch relationships get destroyed
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void
And shameless, her attitude was blameless
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list
Her obsession caused niggas to get the ass cheek injection
The bitched lied, said she had Urinary Tract Infection
I tried to warn 'em and bomb 'em, but she conned em
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom

*woman moans* oooooh, ahahhh, ohh

[Outro: '4 Assassins' samples]
You people are all trying to achieve the impossible
That's exactly what we've done
But you'll fail and you'll all die
If we die, the next generation will fight them too
And the one after them for as long as they must
And eventually we shall succeed[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo, yo, Iron Chef, gracias
I need some of that, slide through the back
I need ya'll to come back to the, I heard juice
Back of the store over here, just be easy and tell ya man to be cool
We got some culinary cats right here, we need you we'll kill him if he fault

[Raekwon]
Aiyo, rappers steppin' to me, they want a brick son
But I'm the Chef, my price is twenty-six son
Move up, about thirty-two of those and open locker dough
Soldier got locked up, blow killed the doctor
Flamboyant police is X fives, watchin' my lofts
So many leeches I just left it and walked
My flow wicked, Miami money, movin' and ridicule
Geico on the arm froze, rose gold with me
Take baths with white women, lingerie see-through
Takin' trips to Iran, my Spanish nigga peoples
Sellin' drugs to Flatbush, call my nigga Cecil
Snub with the black gloves, on half-moon Greek do
Killed him in the Bahamas, his wife ran white van pulled up
They caught him out in Brooklyn with a white man
Slutted out, rosed out, sister was gone, she geekin'
She threw the rifle in her mouth and said good evenin'
Yup, Paul Wall grill line, be getting money, crime thief
I know her from Africa, pretty smile, nine teeth
Gold joints, frames only, Louis Vuitton, pony
Leather with the matching sweater on, you owe me

[Hook: Raekwon]
Knock the ash off the blunt, confront niggas who cunt
Swing an ax, tax niggas rhyme different from cats
Specialize in mic rippers, splashes
We the last skippers, big rocks and the block will stick

[Cappadonna]
Beefsteak Charlie niggas eat and they get fat
Chase heads up and down the block and kill rats
Skilled with the gats, even feds don't know where the shells at
The shell trapped up in nice crib with four packs
Four macs, caught a nice sale for four stacks
Yeah, me and my nigga Arafat
Gotta escape but we'll be right back, real soon
Chef cook it up, we got a date with real goons
Telling you Ghost, my connect crazy with the wet
Might know him used to talk to his sister named Yvette
I speed it up, me and the Linx, was getting weeded up
I beat it up, yeah I hit that, but I ain't seed it up
Meanwhile, back on the block, we seen two trucks
Then the windows rolled down, we see these two fucks
Soon as they jumped out, see these tools bust

[Hook]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo, I lit a boogah up, rocks is gone, so we baggin' up all shape
Binoculars, scanners, we all listen to jake
Ran out of baggies, my mouth is dry
Got them dirty joints that scatter, don't act surprised
Nah, nigga the currency rushes like popping a wheelie
Holding a pipe with one hand, the other countin' the billies
You know how it be with the peppermint Clarks, throwing darts at a hoodrat
Getting slow neck up in The Bronx
That's all me, thirty four shines, forty four lines
I just chill like Aaron Hall, writin' raw rhymes
Like, threw Kool-Aid rubies in a lemonade bezzle
When I was twelve in the church, I started packin' that metal
A deuce-deuce, my supplier was Loose Bruce
Ever since I had the drop, my instinct was to shoot-shoot
This ain't For the Love of Ray J, it's for the love of the AK
Cuz you can get scratched like AJ
Cuban Link Dynasty has emerged, this rap shit stop
I have a team of niggas moving my furs

[Hook][U-God]
I live life lavish and my chain is karats
The last name on the train to Paris
Used to be lame
Then attained the merit
So many clothes
Can't name the fabrics
Dynamics
I want the fame
And my name engraved in granites
Here's his lane
Now came to grab it
You moving sideways
Change your habits
Used to rock minks
Then I changed to rabbit
From out the garbage
I came from average
Used to be righteous
That changed to savage
Bang my ratchet like Bangkok

Nigga
Ayyo I plow down ? like I'm out for revenge
Fuck it
It seems like the drama never ends
Be in the projects
Like I never left out
Might be on Osgood
See a nigga stretched out
I can't take it
Seems like my hood is cursed
Bad niggas
I thought that the good was first
My old whore
She march with a foul parade
Don't learn shit
Til another child is sprayed
I'm out here
Fuck it
Like I live on ? and Rico
Keep a low cut like Margie
I don't give a fuck
Y'all made me bitter
I'mma whip your kids out like a babysitter
I'mma grown man
But I'm young in the mind state
Live in every burrough
But New York my tri-state
Test me
You know I brought a bitch on the tour bus
Pour piss on you, leave you stuck for 4 months
My head fucked up
I'm off my clean streak
Don't make me pick the 9's up
I come from mean seeds
My unit snitched on me
Ratted me out
They all ganged up on me
Tried to take my mouth
However the cause I'm in jail and get ?
They cut from dirty cloth
I'm cut from cement
Original ?
Got the crazy glow
Them devils tried to jump me
I'm crazy though
Absolut Vodka rat
Crush mad Goose

Black son spill gravel
Bronze Man
Oblong javelins in my cabinet

Salutations from the missile plant
Quick to the hollowpoint
It ain't no olive branch
My low-cal 4 0 cal. in the cardigan
Tempted by Satan
Put a bullet in his diaphragm
Walk around
Black clouds and quiet violins
A tire fire blends poet and violent pens
Illest skill
Got steel ? and iron winds
Uphill need a ghetto ?
Street dreams
Black ? aspire kings
For fire water veins
Still ? Listerine
They chains through to my "Roots"
No doubt
Ben Verne
On the road to riches and diamond speech
I might turn ? mountain peaks

[RZA]
Yo

My testosterone stimulate her estrogen
Whether Black, Caucasian or the Mexican
Asian
She get the message
And she coming back for sex again
Organic drugs
My natural persuasion
You under the influence of 36 invasion
Spider-man amazing
But I'm darker then Parker
Skin got abrasions from ?
Sliding down the street cold
Pull up to your party stimulated with a Jeep full
Of ? gap honeys and bottles of vodka
Plus the weed rollsss
Here we go
Mediating
Never jealous
Over zealous
Wu Tang's my fellowship
Fans mash up accapellas of our lyrics with Beatle tracks embellishes
The idea clearly that Wu-Tang forever
This way of life
Is art, rhymes and cleverness
Joined by God
No man can sever this
I complete jobs
Free and effortless
Use tiger, crane
Snake style
Plus the leopard fist[RZA]
Yeah, start wit that one
Yo, yo, yo, my acustic futuristic lingustic rap fabric
Is a mixture of Arabic sandscript in it's italics
I talk quick, y'all bitches can't comprehend my dick release spit
Wit love should I release hits
We travel through bodies like blood vessels
All y'all crab niggas try to wrestle to be on top of this pedastool
Slang doctrine, minoxin, lyrical toxin, I'm chessboxin
Words is rushin through like a herd of angry OXEN!!

[Cappadonna]
Fatal for these pussy cat niggas is dead weight
Concentrate, my murder rate excellerate, terminate
So spoil like coke in the foil
Knock knock, I shot the whole block
Electricity, flow splendidly
Internally inside of me like Tony Starks tee
I create excellency, one-sixty call L-O-U-N-G assist me
Papi wardrobe is key, roll promptly
For slang hall, vocabulary Igor, Frankenstein mind
Rewind for a minute while I dig down your track, stupid
I move quick shit is accurate, Kojack tactics
Chaos, killa bee minds, high society blackness, spread the rumor

[RZA]
My lyrical marv-el makin more cream than Carvel
Y'all niggas best to hold your weight like barbell
To my verbal swordsman school, students don't play truant
My most prudent pupil, rhyme under influence
Of alcohol and to-bacco, mushrooms imported from Morocco
Bellies on the rocks, and a twenty sack of choco
Wit forty tales and gold around the fist, bitch I carve
Glitters on the paper so my family won't starve

[Cappadonna]
I'm deep in the shit, I stay highly involved
Never inconceited, never been beated
Been trapped in many wars but not yet retreated
My style you need it, I just write to read it
It's all fresh lyric, no nothing gets repeated
I came a long way and guess what, I succeeded
I conquer my opponent, and feed him baby food
Cuz he's childish and illiterate, and ye has been rude
To the father year me, O-R-I-G
Respond to the war wit the killa bee law

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Scavenger nigga, you's a shhriimp
A full line of shhiit, my ear can digest iiit
Stop drinkin all that water, let's take it to the land
So I can Godzilla up your shit mister Tiny Tim man
Niggas be creepin up my beanstalk
When I start to come down on your fuckin ass
You tried to chop shit on up
Played my shit like parks bitch, I'm that

[RZA]
Legendary microphone's weaponary
You secondary BITCH-ASS fairies
Scary cats won't survive this verbal attack
You think you're slang can match
The Wu-Tang, EMPHATICALLY now cypher
You fake crumbs, you should be stung on your tongue
While you young guns bunge, we plunge into the grunge
Deep into the dark dungeon, we come in one wind
Nine minds combine to form the wisest rhyme force to summon
I be the quoted mathematical combination
Unloadin mysteries of life, you feel my solar wind blowin

[Cappadonna]
Just then, I came on the stage like wind
Blew slang in your face and it touch your skin
You felt chilly, just like you smoked a bag of illy
You need a coat just to protect your throat
Two pairs of socks, kid I'm cold like ice rocks
Chap-lipped duds can't fuck wit the chatterbox
Cherry heads felt the draft of the ox
Shaolin niggas won't fuck wit one block *pause*
Broke forgot about half the slang murderer
Down wit the union big street sling murderer
Terrorizin, move I'm tranquelizin
Fast getaway wit the slow speed drivin
Two miles an hour, Cappa do it wit the power
Somebody blow something, cut fool in the tower[Cappadonna]
Yo! It's the burial ground sound, Dunn!
It's real out here
Staten Island puttin chills in y'all niggas
Forever in it.. yo

My devastatin hot '97 Mentality
Keep me on point for my four-digit salary
Heavyweight lyric never lost one calorie
I'm soon to be seen, on the TV screen
Gambino Cappacino to the Afro Sheen
Stay black, where I'm at, high road to rap council
Splash love to Wu in a orderly tonsil
Never limit to the diction, cause chaos to mixin
Brutalize a sound check, ripple through the intermission
Rap's under siege, held tight like a squeeze
Forced in the world 'Donna nuclear freeze
Doing damage to the wannabe Flip Mode and Def Squad
Ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
If you dare to test thirty-six, chambers of strangers
My word of mouth it's all real wigs might peel
Livin large and in charge branch out Bon Voyage
Twenty-four diamond government named God
Alias Daryl Hill bring thugs back to kill
Circle around my son, Daryl Jr. never eatin lard
Auntie Dauntie sixteen holdin me down
AIDS of rap music may be contagious to sound
Verbal the slang pushed back to create pronoun
Method forcin J-Love to Bring the Pain from underground
Realizin food for thought is self-compromising
Shaolin cut the crack into a triple-O sizin
Blue do what he do to keep that currency risin
Hopin I catch a deal so we can catch a full wheel
Instead of catchin bodies, niggas not keepin it real
Dirtball niggas that steal cake from stores
That's my type of niggas I be wantin on my tours
Can't help it, my styles stay fat like Roseanne
Ruckus in the square I stay rough like the Clan
Panther on my arm, pen and pad in my hand
Punk motherfuckers better beware of the Shaolin
Defy interactive project Children of the Corn
Gats and my man keep em bustin till he's gone
Style so ancient it sparks just like the unicorn
'Donna come through everyday my uniform
Changes and switches, I came to make ladies out of bitches
Crackhead niggas get stitches
So what up with that kid, danger when I attack kid
Watch how the slang hits you, just like a bat kid
Form another pyramid, look how we slid
All over Park Hill, Stapleton politic
On a twenty dollar bill all in it together
You can't fuck with the stormy weather, yaknahmean?

Start the pompum circumstance music, this a graduation

You like that Spark, Donna

[Cappadonna]
Baby girl you wine like a hoola dance
You looking real nice, gotta give you a chance
I can your pussy right through your tight pants
Poppin' out your whip, girl got the right stance
How bout some Crystal, we can burn a branch
Maybe later we can take it back to the ranch
You got it going on, baby, with ya ill Prada
When it come to ass, girl, got a whole lotta
I'm feeling you, come on, roll with the Don Dada
C-A-P, all in the club, with my G-A-T
I keep a fly bitch right next to me
Lay my mack game down, and I flex my G
I'm an off-the-hook-nigga, Supermodel king
Fly girl book nigga, love the way you move ya ass
And it shook nigga, let me blow it out the frame
Girl you gorgeous, and your whole crew's the same

[Chorus: Cappadonna (Stanley Steels)]
Aiyo, this bitch is incredible
I'm try'nna get me a bedroom interview
Excuse me, ma, let ya girl get in front of you
This is Don-Don, love you with ya thong on, tell me to sign, boo
(Aiyo, that ass is exceptional
I'm try'nna get me a bedroom interview
Excuse me, ma, let ya girl get in front of you
This is Stanley Steels, and I'mma Specialist, check the credentials)

[Hook: female (Stanley Steels)]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, papi show me what you talkin' bout (yeah)
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, I got the dick-down, bedroom crown you wanna see?)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I think I like the way it's going down (yeah)
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, we can end the chat right now, tell me how it sound
Do you wanna leave?)

[Stanley Steels]
Aiyo, Steels probably king of the mattress
Luck, got the address, the pussy pimp's calling me MapQuest
She's an actress, that's why I'm leaving my signature
So I can 50 Cent me a Vivica
Listen, my seven sixty, the color of CD
Flowin' past these chicks ass looking like jelly fish
Please, ya'll won't see me riding on PB
Stomp big dicking the whip, can't you tell by the big feet
Please, I got a batting average out of the park
Every beat a homerun since Luck met with Spark
And it's probably the Latin in him
Cuz I ain't heard a mix this sick since Malone got with Shaq and 'em
That's why they call him Mr. Classic, it's never been the team
That I play for, it's the muthafucking match-up
Finesse flow, yo, the kid is immaculate
Lynn Swan of the game, that's what it read on my jacket
While ya'll sticking throwbacks to match your hat set
I'm, rewriting history, so follow the concepts
I'm out in Charm City whipping the baskets
Fuck a seat's with heat, why you ask for my arm rest
Luck and Donna, we the reason them chicks press
We blame it on features, ya'll base it on sneakers
Listen, dick game like Pole Position
All I do is bob and weave, once I'm in them jeans
And you can guarantee Luck is high quality
Like I'm Kweli and Hi-Tek, the sonic text
Please I caught my bi-chicks baking they eggs
Because's the mixtapes better, plus the two go together
Think about it, I'm a hot sex sizzler
Beat the cat flipper, breakfast is served
And you can get ya back ripped up
Homey tell clip's up, I move with the curb

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Chorus][Intro: Cappadonna]
Ahh... the outdoors, the fresh outdoors
Word up, it's a beautiful day
Bout to go poli' right now that's my WORD
Aiyyo

[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
Aiyyo call me a cab it's the Razor Sharp kid
Dipped everyday my style is po-lit'
I'm out to the Mansion I gots to catch Ghost
I'm headed to the club tonight, we need toast
For that wack ass MC, talkin all the shit
I know we can't wait just to get his wig split
It's war with the Gods this year, represent
The bitch-ass niggas keep tryin to repent
But we still lickin off, we wild like two cent
Park Hill Projects, say it witcha lungs
Fuck y'all cats, we always got guns
But just in case, we get drunk and can't drive
We gotta fuck somethin up, dead or alive
Y'all comin with us, we live on the other side
Of the chart, where your mother met Poppa Wu

[Chorus: Tekitha]
Black boyyyeee, in the ghetto streets
Black boyyeeee, no more suffering
Black boyyeeee, shine the light for we
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
After the tour I came back for more
Comin correctly, just like before
Wu-Tang Forever, I was just a pirate
In the rec room regulatin with Osirus
Deep thoughts, I don't take no shorts
Minds on lease like expensive imports
Elevate the seed, no lust or greed
Livin life long time may continue to breed
Never gettin caught up inside the agencies
For ten long years, but I paid my fee
Now I'm on the frontline with W.T.C
Back me down these streets are still ill
From Brownsville all the way down in Park Hill
Pack with the beef cause niggas won't chill
Cats smoked out like chicken on the grill
I'm takin this shit way back to Bill Bill
In the projects where my man got killed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Donna Camay, rockin witch'all all night
Used to be a little stressed now I'm gettin it right
Fresh kicks with the gold watch dipped in ice
From Shaolin, it's the vanglorious man
When the world go around these things start to happen
Wifey in the kitchen, brother still snitchin
Bloods accumulatin, we gettin impatient
Knowledge and Wisdom, teach the understandin
That's how I'm plannin, blow up like a cannon
Pull my man in, hit y'all again
Now I make sense, we do this for the rent
Build with intelligence break your defense
No hesitation, time gets spent
Some fall victim, others get bent
Some recognize, real niggas represent
I can't never stop til my heart is content
Puttin in the work til I feel confidant
Blast out darts in the Wu basement

[Chorus] (2x)

[Kung-Fu movie sample]
Hahahahahahahaha
Don't you know the underworld?
There's no friendship party here
No meeting
You can come, but you can't leave
Move! Let no one live..

[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Where's my horns? Andale! Andale! Yo

[Ghostface Killah]
Throw me in a mosh pit, I'm live, will start shit
Melt the place then break out like an arsonist
Classified to get it for a classic killing
If I turn my back and walk, that means I'm chilling
Got bitches in mi casa, boiling fresh lobsters
But I don't do the shellfish, I'mma just eat pasta
Turkey, Italian sausage, chopped up kielbasa
Doing hits from home, like an elite mobster
Love my onions iced up, real little, wifed up
Gotti trench men is real brittle, Poconos is where I go with the capos
Eleven Sammy the Bulls, ready to wake those
I'm half black, yo, half oregano
That's half Ital', yo, who he, I'm from that Island, yo
Staten, crushing niggas like aspirins
Commissioner Kelly, ya'll kill ya captain
That's word to my bitch that's laid off
That little patch in the pussy, word, I ate it off
Team move with hands in the air like Adolf
Hand me a big joint, bet I spray it off

[Interlude: Cappadonna]
Toma, toma, mira, big kid
Poppy Wardrobe, Poppy Wardrobe, right here, Poppy Wardrobe!
Maricon! Yeah...

[Cappadonna]
La Cosa Nostra, La Familia
What, violate my family ties and I'mma kill ya'll
Mi amor, dami un beso, El Capitan, I'm ghettio
Hot sauce, on my Spaghetti-O's
Poppy Wardrobe, Mexican, handle a hose
All my gutter gang crew, got border patrol
Lights on when I come through, black Soprano, what
Two in the holster, my code name Darryl
Ride off in the sunset, sparking the barrel
Long boots on, my horse named White Boy John
Ride that side of that bitch, straight Mexican song
Ash hanging off the blunt, don't ever look at me wrong
In my heart piece stolen, Julio, I'm dirty
Up in the Arizona desert, where the shit get ugly
All my Staten Island riders, ride or die honchos
Get CREAM all day, leave our poncho
We bull fighting niggas, wrestle with broncos
And my team stay tight like Silver and Tonto
Carry a long whip, ya'll whip ya ass
Hard head Mexican dope, mixed with hash
Machete behind dough, with a rip in the slash
Desperado kids, me and Ghost, back at last

[Interlude: Cappadonna]
Toma, toma, Poppy Wardrobe
Poppy Wardrobe, Poppy Wardrobe
Bring it...

[Trife Diesel]
Yeah, Cinqo de Mayo, imported guns from Cairo
Got bagged with the toaster, beat the charge like rhinos
This bitch who's Albino, I met her out in Chi-Town
While I was out in Greek town, ordering gyros
The bad bitch keep a tool and a bible, quick to murder her rivals
And her pops was a gangsta disciple
He killed about a thousand vice lords, guns and knife wars
The feds came for him, so slick to the night ward
Down in the N.O., and right before he left
He wrote his daughter a memo, left stacks in the Benzo
It got hot, niggas selling, giving out the info
He paranoid, every 20 seconds out the window
Blow it in the limbo, he spazzed on Lorenzo
And smashed him in the head with his own son's Nintendo
About a week later, the boys came and rushed him
Kicked down his door, while he sleeping and cuffed himYo, break that dutch down

[Cappadonna]

You and your man, y'all fucked up for real
Now we got to show y'all niggas the deal
I sling raps, like cracks on the street
Attack, riot, rise above
Smash y'all, trash y'all, show y'all love
Thoughts are bright like a lightbulb
Ice cold raps, you stroll
Lease a finance, one chance, be my CD entity
Your energy is too low to bite my slug
You get drug behind bars and death is stoled on
Your code too simple, you best to hold on
Meet number three slang auxilary, and slang therapy
Based upon a true story, throw darts
Cut markers, straight duplicators, it's the terminator, Wu Killa Bee
Understanding, old special ed with the plate in my head
Bad bread, spare life, KKK on the mike, power like thing of state
What, play with the pussy and fuck
Stuck with the poles forever, what
Wu-Tang Forever, never sleep
Lyrics that kill, murder one voice
Chill or get dropped, your weak team ain't appropriate to no lessons
Adolescence, rhyme war, encore, surrender to my rap, I'm stuck on the map
Like I told you before winter war, in these days of hardcore
Smoke never stop clearing, stop cheering, you making me hot
Acid rain, a capell, wet you
And upset you, get you death threat, on cassette, it's the project
Reject, with the mic check
Set to be the son that set the place off
Face off, my darts is loving you, cyanide made your piss smell like flouride
Heavy stride, see it from the outside, archive five, smoke blunts hard

[Killa Bamz]

Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the silence and violence
We live for a blood on blood war
Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the blood on blood war
Uncut raw we live for

[Cappadonna]

All I need, is ten big bags of weed
Twenty-four acres of land so I could breathe
Money like Dusty, Prize like Leon, throw darts at you if the heat's ever on
Split you with the .45 caliber rap
Beat y'all down with shit that sound fat
Call 911, you still can't score
You and your dulla ain't prepared for the war
Yeah, you got heat but we got C4
Plus we got buildings that's watching your door
Hunchback, Chi-kids, Brother Jihad
VGL, FMF, the Bam Squad
Terrorize y'all from every direction
Call up Hot 97 for protection
Cappadonna, from the Wu-Tang Clan
Spotted last night in the all black van
Coming down the block with guns out the windows
Licking shots off every time a wind blow
My class come first, I'm first to represent
Killa Bees linger in the air like incense
Instant action, speed of a satellite, insight
Sight snakes from afar
Ajar, one side of a 2 faced bar
Project star, CD hackers
Supreme rapper, with the baseball cap
I attack fatal on the track

[Killa Bamz]

Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the silence and violence
That we live for a blood on blood war
Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the blood on blood war
Uncut raw we live for
Yeah

Verse 1: Neonek
Pour my wars out basins
My gates is filled with live grazes
Live and die for the king
Escaping hells faces
Forces with chariots armed
Dark horses
God will make God ????? and face loses
Seven months to bury the dead
The lord said
Make a feast for the birds and bees to eat flesh
Shouldn't turn the man you are
Consume you in your darkness
Bloodbaths sealed with fire the lords wrath
Man fainted
Now they see the glory God painted
Heavens army made a statement on your anti-Christ arrangement
Swinging the sword against God
And every mountain
Unleash a vile plague on all you heathens who be doubting
Lined up
Split you in half and grind up
I lined up split you in half and grind up
Enemies are the most high dined hired up
When your times up
The lord made his mind up
Everlasting torment for all you snakes who played foremen

Verse 2: Cappadonna
I got pains in my stomach
I just need to eat
I can't take it no more it's like life in the street
Got my hands shaking
Stressed out for cess
This rap is like coke
My mother can't rest
Times is hard
GATS in the projects
Niggas got jealous since my LP
Made life better
Now y'all hate me
Putting my life down for G-O-D
I rock this
Only love can top this
Laced in clean spirits
Now I'm spotless
Pulling out nots
Now I make hits
Throw jewels at you
Reap the benefits
Laid back love eat my tuna fish
Like that y'all
My God'll slap y'all
Devils in the place
Angels'll trap y'all

Hook: Cappadonna
The bread of life

Verse 3: Killah Priest
As the full moon follow my passage
Enter my tomb now strike the matches
Light up the room
Open my caskets
Theres my Mummy
Covered in maggotts
Say the words bring me back like Lazarus
Came to pass like the old lady who read my tarrots
My GAT spit
Still I shed the tears of a saint
My hearts passion
Painting pictures that's mad graphic
After my words are said
My paper burns up in ashes
All my thugs surround me like Christ at the last supper
Cold winds beat upon the window shutters
We break bread
8 Fed's came in and bust us
They rush us
They took me I screamed to my dog
The Sun Of Man must suffer
They kill me
Another one will rise from the gutter motherfuckers

Hook: Cappadonna
The bread of life(You don't really want God in your life)
Drop jewels and take flight
In this royal army I'm gonna stand and fight

Verse 4: Cappadonna
We always in the struggle
Making those Wu-Banga's
We hang like hangers
It's the essence of hip-hop
Live in the present
Write rhymes or Hasson'll never test this
Eighties fundamental
God is essential
Rents due plus the greatest lesson is don't owe
Pray with the flow and cruise through the avenue
Blacked down like some of the Jews do
Guns kill so do a missle
All praise due
May the father be with you
A child need milk
These needles are specially built to open your mind
Now is the time oh Lord place your hands upon us
It's the meat by selling bricks
To building cocaine weak
People don't speak where it's rats and 'roaches
Cats and dogs
Cops roll like Bozz Hogg
In the jungle
Where every black man is Tarzan
We are gathered here today
In the name of this rap
We coming in peace
So nobody have to get clapped

Hook: Cappadonna
The bread of life
Drop jewels and take flight
In this royal army I'm gonna stand and fight

Outro: Cappadonna
You don't really want God in your life
The bread of life
You don't really want God in your life[Verse 1: Method Man]
Who I'm is, the phenom, them niggas can't live
Who I'm is we ain't got shit, something got to give
Y'all done flipped y'all wig, blacked out the crib
Die and live for my nigs and my bad-ass kids, freeze
Looking at your ice like Jeez!
I'm plotting on the mousetrap, about to snatch the cheese
I heard y'all kids is bout that, psychotherapy
You bugging where the couch at, Wu til they bury me
Never tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree
Now it's cherry pie, if it's not broke let it be
Ain't nothing nice in New York
Stick you for your cake and your icing, that tough talk
Don't mean nothing when you're up North
So keep them hands where I can see 'em like you want freedom
You know that saying if you can't join 'em, beat 'em, and push your way in
We ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion
Pick the pace up, pants sagging pull your waist up
Niggas renting slum jewels from Jacob, fool!
You're like "Dude! I don't like your fucking attitude"
Fronting on my Clan from the "Stat" but we ain't mad at you

[Interlude: Ghostface]
Starks with the parcheesi face, measly paced ofays Ghostface
Jump out the window for a little taste
The joopy look, my main bitches call me lazy
Educated birds say, "Ghost you so crazy!"

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Cappa slide through with the Ghost
Post up like paint on walls
Drip jewels, big heat
Ruffle inside the bubble goose, it's the Odd Couple
Hollow points follow you home to Staten Island
Playing with the big toys that make noise
Echo in the hall, a scared voice
Niggas start to act choice, but Duncan Hines
Didn't know Betty Crocker had the two nines
Made the club moist, shattered the windows
Dustheads running
The rap kingpin plus the Black Jesus is coming

[Verse 3: Redman]
The words you talk better be the words you walk
Body you in the bed where the nurses are
Put your vein out, watch me insert the dart
Til it plagues from Bricks to the Persian Gulf
Light circuits off, thirty-third of my brain is off
That explains why my language off
My gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl
Y'all more like in training bras
Wet behind the ear, you're not prepared
For the project flow, with extra stairs
I pass out a vest to wear (bullets flyin)
Yo, the hard wire, starting bonfires
Pull the mask so you know it's me
And your weed got more seeds than ODB
Can't smoke with ya, watch Ghost tie a rope to ya
Def and Wu will open ya

[Hook: Method Man]
Eat a dick like (huh) baby shake your shit
Girl you're thick like (huh) getting rich like (huh)

[Verse 4: Ghostface]
Word, it's me y'all
We in two sixes flirting with bitches, dime plus
Taking pictures, How you doing baby? My name Ghost
Don't get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak
Seek intelligence, slickest nigga going since "Grease"
Check out the grays on the side of my waves, I grew those on Rikers Island
Stressed out, balled up in the cage
Pull a boot out on Jimmy Jam, text takes jam
Silky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler
All up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come
Biggie's Versaces, snow white rabbit
Hands is like photographic magic
Funeral love, move in when we hug, don't make it a habit
Hit the gym for two weeks, my back all chiseled
Elbows unique now meet the new me
Ghetto fabulous, Tone Atlas
Zulu Nation in the 80's in front of Macy's I start my own chapters
Tyco Nite-Glow velvet pose, special effects
High-tech armors merc you at the shows
Supercalifragalisticexpialidocious
Dociousaliexpifragalisticcalisuper
Cancun, catch me in the room, eating grouper

[Hook: Method Man]
Shoe fly shoe, Wally Don Clark crew
Fuck y'all wanna do, crack a brew, smoke an L or two
And flip like (huh) killing for the whole
Clique is sick like (huh) you and your stank bitch
Eat a dick like (huh) baby shake your shit
Girl you're thick like (huh) getting rich like (huh)[Cappadona]
You know how we do!

[Raekwon]
Yo, what's the deal Goldilocks?
Ain't nothing I'm just hibernating, love that watch
Pour me some Scotch and cold Courvoisier
No doubt, have a chair Boo lets get to pollying
Who you with? Me and Molly and some trick who's Yugoslavian
What fabric is that? It's only wool and Rayon
Lipstick crayon, fly Fahrenheit spray on
I'm getting tipsy, I hope she read cocks like a gypsy
And transporting bricks stealing many fifties
Fuck negotiating, is you with me is you waiting
Sweet as carrot cake, faking plus you don't eat turkey bacon
I don't get down like that, I don't get down neither
Cuban links skeezer, why you acting like a rap teaser
I'm like the jewelry exchange plus a range
Nigga you small change I only fuck for figaro chains
Analyzing Miss Clairol, Fendi down, mascara on
Assistant manager in Paragon

[Cappadonna]
Socializing, vibing with my eyes on Dot
She this book cover lady that be blowing up the spot
While my heart was racing, like the hands on the clock
I step live I think she see me putting out the pot
Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous
How's life today your hands are softer than Camay too
Your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you riding on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice
She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, intelligent
Whispered in my ear that she's celibate
Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there
As I grab the hand set her politely in the chair
As we stopped to stare at one another
Black sister to brother
I'm thinking all the time how she could be my lover

[Ghostface Killah]
What's happening brown sugar? Say you look so good today
Ankle bracelet wrapped around your leg
Here have a seat, complimentary drinks is on me
Bartender, Chevalier Chateau at table three
Luxurious rings, eyes sparkling
What's your name sugar? Juanita Cash Hawkins
Your complexion gives a reflection of
Sometime a black woman just need to be loved
Quiet and shy, baby girl my gift got you high
Made you wanna hit me with the keys to that five?
Just joking baby, I have a sharp sense of humour
Wish I would've bumped into your frame a lot sooner
What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three
Half Hawaiian with a slight touch of Chinese
Seen you working at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue
Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you
Yo, I'm all into older woman, who's happy living
Love kids and, keep all our business in the crib and
And not afraid to die with me the God on your side
We holding hands til death do us apart and then we slide
Earring in the left side of your nose love my combo
Should have left my Wis' a thousand times maybe tonight though
Yo you sexy motherfucker, damn what's the recipe?
You make a nigga wanna god damn!
Can you cook darling? At the stove you're evolving
Baked macaroni, turkey wings, a nigga starving
Here take my number let me pull the chair from under
I had fun plus your backyard speak with thunder[Intro: Lounge Mode (Cappadonna)]
Yo yo yo yo yo (Guess who's back?)

[Hook: Lounge Mode]

And the bitches in the club said Cap is Back
I got them thugs over there that said Cap is Back
And them Bloods over there who said Cap is Back

[Cappadonna]
I don't have to tell y'all niggas how it is in Da Struggle
Police chasin' me down, niggas start to bubble
Cracks and Blood niggas in the huddle
It's rainin' cats and dogs, and kids in the puddles
We still in the game like Poppy, Chad and P-Double
Hard-headed niggas causin' the trouble
Stank-ho niggas wanna see niggas behind the bubble
So they could start fuckin' ya man
Space Invadin' ass niggas takin' up land
Tryin' to understand my ill pain
No matter what you do I'mma still gain in Da Struggle
(Fuck you, double, niggas shoot dope in the game
This shit is serious)

[Hook]

[Cappadonna]
Aiyo it's not a game
You play chess with life, end up in the flame
Y'all snakes is five dollars and I'm about to make change
Out of devious chicks and niggas that lack brains
I'm on a whole 'nother level, kid feel me
Yeah, nigga, it's the real me
The project roaches, hoodrats, the broke TV
You can't see me
And let it be known that, any pretty ass chicks, nigga? I want that
Voodoo ass bitches get thrown back
You can't dethrown Cap
Stay focused on the regular
Be in the Hoopty with a shorty on the cellular
Lovin' my project like Nelson Mandella
Or the church love Christ, just pass the paper
Everything be alright, from Da Struggle
(Uh-huh, you two faced motherfuckers)

[Hook]

[Interlude: Cappadonna]
Y'all don't like me and I don't like none of y'all niggas

[Cappadonna]
You don't have to ask twice, I'm still in the Hill
Been all around the world, it's hard to pay bills
What you think? That Da Stuggle ain't real?
Rappers don't murder shit, niggas won't get killed?
You just a baby on an E. pill
And I'm ill with the skill
Shake the po-po off me
Runnin' fuckin' the ho's, fuck how y'all niggas feel
I'm too official
Any time, nigga, I could come get you
You shook while you got sickle
Brothers amongst brothers
Stay to make babies but they not wit you
Bleed with you, they snitch for the police too
Reptiles in the Benzo
The come adept, what they still do to ya clit
Struggle with this

Another Persian legacy

[Method] The Iron Lung

[Raekwon the Chef]
Yo yeah, yeah, yo, yo
Dart throwing, yo aimin at your nostril, Aéropostale
Sword rockin halibut steak we choppin
Mili-tia, eight to nine generals at one time
Fine we blend wine, go beyond one line
Spot the snakeskin, Dunn was scaley
Chopped his head off fuhrilly, sit back, crack the Bailey's
Wetter than white milk, grab the quilt - that's the heater
My nigga drop lost a stripe like adidas
Shit is deep, the bridge still burnin
The long time earnin, just got snatched by more Germans
Europeans are seein me bleedin, jet off in
The Lex skiin, goggles, Louis Rich Sweden

[Method Man]
I dig my life experiences, wrap it up
In twelve inches, keepin my defenses
Put it up in raw trenches, holdin court on the park benches
In the ghetto servin life sentence
Mass confusion in New York, on these city sidewalks
Busy sidewalks, there's no snoozin
Stop actin like it's me losin, peep my modern day
Pompei on city streets, the Sun pack heat
In Hell's Kitchen, time to get money finger itchin
Once again plot thicken, and you succumb
To the will of the slum bite your tongue
Burn a bush with the Iron Lung, pay dirt to no one
Guilty by association, stank bitch
Wanna give me some, nappy nasty -- I pass
Let them players flash, and trick on they cash
On your funky ass I only buy shit that last
A lifetime I write rhyme, chippin through
The pipeline then it's flight time, that's when I'm jetty
In a fifty-seven Chevy, gassed on my own Getti
Head heavy, with deadly medleys

[Cappadonna]
I opened up my rap Bible, then the light came
Over the children, as it began to rain
I started buildin, spoke many times before
But didn't score, my reading was poor
Injected with the Devil's english, I extinguish
And approach all hominyms, shit in your brain
Wipe my ass with the phenonmenyms, be holy
Or get shot down with the Moet-o, kid encyclopedia
Left y'all petrol, my dancehall standoff
Rap like Peter Metro, echo echo, what?
Beware my psycho, limw piece tec-o leggo
Uniform flow, stay strong black my shit is real
Peace out bro

[Method Man]
Tical
Eyes as diamonds, time again
Motherfuckers wanna battle with the bat or pen
Give it to em raw, give it to em raw
Down to the fuckin floor, up to the roof with the proof
Meth-Tical mad, god damn!
Hahahaha, right
Motherfuckers[Intro: Force MDs]
We are the G-O-D's
And we came to rock the spot
Like Ironman Starks
They be the illest MC's, in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Beez

"From where we at to my man's cell
From where we at"

[Verse 1: Raekwon the Chef]
Say peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges
Street astrologists, light up the mic God, acknowledge this
Fly joints that carry two points, Corolla Motorola holder
Play it God, E-pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Repel all fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait, drop it like Drake
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck a union
It's the same style, RZA train a boy, jump the turnstile
On the island he tried to challenge God for the new bals
Especially that, aluminum bat in the Ac
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black
The Mac-10 flex wipe cats like Windex
Index finger be sore busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing 'em, jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem
Abusing 'em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em
Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older Gods, build with the Sun, Moon and Star

[Hook: Force MDs]
All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us

"Ghostface--Ghostface Killah!!"

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps
Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbing niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be mellow like Vaughn Harper, Radio Barber
Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Phillipines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Biochemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Blond heads, inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zoom in like binoculars, the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex, was rockless, Chef ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man no die-cast metal, I'm steel-alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen, both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes
Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

"rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell"

[Hook]

"Cappa-Cappa-Cappa-Cappachino"

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Give me the the fifty thou, small bills
My gold plate, my slang kills
My beer spills, what up lils?
Murder one dun
Killer bee stung, guess who back home son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, Papi wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, lornadoones in fat pussy wounds
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill
Check out the mad skills
Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it and keep it
Jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang sweep it
Out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten Donna too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is hand-cocked
Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot

[Hook][Method Man]
I'm in the weed spot, pounds of purp
All the cereal cartoons is on, my favorite shit is the Smurfs
Now I don't slip when I'm down in the dirt
Cause by this time I done seen life and figured the amount that it's worth
It's the first, cops is looking for work
Got my niggas all cuffed up, sweating like a hooker in church
This old woman on her way to the church
She said the neighborhood's fucked up, and we the ones that's making it worse
Now that's fucked up!
I hit the block hard, Timberlands is scuffed up
No justice in the system, look around, it's just us
They tell me only God can judge us
But they ain't ever met Judge Koffler
I'm looking at this cracker on the bench
Don't understand, I only sold crack to pay the rent
Got possession with intent
Player, I ain't stressing, I'm a pimp
My bitches love the cocktail dressing with the shrimp

Moving them keys crucial, troopin like Isuzu
Nigga, your weed doo-doo, we burn that Cali kush
My flow be on steroids, that shit that Barry took
Hurting the game like the corns that's on your daddy's foot
My niggas carry big guns, y'all niggas carry books
You shook niggas get stripped, beated and wiped out
ConEd status like Fab, nigga it's "Lights Out"
What your life 'bout? Nigga, my life plush
I lost both of my parents, my nigga life sucks
Us Billy Boys hold toys
Cause they don't like us
Raw like the nose on a fiend sniffing that white stuff
Moving with the semi
Eggplant Pennies
Hopping out the Bentley
Looking like I just won an Emmy
Never been a sloucher, dogg cause I'm an alpha-male
Got that product on sale, look at your voucher
Leave that other gang
I'm Spanky, you Alfalfa
Little Rascals
With no hassle I will out ya
Sincerely doubt ya

Every time pick up the mic
I put work down
Cops don't like me cause I live in a murk town
My high school homies sold crack through songs
You can't get right through the team, like two wrongs
Mad "Criminal Minded" "C.R.E.A.M." muthafuckas
Type of subliminal rhymes: scheme muthafuckas
Can't shake the monkey, life is a bitch
Jake tried to jump me, wifey a snitch
Killa bees wild like C-74
New York bitch, adolescents at war
Fuck the government, yo, they made us this way
You a faggot: listen to what that chick say
Escape route gotta be free like ?
Fuck hoes, nigga I don't care if the world know
Hardcore
Move with or without Clan
Diss me in the cab and they murk your man
I'm a general
Don, with the crazy hype game
You don't like me, wanna feel my knife game
Killah Hill, son
They don't like where I live at
Came from Hollywood so I fight to give back

Just keep away (just keep away
Go on, it's not your fight!)
It's not yours nigga, fall back
I'm about to blow something out here
Straight up, yeah, this is a family thing
We gon' handle our business and shit
These muthafuckas know not to come around here like that
This is real shit, real talk
Four different niggas, with four different aspects, nigga
This is family shit
Who the fuck said family ain't family no more, nigga?
This is tight shit, tighter than white in ya wallet

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I'm talking bags of heavy coke, bracelets on every men
Innocent dope pushers, over night king pins
Indeed, we smack niggas up for their cheese
Throw bleach in yo face, got beef, let it be chuck
The streets don't know my peeps
Jumpin' out of UPS trucks, blowing niggas off they feet
With four-four gloves, rims spinning, tippin' on fo-fo's
My mouth be worth millions, something like Paul Wall's
Ladies look out; they ain't thugs, they homo's
The film look hyper, when I clap 'em in slo mo'
Ya'll still paying the mob? We whip niggas out like waffle batter
Theodore ancient with dart, flossin' them diamonds
Discussing our hits over a glass of scotch
Baywatch bitches that ski, take turns when they hand us the twat
Think not, we still run the trains, til the condom pop
On the low, we still fucking them cops
Pretty things from all precints, friday nights, we holding they Glocks
This is family, nigga, niggas can't stand me
Next up, my little man, I hand you the jammy

[Sun God]
You know the fam, what it is, it is what it is
S.I.N.Y., where the animals live
Ass bet, niggas run in yo cribs
I don't care if you blast for the cash, then scramble yo wig
I'm like "Damn, what a wonderful kid"
I could do what I want, doing dirt, not serving a bid
You know a real fam handle they biz, everybody get searched
From the grandpops, down to the kids
And my time, I'm officially here, tell ya man
Go and start up ya car, start shifting the gears
Sun God got the pits for his ears, cuz niggas is scared
Hoping I don't let it blow in they ribs
I said hot, niggas get robbed non stop
Once the gun cock, niggas strip down to they socks
And my fam at the tippity top, I won't stop
Believe it or not, you and ya man is close targets
Juks everything, dice games, mini markets
Fam gon' spark it, I'mma take whatever's in the pockets
Mostly the cash and the wallet, slide off the jewels
Cuz you shining, begets and the diamonds
Never deny niggas with iron... YO!

[Raekwon]
Aiyo, chillin' with the Ceasar crew
We can smoke, all in the halls
It's how many niggas with guns, got 'em on
All tip top, cling to the fullest, mad bullets
This is a hobby, the lobby where they clap yo hoods
Get the paper, word to everything, we a acre up
Barbequin' like a mutt, we ain't taking nothing
A high tech extremist, Gatorade, paid ya boy some money
To lay up on the low, swinging beamers
I need to be an actor, but instead, I'd rather be in Hempstead
All of my bread came from crack barbers and shoppers
So much beef in these whoppers
Guns that'll knock out floors and hit choppers
What? What? The family remains, cuz it's grain
It's automatic, I live it and I claim it
It's real, come around here, you bought here
Yo, lay that half tape, then you will get wrapped real quick

[Trife Da God]
Aiyo, we hug the block on President's Day
Swinging all year round, gettin' that money the American way
Might run up in yo wedding, grab the reverand and spray
And let the shots for whatever they may
This is family, nigga, minus the mob size
The resurrection of Toney Starks & Trife Dies', starring in Part 5
Niggas'll rather die when they're pride's in question
Try'nna play hero, getting stuck for they prized possessions
Look you staring in the eyes of oppression, that's why I ride with protection
Extended clips, super sizing my weapons
Five eleven, keep the heat tucked
That'll burn a hole thru ya stomach like acid reflux
Get buried in ya cheap tux'
We make it hard for you niggas to keep up
Been thru a hundred towns, and running, beating the streets up
Come up north in New York, down in Miami, pumping
At a table, breaking bread like a family

[Cappadonna]
Florida, where we follow the code of the streets and
Breaking the beats and, we taking the eats
Never the least, we invading the streets
Shaking the beast, we familiar for life
We don't run, we grab knives, my double edged spit life
My dogs is real tight, shooting the dice
Some of my fam might snatch ya ice
Got family that go to church, come back like you don't work
Got family that'll set you up, got family that chill, wanna spark the dutch
Wizard my fam, that stuck you up, I got fam that'll fuck you up
Chop you up, put your body in the back of the truck
Osama Island, we been wilding, see the violence
We display talent, respect balance, nigga, Shaolin[Intro: Cappadonna]
Yo, I wanna dedicate this song right here
To everybody that feel like giving up
Thought it was too rough for you or whatever
There's no turning around, there's no looking back
Chase your dreams, do what you gotta do
I got your back

[Cappadonna]
Picture me turning around, cuz I'm already set
In the game, and I'm holding it down
I went from, rags to riches, riches to rags
From Baltimore to Staten Island, slums, driving in cabs
Never gave up on my dreams as a young teen, serving the fiends
On my block with my Puma's and jeans
Been many places in the world, used to be out in Queens
Me and my China, AB, my doola since rock
A couple years before Biggie and Pac
I remember stashing cracks in my little shoebox
Now I'm back on the grind, claiming a spot
On tour with Ghostface, I love it alot
Me and my whole team hungry still stuck in the grot
Rather be out in the streets than being stuck in the box
What up, I just here linger with my two foots up
I don't have to play the six, now, I be in the cut
I be lamping like a lamp post, you loving my touch
Crack smiles at the hoodrats, they cracking they Dutch
And it's music I for soul, that's why I'm never gonna give it up

[Interlude: Q-Dini]
That's right, you can't afford to give it up, cuz
Don't turn around, ain't no looking back, you know
This is the better life movement right here, you know
Ain't nothing back there for us, we gotta learn
From the things we did in our past, gotta push forward, you heard?

[Cappadonna]
There just ain't no turning around, no matter what happen
Gotta push forward, knew my vision was clear ever since I first saw it
Used to carry a stacks, but now I can't afford it
It get real in my life, that's why I camcord it
Sometimes I'm down on my luck, but I always fought it
Constantly moving, I'mma keep climbing up the ladder
Locking the evil out until my pockets get fatter
Helping momma love, cuz you know that's how I do it
And when my babies call, man, you know I jump to it
And ain't no looking back, don't forget in past sentence
Stay focused, maybe I can push another Benz
Up on the radio, get a little more spins
I keep writing cuz I'm feeling like I got the wins
If I ain't home, probably next door at Trina Kim's
Thinking about investing time into our future
Still carry the torch and sing a song for Luther
And through the process, I'mma steady, keep love my neighbor
And give thanks, Jesus Christ, be my lord and savior

[Interlude: Cappadonna]
Uh-huh, yo, this one right here is for everybody
That thought they couldn't make it
Want to give up on their dreams, yeah
Don't even worry about it, yo, it's gon' get better
Just don't look back, man

[Cappadonna]
Yo, it's no more turning around, Popa Al told me
Keep on holding the crown, I got my two feet
Posted on solid ground, I know my daughter look nice in an African gown
And for my seeds, yo, believe me, I'mma keep it popping
I told ya'll before, quit can never be my option
This one's for Bill Cosby Jr. and my man Cochran
That's why I'm putting my heart, into another doctrine
And still giving my best, that's why I'm steady rocking
Loving my people, while I'm thinkin' bout Christmas shopping
Throwing darts cuz we try'nna keep these albums dropping
I ain't selling no crack and I ain't picking cotton
Get a nine to five, what? Man, you think I'm stopping?
I'm going hard for my people, gone not forgotten

[Outro: Cappadonna (Q-Dini)]
Yo, Dini? (What up)
Yo, remember you used to be chasing them cars, man
In the streets (I'm saying them days is over for me, daddy)
I hear that (remember them days, when you used to come through
To cut through the building, with the get ya on your side
With the fucking...) Mask on... yeah, son
Them days is behind me, I'm saved now
(So I guess it's safe to say, we gon' move forward with this)
Until them future songs, with a new psalm
(Trying to Cappatilize) Off of everything we doing[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
All in the club like what? Rugged dressed up
Hair messed up, gold on my neck
Don't sweat y'all show respect Poppa on the set
Death threat, I come a long stretch you can bet
Love is love, for real for real
Feel what you feel Park Hill 1-0-3-0-4
Rock caps til you can't take no more, it's war
Prepare for darts, martial arts
Let me shine keep me and mine, Son of Song
Took too long, back throwin darts, without remorse
Dart holocaust, slang boss
Remain top hip-hop, drop you to your knees for these
Big CDs, you heard it through the grapevine
Killer Beez

[Chorus: Rhyme Recca] (X2)
Everything is everything, reality
I keep my mind on everything, cause everything
Ain't always everything, and everything
That you see ain't reality, they just illusions

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Face to face I break bread every time
In the world I hold mine, play it
Now check it, see if you can comprehend
These crossover rappers that lost they origin
Run from the Wu this time it's more trouble
I'm comin for the wreck so y'all could never bubble
Never concerned about rabbits, after my carrots
Cherryheads, and parrots
Won't live in the barracks, we Don Ho
Buckwild with the flow, how we do
Timbo's and full boot, vocabulary pitfall
Fuck all, more clothes than the mall
Let's brawl
Wu-Tang broke radio laws, the opposite of mines
Is yours, from sea shores to bankrupt
I conduct, erupt like Holyfield
Third seal, third chamber's from the hood
Branch out, and everytime you see Don
I'm up to no good... motherfucker
Splash that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
I'm all alone, I feel trouble in the street
City heats, ghetto beefs, trick or treat
Call Chief, mad beef with MC's
Entity, Killer Beez one machine
Intervene, on scene self esteem
We gleam at night, it seems like
We too hype, hop y'all like checkers
Projectors, we break laws, get yours
We break jaws reunite, we upright
It's alright, out of sight, out of mind
It take time I develop, heads swell up
Shut the hell up, add on, you been warned
Mics get torn in half, I drop math
Don't laugh, a bloodbath with this here
Rap Shakespeare, beware, Donna-mite
Brown skin with the satellite, I represent
Buckwild and Street Life like 2 Cent
For real, for real
Love is love, for real, for real *overlaps chorus*

[Chorus]

[Kung-Fu movie sample]
The other killers, have already shown up
Now it'll be your turn, to die too

We're ready anytime![Intro]
Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground
Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground

[Verse 1: GZA]
The echo from machine gun rounds simmers
And a fallen soldier, his weapon hangs on his shoulder, lights get dimmer
Key swingin' back and forth in the ignition
The stench was only part of the horrible condition
As he waits for the smoke to clear
All he heard was the blast from in the bombs that kept ringin' in his ear
Along with gun-bearin' troops with fatigues and wearin' boots
From miles away, whether night or day they hear 'em shoot
It's a very unforgivin' and hostile environment
The military hardware, the only requirement
A world with a decease is just a thing of the past
Every advance is more costly than the last
The president's madness is responsible for losses
Political forces, land littered with corpses
Like the youth from the streets that gambled and get scarred
Even the troops in the field bet it all for one cause

[Hook]
Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
We grew up y'all, die-hard dummies, pourin' coke and guns
Violence was near so hallways were plungy
Dirty jean, hoodie on boys, stealin' stereos to get on
I did my first crime when I was born
Young king [?] realize
Life'll put you in a short spot, gun cocked, we was already signed
Day to day slingin', til once, we formed an ill line
Dynamic duos, all we did was threw O's
Police chased us in buildings, different places
This is real then, do me a favor, keep it from children
We was bad guys, stressin' for money
Regulate and start a strong clique, I was that nigga, don't forget
Time to time thinkin' 'bout time, little time left
Time piece is on, new Nikes, switchin' nines
In the buildin', pourin' out rhymes, don't let the cycle happen again
You might get trapped if you rewind

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Staten Africa, move through the rat holes with the hunger
All the Jakes, look Archie Bunker
Scheme on your cracks, plot, and jump yah
I can't wait to get out, released from the barracks
So I can chop more [?], hunt gems
My army got lion's dens
See through your technology, advanced behavior
Renewal of the street mind, I speak mine
Little kids run through your hall, addicted to spray paint
Thugs clash with the unjust, it's untrust in these hallways
But love always, all of my dudes from back in the days
We 'place hard times with better ways
On some grown man shit, gettin' that child support paid
Never call out [?]
Mothafuck what you heard, it's the gods in here
Never slack on that music, it's very sincere

[Hook x2]
