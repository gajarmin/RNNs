[Hook]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothing to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

[Intro]
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public
My attitude was "fuck it", cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "go to the telly, ho"
Equipped with money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smoking bomb ass weed, feeling crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustling and prayers, to breaking motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishing
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressing (booyah!)
I'mma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches getting suspicious
Started plotting and planning on schemes, to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart, strapped up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hoping you listen I catch you paying attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Peep it, it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screaming as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill (that's all you niggas got?)
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spitting at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flying when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doing jail time, better day, sacrificing
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thugging for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man, you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops cause I know they coming for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfucking menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Getting much mail in jail, niggas telling me to kill it
Knowing when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's yo nigga right beside ya
Hoping you listening, catch you paying attention
To my ambitions as a ridah[Intro]
Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit 'cha
I ain't mad at 'cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'mma send this one out for y'all, knahmean?
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust
Givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'member when you had a Jheri Curl didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh you's a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the wedding, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin' at 'cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at 'cha)

[Hook]
[Danny Boy:] I ain't - mad - at 'cha
[2Pac:] I ain't mad at 'cha
[Danny Boy:] I ain't - mad - at 'cha

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
We used to be like distant cousins
Fightin', playin' dozens, whole neighborhood buzzin'
Knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides, bumpin' 'n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my momma, goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause momma I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad
I'm knockin' busters on they backs, in my cell, thinkin'
"Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha
Cause you's a down ass bitch and I ain't mad at 'cha

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Well guess who's movin' up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothing to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as an adolescent, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at 'cha

[Hook][Verse 1]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard being Snoop D-O-double-G
But I - somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit like every single day
May I, kick a little something for the G's (yeah)
And make a few ends as (yeah) I breeze through
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' til six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do, shit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what) we don't love them hoes, yea
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Hook] (x2)
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)

[Verse 2]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these, at ease
As I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Beyotch I'm just

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Later on that day
My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cock
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door[Intro: 2Pac](Snoop)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
You done put two of America's most wanted in the same
Motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time
Y'all niggas about to feel this
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us aight
(A Toast to the gangsters)

[Verse 1]
[2Pac]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin' homie
You'se a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

[Snoop]
Sho' 'nuff
I keep my hand on my gun, cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin' on the outcome
Free 2Pac is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time it seems, they tryin' to take mine
So I'mma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

[2Pac]
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion
I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missing
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas living lavish

[Snoop]
I've got a pit named P, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And ... I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream's to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

[2Pac]
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these
Motherfuckin' G's
If you got it better flaunt it
Another warrant for 2 of America's most wanted

[Hook several times w/ minor variations]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfucking gangsta party

[Verse 2]
[2Pac]
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me, I bust and flee
"These niggas must be crazy, what?"
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

[Snoop]
It's like Cuz/Blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you about life and about the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

[2Pac]
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floating in the black Benz, trying to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm trying to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

[Hook]{*dial tone, then numbers being dialed*}

[Warren G]
Let me call this old bitch, see what this bitch doin
{*mumbling*} Call this bitch, raggedy-ass, shit man

[Some Gal] Hello?
[Warren G] Whassup?!
[Some Gal] Nothing, what you doing?
[Warren G] Nothing, just kicking it
[Some Gal] Are y'all done?
[Warren G] Nah, what you gon' do today?
[Some Gal] Umm.. pick up my stuff from the cleaners
[Some Gal] Might go get my nails done
[Warren G] Seriously

[Warren G] Ay did did did whats-a-name done get at you yesterday?
[Some Gal] Who?
[Warren G] {*singing*} Deeez nuuuts!
[Some Gal] Aw shut up nigga!

[Comedy skit]
"I wanna ask you one question
If I had some nuts, hangin on the walls, what did I have honey?"
I said, "Darling you'd have some walnuts."
She said, "Well.. daddy if I had some nuts
On my chest, would those be chestnuts?"
I said, "Hell yes!"
She said, "Well daddy if I had nuts under my chin
Would those be chin-nuts?"
I said, "Hell no bitch you'd have a dick in your mouth!" {*echoes*}

[Verse 1 - Dr. Dre]
Back with some shit that gots to bump
As you pull up in the park you pops the trunk
Just to floss it like a motherfuker, clowning an' shit
Got the Dana's on your hooptie and your fly-ass bitch
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that ho
If she proper, I'mma pop her, the ho hopper
It's back on the track
With big money, big nuts, and a big fat chronic sack

[Snoop]
So Daz, step up on they ass
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past

[Verse 2 - Daz]
Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote
With my nigga D-R-E, so you know I must be dope
But uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass
Starting static with Dre, make way for the AK
That I bring as I slang like cavi
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy
Had he, not known about the city I'm from
Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back
Here I come, stomping in my kahki suit
B.G. from the hood, kinfolk Eastwood
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling

[Snoop]
But could you raise up off his nuts?
Cause Dr. Drizze's about to rizzip shit up

Where the niggas get they scrap on, don't nobody cap on
Slap on some D-R-E
Or some funky ass shit by the D-O-double-G-Y D-O-double-G
Real G's who drop ki's
Protect these, N-U-T's, so nigga please
Peep out my manuscript
You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit (BE-OTCH!)
So recognize game from the gangsta
Thangs will remain the same until I change 'em

[Snoop]
It's real easy to see
So you can check sounds from Nate D-O-double-G

[Nate Dogg]
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street
I heard you wanna fuck with Dre
You picked the wrong motherfucking day
Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow
Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row
I heard you wanna fuck with Dre
You picked the wrong, motherfucking day
Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow
Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row

I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street[Intro]
(Mista Grimm's "Indo Smoke" plays in the background)
Ay ay J.C
Sup Enron
Ain't that Snoop Dogg over there
That that nigga with that blue coat on
Yeah oh yeah that's that nigga
Nigga roll up on the side of him, man
Roll your window down
Man hand me my motherfucking Glock man, gimme another clip
Cause I'm gonna smoke this fool
Yeah roll the windows down
Yeah, OK there you go
Ay man, you Snoop Dogg?
Snoop, Snoop Doggy Dogg
Man he's Snoop Dogg
Man fuck that nigga *gun shots*
Nigga man, get that nigga man
Man get up fool man, get up man, don't be tryin to run man
Get up on that fool man, I don't give a fuck
What set you got now, fuck you nigga!
Yeah nigga, whassup nigga
Yeah motherfucker, yeah nigga, one less nigga
Yeah nigga, youse a dead motherfucker now

[Verse 1]
As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

[Hook]
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me

[Verse 2]
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe (check it out)

[Bridge]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Verse 3]
No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

[Hook][Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz]
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leaving motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Khan though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstanding, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack, I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'mma ride
Breaking in gas with the '68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
So mandatory, my elevation
My lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient, nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination, give up to fate and get that ass shaking
I'm busting, and making motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out forgive me, Janet
Who's in control, I'm activating your souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat

[Hook: Method Man]
I got my mind made up, come on
Get into, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Well I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylacks for protection
So my fucking sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
I'm a MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' bom-bay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymes, I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? Cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe: to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
You already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware: set and prepare to enter verbal combat

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks, I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, sticking up Jews with German Lugers
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket, blaow
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan
Half of my Clan's repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickel
Man, I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical, then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Headbanger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass, or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

[Verse 5: Redman]
Lyrical gats spitting the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this madd underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm spliffted
Funk Doctor who, Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift, now you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MC's like ki's
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wann' snake bust it
I'm the one pushing the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke off this antidote, got you ope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for 9-nickel

Reminiscing about the Fresh Fest back in '85
When the dubs and the San Dieg's used to hoo ride
On motherfuckers like it was the thing to do
Eighty-five, eighty-fo', eight-tre, and year eighty-two (eighty-two)
You know what the fuck I'm talking about
After party on the lake at the big homie's house
And bet nobody bring a motherfucking gun
Cause everybody in the house's from two-one...

Tray Deee:
Twenty-first street, burst street, where it all started
And you know East Side, Long Beach, the hardest
Niggas coming realer than The Real McCoy
So step with your rap and we bring the noise
It's the gang of fly bitches, homiez on the switches
Dice in the back if ya wanna get your riches
No snitches allowed inside the crowd
Cause this is the G thang, East Side L.B.C. brang
In to have some fun represent two-one
And bet nobody bring a mothafucking gun and a...

Snoop:
Yeah, King Park was the location
And to be a G, that was my destination
(We were) lookin' up to niggas coming up before me
And L.B.C. into my East Side homies..... (It's like)

Nobody can see you, but you (yeah, the East Side's perfect)
Nobody can see you, but you (ha ha, now that's worth it)
Nobody can see you, but you (hell yeah, the East Side's perfect)
Nobody can see you, but you (ha ha, yeah, now that's worth it)

Tatatata.....

Snoop (Tray):
If ya bring a strap, then ya have to trip
(so if you're on a mission nigga, go on and dip)
We got meat to eat, (freaks to meet)
And chronic we can smoke on, (and forever get a loc on)
Strolling through the Park one day
Puffing on a fat ass J, with my homie named Tray
Deee tryin' to see if we could put this LBC thing
Back together like it was supposed to see

Tray:
Cause ya know I'm down with ya to make 'em get the picture
And if I have to sit ya down then I spit ya
Game from the heart, I came from the start
See I was regulating when Cragars was the Daytons

Snoop:
Nigga let me interact with my black croaker sacks*
And a gray golf hat tilted to the back (what's up?)
Ditchin' Sunday school to get a pack of Now and Laters
While I'm rolling with the Steelers and killin' with the raiders

Tray:
And when we bang with the Saints then we ain't no joke
Come around from outta bounds and we goes for broke

Snoop:
Now we're breaking 'em up (hmm hmm), shaking em up (yeah)
And just for a second we're waking 'em up
(continue) Giving up game on this tight ass beat
With a small dedication to two-one street[Intro: 2Pac](Snoop)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
You done put two of America's most wanted in the same
Motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time
Y'all niggas about to feel this
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us aight
(A Toast to the gangsters)

[Verse 1]
[2Pac]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin' homie
You'se a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

[Snoop]
Sho' 'nuff
I keep my hand on my gun, cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin' on the outcome
Free 2Pac is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time it seems, they tryin' to take mine
So I'mma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

[2Pac]
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion
I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missing
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas living lavish

[Snoop]
I've got a pit named P, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And ... I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream's to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

[2Pac]
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these
Motherfuckin' G's
If you got it better flaunt it
Another warrant for 2 of America's most wanted

[Hook several times w/ minor variations]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfucking gangsta party

[Verse 2]
[2Pac]
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me, I bust and flee
"These niggas must be crazy, what?"
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

[Snoop]
It's like Cuz/Blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you about life and about the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

[2Pac]
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floating in the black Benz, trying to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm trying to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

[Hook][Intro: Dat Nigga Daz]
Yeah! Straight up 9-5!
Kurupt the motherfuckin Kingpin, Dat Nigga Daz
Creepin and crawlin through your hood, smokin, loccin
Provokin punk motherfuckers like this stuff
Wuz happenin?

[Verse One: Kurupt]
In the dead of winter is when I kick my coldest phrases
Mental as telepathy, lyrically it amazes
Construction of thoughts that's as lethal as turpentine
An expert when I flex rhymes feared like ex-cons
In my zone (zone) you can't even find like Atlantis
Stalk like a prayin mantis, leavin battered bodies on the canvas
The burial ground for clowns, open casket
Trackin niggas down like fuckin basset hounds
Tragic how the mic gets handled
Prodigious like a vandal on a midnight scandal
You scramble like Randall abusive when I recite on the stage
Double access with a brand new motherfuckin mic

[Daz]
Now can I grab the microphone and spit some shit that's known
To blow the mind of Michelangelo´s poems?
Clones get crushed like stones
I forbid, for rusty motherfuckers to be actin like they all in
With the clique got checks that shit
And once again it's on, and it's on with the gangsta shit
I create the beats that beats the fucks right outta ya speakers
Amps are blown, shown for me to grab the microphone alone
Like Jodeci, notice-see ya self needs help
The homie style got the strap on deck
Don't neglect the fact
I can make you or break you (Break you)
Awake you to a new plateau with mo' hoes
Now the paper is made, now don't think twice
Niggas is gettin pimped because their game ain't tight
Now well well (well), now welcome where the ballers dwell
Another day, another dollar, Blueberry to sell
I makes that fast cash, hmm Dat Nigga Daz
I'm quicker ta out slick ya, blast in half

[Kurupt]
DPG eliminates the whole area beyond the thought dismemberin
Motherfuck surrenderin
Who, what, when, let's tear shit the fuck up
The homies coolin while you an' ya chest get fuckin blew in
Provoke us, survey with the superior focus
I'm Dat Nigga like Daz, crooked as scoliosis
S'impossible to survive on my arrival when I arrive
It's left to ya instict of survival
Mashin, cash in ya chips I gotta lil' sadistic sick mind
I find it, I´m mentally sick
And batter
It doesn't matter when ya into it
Ya just entered in a war-zone all alone with ya microphone unguarded
I just started poetical poltergeist precise and cold-hearted
Empty, tempt me, simply ya get shot
Ya forgot I'm down to empty out my clip on ya block
Stop
Let the whole place evacuate
Wait until we're face-to-face then it escalates
Duck-down, Kurupt clowns niggas daily, hoes can't play me
Observe I serve those that betray me

[Nate Dogg]
I ain't never seen a joint that I couldn't light
And I ain't never seen a buster that didn't bite
I ain't never seen a G that would go for that
Especially when he knows Tha Dogg Pound got his back
I ain't never seen a game that didn't multiply
We getting kinda deep, yeah the crew and I

[Kurupt] And who am I?
[Snoop] And who am I?
That crazy motherfucker from the DPG, do or die![Hook] x2
[Rage] I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs (rage)
[Snoop] Rock on, wit cha bad self

[Verse 1: The Lady of Rage]
I rock on with my bad self cause it's a must
It's the Lady Of Rage still kickin up dust
So umm, let me loosen up my bra strap
And umm, let me boost ya with my raw rap
Cause I'mma break it down to the nitty-gritty one time
When it comes to the lyrics I gets busy with mine
Busy as a beaver, ya best believe-a
This grand diva's runnin shit with the speed of a cheetah, meet a
Lyrical murderer... I'm servin em like two scoops of chocolate
Check it how I rock it
I'm the one that's throwin bolos, ya better roll a Rolo
To find out I'm the number one solo, uhh
The capital R-A now take it to the G-E
I bring the things to light, but you still can't see me
I flow like a monthly you can't cramp my style
For those that try to punk me here's a Pamprin child
No need to say mo', check the flow
Rage in effect once mo', so now ya know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Lady of Rage]
Now I'm hittin MC's like hit MC's like ("Hoo-yu-ken!") *Street Fighter sound*
Ain't no doubt about it I'm the undisputed
So what you uhh, wanna do is back on up
I'll tap that butt, wax the cuts, pass the bucks
So put your money on the bread winner
I kick lyrics so dope that the brothers call em head spinners
I got the tongue that is outdone anyone
From the rising to the setting of the sun
Or the moon, I consume the room with doom
When I hear the kick of a 808 bass ... POOM
BOOM, BAM, God, DAYUMMMMMM!
I'm hittin so hard you could say it's a grand, slam, dunk, punks
Get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk
Of the rhythm (fresh) that I give em
Let it hit em, split em, did it now I'm rid of em, yeah
I put that on my unborn kids
Rage in effect so you know how it is

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: The Lady of Rage]
Now ever since my debut, I've continued to lay you
Flat on your back from the raps that I spat, spit
Ohh shit, I'm the shit!
You can't get wit the Rage then tough tit-tie
I pi-ty the fool, that gets
With the lyrical murderer cause my shit is rude (OOOH!)
You wanna get with the wickedness? With that
Big bot-ty that's kickin it, rippin it apart like Jason
You'll be, chasin a dream like Freddy
Are you ready for the cream de la creme?
I'm steam pressurin those who ain't measurin up
I keep competitors stuck
In the muck with they butt up, what chu wanna nut up
Like cashew, don't you know that I will mash you? For real
That's the deal, I'm straight out of Farmville, VA
(So what you gotta say?)

[Hook] x2

Huhh
I am the roughest, roughest, roughest (Say what? Say what?)
I am the toughest, toughest, toughest (RAGE!)
(repeat x4)

Get with the uhh, roughest, roughest
Get with the uhh, toughest, toughest (RAGE!)
Get with the uhh, roughest, roughest (Yeah)
Get with the uhh, toughest, toughest (RAGE!)
Get with the uhh, wickedness, roughest
I am the uhh, wickedness (RAGE!)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, one-nine-nine-fo'
The indo blow and the grass grow
Snoop Doggy Dogg still don't love a ho
But you gotta give credit when credit is due
Women back down and bow down to my motherfuckin homegirl
The Lady of Rage
She rocks rough and stuff with the Afro Puffs
Handcuffed and she busts
And trick biatch, she's guaranteed to tear shit up
Y'know what I'm sayin?[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Damn, look what the wind blew in
From the depths of the sea
It's the S-N-double O-motherfucking P
In the place to be
And this time I came with the homegirl R-A-G-E
So let me begin
To slowly start to flow but let me grab my cup of gin
Then look, the crook, it's me
Who be the D-O-double to the G
I fly through the sky like a dove once again
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg -- can I blend, men?
Then send more than you need
Can I have some bags so I can roll up the weed?
I take a glance, in other words a chance
I spot myself up on the dance floor taking a dance
I got a bitch on my dick, some niggas talking shit
But ain't no need for me to call my clique
Cause DPGC be the clique that the D-O-double G belongs to
I wrote a song to the track that's provided by my nigga Dr. Dre
Now slowly start to slide into a trance, move around
And get hooked, lady, by the sounds of the Pound
We got the hits that just don't stop and they don't quit
Cause once again, Snoop Dogg is 'bout to drop some shit, bitch
I can't stop, I pop
Never flip, I flop
Snoop Dogg got the shit that don't stop
Rock on with your bad self
It's The Lady of Rage at the top of the shelf
So push the button, run, because
Snoop Dogg is on the mic and I'm a dope motherfucker
Yeah, you best ask somebody
About the man with the la di da di
I got the shit that makes your body shake
It's time for you to stop, pause, and awake
Open up your eyes and stay composed
It's one nine nine four -- I still don't love hoes
I treat them the same -- it's like the boom bam
It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic; can I slam?
Yes you can, and you just don't stop
C'mon, say what, and you just don't stop
Uh, yeah, and you just don't quit
Hey yo Rage, could you please drop some gangsta shit

[Hook: The Lady of Rage and Snoop Dogg]
I rock rough and stuff with my Afro puffs
[Rock on with your bad self]

[Verse 2: The Lady of Rage]
I rock on with my bad self cause it's a must
It's The Lady of Rage still kicking up dust so, uh
Let me loosen up my bra strap and umm
Let me boost you with my raw rap
Cause I'mma break it down to the nitty gritty one time
When it comes to the lyrics, I gets busy with mine
Busy as a beaver, you best believe-a

To find out I'm the number one solo
The capital R-A -- now kick it to the G-E
I'm bringing things to light but you still can't see me

For those that try to punk me, here's a Pamprin, child
No need to say mo', check the flow
Rage in effect once mo', so now you know

[Verse 3]
Now I'm hitting MC's like Hadouken

Or the moon, I consume the room with doom
When I hear the kick of a 808 bass...boom
Boom, bam, Goddamn!

Punks get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk
Of the rhythm (fresh) that I give 'em

Rage in effect so you know how it is

Oh shit, I'm the shit
You can't get with the Rage, then tough titty
I pity the fool that gets
With the lyrical murderer cause my shit is rude
You wanna get with the wickedness?
With that big-bodied girl that's kicking it
Ripping it apart like Jason
You'll be chasing a dream like Freddy
Are you ready for the cream de la creme?
I'm steam pressuring those who ain't measuring up
I keep competitors stuck
In the muck with they butt up
What, you want to nut up like cashew?
Don't you know that I will mash you?
For real, that's the deal, I'm straight out of Farmville, VA
[Snoop: So what you gotta say?]

Yeah, one-nine-nine-fo'

Handcuffed as she busts
And trick biatch, she's guaranteed to tear shit up
You know what I'm saying?[Latoya Williams]
Ooooh...

Young Daz, step up on they ass
Give these party people a blast from the past

[Daz Dillinger]
I've been here for years, ran with the best in the game
Diggy Daz, Dogg Pound - you know my gang
Swift as a cheetah, swift with the millimeters
I love it when we click up, I love it when we meet up
A new attitude, I wasn't raised with no spoon in my mouth
I had to bang for the rep, I had to bang for the clout
You better watch out, before you get beheaded
I said it - you ain't no Dogg Pound Gangsta
Diggy Daz just said it, don't ever regret it
Beat you in the head 'til you remember who the king is
Wa-swing, I'll show you what a G is
We in the world where we don't give a WHAT!?
I'm Diggity Daz and I'm a stone cold WHAT!?
You ain't no entity, you're just a pretend-to-be
You ain't no friend to me, rockin' for centuries
Holla my name, you'll see me when I rock crowds
I move the crowd with a click-click pow-pow

[Chorus]
(Cause it's all night)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all day)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all night)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all day)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope shit
(Cause it's all day)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all night)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all day)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all night)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope beat

[Daz Dillinger]
Here I am, comin' right back outta the cut once more
Party people say "ho!", and check out my flow
And I flip flop and I serve those
Anialate my foes and roll
(party people, you know just how it go)
See flowin' me as I glide, hollow tips when I ride
Only stride for perfection when the party is live
Do what you do girl, you know your body gettin' hotter
Lovin' the way you bouncin' your booty, you know you gotta -
Drop it or stop it, all I need's to top it
This my new shit - go cop it, bang down the block and -
Daz Dillinger more liver than ever
Me give up this gangsta rap rap, homie never
You heard of the Dogg Pound, you know that's my gang
You know of Dat Nigga Daz, you know of my name
So here I come - stompin' in my khaki suit
B.G. for the hood and my cousin Snoop Eastwood

[Chorus]
(Cause it's all night)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all day)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all night)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all day)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope shit
(Cause it's all day)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all night)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all day)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all night)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope beat

[Daz Dillinger]
Now as Daz break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see and I can tell that's all you want
So I blaze up the chronic, so we can get high
The party don't stop until the clock strike five
Double shot of Tequila when the DJ turn the beat up
You know I'm D.P.'d out, I stay G'd up
I do it to 'em - feelin' you never could feel
Where your mind is calm, where your body is chill
Yeah, you got to feel the realism
Daz is on the mic homeboy, hittin' hard as steel
Cause this is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlaz
I came to the party, to get up in this mutha mutha
I see the people jumpin', the DJ start the cuttin'
Nobody standin' on the rule, girl move somethin'
So here we go, here we go, round and round, here we go
You can't fade, this 2003, ho!

[Chorus]
(Cause it's all night)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all day)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all night)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all day)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope shit
(Cause it's all day)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all night)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all day)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all night)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope beat
(Cause it's all day)
(Cause it's all night)
(Cause it's all day)
(Cause it's all night)[Hook]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothing to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

[Intro]
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public
My attitude was "fuck it", cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "go to the telly, ho"
Equipped with money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smoking bomb ass weed, feeling crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustling and prayers, to breaking motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishing
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressing (booyah!)
I'mma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches getting suspicious
Started plotting and planning on schemes, to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart, strapped up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hoping you listen I catch you paying attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Peep it, it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screaming as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill (that's all you niggas got?)
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spitting at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flying when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doing jail time, better day, sacrificing
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thugging for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man, you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops cause I know they coming for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfucking menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Getting much mail in jail, niggas telling me to kill it
Knowing when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's yo nigga right beside ya
Hoping you listening, catch you paying attention
To my ambitions as a ridah[Hook]
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world

[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
Catch us in M.I.A
Cleveland and Dallas
We be European, D-P-Gin' in malice
Roll up the best dro, we here now
Turn up, when you get down
Roll call, all my dogs, spent 10 g's at the strip mall

[Verse 2 - Daz]
Round and round we go
Where we stop, no-one will know
Baby it's [?] Austria, Beli[?], [?] Tokyo
Then I, spin the globe, putting my fingers on it
Like a G-6, pop a[?] flight then I'm [?]'in on it
Then I zoom straight to [?], UK, Belgium, then back to France

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg]
It was all on you, now it's all on me
All around the world, this is volume three
Me and my cousin, D-a-z
Ain't too many spots that we don't be
Mad when I play us[?]
Cute lil' Egyptian, met her in Arabia
Mad when a nigga stop paging her
I had to let her know, I ain't saving ya

[Verse 4 - Daz]
You know, we know the flight's [?]
Strap it/traffic[?], ten [?]s with the flyest beach
In Dubai, you know we don't [?] smoking, we high
And then we fly over to the states with the cars we drive
And then we end up at the leopard nine[?]
This guy[?] gon' party like all day long
Who gon' tell him when we end up next?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
All around the world babe
People say the same things
People say they on they own
But they do the same thing
All around the world mayne
Everything's the same game
People say they on they own
But they do the same thing

[Hook] x2What the fuck is this? Child support papers? What?

Chorus:
You didn't have to file on me, you turned my child on me
Why you had to file on me? You turned my child on me

Daz:
As I lay myself to sleep at night
I pray the lord my soul to keep, so I can try to do right
There's no one else that I can turn to
I'm asking a favor, oh just once
Oh Jesus Christ, lord I'm asking you
Gave to this world a young baby, know one life is crazy
Promise to live the righteous life of the path of my babies
Watch the clouds spread, and it shades my heart
My relationship fell apart
Don't know where it ended, sure can tell you just
How it started
She filed child support, and it's really cold hearted
I've been taking care of you and your kid, all of my life
Mad at me cause I wouldn't make you my wife
I've done a lot of crazy things in my days
Killing to get that weapon named, robbing just to get paid
Now how much more can I bear, and I explode inside
Still asking myself why...

Chorus

"Lil" C-Style:
I'm like "what, child support?"
Man, who ever thought I would get filed on
Uh, you know what I'm saying?
Do gangsters get filed on child support? Hell yeah they do
I got filed on, I ain't the only one out the crew
Uh, child support, have I got something for 'em, uh?

I, I, I, I walk by faith, and not by sight
Living day by day, praying night after night
Cause I'm seeing so much, so much lust lust lust
And every pretty girl I see, I wanna touch touch touch
You think I'm doing too much or what?
I'm dating the preacher's daughter, and getting the toe up
And every time she drinks she gets drunk and throws up
If I'm on the spot, you know she's surfing on my (??)
Look in her best, from the back bend over
Now she's eight months, got me buying me baby clothes, and I stroll up
Writing her lawyer, talking 'bout how much I owe her
Wrote him back, "I can't do a damn thing for ya"
All I can do, is just take care of my daughter
Thirty days later I got a court order
She filed on me, cold game, she filed on me, uh

Chorus

Daz:
Now I'm sitting in court as she's trying to get everything
From my house and my cars to my gold rings
Trying to drain a brother just like dreino, you know the same old
Situation's occurred, got me sitting on the curbs
Smoking a bomb joint, trying to pull my point
Every night I get the marihuana, thinking it would take away the pain
Waking up the next morning, and thing are still the same

Big C-Style:
I did so much, to get so little
Paid more than the court even asked of me
But loving no more, not even a parlay? And you want me to pay?
It's not like it's for my baby, it's more like for you and your nigga
Why you have to lie on me, and turn my child on me

Chorus (3 times)[Soopafly]
Now I can't recall ever losin' y'all
No sweat, no disrespect (I ain't trippin')
But I didn't know we was pickin' and choosin' y'all
So look back out for them West Coast niggas
The come and toast niggas, revive back and fly flat
We fly, we high off contact
(Eastside representer), Soopafly with bomb raps
West Coast, hit 'em up, we all that
Yeah we trip, they fall back
But - we cool like the wind yo'
But don't sabotage the life we lead
We gangsta ass niggas, but we could still be friends though
Now here, have some drink, smoke my weed
It's the bomb, I hit it with y'all
Do your thang, ain't no foul no harm
A nigga need a hand, I lend him my arm
(You know) we not that bad homie
We like to party hard, do our thang too
Whips and chains too
It's all lingo, real niggas connected closer than a seam yo
No matter where you're from we should all be havin' some
We all gon' stay fight, we all gon' run
The game - it's a shame niggas think I want the fame
Nah nah, I could give a damn - just know my name
But now as far as comin' out, yeah we to blame
But now we here motherfuckers, treat us the same

[Hook]
They act like they just don't hear us
Cause they know we just don't play
But don't be afraid, don't fear us
It's alright, it's okay
Don't be so down, just cheer up
Say what you want to say
Eastside Long Beach can feel us
Welcome back to L.A

[Daz Dillinger]
Who am I, it's the D-A-Z
Give it to you funky fresh, so lovely
Xzibit, Soopafly, Alkaholiks, D.P
West Coast MC's most definitely
(I don't like that shit)
When you see me in the crowd, high
Talkin' loud and actin' wild - it's just my style
You feelin' this, labeled as a menace and gang affiliate
600 Benz, Lorenzos, homie we wheelin' it
I make the party people say "ho", I kick flow
Rock shows, be on flows like the wind blow
Skate out and burn rubber, and leave clouds of indo smoke
Like R.A.W. I ain't no joke
Don't fold up but choke up, don't provoke us loc
From Coast to Coast, who rock the most? (Dogg Pound!)
If I'm banned from your FM dial, I say "fuck it"
Have a joint and a smile - I'm still on the prowl
Be on the underground, I drop sounds that profound and out of bounds
Capture your audience, flow rhythmly like an accordion
Or tell me, are we in a world full of bitch ass niggas and girls?
On the crossfade, I made and learned trades to get paid
You might get slayed and crave what I made
Drop it at the 1, 2, 3 -

[Xzibit]
X to the Z rockin' with the D.P.G

[Hook]
They act like they just don't hear us

Eastside Long Beach can feel us
Welcome back to L.A

(L.A.-L.A.-L.A.-L-L-L.A.-L.A.)

[Xzibit]
Look, now tell me what's stoppin' you from hangin' around
Stuck in your hotel room whenever you come in to town
I see niggas perpetratin' like they lovin' L.A
But it ain't showin' in they video and radio play
See everyday I got to deal with this industry shit
A bunch of so call heavyweights that's scared to get hit
Prepare to get lit, with the best choke you ever smoked
And politics separate chips, we all can get rich
Release all bitch tendencies, we on the same team or we enemies
And I ain't got too many of them
A lot of hand guns and homies, I got plenty of them
I just make one phone call, you'll get riddled with ten
And that's for only when you try to get slick, and try to cross me
For now let's talk promotion over croissants and coffee
Look - I'm from the place that taught the world how to gang bang
Now I'm finna take it to the top of the food chain

[Hook] - X 2
They act like they just don't hear us
Cause they know we just don't play
But don't be afraid, don't fear us
It's alright, it's okay

[Daz Dillinger]
Out of the clear, blue sky makin' it happen
Also shit we stackin'
Crushin' and bustin' upon all these backstabbers
I seen em' in traffic, it's Daz Dillinger
He ain't familiar with us
How I getsdown and gets up
Scopin' out the scene, forever makin' green
Stabbed in the back, plot and scheme
Me, Tray, and Mark get busy
After dark rippin' in my park
From the end to the start
So tell me homeboy what it is
I thought we was down to the end
My next of kin tryin' to blast me to the end
What it is I thought that we was down till the end
What it is, backstabbers

[Mark Morrison]
Said ya was my brother, brother
But you ain't no brother, brother
Turnin' ya back on me
And it turns to jealousy
Said she was my sister, sister
But you ain't no sister, sister
Treatin' a mack this way
Dodgin' me all day
I thought you was my back (Yes I did)
Cause we all still black (So true)
And no matter what you do (No, no, no)
I could always count on you (Oh)

[Daz Dillinger]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Hook: Daz Dillinger (Mark Morrison)]

Who's supposed to be ya friend (Backstabbers)

[Mark Morrison]
Girl he ain't my brother

Turnin' backs on me
And it turns to your envy
Swearin' she my sister
But how is she my sister
Servin' suits on me
Negative plublicity, listen
I thought she was my back (Yes I did)
Cause we all still black (So true)
And no matter what you do (No, no, no)
I could always count on you
Brother can't you see
That he usin' you against me
And no matter what they say
Mack Daddy's here to stay

[Hook]

Backstabbers, like a flagrant foul with no damn sound
How dare you try to stop big pimpin' slow
When the life of the flavor is my ho
Layin' between the lines lyrically
Inclined to come off divine
Every mack in time, against all that

[Mark Morrison]
I thought you was my brother
Cause we all still black
And no matter what you do
I could always count on you
Sister can't you see
They're plottin' you against me
And no matter what they do
My love will come to you (Tray Deee)

[Tray Deee]
When I return like the mack then I cause disaster (Yeah)
Bangin' on these wack, back stabbin' bastards (What)
Perhaps it's a lack of true macks that's rappin' (Uh)
While people don't be knowin' what's exactly happenin'
But try to play me, Tray Dee will clashin'
Cause I brand these Magnums and blast the fastest
Don't ask if I'm massive to grab my stashes
I last in the past puttin' plans in caskets
Daz and the Mack in the back be flashin'
And havin' it lavish with smashin' classics
Act like mack life ain't no joke
Burnin' youth hang in Cali where the pistols smoke (What)

[Mark Morrison (Daz)]
Backstabbers...backstabbers (What ya say now) Backstabbers

(What ya say, what ya say) backstabbers

[Hook to fade]Yeah, gimme some gangsta shit curr
Some of that hood shit
Coming up
How that sound ?

I've been doing this shit since day one
Yeah nigga, day one, day one yeah

Let me, let me tell you what your worth is
Wake up in the mornin with a purpose
Only you can make me happy, surface
East side long beach baby, the turf shit
The place where I lurked at
13 on the scene getting bent back
With a whole lotta snake venom
Used to steal annihilators out the highway center
Up early getting shit started
Back flippin', trippin', tippin', crippin' cold hearted
Way before I got high man
Both double up 15s from the pie man
Heat out the motherfucking frying pan
Little kids love Snoop, fuck IronMan
I'm a vet on the set I ain't lyin man
Let me show you how fly I am
Play in the school, lay in the pool
And I stay in the cool
Young loc I ain't playin with fools
Reset, repeat
Unlock and recock
The heat and it gets so fast
Spend yo cash
It will get in yo ass
Now the question is this for now
Are you really in love with that bitch yo?
Another man's trash is another man's treasure
What's your pleasure?
Looking at you straight from a falcon eye
On my balcony, asking how can I?

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

Curr I used to run with struck out gon' away
Cold things is he called me on the phone today
Told me he was up for release
Its been about a dub since cuz seen the streets
Yeah loc, shit don' change
Long Beach don' flipped crazy durange
Everybody sellin' out, word of mouth, the OG's tellin' now
I drove there the other day
To chop some game with my big homie Donald Ray
Its sort of hard for me to run away
Step out my car no gun today, underlay
I press my luck, if I get stuck, well then thats whats up

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

The true definition of that mixtape

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

Everybody get down
"Look nigga... I nurture and breed"
"I ain't never gave a fuck about a bitches needs"
"And bitch niggas try to invade our town"
"I'mma lay 'em down, spray the 'K and get out"
Say goodbye to the '6-4, hello to the '6-trey
He ain't never seen hydraulics, look at his bitch face
Up, down - now watch my shit scrape
Daz call Snoop, I'mma Crip Walk to get Dre
And Blood Bounce back, heat on the track

Throw a O in the pot and watch it bounce right back
Like that (like that?) like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : The Game, (Daz) & "Kurupt"]
(We street connected, respected, I gets pathetic)

(Lil' homies around her constantly on smash mode)
(Lil' niggas with pistols that blowin' out your asshole)
(Bang how we give it, the culture that we live in)
(Fresh out the hospital or fresh out the prison)
(Real niggas for life, the roots of the G tree
N.W.A., Dr. D-R-E)
We not S-T-A-R's, we don't put stars in our shoes
Bitch we put the whole car on the shoes
You don't wanna see my car on the news
I'll "Set It Off" like Queen Latifah, red beam on the nina
"Bang out, chipping in traffic, dipping the classic"
"Dipping to classics, whooping that ass"
"It's hood niggas ready to get it, your bitch can get it"
"Cause I know she'll suck a dick in less than a minute"
"Cuz, I'mma have to show him where the house at"
"Two milli Macs, semi-automatic situational attack"
"In the back with a sack, Cadillac all black"
"Like this and like that"
"Bang, broken like glass and plastic"
"Bang out on him with the mask and plastic"
"We got access to massive plastiques"
"Purchased last week, D.P.G.C"
"Bang"

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : The Game & (Kurupt)]
Here come them outta town niggas, what up Blood?
(What up cuz? They don't even know what 2Pac first album was)
Should I tell 'em Blood? (Nah, fuck 'em loc)
Me and Kurupt three-wheelin' on the hundred spokes

Run up on the '6-4, see the AK's

(Bang) like Snoop, (Bang) in L.A
(Bang) like Crips and Bloods
From now on, wear a Bathing Ape hoodie get stripped in the club
Like a bitch in the club, watch him strip in the club
You like ice creams? Get a banana split in the club
No jewelry, you can't wear shit in the club
And that go for every nigga and bitch in the club
So you better take it off 'fore you get in the club
Game and Dogg Pound along side sittin' on dubs
Remember that

[Hook]I bust on leathers, leave'em frying in a griddle
In the middle like Monie
You're phony cause your style's bologna
But I rock with no filler, ain't a girl m.c. illa - puttin'
Rappers on ice, then lock the body in a chilla
The way I fucks it up, I upchuck nasty style like
Throwup blow up, then go nuts
Like a lady Ninja killa
I'll drill deep beneath the surface
It's the Rage, front page, I heat up like a furnace
My stelo gots bulk

Stomping through your territory
New rap female category
Winner, and your style gets played out like the
Spinners
Not a soprano, or alto, the Rage is a tenor
My voice is just right - I bust hypodermics to your
Inner minds eye

So if you wanna see me turn on your headlights, I'll

(Hook/fade)[Daz]
Woke up one morning out some bomb ass cock
My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I swoop in the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru house to puff on the loop
Seen my little homey Style who I ain't seen in a while
Damn near gone, floatin on cloud one-nine
Liquor sto', so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
Seven, eight, nine ten eleven twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug the ho out
I fixed me some food, then boned the hell out
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeahh, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

[Nate Dogg]
I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog don't blame me

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Now do I love them hoes? (HELL NAW!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg!)
(And you never gave a fuck about a bitch;
Cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha hah, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a ho
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
Pushin caviar, and a little bit of pussy
So I can get my pimp on
Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

[Big Pimpin]
I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen... and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his pay
Dedicated the ho, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a ho
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my ho brings me mine
For like she said she'd do it
And I believed her when I accepted
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them, like la-di-da-di
I rock them, mighty hardy, like la-di-da-di

Light up that dro, light up that dro
Light up that dro, light up that dro
I'll pull up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro

Smokin' up the Cali, smokin', smokin' up the Cali
(I'm buyin' the bar tonight)
Smokin' up the Cali, smoke, smoke, smokin' up the Cali
(Cause we're smokin' all night at the banquet club, nigga)
(Twelve thousand niggas, smoke a pound, nigga)
Smokin' up the Cali, smokin', smokin' up the Cali

I'll pull up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro
(Yeah, put some chrome
On your... while you're at it nigga)

[Birdman]
So light it up and pass the thang to me
I'm fresh off parole I could smoke a whole P
Can smell it in my clothes you can smell it in my seats
That's how a nigga rolls I was raised in them streets
I'm rolling up a sweet, I'm fillin' it with keef
I'm too high to talk bitch, keep it real brief
IF it ain't about money, you don't even gotta speak
I smoke it in a paper, Weezy smoke it in a leaf
And nigga I'mma Stunna, I got runnas
And we keep them shotguns like hunters
We smoke thunder, it put me under
I'm talkin' bout straight purple kush that fungus
See I be fuckin' with them trees, cuz I'm straight out tha jungle
Keep about five pounds and we ain't even tryin' to hustle
Ya'll already know how that go

[Hook x2]
I'll pull up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro

Smokin' up the Cali, smokin', smokin' up the Cali
Smokin' up the Cali, smokin', smokin' up the Cali
Smokin' up the Cali, smokin', smokin' up the Cali

I'll pull up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro

[Lil Wayne]
I get my kush from California, get my dro from Arizona
I can get it cross the boarder, I got a Ryda name Winona
And I be calmer than a soma, inside of the phantom
And it's lookin' like a sauna, and I still stay high and I still got my diploma
And I still keep the maggie on me like a Homer
And I'm too sick, man, I'm spittin' out a coma
And I'm still lettin' the money pile like goma
And I smoke that kill, ya'll blowin' on begonias
And I keep a field of that grass like a farmer
And I keep that armor, try me and I'll spin you around
I'll be with the stars and I ain't talkin' Tinsel Town
That's right the prince in town, bitches tear the fences down
Like prince in town, boy I shits a pound of that purple rain on the marvin's day
You wit me now? Too high you can't set me down

[Hook x2]

[Daz]
We got that AK47 white right on set painted

Blazin' up so much bomb, I got a bad bitch on my side

See see we just smokin' we just smokin'

[Kurupt]

[Daz]

[Daz]
Because we fucked up, we fucked up, you know that we fucked up

[Hook x2]Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence, for the small chronic break?
A-hah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit

Chorus:

If you come up, get done up...inside let me run up - 4X

Come up to my room

Verse Two: Jodeci

I recognize you
You was in the hotel lobby
You were lookin damn good
I was sweatin' at the after party
I told you to go with me
I wanted you to freak with me
Keep the message from your mama
I dont need no drama

A piece of mind
A piece of mind
A piece of mind
Is hard to find
So dont waste time
No, no, no, no, no, no
From the side
From behind
In your eye
How ever you want it
There's no tellin what I'll do
When you come into my room

Chorus

Verse Three:

I'm feelin kinda lonely tonight
I need someone to do me so right
(I'm lookin for a woman, I'm lookin for my baby)
Don't be afraid to come to my room
Just be prepared to stay until noon

Chorus: 2X
