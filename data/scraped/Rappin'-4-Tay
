[Intro: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me, that right?
(Only God can judge me now)
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business, really
(Only God can judge me now)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus I try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin' got me knockin' on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me

[Hook: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now

[Flatline]

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
(Flatline!)
I hear the doctor standing over me
Screaming I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes laying here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
Cause everytime I breathe, I think they killing me
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', danglin' my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walking through the cemetery talking to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
Black Power, is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama can you save me? And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin' round strapped
Mister police: please try to see that there's
A million motherfuckers stressing just like me
Only God can judge me

[Hook]

[Interlude: 2Pac]
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
(That's for real)
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
(You know?)
Let me live baby, let me live

[Verse 3: Rappin' 4-Tay]
Pac I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance say a playa hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
To get your safe, knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin' bullets representin' the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin' sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

[2Pac]
Guess you figure you know me cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night club drunk and buzzed
Been living lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me

[Outro: Chorus w/ variations]
[4Tay] Only God mane
[2Pac] That right?
[4Tay] That’s real
[2Pac] Hahahahahaha
[4Tay] Fuck everybody else, ya kno what I’m sayin?
[2Pac] Man, look here man
My only fear of death is comin back to this bitch reincarnated
That’s for the homey mental
We up out[Hook]
Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool or kick it in the tub
Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 1]
I got a ho named Reel-to-Reel
She got a buddy named SP 12, now you know the deal
We gets freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are coming real tight
Something to roll to, something to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money, mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till these women get the notion that they running the game huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worsen
Fillmore, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the playaz club

[Hook]

(more champagne, Mr. Forte?)

[Verse 2]
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
Words out 4-Tay's out rappable
Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
Cause the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin 4-Tay, I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' off them suckas popping off at the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro
Leave the Gat at the house bring some dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your macking at these women at the playaz club

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now homie what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
Some of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start drifting in the wrong direction
Miss goody two sure see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the playaz club[Intro: Too Short]
Say ho
Yeah you
Can I ask you a question?
You like to fuck?
Oh, you don’t want me to talk to you like that?
Would you like to make love?

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I saw you walking down the street, and I had to stop
Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good, and you’re so fine
Young tender, would you be mine
I get you in my car, drive you to my house
Cuz I’m a mack, I cold turn you out
I won't ask, and I sure won’t beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work
What time is it? Don’t watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and I’ll rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am, and I always can, Freak Nasty
I’m the man
I take you out to the finest restaurant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers? I’ll buy your ass a rose
But later on you’re coming off with them pantyhose
You want gold, girl what’s next
Its me and you, doing the sex
So now you know I’m just a freak
Give it up baby, I can’t wait two weeks
I want it all, Don’t say I won't
Get it girl, now I’m telling you don’t

[Verse 2: Entice and Barbie of The Danger Zone]
Nigga please, you provoke no feeling
You must of forgot, the girls of whom you're dealing
We haven't the urge, to get busy
Like those dizy lizys, who used to dance for you, your through
I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted
You're addicted, to the words you inflicted
Time after time, line after line
Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you $hort because of your height or your width?
Diss me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky, your a dinky
It's an easy task, to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
Your a freak with no tale
You have no ass, class,you can't pass, your simply trash
Your a typical nigga, the kind you don't take home
This is Entyce and Barbie from the Danger Zone
Like a short dogg that carries fleas
You make my ass itch, twitch, don't you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits cause your all up on it...

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Get mad if you want, I won't front
When it's time to hump, won't be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too $hort baby all in them guts
I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet
Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet
It's just a freaky note, from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew
Like every other nigga in my crew
I bump hoes, now it's your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Won't sell you dope or sell you blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby, You know what I want
Your acting like it's that time of the month
Are you bleeding, can't think about sex
Irritated by your Kotex
We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck
I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck
Now here, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't...

[Verse 4: Entice and Barbie of The Danger Zone]
Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer
And most definately, not a dick pleaser
You dreaming, and scheaming, and fiending for my lust
You don't have enough, for you I feel disgust
Wait, small thing I hate
For goodness sakes, if I wanted someone small I would masturbate
I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream
When I say too short, you know what I mean
You see, I need man, not a boy to approach me
Your lame game, really insults me
Your name is Too $hort, or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny
Little boy, your not a player
I'm your savior
To try to get at me shows audacious behavior
I've got to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy, here's a proposition
You wanna bit of danger, Step into my zone
You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home
With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining
Dare to say you got some? Nigga please your lying
Cause to fight the feeling, there would have to be one
And mathmatically, me plus you equals none...

[Verse 5: Rappin 4-Tay]
I am the rapper that they call 4-tay
I'm gon tell you like my homie Short Dogg would say
Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then it's cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang, but she said no
That's about as far as it's going to go
So I toss and turn, to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep, that's how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you ain't with it
The rest of you freaks just won't admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Ain't nobody tripping cuz I know I'm right
You could be black or you could be white
For a black girl it really don't take too long
But a white girl's always tryin to turn ya on
With a little squeze, but it's just a tease
Give her some time, she'll be on her knees
Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt
Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut
But don't get me wrong, cause you started it all
Coming to my house in a camisole
But when it's time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight, don't want to serve it
Gave it some time, so make up your mind
Don't fight the feeling, it's time to unwind
You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
But I'm Rappin 4 Tay it don't make me none...

[Verse 6: Too $hort]
Yeah man, the little hoes got ill
So now it's time to get way too real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank ho
Go get your bank ho
My little dick'll have you screaming no
Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up
Your still playing that finger fuck
See I'm a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts, not big mouths
I know some little girls'll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down, give you some head
But little girl, you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain cuz your way too young
So at this point, I really can't say shit
Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch...Beyotch!!![Phone rings]
Lady: Ragtop records, may I help you?
Fly: Can I speak to Fo?
Lady: One moment please, he's around
4-Tay: Yo, wassup?
Fly: Wassup, Fo? I know you finished that cut for the radio
4-Tay: As a matter of fact Fly I just finished it baby boy, no worry about nothin', I'll be around

[4-Tay]
Regardless if I'm chillin' backstage or on tour
With my homie Young Fly even Al B. Sure
Never hesitate to call me after I'm done
Cause homie I'm real and always true to my loved ones
Too many wakes and funerals full of tears
You say there's something on your mind, well hey, I'm all ears
Cause ain't nobody thinking about the funk that you're choosin' it
A lot of my homies stuck in the pen for life or losin' it
Call up your folks you keep thinkin' about home
Recorder keeps a peep and there's a block on the phone
And all of this is enough to make a brother's nerves bad
Reminds me of a situation that I once had
Spent that, spent this endless relentless tremendous women on my jock
And don't nobody mind their business
He say she say throwin' salt about it
And chooses to talk about you cause there's no one else to talk about
Talk about the show and the flow and all the clout
Then be real with yourself and talk about and turned it out
It's not hard to compete when his name is poppin'
A scared man can never win that's why I stay clockin'
Fools be huffin' and puffin' don't wanna see me about nothin' I'm down
And if you ever need me Fly: I'll be around

[Hook]
Whenever you call me: I'll be there
Whenever you want me: I'll be there
Whenever you need me: I'll be there
I'll be around

Life ain't based on peaches and cream
This new generation lost a whole lot of dreams
Future doctors, producers, and mothers
The list goes on but now we killin' our brothers
And if we killin' our brothers that means we killin' our own kind
These kids is watchin' now it goes to their mind
Rat-tat-a-tat cause you got a gat
Then they want a gat you livin' like that?
Moms ain't cookin' she worked the week straight
If anything she's the one deserves a hot plate
The ghetto, the ghetto ain't nothin' to dream about
Tryin' to get out now that's somethin' to think about
Fools might disagree but I'm a stay sucka free
Now I'm so black and so strong they can't fade me
Blacks are blacks worst enemy there's still no remedy
You got me for a grip do you call yourself kin of me?
Jealousy, envy, I see it in your eyes
Tell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise
I keep it funky it's pretty hard to miss it now it is not explicit
A message for the mind, and a moral for statistics
So I'm doin' what we call a roll call
Talkin' about the ones who won't rap then take a downfall
I spit the street life and then I go underground
You silly, it's called versatility and I'll be around

[Hook]

Things are gettin' crucial you gotta exercise your mind
Or learn about life before you're left behind
But how you gonna get it right when you're not doin' right
When you get mad all you want is a gunfight
This tension causes a gang of madness
Now you want funk that results to sadness
Sadness results to a lot of revenge
And your so called friends really ain't your friends
So how do you know who you're able to trust
If you think about the past look what happened to us
I never trust no one, I only trust myself
Or I would've been a victim like everyone else
In friendship or hardship whenever you need me
Just give me a call G I won't deceive thee
These fools be shakin' best believe they're fakin'
Just tryin' to get a grip of all the money you're makin'
This ain't race a mind is a terrible thing to waste
I drop the rap and J drops the bass
To the flow cause ain't nobody get with Fo
I'm a down young brother comin' straight outta Frisco
Droppin' a message out of love to your town
Love your brothers and sisters and I'll be around

[Hook][Celly Cel]
I roll 360 degrees and slidin' to the function
Shirley-locks in my hair, yelling 'Bump Something'
Menage-a-trois, need about three with me in this spot
Mixing up my Drizze while they stizz up on that row, but
See, I'm a ridah, when I flash it ain't nowhere to hide ya
I'm right besides ya 'bout to let these thangs all up inside ya
There ain't no sense tryin' to knock a playa for the way he lounge
Even the haters in your town sing it's going down

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Up in the spot, fool got popped, killed a cop, jumped in a drop
That was the life he lived but now it's honded
Imagine your dome posted on America's Most Wanted
They flowned it and locked him up for conniving
Whether the strong surviving
Or getting pimped by the system
I still be 4 1 5 ing it down to the V
With that fool Celly C E L L
Shakin' it, breakin' it, movin' it with this clientele
With this underground, it's going down
Ha ha

[Celly Cel]
It's going down so majorly my pager battery
Stay on low cells while I'm trying to get some mo' mail
Dodgin' hot ones, makin' liquor store runs
Creepin' through the city streets, pervin' and I'm on one
Can't get wrapped up in that "He said she said"
What was said already did, runnin' your mouth will get you filled with lead
So I stay real, soakin' that game outta the hills
Ridin' with that Mazda sound
Now you know it's going down

Uh, (you tell me)

[Hook: Rappin' 4-Tay, E-40]

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Holler at a player though
40 Water, what's wrong wit the game though?
I don't know

[E-40]
Holler at a player though
4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Rappin' 4-Tay]
I keeps my distance from haters cause I'm quick to flash
Area takes me with a passion, I tap that ass
Be quick to blast, the game just ain't the same no more
You doing too much, pump your brakes, slow your roll
Fucking up the hustle with the streets and shit
It's too much legal tender on my agenda to bite our fame
But if you play me, I gots no choice to reach you in check
They playing with a full deck, you can get the breakfast, say thanks

[Verse 2: E-40]
See I'm a business man with a set of big balls
Marketing meetings and, uh, got Frisco
Just ain't your work for a living (uh huh)
They got hit, what the fuck?, you think I been got shit?, it ain't easy
Everyday now walk through the streets
A nigga can't even sit down with his family
And be straight and have a decent dinner
Without a motherfucker yelling, "Refalations"
"What I got to do to get you in my compilations?" (compilations)
So I study what I do, the shit for you for free (for free)
I used to do that to a nigga when I was seventeen (uh, uh)

[Hook: Rappin' 4-Tay, E-40]

[Verse 3: Rappin' 4-Tay]
What's the world coming to when niggas talk down for fun
Some Rappin' 4-Tay you don't make me dumb
Pop a cherry, we don't mean that much
Cause if it don't make dollars I don't really give a fuck
Jocking all up under my name but you don't even know me
Got me fucked up and one of them suckers when they so called homies
If that's the shit, better pause and magnum or Crip, they ready to paint us
When niggas go against the great 40 Water, what's wrong with the game?

[Verse 4: E-40]
I'm ten years hung in this shit, if I was up to heart
My nigga got dick, her is his, by selling chicks in front of his car
Got a crib with 9,000 square, Christine and Marsha, will you just imagine?
Big ass improving for Maximus, big ass, let's fetch it
I seen it in my dream when I was nine years old
My Momma always told me to achieve my goal
Keep a cool bid and, uh, respect a dollar
Never get too greedy for the money and power

[Hook: E-40, Rappin' 4-Tay]

[Verse 5: E-40]
The reason I carry Glocks, 26 on my side of my hip
Cause I ain't dumping now (dumping now), thinking of now a days
They act like you owe something (something)
Talking about, "40, show me some love!, (show me some love!)"
Because I got a, a despot im my blood
Niggas want to knock ME
Cause I don't blossom like a sunflower SEED
Surrounded by promises, you said that you keeps me smoking big WEED
Drinking while sipping Ale (sipping Ale) yes INDEED
Born and raised in Vallejo (eeehhhh!)

[Verse 6: Rappin' 4-Tay]
They claim they got solid rockets
So all my true player partners, y'all just stay focused
And watch them haters cause they plots on a daily basis
Hustlers, servants, traders that caught so many dope cases
And but I want the quickness if the G's is right
If that game was tight, ballers had pimped at it, ain't no such thing as
Three strikes
No sense, our fucking minds aren't, but I'm on parole and shit
Niggas get to running off at the mouth just like a snitch, some like a bitch
Ehhh!, Ehhh!

[Hook: Rappin' 4-Tay, E-40]

[Hook: E-40, Rappin' 4-Tay]

[Outro: E-40]
What's wrong wit the game?
Can't get caught off with the game
Just get my chips and get paid
Holler at a player though
4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?
Holler at a player though
Holler at a player though
4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?

Published by Songs of UniversalIt's the dank season for nineteen ninety four
Seff the Gaffla and Rappin' 4, yo
Everybody's smokin' chronic fuck the reason
It must be pleasin' man it's dank season
(2X)

For 1994, Tay is in this muthafucka
An' I could never be a silly stupid ass sucka
Busta, it runs in the family
Shakin' em, breakin' em, takin' em like a vet from the bay, G
Seff the Gaffla that's my nigga were persuin' this
Gigolo, gigolo G, boy you're doin' this, beat
So let me kick a verse about that shit called chronic
Don't try to play it stupid cause I know you up on it
You probably just rolled you one, probably just smoked you one
Callin' up the hooker play the ho for another one
Late night hustlin' in the projects, O.C
My brothers in the dark an' were way past OD
Just flipped my money, feelin' good and I'm cheesin'
Seff'll hook you up or put you up on the season

Chorus

(Seff the Gaffla)
Rappin' 4-Tay, what's up with these foo's
Actin' like ho's when these niggas know the rules
So I'm about to flow, an' let these niggas know
About the Y, the B, the G, it ain't easy being me, so
Break down the dank, roll it up with the quickness
Pass me a lighter so I can cure my sickness
How many hits does it take to make you stop?
How many tapes does it take to make you pop?
Go ahead an' tell me cause I really wanna know
Smokin' ind-e-o with my nigga Rappin' 4
Never beat around the bush I'm gettin' striaght to the point
After every meal I fire up a dank joint
Gettin' high as a bird, a bald head eagle
Man I can't wait until they make dank legal
That'll be the day that'll probably be the end
Loungin' in the Mo smokin' dank drinkin' gin
Kinda like a rocker but I live in the ghetto
I got you hangin' on so you better not let go
Have a seat, what cha see, dank in your cup
Gain your composure while a nigga fire up
I smoke dank daily to the point that I'm lazy
Every day I smoke a half a quarter, can't faze me
You know who I am, so go ahead and jam
Fire up the dank while you let the tape slam, damn
I feel hella good for some reason
Got a nigga cheesin'
Indo's in season
Humboldt-Kelly all the way to the bay
Ragtop Productions with my homie Frankie J
Hooked a nigga up when he heard a nigga flow
Anotha platinum hit with the nigga Rappin' 4
And oh, you didn't know, I coulda told ya
You ain't got five on the dank that I hold ya
Ran out of Zags, get some more from the corner store
Seff the Gaffla, nineteen ninety Rappin' 4

Chorus
(2X)

Break a, break a twenty sack down to two joints
And fuck all that other shit niggas gettin' to the point
Pass me a baggie so I can empty the sack
I feel the bass in the back, if you can hang get the contact
Cause niggas twistin' more than just your average dank smoker
Me an' my homies we blaze this shit we gets ova
An everyday routine if you fakin' with your paper
Call up my nigga cause he clockin' on this pager
Sticky, sticky green oh no I can't fade the brown leaf
Nothin' does it better than that potent ass indo weed
Keepin' my composure plus this douja's got me coughin'
And if one of these niggas don't pass the blunt I might go off
An' snatch it up an' smash it up an' puff it till it's outta there
You say you spent twenty dollars but ask me if I care
Now I got the munchies, need some cookin' from my boo
But she's out with her potters they in the cut smokin' dank too
Seems that everybody's smokin' plenty marijuana
But don't let that be the reason you're caught up in some drama
]From slippin' and trippin' this lip until you're stuck
Sucka Free City niggas know what's up, what's up

Chorus
(2X)

(talking)
Now pass that muthafucka up on the left hand side, man
Giggalo what's up G?

What's up boy? You know I'm still just chokin' smokin' same old thing
Ain't nothing changed

Yeah, I'ma send this one out to all the dank smokers out there
It's all good baby boy
It's the dank season
And let the chronic be the muthafuckin' reason
We up out this muthafucka for 1994
Me and Seff the Gaffla, it's like that G
Here we are
That's real
And don't forget, it's the dank season[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Dogghouse
Gimme some of that G shit Goldie Loc
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin 'bout
Yeah, check this out y'all, uh huh huh

[Hook 2X: Snoop Dogg]
We got Snoop Dogg in the house tonight, with the homeboy Tray-Deee
Waniac, Trip Loc and Goldie, 4 Tay from the bay, what you say
What you say, huh? (we do this like everyday)

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Did ya get the dank, did ya get the dank?
Yeah I got the dank, you got the gas in the tank?
V.I.P. status, don't need an apparatus
Cuz the niggas I fuck wit, they all about the cabbage
Down in yellobrick road my destination, the DoggHouse
Toastin Remys, fillin' jimmies, we goin all out
Lookin for the wizard, creepin through the fog
Got some bad ass bitches, headed to the player's ball
They gon be strippin and wigglin ass
Hope you brought your playa pass
Tray-Deee, Goldie, 1/2 dead, the twins blaze sacks
Bigger than big everyday in L.A
4 Tay representin for the whole damn yae, Beeyotch

[2nd Hook: Snoop Dogg]
DoggHouse, turnin it out, and if you ain't dope you gots to get
The fuck out, that's on the O G D P, (say what)
And that's how it is when you fuckin wit me

[Waniac]
Don't matter how you come, use all angles
Ties become tangled when the cutthroat strangles
My hookup, long rangers
Better float like a nationwide sky pager
Them hoes save us, talk about bein playas
On the real we can deal wit you playa haters
We hit the spot, every city got a block
What you makin when you take it to a different type of level that it pops
Know the dogg keep the hip rocks, steady bangin
Hoes steady sangin from the gang that we claimin
Yo, it's Waniac, the maniac, Trip Loc won't you spit that rap

[Trip Loc]
Park my shit and jump out, I'm at the homies spot
To see if he floatin with me up to the DoggHouse
Hit the weed he lightin, outside little niggas is fightin
This bomb, I'm likin
Holla at my folks I know up in the complex
Nigga ready to ride as soon as he get dressed
Now we ready to roll, hit the store, then the carpool lane
Once again it's on, big chiefin
Remind me of the noisiest place
Ladies all over the place, and niggas super laced
How we like it, saggin in my 5 0 1
Killin my lungs, keepin these homies and bitches on one

[Hook 2X]

[Tray Deee]
Man I got warrants, bad tax, still sayin fuck it
Headed up to DoggHouse swervin in a bucket
Puffin on some bomb from my comrade Blue
And got my little bitch catch a contact too
House shoes with the blue khaki suit and my locs on
Swoopin to some Soopafly, gettin my smoke on
Nigga Goldie Loc got the heat on roast it
4 Tay on the way plus the twins is posted
Bout to set it off bet it's off the hook
Straight crooks, gettin money off the books
Makin nothin but that gangsta shit that niggas lovin
Thuggin at the house party, fuck goin clubbin

[2nd Hook]

[Goldie Loc]
Let me hear you say pimps, banks, hustlers
Let's all get the money then murder these motherfuckers
Cocksuckers, they can't stop us
Now put up your choppers, just in case they rollin wit them coppers
I shut em down, DoggPound for them bitches
I be seein you with snitches everytime I'm hittin switches
Ice skatin over dicthes
I'm true to the game, plus I'm out to get them riches
I be mobbin down the road tryin to bag up my bags
I'm saggin so hard I'm tearin up the back of my khakis
I'm tryin to reach my dogg Dirty Red
But this ho won't let me know, which way to go
I'm movin slow
My chucks only come wit a hundred miles of walkin
Hundred miles of runnin smellin funny and I'm gunnin nigga
DoggPound gangsta crip for life
And we gon party in this motherfucker all damn night, nigga

[Hook 2X][Intro: Too Short]
Say ho
Yeah you
Can I ask you a question?
You like to fuck?
Oh, you don’t want me to talk to you like that?
Would you like to make love?

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I saw you walking down the street, and I had to stop
Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good, and you’re so fine
Young tender, would you be mine
I get you in my car, drive you to my house
Cuz I’m a mack, I cold turn you out
I won't ask, and I sure won’t beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work
What time is it? Don’t watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and I’ll rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am, and I always can, Freak Nasty
I’m the man
I take you out to the finest restaurant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers? I’ll buy your ass a rose
But later on you’re coming off with them pantyhose
You want gold, girl what’s next
Its me and you, doing the sex
So now you know I’m just a freak
Give it up baby, I can’t wait two weeks
I want it all, Don’t say I won't
Get it girl, now I’m telling you don’t

[Verse 2: Entice and Barbie of The Danger Zone]
Nigga please, you provoke no feeling
You must of forgot, the girls of whom you're dealing
We haven't the urge, to get busy
Like those dizy lizys, who used to dance for you, your through
I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted
You're addicted, to the words you inflicted
Time after time, line after line
Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you $hort because of your height or your width?
Diss me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky, your a dinky
It's an easy task, to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
Your a freak with no tale
You have no ass, class,you can't pass, your simply trash
Your a typical nigga, the kind you don't take home
This is Entyce and Barbie from the Danger Zone
Like a short dogg that carries fleas
You make my ass itch, twitch, don't you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits cause your all up on it...

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Get mad if you want, I won't front
When it's time to hump, won't be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too $hort baby all in them guts
I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet
Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet
It's just a freaky note, from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew
Like every other nigga in my crew
I bump hoes, now it's your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Won't sell you dope or sell you blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby, You know what I want
Your acting like it's that time of the month
Are you bleeding, can't think about sex
Irritated by your Kotex
We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck
I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck
Now here, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't...

[Verse 4: Entice and Barbie of The Danger Zone]
Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer
And most definately, not a dick pleaser
You dreaming, and scheaming, and fiending for my lust
You don't have enough, for you I feel disgust
Wait, small thing I hate
For goodness sakes, if I wanted someone small I would masturbate
I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream
When I say too short, you know what I mean
You see, I need man, not a boy to approach me
Your lame game, really insults me
Your name is Too $hort, or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny
Little boy, your not a player
I'm your savior
To try to get at me shows audacious behavior
I've got to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy, here's a proposition
You wanna bit of danger, Step into my zone
You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home
With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining
Dare to say you got some? Nigga please your lying
Cause to fight the feeling, there would have to be one
And mathmatically, me plus you equals none...

[Verse 5: Rappin 4-Tay]
I am the rapper that they call 4-tay
I'm gon tell you like my homie Short Dogg would say
Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then it's cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang, but she said no
That's about as far as it's going to go
So I toss and turn, to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep, that's how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you ain't with it
The rest of you freaks just won't admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Ain't nobody tripping cuz I know I'm right
You could be black or you could be white
For a black girl it really don't take too long
But a white girl's always tryin to turn ya on
With a little squeze, but it's just a tease
Give her some time, she'll be on her knees
Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt
Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut
But don't get me wrong, cause you started it all
Coming to my house in a camisole
But when it's time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight, don't want to serve it
Gave it some time, so make up your mind
Don't fight the feeling, it's time to unwind
You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
But I'm Rappin 4 Tay it don't make me none...

[Verse 6: Too $hort]
Yeah man, the little hoes got ill
So now it's time to get way too real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank ho
Go get your bank ho
My little dick'll have you screaming no
Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up
Your still playing that finger fuck
See I'm a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts, not big mouths
I know some little girls'll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down, give you some head
But little girl, you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain cuz your way too young
So at this point, I really can't say shit
Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch...Beyotch!!![Phone rings]
Lady: Ragtop records, may I help you?
Fly: Can I speak to Fo?
Lady: One moment please, he's around
4-Tay: Yo, wassup?
Fly: Wassup, Fo? I know you finished that cut for the radio
4-Tay: As a matter of fact Fly I just finished it baby boy, no worry about nothin', I'll be around

[4-Tay]
Regardless if I'm chillin' backstage or on tour
With my homie Young Fly even Al B. Sure
Never hesitate to call me after I'm done
Cause homie I'm real and always true to my loved ones
Too many wakes and funerals full of tears
You say there's something on your mind, well hey, I'm all ears
Cause ain't nobody thinking about the funk that you're choosin' it
A lot of my homies stuck in the pen for life or losin' it
Call up your folks you keep thinkin' about home
Recorder keeps a peep and there's a block on the phone
And all of this is enough to make a brother's nerves bad
Reminds me of a situation that I once had
Spent that, spent this endless relentless tremendous women on my jock
And don't nobody mind their business
He say she say throwin' salt about it
And chooses to talk about you cause there's no one else to talk about
Talk about the show and the flow and all the clout
Then be real with yourself and talk about and turned it out
It's not hard to compete when his name is poppin'
A scared man can never win that's why I stay clockin'
Fools be huffin' and puffin' don't wanna see me about nothin' I'm down
And if you ever need me Fly: I'll be around

[Hook]
Whenever you call me: I'll be there
Whenever you want me: I'll be there
Whenever you need me: I'll be there
I'll be around

Life ain't based on peaches and cream
This new generation lost a whole lot of dreams
Future doctors, producers, and mothers
The list goes on but now we killin' our brothers
And if we killin' our brothers that means we killin' our own kind
These kids is watchin' now it goes to their mind
Rat-tat-a-tat cause you got a gat
Then they want a gat you livin' like that?
Moms ain't cookin' she worked the week straight
If anything she's the one deserves a hot plate
The ghetto, the ghetto ain't nothin' to dream about
Tryin' to get out now that's somethin' to think about
Fools might disagree but I'm a stay sucka free
Now I'm so black and so strong they can't fade me
Blacks are blacks worst enemy there's still no remedy
You got me for a grip do you call yourself kin of me?
Jealousy, envy, I see it in your eyes
Tell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise
I keep it funky it's pretty hard to miss it now it is not explicit
A message for the mind, and a moral for statistics
So I'm doin' what we call a roll call
Talkin' about the ones who won't rap then take a downfall
I spit the street life and then I go underground
You silly, it's called versatility and I'll be around

[Hook]

Things are gettin' crucial you gotta exercise your mind
Or learn about life before you're left behind
But how you gonna get it right when you're not doin' right
When you get mad all you want is a gunfight
This tension causes a gang of madness
Now you want funk that results to sadness
Sadness results to a lot of revenge
And your so called friends really ain't your friends
So how do you know who you're able to trust
If you think about the past look what happened to us
I never trust no one, I only trust myself
Or I would've been a victim like everyone else
In friendship or hardship whenever you need me
Just give me a call G I won't deceive thee
These fools be shakin' best believe they're fakin'
Just tryin' to get a grip of all the money you're makin'
This ain't race a mind is a terrible thing to waste
I drop the rap and J drops the bass
To the flow cause ain't nobody get with Fo
I'm a down young brother comin' straight outta Frisco
Droppin' a message out of love to your town
Love your brothers and sisters and I'll be around

[Hook]Testing one, two, three, four
Rappin 4-tay, Rag Top records, nineteen-ninety-six
West up, let's do this

Yeah Four, you done finally got that parole-CALL
Yeah man, that was long comeing trying get that, man
I understand that Four, but a lot of people don't know
What you've done been through bro'
Man, a brother done been in this rap game for ten years, man
I've been from hell and back, you know Frank
But what you gon' have to do
Is lay it down and lace it up like a shoestring
Ok, like this here...

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Allow me to take you back down memory lane
When a player was so young in this rap game
Yeah, if you had a fight you best to knock a sucker out
Because moms wouldn't about to let you in the house
Yeah, we had to throw em' in the days
Didn't have Glock, never seen a twelve gauge
Wasn't no banging n' gang affiliated deaths
Brother had to go to school in the days to get a rep
Always wanted to bust a gang of these raps
And be the first player to put Frisco on the map
So add this to the list of them hits that be knockin for the new year
I'mma vet in this rappin industry, you wet behind the ear
Shit, I even caught the San Quinton blues
Used to rock that motherfucker every night, I paid my dues

Chorus:

I talked the talk, but now I'm walking the walk
What up, fool! Huh yeah! Yeah! What,what!

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Im from the west but I don't ride the saddle
Used to do a lot of battle
But you money are make your trunk rattle
Ever since the solar system, boys clubbing house parties
Rap contests at Booker T'S, man it was everybody
Snatching it taking it swoop on stuff all the way home
Once me and O' hit the jets, man we was gone
Up the stairs to the vacabt house, thats we're we prctice at
We didn't have a studio so man we had to work with that
No reel to reels, no mic, just the radio
Paper and oen and I was in, the heart of the ghetto
Trying to pursue my dream, trying to make things right
I posted up at other people's shows begging to get the mic
I was kicking down doors, posted up, like the 49ers
All I wanted to do was bust a rap before the headliners
They pushed me to the left, I said alright, that's cool
Now you call my booking agent, everyday, I paid my dues

Chorus:

I talked the talk, but now I'm walking the walk
What up, fool! Huh yeah! Yeah! What,what!

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
The difference is you're talking about the game you see I'm living in
And all my folks R.I.P, I'LL see you in a minute
Before I cut I gots to shock it cause I'm still pissed
For my mistakes, court dates and the time I missed
A lot of deputies in correctional facilities
I kept they ass up all night, but now they feelin me
From bangin on the walls and bustin raps off the top ten
Bet you never though I be the entertainer of the year
But why not, cause I've got, what it takes to represent
Crowd could be a hundred thousand, I'm never hesitant
Just ask Franky J. to drop me an old school beat
Them funky instrumentals kept me of the streets
They kept me motivated, I was always underrated
I bet my real folks wasn't surprised when I made it
Plus I gave them digits back to the parole board
So now I'm cool, I'd been paid my dues

Chorus:

I talked the talk, but now I'm walking the walk
What up, fool! Huh yeah! Yeah! What,what![Celly Cel]
I roll 360 degrees and slidin' to the function
Shirley-locks in my hair, yelling 'Bump Something'
Menage-a-trois, need about three with me in this spot
Mixing up my Drizze while they stizz up on that row, but
See, I'm a ridah, when I flash it ain't nowhere to hide ya
I'm right besides ya 'bout to let these thangs all up inside ya
There ain't no sense tryin' to knock a playa for the way he lounge
Even the haters in your town sing it's going down

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Up in the spot, fool got popped, killed a cop, jumped in a drop
That was the life he lived but now it's honded
Imagine your dome posted on America's Most Wanted
They flowned it and locked him up for conniving
Whether the strong surviving
Or getting pimped by the system
I still be 4 1 5 ing it down to the V
With that fool Celly C E L L
Shakin' it, breakin' it, movin' it with this clientele
With this underground, it's going down
Ha ha

1- [Celly Cel] (Kerry)
Ride with your folks (It's going down)
Sideways in a cloud of smoke (It's going down)
Bumping 'til your amps blow (It's going down)
'Cuz you know it's going down for sure
(Tonight it goes down)

Ride with your folks (It's going down)
Sideways in a cloud of smoke (It's going down)
Bumping 'til your amps blow (It's going down)
'Cuz you know it's going down for sure
(Tonight it goes down)

[E-40]
Get up, uh, I'd like to, uh, dig you when I dug
Biatches ask mah 'How deep is your love?'
Grew up on that: who put dem hickeys on your neck?
Ugh, how many babies did you make off that Keith Sweat?
Don't even trip it's all labexibiali fitty
Hit the clubs and act bad, get them biatches ready
Up on release, Forty youze a cold piece
You hardly war makin', drinkin', shootin' me out, it's soft

[B-Legit]
It's off the fenzo, I ride the Benzo, Bill Clinton, presidential
Out the window, never been, though
Type that get the party loud trunkin'
So they can hear me, I keep 'em leery
With twamps on the S Series
And Cruise Control, gonna take 'em where them hoochies roll
If for some dough, them hoochies down to sell they soul
So, when you see me double-parked, flashing hazard lights
You get it right, cuz, man, it's going down tonight

Repeat 1

Although it ain't gonna be easy but believe me, dog
It's gonna be off the heezy fo' sheezy
And if it ain't, huh, I laugh it off like a joke
And I grab my AK cuz I spray up anybody for my folks in the Bay
On the real, homeboy, I'm a killer
I leave your shirt soakin', no jokin'
So if it's going down tonight
I be on the first thing smokin', so holler at me

[Celly Cel]
It's going down so majorly my pager battery
Stay on low cells while I'm trying to get some mo' mail
Dodgin' hot ones, makin' liquor store runs
Creepin' through the city streets, pervin' and I'm on one
Can't get wrapped up in that "He said she said"
What was said already did, runnin' your mouth will get you filled with lead
So I stay real, soakin' that game outta the hills
Ridin' with that Mazda sound
Now you know it's going down

Repeat 1 to fade[Rappin' 4-Tay]
You see you never talk down on a playa, I'll spray ya
Then break it down to your knee, you best to say a prayer
This funk been a part of my life ever since the startin' gate
Remember me and my nigga $hort Dog way back in '88?
Broke them bitches down with some sexual healing
And man the town ain't been the same since "Don't Fight the Feelin'"
But now your new booty, stayed off in this game on a accident
Copied another niggas style
Punk don't let this rap shit get you broke off
Cause see it's potent like that ain't right
Find a maiden name for yourself, but don't believe the hype
Fool, who you think opened the door for your producer?
If it wasn't for the Dog and them hogg's you wouldn't have a future
And let me add that I could never be scared of ya
Rappin' 4', born and raised off in that Bay Area
Stickin' to that ass like a hot bowl of grits
Hits on top of hits, who you think started this shit?

[Hook]
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' with this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga

[Too $hort]
It's goin' down right now, California mackin' at its best
Somethin' for my niggas on the grind from the West
Cali is my home but its just like yours
Niggas love to get money while they fuck they whores
Hit all the parties, and do the same old shit
Bitches gettin' broke cause the game don't quit
I had a flashback, it was the Oakland Raiders at the Coliseum
We ain't nothin' but players - diamonds glistenin', hoes whistlin'
Bitches know my name cause it's a natural thang
I had to bend a corner, really didn't wanna - punk you's a goner
Heard you was on a - stick up mission, triple-beam in the kitchen
Never shot nobody but I'm damn sure itchin' to blast you
Cause in your dream you shot me
Then you woke up and found out you can't stop me

[Hook]
You see you never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, beotch

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
If buckin' a motherfucker on the mic be a crime
Best believe the police got a APB out on mine
Because I gots more disguises than that fool Inspector Gadget
I'm not a witch, but crystal ball let me have it, ahh
I seen playa hatin' way back from the gate
Now everybody wanna be a P-L-A-Y-A
Why lie to yourself and play the role as a simp?
Knowin' damn well your bitch bought "Shorty the Pimp"
Because they smile in your face
And all the while them motherfuckers wanna take your place

[Too $hort]
That's right 4', we from the old school
Been doin' shows, been comin' tight in studios
Songs on the radio, interviews, and laughs
Up at the mall signin' autographs
And ain't nothin' gon' change in '96
Cause this pimp gotta mack all the finest bitches
And get paid from the game
So they never talk down on a playa's name

[Hook]
You never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, beotch

[MC Breed]
4-Tay, Short Dog, and Breed like this, check me out now
Never that, run it back, sayin' Breed is hatin' you
Takin' you to another level nigga makin' you
And got plenty hoes in the back screamin' "okay!"
Breed fuckin' 'round with 4-Tay
Ice like T out to get payed
$hort Dog bringin' hoes to the pimpery
I - be faded off this Tanqueray daily
Niggas wanna play me but plenty of bitches pay me
Over all I balls more and none test
I keep a gun and I put two off in a niggas chest
And see coincide within the same heartbeat
That's right, now give a motherfucker five feet
Further imformation, I get into meditation
I oughta have yo' ass shakin', I conclude my calculation is -

[Hook] - X 2
You never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, beotch[Intro: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me, that right?
(Only God can judge me now)
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business, really
(Only God can judge me now)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus I try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin' got me knockin' on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me

[Hook: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now

[Flatline]

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
(Flatline!)
I hear the doctor standing over me
Screaming I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes laying here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
Cause everytime I breathe, I think they killing me
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', danglin' my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walking through the cemetery talking to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
Black Power, is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama can you save me? And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin' round strapped
Mister police: please try to see that there's
A million motherfuckers stressing just like me
Only God can judge me

[Hook]

[Interlude: 2Pac]
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
(That's for real)
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
(You know?)
Let me live baby, let me live

[Verse 3: Rappin' 4-Tay]
Pac I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance say a playa hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
To get your safe, knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin' bullets representin' the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin' sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

[2Pac]
Guess you figure you know me cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night club drunk and buzzed
Been living lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me

[Outro: Chorus w/ variations]
[4Tay] Only God mane
[2Pac] That right?
[4Tay] That’s real
[2Pac] Hahahahahaha
[4Tay] Fuck everybody else, ya kno what I’m sayin?
[2Pac] Man, look here man
My only fear of death is comin back to this bitch reincarnated
That’s for the homey mental
We up out[Hook]
Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool or kick it in the tub
Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 1]
I got a ho named Reel-to-Reel
She got a buddy named SP 12, now you know the deal
We gets freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are coming real tight
Something to roll to, something to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money, mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till these women get the notion that they running the game huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worsen
Fillmore, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the playaz club

[Hook]

(more champagne, Mr. Forte?)

[Verse 2]
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
Words out 4-Tay's out rappable
Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
Cause the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin 4-Tay, I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' off them suckas popping off at the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro
Leave the Gat at the house bring some dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your macking at these women at the playaz club

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now homie what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
Some of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start drifting in the wrong direction
Miss goody two sure see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the playaz club[Too $hort]
What?
You say what?
The president did what?
Ah man, that's hey, that's all good baby
He got rid of the player haters too?
Ah man, we need to declare this a national holiday
We gonna call this Players Holiday
Ant B-Z what up man?

[Ant Banks]
Rise and shine, make you wanna say
Dear God, let me thank you for another day
For livin' life on the edge and I'm tryin' to break it
Tired of duckin' the Feds, but it's a struggle to make it
So this is your day homey, now it's time to shine
If a player's only trickin', you can wine and dine
Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it

[Mac Mall]
It feels good not to grind no more
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal
Livin' life truly successful
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other cause brother we all in
Beautiful black women give 'em much respect
And ain't no funk 'tween the east and the west
It's just a Player Holiday

1 - Today's the day the Players play
So you better be on your way
(On your way, your way)
Now it's time to celebrate
Hurry up and don't be late
Cause you know it's gonna be a lovely day

2 - Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
(A lovely day)
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

[Too $hort]
January 1 the year 2000
We gettin' all the money and we ain't through clownin'
You can tell everybody that stays around your way
Today is the official Player's Holiday
Short Dog I'm lovin' every minute of it
Cause pimpin's been around since the beginning of it
We barbecuin' chicken, that's what we doin'
Buy some breezys and we kickin'
And Cap what you doin?

[Captain Save Em]
I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop
Puttin' it together like a racing track
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at?
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble
So keep your head up
And know that things are changing for the better
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids
Forget about you, never

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

[Ant Banks]
Now all the real players throw your Rollies in The air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
From side to side and from front to back
Throw the peace sign baby, show me where you at
Dollar bill y'all, and we could scream it out loud
And Mac Mall's here, homey that can move the crowd
So what the deal with you nigga, you could cross the town
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown

[Rappin 4-tay]
None of the homies got pop
None of the spots got batteram
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin'
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin'
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club baby
A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days

Repeat 2

[Mac Mall]
Mama used to put my clothes on layaway
Now I'm dipped everyday and every C-note got big face
Holler at me man, used to ride the back of the bus
Now I'm spinnin V-12's though the times is rough
In God we trust haters, you can only hate us
But can't front cause you knew that we was bound to blow up
Gettin' paid what we can, Short Dog and Ant Banks
Mac Mall do it big on a Players Holiday, yeahI wanna muse you, not confuse you
Later on, I might wanna use you
For about an hour, me and my power
It doesn't matter if you scream and holler
Cause I'm bigging, when I'm digging
You wanna stop? You must be kidding
The best is yet to come, hit the kick drum
Keep dancing 'till your feet get numb
Rely on the 4, the T, the A, the Y guy
I'm so fresh and if you wanna know why
Then listen. I'm never missing
Suckas be dissing, they're never pissing
Me off track
Cause I'm much bigger than that
If you're not moving your feet
Something's wrong, my job is not complete
Let the DJ spin the wheels
While I test my lyrical skills, that's real
This is the one I made to kick the fresh sound
You new homies can put your mack hand down
And bump the beat all day in your ride
It gets real ill on the other side
Hold it, pause, keep that position
Cut the beat cause I got a proposition
If I can promise to rap to the right stuff
You can sweat and get wet enough
I mean really though
Maybe I can put you in my video
I'm popping cause I must not confuse you[Intro: Snoop Dogg] + (Roger Troutman in backround)
Yeeah, throw it up throw it up, (what what?)
Eastside (what what?), Dogg Pound, what what what what? (what?)
Yeeah, Snoop Dogg up in there, what up, what up? yeeah... D.P.G

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Dogg from the "Beach" Eastside on mine
I'm striking through the hood
While I'm slanging my goods
I'm hollaring at my folks (what up?), rolling up some dope
4-Tay from the Bay they say we West Coast folks, you know (you know)
We can't be nothing but that (but that)
And when you bust we bust right back
No play, 4-Tay tell them about the Dogg
I dip to the Bay then get the money y'all
I catch a plane with the gang, purple on my brain
That nigga, that nigga done done it again
Still my nigga, for real my nigga
D.P.G.C. it's a big deal my nigga
Wherever we go we represent the turf until it hurt
Long Beach niggas will rush you to the dirt (nigga)
Eastsidaz, real riders
Throw it up like you know it up, throw it up

[Hook (1): Tray Deee] + (Roger Troutman)
Throw it up, yeah (oooh ooooooh oooh, throw it up!)
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
All the homies on the Eastside where the G's ride
Do your thug thing homie, throw it up (throw it up, oooh ooooooh oooh)
All the homies on the West Side, yeah (throw it up!)
All the homies on the West Side (throw it up!) throw it up throw it up
Throw it up throw it up, do your thug thing

[Verse 2: Rappin' 4-Tay]
Pressure bust pipes, we bust raps
Niggas don't want funk cause we bust caps
Get off in the zone then I'm in and blaze up
You ain't about your cheese I'd advise you to raise up
Cowards can't kick it cause the game don't mix right
That's like bringing a butter knife to a gun fight
I kick it with the sickest from the Bay to L.A
We get the figures, squeeze them triggers if you stepping our way
4-Tay from the Sco (San Francisco) with Snoop D-O double
Players, gangsters, hustlers, you motherfuckers in trouble
Critically acclaimed, this men is his nemesis, ain't no end to this
My mind playing tricks on me - I'm seeing images
Fish tailing, inhaling, bailing, positive suspension
Don't hate on a player cause I'm staying on a mission
Nigga, get yours hit the billboards and bust
For Roger Troutman, we gone give it up, we gone throw it up

[Hook (2): Tray Deee] + (Roger Troutman)
Throw it up, yeah (oooh ooooooh oooh, throw it up!)
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
All the homies on the Eastside where the G's ride
Do your thug thing homie, throw it up (throw it up, oooh ooooooh oooh)
All the homies on the West Side, yeah (throw it up!)
All the homies on the West Side (throw it up!) throw it up throw it up
Throw it up throw it up, do your thug thing
Throw it up, all my homies on the South Side yeah, get live get live
Throw it up throw it up, throw it up
All my homies on the North, throw it up throw it up
Yeah just throw it up, throw it up throw it up throw it up
(Throw it up throw it up throw it up...)

[Verse 3: Tray Deee]
I keep it sparking, heat is barking, daylight to darkness
Known for doing wrong, getting ours regardless
We come up out the ghetto, never settle for chump change
We out there running things doing our thug thing
Game recognize and I been checking mine
Gang of suckers try, get them lame second tries
We G'd up, C'd up sipping, blazing weed up
Haters steady playing but ain't ready yet to see us
We bust big caps, restless with your chit-chat
Player, where your chips at?, broke?, you better fix that
If you ain't a hustler you must of been a buster
It's all about who falling out the game and who running
Done it all like a hog calling the dogs
Never sleep, never slip and not often I pause
Tray Deee, way G, known to flow and blow it up
And make everybody in the party throw it up

[Hook (2): Tray Deee] + (Roger Troutman)

[Outro: Tray Deee]
Rest in peace Roger Troutman, this for you homie
All y'all throw it up[Intro: Rappin' 4-Tay] + (E-40)
Uh, (you tell me)

[Hook: Rappin' 4-Tay, E-40]

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Holler at a player though
40 Water, what's wrong wit the game though?
I don't know

[E-40]
Holler at a player though
4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Rappin' 4-Tay]
I keeps my distance from haters cause I'm quick to flash
Area takes me with a passion, I tap that ass
Be quick to blast, the game just ain't the same no more
You doing too much, pump your brakes, slow your roll
Fucking up the hustle with the streets and shit
It's too much legal tender on my agenda to bite our fame
But if you play me, I gots no choice to reach you in check
They playing with a full deck, you can get the breakfast, say thanks

[Verse 2: E-40]
See I'm a business man with a set of big balls
Marketing meetings and, uh, got Frisco
Just ain't your work for a living (uh huh)
They got hit, what the fuck?, you think I been got shit?, it ain't easy
Everyday now walk through the streets
A nigga can't even sit down with his family
And be straight and have a decent dinner
Without a motherfucker yelling, "Refalations"
"What I got to do to get you in my compilations?" (compilations)
So I study what I do, the shit for you for free (for free)
I used to do that to a nigga when I was seventeen (uh, uh)

[Hook: Rappin' 4-Tay, E-40]

[Verse 3: Rappin' 4-Tay]
What's the world coming to when niggas talk down for fun
Some Rappin' 4-Tay you don't make me dumb
Pop a cherry, we don't mean that much
Cause if it don't make dollars I don't really give a fuck
Jocking all up under my name but you don't even know me
Got me fucked up and one of them suckers when they so called homies
If that's the shit, better pause and magnum or Crip, they ready to paint us
When niggas go against the great 40 Water, what's wrong with the game?

[Verse 4: E-40]
I'm ten years hung in this shit, if I was up to heart
My nigga got dick, her is his, by selling chicks in front of his car
Got a crib with 9,000 square, Christine and Marsha, will you just imagine?
Big ass improving for Maximus, big ass, let's fetch it
I seen it in my dream when I was nine years old
My Momma always told me to achieve my goal
Keep a cool bid and, uh, respect a dollar
Never get too greedy for the money and power

[Hook: E-40, Rappin' 4-Tay]

[Verse 5: E-40]
The reason I carry Glocks, 26 on my side of my hip
Cause I ain't dumping now (dumping now), thinking of now a days
They act like you owe something (something)
Talking about, "40, show me some love!, (show me some love!)"
Because I got a, a despot im my blood
Niggas want to knock ME
Cause I don't blossom like a sunflower SEED
Surrounded by promises, you said that you keeps me smoking big WEED
Drinking while sipping Ale (sipping Ale) yes INDEED
Born and raised in Vallejo (eeehhhh!)

[Verse 6: Rappin' 4-Tay]
They claim they got solid rockets
So all my true player partners, y'all just stay focused
And watch them haters cause they plots on a daily basis
Hustlers, servants, traders that caught so many dope cases
And but I want the quickness if the G's is right
If that game was tight, ballers had pimped at it, ain't no such thing as
Three strikes
No sense, our fucking minds aren't, but I'm on parole and shit
Niggas get to running off at the mouth just like a snitch, some like a bitch
Ehhh!, Ehhh!

[Hook: Rappin' 4-Tay, E-40]

[Hook: E-40, Rappin' 4-Tay]

[Outro: E-40]
What's wrong wit the game?
Can't get caught off with the game
Just get my chips and get paid
Holler at a player though
4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?
Holler at a player though
Holler at a player though
4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?
Huh?[Intro]

Could never be a minute man, damn good love maker
How about a playa though?

Shallow and deeper than a ritual
Really don’t make me none
Because I’m packing a thang long
And wanna hit It all night long
Spread them like wings
In the valley on the couch
While you biting the lip
I try to dig my way out
In the California fashion
Is going down passion
Yeah we got action
In the hot to relax in
Rocks dissening, scandal hoes whispering
Obeying the monopoly
Trick is a natural thang
From the bassline kicks to the snare drums
Servin like they deserve  it , baby

[Verse 2:Soul Depot]
So niggas in the room
Excuse me my game is way to tight
Got my niggas bout to ride to that money, money eastside
Show me flippin the script
And now them haters is [?]
So let a nigga know, where you from biatch
Gotta be the bomb for know what’s up

Haters wanna fuck , but they can’t fade the bomb
I’mma show you how to pop the trunk if you got some funk
It’s all about the Eastside (Sure you right)
That’s the player
Much love to them hustlers, them players and the tale

[Passion Hook]
That’s for the player
Where you, baby?

[Verse 3:Too Short]
Too Short!
I saw you walking down the street and I had stop
Turned up the radio and drop the top
I Say you look so good and yea so fine
I take you to my house we spend some time
It ain’t no secret  I’m just a freak
I’m from the Oaktown bitch I came way to weak
So just break me off and don’t say I want
Get it girl now tell me you don’t

[Verse 4:Passion]
All around the Bay my name is known
Cause nigga it’s another hit song
Passion is the player
Got game for them tricks
Cause that’s how we do it in Oakland biatch
Flipping that shit ain’t a thang for me
Cause I’m the real bitch that you try to be
And they better believe I’mma get mine
Damn straight down for the skrilla
Holdin’ down the folks staying true for my niggas
Hoes dropping gotta know I got to pimp this shit
So I step zone up and I gets my grip
The Sideways on a trick who be hatin on my riches
Because I got the niggas jacking like bitches
But ain’t no playas like the ones I got
Short Dog and 4-Tay see the pimpin’ don’t stop
And if you wanna be down with a player
Don’t front throw your motherfuckin hands in the air

[Hook]

That’s for the player
Where you,baby?
But this shouldn’t show me where you atWelcome to San Quentin Prison Westblock
And you don't run a motherfuckin' thang in here
So shut the fuck up and keep your eyes facin' the wall
My name is Lt. I Don't Give A Fuck
Now stretch

I just got of the grey goose
Hear at San Quentin Westblock, I hear they be gettin' loose
So allow me to scope the scene out
And find my folks, relatives, real playaz, I know they turnin' it out
Slangin' them thangs, police pop and now wit a Glock
I'm lookin' for that buster, that truster who be callin' them shots
Cause he's the same sucker who got my folks stuck
Fool, he didn't give a fuck, so why should I give a fuck?
Revenge is a motherfucker, Imma be that sucker ducker
Creepin' wit my until blade you feel that mother
All up in your testikels I turn you in to a vegetable
Dissect that ass, yeah something extra-terrestrial
Cause it's a different ballgame behind these walls
And if ya soft than all the niggas gone get them drawz
And take ya manhood, you can't have it back silly rabbit
Now you gone call up your bitch
And tell her they turned you into a faggot

Chorus:
Ya best ta think twice, cause it ain't nathen nice
What you wanna do, one of them foolz wit 25-2-Life
And if ya never did time before
That means you keep it legit, makin' it smooth
Handlin' business, stay on your toes

Man, they got me in this orange jumpsuit
I'm goin' crazy as hell, live in a cell, sippin' cup of noodle soup
I know they think a nigga's gone insane
Because I stood at this funny style motherfucker ...
He was out to get me first, I just happened to get him quicker
A victim of circumstances, plus my blade was much thicker
You wanna be gangsters behind these walls it's so much drama
I done seen the hardest nigga switch up and call home to momma
There's really no guarantee you make it to society
So all you perpetrator gonna find out what you wanna be
Just a few words, some game plus a little advice
I got from my O.G. in the pen servin' the 25-2-Life

Chorus

I hear you claim to be the hardest induvidual
Can't nobody fade you, your mentality is more like criminal
Whenever there's drama or funk they say you handle the static
Yeah, you tha man, you and that fully automatic
Stepped up and swept up every turf wit disagreements
And every bitch that havin' a bowl of some of that ...
But ain't it a shame you can only travel across the streets to the store
They don't even trust you and that mother cause you robbed it before
Got you a sack of that yack and snored it, and snored it up
Than robbed another nigga the cut cause you didn't give a fuck
Everybody is blessed wit tha devil, he be a motherfucker
Get him off your back, get 'em off yo back before you kill your brother
On some of that kokane shit gets crazy I done seen it
Waked up the next day talkin' bout man I really didn't mean it
Lost all your love and all your trust, somebody is fuckin' your wife
You shot that nigga, that's why you servin' 25-2-Life

Choppin major game on the strength
Man we goes back juss like them splinters an 'em temps, uh
Met this bitch that was in Houston, said she was from Houston
Said her profession was stackin major paper roll

Nigga all of us got kids, an only got one life to live

But my crew run like the Mafia
Eightball, 4-Tay, Banks, an 40 Water
An me Bossalini, Freddy Chico, Chanelle shit
Met a couple of inncidents where some niggas tried to kill me
Juss a part of the game
Jelous niggas out fo fame
When steady bustin at me

But when they runnin up on this muthafuckin Don
They catchin pieces of hell
Hot slugs from a nigga that's fresh out on bail

(*Eightball*)

Long time comin baby
Somewhere off in the hills
Me an 40 Waters choppin it up, keep or kill
On the real about this underground lifestyle
Intoxicated
An always heavily sedated
Bank's rocks the beat
I grab the mic an bust
Turn into a monster
Eatin weak mc's up
Smokin trees up
Pinnin hoes knees up
Feds wouldn't ease up
Had to put the keys up
Findin Jesus prayin fo the weak
Hopin somebody's on they knees prayin fo me
In the midnight hour somewhere on them drugs
In a room full 'o thugs, 40 tell em how it was

(*E-40*)

They shot my mama's house up, back in 1992('92)
I keep goin back an play possum like I don't know who
If I knew who, what, when, where an how
If I knew back then, would I know now?
The rap game ain't never gonna be decreasin
The only thing the rap game
Gonna keep on doin is increasin(increasin)
There will be no over-night sensations
Them 40, Eightball, MJG, only drip
We been layin it down since trout season
Now all of a sudden I look good as Toni Braxton
In a white house wit toys of traction
Uppercussion, ya may wanna take a second look
You can find me in the Florida designs book
The hall of game, is a 420 wit chrome rims all day(all day)
Parked up on ???
Nigga this ain't none of that
Only reason I'm doin a song wit dude an 'em is cuz I want they region
Recognize game, game recognize game
Can't be no bigga pimp than me nigga

[Cameosis]
Sisters at the club, searching for sugar daddies and baby daddies
Ask me do I wanna ride, in the back seat of that caddy
Leave it to me
I be driving them niggas so cold
Give them one lapdance, the booty'll get me so so far
I gets nothin'
But them papi chulos
Take it to the tele
Leave your ho out by my pillow
I know it's to go, to the gold
Chain, the gold ring got me coming again and again
For them big thangs
Lick me on my million dollar clit ring

[Don Cisco]
It's Mister Big Bank
My model strike it rich like lotto
Clockin' dollars, collars stay popped like champagne bottles
Picture me toastin'
With passion at the bar
Cristol clashin'
Lookin' like a storm with my jewels flashin'
Paparazzi
Shootin' flicks, cameras flashin'
All my thugs in the club, we're here
In mob fashion
In the back, the club's shacked up
We the super bad
Hush, pop the game like a clutch
What

Album:  Dangerous Minds Soundtrack
Song:   A Message For Your Mind

Ain't nobody gettin no younger, man, we're just gettin older and
We need to get bolder than bold as we've ever been
Our reference as Africans, where our folks sittin
They cryin out laughin
The game is all you know so you in it to win it, right?
Trippin, a gang o' bullets, decided to find a fight
Life is scattered in directions, brotherly connections
Misguided youth driftin in the wrong direction
I hope for the best and say a prayer and keep steppin
Too many kids they own an automatic weapon
A lot of them wanna go home instead of hangin out
It's kinda hard when you're parents' straight smoked out
For you fisters, stay prepared for the up and coming
Get all you can while you can and result to something
You be surprised with this talent that we hold
But we forget and go sick outta control
A lotta homies to die, they left a true lesson
Or fill your soul that I love, this another blessing
You want funk, it used to be bing-bing
To the dome, but nah now it's really on
Go out back, what? To just to be reputable?
Hope you don't lose your life, fools are goin federal
I'm goin forward, showin em up like a pimp
And gettin the truck, you can sell each other profit
Don't let police try to grab you by your shirt collar
You witta black man, who understands black power
Pipin hot, are you the bad brother?
I love to roll rhymes, see my homeboys stickin together
Stay focused cos there's too many blind
Blind to the purpose of life and that's a message for your mind

Chorus:

Tried the dope about a thousand times
So here's a message for your mind
*Repeat x 4*

I once knew a man who couldn't read
He said "It ain't no thang cause
I graduated twice with the game I possess"
Bullet-proof vest to the chest
But when his kids needed help to prepare for a test
It was stress cos Pops ain't acheiving in academics
It's true indeed, his problem is an epidemic
Who wanna work five long hard days through it?
And get tax, I guess somebody gotta do it
So take coke, rock it up brick-solid
Ain't nobody thinkin about a checks up ??? wallet
Kids are growin up with the train of thought
The motion the parents talk, the trip on the *?dopest bar?*
Now look at the man you fought, he was as black as you
Sweated ya money, it wasn't funny so you did what'cha had to do
How many brothers will be taken out by another brother?
Give a talk show a whole lot to talk about
It's me and my microphone, it's you and your 9
And that's fine, well here's a message for your mind

Chorus

The next verse is out for the chicks
Ho's are to be chosen, nightclub or taking flicks?
The homey might be roughy with a tandy-out Mercedes
Called a girl a 'female dog', well she's a lady
Run into the wrong one, a strong one, a smart man coast her
She pushed you to the left and turned her off when you approached her
You tripped and dissed her, you bashed the sister
And even when you drove off, you couldn't resist her
Solution:Better go, homey, leave her P
Cos you know like I know there's plenty fish in the sea
There's more women in this world than men, for fact, I'm right
Just because she's superfine that doesn't mean that's your type
Briefcase, white shirt, tie and a sportscoat
A hella gold, ???, servin ya friend's dough
Friends are friends then or friends come good friends
A helpin hand in understandin, wants to invite you in
Man's your best friend, boyfriend and girlfriend
It's like a soap opera in this world that we're living in
Misconception from a blink or a wink
He want to get married and all she want is a drink
But it really don't help when you supposed to be faithful
He bought you a boat load and paid for ya cases
Kept it comin, the brother went wrong for expecting some
Got knocked out by ya spouse, now ya started some
It seems strange but these fools are taking people out
For the woman that they love and truly care about
It's understandable, but will hurts when she's givin in
Now was it reaaly worth a life sentence in the pen?
No get-back, nothin but a jail song
A homey told ya that you're woman had it goin on
Now ya stuck and she's on the prowl gettin wined and dined
Damn, now that's a message for your mind

Chorus

Outro

His pocket's fat and his dove is too. He huhGet a dose of my brand new twist
For your tape or compact disc
I'm no man when I'm off the indo
With a proper tempo and an instrumental
I get so sick my homies know this
So kick on back because a player wrote this
Type a rap you know the beat is phat
And when I leave the party homies said you did that
It's a bay thing an everyday thing
You do your thing and I'll do my thing
I take the mic I like to rip it up
And if you call my bluff I'm like "Nigga what?"
I am the rapper, 4-Tay
Don't crowd me fool because your in my way
I gotta run you over, hit the gas
Buck in the next lane on that ass
I bet you never thought I had the capability
It's ninety-foe and I know that you feel me
Fools are comin way too ill-iac
But a gang a the fools is comin way too whack
I'm a drop another one for ninety-five
But it's ninety-foe 4-Tay has arrived
Fresh out the lab a little dab
Hit the sucka with a right then a jab
Callin the kayo misscomayayo
Then you gotta problem with a fool outta Frisco
Now I'm off a that dank and gin, oh shit 4-Tay is back again

Chorus: Now I'm off a that dank and gin, (Foe baby where you been)
Oh shit 4-Tay is back again, In the studio clockin ends
(x2)

Somebody hold me hold me, I'm getting hyper
A secretary couldn't fade me on a typewriter
All these concepts and new arrivals
For ninety-foe I'm dropping fourteen titles
Walk with this, ride with this, slide with this
Still guaranteed to move yo hips
So do what cha wanna girls get sassy
Oh get to talkin bout oooooh that's nasty
What's nasty the way you dancin
Shakein you pants and
Niggas be glancin
Don't blame it on the Rag Top mob
Your just doin your thing I'm doin my job
To a faster pace I lace the beat nicely
Once again friends it's so spicy
Finger lickin, never getting caught up no mo
Suckas wanna see me stretched out on death row
Instead of rockin every crowd that I run into
But they can't fade me and sure can't fade you
From Frisco to Oaktown dank is smokin
Vallejo to San Jo niggas choking
I'm a do my part don't fight the feelin
Oh shit 4-Tay is back again

Chorus (x2)
