They screaming, they bleeding from they nose
But when we start to swing, we making niggas hit the flo'
Ain't no game off in this thing, we be deep off in yo party

[Verse 2: Princess]
Yeah, we knucking and bucking and ready to fight
I betcha I'mma throw them things, so haters best to think twice
See, me, I ain't nothing nice, and Crime Mob, it ain't no stopping

Now they steady gum popping and I am acting a fool
I wish a hater would get crunk up on this Crime Mob crew
Now enough is enough, boy, rough and get stuffed, boy
Luck is a must, boy, knuck if you buck, boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Scrappy]
Jumping off from on the stage, throwing bows like Johnny Cage
All my niggas starting riots, knocking down the barricade
Ellenwood, we be too deep, and M.O.B. is too elite
Flawless niggas, lawless, you'll be jawless getting close to me
Bullets busting constantly, rapping in yo city streets
Broken bones lay alone, scattered 'cross the concrete
Knucking if you bucking, you'll be ducking if you get too close
In my eyes, you wasn't wise, I think it's time I knuck you, ho

[Verse 4: Diamond]
I come in the club, shaking my dreads
Throwing these bows and busting these heads
Bitch, you irrelevant, step to my residence

Not leaving a trace, not leaving a line
We knucking and bucking cause I got a nine
I blow you away cause you wasting my time
Stupid ass niggas, I know what to do
I waste yo ass, you fuck with my crew
I'm through with you haters, so watch what you do
You talking 'bout me, then I'm talking to you

You busting on me and that shit gon' get nasty

I target your city but you cannot tell

[Verse 5: Killa C]
Knuck if you buck, boy, but you betta come equip
I got some shit off in my trunk that's gonna make yo body flip
Hollow tips, busting out the rib soon as I hit the do'
Anybody make a false move, dead bodies on the flo'
Fucking with no hoes, ain't never been no lames
Ain't never been no pussy niggas scared to throw them things, mane
Crime mob niggas up in this bitch, Break Bread Records I represent

Never settle for less but always strive for the best
Most these niggas playing chief will put you straight to the test

Trying to get with me is like naps through a comb
They call me Don P aka "Corleone"
Up in the club with my Cartiers on
Don't know if I'm high, drunk, or getting my roll on
He on the cell "Can ya hear me?"

Get crunk out your brains when I spit this verse
I'm a blood-sucking vampire, my venom is worse
Head Bustas deal with dangerous thirsts
Shatter your bones in your chest and make your motherfuckin' heart burst
Don't worry now, best of the South on the map
Knock your thoughts out and leave your brains on your lap
Don't touch my Kangol, shorty... what's wrong with you?

[Hook] x2

[Young Buck]
Two step with me, let me show you how it goes

You wanna shine, it ain't hard, just get on your grind
We keep a bankroll, wallet full of credit cards
Cup full of Cristal, box full of cigars
Dirty South tatted on my back, I'm country
She said she like the way I talk, these hoes love me
Club goin crazy, we throwin out stacks

Mouth full of blood, and soul full of heat (oooh!)
Why you tryna act hard as hell
And you know damn well you don't wanna feel the shell

If a nigga fall (fall)
That's when shit gets worse
The problem with you niggas is

Man swang on a nigga, and fuck his ass up
And you can walk on by with yo nuts in a tub

Gettin' buck if you wanna and catch a bow

[Verse Two: Lil Scrappy]
My brain is taking in too much pain
I'm bout to explode first, and then take names
But it's cool lil' shorty don't be so alarmed
I learned to buck nigga when I jabbed in the arm

Make you hold your breath longer than the Navy Seal
And them bows gon' leave you ass dead in the past
Ain't no way you can differ your dick from your ass

I drop bows wit my nigga fuck hoes wit my nigga
How the fuck you think I feel about this arm in your figure
It's a closed casket for them hating bastards
It's some G's that's real, it's a mess of faggots
Who you talkin' to bitch, what you gon' do trick
When it's obvious to see that you ain' t do shit
Lil Scrappy the prince and I ain't takin' no junk

[Hook]

[Vamp till end][Verse One: T.I.]
Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South
When, they ain't runnin a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin
It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin for a livin
It's, mo' because of what I do and how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
(Niggas feelings) And still chillin on Simpson in Center Hillin'
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

[Verse Two: Lil Scrappy]
I'm the prince shorty don't get it twisted
Been callin shots since before my flows existed
And still find birds in my momma kitchen
You might see me burnin purple in the subdivision
I got soldiers on deck, babyface pimpin
Whatchu' know 'bout dat, I get a bad Brenda
With that vert' top back, my jeans feelin tight
Cause my pockets stay fat, playa better know that
My neck got so much shit, danglin
Big dick, big chain, we just keep on hangin
Got a Hollywood ho, and a broad that be sangin
They be hatin cause I'm famous {?} what I was thankin
And this for every don nigga thankin he passed me
Y'all just thank that you gone and the shit'll be nasty
I'mma stay ballin, ballin off my old school classic
Lil Scrap got big bank, now see if you can match it

[Hook]

[Verse Three: P$C]
Shorty I'm down with the kings, so call me the greatest
Number one hustler, I keep the street blazin
If the grapes don't sell, I dry 'em up and sell raisins
While y'all cherry pickin hustlers out here slavin
That king shit nigga runs deep in my veins
Pump through my heart, live in my bone marrow mayne
That's pimpin! My gas is premium like octane
Cain't tell me nuttin 'bout stackin these Benja-maynes
I'm the king of the Dirty, see me seated in the throne
Overruled other dudes like Caesar did in Rome
With a prince that's so demandin and an aura so strong
The South ain't been represented like this in so long
I'm an emperor, you best be glad I'm workin on my temper
Otherwise I'd cock a pistol, send some missiles to your temple
Disrespect us I'mma blick 'em 'til I get you plain and simple
Brass knuckles to your dentals blast suckers in they dimples

[Hook]

[T.I.] I'm a king[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Question; What y'all know about swangers on slab
30's on a Hummer with the butterfly doors
Lucky Charm teeth, lack on them D's
Chevy sitting high, iced out everythang
Stacks on deck, no bank
What y'all know about five of the hottest young niggas in the game
Bow Wow, Short Dawg, Scrappy
The boy Lil' Wayne, the homie Pimp C
We got a little story to tell y'all bout where we come from

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I come from where a Chevy with a trunk full of bump is all that's wanted
And the year don't matter long as you throw some, throw some Ds on it
Mouth cost more than your house, house on ten acres
And the inside so fly niggas call me Jim Baker
From Ohio to Texas, we're so infectious
A-T-L to S-T-L it's gon' be hard to catch us
I'm talking bout bills sipping on bar
Drinking crunk, living like there's no tomorrow
See out-of-towners can't understand, cause I cut all my words short
Popping Texas, mandatory, Saturday at the mall
Hoods ain't hoods, they called wars and zones
Guns cart choppers and when it's on, it's on
See the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, hear me out
Said the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, now answer me this

[Hook x4: Pimp C]
Unh, now what y'all know about the country boys
Coming down with candy toys, playing hard talking noise

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
The boy country like overalls you know that dawg
Catch me in the slab, the same color as Bubu's rust
Cruising up the Ave and I'm probably gon give yo' ho a call
Cuz I ball hard and I'm stuntin' like there's no tomorrow
So yesterday, I swear I spent about fifty G's
On a wristwatch that shine brighter that a Christmas tree
If you was getting cheese, you would probably spend it, too
So don't hate me cause I blow paper like the wind do
And hop out clean, so watch out, Queen
I'm the biggest balla in Houston homie, not Yao Ming
I'm getting money maine, so my pockets hella chubby
And I be sipping drank that's purple like a Teletubby
So when it comes to the women dog, I can tell they love me
They put they panties in a envelope an mail 'em to me
Now how's that for some fanmail
But me an Bow got a question, know the answer, raise your hand, yea

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Lil' Scrappy]
They call me Fisher Price cause all I do is play nice
And I ain't gon run a gang of gorillas that love to fight
I'm the Iceman, I'm far away from the sun
But I'm still hot like a bullet pushing up out a gun
My charger look like a muscle lifting a ton
If you picking on me, yea you picked the right one
You passed another drink and I'm sipping another one
You trust me with the blunt and I'm blowing myself a blunt
Got a Fruit Loop Coupe looking like orange juice
When them niggas see the troop, they don't be knowing what to do
Yea I'm Scrap, greatest young nigga in the nation
Y'all niggas quit hating on the money that I'm making
I'm just country

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]
Look they call me Wayne, dirty south chaperone
So far ahead in the race, I don't know which lap I'm on
No homo, Young Louisiana
Hit you wit the .357 like MC Hammer
And money talks, so that's my grammar
If you ain't about money, you can step like a gamma
Am I the illest doing this? Hell yeah
I am fresher than the Prince of Bel-Air
And OG kush I what you smell here
Smoking the biggest blunts, don't worry I brought a spare
They say I'm at the top, but I'm almost there
And when I get, I will sit, don't worry I brought a chair
I put ice all over the Audemar
Piguet watchface, now time is hard to tell
And I will do whatever The Carter shall
So hot, going out with me is like going to hell

[Refrain]$50 thousand stuck into my Louis bag
I'm married to the game, call it my newlywed

Born broke nigga, I been on the hustle since
Now my niggas on the board holding corporate meetings
I feel like what I live like
Dead president: covered up in green and white
Oh I love that
Rack up 50 thousand bitch, then it's good night

[Hook]
$50 thousand stuck into my Louis bag
I'm married to the game, call it my newlywed

Live broke or die rich: gotta be persistent
And when I look into my daughter's eyes
It gives a nigga chills

I started with a C-note
Got 2 50-slabs and chopped it
Chopped the whole ounce into 20's then I hit the door
Went in for the 9-piece, now my trap is going live
Now I got enough for a whole thing, so holla back
I call up my connect, tell him I'm ready for the pigeon
Light a tree up bitch![Refrain]
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
If you ain't from round here dog don't even come around
Twist your fingers up bang motherfucker bang
Throw your hoods up bang motherfucker bang
Eastside
Hit em up bang motherfucker bang
Westside
Hit em up, bang motherfucker bang

[Verse1: Young Jeezy]
Do your thug thing gon get em up
Represent your side nigga hit em up
Disrespect we gon take it there
We thirty deep lil nigga we ain't fighting fair
You better holla at your partners
Before we catch them outside and hit they ass with them choppers
The .45 make my pants sag
Catch me bouncing through the club with my black flag
You don't like it do something nigga
Where I'm from if we don't like it we do something nigga
And you know we gon ride homes
Stomped a nigga ass out until they turn the lights on

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Me and Jeezy on the back street
Choppers in the back seat
What we finna do the question's you ain't even gotta ask me
Desert in my lap and skullcap and a black tee
Looking for the niggas that say they finna attack me
Turn the music down low and let the 'lac creep
Fuck the police, I give a damn if they catch me
Wait a minute that's that nigga looking at me
Let off fifty shots you niggas ran like a track meet
I know my partners would have did the job for a flat fee
But seeing them niggas bleed is the only thing that's gon relax me
I'm hands on nigga damn what you say
All them games that you play don't stand a chance in the A nigga

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Lil Scrappy]
Roll up on your block
All the bullshit stops
Man ho know that I'm the prince so that ass gon drop
I was born in the A with things in the way
Smoke weed everyday
Zone Three where I stay
Yeah I think I'm the shit cause I got an SS
But the shit a old folk so you can receive the letter
I'm the best of the best
And the freshest of the fresh
Gotta pistol black out wit an Atlanta Hawk vest
Gotta lifetime of trouble and my brain still nervous
I don't rep the A by mistake I do the shit on purpose
Do it how it's worth it rim and the cars swerving
It ain't nothing but Lil Scrappy and g's up to start murking you

[Refrain][Hook: 2X]
If you a thug my nigga be a thug
If you sell drugs my nigga then sell drugs
If you gonna rap about it be trill about it
And dont say shit if you can't BE REAL about it

[Lil Scrappy]
Comin up as a child all I seen was Hell
Momma stepped, Daddy sold yay, stayed in and out of jail
I came robbin and kickin in doors
Then went from a half to sellin ten O's
But ya see shorty, My mom was a G
She made it real easy for my sista and me
She did what she had to do
And go on the damn grind like a nigga would do
Talkin about pimpin, o she did that too
I got robbed because a old nigga took all my loot
And I was just 12 years old goin on 13, which made me bold
That's why I thank my heart is so cold
I gives a fuck about none of you hoes
All you fake thugs think about is grillin wit gold
Replacin yo does (shawty), and cakin these hoes
(shorty) and cakin these hoes
I'mma pimp, I spend my time makin these hoes

[Hook]

[Lil Scrappy]
Nobody loves me so I guess I stay to myself
A nigga thankin 'bout change contemplatin my death
Feel my pain as it rains all over a nigga
And the only way I can get away is weed and liquor
Fuckin niggas up on the daily if they didn't pay me
Niggas pullin guns on me damn near drove me crazy
Young nigga went to school just to sell some dope
A lil crazy ass nigga wit a knife in his coat
And in the streets broke heathens went through drama especially
Momma swung on a nigga, I stabbed a bitch in the head
I don't scratch my head unless it itches
And I don't smoke unless I'm bustin at you hatin bitches
Niggas, we was bred to die, don't be askin me why
I'll rather hustle in the cold cause niggas prayin wit fire
All the childhood issues when the Devil's out to get ya
Got my mind on my gun and I shall pull pistol

[Verse 3: Bohagen]
(Bohagen) You see the streets, they'll swallow you whole
Your mind, body, and soul
And leave you in a ditch, cold, wit no shoes and clothes
Be waitin for the trash collector
Follow me now selector to the ghetto sector
They'll kill you over thirty dollars
I seen a man cut wit a dirty bottle blood squirted on his shirt and collar
I heard him holla a sound that I can't forget
Ran home, watched cartoons and ain't said shit
And to this day, Momma thought I was up at the park
While she was at the church praising the lord
I made it through amazingly unscarred
She had to be praying, because I made it by the graces of God
A product of hard times, I spit hard rhymes
Bible in one, the other hard iron
Dreaming of naming streets and boulevards mine
Grab yo piece of the pie, the other parts mine

[Hook] - 2X[Hook 2X: Gucci Mane] + (Lil Scrappy)
I rob in my black tee
Hit licks in my black tee
All in ya house searchin for bricks in my black tee (Crank it)
I kill in my black tee
I steal in my black tee
I'm real so I gotta keep it trill in my black tee (O-kay-kay-kay)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
You can catch me all in a nigga house wit a black tee
Gucci Mane, lil flair got a million dollar mouthpiece
Black Tee, black rag, even got a black mask
Leavin out ya house, thirty pounds in my book bag
Black 'llac, black back, fin' to hit a lick again
You a head bussa punch yo hand wit yo fist den
Franchise hate me, probly wanna kill me
Remixed it wit Scrappy and now the hood feel me
Fresh on the scene wit the all black shirt
Gucci so gutta he'll steal money out ya purse
I lay up in ya yard, rob ya when ya go to church
Ya love white tees now ya face on the shirt
Black tee, black reed, trappin on the front street
Got a black pistol grip pump on the seat
Black tee, O.G., nigga don't approach me
Bubble gum wrappin ass niggas can't smoke me

[Chrous]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
It's Bun B in his black tee & G in his black tee
Reppin UGK and PAT in his black tee
Pimp in his black tee, mack in his black tee
Free Pimp C on the back of his black tee
Gucci chain swangin on the front of his black tee

Stunt in his black tee, ball in his black tee
It ain't jus me pimpin we all got a black tee

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
And I got a 1-2 Bun

Got my four-x black tee up under my jersey

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]

Gorillas wit banana clips goin monkey in the back
They'll put yo ass in that black box, laid out flat

[Verse 5: Jody Breeze]
Look I slang in my white but I bang in my black tee
Gucci on the front, Jody Breeze on the back street
Chillin by a black Cadillac on sum black feet
Scrappy in a Chevy watchin Scarface on the flat screen
Told y'all constantly, ride wit the pump wit me
Yup in my black tee, wit the nine underneath
I ain't gotta keep tellin y'all niggas I'm a G
I'mma just cock back and leave sum blood on ya teeth

[Hook]

[Verse 6: 4-Tre]
I'm so stainless in my black tee
Remainin in my black tee

Diamond glistenin cross plus the background is a black tee
Thieve then come back sprayin rounds in my black tee
4-Tre, I want war in my black tee
Fuck them, they probly neva wore a black tee
Workin in my black tee, smokin purple in my black tee
I'm lookin for twelve all out yo curtain in my black tee

[Verse 7: Lil Scrappy]
Fuck a white tee, I got my black tee and vest on
Fuck a sturdy shot, I'm goin straight for the bread home

Now I'm smokin nothin but blunts in my black tee
See me in Valve then tried to fight me
Jus the same monkey shawty don't take me lightly

[Hook][2Pac]
Ahhh shit hahaha

When I enter the first zone
Worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up
Evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy
Manifestin' military styles
Casually try da g
When niggas battle me
My prophesied prediction
Switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch
And watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin' still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'
Hell or prison
My ammunition varies
My voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world
Me and the mob gettin' married
It seems all the fine screams pierce the dark
This is expected
A trick bitch where is your heart
You mark
Watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til its none left
Don't sleep

[Hook] (2x)
We gon' ride
Keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine
Always hustlin' on the grind
Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep

[Nutso]
Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random
Rapidly
Wit' accuracy
They shouldn't talk bad to me
It had to be
A motherfuckin' murder
I'm glad to be
A nigga that did the murder
So sad to see
Another motherfucker floatin'
In plastic reef
Sleep wit' his head wide open (head smokin')
Rapid release
Keep the police coastin'
Casualties
Warrant in deep east Oakland (doors wide open)
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt
Drove off to the hills
Positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the lex ruger
Death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullets fly
Kill and execute 'em

[Yaki Kadafi]
I blast first 'til they body me
Like my guns in variety
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front
Doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hand on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine
Movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples
Nigga nothin' simple 'bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin'
Dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out
Ain't no easy way outs or easy exits
Don't sleep

[Hook] (2x)

[Lil' Scrappy]
G's up
A-Town

When I hit the street
All I can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tears when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un- for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose
Then no crew standin' but mine
I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
What eva you do shawty you betta think wisely
You might see me wit' a stack in the trap (Aye)
I use my thoughts and pen
Similar to a saran wrap
A lil' lame nigga I'll neva be
Yeah I'mma keep it g
I'm from the Three and Scrap will neva sleep
Aye

[Hook] (2x)

Don't Sleep

Don't Sleep[Intro/Hook: 8Ball sample]
"E'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up" {*9X*}

[Ludacris]
Okay oh, okay now e'rybody with me drunk as FUCK, break it down and {"roll it up"}
Yeah, e'rybody get they killers wit 'em, rep yo' side and throw it up
Po' it up and it's goin down, light another blunt and it's goin 'round
Puff puff pass, you could toast yo' glass, later we'll +Screw+ and slow it up
If you make it fast I can make it last, and I'm a nigga that's makin cash
Eight figures in the bank and I'll pull yo' rank, what you think wit your hatin ass?
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee - heh, you think you fly I know you not
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee - you tote yo' knife I tote my Glock
Big body Cadillac, women in the back seat, speakers steady pumpin as I pass these losers
Yo' car too small, I can't fit my women in a PT Cruiser
Get your cake up, get your weight up, way up to the top 'til you can't go further
These snitches is after my riches and yes I smell bloody murder
When I cock back better drop that, can't block that lock that, fools better stop that
Otherwise you could pop back, but after dumpin a round you'll be wonderin where the cops at
Where the cops at? Cause I'm drunk as FUCK, tell 'em I'm far from sober
Cause if the po'-po' happen to pull me over - I'mma just tell 'em

[Hook]

[Lil Scrappy]
Ay Luda, you know niggas over here, over here kushed out, iced out nigga
G's Up nigga, it's Scrappy, O-K-K-KAY!

E'rybody with me, bitches lookin tipsy, goons posted up case a hater try to tempt me
Pull out the roach, roll up the dough, money I'mma throw again holla at my folk
All I need is a bitch right now, to blow me away then take me down
I need another fuckin Conjure round, hot wing, Gucci, out to the lounge
You might just see me but I can't dig deep nigga with gold teeth
Nigga then O-D on VSOP, and if not now slowly but surely
Shake 'em like LeBron, shoot 'em like Kobe, if they say chill I just pay the police
In the club chillin with G-S-U-P, but after go down it's in D.T.P
That's a rock, got you pissy and you dizzy, wanna hit me
But not really, please don't mix me, I'm a boss, my dogs bite quickly
If nobody's out here with me I'mma do this shit myself
Smoke and drink off for my health{?} like I don't need nobody else
Scrap's so true to smokin crucial, swishin on swishas with Luda
I'm, in the Playas Circle, this G shit you hoes ain't used ta
I got my own kush pack and got my own liquor
"Ay what you call that?" I call it Cleveland Now nigga!

And the Janes on the street charge mo' than a penny, A!

[Hook 2x]

A town to yo' town yeah this how it go
Smokin dro' fuckin' hoes on the city road
When I stomp that bastard I left him with a bruise
Got Fila on my feet so it had to be a shoe

[Verse 3]
Carry the A on my back like a torture rack

Throwin the peace sign up then upside down

Get crunk all day we don't sleep at night
And if you fight one shawdy then we all gon' fight
Don't nobody get crunk in the club like us

[Brisco]

I think it's plenty of you that really want the shawty dead
But watch what ya said lil shawty, I'm makin' bread
Fuck all y'all born haters wit the hatred blood to match
A long way but plus I run with G's and gats
And shawty matter of fact these trill G's be thugs
We ain't talkin behind yo' back and we ain't scared to bust
I'm by myself, but bein alone makes you strong
I stepped off the porch young, so shawty I been grown

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
ATL off the chain down here
Ya come wit dat yappin and no action, you gon' disappear
You walk in the club, it's tight like brass knuckles
Straight elbowin haters like we jumpin off turnbuckles
Beatin in ya door with dat clip on the tech
Beatin down ya block in that 89' Chevy
Tell that stupid boy we throwin' 'bows and we ready
Screamin' "swang shawty" to dem boys dat can't stand me
Yeah shawty - I'mma ATL slugga
Knockin' off heads on you pussy motherfuckers
Shawty be sayin', "Scrap, you a cool boy!"
But I know in my heart dat I'mma head bussa boy! (Head bussa!)

[Hook][Verse One: T.I.]
Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South
When, they ain't runnin a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin
It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin for a livin
It's, mo' because of what I do and how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
(Niggas feelings) And still chillin on Simpson in Center Hillin'
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

[Verse Two: Lil Scrappy]
I'm the prince shorty don't get it twisted
Been callin shots since before my flows existed
And still find birds in my momma kitchen
You might see me burnin purple in the subdivision
I got soldiers on deck, babyface pimpin
Whatchu' know 'bout dat, I get a bad Brenda
With that vert' top back, my jeans feelin tight
Cause my pockets stay fat, playa better know that
My neck got so much shit, danglin
Big dick, big chain, we just keep on hangin
Got a Hollywood ho, and a broad that be sangin
They be hatin cause I'm famous {?} what I was thankin
And this for every don nigga thankin he passed me
Y'all just thank that you gone and the shit'll be nasty
I'mma stay ballin, ballin off my old school classic
Lil Scrap got big bank, now see if you can match it

[Hook]

[Verse Three: P$C]
Shorty I'm down with the kings, so call me the greatest
Number one hustler, I keep the street blazin
If the grapes don't sell, I dry 'em up and sell raisins
While y'all cherry pickin hustlers out here slavin
That king shit nigga runs deep in my veins
Pump through my heart, live in my bone marrow mayne
That's pimpin! My gas is premium like octane
Cain't tell me nuttin 'bout stackin these Benja-maynes
I'm the king of the Dirty, see me seated in the throne
Overruled other dudes like Caesar did in Rome
With a prince that's so demandin and an aura so strong
The South ain't been represented like this in so long
I'm an emperor, you best be glad I'm workin on my temper
Otherwise I'd cock a pistol, send some missiles to your temple
Disrespect us I'mma blick 'em 'til I get you plain and simple
Brass knuckles to your dentals blast suckers in they dimples

[Hook]

[T.I.] I'm a king[Hook]
Knuck if you buck, boy (x10)

Kn-kn-kn-kn-kn-kn
Knuck if you buck, boy

[Verse 1: Lil' Jay]
Yeah
Well, I'mma gat-toting, pistol-holding nigga on yo damn street
Stomping, jumping, bumping and we crunk off in this damn thing
Throwing them bows up at these hoes
They screaming, they bleeding from they nose
But when we start to swing, we making niggas hit the flo'
Ain't no game off in this thing, we be deep off in yo party
Crime mob niggas getting started, Ellenwood niggas be the hardest
So, if a nigga come and run they mouth just like a ho
Punch 'em dead up in his nose and stomp his ass down to the flo'

[Verse 2: Princess]
Yeah, we knucking and bucking and ready to fight
I betcha I'mma throw them things, so haters best to think twice
See, me, I ain't nothing nice, and Crime Mob, it ain't no stopping
It be like Sadaam Husein, Hitler, and Osama Bin Laden
Now they steady gum popping and I am acting a fool
I wish a hater would get crunk up on this Crime Mob crew
Now enough is enough, boy, rough and get stuffed, boy
Luck is a must, boy, knuck if you buck, boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Scrappy]
Jumping off from on the stage, throwing bows like Johnny Cage
All my niggas starting riots, knocking down the barricade
Ellenwood, we be too deep, and M.O.B. is too elite
Flawless niggas, lawless, you'll be jawless getting close to me
Bullets busting constantly, rapping in yo city streets
Broken bones lay alone, scattered 'cross the concrete
Knucking if you bucking, you'll be ducking if you get too close
In my eyes, you wasn't wise, I think it's time I knuck you, ho

[Verse 4: Diamond]
I come in the club, shaking my dreads
Throwing these bows and busting these heads
Bitch, you irrelevant, step to my residence
Best to back up 'for I send you a lick
I been in drama and commiting a crime
Not leaving a trace, not leaving a line
We knucking and bucking cause I got a nine
I blow you away cause you wasting my time
Stupid ass niggas, I know what to do
I waste yo ass, you fuck with my crew
I'm through with you haters, so watch what you do
You talking 'bout me, then I'm talking to you
You bucking on us and we leave you in plastic
You busting on me and that shit gon' get nasty
I'm colder than ice and I'm freezing out here
I target your city but you cannot tell

[Verse 5: Killa C]
Knuck if you buck, boy, but you betta come equip
I got some shit off in my trunk that's gonna make yo body flip
Hollow tips, busting out the rib soon as I hit the do'
Anybody make a false move, dead bodies on the flo'
Fucking with no hoes, ain't never been no lames
Ain't never been no pussy niggas scared to throw them things, mane
Crime mob niggas up in this bitch, Break Bread Records I represent
Fucking with them HP niggas, you 'bout to get yo wig split

[Hook][Verse 1]
Growin' up on Section 8, momma in the other room cryin'
Cuz she got bills to pay, and it ain't no chores to play
Only thang outside is a sand box and a gate to hate
And the show ain't gon' show money, soul of a show money
Only thang around town, Brooklyn is dat dope money
Dem boys on the corna, and they pockets gittin' stronga
Momma did it fo' the hunger
We sold about a hundred, err'body still runnin'
And we sittin' on the block
Cuz the dope feigns rollin'
Videos, I ain't trynna be no rapper
I ain't trynna be no actor
I'm tryin' to make a stack up
I ain't gotta call practice
So if I'm on the streets, then come greet or tear my back up
The police betta call back up
Cuz if I can't feed my daughter - I'mma come and rob ya (And I was...)

[Hook - 2Pac w/ Lil Scrappy ad-libs]

Rememba when the food stamps used to look like dollas
“I ain’t have no clothes so the ho’s wouldn’t holla
K-mart gear was all ah nigga wore
When I hit 'em lights all the roaches hit the flo' (Damn)
Momma had got in to a accident
It's fucked up, mayn she can't even pay the rent
And the heat and light been out eva since
So you know when a nigga gone, it git cold in the bitch
You know what I'mma do? - I'mma go git rich
Put on my ski mask and go hit me a liq
It's all you could do when you young and from Tha Bricks
I'm from the hood, lil' shawty, I'mma represent (And I was...)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now it was neva eva 'posed to be like this

A young nigga gittin' cash
Gotta keep dat steady flow runnin' while the time pass
Can't let 'em git you down, move in or move out
Gotta git dat money shawty, dat whudd I'm talkin' bout
When time git hard betta pray to God
Don't stretch the dope game on the boulevard
No (No), my daughter neva will
And if I have to kill, she gonna git anutha meal
Shiit, play the hand I was dealed
And if a man stepped to meIgot a right to grab the steal
Chyea, I'm on top and I still rememb-a

[Verse 1: Lil' Scrappy]
Dear lord, this a letter to you
A young nigga hurt and I don't know what to do

Im on this earth, with my blessing and my curse
Just thinking that how we live
The ridin hurts
Even though you know me
Ever since I was birth
I'm innocent till you judge me and that comes first
And I ain't trying to burn lord cause that's the worst
Forgive me for backsliding on the rock for the thirst
I knew it was wrong got to snatching the purse
But it was cold outside I couldn't afford a shirt
Yeah I wanna go to church
But I can't be faithful
I'm always doing shows but you know that I'm grateful
I turn weak for the fruit cause it be tasteful
I dunno how in the world I can ever repay you

[Hook:]

Lord have mercy on me
Heard a nigga say there's a heaven for a g

Heavy metal
Never settle for less but always strive for the best
Most these niggas playing chief will put you straight to the test

Call us some broad to the Georgia Dome
Trying to get with me is like naps through a comb
They call me Don P aka "Corleone"
Up in the club with my Cartiers on
Don't know if I'm high, drunk, or getting my roll on
He on the cell "Can ya hear me?"
Hell nah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: LA]
LA off in this thing, get up on my level, ho!

Got some niggas that be hating busting slugs at my foes
If you thinking you can fuck with a nigga like me
Nah nigga. Get rich
Trillville and BME

Pussy nigga, get big, nigga-ho

Get crunk out your brains when I spit this verse
I'm a blood-sucking vampire, my venom is worse
Head Bustas deal with dangerous thirsts
Shatter your bones in your chest and make your motherfuckin' heart burst
Don't worry now, best of the South on the map
Knock your thoughts out and leave your brains on your lap
Don't touch my Kangol, shorty... what's wrong with you?

You can go and fuck with a ho
A pocket full of dough
But you will never be nothin like me
Yea yea you wanna act hard

[Verse 1 - Lil Scrappy]
Born, Devil riches son the second
My daddy blessed me with a wonderful weapon
Hoes see me and they keep on stepin
So my momma took me to school taught me pimpin lessons
Oh, I kno you ain't tryin ta call your people
Cause I got people that'll sue your ego
Sum of em in the club with a desert eagle
U ain't gone win a fight unless you got it like we do
Equal, naw nigga we ain't equal

But anyways
Ya'll niggas don't kno me, don't kno my name
Jus kno me by my fortune and fame
They want me to b humble shorty but I can't
Don't get all mushy eyed shorty let me explain
There's alot of mothafuckas out there that hate

People out seein what kinda moves ya make

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Lil Scrappy]

I'm from the A-Town, Southeast, Zone 3
If ya touch me then you get your ass beat
Some of ya'll lames ain't got enough on your track sheet
To clap me you gone need a crowd to see me
Look in the mirror I know you wanna be me
Mad cause your girl on my dick like bologna

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Homeboy]
(What my name is?)
H-O-M-E boy
Through a microscope, you niggas can't see me-e boy
If you jump inside my body could'ntbe me-e boy
Bullets bust on sight so freely-e boy
I'm a monster, evil, Chucky me Freddy Krueger
Bitch nigga I will do ya, with 9 millimeter ruger
I'm hell on earth now that's what they told me
Hotter than the flames in hell, so hell could'nt hold me
No man control me
Follow no one, I'm a leader
I'm Homeboy, Bitch I'm off the mothafuckin meter
Right now or tomorrow I'm a see ya when I see ya
Cock back and make me pop the lid off the Pringles
C'mon, once I step outside of my zone
Bullets fly jus like that star wars attack of the clones
Listen up got some shit that'll part your hair round here
We from Georgia, it's the spot
We some bears down here

[Chorus][Verse 1: Lil Scrappy]
Yeah, ah, so we fighting, fucking then we loving
In the AM maybe we'll be nothing
And you say you like that real thugging
But you hate it when them
... cuffin
Confused flow, for real though
Love came through the front
Went out the back door
Emotions are running, depression is coming
Can't
Believe you love me, cause your feelings are funny

[Hook] X 2
I'm so tired of going up and down, round and round
I'm so over it, I'm breaking down
I'm bout to call it quits, I done had enough of it
My heart is so cold, I can't find no love here

[Verse 2: Lil Scrappy]
My heart on broken, confidence stolen
Mind going crazy, should I stay or keep going
She don't love me, well I gotta embrace it
If I don't love her, baby girl you gotta face it
The thang about love you can't find it you neither trace it
If love was a test, you either fail or you ace it
Love me, for who I am
If not, shit I don't give a damn
You want the cars, house and designer things
I get it baby girl, you want the finer things
And I ain't hatin on you, go and get it now
Matter fact, go and get it Now, matter fact make daddy proud
Erythang change when you say the L word
Cause I can't say it back I don't know what to tell her
I can't find no love here
You say what is love, it's a powerful word
And it's more than great, man that shit can hurt

[Verse 3: Tocarra]
Got a lot of hard feelings, wall up
Barred up, caught up, start up
Don't wanna fall cause
I can't let another one in

[Hook] X 2
I'm so tired of going up and down, round and round
I'm so over it, I'm breaking down
I'm bout to call it quits, I done had enough of it
My heart is so cold, I can't find no love here

[Verse 4: Lil Scrappy]
Live on the web, we're shooting up the celebs
And I'm goin through hell, wanna release a couple shells
You wanna upgrade baby and that's a fact
But you don't get a nigga just like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
You leave a real nigga shawty I bet you come right back
And you say that I cheated in the past, that's true
And in the future I did erythang you asked me Boo
Yeah I cheated and you cheated
But in the end, it's in the wind baby where we meet
It's not the end, we pretend ...
And make this our little secret
Emotional roller coaster, the pain is almost over
The monkey is off my shoulder

[Tocarra]
I can't find no love here

[Hook] X 2
I'm so tired of going up and down, round and round
I'm so over it, I'm breaking down
