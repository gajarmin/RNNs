[Verse 1]
This is costless rap
Jews hear my music and run out like holocaust is back
Europeans say this bloke can rap
Canadians say he off the map, how can you argue with that
Well you can if you have your own agenda
And been spoon fed religion from the placenta
Call yourself a christian muslim I know you do
Any religion bet it's the one your parents chose for you
And any admission of your doubts to someone close to you would not be accepted
Because forgiveness goes out the window when its someone different
And I dont know whats worse, that fact that I never believed
Or that I miss that community of church
There's two ways to control a population; hope and fear
Prove the existence of a soul and we'll go from there
Otherwise shut your mouth when you open it up to mention me G^2
Yeah

[Hook]

Every human culture, has a set of creation myths

Every human culture, has a set of creation myths
(Greydon)
Voodoo deist Confucian Amish

Scientologist Zoroastrianist astrologist

Verse 2
Spoon fed this religion from the slave ship
They used faith to justify bringing slaves here
All the conducts and the rules in the good book
You swear by it, but failed to take a good look
Your completely sold
Just two centuries ago slave owners swore you didn't even have a soul
Now you blindly defend a faith
That was used plunder pillage and rape a whole entire race
DL Hugely's never met a black atheist
I'll never know a faith based on a factual basis
So we're even, from christian to islamic law
And now they speakin' up from Compton to Islamabad
They dont directly respond, they put it on their blog
Straw man attacks against me like I'm some kind of star
Huh, you pokin' at the hornets nest
I'll lyrically destroy your faith just to warn the rest

Chorus

Verse 3
All this over poor explanations of nature
I'm Denzel in Glory, for shoes i'll make it a caper
I have the scars of a slave in my DNA
So forgive me if I dont preach the faith like TD Jakes
See, I could never go to bed with said fiction
Because genetic memory stores the trama of shed whippin's
Next victim, any faith thats ever suppress women
And skewed science and education for its best interests

...for those who died for daring to question the system

And all lives and power that they've abused since then

The stories were myth from the instant of its invention

That's where their power comes from, your belief in their fiction

From native american to native african
...from the evangelicals to the pacifistYour holy books inspire hate despair and drama
If your god does love you I hope you make him wear a condom
People think with prayer they're safe in the streets
Fredrick Douglass didn't become free until he prayed with his feet
You can tell that hell and god are man made
They both want unquestioned authority and demand slaves
And any incarnation of slavery's not good
So from here we can deduce Stockholm Syndrome is not hood
But it gets deeper than this
Especially when people get pissed
When you point out their deity's nature and even intent
But I'll never worship anything with evil in it
Especially something who allowed evil to even exist
I don't give a shit if he created me
That don't give him the right to commit genocide with pride and act crazily
His abused and neglected claim this crooked biz
If this was Cali DCFS would have came and took his kids
Belief is so important that if you don't you go to hell
Without the type of proof you'd need in court to avoid a jail
Give me the gas can and send me I don't need the drawers (underwear)
All because I can't fathom how your god doesn't need a cause

(Chorus)
I don't know about you but this looks like imprisonment
Whats worse is that the prisoners don't know that they're prisoners
Even defend the tactics that are used to imprison them
You're a conquered mind sent to conquer other minds selling: "Come and hear our truth"
I dont know about you but this looks like imprisonment
Whats worse is that the prisoners don't know that they're prisoners
Even defend the tactics that are used to imprison them
Another conquered mind trying to conquer other minds pleading: "Come and hear our truth"

Religious freedom is an oxymoron
None of them books scare me, not the Bible not the Qur'an
This is to Islam, and its fundamentalism:
The day you release your women, I'll quit releasing venom
Until then, no amount of scientific contributions
Could ever excuse your hateful chauvinistic institution
But, here's the real reason I'm not a Muslim
Children. See your anointed prophet used to fuck em
Listen, Mohammed was taking children as wives
One he married at six and consummated at nine
He was somewhere in his 50's trying to get in them drawers
She wasn't even 10 yet, still playing with dolls
So they try to give me that, "oh the times were different"
Rationalizing atrocities now you sound like Christians
I charge the views on women as sickening
Either update the culture or just fade into history
But either way...

(Chorus x2)
This looks like imprisonment
Whats worse is that the prisoners don't know that they're prisoners
Even defend the tactics that are used to imprison them
You're a conquered mind sent to conquer other minds selling: "Come and hear our truth"
I don't know about you but this looks like imprisonment
Whats worse is that the prisoners don't know that their prisoners
Even defend the tactics that are used to imprison them
Another conquered mind trying to conquer other minds pleading: "Come and hear our truth"

 [Verse 1]
I’m the creepy guy in the trench coat following you
The homeless guy on the side of the freeway bothering you
I tried to signal, but you didn't pay me no mind
Now i call like a bill collector til you pay me on time
…. I've got the skill to describe your morphogenetic field
And yet and still go back to the math for a better thrill
We took all of our collective forces and unified it
You read the bible, and that isn't even pseudoscience
You think i’m afraid of Islam like i’m shook nervous
I’ll torch a quran with my lyrics fuck a book burning
These blacks accept the religion of the slave master...
But they wouldn't accept it if you were a gay rapper
Why is it when we want to move forward we face backwards
Our community’s sick, religion the main factor
You have such a problem with gays and transsexuals
What if I told you that we are a trans-intellectuals
You’d probably flip, deny that you’re a member
Call for those who think like me, to be dismembered
….something you picked up from a former era
Spreading religious love in the form of terror
Pipe down
Pick up a book right now
Of an opposing view you might find out
...everything ain't you what you thought it was
There are no others everyone’s apart of us

[Hook]
There’s just an illusion of something different
The very reason they keep telling you something’s missing
But whatever it IS you won’t get from one religion
I hate to break it to you, get your coat summer’s ending...

There’s just an illusion of something different
The very reason they keep telling you something’s missing
But whatever it IS you won’t get from one decision
I hate to break it to you, get your coat summer’s ending...

[Verse 2]
There’s only so many legal moves
When you've seen the rules
You wonder how they have so many people fooled
I never thought when I was young in class
That I would be scribbling in chalk on the walls of the underpass
Some might ask, how’d did happen how’d you get there?
Most people think that i’m yapping when I sit there
And just stare
At traffic rapping just to get their
Half a second of attention span as they spend years
Rentable, to the highest bidder in a bidding war
Disappear from 9-5 then act like I’m invisible
Pitiful, wanna be pimps players and centerfolds
In it for the cash and status and yet their miserable
...i’m not homeless i’m just off the grid
Be happy if i was on it i’d be off’n kids
I think the problem is, “we” ain't being honest
I’d rather live like shit then to pay for shadow conflicts
We ain't broke it’s the system that is broken
This->is a modern day plantation and you know it
Manufactured patriotism
Makes asking questions about secretive initiatives
Just as dangerous as seals on a secretive mission
Secret prisons people still in
Even paranoid transients see the villains
Sure I hear voices, telling me inhale the weed and always peer forward
Wandering this scorched earth
....just looking to score something to eat
Get out of the rain, a blanket and somewhere to sleep
...wondering if this alley and box is going to pan out
All you see is another grown man with his hand out
...nothing to my name except for some books
While the cops watch everybody except for the crooks
...and the people left on the hook, be like “ho-hum”
Plus they get to pay for it too. This is so dumb
A balancing act with peace as the fulcrum
But what would I actually know? I’m just some smelly old bum
Digging through old crates feeding on bread crumbs
Just another mother’s broken son who’s head’s gone
........fumbling a basket mumbling some racket
Under that bridge, where a normal man becomes a savage
One man’s peace is another’s madness
You keep the illusion, i’ll just settle for a jacketIt really boils down to who loves the craft
If its cold in the real world, then passion is my jacket
I want to conjure silly mind breaking rhymes
That you can't express without the error notation sign
That’s what Greydon Square stands for
Something you sacrifice not appealing to the dance floor
They told me that I can’t soar
Yea, like a lion can’t roar
Trying to cope the legendary status I planned for
Chasing legends so I rap crazy
Spitting crap that you would never expect of a mac baby
Another 80’s crack baby claiming rap saved him
The whole package. Half Genius. Half crazy
Rap or hip hop what’s the difference?
They represent the craft with coonery and we’re sick of it
So we’re delivering
More cerebral rhymes
For modern medieval times
Where justice is redefined
And governments feed us lies
Is he your enemy? tell me when see his eyes
I’m on the case i’ll let you know when I reveal the guise
Hip hop’s a building about to blow and i’m still inside
I’m the lump in your throat when you feel it rise
That why your voice belongs to them if isn't yours
There’s more money in the treatments than there is in cures
I only have a short time in this silly world
That why I invest in my rhymes instead of silly girls
Fuck a groupie
She could never understand me
This my movie that’s my name up on the damn screen
I put my heart, mind, body and soul in every project
This isn't Greydon it’s the group home kid Eddie Collins
About to a make promise
And bout to state it honest
Til the end to my fans i’ma pay you homage
And i’ll never exploit my music to make a profit
That’s like Andrew Jackson hanging out with Davie Crockett
That’s like tea baggers, and progressives socializing
It rarely happens
Like getting boards over Rodman
In the end, I want to be a hall of famer
Who flew under the radar hardcore like Danny Granger
After all my lyrics they’ll rewrite laws of physics
While accumulated haters claim its all a gimmick
In 99 I received an email from myself
Saying you can’t do this alone you gonna need some help
But music comes first second everybody else
Do it for the passion never do it for the wealth
And it was signed by a dude named Greydon Square
I was still Apocalypse consumed by anger and fear
So I didn't care
I just kept gang bangin’
Doing the same thing nothing in life changing
Compassion of the shelf
Blaming everyone else
Knock you out at the drop of a hat I needed help
I think I was in a search of self but in denial
The military the same shit a different pile
That’s a missionary relationship you on the bottom
While the killer instinct that they turn on they don’t turn off
You really want a ticking time bomb working your office
The socially awkward battle tested poetry author
What’s funny as a legend I don’t even want the title
I bet as chattel slaves we didn't even want the bible
The best part of my career was performing with my idol
At a live show, no moment could ever be it’s rival
Peruse my lyrics then speak them into the universe
Before a black man remember that I was human first
A newer verse
For you to do with to sooth your nerves
While it’s the perfect companion music
When you use the herb
Here’s the part we credit Carl Sagan
While master mathematicians listen to my music while they solve equations
...back at first they said I lacked the purpose
Now they call me a legend, I feel like I haven’t earned it
…this is the power, the recognition that this is ours
Give me an hour, I’m changing the way you think about it

Can't be paranoid if everyone’s out to get me
If I got to be a legend i’m taking you guys with me
This is the next installment in my cosmos series
...symphony of science I got Boswell with me
You can find me hanging out where ever truth is lurking
In a universe made up of many universes
...Lucifer? Ignorance is the truer serpent
Hell you just fell for a newer version

[Hook x2]
When you started rapping you didn't want to be great
You wanted cats walkin across town for cheesecake
Me I’d rather rock for pete’s sake
The spot for DJs
A live crowd or the freeway
This is hip hop. The art that oversees change
This is what we came to regain
True ascension for some they thought never could
Probably cause they’ll gave it all up to chase legendhoodEvery 311 trillion 40 billion years
I manifest, un-manifest, then reappear
This time around I'm 15 billion years old
From a place in the multiverse where reference points are zero
The only gods in this bitch are us
We are the species in the labs creating shit from dust
I can build a whole universe in C++
Delete the source code, in a repetitive series of cycles
You believe in virgin birth
Why can't you believe that I hack into the internet of a another universe's Earth?
Spit with reckless abandon
Describe my span the distance sandwiched between stars and exo-planets
Be prepared when you step into duel
Is life the rule of thumb or the exception to the rule?
Seems like an awful waste of space if it just us
We still believe pages from when they wre just making this shit up
And so we're clear that your thoughts are private class functions
In case the programming analogies haven't sunk in
I'll take you as far back as you can take it
Back when the space we currently occupy was ancient
Everything you ever knew of only happened on this one planet
Found out you evolved and jumped into a panic
For real witness the birth of homo sapiens offspring
Cyborgs destined to roam the stars like star scream
If God can be self-caused, so can the universe
Ya'll can't think anything yourself, you need a ruler first
My lyrics behave like particles and waves
Every field theory united on one page
Dogmatic faith is dying or dead already
The last remaining are telling us to get our weapons ready
Because I doubt they are going down without a fight
Them in the future is us in the dark without a light
You don't want me to tell you what battle's like
Life and death data relayed over globally positioned satellites
You don't know when it's going down so you travel light
It's easy to send troops if you believe in afterlife
If I have to erupt, you'll see the flash at night
Half the time I have half the mind to try to stab the mic
Human beings open sourced running updates
You might be living a simulation, define the substrate
You might as well adopt extropian principles
I always asked why until I was sent to the principal's
The likelihood of what they're trying to sell is miniscule
It's minimal, I just try to inform you in general
The counter arguments I hear are just pitiful
They just give us something else to reticule
Lyrically I'm sinning too
Yeah that's what they say
Name any other emcees whose lyrics they debate
Turn it up, what the neighbors gonna say?
Before you listen to Grey, tuck your faith safe away in a safe
Because I'm coming for it
You gave your allegiance in exchange and got nothing for it
That's why it's so abhorrent
At first they knew they had to break the African women
She in-turn would break the African younglings
The result, we had to latch on to something
Keep the body, take the mind
Like soldiers training breaking slaves in ancient times
Let's take a journey up the Kardashev scale
United type 2 resources building Dyson spheres
And I won't live to see it but it's nice to hear
Everybody who would have had the right to be there
That's why you frightened and scared
Your obsolete beliefs will die with you
And your grandchildren will simply outgrow the God issue
No longer taboo to touch religion
The only thing we need left is an uprising in Muslim women[Verse One]
Lyrically, they say what I do is a fad
You can’t keep spitting truth ‘cuz these fools will get mad
They don’t want you to get deep, they happy with bling
Wallow in ignorance as long as they stacking the green
Think I’m overstating my case? This is a fact
There’s a very strong line between niggas and blacks
See, niggas are followers, blacks normally lead
Niggas call blacks white washed soon as they on the scene
And the things about niggas, you can’t tell ‘em nothin’
Cuz they know every goddamn thing about something
See niggas hear blacks talk and say that they talk white
More ignorant than Michael Vick setting up dog fights
Saggin to they ankles, don’t care if they walk right
Would rather smoke and drink than see if they kids are alright
See niggas are attracted to niggas
Blacks are attracted to intelligence they don’t care what the skin is
See niggas use they skin as a crutch
As an excuse to be lazy as fuck
Not to get off of they butt
Niggas could care less about truth, they’d rather get their hair done
While blacks value knowledge, even if it scares ‘em

[Hook]
So this goes out to all my blacks and non-niggas
If they acting like a nigga then you call they ass a nigga
This goes out to all my whites and non-niggas
If they acting like a nigga then you call they ass a nigga
This goes out to my Latins and non-niggas
If they acting like a nigga, you call they ass a nigga
This goes out to my Asians and non-niggas
If they acting like a nigga, you call they ass a nigga

[Verse Two]
See niggas believe in god, black people don’t
Niggas ignore evidence that black people won’t
Niggas believe in god, black people don’t
Niggas ignore evidence that black people won’t
I had to say it twice so there wan’t no mistaken it
This too important to us not to put the race in it
Niggas have kids, don’t take care of ‘em
Niggas talk shit about black people because they scared of ‘em
Niggas get mad ‘cuz non-niggas use the word nigga
As soon as they get finished using the word nigga
And I don’t ever wanna hear that we have a right to say and they don’t
That we should respect this connotation, ‘cuz they won’t
These are the facts, we should respect that
The very reason we black
Has nothing to do with that
And which demand are we at?
It’s just a skin color stupid we need to move past

[Verse Three]
See blacks bite the bullet now and plan for the future
Niggas will smile now and cry later being stupid
Black will respect us, wonder why it’s taking so long
Niggas will call me an Uncle Tom for making this song
Blacks strive for better, a better life and better living
Niggas spend they whole lives trying to be better niggas
A nigga calls himself a real nigga, everyday
A black stays humble and learns from his mistakes
A nigga is never wrong and expects every break
A black knows that life ain’t free, do what it takes
A nigga think the world owes him
Just because he’s a nigga and it ain’t real until the world shows him
A black knows the world owes nothing, he knows the score
He knows he knows less and less about more and more
A nigga hates Common and think Will Smith is wack
And think club rap has the hottest lyrics on the map
A black respects people like Mos and Jill Scott
And won’t put themselves in a position to deal rock
A nigga blames white people for slavery
A black knows that it was Africans who sold blacks into slavery
But when it’s all said and done a nigga won’t even care
He’ll just say that’s just who he is and that it’s just a part of him
Cuz he’s a nigga
And he’s fine being a nigga
So when he dies don’t trip, it’s just one less nigga

[Hook]"Somewhere in the #GUniverse"

[Verse 1]
Wanted! Schrödinger’s cat. Dead or alive
Proclaims the cosmic guardian that’s embedded in time
I’ve been perusing information since the planck epoch
And 13 billion years later I remain epic
You probably fly on complex planes if you feelin’ me
My rhyme sequences escape me and race to infinity
Lyrically, what I spit is self similar
Energy, within every rhyme and next syllable
You know he’s the next mr x so lets kill a bowl
Don’t spit if you can’t generate, a fresh millivolt
Every rhyme that I kick displays a fractal
Revealing hidden landscapes at different scaling patterns
Star view? no it’s a galaxy rise
But appears as a bottomless pit with a maddening dive
To us a black hole’s just a gravity slide
We went about our lives as the last reality died
But you weren’t here yet
You weren’t even a fluctuation of quantum weirdness
While we were perfecting art, song and lyrics
Our earliest artilects surpass the abilities of your gods best
You don’t even have a math for the silliness of the objects

[Verse 2]
There’s hints of our existence on your moon
A compendium, but you can only reach it when you’re on the shrooms
You type 1’s just defeated your flesh
Thinkin you fresh while we keep planet eaters as pets
....early on, you almost killed your selves
The craft you built, might as well be equipped with sails
Compared to us you’re just snails, a jest to the scale
...we get to meet every alternate version of ourselves
Travel the Pleiadian cosmic ruins
While snackin’ on extra dimensions nobody uses
For amusement
In 3 dimensional time where we jump forward freeze moments even rewind
You speak of divine while we just see a primitive mind
Trying to explain what it can’t in limited rhymes
We are the reflection of life in the night view
A galaxy rise, this is what awaits you at type II1, 2, 1, 2

[Hook]
You To Wong Foo
Me spit quark gluon soup
And of course still do Kung Fu
While you find a fool to run to
I grab the mic and 1,2,1,2

...You see some rule
To me a new roof to punch through
If it’s war, then you use sun tzu
Oh a mic? yea I use one too
It’s all about the 1, 2, 1, 2

[Verse 1]
No labels, no gods, no fables
If I ain't able to spit just put me in my grave hole
...I’m a free man
That’s why they call me a heathen
The reason? cause I like analytical thinking
This Mongolian beef with little seasoning
Get a piece then sit down and sink your teeth in
I’ll be the first to admit, that i’m not perfect
But if i spent my life making music it’ll be worth it
...and I don’t need a girl at all
Fuck pussy, I’d rather give the world a song
Label’s get the middle finger just as quick
I’m independent, let em try to touch my shit
If it was dope now it’s a crack habit
That’s why I’m back it like everybody thinks I’m bad at it
Until this shit ends I’ll spit with vengeance
...shit on dope beats like old people do to Depends
You fawn over porches Armani and leather
While the strong nuclear force holds my rhyme scheme together
I’m sick with the flow like I live on a boat
You should track that pitiful rhyme behind a temporal cloak
...this kind of hip hop has a different approach
Instead of women and gold
It’s a victory pose
A statement against shit we oppose
If this was poker you couldn't bluff hard enough to get me to fold

[Hook]
...You seem confused
Just leave us to make tunes
Before we break you and ya lame crew
Give an inch and these chumps take two
That’s why we bust the 1, 2, 1, 2

Trust that we’ll meet up soon
You know ain't dope you snuck through
If it’s fuck us, then it’s fuck you
We tell to em to spit but then none do
They couldn't touch our 1, 2, 1, 2

[Verse 2]
Face the truth we’re just apes with nukes
A raging debate over faith ensues
Wait til they break the truce
While thinking you safe, watch em bring the drama straight to you
It’s too late with no time to react at all
Catch you sipping on a 40 watching basketball
This won't last at all
I just want to bring intellect to a jamming song
While they laugh at ya’ll
I teach checker players how to play chess
Teach a chess player Go while I’m blazing the sess
Now follow
You know it’s 2012 when your neighbors
See a black president and 5 white Lakers, at staples
Just leave me to my major
Keep everything else including your Christ savior
I’m still the type to fight for thy neighbor though
Cut through everything that I face like light sabers yo
...This is the old republic
...you better warn the public
Especially rappers with a swollen budget
Producers known to love it, when i kick the physics
...what you thought my whole career was about dissing Christians?
Ha you fell for the gambit
I drop hot shit like rocks that fell to the planet
...So don’t get popped dropped and shelled by the cannon
Where you standing, if you can’t spit then put ya man in

[Hook]
They fuss cause I threw up truth
Just, wait until GU comes through
With a new blunt for me to puff through
DMT or even mushrooms
I’m a crush the 1, 2, 1, 2

Rebuffed yet I get love too
Mix the old school with something new
Some don’t want it here yet some do
As far as me i don’t know about you
Forever rep the 1, 2, 1, 2

...You To Wong Foo
Me spit quark gluon soup
And of course still do Kung Fu
While you find a fool to run to
I grab the mic and 1,2,1,2

...You see some rule
To me a new roof to punch through
If it’s war, then you use sun tzu
Oh a mic? yea I use one too
It’s all about the 1, 2, 1, 2

Trust that we’ll meet up soon
You know ain't dope you snuck through
If it’s fuck us, then it’s fuck you
We tell to em to spit but then none do
They couldn't touch our 1, 2, 1, 2I'll son you like I just busted a nut in your mom
Battle me? you have a better chance fucking a gong

You little chicken ass nigga, you belong on the farm
On a plate, with your tail smothered in barbecue sauce

Grand Unified it’s our war!
I carry a heavy artillery rifle that's longer than Andre the giant’s arm

Make you nervous like you in Watts leaving your car alone
I have you running from the game like you was Karl Malone

I've been to war your dog tags ain't even real
All I have to do was pierce your heart and watch the kool-aid spill

Take a C plus class get with the program
Ill embarrass you like you showed up to school with no pants

As a grown man with shit stains in your boxers
I'll chop you up faster than propellers from helicopters

You ain't ready for war, why you looking to start one?
I beat you worse than Shredder did them turtles in part one

I'm part sun part moon and all-star
Like the 93 million miles-tall with one ass cheek raw and Chuck Taylor’s
Yeah, you can go and sell your soul for a buck if you ain't gettin' enough paper

Shit! We can battle for 10.000 a pop
But the only time you MC is when your mouthing a cock

Don't even expect me to believe your ridiculous lies
You couldn't see me if you was god with ubiquitous eyes

I'm sick with the rhymes there's not even a cure for what I have
No Prescription or medicated injections for my ass

I'm sicker than a chick that carries a 5-foot-dick
On her period I'm that serious about this shit

Any given moment I can focus and build enough power
To launch myself in space at light-speed and sustain it for hours

Aiming at you cowards Who, just afraid to be yourself
With my sub-atomic disruptors from the Denoris belt

What do you know about spittin'? Nigga, I'm deep with this shit
I'll keep ripping 'till linear time as we know it ceases to exist
I'm a melody addict music was integrated into my deoxyribonucleic acid

If you can't hack it do me a favor and step the fuck off
Or I grab a semi-automatic and let the fuck off

A 100 bars you want a 100 bars you get
I'm a warrior I'll end up going in town with this shit

You couldn't get down on me if I stuffed you under the dirt
In a casket within the soil of my own turf

You softer than a nerf how'd you expect to destroy me
I'm King Kong, all your weapons gonna do is annoy me

You bore me like a rerun that I've seen 50 times
And hearing the lame rappers spitting the same 50 rhymes
With 50 lines regarding your fucking nickels and dimes
Who can't even write a quarter of a half decent rhyme

But 12 and a half percent of the time, they know the truth
If it wasn't for your label nobody would even notice you

I know about things that are just so massive
That if you saw'em you you would probably have a heart attack after

Like existential savagery the compton effect
Grand unified theories and the great wall of galaxies

As far as ripping motherfucker, you's a newbie
I take you about as serious as a PG-13 horror movie

I'm raw like sushi
You could have the combined powers of superman and hulk and still couldn't move me
Like I need arms to reach at you
Shit I don't even need to be a ground type pokemon to take a pikachu

And not to mention my indomitable vision
To blow your molecular structure across the 12th dimension

I'm just sickening You don't wanna rumble with me
I'll put the gloves on You just want to fumble the beat

If you was mercury within the thermometer in a 100 degrees
You still couldn't come up with heat

I generate the fire while you still tryin' to be gangsta
Gangsta? You're about as gangsta as Lizzie McGuire

A sissy for hire take it up in the rectum ass nigga
Nasty like a gonorrhea infected ass nigga
You's a wimpy ass nigga
I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger a day ass nigga

Fucking smurf I chase you off the block like I was Gargamel
You need to throw that bullshit that you writing in garbage pail

Slaughtering me is fucking hard as hell
Cuz when you think you got me on the ropes and beat man, it's hard to tell

If you ain't feeling this then you can get your money back
But I promise you I spit lyrics sweater than Honey Smacks

Cuz when I kill you there ain't no coming back
That's why whenever you see me you should start running like running back

Or running track like a bitch with the weave
You could have HIV and still wouldn't be sicker than me

I got more balls than a jailer can rack
I'm probably the only backpack you know with actual bars in his bag

But you're hardest nigga rapping? that's why I'm laughing
Yeah, about as hard as a wet paper napkin
I can probably spit some icicles and toast that nigga

Even my girl told me "baby roast that nigga"
I got more accuracy than a navy sniper

My beats and rhymes are funkier than some chunky milk and baby diapers
So pay the piper before I get inside ya
I'll have you screaming in so much pain you're hollering out for your messiah

Syllable spitting I'll have your mental ascended into the highest position to conquer the opposition
Whether it's freestyle or written or battling in the trenches
Making your last stand repelling Iraqi dissidents

I've been there, done that
You live in a lie
Buying guns and don't even know what ammunition to buy

But you're willing to die trying
I'll have you so twisted you'll be hearing the lights and seeing the damn sirens

I get around like a tire, spit high like a geyser
My music spin and runs the motherfucking web like a spider
You could smoke weed in a space-shuttle, couldn't get higher
I maintain a higher orbit in my civilian attire

I'll take it back, stone knives and bear skin
So well trained I could kill you with a hair pin

My music's a trap I set it where the scared live
But it's only a trap cause you can't tell where the snare is

I've been asked to ghost-write for ghost-writers
And bring the drama, as Kay Slay) was a soaps writer

You don't want it I'm a classic like Bad Dudes
I got more soul than James Brown wearing Shaq’s shoes

Cause if you cross me and I have to go to drama mode
You won't forget it like the motherfucking Contra code

Up up, down down, left - right, left - right, B – A select start
And that ain't even the best part

I'll take your 30 lives and wipe my ass with'em
And leave you crew sweating more than extremely fat women

I ain't trying to stack millions
I'm trying to spit some incredibly dope and outrageously fat lyrics

For all whose timing Look: I'm still rhyming [look at your clocks]
5 minutes and 30 seconds with good timing
You wonder how I even get deep without diving
20.000 leagues under sea without dying
20.000 degrees in the heat without frying

Without shining, I can still blind you I'm that vibrant
A rap tyrant and I ain't even that violent
But I am enough to stab you up in your face with a trident

My persistent attack is relentless
I give you a shot in your mouth like a dental assistance

If you diss this one-of-a-kind lyrical misfit
I'm titanium made, while you as brittle as bisquick

You wanna battle then prepare to be wasted
But I'll drop you faster than a drill sergeant in basic
So think twice before you try to come face this
Cause I'll destroy you and leave the game faster than Ma$e did

I spit shit with no intention to stop
I spit from now on until my album is dropped
I spit for Easy, big pun, Biggy and Pac
East to left coast Brooklyn, Compton to Watts

It would take you to blow off my fucking noggin to stop
And even without my head I'd continue to rock
And even without a demo to shop...
I'll still lace you from the bottom, middle to top

Don't tempt me, I fucking mean it, I'm simply
The lyrical version of Leonardo DaVinci

There's no reason they should call you an MC
Even under hypnosis you couldn't convince me

On top of that I'll grind your crew up to mince meat
Cause the idea of them picking up the mic offends me

Cause they don't do because they wanna be MC
They do this shit because they think that it's trendy

But not me
I'm gonna climb the mountain
Stop along the way and battle the local townsmen
Tell'em they remind me of Theo, Simon and Alvin
And even kill a mountain lion if he tries to ponce in

A hundred bars? I could have went for a 1000
And even kicked them straight underwater without drowning

And if you thought 159 was astounding
I actually kicked 160 but who's counting?[Verse 1]
Forget about the interviews and the many views
Forget about the industry and the silly feuds
Im deep inside the peoples mind trying to seek and find
The only thing that really matters, what you leave behind
....don’t look to the charts, the media to measure me
You shoot for the single, i’m playing for my legacy
Fuck an award, if it ain't for changing the world then I don’t want it no more
I’ll burn a bridge just to open a door
Scratch an itch just to open a sore
Let’s pack a swisher, just flow and record
We no longer ignored
So before you ask, it’s all for the music
...the result of my past, the cause of my future
It will no longer last as long as our hubris
The movement, should be knowledge, and how we pursue it
Until then, we’re lucky to tread water
With broken sons, and emotionally dead daughters
Keep the daddies, they’re looking for rare fathers
The only ones still, left strong enough to dare bother
Outside looking for someway in
Bringing with me a generation of unraised kids
...and you have a harder time thinking that they exist
But don’t have problem with believing a creation myth
...don’t plead to me, you should take the fifth
Cause you won’t know just what your spending, until you pay for it

[Hook]
Let’s get together minds like we did before
In this endeavor, time is what’s getting short
It’s now or never, let rhyme help us steer the course
Let’s give a future that our grandchildren will endorse

The only matter the line, when you know the score
What makes you think a closed mind could help you open doors
Every album I create I want to show the world
It’s hard to sell em on a first when you’re on the fourth

[Verse 2]
This is an example of translational motion
More flow than a basin, river, lake or ocean
Type II should be an ancient notion
But it’s not, we scratching at .8 just hoping
The world doesn't go pop like corn kernels
How many more entries you got in your journal?
...You’re distracted by the sex appeal
Me? The infinitesimal rotation of vector fields
The seventh seal isn't heaven revealed
It’s you testing it everybody ready to build
A new reference
Sever the old and new testaments
That just got the best of the fools who accepted it
The lesson is
No one has a monopoly on the truth
Not a church a god a party not even you
....we need you to paint the canvas
And help us plug the holes of our own understanding

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This isn't the end it’s just an event like the beginning
Anybody claiming they get it is just pretending
I’ll tell you this, if creativity is infinite
The truth is the allowance allotted and how you spend it
And not about how you meant it
I’m not going through all of this shit and not leaving an imprint
...to quit this in a fit is senseless
I meant it when I said no spit then wrists slit
But you still tried to recruit me in your shady cult
I refused, now i’m the leader of the slave revolt
...dispatch your legions to quash the rebellion
The punishment that we face, our arms and legs nailed in
...talking secretly of peace
Watching great speakers often thinking it was me
Don’t speak of defeat, it sabotages victory
Go and learn what you need, to satisfy the mystery

[Hook]Here we go
Look
You can roll the with crowd, I'm a call societies bluff
Hip hop is a political volcano trying to erupt
When you search my music on Google, actual science comes up
These rappers get on the mic and just start lying and stuff
The industry is like the NBA's executives man
Its hard to get a fair shot with Donaghy reffing the game
But it's cool
I'm a kick back, and kick it in school
While the rest of these cats turn on radio listen to fools
You can dig pretty deep, if your given the tools
Just don't be all that surprised when your given the news
All I really said was that your god didn't exist
And you got pissed enough to get out there and make you a diss
People get sensitive about shit that they know is ridiculous
Like religion, astrology and political differences
Spy-ware on your computers that phone homebase
With information from your emails to your hard drive space
They know exactly what it takes just to get at you
Blood being spilled over diamonds and PS2's
They don't care they throw their Golems in with the Pikachu's
You gotta be some type of idiot to believe the news
Heavily trained soldiers with no war
No soil to defend no turf or home base
People still dying over beliefs and folklore
With closed doors that really only lead to no place
200 Miles to the gallon we got it
But major corporations bought up the licences and shelved the product
Lately the FBI has been in you basement
These are the symptoms of a type zero civilization
I'll do a song featuring the elusive Higgs Boson
Inside the Large Hardon Collider in case something goes wrong
Just give a call anywhere in the world I'll be there tomorrow
Weather your trying to smoke or you need me to brawl
Just don't think your going to do something like I'm new to the pavement
I put in work and smoke that Buddha like a rude boy Jamaican
I keep on telling you, letting you know how ruthless this game is
But you keep on insisting on being so stupid and famous
Rappers bragging loud how they smack hoes
But break down to tears when you tell them there's no heaven
Scientists out in the desert creating black holes
But on The Kardashev Scale their only a .7
Aliens would be stupid to visit us
Cause all we do is bicker fuss and fight over little stuff
Earth dying around us, and we to busy to give a fuck
We are the inhabitants of Terra Firma, this is us
Soldiers don't get the credit just Generals
Justice departments are just a corrupt as the criminals
Maybe if we were more direct instead of subliminal
The damages being caused to Hip Hop would be minimal
It's time to take it back
Yea(Verse 1)
I'm like the Atheist spokesman
That why I come under fire and pressure attacks like Rex Grossman
Yea this game is intense
I been sayin' it since agnostic people been playin' the fence
They keep sayin' its the same in a sense
That evolution requires faith, that universe just came to exist
First of all, microevolution been proven
In the same way that sound waves let you listen to music
And macroevolution is the system of change
At or above the level of the species inflicted with change
That's microevolution on a grand scale we can't even word
Because our life span's too short to observe
"But carbon dating is flawed!
Its half life is 5730 years, and that supports our cause"
Now that'd be great if we used it to date
But since we don't then I'm gonna question that argument's weight
We use potassium argon to date to date the globe
Not carbon 12 or carbon 14 not none of those
So before you attack Grey go get ya facts straight
Because in the facts race, your god comes into last place

(Chorus)
Belief in gods, we can fix that
Irrational thoughts, we can dispatch
It may be hard but we'll get back
In the position just to end that

(Verse 2)
To battle me you need to reason clearly
Now I'm not sayin' fear me
But at least be versed in punctuated equilibrium theory
Grand unified fields, quantum mechanics and dark planets
With logic that's sharper than a blade of d'Artagnan's
To destroy arguments of creationists who can't stand it
Then they try and hit me with the wager
Who? Pascal's wager. Who? Pascal's wager
Now that's a fool's bet
And against the intelligent it's used less
Really? You bet
This ain't nothing new, they use it on kids
But for those who don't know it goes a little like this
"Wouldn't you rather believe in god and be wrong
Than to not believe in god and be wrong
If you believe in god and your wrong you've lost nothing
But if you don't believe and you're wrong it's all suffering"
The problem is you can try it on anything
Switch the gods around and apply it to anything
The Flyin Spaghetti Monster, Zeus, Amun, Ra
Krishna, Odin, Baal and Allah
Which one of 'ems our God?
None of 'em, all false
And blame it on the atheists, its always our fault
Except it never is
So don't get mad at us we just showin' ya'll the evidence

(Chorus)
Belief in gods, we can fix that
Irrational thoughts, we can dispatch
It may be hard but we'll get back
In the position just to end that

Grand Unified Theory
Rational Response Squad
I'm gonna make the fundies hate me
They gon' need a new reason to shut down rap
But they won't shut down rap that degrades women though, huh
They won't shut down rap that talks about sellin crack though, huh
Hypocrites...
It's all good...It really boils down to who loves the craft
If its cold in the real world, then passion is my jacket
I want to conjure silly mind breaking rhymes
That you can't express without the error notation sign
That’s what Greydon Square stands for
Something you sacrifice not appealing to the dance floor
They told me that I can’t soar
Yea, like a lion can’t roar
Trying to cope the legendary status I planned for
Chasing legends so I rap crazy
Spitting crap that you would never expect of a mac baby
Another 80’s crack baby claiming rap saved him
The whole package. Half Genius. Half crazy
Rap or hip hop what’s the difference?
They represent the craft with coonery and we’re sick of it
So we’re delivering
More cerebral rhymes
For modern medieval times
Where justice is redefined
And governments feed us lies
Is he your enemy? tell me when see his eyes
I’m on the case i’ll let you know when I reveal the guise
Hip hop’s a building about to blow and i’m still inside
I’m the lump in your throat when you feel it rise
That why your voice belongs to them if isn't yours
There’s more money in the treatments than there is in cures
I only have a short time in this silly world
That why I invest in my rhymes instead of silly girls
Fuck a groupie
She could never understand me
This my movie that’s my name up on the damn screen
I put my heart, mind, body and soul in every project
This isn't Greydon it’s the group home kid Eddie Collins
About to a make promise
And bout to state it honest
Til the end to my fans i’ma pay you homage
And i’ll never exploit my music to make a profit
That’s like Andrew Jackson hanging out with Davie Crockett
That’s like tea baggers, and progressives socializing
It rarely happens
Like getting boards over Rodman
In the end, I want to be a hall of famer
Who flew under the radar hardcore like Danny Granger
After all my lyrics they’ll rewrite laws of physics
While accumulated haters claim its all a gimmick
In 99 I received an email from myself
Saying you can’t do this alone you gonna need some help
But music comes first second everybody else
Do it for the passion never do it for the wealth
And it was signed by a dude named Greydon Square
I was still Apocalypse consumed by anger and fear
So I didn't care
I just kept gang bangin’
Doing the same thing nothing in life changing
Compassion of the shelf
Blaming everyone else
Knock you out at the drop of a hat I needed help
I think I was in a search of self but in denial
The military the same shit a different pile
That’s a missionary relationship you on the bottom
While the killer instinct that they turn on they don’t turn off
You really want a ticking time bomb working your office
The socially awkward battle tested poetry author
What’s funny as a legend I don’t even want the title
I bet as chattel slaves we didn't even want the bible
The best part of my career was performing with my idol
At a live show, no moment could ever be it’s rival
Peruse my lyrics then speak them into the universe
Before a black man remember that I was human first
A newer verse
For you to do with to sooth your nerves
While it’s the perfect companion music
When you use the herb
Here’s the part we credit Carl Sagan
While master mathematicians listen to my music while they solve equations
...back at first they said I lacked the purpose
Now they call me a legend, I feel like I haven’t earned it
…this is the power, the recognition that this is ours
Give me an hour, I’m changing the way you think about it

Can't be paranoid if everyone’s out to get me
If I got to be a legend i’m taking you guys with me
This is the next installment in my cosmos series
...symphony of science I got Boswell with me
You can find me hanging out where ever truth is lurking
In a universe made up of many universes
...Lucifer? Ignorance is the truer serpent
Hell you just fell for a newer version

[Hook x2]
When you started rapping you didn't want to be great
You wanted cats walkin across town for cheesecake
Me I’d rather rock for pete’s sake
The spot for DJs
A live crowd or the freeway
This is hip hop. The art that oversees change
This is what we came to regain
True ascension for some they thought never could
Probably cause they’ll gave it all up to chase legendhood[Verse 1: Greydon Square]
I bet you Glenn Beck's magical underwear
That religion exists to take advantage of someone's fears
They still in my ear, like how you dissin
Jesus is the only man i know who can get nailed by men and be loved by radical Christians
In the lab, trying to lyrically get better
While your local churches send me out cease and desist letters
Your pastor warned you about me, the free thinker
The heat seeker, aiming at several weak preachers
I just want to leave my hand print
They call me repetitive and pedantic
When i'm the only one looking for answers
As a believer, i conceded there were evil and spells
Demons, i was fascinated with the end of the world
Even fascinated by the deepest regions of hell
Imagination can be crippled if you leave it to dwell
Hell they told me they took lies mixed it with Darwin
I used to watch Jack Van Impe and listen to Carmen
Holy cigarette companies act like i'm crook
The first bible i ever had was written like a comic book
That's no coincidence an easy target in the system
Wondering where the hell his family is cause he missed them
I prayed faithfully, as a soulless social worker
Showed up to snatched my only older sister away from me
Claiming she was crazy
My group home people stand up
My mother gave birth to me while wearing a pair of handcuffs

(Chorus)
You love my music until you listen to what i'm saying, see
You had my attention until you said you're gonna pray for me
So i might as well keep provoking and question everything
(People are tired of seeing faith used as a tool of attack)

[Verse 2]
This is underground, this ain't front page paper
And contrary to what you think you ain't safer
And there's a few Christians I respect like Frank Schaeffer
He might actually be able to save your late savior
Fear tactics to death panels in euthanasia
No wonder our kids are surpassed by the youth in Asia
Most of those kids have the education of 8th graders
No knowledgist information to be regurgitated
It hurts to say it, cause i really value education
But we must really want a stupid nation
And it's the same old story they kick
With two wars schools just ain't that high on the priority list
And it's the same war glory depicts
Stay stuck on the end of the world and we'll find a way to blow it to bits
Or am I the only one noticing it
Im tryna find somewhere besides the pulpit to sit
Compared to me you're a vegetable, you're susceptible
To faulty logic, while we make music for intellectuals
Today hip hop is a spectacle, a bunch of wrestlers
Workin ? ? with no testicles
Where's the knowledge at, the challenging of ideas
The arguments better be good you wanna challenge my peers
You wanna run with me don't get caught up with knee pain
Im chasin Canibus lyrics you chasin T-Pain
And it's sad the way our communities treat gays
Is the same way they treated the newly released slaves
Check these lyrics that you'll get scorched with
From Dawkins, Harris, Dennet to Hitchens im the 5th horsemen
Information addict so i spit eloquent
Until you can prove absolute right it's all relative
You keep saying hail Mary's and our fathers
But the world is waking up to the con-job of dogma
Wanna talk problems, shit don't even bother
Nuclear stockpiles still armed to launch all of em
And i'll tell you why people don't relate
We don't think deeply enough about the positions we take
We just believe whatever they say and take it on faith
And if you don't then you're betraying your race, what a waste
I salute the scientific method, verify it so there's no question, no guessin

(Chorus)[Verse 1: Lady Assassin]
That’s right toss your bible, you won’t need it for survival
We’re the heathens kicking reason for the pagans standing idle
Propaganda shit is viral, idiotic suicidal
So I guess we gotta come and wipe this shit out like a tidal
No bridal, I fuck cause I can
I refuse to take orders from invisible men
Oh you say being gay wasn't part of his plan?
Then why the fuck he give little girls the parts of a man?
(I’m just saying)

[Verse 2: Syqnys]
So you don’t girls that’s alright you’re gay
But you don’t like men, alright OK
So you join the priesthood kinda hide away
They find you with lil' Chucky watching child’s play
It’s ya boy Syqnys, you know i’m as sick as
Christopher Hitchens’ esophagus is
I mean was
That’s not a diss to Hitch
You got it twisted if you thinking that’s what this is
This is a vicious and a little malicious
Diss to religious ignorance so get this
Jehovah's witness and his holy scriptures
Off my porch before I go and roast this witless
Kid and Mormon missionaries
Cork it with ya
Little Joseph Smith and his little bogus visions
Yeah coke’s delicious
It’s a hell of a drug
Now tell your wife to put the soap to dishes
And sow my britches
Come on man Michael Vick didn't even have this many dopey bitches
I hope you get this
There’s no forgiveness
For the pope he gives his
Cardinals permission
To grope some kids man
It’s so seditious
But I hope the pope goes to the pokey with his little silly hat
Can an atheist really rap
Can atheist people actually really be feeling that
Can a hillbilly really eat a philly that’s filled with cats? huh?
Did that make more sense than your silly ass
They say the world was created in seven days
That's a weak story, get it a week story
Come on Grey, can’t you be stopping the beat for me
Every time I say something dope
Grey: “here sorry”
They say there’s no atheists in foxholes
They must have never heard of Greydon in the Army

[Verse 3: Greydon Square]
Please pardon the A.D. part three
Artsy emcee solving equations in Farsi
To Bob Marley’s catalogue
The world never ended you had it wrong
Kids of the 5th Babylon
Sending you and your cattle on
Mastodon stomp every single track i’m on
I have the form, to destroy any rapper who face me
You hate me and its war? Fine go get the A team
Oh you want to save me
It’s only the same thing
Christian Muslim Jew all on the same team
..a mad tradition of last the prediction
That’s indicative the of fear manipulation and ass kissing
That results in cash sent in
That they used to escape taxes with
In the pews spitting sacrilege
I'm from the system where the bastards live
Taught the people how to challenge the machine and now they’re activists
Sure as Kobe scores there will be a holy war
Declared in some godly name while someone’s asking show me more
...they wonder where all hip hop artists went
Cause ya’ll often spit softer than Kenny Lofton hits
Define all of this, my hypothesis is
I rose from Apocalypse’s sarcophagus pissed
....GU logo on the rocket ship
With everyone watching it knowing stopping it is sheer preposterous

[Verse 4: Tombstone]
My rhymes are toxic when they get exposed to oxygen
And probably responsible for the death of a lot of men
And most acknowledge the folly of taking shots at him
Or acting disrespectful and risking a mad leviathan
See your philosophy doesn't mean a lot to me
Cause 2 times out of 3 it was used to excuse atrocities
Another prophecy equals another failure
Another priest reaching for little kids genitalia
Oh...so now you’re offended....you say you repented
Claim a message from a god but I think you pretended
Besides...your god’s arms are much too short to try to box with mine
So stop lying trying to claim he inspired your rhyme
We don’t believe you....you're needing more people
Enough to stuff the church till it burst the church steeple
(plus) you lack intelligence...your gospel is irrelevant
Sit inside your sermon and heckle you for the hell of it
How many times you’re gonna let them fill your mind with fear
With end world prophecy and obviously we still here
No zombie apocalypse ain't tumbled down on top of us
And all that Mayan calendars stuff is just so preposterous
Go grab a slice of life and while you’re at it grab it twice
And ignore the bullshit that you’re hearing would be the best advice
Those dudes are charlatans … it’s time to make examples
Of traveling shit salesmen with mouths full of samples

[Verse 5: Johnny Hoax]
Come acknowledge the liberation in the right hand of science
You can ditch the holy books found on the nightstands of tyrants
I'm not impressed with cupcake critics and false skeptics
Kirk Cameron, Lee Strobel, William Lane Craig apologetics
Seriously insufficient and it clearly shows
Unless you peer review seeing Jesus in your Cheerios
I feel for those who know it's true and still oppose
Inner dilemma like Euthyphro living on fools gold
I got your god in my sentences with a lower case "G"
With an "S" in parenthesis to honor polytheistic liberties
It goes beyond that, psychics and palm readers
Astrology charts topping the list of con artists trying to cheat us
Thick in the mix is every one of your leaders
And the only one I can respect is comical Buddy Jesus
Taking moral high ground in support of wrongful action
I see now the irony touche' Wonka caption
Maintain your freedom to practice remain peaceful
But fuck religious freedom if it's only to enslave people
I pinpoint it as the suspect and the culprit
And let Bruce Almighty shit on that pseudo scientific bullshit

[Verse 6: Gripp]
This is so raw
The atheist roll call
So watch us get it open like crowbars
'Cos even a little jab'll give 'em a broke jaw
We go hard
And make their little leap of faith look like a pole vault
A battering ram we jam against oak doors
Stand planted with cannons
Approach ya'll
We're famished
But on a roll with some cole slaw
Word to the pope
We're 'bout to give them our own good news: Tom Brokaw
They call us interlopers
But I've never been as focused
'Bout to jam my penny loafers
In their colon 'til I kick the Stouffer's
Science is sexy; I belong on a pin-up poster
These religious nuts pop up like toast or some mini-gophers
You think there's any hope at all? Lose the foolish pride
Drop the holy books, and pick up some Grand Unified
Look at things through your human eyes
(not the crazy ones). Get off the losing side
I'll leave 'em stir-fried: Moo Goo Gai Pan/ You know who I am
Rhymes make live bands
Skip beats like, "God-damn!"
And I'm still tryin'a pick which person to murk
'cos beating me's Dawkins using his last words to convert
So if there is a god, he's surely depressed
That all these atheists
Are certainly blessed
Never stop for air; I take circular breaths
And when I step off the stage all the curtains are wet
From the perspiration. I'll flood the fucking Earth with my sweat
Go make an ark for that
Or go and make the seas part in half
Anything to validate or prove the way your martyr acts
'Til then, I'll be causing heart attacks
On any garbage rapper
With a harder act
An artist'll get carved in half
And for all of ya'll predicting the rapture:
Ya'll get on my last nerve
Pulling us backwards
Alright then, I guess I'm done killing stuff
My apologies, Greydon. That's been building up

[Verse 7: Task Rok]
I think it's easy to believe in a lie
Some people are high
And looking for a reason to die
I'm not concerned with a being in the sky
I'm not concerned with anything
That falls apart when my reasons applied
I don't believe in anything except my people and I
And the truth with a proof when repeated and tried
I believe some people are evil inside
& their guilt makes 'em go and find a steeple to hide
It's 2013, we need to decide religion is dead;
Too many innocent people have died
It's over. All of us are waking up
It's obvious they made it up
To politic and make a buck
Stealing lands, execution of the infidel
Self prophesied evolution of a living hell
I found happiness and everything I did myself
Y'all can say or prayer or throw a penny down the wishing well it's overHook:

In lyrical debate I’m ah throw everything plus the sink
I’m a black atheist and there’s more of us then you think
Whadja think? That I would just sit up and just let you cheat?
Never as long as there’s a be a single breath in me

I’ m ah
Keep attacking, every religious faction, every single section
If I didn’t mention yours. Every missed rapture, every single infection
If I fail to mention yours then you’ll get it next thing

(Greydon)
Verse1:

Check it! They want to shut me up
Wrap, shackle, and collar me
I try to dumb it down but
They won’t even follow me

That Scientology, them embrace other mythologies
Like Joseph Smith, Zeus, the tooth fairy and Bartleby

They try to threaten me
Say I would get it the worse
Even be cursed by characters
From View Askewniverse

Fuck you complaining for?
You think you living in hell?
When Muslim chicks can’t ever wear pants
Without going to jail?


Hell yeah, religions the problem
That’s why I stay on the topic
That’s why they wanna stop me
Like; I’m assaulting their prophet

Hate mail used to read
They were gonna kill me and such
Now they read
I don’t talk about other religions enough




Chorus:

In lyrical debate I’m ah throw everything plus the sink
I’m a black atheist and there’s more of us then you think
Whadja think? That I would just sit up and just let you cheat?
Never as long as there’s a be a single breath in me


I’ m ah

Keep attacking every religious faction, every single section
If I didn’t mention yours. Every missed rapture, every single infection
If I fail to mention yours then you’ll get it next then

(Noob)
Verse2:

God damn that I am
Religion’s a corporate scam
No voting for Uncle Sam
Enslaved with praying hands
The birth of the straw man
Whose part of his proclam
Fight tribal with family clans
Use rifles to conquer lands

Ourself is bought amassed in
Mass graves and abort disaster
Kill gays in courtless pastures
Enraging self-conscious rappers
Engage in Helter Skelter
The rays from the sun will meld them
Past days I was feeling helpless
I prayed for the god to selfish
To escape from my mental prison
Make days for cataclysm
Instating the global system
Embracing the earth collision
Extinction level event
From comets that’s heaven sent
Atomic malevolence
Trick knowledge from presidents

Instead of studying evidence
Pursuing benevolence
Galactic alliances
With secular scientists
Wonder astronomies
Exploring the bottomless
Ignored by the populace
Off course with the apocalypse

Chorus:

In lyrical debate I’m ah throw everything plus the sink
I’m a black atheist and there’s more of us then you think
Whadja think? That I would just sit up and just let you cheat?
Never as long as there’s a be a single breath in me


I’ m ah

Keep attacking, every religious faction, every single section
If I didn’t mention yours. Every missed rapture, every single infection
If I fail to mention yours then you’ll get it next then


Greydone Verse:

Another form of population control
The very idea and nature
Of somebody needing to save us is old
Religiosity is taking its toll
You don’t even challenge the old
World views they placed in your skull?!
That’s why I got you beat
With a whole array of common functions
You’re weak. You think you need
A god to accomplish something

Another classic case of codependence
If he’s all that you say that he is
He probably negates his own existence

They exterminated him
He’s in a form of Raids
Former slaves still serving the gods
Of former slaves

I fight for the freedom of strangers
When I blurt lines
I’m chill on the mic?
Like power of sixes first prime?

I’ve been constantly evolving
Since the first line
You can do one thing
I can invert mine

I dare your god to show up
To damn my blasphemy
I bet I have more questions for his ass
Then he’ll have for me

Chorus (2X):

In lyrical debate I’m ah throw everything plus the sink
I’m a black atheist and there’s more of us then you think
Whadja think? That I would just sit up and just let you cheat?
Never as long as there’s a be a single breath in me


I’m ah

Keep attacking, every religious faction, Every single section
If I didn’t mention yours. Every missed rapture, every single infection
If I fail to mention yours then you’ll get it next thenIf I'm on borrowed time
That just means tomorrow’s mine
You’ll find the hardest rhyme I've ever spit in the marble mines
...my music you can throw on in a bind
Grab the mic i’ll chop it off and claim your arm is mine
....I think I might be a verse addict
I thought your kung fu would get better over time but now you're worse at it
The purple flame in Urkel’s name I burp sulfur
Stop rapping and give me the mic back your turn’s over
It’s still Trek
I’m hip hop’s version of Data
So much ass I get
They call me a nerdy Fela
Lead the revolution from the front
But eat these brownies first, you’ll be high for a month
...first they’ll ignore it, then they’ll say the timing’s off
...then try to bribe but won’t have the money to buy me off
It’s not the voice, it’s what you tried to do with it
...They would rather see me rap to pursue riches
...not out on the streets
Or trying to help my fellow man not to drown in the sea
They say there’s people here that don’t know why
That’s fine with me
At least while they’re here we can open their eyes
I’m trying to see
A change of state
The kind of change Obama was too afraid to make
He was bought off
Just to alter California pot laws
Even though the major use had dropped off
If you do your own thinking it’s not hard
If you don’t you might end up peppered sprayed in the backseat of a cop car
The end is not far
...still you want to be a rock star
Passing hungry people in a hot car
I wanna be Rygar
Fight for the future from an 8-bit perspective
The loss of history is our greatest depression
...i wanna know what part of Africa I come from
.they want me to work hard and pay taxes to someone
While they tap in to some fund
Funnel money into the process that we could use to have them undoneChorus
Ayo, you gotta use your "brains"
All I really asked of you is that you try to use your "brains"
Holy zombie jesus I'm coming for the "brains"
If you really want to battle me then you better use your "brains"
Yea, they think it's a game and fail to use their "brains"
On some lame outdated books, thats weighing down their "brains"
Even though the same teaches not to use your "brains"
That's insane, so here is just something else for your "brains"

(Verse 1)
There's a reason they teach it to you when your when your young
Cause a grown up asking for evidence isn't fun
Trying to explain how you should believe in the same dated creation
Myths
When you trying to convert someone
Name a faith that lets you think for self
I'll join tomorrow
That doesn't have a heaven or hell
Or promote sorrow
You mean to tell me you need someone else to tell you that slavery
Rape and murder is wrong?
I'll arm myself with "logic for dummies" books
Ten under each arm
Walk in the church and start servin em all (Here, read this)
No burnin' of crosses, or sick holocausts
Make em rewrite the bible with my verses in psalms
I tend to write better songs
Goddamn where does Eddie get off
Not just yours I mean every god
The lyrical rendition of Bill Maher's Religulous
I'm serious, religion is bullshit and we're sick of it
Now deal with it

Chorus (Last line changed to "Hide Mohammed cause you know im coming to pick his "brains")

(Verse 2)
Pull up next to someone and look over see who's bumpin'
You already dumb pyramid schemes dont need nothin
They look at me like oh shit Xenu's coming
Lets take a look at the facts to really see who's frontin
Like your god I drop bombs into active volcanoes
This isnt science at all I should snatch it from your label
The actors expect to see a return thats why they follow it
I'm a nerd they lucky I don't side with the Chanologists
Launch full all-out attack on their domain name
And any rapper who'd believe crap to play the fame
Want to try and make his own religion im a get em
Like a Muslim or a Christian, Scientologist or Wiccan
Keep spittin superior logic in the lyrics
I will personally rid em of thetan infested spirits
So there it is, welcome to religion
Where it's "thou shall not kill" unless their different

Chorus

(Verse 3)
Lyrical debate I'm a throw everything plus the sink
I'm black Atheist and there's more of us than you think
What'd you think that I would just sit up and just let you cheat
Never. As long as there's a beat
And a single breath in me
I'm a keep attacking
Every religious faction
Every single section
If I didn't mention yours then you get it next when..
I step to your reverend with them skeptic questions
A real teacher would've questioned the lesson
Wait a second just take a second to second guess it
What are the main lessons? pain, war, oppression
God can kill, do whatever he wants more or less and
Forget the moral questions it presents, obey without question
That's called "group think" it happens in Hip-Hop
Rappers change their style to fit with whatever shit's hot
And I didn't start the "us verses them" it was them
Ask them if its us versus them

ChorusThe following entry is based on actual events in my life
For those who was wondering, yes this really happened

Dear Journal
I don't even know what to write
Today was just another bad day in my life
I feel like cryin' but honestly I done run outta tears
So many thing have happened to me
I done run outta fears
Damn its hard bein' 16 knowing it just me
I'm convinced that every one in the world is against me
Why don't these people just stop bothering me?
Would they stop if I swallowed a bottle of Tylenol 3?
Cuz honestly I'm seriously thinking about it
Hell everywhere I go I find me thinkin about it
Damn Journal why is this the only option I have?
Other than going back to school and gettin bullied in class
Please help me
You are the only friend that I have
Other than the imaginary ones I've had in my past
You know what? Its probably better to die
I'll write in you tomorrow and let ya know what I decide

Dear Journal
Who do things have to be this way?
Sick of feeling this way I wanna leave this place
Please Journal make these people go away
Before I pull a Columbine and they get blown away
Why Journal?
Why it me why does it have to be me instead of someone else's child?
Why Journal? do you not answer my thoughts
I guess I just deserve to die

Dear Journal
Guess what I got some really good news
I was walking through a park today and found a gun after school
Man I'm excited I don't even know what to do
Should I use it on my self or should I take it to school?
Man this is cool you should see the barrel and trigger
Better yet Journal you should taste the barrel and trigger
I know I did in fact soon as I got to my house
I ran straight in to the bathroom and stuck it dead in my mouth
Pulled the hammer back gettin ready to squeeze
Laughin and cryin the at the same time on my knees
But something told me "No, Please don't go"
And while I was hesitating some one knocked on the door
I got scared, took the gun out of my mouth
Put it back in my pocket grabbed my backpack and got out
Smiling cuz I know I'll be better about it
Heading back to my room so I can tell ya about it

Dear Journal
Who do things have to be this way?
Sick of feeling this way I wanna leave this place
Please Journal make these people go away
Before I pull a Columbine and they get blown away
Why Journal?
Why it me why does it have to be me instead of someone else's child?
Why Journal? do you not answer my thoughts
I guess I just deserve to die

The only thing we ever needed was for somebody to love us
Pay attention to these kids
Some of them need help
Help 'em
Love em'
Or they'll end up like me(Intro)
Microphone check 1...2...Ha Ha
Alright, this is the dopamine kata
Look
(Verse 1)
Global following
Barely known locally
Training in the Force alone
...For more potency
A lyrical injection of fresh dopamine
...Impart verses with the depth of chest openings
On my way to the stage you won't notice me
...like an undiscovered Big Pun:
...That's pretty sobering
Labels don't want a Kunta
...They want to Toby me
Men feel it in their nuts
...Women in their ovaries
I'm right here in the paint for you to poster me
...But I'mma still go for the block
...That's how it's supposed to be
Spit gross while these drones pray the Rosary
...Extract alkaloid from my flows: like they were coca leaves
And with all the negotiating and brokering
...They never had a deal on me
...They never could have closed a thing
I was in Germany when they heard of me
...Nerdily spitting lyrics about deep time and short eternities
So what are you talking about
...the only thing you understand is stanky leg and walking it out
...the type of pitcher to balk on the mound
...we spit fluid , you got chalk in the mouth
Wack emcees be tossing them out
...Whether they come form the east, west, north or the south
They can get the proverbial verbal sword to the mouth if they got a problem
...We take man's biggest problems and try to solve them
Look: the model is changing, we aren't adapting fast enough
...We have solutions too but ain't no body asking us
Don't ask america cause we're to busy catching up
...Screaming up and down we're on top while others laugh at us
...And this ain't nothing to be be proud about
Take the silver spoon and rip it out of your mouth
...Give you something to pout about
You're just another carbon chemical structure
...in a star system with millions of others
You speak knowledge then I'm feeling you brother
...If not then you get from me nothing
This is a preemptive strike and you seem to be bluffing
...Kind of North Korean like, And you still won't do nothing

(outro x3-5)
This is the dopamine kata, fresh dopamine. (Broken up as if a DJ scratched a record)[Verse 1]
Name another packing this much inside a melody
Secluded, but when I emerge you’ll get a better me
I’d rather die alone, than to, without a legacy
You, would rather brag about fools committing felonies
Truth, just gets ignored
In lyrics, a bigger penalty
Screw a hologram my music fulfills my memory
...those aren't stars they’re galaxies that you’re looking at
I knock planets out of their orbit with a wooden bat
...what do you see when look at rap?
Just a hook and clap?
We weren’t impressed so we took it back->
I blame everyone who didn’t demand a better sound
The new generation, the elders even let us down
..too hip hop for the community
Too secular for the hip hop community to know what to do with me
They foolishly underestimated what I created
Now they hate it
Enraged the outcast became the favorite

[Hook]
You would've thought that things would've changed but
They still sell us saviors
And still let em weigh us down
You’d think we’re just a link in a chain but
They still separate us
And still want to break us down
We’re still on a journey in the making
Our purpose for the shaping
That’s not too late to turn around
Don’t let em put the world in the matrix
Control the information
Exposing the game in town

[Verse 2]
I specialize in particle physics and time folds
I got numbers big enough to swallow a god whole
When I rap I spit a fifth state of matter in fact
I’m Black Bolt. Speech is the most lethal weapon I pack
One whisper in your direction would put you through a mountain
Boil the water underneath you and cook you in a fountain
You ain't no where in the multiverse that i’m found in
Even though I've searched clusters and star systems by the thousands
They challenged me to tune a verse
To the perspective view of the elders of the universe
See if you could do it first
To move the earth using words isn't too absurd
Especially if you’re used to moving tools to the lunar surface
The fool emerges
From the school with a dual purpose
As a teacher but also tool merchant
...wander the globe disarming his foes
With his heart held within his palm, his karma enclosed
...his aura glowing orange and gold
And he can calm anybody who says that they aren't sold with a poem
...this is his mission, to live as a musician as you listen
To him converting parsecs into inches
...a reward for a brain that’s info seeking
Ten more reasons for him to study and then he’ll leave em’
A leap into the unknown they might honor
To go to infiltrate the next globe with life on herYeah Grand Unified... Oh, you know that already... Okay
Rational Response... What? You know that too?
Alright fine what ever I'm just gonna say whatever the hell I wanna say

Look
Now when I spit just know that part of its phlegm
For these rappers that are just mad because I'm smarter than them
And ego not withstanding you know what they gonna say
"I don't have book smarts I but I got street smarts"
Yeah okay
That's just a way to justify that you dumber than hell
You got the IQ of a rock
That you smart as a box of nails
I guess you hood if you can read at a 4th grade level
And that you honestly think that a spoon is a small shovel
That's why these rappers think that cannabis is wack
Cuz he makes em feel stupid and they can't have that
I guess with money you don't have to be smart huh?
You could be a Lloyd from dumb and dumber part one
Talking about cars when you got hit by a parked one
Claimin' that you're fire but don't know how to start one
What?

So let 'em talk
Let 'em call me a Square
Cuz they just mad
Because my ears are bigger than theirs
Its West game

No
Don't stop the show
(Compton's version of Will Smith
Compton's version of Will Smith)
Don't
Don't Stop the show
(Compton's version of Will Smith
Compton's version of Will Smith)

You should treat my metaphors like a slap in the face
You a wienie you should come in a package of 8
We can battle for a million dollars cash in the case
You spit a wack verse to me and I gonna laugh in your face
(HAHA that was wack)
You say I'm corny that ain't nothin' new
I've been told worse from people more important that you
They think I'm different now cuz I don't cuss no more but trust
I fornicate under the consent of the king you up still
My musics jumpin' like a frog on a limb
This is real talk fool like dialogue on a film
I get juiced like Barry Bonds on a steroid binge
Spit balls and sick lines like your elbow bends
You ain't gonna beat me so you need to stay focused
That's harder than finding a single woman with no kids
(That's hard)
And if you tell your crew I dis you in pairs
Cuz they probably mad too my ears are bigger than theirs

Its west game

No
Don't stop the show
(Compton's version of Will Smith
Compton's version of Will Smith)
Don't
Don't Stop the show
(Compton's version of Will Smith
Compton's version of Will Smith)

My are so bit I had to pierce with a Glock 40
That's why I didn't cuz for me it rings a nice sporty
You won't catch me in 'em vagina-less cock orgies
My ears jump off my head and patrol my block for me
I use my ears as portable fox holes
Wrap 'em around my body so I know where the shots go
When enemy fire comes in from multiple spots yo
Whenever I'm out rover patrollin' the Congo
(where they at?)
Say what you want I know you can't stand it
My ears a damn planet
My ears are bigger than a fat Janet
(That's big)
That college you in is bigger than mad campus
And got more meat than a double Quizno ham sandwich
So you can't say nothing bout I already said
And if you bring it to battle you already dead
There better things to talk about than what's on Eddie's head
So you better bring something else if you want Eddie's head

No
Don't stop the show
(Compton's version of Will Smith
Compton's version of Will Smith)
Don't
Don't Stop the show
(Compton's version of Will Smith
Compton's version of Will Smith)

There's now way I can put this one the album
This song's stupid as hell
Balls on your chin[Greydon Square]
You hand me a beat
I'll abuse it like Catholic priests
Do to children during the holiest of Vatican weeks
The sack of my beats ain't phat they enormous
They'll leave you brainwashed off and lost like a pack of Mormons
You disrespect my clan you better run and hide
The same way Christians accept 'Intelligent Design'
If you push the truth aside then the ministers win
But if you so strong in your beliefs then answer me this
If the memories of a life's retained in the brain
And the brain dies inside it nothing remains
Wouldn't that mean
You would have absolutely and positively no recollection or account of previous things
When you die?
Angels and demons devils and Gods do not await you
Even if your own condition would not escape you'd
Sit up and church with fake faith and false hope
Get up burst Amen! And Praise God!
Jesus, he saves lives!
Molest your daughter and cheat on your wife at the same time
And claim I'm speakin' the devil and I'm going to hell
And as far as hell speak of the devil
It's amazing how this God is ubiquitous omnipresent
Existent in every stitch of existence
But yet and still it's this place devoid of his presence of torment and sickness
You go forever for 80 years of sins you committed
It's ridiculous. And you know what makes it worse
Is the fact that nobody else seems to have an issue with it
Just blindly giving in to it, but me
But maybe I'm the crazy person maybe it's just me
I love sayin' there isn't a God
I'm just sayin' that the God in the bible isn't God
You may think it's odd
That I'm black and I don't swear by a God that every body recognizes as God
I'm tired of sayin' the word God
It's self-defeating meaningless
Just a title, idle reverence for some lenience
And lenience for what
Every single sin that we have in our arsenal he gave us to strut
And For what?
What kind of sense does it make?
To create a sinful creation that you judge from the gate
And then send your only son to prohibit the fate
That you ultimately responsible for
And in why the hell am we sayin he
Cause if God had a sex than he wouldn't be
And maybe if he was God then he couldn't leave
His greatest creation alone in its time of need
And this is what I mean
We ignore the obvious in front of us
And 2000 years from now people gone be makin' fun of us
If we last that long
If the Muslims don't kill the Christians
And the Christians don't kill the non-Christians cause they can't compete with the Muslims
Cause the Muslims cutting peoples heads off chantin' in Arabic claimin' they love em'
Declaring jihad on western Muslims
Takin' innocent lives for nothing
Cause' maybe it isn't maybe it just seems
Maybe I'm the crazy person maybe it's just me
Maybe I'll just leave
And take my crazy belief system and just leave
Cause really it's just me...
Ill say it once and never again
I'll never go back cause there thinkin' for yourself's a helluva sin
Us against them, I wonder who'd win
Cause all we really have to do is spit logic to get under their skin
That's why I'm "extian"[Verse 1]
Embedded in a sea of dark matter
My thoughts scattered
Up looking for odd patterns
I've been spewing verses
Since Galileo was shattering “earth centered universe” world views of human servants
Strong like molecular bond
I was in the Hadean Aeon writing songs
...how you gonna diss or pretend to be my enemy
Critiquing evolution but don’t know biochemistry?
That's the great thing about science
If you don’t like the hypothesis your welcome to try and falsify it
Token old men who were still using potions
Thought Newton mind was broken he discovered motion
You value truth then proudly show it
Its never about what we know, its how we know what we know it
… the lyrical sentence that murderers would face
Like relativity describes the curvature of space is Grey

[Verse 2]
I am the knight the beat is the chessboard
So prepare your queen to get forked
Let’s war
Put me up against your best sword
You ain't even that good, I heard you at best fourth
You seem them hills over there, head for
You still on Gucci Mane I’m studying red dwarfs
They talk to you dumb, you should expect more
While listening to us be upping your test scores
We teach you physics evolution and chemistry
They teach you to hate your fellow human with bigotry
We challenge lessons ask questions and scrutinize
They challenge questions mask lessons with stupid lies
How is it fair between you and I
Even in a mental exercise you could die
I’ve exceeded the upper and lower bounding limits of astounding digits
Using profoundly different algorithms

[Verse 3]
You could’ve came, you had the chance
You stayed and left me to traverse the vast expanse
The only spiritual I understand is study
The pursuit of knowledge is highest regardless if there’s a guy above me
You need to look up at the stars
And wonder how many species is looking up at ours
....from the moon to mars
...we gon’ be in charge of the lunar barge
Where scientists are the superstars
Ape chatter shaped after great masters
16 bars made from 8 innate patterns
The late chapters of man escape raptures
Afraid slackers and paid actors inflate matters
Still pick up an eighth... same address
Then it’s back to the lab to deal with the same madness
If i was the insane savage they portray me as
I’d steal the fastest spaceship and straight crash it, laughing!They want someone to save us
Journey in the making
At unsustainable speeds we trying to keep pace with
All this information
Here for the taking
13.7 Billion years in the making

I got a transfinite number of rhymes
Intricately designed, intended to be unleashed one at a time
Archeologists recognize me as part of the find
Its amazing how you can't tell space apart from the time
As you approach the velocity of c the time gets slow
The farther you look, the further back in time you go
5's across the board everything is nominal
A creator causes cause and effect to fall like dominoes
These are questions and riddles that are yearning me
To look up at the stars, and stare into eternity
I'm just looking for the final equation is all
And I'd a be unsatisfied if the answer was god
A creator of the cosmos needs more than just a bad temper
His true nature coming in focus like a fast render
Tried to explain but your logic and your math centers
No where to be found like the Tea Party's black members

I don't want to be the average rap dude
My rhymes stay constant like light speed in a vacuum
Assembled in a DARPA lab
With enough augmentations to make a science fiction author laugh
I Assimilated the best part of your favorite rappers
With species 8472 and Borg tactics
Hack in to the digital drive, ransack it
Purge all the coonery songs, wack rappers
Take it back to spittin lyrics as straight passion
And revolutionize hip hop with mass action
Last thing i'll say about light you need to master
That only things without mass can travel faster
You and I can change lives without masters
Others want to sit by, wait for thine rapture
Make the check out to the church and fine pastor
Getting burnt like they was standing behind dragsters
Socialize with other minds might they might capture
With techniques of manipulation and fright tactics
You might ask if, a Christ who had passion
Would allow his dad to ask for murder as rite passage

This is the type of position you find ravaged
I'm only askin', the question that got passed ya
You respond with variant hate like Mike Savage
Til you gettin carried away like flight baggage

(x2)
Raw elegant rhymes based on hard evidence
From a vet of a war waged on false intelligence
Forged from torrent of racially charged prejudice
I'm trying to avoid going extinct ahead of them

(x2)
They want someone to save us
Journey in the making
At unsustainable speeds we trying to keep pace with
All this information
Here for the taking
13.7 Billion years in the making[Verse 1]
I woke up, on my day off feeling robust
Bout to toke up, with my main dog who’s a grow buff
He knows stuff nobody knows about the cheeba
Grow yields every month from indicas to sativas
Roll over to his phat bachelor pad
He holds everything edibles hash wax and dabs
Crash on the couch, bout to go half on an pound
Pass it around mp3 blastin the sounds
Thick jars with more colors than them Pixar flicks are
Roll up the swisher and hit the spliff hard
A good day. What? You ain't seeing me in 2k....
Throw it in. Lob City versus LA? touche
...get a game or two chillin with my favorite crew
The flower girl embedded in everything thing we do
We came we blew, the la got our chests locked
Pound of fresh pot and now I’m out to the next spot
....Then it’s peace and i’m off in the wind
Trying to avoid the law enforcements again
Why pretend
Im high and my eyes are glowing red
But rather seeing them I notice other things instead

[Hook]
...like where ever I go
Everywhere I look it’s...
(Flowers Everywhere)x2
Like where ever I roll and
Everywhere i’m lookin’
(Flowers Everywhere)x2

[Verse 2]
Super blunted on the way to get some munchies
My mind wandering between space and something crunchy
...So hungry I could eat a whole a planet
If the year was 05, I could eat a whole Janet
When you in the store lit
Everything looks gorgeous
Ice cream or chips with dip, even oranges
Even ladies in the store looking eatable
The flower girl type have yo ass cooking vegetables
She says she knows a party blooming with green
And she’ll probably be appearing with two of her team
I said cool
Hit me up, we’ll roll in a few
Headed home thought about her smile over some food
She probably thinks i’m just the type to hit and run quick
That i’m just lookin for a place to get my blunt lit
Until she finds out i’m just a musician
Just trying to get the vision of his mind out through his lyrics and have you listen
...but now I can’t stop thinking
About the flower girl that I met that evening
Plant seekin
Inviting me out for mad chiefin’
That promised every room in the house would have weed in

[Hook]
She text me when got there
Said everybody had their...
(Flowers Everywhere)x2
With everybody rollin up
And the party growin
(Flowers Everywhere)x2

[Verse 3]
Every party, seems it’s the same
Everybody’s got drink but finding weed is a pain
But that wasn’t the case when I dropped by
This flower party I even ran into my pot guy
Over bob marley
So much smoke in the house the air was clear barely..
Joints, bongs, blunts even dabs snare me
I’m fairly certain behind the therapy curtain they’re barely workin’
This function was eerily perfect
Once I felt a tap on my shoulder it was over
I knew it was her, turned around and she was holding
A super blunt hit held in her lungs
She came closer, had me then inhaling the sum
Great company, atmosphere, a ton of weed
Flower girls all over the house that want to puff with me
Right now I just feel lucky to be
Like the plants I was lucky to chief, with my peeps
...We didn't leave until the sun rose
Up all night, breathing trees with some fun folks
Games music drinks even dumb jokes
Brought to us, by the flower girl everyone knows

[Outro]
We walk out, in the early morning and all we saw was
(Flowers Everywhere)x2
And I notice the first thing I wanted to do was smell the
(Flowers Everywhere)x2"Somewhere in the #GUniverse"

[Verse 1]
Wanted! Schrödinger’s cat. Dead or alive
Proclaims the cosmic guardian that’s embedded in time
I’ve been perusing information since the planck epoch
And 13 billion years later I remain epic
You probably fly on complex planes if you feelin’ me
My rhyme sequences escape me and race to infinity
Lyrically, what I spit is self similar
Energy, within every rhyme and next syllable
You know he’s the next mr x so lets kill a bowl
Don’t spit if you can’t generate, a fresh millivolt
Every rhyme that I kick displays a fractal
Revealing hidden landscapes at different scaling patterns
Star view? no it’s a galaxy rise
But appears as a bottomless pit with a maddening dive
To us a black hole’s just a gravity slide
We went about our lives as the last reality died
But you weren’t here yet
You weren’t even a fluctuation of quantum weirdness
While we were perfecting art, song and lyrics
Our earliest artilects surpass the abilities of your gods best
You don’t even have a math for the silliness of the objects

[Verse 2]
There’s hints of our existence on your moon
A compendium, but you can only reach it when you’re on the shrooms
You type 1’s just defeated your flesh
Thinkin you fresh while we keep planet eaters as pets
....early on, you almost killed your selves
The craft you built, might as well be equipped with sails
Compared to us you’re just snails, a jest to the scale
...we get to meet every alternate version of ourselves
Travel the Pleiadian cosmic ruins
While snackin’ on extra dimensions nobody uses
For amusement
In 3 dimensional time where we jump forward freeze moments even rewind
You speak of divine while we just see a primitive mind
Trying to explain what it can’t in limited rhymes
We are the reflection of life in the night view
A galaxy rise, this is what awaits you at type II
