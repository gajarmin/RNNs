[Hook: Bob Marley]
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'[Intro: Akon]
As life goes on
I'm startin to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I wanted to take this time out
To apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occured yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sittin home just wishin we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

[Hook: Akon]
I understand there are some problems
And I'm not to blind to look
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can apologize for bein wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryin to stay busy 'til you heard from dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a theif
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryin to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryin to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen gettin shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out disgracin my name
I'm just a singer tryin to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame

Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on meIt's ya muh'fuckin boy, "Jump Off" Joe Budden here
Clinton Sparks we gon' get familiar with it
We gon' get familiar together man, hey...
Sparks, holla at ya boy - that old time music!

[Hook: Joe Budden]
Whatever it takes, to find a way, to find a way, to find a way
I'mma do whatever it takes, to find a way, to find a way, to find a way
I'mma do whatever it takes to find a way, to find a way, to find a way
Whatever it takes to find a way, to find a way, to find a way

[Verse One]
Alright I'm dealin with some shit homey, it's in the back of my head
And it's some shit homey, but I just rap it instead
See I got Wolverine's bones in me, but the whole world
Is throwin stones at me like they all gotta bone with me
Got a child's mother, and I hate her to death
But that's my child's mother, so that's my mate to the death
It's wild how I love her, for puttin little me here
And me and her could beef forever, she gon' still be there
Then there's some other niggas, I judged their character wrong
But they some other niggas, now let's get back to the song
I got a drug problem, that I ain't tending to
Because I got enough problems, and my solution is to stuff problems
But if something goes wrong with that
Then it's back to PCP and so long with rap
See I'm depressed lately, but nobody understands
That I'm depressed lately, I'm sorta feelin repressed lately
But y'all been hearin and seein me less lately
Like has anyone noticed the regress lately?
Look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately
Seem disturbed, lot of regrets lately?
Got a company, that I'm signed to
But they ain't in my company, when all I need is some company
When I start feelin like e'rybody's done with me
I try to see what e'rybody want with me
Then the mistress, yeah, the girl from 10 Minutes it's her;
Now I'm needin ten minutes from her
I can't get into it, but I want y'all to know
That I'll get into it, but I'll save that for The Growth
Then it's rap beef, but I'm so secure with me
It's only rap beef, I don't need se-cu-rity (never)
Wanna get at me, wanna go to war with me
That's just one phone call for me, check the shit
I got a whole hood, that don't appreciate me
But It's not the whole hood, that depreciates me (okay)
What you gon' tell me, when it's the streets that made me
And I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me
And then it's rap critics, they say all I make is dance music
But to almost anything you can dance stupid
They ain't like the single, so they ain't copped that album
Wouldn't give a chance to it, not a second glance to it
They say "he whines too much he's too bitter" (and)
They call it complainin, I call it explainin (y'know)
How normal niggas could get caught up in the game and
Lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment
Some shit with me, but dudes been knew that
But I'm gamblin a lot and I ain't used to do that (nah)
Rap ain't payin the bills, it's mo' money mo' problems
Or it's no money mo' problems
All enormous when you play at these stakes
That's how it feels to have a warrant on a famous face
Then the album's pushed back, cause they say he need a single
At the moment, but what he needs is a single moment
Then I'm involved in the he say, she say
(that's) in my mind on replay, each day
((then) Then it's the bullshit that she say, "he's gay"
Cause she wouldn't like to think that he ain't like her
Just cause she was throwing it at me and I ain't touch her
She'll say anything side from I ain't wanna fuck her (nah)
I don't feel good, so I won't wanna go to a club
Don't wanna go to a lounge, just wanna lounge (I just wanna lounge)
In the same sweats that I had on for days
Same tee I had on for a week, what I got on it speaks
What I got on, it reeks
No shape up, chillin, cause that's just how I'm feelin
And one day at a time, it's God willin
(see I'm) Tryin to see straight but the fog keeps buildin
Pulse start racin, the bulls startin to hate me
But I gotta be a king, cause there's wolves tryin to play me
Hoodie when it's hot like it's freezin winter
Rap star, eat and sleep for dinner
And it's hard tryna keep this in ya, so I write it all down
So one day maybe when life is all sweet I remember
Then it's probation, I know we all go through it
We call it probation, but there's no pro to it
Yeah my soul's achin, only a few peers know
Funny thing about the case is it's a few years old
Had some shit going on with my ohh, that felt good but it's bad
So I'm sittin here like what the bitch had
It's not rap it's real, look scrappy it's true
Goin what's popping, do he look happy to you?
Now if it goes to the wire, got the soul of a fighter
Bruised up and sloppy, or damaged like Ali
Up late talkin to the fans on a website
That's the only thing that send your man off to bed right
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
Well maybe not mom, just let me remain calm
This too won't last, this too shall pass
At least that's what I say y'all, that's what I pray for
And I'm the only thing that's standin' in my way y'all
But I gotta be with me, it's no escape y'all
I guess depression just stepped in
And took over shit like it's known to do
Guess it said, hey Joe, I'm goin home with you
Turn your phone off, I need to be alone with you
I need to be in the zone with you
Cause I'm the only thing you've prone to nigga, look I own you nigga
Been with you since 10, but you startin to confuse me
Cause it's been so long and you still tryin to lose me
Like how could you show me such cruelty
When everybody turns their back on you Joe it's you and me
Still you don't want me to see you right
And why you always come get me, how we reunite, huh?
I know you feel for me deep in your heart
Doctors, meetings, pills couldn't keep us apart
But now you got a deal and you wanna get rid of me
We roommates, I'm in your head Joe, you live with me
So I don't write for the fans, nah, I write to my man
In hopes that he'll just leave and understand
Like, like please leave the kid in peace
Let me smoke this one cig' in peace (just give me 10 minutes)
Just leave for a second man, it's been too long and I can't troop it
And long as you around I can't make that dance music

[Hook] - to fade[Hook]
She loves me, she loves me not
I can't tell if she's down or not
Oh, you like me?
What the hell does that mean?
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Are we gonna fuck or not?

[Verse 1 - Mike Posner]
Maybe I'm just dumb
But I can't read the signals that you're givin'
And I can never tell
If you're looking at me or Clinton
Is this the way that you talk to every guy that you meet?
Or do you wanna come back and stay up
All night, all night, all night with me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
Baby, what's your favorite drinks?
I think I'mma buy a round of 'em all
I'm rollin' up the bestest
Come help me blow a pound of it all
I'm on that up-upper echelon
You should climb up and be down with it all
Come here, cause we go hand in hand
Like (*clap clap clap*), round of applause
Showtime bitch, action
I think it's time for that night scene
She go to sleep and dream about my sex
I guess it's a pipe dream
28, but I make her feel like she 19
Tryna stick around like wifey
But I send her home in my white T like
"Bye"

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Clinton Sparks]
Now, every time I see this girl
She be askin' all type of shit
Where is it I'm going to
And who is it I'm hanging with?
Can't ever tell if she into me
Or just wanna be a friend to me
Mixed signals she's sending me
Late night at the club, drunk texted me
Like, "Can I come over your house?"
Okay, but can I come over your mouth?
Smiley face, LOL
Back and forth, I can't tell
Without being conspicuous
So (don't be so ambiguous girl)

I just touched down in killa Cali, strapped up my boots
Got scooped up by Game so I hopped up in the Coupe
(Ahh, whattup nigga?) What the hell is goin on?
I'm tryin to ease back and get my head in the zone
(Then where the fuck you tryin to go?) Nigga this yo' city
Anywhere, I'm just tryin to see some ass and titties
So fool mash the gas, the night is young
All bullshit aside I'm tryin to have some fun
Hit the hop in Lakewood, or ride down Slauson
Or the casino, they say it's just like Compton (ha ha)
Really doesn't matter, long as shots don't rang out
(Nigga I stay strapped, I don't wanna pull the thang out)
Well keep the heat heat right up under the seat
And let's roll to Roscoe's and grab somethin to eat
But check your rearview mirror, I swear somebody's followin
Rollin in that dark blue SS Impala and
All up on the bumper, man I'm just sayin
Tell me you know this nigga (nah, they better stop playin)
He sped up around and drove right in front of us
Could be one-time just tryin to bust one of us
'Til he smashed the brakes and we almost hit him
Throwin signs out the window like somethin was wrong wit him
Before we jump out and get ready to clown
(Nigga call up the homies, it's about to go down)

[Hook: Ludacris] + (The Game)
Keep one eye open cause the streets don't sleep
(If the streets get hungry then the streets gon' eat)
That's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds, nigga
(Call up the homies, it's about to go down)
Call up the homies, it's about to go down?
(Yeah, call up the homies, it's about to go down)
Yeah that's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds
Nigga call up the homies, it's about to go DOWN

[The Game] + (Ludacris)
Somebody tell Luda I'm on the way now (aight)
Just stepped one size 12 Air Force 1 in the A-Town (ha ha ha)
And you know where I'm headed
To the Lennox Mall to get it done head to toe NWA style (do it)
Keep it gangsta from the waist down
And this chrome trey-pound got me feelin Atlanta +Brave+ now (right)
Disturbin' Tha Peace, I'll let the lead spray
I'm startin to love this place, they even got Red Clay (okay)
Hit a different strip club e'ry day (yeah)
And I don't make it rain, it's a hurricane on the way (ha ha ha)
And I got the A-Town pump
It'll make your whole body do the A-Town stomp (woo!)
Then it's off to the Waffle House
And pancake mix ain't the only thing comin out her mouth
And her 42 D's comin out her blouse
Her baby daddy comin in (Game, get out the house, and)

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Yeah, I'm in a real-life movie, so this is take three
When Luda step foot out in Phoenix, A-Z
Superbowl super hoes, rappers on stroll
So I put the call in to Willy Northpole

[Willy Northpole] + (Ludacris)
Woo, big homie I got ya, stick to you like a cactus
Walk up to the 'burbs city Chris take off your jacket
I know you kinda used to big booties in the club
But ain't nothin wrong to have a lil' sauce in your blood
I see a couple thugs with some bitch tendencies
My town, but I still got Phoenix enemies (yup)
Haters wanna stop 'em and I really wanna pop 'em
But it's hard to fight back when you got an album droppin (connects)
We in South Phoenix, niggas Africa bang
Matter fact, Chris, tuck in your Africa chain (what?)
Cause I see some niggas starin at us with a lame frown
I'mma call up the homies (it's about to go DOWN)

[Hook/Outro: Ludacris] + (Willy Northpole)[Aaliyah]

Yeahhh mhmm mhmm

[Intro: Rick Ross]

You know sometimes in life shit is so crazy
I wanna smoke one for my nigga peanut
That’s my brother forever nigga I love you nigga
Your son is mine nigga
Let me check this bitch right quick though

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]

Been through a lot 9.0 times it gets cold
Doing bad had you take dope up the road
Had a situation where she kept it G as fuck
Sometimes realer then the niggas that I trust
Running in banks, walking out stores
Anything that I needed signature she would forge
Fucked up her credit overdue rental cars it was all 50/50 in this lil thing of ours
Girl used to lace me shoplifting at Macy’s
I just loved that fact that she really did embrace me
Then she started dancing really didn't faze me
Started popping pills that's when shit got crazy
Money come and go but the trill will remain
When this rap shit pop I told her that I never change
Have been stacking change and I gotcha a lil' cut
When we meet again girl we can live it up

2 x Chorus: Ne-Yo

(Ooooh) And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my, (Ooooh) just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together (Ooooh)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

Smokin' weed looking at your picture on the wall
I remember hittin' licks then we both hit the mall
Talkin' new kicks, Cologne, down to The Drawers
Raised like brothers but this dope game flaw
Things that I saw really made me wanna change
This a shame what 5 dollars do to niggas veins
After graduation best friends parted ways, fuck house parties
Now it’s time to get paid we were movin' white
While my niggas touchin' the H
We were still broke but money was on the way
Shit were goin' great til' my nigga caught a case
DNA matched a homicide back from '98 fucked up plans incarcerated my man
Took his Lexus Jeep Diamond Rings of his hand
Damn, but you can't take a real nigga legacy legends live forever
So my letter reads

2 x Chorus: Ne-Yo

(Ooooh) And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my, (Ooooh) just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together (Ooooh)[Hook]
She loves me, she loves me not
I can't tell if she's down or not
Oh, you like me?
What the hell does that mean?

[Hook][Hook: repeat 4X]
Buck on them niggas who hate, who wanna be in my shoes
Live my life but can't carry my weight

[Verse One: Freeway]
Uhh! From Philly to B-More Free
Deliver roast off the whip like a grown man and
Grab they weight take it back and forth
Similar to Chris Storm, my life goin up and down
Caught up in traffic again, long as there's change involved
You can count most of us they stand for the word {?}
We rat-a-tat-tat-tat to your thongs, put your homies on a stretcher
And we leave your homies naked to make sure you get the message
Dog - it's fucked up, I get some bricks from the 'Ricans
Couple pounds from the Jamaicans, got some Haitians that I'm eatin off
Long as, I'm on, time with the paper
They on time, with the package, I'm on time, with the 'matics
If you tryin to take the paper, we tryin to get this paper
We ain't scared to make the papers we will let you niggas have it
Dog - uhh, we got connects, like The Wire
To connect you to the wire your new diet'll be applesauce

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Mully Man]
Yo it's me again, same kid from Bentalou and Riggs
Used to stay catchin drama under Lafayette Bridge
Food stamps help us keep a lil' food in the fridge
Ribs touchin like {?} so you know what I did
Bought 'em more to the heart, wanted more from the start
Tryin to fix broken promise 'til it tore me apart
Just a lil' kid in a Harm City episode
The Wire's just the half, you will never know
What's really good in the hood with the grammar
John Henry verses, the machine with the hammer
Too many niggas that I love in the slammers
Sleep by the block-o I, D by them cameras
So from this day, dough we done it this way
From, oh so long we now become strong
With this verse I took the curse, of the city on my back
In the, name of the Lord I put my life on that
Let's go

And I don't make it rain, it's a hurricane on the way (ha ha ha)
And I got the A-Town pump
It'll make your whole body do the A-Town stomp (woo!)
Then it's off to the Waffle House
And pancake mix ain't the only thing comin out her mouth
And her 42 D's comin out her blouse
Her baby daddy comin in (Game, get out the house, and)

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Yeah, I'm in a real-life movie, so this is take three
When Luda step foot out in Phoenix, A-Z
Superbowl super hoes, rappers on stroll
So I put the call in to Willy Northpole

[Willy Northpole] + (Ludacris)
Woo, big homie I got ya, stick to you like a cactus
Walk up to the 'burbs city Chris take off your jacket
I know you kinda used to big booties in the club
But ain't nothin wrong to have a lil' sauce in your blood
I see a couple thugs with some bitch tendencies
My town, but I still got Phoenix enemies (yup)
Haters wanna stop 'em and I really wanna pop 'em
But it's hard to fight back when you got an album droppin (connects)
We in South Phoenix, niggas Africa bang
Matter fact, Chris, tuck in your Africa chain (what?)
Cause I see some niggas starin at us with a lame frown
I'mma call up the homies (it's about to go DOWN)

[Hook/Outro: Ludacris] + (Willy Northpole)[Intro: Clinto Sparks Talking]
Ladies and gentelman
My name is Clinton Sparks
His name is Mike Posner
Say hello ladies

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Goodbye to the old me
Goodbye to the minutes n seconds n hours
Hello to the new me
I like how this feels

[Hook: Mike Posner]
So close the door
Close the door(hey)
Close the door
Close the door(hey)

[Interlude: Clinton Sparks Talking]
You know something
You know what feels good
If feels good now a days
When I walk into a store
And the lady comes up to me and says
"Let me show you what's on sell"
And I look at her square in her eyes and I say
"How about you show me what's not on sale?"
Lady this ain't '97 anymore
This the new me
Matter of fact, let me buy you a better looking outfit when you talk to me
This ain't when I used to live in my truck
Trucks live with me now
Look at my house, they hang all around my place"
Oh it feels so good
I wish I could express how great this feels
Talk to 'em Mike

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Goodbye to the old me
Goodbye to the minutes n seconds n hours
Hello to the new me
I like how this feels

Got her in the palm of my hand like remote controllers
Running through that green like mowers, throw money like I owe her
She say "what's the hype about?"
I guess I'mma have to show her, yeah
Walk in the spot like we running the town
She drop it low till she's touching the ground
Shaking it for me, I'm throwing this money and making her love me
I'm shutting it down
Mike Stud, yeah that's me ho
Do the breaststroke with your bitch, but we ain't finding Nemo, no
Clinton hit me, now I got Clinton with me
Probably why I got all these pretty bitches sitting with me, getting with me
Giggity, giggity
Now I'mma make history, high as Yosemite, got an epiphany
Let's sippity till we get lit like a Christmas tree
I'm on a roll, ho, moving in slow-mo
My life is crazy, yours like J.D., it's just so-so
Now the things I used to dream about are finally getting realer
And if you ain't know about me, you should probably get familiar

[Outro]
Look at that, in them jeans
She a dancing fiend
And she can drop it low like she dance for Ester Dean
Girl just do your thing
Bouncin' it, bouncin' it (x3)[Jim Jones:]
Who's in charge? I'm asking y'all
Somebody better answer before I blast at y'all
Live life just as fast as y'all
But you little niggas know that my cash is tall
New York like Stoudemire
You think your hot, well I'm on fire
The money wash up and I'm tryna dry it
If a new car drops, then I'm tryna buy it
Cam front, kinda tired
Had a bitch last night, left her in the higher
At the party, music loud
(?) move the crowd
Then we Clinton Spark 'em
Damn right, let my niggas chalk 'em
All my dogs bite, we gon do the barking
And the money speak loud, we gon do the talking
And what you do with the bread
U went to the ghetto and tell 'em Su Woo bred
And I'm sorry to say, lift the back now home boy the 'rari today
Such a horrible day
(?) Bouquet
Married to the game, I don't need no bouqeut
Just a new whip and it got her to pay
So I tell 'em touche
Go nigga, Go
Rozay mo'

With a bitch on my side with some hips like woah

[Hook:]
Lemme see you hit the floor (c'mon)

Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Tonight I'm gonna be your favorite DJ

[Bun B:]
Lights is flashing, cameras filming
Soon as we walked up in the building
Bopers fainting, haters kneeling
I smell like money, look like a trillionaire
And I really don't care how you feeling
Big-faced hundred dollar bills I'm peeling
Bottles stacked up to the ceiling
And I just can't explain the feeling
Fellas, put your grands up
Ladies, put your hands up
We sipping Jimmy Neutron, player, and I can barely stand up
R.I.P. to the Pimp, you know I rep for UGK
Get 4 million with Clinton Sparks, your favorite DJ

[Hook]

[Game:]
Hit 'em with the punchline, hit 'em with the bass
Blowing that orange kush all in my face
Glock on my hip, nigga, murder was the case
Any nigga want drama, boy, I hit 'em with the 'K
Nigga act cool, nigga, hit 'em with a J
Swim in that pool, Pat and Ryan all day
Nigga need work, I got birds in the safe
Ski mask in the cut hand, keys to the Maybach
Where you lay at, bitch, I scope I never miss where I spray at
Underground King, nigga, UGK that
You should try crack all night, all day that
Tell me where the weight at
ZipLock baggies all in the trunk
Going through the zone blowing that purple stunk
It's the critics, get it?
(?) only got straight A's in physics
Dope boy business, Dope boy flashy
Chains on my neck, elbows still ashy
Hood nigga for real
Ask my nigga Pharrell
Turning my fingers on, the boy is the raw deal
Chicks all dimes, the motto is cash peels
Each one of them off down in Louis Vuitton heels
Tell 'em muthafuckas that the legend is real
Sleep next to a dime that I wake up to a meal
House on the hills
Where Hurricane lay his head at
Anywhere in the U.S., that's where I get my bread at
Nigga play the 9 by my waist, where the lead at?
Anywhere that I shoot, same spot nigga dig that?
Yellow take nigga
Clinton Sparks on the California quake nigga
When the light on, quick to kill a fake nigga
Cash Money in my pocket like the Drake nigga (nigga)

[Hook:][Intro]
Yeah

[Hook]
You want this money (Yeah)
Come take it from me (Yeah)
Won't stop at nothing, you're a gold gold rush girl
You chasing paper (Yeah)
You almost famous (Yeah)
Forget them haters, your a gold gold rush girl

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
You can have the ho
Got her in my phone no panties on
When she leave me she going to need a perm
Throat lozengers and need a comb (Truuu)
Kick sense in the material
I'm fly, I'm aerial
If you a centerfold I'm like here we go
I pass it to my dog like a give and go really though (Gottem')
I'm bout this paper (I'm bout this paper)
What you been thinking? (What you been thinking)
She like my head the one below my navel (Oohh)
I'm living major
And you a hater (You)
You hating this appearance
Because they major

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Yes you are (Yeah, yeah yeah)
Yes you are (Yeah yeah yeah)
Yes you are, Gold gold rush girl

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Allright
Dolce Gabbana, Prada, Ralph Violet
No nada won't holler
Going in for my pockets
Gold digging in my wallet
You better holler at Ross
I'm not copping them all, I'm still shopping at Ross
Still tryna spend a little bit of Mark Morrison
Return of the Mack, then break that ass off
Give me some Keith Sweat, ease back go off
Dry humping that kneecap till they scream last call
She starts chugging some vodka
She thinking I'm Ryan Gosling
These type of girls are crazy gotta watch them
Wanted Denzel but ended up fucking Waka
I step out the Eldorado
I know you don't love me you just love my poncho
My girls back at home posted up at the condo
Doesn't mean that we can ménage though
Let's go

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Baby you can wear my chain
You can take your picture by my car
All your friends can drop my name
Cuz tonight your going to be a star
(Yes you are)

[Hook][Hook: Bob Marley]
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'[Verse 1]
Sometimes when I'm in Heaven
I get forgetful of the Earth, woah
Until I hear you bickering like boys and birds
The heat is on
Bakes up when the sheet is down

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun

[Chorus]
Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

[Verse 2]
I've got the skyline in my veins
Forget your night times
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel
And joke us, joke us
'til Lakeshore Drive goes back into focus
I just wanna come back to life
Spark until you hit or give your woman love

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][x4][Hook]
Look at us now, look at, look at us now (x4)

[Intro]
We the ones you see up on them billboards
And we the ones that's buying things you can't afford
And I know it fucking kills you, but you gotta get familiar

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Just think of all the times you wasted hating on my grind
You put respect and work into it, but now you're so behind
Look at you, you fucking loser
I'm so awesome, how much did that cost?
Don't worry man, you're future's looking blurry man
You get halfway to where I am, you just better hurry man
Cause I show no signs of slowing down
When I'm in the spot, you know it's going down
Wheels up, about to leave the ground
When I'm in the UK, [?] make sure I get paid in pounds
Hit me when I get back in
Don't want a handout, then what the fuck you asking?
I remember back when you said I was whack and constantly you bashing
But now you know I'm smashing, and you trying to get your ass in
[?], but inside I'm just laughing
You go and talk, but I know the real reason
I got a cold, man, and this is "fuck you" season
Do me a favor: just ignore me when you see me
I ain't handing out no freebies, if you turn on your TV then you can

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Wow, look at me now
Check out my style, look how I get down
Wow, look at your girl, she checking me out when you ain't around
Wow, look at her smile, she talking about dome, I like how that sound
Wow, look at her now, she open her mouth, I watch it go down
Mmm, ah, USDA
That means upside down always
My niggas pull up a whole bunch of Audis, y'all niggas pull up a whole bunch of Hondis
I make the styles, y'all niggas just copy
Mmm, ah, watch 'em just jock me
Knocking 'em out like I'm Rocky
Swallow the lead like Gaddafi
[?], swag like I'm Kriss Kross
Copped the coupe, took the lifts off, dropped the top then dipped off
My girl's foreign like Joan of Arc
Keep two of those, like Noah's Ark
And that's cause I ball like Michael Jordan
You niggas more like George [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]
Now go and drop it lower, this is how I get to know her
Got her in the palm of my hand like remote controllers
Running through that green like mowers, throw money like I owe her
She say "what's the hype about?"
I guess I'mma have to show her, yeah
Walk in the spot like we running the town
She drop it low till she's touching the ground
Shaking it for me, I'm throwing this money and making her love me
I'm shutting it down
Mike Stud, yeah that's me ho
Do the breaststroke with your bitch, but we ain't finding Nemo, no
Clinton hit me, now I got Clinton with me
Probably why I got all these pretty bitches sitting with me, getting with me
Giggity, giggity
Now I'mma make history, high as Yosemite, got an epiphany
Let's sippity till we get lit like a Christmas tree
I'm on a roll, ho, moving in slow-mo
My life is crazy, yours like J.D., it's just so-so

Get familiar - Clinton Sparks dunn, whattup dunn?
Get familiar dunn

[Verse One: Havoc]
Hav' spit it, Hav' live it, Hav' pushin it to the limit
You a gimmick get the shitted smacked out you in a minute
I'll bend and scoop you up where you pivot, the four-fifthed
Or get it, when your monkey-ass pass the line of scrimmage
Reinvented for, harm intended until the endin
I ain't runnin even if the illest repoitoire's mentioned
My weapons ain't like yours, my hammers don't wet doors
I come through blocks nigga, set your shit off
The streets and them gloves don't, ever come off
The strong overcome the weak, accept the loss
Mami run to gangsters, she lookin at a boss
Homey front there'll be bodies more
Cause those in my cross you gonna get it catch you in the club split it
While you drink and get up on them Jacob, your man's weapon
AJ feel the new Mobb, your worst nightmare
Trucks wrapped in Kevlars, bitch

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Mobb, Deep, Mobb, Deep
Yeah okay dunn ('kay dunn) 'kay dunn
Mobb, Deep, Mobb, Deep
Yeah okay dunn ('kay dunn) 'kay dunn

[Verse Two: Prodigy]
Aiyyo word to me, niggas got so much beef
That when you come out, you better bring the police
Better keep one in the head, and turn off the safeties
Learn how to sleep light cause we break in
And tape up your kids and your relatives
Get on some ruthless shit I need sedatives
To calm me down, wind me down
I'mma find you even if it take months on the stakeout
We hittin the club, we out and about
We bound to see you homey, walk wit'cha gun out
Industry nigga, you just like a chick
With her nose up, I squeeze on you and if you live
Dunn... it's over
We comin back, for more of that bullets
And that murder, it be a wrap for you bitch-ass
Infamous Records, Clinton Sparks

[Hook] - 2X[Hook: Memphis Bleek]
Sawed-off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin that Arme', puffin on a blunt
All I know is my shit better bump
What? La la la la la-la la lahhhh (yo, yo)

[Verse One: Memphis Bleek]
{"Memph' Bleek always smokin that +La La La+"} You right
Groupies they be actin too crazy, tell 'em they too hype
They want leave with a G like Eas'
Educated the bullshit, got a degree in these streets
But, I dare a nigga act all crazy
The Tec'll tear his back all crazy
And you know I stay bent off the Arme'
Regardless if solo or I'm deep with my army
I rep, straight from the jacked M-P
If I put the Tec up I gotta tote the D.E
But wait! You know I'm ridin with Sauce
And we ridin this song from out the Robb Report
Dawg, I'm from the street, from the best I'm taught
I'll get your man tied and lost, fuck the cost
Got a couple of my killers who stand by
And I'm G-Force stat' nigga, never fly stand-by

[Hook: Jay-Z samples]
"It's the R.O.C. Cafe - ya mean?"
"Memph' Bleek, Young and Mack - ya mean?"
"Get back - ya mean? Get clapped - ya mean?"
"Get back - ya mean? Get clapped - ya mean?"

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Beanie Sigel]
Mack keep the weapon drawn, see you niggas that rat
And keep them dresses on; it's gettin outta hand
Niggas takin a stand, pickin out they man
Liftin they right hand and snitch on they right-hand
What's behind that shit? You both push bricks
But you gon' make a statement, and sign that shit?
After that anything goes - the kids crack the bridge of they nose
I stand, react and live out in the cold
I'd rather die than be labeled a snitch, snake, rat or a bitch
I hate a D, but I know I'm a prick (uhh)
You fuckin lames in the game actin sweet, never came from the streets
Type to get locked and change your name to Shareef
It's fucked up when your team got a bitch on it
With bench warmers, you got bench warrants
Detective got a Tec with two prints on it
But you the only one who get arrested, and pinched for it

[Hook] + [Hook]

[Interlude]
I kinda wanna make an announcement
I'm not sure if it's too early but fuck it I'mma do it anyway
Joe Budden is officially on Roc-A-Fella
Holla back

[Verse Three: Joe Budden]
Oh oh, get familiar whattup!
Who you gon' tell boy, caked up, spend it well boy (ohh)
Talkin 'bout big faces like "Hellboy" (ohh)
Oh well, still get compared to rappers
Hangin onto another rapper coattail (nah)
Keep the punches, I'd rather get substance
Good knowin they get it from Budden
Good knowin they jackin from the guy (tell him) use his own style
Hang 'em and nail him down like "The Passion of the Christ" now
That gray thing I'm in
A red stripe is spaced like the 18 van
(BUT) And y'all don't wanna see Jers' (why?)
Cause it's full of them toys that e'rybody keep rockin on t-shirts
(Welcome to the uhh) 'Bout to cop the Crossfire
Cause e'ry time a truck stop I'm in crossfire
(And I) I been away y'all, handlin these court priors

[Verse One: P. Diddy]
Why do cats wanna hate on a boss, straight to Azor
Do petty shit that a coward'll do
Cop little toys like I should be proud of you
I got 2, one platinum one powder blue
Cop cars while you still rentin
Tell time from the Chapard{?}, Frank Mueller{?} or Million Mill Clintons
Platinum Presidential, to keep it simple
Half of y'all couldn't get into what I get into
I know niggas pressed to stick me, that's why I pack Glocks
That hold shots, nuttin less than 50
Niggas try they best to get me, I see you in the rearview
Switchin lanes tryin to get on same exits with me
Tryin to peep where I live at, where I sleep
Where my kids at, don't do that
I have fools with tools, where your kids go to school at
Where you break food, where you think everything cool at
Where you niggas get bricks at, take shits at
Count cash, take baths, fuck your bitch at
Who you niggas tryin to stick up? I have lions with irons
To pick up, your bitch, when she pick her wig up
I know niggas wanna see me shot, lean to the left
In the drop, holdin my chest, wheezin for breath
Can't see me goin out on no meaningless death
Y'all wanna stick me let me see if y'all can get me now

FUCK Y'ALL just don't wanna see me fly
YOU KILLED B.I.G., y'all niggas seen me cry
That ain't enough? Y'all wanna see me die?
What man say P.D. scared, he lied
Hate on me, cause I got the keys to the city
You wanna see me get Notorious without Biggie
See me without The L.O.X., say I ain't jiggy
See me without Ma$e, say I ain't pretty
Wanna dress in all black, ride what's mine?
Take my shine? Hate on the ball, straight 'til it's all?
Mad cause I got the total package and more
Faith in my shit, y'all keep hatin my shit
I'mma keep hittin y'all, in the face with these hits
I got the real Queen Bee, don't fuck with my bitch
And I gave y'all the blueprints on how to ball
But you niggas still pray for my downfall

[Hook]

[Verse Three: P. Diddy]
FUCK Y'ALL cause I'm bad and the boy get papers
Is it the looks, the wheels, the skills, the flavor?
House on the hill, hundred acres, no neighbors
You can't hate this 90's Lee Majors
I'm top pedigree, I show you what cheddar be
Auto-trey nigga as y'all DuPont registry
Gear I wear for whatever the weather be
Gators, the flavors, the colors my leathers be
You smile in my face but behind my back gossip
Plot shit, wanna get me shot to the noggin
Have Justin cryin, who got my pop hit?
Lyin, tryin to tie me to that B.I.G. and 'Pac shit
I can't, don't, and won't stop
And y'all, can't, so don't pop

[Intro: Rick Ross]

You know sometimes in life shit is so crazy
I wanna smoke one for my nigga peanut
That’s my brother forever nigga I love you nigga
Your son is mine nigga
Let me check this bitch right quick though

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]

Been through a lot 9.0 times it gets cold
Doing bad had you take dope up the road
Had a situation where she kept it G as fuck
Sometimes realer then the niggas that I trust
Running in banks, walking out stores
Anything that I needed signature she would forge
Fucked up her credit overdue rental cars it was all 50/50 in this lil thing of ours
Girl used to lace me shoplifting at Macy’s
I just loved that fact that she really did embrace me
Then she started dancing really didn't faze me
Started popping pills that's when shit got crazy
Money come and go but the trill will remain
When this rap shit pop I told her that I never change
Have been stacking change and I gotcha a lil' cut
When we meet again girl we can live it up

2 x Chorus: Ne-Yo

(Ooooh) And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my, (Ooooh) just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together (Ooooh)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

Smokin' weed looking at your picture on the wall
I remember hittin' licks then we both hit the mall
Talkin' new kicks, Cologne, down to The Drawers
Raised like brothers but this dope game flaw
Things that I saw really made me wanna change
This a shame what 5 dollars do to niggas veins
After graduation best friends parted ways, fuck house parties
Now it’s time to get paid we were movin' white
While my niggas touchin' the H
We were still broke but money was on the way
Shit were goin' great til' my nigga caught a case
DNA matched a homicide back from '98 fucked up plans incarcerated my man
Took his Lexus Jeep Diamond Rings of his hand
Damn, but you can't take a real nigga legacy legends live forever
So my letter reads

2 x Chorus: Ne-Yo

(Ooooh) And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my, (Ooooh) just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together (Ooooh)[Intro: Akon + (Pitbull)]
Oooo-oooo

It's my life I'm a do what I do and if you don't like it it's cool fuck you[Intro: Akon]
As life goes on
I'm startin to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I wanted to take this time out
To apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occured yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sittin home just wishin we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

[Hook: Akon]
I understand there are some problems
And I'm not to blind to look
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can apologize for bein wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryin to stay busy 'til you heard from dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a theif
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryin to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryin to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen gettin shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out disgracin my name
I'm just a singer tryin to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame

Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me[Verse 1: Clinton Sparks]
Hey girl, what you do?
Yeah, you knocked me down to the floor
The way you use your sex appeal
Yeah it makes me keep wanting more

[Pre Chorus: Clinton Sparks]

And the hold you got on me is strong
You control me with your ways
And I know fucking with you is wrong
But I still do it anyway

[Chorus: Clinton Sparks]

What can I do?
I’m just so caught up
And I can’t seem to get enough
Nothing I can do
When she takes her aim and hits me with that ultraviolet love
‘violet love

[Verse 2: Clinton Sparks]

You’re so venomous, how you set me up for the kill (for the kill)
And your sex is dangerous, I’m addicted to how you feel
And I’m so strong I don’t ???? up and I just can’t come down
Yeah you trap me in your web of ??? realise when you’re around


[Pre Chorus: Clinton Sparks]

Cause the hold you got on me is strong
You control me with your ways
And I know fucking with you is wrong
But I still do it anyway

[Chorus: Clinton Sparks]

What can I do?
I’m just so caught up
And I can’t seem to get enough
Nothing I can do
When she takes her aim and hits me with that ultraviolet love
‘violet love

You-u-u-u-u
Got that ultraviolet love
Yeah, You-u-u-u-u
Got that ultraviolet love

[Verse 3: T.I.]

Listen, love
Hoppin’ off in the whip again
Ain't nobody better I should know I've checked
How yo rock them heel’ when you wearin' that dress
Them bitches can't win, they no contest, god bless em
And there’ no place I’d rather be
Than on top of you or between your knees
And I gi’ you my salary
Just to see you smile for me
You like it, I know
How I always up at yo’ do’
And if you cold you can ha’ my coat
I keep her wherever I go
And I go so hard I can't deny
That pussy do ??? like porcupine
If I can take that, throw it up in the sky
That’ll be the very day we see the sun retire

[Chorus: Clinton Sparks]
What can I do? I’m just so caught up
And I can’t seem to get enough
Nothing I can do
When she takes her aim and hits me with that ultraviolet love
‘violet love
You-u-u-u-u
Got that ultraviolet love
Yeah, You-u-u-u-u
Got that ultraviolet love[Intro]
