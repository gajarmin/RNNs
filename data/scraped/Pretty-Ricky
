I wanna kiss you from your temple to your feet
To the dimples in ya cheek, to the middle of your g-string
Conversation underneath the sheets
You know me, Red Bull like a energy, I'mma freak

Baby girl said she love phone sex
Say the sound of my deep voice make her wet
You call me five a.m. on the dot
Now I'm thinkin' bout you with panties no top
Picture this, you say you comin' over
Thirty minutes later you was parkin' the Rover
Jumped out the car and I met you at the do'
Three seconds in the house and ya panties on the flo'
Kiss you on ya mouth and ya hips on my cheeks
Straight action on the carpet, rug burns on my knees
Now you on the phone like damn I made a mess
Got my hands in my pants man I love phone sex

And we ain't gotta make love (Yes, sir)
And we can just cuddle up (Yes, sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (Yes, sir)

[Verse 1: Baby Blue]
Don't know why but the ladies call me Baby Blue
The sticker, they take me and rape me
And make me their victim
I leave 'em, the freaks
But if they married, I stick 'em
And if they look like wifey material, then I keep 'em
Stunning through the city trying find a lady who's beautiful
But she gotta have booty too
Baby Blue don't let you do what you wanna do
You can feel on it if you really want to
Get a taste of this salami
Knock, knock, knock, knock you down like a tsunami
Busting you like a tummy
I'm ahead of my class
Getting head in the Jag
Look in the duffle bag
See Benjamin's head on the cash

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Spectacular]
Yeah
Top down
Blue star tag
Spectac wit the back chick in the back
Tryna beat it up like a everlast punching bag
Hotter than a bisquit biscuit out the oven
Yo babymama go on missions to get this loving
We kissing and hugging
She never picked the phone up
You be looking for her while we be doing the grown up
She complain when she catch back spasms
But she loves when she get back to back orgasms
Yes, sir the game is off the map
You give it to them one time and they come back like addicts

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slick 'Em]
Well let me step up in this thang

Looking good, smack it baby
Pure pleasureful (That's all we got)

Pull up in the parking lot
Grab a grape soda, a bag of chips (That's all I got)
Park outside
Met up wit my homeboys
Fake guys, fake girl, leave me alone boy
Plus the Cadi looking good enought to eat
You can tell by the way the girls acting across the street
But on the other hand, Alfapha just hit me on my metro cell
Party in the park

So I jumped out the white Jag smooth like Shaft, come here girl

Get ya right by the end of the night
Do something sweet

And put Pretty Ricky cd on repeat
Then get a ice cream and put in work
Go to the kitchen for a lil' dessert
I love butter pecan ice cream
Eat cake but I lick off the icing
Nice scene and relaxing
I'm guaranteeing satisfaction
Give you fast or slow back action
Depending on your reaction girl

It's seven in the evening
And everybody's leaving
I decided to stay in
I just felt like chilling
And I wandered if you felt the same
Just say the word, I'll be on my way
I'm just a few, few blocks away
I just wanna see your pretty face

[Chorus]
All I'd like to do
Is lay with you tonight
I don't wanna hit the club
I wanna lay ya
(And when I come over)
I'll get you right
(I will)
Get you right
(I will)
Get you right
We can do anything that you wanna do
And before I go home
I'll get you right

I pictured me holding you
I pictured you holding me
We can watch a movie girl
I just bought some brand new dvd's
And I wandered if you felt the same
Just say the word, I'll be on my way
I'm just a few, few blocks away
I just wanna see your pretty face

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When I leave my house
I hope that you'll be looking for me
And you'll be waiting for me
Cause I will
I'll be speeding on the way
And when I get there
I'll get you right

You called my phone and told me
"Baby come through"
I said unlock the door
And I'll be there in a few
Brought "Love and Basketball"
And ordered some food
Now it's time to do
All the things that you wanna do boo
Open the door, look it back
And head into the room
Pop in a movie, hit the lights
And lay next to you
Cuddle under the covers
Kissing and hugging
While I get you right
Forget the club and going out
Baby I'm spending the night

It feel like heaven when I'm with ya
Baby I just wanna chill with ya
Spend some time with ya
Wine and dine with ya
My mind painting a beatiful picture
Me and you spending cutie
On the low key, baby we overseas
Knocking boots like H-town

You got me feenin' like Jodeci
This is where I wanna be

Everywhere I go I got your picture

My buddy and kid sister
You and me
Get down like 2 slacks on the side of the street
First I gave my heart
Then I gave you the key
Then I stepped up to the plate
And gave you all of me
You had me fallen like some leaves in the summer
You had me fixen things like I was a plummer
You do the math, man around the house
I did it all for you, baby what you talkin bout
I started out talkin to your best friend
Next thing I knew you was my girlfriend
Now I got beef wit your ex boyfriend
But its all good because, your my baby
It ain't no problem baby blu can't solve
Cause I relieve headaches without tylenol
With you on the sideline, ya boy gon ball
I'll give you my all

[Chorus]

I know you used to me being slick and slimy
Comin home late
When Im with the boys I'm shining
Baby girl, whats wrong
We started like a nappy head to a ??
One minute I'm dead, the next I'm gone
I gave you a shoulder to lean on
A team to be on
I got your head spinning like a bottle of rum
Let's get it on
Beat the ?? while I'm in the zone
Im ready to come home
To see my queen on the throne

[Chorus]

I really want you baby(want you baby)
I need you in my life(in my life)
I got to have you honey

Girl I want you like the new J's
Your sweeter than candy
Your fine like wine
Girl your one of a kind
So fine, I think about you all the time
Your always on my mind

[Chorus][Pleasure]
See the lust in your eye
I know you can't hide it
And your walk and your vibe

[Verse 1: Baby Blue]
Don't know why but the ladies call me Baby Blue
The sticker, they take me and rape me
And make me their victim
I leave 'em, the freaks
But if they married, I stick 'em
And if they look like wifey material, then I keep 'em
Stunning through the city trying find a lady who's beautiful
But she gotta have booty too
Baby Blue don't let you do what you wanna do
You can feel on it if you really want to
Get a taste of this salami
Knock, knock, knock, knock you down like a tsunami
Busting you like a tummy
I'm ahead of my class
Getting head in the Jag
Look in the duffle bag
See Benjamin's head on the cash

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Spectacular]
Yeah
Top down
Blue star tag
Spectac wit the back chick in the back
Tryna beat it up like a everlast punching bag
Hotter than a bisquit biscuit out the oven
Yo babymama go on missions to get this loving
We kissing and hugging
She never picked the phone up
You be looking for her while we be doing the grown up
She complain when she catch back spasms
But she loves when she get back to back orgasms
Yes, sir the game is off the map
You give it to them one time and they come back like addicts

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slick 'Em]
Well let me step up in this thang
Right, lookin, smelling good
Looking good, smack it baby
Pure pleasureful (That's all we got)
Let me drop my top
Pull up in the parking lot
Grab a grape soda, a bag of chips (That's all I got)
Park outside
Met up wit my homeboys
Fake guys, fake girl, leave me alone boy
Plus the Cadi looking good enought to eat
You can tell by the way the girls acting across the street
But on the other hand, Alfapha just hit me on my metro cell
Party in the park
Baby lets go
The block was thick no questions asked
So I jumped out the white Jag smooth like Shaft, come here girl

[Hook][Pre-Chorus: Pleasure]
Girl you make me say.. (OH)
Girl I make you say .. (OH)
You make me say.. (OHH)
Girl you make me say.. (OH)
Girl I make you say.. (OH)
You make me say. (OHH)

[Chorus: Pleasure]
Call me...if you need some loving for the night
Call me...you ain't gotta dial the number twice
Call me...babygirl I lick but don't bite
Call me...when it's time to turn off all the lights

[Verse 1: Slick'Em]
Call me
You can call me anytime, anyday
Cuz I like my women feisty baby
I'ma take ya on a fast ride of ya lifetime that's gonna drive ya crazy
You dealing wit duds
And tell you the truth they can't come close to me
I'ma a blue star babygirl and I'm built wit plenty of energy
But when it comes to sex, I'm a real women scholar
Just hit me on my sidekick and know yo boy gone holla
Got you reminiscing
His love ain't true
His love is fiction
I'm tired of sitting
Give me a call, I'll be there in a minute

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Spectacular]
Yeah
When ya home alone just hit my phone when ya lonely, girl
You so beautiful, I made you my tenderoni, girl
And I like my girl wit some meat and not just some lil' bony girl
And I do like bony girls but long as they not phony girls
Call me up when ya turn off ya lights
Might show ya a couple things that you'll like
And you ain't never got to dial my numba twice
Cuz I'll be there quicker then some minute made rice, so

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Baby Blue]
Yeah
Baby Blue
Whoa
You call me I'm headed up yo block tryna hit yo spot
Have that Victoria Secret on when you feel that knob
I see you peeping out yo window when you hear my ride
Open yo door and let me come inside (Come inside)
We can role play
I'll be a dirty cop
Headed up yo block, making it hot
Lock you up in some handcuffs
Throw away the key to the lock
I'm 24/7 like 7/11
Know we better stop we I hear you yelling
So call me, page me, I'm on the way depending on yo attitude, baby

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][Verse 1: Pleasure]
It's 4 O'clock in the morning
And she ain't feeling right
I'm on a first class trip
Through this place called life
I don't know what to do
Cause my body's still shaking
I know it's time to man up
And start my education
I need someone to call on
So I called on my bestfriend
I said "Bro, I can't take it"
He said "Boy, stop tripping"
So I hung up the phone
Packed my shit and got right
I know what I gotta do now
Be a man and face life

[Hook: Pleasure]
Maybe we could work it out
Cause you know I can't live without you
And everytime I think about it
I know a nigga can't live without you
Ain't no need to cry about it
Cause you know I can't live without you
I even wrote a song about it
Cause you know I can't live without you

[Verse 2: Spectacular]
At the beginning you was gone
I was staying wit my momma
I stayed getting in trouble, man
Straight damn drama
I started dancing so I stayed out of trouble
Cause I stayed in school, selling candy so my money doubled
But then you told me man, dancing was for punks
Then you told me come and stay
And you ain't care what I want
You told me come and dance and rap wit my brothers
You taught me how to love and how to care for my brothers
And then you taught me all yo hustlin' skills
Just in case I get alone I know how to pay bills
You told me I was straight regardless of a deal
And I love you man for that cause you always kept it real

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slick'Em]
Now that I made it, it feel real good
Take you out the hood
Put you on B and the block in the middle of the woods
And as hard as it seems, you was there for me
One bedroom apartment
On 1604 number efficiency down in Coverly
And even though I like to cheat
I'm going along my Geogria peach and that's a promise I'm gone keep
To the end, never gone blend
And I can hear you tell yo friends
And I can see you wanna buss and fuss with yo brand new Benz
To the world, baby it's yours
I'd give you the world cause you not no ordinary girl
I'm yo son, you my ol' girl
My momma, we shared for 19 years
And from the bottom of my foundation I'm telling you how I feel, and I love ya

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Baby Blue]
See, I fell in love wit ya
Wanna raise my kids wit ya
But you left me all along wit tears dripping down the picture
I remember the day like yesterday
May 9th, to be exact
I'd do anything to get you back
Even though I know you ain't coming back
I'm serious as a heart attack
Could we get it back the way it was?
Cause I know you had some outside influences that pulled a plug
The reality, Junebug, girl I know we'll always be together
I got you locked away deep in my heart, always here forever

[Hook][Intro: Slick 'Em]
Yeah........
It'll make you mad
Comin live from the 305...Whoooooo
Its what I do baby
This song goes out
To all my dope ridaz
My chevy ridaz
On them 24's with the spinning hubcaps

[Chorus]
26's on my chevy (my chevy)
Chrome on my chevy (my chevy)
Candy on my chevy (my chevy)
Blades on my chevy (oooh)
Dudes on my chevy (my chevy)
Girls in my chevy (my chevy)
Screens in my chevy (my chevy)
Shove in my chevy
I'm so hiiiiiiigh.....
I'm so hiiiiiiigh.....
Did I studder

[Baby Blue]
When I ride so high like my reams
Wit a pint of droe
Sittin on 24's
Matter of fact dat was a year ago
Now I'm ridin on 26's
It's yo boy you ain't catch me rollin
In the back of my seats man
6-4 when I hittin dem switches
? sittin on deep dishes
And five hit 'em wit the L-G get man
I'm doin number so don't try to screw me
? and I'm eatin up like Scooby
I got a pocket full of bread
A girl givin me head in the back row at the movies
Sell me yo Gucci
Please don't try to save me a seat wit yo Coochie
Excuse me
Sssssss ha I smell PUSSY
I never deal wit a ho who smell like sushi
I know you got to go trick, introduce me (now Blue you know you wrong for dat)
(Slick hold up)
I Baby Blue roll
Male gigalo, I get it on the low
Get out my window, reams glow
I ride slow forever flossin you don't know

[Chorus]

[Spectacular]
You can call me big 4 when I'm in my dome
72 chevy wit the shove in the trunk
Suede on the seats wit the suicide doors
Yea I like to make the dash board glow
Paint swelled up like apple pie
Say hi cause suicide all the time
2 seconds will get me from zero to six
You ain't pullin over then you betta come get me
Girls goin wild when I'm on the sceen
My seat belt must go seam stream
Bluestars stuck by custom glass
And you can hear dem pipes when I'm hit tags

[Chorus]

[Slick 'Em]
Now what you hatin for (what you hatin for)
Is it the chevy five (is it the chevy five)
On dem glass rims (on dem glass rims)
Wit the chromed trim (wit the chromed trim)
Da way I roll up (roll up)
Calm and laid back (laid back)
This here body droppin top

Keep smell of fear
Let's make it clear
These playa's ain't real

When I'm stompin in New York I wear my blue Tims
I'm a blue star, rapper not a singer
I got blue leather interior and blue power rangers
Blue diamonds in my grill, blue underwear
New blue socks, blue rocks in my watch
Blue air force ones when I'm chillin wit Nelly
Got girls puttin I love you Baby Blue cross they belly

Ain't no proof getting these chicken loose

Crusin round the block in a blue Bentley
With no show fa, keeping a costa, in a hosta

[Chorus]

[Spectacular]
Blue Bentley wit the blue rims
Customized wit the chromed grill
Platinum chain wit the blue gyms
Blue fitted wit the blue Tims
Blue stars to click the claim
Blue ice all in my chain
Blue panties comin off yo dame
Blue cards like a poker game
Chevy on 20's and I'm shinin
Hangin out my car cause I'm always clownin
Anything I see that I want I'm a buyin
And if I'm lyin, I'm flyin
Right now we got the biggest deal
Picture this forty mill
Keep 'em thinking that's how it is
So open yo mouth, show yo grill

[Chorus]

[Slick 'Em]
Give me a blue verse (blue verse)
Wit the blue skirts (wit the blue skirts)
Baby blue cut seats, got to make it work (got to make it work)
Blue diamonds in my teeth (my teeth)
Blue diamonds in my chain (my chain)
Don't like it, don't talk to the game playa

Now y'all can't mess wit a balla
Fine girls check boys, y'all know we got 'em

Baby, grind with me, relax your mind, take your time with me
I'll love you deeper if you grind for me
Now come and kiss me 'til your body gets weak
Just grind with me

[Verse 1]
When I grind, I make 'em say (Oh)
Slow grinding be my day (job)
I grind 'em in the back of my (car)
Keep it moving like a see (saw)

Cuddle a little
Kiss on the neck
Like girl, let me see that thing jiggle
Girlfriend, your body so (raw)

From the pretty, pretty chicks

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Light this candle, let me set the scene for you baby
Out the shower, so fresh and so clean baby
Staring in your eyes
I can see the fire
You're hypnotized
Can you feel the vibe?
(Ohhhhhhhhhh)
Staring in your eyes
I can see the fire
You're hypnotized
Do you feel the vibe?
[Step 1] You're kissin' on me
[Step 2] Girl you can let me softly
[Step 3] Now you see why you chose me
[Step 4] And ooh, you're vibing with me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Slick got more game than a little bit
Baby girl 5' 5", brown eyes with them thick lips
Thick thighs with the slim hips
Sugar, honey, ice, tea, baby girl so sweeeeeet, and a bag of chips
I like to catch her when she coming home
Like side, girl you know it's on
Looking good in a sundae cone
You got me hoping, no sugarcoatin'
Your tounge is stroking, no joking
Girl I'm focused, the bedroom smoking
Get some air up in this room girl!
(Heavy breathing)
If loving you is wrong, then I don't wanna be right
So I'ma take my time and do it right
Cause we got all night, cause we got all night
Baby girl just...
