[Verse 1]
Comin' with the meat cleaver, cut her in the neck, leave her
Put her on the ground like a beaver, see, um
Yeah, I'm comin' to get her, run up and get her with a machete
They comin' to get her without the liver, nigga
With a meat cleaver, leavin' the street bleedin'
He been a heat seeker, nigga, I speak ether
He 'bout to leak feces, wipin' up the streets with him, get 'em (Grr!)
Reminiscent of Waco, take hoes and put 'em in a box, they may chose
I hate 'em, cook 'em in Crisco and I filleted 'em and ate 'em
Filleted 'em and ate 'em, bakin' potatoes
Hot totty, stickin' a fork in a hot body
Hittin' the porch like a botched robbery
Not sorry, I'm the nigga hotter than hot coffee, nigga, shittin' with no potty
Mommy, tell 'em I'm a sicko, psycho, tell 'em I'mma hit the night though
Tell 'em I'm nitro, tell 'em I'mma growl like motorcycle
Wrappin' 'em up like a tight rope (Grr!)
My brain is empty, I can't think, I'm insane, I'm simply
Sick in the head, get in the bed, I'm a murderer
Mannibal, cannibal, niggas really never heard of him

[Hook x3]
He's a meat doctor, put her in the pot, made it hot, then I chopped her
I was floatin' in the air helicopter (Cocaine!)
Put butter in the pot then the hot sauce
Yeah, a lot of mothafuckers wanna talk soft
All shocked when somebody else Glock pop, and they layin' in a box
Mannibalector right up in the grass, Operation Foxtrot

[Verse 2]
Hey, yeah
I'mma get deeper, creepin' up in yo' backyard with a meat cleaver
Either, you and yo wife are 'bout ta get it
Shoelace, choke the neck, coke and ex
It's like open sex, broke the neck
Then I put a body in a back of the Lex
I got a bad habbit (Doin' what?)
Stickin' my dick in a corpse
Rippin' and pickin' a part
Simply gettin' a car
Yeah, nah, better do it, (Grr!) I'mma rip right thru 'em
Cut 'em in half, bloodin' that ass when I chew 'em
Choppin' 'em up then I get a brand new one
And I always love it, I just jack off when I'm thinkin' of it
You better back off I'mma heat the oven
I'm like Jack Frost and my teeth is ugly
You just that soft, but the beef is lovely
Reheat that shit, then I eat that shit
(Then what you do?) Then repeat that shit
Then repeat that shit, then repeat
That shit
Nigga, better let the cops know
I keep more meat than they keep at Costco's
They don't really want it, cookin' 'em up in a pot slow
I'm a mini Roscoe's chicken and waffles

[Skit]
Fuckin' doors locked… Hey! Oh, man, y'all come in. Hey. Hey! Are… Are you sucking your son’s dick!? Bitch you’re sucking your son’s dick! Bitch! You stupid bitch get the fuck out of my house!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I don't know, fuckin' around and put your brains in bowl
I'mma be comin' with it, insane in the dome
Thinkin' of murdering meat when I came in yo home
Mannibalector, three more dead, got blood on my necklace
These all said, I can eat it for breakfeast
Eat raw lead, then I put it on record
Cut niggas up, sector by sector
Next to her dead: first cousin and nephew
Next to her head, bloody intestines
Next to her bed, other intestines
The rest is history, it ain't shit to me
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is gettin' the meat
And I'mma eat
The next day get to creepin' on and I'mma beatin' on 'em
Next day Texas Chainsaw
When I eat yo brains raw
Come around a corner with a chainsaw
Cut some things off
And feed it to the fans while I'm rippin' the stage off
I'm on another page, nigga, rip that page off
Locc to da brain, nigga y'all just ate some
I'm the strangla, I'm like Adolf
Fuckin' around and get yo brains ate off
Cuttin' the town up and then made off

[Hook x3][Intro]
In a world of misery
Within this, three planets collide
Brotha Lynch, Dalima, Tech N9ne
Bring you along for the ride

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Wait a minute, I’m from the West Coast Conference
Like Kobe or James Worthy
You could just call me the King of the Valley
All I need is a game jersey
Nigga nuts and guts get served up
When I get it, I’ll spit enough, aim sturdy
Cut it up, gut it up, with colds cuts
And in a oven I’ll heat it up, came dirty
I be off’a that Crip tonight
Turn ‘em into liquid ice, stain his jersey
Leave ‘em in the back of the alcove
Like Helter Skelt’, stick it to ‘em like velcro
Nigga, I’m a bitch killer
I’m a dig a ditch, quick to rip ya
Paint a murder picture wit'cha
I’m a jack knife, strip ya that night
Split your legs open and dick you
But them quick into rippin’ your guts
Eat ya meat, Deep heat, deplete you with the meat cleaver
That I didn’t see you either
Phone call or receiver, court order delete you
Tech ordered the meat, I’m bringin’ the seasonage
And a suicide note, do-or-die Loc
Keys in the backseat, cut necks, I’m sexist
Bout to get him that Brotha Lynch Hung necklace
Expect this

[Hook] (2X)
(Welcome to my world)
Where hearts are broken, and bars
Are open, potions pullin’ me closer
(Welcome to my world)
Dark’s my ocean, my Ark is floatin’
But not livin’ like I’m supposed to

[Verse 2: Dalima]
(Lyrical asylum)
‘Cause I be Dalima, motherfuckers hatin’ me for the longest
Could it be critical ‘cause I’m lyrically flawless?
And if I’m heated I cannot be mentally cautious?
(Diggin' the pain) I get deep peepin’ the flame
Only can I be held accountable for makin’ the change
To whatever regards are gonna be (Insane)
In the middle of a stage, I’m bustin’ like a 12-Gauge
You can never bring it to a nigga that’ll hang you up
Slip a couple mickeys up in your drink for you
Homicidal with the fully-loaded rifle and undecided of
Whether or not I can cut up your brains or guts
(I get spaced out sometimes)
And it’s like I’m a heathen, whether or not you believe it
Everytime I rap a motherfucker stop breathin’
Have you ever been in a dilemma for a reason? (Nah)
Well, let me introduce you to the crucial upliftin’ future (and then)
Recruit you and seduce you to the mutual group of (My friends' souls)
Nigga you better get ready ‘cause
We done put together the fettiest chemical frame
Energetic when I let it, embed it in your brain
Tech N9ne, Dalima and Brotha Lynch like

[Hook] (2X)

(Dlrow ym ot emocleW)
(World)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Fight this phantom, your freakin’ family will fall flat
Bunk Bianca's beat ‘em black and blue with a baseball bat
I might be a small cat, but I won’t use discretion
Hit ‘em with a weapon, if he steppin’ with a mall rat
20 minus 11, I make ‘em all scat!
Not prosperous now, Tech’s not with his crowd
He’s lost in his clouds
Rather be off’ed than soft with his style
I got hopes that my life might get better
But I’ve been broke, so I might swipe your chedder
You better get ready to give me, I got a vendetta
Comin’ to get it, whether weed or money, whatever
Nobody said it was gonna be easy, people deceive me
Or leave me in the dark and buried off in Necropolis
One day you gon' see on me TV, you better believe me
Takin’ over this and never the opposite
Rewrite my life, gimme light, inner fight for what’s right
Allah Liberate, Cuidado
151 Rum is how we run from slim sums, then comes Diablo
I need a medic ‘cause I murder energetic
In the cerebellum never tell ‘em I got
One of the worst problems in the Medulla Oblongata
And you ought to go in one hell of a shot!
No more darkness, how did I start this?
Feelin' bizarre shit, like kickin’ your carcass
I am the ruler in my kingdom and my Dark Seat's hot
Step into My World and your heartbeat stop!

(Dlrow ym ot emocleW)

[Hook] (2X)[Verse 1: Godemis]
Pamet u glavu
Deevil!
Prayin' at 12:12 for hell, felon to sell
And slept on a bed of nails, like nothing I've ever felt
Ghost in a shell was molded with other demons
As if I needed some help or a host to preserve the heathen
Got it, my brain is rotted, I swear to God that I'm not it
I'm set to go to the gallow as soon as the rope is knotted
I ain't highest of high then the hydra have used adrenaline
Came in the cypher clean, still smelling like putrid cinnamon
Then I'm in, enemy of the state, I'm straight at an angle
Stop risking and quit your bitchin', it ain't like I'm raping a angel
Said I was magnifique, ya'll ain't fuckin' with it, capiche?
Not as safe as you would've thought with the devil under your feet
They throw a shot and then sit back and wait for some reaction
Ain't nothing to it but to do it, I'm a mummy rappin'
So get to clappin' or dissin' the clan you hatin'
Listen, the man is Jason and this is the Strangeulation

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Stevie Stone, I'm on it, I'm so clever
Nobody comparing, I'm better, I put shit together
America's most elaborate rap, pick ya head up, huh
Small talkin'll get you wet up, huh, yeah
I'm ready to kill all you niggas
The feelin', adrenaline that'll spillin' a mill
And yeah, I mill' all you niggas
Ain't even reach out they climax, rather my celing on niggas
And backin' a back, I'll backhand Billy you niggas
Get busy on niggas, this ain't no random some leakage
Stonie in the building, the bitches pull out their cleavage
The snake and the bat, you see them prominent features
The species, Strangeland, we rain on your region, huh
Meat wagon, I come, I be taggin' 'em
Baggin' 'em, bring 'em clusters of three, got three magnums
Gaggin' em out, you pussies is still talkin'
I'm draggin' 'em out, I'm tappin' 'em out

[Verse 3: Murs]
Aww shit, they fucked around and signed a backpacker
Smart, rich, handsome, plus he's not a bad rapper
I'm just a little local talent that fucked around and made it big
Underground bully, pickin' on all these famous kids
And the danger is, now I'm doin' stranger biz
About to make the world forget about what a major is
Independent Powerhouse, running all these cowards out
My enemies are all forgotten, wishin' I would shout 'em out
And I don't want to hear a rapper harmonize unless
He thuggish, ruggish, Lazy, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish or Flesh
But maybe I'm just hatin' cause my black ass could never sing
And fuck that autotune I hope the Futures filled with better things
And you a fucking liar if you say you found a better team
Impossible! Like trying to fit my dick inside my wedding ring
And all the bread it brings will be distributed and properly
I represent for hip hop not some fucking aristocracy

[Verse 4: Brotha Lynch Hung]
I'm the Martin Scorsese of rap, rap predator
Better than severin' the reverend with a jackknife
Kevin and eleven of 'em, revvin' up the engines
We bubblin' up like 7-Up, then when
We shoot that shit, we eat that shit for din-din, grrr
I don't need ya fuckin' okay, ah, are you serious? I'm okay
I'mma make you bleed like it's your period, period
I eat period pussy so eating you ain't serious
What, you need for me to flip that shit and rip that shit
Like a skitzo, stick that shit, that shit, like a automatic pistol grip?
No! I created this fast rap, I'm past that
I put a gat in that asscrack and blast that
I'm light years ahead of 'em, might use the head of 'em
I lose, then you can keep the breadcrumbs
Grrr, my nigga, I'm a carnivore
Ready for any kind of war, any kind of score[Verse 1]
I was a dead man, walking they say, so every night I hit the J
Load the AK and post up, in the window till come day, anyway hey
I feel the payback simmering in my brain
The thoughts of death cloud my mind
As my niggas is gone away many clips and 24 riches, packed
But who really got my back, fade
Now that them niggas done hit the grave
I'm killing them off for the old days
24 ways and a 24 sack of that purple kush'll make me sicker
Than sick and even get Ripgut Cannibal if you wish cause nigga
It's EBK everyday all day to the day I die
I'm creepin through your set with a mini mac 10 AR15
Rugga with a 12 gauge pump in the trunk and a black beanie disguise
That nigga that you can't see just cause of them bloccsta locs over my eyes
Crept like a black cat through the mack
With a mac10 on my lap and a fat sack of that shag
Took a hit of that shit and seen some niggas with a fo fifth
So I let 'em have it
Ounces of OE four-oh, those Indonesia split
And a 9 millimeter clip for the nigga that'll dump
And pump one in your bitch
And put her in her grave with that empty 40 ounce bottle and don't leave a drip
Then bounce to that ounce
In a 'llac and a mac and a fat sack of that Indo shit
I'm sicker than sick them niggas they gotta admit when I
Grab my shit you either gonna get caught with a hot one
Nigga so rest in piss

[Hook] (x4)
Just call me Agent Double O Deuce 4 Blocc
I got that 9 milli Glock and ready to put one in your knot
Rest in Piss (Shit)

[Verse 2]
From the reps of the depths of the double-O deuce four block
With a Glock in my pocket full of that cess
You better wear a bullet proof vest
When I'm at your set better pack you a tech
Cause I'm at your neck with a clip full of that shit
Nigga don't trip when I put one in your dick that Ripgut Cannibal Hannibal shit
Nigga nuts and guts all over my chest and stomach
Running to the 'llac threw my strap in the back
Twist me up a sack and I'm back at the Garden Block
Kicking it with maniac
The nigga that'll maim, react
Sicker than sick when a clip's in progress
Put 'em on the ground
With a brain full of them nine slugs, read him in Reader's Digest, Uh!
I found a new love trickling in my brain
Half of the doja
Half of the OE
Half of the fact that I'm that insane nigga
From the deuce four blockster
Where niggas never put their Glocks up
And get their cocks sucked nigga you just can't stop us
Locc to the brain insane with a main game that will maintain
Untouchable cut your throat and leave you in the street
With a lynch around your throat motherfucker
Cause you ain't got no love for the block
Pop! Caught a hot for that 24 street block
Nigga that took a shot rest in piss

[Hook] (x4)[Verse 1]
You better pray
When you see me put that nine up in that pussy, ho
Cock it back slow
Rock it back and forth, wait for the nut, then let my trigger go
BOOM!
Pussy-guts all over the room
If you ain't seen it
Then you're fiendin'
For the meanin'
Of that nina of doom
2 inches in and, uh, 4 inches out
You back that nigga that pack that gat
And hit that indo-sack
It's like that
Cannabis sativa got me stuck on stump, fool
All it take is a way, a fat green-bud blunt and a stunt
Cause it's that nigga that work 'em nigga deep
And block creep
And witness murder, baby, kill a seed
Once it'll make you vomit
Guts in a mama's baby, nuts in a bottle, maybe it's common
Biatches keep fuckin' and suckin' and keepin' it comin'
With they drama. POP! It's baby killa season
Put 6 in the clip, put it up that clit
And watch them baby's brains
Drip out that fetus
Bleed, it's that nigga that kill 'em
I'll fill 'em all full for that sicc reason
Season of da siccness broodin', got me trippin' for no reason

[Hook] (x2)
Guess what daddy's bringin' home for supper
Nigga nuts and guts and slabs of human meat, motherfucka
Now eat! Cause daddy's workin' hard for you, rilla
Killas run around everyday that's why I'm hard for you, nigga!
Now eat!

[Verse 2]
As I creep, picture every human that I see
Slabs of human meat cause my kids gotta eat
I lives kinda deep, dark, up in the cut
Where niggas load nines, and barrel-fuck a slut
Nigga, what? You ain't even seen me in my prime
Eatin' baby brains, baby veins, baby spines
I know they be cryin' when I'm cuttin' off the neck
I'm peelin' off the skin for some bacon-fried croquette
Baby villain spine, that baby-killin' mind
A fifth pint of gin cause I know I’m doin' time
So catch me now before I do my next crime
My kids' gotta eat, somebody's baby's on the line, nigga

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]
Get ready for the nigga shit
That siccer-than-sicc gut ripgut
Pick-a-vic-up, fuck 'em up with a couple of nine-milla slugs
And put ‘em on the ground with a tore-up mug
Slugs to the womb
Guts all over the room
That legion of doom
That S to the I-C-X
With a locc and a tech for the throat
And a neck full of gunsmoke it up, locc
One for the nigga who kills them infants and senses
Then this time, I hit 'em with a nine-millimeter, meter
Now let's pick up me freakin' up your skin
Never knew nigga-meat cooked so thin!
So I pack me a nine-milla gat
And creep in the back of the 'Lac
With a sack of the indo

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 4]
That's right, once upon a time
A nigga that hella sicc up in the skids
With a lie for the snitch
As a victim's stoned, sayin' "I'll be bones to the pussy clits"
They're a baby ditch to the mastermind
Nine-millimeter shells, they're blind!
Devils made a pact to fuck with match-to-heat, it's one of a kind
Low enough to the shit got hella deep that I had to patch it
To a soul who had the heart to put his mama in a casket
Who could it be?
Or can he be
Locked up in the county
Cause the bounty
Finally found a nigga like me?
X-to-the-R-to-the-A-I-D-E-D
L-O-C
What's up, my nigga?
Pull this trigger
And take my muthafuckin' legacy
But watch your back
Niggas be claimin' that they sicc
But really don't know which way to go when they be smokin' up with my lunatic
Shiiiit, have you ever seen your mama's cock? (Yeah!)
Have you ever seen a body drop? (Yeah!)
Have you even loaded up your Glock?
Well, I could gives a fuck cause even then, nigga, you not my nigga
From that 24 Garden Block
That's doin' time
For shootin' shadows up in the dark
And tryin' to bite before he bark
And when his heart stops
From the Meadowview Glocks up in the cut
They try to lynch my muthafucka to make some dice up out his nuts
And what the fuck goes thru my nigga's mind up in his cell?
That 24 Deep, no sleep, much stress, nigga
Nigga must be livin' up in hell
And here I am, same muthafucka that got my nigga sicc
Tryin' to kill myself but slippin' more deeper into the siccness shit

[Hook][Intro: Tech N9ne]
Aww, dwaamn!
Do y'all realize what y'all done did? Hihih!
Y'all done opened up a can of sick-ass
And I'm about to eat y'all quick-fast, hey

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I've been hibernatin' in the deepest darkest part of Necroplis
Now that I'm poppin' it's top, yes I'm the opposite of monogomous
Minage I get offed with it in this box a bit
Hostile its gotta get twisted n odd with this apocolypse
Holla it (Tech-Tech N9ne-N9ne shit, I'm lovin' it)
I'm a drug to this grudge of his, rip my covenant, I'll plug a bitch
Lovin' this mug is what the ruckus is, psycho thug with it
Fallin' down like Michael Douglas with the ruggishness
Addadamean, they wonderin' why did I bring this side of my dream?
The Nina's a horror machine, dollar for dollar, I balla for all of my green
Nigga, my name is Inigo Montoya, I got an evil plan for ya
And your about to get dropped, this box is worse than Pandora
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
They're all gonna laugh at you, cause I had to do what I had to do
When tappin' you like shaba do, beatin' 'em up and shootin' 'em up then stab a few
Sad ya knew that you had your crew and they ass are through
I'm killin' em throwin' 'em back at youL

[Hook] (x2)
That's what's happenin', Strange Music Box
Got us tappin' in, Strange Music Box
Bump then slap again (Why?), Strange Music knocks
Back up openin', Strange Music Box

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
See once they open my lid I'mma give it to 'em
Ever since I was a lil bitty kid I've been truly ruined
I reflected on what I did before I ran into 'em
I used to be a fat jerk now I flirt cause the scent of a woman
Now I don't act like, walk like, the nigga that you used to know
Now I sing and rap about the strange life, it's beautiful
Tell it to 'em like a Genu-is, spit it out like I thought you knew
Bubblin', hope you hear me Thizz, prayin' to God I make it through
Kali Baby, check my strange box of tricks
Kaliko alley cat, lyrical, watch his lips
He can go really fast, slow it down and stop that shit
Or make it (Dumb) to make sure you niggas got that shit
I'm just playin' with music, I'm the elite heat speech chief
Play me and watch they feet turn Beat Street
Cause I'm blowin' out they socks, The Freddie Foxxx of my block
Theres somethin' strange goin' on in that box, Kali Baby!

[Hook] (x2)

Seconds then his body is fricassee shit is bleedin you should see him or you can be him
I got dead human being in the freezer, I'm a believer
I ain't no Wally Cleaver but I carry a meat cleaver
I speek geek to people, I'm lethal, a little strange

I'm the Coathanga Strangla
Hangin' him up, he's fried rice, he tried twice
He's dry ice, tell 'em Tech N9ne

[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1: Zig Zagg]
Comin off that high it's that double-set rapped around some funk in the trunk

Watch my back, hit the dank, load the gat, make the grave
Twelve midnight, my niggas on the stroll

Chorus: 1X

Now that's my locc right damn, where'd you go folks?
Remember we're supposed to be the ones with brains this locc's
So nigga fuck it, i'll do it like your ass is dead

Somes I set the tags and name on the wall you fucking snitch
So you'll make a switch on how you're gang-banging
L-O-C and to the brain real locc's don't play that way

Chorus: repeat 2X

Locc to da brain insane every day all day it's E-B-K
Where niggas load they straps cause the rival's on the way

[Verse 4: Hystables]
See I was standing in the middle of a circle cuz' a nigga is trying to jack me
With a nine-millimeter ruger and a six deep posse
But I ain't going out for a jack move
The only thing on my mind
Is pullin my nine and these handles in these fools
Now tell me what you busters want with me?
They started talking about pockets on the ground you mean
Empty my loot out, you fools must be smokin' sherms
But i'll be glad to put my strap up in your face and let some gun powder burn
Now take a lesson from a Sac-Town criminal
I'm standing all alone in the street
And talkin shit to your circle and ain't no blastin y'all must be bluffin
Threw up my sign and grabbed my nine-millimeter nine
And started bustin on niggas and watching every muther fucker try to run
That locc to da brain got a nigga insane with a fucking empty gun
So I'mma continue to strike and stay alone and maintain my self-pride
Cuz' when I ride it's always locc to da brain

Chorus: repeat 2X

Locc to da brain insane every day all day it's E-B-K
Where niggas load they straps cause the rival's on the way

[Verse 5: Brotha Lynch Hung]
You can't see me for the fact that the inside of my strap's in your sight
Bout' to put some slugs in your throat and put your guts in my coat and hit
The night Drop a sack of indo in my pipe and it's
EBK everyday all day til the day I hit my grave-site
That locc to the brain cuz' it's all redrum
A couple of hits from the purple spliff
And I'm workin a fifth of the coke and rum
I have my twelve gauge-pump decorating niggas brains
Nigga nuts and guts is how we get sick them Northern Cal slayings
That locc to the brain shit ain't no game it's a gang

It's twelve-o-clock full of that spliff full of that ammo in my Glock-nine

Feel the breeze from the slugs in my nine now
Rest in peace

Chorus: repeat 4X

Locc to da brain insane every day all day it's E-B-K
Where niggas load they straps cause the rival's on the way[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Strikin' through the deuce with a 40 in my mouth
The nigga with the rep of atheismistic doubt
Rippin' the label off the 4-0, based on the fact
I got respect for my dead folks, props for my nigga locs
187's in the hood, I can't say shit
One-time thinkin' it was premeditated
I could eat a view from the deuce-fo' block
40 in my mind, makin' me think I'm gon' get shot
In deuce-fo' deep, the nigga with the sickness
A nigga with hella enemies, always cool and 86'd
Niggas from the hood ended up provin' they was a snitch
Fuck it, created the X-Raided, now I'm tryin' to get rich
Ain't that a bitch? That snitch, nothin', nothin'
Motherfuckers mad cause they can't make tapes
And I gotta get paid, so I can buy my 4-0
To live the atheist life that I was brainwashed to know
Niggas run up every day, wantin' to get some
I told them who runs the motherfucker flow and then some
Win some, lose some, like a nightmare
I got enough shit on my mind, I just can't care
I'm on the run, runnin' from who's-ever gun is aimin'
I'm all up in the middle of shit and ain't even claimin'
Tryin' to survive in the hood is hard enough
Cause them niggas already thinkin' I'm claimin' Creek Mobb
Trippin' on gettin' snuffed by the view, smoke in the Gardens
Stayin' out the creek, cause it's hot and hella hard to get
A dub up without gettin' caught, and them niggas know it
Drinkin' that 4-0 ounce, in case I'm shot, I wanna be drunk
And don't feel it, that nigga, that nigga that raised the shit
Raised a Crip, but really can't fade the shit no more
But out of respect, I just can't gangbang
I'm in it 24 deep, you got funk? Then nigga, slang

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Drinkin' while I'm sittin' in my room with the lights off
Voices in my head, tellin' me, "Nigga, that's fucked up!"
X is doin' time, so he can't get got, but now I'm
Livin' up in the deuce and I can still get shot
So I'mma slang 'em, slang 'em like a motherfuckin' half-ounce
Trippin' off the four ounce, the four to the fuckin' ounce
To the bounce, every gat, but I'mma still put some work in
Wearin' black in the deuce, a nigga lurkin', full of juice
Bought from the wretched, the X-Raided, settin' 'em flex
Waited, that nigga had to murder before he made it
Now he's doin' 30 to death row
He said he always wanted the devil to have his soul
Young nigga, I wish I coulda told him what was up
Fuckin' with the so-called devil will get you fucked
I woulda told him, that nigga, he killin' the bitches all the time
But never knew that nigga would murder and try to ditch a crime
I never knew, I heard of a nigga that snitched, but now the sign
Is every fool that deals with the devil is through
Me, I'm a psycho, me Mama might go ill when she find out
Her baby's makin' criminals, that nigga, that mic' man critical
That nigga that lynched, that critical criminal hinges on the loose
So whoever I knocked, you think I'm down, I got the juice
Now all I need is a motherfuccin' Glock, D
Up in the block and in the Creek, livin' 24 deep

[X-Raided's "Fuckin Wit a Psycho"]

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Droppin' it like this, sittin' in the crib, 12 o'clock
Half-lit, lookin' for a Glock, so I stop
By the phone it's ringin' and I wanted a gat
It's X-Raided, he made it to the hood, nigga, where you at?
That nigga said, "'Round the corner at the pay phone"
"I got the dank, I got the crew and the nine, loc, you know it's on"
Let it be known, I'm a motherfuckin' psycho from the deuce
And all my other niggas got the same juice
But when it comes to trustin' niggas, I can't fade it
Frontin' niggas like a game, so I played it
Half-dead fools got me gang-related
A new nigga wanna kill me every day, shit
For every nigga that pull a Glock on me
I'm not dyin', nigga, that's not gon' be
I keep tryin' to get myself up out this shit
But all the niggas I know still gon' be claimin' me Crip
I'm not trippin', whenever they want the flow, they go
My niggas all know the antidote'll be smokin' a nigga's dome
So until I die, that's how it's gon' be, in the blocc
24th Street, nigga, livin' 24 deep(Hook) (Doc)
Finally the sun went down in the hood and I was budded
Dice game and fat sacks a indo
Serviced with High Times and maybe
Rainy days blew me away, so I drank the 4 everyday
Matter fact it was a murder present
One-eight-six point duece that was ridin wit one-eighty-seven
(40 ounces and chronice dice)
Yeah, I stay high muthafucka

(Lynch)
On my briefcase is some crumbled weed
Buckshot shells from a dead body
Got a whole bunch a 40's and a couple a hoes
A '95 Fifty sittin on Trues and Vogues
Plus I had a nine in my glove compartment
Cause everywhere I go niggas love to start shit
Five pound chronic dice, in my mits
Fifteen teflons, in my clip
Heard about a lot a sick shit in the block, so
I stay locc to the brain and remain incognito
With my twenty sack a the bomb
Money back guarantee, if you hit that shit and don't wanna kill yo' mom
Got the clip, Glock, Chevy Impala that don't stop
Stop the Glock, no you can't the Doc from the gangbang nigga
So up goes yo' trigga
Stayin high off the sensamilla
And my nigga say

(Hook)

(Foe Loco)
So fuck it, rippin off ya forehead and down yo' cheeks
You in the ??? Doc shape cause I drop seven by you feet
And ya broke, my pockets on overload all day
Cause that eastside slangs 'em in effective ways
And amazing thang
Is the gangbang I'll come up off a crap game, fo' some mo' drank n dank
Then hits the 'Stang, where my frozen Ides is
Twist off a cap where my liquid suicide lives
Frostbitten from, that Crooked I, I'm lookin through
We get sick, Foe Loco, the mark eastside, ridin on you
He comin at me wrong, damn, we between the sheets?
Is suicide on yo' mind, must I leave you on these streets?
Raise up off me, but really realizin the strength
Had him readin', eatin' the serial number off his thang serial number on this thang
Peep the slug, toke the reefer, let the barrel meet 'cha
Mean mug in the center of the street and the reaper then

(Hook)

(Doc) (talking)
Yeah, and a special shout goes out to all the playas on the southside
It's a Garden Blocc thang nigga, stay rippin, know what I'm sayin
And everythang
Muthafuckin homies on the eastside, Foe Loco, Bugsy, Lil' Sky and shit nigga
Y'all muthafucka's handle that gangsta shit
And I'm out 'til the duece-nine, Garden Blocc, ride 'til I die
Oh yeah, FUCK YO' ASS SNITCH, you know who I'm talkin to bitch
Fuck yo' ass nigga, some brand new news a nigga picked up on
You never know who you can trust
Sometimes you can't even trust ya big homie
I'm out[Intro: Kutt Calhoun]
It's still real out here, niggas
Niggas is still active through these streets, man
I had to call upon my nigga from Sac-town
816 and 916
Yo Spidey!


[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung] (x2)
No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right
Better not be light cause niggas is out there for your life
Don't believe it, that's your problem, time to solve it
You can be the shooter, I be the one to get your jaw split

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm from where most people hardly reach adulthood
Poverty stricken vultures, look odd and they go approach you
Obviously a notion to rob you of what you holdin
Probably be them soldiers, can't spot em cause they cloakin, scopin
In them 501s, hawkin
Them red bandanas, fallin
Out the right side of them pockets
These niggas is bangin so watch it
You know them 5’s is poppin
And they say them 6’s is droppin
In Kansas City, no problem
To lift a nigga up with his choppin
When bullets flyin, they gone
If you ain't bout it, stay home
First 48 with no snitchin niggas get split when they run
Miss in your face now it's caution tape all in front of they home
Thanks to the street the next time they see you's at Laurs and St. Jones
With the rest of your relatives situations'll never get
Cool with time
Especially if you rep to the death of it
See the boys in that denim, them 51s be the reckonin
In the reality maybe a little crazy but definitely

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
We get the bullshit - 501 in this hood shit
Hoodies for Trayvon Martin the subertine and the dueces
You youngin niggas is stupid, so clueless to what you doin
Get out of it while you can, find a life to live and pursue it
It's nothin to glorify when your homie is chopped in two and
You gotta make up a lie so his family won't be in ruins
Niggas they been through it before you, know the end of the story
Ain't no fame in this business pour out some liquor to mourn you
Homicide on the daily, see your best friends in the paper
Obituaries and memories got a ride for the later
Ain't nobody alive so the babies
Grow up avengeful and now you got genocide in the makin
It's a cycle, we all assault our rifles with us
Wanna be MJ, and that's just how we all endin up
Dead too soon, before our time, we had to go
Ain't no escapin the inevitable so, that's all we know

[Hook][Verse 1: Slick Pull]
You don't ride delinquent
Roll with nothing but misfits
Grind all day, get my money in a stink pit
Or should I say a stink pipe, or should I say a stink hole
You going down fast, like you stuck in a sink hole
I'm at your door, no need to cover up your peephole
It's just me and the guns and a couple amigos
If G were here today, would holler hasta manana
Sooner or later, we gone be at your ass partner
I like to get it poppin', I don't be doing it talkin'
Walk in and push your belt like, Christopher Walken
All out war, but it started all over flowers
Now it's hit some broad dinner
While you cowards be bullet dodged

[Hook: Dead Mic]
High speed, in the fast lane
Ride hard, got the hustle in my damn veins
Stacks or racks stuffed in my Gucci bag
No rehab, I'm addicted to the damn game

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
I told Dead Mic got ya homie
Vet, couple choppers on me
WestSide nigga, where they're known to grow the best broccoli homie
Lookin' out for the drive-by, your man'll go missing
So I keep my neighborhood on lock like we landed in San Quinn
Yeah, these niggas know what it is
I'm in this shit for the long run
Stuffed Ts, khakis, and wife beaters with long guns
Where the color of your shoestrings, will send a nigga on one
Have niggas throwin' gang signs, shootin' trying to dome one
The respect's amazing, street cred. through the roof
I really did main line time, they said I'm the truth
Cause I ain't never whine
And I'll be dead before you others see me on the news
Tryin' to shed time, tryin' to fight crime
Nah, that ain't like mine
We had a lifeline
We still got niggas bouncin' back off nines and dimes
And get right back in that kitchen
Mask on, and back to whippin'
A fiend for the money, man this shit is so addictive

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Spider man, I still be creepin' where you sleepin'
And we can get to squeezing and start killing for no reason
But I'm steadily on this rap shit
No more selling crack, shit
Trust me I still pack shit
Nigga it's still the season
Of the sickness, get your dick split
Nigga this still crip shit
Spit that cocaine, I'm getting you mothafuckers addicted
Shit, I had it hard, like Vicodin with addiction
Cowboys and Indians, always was a misfit
24, 29, 21st, garden blocc
Yeah, we put Sac on the map, other niggas hardly not
Gurr, tryin' to help the young niggas out
We could only do so much, or pull triggers out
And if we don't sell, we going back to that other shit
Damn, I just ran out, C-Bo got that other clip
64 ridin' up, somebody about to get their dick split
Yeah I still love it nigga (love what?), it's so addictive

[Hook]

[Outro]
[C-Bo] a fiend for the money, man this shit is so addictive
[Slick Pull] grind all day, get my money in a stink pit
[C-Bo] a fiend for the money, man this shit is so addictive[Intro]
It's me and Snoop Dogg, Kurupt and Daz, nigga
(Another killing)
It's another motherfucking killing, nigga
It's another killing
We had to put this together, (another killing)
Just had to be

[Snoop Dogg]
They layed one of my homies down; two of my enemies
I grab the heat and creep up the street and squeeze
I'm in your neighborhood, so what the fuck is up?
And if I catch you I'mma pop you, nigga that's whats up!
We can talk about it, no, I don't think so
And I'mma catch you when your creeping with that pink toe
You trying to creep up out that mink store, get you a drink
So when I hit you, you won't even trip to think so
Cross your heart, double dot your eyes
Yellow tape you, make you a homicide
Stretch you out like a red bind
Halloween, is your dead line, beddy bed time
I zag your zig, I put a fork in the pig
I cock the Glock and pop you my nigga, you dig?
I open you up and leave you leaking by the face
In ghetto we ain't got no time to be catching no case
Too slick to sly plus I'm too high
I'm too fly and I do die, I do die
I love to shoot an intruder, I mix the purp with the budda
Love Chicken and Beer like the homeboy Luda
Big Snoopy D-O-Dub, I'mma killa cuz
I'm draped up like a steela of gorilla (dub)
Sacramento no, pedal to the floor
Anotha killing for realer, nigga let it go

[Daz]
We on the corner a hundred (deep), blue rag the fuck up
And word on the street they got blast the fuck up
Now it's feuding and shooting and I'm running your life
I'm in it for the stripes, nigga don't fuck up tonight
Bandana, banana-clips, ready to trip
You niggas is assed out, see you better not trip
I see some buster ass niggas at the bus stop out of bound
We bang the gang bang them niggas from The Dogg Pound
Trap 'em rock 'em and stop 'em we mashing
Everytime we see you niggas we clashing
D.P.G down with 24th Street
Siccmade nigga down with them 21st g's
(Motherfucker) Brotha Lynch Hung my motherfucking nigga

[Kurupt]
Listen to me
One for the flame, and two for the trigga
And three of these hollow point teflons nigga
When I came in this motherfucker I had a plan
I'll sock all you motherfuckers where you stand
I'm gang banged out, riders on a mission
You can catch fades, nigga fuck the pistols
Piranhas is loose in the septic tank
We do what you can't, I am what you ain't
Don't even try to provoke me cuz
Looking, smoking, slipping, smoke me cuz
I'll beat your ass on the low so fast
Bang on your homies, spread through your hood
Release these toxins like mustard gas
Scrape the chevrolet, it's all to the good
My nigga Brotha Lynch, Kurupt, Snoop and Daz

[Brotha Lynch Hung]
Nigga this is G block, trust me
Dump on any nigga with the rusty old trusty
Sacramento yes, catch him in the chest
Right by his tour bus left a bloody mess, yes
Pupils none a cuddy left
Coathanga strangled him, aimed at him
He don't know what angle I'm coming from
Tangled him, spiderwebs all over his cranium
(That nigga has spiderwebs all over his cranium, nigga)
Me and Crooked I know, niggas be talking too much
Nigga shut your pie hole, everybody know you do suck
This ain't a reality show, hungry niggas do touch
Mothafuckas two clutch, giving niggas who cuss
I got an army of niggas I'm "Strange" it ain't a rumor
We giving niggas brain tumors, hit 'em with the Luger
I'm doing the rapping and this nigga is the shooter
'Yay got a mask on but nigga he's a shooter
You'll never see his face on a computer
Spiderman Jr. Oklahoma chewmer
Poke a ho with two cuts
This motherfucker said he about to do what?
Get chewed up, its Dinner And A Mova' (Movie)
Deuce-Four, nigga[Intro]
Yeah
Fuck this shit
This shit ain't going right
I'm-a have to move like I used to move
This shit ain't cool
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about
Back home, you know?

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Spend money on drugs and drink, it's been funny out here
You looking for love? It ain't...it ain't sunny out here
Hit you in the tummy out here, that's how I live life
Never enjoying the cash flow but now my kids might
That's how I'm doing this, this shit ain't for you
Fuck the family shit, motherfucker, because you're in it for you, right?
I used to be in it to do right, but now I'm-a do it like I used to
Because night-by-night, day-by-day, I tried to juice dudes
And they got used to it, took a kindness for weakness
Before you met me, you niggas was heatless
With hella niggas to creep with, so you thought you was hard
You used to ride the bus, now you got you a car
Now, you flex-flossing, you know how it is when you're bigger than the next
You be the money-making nigga with a vest, always in a mess
Because it's the sign of the times, telling me "nigga, move on"
My desire for music is too strong, I'm Mr. Fucking Do-Wrong
If I got to drop you, type shit, and I deal with it as it comes to me
You nitwit, I rip shit, just as quick as I get shit
Slip shit all in the clips, this ain't no chunk-'em homie shit

[Hook]
On any given Friday
Why they wanna test me on any Friday
It's meat fry day
Got to have it my way
I got my own recipe because niggas wanna mess with me
Your chest will bleed now
[x2]

[Verse 2: Crookwood]
I'm like a white blood cell when I'm not up in the blood stream
Mean mug me, until I hit you with the red beam
Fake-ass niggas be bumping their gums
But we don't do that punk-ass shit where we're from
Because snitches and fake bitches get more than stitches
I got 16 switches for your motherfucking britches
I'm ghetto as fuck, I eat off of broken dishes
I'm not a genie but I can grant your ass three wishes
I flow through traffic like blood through veins
So, all that internet gang-bang shit mean a motherfucking thing
Trying to gain fame off the next nigga name
Rather write it on a bullet and put it in your brain
Now you know Phonk Beta gets all up in your pores
Stop fronting in your bricks while saying it's yours
Next time you see me, punk, you better bring your heater
Never really like your ass even back on Manzanita

[Hook]
[x4][Lynch Talking]
Art of War nigga, (nigga get in)
The art of war, (I know where he at)
Dedicated to the niggas
That feel they need to make a living off niggas
You know, check it out

[Brotha Lynch Hung]
I smell pussy push me, I got a hard dick for killin'
Go head and start shit wid the villain
And get your heart split in a million pieces
You need Jesus I can tell by your releases please
He suck nuts for cheese somebody grease his knees
If you suck nuts for a livin' trust me at least it's these
Lynch haul all up in ya mouth tryna release the steam
And you can rub it on like Visine
And you can dub it all in high speed and watch that bitch nigga scream
And it's nothin' it's no thing I hit the corner
You was lucky and nosy nervous at the corner
I woulda grabbed the body stabbed the body
Then cut the body up like meat and eat 'em ganja leaves
Grab the shotty and get away got away scott clean
So you grab the body I'm in the Mozarotti
Smashin' down I street, all the way from the jail house
Gave it a chance and then I had to bail the hell out
Tight shit but I don't wanna go through that
Sittin' wid my celly like, how did I do that?
See I had to leave 'em blue black, the fool's back
Wid spits like jackler when ya runnin' wid two gats

[Hook: scratching of these lines]
"There's a war going on outside"
"The way of life is the way of death"
"Coming from the thirty six chambers"
(x2)

[Cos]
Seems like I can't mash these days
Cause everybody wanna try to blast C way
Like everybody wanna pass these days
But talk shit about my click we gon' blast these K's
These niggas gay cats jay cats walkin' cross the street
When we see 'em I'm mashin' like we on a race track
These niggas way wack, they knew that since way back
That's why when you gave me your shit it got no playback
You niggas play rap, we be on that real tip
We in the Source mag, we gain the ill tip
And if y'all don't feel this, y'all must not feel shit
Don't buy that nigga album man he a real bitch
This nigga tryna make a dollar off my nig's shit
Don't talk shit to gain fame that's some ill shit
Come wid some real shit, and stop lyin'
Cause you ain't never shot nobody and copped a diamond nigga

Hook

[Brotha Lynch]
Slim love you well slim joke, you been broke
Soon as these Blocc niggas find out ya M-O that's all she wrote
Cause Blocc niggas don't fuck wid nut riders we rough riders
Glock 'til they call me the truck driver
I drive bodies down I-5 a, insane you's a damn shame
You don't sell a damn thang to hoes, here's ya damn fame nigga
See you's the same niiga that used to lick on the balls
And hum when I had 'em in ya jaws ask D-E
I wrap CD cases and put 'em on the shelf
I told you motherfuckas I'll gi' you a lil' help
Cause if I really had funk wid you, I wouldn't say shit
Just spray shit, come get you, ya done dizzle
All I gotta do is whistle and here comes the troops
Siccmade niggas stompin' in steel toe boots
We get paid quicker I know it hurts but it's the truth
Pretty motherfucka I take out ya tooth
Either that or watch the Uzi shake out the roof
How you want it?, like Burger King I'm murderin' and his woman
Trust me, it get tough out here
Motherfuckers could end up in a trunk out here
Can you feel it?

Hook"Is this what you want?"
"Nah! Nah I want cheese on it, like you always do!"
"Thats what I said!"
"Yeah, yeah. NAH! Nah, just look out the window, ain't nobody here."
[Phone keys pressed]
"Yo?"
"Hey Trizz, where you at, nigga?"
"Yeah, I- I'll be there nigga-"
"You said you were gonna be here man, come here now man!"
"Yeah, I know, I know, hey, can you take care of that for me?"
"It's done, it's done!"
"Alright, no problem, I'm close, I'm real close."
"Oh, are you close?"
"Yeah man I'm hella close, I'll be there, I'll be there."
"Yeah."
"You rushing me man-"[Verse 1 - Brotha Lynch]
Must be some leakage in my click, some niggas done ran up in my shit
Forced to use the fo-fifth, leavin 'em layin' in Ol 8 English piss
Got me all stressin' and sick, pickin' up bodies 'n draggin 'em, body baggin 'em
Try'na get it all done before the wagon come stashin' them
Aye put Scarface on the T.V, put the volume up to ten and a half
That way when the police come, Al Pacino bustin' caps
I got away with a killin', it was self defence
Had to rinse niggas off the hallway walls, send my hate out to all they dogs
Yellin' like a psycho when I pulled it
It was cuttin' every bullet plenty of full clips
Fuck em, feed em tef' tips
Got a tool kit, filled of kill em up shit
I be puttin' niggas on the ground wid it, fuck niggas who ain't down wid it
They can hit the back door, see I'mma handle this
I'm so scandalous, like a preacher to teach ya of this (?) shit
If I gotta trip, I'mma heat ya and eat ya
I swear I'm serious, herious, feriously hittin' chest plates
I hit them niggas up quick and have it all cleaned up by the next day
[Hook - Brotha Lynch]
See I was shootin' through the hallway
Try'na hit everything in sight
Thinkin' in my mind I knew this shit could happen one night
Gotta hit that one right, when I hit that one left
And I'm in the room fillin' up the wycelf, quiet steps - Boom!
Muthafucka what'chu doin' here, don't you know I got kids?
Hold up, he ain't dead yet, one mo' to the ribs
Try'na get body parts to relatives, like nigga you don't get it?
I cut when I hit it, nigga nuts 'n guts ripped when I did it

[Verse 2 - Zigg Zagg]
Night after night, I had another thought of destruction
Until this evening, couldn't believe it ran up in my home with the heat, buckin
My baby's watchin' it, front row seated, with the chrome to the (?) momma
No pain right now, but later on down the line with the head drama
Didn't expect this to happen to me but this evening was heated
When I walked outta the bedroom, witnessed 'em flash by deep and all black eye ...(?)
I mean five or six of 'em, strapped, with the nine-milla to my face
I (?) the hallway, backed up, and ran to the closet for the 12 gauge
What could I do right now beside let it all surface
Then come fuck up your shit on purpose, I got your whole system nervous
But you lied to me compulsive, hit me the hardest like explosives
Into your underground Black Market recordin' shit, get focused
Dis Siccmade, can't nothin' possibly take that away
But if you make me mad, I get that rage
Inflict pain, then make arrangements
Labelled the most wanted, the most dangerous
Wake up out of a dead sleep, walkin' to the murder
Then flamed the rush

[Hook] x1

[Verse 3 - Brotha Lynch]
See now it's two weeks later, I had to cut like a cheese grater
Did in all black like a Raider and hit niggas up like a pager, red beam laser
My trust got all fucked up so now I'm watchin' the lights behind me
Tuckin' the metal stuff, try'na get that shit behind me
Testin' my ghetto luck, in the streets Zigg Zagg, my crimey
We lookin' for that prime meat
We lookin' for that man that plotted the crime to try to tie my
Life span, splatter my pipe dream
Leave you stiff like a mic stand
Yeah I'm the Burbank titan, whether you likin' it or not
Grew up right out of 24th street, yeah some call it the blocc
And when they first hit the locks, see I was shot
All I saw was chrome and niggas in black ski masks, comin' in my home
They try'na take my money, they try'na get paid, so I don't blame 'em
But I wish I had the chopper to put the flame to 'em
But I didn't, just a hand pistol, same doin', bone gristle
Came to 'em, dumpin at shadows, and I was havin' shoot-out battles

[Hook] x2[Mr. Doctor] Chorus x2:
This shit is on
I got love for the blocc
Let 'em know for the blocc nigga yeah
This shit is on
I got love for the blocc
Nine times for the blocc nigga yeah

[Mr. Doctor]
Crossed the tracks, out at Burbank High
Late night, nigga felt nice
Came in through the hole in the fence
Threw up the mighty 9
Bloccstyle

Every real nigga from 29th street
Kicked up a gang of dust
True, this is why we dedicate the rhyme
To the niggas from the G-B-C, rollin' wit deuce nine
What's the wild straight deuces'?
And while the set's in the city of Sac
Ain't got no truces
How it hurt when the homie Chocalote moved on
How it hurt when the homey Q-Ball was gone

And ain't nobody gave a fuck
While you niggas bullshittin'
Rival killa, murder his ass

Crept up in the dark from the roof right over these
Last three minutes I, learned how to murder
Jumped up in the shower with, blood all over me
Took it in the dark I was fuckin' up, its close to three
Right up in the heart with a knife I tote a 3

Yellin' out, "Mayday", lookin' for some cess
Since 1983 your nigga been lookin' for success
Shit, shit it didn't happen now there's, blood all over me
Runnin' down the street with, blood all over me
Had to let the heat spit, now its all over the streets
I spit nasty, throwin' up all over the beat
Nobody catch me, baby girl know the police, ha ha
I'll be out the same night looking for the meat
Try it! Taking a bath in some blood
With some wine glasses and candles that's why they call me Mannibal

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Next day I'm in the car with, blood all over me
Nu, nu, now I'm feeling funny cause the, blood all over me

Back then, it was real easy to get a hold of me
Right now niggas better really get a load of me, grrr
I got a huntin' knife it came with a shoulder piece
You pointin' the finger but no (No) I didn't kill your niece
I gotta run it right, wash off when I'm done at night

You should try this stuff, I'mma fry ribs up, grrr
And I mean what I say, finger paintin' blood in your hallway, hallway

[Hook]Can't offer you
Dinner and A Movie
We can hit the bed late at night
Or the jacuzzi
I can sharpen up the knife or
I can use the Uzi
Put a hole in your wife or
I can stab your new piece

(Hook)
Blood drops keep falling on my head
Bodies laying all over the house and they dead
A couple on the couch, a couple more in the bed
Some bleeding out the mouth, some bleeding out the head
And Dinner and A Movie, then I let them meet the lead
Better hop in a jacuzzi, then I turn the water red
Its more than just a movie, Its what the fucker said
Call me looney with Uzi, fingerfuck it till them blood drops are falling on my head

(Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung)
I used to wonder if my life was useless
I used to clean up all of my problems with two-fifths
I got a fetish for meat
I'll leave you dead in the street
I'll leave your head in the refrigerator
Next to your feet
I used to stay in the room
There ain't no way I used to play in the room
I used to pretend
I used to pray in my room
I was ugly and nappy
Had holes in my socks
Then when I grew up I learned to put
Hoes in the cock
Nah I'm serious
Put hoes in the cock
As police kicked in the door and found
Bloody clothes in the closet
I never have to say "Aw Shit"
I spit that raw shit
Im on some take the meat out the freezer
Until it thaw shit
This is Dinner and A Movie
Not Season Of the Sicc

Rape a bitch, Rape your bitch

Pack it up, take it in for evidence
And I've been made sick
Ever since
(Thats what it is)

(Hook)
Blood drops keep falling on my head
Bodies laying all over the house and they dead
A couple on the couch, a couple more in the bed
Some bleeding out the mouth, some bleeding out the head
And Dinner and A Movie, then I let them meet the lead
Better hop in a jacuzzi, then I turn the water red
Its more than just a movie, Its what the fucker said
Call me looney with Uzi, fingerfuck it till them blood drops are falling on my head

(Verse 2: COS)
I stick and stand when I cut them

My redrum on 'em
Im sicko man so it's fuck 'em
The lead come for them
Cuz its the dad and his mother
So what you come for them
ITS MURDA
And you can smell it in the air
Bodies all over the house
Blood on the wall smeared
Its the fear factor
We gon' see if youre scared
We kidnap your children
You find out that they ain't there
Some real actors nigga
See us, we dont compare

At you, you shoot in the air
We'll repaint the ceiling for you
Tye-dye your chair
You sitting there, Bye nigga
Tie-die you there
Butcher niggas like cows nigga
Tie you like a bear
Grisly scenes for ?

The way shit compared to murder
Is hard to bear
You weak stomach niggas throw up
Soon as you stare
Some body parts here
Some body parts over there
Its body art nigga
Tattoo you an ?
Nigga its sacramental
And wear their colors like a pack of Skittles
We bloody up the covers quick soon as you nap a little
Hit the Yak a little
Put something in your back a little
Till it crack a little
Split it till it crack the middle
Till we get it, they ain't even selling crack a little
We rip 'em up like Jack a little
Blood will splat a little

(Hook)
Blood drops keep falling on my head
Bodies laying all over the house and they dead
A couple on the couch, a couple more in the bed
Some bleeding out the mouth, some bleeding out the head

Better hop in a jacuzzi, then I turn the water red
Its more than just a movie, Its what the fucker said
Call me looney with Uzi, fingerfuck it till them blood drops are falling on my head

Can I offer you
Dinner and A Movie
We can hit the bed late at night

Black mamba
Giving niggas the siccness 'til I'm dead like my momma

With a little squeeze from the lemon and lime

Murder without a motive its ya boy I gotta passion

Dinner and a Movie!
I'm back, nigga
That's what it is

[Verse 1 - Brotha Lynch Hung]
Yeah, I might as well get wet, give me a Newport

Just gettin' warmed up, ain't nobody can fuck with me
Even luckily, get cut in three, I'm a fuckin' beast, I tuck a .3-
-57, and it keep me revvin' Mr.Techron
Pure white cocaine spit not even stepped on
Sort of like blue magic, the pussy I stab at it
And stab at it, I'm a addict it bleeds when I tap it
Manic depressive, and if you test him
Man it's a lesson, plan to get your chest ripped
Damn Smith & Wesson, and it will test 'em
Hand it to Kevin, cannibal sessions
Hand full of intestines, Kansas is with me
Strange Music is with him I think they read little
I still see siccem, from long distance, for instance
I get with him, I spit sick shit sniffin'

[Hook - C-Lim & G-Macc] (2x)
Coathanga, throat ? strangla
Your folks get mangled up, cut 'em up from the naval
Put you in the hospital fast, have you wearing a oxygen mask
With the doctors in surgery, get it colostomy bag

[Verse 2 - Brotha Lynch Hung]
My whole cigarette's wet, I'm 'bout to smoke it
Get hard like east Oakland rappers I super-soak it
After the crew get over and I'll be standin' over 'em
With a nine millimeter hit 'em like a wild receiver like Jerry Rice
Them niggas think I'm weak cause I'm very nice
All I do is just think about eatin' 'em every night
So I gotta carry every knife, every machete I'm steadily deadly
His head'll he bury and gettin' cut up, I'll be at the motel fucked up
Blood in my cup with a fine bitch hugged up
'Till my heart get plugged up, I'mma still be in my Dickie shit thugged up
Make a nigga throwin' up blood, throwin' up guts, nigga what's what?
We kind of Strange, nigga we eat nigga nuts and guts
You already know what I eat your insides and break down your enzymes
And take out your insides sniffin'

[Hook - C-Lim & G-Macc] (2x)
Coathanga, throat ? strangla
Your folks get mangled up, cut 'em up from the naval
Put you in the hospital fast, have you wearing a oxygen mask
With the doctors in surgery, get it ? bad

[Verse 3 - Brotha Lynch Hung]
I need a cigarette, I cut a nigga neck
And watch the blood drip out, hit 'em with a Tec
Just like these niggas wanna fuck my bitch, let 'em sweat
She smile at you and she'll cut your motherfuckin' neck
I hang a nigga and strangle niggas with barbed wire
It's a little strange, but listen to what I desire
I put the tools in they nuts, twist it with the pliers
I'm a hot rod, you a hot dog like Oscar Mayers
I drop logs nigga, shittin' like diarrhea
You get the butcher knife to the eyes if you try to see him
Either that or my bitch'll see you right at the club
And put the woopty wap in ya mug and your grave's dug
I got it made, cuz, makin' Strange Music
To listen to and dissin' you cause that's how Strange do it
We sicker then hard liquor withya it's no thang
Coathanga Strangla spittin' the cocaine, nigga

[Hook - C-Lim & G-Macc] (2x)
Coathanga, throat ? strangla

With the doctors in surgery, get it ? badAlright you motherfuckers
You ready for this?

Damn
Cause you gotta be high to listen to this shit, you know
Fuck that, fuck that, turn the tape off
You know what I'm sayin'
Man, go get you a motherfuckin' spliff
And for those of you that are already high...
Peek this shit[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Somebody gotta tell me why my pockets ain’t lined with nothing
Got me contemplating about doing a crime or something
I think about it three weeks, and all that I could come up with
Is liquor store hold-ups, back to drinking O.E
Lights about to get shut off, gas tank is on E
And my bitch is on my heels, but this ain’t where she want to be
Nigga, I can do better, keep running through my mind and
And now I’m locked in this room with some solitary confine shit
Plottin’ a quick come up, and thinkin’ ‘bout where my kid’s next meal gon’ come from
And nigga then it hit me, all I need is a costume and mask to conceal this
Bring up massive destruction as this bad superhero
Days late to complete, with a kay drape in the feet
And a AK for the heat, not a safe place in the streets
Thinkin’ payback’s sweet and it’s time to punish y’all
Standing at the mirror as the bloodhound, underdog

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung]
I don’t want to, do the things I do
Why would I want to, do these things to you
Yeah, I’ma have to get bloody buddy
Motherfuckers won’t love me
I could really get ugly muddy
Silly like that putty Kutty
We gon’ have to get bloody plucky
Knocking him out like we go, he know, he go
Hard like mad niggas, bad superhero

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I can't afford to go small
Either get nothing or get it all
Think about it, turned around
Finished 'em all
All night to work the late shit
Escape with two trash bags full of cash
Stabbed to the pad, hop the stash bag fully macked
Ready to do another
Getting easier and easier
The moment I shot a brother, didn't even think of reasoning
Masquerade through the street, as I lurk in the night shadows
Pickin' em one by one like a pimple
And uh-oh there's one heading toward the door toward me
Had to asphyxiate the strong one
Cause she was a screamer
Lay down to red bandana
Stampped with a paw print over her face
Start leaving the trademark
As I pick up the keys to her car
Tomorrow nights first priority
I concur to take it from the rich
And give it to myself, because I'm sure I deserve it
I used to feel worthless, somehow I feel fit that
Now I'm serving my purpose, bloodhound, underdog

[Hook]

Verse 3 (Brotha Lynch Hung)
It's Mr. nine one siccness, most niggas ain't get they dick split
Bitches ain't gettin they clit bit
Intimate to gettin it rippin' it infinite leavin a nigga impotent

Speaking with your wife, catch me
Sleeping with your wife, catch me
Eating up your wife, catch me
Eating up the night

You better believe it like Ripley's I'm a have a hissy fit; and it's strictly a bitch
And they give me a kick out of it then I'm about to get out of here bendin up fifty quick!
I smoke like 50 zips... Kutt give me the clip
Wow! Ooh!
I'm just killing em up with Calhoun!
I paid dues and it didn't get me shit
Niggas is dreaming I'd get to cleaning and leaning up out of the beamer, they bleeding

Some people say that's it's evilm I just say that's it's me though: I see dead people
