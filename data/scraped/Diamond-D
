[Intro]
You say "one for the treble, two for the time"
Come on, y'all, let's rock this!
You say "one for the treble, two for the time"
Come on!
Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall, (huh!)

[Verse 1]
My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still
Committed to page, I write a rhyme
Sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically administer
Subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
From the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto
Stay fluid even in staccato
Full blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow
There's the hum, young man where you from
Brooklyn number one
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (there it is)
While you still tryin to find where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies
Violently, silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's En-g-lish
But caught a rash on my lips
So now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (swish)
Move like an apparition
Float to the ground with ammuntion (chi-chi-POW)
Move from the gate, voice cued on your tape
Putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate
Who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping
To Be-Bopping, to Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(where ya at) I'm high, low, east, west
All over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock
The fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop
Then the phone calls....
Chill for a minute
Let's see who else hot
Snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself ock
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)

[Scratching]

Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement
Ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits (hungh!)
Luxury tenements choking the skyline
It's low life getting tree-top high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory
A class E felony
Facing the death penalty (hungh!)
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with
On time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness
Remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot
The working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box
Sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)
It's all-city like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you
Praise you, pay you
Do whatever you say do
But black, it can't save you[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies, the highs
At all of these industry shing-dings
Where you see the pretty girls
In the high animated world
Checking for a rapper with all the dough
If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business?
And you think that you got what it takes?
I mean you really gotta rap, and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks
Check it out!

[Hook: All]
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
The ups and downs with the hoes (The Business)
Always getting fronted on at shows (The Business)
People gotta stick their nose (In the Business)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
Ain't no-one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the games just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real...

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
They're giving you the business and putting on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say "Where's my loot?"
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're making fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cos you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, "More soup with your meal?"
Cos this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say...

[Verse 4: Phife]
Aw shucks, look what the cat hauled in
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Going out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flying
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
Cos they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cos your lyrics is butt

[Hook: All]
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
People can't walk a straight line in (The Business)
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)

[Verse 5: Sadat X]
The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
"Oh, he's a cutie", yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game
And I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

[Verse 6: Diamond D]
Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefing ("Boy, get a job")
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willing and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
(For what?) That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing
When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild[Hook - high-pitched]
My chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My-my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours
My-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours
My-my-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours
My-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours

[Ludacris - over Hook]
Yeah, ha ha (you're right.. you're right)
The "pussy rules the world" version
You ready? Let's go! Ha
I got a all-star lineup for y'all, right (Ms. 32)
But I'mma start off in Atlanta, Georgia (you know I gotcha)
We gon' give you some new blood
Diamond, holla at 'em baby!

[Diamond] + (Ludacris)
Ride or die chick with a pocket full of relish (hey!)
Jimmy Choo fetish keep me fresh like lettuce
Bitches get jealous, cause I'm quite cocky
Since 14 ain't nann ho stop me
Money, I get it on the tracks I spit it
That's why the credit cards don't come with no limits (OHH!)
Y'all just don't get it, a crib with no tenants
Walk through closets like I'm walkin out of Lennox
Now that's Swagger on a hundred, thousand, trillion
Roll with bad bitches and they all look Brazilian
These niggas can't leave me, I swear they can't leave me
Ass so fat and the pussy like Fiji
Diamond!

[Hook]

[Ludacris - over Hook]
Ha, OHH!
Yeah, yeah, WOO!
We gon' take it from the hood of Atlanta, Georgia
Down to the hoods of Miami, Florida
What up Trina?
Holla at 'em baby, let's GO!

[Trina] + (Ludacris)
I'm Da Baddest Chick and they don't call me that for nothin (nope)
Diamond Princess straight VVS stuntin
Light gray eyes, hourglass frame
Still got the crown for best ass in the game (woo!)
Hips of a goddess, watch how I throw 'em
So good it make him wanna tattoo my lips on him (ahh!)
I'm so bad and I rep that hood
Pussy stay wet, sex so good
Ten years strong, you should act like you know me
Head so fire make you do the hokey-pokey (woo!)
A good stroke in and a good stroke out (okay)
Now that's what I'm all about
I'm Da Baddest

[Hook]

[Ludacris - over Hook]
{*laughs*} Yeah! OHH!
Woo! ... Okay
We gon' take it from Miami
We gon' travel north, 'til we get to Philly, right?
And we gon' stop in Philly
We gon' holla at my girl E-V-E
Let's GO!

[Eve] + (Ludacris)
Yeah I took a couple years off, came back still bustin
Still reppin Philly, still the Eve of Destruction (yeah)
Still pushin buttons that'll do away the roof
Still walkin 'round with five thousand dollar boots (woo!)
So when I'm in the club, your chicks get jealous
Cause I'm that bitch and still keep a mean fetish (OHH!)
Still stack lettuce, huh, still stack cheese
And I got a bad temper, tell your nigga say p-lease (ha ha ha)
Cause this is for the G's, never for the busters
So put your diamond rings on and get yourself a hustler
Better yet a customer, guaranteed to buy it
Sick from them lips, caramel, wanna try it?

[Hook]

[Ludacris - over Hook]
Yes, ha ha... OHH!
And I'm lovin it, HEY!
Let's go, all my chicks are bad
All my chicks is hood
All my chicks is better than yours, AH![Verse 1: Wyclef]
Look into the rhyme
Rum to the ripple
Single
But at times I come in triple
Blaow, blaow put the heater to your head
Now your dead
Wyclef don't give a *beep* if you're dead
Raaaaah, raaaah
Let me attack just like the black cat
You in the wrong neighborhood, check the map
Hooo, you've got to go for backup
To do what you gotta do
So you'll be back with France CU
Traitor in your crew is mafo heat
Put the poison in your tea
And kill the toad, But I'll be back with the centipede
I'm on some new technique, drunken bamboo
Awoo hoo a hoo, I'm taking all crews what
Competition, stimulation for the rap man
Losers check your tooters
While I'm suckin' on your girls hooters
Don't play macho, while you got the gun
Cause if you got to reload
Wyclef the multi-talented
Average heads can't handle it
I'll bring it to you live
Only if you want it
Me and my guitar go back like the days of the R MC's
[C'mon check out my melody]
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
Through any contest
I'm victorious
Still keep it real, if you will and manifest
Through your skills, not by how many shells you peel

[Verse 2: Praz]
I'm a bring down the ruckus
Play the nutcracker
Rough-neck rednecks make me no bother
Time after time, ask Cyndi Lauper
Boss, you don't want to fuckk with my partners
Motion, commotion, what's your proposal
Uphold two-fold, the crew is disposal
Like utensil, false idental
I autograph my lyrics with a number 2 pencil

[Verse 3: Lauryn]
I'm the L, Won't you pull it
Straight to the head
With the speed of a bullet
Cuttin' jokers off at the meeky-freeky gullet
Lyrical sedative, keep niggas medative
Head rushers I give to creative kids and fiends
Dreams of euphoria
Aurora
To another galaxy
Phallic-sy
Be this microphone, but get lifted
Lyrically I'm gifted
Burn on in without the roach clip (it)
Henders, mind-bender
Pleasure sender
So frequently your nerve endings belong to me
Wrongfully you put me down not receiving the full capacity of my smoke
Wack niggas choke
From the fumes that I emote
Or emit shit
See even I feel the mahogany L
Natural hallucinogen
Turning boys to men again
With estrogen dreams
Release blues, yellows and greens
From Brownsville to Queens

[Verse 4: Diamond-D]
I creep like a theif, no doubt the man's swift
I'm more magnificent than Lee Van Cleef
You stand stiff and got the nerve to let your man riff
[We know where to run]
And start flakin' like dandruff
C'mon son my steelo's tight
Cause by far I'm the best producer on the mic
Born to write, analytical conceptions
With precision and leave lyrical incisions("Get nothin' but abuse!")
Refrain 4x
Punks jump up to get beat down!
("Get nothin' but abuse...")

[Verse 1 – Sadat X]
One day when I was ridin' on the train I seen these two kids talkin'
About the Nubian reign had fallen
I didn't say nothin' cuz these kids caught my goat
Even wore my coat like a murder that they wrote
So this kid with mouth swagger 'n I'll blaze the cloak and dagger
So I gotta show Dukes the macho lot that I am
I can rock a jam, make the world drop ham
Oh yes, I'm the bad man, and bad men wear black
And if it comes to droppin' bombs, yo, I'm with that
Though I can freak, fly, floow, fuck up a faggot
Don't understand their ways I ain't down with gays
You wanna grab the style that was made from my mom and my dad
When I was young I used to run with a notepad
Then time flew and somehow I knew that I was bad to the bone...
Black prodigy since the age of twen-ty
I could write a rhyme, rip it up and write a next one
Right on the spot, sign my name with a dot
Diamond D threw me some smooth shit, Bronx crowd roar
Stick up your wack jam, everybody hit the floor
Okay it's you, Slim, the hard rock of the pack
Don't wanna kneel to the brothers, you must be holin'
Bust some shit in his chest, now his whole body's swollen
Why did I have to do it? He asked for it
His man saw it, so it don't mean shit to me
He's gone, that's how it's supposed to be....check it out now
I ain't goin' out, man that short shit is dead
Have you heard what I said? If not, ask the dread
He got a cannon that's bad...similar to the one that I got from my own dad

Refrain 4x

[Verse 2 – Lord Jamar]
Your punk ass'll be grass quick fast like my name was Flash
When a nigga try and rob me for my cash
You thought you had a sweet vic, a nice pick
But you didn't anticipate that I might be sick
Now who's the trick, cuz I'm not a ho. (No, no-no-no!)
I always do the fuckin', just might do the buckin'
I leave my Nikes stuck in your rectum, till you learn
Brand Nubian, yo, you gotta respect 'em
Dissect 'em, yo, our word is bond regardless
To my what, and do the Puma strut
So step the fuck off, before I punch you in your face
With the mothafuckin' bass!
Then you're gonna taste blood in your mouth, it's gonna flood south
To the ground, and you're gonna know I don't fuck around
So if you think you had two soft newjacks
We're gonna have top off you with a few cracks
To the jaw and you won't pop that shit no more
Explainin' to your friends why you're layin' on the floor
Did you want some more? I didn't think so
Just got whipped like a faggot in the clink, so
I suggest you take your bloody mess and find a piece of wire
Fix your broken jaw, then it's time to retire
Lord Jamar will live long, cuz I give strong blows the heads of my foes
Dread flows, gives me power as it grows
Watch how rass-cladda you catch the speed knot
Heed not, and hell will be your home
Lord Jamar, Sadat, as we swell your dome

Refrain 4x[Intro: 'The River Wild' sample]
"Where are you?" "Hey, there you are!"
"How does it feel to know you only have a few more seconds left to live?"
*gunshot*

("Big L" - Cut and scratched)

[Big L]
I stay jeweled up, pockets swelled up from banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep in a triple black dark tinted old jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put a Glock to his dome
Tell him, "Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split"
Grip, it ain't nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
Mad niggas be fronting a lot
Popping mad shit, tryna be something they not
Your faggot ass better stick to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing, that's right
In '97 Harlem kids is blowing
And we don't trick, we'll let a bitch starve till her ribs are showing

("Lord Finesse" - Cut and scratched)

[Lord Finesse]
Heated divine mastermind that turn nickels to dimes
The authentic genuine that's out to shine
The cool cat, the true mack, the smooth raps
Chickens be like, "Who that?" I be doing my thing, kid (True dat)
Forget fronting, I'm beyond that, I roll with brothers ready for combat
All for eye-to-eye contact
With skills, G, yo it's ill see, for real B
Ain't no barbecue, niggas better stop tryna grill me
Huh, sent that style to the essence
Got niggas stressing my style, pull like fluorescents
No question, tough type to clutch mics
The positive upright, I'm the "I don't give a fuck" type
Expose the facts, you know the haps
Could go to laugh astrological, like the signs in the Zodiac
Your rap crew out the stack loop, word up
My style's tighter than a fat bitch in a cat suit
Suprise G, it's not wise see to size me
When I operate, it's Smooth Sailing like Ron Isely
Gotta do my thing, word up (Beg ya pardon?)
Time to bounce, gotta skate like Tonya Harding

("A.G." - Cut and scratched)

[A.G.]
Yo I'm the cleverest top ten terrorist
Chickens ever diss they become featherless
Hate derelicts, certified gold medallist
You play fly cause I'm the most high like Everest
Look at all these fakes, musically you imitate the Crates
Won't succeed moving at full speed with no brakes
Like Jake, watch me take your entourage
Can't see me, I'm camoflauge and besides, I'm God
Mad hard like the S.A.T. who have shorties
Caught up in the mental, watch her bless A.G
Evidently you still don't know because you tempt me
Thought you was the boss when your fat thoughts were empty
Not Fat Joey Crack but still Jealous One's Envy
Who sent me? D.I.T.C., good and plenty
Like the doctor, smoke a Spike Joint and watch "Clockers"
Get rude like Shabba, make moves behind my blockers
Crazy sickness, you want the pure, you'd better pick this
Bitches can't get this, faggots remain dickless

("Fat Joe" - Cut and scratched)

[Fat Joe]
Before we get started, let's talk about these coward-hearted
MC's that claim to be true O.G.'s
And war specialists forever bust your guns on the sack of shit
But when the beef come, get on the ___ before I protest your licks
You know the deal, I come with nothing but the real
Certified pejente, recognize mi gente
Whether East Coast or West Coast, I'll make 'em all strip naked Bitch niggas will never get respected
Joey Green bagging devils up in Bowling Green for all is clean
Cock the 9 soon as I seen his Rolie gleam
You know the team, never giving a fuck
Laying thick in the cut, get your shit laced up
What the fuck!

("Diamond D" - Cut and scratched)

[Diamond]
Yo I'm flipping on niggas like treys of crack
My raps react on your cardiac like a heart attack
Some niggas front for stunts
Who want to take a puff of the blunt and play a nigga like a chump
But I don't play that shit with no chicks
Sucking the next nigga's dick, moving bricks
I'm too slick for you high school dropouts
You got knocked and tried to cop out
Couldn't fight when the kids pulled the mop out
And wails you out, writing home saying, "Bail me out"
Little small time, fucked up when you called mine
D Squared, one of the Greatest of All Times

[Outro: Diamond D]
Yeah, D.I.T.C. representing for the '97, word life[Pharoahe Monch]
Yo
Truth had me up against the ropes
And semi-concious without no boxing skills
Fear of it makes hair on my neck grow like minoxodil
Watchin the clock is ill when, faced wit the truth
Parallels observing, amateur video tapes of
Twenty-one top notch NYPD cops get ill
Fill they minds not to kill still some, never revealed
True feelings, we're speaking on the truth right now in itself is healing
See The Creator, created existence and balance
At right angles, unless it was conceived and stated
So whoever shall stray away from right lives wrong
The deliverance of the word false opposite of truth off course
Sure as my slave name sending
Troy Donald Jamerson paves the path, enabling truth
To stay stable and cling to EARTH!
Sorta similar to the way static electricity sting see
Truth brings light, light refracts off the mirror
Visions of yourself and error could never be clearer
The truth is that you ugly, not on the outside
But in the inside, on the outside you fronting you lovely
The discovery of these things and all are well-hidden
But when you in denial of self it is forbidden, that's the truth

[Female singer]
In due time we will find

[Common] *speaking behind vocals*
See it everywhere, gotta recognize it

Let the truth be told from young souls that become old
From days spent in the jungle, where must one go
To find it, time is real, we can't rewind it
Out of everybody I met, who told the truth? Time did
We find kids speakin cuz it's naturally in us
But the false prophets by tellin us we born sinners
Venders of hate, got me battlin my own mind state
At a divine rate, I ain't in this just to rhyme great
See the truth in the thighs of a stripper, the eyes of my nigga
If it's only one, then why should it differ
So constantly I seek it
Wonderin why I gotta drink a six pack to speak it
Took a picture of the truth and tried to develop it
Had proof, it was only recognized by the intelligent
Took the negative and positive, cuz niggas got to live
Said I got to give more than I'm given
Cuz truth'll never be heard in religion
After searchin' the world, on the inside what was hidden
It was the truth

[Female singer]
Truth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth
In due time, we will find

[Talib Kweli]
Check it, on my neck I still got marks from the nooses
The truth it produces, fear that got niggas on the run like Carl Lewis
The truth is my crew is the smoothest spitters of saliva juices
Like The Roots is, more organic than acoustics
Heavenly, what will set you free and kill you in the same breath
That shit you gotta get off your chest before your death, unless
The way you speak is lighter than a pamphlet
Cuz the truth give the words the weight of a planet goddammit
I ran wit what God planted in my heart and I understand it
To be to bring some light to the dark, breathe some life in this art
This must be the truth (why?) cuz we keep marchin on (true)
The truth lay the foundation of what we rockin on (true)
You can't see it if you blind but we will always prevail (true)
Life is like the open sea, the truth is the wind in our sail
And in the end, our names is on the lips of dying men
If ever crushed to the earth, we always rise again
When the words of lying men sound lush like the sound of a violin
The truth is there, it's just the heart you gotta find it in

[Verse 1: Dum-Dum and Happy P]
[Dum-Dum]
I hit it from worst ways

I'm needin it everyday
And twice on a Thursday
Blood thick than water
In pounds better than quarters
I smoking two joints
While I'm knockin down yo daughter
Dope House Records is on fire
So grab the estinguisher
I smoked out in the beamer
Bout to get emphezema
Gun slingers rap singers
With more stripe than the bengals
No need for the gang sign
I'm using my trigga finga

[Happy P]
Now won't you roll one
Po the four one
Sometimes I'm real selfish and I'll smoke my weed with no one
You know me
I'm young Happy P
Kick back aand blow a sweet
While my niggas move keys
Bitch please
I got G's
Sippin corona with lima squeeze
And platinum P's
Only smoke on the fine leaves
I started out
Sellin five dollar tweets
And now I'm elevating
Sellin 5000 dollar beats

[Hook: Grimm]

I smoke two joints when I wake up
In the car I smoke two joints
I smoke two joints when in play video games
And every 10,000 points
I smoke two joints in time of peace
And two in time of war ar
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke two more

[Verse 2: SPM and Low-G]
[SPM]
Maan this killer herb got me runnin over curbs
And writing these raps full of misspelled words
I curse on my verse snatch yo bitch like a purse
Cause she like the twinkies that I slapped on my herse
I take two charges it's really quite harmless
The only side effect is that it makes you retarded ha ha
I started in 82
In fifth grade
You can say I was in high school
True smoka

[Low-G]
I got Mary at an early age
Con mi hermosa
Maria es mi esposa
Mi sanchas Nina Rosa
Mafiosa
Pero es es otra cosa
My wife es celosa
No llores mariposa
Tan chiclosa
Te traigo from coasta coasta
I got your corazon droppin mi bolsa
Borracho de tu besos
Hoja pa mis huesos
Me trais pesos
Con hidea pa me seso

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Diamond and Grimm]
[Diamond]
Dimaond pop the balla scene
Smoke two joints where I can beam
Flip the scene bizatines
Sippin lean, sticky green
Come out fresh when it spring
Steady flossin diamond rings
Bustin gats with Bing
Catchin squares at ten
Baby Beeshi got the throne
Happy P we fitin to roll
And shut em down we livin throwed

Hit and run cause the scheme
Rush ya head and feel my spin
Since diamond came around
Now she down with a team

[Grimm]
Now I'm down with Bobby Brown
But I love Al Green
Keep a sweet in my mouth and anotha in my jeans
Bout to blow em back to back takin two to the dome
Home grown hydroponic always wanna get blown
Stay stoned at home
Drop a flow rock a show
Got to go out the do
Boppin ho after close

Place a pink in my eye
And I'm always down wit tryin new ways to reach for the sky

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Baby Beesh and Lil Bing]
[Baby Beesh]
Now I be blowin when it's mo than one but less than three
That's the recipe
Yes indeed blowin oooey gooey a neccesity
Don't question me
Blowin' heavily till I'm 70
That's the remedy
Feelin famous like the Kennedy's
From here to Tennessee sippin hennesse
Smokin with intensity
Feel my ghetto energy
Fools be sweatin me for that rush in the Lebanese
I be getting higher than the hills of Beverly Beverly

[Lil Bing]
Two joints be smellay in my Cadi
From the Valley to Cali
In the alley servin patties
Hastled by federales
Drippin candy
Sippin brandy
Twenty inches look fancy
On my way to the grammys
Hoes droppin they panties
Got a freak named Sandy
Makin hits like Sammie
I'm posted up with biscuits and chicken fried steak at Grandy's
Smashin off maan fo sho
Got my tv's on glow
Smokin two smokin four
Then mo with two mo
[Two mo repeats till fade][Intro: 'The River Wild' sample]
"Where are you?" "Hey, there you are!"
"How does it feel to know you only have a few more seconds left to live?"
*gunshot*

("Big L" - Cut and scratched)

[Big L]
I stay jeweled up, pockets swelled up from banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep in a triple black dark tinted old jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put a Glock to his dome
Tell him, "Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split"
Grip, it ain't nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
Mad niggas be fronting a lot
Popping mad shit, tryna be something they not
Your faggot ass better stick to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing, that's right
In '97 Harlem kids is blowing
And we don't trick, we'll let a bitch starve till her ribs are showing

("Lord Finesse" - Cut and scratched)

[Lord Finesse]
Heated divine mastermind that turn nickels to dimes
The authentic genuine that's out to shine
The cool cat, the true mack, the smooth raps
Chickens be like, "Who that?" I be doing my thing, kid (True dat)
Forget fronting, I'm beyond that, I roll with brothers ready for combat
All for eye-to-eye contact
With skills, G, yo it's ill see, for real B
Ain't no barbecue, niggas better stop tryna grill me
Huh, sent that style to the essence
Got niggas stressing my style, pull like fluorescents
No question, tough type to clutch mics
The positive upright, I'm the "I don't give a fuck" type
Expose the facts, you know the haps
Could go to laugh astrological, like the signs in the Zodiac
Your rap crew out the stack loop, word up
My style's tighter than a fat bitch in a cat suit
Suprise G, it's not wise see to size me
When I operate, it's Smooth Sailing like Ron Isely
Gotta do my thing, word up (Beg ya pardon?)
Time to bounce, gotta skate like Tonya Harding

("A.G." - Cut and scratched)

[A.G.]
Yo I'm the cleverest top ten terrorist
Chickens ever diss they become featherless
Hate derelicts, certified gold medallist
You play fly cause I'm the most high like Everest
Look at all these fakes, musically you imitate the Crates
Won't succeed moving at full speed with no brakes
Like Jake, watch me take your entourage
Can't see me, I'm camoflauge and besides, I'm God
Mad hard like the S.A.T. who have shorties
Caught up in the mental, watch her bless A.G
Evidently you still don't know because you tempt me
Thought you was the boss when your fat thoughts were empty
Not Fat Joey Crack but still Jealous One's Envy
Who sent me? D.I.T.C., good and plenty
Like the doctor, smoke a Spike Joint and watch "Clockers"
Get rude like Shabba, make moves behind my blockers
Crazy sickness, you want the pure, you'd better pick this
Bitches can't get this, faggots remain dickless

("Fat Joe" - Cut and scratched)

[Fat Joe]
Before we get started, let's talk about these coward-hearted
MC's that claim to be true O.G.'s
And war specialists forever bust your guns on the sack of shit
But when the beef come, get on the ___ before I protest your licks
You know the deal, I come with nothing but the real
Certified pejente, recognize mi gente
Whether East Coast or West Coast, I'll make 'em all strip naked Bitch niggas will never get respected
Joey Green bagging devils up in Bowling Green for all is clean
Cock the 9 soon as I seen his Rolie gleam
You know the team, never giving a fuck
Laying thick in the cut, get your shit laced up
What the fuck!

("Diamond D" - Cut and scratched)

[Diamond]
Yo I'm flipping on niggas like treys of crack
My raps react on your cardiac like a heart attack
Some niggas front for stunts
Who want to take a puff of the blunt and play a nigga like a chump
But I don't play that shit with no chicks
Sucking the next nigga's dick, moving bricks
I'm too slick for you high school dropouts
You got knocked and tried to cop out
Couldn't fight when the kids pulled the mop out
And wails you out, writing home saying, "Bail me out"
Little small time, fucked up when you called mine
D Squared, one of the Greatest of All Times

[Outro: Diamond D]
Yeah, D.I.T.C. representing for the '97, word life(Chorus)
Ahhh-ooohh!! watcha gonna do
When you see the fu-schnicks come through

I'm coming evil like knievel mad like a scientist smoothe
And silky rhyme are milky than even milk D
But niggas try to catch it like a scooby snack
I'll lay ya flat on ya back like an L.T. sack
It's the P.O. from the brook chopping rappers
Like a chef for real yo! hold up na-na-na
Wait a minute I'm super like man
When it comes to mics I'll bring ya styles
Of all types more than high top nikes
Catchin wreck like a tornado comin through ya area
Ain't no hearing ya with mass hysteria rhymes
I'll like vomit wit maneuvers like a chess player
That make me solid like gold I roll on beats
As if it's whores you better check ya sources
If I was you and you was me I'll be just extra cautions
So what's up ya think that ya really wanna riff
Man I'll run through ya crew like emmett smith so

(Chorus)

Now ain't I a stinker
I think I'm (hiccup) think I'm (hiccup) (cough) drunk
But yo I'm ready (hiccup) ready to (cough cough) catch a punk
And (cough) puff em full a lead
Shoot em till he's dead
And ooh I'll crush his little head to pieces
Yo it seem like I can't let let these suckers pass
So I'll leave MC's suffering like tha tha tha thuckatash
Cuz I rocks em, shock em all y'all can lick this, excuse my french
Yo I'm coming like that grinch that stole christmas
Now wit this, ignite me light me, fssssss! boom!
Leaving skid eerk! marks eerrk! all over this track
Ya ding-a-ling but will and come again
I think my spidey sense is tingling
Kid I'm live like at the apollo, bullet tips are hollow
Time fee kill a sound kill a sound kill a sound bwoy tomorrow
When I raps I'm that hard act to follow
You can never bite my style, because it's wild and hard to swallow

(Chorus)

Ahh-oohhh! it's true I'm down wit the infamous fu crew
Do do I though ya knew and it's visible
I'm surely imperial I'm golden chosen and quick ta open
Brothers up for the year of '94 don't snore
Ya thought I had one style, but kid I got much more
Now let's see.. I'm trippin I agree my mind's slippin
Off and on the track and strapped wit a rhyme
A microphone like a gat, an animal that's planning
To get a piece of the action with the traction shoots
A three point shot like paxson ya askin nothin homeboy
I knew ya fluffin again and again you're mouthin off saying
Nothing, so what in the hell you doing here are you lost
I'm top notch, I get props your head will get tossed of course
I'm swingin shit wit force, so what's up now?!?!?!

(Chorus)[Verse One]
Y'all rap careers all headed south like Route 1-9
You're an artist but you only got one design
That's a name you can underline
It's dark underground but I don't wait for the sun to shine
Every rapper on their summer grind
Some are deaf, some are dumb and some are blind
I'm in the first category cause I can't hear ya niggas, tell your label I'm the one to sign
I'm the one they should run and find
Who can do what I do?Not that many come to mind
When it come to rhyme - I'm like Dr.Seuss
Not a crip but got some shit that can stop a truce
Prosecutor and I got the proof
Rappers say they got a lot of money but that's not the truth
When I spit you can lock the booth
And throw away the key, what you see here'll shock the youth
Cause any rapper in my age range must've failed and looking to get a grade change
But I crush that theory when you look and you hear me, you know what you see is way strange
Lot of niggas off their A games
I diss 'em all but I ain't sayin names
But if I'm forced and I have to
You know that I will, better chill before I come at you
Ace

[Hook]
"Listen closely"
"I am the man in charge"
"Yeah"
"Diamon in the back"
"You know the ammo"
"No biting allowed"

[Verse Two]
Yeah, we go together like sweater and hat
With Diamond on the track what could be better than that?
To be contestant with just a incredible ?
Cookin up a main cause with this eateble rap
The game of life is like a knife, dead in the back
Watch how you walk or get caught with your leg in the trash
The first step is they gon' ask what colors you rep
The red, white and the blue or the green,red and the black
They always try to make us pick up a side
I refuse to be one of them dudes they kick aside
I am still a great force to be reckoned with
Diggin In The Crates, that's who I'm reppin' with
Yup, y'all ain't used to this sort of skills
We've been nice since British Walkers and quaterfields
And y'all can have all them singin' thugs
The Ace and Dime are still greater than the king of clubs

[Hook]

"You wanna get this"[Produced by Diamond, Sadat X & Jamar]



[Lord Jamar]
Aww yeah, back to basics, kicking shit in Asics...it's like this

[Hook: Lord Jamar]
It's just a day in the life (of three black men)
(Repeat x3)

Day one...

[Verse 1: Lord Jamar]
I wake up to the sun in the morning at the Justice hour
Refinement is in order so I bust this shower
Get dressed, but first my mind gets blessed
Not words, but best cess compressed in a Phillie
Silly of me, to think that I
Could ever have a morning where the phone didn't ring
I answer, a sweet young thing wants a romancer
I didn't really fancy her, so Build Equality
I get a beep downstairs from Y.Z.O
Knowledge in his head, beats pump the red Geo
Tracker, and in it, we get much blacker
Ride around town running down crackers
Last Sunday of the month so to Harlem we went
Not clubbing, the Parliaments of Harriet Tubman
Peace to the Gods, peace to the Earths
Peace to the seeds, peace to the birth
Of the nation of the Five Percent
That sent intelligent brothers to represent
We left the rally now we're maxing uptown
8th Ave, 25th, 45th, and the Polo Grounds
And when it's time to refuel
Lord Jamar jump in the car and say "Back to the Rule"
It's like that y'all, you know it's as sharp as a knife
It's just a day in the life, it's just a day in the life

[Hook: Diamond]

Day two, yo check this out

[Verse 2: Diamond]
Every day when I wake up, phone calls seem to take up
My time, but I don't mind because it's fine
I don't get heated even though I can't sleep
Jump in the shower, then I brush the teeth
Hit the stereo in an instant
Then I twist up a bud, light an incense
Call up a honey if I'm not feeling sunny
Or call up my boys when I want to make noise
The brother Lord Jamar, the brother Derek X
Ahem, oh I forgot, I meant Sadat
X and I flex when I'm writing a rhyme
I got thousands in the bank but I never did a crime
Afternoons I go shopping, but I don't lift
Back in '84 I used to wear K-Swiss
Catch me in Yonkers at the mall buying gear
Take in a movie and sit in the rear
I might be in the studio hard at work
Making hype tracks that sell by the stacks
When it gets dark, I chill with my cutie
We almost broke up cause she started acting snooty
When I'm with the fellas, I hit the clubs
The Building, Red Zone, always see a head flown
But I walk away from the bullshit
And you don't stop, and you don't quit

[Hook: Sadat X]

Day three...

[Verse 3: Sadat X]
I wake up at the 8-ish hour then I take a shower
See a tip from last night still left in the tray
Some stick of boom music cause I found a fat L
Nine times out of ten I used to start this way
Then I study jewels and gems instead of Christianity hymns
Then walk past him to see my man Marco Polo who works in sports stuff
Your two shirts that's tough, a baldie that's rough
Call up the Gods, slide to three main places
We know a lot of faces so the romp game can work
Do you think that I'm a jerk because on my face there's a smirk?
Used to party to party rock from body to body
But my nightly smokes are spent on the cool down low
Rolling up dough and doing mad shows
Not dealing with hoes cause AIDS is a bitch
In the nightime I get rich because kids pump the tape
Uptown Bronx from the porch to the fire escape, and you don't stop
So to my prehistoric days and dinosaur phase
I was completely energized using Islamic rays
I'm the royal highness, so clear your sinus
Put your trust in the plus and conceal the minus
Your head's unravelling, my force is of a javelin
Your tounge is in a knot and you're babbling on
To the pretence that is the God human?
Come from the darkness to where I'm looming
The hardest working man ever, sea or land
I got the power to devour what MC's withstandYeah.. now in ninety-three
Everybody knows the flav
Fat Joe Da Gangsta, yeah
You know my style

Fat Joe, a.k.a. Da Fat Gangsta
I'm no joke, and I'm far from a prankster
I got skills, aiyyo word life
Suckers is scared, because they know I live trife
As I troop down the streets of a ghetto
Skins are jockin, and always screamin hello
But I keep drivin in my jet black Beamer
I'm not a daydreamer, but I'm known as a scheamer
I'm dead-ass, when it comes to this
And if you fuck around, your moms'll reminisce
Thinkin of the good times she spent with her son
Somebody shoulda told you that I wasn't the one
Yes I'm known to get nuff respect
And if you face Fat Joe, well then you face your death
Now in ninety-three, it's time to take a stand
And you know how I'm livin, I'm a bad, bad, man

Niggas know the flav
"I'm a bad, bad, man!" (cut and scratched 2X)

Check it
All the old folks, hate my guts
Cause I be hittin all they daughters and they big fat butts
Cause I'm the papichulo when it comes to rap
And if you fuck with me, then you leave handicapped
I don't give a fuck, don't care who you are
I gotta say peace to my peeps GangStarr
Some real motherfuckers from around the hood
When I chills with them, we be up to no good
Hittin skins, makin ends
Loungin with my friends in my fat BM
Whether Uptown in the Boogie Down
Or checkin out stunts in the Polo Ground
See just like Mel, I'm internationally known
And I'm mob related, like Al Capone, check it
Too hot to handle, blow you like a candle
You never catch Joe in the middle of a scandal
Now in ninety-three it's time to take the stand
And you know how I'm livin, I'm a bad, bad, man!

Everybody knows the flav
"I'm a bad, bad, man!" (cut and scratched 2X)

One day I was chillin, caught a buckshot
The nigga was butt, so then he gets no props
Word spread fast around town
I was layin six feet deep underground, check it
Niggas wished the worst, but spoke too fast
Cause here I am and I'm ready to blast *gunshot*
The cops must have missed, takin me for a bitch
Because they tried to gas me, and make me turn snitch
But I'm not the one for peace
So I turned around and said, "Fuck the police!"
I'm the type to handle this on my own
Pack two joints and pass one to Tone
There's no shame in my game, I do what I gotta do
See I'm rollin with a crazy live crew
Now in ninety-three it's time to take a stand
And you know how I'm livin I'mma bad, bad, man!

Yeah! Niggas know the flav
"I'm a bad, bad, man!" (cut and scratched)
Nuff respect to my man Jazzy J
Diamond D, Showbiz and A.G., and I'm out
Word

"I'm a bad, bad, man!" (cut and scratched to end)(Bad mutha)

[VERSE 1]
Turn up the radio, better yet the phonograph
And I'mma school the suckers who don't know the half
I'm not a legend, I'm real and actual
Bite my rhymes, I get mad and come after you
I don't front or pretend cause that's imaginary
I get funky with the use of vocabulary
I'm more deadlier than a bottle of cyanide
When I dig in my brain and say a fly rhyme
I might bust and say a little somethin
Get the party pumpin, yo, that ain't nothin
So don't bore me, I've been naughty
Even as a kid people said: "Look at shorty"
Back in the days I had much attention
Speak of competition - man, listen
Even then I've coulda been a funky star
At the age of 12 I was rhymin on them monkey bars
A little kid with the art of poetry
Nice for my age, but nobody noticed me
Nowadays I tell it like it is
That makes my skill different from her or his
I sport my skills on a F.M. frequency
Lettin people know you better not sleep on me
I'm known as a smooth cool brother
A funky technician, call me a (bad mutha)

[VERSE 2]
I play MC's like a game of Mario Brothers
I hold my own, plus I can carry another's
Rhymes I make strong and watch em take form
On a sucker who steps out his face wrong
I'm the MC to fear and run from
Shockin so much you think I'm usin a stun gun
I hold the title cause I'm the cool champ
If rap was money you'd be rated as food stamp
You try to boast and toast, you go by what name?
You can't get with Finesse, you're just jump change
You couldn't cut it even if you had a hack-saw
You're just a rap that I laid a track for
Cause records get mixed up, foes get ripped up
If a mic was a freak, I'd get my tip sucked
So girls, don't sleep, don't even doze off
I'm good with a mic, plus I'm good with my clothes off
And I'm no joke, far from a slow poke
I school the young bucks, plus school the old folks
I got stamina, lyrical examiner
Moppin, sweep up rappers just like a janitor
Lord Finesse parallel to no other
The smooth lover, and also the (bad mutha)

[VERSE 3]
At a show I get fly and so legit
Gimme a mic onstage and that's all over with
On a stage I'm straight up wildin
I can kick a party like a brother from the Shaolin
Temple, I find it simple
I get the ladies cause they sweat my dimples
Me take a loss? Not by a long shot
Get off the tip cause you jumped on the wrong jock
Of the wrong man put up on the wrong scoop
You got problems, what you're on, troop?
Raise up, I light the whole stage up
So wild with the mic, I oughta be caged up
I'm a brother you dare not lay a hand on
I leave you more bloodier than a tampon
If you split, I'mma get you later
Rhymes more fresher than a virgin in a frigerator
Take caution to what this brother say
Come correct or turn around the other way
(Bad mutha) is the perfect description
Of me rhymin or just plain flippin
I'm no joke when it comes around to that
I start flippin when I hear the sound of rap
I'm enhanced to keep in step with it
And surprise MC's cause you slept a bit
So wake up, my man cause there's no time for dozin
My thoughts are set, and a rhyme has been chosen
From my brain which makes me insane
To gain some fame, Lord Finesse is the name
To seek and blame cause I came and rearranged
My style of rap will make suckers wanna leave the game
I'm superior compared to others
Call me Lord Finesse, better yet make it (bad mutha)[Rasheeda:]
Yeah
Rasheeda... Baby
I'm a play around a little bit... like
Alright
Like [x3]
Okay okay
Look
I got that great, great
Fruity pebbles sweet
He running after me like a track meet
C'mon
He call me sushi roll, cause I'm raw as fuck
All ready supreme ain't gotta gas me up
My pillow talk game so superior
So I leave the store with every different color fur
BURR! Gucci Mane said it best
He's like my infant, keep his mouth on my breast
I'm SHEEDA SHEEDA, the Nicki Diva
And it gets wetter than, Lake Geneva
And then we role play
I just won an Oscar
Genius brains like I graduated from Harvard
Full scholarship... here swallow this
Sex education class
Let's Experiment
We make the bedrock
And holler many sounds
I keep him at attention it never goes down

[Hook: Kandi]
Ooohhh baby, I'm a put it down on you baby
Wanna give it all to you baby
Can you find my G-Spot, call me Mrs. Flintstones I can make your bedrock
Ooohhh
I can make your bedrock
Ohhhhhh
I can make your bedrock boy
Ohhhhh
I can make your bedrock
Ooohhh
I can make your bedrock

[Toya Carter:]
Independent now, used to have my hands tied
Now they after me I got a custom stop sign
It must be something bout my accent
Cause I say BABAY and niggas wanna pay a chick
Small waist, pretty face, and my booty round
Now he in my zone like a touch down
I don't need another friend, I need a team mate
With a big appetite eat the whole plate
Don't come around with that lyin I seen you before
You know damn well I got my own TV show (Yeah Baby)
Now that's some boss shit, I got my own everything
And I could put it down
Made him pull a hamstring

[Hook]

[Diamond:]
MRS 32
I'm Going In
Yeah
I can make your bedrock
It's 32 top notch
My Reese's pieces, buttercup got em playing hopscotch
Riding with the top off, I'm posing like I'm Janet
He UPS my pussy cause I'm on another planet
Got dammit she can't stand it
Cause he spoil me like he Santa
I make him ho... Ho... ho while we cruising in my phantom
He catching temper tantrums when he miss my fruit pebbles
So I sex him on the schedule just to make him feel special
I'm too spoiled and too royal (too royal)
So he spa's today and rub me down with oil
I came first he went last
It's Willie Wonka no hands
Baskin robin in demand
Still rocking no weeding ring

[Lola Luv:]
Okay he super fly
I just gotta tame em
Sit em down make him the shit, potty train em
I make him raise his hand, call me Ms. Monroe
I bless him like a reverend... I guess I run the show
I'm a front runner his ex a back rounder
All she do is throw shade like the MAC counter
American idol I'm shining now
They love to judge me
Sign me pound
Give em the diamond smell
I don't tell em shit
I replace bitches I'm on my Allen shit
It's like a melon split when I let em cut
He pop my fire hydrant then I wet him up

[Hook]

[Kandi:]
Come give me a Hersey kiss
Twist me up like licorice
Wipe my candle apple while I
Nibble on your dip stick
Every now and later you can be my sugar daddy
I let you break me off like a kit-kit-katty
Ooooooooooooo
You can chew on my big red while you try my lemon head
Don't stop
If I blow on your blow pop I can make your bedrock

[Hook][Diamond]
Uh, uh-huh.. yea
Dah dah (I'm skippin jump shit right here)
Dah dee-de-dee dah dah
Da-dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee-de-dee dah dah

[Verse 1]
It's me big D, the psychotic neurotic
Never catch me in the street without some green exotic
Fly-ass whip, pockets stay knotted
Step outta bounds and wind up red dotted
The socialite with the flows ya like
Overweight nigga dressed in the clothes ya like
Probably see me in the club with some hoes ya like
And you know I put it down when it's foes to fight
Can't fuck wit'cha love, if ya toes ain't right
I'm on some bullshit, but yo that's my chosen right
That's cool, cuz all I see is O's in sight
Drop shit that'll lift every nose in sight
Like I'm supposed to do - postin boo
Make you jump around like the Holy Ghost'll do
Let the words get close to you
I'mma show you how cats sleep, just like the most of you
Come on!

[Hook]
When it comes to spittin game I'm the best at that
One extreme to another like sex to crack
Beatminerz and Swing, do, and bless the track
And if the L's too short smoke the rest of that

[Verse 2]
I'm like, Triple H flying off the ropes
Bring a smile like some coke, fresh off the boats
I make, you and your boys take off ya coats
And if ya girl talks back, get her off the soaps
I'm like fuck you, see I'mma scratch ya name
On some big wheel shit, when I match the game
On the low chillin, with a hatch back in Maine
And I still run with niggas that'll snatch ya frames
Yo pardon me, you ain't catch my name? It's D-Moody
In the Four Seasons about to make a nudie
Used to see hard times, but now I see booty
And quite often, be up in the loft and
Fat asses, titties that are soft and, (*women laughing*)
Greened out so you might hear me coughin {*coughing*}
I'll make ya dumbass an off and
I'll be the one to put the nails in ya coffin {*hammering*}

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3]
You get a smack fuckin with this aristicrat
I'm the element that turns coke from this to that
You against me, it's like fightin fist to bat
It's gonna be hard to smoke when your ribs get cracked
Think of that - Come on if you think I'm wack
Me beatin yo' ass in a mink and hat
Bounce off from the scene in a Lincoln Nav
So motherfuckin plush you just sink in the back
And I told you heffers before, never before
Will you see a beatmaker ever this raw
See me in the streets stunning in a yellow Valor
Big D always leave the crowd yellin for more
One of the flyest big niggas you will see
If you can figure that black, you will be
Overcome with a mild case of lunacy
When I drop the LP nigga you will see...[Verse One]
You see I skip to my lou like Napoleon at Waterloo
My name is Diamond D, tell you what I'm gonna do
I dip and I dab like a Mike Tyson jab
Even though there's flab I possess the gift of gab
I shoot it like a jammy and girls give the panties and
Even with a fanny and I might win a Grammy and
Maybe I won't so I'll chill like the pope
See I'll never mope cause I know my shit is dope
Like Columbian fish scale, ask my man Ishmael
(Diamond D got props like a cop)
Or better yet DT cause brothers can't see me
Even your girl says you got a small wee wee
Now you wanna go upside her head
Do you feel intimidated by the things she said
Don't be mad cause I paid her back
(You know I) took her to the res and I laid her back
(I go) on and on like popcorn with the butter
A-a-a-a-yo! I used to stutter
But I fall on track and some may say I'm wack and
Fact, but in fact, I'm not any of that black
See I'm the best kept secret
So shut the fuck up and peep it

[Hook]
"Diamond D"... "Raised in Forest"
"Rapper tries to diss I crush the motherfucker"
(Repeat x4)

[Verse Two]
See I write my own rhymes, produce my own shit
Yeah boy, I ain't the one to fuck with
I'll take a beat and I'll flip it
With so much flavor, niggas wanna sip it
But that's cool cause they know I got skills
Let me demonstrate if you will, ahem
Rock is my man and so is Dapper Dan and
I'll shake your hand and don't try to flam
Or front like a stunt who lost her cunt
I only hit grand slams, never will I bunt
Bases are loaded, bottom of the ninth
I step to the plate cause I know my shit is great
I can't walk down the street
(A-yo Diamond, can you make me a beat)
You gotta have cheese, about a couple of G's
But if I know ya, I might just throw ya
A little something on the side, troop
A funky bassline and a hype loop
I got a thousand old records in my crib
I used to hustle but I never did a bid
Some people call me Jo Jo, I keep a low pro
Non-stop props, so act like you know bro
Pass me a mic and I'mma keep it
Yeah boy, I'm the best kept secret

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Yo, I'm deadlier than Michael Myers
My style will embrace you like a pair of pliers
But don't sweat it G, why don't you let it be
Cause Diamond D is a pedigree
In other words I'm official
I'll never go out like a wet piece of tissue
Ruff and rugged, stronger than Bounty
New York is the city, Bronx is the county
Learned from the best so the rest just fess
Now I'm gettin' booked at the Fillmore West
Located in the Village, so kill it, 'skillet
You ask yourself, will it ever cease?
Cause Diamond's sharp as a crease
I only use bees wax, I'll never use grease on my dreads
But instead if you want some kicks
Step to the mic I'm an 8 to 1 pick
You reap what you sow and I can reap it
Yo I'm the best kept secret

[Hook][Produced by Diamond]

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
When it comes to shit like this
I always get it right the first time
Playa haters and snakes waiting for mistakes
But that's the breaks, the highs and lows of the industry
D.I.T.C. and X to the Z
Get it crackin' to the third degree
Xzibit breakin' niggas down like H.I.V
We bring rap to your city like B.E.T
But still feel California is the place to be, catastrophe

[Verse 2: Tash]
The Alkaholiks is back to fry you extra crispy
With the skills that make the plots to try and diss me extra risky
Cause the time it takes to infiltrate and stop my forward motion
California will have broken off and fell into the ocean
Cause I rocked around the world with my ill type skill
Step for real or I'll leave your grill scarred like Seal
Cause I regulate the sectin where the drinks is getting blended
Certified bartender, go catch the 40 when I send it your way

[Verse 3: Xzibit
Niggas that hustle till the day light break
Go to county 20 times, till can't go straight
Don't nothing in the motherfucking world come free
I'll never see a nine to five cause it just ain't me
(It's like this)
Xzibit shall hustle, lift, build muscle
And think like Russell
Survive and bring it live and direct
To any crowd throughout the world like this
Come home and smoke a spliff in the Benz with Swift

[Hook]
[Xzibit]
I'm fucked up, J-Ro

[J-Ro]
Yeah, I'm fucked up too
Looking at these bitches from a bird's eye view
My name is J-Ro from the Likwit Crew

[Hurricane G]
So what nigga is it you wanna do?

[Verse 4: J-Ro]
My flow is metaphorical, historically correct
What do you expect from a nigga with my intellect?
East coast representing West coast gangsta
Nah, I ain't tripping, I call up King Tee, we go dipping
Through the streets pumping hardcore Likwit beats
Flowing air, blowing, lounging in them leather seats
Thinking back how we used to rock the house party
Now we just fucking it up for everybody

[Verse 5: Xzibit]
How dare you try to compare yourself to the original
Professional Xzibit break you down like correctional facility's
Limit all capabilities, motherfuck MC's
Hard to read like Japanese
I'm spreading like disease so I can't be stopped
By who you run with, your clique or the bitch ass cops
Xzibit's first LP, it hit your black like crack rock
I'm blowing up your spot by remote, instant cut throat

[Verse 6: J-Ro]
I"m from Cristal-ifornia, I warned ya I'd be on ya
I'm off the paint like velvet paintings, make your mama mourn ya
The Ro is outer national, cold as Henne-sota
I smoke 12 MC's a day just to fill my quota
From Fourty Ohio all the way to Ore-gin
Buddy, my fingers are bloody, now I'm Washing-ten
I clown from Brew-york down to Mai-tai-ami
I soak up game like a shamm,y understand me?

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Tash]
So Elizabeth it's MC's that's coming to join ya
Some will be from NYC and some will be from California
Cause I drop the lyrics on you from beneath the Earth's surface
Where I write rhymes so fresh I try to bite my own verses
Cause the purpose of my flow is to let you know
My style is badder than the water down in Mexico
Cause RICO blend styles like juice and gin
I got the Likwit shit that have you seeing double like the Twins

[Hook][Intro: KRS-ONE]
Music please
Yes, welcome to Jealous One's Envy
We'd like to thank you in advance for purchasing this product
It is a Relativity Records product, artist Fat Joe
My name is KRS-One
And of course we're gonna bring THE noise
Cause we can never be toys

[Verse 1: KRS-ONE, Fat Joe]
[KRS-ONE]
Yes I am the ultimate, uttering ultimatum's for the fun of it
It appears to me you don't know who you fuckin with
You can't see this with bifocals cause you're local
Can't hang with my vocals, better you fuck with Sonny Bono
Or Yoko Ono, but KRS oh NO NO
You might think you all that but I don't give a fuck though
I'm rolling hard like God for the squad black
Packin them poppers bitch, where that money be at?
[Fat Joe]
Aiyyo I be the show stopper, as I shine like gold
Other rappers dull like copper, the certified fake nigga dropper
Which borough, is the thorough
I know, do you know, let me know I'm sayin though
The coke connector, sweating leather with reflectors
Don't get caught up in my sector, or I'mma haveta inject ya
With a slab of this lyrical dope shit
Fake MC's and wannabe's best to quote this
Fat Joe the true and living will prevail
Kingpin like Sonny up in Bronx Tale
Will I fail? I doubt it
I'm the nigga catchin bodies, while other niggas fantasize about it
[KRS-ONE]
True indeed, behind my back MC's claim they can serve me
In my face they screaming "We're not worthy!"
Youse a has been, actually you ain't been
I be touring, while you be home taping
So what punk, you could battle in a second
Frankly the bottom line, is where's your hit record
You claim I'm jocking, claim I'm on your dick, where's your witnesses?
If I'm on your dick my name has got to be syphillis

[Chorus]
"If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck" - Jeru
"Up up up and away cuz I don't play clown" - Kool G Rap
"If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck" - Jeru
"Buck buck buck take that witcha on the way down" - Kool G Rap

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
As we proceed to lock it down, don't get it fucked up
We be the kings of the Boogie Down
All we do is spark izm and get cash
Tortuing MC's like that warden up in Alcatraz (bo! bo! bo! bo!)
It's Fat Joe, yo you know my steelo
Get so much love, I'm payin sixteen on a kilo
Sendin niggas outta town, still got control of the Boogie Down
Now how the fuck you sound? (Yeahhh)
Ain't no army that could harm me or bomb me
C'mon G you clowns ain't got a fucking thing on me
I'm flashy like white linen (tell em)
Your rap is under pressure like two outs tied score in the ninth inning
I'm down with Kris and ain't no stopping me
I'm out for Bronx and Monopoly with chicks on top of me
It's My Philosophy, but for now it's in the corridor
Slappin caps like a ball hittin hard to my laborator
These motherfuckers don't want it
(Word to mother Joe, these niggas don't want it!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Merrrcy, you wanna serve me but you ain't worthy
My style is too curvy, what you tellin me
But your flimsy ass will go home after the battle and find I'm your boss
With KRS-One up in your memory
I know your kind, you rap write
You're Mr. John Gotti the Don, but you're just another bwotty mon
Telecro bwotty mon, how you collect
Rap magazine dating back to, Tougher than Leather
The only reason you got, such an extensive rap collection
Cuz most of your rap mags are all stuck together
Watch what you sayin, watch what you say
When your skull gets cracked, whatcha gonna say crackhead?
Your file is dead, kneel to the rap God in bed
Fore I slap you way Back in the Days like Ahmad
Don't get me fed up, or vexed up, cuz you'll get set up
My crew don't let up, I be dead up in this piece (tell em)
Recognize it's BlastMaster KRS-One
For ten years, Fat Joe, chillin on the East[Verse 1: KRS-ONE]
Check, I control your mind with one rhyme I speak
And get you open like a prostitute's butt cheeks (yeah)
Rappers get kicked in they mouth with cleats
Cause they're speech refuses to reach beyond the beach
Have a seat quick (uh) I speak or spit flicks on your cheap hits
Time to complete shit, no weak shit, I mean freak shit properly
I can feel myself becoming a lyric monopoly
Others will copy me but repeat my shit sloppily
Shocking me with inclinations of rocking me
Insanity it got to be
My true identity is never meant to see
I simply use the gifts sent to me mentally

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Word up! Get from out my face, before you get bust quickly!

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
That's the hip hop, the hibby
I rip it in a minute cause I'm gifted like December 25th
Now let me flip I'm all knowing, lyrically syllable growing
Even when it's snowing, I'm party going
Free flowing and stomping! Never tip-toeing
Overthrowing the comp Big up Bronx!
I got more styles than the planet got women
I got as many rhymes as is many styles of women (tell 'em)
Don't make me come out on that ass start flippin'
Your mental I'm afflictin', actin' ill and sickin'
Pickin' the victim at random, slammin' 'em
Draggin' them to the stage and dismantlin' them
As my Hydrogen turns to Helium, I shine
None of your lyrics I'm feelin' 'em, you rhyme
Like you should be wearin' an apron scrapin' a pot with a name like Mariam

[Hook: KRS-ONE]
But rappers talk too much shit
And can't back it up with lyrics
Build ya skillz

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
It's time for the raw shit, not that on tour shit
That outlaw shit, that real hardcore shit
KRS runs shit like diarrhea
Bitin' motherfuckers hear my name and get up outta here
I don't care this year, a lot of albums is whack this year
"Will KRS bring it?" Ahh yeah!
Thanks for the invite, it's just about to get hype
That straight up raw street type shit is what it feels like
I will be displayin' lyrical styles I'm saying
Lyrical styles from the miracle child
Want a pile of ill styles wildin' on your stereo dial?
Smile, I been here for a while
Peep my style while I go on with the song
I rock the microphone then take it to the streets with the Krylon
Clicka clacka! clicka clacka
Take a spray can and slap a wack rapper!
Stacks of money for videos I don't have it
You're lookin' at the last MC with true talent
Get your tape recorder fast kid
Boombastic another classic
Turn up the cassette!
All my styles are lyrically fantastic and movin'
While soothin' any urges for booing
Ungluing your mouth from my private
The more the merrier syllable superior
East coast- West Coast battles are inferior
Cause I by myself will take out the whole North America
We need to expand rap beyond this land
Set up competitions with England and Japan
World cups for rappers that really fuck shit up for fun
Yeah I know I'll get one

[Hook][Produced by 45 King]



Yeah, going out to Showbiz, Whiz One, Lord Finesse
Jazzy Jay, my man Q-Tip, KX, yo check it out

Check one, two, no one to run to
I Catch-22, when I began to
Express myself on the lyrical tip
Ayo I'm dip and I'm as smooth as Mircale Whip
But some try to flip, and claim I'm not legit
Say I need to quit (Ayo he's on some other shit)
Yeah, but I grab your attention
And bask in wealth, ayo I'm something else
The sound is raw, don't need a million samples
The kids just love it, next year my budget
Will be much fatter, because of my platter
See I'm the flavor in the hip-hop batter
Schooled in the trade so I'm gonna stay paid
Made in the shade from the tracks that I laid (Wooord up)
Like the golden goose, and it's good for the gander
On the DL, don't need propaganda
So put that in your pipe and smoke it
I took a blues break and I broke it
See I'm swift with the words and the verbs and the pronouns
Yeah, it's Diamond D with the dope sound
That you hear when it's pumping in the Benzi
From ??? all the way down to McKinley
I pay the bills from the use of my lingo
Don't try to play me or you'd better play bingo
Or Monopoly, by Milton Bradley
I had to school another brother, but had he
Only took a second, and checked the track record
He would have seen that I'm solid
So gather round there's a new hombre in town
Influenced by James Brown
It's Diamond D with the sound that pumps
And like Bambaataa, I won't fake the funk
Peace to Master Rob and the Ultimate Force
The 90's are here and we're on the right course
With the flavor that you savor and you know that it's true
Check one, two

"Check one two and you don't quit" - Stezo (Repeat 4x)

Check it out
I get hype when I kick the ballistics
And get paid from the use of my linguistics
The style is dope even though it's simplistic
Soda breaks me out, so now I drink Mystic
At the rest I listen to the Stylistics
Break down rappers like they had cystic
Fibrosis, never snacking on a Hostess
Or pork rinds (nah) none of that swine
Word got around that my shit is booming
It ran through the Bronx just like Paul Newman
Now everyone can get a sample of the skills that
Won't trample when I build an example of the will that's
Stronger than Sampson, see I'm the champ, son
When I relax, I'm off to the Hamptons
Compare the sound to another, and let's see
I slam shit up like Wayne Gretzky
So hey baby, what's happening? (What's happening?)
Yeah, it's Diamond D with the verbs and the acronyms
"Sing a Simple Song" like Sylvester Stone
(And I) Catch you out there like Rick Cerrone
Mature enough to be on my own
And all my beats are stone to the bone
So grab a chair and sip on some ?choca batzi?
I stimulate your brain like a game of Yatzee
Yeah, the New Jack with the new rap
(How'd you do that, Diamond D?)

Beacuase their styles are full of words
By any name that you ever heard
I find it, quite interesting (You know?)
But it doesn't mean a thing

Yeah, I flip styles the way you flip a flap jack
It's Diamond D with the fat tracks
Originality, my concepts are endless
Straight up grit, I'm simply stupendous
My words hug the beat like a pair of vice grips
So don't sleep cause you might slip, peace

"Check one two and you don't quit" - Stezo (Repeat 4x)Yo, well it's Friday night, I just cashed my cheque
The weekend's here so my thoughts I collect
It's been a long week, but here comes the weekend
Time for girl seeking, should I hit the Beacon?
Or maybe the Apollo? Or should I just max in?
Take in a movie, hit the boom, relaxin
Couldn't decide so I just headed home
Pump the Walkman do on the headphone
Subway was packed, I couldn't find a seat
So I stood boppin to a Gangstarr beat
I'm in the last car so the buddha's in the air
Half an hour's passed, yeah I'm almost here
Got off the train, flagged down a taxi
A four dollar ride but he tried to tax me
Knew I wasn't havin it, I only gave him four
Got out the car then I slammed the door
In front of my building I saw my ex-girl
She had a knapsack on her back (Hello)
I said "Hello, what brings you around?
You used to try and diss me so don't say you miss me"
She said she made a mistake when she left me
For a kid whose pockets were hefty
And at the time I didn't have a dime
"So tell me what's on your mind?"
She said she wants me back, things will be fat
I said "Wait a minute baby, don't start attackin
Things have changed and I'm not hookin"
But she was still good lookin

[Hook]
I'm so confused
I don't know what to do
I'm so confused, baby
I'm so confused
I don't know what to do
About me and you

Invited her in for a chit-chat
She offered me a Stog' but I said I wasn't with that
We began to conversate, I started to unwind
"Can I take my shoes off if you don't mind?"
Thinkin of the skins and whether I should hit em
She's makin it easy, cos now she throwin rhythm
Rubbin on my legs, lookin in my eyes
While I was schemin, memorise all the lies
So I just sit back, crack a six pack
Hit the boom and grabbed a handful of Tic Tacs
Now's the time, no need to start fakin
Let's commence the love makin
On and on til the next morn
Pumpin all night like Exxon
Feelings of guilt began to sprout so I stop
And like "As We Lay" by Shirley Murdock
I forgot about tomorrow and now I feel shaky
I know I was wrong and it makes me
Think, what would I do if I found
That my main squeeze was the neighbourhood skeez

[Hook]

I'm up before the honey so I drinks some juice
Try to fight the feeling but it's no use
I thought with the wrong head, nuff said
Can't tell me girl, I know that's dead
When she awoke I tried to play it off and say
"I gotta go but baby come another day"
She said "What's the rush?"
"My feelings will be crushed, if you keep me on a hush-hush"
What am I to do, I'm caught in a bind
But I gotta make up my mind
I said it was fun and we can do it again
Don't want a commitment but we can be friends
She said okay but I could see she was mad
Lookin in my eyes, like the sea she was sad
I don't mean to hurt you and lead you on
Rapture of passion, champagne glasses
Reality sets in, so honey, let's indulge
In conversation for the duration
And we can get together at another time (Why?)
Cos now's too much on my mind

[Hook][Fat Joe]
Yeah.. uh-huh..
Chill.. hah, yeah..
C'mon..

I'm comin rougher than the roughest motherfucker could get
Playin' Russian Roulette, never lost a bet yet
Bluffin, ain't my style, niggas ain't sayin nothin
Cause I'm buckwild without frontin
Raw to the core, I grew up poor
Once I hit the door, I began to explore
Curiosity killed my cat, but not me
Because I learned how to kill with agility
I grew up in the South Bronx, punch you in your mouth punk
I know these streets like Fred Sanford knows junk
In the trunk of a car lays a body
Head decapitated, bust him with my shotty
Stabbed the mug, to make sure, he wasn't comin back
Now police, can picture that, with a Kodak.. huh!
They can't stop me with a homicide investigation
Cause if they do my crew is hittin up the station
Your best bet, is to let me jet
Cause I bring war, like a vet, when I'm upset.. huh!
I'm not the one you wanna play out in a program
Yo, you better tell them who the hell I am

"This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta" Yeah! (2X)
"This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta" Tell em who the hell I am
"This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"

[Fat Joe]
Now on the hip-hop tip, I'm no joke
Get live at a jam, and leave a system broke when I spoke
MC's froze, but I never said freeze
Hopin I don't hit em like a fucked up disease
Fall up in the club, Mr. Hype for a night
Choke a rapper with a cord, hang him from the lights.. huh!
Now you do wanna mess around with the Fat Man
Cause you see my face in every newsstand
Every other magazine from Billboard to Spin
Pick it up and read Fat Joe strikes again
How true, I'm not about weed and brew
I'm just another papichulo like the rest of my crew
So give me the microphone
This jam is dedicated to my main man Tone
Cause he flips, and I flip, and we flip the script
And you know, you don't wanna get your ass WHIPPED
Party over here, another in the hospital
Lincoln, Memorial, notice that's how I sent you, hah
I was the one who played the shoot 'em up games
Here's another patient, and yo what's my name?

"This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta" Yeah! (2X)
"This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta" Tell em who the hell I am
"This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"

[Fat Joe]
So I cruise around in the B-M
Or in the Benz, hurtin enemies and makin new friends
They shake my hand, smile in my face
The nine's in my waist, so there won't be a chase
That's it, the situation is blown out of proportion
When you leave, you must use caution
Look over your shoulder, even on your block
When I come to visit, you know you're in shock
So don't say who is it, act like you know
Kickin down doors is the Gangsta Fat Joe
And I got no time for games
My name is goin down in the gangsta hall of fame

"This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta" Yeah!
"This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta" Tell em who the hell I am
"This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"

[Fat Joe]
Yeah.. Fat Joe Da Gangsta
Representin in ninety-three
Peace to my man Diamond D
Peace out to my man Ski
This jam is ?letido?, ha hah[Diamond D]
Now its the mad magician with the ill deposition
No repetition holding down Bronx traditions
My compositions simply squash the competition
Step up and get beat into submission
Cause this musician with the street intuition
735 fuel-injected transmission
My opposition will have to recognize my steez
Exotic trees, leave a trail of scuffed up knees
So please you couldn't touch this cat with a stick
Quick to inflict tricks blaze up in the flicks
Son I'm sick and you could put that on my mama
Exclamation point, quotation, comma
Lay up on the beaches when I'm down in the Bahamas
The skills go back to the days of Wonderama
So pass the scama, son its time to get this money
So we can relax and recline where it's sunny

[Big L]
I went from standing on the corner selling cocaine
To ripping shows live on stage with hoes yelling my name
To be precise ripping mics is the light of my life
You fronting like you trife but never pulled a heist in your life
The price of my ice is sky high, I'm a fly guy
That's every thug's dream I really love cream, it's in my bloodstream
You mad cause I got more chicks than you, more bricks than you
More nines with extra clips than you
Where I live it ain't a nice town
You can't walk around iced down
Some clown probably getting stuck right now
Peace to D-I-T-C, Show and AG, Fat J-O-E
Diamond D, Lord Finesse, and me
I'm from the East Coast, this is how we roll in New York
A bunch of rowdy niggas holding the fort
Jacking creeps, packing heat, these Harlem streets is for keeps
Much love to all my peeps who got covered with sheets

[Hook]
Most these rap cats don't know where it started, where it came from
We been repping this shit since Day One
Digging In The Crates originators
Why niggas player hate us, knowing damn well you can't fade us

[A.G.]
You better take me out quick
Cause I'm accurate when I bust mine
And make it count like Jordan at crunch time
Just in case I play Fishburne and double up on nines
You could never make it rain or stop my sunshine
So I keep eyes on these chumps the whole time
Take note of your technique like we scheme on dimes
Disregard your crew, fuck your heart
Put a slug in me, it'll be marriage, til death do us part
Until then master this art and kill them
With the pen that's dramatic, automatics I commit sins
Hold my head, but when I've had it I test chins
If that ain't real then feel the stainless steel
Bang 'em and hang 'em like they did our relatives
Thought he was the best on the mic that ever lived? Negative
Wu-diggity if you with me then say word
Lets get twisted like bottlecaps [and] create like Spielberg

[Lord Finesse]
Check the referral, man my whole squad's thorough
We worldwide, niggas just nice in one borough
We all gleam, plus we fiend for more cream
You got some nice players, they just on the wrong team
Knah'mean? As the world turns
To who it concern we'll set you straight like a perm
Rap apostle, lyrical type Picasso, kinda hostile
Nothing less than colossal
You dig me like fossils, be the cat with the groovy soul
Lotta rappers out here acting with no movie roles
You know the deal, I represent skills
And niggas with bent grills that live to make a mill
On the real that's my motto, too hard to follow
Will die in sorrow before I'm going out like Gravato
Hard to hit like Lotto, underworld role model
D.I.T.C. we be them cats of tomorrow

[Hook]

[O.C.]
Holding it down for D.I.T.C, niggas stink like feces
Coming against raw dogs you're lost
The way I stimulate rhyme and rhythmatic timing
On beat, off beat, drunk flow here we go
Assignments handed out, each individual stand out
Carrying his own clout
Phenomenal Moses of rap I pose a threat
Foes I put 'em on a block like a hole in a pen
Lyrical genocide on the witty side
Niggas give me respect due, like the pope in a synagogue
Who weighing my odds? O.C. far from a fraud
You waste my time nigga so I bagged your broad
Blow your mind ditto with no conscience
I decide the law motherfucker I'm Congress
This concludes my repertoire of what I be on
MC's make way for mines or get peed on
Fuck that[Intro: Diamond]
And you don't stop, ah keep on (Repeat 8x)

[Diamond]
Yo praise the Lord for Showbiz
My partner with the beats with the Nikes on his feet
Buying old records is a habit
I get more run than a Volkswagen Rabbit
You know I gotta have it
I got more props than the cop called McGarrett
Who played on Hawaii Five-O
When I formed a production company with Show
And Jay's Studio is the lab (the lab!)
But the session is closed cause I know you got a big nose
Trying to sniff out the name
You lack originality, and that's a damn shame
Don't front, I know I got you open
Like a pack of tokens, yo I pulled your coat and
I'm not the one to be gamed on
I didn't know it was your girl we ran the train on
But no hard feelings, your girl was appealing
Did my share of dealing, sexual healing
You didn't know she was a groupie
But I'm a put you up on a scoop, B
Used to live in Forrest, my daughter lives on Morris
Used to play softball with my man Horace
I kick flavor like my man Sonny Chiba
Aries is my sign, I'm compatible with Libra
I like to program beats
Diamond D is out, I wanna say peace
Showbiz there's deals to make
So let's get busy and dig in the crates

[Showbiz]
Yo, thank Allah for Diamond D
No afro instead he keeps dreads in his head
My partner from the past, from 163rd
Back when I was a hoodlum beating on nerds
It started way back (way back when?)
About 12 years ago, I was 9, he was 10
Before smoking weed or hanging out or playing hooky
We used to breakdance in the jams, "Electric Boogie"
Girls watched jocking, my nickname was Rock and
Crowds I was shocking, freaks I was clocking
Step up and see Showbiz performing
My beats hit hard like big George Foreman
So MC's and DJ's who thought they was nice and
Get upset like Buster did to Tyson
That wasn't the plan and he's still my man
Since he beat up Mitch Green outside Dapper Dan
Wait a minute that's a different subject
Talk about the Moet and the papers that's in effect
Back to the Show, the Show B-I-Z
Down with D.I.T.C., A.G. is my MC
Relying on the Giant, the Giant I'm relying
Never crying for the crack because I'm not a crack client
Girls stick like Crazy Glue, they think they're getting dough
But I treat hoes like drugs, I just say no
I lamp in the residence I'm keeping dead presidents
In fact, I like my pockets fat not flat
A rapper not a singer, so hooker don't bring a
Problem to me, so go ahead you humdinger
Show's about to blow in '91 so I'm straight
Down with the crew called Diggin' in the Crates

[A.G.]
So get back, get your sticks and get your bats
Get your licks and I'm a still get fat
Try to diss and get the backhand
I'm dressed in black, a black hat for a black man
The Giant is better and clever
Go ahead and sleep, and you'll rest forever and ever
I'm like a bomb, sometimes I'm calm
No telling what can happen once the mic is in my right palm
Me and Showbiz too deep, but don't sleep
Go ahead and retreat or face agony of defeat
A.G. is in command
You remember the black hat and the bottom of my Timberlands
Save it, if you think you pose a threat
Just chill and watch how many hoes I get
Now you sweat the props I got
(Kick a rhyme) A rhyme? Sure, why not?
Always get fat to a hype track
So Finesse (What's up?) sike, give me that mic back
The crowd I'll capture, microphone master
Finger licking and kicking lyrics from here to Africa
I'm the bold kind, my rhyme's a goldmine
Let it off, set it off, just for old times
Think you're ready for this, you wanna battle
Your music is riddle raddle, your rhymes are scribble scrabble
The Giant is greater so I'm great
Down with the group called Diggin' in the Crates

[Lord Finesse]
Now when it comes to lyrics, mics I pulverise
It's Lord Finesse, time to go for mine
So stand back, let the men play
I put rhymes in shape just like Bengay
I'm great and honorable, suckers I bomb a few
I run more games than a carnival
I'm a get mine, as soon as you say start
Sweat hoods and funky rhymes is my trademark
I'm a get fame, not from her or his name
Cause yo (What's up?) I'm funkier than a shit stain
Mics I smoke, rhymes I hurl
My hobby is collecting fly-looking girls
Strictly for the ladies, call me Lord Finesse
And I'm all about money and sex
Finesse is the name to say, and I came to play
We could have fun, but put the whips and chains away
Sex and money is what makes me a happy man
And I sport more styles than Jackie Chan
I keep rising, I'm not the type to sink low
Me take a loss on the mic, I don't think so
Lord Finesse is out to make papes
Down with the crew called Diggin' in the CratesFeel the vibe (Repeat 7x)

[Diamond]
Feel the vibe, everybody gather round
I pull the plug, still my sound's profound
I had to take hip-hop back to the essence
Try to go commercial, gotta learn a lesson
You gotta get your fingers dusty (word)
And keep your ear to the street so you won't get rusty
Concentrate on the funk vibe (Funk vibe)
Learn your roots, put on your Timberland boots
I'm true to my art, I never fake a move
I keep your head bobbing to the psychotic groove
I vibe is erotic, contagious, and sporotic
I love beats so much I'm damn near neurotic
I shoot the gift like a Mack 10
And sample beats we used to cut way back then
But now the game has changed
Artist selling out just to make a name
The underground hip-hop fans can't stand it
So play like Chuck Connors, because now you're branded a sellout
So yo, get the hell out
We took a dive because you couldn't feel the vibe

Is this the vibe you desire? (Diamond running down the line)
Is this the vibe you desire? (You know you're on time)
Well let me continue with what's on the menu
I dug in the crate (Now it's time to get the papes) (Repeat 2x)

[Showbiz]
You know I feel the vibe, my name is Show B-I-Z
I used to cut at jams when I was 4 foot 3
Early in the morning listen to beats
And back then I was the shorty (With the Nikes on his feet)
Back to a brother who sold out (Did he?)
He aimed for a name and some fame without any doubt
He was my man so he let me hear a taste
But he dissed his face because the shit ain't have no bass
His beats was clogged, he needed Liquid Plumber
Damn I wonder why he sound like Donna Summers?
Or Nat King Cole, that style is old
100 G's up front you've just been sold
They kidnap your creative control
No chance of going platinum or even gold
It wouldn't happen to me (Why not?)
I got the skills that's ill and I'm real cause I feel the beat

Is this the vibe you desire? (Show running down the line)
Is this the vibe you desire? (You know you're on time)
Well let me continue with what's on the menu
I dug in the crate (Now it's time to get the papes) (Repeat 2x)

[Diamond]
Yeah, I knew a kid who was nice on the mic
Had a record deal but the deal wasn't real
Cause the record label wouldn't spend any loot
But he had a deal and my man got souped
He knew a lot of old beats but it didn't matter
The label had other ideas for the platter
I heard the song and I had to scream
The had him rhyming over hype drum machines
He didn't like it but he had no say
And now he's out of here today
Try to fake the funk, it couldn't shake a rump
But the radio played the junk anyway
But the song wouldn't budge
Now against the ex-label he holds a grudge
Looking for a deal because the song took a dive
Cause he couldn't feel the vibe
But who's to blame in the world of the rap game
Stick to your roots like a troop and let me know

Is this the vibe you desire? (Diamond running down the line)
Is this the vibe you desire? (You know you're on time)
Well let me continue with what's on the menu
I dug in the crate (Now it's time to get the papes) (Repeat 2x)[Fat Joe]
Ahhhhhhh yeah!
Da Fat Gangsta

Chorus: repeat 2X

You gotta flow Joe, you gotta flow Joe
You gotta gotta gotta gotta let em know Joe

[Fat Joe]
Bust it, check it, watch how I wreck it
Niggas watch your back, shit is gettin hectic
I catch vibes like Count Basie, sucker won't face me
I'm so much flavor you can taste me
I'm underground like a gutter
You never catch me - stutter, everybody knows that I'm butter
I'm not the man with sensitivity
The name is Fat Joe, the label's Relativity, huh
I chop a rapper like a meat cleaver
I'm burnin hot, people think I have a fever, check it
If niggas wanna front, then come widdit
If you're havin second thoughts, well then forget it, see
I dig in my crates, I don't per-pa-trates
I got shit sewn, like Billy Bathgate
Beware like Cocoa, yo I'm not a slow boat
Got so much dough I va-cate in Acapulco
Crazy as they come I'm not the one, we can do this
With the hands, or take it to the guns..
You know I can flow, the name is Fat Joe
I can flow, I can flow, I can flow

Chorus

[Fat Joe]
Yeah, yeah
Everybody knows Fat Joe's in town
Nuff respect for the Boogie Down
I'm livin in the Bronx on an Ave called Trinity
My name rings bells, within the vicinity
Peace to the money makers always plottin mono
Together we gettin dough, just like Lucky Luciano
People always tell me, yo you're dope Joe
But I'm not a car, so I don't get gassed like Amoco
Never ate the paint, no I'm not a sucker
Never liked ball so to Hell with the Rucker
Always on my own never sweatin nobody
Warm up a crowd like a bottle of Bacardi
I can kick it this way, I can kick it thattaway
I kick a funky style, from New York to Piscataway
Suckers best scram
Now in ninety-three it's all about the Fat Man
Peace to Finesse, Showbiz and A.G
Gizmo, Little Hec', and Kool Mike-ski (say what?)
My crew from Uptown
And if you mess around, then you'll catch a beatdown
See I got this in a smash
If a rapper steps up, he'll get smoked
Like a blunt full of hash
My style of rap is legendary
Fuck with the man, then you'll end up in the cemetary
And that's word to Ma Duke
I never fake moves, I'll go out like a troop
So act like you know, the name is Fat Joe
I can flow, I can flow, I can flow

Chorus

[Fat Joe]
Yeah
See I rip the mic if you put me to a test
Troop it gets so bad, I make you wanna wear a vest
Cause I'm too hot to handle
Knockin niggas out like ?Livingston Bramble?
Rappers come heavy, but yo I weigh a ton
I won't lose weight cause I'm not on the run
I'm on point like a sniper, hyper than the hyper
On the DL, overlooked by C-Cipher
Never get caught, I'm on top with my game
Flip a fat ride, there's no need for a train
Rappers come close, but they just can't make it
When it comes to the funk, you know I won't fake it
Peace to Serge, and my right hand Flex
And when I grab the mic nobody wants to rock next
The name is Fat Joe, cause Joe is livin Fat
Niggas gettin jealous cause I got a contract
But I don't sweat it, I know the style is raw
You can't compare me to a cornball
And you know I kick game like a hottie
Now in ninety-three, they should free John Gotti
If you step, battle and I'm gonna mash your toes
You know I got the flow

Chorus 1.5X
