[Verse 1]
Honey, I'm home! Where's my dinner? And this place is a mess
And less than adequate, marked with laziness and soap-opera watching
Clean it top to bottom now or face the consequences
Stop that sentence, I don't really want to hear your feedback
Smack the taste out of your loud mouth now
Sweetheart, the game is on and you just fouled out
How about a little affection thrown in my direction honey?
Yeah, I'm sorry for the way I yelled about the money that I lost
Gambling last night, but you must be on the crack pipe
If you think I'mma let a woman take that tone with me
And I know they cut the phone, see? But I wasn't trying to hear it
I didn't mean to break your face, I just wanted to break your spirit
And your arm the night before, I thought we agreed that was an accident
Now the neighbors called the cops on some old assault and battering
And I'm a man of my word and all my words got 4-Letters
The door is that way, but you'll never do any better than me
This is my house, I'm the man, I rule with the hand of fear
You don't like it? Get out! Now go get me another beer
Did I make myself clear? Don't make me say it twice
I worked a double shift last night and don't got time to play it nice
As for the lipstick on my collar, well that's my business
You're my wife and all that, but let's face it. You got your limits
You're dependent on this bread winner cause you're barefoot and pregnant
I'm a part of your life til I decide to make my exit...

[Hook 1]
He's the alpha, the top of the pile, the leader of the pack
You'll listen when he talks because he's got it like that
Matter fact he rules with iron fist, gripping misfortune
He learned to be a man from his father before him
Yeah, he's the alpha, the first person in every universe
Version 5.0 pack animal with blood thirst and stamina
The root of family trees where so many have fallen
He'll provide for your needs, but please proceed with caution
The Alpha...

[Verse 2]
Now I was called long ago to grow to be a man
And show the ones before and after me so maybe they could understand
And know the facts that with power, responsibility's attached
And the appropriate response isn't always to react
And attack the weakness of beautiful creatures cause we can't
It's our duty to implant wisdom and patience in our stance
And it's true that woman was made from man's rib, so oddly
When you sin against your wife, you sin against your own body
And an open fisted beatdown is never an option for mine
For she was made in God's image, so I'm inclined to put her desires
And needs before me daily and see my lady as a queen
Her submission is a calling that isn't enforced by me
Cause I'm free from a GQ, Maxim, Playboy establishment
Christ is the man I strive to be like and that's no accident
My dad implanted the fuel and the means that I found vital
If your father was a deadbeat or absent, you can break the cycle
Take the Bible and tradition and follow the map accordingly
Spread the answers I've found around the world
I'll firmly lead my household and display emotions openly
And show my people what a real man's supposed to be...

[Hook 2]
Cause I'm the Alpha, called and destined, the leader of the pack
I'll listen when you talk because I've got it like that
Matter fact, I'll protect you with my life because I love you
And carry you on my back through everything we have to trudge through
The Alpha, first person in every universe
Version 6.0, sacrifice my body to the dirt
I challenge Alpha Males to change so you can see
A man standing there where a boy used to be
The Alpha...[Verse 1: manCHILD]
I vent my anger on you strangers that I've never even met
As I employ endangered medium of recordable cassettes
To audibly connect, it oughtta be correct
Tattoo my name on your eardrum to make sure you don't forget
My faith and art that I protect leaves heads twitching like Torretts
As I vomit my opinion over volatile soundsets
Project through drums pounding, dumfounding the shallow
And keeping true heads smiling in the shadows
Baffle you with battle-tested methods from a distinguished master-linguist
Extinguishing the meaningless rhetoric and jargon
Leave the wack missing in action, their picture on milk cartons
As my tongue burns like arson, opponents begging me for pardon
No crates stacked with records with my picture on the cover
But that's far from the point at hand on one had to the other
From foreign sands to your motherland to your dreamy wonderland
ManCHILD spits so rap fans can understand the Son of Man

[Hook]
In stadiums with packed stands or just you and your mans
This jam is for the real rap fans
ManCHILD commands where you stand from Japan to San Fran
This jam if for the real rap fans
From NYC down to where the ATLiens land
This jam is for the real rap fans
Urban lands, desert sands, rock wherever you can
This jam is for the real rap fans

[Verse 2: Sharlok Poems]
Lyrics of steel, my flow heavy as anvils
Thoughts spread long and wide as cotton fields
Many play hard make me scream Actors guild
Bad actors getting killed first episode of the season
Stop rhyming for one reason cuz the ink pen stopped bleeding
Prick your finger the needle and start thinking
Into crowd I'm sinking, stage diving for the rap fans
Speak mine across the land like Robert Gaines with aerosol cans
Truth from mouth expands like rubber band being snapped back
Many crews are called wack because rhyme skills they lack
From the mouth words drag like dog with broke back
I'm floor bound, thumb tack off the walls with mine
With divine heart soul and mind and my mic skates
Numbers of souls saved climbing like Cali's crime rate
Like these record crates, flipping through beats rhymes and life
Sharlok Poems and manCHILD for rap fans delight

[Hook]
In stadiums with packed stands or just you and your mans
This jam is for the real rap fans
Sharlok commands where you stand from Japan to San Fran
This jam is for the real rap fans
From NYC down to where the Californians stand
Urban lands, desert sands rock wherever you can
This jam is for the real rap fans

[Verse 3: manCHILD]
Fanatics buying records like the junk was pornographic
Fly rhymes get you higher than an addict in an attic
Don't stop for red lights and the mic directs the traffic
Climb Everest just to see the best correctly stab it
Blood, sweat and tears for years because you gotta have it
Mother hip-hop sticks my lyrics to the fridge with a magnet
So fat when I bust raps, the doc told me to cut back
But I make tracks for all of you cats and you don't want that
The backpack assassins, fatty marker taggin
Black and Anglo Saxon, any race you can imagine
Holding down your area to start a chain reaction
The fans deserve a hand cuz you made rap the main attraction
If you listen for the love and you're sick of all the babbling
I rain down like the weather, bring the pain like a contraction
Clearer than cellophane on plexiglass style
It's Sharlok Poems and soul heir the manCHILD
While the wack stack grands and don't care if you clap hands
I take a stand and make a jam for the real rap fans
Take a stand and make a jam for the real rap fans
Take a stand and make jams for the real rap fans

[Hook x 4][Hook]
That which is done that will be done
And nothing is new thats under the sun
That which is done that will be done
And nothing is new thats under the sun

[Verse 1]
I buried my possesions in the name of poverty
Because its got to be vain so I adopted modesty
Honesty the quest for knowledge through the questions I ask
Through the concepts I grasp threw wisdom out the window
Collecting four by the kilo put in straight into my steelo
Said if they knew what we know they would be enlightened people
I've seen the works of master builders that I've wanted to do the same
Raise a temple to the clouds and dedicate it to my name
But emceeing is my claim
Putting up the heads to shame
I want to be like David Stern and make the people love this game
But its vain plain and simply as my footsteps echo simpty
The rhythm of my inners beating gently left me empty
Any endeavor that sever the absolute Christ
The boards of life thrown into the calamity avanty
I stand to be in judgement for every act
Even the ? understood that I don't choose to chase cyclones
See I've shown up on the mic and crushed a few emcees to dust
Late at night come on reflection in a fit of disgust
But He is Just and Just wants to defend you from sin
You failed to catch the gail forces when you try to chase the wind

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What's the purpose of life anyways
The mile of junk that there is and this is it
Get placed here against my will even before I had one
Dropped out of nowhere and forced inheirly to survive
And given the name son
Me I'm sad about the uselessness this world has for me
Programmed to view life in the way
In which I won't be happy unless I have everything for me
But I can't be whole
What do you get if you collect everything the world has to offer but forget
All about your soul
Its all the same everyday for years and years
Around this one you get made get born grows up then soon you having your son
Who's got to go through it all agin
Programmed to worship all the trends
Trying so hard to be everything to every friend
Son seek life seek the truth and pray that God will open your mind
These are all basic instuctions you must look and then you'll find

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
How what when where why
Sometimes I wonder man run your plan to your brother man I'll try to understand
State your case all the things you face rappers lie two ways
Will you take us to new places or are you on a paper chase
It makes my day when original thought blesses the game
But pretty much the cycle turns again and everything is the same
Beneath the rays of the sun until the last day is done
Its a freeway of replays no matter where its from
Some think its new but I can feel the deja vu
If you beleive it or you don't that doesn't really make it true
What was and will be since the Ancient of Days I AM
Mics play but we forget to give the praise
You're wicked ways aren't original yo you learned it from the serpent
Confirmed it on my knees that you'll come clean then detergent
You can't hide like a hermit and buy your future from a merchant
You reep what you sow and your destiny you earn it
Kids still getting murdered seems the trends are everlasting
The rich are getting richer and the times forever passing
Shape times I jack your lives and the world is still collasping
So where you's ever after thats the question that I'm asking[Verse 1]
He sits in the barrel's bottom
Apple rotten, roach infested alley
Starting fights with every Harry, Dick and Tom with broken snapple bottle
Gladly crawling back to underneath his rock and
Roll the dice with prostitutes and thieves
Who smoke his filtered brand of breath of life
He left his wife for every night
She kept him from these glamorous rights
Of passage now each bite he takes just keeps him famished
Damaged seasons turn the leaves black
And the winter burns the skyline
Time and time again, talked to God
And asked the sun to shine again
But see, he wants a quick response
Right now, he's used to fast food
Doesn't realize the chick with the tattoos
Will fit the glass shoes
Now it's a minute after midnight and his riches back to rags
Back masking records on his phonograph as he holds his flask
Yelling "you don't know the half!", track mind that got distracted
And when he punched you in the face, perhaps he just over-reacted
Blast the music, let him lose himself in each and very measure
He just wants it to get better
He just wants it to get better

[Hook]
It's just another hustle
It's just another lonely night
Just another day of shuffling his feet and living his life
It's just a harsh reality that nothing comes for free
He's just another couple steps from where he needs to be

It's just another hustle
It's just another lonely night
Just another day of shuffling his feet and living his life
It's just a slap in the face to let him know nothing's for free
He's just another couple steps from where he needs to be

[Verse 2]
She stands on the platform, glances at the headlines and wait's for the train
Just for fun she looks at strangers tries to match each face with a name
Hears a bum placing the blame on the government so she laughs
To herself, looks to the glass, and watches the city fly past
It's been a long week, maybe tonight she'll meet Mr. "What's the difference?"
At some local social breeding ground, there's no need to get needy now
Sees these clowns and imagines the dimensions of her companion
Tonight could be Mr. right, could just be that last man standing
She's got "independent woman" tattooed in bold across her shoulders
The sole controller, but she still likes someone to hold her
She sees the bottom of the glass now, drinks too much and blacks out
Wouldn't surprise her too much to wake up inside of a crackhouse
Packs two in a bed with a stranger, pack of cigarettes and a lighter
Just before she matches a name with his face as he lies beside her
Burns a cancer stick or two before she gathers her things together
Yeah, she wishes it was better

[Hook]
It's just another couple weekends
Just another couple bars
Just a notch upon a bedpost, just a wish upon a star
Just another couple heartbreaks till she finds just what she needs
She's just another couple steps from where she needs to be [2x]

[Verse 3]
He steps right through that door
Drops his bags and his heart on the floor
He embraces her embrace till she can't take it anymore
Puts his faith in her face waits to exhale that first kiss
Pale from the wishes he'd get back for all the memories that he missed
The blistering pace that moves him cross the globe to God knows wherever
Never knew he'd have the daisy-chain those loose ends back together
Never knew love like this, never knew sacrifice before
It's his first chance to pass his life out at your local record store
Holds his lifetime in his arms then he kisses her goodnight
Wipes the dreams from his daughters face to let her know that she's all right
On his flight, grips tattered edges of a picture framed in fingerprints
A single glimpse of innocence, and a 60 second phone call seems infinite
All said and done wrong, gone in an instant
For the man with physical form who's heart beats with the speed of an infant
Typical storm weather with an aftertaste, adrenaline letdown
After the show, 3 hours of sleep, see how far that we can get now
Get down to business, get the crowd hyped, get the party started
Get back home to his wife and show these people where his heart is
He pities the heartless, the man who can't see each tree for the forest
He masterminds the revolution while he's takin out the garbage
Drops his carcass in his favorite chair and wonders if he can make it there
He looks each brand new day square in the face with a vacant stare
He lays it bare on the records to pull this whole world back together
He just wants to make it better

[Hook]
It's just another couple days
Just another couple shows
Just another couple hundred miles on this road
Just another "i'm sorry baby till I set these people free"
I'm just another couple steps from where I need to be

It's just another couple days
Just another couple shows
Just another couple hundred thousand miles on this road
Just another "i'm sorry baby till I set these people free"
I'm just another couple steps from where I need to be

I'm just another couple steps from where I need to be [4x]Dear Dad, the class began, hands were held and arms were open
Moments stolen from the globe and life's blood was always spoken
One was chosen for another. Broke my will against your wisdom
Pushed my face towards the light so I could cultivate the vision
Made decisions for the unit. Hard times, you moved us through it
By each word and every movement, you're the one who showed me what truth is
Thanks for the blueprint passed down. I'll grip it by the cover
Plus you showed me how to love my wife by the way you treat my mother
And Mom, you sacrificed your body, scarred beneath the weight
To usher my soul into the universe, human contact, you were first
Through the worst I had to offer, caught his mercy in your stare
You were there. Patched my wounds an protected me with your prayers
Gave me food when I was hungry. Gave me love when I was empty
Gave me a look of knowing solitude when I said where God would send me
Thanks for the days and the nights, the laughter and the fights
Teaching me wrong from right, Mom, the first woman in my life
To my brother, thanks for the beatdowns and the harassment
In you I learned to express my views with heated passion
Followed your footsteps good or bad, so please get the facts straight
My big brother introduced me to this and gave me my first rap tape
I watched you grow up, thrive, prosper and self destruct
Find the jewel in circumstances that sucked but still you stuck
A husband and a father, a brother and a son
Kevin, I'm so proud of the man that you've become
Pam, Jeff, Billy, Cliff, Paine, David, Terry, Chris, Ricky
The names stick with me, the names stick with me
Jason Lee, Ben Heaton, Josh Cleveland, Eric Sartain
Trent Gibson saw the best and the worst I've ever given
Sintax, I'd bend back the sky and shift the balance
I thank you for your strong mind, your friendship and your talent
You're an example to all that witness cause there's no "I" in crew
You inspire me brother cause I can see Christ in you
Dust, where to start? The art's answer to my question
Blessed from lessons together that's always led to progression
This profession needs your genius to show cats what it's about
You keep making the music and I'll keep running my mouth
Playdough, Harry Krum, enough heart for every alias
Thanks for helping me carry the torch as we take these kids
Listener, Illtripp, Fred B, Recon
Rabbi, Manuel, Sev Statik and Sivion
It's on until we change the face and finish what we started
I'm thankful that you're all a part of this
Yeah it's on until we change expression, finish what we started
Deepspace5, it's never stopping
Mary, I don't have the words to get across my feelings
I breathe a purer form of oxygen when I'm staring at your face
I can rise above my limits and break through this vaulted ceiling
I'm a better man today because you occupy my space
I hit the road, you hold it down and shun the glory
I'll be the mouthpiece for your heart and I'll tell the world our story
Thanks for bearing our children. Thanks for sharing your life
Thanks for saying, "Yes," May. Thanks for being my wife
To my daughters and all unborn and future seeds
I look at the world through your eyes and you always help me see
Inspiration in your innocence and the future in your face
I write these songs so I can make your world a better place
And that's all to say that all that I am is a collection of souls
That God has used to touch me. Changed a reflection
Made a man from a simple stick-figure
And if I've ever met you, then you helped him paint the picture..

[Repeat 3X][Verse 1]
I got seven ways to say something different
If you're allergic to the truth, then I suggest you keep your distance
Plug your ears and listen to the sound of a hard heart
Whose trust was pulled one too many times by these card sharks
I spark a charge that darts across the charts
Set far apart from the garbage they're calling our art
I start a lot of controversy. Afraid that we're dissing you?
From the big willie cats to the underground and miniscule?
Honestly, it's anyone polluting the subliminal
If that's you, retribution is unconditional
I'm willing to commit career suicide
If I know that it could fill all your emptiness inside
But I'm confident that top-billing and ripping the veil
Is my job and heart throbs with all it entails
Can't fail, found success when feet hit the trail
Dues paid? Yes y'all, check's in the mail...

[Hook]
It's all about timing and it's about time
To get inside your spine and change your state of mind
You waiting for the music that you need to remember?
Forget all the rest, cause that's when we enter
Right about now, we step into your space
Run up on your intellect and look you in the face
Are you tired of being lied to? That's all we're asking
It's time for a change, Mars ILL, enter the dragon...

[Verse 2]
We did a show but nobody showed up
We did another couple. Ten people came to show love
Not trying to blow up, just need to make this music
Can't explain it. It's just like I'm breathing when I do it
Keeping muted's not an option. It's more like a death wish
Got verses trapped inside and I gotta let them exit
The curse I'm blessed with, I consider very precious
Proceed with caution. This could crack your solar plexus
Next, we did a few hundred shows in a row
Hit the road time and again and watched the revolution grow
Keeping it moving to help you establish what's what
Watch the masses mouth the words to "Sphere" and "Love's Not"
Wait at the bus stop with agenda in hand
Yelling, "Bust shots in the air, not into your fellow man!"
Tell a friend, tell a foe and I'll tell a few of mine
We can change the whole world one soul at time...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
M-A-R-S-I-Double L
Rocking the bells, so go home and tell
Everyone on your block we got records to sell
M-A-R-S-I-Double L
M-A-R-S-I-Double L
Rocking the bells, so go home and tell
Everyone on your block who taught you how to spell
M-A-R-S-I-Double L...

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you talking loud, but you ain't saying no thang
Throw slang across the map and watch both coasts change
Grow fame one step at a time. Start with no name
"Breathe Slow" banging in the front row sang by
Everyone who came to the show, change the old game
See everybody doesn't flow the same
So take your gold fangs and fronts and say what you want
But understand that I've held your number from the jump
It's something sort of resembling your new favorite record and rap group
Grab raw skill and toss it at you
Get under your skin like a tattoo with permanent results
That's provided you have a pulse
Full of useful information on life, love and hatred
Learning from mistakes, the breaks and proper placement
Knowing when to dish it out and knowing when to take it
God is the answer when all else is makeshift...[Verse #1]
It's a common theme. The world is monotone and mean
It's grown into a full-blown bag of bones that holds reserves of self-esteem
And it's worse to melt a dream away with nothing there to replace it with
Smashed hopes never heal and when it peels away, his faith is stripped
The paces trip the walk and talk is cheap but still in stock
Public outrage screams for justice, looting shops and killing cops
The wheels can't stop because it's downhill and the music's up to loud
Fingers plug their ears, now shouts rang out and reason's not allowed
Believers got too proud cause we held the magic backstage passes
Now they act like fascists, blocking all the gates to heavenly access
And that's just when the package has no doorstep left to land on
Blacklisted seekers wander wondering what it means to be transformed
They can't see because the pastor's lingo wasn't made for their people
White-collar congregation makes contributions to his ego
And it's evil and it hurts and it tears us all apart
And I swear a man can blind you with the blackness in his heart
The shattered parts of speech are hard to reach in times of need
The cuts are deep, but I can't bleed unless I think it helps you see
I'll stand against oppression although they claim it sets me free
Cause even when I'm speaking life I know that death is deaf to me..

[Hook]
Gather in together where the sky meets the basement
Gotta make the world a better place where you take it
Face to the sunrise, feet to the pavement
Walk everybody, just walk, walk
Gather in together where the sky meets the basement
Gotta make the world a better place where you take it
Face to the sunrise, feet to the pavement
Walk everybody just walk, walk...(Repeat)

[Bridge]
Go for the uprise, huddled in the playground
Cuddle the women and kids. Tell 'em to stay down
Fellowship with anybody willing to work
Then sell a bit of land between heaven and Earth
Catalog the converts. Carry cross for the crippled
Bury every soul that falls anywhere inside the middle
Bang your head against the backdrop. Block out the bad thoughts
Cut out the trash talk, ready for the blast off
Bang your head against the backdrop. Block out the bad thoughts
Cut out the trash talk, ready for the blast off
Bang your head against the backdrop. Block out the bad thoughts
Cut out the trash talk, ready for the blast off..

[Verse #2]
I wanna be a better man. I wanna strip the flesh from spirit
I wanna write the songs that people sing that inspire them to be fearless
Never changing my appearance for moments edited and altered
Full of awkward things to say today for the lucky seventh caller
I've considered every offer on its merits before I refused it
And that's mainly on the basis of their generic brand of two-cents
If there's land beneath the cruise ship, then it's time to rock the boat
If your label is a nuisance, then it's time to let 'em go
If it's time for execution, make sure to protect your throat
If you're losing your grip, hold tight to the end of the rope
If you're broken or you're broke, take a breath and count your blessings slow
It's feast or famine. Sometimes you starve, sometimes you choke
Sometimes you think, sometimes you know
Sometimes you pay, sometimes you owe
Sometimes it burns a hole inside but you're too proud to let it show
Reap or sow, keep breathing slow because we need to know the difference
There's a time to walk on the sun, but there's a time to keep your distance..

[Hook]

[Bridge][Verse 1]
Honey, I'm home! Where's my dinner? And this place is a mess
And less than adequate, marked with laziness and soap-opera watching

Did I make myself clear? Don't make me say it twice
I worked a double shift last night and don't got time to play it nice
As for the lipstick on my collar, well that's my business
You're my wife and all that, but let's face it. You got your limits
You're dependent on this bread winner cause you're barefoot and pregnant
I'm a part of your life til I decide to make my exit...

[Hook 1]
He's the alpha, the top of the pile, the leader of the pack
You'll listen when he talks because he's got it like that
Matter fact he rules with iron fist, gripping misfortune
He learned to be a man from his father before him
Yeah, he's the alpha, the first person in every universe
Version 5.0 pack animal with blood thirst and stamina
The root of family trees where so many have fallen
He'll provide for your needs, but please proceed with caution
The Alpha...

[Verse 2]
Now I was called long ago to grow to be a man
And show the ones before and after me so maybe they could understand
And know the facts that with power, responsibility's attached
And the appropriate response isn't always to react
And attack the weakness of beautiful creatures cause we can't
It's our duty to implant wisdom and patience in our stance
And it's true that woman was made from man's rib, so oddly
When you sin against your wife, you sin against your own body
And an open fisted beatdown is never an option for mine
For she was made in God's image, so I'm inclined to put her desires
And needs before me daily and see my lady as a queen
Her submission is a calling that isn't enforced by me
Cause I'm free from a GQ, Maxim, Playboy establishment
Christ is the man I strive to be like and that's no accident
My dad implanted the fuel and the means that I found vital
If your father was a deadbeat or absent, you can break the cycle
Take the Bible and tradition and follow the map accordingly
Spread the answers I've found around the world
I'll firmly lead my household and display emotions openly
And show my people what a real man's supposed to be...

[Hook 2]
Cause I'm the Alpha, called and destined, the leader of the pack
I'll listen when you talk because I've got it like that
Matter fact, I'll protect you with my life because I love you
And carry you on my back through everything we have to trudge through
The Alpha, first person in every universe
Version 6.0, sacrifice my body to the dirt
I challenge Alpha Males to change so you can see
A man standing there where a boy used to be
The Alpha...[Verse 1: manCHILD]
It's the beginning of the 9th inning and I'm winning
You'll find me mind-bending inside of each five-minute time limit
And it's documented, we're breaking bones of contention
Fine tuning what's spinning and expanding my dominion
These upper-handed dimensions all contributed to the folklore
Got rappers raising their standards, fans demanding what they'd hoped for
Cramming letters in a bottle. We'll just call it a test tube
My style is Aristotle mixed with Krush Groove (So Just Move!)
And watch my verses cut through when you hear the words I Love You
Break off a piece of my heart tucked into every record groove
And you'll walk different in these corrective shoes
But you'll recognize the revolution and act out what most don't get to do
You'll take what's meant for you, no longer survive on what they pass down
Win or lose, you'll live your life knowing you never backed down
Cause man shall not live by the bottle alone
I keep a fist raised to the sky so you can follow me home, it goes?

[Hook]
If you know like we know, BREATHE SLOW
BREATHE SLOW?(Repeat)

[Verse 2: manCHILD]
Until my body cracks the pavement and shakes the face of the basement
Lacing the foundation with scars that sacrifice is bound to leave
Break inner-city boundaries so suburbanites are down to see
This cultural way of life and how music is more than sound to me
But freedom's lungs are heavy from pushing these smoke signals out
And we've become so disillusioned that we're scared to notice
The eviction notice speaking its clout with screams and shouts, but trust me
Clarity's waiting there on the other side of your focus
So snatch the breath from blasphemy emphatically
Transform naturally, control the art before it masters me
Breathe slow and hold the hand of whoever you can reach for
Touch the ones you've never seen before 'til the common good is restored
'Til the homeless are all execs and capitalism yields to ethics
'Til janitors live in mansions and schoolteachers can push a Lexus
'Til beef is deaded and debt is erased or collected
'Til the projects and country clubs are now and forever connected
I'll speak my messages 'til they get it
Until you're touched by something sacred and love is all that you're left with
Blessed is the head that shares the crown that he possesses
Consider yourselves my brethren and this song is my confession
Cause man shall not live by the bottle alone
I keep a fist raised to the sky so you can follow me home
And all your problems can't be solved by one call on the phone
I keep a fist raised to the sky so you can follow me home, it goes?

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jax and Flux]
Right before you rock a show, BREATHE SLOW
When a promoter owes you dough, BREATHE SLOW
When your career doesn't blow [up], BREATHE SLOW
You bounced five checks in a row, BREATHE SLOW
If you're tired of being po, BREATHE SLOW
You can't see the status quo, BREATHE SLOW
You got more cons than pros, BREATHE SLOW
You got fisticuffs to throw, BREATHE SLOW
Ayo, your boss told you no, BREATHE SLOW
Say Mars ILL told you so, BREATHE SLOW
You gotta suffer to grow, BREATHE SLOW
Shine your light until you glow, BREATHE SLOW?

[Hook][Verse 1: manCHILD]
I push my pen past the breaking point, the point of no return
Past the pointed fingers, past the point at which you learn
Past ideas and perceptions, past lies and deception
Pass my life around the room to try to make the right connections
My obsession is this; past cash, past crime
Past beats, past rhymes, past life and past time
After time, time is money, time out, timing is everything
Your mind's my forty acres, on these fertile plains I'm settling
I'm steadily gold medaling in peddling what's the truth
Point my finger to the heavens and grip the heart to break it loose
I'd bear my soul to save the youth and place myself upon the altar
Make this world a better place both for my wife and for my daughters
And that's a hard lesson to learn, because mankind's so unkind
Like political prisoners who threaten the agenda of One Time
One rhyme can't change the world, so make no mistake
And that's just my point.yeah, that's the point I'm trying to make

[Hook]
One rhyme can't change the world, but sill I'll never back down
Speak my peace on microphones and fade into the blackground
What's wrong has prospered too long, it's time to take it back now
Write what's right upon walls and fade into the blackground

[Verse 2: Sintaxtheterrific]
Sintax the backlit shadow box backdrop
Silouette of the sunset across the concrete blacktop
Bet He's more brilliant and beautiful than we thought
Burn fame on the fingers of flame from sunspot
Then bask in the black where the spotlight's not
Mic rock late at night so nobody can watch
Some serve in daylight, Christ taught behind the scenes
So I caught his sunstream with the sea of the unseen
Humility sunscreen, I thank God for anonymity
My geneology is a forest of family trees
More branches than a bank, thank you's to pass around
Put gratitude on paper, extend my words like verbal pounds
Remember my past like people in small towns
Regard simple truth and profound, then write 'em down
I've found I like to watch autumn leaves just fade to brown
They turn without a sound, I'd like to fade into the blackground
Then drown the well renowned, pound my pride until it backs down
Clown myself just so that Yahweh can abound
Soul Heir the manCHILD and Sintaxtheterrific
We ripped it for a lifetime, but we'll vanish in an instant
Blink once and you missed it

[Hook]
What's wrong has prospered too long, it's time to take it back now
Write what's right upon walls and fade into the blackground
One rhyme can't change the world but still I'll never back down
Speak my peace on microphones and fade into the blackground

[Verse 3: manCHILD]
I build this lifeline in the nighttime, hide my presence in this place
Anonymity's a witch, but I've grown acccustomed to her face
And it's broken, camouflage my emotions, chosen token
Spoken to those cold and frozen and watched new life awoken
Got that close to closing notion, overdosing on the ocean
No one knows this unsung hero, the dirt that makes the tree grow
But it's all right, I'm a peace in the puzzle like Bill Cartwright
Programmed to command the mic with deepspace5 all night
I'm the fly on the wall who's watching each and every bar fight
I'm the brick wall backdrop that's decorated in the starlight
Mars ILL, we do battle deep in the belly of the beast
And as the b-boy backspins, we be the cardboard that's beneath
See this wedding of art and science and let's all live and grow together
I'll choose to keep the memories and you can choose to buy the records
Maybe make that life better, leave that soul no longer vacant
And let the prejudice skeptics keep warm with blanket statements
With patience I set my paces on city streets of Atlanta
While my people being slandered by that false propaganda
Got answers, got questions, gotta teach and learn lessons
ManCHILD spits one rhyme and it tastes like sunshine
Holy, divine design, peace to the nines worldwide
Play my part to perfection and softly fade into the B-side

[Hook]
One rhyme can't change the world, but still I'll never back down
Speak my peace on microphones and fade into the blackground
What's wrong has prospered too long, it's time to take it back now
Write what's right upon walls and fade into the blackground
Refuse to be pimped into a record label's cash cow
Speak what's real upon reels and fade into the blackgroundDear Dad, the class began, hands were held and arms were open
Moments stolen from the globe and life's blood was always spoken
One was chosen for another. Broke my will against your wisdom
Pushed my face towards the light so I could cultivate the vision
Made decisions for the unit. Hard times, you moved us through it
By each word and every movement, you're the one who showed me what truth is
Thanks for the blueprint passed down. I'll grip it by the cover
Plus you showed me how to love my wife by the way you treat my mother
And Mom, you sacrificed your body, scarred beneath the weight
To usher my soul into the universe, human contact, you were first
Through the worst I had to offer, caught his mercy in your stare
You were there. Patched my wounds an protected me with your prayers
Gave me food when I was hungry. Gave me love when I was empty
Gave me a look of knowing solitude when I said where God would send me
Thanks for the days and the nights, the laughter and the fights
Teaching me wrong from right, Mom, the first woman in my life
To my brother, thanks for the beatdowns and the harassment
In you I learned to express my views with heated passion
Followed your footsteps good or bad, so please get the facts straight
My big brother introduced me to this and gave me my first rap tape
I watched you grow up, thrive, prosper and self destruct
Find the jewel in circumstances that sucked but still you stuck
A husband and a father, a brother and a son
Kevin, I'm so proud of the man that you've become
Pam, Jeff, Billy, Cliff, Paine, David, Terry, Chris, Ricky
The names stick with me, the names stick with me
Jason Lee, Ben Heaton, Josh Cleveland, Eric Sartain
Trent Gibson saw the best and the worst I've ever given
Sintax, I'd bend back the sky and shift the balance
I thank you for your strong mind, your friendship and your talent
You're an example to all that witness cause there's no "I" in crew
You inspire me brother cause I can see Christ in you
Dust, where to start? The art's answer to my question
Blessed from lessons together that's always led to progression
This profession needs your genius to show cats what it's about
You keep making the music and I'll keep running my mouth
Playdough, Harry Krum, enough heart for every alias
Thanks for helping me carry the torch as we take these kids
Listener, Illtripp, Fred B, Recon
Rabbi, Manuel, Sev Statik and Sivion
It's on until we change the face and finish what we started
I'm thankful that you're all a part of this
Yeah it's on until we change expression, finish what we started
Deepspace5, it's never stopping
Mary, I don't have the words to get across my feelings
I breathe a purer form of oxygen when I'm staring at your face
I can rise above my limits and break through this vaulted ceiling
I'm a better man today because you occupy my space
I hit the road, you hold it down and shun the glory
I'll be the mouthpiece for your heart and I'll tell the world our story
Thanks for bearing our children. Thanks for sharing your life
Thanks for saying, "Yes," May. Thanks for being my wife
To my daughters and all unborn and future seeds
I look at the world through your eyes and you always help me see
Inspiration in your innocence and the future in your face
I write these songs so I can make your world a better place
And that's all to say that all that I am is a collection of souls
That God has used to touch me. Changed a reflection
Made a man from a simple stick-figure
And if I've ever met you, then you helped him paint the picture..

[Repeat 3X][Verse 1]
I rock spots with top-notch communication
On time like a stopwatch while others keep me waiting
Pop lock to a beat box while taking potshots at hard rocks
Who got their Glocks cocked and what not
Flocks jock the man in the drop top that cops stop
Yesterday had the block locked, but then he got knocked
Talk chops like the microphone's their home
But their ideas, their style and their life is monotone
In a flashback, it's all real instead of abstract
Should have been your own man instead of following the rat pack
Taken this instead of that path, calculate on that math
The writing's on the wall, graff style with cans and fat caps
The wind blows where it wishes, snakes are still vicious
World struggles for riches, rap lyrics still explicit
I kick it with the gifted, but everyone will miss it
They praise the man who built on the sand, but then it shifted
It's fatter than a lipid, we befriended the infinite
The cat who lived it, died, arose and then ascended
But heads still get lifted, they hear it then forget it
But they'll want to change their minds when it's finished

[Verse 2]
FM Radio is D.O.A., B, it's plain to see
It's N'Sync and LFO instead of NKOTB
It's all the same, CC your A&R ASAP
And tell him MTV really ain't the place to be
See, I did some R&B when most where high on THC
And caught a vision in the form of Run DMC and BDP
Because KRS was the one before VH could get in line
Behind the music, but today it's really the music that's behind
I find T&A on NBC without a question
So I tune into PBS to try to teach my child a lesson
Cats run weapons from Route 66 to the BQE
I push my beliefs over beats in encoded mp3's
I praise G-O-D for the O2 I get to breathe
And for the way he reads my heart and my mind like ESP
You communicate collectively, but still you're all alone
Your world minus the most high is monotone[Verse 1:manCHILD]
If the eyes are the windows of the soul, then the mouth is the door
Where the pieces exit freely way beyond your control
And they’re not yours anymore, walk tall in bent stride
And propaganda lies on the gentle side of genocide
Words are used, broken, twisted and misquoted
The gossip was probably true the first time somebody told it
And slander’s just a well-intentioned public exposition
That should have been handled man to man as something different
The bum decisions are done and repeated like that
Bite my tongue in half as an example of how to fight back
Write raps and raise a family, build with the like-minded
Honor hides itself in strange faces, I’m always glad to find it
I’m reminded of the wonder of this world in which we live
How we kill ourselves to have but find freedom when we give
Climb reason and forgive in a quest for all that is
I’m standing right beside you cause this is where I live

[Hook x2]
I’m the voice in the distance, the image in the foreground
Don’t have much, but what’s mine is yours now
Can’t put your finger on it, but you’ve seen me around
Wherever you’re at, I’m just a couple doors down

[Verse 2: manCHILD]
It’s like 4 in the morning and I’m still here
Wasn’t til 3:45 that I started thinking clear
Concern, anger, sadness, and now my heart is blinking tears
Take these necessary steps til my art can reach my peers
I’ve abused my voice so much that it’s hard to sing this year
And my own songs can’t echo in my set of ringing ears
Pages filled top to bottom with confidence and stinging fear
That no one understands what I speak and they can’t hear
So I’ll say it twice as loud and I’ll mean every word
Can’t keep it in my mouth until their peace is disturbed
From the least to the first, we can see where you hurt
And we dedicate this now, every beat, every verse
Every breath, every thought, every prayer, every stage
Every show, every moment, every night, every day
Everything that we say and everything that we do
It’s dedicated to you, it’s dedicated to you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: manCHILD]
The moments that I’m walking through affect the way I talk to you
And this is what I’m called to do, it’s almost like I’m stalking you
You’re tired of falling through the cracks from all the broken promises
And it’s tough to hear the voice of reason through these busted monitors
And as honest as I am, I can’t hide behind the façade
I just wanna bring my people a little closer to God
If I’m martyred on MARTA, it was probably my time
But we’re here now, hands on, transforming your mind
So if I ask you how you’re doing, don’t smile and say, “Fine”
Cause it’s written all over your face homie, and I ain’t blind
Me and mine, we spill our guts, cause without it, we’d go nuts
The music is therapeutic, so just let it pick you up
And hold you tight, move a little closer to the light
Be careful when you listen cause it might just change your life
And when you see me in the supermarket, just smile and say, “Hello"
And add me to the list of all the people that you know

[Hook x2][Verse #1]
I'm the explicit version without the illicit cursing
I sit atop these radio-friendly missing persons
A diversion from the 9-to-5 grind that you've been working
An answered prayer, we strike the match that keeps desire burning
This perverted graduating class is looking for the backdoor
It goes disco, ska, neo-soul and rapcore
Collision cracks a smile on a pile of shredded documents
There's only so long you'll piggyback on our accomplishments
You tried to say that it was virtue versus common sense
Guilt trip, that's all it is, so swallow pride and call it quits
The vaulted lips can fall off with the crabs in a bucket
In a land of rusty logic and 500 dollar budgets
But I can't believe the hype. See it's not the way that I'm programmed
I read between the lines and fingertips when you fold hands
In five years, they'll know what I know and you'll have no fans
And I'll still be making classic records as an old man...

[Hook]
If you know the words, you can sing these songs
And keep your hands to the sky so I can read your palm
We break it into pieces so all ears can listen
Gather the scraps together, build a whole new composition

[Verse #2]
There's a lot of politicians and lottery tickets selling folly
Parlor-tricking hollow promise breaking hearts and wallets
Economics downtrodden. The stock market is struggling
And all the sorrow's packaged up and Fed-Exed to the government
Subsidizing happiness, mandate what you believe in
But knowing's more than seeing now we're choking on the freedom
That we're breathing, and we all take a beating
When we treat God like a distant cousin cause we're so ashamed
And faith is more than Sunday School and sermons on the weekend
Speaking loud and pointing fingers and deciding who's to blame
Blatant accusations knock fam out the frame
I write the way I write because there's power in the name
And Christ is not a catch phrase or bumper-sticker tag line
It cheapens what He did and who He is to all his people
We're on different pages of the same book. Believe me, that's fine
Just don't get offended when Dust drops the needle...

[Hook]

[Verse #3]
Too hot for TV, radio, magazines and movies
Put in work off the clock while the sign reads "Off-Duty"
Sign verses, "Yours Truly," pollute the stream of consciousness
I'm calling public libraries and begging 'em for sponsorship
I'm the type of guy that's real easy to get honest with
Never mind the fact that in rap I'm like a monolith
The archetype pondering breaking the bonds that hold us
In a monstrous move that's reminiscent of the Kold Krush
Mold my will 'til it resembles divine covenents
Share the cup of Christ inside of this blessed suffering
Divide my publishing so the word can spread and scatter
Over every inch of global territory much faster
Cast lots for a chance to advance my point of view
In an avalanche of rap fans and it all starts with you
If all hearts could do their part beyond what we feel
We'd make it in one shot. But for now, we'll do it piecemeal...

[Hook][Verse 1]
It's there and it's here, it's far and it's near
All my hopes and all my fears are manifested in the sphere
It's distorted but it's clear, it's my enemy and my peer
It's as wack as radio rap and it's doper than Premier
It's all of what you see and it's all of what you hear
It's Def Jams, it's So So Def, it's On Def Ears
It makes you cheer and lets you chill, it saves and it kills
It's unbelievably creative and it's run of the mill
It's fake and it's real, it's politics and it's skills
It takes up all my money, but it pays all of my bills
Still it's simple to decipher and difficult to discern
It's hip-hop, it's paid in full, it's hard to earn
It's you must learn and I got it made, it's who's the man
It's brothers gotta work it out, it's parents just don't understand
It's overblown and underhanded, Pacific to Atlantic
Watching all your dreams get shattered and all your wishes granted
Where ignorance runs rampant and knowledge reigns supreme
Where loyalty's highly regarded but everybody switches teams
It's closet aficionados and It's microphone fiends
It's where we say what we mean by any means for Elohim
It's all that you despise and everything that you hold dear
It's war and peace, it's this and that, it's hip-hop and it's the sphere
It's all that you despise and everything that you hold dear
Yin and Yang, it's love and hate, it's hip-hop and it's the sphere

[Verse 2]
It's up and it's down, It's free and it's bound
It's sight and it's sound, it's mainstream, it's underground
Profound and common sense, it's past and present tense
It's dollars, it's cents it's guilt it's innocence
It's bent and it's sober, it's on my mind and on my shoulders
It's the Bronx, it's Queensbridge, I forgot, the bridge is over
It's New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Minnesota
It's hip-hop, it's even freaking North and South Dakota
It's contained within my headphones but still it blows my speakers
It's big willie wannabes and it's Poor Righteous Teachers
It's living for the moment and it's dying over nothing
It's we're all in the same gang and it's headed for self destruction
It's tougher than leather, it's no one can do it better
It's ripping a freestyle and it's your writtens to the letter
It's a sling and a stone and it's fully automatic
It's the sphere of hip-hop, peace to PlasticYo, yo...yo it's the sphere of hip-hop part 2. soulheir the manCHILD and dj dust for you and you and you and you and you....yo, and you, too

Yo it's this and it's that
It's hype and it's flat
It's white and it's black
It's abandoned and it's packed
It's backpackers, it's wack rappers
Beat jackers, chip stackers
But thank God it's microphone masters
It's after, it's before
It's rich and it's poor
It's local open-mic nights, it's international tours
It's four tracks, it's demos, it's six-fours, it's limos
It's drug-free, it's indo
It's wives and it's bimbos
It's what I love and what I loathe
It's battling, doing shows
It's turning on radios and hearing about cars and clothes
It's the rise, it's the fall
The boo's the yes-yall's
It's all in together, it's now and it's forever
It's day and it's night
It's wrong and it's right
It's full blown promotions and it's "Don't Believe the Hype"
It's five mics, the limelight
It's eternal, it's finite
It's obscure genius and record deals when you can't rhyme right
Yo, I chase it and it follows me
It's popular, it's a mockery
It's "My Adidas", my advice, my radio, "My Philosophy"
It's permanent, it's moving
It's showing, improving
It's in everything we're saying, it's in everything we're doing
It's hell-bent, heaven-sent, it's what you represent
It's "F the Police" and it's "Eric B. for President"
Yo, it's evident, it's hidden
It's your freedom, it's your prison
It's the sphere of hip-hop, and it's the place where I live in (yo)

(gimme a chance man, I know I can rock it)
(sounds like hip-hop)

Yo, it's off and it's on
It's pros and it's cons
It's dusk and it's dawn
It's word up, it's word is born
It's word life
It's blunt but it still cuts like a knife
It's primetime, it's outta sight
It's "You Gotta Fight For Your Right"
It's all right and it's outstanding
It's sitting and it's standing
It's "Come Clean", explicit content, wal-mart banning
It's fans sing the lyrics
It's loud, but most can't hear it
It's in demand, it's on clearance, it's the cameo appearance
It's "The Breaks", it's The Show
It's Doug E. Fresh, it's Kurtis Blow
It's your words, it's your cadence, it's your style, it's your flow
It's the beat, it's the kick, it's the snare, it's the street
It's the way that I speak, walk, sleep, pray, and eat
It's concrete schoolyards, hard-rocks, it's hard-knocks
It's Freaky Tah, it's Big L, it's Biggie Smalls, it's 2Pac
Yo, it's acappella scratches
It's old and new-school classes
It's 3rd Bass, "The Cactus"
It's age-old and it's matchless
It's peace and it's anger
It's your friend, it's a stranger
It's the B-boys, graff painters
It's the 36 Chambers
It's the DJ, turntablist, the maestro, the producer
But don't forget it's the 1980's pop singer looper
It's true and it's false
It's play and it's pause
It's perfect, but it's flawed
It's hot and it's raw
It's Hold it Down, and stay fly
It's what, where, when, and why
Yo, it's hip-hop, and I gotta rep it till I die

(gimme a chance man, I know I can rock it)
(sounds like hip-hop)

(well, I have this bad habit)
...
(sounds like hip-hop)[Verse #1]
It's a common theme. The world is monotone and mean
It's grown into a full-blown bag of bones that holds reserves of self-esteem
And it's worse to melt a dream away with nothing there to replace it with
Smashed hopes never heal and when it peels away, his faith is stripped
The paces trip the walk and talk is cheap but still in stock
Public outrage screams for justice, looting shops and killing cops
The wheels can't stop because it's downhill and the music's up to loud
Fingers plug their ears, now shouts rang out and reason's not allowed
Believers got too proud cause we held the magic backstage passes
Now they act like fascists, blocking all the gates to heavenly access
And that's just when the package has no doorstep left to land on
Blacklisted seekers wander wondering what it means to be transformed
They can't see because the pastor's lingo wasn't made for their people
White-collar congregation makes contributions to his ego
And it's evil and it hurts and it tears us all apart
And I swear a man can blind you with the blackness in his heart
The shattered parts of speech are hard to reach in times of need
The cuts are deep, but I can't bleed unless I think it helps you see
I'll stand against oppression although they claim it sets me free
Cause even when I'm speaking life I know that death is deaf to me..

[Hook]
Gather in together where the sky meets the basement
Gotta make the world a better place where you take it
Face to the sunrise, feet to the pavement
Walk everybody, just walk, walk
Gather in together where the sky meets the basement
Gotta make the world a better place where you take it
Face to the sunrise, feet to the pavement
Walk everybody just walk, walk...(Repeat)

[Bridge]
Go for the uprise, huddled in the playground
Cuddle the women and kids. Tell 'em to stay down
Fellowship with anybody willing to work
Then sell a bit of land between heaven and Earth
Catalog the converts. Carry cross for the crippled
Bury every soul that falls anywhere inside the middle
Bang your head against the backdrop. Block out the bad thoughts
Cut out the trash talk, ready for the blast off
Bang your head against the backdrop. Block out the bad thoughts
Cut out the trash talk, ready for the blast off
Bang your head against the backdrop. Block out the bad thoughts
Cut out the trash talk, ready for the blast off..

[Verse #2]
I wanna be a better man. I wanna strip the flesh from spirit
I wanna write the songs that people sing that inspire them to be fearless
Never changing my appearance for moments edited and altered
Full of awkward things to say today for the lucky seventh caller
I've considered every offer on its merits before I refused it
And that's mainly on the basis of their generic brand of two-cents
If there's land beneath the cruise ship, then it's time to rock the boat
If your label is a nuisance, then it's time to let 'em go
If it's time for execution, make sure to protect your throat
If you're losing your grip, hold tight to the end of the rope
If you're broken or you're broke, take a breath and count your blessings slow
It's feast or famine. Sometimes you starve, sometimes you choke
Sometimes you think, sometimes you know
Sometimes you pay, sometimes you owe
Sometimes it burns a hole inside but you're too proud to let it show
Reap or sow, keep breathing slow because we need to know the difference
There's a time to walk on the sun, but there's a time to keep your distance..

[Hook]

[Bridge][Verse 1: manCHILD]
Double down stroke, pound my head on concrete til it cracks
Double take, doubled over from this double cross on my back
Doubled my pleasure and pain with the quickest double timing
On the double, single out these cats that's having trouble rhyming
Triple threat vet, set it straight while rookies muddle through
Just call me the 23rd letter because I double you
Knuckle through other crews with jabs, hooks, uppercuts and combinations
Patience, you can't get inside the levelheaded throroughbred
The one who sets the foundation for movement like a riverbed
Don't subscribe to gun talk, so I give a what what your trigger said
Spit leaded graphite, keep my heart in my hand so that I can grasp life
Police the depths of my soul with a billy club and flashlight
That's right, the underworld has numbered my days
The track plays as I stumble across the stage
And rage against my rage in the sight of fleeting time
Because it's not the grapes of wrath that produce the sweetest wine
I bleed rhymes when I'm wounded, seems to happen more and more
Lie face down in a puddle of my own metaphors on the floor
And my heart pumps the art, so what will happen if I pass on
They could never last long, so the band plays my sad song

[Verse 2: manCHILD]
Soul Heir the manCHILD 2001, dead on arrival
Skin beneath his fingernails points to a struggle for survival
Clutching doubles of his vinyl with rigamortous in his throat
In his mouth, we found the words for the greatest song he never wrote
He was stabbed, choked, hung, burned, drowned
Strapped to the ground, forced to listen to thug rap gagged and bound
This manCHILD took hip-hop where no one else could take her
For that he was dragged for 40 blocks behind a Lincoln Navigator
Until it crashed into a pacer, flipped and landed on his neck
Blasting Gloria Gaynor's "I will Survive" from the tape deck
A blank check inside his pocket because you can't cash respect
In a word, his dental records spun at 33 1/3
Keeping his word through pain and death through static and distortion
Defeated 333 emcees post mortem
So, check your local listings to see his body on display
Soul Heir the manCHILD survived by his family and his DJ

[Verse 3: manCHILD]
Look through the eyes of a manCHILDless world so I can see
I don't like the way my beloved artform looks without me
A barren wasteland, artists afraid to face fans
Where they seek and destroy b-boys, forbidding them to breakdance
Where no one takes a chance because the patterns stand in place
Follow the formula, play the part, and you'll get more than you can take
Where they raise hell to be a man and no man searches for the answers
Without me, it's all just hype men, dat tapes, and back up dancers
Hold my banner for knowledge, wisdom and understand integrity
Every city Mars ILL goes, I leave another piece of my legacy
And if I thought ya'll would benefit, I'd paint manCHILD out of the picture
They fall and keep it to themselves, so I'll stand and deliver
Consider this, I understand this game is hit or miss
Whether graf writer, b-boy, turntablist or lyricist
This is serious, like water to a flame, Abel to Cain
If you stopped doing what you do today would hip-hop stay the same?
If your name never graced a marquis, what are we losing?
If nothing changes in that world then tell me, what's your contribution?
Do you emancipate enslaved minds, or you just want to feel free?
It's not easy, but manCHILD's here because you need me[Verse 1: manCHILD]
The black market, where blue blooded emcees split red seas since it started
Where beyond gold and platinum is the target
Rockin it with real skill leaves greenhorns green with envy
And rappin about your cherry red Benz still seems empty
Where blue collar rhyme sayers really mean what they be speakin
And the cat you rhyme behind's not donned by yellow streaks and
Every week at open mics we paint the clouds with silver lining
Perfect rhymes can't be achieved, but every moment is defining
On time to spray your mind with some surrealist imagery
Plus feed 5000 emcees with a single simile
I got a metaphor, like just introduced to quadruplets
Most heads want more, so I expose them like a nudist
Yo, you're Alicia Silverstone type clueless to the fact
That we bring El Shaddai to cyphers at points all across the map
So black, take it to my chest, you know I'll bring it back to you
The black-market, be white hot, or leave here black and blue

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Underground is the sound of rebirth
So my turf keeps me locked down with the Godsound under earth
While I'm destined for the sky, Adonai is the target
Still I can't escape the Black Market

[Verse 2: Playdough]
Deep into the black record crack while I'm incognito
Disguised for surprise dressed down in tuxedo
With the mushpot, Christ and hip-hop I'm steady jugglin
And bargainin the jargon in the Church where I'm smugglin my rhymes
That's the crime so they label me a criminal
Now people in the steeple gotta keep rap subliminal
Or unseen and heard not a word to the pews
They fear the ill tattoos, plus my check one twos
Nevertheless I press, keeping raps righteous
They wanna test my effervesce, cuz it's so effortless
On metronomes, their fleet can't defeat my poem
I circle the globe to make the whole world my home
But cancel that, this is only the place I travel at
So I'm wandering sound for holy ground habitat
Where the rabbits at? Under the earth working my phono
You searching for your crew while I'm flying Han Solo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ManCHILD]
I call shots like a referee, fighting for your destiny
Sound the reverie, settle the score like a refugee
Selected pedigree when I rock so steadily
And then burn the ideals of the world in effigy

[Playdough]
While me and Freddie B. are more underground than they could ever be
We're reverently riding blue skies we're seeing seldomly
From pushing envelope with cross hairs and scope
Locked onto the bullseye, so watch it as I pull my

[ManCHILD]
Hollow tipped scripts come equipped to spit darts
I'll take my shot in the dark, it ain't a walk in the park
Finish to start, these cats are still jacking the art
But me, I dominate the market that's as black as their heart

[Playdough]
Inside the ventricles, I flip it around to make receptacles
And fill with Mars ILL Harmonic is apostolic
And intercede, so you no longer bleed the night
I'm chasing shadows in sound battles, filling markets with light

[Hook] - 2X[Manchild]
Push the panic button, pull the plug nickel
Any rapper laughs about us make a thug giggle
Take a pick, pretty oenny shine swiftly
Spit it in a minute until the piggybank's empty
Atlanta need a title, let's call Mark Rifkey
Underground king like Pimp C
If I'm wrong, convince me
I'm considered a first in twenty entries
High on living life so I don't need your sense
Many men popping pills, feeling sickly
Trying to battle me with a bull pin back committee
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, ti's easy to fall behind
Starey eyed, slap a hand cock on the dotted line
It's not a game, but we all got bits to play
The Price Is Right for Whose Line Is It Anyway?
Anyday is your time to shine pal
Everybody's waiting to find out, find out

[Hook 2X: Manchild]
We see beyond the rain
We might be gone today
Can't be too strong to change
Can't be too strong to change

[Manchild]
Wide open, excelerator is pinned down
Devestate the champ, when I went the decision of ten rounds
Scratch out, we knock em out in a minute flat
Inify the pulse with a concentration of killing rap
Steal your heart and than give it back
Put some teeth in the love, sew it up with a big DUST gorilla track
Then Cappadonna got some fire to breathe
Slow burn desire push up your lighter to see
Manchild rep a power that is higher than me
Get right whenever I spit any night of the week
It's like freak to the rhythm, hit em right in the teeth
And bleed all the wisdom till it fights a disease
I got peace of assistance for the liers and thieves
Or give Christ the envision that I'm trying to be
When a strong sense of innocence silents the weak
And minds of the apostles still die in the streets
But the spirits gon shine till it's flying and free
Till the top of Mount Zion to the highest degree
I got peace of assistance for the liers and thieves
Or look at Chirst at the vision that I'm trying to be

[Hook 2X w/ Cappadonna ad-libs]

[Cappadonna]
What, yo I take over the land like the four ???
Put the hop in the game like Chi-Ali
Got flies on my face like Somolian kids
Pop off when I'm ready like I'm doing the bid
Straight ghetto in the slums where my peoples is
Turn to Cappadon, never too strong to change, I get it on
Cut em off at the corner, make me go long
Turn the beats up like ?Deja Rashawn?
Never wack when I enter, my game is tight
To the iron chmabers of death and you don't wanna fight
Diggila, keep darts under the fitter
Me and my dula Manchild, we like our style
Came back to the hood, how you like us now?
Got chicks on the regular, driving them wild
Changing the game on ya'll, keep a low profile
Holla back at the kid, we can take it to trial
Got God on our side and ya'll living foul

[Hook 2X][Hook]
Heads rush and faces blush when the fader gets touched
There's not much time to rhyme and sometimes it's not enough
Touch mics, touch Christ, when we speak life through songs
It's tough to touch lives and then to have to move on

[Verse]
I'm breaking the monotony, give heads frontal lobotomies
My melody is harmony, thoughts darker than mahogany
I'm letting the rhythm hit 'em with pendulum swings I'm thinking
Break the maximum down to minimum, these battles, I'll keep winnin 'em
Vocal ships I'm sinking, sendin 'em home with pink slips
Taking their jobs in the interim, sign autographs with ink tips
Delinquent micro-marathon, the dawn of information
Hyperventilating on smoke signals from my nation
Pacing myself like Reggie Miller while I'm taking
Shots at the oppressors, politicians, pimps and pagans
Breaking promises to children only leads to broken dreams
We take it back to the beginning and stay fly by any means
It's like a chemical reaction when we enter your subliminal
In NC-17, Restricted, PG, or General
Collapse your ventricle, you'll live again, begin again
Call your Congressman in Washington, say, "it's not about the Benjamins!"
It's interesting, they start what they don't intend on finishing
They think nobody's listening, they're screaming like Sam Kinison
Remebering my rent, I stretch my pennies to a nickel
My mind drifts to Galgotha to see the man in the middle
See some are fickle, they stick you, shoot you down like a pistol
Grip, grapple mics like a shackle, down and ready for battle
I dabble in what you like, extend the boundaries of sound
Dialect with derelicts and give the homeless a pound
In all this found fans and I hope they understand
Does the man control the mic or does the mic control the man
In all this found fans and I pray you understand
Does the man control the mic or does the mic control the man?[Intro: manCHILD]
What was that?
Oh, jack, yeah, yeah, my name's jack
Yeah, that's me
Yeah, i'll tell you about it
I don't know if you really want to hear about it
But you know i'll tell you about it since you asked
Just got to find a good place to start
Right here, maybe the beginning, right
Right here, right here
Yeah, yeah, yeah right, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: manCHILD]
I think i can remember it
Don't mean to sound ignorant
Just need a minute to picture it
It musta been, yeah, ok, it's all coming back again
The time and frame of mind are all things i've gotta factor in
It was on a back road, i skated off the two-lane
Tried to light a cigarette but my lighter was lacking butane
And the one in my old pick-up truck has been busted for eons
When the engine died that evening, no piston to lean on
I was less than surprised, i sat and rested my eyes
But the cold it chilled my bones, and felt like death in disguise
Started hoofin' it, lookin' for farmhouse with arms out
Finally felt what loneliness is all about
If ya'll doubt the next part of my story, well it's ok
You're not the first, but i swear up and down that it's all true and it's not rehearsed
I was walking through a clearing, a pasture, an open field, a meadow, a..
Yeah alright, ok, i guess you know the deal
How was i supposed to feel? i saw the flashing all well
Some moth-man prophecy, area 51, roswell
Event horizon, ufo sighting, my stomach sinking back
Looking at the spinning hovercraft without no strings attached
Jaw dropped, frozen, not knowing who i’m seeing
There’s a party in the crop circles and i’m the only human being
30 seconds sat silent then pierced the sky in a flash
Not sure if it was me or them that had the last laugh
But i looked at something special, my seat was on the first row
Heaven became domestic when it touched my dirt road
Am i cursed to know what happened, or blessed? man listen
Beauty’s in the eyes with a 20/20 vision, like that

[Hook]
I saw it (saw it all), i saw it (saw it all)
When you see it, you’ve got no choice but to believe it, ya'll [2x]

[Verse 2: manCHILD]
Yeah, all right, ok, that first story just set the tone
Fiction in a poem, a parallel for you to get the song
The next one is true, without a doubt absolutely
I’ll defend it to my death and your heart is the judge and jury
In 1993, i saw something in the concrete
I’d been walking in a world that really didn’t want me
I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face
A room full of people, but i felt like i was the only one in the place
A space cadet, jet streaming waiting for the evening
Wine, women, and song were the toxins i was breathing
But what i saw, what i seen, what i felt, what i looked at
Left me shook visibly, but i took what was given me
Brushed by angel’s wings, it ushered in a change in me
Saw Christ on the cross and realized what pain should be
I ain't delusional but, man, how beautiful
I take and relate it to ya’ll and make it musical
Heaven scrapes the pavement everywhere
From the western hemisphere to third world, you can get it there
I’ll take better care of neighbors and strangers, of rappers and djs
Of breakers and painters, of my wife and my daughters, my friends and my fans
God’s standing next to you wherever you stand
In the eyes of a child or in the eyes of a vagrant (no doubt)
That’s where heaven scrapes the pavement

[Hook][Verse 1]
He sits in the barrel's bottom
Apple rotten, roach infested alley
Starting fights with every Harry, Dick and Tom with broken snapple bottle
Gladly crawling back to underneath his rock and
Roll the dice with prostitutes and thieves
Who smoke his filtered brand of breath of life
He left his wife for every night
She kept him from these glamorous rights
Of passage now each bite he takes just keeps him famished
Damaged seasons turn the leaves black
And the winter burns the skyline
Time and time again, talked to God
And asked the sun to shine again
But see, he wants a quick response
Right now, he's used to fast food
Doesn't realize the chick with the tattoos
Will fit the glass shoes
Now it's a minute after midnight and his riches back to rags
Back masking records on his phonograph as he holds his flask
Yelling "you don't know the half!", track mind that got distracted
And when he punched you in the face, perhaps he just over-reacted
Blast the music, let him lose himself in each and very measure
He just wants it to get better
He just wants it to get better

[Hook]
It's just another hustle
It's just another lonely night
Just another day of shuffling his feet and living his life
It's just a harsh reality that nothing comes for free
He's just another couple steps from where he needs to be

It's just another hustle
It's just another lonely night
Just another day of shuffling his feet and living his life
It's just a slap in the face to let him know nothing's for free
He's just another couple steps from where he needs to be

[Verse 2]
She stands on the platform, glances at the headlines and wait's for the train
Just for fun she looks at strangers tries to match each face with a name
Hears a bum placing the blame on the government so she laughs
To herself, looks to the glass, and watches the city fly past
It's been a long week, maybe tonight she'll meet Mr. "What's the difference?"
At some local social breeding ground, there's no need to get needy now
Sees these clowns and imagines the dimensions of her companion
Tonight could be Mr. right, could just be that last man standing
She's got "independent woman" tattooed in bold across her shoulders
The sole controller, but she still likes someone to hold her
She sees the bottom of the glass now, drinks too much and blacks out
Wouldn't surprise her too much to wake up inside of a crackhouse
Packs two in a bed with a stranger, pack of cigarettes and a lighter
Just before she matches a name with his face as he lies beside her
Burns a cancer stick or two before she gathers her things together
Yeah, she wishes it was better

[Hook]
It's just another couple weekends
Just another couple bars
Just a notch upon a bedpost, just a wish upon a star
Just another couple heartbreaks till she finds just what she needs
She's just another couple steps from where she needs to be [2x]

[Verse 3]
He steps right through that door
Drops his bags and his heart on the floor
He embraces her embrace till she can't take it anymore
Puts his faith in her face waits to exhale that first kiss
Pale from the wishes he'd get back for all the memories that he missed
The blistering pace that moves him cross the globe to God knows wherever
Never knew he'd have the daisy-chain those loose ends back together
Never knew love like this, never knew sacrifice before
It's his first chance to pass his life out at your local record store
Holds his lifetime in his arms then he kisses her goodnight
Wipes the dreams from his daughters face to let her know that she's all right
On his flight, grips tattered edges of a picture framed in fingerprints
A single glimpse of innocence, and a 60 second phone call seems infinite
All said and done wrong, gone in an instant
For the man with physical form who's heart beats with the speed of an infant
Typical storm weather with an aftertaste, adrenaline letdown
After the show, 3 hours of sleep, see how far that we can get now
Get down to business, get the crowd hyped, get the party started
Get back home to his wife and show these people where his heart is
He pities the heartless, the man who can't see each tree for the forest
He masterminds the revolution while he's takin out the garbage
Drops his carcass in his favorite chair and wonders if he can make it there
He looks each brand new day square in the face with a vacant stare
He lays it bare on the records to pull this whole world back together
He just wants to make it better

[Hook]
It's just another couple days
Just another couple shows
Just another couple hundred miles on this road
Just another "i'm sorry baby till I set these people free"
I'm just another couple steps from where I need to be

It's just another couple days
Just another couple shows
Just another couple hundred thousand miles on this road
Just another "i'm sorry baby till I set these people free"
I'm just another couple steps from where I need to be

I'm just another couple steps from where I need to be [4x][Verse 1: manCHILD]
I live the high life with lowlifes who want life to go
Down the middle of the marketplace where souls are bought and sold
In Rap Olympics, forfeit when the starting pistol sounds
Make my words like safety nets so I can catch heads on the way down
Found limits the breath that I breathe in this life that I lead
It’s where the city’s smog infested skyline infects my lifetime
Bring sentences to life like, “See spot run across the freeway”
You can catch it on the Fox News instant replay
I start the finished product minus the first sign of a blemish
Trek towards the infinite if I can break this line of scrimmage
Skywalk through clones attacking me, myself and Samuel Jackson
To live life firsthand ‘til the second hand is reversed
Blurt words written down, world wishing I’d curse them out
So they can call me a hypocrite and disrespect what I’m about
Flirt with disastrous methods, lessons pressed on earthquakes
Make soundtracks for your life with every move that I make

[Hook]
My life moves and it changes and it grows
My life, I fight for life throughout the highs and lows
My life is sacrifice, open wounds and broken habits
My life, come here, take a second look at it
My life moves and it changes and it grows
My life, I fight for life throughout the highs and lows
My life is just a token, a tool for you to see with
It’s my life, but here, you can take it if you need it

[Verse #2]
I got my mind on money that I buried inside the backyard
Slaves to the industry push the plow, get their backs scarred
I’m thinking how to snatch your shotgun before you shoot it
The mountains are all snowcapped but the beaches are all polluted
I still walk the narrow path tightrope style, eyes open to the trials
While most of ya’ll stay in denial
Hold on like a child to what’s real, the rest falls by the wayside
Trace the hands of time to touch the face of El Shaddai
But some of ya’ll don’t play right, you bite backs and attack life
My back to the wall, eyes glued to the eyes of Christ
That’s right, fan base is where open ears can listen
Bump big business, my fast ball shatters the competition
Win at least the division for the vision and still insisting
That we can gain the power, run the labels and make the decisions
My life, write songs for you and the people on your block
It’ll blast on 88 whether the majors want it or not
Just breathe. Breathe in the pain that comes with the growing
Kiss the ground I walk upon and thank my God for the whole thing
Take the bull by the horns because I gotta do something
A nation of manchildren is now under construction

[Hook]

[Verse 3: manCHILD]
I’ve slap-boxed with my brother and broken bread with whose buying
Crouching tiger to hidden gratitude, impossible for me to see
The divine schematics or divide the triune through mathematics
Stand with a mic in my right hand with the left clutching a crucifix
I haven’t felt this worn down since I last listened to Ludacris
But I’m born new every morning, look in the mirror asking “Who is this?”
See the battle scars I’ve earned, oh yeah, I remember now
I’m the one who builds til walls are torn down, so what now?
The crowd disperses, dry wit falls off my person
Manifest destiny, show my faith through action in remixed versions
Dress the wounded with compassion no matter who’s the victor
Expose the world to the Son’s light and I hope they all get blistered
A mystery of life lived and you can’t know until you live this
Til you fall on your face everyday and ask Him for forgiveness
Hide my rage where I can’t find it cause it always keeps me blinded
I’m still living my life and this here is just a reminder

[Hook][Hook]
It's like Boom-Bap, original rap
We take it back and move you forward just to tear it in half
Boom-Bap, original rap
We take it back and move you forward just to tear it in half...(Repeat)

[Verse 1]
I'm a rebel without a pause
Play tape
Claymation action-figure transforming the norm and changing shape
Still face to the face with the grace that it takes
To escape all the hate and calculate each back-break
Communicate the Creator's thoughts with every breath
Control my stride, no man can divide and make me half-step
Pass the solid ground to spaces to the left
If you've got something left to throw, I got something to intercept
This is harder than it looks. This is better than it sounds
This is everything it took to separate me from the ground
This is levitation 101. We tread upon the clouds
And make a name for Mars ILL 'til it fills your mouth
Work it out, make optimists out of the cynical
I like to scramble words around until I make them sensible
One-dimensional voices cry like primadonnas
While we stretch hip-hop from Sugar Hill to Futurama...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a strong mind. It doesn't have to be spoon-fed
I treat my audience with respect and my dialect is interjected
Into conversations worldwide, a piece of heaven injected
Into the blind, scales fall from their eyes
It's all to my surprise that a sound could move the masses
Take my everyday observations and press them onto plastic
Lessons automatically grabbing your fascination
When delivered into action my masters of rap relations
A revolution in music we loosen the chains that hold you
Don't say you weren't aware because I told you
They sold too many souls on the auction city block
Wrists slit on Wall Street, snake-eyes and risky stocks
My life hits a third shift frame of mind
I understand your struggles because they're mine
I spit a trail for you to follow what you thought you couldn't find
Past and present intersected inside of God Divine...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This earth is my place of birth
I want the universe to know God for everything it's worth
Break the cycle 'til it hurts between the lines and in the margins
Killing time and changing life inside a studio apartment
Sacrifice the hardship for those wearing a target
Maximize compassion 'til it smashes through the market
Never call it quits, we've got to finish what we started
Build until you touch the sky or 'til you're in the coffin
It's all in the patterns, stitched and gathered at the seams
We come together to interpret your dreams and what they mean
So thanks for coming out and thank you for listening
Thanks for making it to the end of the track and acting interested
Your time and energy are valuable as well as limited
The fact that you chose Mars ILL is quite considerate
Hope to see you around real soon just for the sentiment
We have to know the past to realize what vision is...

[Hook][Verse 1: sintaxtheterrific]
I'm a patriarch b-boy breaking bones in the park
After dark, my blows like body rock the beat within your heart
I've been sent to set apart, make the swift leg lame
Touch my hand to your hip to cripple physical frames
I'm braining body handicapping snapping judgment just the same
Entertain to leave ya'll limping pimping strut with a cane
The pain is incidental pencil spit in sentence fragments
Character gets crushed like catching hands in kitchen cabinets
Be breaking bad habits, turn the table on them
Manufacture compound fractures with the stroke of my pen
Sintax has spoken to men (kid gets me open within)
I leave you broken like Ken Swift doing cranial spins
Soul bend and break men sending bones through the skin
When words are fresh I'm ripping flesh, paper sheets or melanin
I tend to pop limbs out of joint with the points I make
Your soul's without control like overweights on roller skates
Correct mistakes, Sintax deflates fake over-inflated egos
On beaches in Brazil screaming, "Just Say No To Speedos!!"
In suburbs telling white kids they look stupid wearing corn rows
In Hugh Hefner's mansion tape recording over pornos
There's hurt before the healing and wreck before the rescue
Dirt before the cleansing and dark before the view
Wrong before redemption, hip-hop to break your neck
Cuz God gives us life to live once we got no life left

[Hook]

[Verse 2: manCHILD]
Mind, body and soul heir squares off in circles
Tear kicks and snares to pieces and shreds while breaking bread
Bred to break you, no mistake dude, take 2 fake crews
Deepspace you to your face too, like an earthquake when I make moves
Leave you naked like He made you to longer hide things
Masked as bright schemed politics from the left or the right wing
Spiked words do the right thing, lust for chicks in tight jeans
But it's all obviously faker than a Van Damme fight scene
Your mind's a white screen, the underworld's projecting pipe dreams
Wise mic fiends contact you with bone cracking fractures
Sintaxtheterrific spits rage amaze-on
Just to warn you cool cats the thin ice that you skate on
Levels dangerous like radon, laced with syntactical blows
Expose heads like photos to Jehovah, broken at His feet
Rock hard like concrete to glorify the Most High?
Regardless, I rip flawlessly raw like e-coli
I've been told I ran wild, but still my die hard fans smile
For that drop-you-where-you-stand style, soul heir the manCHILD
I AM stands miles above the current lifestyle that you've chosen
Sounds ill but you'll be whole once you're broken[Verse 1]
I got seven ways to say something different
If you're allergic to the truth, then I suggest you keep your distance
Plug your ears and listen to the sound of a hard heart
Whose trust was pulled one too many times by these card sharks
I spark a charge that darts across the charts
Set far apart from the garbage they're calling our art
I start a lot of controversy. Afraid that we're dissing you?
From the big willie cats to the underground and miniscule?
Honestly, it's anyone polluting the subliminal
If that's you, retribution is unconditional
I'm willing to commit career suicide
If I know that it could fill all your emptiness inside
But I'm confident that top-billing and ripping the veil
Is my job and heart throbs with all it entails
Can't fail, found success when feet hit the trail
Dues paid? Yes y'all, check's in the mail...

[Hook]
It's all about timing and it's about time
To get inside your spine and change your state of mind
You waiting for the music that you need to remember?
Forget all the rest, cause that's when we enter
Right about now, we step into your space
Run up on your intellect and look you in the face
Are you tired of being lied to? That's all we're asking
It's time for a change, Mars ILL, enter the dragon...

[Verse 2]
We did a show but nobody showed up
We did another couple. Ten people came to show love
Not trying to blow up, just need to make this music
Can't explain it. It's just like I'm breathing when I do it
Keeping muted's not an option. It's more like a death wish
Got verses trapped inside and I gotta let them exit
The curse I'm blessed with, I consider very precious
Proceed with caution. This could crack your solar plexus
Next, we did a few hundred shows in a row
Hit the road time and again and watched the revolution grow
Keeping it moving to help you establish what's what
Watch the masses mouth the words to "Sphere" and "Love's Not"
Wait at the bus stop with agenda in hand
Yelling, "Bust shots in the air, not into your fellow man!"
Tell a friend, tell a foe and I'll tell a few of mine
We can change the whole world one soul at time...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
M-A-R-S-I-Double L
Rocking the bells, so go home and tell
Everyone on your block we got records to sell
M-A-R-S-I-Double L
M-A-R-S-I-Double L
Rocking the bells, so go home and tell
Everyone on your block who taught you how to spell
M-A-R-S-I-Double L...

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you talking loud, but you ain't saying no thang
Throw slang across the map and watch both coasts change
Grow fame one step at a time. Start with no name
"Breathe Slow" banging in the front row sang by
Everyone who came to the show, change the old game
See everybody doesn't flow the same
So take your gold fangs and fronts and say what you want
But understand that I've held your number from the jump
It's something sort of resembling your new favorite record and rap group
Grab raw skill and toss it at you
Get under your skin like a tattoo with permanent results
That's provided you have a pulse
Full of useful information on life, love and hatred
Learning from mistakes, the breaks and proper placement
Knowing when to dish it out and knowing when to take it
God is the answer when all else is makeshift...
