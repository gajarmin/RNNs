(Lil Debbie)
I just wanna have some fun, Cindy Lauper
Six carats in the mouth, jaw dropper
They said I'd never make it on my own two
Hold on I got Ryan Seacrest on line two, hold up
Tint look like the first lady, gettin' brain in stretched 'cedes
Coupe the color of Kanye, but the four door be Tom Brady
I'm star gazing, condos and foreign places
Female, Bernie Maydoff

[Hook]

(Lil Debbie)
I'm presidential, a hundred servants
Internet sensation, I shut down the server
I'm fashion forward, ford model
On a pill, with a coke bottle
Coke girls, ciroc girls, came through with a top curl
They do whatever I do, thats why they never rock pearls
Only diamonds, purp and yellow, Kobe diamonds
I been toe tyin', ever since Jody signed me (high roller!)

(RiFF RaFF)
I'm at a switch blade, I threw a wish way
Versace fork in the road, I dont know which way
I should go, I could glow like the sun at noon
Might change my government name to jody 3 moons
3 spoons one for every thou, should I test?
Whirlwind molest, while I give my shows caress
Relieve stress or get kicked to somebodys curb
You on my nerves get yo ass dropped off in the suburbs

[Hook][Hook: Lil Debbie]
All I need is 2 cups of some lean
And a bad bitch just to roll up my weed
Bended through the city with the gold on my teeth
Probably in the scrape with the 4's underneath
(2x)

[Verse 1: Lil Debbie]
Probably in the scrape with the 4's up under
We keep it on the low I'm tryna stay on the under
But everybody know me man they taking my picture
Bad bitch with me just to roll up my swisher

They know me from the bay all the way to LA
From Telegraph to Fairfax they know my name
I'm the same one they get the swag from
I've always had swag while they never had none

Bended through the city with the gold on my teeth
Fly out your bitch just to roll up my weed
Pick her up in the scraper with the 4's underneath
She came with everything cause she know what I need

(Hook 2x)

[Verse 2: DollaBillGates

Probably in the hood but my car from Europe
The crazy part about it is this broad from Europe
I flew her ass south just to roll my weed up
Double cup love gon' and pour my lean up
Bended through the city with the gold on my teeth
Swagged out doe car note on my feet
She know I get that check so ain't no time to play
New Rolex ain't got the time to pay
But she gon roll the weed up I'mma bring the fruit cups
Hundred dollar sprite when I pour this on my soda
We don't need much just 4 styro foam cups, a lil crushed ice some kush we gone...

Mirrors haven't always been my best friend
But when I look at you all I see is reflection
I know when you mad, and if you stressin'
I know when you need addressin', when you feel like sexin'
See, part of me is high off the affection
But all of me is high off this connection
Just promise me that you won't disconnect
And if the signal start to fade, you better hit me with a text
And every time you gone I be thinkin' about the last time

[Verse 1]
Even when you wrong I be lookin' like you [?]
That's how you get me
And that's how I get you
And together we inseparable

[Pre-Hook]
I'm in love with this moment

Wherever you're going
A part of me will be with you
How do I know this?
Cause I can see the me in you

[Post-Hook] x2
Everywhere you go
And everywhere you are
I can feel your love
You ain't really far

[Verse 2]
Across the world, I'll book a flight
Lets fall in love again
We gonna fall when autumn fall
Take off in the wind
You cooler than a breeze
Warmer than the summer air
Don't care 'bout what they told me
Thought you was all a care
Funny how the world works
With everything there is
A pair of shoes, a pair of wings
And me and you right here
I'll put that on me
You'll never be lonely

I got lust for the money I be so turned on
My bank account give me orgasms
That money come fallin, that pussy be pourin
But no need to worry my towel Ralph Lauren

[Verse 1]
I'm learning new language
My currency foreign
Fuck (fuck) who you came with
Your crew is so boring
Focus on gaining this wealth
Hating is bad for your health
Fuck with me? You will get dealt with
My hitters is all on that cell
See, destiny, we gotta get it
You super mad, you need a cape
Your goons in your group could get blamed
In total you cannot escape
Bitch I'm in the game, money on the table
Bustin out the frame, watch me like cable
Bring the Colt 45 ... (?)
You gon take flight out a ladle
We're all on that Lean now I'm falling asleep
Fell in a dream tell you all that I see
I was dripped out in that luxury
Everything custom, I woke up by bed was the sea

[Chorus] 2x

[Verse 2]
Jokes on you mane
I need that money like Bruce Wane
To these birds imma bat
I'll turn into dracula
Money flippin with the spatula
Black diamonds from Africa
Me not shinning is a conflict
Deb shooting out the passenger
Whatever I do is going up high
Get that money then it's bye bye
All true no lie lie
Have your shirt like tie dye
Your whole fam cry cry
You go night night
While I party in Paradise loving the lavish life
You said I'm a savage right? End your life with this savage night
Yeah I go beast mode, then I'm back in the streets, ho

Pussy pop it, get naked for me

[Verse 2]
Look, but don't touch muhfucka I'm a boss bitch

Bitch you can't work it like me, hit the floor, can't twerk it like me and that's critical
This for my bitches who don't mind gettin' ratchet

Ice, right, thunderstormer fade
Drop 50 on my braids and my wrist 20K
But my ear, damn, my ear a frozen yam
Ice water on the band with the somersault slam
Body slam competition, frostbit air conditioning
Want me in a bad position cause I'm in my own division
Dissolve the solution, nationwide recruiting
I don't want your damn girl, she's Craigslist prostitution
Ice, rice, don't get blinded by the sight
I could fracture street lights, rolling dice with Mark Price
Rap game Janet Jackson in the khakis Jack Black Benz
Ice on my ear got me balling like the Pac-10

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
Lil Debbie, I don't ask for permission
Pull up four-wheel twisting while my diamonds are glistening
Ice in ear, ice in watch, watch me freeze your whole block
Stop hating like the cops before I connect all the dots
When it comes to houses, I've got more spots than a dalmatian
30 carats on the bracelet got you by the phone waiting
Will I call, should I ball, that ain't even a question
June 2012 I'm giving syrup sipping lessons
I don't pop too many pills cause that really ain't my style
It's your girl Lil Debbie, I pour a four on a Black and Mild
Take advantage (take advantage), lil mama about to panic
Ice in my ear damn-near froze the Atlantic

[Verse 1: Ms.Get Active]
Haha, that was my old girl, so I had her first

Swappin bitches never trippin' off old work

Bad bitches any color get it [?]
Throwin' bills at ya, bitch I'm tryna see you twerk
She got a booty on point, but the face hurt
But I still know some tricks that'll pay her

Watch out before your bitch while we approachin'
Probably had her and she still whinin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Debbie]
Fresh out the lot, gotta new whip
Kiss a lot of bricks to sit on my lips
She runnin' second place but I had her first
Old dry mouth bitch I couldn't take her thirst
Had to let her go, onto the next ho
She let me feel mo' out in Frisco
On the real though
I fuck with trill hoes
But I go hard with this dildo
She a stripper or a ripper, its whatever
Bought her cheese and I broke her for some cheddar
You want her? I don't sweat her
That's my old work, I'm onto somethin' better

[Hook]

[Verse 4: V-Nasty]
I probably had her first, I probably had her work
She gettin' to the money while I'm runnin' through her purse
I had her at her best, you had her at her worst
I'm always number one while you comin' in third

You loved that bitch while I do the bitch wrong
She all in your face while she singin' my song
Couldn't deal with the bitch so I had to leave her
I ain't lose nothin', so I ain't ever need her

Presidential leader, tell her to blow up
She ain't goin' no where unless she ho up
Bitch you ain't shit

Stop walking around like your pussy drippin' gold

[Hook][Verse 1: Lil Debbie]
Lil Debbie, big shirt, you don't rock it like me

Fat wallet, big cash, jumping jack, big tree

Gold hoops, gold rings
Stuntin' in that thang
Pull up in that wet red Range, that shit flame
Inside asylum white its insane!
Before I hop out on these bitches I let that shit wang

[Hook]

Skinny sweats, Lebron 10s and some Plantlifes
Yeah we next up, I stay f'ed up, with a fresh cut, keep your bitch wet up
I love big checks, I love good sex
Rich the city got my back, made my hood next

Bout progress, bout paper

Bad bitch got jaws like a gator
Smash like bam, hit it the wam

Retweetin' while I'm in important meetings
Boss shit, cause I'm a boss bitch
Get everything I want free it don't cost shit
I get it all, Celine to Chanel
Didn't know I had bars cause a bitch made bail

If you really gettin' money, then bitch I can't tell
I think its silly that you're frontin' when deep down you're frail
Seen your kind before but I could read you in Braille
Beat you with my eyes closed that's just how I feel
Check my numbers, Youtube out a mil, and I'm rollin' up kush on this $100 bill

[Hook]I got bitches, you got bitches

Mirrors haven't always been my best friend
But when I look at you all I see is reflection
I know when you mad, and if you stressin'
I know when you need addressin', when you feel like sexin'
See, part of me is high off the affection
But all of me is high off this connection
Just promise me that you won't disconnect
And if the signal start to fade, you better hit me with a text
And every time you gone I be thinkin' about the last time

[Verse 1]
Even when you wrong I be lookin' like you [?]
That's how you get me
And that's how I get you
And together we inseparable

[Pre-Hook]
I'm in love with this moment
I'm in love with right now
So baby come hold me
Baby come hold me down

[Hook]
Wherever you're going
A part of me will be with you
How do I know this?
Cause I can see the me in you

[Post-Hook] x2
Everywhere you go
And everywhere you are
I can feel your love
You ain't really far

[Verse 2]
Across the world, I'll book a flight
Lets fall in love again
We gonna fall when autumn fall
Take off in the wind
You cooler than a breeze
Warmer than the summer air
Don't care 'bout what they told me
Thought you was all a care
Funny how the world works
With everything there is
A pair of shoes, a pair of wings
And me and you right here
I'll put that on me
You'll never be lonely

[Pre-Hook]x2 + [Hook] +[Bridge] + [Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Outro]
Everywhere you go
And everywhere you were
And everywhere you go

And everywhere you go

Only diamonds, purp and yellow, Kobe diamonds

(RiFF RaFF)
I'm at a switch blade, I threw a wish way
Versace fork in the road, I dont know which way
I should go, I could glow like the sun at noon
Might change my government name to jody 3 moons
3 spoons one for every thou, should I test?
Whirlwind molest, while I give my shows caress
Relieve stress or get kicked to somebodys curb
You on my nerves get yo ass dropped off in the suburbs
