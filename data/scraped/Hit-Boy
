[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'm with some hood girls lookin' back at it
And a good girl in my tax bracket
Got a black card that'll let Saks have it
These Chanel bag's a bad habit
I-I do balls, Dal Mavericks, my Maybach, black matted
Bitch, never left but I'm back at it, and I'm feelin' myself, jack rabbit
Feelin' myself, back off, cause I'm feelin' myself, jack off
He be thinking about me when he whacks off, wax on? Wax off
National anthem, hats off, then I curve that nigga, like a bad toss
Lemme get a number two, with some Mac sauce
On The Run Tour, with my mask off

[Hook: Beyoncé]
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself

I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my

[Post-Hook: Beyoncé]
Changed the game with that digital drop
Know where you was when that digital popped
I stopped the world
Male or female, it make no difference
I stop the world, world stop...
Carry on

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Kitty on fleek, pretty on fleek
Pretty gang, always keep them niggas on geek
Ridin' through Texas, feed him for his breakfast
Everytime I whip it, I be talkin' so reckless
He said "Damn Nicki it's tight," I say "Yeah nigga you right"
He said "Damn, bae, you so little, but you be really takin' that pipe"
I said "Yes daddy I do, gimme brain like NYU"
I said "Teach me, nigga, teach me. All this learnin' here is by you"

[Pre-Hook: Beyoncé]
(Moans) Uhn! I'm whippin' that work, he diggin' that work

Panky full of that bounce baby
Come get you some of that bounce baby

[Hook: Beyoncé]
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my

[Bridge: Nicki & Beyoncé]
Cookin' up that base, lookin' like a kilo
He just wanna taste, biggin' up my ego
(Ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego)
Ridin' through Texas, ridin' through Texas
Smoke it all off, talkin' bout that high-grade
Baby hold up, I can kill your migraine
(Migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine)
Ridin' through Texas, ridin' through Texas

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Keep gettin' gifts from Santa Claus at the North Pole
Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow
Let that ho ho, let that ho know -- he in love with that coco
Why these bitches don't never be learnin'?
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'
I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban
Ain't gotta rely on top 40,I am a Rap legend
Just go ask the Kings of Rap, who is the Queen and things of that
Nature? Look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a laser
Drippin' on that work, trippin' off that perc
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work
Takin' trips with all them ki's, car keys got B's
Stingin' with the Queen Bey and we be whippin' all of that D
Cause we dope girls we flawless,we the poster girls for all this
We run around with them ballers, only real niggas in my call list
I'm the big kahuna, go let them whores know
Just on this song alone, bitch is on her fourth flow

Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream

[Hook]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Verse 1]
Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing
Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

[Verse 2]
I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 3]
It's go time, I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you going marry mines"
Beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, okay
I'm never living life confined, it's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time
Beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch
I look like OJ, killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy popping and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbing in the street, yelling

“We're going to skate to one song, one song only”

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
So I ball so hard mothafuckas wanna fine me
First niggas gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a mothafucka like me
Can you please remind me? (Ball so hard)
This shit crazy y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82 and I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird, we ain't even s'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here it's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock, Rolleys that don't tick tock
Audemars that's losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
(Ball so hard) I'm shocked too, I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(Ball so hard) Let’s get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave, just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi town's D. Rose, I’m moving the Nets to BK

[Hook]
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)

[Verse 2: Kanye]
She said, "'Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all."
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain’t it Jay?
What she order, fish filet?
"Your whip so cold" – this old thing?
Act like you’ll ever be around mothafuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand, fuck that bitch she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French but I’m in France, I’m just sayin'
Prince Williams ain’t do it right if you ask me
Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley
What’s Gucci, my nigga? What’s Louis, my killa?
What’s drugs, my dealer? What’s that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I’m the illest, cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

[Interlude]
“I don't even know what that means
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
No it's not, it's gross (Gets the people going)”

Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)

[Outro: Kanye]
You are now watching the throne, don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin, actin’ like the summer ain’t mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building, they hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m 'bout to kill it, how you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone (I’m definitely in my zone)[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
What of the dollar you murdered for?
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
Or your brother's the one that you're running from?
But if you got money, fuck it, cause I want some

[Big Sean]
B-I-G
Who fucking with me?
Oh God!

[Hook: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fucking with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muthafuckin clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday, to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day
Yup, she trying get me that poo-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu Tang
I'm rolling with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr! I'm pulling up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fucking villain, man, they kneeling when I'm walking in the building
Freaky women I be feeling from the bank accounts I'm filling
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D that's killing everything that he see for the dough

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm talking Ye, yeah, I'm talking Rih
Yeah, I'm talking B, nigga, I'm talking me
Yeah, I'm talking bossy, I ain't talking Kelis
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
Yeah, I'm talking LeBron, we ball in our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin, ain't nothing fuckin' with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me
Now who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation: I'm the shit, least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years, ain't hug his son since the second grade
He never told. Who he gonna tell? We top of the totem pole
It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green it only means one thing
You ain't fucking with the clique

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival - the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah I'm talking business, we talking CIA
I'm talking George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gone kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Everytime I'm in Vegas they screaming like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feeling Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, Gisele, nah that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talking to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess he's talking back
Fucking with my clique

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm mmm,"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big KRIT]
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist[Hook]
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 1]
Let's take it to the basis, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers anus
So tell me what your name is, I'mma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up some money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to complement the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, "Tell it to my face"
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn

Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé]
I wake up looking this good
And I wouldn’t change it if I could

And you can say what you want, I’m the shit

Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me
Propofol, I know they hope I fall
But tell ‘em winning is my motherfuckin’ protocol
‘Cause I score before I ever throw the ball
These bitches washed up and ain’t no fuckin’ soap involved, uh
This every hood nigga dream, fantasizing about Nicki and Bey
Curvalicious, pussy served delicious
Mayday, mayday, earth to bitches
Slap these hoes on they ass, like we birthing bitches, UHN!
The queen of rap, slayin' with Queen B
If you ain’t on the team, you playin’ for team D
Cause we A-listers, we paid sisters
This watch right here done phased blizzards
I confess, I woke up like this,all this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick,Instagram, another flawless pic
Flawless city with these flawless titties
I got all these hundreds, you got all them fifties
I’m with some flawless bitches because they more than pretty
Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back, I be on my frisbee
Princess cut diamonds on my Disney
He want monster Nicki in Sri Lanka
I told him meet me at the Trump, Ivanka
I said come here, let me show you how this cookie taste
This that "Yeah, nigga, eat the cookie" face

Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big KRIT]
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist[Verse 1: ChrisX$treets]
Maniplating minds like a television
Roll another spliff up, and hit the jay hard until i hiccup
My brain is corrupt, learned the system just to fuck it up
I took your classes just to fight the powers
Now that im about to graduate i swear the world is ours
I'll probably get assinated at my graduation, for knowing too much about the rules of education
And tryna cnange the system through my years of observations
If im illuminated, then my fans illuminati
And you might need a dictionary because your misconstrued prolly
Brainwashed your son, now im fucking on your daughter
The new world order is probably out of order
Burn american flags with black lighters
Y'all just flip-flop like runnin' from cops in chanclitas
Look at where im from, nigga, i deserve an applause
Cause im breaking over barriers instead of breaking laws
My grandmother broke from years of stuffin' collection plates
Trying to get my 40 acres not dealing with section 8
They gave us a rug, just to snatch it from under us
The feds gave us drugs, now I'm cooking up angel dust
My mindstate is further, just unleasing all my burdens
Need to free my mind, and doing so, i made murder
I need to introduce you to the the illest nigga doing it
The illest two doing it, the illest crew doing it
But we dont get the recognition that we all deserve
Only way you seeing $treets is with your face on the curb
Nigga im obserd, bending words, fucking birds
Everytime i spit a verse, please analyze the words
The wordplay is wicked, my niggas call me gifted
My peers think I'mma weirdo but i just say im different
And i dont mean to brag but i kinda like to brag
Feel the wrapth of the titans when me and my niggas clashEmpire state of mind, but Wilmington's my colony
My niggas' bongs always be the cloudiest like Ptolemy
And I got philosophies doper than by Socrates
In the bed with models from developing democracies
Pretty nigga cold, but my skin hot chocolatey
Haters tryna body me, but them lames don't bother me
Honestly? Honestly? Can't take out the wild in me
And you know I'm tryna see money like the lottery
Moms is proud of me; I'm about to graduate
Game getting colder, all you niggas better acclimate
They say I'm Illuminati or I'm into sorcery
But I don't praise the devil, nigga; that nigga, he worship me
Orange juice spruced with Goose: Howard Hughes' plane
My dick up in her neck: one head, two brains
Two ropes, two rings, too trill, 2 Chainz
Nigga, anything better than that 2 train[Intro T. Pharaohll]
N.C.I.S., is the worst show, ever
Like at all

[Verse 1: T. Pharaohll]

I'm feeling like a track fiend, when the needle drops my head is spinning
Relaxing is impossible when lead is killing
Black queens. And of course the males heads are filling
With ideas of self imposed war, so
Who's the villains?
As genocide steadily rises like the ocean tide
I'm not Noah guys, so I choke him if hes telling me a bullshit lie
Thats over-sized. So I incline my demise with my actions. but I hope that I
Can keep the nonsense to a minimum. My conscience is subliminal
Controlling me through interludes, and syllables that ridicule
My inner jewels and are cynical, keeping me from my pinnacle
I just need a friend or two, to keep me to the ground like an inner tube
And infuse positivity until I'm positive that I can't lose
Stop the riffs of blues from my guitar, rock a hit or two
Suede shoes, an Elvis mood. Bitches make their pelvis move
When I hit the mic, I do it right. Sorta like Jackson's father, make it leather smooth
My etiquette is heaven sent. so the irrelevant, they better move
Or become a casualty. that's how it just has to be
Before I take the throne and all the masses call me majesty
I'll decapitate the whack who turn tracks into travesties
And eradicate the fake at the wake who might get mad at me
T. Pharaohll, the black sparrow God's eyes on
I'll Animorph into a hero and fight these pythons
Who hide in these amber waves of grain with a disguise on
I keep the grass low on every square inch of my lawn
They'll have to work harder if the wanna turn me to Krylon
Graffiti portraits, of the hip hop bosses, who took losses
Paid the ultimate price for the sport, that's what the cost is
That feeling gets me nauseous, but also keeps me cautious
I love the life I life and would never file for divorce. Its
Crazy to me how one can say I'm not a savior to beats
Raised in the east strict mother kept me out of the streets
For the most part I think it helped me dodge the police
I solemnly speak, that if I take my talents out to the beach
I'll keep my heart local as my music helps to breaches the peace
Bang it loud. Make your neighbors jump out of the seats
Banging on your wall like, "who's that spitting raw? Burn a cd!"
Turn the degrees hotter, up to Celsius
You'll need water, but you'll remember me like elephants
Trying be known in the future, but I'm drowning in the present tense/
Trying be relevant, but they don't wannna let me in
Surrounded by hounds who smell of kush and dutch vanilla scents
Surrounded by hounds who smell of kush and dutch vanilla scents
Surrounded by hounds who smell of kush and dutch vanilla scents
Took my first toke and haven't been the same ever since
Took my first toke and haven't been the same ever since
Took my first toke and haven't been the same ever since

[Outro]

And I know one thing...
Anything's better than that 95
Or that 88, or that 83, or that 50C
Talking
Bout that Transit of CT
I need to hurry up and get my V
To whip it through these city streets cold
(fades out)
B.O.A.T.S. and H.O.E.S. on the way
I hope y'all enjoyed this little free verse
I don't know what else you want for free
Gimme some feedback
WASSUP!!Clears throat

[Verse 1: Bro Sampson]
Ball so hard, game delay
I don't give a fuck man I came to play
All over the world and got the sweet sound so you can call me Amazing Grace
When I'm Pissin white I drink gatorade, avoid kryptonite so I save the day
And these haters gettin' mad cause I got me some bathanapes
It's Thunderous and I'm out here with my rain coat, fuck you
Niggas smaller than duck food and I'm sittin' tall on them mushrooms
The only rule that I live by is you fuck around and you will die
Underground so I'm runnin' 'round with that burner, Bill Nye
Flow cold, I'm a chill guy but thats quick to change if you YOLO
Hit the brakes or this clique'll spray cause bitch this ain't a new polo
Blood on my boat shoes, no socks thats road rules
This real world and I'm too frat so we get higher than Goku on that Kaio-Ken
Firemen try to put us out they better try again
I'm Pullin' strings like a violin
We take ya life that's bio chem
(My) cable network's Fios and my favorite sweatshirts piled in my closet
Hope you watch it 'fore that label gets ya filed in
WNBA
El rulo el pie
Condujo en viste
And please don't listen to what we say
We got that work and it's all pre-paid so in advance better call three days
And if you need, gotta have leeway
I get my 'preme from around E-bay
I give a fuck what she say you catch elbows like metta
Turn yo shit red if you in bellos white sweater
Hell knows I'm better, Overlord and Miley Cyrus bitch
A tiny scientist just be prepared for 9096[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
Need a hundred a show so we can fly in a jet
Fuck with you girl, you always ready for sex
Keep my eye on this game and let the money invest
And nigga I'mma die for my fucking respect

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
You fucking with a young nigga, two twelves in the trunk nigga
Havin everything he want nigga
Life on the rush nigga, probably never get enough nigga
All he wanna do is stunt nigga
Niggas always looking up to him, whole spot going up to him
New money getting stuck to him
Life it was rough to him
Skinny nigga he was buff to it, trying to do it like Puff do it
Do it like Russ do it, real life said wassup to it
Need a Benz nigga fuck Buick
Made a plan and I stuck to it
I'm the man you a bluff to us, small talk such a sus to us
The money is a must to us
We came from these corners but we at it til we affluenced
You gotta bring your guts to it
Trying to get it to the point they gotta bring it in a truck to us

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
All 'em blogs never shook a nigga
Hundred racks just to book a nigga
Greatest ever like a Brooklyn nigga
All this ice here is hard to overlook a nigga
Fell in love with that fast money
50 racks on that back end
Walk through cause four bricks
Maybach's when I back in
LAX Nip roll that pound
Pool outside of that polo lounge
MOB bitch hold that down
Pinky ring gold Rolex crown
Testify; never go that route
Black bottles, that Moet out
My first mil I had a Kodak smile
Tell the plug bring more back now
Fake jewels never tolerate it
Pray boobee's case exhonerated
Every night I thank God I made it
Every night I thank God I made it!
My bitch bad like Paula Patton
Big ass mansion from all that rappin
Tell the police call the captain
Motherfucker I'mma start the clappin

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle][Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic (Nope!)
New king of this beat shit, I'm the hardest
Just being honest
You don't got a Grammy nigga, don't comment
This is my HS87 promise, I go crazy killer retarded
When I touch the beat and get started, Barry Bonds it
And I hit these hoes with the peace sign
Nigga, As-alaykum salaam it
Boy, you better get your work up
Been the same niggas since surf club
They putting on for that best side
I'mma make sure that they heard us

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
I know what it is
These niggas ain't real, tell the truth 'bout how I feel
Fuck these niggas, what's the deal?
I know what it is
Y'all forgot I ride around on the weekend
Top down for no reason, y'all was missing that G-shit
Y'all was missing that G-shit, y'all was missing that G-shit
Y'all was missing that G-shit, y'all was missing that G-shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
I'm out here on my Pac shit
She out here on her Faith Evans
Niggas still on that fraud shit
Selling out all of my concerts
Breaking bread with my dawgs, shit
Repeat the steps till we all rich
(Repeat the steps till we all rich)
I'm getting that change
Sitting on deuces, riding on [?]
One part of my brain was like
"Hussle, get to it, just sign on your name"


[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy]
Look, I don't waste time, I take mine
From the state line to Boston
New York to Austin[Verse 1: ]
Sono stato in cima alla vetta  e mi sono scopato il cielo
Nuvoloni di sperma, piove  fecondo il paese intero
La mia ditta produce rime  ad alta definizione
Il novantanove percento della scena rap è finzione
Ho fatto cinque dischi in major  e due indipendenti
Inseguo affari di notte a fari spenti
Sento odore di: "Ma sei serio?"
Sempre di corsa io faccio non spero
La gente mi scatta le foto autovelox
Ancora famoso non mi sembra vero...

[Hook]
Dal primo demo  ad oggi come sto?
Rispondo:  ripagato in pieno
Il testo non si capisce  lo spero almeno
Ti porto dove finisce l'arcobaleno

Alieno

[Verse 2: ]
Torno forte mi contesti, no!
Rime fitte come l'intestino
A Milano è moda Kate Moss-chino
Fumo sette  jolle  mini - mo
Ogni testo è conferma che sto al top king
Vado all'estero a fare coffeeshop-ing
Questa vita è un film
Il resto è tutta pubblicità
Non stacco un attimo
Sempre in ballo
Andrò in vacanza nell'aldilà
La base mi ricorda quel pezzo
Anche se qui non siamo a Parigi
Rappo "Psycho"
Panico
Tanti soldi
Tanti nemici - Ah!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ]
Dove finisce l'arcobaleno
Vieni ti ci porto
Così tanta coca che gira da far resuscitare un morto
Ho la fama, quella che aliena , che ingombra, che ti deforma
In un paese progettato per mandarti fuori norma
Dove tutto fa spettacolo
Dove c'è chi è sempre in posa
Il successo cos'è?
È quando tutti indicano la stessa cosa
Mangio vocabolari e scrivo dalla a alla zeta
Prendo lei a letto, la scopo e vengo da un altro pianeta

Alieno[Intro: D-WHY]
Can we all just get along? I wish we all could
Let's try to work it out, man I think we all should
I'm gettin' sick and tired of actin' all hood
Even thought it's all bad, you know it's still all good

[Verse 1: D-WHY]
They tell me ain't nothing free in life, but I'm living my life carefree
Stuntin' like someone triple-double-dog dared me
Duffle bags saying, "carry me"
Model chicks saying, "marry me"
Ain't got shit yet, but I promise in the future there will be:
One me, two chicks, three-ways, four-play
Five yachts, six planes, seven plaques, eight chains
Nine lives, ten times, I'mma kill the whole game
Accessories compliment, but the outfit is insulting
Riding in something mean, but I'm kissing on something nice
Sometimes I hate myself, but I'm loving life
Do you love your life?
If pain's the price of pretty, someone put me out my misery
Y'all making mistakes, I'm making history
I'll keep it on the humble, but see arrogance is more fun
Nice as your favorite rapper, just better looking and more young
Tell her slow down, give me less lip and more tongue
Ignore all the bullshit, that's how you'll get more done

[Hook: D-WHY]
See everybody talks, but I don't wanna listen
I'm just on vacation, they just out here trippin'
You've been here 60 seconds, I've been here for a minute
Thanks for your concern, but let me handle my business
Can we all just get along? I wish we all could
Let's try to work it out, man I think we all should
I'm getting sick and tired of trying to act all hood
Even thought it's all bad, you know it's still all good

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
D-WHY...H.B
I got bad bitches in tandems, watch me play on this piano
No, you niggas cannot stand him, but them hoes all think he's handsome
Hold her ass up like it's ransom, then she vanish if she's Spanish
Pretty women got it in for me, she look like she's from Italy
I just came from France, where French women just kissing me
You might not understand if your passport lookin' empty
I ain't got no sympathy, cooler than a winter breeze
Tell her, "sit down, shut up, baby girl just sip this Hennessy"
We never going back to broke again, we supposed to win
Told you from the opening, but you wasn't focused in
There go them hoes again, all over my trojan man
I ain't Troy, but these roman numerals keep on rolling in
We gettin' paper and we dress so player
Smoking purple, wearing gold, you would think I was a Laker
I am ballin' on these hoes, watch my turn around J'er
And I keep these bitches wet like Reggie Miller on the Pacers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: D-WHY]
Crazy, amazing, I'm racing, no pacing, I raise the bar
'Til I'm eighty-some with great grandbabies and 80 cars
Life's a McDonald's combo meal, baby we going large
And I think with my dick, so you know I'm going hard
I'm going off, but they tell me I'm on
And I'm feeling so right, but they tell me that I'm wrong
You know I'm with a red-haired hippie chick, no top, sandals on
Get up in it, handle business, finish, and I'm gone
Girls tell me I'm too hood, friends say I ain't hood enough
New girl says I'm too good, ex says I ain't good enough
I'll do all I can to embarrass you, then do some more shit
To ensure in 20 years, my sons stunt all over your kids
I.D. says I'm 22, think like I'm 35
Act like I'm 18, dress like I'm buried alive
Feel like I'm very alive, live like I'm ready to die
Devilish looks, I'm one hell of a guy

[Hook][Intro: Robin Thicke]
Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed
Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
I was over played like Mike Jackson hits
I swear them Growing Pains was Alan Thicke
Now we’re crying less and we’re smiling
High of life and we wilding
I just pray that I don’t OD before the league, Len Bias
Sending thank you's to my old teachers
Who told me I was dreaming
Cause now I’m in the Aston Martin Luther King, speeding
And the bad bitch, my cargo
I’m so fueled, that’s our code
By the niggas who trying to stop Argo
Now we’re American Idols like a FOX show
I remember waiting all in line, in line
Now the legends ask me can I make time, make time
So you should look up, be proud of this nigga
Pop your face, just smile for a nigga
For the people that used to front
Middle fingers up, fuck you very much

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed
Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed
It’s all I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, it’s all I ever dreamed

[Verse 2: Price Tag]
I remember having a dream with the world in my palm
Now I just copped a new crib, gave the keys to my mom
Since I signed with John Janick, yeah, I think I’m Lebron
Think I’m Bin Laden, that mean I think I’m the bomb
'We'd never make it here', that’s what they told us
Now we’re burning cause we earn it, so what?
Club full of white girls with no butt
They wanna smoke, I told her "Marilyn Monroe/roll up"
For a nigga who ain’t never had nothing
Who came up from the bottom and made it to the top
To a nigga getting ends
No rims on a Benz, rich nigga could you stop?
Now we getting cake, Anna Mae
We getting cake, Anna Mae
Them cold nights we used to pray
Now it’s cold ice, open up the Ace

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oktane]
I heard a gang a niggas got fired, Wayne about to retire
And on everybody’s top five, Oktane getting higher
I do it one time for my haters, and ya'll know who you are
These niggas hating my guts
Cause I got mine customized in my car, let’s go
Now Hit-Boy said it best, "We're just all young and excited"
With the cripple women you would kill for just dying to be invited
Then they want us, we don’t need them
You never did this, don’t believe them
Put your cellphone on that table
And keep your hands where I can see them, girl
They lying if they say this party ain’t everything that it seems
Making music that we love, laying on top of the girl of your dreams
I just hit her door, I knock-knock
Make her hit the floor, then stop, drop
Now your favorite model, I got screaming

[Hook]

[Bridge: K. Roosevelt]
We get it, get it, get it, get it, my nigga
Cause we live it, live it, live it, live it, live it
We’re gonna get it, get it, get it, get it, my nigga
Cause we live it, live it, live it, live it, live it
It’s all I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed[Produced by Hit-Boy and Hazebanga]

[Verse 1: Price]
Hold it down
Me and my niggas is all about the cash
Me and my niggas is all about the dough
Walk through the door five pounds of gold
Feeling like my head is where the crown should go
I see a lot of girls that used to front on me
And now they see me I'm on it wanna fuck 'til the bed break down
I see a lot of niggas who was hating back then
And now they see me and they wanna give me handshakes now
But I ain't, really, with, all that, fool shit, nigga back back
I used to have a 9 to 5 taking out the trash bags
Now everybody talking about me pound pound hashtag
Now I do this proper, play no games
You can keep it on the low and I ain't saying no names
What we drinking what we drinking take it all to the brain
Going this hard is gonna probably drive me insane

[Hook]
Right now I'm trying to get turnt up
So nigga pass that drink
And I dont even smoke, but girl pass that weed
Man I'm trying to get faded
So faded, that it's gonna last a week
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me

[Verse 2: Wale]
Say yeah though,Yeah though
Give me head baby I can make your head blow
Getting high make her wanna bust it real low
Spread em out legs looking like a field goal
Extra point lets have a sex appointment
A lot of girls but they is less important
What's the problem, let Folarin hold you
We could stop negotiate the proper process
Like yeah though,Yeah though
Straight from Washington look
Most my dogs be moving loud as shit
Thats why I ride with Audio Push
Say yeah though,Yeah though
We're young but we're not children
Had braids since like 0'something, but had them hits since 87
Get me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oktane]
Do you swear to tell the truth
The whole truth and nothing but the truth
So help you whatever-idol-you-worship
Well that's perfect
Cause we finna play ten fingers shot glasses out
Anything you wanna know baby ask it now
And the game don't stop until all of your fingers are in your palms
Or one of us passes out
Convo of this liquor got you wetter than the rain
You need a poncho
And I got a Mexican girl that give the top-shelf brain
Call her my head honcho
And i got a black girl using that white girl
She higher than the Ozone
And my white girl don't like taking orders
At least while her clothes on
But when she take'em off my nigga that's on me
Then I make her throw it throw it back on me
Then I gas her up pump pump
And make her scream, tell her "Give me 'Oktane' on three!"
Too many women getting lip lip during their trip trip, I drop'em
There's more blessings than problems
But I still get them, When I wanna solve them I say

[Hook][Hook]
Yeah, and you should know that automatically
Yeah, and you should know that automatically
Yeah, and you should know that automatically

[Verse 1]
I just read somewhere
Niggas who live for the future never get there
So I'm schemin' in the present, eatin' chicken skewers
Wristwear gleamin'
Been that nigga since the semen, still ain't what it seem
And I'm still shakin' my demons
From way back when I was dreamin' of takin' my region
Up early in the morning like Kathie and Regis
I wasn't into listenin' to the faculty teachin'
I'd rather go listen to Ye on my raggedy speakers
Heed to the facts that he's speakin'
Bless that child
Heard The College Dropout and now my test scores' down
It showed me I could advance without diplomas if I stay devoted
Send my beats to everybody and my prayers to Jehovah
My mama don't even know this, 9th grade, I was tuckin' a knife
For all the maybes, I had it in my Jansport for extra safety
When some niggas in Colton tried to play me
Had to stay on my 1s and 2s, Tom Brady
Bangin' Eminem shit then
Go and put on Suga Free to hear some pimp shit
Them summer days, hit the mall, spit at broads
No money for Chinese food, we'll come up with a strategy
And you should know that automatically

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I've been on my grind for so long
Listen to the story I tell in this song
I've been on my grind for so long
Listen to the story I tell in this song

[Verse 2]
Some people got wives and some people got groupies
Some people got lives and I just got this music
I can't nearly lie, we are livin' in the future
Iggy rode to my party in the back of a Buick
Now she boomin', I knew she was on the right path
Damn, the minute I seen that white ass
You know that [?] is a nice trail
So shout out to my nigga Mike L
I'm speakin' the real, I ain't just talkin'
You know how it feels when the shit is poppin'
Like you just went and got somethin' out the auction
Niggas treat you way different when your art chartin'
Turn from a friend to a fuckin' target
I'm rarely alone but I'm lonely often
Nigga either way it go, I'm in this bitch all in
And this the mothafuckin' plug, never no stallin'
This song is for the girls in the spot, fake hair, fake butt
Hire professionals just to do her club makeup
Turn up the decibels, let's hear it for respectable girls
Who hit up festivals, I think that I should let you know that...

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Okay now put these vibes into immediate use
If you cookin' in the kitchen, sweepin' or cleanin' your room
This ain't a meaningless tool, run it back 'bout 10 more times
While you're eating your food
Bang it at a restaurant where they serve seasonal fruit
Shit is goin' up like I released a balloon
I used to have a bad habit of speakin' too soon
And I was caught up on lookin' for that special spot
Made a couple bad calls but I don't ref a lot
Got no concept of a clock, I'm on hustler's time
Had to dump the beliefs that no longer apply
I smile and go to meetings, actin' like it's all fine
When I know I'm in the worst pub deal of all time
Dealin' through it with the prayers, RAW papers and strong wine
I know it'll be aiight but it's still a long ride
I'm more in tune with me than I used to be, truthfully
I've been on my shit so much I couldn't make the eulogy

[Outro]

(2x)
You are now
You are now
You are now
Aware of the queen (good shit)

[Verse 1]
Look, aye don't be asking for no free shit (nigga)
When you know my bills due
I don't like these rappers
This shit is felling like middle school
And I'm the only kid thats in the building thats gone keep it true
Whats cool that you cool and all
But you don't influence dog
And you don't be speaking that real life in the music song
You swimming in Benjamin's
Just admit that you fool as all
Cause in reality you by the pool with some pumas on

[Bridge]
So do us a favor y'all
Get out the way and let a winner preach (preach)
See you a deacon for them leaches
Thats steady reaching creeping up on my body
Why don't you let me be
I heard you like to suck (suck my energy)
The only remedy I know
Get a pen
Write a song
Fifth of hen
Light a bong
Repents and right her wrong
And I try to forgive the people that hurt me
But I know that they gone hate to see me flourish

[Verse 2]
Cause I am the power
I am the courage
I am the people
Don't you ever get discouraged
I am the reason that somebody getting nervous
Like got damn my nigga I'm just trying to serve my purpose
You ain't got to close the door on me
Just let me in and let my posse eat
Everything 100 over here
You get a lot of me
I done cried so many fucking tears its getting hard to see
1000 miles and running for that money
Callus on my feet
I swear so much to say
Will they ever listen
If I don't pay the price for fame
Will they pay attention
If I say fuck social media
Will I get a mention
If female rappers sucks to me
Is that considered dissing
If I don't pay my rent on time
Will I get evicted
If I don't get the proper shine you gone be a victim
Oh I know that it takes some time
I'm a keep on bitching
Cause I know I got better rhymes than all of these niggas

[Bridge]
Whats up
Niggas be dykes you can't tell me otherwised
If I look them in they eyes I can see through their disguise
All man, I can tell by the way you staring
All man, you got a pussy in your pants
All man, I really jiving I'm jiving
Im on the passenger seat and my bitch driving
She driving and she gone wobble de wobble de
Oochie wally got wildebeest on my toes
Too swift on them to get caught up with hoes

[Verse 3]
I mean I use to think that I wasn't good enough
My team ain't supportive
My manager he ain't booking much
Thought maybe if I shed a couple pounds and stop looking rough
I get into position
Fuck it thats how I look to stuff
But I am my own woman
I carry my own weight
I burry these other rappers
I eat off my own plate
With various styles
Consider me like an old great
In love with this crazy bitch called life
She my soulmate
Im living in the city where them skinny niggas murder for a penny
No crustaceans
Niggas happy for a skillet up a Denny's

[Outro]
Yeah Im a chill for a minute
Y'all muthafuckers trying to take all my energy
Y'all act like I don't know it though
Fuck it, aye

You are now
You are now
You are now
Aware of the queen

Niggas may not understand it now (now now now now now)
But they will (will will will will will)

Lincoln Had a dream x3

All my life I fight for my freedom
Reconstruction amendments man do I need em
I pray that Abraham Lincoln is gon lead em
So I reap the fruits of my labor then I eat em

[Verse 1: J Boi]

Man I got freedom, with the 13th amendment
Remember back, when all the blacks, had to sit in them chains, invented
By the slave masters, screaming we 3/5 of a person
Compromise, that was made, and it compromised all the slaves
And our father’s live was ashamed, slavery legislation
The Fugitive slave law tried to recapture us in the nation
Many years they was chasing, civil war was adjacent
But the 13th amendment, freed all the slaves and now we just pacing saying

[Hook: Isaiah G]

All my life I fight for my freedom
Reconstruction amendments man do I need em
I pray that Abraham Lincoln is gon lead em
So I reap the fruits of my labor then I eat em
Man I got freedom, man I got freedom
Man I got freedom, thanks to all these amendments
All my life I fight for my freedom
Reconstruction amendments man do I need em

[Verse 2: Boi Virus]

Got that 14th amendment, in my wagon, you lagging
Protected under law, no longer backwards of the saggin
Incorporated Bill of rights to all the southern states
Now they can't infringe upon all of the stuff I want to say
My religion is so free, I worship whom I want to pray
And I protest, with the right to assemble and demonstrate
I’m equal, white people, unique flow, im in this
The 14th amendment, important now witness, how

[Hook: Boi Virus]

[Verse 3: Isaiah G]

Do I need em, I lead in the 15th amendment, helped voting rights all get amended
Sent the ballots in the North but in the South they were restricted
VOTING, Jim Crow, VOTING, Jim Crow
VOTING, Jim Crow, VOTING, but now
We got the Voting Rights Act, of 1965
So now the blacks can pick the president in which they like
VOTING, Rights Act, VOTING, Rights Act
VOTING, Rights Act, Voting I got my rights back
Killing every thing from poll taxes to a literacy test
I got voting rights and the white people, are literally stressed
The V.O.T.I.N.G. R.I.G.H.T. A.C.T
Helped the black people to vote and now we do that faithfully

[Hook]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Verse 1]
Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing
Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

[Verse 2]
I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 3]
It's go time, I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you going marry mines"
Beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, okay
I'm never living life confined, it's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time
Beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch
I look like OJ, killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy popping and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbing in the street, yelling

[Hook] + [Bridge] + [Break][Verse 1]
Asshole, yeah that’s what they calling me
And they can watch the time fly
While they wait on an apology
D.F.Y., D.F.Y., that’s the story of my life
They always told me don’t speak
If you ain’t saying nothing nice
Attitude over everything, everything over my exes
Everyone stays for dinner
Only the chosen stay for breakfast
Sorry, I’m not sorry
Came in tardy to the party, dressing, acting like I’m Ari
They ask me why I’m conceited
And why I’m over-achieving
People done fucked me over
So really I’m just getting even
There’s a price on my head, I’m going for dead
‘Cause nobody cares about me
I’ve been way too self-involved, I guess it’s my fault
Maybe we’ll just have to wait and see
And you know...
As I'm living, I dont stress ‘em, I God bless ‘em
Learned that lesson, now I’m better
I’m walking into confession
One shot for my people
Who never made it up out the ghetto
To get through this shit
I’m gon’ need another shot of espresso

[Hook]
Fuck ‘em all is what I’m yellin’ ‘til I die
Did it all on my own, I’m doin’ what I fantasized
Might have hurt a couple feelings, but I never told no lies
And the nerve of these folks, they want me to apologize?
I’m sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, I’m not
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I’m not
Sorry for stuntin’, sorry for nothin’
Sorry for what? Sorry, I’m not sorry

[Verse 2]
Asshole, why the fuck you callin’ me?
Said it ‘cause I had to, that wasn’t a real apology
Scorpio my astrology, tardiness is my policy
“Lived a man, died a legend” someday will be my biography
Living and loving and learning, watching the world as it’s turning
They say that this is just murder, please let me call my attorney
Dudes, what about ‘em? See boyfriends are like assholes
Every girl’s got one, it’s just that we don’t want to hear about ‘em
I’m in London and Paris, stunt and embarrass, shopping at Harrod’s
Seeing an heiress, she lies to parents, she’s running my errands
And wondering why I dont want to get married
‘Cause I don’t give a fuck, don’t give a fuck
(Won’t you tell ‘em like)
I dont give a fuck, don’t give a fuck
In love and war there are no rules and no regulations
No judges, no congregations
No hugs and no conversations
No love and no consummation
Stop letting my confidence expose all your insecurities
And you wonder why nothing worries me
(Thought I told ‘em, you know)

[Hook]

[Outro]
I told him, “real men never ask for help”
He turned to me and said, “son, don’t flatter yourself”

Big booty, big booty ho

Big booty, big booty ho

Hump with it

[Verse 1: B Mac the Queen]
Keep it on the low, that's something you gotta know
If them two chicks had a name, it must be Duece Bigalow
It must be too official, you used to gettin' your way with niggas you know
(In the Booty club its snowing , in the booty club its snowing ohh Lord)
I'm rippin' my tab, I'm yellin' it loud, that's how we get down
They breakin' it down, all that dough on the ground, got us shakin' it now
They know we around, just me and my rounds, I be makin' my rounds
Get game from a stripper I know all about it
Stuck in the [?] they don't fit in no wallet
They mad at her, this fantastic, I'm mad happy, she poppin'
She poppin', hell yeah she poppin'
She kill her cheese before she leave, them bands ain't no for no college
For them dollas, how much you wanna bet that she givin' up knowledge
Drop it

[Hook]
She got ass, she got ass
I need that, on my lap
Run it quick, I might let you hold me stacks
And it go like that, you better know that stack

Quick fast, never slow, bust it open for the realest clique you know
You ain't fast, never slow, bust it open for the realest clique you know
Quick fast, never slow, bust it open for the realest clique you know
Quick fast, never slow, bust it open

[Verse 2: Oktane]
A fresh nigga just walked in, act like it, act like it, yeah yeah, act like it
A fresh nigga just walked in, act like it
It's time to relieve how stressed I am
I ain't gon' talk about how West I am
I ain't gon' talk about how fresh I am
Fuck am I kiddin' nigga, yes I am
Nigga that's the reason she shakin'
Friends tryin' to guess how much money I'm makin'
Dreads on my back now she think I'm Jamaican
Whatever, whenever, just do it naked
White girls they love me
Step up in this thing like fuck it
Ain't worried about no budgets
Just throw as soon as you touch it
And whenever she shake it I smack it and laugh
Then leave hella drunk out the back of the cab
Higher, higher, dab after dab
And swipin' our cards on the crack of that ass

[Verse 3: Price]
How you fit that in that denim?
I must say that I love lookin' from the outside but lord knows that I want to be in 'em
That ass is too fat to a personal tailor in London is right where you send 'em, huh
To get stitched and sew'd girl u winnin'
Commitin' adultry in my mind now I'm sinnin'
Hold up gimme a minute, start a nigga from the beginnin'
So I can say to the whole world I love big booty bitches
Animal cruelity how I do that kitten, I'm a grown ass man bitch who you kiddin'?
I'm screamin' out B Mac (B Mac)
Once we beat 'em they will never get a rematch
Throw me the cat, a nigga need that feedback
On my lap bitch, that's right where I need that

[Hook + Intro]

[Outro (2X)]
Small waist, ass fat
Look at you with the back tat
Let a real nigga tap that[Intro]
Dangerous, dangerous
These niggas can't hang with us hang with us
Nigga we dangerous, dangerous
My nigga we

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I swear all my life I been around crips and bloods
Grips and slugs, the trigger happiest thugs
Claiming the slums, and all the hoods that they from
Too much of the some, got it twisted up blinded in a rat race
Cash straight, the fake kill jake, the snakes too late
My eyes dilate, and I could tell them how he strafe
Coming at me sideways, get straighten up
Don't deflate it up gimmie the bucks my cash wrinkling up
Looking back in the days, amazed
Cause the lab rat done made it out the maze
Still feel caged, enraged though
Used the underground railroad like a runaway slave
Broke off the chains still runway fresh
Got you on that mental plane with my project jet
I'm two steps above that nimbus cloud
My limit is low, when I'm smoking on that loud
Focus in the now, when the lotus is around
It's the Brooklyn sound, a pro found, Biggie would be proud about
But I don't need a vet to even shout me out
Punchlines pack a Pacquiao they can't box me out

[Bridge: Joey Bada$$]
Big up big up, it's a stick up stick up
Niggas hit a nigga quick if he hiccup hiccup
Big up big up, it's a stick up stick up
Niggas hit a nigga quick if he hiccup hiccup
Tell me what them know bout the Badmon named Jozif
Women come around, I look em down like they don't know shit
Word around the town is that they got the match explode it

[Hook: Chronixx]
I'm a child of the city
Son of the streets
And it's just a pity
They not tough like we
And things not look pretty
When we got to eat
Things get much deeper
Deeper and deeper

[Verse 2: Chronixx]
And I survive, thank the father
Feel like I was raised by Clans One Order
Had to keep calm and hold ma corner
Cause a stray gun shot if you cross the border
Pro Era teach them the pros and cons
Of living in a city with a thousand dons
A thousand ghetto youths with a thousand guns
Cold hearted killers with frozen lungs
But praise rastafari we wheel and come again
Know I Nyabinghi sit know we the drummer dem
Dem ammunition are tougher we power dem
Lightning and thunder a devour them
Pro Era teach them the pros and cons
Original Chronixx and Joe Badmon
No King Selassie, we have the golden crown
Get ready for the shift we are the chosen ones

[Hook: Chronixx][Verse 1: Oktane]
Ok you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
To the hide out and think 'bout what we'll get high 'bout
I got my girl I blow her back out until the lights out
I marry that, gimmie that (inhales smoke)
I like my weed like my music, loud
Ladies always scream when they choosing, ow
So if we gonna do this than lets do this right now
Cause the way the world moving we could all be going down
Just know that we're behind the steering wheel just moving right
Peace and love smoke to that, who's gotta light?
Puff it now pass it down laps around the room
They want me to rap about shooting like dying is cool
No colors one race that we're losing
We'll win tomorrow, move that table and bring those brews in
Tell your followers you bring 5 girls get 2 dudes in
Gotta keep the ratio, don't play this on the radio
These models check in for me now
It's sweats and flip flops, oh this one for the pretty girls
That fuck with hip hop or real rap music or whatever you wanna call it
You never get the bigger picture from inside the wallets
So stop chasing the bread, start chasing your dreams
Internet is the feds, molly got us like fiends
Only drugs that hurt us seem to be the only ones doctors prescribe
And everything that kills us makes us all feel alive

[Hook: Oktane]
So you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
Cause you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise

[Verse 2: Pricetag]
I'm at the bonfire combing out my naps with a black pic
With a black fist vibing to some boom-bap shit
Pocket full of cash and carmax for these chapped lips
Telling stories about a black kid who loved to backflip
And rap with us cause we making booths out the mattress
Granny mad cause we recorded over all her classics
Stop the story reach into my jacket to grab some pre-rolls
Cause there's some cool people around me that I can match with
See some white skins, dark skins, mexicans
All unified by the vibes I came to represent
Fuck where you reside or your residence
You hesitant, rappers couldn't walk a mile in these shoes I'm steppin' in
Taking all challengers
Coming harder than Murphy Lee's Welcome to Atlanta verse
Ashes all on my flannel shirt
There's only one creator and love is the religion
To your heart you must listen life is too short for divisions

[Hook: Pricetag]

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Thump thump, okay, let him rap
Time to come together and connect the gap
Known as the bitch snatching bandit that always dressed in black
I think The Pack hit me like a brick I just woke up from an epic nap
Missed text about a party yea I'll probably go
Hit the lobby flow before I go, cup of coffee though
On good days the honda feel like a bugatti though
But the volumes low, hold on let me push this audio
Splendid, so now I'm headed to this shin-dig
Figure I'ma listen to this new shit that my friends did
Still the same homies ever since we all ascended
Siri interrupts the silence to say the trip has ended
Park and hop out as I wonder what could transpire
In the event of someone talking shit I'll pull my pants higher
But it's good vibes only homies 'round the campfire
Then my tribe marauders at midnight just like some vampires
You bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up don't bring no dudes
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
To the bonfire

[Interlude x5]
Get your vibe on, go on and on
Get your rhyme on, go on and on

[Verse 4: Hit-Boy]
My pack louder than a cop siren
Thats why these police ask niggas wanna silence my squad
We came to save the game from drowning like a licenced life guard
Defying all odds took trips off of water and had hawaiian broads
Suckers pray that I stop and get off the ladder
Cause they know I got the tropicana
The juice no less than a jug full
I step in one leg at a time like a fucking jump suit
You sit back and watch the show from home like Hulu
I stay on my toes like a ballet, no tutu
Haters tryna dim Gang Starr rip Guru
But I've been doing this shit since FUBU
Girls sit in traffic during rush hour just to bring me mushu
I'm like a chemist in the stu just to make sure the feel ain't dead
Big homie said you can't loaf around all day and still make bread
Shit is changing
I had to reprogram my mind and make new living arrangements
Getting rid of self imposed immitations
Still practicing patience working on my cadence
Flow high Oktane like a service station
That boy nice feigning for that feeling of significance
But you can't enjoy the benefit if you can't accept the Price
I continue to push this audio
Is he better with the producing or lyrics?
They bumping heads with they questions like Super Mario
I'm repping throwing big dubs as I coast through Cali
Repping like Chilly Chill squabbling at the bowling alley
Repping like Kent M$ney passing me gucci [?]
After I seen her at the Vibe in Riverside
I'm reppin the ill and I kept it alive
I'm reppin the ill and I keep it alive
I'm reppin the ill and I kept it alive[Skit]

Brown girl, brown girl
Turn your shit down
You know America don't wanna hear your sound
Boom boom jungle music
Go back to India
With your crazy shit, you're bombing up the area
Looking through your Instagram
Looking for a pentagram
All I see is poor people, they should be on ghetto-gram
You don't get our underground
Brofest or overground eat ham
Fist pump, even throw your dick around
Yeah you try to stick around
Do you do you bikram?
Let you into Super Bowl, you tried to steal Madonna's crown
What the fuck you on about?
Think about goin to France, quelle heure est-il
This ain't time for your terror dance
Eat, pray, love
Spend time in the Ashram
Or I'll drone you
Kony 2012
Now scram!
(Boom boom shakalaka) x12
