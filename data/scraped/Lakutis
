[Intro]
Whadup Whadup Whadup
Sit Down, Man! Sha-leik! DR
Whatitat Whatitat Whatitat
Time to do a rap

[Heems]
Hello Young Cocoa Butter, who is you?
White people love me like they love Subarus
Rolling with the super crew, something like Scooby-Doo
My eyes droopy? Mami that's what doobies do
Kalidasa, but across the Kalapani
Probably with a Khalistani mommy high as I'll be
Das Racist on a roll like wasabi
I don't know what these two are, I'm Punjabi
More cash mommy than Mukesh Ambani
And Anil Ambani, yeah that's real Armani
Yeah that's Lanvin, you call it Lanven
You call it "bro-in down", I call it "lampin"
I'm from Flushing, bright as a lamp man
That's in Queens like MC Cool Fashion
You can Google that, he's down with the Beatnuts
We got the net wet tryna get the street buck
See Dap, that's my fucking mans and shit
White boy wasted, let me write a stanza quick
Matter fact, yo, all my boys in bands and shit
Haters mad cause they got Costanza dicks
You know, like the show, Seinfeld
Michael Richards made my fucking mind melt
Cop a bundle of Rapunzel
Do what thugs do we just hustle, LATM, BBT, MTV, BET
They called us joke rap, we kinda weed rap
We just like rap, we don't even need rap
Could get a real job, only rap weekly
I don't need rap, told you, rap need me!
Indian style, knees bent, in dashiki
Your girl's sext means she wanna get freaky
She beeped me, meet me at twelve
Hit it in the shower cause it's hot as hell
My fans broken, I don't got an AC
Say I got potential, but the kid lazy

[Victor]
Stock is rising wait don't scalp the tickets yet
Older white women say I'm very articulate
Young Obama mommy, but not Illuminati
Yet, they’re tryna gauge if i’m tame enough to be their commie pet
I'm watching Gandhi til I'm charged and eating banh mi
Like they was Cars and I was Blondie
We are not the same, I'm Alf swinging a salami
At any prom queens that want me
Probably even Nicki Minaj would massage me
If I got a fade and trim my beard like I was John B
Nice finna eat more rice than Condi
Nasty, see me grace the pages of your favorite Conde Nast Publication
They asked me all about my views on relations of races
And cut out the radical shit for space, that's racist
I’m in outer space reading Frankfurt School treatises
That curl the common man into fetuses
Nietzsche told me that the nostril's where the genius is
Bossy just saucing like its falafel where my penis is
Soap 'em with Falafel like O'Reilly thought a Loofah was
Hitting they chalupa up
First I get real smart, and then I stupid up
Drop it and scoop it up, haters is dookie butts
Groupies is cooky, nuts, see me voice acting
In Space Chimps wasted like my man Stanley Tucci does
I'm truthy blood fishes get mad at me the kid is a whale
In there like a triple-A battery up in the digital scale
In the kitchen with the coca-cola corporation kicking it with me
Pepsi Co. too
The kid is a Brit me, the brother's a jitney
And other's is with me
Even if I was a tree you couldn't flip me
Don't ask what it means just kiss me, chick please, check please

[Hook]
You, we're rapping to you my friend and only you
To you! So don't ever say we never did nothing for you

[Lakutis]
Sexy Lexi, ask what the address be
Press be makin’ a face Dizzy Gillespie
Applause, pause, hand me my ESPY
Grammy, I’m Leslie Nielsen, you know I’m chillin’
Float like a butterfly come on sugar baby
On my shoulders, 7 million, sugar babies
Float away on my good looks and charm
Dick like, hot like, baby arm, chicken parm
Release the peace keeper
Chief the peach shisha
Smokin’ peace pipe ride ‘em cowboy see ya!
My chuckie cheese are bucks
My EBTs are cardies, my 18 wheelers trucks
Call up my Nelly parties
Call up my deli starving
What you mean my moneys no good here
Why — because I made it? Bitch you know I made it

[Hook][Verse 1: Heems]
I ain't wavy, man I'm an ocean
Basic unit of life, Heems is a photon
I'm Don King, I gets my promote on
I'm smooth, you rappers need lotion
I'm amazing, people laugh at my jokes
And hand me they smoke with blunts in the same bag
Pre-rolled, they roll, that's how we roll
All cause we rap about weed
I don't do that dog, I rap about me
And I ain't splashy, I am the sea
I spark grapes, I am the tree
I'm stickball, manhunt, salugi
I'm fourteen, puffin' on loosies
I'm nineteen, smokin' on loosies
I'm twenty-four, burnin' these loosies
Used to play basketball, then we started drinkin'
Used to be thinkin' like a young Dave Dinkins
Like a young Abe Lincoln in a cabin I be singin'
You can't smell me? I'm stinkin'
I'm Hindu Kush I'm Hindu Thug
I'm drugs, I'm drums, I'm dubs, I'm love
So catch the vibe, ride with it
Kids do like fences with our shit: they pick it
Get it?, stick it to the man
Riding with a caravan a mans that's from Pakistan

[Verse 2: Kool AD]
I'm in the future in Hawaii ghostwriting for your favorite rapper
Eating red snapper with grouper
Hanging with Mr. Cooper
Openin' credits, hopin' you get it
Oakland is proud
Look at the dark clouds, hard, loud
Soft and bulbous
Faster mascara snake wet generous
The kid could share a lake
Ellen DeGeneres
Type rug munchie with a scrunchie
Lotta haters wanna punch me, like a donkey
I’m Eddie Murphy in Shrek I’m complex
I’m Kanye in whiteface on the cover of Complex
Magazine. Is Lady Gaga a drag queen?
I'm Sage Francis on the cover of Beyond Race
Pee on face of any R. Kelly groupie
Type rage against machines on a spooky night
Kookie light do the right thing like Mookie might
Yo! MTV Raps cards on the spokes of my hooptie bike
Others is dookie type
Me I’m loopy type
Living the juicy life
Howser, Doogie-like
Younger brother I’m in the jungle mother
I’m in the jungle, Mama
Yeaaaah
It’s really happening
You can see me rapping and stuff
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Lakutis]
Kutiiiiiis
With the old Nautica jacket from...
96 or something
This shit is fly though
I got the, the white racing stripe only on one side
Get 'em 12-year-old me
All cross color scheme, all across colors teams
Jerseys, ya heard me?
Timbos all butter bean
Butterface, but her waist move like a snake do
Chetton Hill, salad, three steak dude
I don't wanna snake you
I just wanna copy and paste you
Take you and bathe with you, taste of you
Wait, are you able to give of the flesh like Abel do
Not able, Cain'll do
Under dig, a feign'll do
Just like, pretend you know what I'm talking about, you know
Rock yabba-dabba doo
Cut swagga dagga do
Swing vance bagga do
Good pig, that'll do
Captain of this Kangaroo
OG commander of the starship, Pike before Kirk
Life before birth
Light before night, sight beyond sight
Eye of Thundera, fire burn better
Negra Modela, cardiac arresta
Best of the best, of the best, of the best, of the best ahh
Best of the best[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
I'm the best white rapper, call me Paul Barman
I got bars man, Tarzan, Don Cheadle, Mission to Mars, man
Most of y'all sweet like marzipan
Boobie say my pipes be the heat like cars man
If the booty right, I might eat the whole jar
Can, bowl, pot, basket whatever
Rap game Pol Pot, caskets leather material
Most of these rap cats smell like posterior
Their roster's inferior
Me, I'm a monster, delirious
Half rasta, half pasta serious
Hoffa couldn't find how lost I get often
Get off it, I'm a vet, I wet possum and jet
I get off 'em and on 'em again, awesome
Honor my friends flossing
Respect the fly fashion, look at my
One ugly rugby, I took it and washed it
And kicked it to my cousin in, he was like, "Gracias, primo"
Kool A.D., amigo
La musica de amaze ocho ocho
Pero no ocho cinco, blinko blinko
I'm so, um, ridic-u-lico
Pause, shout to Mike Finito
Neato, Suave, Rico
White girl, Nico
Psychosomatic, addict insane
In my own nation like the Vatican, mayne
John Wayne on the saddle again, rattling chains
I never battled for fame or ratted
Or tattled or got mad at the game
I never batted an eye, I batted the same
Average to keep me consistently drafted, and that's it
And still managed to drop a few classics
Old school, new classes
Old view, new glasses
I told you, I do magic like David Blaine
Stand stationary, remain the same
You minor, I'm Major Payne, baby, I'm Damon Wayans
Please take me out on the fader, mayne
But wait -- no no, not yet

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
I'm in this smokey detective room
Bars full of light through the blinds
Look into his eyes
Mouth got the moth on it
Meat with the sauce on it
Jewel in the eyesocket
Picture of the kid
And your girl gold heart locket
Ice cold flow buss it, it's nothin' (it's nothin')
How am I doin' this!?
Damn sho' the gold ring, Mrs. thing ring ring
Telephone, sorry it's the President
Hold up I gotta take this, yes hello Mr. President Obama
Ho love the aesthetic but she hate the rap music
She be sayin' Lak-yoo-tis -- that's not how you say it, bitch
Check me, I'm the Don Juan, garçon
More Pellegrino, please
See me with the pedigree, marijuana medical
Don't go past two hundred
Keep it one hundred, keep it ugly funky with me
Call the bitch chunky, hit me crispy chicky
Microphone flew out the hand and knock a ho out
Damn

[Interlude: Dallas Penn]
This is one of them filthy cyphers
One of them dirty drawer cyphers
Where you didn't bathe for a few days
Not because you can't, but because you didn't want to

[Verse 3: DVS]
Rip your diplomas, cancel your Time Warner
This the last thing you need to know for the time bein'
Fly being, eyes on the prize, obvious mind readin'
Defy reasoning, mind of science is not reachin' 'em
I'm in the mirror in the picture in your Instagram
Candyman, hook in my hand, not what you think I am
Live with a plan, stand and deliver
You livin' in a van down by the river, that's unfortunate
I'm sure you thought of this, steak and a bone
Eatin' the cartilage, stay in your home, you don't want all of this
Don't even bank on the phone, remain anonymous
I'm In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, you and Eve are up out this bitch
Told you not to eat them apples you asshole
Now fast forward a couple of months, you in a bad zone
I'm still the man though, funny how things happen
Misfits step on the planet and then the track go

[Verse 4: Meyhem Lauren]
Yo, lap dances from strippers with lap bands
Come through spots and we dap hands -- what up, Dan?
I'm just chilling, trying to live
Keep the contraband out of the crib, know what I'm saying?
Rocking fly sweats, sneakers that's Gore-Tex
We come through, bitches want raw sex and beef patties
Let em carry ball bags, call em street caddies
Bump and grind on the gas line; peace, Sandy
Stay dipped, flipping like I keep my feet handy
..And that's where I ran out of clever things to say, like
I'm trying to think of something cute to say right now but
I'm about to just let the song end
You already know that we in here
Except for when we not, then we out there[Verse 1: Kitty]
I should be less creepy and less easy sounding
Please can you freeze me up zero degrees freak me
Even though I'm greasier than pizza
More tweezers I need, Jesus, my teeth they just need bleaching
I'll be sweet to you, always free, I can leave with you
Birds and bees are a mystery, teach me?
With books thicker than Tolstoy, descriptive
And most boys would liquor me up, poison trickery
But I predict that you’re gonna see me and split
Cause you’re dirty Sprite, hi, I’m Kitty, your gold teeth are the shit,
And I’m Mary Jane and you’re Petey, in the street, I’ll invert you
So greet me with kisses iconic and sweet
We aren’t even acquainted but I’m gonna wait and listen,
I really want you to want me, I really wanna take off with you
Really want you to want me, cause you’re flexing in the trap
Every time I hear your voice I have relapse

[Hook: Kitty]
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay showty, let me holler at you
Ay

[Hook: Kitty and Lakutis]

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
First off, I don't love 'em, I bag 'em, I gut 'em
And, B, I don't know where I put 'em
Angie Teresa look like Jalisa from BET, she came to see you
I'm pleased to pieces but I ain't see you, no
Yeah, you see me at the party, I see you at the party
You said, you don’t like to talk at the party
Like I’m a fireball at a party, c'mon
I can sit and smoke a ciga-cigar-gar from Cuba-Cuba-ba
This shit ain’t a mai tai, it’s Dirty Sprite, show you right
Sure you really really really really wanna be my lover?
Say you wanna go home and watch cartoons?
Yeah, me too, but not with you

Ride around town like a mobster do
High off weed and lots of booze
Meat in her tail like a lobster do
And she Dominican too, so I ain't fucking with you
Listen, mami, you really want me to want you?
Then don't want me, I got you
You really want me to want you?
Turn into a pack of bogeys
It’s cool you thought you could know me but...
Nah

[Hook: Kitty]
[Hook: Kitty and Lakutis][Verse 1: Lakutis]
I said "Fuck it", when I'm done with this shit?
I'mma spin the whole world on the tip of my dick
Let out the blood from your wrists
Bitch, you ain't fucking with me, skeleton, skeleton

[Hook]
My Jesus piece is my whole body, ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers
My Jesus piece is my whole body, ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers
My Jesus piece is my whole body, ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Finna wil' out she call out from the bedroom
Titty fall out call out "five second rule"
Beddy bye bitch she love what the dick do
Yup it's official gold in my dental, God in my Brando
Jesus piece is my whole body ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers
My Jesus piece is my whole body ya'll hoes chicken like

[Verse 3: Lakutis]
Look at the fuck have you done
Made a world where the father doesn't know his son
But the drugs let the child know God if he want
Fuck are you lookin' at one, know that you are
See that glow off my body you know I'm a star
Skeleton, skeleton, skeleton, skeleton, skeleton

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Lakutis, Lakutis, Lakutis (x2)

[Verse 4: Lakutis]
Ball so hard make a rock seem soft
Shine like a mothafucka high beams on
Bummy mothafucka made my peace with God
Slide with your baby girl, wild on the mini bar
Fuck what you talkin' bout, bitch, I'm an animal
Ya'll ain't fuckin' with me, skeleton, skeleton
Skeleton, skeleton, skeleton-on, skeleton

[Hook] (x4)[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
God damn, God damn, that's how the kid feelin'
Put that black cap on, in a rabbit hole, film it
Duckin', weavin', baskets like a Navajo
Vicky fuckin' Vazquez, couldn't see the kid if you had glasses
Couldn't see me one time with bifocals
Couldn't see me twice, with trifocals
Think global, buy local, bicoastal
Two bi hoes and they high though
Hi, ho, hi, ho, we see you workin'
Feel like 2 Chainz when I feel the two brains
GZA, Genius, it's a sin how explicit, the kid get
Leg, thigh, breast, biscuit, mmm, delicious
Small frame, big team like a kicker
Slave name Victor, lace you with the scripture
Sit back, just take it like a picture--snap
Feel it in the back of the cap, tangly
Pissin' on you morcs, tangy
Heh, right? Oh my God! (tight)

[Hook: Kool A.D.]
Tight (tight) (x16)

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
I said "Oh, God damn!", cause when my dick come out
They gotta use the shit that they weigh the whales wit'
Style on a muthafucka, bitch, Sarah Palin
Skeleton, guess I stayed a spitter just to put the
Fear of God in a pussy, Louis Farrakhan on the TV
Girls make the cross wit' they fingers when they see me
Dog, you already sold your soul for the money
You could see the golden glow off my body
I don't need a dick ridin' fucker tellin' me the shit
I know that I'm the man so you could find another sucka!
Suck another dick up, damn, the flow cold
White gold up the nose make the soul glow
With a dang caramel like a Rolo
What a man don't know don't invoke no

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire]
(Release the Kraken), her ass gon' get cracked in
Hit it from the back, on her neck like a bedspin
Crazy legs, on the cardboard when I'm smashin'
Gave me head, wiped her mouth off, said you gashin'
Dash and Blitzen, whole bunch of reindeer
Rain dance, rain dance, shawty, bring ya hands here
And the pussy like a pap smear till she shed a tear
Um, she cried, um, that's weird
Like that fool Kassa, you won't get the reference
Spit it off the top of the head like a dead dick
Chlamydia, gonorrhea, it's rainin' AIDS blood
Catch me drinkin' Everclear in Castle Grayskull
That's some shit I made up, (release the Kraken)
I was bullshittin', I wasn't really rappin'
Shout my nigga Alex, my nuts just spray dust
Now, pause that line cause that shit sounded gay as fuck
Shout my nigga Le1f, that nigga there gay as fuck
Seen him at the Whitney sunday all sprayed up
White like some toothpaste (toothpaste), shoelace (shoelace)
Two face (two face), soufflé (soufflé), I ate it, butt naked
Her pussy so tight, make my face twitch
That's flagrant, I hate it, fuck Mike Finito
This verse was some bullshit, you love it tight

[Hook]

[Outro]
Release the Kraken!(Yo, when I was just a little boy
My grandma used to sing me a little song
And it went, and it went like this)

Rap rap music

Silly babies running shit
Silly babies running shit
Swann Gangg, Swann Gangg
This shit is the raw, man
[Hook]
Fuck your favorite anything
You fucking suck at everything
You fucking suck for anything
Nickel, socks, go!

[Verse 1: Lakutis]
Me and D go and the pageantries roll out
The dancers get dolled up
The elephants dub down
The tigers get sucked off
You and your mans get fucked up
The marmosets jumps up and stab a bitch

Catch me slam dancing in the pit
Like Lazarus
Something corny like the industry
Fucked up
The bones have been picked clean
But Myer gets laughed up
(Art)
The point is I'm the man
Just pick up the e-chain

All you little birches get dusted out
Suck it
All you fucking Fergusons my mother fucking sons and shit
Like my name was Clarissa and my father was an architect
Bitch hair, Birkenstocks, everything!

Dead like my father was a carpenter
I ain't have no father why my shit be so immaculate
I'm the richest man cause mines is the purest avarice
Mines is the finest advocates
Picture a fucking tarantula

[Hook x2]
Fuck your favorite anything
You fucking suck at everything
You fucking suck for anything
Swann Gangg genesis

[Verse 2: DVS]
You now rocking with the young John Belushi
I spit shit in your champagne
Cough on your sushi
My sick, sinister campaign
All the girls try to sue me and this
This is a damn shame, so many groupies

Street urchin, market a beast
Up on a fleece, when ya seen him
Seen a marketing genius
I guess I'm open
Told by Serena to peace
But ya'll saw loving
Talking to Venus

It's the DVS, opposite of a Seacrest
Top of the heap, here, playa
Chopping your weak chest
To be the man you gotta beat the man
You need a manager?
Just deliver your pizza man

Top bridges knocking on ya'll bidness
Give me guap that's what Willis is talking about, bitches
(Remember, the show?)
Fuck ya'll if you don't feel this
Swann Gangg was a popular group - and still is

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Lakutis]
I flow both ages
Oh, dope shapeshift
Kevin so blow
With goat rope
With the Oasics

[DVS]
So flagrant
Running the place ragin'
I leavin' the whole nation
Is royalty, bodacious

[Lakutis]
Got the Kiwi Capri-Sun
See, son, each one, beseech one
Beast ball, bitch
Brando apocalypse
Now re-dub
Daddy Warbucks, Mommy Mean Mugs
Hold me on this shit
No refunds!

[DVS]
Piff to the Matrix
Lipton Brisk ass mix
Bitch, get a face lift
I spit liquid amazin'
I drink liquor with bacon
I don't think you can visit my station

[Lakutis]
Screaming keep Yerk out the moon roof
Till my feet hurt
Leaving out the teeth, Burt
Hoop out the Jeep, sir

[DVS]
I'm back on my Deepak Chopra
Relax, I spit the crack that could relapse over ya[Verse 1: Big Baby Gandhi]
Sippin on the palmer
Lookin like a bomber
Spit it to your momma
Thinkin I'm Obama
Hotter than a sauna
Colder than a pillow
Rolling like a villain
Holla if you feel low
Still a wizard killing
Me I want a million
Bitches that's Brazilian
Money to the ceiling
Now I'm Young No Money
Spent all my show money
Spend it on a ho money
Drop it on a ho tell me
Yeah we can't have babies havin babies
Imagine me with a kid at 22 while I try to play me
Be even broker than I am now
Sucks like sham-wow
So safe sex is the plan now
And older me make better decisions
Stay home and watch television
My inner vision of better living
I've seen it, I better believe it
56 inch Zenith, like I got a 56 inch penis
56k!

[Verse 2: Nigel Nasty]
Catch me actin in the club something serious
Arizona labor day, women on their periods
Cool water curve cologne, I'm off my own patron
Anti-social so I'm looking at my phone for bone
Leave alone and I hop on the Ducati
Hotbox the helmet, feel it in my body
Grand central parkway, bought a baby parkay (Smooth!)
Jackie Rob rob your life with a shark splay
Information high stakes, optimistic primate
Beast mode, beast wars, CGI I'm high mane
Power up like nightsteel
Regroup like ReBoot
Regroup my people on chat room, be back soon
I just wanna dance like a baby
GIF me out ma, GIF me out, web's going crazy
22 male from Queens where your friends be
No photo on my profile, inbox looking empty

[Verse 3: Lansky]
Peace to my Queens team, party like the '86 Mets
Joint's slick, a bitches place is a mess (clean this shit up)
Designer drugs finest ones they all spent
Comin off mattins this white like the child of tibet
Listen baby I'm a New York Met
I used to play the park bench
Saw them pitchin out a head coach
And iced to ice to gold chains
Those were the days
Bring pops that was the thing graduated the lane
See bitches that was reminding me kids they baby fathers
And babies havin babies they're livin any kind of way
New York is douchebags, friendly on the chit chat
They be the type to boss up never give you sit back
Learned this back in 5th grade when nigga stole my Donkey Kong and
Had to retaliate, facing suspension I'm a good kid
Never took far from a crook man
Ironic how i thought about this all in central booking

[Verse 4: Antwon]
Before Google Chrome, and online scriptures
I had the AOL, used to jack off to pictures
Had a internet girlfriend, used to send me pictures
One was a mall goth and the other lived in Texas
Had a wicked one that swore she threw hexes
She gonna cut my dick off if another girl I'm sextin
'Twon in the Lexus
Drinking on the side of the shit, side of the whip
Bean pies fries and some dip
When I die 56K to my bad kid
But can a nigga live
I'm eatin scrimps chutney on the chips
I'm hater on my firewall
That's how real it gets
People think i'm blowing out
No ants to spit
But my friends broke too knowin how it is
Living day to day
Hope a nigga make it through
The ethernet bumping when the Comcast kills you
Nigga!

[Hook: Chippy Nonstop]
Ring a ting a ting, it's that dialup connection
Bad bitches on twitter that deserve a mention
Ring a ting a ting, it's that dialup connection
Bad bitches on twitter that deserve a mention
(It's that dialup connection, it's that dialup connection)

[Verse 5: Lakutis]
Running round my home town
Every day I spread my seed
Hundred blue eyed devils speakin spanish be my legacy
Me I'm born and raised New York but old earth Russian (Russian!)
Mixing up that heritage, Bitch more 'tussin (Tussin'!)
Smoke something so fucking ill I
Make a million every fucking minute can I
Get up in that gushy you can have my pack of gushers
Mami I still work whole bottles cocky
These old copper's will never find me
Damn I'm the man though (I'm the man!)
Style out the wazoo (That's a butt!)
Bitches say we love you
Fly out to watch you
I wish I could watch two
Mickey in the watch boo
Gotta rub me the right way genie in a bottle

Shoryuken shoryuken sh sh shoryuken shoryuken
Sh sh shoryuken shoryuken
Sh sh shoryuken shoryuken
Sh sh shoryuken shoryuken
(Lakutis Lakutis Lakutis lakutis)

[Verse 6: DVS]
DVS!
(Welcome!)
Call me the product of shoddy politics
Sloppy economy shittin bitch
And never call me again
I'm a commodity
I'll properly Macaulay my property
Home alone, paint can to the dome
Log off off my prodigy
That's how you say "get off my dick" in technology
It outghta be common knowledge but probably it college garbage
Word is bond that my modern day Sean Connery puff tropical marley
I'm unstoppable man (unstoppable man)
We them Duane Reade babies in the streets crazy
Eat loosies, drink Everclear, get zooted, and piss everywhere
Illuminati want my screenname and my body they gon' upload me to jail
Ghost in the shell
[?] get close to me
Hold a post like a rosary
Call the pope in to cope with me
Hopefully JoDeCi no
You could bring in all your gospel apostles
Impossible to knock me off line
(Goodbye!)

[Verse 7: Kitty Pride]
I'm all blue and orange, I think in portals
I'm Al Gore get on my global warming shit
I'll beat you more and more at it
Of course I got my cheats I'll make it gory again
I'll never get bored of it because I respawn
I'm a primadonna en linea, eating all of your dinners
I'm Michael Bolton beating all of your printers
I'm literati and wittier than you thought
You can follow my twitter at kitavel'
If I writ it then it's written well
Simply browsing my flickr begins to get it wet
And get erect, you're dim and I'm glimmering like I'm glitter text
I'm grim as if I'm Billy and Mandy
Stealing your fans, B
I'm willing and handy
I'll make sure you get Mr. Hands Instagram
I hope you get bit by a million ants
And get shipped to distant lands
Rap game tiny Danzig, I'm a little Misfit
Oops I did it again, because I'm Brit, bitch

[Verse 8: Ne$$ of Weekend Money]
Weekend Money!
Sight of sex, Twitter beef
Chief Keef, Lil B
Credit card scam slinging grams on my twitter feed
Nigga gotta eat baby starvin round the way
EBT card balance low, baby mama cray
Money slow like 56K, you know dialup
Still 56 ways hustle-nomics by any means
While you was bracin for that Y2K
We mary jane and this white girl
Menage a tray all night till the daylight
Thugs dimes and trays
You know riding around getting it, no 2 Chainz
I ain't talking nothing fancy, Brooklyn bound 2 train
In the city with the skinny nigga end up slain dang
I'm just trying to spit these raps out
Waking up to the sound of a Mac poppin, no laptop
Diary of a trap rapper Ness
Signing off nigga, live from the apple

[Hook: Chippy Nonstop]
Ring a ting a ting, it's that dialup connection
Bad bitches on twitter that deserve a mention
Ring a ting a ting, it's that dialup connection
Bad bitches on twitter that deserve a mention
(It's that dialup connection, it's that dialup connection)[Verse 1: Heems]
I ain't wavy, man I'm an ocean
Basic unit of life, Heems is a photon
I'm Don King, I gets my promote on
I'm smooth, you rappers need lotion
I'm amazing, people laugh at my jokes
And hand me they smoke with blunts in the same bag
Pre-rolled, they roll, that's how we roll
All cause we rap about weed
I don't do that dog, I rap about me
And I ain't splashy, I am the sea
I spark grapes, I am the tree
I'm stickball, manhunt, salugi
I'm fourteen, puffin' on loosies
I'm nineteen, smokin' on loosies
I'm twenty-four, burnin' these loosies
Used to play basketball, then we started drinkin'
Used to be thinkin' like a young Dave Dinkins
Like a young Abe Lincoln in a cabin I be singin'
You can't smell me? I'm stinkin'
I'm Hindu Kush I'm Hindu Thug
I'm drugs, I'm drums, I'm dubs, I'm love
So catch the vibe, ride with it
Kids do like fences with our shit: they pick it
Get it?, stick it to the man
Riding with a caravan a mans that's from Pakistan

[Verse 2: Kool AD]
I'm in the future in Hawaii ghostwriting for your favorite rapper
Eating red snapper with grouper
Hanging with Mr. Cooper
Openin' credits, hopin' you get it
Oakland is proud
Look at the dark clouds, hard, loud
Soft and bulbous
Faster mascara snake wet generous
The kid could share a lake
Ellen DeGeneres
Type rug munchie with a scrunchie
Lotta haters wanna punch me, like a donkey
I’m Eddie Murphy in Shrek I’m complex
I’m Kanye in whiteface on the cover of Complex
Magazine. Is Lady Gaga a drag queen?
I'm Sage Francis on the cover of Beyond Race
Pee on face of any R. Kelly groupie
Type rage against machines on a spooky night
Kookie light do the right thing like Mookie might
Yo! MTV Raps cards on the spokes of my hooptie bike
Others is dookie type
Me I’m loopy type
Living the juicy life
Howser, Doogie-like
Younger brother I’m in the jungle mother
I’m in the jungle, Mama
Yeaaaah
It’s really happening
You can see me rapping and stuff
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Lakutis]

Jerseys, ya heard me?
Timbos all butter bean
Butterface, but her waist move like a snake do
Chetton Hill, salad, three steak dude
I don't wanna snake you
I just wanna copy and paste you
Take you and bathe with you, taste of you
Wait, are you able to give of the flesh like Abel do
Not able, Cain'll do
Under dig, a feign'll do
Just like, pretend you know what I'm talking about, you know
Rock yabba-dabba doo
Cut swagga dagga do
Swing vance bagga do
Good pig, that'll do
Captain of this Kangaroo
OG commander of the starship, Pike before Kirk
Life before birth
Light before night, sight beyond sight
Eye of Thundera, fire burn better
Negra Modela, cardiac arresta
Best of the best, of the best, of the best, of the best ahh
Best of the best[Verse 1: Lakutis]
Ay yo, let’s go
Text those bitches with the boots
Sex for X though, bury with the goose
Stomp you out with some now or later shoes
Now or later choose
Violator proof!
Flask of Henny in the suit
Becky in the coup
Now she wanna spoon like Jewish Eddie for the soup
You better know my flow so cold mothafucka
Bust a nut like a icicle put it in her

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Chill bitch sit with this on a Adderall
Coke dope float up nose I’m a animal

Rock the soccer mama boot
Slap your baby mama
Baby feel it too
Baby feel it in the womb
Baby baby I’m gon’ win and you gon’ lose

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
I’m over seas my man

These hoes is all on me
These thirsty bitches OD
Yo, why they hatin' on me?
(You gave ‘em the dutchie
That’s a gift my G)

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Kitty]
I should be less creepy and less easy sounding
Please can you freeze me up zero degrees freak me
Even though I'm greasier than pizza
More tweezers I need, Jesus, my teeth they just need bleaching
I'll be sweet to you, always free, I can leave with you
Birds and bees are a mystery, teach me?
With books thicker than Tolstoy, descriptive
And most boys would liquor me up, poison trickery
But I predict that you’re gonna see me and split
Cause you’re dirty Sprite, hi, I’m Kitty, your gold teeth are the shit,
And I’m Mary Jane and you’re Petey, in the street, I’ll invert you
So greet me with kisses iconic and sweet
We aren’t even acquainted but I’m gonna wait and listen,
I really want you to want me, I really wanna take off with you
Really want you to want me, cause you’re flexing in the trap
Every time I hear your voice I have relapse

[Hook: Kitty]
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty, let me holler at you
Ay shawty

Ay showty, let me holler at you

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
First off, I don't love 'em, I bag 'em, I gut 'em
And, B, I don't know where I put 'em
Angie Teresa look like Jalisa from BET, she came to see you
I'm pleased to pieces but I ain't see you, no
Yeah, you see me at the party, I see you at the party
You said, you don’t like to talk at the party
Like I’m a fireball at a party, c'mon
I can sit and smoke a ciga-cigar-gar from Cuba-Cuba-ba
This shit ain’t a mai tai, it’s Dirty Sprite, show you right
Sure you really really really really wanna be my lover?
Say you wanna go home and watch cartoons?
Yeah, me too, but not with you

Ride around town like a mobster do
High off weed and lots of booze
Meat in her tail like a lobster do
And she Dominican too, so I ain't fucking with you
Listen, mami, you really want me to want you?
Then don't want me, I got you
You really want me to want you?
Turn into a pack of bogeys
It’s cool you thought you could know me but...
Nah

Whose side are you on
Get to the chopper

You fly with the swarm
Live from the eye of the storm
Lighting the light of the swarm

See me right out your balcony
Ridin the ride of the Valkyries
Smack the shit out of me

Black Swann x8[verse 1]
These bitches front like they ain't know I was the illest out
Cool J couch, camo hidden in the freaking house
Homegirl said she want me, put it in her mouth
You see them bitches crowd around, you know Lakutis in the house
I'm getting paper like a neighbor on the route
Bad man, see me coming, rush your children in the house
Bar the windows, act up
I will end your life on Foo Fighters with the Mentos
You don't meet no kin folk, you's a crazy bitch though
Doug Funnie with the banjo, eat the pussy like the baby with the dingo
I'm a star like Ringo, I'm a star like Han to my wrist froze out you
Hi boo, how you?

Girl, I know you miss the things that we do

[verse 2]
Damn, I don't like how she surround them dudes

She had the nerve to walk up and ask me "how are you?"
I said, "Astounding, you?"
She said, "Better, now that you around, and you?"
I said, "I'm fine, and you?"
She said, "I'm good, you too?"
I said, "ooh ooh ooh"
She said, "woo woo woo", shit
"That's Living Single, man I watch that too."
She said, "I watch that too."
I said, "Ha ha, that's true."
She said

"Boy, I cannot believe the way you treat me
You have got to change or say goodbye to me."

Carvel everything is marvel x4

[Verse 1: Heems
Carvel everything is marvelous
People see me shining and they always trying to start some shit
I'm a fucking problem bitch
See me up in Harlem mobbing with a lot of kids
Got guap like I won the Lotto kid
Got guap, a lot of it
That's why they always follow the kid
Each one teach one, I teach a lot of kids
They poppin' off at the mouth 'til you pop 'em in the mouth
On the queue list they know I was the illest album
I'm in Corona bumping "My Sharona"
Trying to get bread like Tommy Matolla
Oh Motorola, all world that know him
All foes folding, formed before him
Cash that I'm holdin', suits has been spoken
Heems needs some focus, Heems is so hopeless

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
More kicks than armored sneakers shooting the fair one
Divine design shine fly rhyme outclass 'em
Sling saliva bare fruits and Godiva right
Keep a liver height, broke bread with China white
Derelict dialects that special designer type
Fly flows, hit Opa Opa for gyros
Bag a fucking package then buy clothes, your welcome
If a man can't admit his own faults you can't help him
Next scene, peace to my living quarters
On the streets looking wavy like you swim in waters
Splash, my whole essence is aquatic
Move from my past, look back, it ain't forgotten
It's new New York in this bitch, nigga we got it
You only get as much of the script as we alotted
Street olympians and self-medicated measure weight
Hard body heavy hitter floating like a featherweight

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lakutis]
Here comes the fly motherfucker in the hoodie
Blacker than what you see when you die motherfucker
The cutest on the rise motherfucker
Billy Crystal's throwing rocks at your window
Looking crazed from the liquor
Low pro ever sicker but I felt never better
Can't believe I see a man in the mirror
Ask the devil in my mind "What the fuck's with the get up?"
But I fucks with you, baby
By god I'mma show these little bitches how I die multiply
Like a hotstepper, maybe you could do it since you such a mind reader, rottweiler
Jump and bite the fucking throat up out a hater with a gold teether
Crown of thorns on the dome
I'm a Jesus with the features of a demon
Whip a bitch ass so fast
Scientists analyzing what if I'm a feeder, rob and stealer

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ness]
RBG raggin' on my snap back
Like a scribble on a lap where that cash at
She make it rain every time that ass clap
Tears drop every time that gat clap
She always crying, who, the ambulance
Shots fired, everybody out here doing the hammer dance
Running man, running man, running man
Sh-sh-shooter running down the street with a gun in hand
Heard it through the vine it was over a hundred grams
Four racks in a McDonalds bag wrapped in rubber bands
Now he a wanted man, old west poster
Lost in the moment like Tony on the phone with Sosa
Life's a rollercoaster, Wild Water Kingdom
O.G. said be like water, I be listenin'
Rollercoaster, Wild Water Kingdom
O.G. said be like water, keep it moving man[Verse]
Seven horns, seven eyes, bitch call me Kevin, I
Hit you with the bucket bitch, make Michael Jordan dance
These other rappers swear they raw, close but no cigar
These motherfuckers wanna brawl with the golden God
Bitch you could never get on my level
Ho I been poppin', carve my own
Stone chess piece Tim Robbins
Microphone flow cold, your bitch on it
Homegirl rockin' her some Chinese slippers
Iron Mike tooth with the Brando leather
See your ass again one time I'ma fuck her
Bust one nut, it was time to deliver
Fuckin' with my gods
Peep the fucking demon, and gon' just be what they saw
Hoes be fuckin' geeking when they think he finished
Watch how they applaud when he really finished
Leave him like the golden awkward faces melted off

[Outro]
I want they face off, face off
Face off, take they face off
Where's your god now?

[Hook: Lakutis]
Homegirl rockin' her some Chinese slippers
Iron mic tooth with the Brando leather[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
I’m from that 456 line, that cocaine brick time
Razor blades rest on my tongue, cutting curfew, shit
I’m from the slums, let me serve you
Real cause my verbal ill, bring the hearse through
Killer papis murk you, Chill
Cold shoulders how I build
Motorola ringing still, with that old flow, Dojo
Chop that work, coco, snowcone, icy
My quarter’s real pricey, hide the crack up in my socks
Now it’s stinking up my Nikes
I got bars, hit this converse, chucking up the dirt
Motherfucker loading SK's, Nahright
Got that bitch like "nah, right?"
Across the jaw, should have paid attention to your blind side
Tanboy, mob life, second coming god like
Spanish Harlem all the way to Wash Heights, love by
Tanboy, mob life, second coming god like
Spanish Harlem all the way to Wash Heights, love by

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Slap a tooth out a ho mouth
Tell 'em I told you, tell 'em I owed you
See me coming out the bodega with a dutchie and a jumbo Goya juicebox
Looking tight-bummy in my tube socks
Y'all all soft, all off, I go raw dog on a bitch, ya'll go soft
On a bitch, ride till I'm rich, fly as a bitch. (daamn)
Death is not an option, I'll come back and haunt em
Fuck it if they want him, can't see him cause he on one
Bust that ill shit, head explode
Leave that bitch bloody in the road
Me that shit dunny, check the flow
You don't wanna test the water
Death shark, death shark, blood in the water
Fuck your man bitch, look he a goner
He try, he die, he lie
He not like me

[Verse 3: Heems]
Me, me, me, it’s all about me
Mi, mi, mi, mi, that’s a vocal warm up

I'm on that F Train, I'm on that BQE
The best brain, she freak with me, frequently
Everybody love me, I'm Raymond
I'm Tony Bourdain, I don't need a reservation
Okay then, I'm wasted, geeked and I'm spacing
Weed that I'm blazing, and E that it's laced with
Codeine and some K, and we freaking and shaking
My seeds that she's tasting, cream that we wasting
Jesus, I'm Bacon, reach in the spaceship
Green that I'm making, Greece for vacation
Scenes they vacating, keep them placated
Eat and then say shit, the beat that I’m slaying
Is palpably, probably, purposely playing
Seems like it's pavement, concrete solid
Features? of bacon, hole in my heart
That is keeping swaying
Death is not an option, I'll come back and haunt em
Fuck it if they want, ah-ah-ah-ah
Death is not an option, I'll come back and haunt em(Hook)
I am a Death Shark

Hydroponic
I mix the henny
With the hypnotic

(Yo, true. Yes)

(Hook)

Artsy farts
When he turn shit, let's Marky Mark
In the apartment
When the sea parted I was there with no clothes and no toes
Screaming, "No photos!"
Looking like, wild retarded
Soul future
C-3po
Baby, no tee pee
Oh, hey he can use the three seashells
A beached whale attracting conscious young females
With little safari shorts and glasses
But still know how to shake their asses
I remember one year ago I made Caribbean
One broad from the Caribbean is worth like 25 from any other region
Keep dreaming, keep keep dreaming
Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding

(Hook)

My blood is made of bones and other people's blood
My bones are made of blood and other people's bones

These fuckers swear they hard
They want you to think they god
But they power a mirage
If they fucking with you god
Stab 'em in they pussy hard
Death is easy, life is hard, show them who the fuck you are
Have him picking up his teeth up off the floor
Break it down, fuck around, fuck a hater, fuck a clown
Ho, I never needed nobody, the fuck I need you now?
Show me titty if you down, if you fucking with the sound
Got no condom, fuck a condom, we can use just what's around

[Hook][Verse 1: Nigel Nasty]
What up fellas, haven't seen you in about a year
Now I'm here, we can get it started with some dollar beers
I'm with my brother Lex, glad you brought your lady friend
Looking rather excellent, thinner than a safety pin
Aroused by your features, desire
Tab-oo when I take a look at you, getting higher
By the third song, got the room spinnin'
Finger running through your walls, turnin' it to linen
Shit my lips numb, can't feel my knees
With all the vapors dawg, I'm turning japanese
Nah really I, I really think so
Now you're telling me your brother gotta drink slow
I can't fuck witchu, it's all a roller coaster
I'm rolling on the motion, wanna feel you closer
But I never really got a grasp
Filling up my flask, while I crash on the bloody grass

[Hook]
I've been on a search for all this
Baby I just wanna feel right
Every time I feel it, its true
And I've been in a slump for awhile
You're in my dreams
Get outta my head

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Yo you and me been together for awhile girl
You make me feel fucking weird as shit inside girl
Plus when I'm with you, we don't ever leave the house
Prolly cause I'm, though, scared to leave the house
I'm too weird to leave the house, look at my hands
What the, fuck is wrong with my hands, yo we should probly
Leave the house tho, nah there's mad cops outside tho
The neighbors might talk to me, some fucking weirdo might talk to me
Fuck it, let's turn off the lights and draw the curtains
It's not even worth it
I don't even feel like a person
I bet I'm mad strong right now, but I'm sweating
Like a motherfucker, plus I'm kinda horny
But if I tried to fuck right now, it'd probly feel like mad bones
And skin and blood and shit and that's weird and shit, shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Baby Gandhi]
Girl, why you trippin' on me?
Just half out back, we was sippin' on tea
The more time I spend with you the more you got me buggin'
But you know what? I love it
Felt you on my tongue, I had to succumb
Now every single thing I say is dumb
When I put you on my eyelids, so you're the only thing
I see, walkin' around the island, that's NYC
When you with me the sun shines brighter
The breeze feels nicer, now I rhyme tighter
Plus music sound just like how sex feel
Sex feel like the X pill, yo that's ill
You got me so at peace, I wonder if this how death feel
You make me feel like I could jump out this window
And fly so high, never ask, why?

This beat like a nic freak and I'm first to skeet

[Verse 2] (Squadda B)
Catch a flashback, it's school time with backpacks
This shit wild, my nigga, we grew past that
Get a lap dance by the money we worked so hard for
Superstar, ??? Italian, need a foreign car for
Colors on my clothes, rebel, like Darfur
They hypnotize the ghetto one by one when I make art for
Things change so I gotta move accordingly
All that talking, all that chilling that shit boring me
Five chapters who I live for, important to me
I get lost chasing my dreams, life's a snore to me
I get whatever I want, life's a whore to me
A self-made thousandaire, you recording me
Face like an I.D., yeah bitch I'm good here
Quit popping them tags, it's a new year
Face like an I.D., yeah bitch I'm good here
Quit popping them tags, it's a new year

[Verse 3] (TRPLBLK)
"Bruiser" (ad nauseum)

[Verse 4] (Chavis Chandler)
Bitches ain't shit
Ain't none of these hoes 'bout nothin'
And I don't really know what they want from me
But I love 'em, yeah I'll get my love, baby

[Verse 5] (TRPLBLK)
You fuckin' with a bruiser, you gotta play to win
Go get my money, wipe that cum off your chin
I set up a lick we get them boxes at ten
We celebrating with a lot of pussy juice and lot of Hen'
Blunt smoke, power back shots and long strokes
Gag reflexes, the bitch don't choke
Get Daddy bread and she bring it by the loaf
She like the way Daddy's semen coat her throat

[Verse 6] (Chavis Chandler)
This bitch is possessed by the gold Rolex
All she want is the sex and she
Tryna find words to get that penny up out of me with the fondling
But I ain't really about the shit, so
I try to think and be observant
This situation is happening current-ly
Oh, my God, she's tryna ruin me
Tryna run away with my heart, but I ain't gonna let her, cause naw
Bitches ain't shit
Ain't none of these hoes 'bout nothin'
And I don't really know what they want from me
But I love 'em, yeah I'll get my love, baby

[Verse 7] (Kool A.D.)
Kool A.D., D.R., Greedhead
Shout out to Clayton, the P.R. weedhead
Beat so smooth, you could call it yacht rap
You don't need a yacht, get your rich boy to cop that
Check me out, I'm Ice T
Hecka little cocoas wanna wife me
My money's so likely, I don't like it but I like me
Twice it but I like three, triple that, lickupon a nipple fat
Fake Jackson Pollack in a Danish hotel
All for the stories that your famous bro tell
Do a lot of shows and it go well
And if they don't, then "oh well"
Don't like to go to hell
Watch me when I get my money up I'mma go Chappelle
Long vacations in developing nations
Leaning on promethazine
Young brown Kreayshawn, shoulda been a cop, like Pace Won
R.I.P. Ason Unique, ayo, plus, also fuck B-Unique
Hoes in front rows at shows, I see you, freak
Every week shark week, I call it tuba week, short for ???
*speaking spanish or portuguese?*
See your boy in Costa Ric, a freakin' on a chocha Rica, yee-haw
Ride 'em cowboy, cheeba that curious strong, that Altoids

[Verse 8] (Big Baby Gandhi)
Hola, yo soy Nafis
Ya boy, ya beast, in a St. Croix fleece
??? sneaks, on the mic a joy to say the least
Off the mic, stay annoyin' my peeps
Asleep on the train, woke up on the boulevard
Weed, cocaine and the dope up on my boulevard
Where they pull your card if you're looking too hard
I got this one incense, got me smelling like God
Whole world trash and the human race dirty
Old world clash with the new one's raised badly
Sadly, how come family ain't family
Gag me, kill me, take me out my misery
You did it for the dollar bill, I did it for the dollar bill
Main difference is that I spent it how a scholar will
Did it with a lotta skill, lyric cause I swallow pill
There's like 30 dudes rapping, so I'mma chill

[Verse 9] (Key Nyata)
Sheeit, I'm probably perkin' forever
Cause if the pimpin' is poppin' it's similar to Beretta
It's goin' off, so every time I visit her house
She take my dick up out my pants and put it straight in her mouth
Young fly nigga, Raider Klan stand for the 2010
Plus two, I'm tryna fuck you and
If the game is tight, then I can make her come too
Gimme the cash, gimme the cash, like I'm robbin' you
Shit, I gives a fuck about your talkin', boo
Cause if it wasn't for that ass, I wouldn't talk to you
Love cash so I'm racetrack walkin' you
Pimpin', you niggas tender like chicken
Call that girl fender cause the way that she bendin'
Jheri curl drippin', hear what a nigga say
Can't fuck wit' a nigga in the mack game

[Interlude] (Key Nyata) [x2]
I want you to bring me the cash
I said I want you to bring me the cash
I said want you to bring me the cash
One time, two times for that ass

[Verse 10] (Isaiah Toothtaker)
Toothtaker make a motherfucker repeat himself
Whatcha talkin' 'bout, who you think you're talkin' to?
Say it face to face, see if it comes out the same way
We don't play, I thought you knew
Actions speak loudest, so just let your mouth rest
Countless accounts expressed, you can't prove
We found out and now, we gon' test miles down southwest
You best to claim true
And I don't know where you're going with this
It won't be over unless they put me under arrest
I put you under the ground, they want to serve and protect
I wanna serve clowns and burn shit down
In the match, little lighter me
To be a little brighter I gotta fire desire
Live the life of a fighter
I'm ridin' around the corner on the block
Ignoring city ordinance, street signs and stop
I got the guts and the glory, you can give it all you got
I'ma find what rhymes with orange, extraordinary guy
I think I'm more important, my priorities are top
I get it off and poppin' like I'm Orville Redenbacher
Excuse me doctor, why am I so sick?
Excuses, excuses, you just the shit
Ain't no flu, you make music illicit
Make yo' bank and then make pigs suck your dick

[Interlude] (Supa)
It's so outrageous, man this shit's so crazy, so crazy
It's so outrageous, they way that they keep hatin', keep hatin'
It's so outrageous, but homey y'all can't phase us, can't phase us
It's so outrageous, cause homey we stay faded, stay faded

[Verse 11] (Joeybagadoughnutz)
Know where the trap's at, got tats, might snap
Bags, two tracks and an automatic Mac
That don't mean you can rap, you can still be wack
Mighta got the look down but it's lyrics you lack
I'll be damned to, copy what they do on camera
If it's cool, I'm a nerd, Lambda Lambda Lambda
In a Bama bandana, cram to examine my hinges (?)
And judge the fans who test his name to enter answers
Cause he ain't as cool as you think
That's why they get on, and then they gone
Before you can blink, ain't shit without a clique
Bet they wouldn't even sting, brains like a little chain
I think they missin' a link, I can pick 'em out like a booger
They claim to be gettin' pussy but tanks full of sugars
Should you continue to let 'em pose?
You the one that's in control
Cause as it ain't so the label says no mo'
It's quick to let 'em go, so you should go

[Verse 12] (Supa)
Tryna make it 'round the world, like them Globetrotters
Flow hotter but I still gotta go harder
Can't stop, never quit, what the weak do
Gotta hustle round the clock, that's what we do
Can't blow it on some bullshit, can't afford to do it
Spaced out in my zone feeling Sortahuman
Yeah we take the work and flip it like a hotcake
Tree smokin' hell good, think my pot laced
It's so outrageous, man this shit's so crazy, so crazy
It's so outrageous, they way that they keep hatin', keep hatin'
It's so outrageous, but homey y'all can't phase us, can't phase us
It's so outrageous, cause homey we stay faded, stay faded

[Verse 13] (Dizzy D)
It's so outrageous, fantastic, phenomenal
Hits your cerebral and all in your abdominal
Goosebumps come quick, weird astronomical
Y'all so comical, we so muy fuego
So sick, gross like Juggalo's Faygo
We got the good and the bad, horns and haloes
Gotta stay paid though, Sortahuman's on the game
Til I'm under the red clay, over everything
Some cats'll do anything, your boy say anything
Almost like a bloodlust, never bit by the fangs
Not in the same lane, we are not the same thing
Roll with a gang full of stoners, don't gang bang
Elevated minds, embraced where this changed
Fuck all the hype, forget stereotypes
We enjoy rappers, not rappers that are white
Fuck labels whether record labels or in real life

[Interlude] (Supa)
It's so outrageous, man this shit's so crazy, so crazy
It's so outrageous, they way that they keep hatin', keep hatin'
It's so outrageous, but homey y'all can't phase us, can't phase us
It's so outrageous, cause homey we stay faded, stay faded

[Verse 14] (Snaxx)
It's so contagious, the way we stay sprayin' it
The way I stay faded like an artist's picture when he paint it
Maybe that's shady, maybe I'm mistaken
Takin' this shit more seriously than I should
But if I could, I would leave it all behind
Find a different grind
Chron to mid chron is what I'm hittin' on
This shit here, this shit here
Have your mind spinnin' and trippin'
You're catchin' the fear, maybe it's this year, maybe it's not
No matter what happen we gon' stick to the plot
This music shit must not stop
This my outlet cause I don't like goin' to outlets
For outfits, I sit in this bitch and push out hits
Like it ain't shit, life's just a bitch
That I intend to fuck so good luck tryna fuck me
Now go on, light the blunt and fill the cups up with Hennessey

[Interlude] (Supa)
It's so outrageous, man this shit's so crazy, so crazy
It's so outrageous, they way that they keep hatin', keep hatin'
It's so outrageous, but homey y'all can't phase us, can't phase us
It's so outrageous, cause homey we stay faded, stay faded

[Verse 15] (Left Leberra)
This shit sound like a ski trip
Stuck on the chairlift, tight rap ain't this
Left Leberra, trick, most known unknown
Digital Underground, bitch I got a bunch of sounds
Tryna run the net, nigga you can run the town
Pow, pow, get your fuckin' power up
Stop takin' power naps
We the shat, we the shit
Past and present tense
No offense, bitch, drop into a split

[Verse 16] (Don D)
Woke up, like I know we won
Frontin' ain't on me for puttin' on
It's a pawn, so we looked at Shawn
Business is personal
Locally respected, but worldwide neglected I would never want to be
Catch a breeze from these trees
Potent ??? I keep 'em with me
If you really talkin' bout it
Then you can give a 60 to ice and we left from ???
Takin' us everywhere, no lie, off of that 1-6
To cross that footbridge
And if I'm iffy by the talent I got 5, I know, sick

[Verse 17] (Rod Fuego)
I'm a young super immaculate
Rap til I get callouses
C-T, nigga, but I'll be up where an atlas lives
Know the light skin, I'm a rebel to the establishment
A lot of people overlook, 'gon be lookin' up madder shit
Even Mike wasn't first draft, I go hard
Til that cum you feel hurts bad
Ain't no second guessing
I'm making niggas hang theyself, we goin' back to lynching
Seven black cats, my superstition is an instant ???

[Verse 18] (9Gs)
Since commas and triple set, bet my life on it
M-O-T, Matter of Time, til lights on it
Til they bite on it, Big League Chew
Til the team hawks spit, and spends endless nights on it
??? or perfected, ??? ?? ???
??? ??? so ill, we gotta be feared
Bubble like mind clears, subtle but not scared
Smoke blunts and no repairs, it's only wrong if you care

[Verse 19] (Zachg)
Put the top back, uh-huh
Ma you like that?
I could do it to you fancy like a top hat
Come on, tell me lil mama can you top that? Well can you top that?
I give you constant whiplash, rapping like I'm RiFF RAFF
But spit facts uninhibited, with the pimp slaps
Get the spinach and I'm finishing in olive oil
Cookin' on the Bar-B while yall shrimp just boil
Gold leaf on the soil, plush seats like I'm royal
Your bitch grab more dicks than a Manhattan Mohel
Your ho ain't got a pussy that's hotdog in a hallway
You ain't got a dick, that's a hot dog in the hallway
You ain't gotta quit, man I'm eatin' like a Akira this year
I'm tryna hear a sound barrier burst
You can bury the old me in a shoebox in the hearse
Truly liberated, not no Pattie fuckin' Herst
You only heard me right now but been ill since birth
Long jaundice, beat the walls to pieces
Long dong, bitch, smoke in peace, lungs full of hashish
From the bong rips do it to ya
I keep it constant, take your mind out the frame
To some place so cosmic, step up out the pond
Get a taste for water salted
Do the pussy like a pretzel, I'm assault it...white mustard in the condom and I'm gone bitch

[Verse 20] (Lakutis)
Yo it's your boy, Lakutis in the pool
Hanging with Mila Kunis in the pool
She said I'm the cutest in the pool
Then she put it on me like I'm Ja Rule, awww girl
I'm the flyest this side of the Mississippi
And this side is the side that fucks with me
Am I SSI or B-I, get me
All my peoples with me
All the hoes on me, all them all watch me
Ice cold saki, might blow probably
Never see y'all again but I like y'all a lot, B
Just playin', I don't like no one
See me goin' dumb like a shogun
Rap hands glow like Sho Nuff
Ass damn dead I'm so gruff
Y'all bite rhymes, I fight crimes like
Batman, Darkwing, Scruff McGruff
That's wassup

[Verse 21] (Fat Tony)
Fat Tony in this bitch, representin' me myself and I
Got a few friends on this track I wanna tell 'em "Hi"
I'm comin' out of Houston so you know my collar's never dry
Wonder why? Because the high's around 95
And I don't drive, I just ride on niggas I despise
I eat Thai, and walk til I can sit inside
In this environment, I'm wetter than a slip-n-slide
Feeling hotter than the fire felt by Richard Pryor

[Verse 22] (Lofty305)
Lofty, 305
Doin' shrooms, gettin' high
Gettin' by, broke as fuck
Tryna hit a lick for the come-up, wassup bitch
I ain't seen that ass in a while
You're suckin' my dick and I like your style
Hol' up, Lofty305 got a fat blunt, and you can have one
If you can grab one
Nah, not the blunt, bitch, bitch I mean my dick
Lofty305, catchin' nuts on a bitch
I'm bout to run up on them tits, yeah
I got a thing for the bitch, damn
She got a thing for the posh game
I ain't even gotta say my name
Wanna come up on the scene, yeah she know it's me
Lofty305, all with the family
???, what's up my nigga chip
Metro see what we're goin' through this fuckin' year
Take over, with my niggas, damn
Shout out to Raider Klan, yeah we back in this
Fuck a bitch, one mo' gin til the world end
We finna make it spin off its axis
Yeah we back with them hoes cause this is that mack shit
You know how it is, bitch

[Verse 23] (Lowercase)
Cyberpunk, and you a cyber bitch
I'm a cyberpunk, and you're a cyber bitch

Chillin', loungin' in Florida
Smoked out, loc'd out in a Corolla
I look at my phone, another Red Bull
Tryna pick me up from the studio, yo
She said "I got some Xanax and some good weed"
I said I got some good dick, that's what you need, you know
To get by to go to sleep, then I'll still lurk for the midnight creep
I call up Lofty, like "Yo, what's the play with the week?"
Everything doin' good, goin' good with the fam
Holla at ??? like "Y'all stayin' up, y'all on the right track and shit?"
I'm the low letter and I keep Village South together, so I guess you could call me the general
I keep my niggas together and I bring 'em up, and I still don't give a fuck
Bust a nut in a slut, and call it a wrap
I never had a gat, I just got my iron fixed
So if you wanna fuck with VS, get your head bust, nigga, when my iron booms
Fuck your gold grills, I got my calcium filled teeth

[Verse 24] (Himself The Majestic)
Himself the medical, murder mami so tender though
Incredible, forever ho chopper spittin' propeller flow
You met the most sickest, everything is gold glisten
You ain't see like small crickets, barely heard with no lizzip
It's a King, Jerry Lawler on the taping
And I'll be drinking 40 Ounces til I'm fucking eighty
Rap until they pay me, cruisin' with your lady
Surfin' every ocean in the place, I'm feelin' wavy
Please believe, it's an eastside spitta
They gon' need the motherfuckin' Force to come and get us
Elevator lift up, better late than never
Said I made 'em wait, now they see me swervin' in a pick-up
Top of my game like the Game Genie cartridge
Compare art it's, next to nothing
Coming from the city of set trip and dumpin'
Henny and a blunt, we roll thick and function
Nature

[Verse 25] (Shady Blaze)
New year, same hustle, same color reppin'
Cold world, never shiver, block is hot but I'm never sweatin'
Keep growing, I'm smarter than I was last week
Cops arrestin' but it ain't me that's trapped in that back seat
Shady Blaze, all I know is Green Ova
Sorry if I don't recognize you I never am sober
All my niggas on this track is real hustlers, it's time to get it
It feels like my life ain't worth shit unless I spit it
Too many snakes out here, too many rats
Too much cheddar to get, it's a war in my habitat
This isn't average rap, fam givin' love, make sure they have it back
Momma raised me, I ain't care about where my dad was at
Fuckin' up, thinkin' that crime shit was cool and
Gettin' chips, it felt like I was wasting time up in school
So I dipped, look at me, but don't judge a book by its cover
This the future of this rap shit, man, you gotta love it

[Verse 26] (Keyboard Kid)
You gotta respect the hustle, was always a big dreamer
Now a nigga waitin' on that big check, no FEMA
I wanna ball, the game call me to the court, got subpoenaed
They say life is a bitch, not if you get in between her
I put the pipe on her lap, now she a crack addict
Pillowtalk to my dream, gave me a crack at it
Made our own lane, yeah I'm reppin' this bay shit
Took the red pill, got up out of the fake shit
Playin' the role and kneel, get you out of this matrix
Take you and me to Based World, just hop in this spaceship
All these rappers killers when the get on wax
Well I'm a murderer too, shit I'm killing this track
Leveled up quickly, never use a cheat code
Still run point for the city like I'm D-Rose
Fuck all the bullshit, I can smell it miles away
Some of you fake niggas best to stay the fuck out my face

[Verse 27] (Antwon)
Fuck the world, call it calisthenics
Bitch is wildin' out and my dick ain't even in it yet
Pussy good in 2012, reppin' Dipset, that booty thumpin'
Wonder if she popped a pill yet
Block wild to see, they used to not be my peoples
Unil they heard that fantasy best, now they on my peep though
Summertime crack sales, homey hugged the physical
They felt it through they bodies now the book ??? spiritual
That boy did it, here's to you
And all the people's in my life that made it possible
I rob banks, you com-plain
Do something for yourself nigga or else you're gettin' pocket change
Remember me and my nigga used to just get a pizza
Now we good, constantly rollin' weed up haters can't see us
But wanna 3D us, only show the ??? to the girs, yeah, see ya
Wouldn't want to be on my style, weed smoke to the shores of Korea
Or onomatopoeia, whatever nigga

[Verse 28] (Western Tink)
I can't trust nobody, I trust nobody
See every motherfucker tryna be John Gotti
See every motherfucker got his hand on the shotty
And he's scared to death, so he's gon' squeeze probably
Like a happy dude, the minor is shit for major consequence
Trippin' actin' like I got no sense
When the name of the game's to break down defense
Nowadays I see this shit from a new vantage
Used to think like I wasn't gon' see tomorrow, but
Think what if I was to see tomorrow
One day you're standin' on top Mt. Kilamanjaro
The next you're askin' the homies can you borrow a dollar
Somebody close to me put me up that there'd be days like this
Them the moments when these niggas show they true faces
Some of my friends is foes, some of my foes is blessings
So many said to keep it real, but that's just an expression
I keep it, mobbin'...

[Verse 29] (Chippy Nonstop)
Girls, girls, girls, come on stay on your feet
One shoulder, one arm, what can tear us apart
One hand, one foot, nothing tear us apart
This is the end, this is just the start
I can't feel it no more, I can't take it no more
"The world is yours," he always said to me
"The world is yours," nothing left to believe
Nothing led to believe, ay, Chippy

[Outro] (Chippy Nonstop) X2
Bitches is the shit, you niggas ain't shit
Bitches is the shit, cause you niggas ain't shit
Bitches is the shit, you niggas ain't shit
Bitches is the shit, cause you niggas ain't shitYo yo yo yo yo yo yo

If I ever die, remember me like John Legend
If I ever die 'member I had a huge dick
Y’all eat dicks, the opposite of vomiting dicks
I’m better than everybody, I’ma live longer than everybody
Shut up

[Verse 2: Kool A.D.]
New name Day Job, iTunes paint job
You can see me on that yaper caper everyday god
Shirt cost no money (free)
Pants cost no money (free)
Finna fly to Cuba with my sister off that show money
Soul Plane money (yaper), gold chain money (yaper)
Old game running with a cold brain, hug me
Wack hotel party, but I like how the brie taste
Eat a pineapple, cause she like how the seed taste (eww)
She see me, me see she, we great
Three weight, three steaks, real fake liminal
Old zebra spiritual, y’all don’t really want it though
Japanese psychedelic rock band in Monaco

I'm in the coffin
It creaks like Dawson
He speaks like often
He seems like awesome
I'm in the forest
You can find me being flawless
Full moon, ho
Brandy, Mr. Boston
I'm a beast, I'm a dog
You can't see him in the fog
You can't kill him because he's dead
I got bitches on my dick
I'm a death shark, death shark
Scream at me
Walk with me
Sly baby, slide baby
Yay shimmy, ahh shimmy
Shoving every shard of this FernGully VHS
Inside my dick until I see Hexxus
If I had a shirt on, it'd say "free Hexxus"

Wait, wait wait wait wait wait wait
Y'all know about the seven spiders of hip-hop?
Promethalax, Borathazon, Samulus, Zauron, Britetriol
Creep, Jasper, Lytralydon, Zamphexotrorp, Arnarnion

[Hook]
Yo, I'm in the forest
(Chill)

[Verse 2]
Flesh party, flesh party
Only ghost dad at the flesh party
Fast and danger, cast of Frasier
Jewish Keanu
Taste the soup with no spoon, hater
I'm in the loop like fake fruit flavor
Make moves major
Eight blue blazers
Bake roots and play flutes, satyr
They shoot, we slash makeup
Weed slash paper
We stack, cake up (like, like a wedding)
I'm hiding in a laundry
Call me Tom Landry
Call me Paul Anka
Comptroller Carl McCall
Franke till it's sank-a
Swanky at the gala
Jeggings on the treadmill at the Bally's
Fitness
Witness the illest
Sickens the chickens
Like a hawk
Cock of the walk
Top of the notch
God of the Norse
Hang from a noose
Cook like a goose
Move your caboose
Beetlejuice (x5)
Bloody Mary (x4)
Lakutis (x8)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm dead, I'm an alien
My blood got a fang in it
Skull got a jewel
That was wrapped in a rag
It is not what you think
When I scrape off my teeth
I made a pact with India Arie
Ask me if it's blades I eat
Catch me in the cave I sleep
Laughing at the meal I ate
Blood and bones made me
Hold the mic crazy
I don't mean to cuss
But oh, baby
I behold demon money
Lehman Brothers
Kid sisters
Snake mother
Guide your horse to me
Viper skin coochie
Hyper color goofy
I bite watermelon boobies (Yo... what?)
I'm in the house
With the rat with a drill for a face
With the sigil in the splinter in the belly of the beast

[Outro]

[Repeated]
I'm dead

[Repeated]
Death shark
(I'm in the forest)[Hook]

They be like, "You so irresponsible"

[Verse 1: Heems]

The most excellent God vision crystal
Twisted spliff with your twisted sister
No, it ain't my fault, no not me
You couldn't see me like a Jewish Nazi
Das Racist, the number one slept on
You couldn't see us like quarks and leptons
Wholesale Tetley tea bags in the pantry
Brown banshee, boss tried to ban me
Bahn Mi, mommy, hand me a Grammy
A grand for my family, a house for my granny
Cup filled with booze as big as the Stanley
Plus bread, plus cheese, something like a sammy
Dream of knockin' Hima over, leavin' with the hematoma
Rockin till the beat is over, he the holder of a boulder
Eager beaver beat her over, camcorder, Chevy Nova
Schema soldier, deep scolder, dippin when the heat is over

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kool A.D.]

N-n-n-n-nickname Prince Ruffian, animal husband
Anything, something, anything, nothing, nothing, nothing
They shooting, who's ducking? Who's chicken? Who's joking?
Who's juking? Who's jerking? Whose jerk chicken is this?
Can I handle it for a minute?
Who's in this to win this for the spinach?
For the brisket, for the Bisquick, for the biscuits
Make biscuits, take this kiss, break this kiss
Break, break, break, chick, chick, chick
Tick, tick, tick, bang, bang, bang, d-d-d-d-d-dang
D-d-d-d-d-damn, no sleep, no tryptophan
No kick the can, spinnin' like a ceiling fan
Where the feeling man?
Reelin' in the year
Steely Dan, for realie fan

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lakutis]

Girl, shake it like a chicken wing
Eat it like a chicken foot
Chicken what? Chicken butt
Bawk, bawk, chicken, chicken
Bawk, bawk, chicken, chicken
Bawk, bawk, chicken, chicken
Yeah, you fucking with a death shark
Blood eagle, bug eagle
Running 'round the fire circle for
A little, little baby boo boo, all the voodoo that you do
It's so remarkable, plus you can see me in my cyber punk
Cess pool, this cess pool is the best pool
Best kept cool in the test tube
Best dressed fool in the death cube
I come about my Jimmy, karma karma caress you
Come, come my lady I'mma hand you this vegetable
Chiba, Chiba, Buddha, Buddha, Whoda, Whoda
Dodo, dodo, dududasta
Jewish Eddie Murphy in your barber shop, Mazel Tov
Drop it like it's hot

[Hook][Verse 1: Lakutis]
I said "Fuck it", when I'm done with this shit?
I'mma spin the whole world on the tip of my dick
Let out the blood from your wrists
Bitch, you ain't fucking with me, skeleton, skeleton

[Hook]
My Jesus piece is my whole body, ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers
My Jesus piece is my whole body, ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers
My Jesus piece is my whole body, ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Finna wil' out she call out from the bedroom
Titty fall out call out "five second rule"
Beddy bye bitch she love what the dick do
Yup it's official gold in my dental, God in my Brando
Jesus piece is my whole body ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers
My Jesus piece is my whole body ya'll hoes chicken like

[Verse 3: Lakutis]
Look at the fuck have you done
Made a world where the father doesn't know his son
But the drugs let the child know God if he want
Fuck are you lookin' at one, know that you are
See that glow off my body you know I'm a star
Skeleton, skeleton, skeleton, skeleton, skeleton

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Lakutis, Lakutis, Lakutis (x2)

[Verse 4: Lakutis]
Ball so hard make a rock seem soft
Shine like a mothafucka high beams on
Bummy mothafucka made my peace with God
Slide with your baby girl, wild on the mini bar
Fuck what you talkin' bout, bitch, I'm an animal
Ya'll ain't fuckin' with me, skeleton, skeleton
Skeleton, skeleton, skeleton-on, skeleton

[Hook] (x4)[INTRO]
Lakutis, Lakutis, Lakutis…Lakutis, Lakutis, Lakutis…

Yo this is the part where I talk shit, man
Fuck where you're from, fuck your ugly ass boot-cut jeans
Fuck Bronx High School of Science, fuck your long-ass hat
Fuck that fucking bartender at that shit on 18th St. when you tried…

[Hook]
Lakutis in the house, yeah
Lakutis in the house, what what
Lakutis in the house, yeah
Lakutis in the house, oops

[VERSE 1]
Ascot, black socks, my Rothstein is on point
Bloodlet, I am the offspring of Jon Voight
Relax, boit boit…we got a great big convoy, ain't she a beautiful
Spherical cubicle, find mine empty
Sign mine with a single kanji on the suicide, no eye of a goat
Hoof of a jew whale, of a tale, pale, male rapper
Call me Hawk Candy, I'm John Candy, I hock candy

[Hook]

[VERSE 2]
Born in a cyberpunk cesspool, this cesspool is the best pool
Best kept cool in a test tube
Best dressed fool in the death cube
I climb upon my chimney, come-a come-a caress you
Black rose festooned, wear right next to 'em
Can't get next to 'em, that's like death to 'em
Eff that, def that fleshwound, fly so high girls gotta throw sex to 'em

[Hook]

[VERSE 3]
My killdren have drillfaces to adore you
My fishskin leaves creases in the soil
My visage makes villages recoil
I keep 'em in tinfoil in pieces to be boiled
Chilean with miners but I'm major, flyer than a regular piece of paper
Catch me stayin' at 480 Frostsaber
Watchin SNL: peace to Bill Hader
Flow nice like you thought I is, blow spice like I Muad'Dib
Holler, Muad'Dib, Muad'Dib, do it
Muad'Dib, Muad'Dib, do it

[BRIDGE]
Lakutis in the house, yeah
Lakutis did his thing, yeah
Lakutis in the house and lakutis in your mouth
Lakutis did his thing, yeah

[Hook]

[VERSE 4]
Bitches got attack dogs like Sandra Bernhard
Me I straight attack dog, Sandra Bernhard
Me I make word art, mira mira, ven aqui
Mirror, mirror on the wall…water, water everywhere
Awesome bein' crazy, call me kike carbonyl
Grease the wheel, Armor All, beat police, armor all
Wolfed out Thumbelina shit, drinkin' Aquafina shit
Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick

[Hook][Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
All I want is a house and some money to travel
A simple game putting letters together like Scrabble
Sisyphus's lesson crushing the rock into gravel
Which of us truly trust how they knocking the gavel?
Plus though I be floating around like I'm stocking the ammo
Tucking the Glock in the camo
Fuck it, I'm lost in the channels
Surfing on surfaces, cursing in cursive and shit
Hurdling hurdles and hares
And turtles aware of the circles and squares
To a certain degree
A person you certainly see
Is certainly, certainly me
Or whatever, Kool A.D.,
Till they pulling the curtain on me
I'm Erick Sermon, the generic version
Virtually not, but I'm Parrish too
Shut the fuck up, I'll embarrass you
Nah, don't care, I'm so careless my dude
Yes I'm aware I'm a fool
Sexy and arrogant too
Son and the heir to nothing in any apparent view
Thought I told you like once or twice you should stare into my raps like Pun once dared us to
And we did
Who do we kid?
Why do we do what we did when we did?
Ooh baby ooh baby shit

Groovy
You feel me?
Sit back, cold beverage, writing leverage

[Lakutis]

Groovy
You feel me?
Sit back, cold beverage, writing leverage

[Verse 2: Fat Tony]
You know me, I don’t need no introduction and shit
Girl screaming “Anthony Obi, hold me!”
Like she know me, she won’t quit
Already got one holding my arm in this
But I think I’m bout to add two to the list
And I just might add you if you equipped
With some good sense, and some good teeth
And feeling free like a loose leaf, single sheet
On the beat I’m crisp like a Pringle be
I’m on 34th Street like Kris Kringle be
Just little old merry me, unmerrily
Calling up my agent, flagrant
Nigga got me sleeping on the pavement
Why the fuck you think I made this wavelength?
Ain’t tryna live in my relative’s basement
It ain’t easy being meezy, when a measly
Hundred dollars lost can make a nigga queasy
I need my full fucking feezy
Ever since I got grown, left home
Been feeling all alone like fish a la carte, bitch this is the start
Of me being a meanie to you niggas seeming teeny
You stringy like some linguini, thinking that you can see me
That seemingly might be easy but you’re quite beneath me
You’re stinky like a queef be
From a bitch that hasn’t washed for weeks
Hoes known to jock you geeks
Cause they think you so unique
But solely you’re phony and only phoning in when you speak
I’m going in on your freak, weekly and reeking of weed
Sweetly I’m sealing the deed, revealing just what she need
Like honey to bees or chickens to feed
Or money to me or A/C to a hundred degrees
I smoke nothing but trees, you are nothing to me
And while you’re living in dreams I’m reeling in reality

[Verse 3: Nasty Nigel]
59 pounds on the Eurostar in France
Business Class feature Sauvignon in the glass
I don’t know French Lucy teach it when she speak
I study in the bed and I only learned “Oui!"
Swimmies in the duffle cause I’m tryna hit the beach
And I’m tired of the Rockaways, too ugly for my feet
No room for devices, leave it at the beep
The only thing magnetic is the hotel key
So baby don’t tell me that we living next week
Cause I’m feeling this week, life is feeling this sweet
What type of feeling this be? what kind of strain is this weed?
I know you understand me since we’re on the same beat
You can hear the foreign silence ringin as I pen this verse
Moleskine with the Star Wars cover, Peroni quench the thirst
I ain’t about shit cause I recycle my outfits
Dawg, I’m walking on the outskirts of a country unknown
5 Euros a six-pack; Victor is you with that?
My eyes rolled to the top, drop while I sit back
World’s Fair globe trotter popping on a greater scale
In the end might leave it all, that’s word to Christian Bale (Spoiler)
