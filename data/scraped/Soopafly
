(Chorus)
Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

[Nate Dogg]
But I'm alone in my room
And I dont have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

(Chorus) x2
Me and my homies though
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

[2 Pac]
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us parted
Keep it close to my heart
Cuz we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snithces
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police takin our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my muthafuckin homeboys down to die
For each other, cuz we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgettin the party poppin
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop actin phony
Dont forget tto bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, duckin bullets
Snatchin guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fuckin homies
Me and my fuckin homies

(Chorus)
Me and my homies though
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies
Kick it like everyday

(Me and my homies)
Constantly we mash
(Me and my homies)
Gotta make that cash
(Me and my homies)
There's no need to ask
(Me and my homies)
We are still the best

(Breakdown) x8
(thats my homeys)
Thats my homeys
DPGC homeys

(Chorus)
Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday(*whispered* Sexy, sexy) - x4

[Nate Dogg]
Me and my niggas we roll
Like each and every day
Keep my heat beneath my seat
Cos other niggas don't play
Me and my niggas we ride
Cos we know no other way
One deep breath before I step
And now it's time to play
Now tell me who is that girl
See her standin 'cross the way
Watch me mack with eye contact
Watch her become my slave
Baby girl it's me
Yeah that crazy nigga Nate
I want that so don't talk back
Let's just be on our way

	[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
	You make me go crazy baby
	When I see a sexy girl
	I really go crazy baby
	When I see a sexy girl

	You make me go crazy baby
	When I see a sexy girl
	You make me go crazy baby
	When I see a sexy girl

[Big Syke]
Say suga you look like a winner
Let's have dinner tonight
Escape your troubles and take a flight over night
To the land of the hot and the sticky
I know it's sticky but the best part's the mystery
And leave the misery behind put this dick on your mind
Extra freaky it ain't worth my time
I gotta get mine, I'll make sure you get yours
Body doin things you never did before
Have you beggin for more
Body all over the place
Can't wait to see the expression that's on your face
When you cum, are you cummin? Are you c-cummin?
And I'ma ask you is it runnin, baby?
You ain't never had the shit til you got dug by a thug
And fucked doggy style on a bear skin rug
Up and down stairs in the back of a limo
On Interstate 5 on the way to San Francisco

	[Chorus]

You make me, hmm
You make me go
*repeat over bridge and chorus to fade*

[Bridge - Nate Dogg]
I'm havin a ball
Watch out for I fall
I'm headed for the girl that's standin on the wall
No flashin no bills
Just testin my skills
I'm lookin for a sexy girl so we can peel

	[Chorus - repeat to fade][Intro]

[Daz overlapping "V"]
Rollin' down Crenshaw Boulevard
Starin' at these suckers who claim to be hard
Daz Dillinger and Tha Gang
Who can blast and gangbang, hahaa

[Verse 1: Daz]
Who gives it up for every hooker, rat and hood slut
All in the cut Dat Nigga Daz with the pimp strut
You slept game on those who act lame
See, ain't a damn thang changed
You know I ride the neighborhood slow
Floss on you and let the weed blow
True indeed I'm havin' a ball
Pick up the phone and give my homies a call
What's up with y'all? (What's up y'all?)
Livin' in the city where we born to ball
Rolled up a Philly, we pack it tight
What a pity, what a sight
And hella chronic all damn night
Got the weed, it got me kinda feelin' so high
Hennessy got a brother so feelin' so high
Pull outta state, enjoy my day and I love to burn rubber
Pump up the jam for the summer
Gimme eureka, Snoop got the Hummer
Kinda make you wanna sit back and wonder

[Hook: Lady "V"]
[In California, in California]
The home of the city of the Crips and the Bloods

[In Californ-i-a, Californ-i-a]
Or you can get got for who they thought you was

[Verse 2: Daz]
Ooh damn, back by a popular demand
Daz Dillinger back in effect, homie, once again
The question is why y'all got a problem with me gettin' high
Say the wrong thing, get right
Prepare in effect, homies are prepared everywhere
Causin' ruckus, all bein' fair
Daz Dillinger finally alone in my zone
Be by myself in a place that I call home
Check it out, peep out the scenery
Ya meanin' to me nuthin' to me, ya keep frontin' to me
I hit you up Dogg Pound all come around
Lay 'em all down homies be frontin' for they town
Throw it up, east side, west side bumpin'
California's the state where we be dumpin', what

Once that you visit see all the places
You may never wanna leave]

[Verse 3: Daz]
Here I am stompin' down choppin' down yo compound
Knockin' all y'all out thirty seconds in the first round
Who come around get destroyed off contact
Realize and understand homie you don't want that
Check it out, let's engage in military actin'
Women, dope and drama keep me yackin'
Bump all that bullsh(it) you yappin'
Them beats and that bullsh you yappin'
I'm about all busy boggin' and cappin'
Pistol packin' you don't really want none of this action
Homie, you better watch out, cause nothin' can save ya
Tattooein' y'all with razors
Blazen that it didn't penetrate him but I grazed him
Now they callin' Daz unusual playa hater
Back on the spot, feelin' high
Watchin' as the cops pass by
Smokin' fire homie I ain't lyin'
Who the man from Long Beach, California to Japan
Rockin' like Run DMC, homie, without a band in hand
A why can't control the whole scene
Watch it unfold, get scold, get blown away
Any other rapper pay dearly, severely, y'all come and hear me
Damn, you get bruised, battered and slammed
Niggas try to see who I am, Dat Nigga Daz

Yeah, what's up baby girl?
I'm just looking over this homework
I really need some help
You wanna study with me?
That'd be nice, yeah

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Honeydew, money do
But this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh
Take it from me, first day of school I'm looking cool, I got my clothes pressed
I'm a senior but I'm seeming like an old vet
Time will pass me by if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind
Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it
Look at you girl, you got me dedicated

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, put me on the game
Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame
Usually kinda square, I'm trying new shit for a change
Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gone need a lot of brains
And just cause I don't play, who say I can't ball?
My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on
Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Devin there you are, look at my repertoire
Spitting game, you know for reppin hard
Change that perspective, that's my objective
Cool and oh so collective, connected
Check this, I need you more that you could know
See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
Let it go, let me know where to meet at
Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that

[Hook]

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that

Gangsta shit, tell a bitch to stick a dick in her mouth

[Daz Dillinger]
As I skip to my loo, C-Walkin', G talkin'
I'm a gangsta, cold hearted, sick, dumb and retarted
Came up this far without a bullet proof vest (yeah)
Ran with the best, sport khaki's again
Always stay fresh won't settle for less
Looped out, satined out -

[Soopafly]
Man these niggas on deck
Now it's the pimp of the crew, Soopafly comin' through

The D.P. locced out, niggas get choked out
Smoked out niggas that'll fuck you up no doubt

[Tray Deee]
Gangsta gangsta, tell me how you do it

I have so much beef I shoulda fucked up my colon
But I sent 'em off deprived, with both they fuckin' eyes swollen
Everything stolen and it's still rich rollin'
Niggas can't see me cause I kill shit blowin'
I let loose like ain't no tomorrow with bomb beats
A-K-47 street, quick to get ya
My lyrics like missiles to hit Hitler
Motherfucker stay up out my Kool-Aid pitcher
You don't wanna see my style like click-click pow
Make you bow to my wicked style, make you my child
The enemy wanna diss, nigga but how could he?
We hookers and hoodies, with a bag full of goodies, what!?
Now take that for what it's worth
I'll terrorize your territory and take over your turf
All these niggas is rob, but they was soft as a Nerf
Nasty as after birth, they say "ooh" after the verse

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm commercial, universal with no rehearsal
And when I'm in the hood I'm just so controversial
Niggas know me homie - the O.G
West Coast Don, I'll smash on anyone
On my daughter and my two sons, the set and my two guns
I move the dubs and let D move the 2-1's
Not to mention all my No Limit niggas now
We do it G style like Big C-Style

So to kick a style, you gotta kick me down
Every nigga from the Pound gettin' paid now
Hey now, big bow wow honey child
I ran a hundred miles through about a hundred styles
And now I'm through with it, with nothin' else to do with it
Roll it, blaze it, pass it, now you hit it
We's a D.P.G. committee

[Kurupt]
Snoop fuck that bitch
Dat Nigga Daz fuck that bitch, that trick, that goofy ass bitch
Soopafly, super high, ruff cap slip, fuckin' gangsta shit

It's a gang thang, we all gang bang

[Daz Dillinger]
Hold up (Wait a minute!)
All my niggas get (Gangsta with it!)
Tick-tock (Crip Walk!)
And prepare to get ill when the gangstas talk
Saggin' and flaggin' with the '7-trey draggin'
Smokin' like a dragon with the .4-4 cannon
Be the last man standin' whoopin' niggas at random
Gray and Blue bandanna's, hoo-ridin' is standard
So what y'all wanna say? (Huh, huh?)
What y'all wanna do? (Huh, huh?)

[Butch Cassidy]
You niggas trippin', while I'm steady dippin'
Throw your clip in, since y'all all flippin'
Rollin' capers, while I'm gettin' papers
Tried to shake us, you know they caught the vapors
Everyone around is soon to see
Ain't nobody comin' close to me
Keep hangin' 'round and you'll believe

Only in California (California)

Ice Cube the mutherfuckin don
Snoop Doggy Dogg a.k.a. Tha Doggfather
Mack 10 alias the Chicken Hawk
Gangstas with rules
Cause youse the niggas with no rules
Ain't got nothing to lose, we got everything to lose

Threw his ass in, he feel the fin of the baracuda
I negotiate Mack is the shooter
You the nigga on the journey strapped to this gurney
We break breads with accountants and attorneys
Currency never worry me (never)
Who's got the balls to murder me
Degree higher than a 33
Tell em what you drank (Hennessy)
Never tell em what you thinkin
Never tell em where the body stankin
Fuck Lincoln, fuck Jackson, bankin Franklin what you thankin
Hope your man come with the ransom
Let me see you dance on, no longer handsome
If you don't drop off than walk off, watch him, watch him

Chorus

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Them westcoast niggas is real set trippas (Westside)
Will get you for them zippas, on a quest for them chippas (Eastside)
Slidin while we ridin, not even hittin switches
Hangin at the high school gettin at them young bitches (what)
I got the dove sacks, homies love that (who got the bud)
Where the bud at, hollering at my big homeboy who fresh out
Hangin at my grandmama house, homie burnt out
What you gonna do when you get out of jail (speak on it)
I'm gonna have some fun (Doggy Dogg)
What do you consider fun a ounce and about five hun
So I put him on a move that I know about
Hooked him with a homegirl from the South (good lookin out)
Money made, plug a playa in the game
Especially when he represent the same thing I claim
Damn they don't make niggas like they used to
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce deuce (that's real)
Cause everybody wanna be a star
In the city of dope, a.k.a. caviar

Chorus

[Mack 10]
What have we a house full of cavi (no stress)
Well known ridas from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes lickin up so hard we stickin up niggas
Tired of the bullshit so we clique'n up (Westside)
Nigga please we ain't trippin off C's and B's
It's the Westside Connect with the DPG's
For the cheese we jab with the gift of the gab
Always clappin (yeah), Mack, Cube and Snoop rappin
Now how did that happen it's all good (fool)
So peep game If you could
Snoop be from Long Beach and I be from Inglewood (yeah)
Now you despise cause it came to yo surprise (what)
Two well known enemies now becoming allies (damn)
In Californ-I-A we parlay the G way
Some wear red and black and some sport blue and grey
So gangsta's don't dance we hang boogie and bang
So it's the Westside Connect with the Dogg Pound Gang

Chorus

[Ice Cube]
There we have it, Ice motherfuckin Cube

Homey: Ay Dogg, let me holla at'cha man
Snoop: Wuz up home?
Homey: Word is on the streets, your beats gone be delicate

Man, I don't give a fuck about no beat

(Now let me shake that shit man)
(I hear ya Dogg)
(It's a cold, cold thing!)
(It's a cold thing!)
(For real, hmm!)

[Snoop Dogg]
I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes
Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes
What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny
Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first
Cos I done been bombed on before and I'mma tell you, man, that's the worst
Fifth in the world, but I'mma keep my thang together
Cos I'mma keep makin money and hope everything is still together
Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?
All y'all broke on the corner
Drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I'm doin
But don't get mad and don't be tryin to play-hate
Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state
Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent
But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents
I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin
Makin more moves than the average Cuban
Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend
Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac
It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight
Cos I'mma do mines and I'mma keep everything tight
I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught
And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby boy and all
But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right
Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player
You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man
Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you

[Interlude]
One of every five black males before the year 2000
Will be detained or deceased
No justice, no peace
Yeah the truth hurts, if you're scared, go to church

Look here, but don't cut it, gettin five points
Step back for a second, I'm puttin less than five to this joint
Hmm, if this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics
Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin
I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches
Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders
I put it down wit me and make a hit maker, y'knowhatI'msayin?
I love the Lakers now cos now they got Shaq O'Neal
It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real
See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nuttin but Dogg Pound
Guaranteed to put it down and we'll be 'round to your town
So just sit in your seats and wait 'til we come through
Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep
Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG
All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP
Now, what we look like?
Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right
I should get upset but I'mma stay composed
Chill for a second, spit at some hoes
Drinkin my drink, smokin my dank
Countin my bank, uhh that shit stank
Stanky bank is what I got cos I'mma keep it
And nah this ain't no motherfuckin secret

Interlude: (Snoop talking)

Yeah, we're in drought season
Niggas lookin for a reason
It's like thanksgiving without the feast
Yeah the truth hurts, we're scared to go to church

They got me runnin from my life, I'm jumpin gates
They got dogs on my ass, but I'm a Dogg
So I know how to alert and get wit dat shit
The dog run up on me I give him a cold
Like nigga back up off me
He turn around and bite the police, hmm
Game recognise Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm on my toes
I slide in the back of a garage, dippin with this ho
They run right past me, ask me "Have I seen the suspect?"
"Yeah, he went that way", now for the jack(Chorus) x2

[Tripp Locc]
Just came up and now its back to the homefront
The niggas that I'm with decide to take a short cut
But that ain't me, bombed in and I'm trippin
Gimme my half comrades and I seek dippin
Cool, stay up is what I say as I slam the door
Its mobbin time make sure I tuck the fo-fo
Hope to stroll dont take longer than expected
Being on these snake ass streets it can get hectic
See some hoes makin that green
Jacked by the dope fiends doin bad with they eyes on beam
Prolly gonna do some devilish deeds for the next hit
24 hours for them they gotta stay lit
Bust a left through the alley stayin off the main street
Quiet as hell that I can hear my heartbeat

(Chorus) x2
4 Eyes 2 heads
Which one could it be
Its like this your mistaken I didn't do

[Wayniac]
Here comes a darkness now the clouds roll in, so why
Am I paranoid maybe because I'm too high
I'm seein shit, thinkin shit like in a vision
But can't pinpoint the real evil am I gettin
Close got the on post up, hold up
For them hookers that be lookin like toe up from the floor up
For rockin definites amounts to cock
But still it dont change the reason why they wanna plot, but got the knot
I make ya do what ya wanna do
When ya wanna do unto others, as others do unto you
Is it a sin or a shame, who is to blame
No one should ever have to feel the strain on the brain
Mo pain and grief, do I retreat to a deep sleep
Or listen to the voice as it speaks

(Chorus) x2

[Tripp Locc]
Almost out the alley headlights hit my face
Fuck its the po po got the strap so I'm break
Hit the gate, be smart and do no stupid shit
Thinkin like a G!! in this predicament
I'm bonin across PCH and I'm safe
The cut by the wall is open ghetto version late
Another day, another time perhaps
But for now, I gotta be free to make my snaps
Whole lot of traps to dodge when you're broke and when you're large
Keepin it real the Black Panther charge
I never let em hold me back
Wassup cool cat (wassup mane) I see my homey give him dap
And tell him what fun I had with the one times
Plus my mission, he's mad cuz he missed it
Ain't no thang it was a job and adventure
Coulda got twisted tonight but I got wit ya

(Chorus) x7[Verse 1: Crooked I]
And she don't even know the business
Here I go again man cheating on my mistress
And she don't even know the business
Here I go again man cheating on my mistress
And she don't even know the business
Here I go again man cheating on my mistress
My team go beta, resource cost secrets
Kind of ironic I'm here on some creep shit
Freak shit, Chardonnay and a back brown
Knocking it down romantic G shit
We don't even smoke both got the leaflet
The few on the balcony is sea sick
She said her body is my property
So the both pair pink lips
I got the pink slip
But these lips are sealed
Cause I do know I sink ships
As I drink sips
Oh the pizza arrived, sitting on the rocks
Different kind of ice sitting on the watch
Licking on her box like the well payed killer
Pussy assassinated by a self made nigga

[Hook: Kobe]
Body like a porn star
In a head game killer, killer, killer, killer, killer
Somebody must've taught you well
Shorty sure is a keeper
I ain't never gonna trip on who you see
Just make sure you bust it down for me

[Verse 2: Soopafly]
See you don't even know what the time is
Girl you go again nosy, sinus
Yea bitches gon' be on me promise
I never love 'em always fuck a bitch highness
But never this talking
I'm rough but it's not
When it's time to get to lovin'
Deepen that muffin, blue berry kush
Got enough bottom weed for the whole month
My bitch still in fly as nothing
Craving so much ice and gold
When I pipe it slow
I'm like king Minos fucking
Baby lookin' like time well
Spend on top of this bad ass 9 inch dick
The future of flying sick
Lavish like a bow tie event
Grab this microphone while we drift off
Into a dimension of a life we missed
Bullet twice be a bliss

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
And she don't know what going on
Wife here all alone while I'm getting my mogul on
Pick up the wine crackers in the cove alone
Driving a car with a house calling it my mobile home
Top floor the rich my bitch there waiting
Voices in my head I hear a pimp narrating my life
You wanna know the way I truly do it then
Put a max jewely in movie in beauty and the beast
Juicy ass, booty in the Louie V panties
I remove 'em then I stick the bazooka in
She started out Nubian as Estelle
'Til I fuck her pearl as Adele
She bent over hands on the rail
Cause she lost the coin toss
She called heads I called tail
On my way home, I'm smelling like my new chick
Wife be there horny, she got me working two shifts

[Hook]×2[Soopafly]
Now I can't recall ever losin' y'all
No sweat, no disrespect (I ain't trippin')
But I didn't know we was pickin' and choosin' y'all
So look back out for them West Coast niggas
The come and toast niggas, revive back and fly flat
We fly, we high off contact
(Eastside representer), Soopafly with bomb raps
West Coast, hit 'em up, we all that
Yeah we trip, they fall back
But - we cool like the wind yo'
But don't sabotage the life we lead
We gangsta ass niggas, but we could still be friends though
Now here, have some drink, smoke my weed
It's the bomb, I hit it with y'all
Do your thang, ain't no foul no harm
A nigga need a hand, I lend him my arm
(You know) we not that bad homie
We like to party hard, do our thang too
Whips and chains too
It's all lingo, real niggas connected closer than a seam yo
No matter where you're from we should all be havin' some
We all gon' stay fight, we all gon' run
The game - it's a shame niggas think I want the fame
Nah nah, I could give a damn - just know my name
But now as far as comin' out, yeah we to blame
But now we here motherfuckers, treat us the same

[Hook]
They act like they just don't hear us
Cause they know we just don't play
But don't be afraid, don't fear us
It's alright, it's okay
Don't be so down, just cheer up
Say what you want to say
Eastside Long Beach can feel us
Welcome back to L.A

[Daz Dillinger]
Who am I, it's the D-A-Z
Give it to you funky fresh, so lovely
Xzibit, Soopafly, Alkaholiks, D.P
West Coast MC's most definitely
(I don't like that shit)
When you see me in the crowd, high
Talkin' loud and actin' wild - it's just my style
You feelin' this, labeled as a menace and gang affiliate
600 Benz, Lorenzos, homie we wheelin' it
I make the party people say "ho", I kick flow
Rock shows, be on flows like the wind blow
Skate out and burn rubber, and leave clouds of indo smoke
Like R.A.W. I ain't no joke
Don't fold up but choke up, don't provoke us loc
From Coast to Coast, who rock the most? (Dogg Pound!)
If I'm banned from your FM dial, I say "fuck it"
Have a joint and a smile - I'm still on the prowl
Be on the underground, I drop sounds that profound and out of bounds
Capture your audience, flow rhythmly like an accordion
Or tell me, are we in a world full of bitch ass niggas and girls?
On the crossfade, I made and learned trades to get paid
You might get slayed and crave what I made
Drop it at the 1, 2, 3 -

[Xzibit]
X to the Z rockin' with the D.P.G

(L.A.-L.A.-L.A.-L-L-L.A.-L.A.)

[Xzibit]
Look, now tell me what's stoppin' you from hangin' around
Stuck in your hotel room whenever you come in to town
I see niggas perpetratin' like they lovin' L.A
But it ain't showin' in they video and radio play
See everyday I got to deal with this industry shit
A bunch of so call heavyweights that's scared to get hit
Prepare to get lit, with the best choke you ever smoked
And politics separate chips, we all can get rich
Release all bitch tendencies, we on the same team or we enemies
And I ain't got too many of them
A lot of hand guns and homies, I got plenty of them
I just make one phone call, you'll get riddled with ten
And that's for only when you try to get slick, and try to cross me
For now let's talk promotion over croissants and coffee
Look - I'm from the place that taught the world how to gang bang
Now I'm finna take it to the top of the food chain

[Hook] - X 2
They act like they just don't hear us
Cause they know we just don't play
But don't be afraid, don't fear us

[Verse]
I came to your house
Your girl came in and started cussin' you out
You shoulda slapped her in her face
I wanted to tell you, but it wasn't my place
I kept on the low
Cause I knew that you was gonna check that ho
But you were quiet as a mouse
Made me start to think that it wasn't your house
Cause she was acting like a nut
You got the kind of bitch that will kick your butt
What kind of pimp holds back
Never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap
What's wrong with the pimpin'
Why you gettin' a whippin'
All I see is simpetttes

[Hook]
Can you control yo ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo ho

[Hook]
This is what you made me do
I really didn't wanna put hands on you
But, bitch you playing with fi-ire
I'm so sick and ti-ired
Of loud mouth bitches like you
A nigga had to go and put tips on you
Cause bitch you playing with fi-ire
I'm so sick and ti-ired

This is what you forced me to do
I really didn't wanna put hands on you
But, bitch you playing with fi-ire

Of loud mouth bitches like you
So a nigga had to go and put tips on you
Bitch you playing with fi-ire

It's like twice that, my niggas fell to semm they like that
Fuck rap, fuck a around and you get snatched

Nigga look at me and my doggz

[Hook]

[Bad Azz]
I floss my gold chain, with diamonds

Don't test touch my fast hand draw
If my strap is in the car, I'm going bomb to the shore
We the number one supporters, drugs, gang love
Smoke the weed, throwing up gang signs, we gangstas
Got to love, got to thugged it up for our mouth
I be on this every single day, no doubt
See me, I'm worth about 450 and ounce
I drop sixteen bars, and go buy me a car
I'm just an local universal with my vocal
Put the hip hop fan base in a choke hold
My gang Dogg Pound, a gang of gangstas and entertainers
Sign an autograph, bangin, and we rich and we famous

[Hook] - repeat to fadeIntro: (Snoop talking with homey)

Homey: Ay Dogg, let me holla at'cha man
Snoop: Wuz up home?
Homey: Word is on the streets, your beats gone be delicate
Since Dre did shake the spea's out, man
Snoop: Delicate? Beats?
So that's what makes me now?
Man, I don't give a fuck about no beat

(Now let me shake that shit man)
(I hear ya Dogg)
(It's a cold, cold thing!)
(It's a cold thing!)
(For real, hmm!)

[Snoop Dogg]
I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes
Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes
What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny
Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first
Cos I done been bombed on before and I'mma tell you, man, that's the worst
Fifth in the world, but I'mma keep my thang together
Cos I'mma keep makin money and hope everything is still together
Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?
All y'all broke on the corner
Drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I'm doin
But don't get mad and don't be tryin to play-hate
Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state
Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent
But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents
I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin
Makin more moves than the average Cuban
Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend
Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac
It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight
Cos I'mma do mines and I'mma keep everything tight
I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught
And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby boy and all
But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right
Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player
You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man
Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you

[Interlude]
One of every five black males before the year 2000
Will be detained or deceased
No justice, no peace
Yeah the truth hurts, if you're scared, go to church

Look here, but don't cut it, gettin five points
Step back for a second, I'm puttin less than five to this joint
Hmm, if this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics
Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin
I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches
Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders
I put it down wit me and make a hit maker, y'knowhatI'msayin?
I love the Lakers now cos now they got Shaq O'Neal
It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real
See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nuttin but Dogg Pound
Guaranteed to put it down and we'll be 'round to your town
So just sit in your seats and wait 'til we come through
Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep
Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG
All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP
Now, what we look like?
Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right
I should get upset but I'mma stay composed
Chill for a second, spit at some hoes
Drinkin my drink, smokin my dank
Countin my bank, uhh that shit stank
Stanky bank is what I got cos I'mma keep it
And nah this ain't no motherfuckin secret

Interlude: (Snoop talking)

Yeah, we're in drought season
Niggas lookin for a reason
It's like thanksgiving without the feast
Yeah the truth hurts, we're scared to go to church

They got me runnin from my life, I'm jumpin gates
They got dogs on my ass, but I'm a Dogg
So I know how to alert and get wit dat shit
The dog run up on me I give him a cold
Like nigga back up off me
He turn around and bite the police, hmm
Game recognise Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm on my toes
I slide in the back of a garage, dippin with this ho
They run right past me, ask me "Have I seen the suspect?"
"Yeah, he went that way", now for the jack[Xzibit talkin]
Listen to this, I'm just tryna do this for us
You know what I'm sayin, you scream at the top of your fucking lungs
Yeah, I'm just tryna do this hard work and get this good between us baby, yeah

Look, Samantha, Loraine, Monica, Veronica
Veronica, she treated my dick like a harmonica
How you think I learned how to twist it and turn
Ya back until it's broke, make you feel it in your throat
It was Pamela, Linda, Keisha, Nicole
Had me fuckin while I was drivin on cruise control
Can't wait to get it home and teach it all to you
Look I'm just tryna be the best, I'm doin it all for you
You know that thing with the peanut butter
My Brooklyn bitch said fuck untyin the ropes
It's faster with a box cutter
I know you love the way I'm diggin you out
But always wanna fuckin aruge so let's figure this out
I'm just tryna make you happy bitch
Who's there for you anytime you get in the mood for suckin a dick
I took the time out to find out what ya like
You bust fifteen nuts, wanna get up and fight
So look

[Hook]
You should thank of all the bitches that I have in my life
All the experience I'm gettin got me fuckin you right
Never took time to see it and plus
All you thinkin 'bout is yourself, I'm thinkin for us
You love the way I beat it down when I come in the house
And all in ya mouth, the bedroom, kitchen and couch
You should thank all of the bitches that I have in my life
All the experience I'm gettin got me fuckin you right

It was Gina, Julie, Renee, Ty and Tammy
Made me spend some extra days in Miami
Candy, Trisha, Prescilla, Melissa
Showed X to the Z it's better with three
Who could fuck your ass better than me (pssst)
I think not, hard knock the cock, welcome to my sweat shop
I pick locks made by NFL, NBA, NHL, fuck all day
You could say I didn't do this shit
Unsatisfied bitches gotta go out and chase the dick
And that's just not the thing to do
So I learn new shit from the next bitch and teach it to you
Now don't you love it how I shove it baby (hell yeah)
When we be fuckin and we thuggin baby (hell yeah)
The way I hit it when I pump it baby (hell yeah)
And don't I spit it when I bust it baby (hell yeah)

[Hook]

I insist that we fuckin on videotape
Just incase a bitch lose face and try and call rape
If you know somethin that might excite up our late night
Got an open invite to lay us a pipe
Make ya head feel like your wet, warm and tight
I'll go from all night 'til the sun turn bright
Two wrongs don't make it right bitch, no need to cheat
(Pussy just a piece of meat, another means to eat)
Big Tray D told me that, as a matter of fact
You only tell me that you love me when you're flat on your back
You wanna leave me now bitch, my fuckin feelings is hurt
Why am I the only one that's tryna make this work

[Hook]
[Tray D talking to fade][Daz Dillinger]

But this is for the niggas who was down from day one

Love to hear, love to hear you motherfuckers
I advise all you ghetto livin', struggling from day to day
Tryin' to flip a figure dollar devil up inside a bag of weed

(Eastside)

Verse One: [Kurupt Tha Kingpin]
I'm coming through your zone late night, shit
Dogg Pound Gangsta to flame the light shit
Cause I hold on
I'm 20 feet tall
The biggest walkin' bill fuck around to get killed
Get shoot
Don't try to sneak a peak in my book
(?Home at hose?) , overdose the thoughts when he look
The forbidden
The hittin' zone that I'm hitting
Don't play with my intelligence nigga as the heat (?slittin'?)
(?)
So I only got two choices; loc me the blasin' bomb
Vietnam
I bring the pain rains no (?)
Execution style is the shells from the heat veal
Down to the ground like the rest of the dummies
Just what the fuck you thinkin' try to play with my money
It's nothing but the Dogg Pound Gangstas
Mashes, verbal disasters, 38 stashes

Verse Two: [Tray Deee]
I arise in disguise to surprise that ass
What you thought you caught me short
I might ride to blast
With the canna
We let the shit all up in your nuts
When niggas droppin', they stop with the plan they plots
Got to stop for my gate
With (?) of break
Marked niggas caught in, they try to win and get sprayed
Rip the gates
Go flip the page to chapter three
First groove, they fools can't come after me
I mash to free
Styles of catastrophe
Ask for G
A nigga best to answer me
My rip long as the beach that I represent
Dead nigga with my stare not to step to this

Verse Three: [Daz Dillinger]
Now o yeah Tray Deee
I mean I see the whole plot
Be on alert, niggas shot
Anywhere under that nigga caught
So drop the microphone on my own
I shown to blown
Away for these MC's with the sludge of a chrome
I take the fang
Down on my own lyrical name
When the sees are changed
When the storms and hurricanes
Wide strand
Spittin' rhymes, the beats so precise
(?)
Skatin' on mics like ice
Twice in the day
I get drunk
(?) of plastic bags
Sack in the truck
Because the rhyme as claim
I shit buck like the doctor
Coming through
Bouncin' with the droptop
Like gangstas chillin on the block
Nah, we ain't worry for shit
Got escape doors like Capone
Whit chick your dick on my clip
Forty-fives and nives
Three-eighties and automatics
Sniveling, coming through for you
When your boys with some stats
I got to have eleven to thrill of the drama
Enthusing me to gets my norm with the slaughter
Ought to be known as Daz Dillinger
For the shit that I known for
A Dogg Pound criminal

Verse Four: [Soopafly]
Now if the spot's hot
I hit the switch make the topdrop
Don't stop
It's Soopafly with the sho shot
Won't stop
I got ya whole shit to
Look and listen
I rendition the rhymes with precision
You can't face
Amaze me a place like a saddle
It's Dogg Pound Ganstas (?) like a shadow
I never met a motherfucker who can make you stick
I never met a motherfucker who can feel my clique
You serve, you'll make the twitch like a nerve
You'll try to step to my wild style seperve
Adjective the verve
Action pack with the words
I'll make it stop
The jaws drop and observe
I sold the block for Crook, Daz, Style and Tray Deee
We be coming with the shit
That be the bomb baby
And ain't a Dogg Pound Gangsta will knock you to the flow
Either you stupid as fuck or just don't know

Verse Five: [Bad A$$]
Now I know you, know you
Stupid as fuck
Cock, bust like a sawed off punk
Double barrel on 'em
Black gambinos at casinos
Get De Niro on 'em
If I want 'em
I go get 'em
If I gotta shot a nine
Twice, that's what I rhyme like
My clip ain't empty
Do try to test the ridah
Nativity simply
Bust, I lead inside ya
Find ya
Fear them, frightened for your life
With your last few
Live with hot live from gunblast
Outlaws, outcast
Low life, south last
Long Beach niggas blast
Yeah the b-side is right
The most, the coast
The west, the best
We damn bitches
Sippin', hittin' switches
Dippin' hittin' robbin' niggas
Itchy fingers on triggers
Itty, bitty niggas
Ready for war
We kick down your door
Draw eatin'
Lay everybody down on the floor

Verse Six: [Technique]
The same thing, different place
With snakes, cowards and strong grown
Robbery cases, niggas faces
On paperchase
It was seen, it was written
It ain't forbidden
For homies to be splittin'
Disagree, no one was hitten
Known with the curls
The many obstacles
Impressions to the feet from gettin' served
Growing up is rough
Your name
Here's the streets it gets tough
You can be scuffed and stuffed
Then I guess you had enough
Over (?)
It ain't coincidental that I be distorted
And my manual
Minds
Is for seein', so I watch
Bodies and plots
Win the plots
Call the shots for your nuts
Nigga grips
That's why I (?) my dippin' progress
Cause why is all we tryin' to defeat the progress
I just ain't the one mystic to hit
Young Jonesy sees
Who I got a mission to hit
And constantly flips scripts
Outta wall with balls fast talkin'
And quick draws
How the problem is solved
I want it all (I want it all)
But it's movin' to slow
I'm out to blow
I don't know which way to go
Was on the right path
I thought
Without doin' a dirty word about getting caught
("getting caught" echoes)(Scratching by Daz Dillinger)

Dogg Pound
Don Corleone, whatever, whatever, Dogg Pound, East Side
Don Corleone whatever, whatever, Dogg Pound, East Side

For all my homies with the eight tray Regals (ride on)
And all the playas in the '79 Coupes (ride on)
For all of my gang affiliates in tha hoppin' '68
This ones from me to you (ride on)
Well, not the Under Dogg, call me the Wonder Dogg
I keep it crackin' while I'm stackin' in this game called rappin'
Now I kick up my feet like I kick a rhyme to a beat
And everytime you see me on the streets ,I gots some heat
Hell, yeah, then pass the beat
And everybody wanna know what's up with me and Master P (ughh)
For your concern, you knew there wann't no gimmick
When I got into some gangsta shit and told you wann't No Limit
To the thangs I'm gon' do
Now it's really goin' down with the DPGC
Well, Daz did the beat, and Kurupt got the heat
And Tray Dee, he laid the hook and Supafly played the keys (woo, woo)
Ughh, it get no realer than this from the LB to the Down South
Add more killers to this entourage
South, West, oh, yes
We in charge and we'll pull your cards
No disrespect or disregards
Life in the big LB is gettin' hard (so what)
So my squad gon' mob and drop bombs
Ring the alarm, we causin' everybody harm

Chorus 2x:
I make ya scream (ahhhhhh)
I make ya shout (ooooohhh)
C'mon all you party people
Let me turn ya out
Cuz you know I'm all about
The hoes, money, and clout
And I rock a Long Beach City (heyyyyyy)
All the way down South

Can you feel me?
I can dig it
Hoes- Take me to the bridge

Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (who)
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (what)
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (who)
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg

Whether in a Khaki suit or a pimped stripe
I'm a G for G and dat there's for life
You can bet your bottom biscuit
You get twisted if you dwellin' in my felon intuition (what up)
Tha Doggfather is a household name
From basketball to alcohol, everybody love the Dogg
I'm sure Billy Clinton probably got a Doggystyle tape
Somewhere hidden in his briefcase
Newsweek, Rolling Stone, major magazines
Dope fiends, prom queens, we too clean
Take a look you ain't ever seen
One hip-hop rapstar drop this West Coast rap-cord
Back to the spot up top
West Hills for real, give it up to him (WC)
I hoo-bang with diamond
Take a hit with B-Legeezy or 40 Fonzereezy
With blue Colion playin' in the backround
On the behind line with big style
Hitting P, LIG tell him let it go
Game strong, no longer in the roll
Just a few names from the respected files
LBC styles, DPG ale
I bought a house with a lake in the back
My big holey stack just like that

Chorus:[Daz Dillinger] (Soopafly)
(A Soopafly/Daz production) Suckas!
How many real homeboys y'all got out there?
Can y'all count on one hand?... I can
Straight up, Dogg Pound Gangstas
Funky fresh in the flesh
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' bout
Yo Kurupt, kick that

[Kurupt]
I ain't shit without my homeboys, although at times it seems
Tryin' to make it to different stages, lifes and dreams
Different mistakes that was made during the time of the struggle
Two pits unleashed but held by one muzzle
It's complicated like a puzzle, puzzle pieces and money double
The royal rumble, fools really in trouble
I'mma hit the spot and snatch all the knots and pots
Then get ghost while the most of y'all get gots
To get the fuck outta here, ain't nobody else I can call
(Who that?) Besides my motherfuckin' doggs
I ain't shit without my homeboys

[Daz Dillinger]
When there's trouble who the fuck can you rely on
To die on onsite, me and niggas do it wrong or right
I ignite the fire, marijuana gets me higher
All this drinkin' and smokin' really gettin' a nigga wired
Gettin' paid, that's my only desire
Big Style, Lil' Floss, Tray Deee and me
K-U-R-U-P-T, Soopafly and Crooked I
Until then, I hope God don't pass me by
Everyday I work harder to try
Never to fall but I hope to rise
Everyday before I open my eyes
To my cousin Big Flip locked down in the pen
To my other homeboys I won't ever see again
Life gone in the wind, like a lottery spin
When it comes down to it nigga who's ya foe and ya friend?
And I ain't shit without my homeboys

[Crooked I]
So what could make a crook stay down for his troop?
Could it be the gunshots we ducked as a youth, huh?
What about the cops we hid from on the roof
Or the shootouts we survived without wearin' a bulletproof
We fruits from a tree that was rotten to the root
We wasn't 'posed to make it, our survival don't compute
I had to chase the paper cause the loot would run from me
We had Navigator dreams and only bus money
We rise and we fall together, all together
We crawl and we ball together, doggs forever
Like uh (and ya don't stop!)
Fuck around with one of the homies, watch the Glock pop
One love and keep hollerin' back
We can split my last dollar in fact, pop your collar to that
Crooked I need the whole click
And like frozen chitlins, that's some cold shit
My nigga, some cold shit

[Soopafly]
Cold shit when you elevate and get into some more shit
When we ride together niggas be like "Oh shit!"
Dogg Pound in the house rockin' the party, all night long
Gettin' high to the break of dawn
Chipped up like a cellular phone
Back up, watch it shine like chrome
Individually we the shit
But together we can't be fucked with, we crush shit
Never settle for less than the plush shit
But still don't forget when we was broke
About 9 or 10 locs with only one joint to smoke
Man, I can count on both hands the different stands
And plans niggas took to make it better for the fam'
We made our first five grand, was like "god damn"
New khakis and Cortez
We learned the essential meaning of what a whore is
Still clockin' more biz
Always lookin' up cause if you look down you're fucked
Soopafly, Taylor'd up like Chuck's
But I ain't shit without my homeboys
And that's real shit

[Baby S]
I ain't shit without my homeboys...
True thuggish Capone's, real niggas I knew before I was grown
A lot of motherfuckers died, but I'mma still ride
And represent the evil motherfuckin' Westside
It ain't nothin' but trues, real niggas who paid they dues
Picture me rollin' with gay dudes
Nigga please, we G's and dress like we serve ki's
On the block where we chop rock, re-cop and make G's
Down to die for each other, it's you and I for each other
In a gangsta matrimony we brothers
Can't nothin' seperate game, we game from initiation
Marks fuck around and catch heat sparks
Casino Gang's the gang that a motherfucker claim
Rump Segal, Lonnie Mack, E-Mack, it's you mayne
I ain't shit without my homeboysIntro:
Scratching
Yes yes y'all (x8)

Verse 1:
Ruff roughed the incredible one Soopafly come with the bomb
A pound to brake a motherfucker down
Surrounded by subliminal thoughts to keep me criminal minded
You'll find it's hard fuckin' with a dog that'll scar
Your whole mind body soul approach
Devastated elevated your shit never made it
However can one dare to compare a style rare from ground to air above
Showin' no love now it's the pimpin' flow
Intrests show that you ain't hittin' no mo
Your shit's gettin' old forget the past
Don't let the past pave a way to the world occupied by MCs that I slay
Affect the first when I select a verse
To hit you with the worse intention
Blast in three dimension sharp like a ginzu
Then you will understand that I split a nigga into fragments of a man
Differental from pots to pans opposition at a glance
I rate and taki' chances quick to brake like branches
I'm like a banchy on a midnight get right or get even
You're Wondering like Steven running from day light to evening
Time cause I bust shots to injure
I stay black and smooth like a ninja
It's Soopafly quick to throw them thangs
I get the money and rings motherfuckers can't hang cause

Hook:
I don't hang with no bustas
I don't hang with no fags
I don't hang with no conniving ass niggas who ain't out there makin' cash
Sho nuff don't hang with no snitches
Sho nuff don't fuck with no bitches
I'm only out for my riches
So motherfuckers stay the fuck out my buisness

"Feel the beat"
"I gots to have it"(x3)

Verse 2:
I'm unexplanatory like Rogain
What's your name was mine
Soopafly game do or die
Death becomes those who oppose and run up
Motherfuckers get done up on a one two come up
Evidently you've been bitin' for years
All skills to adapt to (nigga I'll pimp slap you)
My rhyme'll trap you attractin' bitches and hoes
Then developin' 51 flows
I suppose I got you runnin' like a nose
Life threat shoot out to my niggas that can't get wet
Betcha I spoke a lecture I let cha think everything's fine
Then react ina blinks time
Overdone I'm rated number one contender
The war zone engage or surrender
Now if the kicks fit nigga wear that shit
Give me a stage and microphone I'm bound to tear that shit
The fuck up now what cha gonna do?
Take a seat or step to my mystic well then pack the concrete
Now how you gonna act? I'll lay your ass flat
It's Soopafly comin' with the shit like that

"I gots to have I cause I want it I need it" (x2)

Verse 3:
Now only I control thee unfold thee
Uncut and uncensored flow inventor it's ah
Sort of like a mixture can you picture
One calm and cool one that burn like the sun?
The one two two to three
Soopafly rolls freely high to the sky
Motherfuckas can't see me I'm skulls like a beeny
I'm disappearin' like a geney
Intoxicated off the Remy
Martin I'm startin' to box up fools by the carton
It's the one incredible fly
I fly by day droppin' bombs on thee E.P
With Dat Nigga Daz still representin' D.P

Waitin' baitin' for my ass to flip flop but I don't flop (flip flop) (x4)
No I don't[Verse One: Goldie Loc]
Look baby I know you done what you had to do
I was in the red neighborhood draped in all blue
I'm tryin to scoop them little checks up
But the minute that I'm in it then you talk about hold up
Somin change man the shit feels strange
I should of never sold your ass my sixty eight ways
Ever since I scooped you up in my big black truck
I been lookin for your ass cuz a nigga wanna fuck
You know what I'm doin ain't sippin
Cuz when you see me with my three hoes baby that's hip
Is this the reason why your ass actin funny
You only bring your ass around when I'm spending my money
I was breaking my probation taking your ass places
Cuz that's a violation. me and you conversation
Don't have nuttin we face it
I gotta lot hoes that I can run around chasin biatch

Hook: [Soopafly] & {Latoiya Williams}
Girl I don't know what you done done
But it's not feeling good to me {not feeling good to me}
I wouldn't of done what you let me do
You brought out the freak in me {brought out the freak in me}

Boy I don't think that you really know how much you mean to me
[How much you mean to me]
Had to walk away and let you go
Cuz you brought out the freak in me [you brought out the freak in me]

[Verse Two: Tray Deee]
I use the move with the nest spittin jewls at the best
She a thug but don't come with that rude disrespect
I got game but not playin sportsment like
You only did against me if mama tought you right ooh
So what cah hair wet nails dipped in all
You gone say Tray Deee Tray Deee take the penitentry fall
No don't ask me yet i rather let the time reveal
If you object just a sex being mind fo real
Can you relate give me space until its time to chill
You know I put it down and make it how you like to feel
You be another sucka you could floss and toss
It ain't the cost just the fact that I'm a mackin boss
I like to dig you out but I don't dig you mouth
So usually ??? hit the ribs and back
Don't hate the gangsta baby cuz I'll call you soon
Don't sleep too late check out ime is noon

Hook: Soopafly & Latoiya Williams

[Verse Three: Suga Free]
Naw uh-uh wait, see Snoop what home girl on the chorus say?
Got turned out and wanna walk away pshh
I’ll let that happen when you stop rapping and Richard Pryor starts talking today
See life is like a piñata, baby go hit it
But don’t be suprised if it jumped out took the stick from yo ass and starting whoopin' yo ass with it
And how much I mean to you? I don’t care
Trick especially if you lacking la-da-da-da I don’t care
And your where-abouts, sucks teeth
Please! Ain’t a bone in my body that’ll prolly allow me to attempt to pretend that you something that I care about
And if it was left up to me you would be walking away getting me some money, Not walking without no guidance doing it free
Like Constance’s friend Who dat?
Oh, you know baby grandma stay right across the street from the church around the corner from Ms. Johnson and them
(Oh you mean glee ba-da-da shabba da ho)
Nice and easy, and if there’s a cure for this I don’t want it[Intro: Lil Wayne]

If you looking for some coke I'm your supplier
No TV my life like The Wire
Everything I say from what I did prior
Real street nigga I'm the one they admire
Niggas ain't Gs they motherfucking liars
The industry full of fruits like papaya
Shoot em in they neck and they back like (?)
I roll like a Michelin tire
I annihilate those who perpetrate
I squeeze, I don't hesitate
The four-five will set a crooked nigga straight
You hate, I participate
O '10 Benz with the temporary plates
Rolling to the club, about to find me a date
Shit is simple, it ain't rocket science
Grand Daddy Purp, know I get the highest
Embassy jean jackets know I'm the flyest
Anybody can bite the bullet, I ain't biased
I get it in, my connect Mexican
Prices so low, it's a win-win

Casualties bound to happen over cash actually
Or perhaps a nigga just jealous, it baffle me
It's Willie

Niggas where I'm from only understand savagery
Casualties bound to happen over cash actually
Or perhaps a nigga just jealous, it baffle me
So, get shot, quick fast on the double
This black 40 Glock inside my Moncler bubble
More money, more trouble
Never meddle with the rubble
I ball never double
Get the drawers never cuddle
I play my cards right
Caught a play inside the huddle
Caught inside the shuffle trying to muffle the rebuttal
Niggas don't bite they just barkin' through the muzzle
Everything in moderation I prefer to keep it subtle
I know Young LA, the real Young LA
Willie the Kid, I'm going hard doing 2 a days
Anyway, nigga understand my vision
On a boat Lake Michigan a couple chicks fishin'

Herb is a plant

We live by the motto
There you know, Dank we trust
It’s a smoky movement
With q-pees to prove it
Maintaining our cruise speed
Smokin only OG
Lift it up, like the trees
Higher than Bee Gees
Bitches want to meet me
But they can’t smoke for free
Aroma, we you can’t be part of it
If you wasn’t there when I started it
Alcohol in my bong, is a harder it
Give a fuck right up punk ass compliment
I’m as hard as an OG
Back in the days
I got J for days in a major way smokin’ major pain and bathe ape

[Hook : x2]
We’re smoking that shit
In a major way
Say
Never want to hit
That’s Spank ‘n’ Dank
So, I get the hit
And something on the split
Down with you lick
Smoking on
Yeah

Turn it up Wanch
Turn it up Wanch
Turn it up Wanch
Turn it up Wanch

[Spanky Danky : Verse 2]
What’s life without that dirty sprite
How do you sleep without OG at night
Rest in peace Bob Barker
I guess the price was finally right
Young hippies do come out at night
Ready to party, but not starting fights
Cause that’s not what hippies do
We just smoke up any dose
The closest thing to mushrooms
My flow is bigger than this room
Big hitting hoes, get out of room
I don’t base with no clues
The devil dress is really blue
So you all just put more stress in your dose
In your dose
In your dose
In your dose

While I’m just smoking cash
Rolling hash
Twisting shit that you never had
Puffing OG man
The opposite is why I’m glad
And I’m still switching it up, twisting them blunts
Burnt everything that the one left for you chump
And even if it was I got a OG cush buzz

We’re smoking that shit
In a major way
Say
Never want to hit
That’s Spank ‘n’ Dank
So, I get the hit
And something on the split
Down with you lick
Smoking on
Yeah

[Hook : x2]

Hold it up, blow it up
Cops smell it, they know it’s us
In Dank we trust
In Dank we trust
In Dank we trust
In Dank we trust

Didn’t we ask that herb
Didn’t we ask that for us
Alright
And even that shit, believe me
You asked that herb
Herb, isn’t that that you did it four times
But it’ll be more important with me

Herb is a plant
I mean, herbs are good for everything
Why, why these people wanting so much good for everyone
For everyone, who call themselves governments and this and that
Why they say must not use the herb[Snoop Dogg]
Step inta the party as I bust a ho
I'll lean up on the wall until I'm ready to go
I'm sippin on some juice with a twist of Mo
Comfortable, smokin' some dope
The bitch that I'm wit is so flexible
From Mexico, man I like this ho
The homey little Tony told me a long time ago
"Hey Dogg sit there and smoke and grind the ho"
But you know me I don't dance too much
Unless that shit OD like the party's at the Hutch
What? what? remember double dutch
Ow, the bubble butch
All up in the party swangin' E's and C's
Wit a car full a heat, hope you want my beats
I came to the party dog by myself
Twenty out a twenty-one I'll leave wit somebody else
It's somethin about the way I rock a fuckin mic
Big Snoop Dogg what that Crip like
My nigga Fred Wreck with a G in the seat (ya know)
To make it complete (uh huh), cookin the beat (woo)
Takin' it back down Parliament Street
Look at this shit so funky, funky, coka, loca, ropa, dopa
Hit 'em with a smoka, pick a place to dope up

[Hook - Kokane w/ voice]
I pledge allegiance to the House for which it stands
We got some ghetto ass niggas, makin ghetto jams
OH what I'm feelin is that in my Cali ways
So roll some dope, (oww) and go ahead and blaze

[Goldie Loc]
God damn Loc here we go again
Steppin in this bitch to show these niggas how I did
Dogghouse done brought out this gangsta shit
And point blank, can't nobody fade my clip
Don't even thank the trick
You know what we ain't inta hatin
But anythin you tryin' to brang we ain't inta takin
Can't you tell these outfits cost a fortune
Security stay alert to use enforcement
Ass cheeks pass me, I grabbed 'em hips
Dancin through the crowd to a badder bitch
The gas was quick, but not for mack I spit
I stopped at Iceland and got this platinum dick
You can't attract a bitch, my game accurate
You wanna laugh and trip, I'm out to crack the whip
I ho that's fast and thick, and ain't gonna ask me shit
Get a blasted lip, and she attacked the dick
Yeah bitch

[Kokane]
We gon' bust and we gon' rip ride
Walk on to, to the other side
The most ignorant ass niggas in the game
Tray Deee, Goldie Loc, Big Snoop and Kokane
I'm come all night pickin up these freaks
Fuckin hoes make these bitch niggas buckle
Dogghouse we unstoppable
Uh, don't worry bout it, Crips control the mic

[Hook]

[Tray Deee]
I stepped in the party wit some blue and white Stacy's
Right side Kacey, left side Tracy
I'm feelin' like the shit, as I slide through grinnin
Dogghouse nigga don't you know we winnin
Left side gangsta, right side busta
Say the wrong thang and get shot motherfucker
When snitches get popped, the hood gettin' hot
Ain't no cops around town, they afraid of gettin shot
Keep it on the low low, fuck that gang bang
Slang 'caine, anythang for my paper mayn
It's easy to see (what) that I'm a motherfuckin ghetto ass G, can't fuck wit me
Do it do it, loco 'til your casket drop
I'm a do it cause the Crip pop don't stop
You think you can see me, I know you motherfuckers wanna be me
Light it up, blaze it up, ain't no need for chokin
If I had anotha blunt wrap I'd be smokin
Locin waitin on Wreck to get back
When he get back perhaps I'm blazin up a sack
So relax, that's snaps ain't right, it's all good
I got your back next time you dippin through the hood
Just make sure what you got insured is fine
You already know I got my money on my mind, nigga

[Outro - Snoop Dogg & others]
Fuckin wit these niggas ain't the way to go
Comin from the Eastside we so rep the boss
Checkin for your bitches, now we're fuckin ya ho
Dogghouse fo sho, we untouchable
Niggas who ain't wit it, betta duck and roll
Bitches know we comin and they lose control
Stepped up in the party and they rushed the door
Dogghouse fo sho, we untouchable[Intro: Daz & (Soopafly)]
Man, Soopafly, how you feel about these bitches?
(Fuck 'em)
You know what I'm saying?... But the pussy is good
(Yeah, it is nice)
Heh heh heh

[Chorus]
I said - I said - I said it might sound crazy but I'm so in love with you
I said it might sound crazy but I'm so in love with you

*over chorus*
[Girl]
Daz, I'm glad you broke up with that bitch
Yeah, I know what time it is
[Daz]
You in love with me?!
[Girl]
Yeah baby, I'm in love with you
[Daz]
Check it out, baby
[Girl]
What's up?
[Daz]
I'm about clockin' dollars...
[Girl]
Hey, give me some
[Daz]
Handlin' my business and (hey, nigga) kickin' hoes to the curb
(break that bitch) after I get my thang and that's right
[Girl]
I know that's right, right, right, right

[Daz Dillinger]
Woke up one bright morning out some bomb ass cock
Feelin' like the man as I shake the spot
Freaked the girl named Tameka, made my bass thump deeper
My girl huntin' me down, paged a nigga on my beeper
As I continue to adjust the amps and bust the speaker
My girl paged again, and again, and again
As I'm diggin' out her mother's best friend
Askin' 'bout my kids, say they gettin' big
As we moan and dig
Fucked another - she was kinda thick but kinda slim
Freaky little thang named Kim
Askin' when we gon' engage in bomb sex again
I'm askin' her "when you gon' give me bomb head again?"
I mean she took me to her houseW
Orked a nigga straight, turned him out
Wanna know the freaky thangs that you talk about
I really wanna make it rough, make it soft, no doubt
If you wanna fuck, then we can turn it out
You in love

[Chorus]

*over chorus*
(Baby, I want you to fuck my homegirl
Baby, you like the way I suck your dick, don't you
OOoohhh, you love the way I lick your balls)

[Daz Dillinger]
Told Miss Harris it was too late to stop and too late to quit
I was lovin' that pussy while she was lovin' this dick
I was shovin' it in her while she was yellin' don't quit
I was diggin' her out, while I was suckin' her tits
She said - "Let's have a freaky, freaky, freaky type experience
That's very diff-er-ent, that's so magnificent"
She had a bad bad bitch named Spearamint
Thought she was the gum the way the bitch hummed
Let's get freaky tonight, let's get rolled
Let's get high as a kite, ya know
Baby gave a show, true indeed, the way she ate a niggas dick
I knew she was a pro, I knew she was a pro
I had a young tender that I'll always remember
Named Dana, needed dick just to tame her
Every two months. I'd telephone her ringer, just to bone
To come over at night when her man ain't home
I keep the weed just to keep her stoned, huh
And I'd fuck and be out 'fore dawn, huh
I gotta page from another homegirl named Shy
Baby loved to lick her tongue, holla, holla, an' give me some
Daz make a bitch cum like never before
Do it fast, do it slow - fuck me like you want it
Hittin' every little organ by her stomach
Stop back up, bitch who the fuck keep you cummin'...

[Daz talking]
And you know, sometimes the pussy still be callin' my name
And the pussy be like - ("Ooo Daz, keep me cummin'")
And I respond to the pussy like - "What's happenin'"
And you know Too $hort that's some real player shit

[Too $hort]
Nigga Daz is a real player

[Daz]
It's all the way hot

[Too $hort]
$hort Dog's in the house

[Daz]
Shit

[Too $hort]
Oh, you know I know these hoes

[Daz]
And you know that

[Too $hort]
I can't fuck with you, I need a bitch like Tracy
Got a good job, when she walks in the place, she -
Gets respect with them big-ass tits
She ain't no first date dick suckin' tramp ass bitch
I pick the winners, never get the wrong ones
Check me right now, I got a pocket full of phone numbers
She said "You wanna be a player all yo' life?
You'll never get a woman you can call your wife"
You see, Tracy got it going on, see her try to get wit' me
Her sister got my beeper number, keeps on hittin' me
Think I fucked her twice, long time ago
But now I like Tracy and she won't let go
I know a trick ass nigga might think it's scary
Will it come back on him if he gets married
I don't give a fuck about bitches in the past
Cause if I put it down, I'ma make the shit last
And get the cash, bitches always talkin' that love shit
No, it ain't happ'nin', tell me what's up bitch
Actin' like Michelle when I told her I missed her
She said I love you right after I kissed her
What she wanna say that for? - Not today
Niggas like us, you know we stuck in our ways
Ask Lisa or her niece huh, I never pay 'em money
Had a little freak by the name of Laid Lonnie
I live by the game, that's what I'm all about
The bitch started trippin' so we had to fall out
Think I'm supposed to pay, cause I got ends
I said "Fuck you bitch, and all your friends"
That's an everyday scenario, now here you go
Tryin' to be good to me, I can't feel it though
My old school tramp sucked a damn good dick
I tried to turn the bitch out, she couldn't handle it
Trick beotch!

[Daz]
C'mon, trick beotch

[Too $hort]
Trick beotch!

[Daz]
Trick beotch

[Daz]
Now you done fucked me
You done fucked Too $hort
Done fucked my cousin
Done fucked Nate
Shit, huh, just done fucked everybody
It might sound crazy

[answering machine (ladies voice)]
Just leave a personalized message for me
Were you talking to me? Do you be thinkin' 'bout me, huh?
Baby. Do you be thinkin' 'bout me?

[Daz]
Shit, how this bitch gon' call me, Soopafly
And she just sucked a homeboy's dick
Bitch[Technique]
By dawn's early light
I shine brighter than the stars in the night
And 'bout ready for a fight
Come noon, I've consumed enough juice
To cut loose and throw a mic to the moon
Since I'm the sun, I'll make you one, it's all for fun
I'm torching hot and all the same
From playing war games with Saddam Hussein
Now who's sane? I'm insane, my membrane's on cold-grown
The tempature's rising, to fry the cells in your dome
It might be on, and if you think so, you know me
It's Tech Caponey, the Doggfather's little homey

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Ain't that somethin', how I got little homeys now?
I remember when I was just a little bow-wow
Writing for my rep, calling 'fore I step
Now I put niggas in the game just to stay on deck
High profile, but my style low-pro
Top dogg on the Row, Doggystyle C.E.O
And I blow the best indo, that you know of
So when I'm in your town, dip down, and show love
You know what? What's up? Shit, I'm feeling good now
You better come and get me 'fore I fall into a freestyle

[Technique]
They say, what's a rapper? Well nigga, what's an emcee?
If they don't got the skills, then they don't roll with me
Ain't that the truth?, I'm bulletproof off the roof
I got a mic and a fix, that'll jack you for your tooth
I'm out for rep, but how long will it last?
I'm coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash
At last, I'm at the top, so I maintain now
Gotta bang now, nigga this Doggystyle

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
All she ever wanted was a small time, love thang
Got my homey caught up in the dope game, coke game
He so sprung, on top of that he young
He's only thirteen years old, and the world's so cold
He never took the time-out to fall down on his knees
Until he fucked his G, got some keys, now they's enemies
The niggas he grew up with, they put him in the game
Now they 'bout to take him out the game
Man it's a shame, but you know how that shit go
That's life in the fast lane, that's why I roll slow

[Hook]: Kurupt,(Snoop), [*some singing in the backgound*]
I'd rather not get shot
I'd rather sit in the studio and rock spots
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, we're one big family, it's all D.P.G. (D.P.G.)
I got a G on the best bomb money can buy
I ain't out for no homicides, I'm out to survive
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, one big family, it's all D.P.G. (D.P.G.)

[Technique]
(Niggas) Niggas and hoes will try to get you twisted
But I'm unlisted in the books
You base your life on that, you might get your life took, BLAOW!
Put me in the game, I'm riding hard 'til I win
Serve a crew, kill a few niggas, 'til the end
I mean, I'm a fiend for superior green
And all my life I got advice from a superior team
I gotta stay away from the casket
Don't get blasted, and tell my kids how I lasted
But my crew's mafioso, so my philoso-
Phy is to G to the day that I d-i-e [*echoes*]

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Snoop Dogg, smooth and imperial
Wake up every morning to my Lucky Charms cerials
Time's getting drastic, man I'm a flas it
Dogg Pound Gangstas' choking off that boombastic
Have you ever heard?
I'm loose, shook the feds, like the juice, Snoop Dogg is 121st proof
Fool, you's a deuce, Deuce is some Genuine Draft
I'm a genuwine, like ??, and all about cash, cash
Cash, I got some free, so indeed I gets the lighter for the hash
Has it ever been a time when you didn't have a dime
To your name, and the only way to gain is through crime?
Sometimes I used to pack, one time I got jacked by some sacs
But you know I got mine, you know about the Don Corleone
I'm-a survive and thank God for Lil' Spanky B. and Bone

[Hook]: Kurupt,(Snoop), [*some singing in the backgound*]
