Uh, they better watch what they say to me
Niggas still gettin' popped on the day to day

All day, nigga

[Refrain: Allan Kingdom]
I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I could do this all day, boy, I'm finna turn this bitch out
They need that Ye in the streets, boy, there's been a mothafuckin' drought
Don't really matter what I make, boy, you know I still go wild
Like a light skinned slave, boy, we in the mothafuckin' house!
Right now, you lookin' real sus right now
I swear I've been on this flight like a month right now
Stupid niggas gettin' money, Forrest Gump right now
Shout-out to Jackie Chan, I need to stunt right now
They've been lookin' at the Gram, I've been lookin' at the Grammys
Like, huh, that's us right now
24/7, 365 days, everybody gettin' paid
Niggas lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJs
People saying, "Ye, Ye, take it easy"
20 Gs for the Yeezys off of eBay
Niggas do the most and they ain't done shit
Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch

[Bridge: Theophilius London (Kanye West)]
(Hands up, hands up)
So won't you dance? ayy, ayy ayy ayy

Blazin
Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated
Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated

[Intro]
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

[Hook]
I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch again, same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning

[Hook]
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up, Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions"
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's our cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
Ain't no way I'm givin' up. I'm a god[Produced by Kanye West, Mike Dean & No I.D.]

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding, Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'mma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck about y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty-thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Hook]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost 30 mil, so I spent another 30
Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by 21
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah

[Bridge]

[Verse 4: Cyhi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Hook: RZA]
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know the shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous

[Bridge][Verse 1: Pusha T]
Re-Up Gang Pusha
(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)
But you found it, mutherfucker

All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil’s angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses
Couldn’t cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The Audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch have my son before I face that tragedy
I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse
Gone

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(You seek out problems)
(Looking for trouble)
But you found it, motherfucker

I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don’t judge me, uh, for the followin’:
Fat bitches swallowin', skinny bitches modelin’
Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
The devil stay testing, ’cause when you chase the pussy it’s a sin
But if it falls in your lap, it’s a blessin'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressin'
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers

[Verse 3: Cyhi The Prynce]
(Cyhi! Yeah!)

Boy, we lookin’ for trouble
Maybe if we wasn’t black, then we wouldn’t have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got twenty pounds of kush in the duffle
So I’m runnin’ through them circles, boy, I’m looking like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog, I’m good for a scuffle
Don’t be mad I whooped your ass, ’cause I’ve tooken a couple
Feds askin' niggas questions, but I wouldn’t rebuttal
‘cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Royal Flush, so kiss my royal nuts
Ain’t nothin’ silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now I’m eatin’ off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
‘Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
G.O.O.D., I do it, B.I.G. Sean Don, nigga
But you found it motherfucker

I’m, in, that no-smoke sec rolling motherfucking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you’re not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G-stack’s in my trousers
New Double D's smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo’ ass just finished a poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay, or Drizzy Drake?
Meanwhile, I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dyin'
Greet me wit’ a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool, ’cause I can’t see yo’ ass from this side of the TV, mutherfucker!

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice son
Your shoes too big too fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov', but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m ‘sposed to run?
Yo’ bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I supposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Fuck it, e’rybody can get it
When you’re this hot, e'rybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high e'rybody’s a midget
All this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothin'
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half past rich
With my badass bitch
And you don’t want no problems on some math class shit
So check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiendin' ’bout
What you been praying fo’? What you been screamin' ’bout?
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' ’bout[Produced by !llmind, co-produced by Kanye West, Travi$ Scott, and Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: D'Banj]
Stuttering
Giving 'em rest and making love again
In my best, I be the run again
And I have the man dem stuttering

[Hook: D'banj]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas watches is rough, grabbing our crotches
Yelling what up? The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yelling Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock, I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
I was born by a lake, chicken shack, and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Godly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it
Could have been living it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up
So it's (ashes to ashes, dust to dust)
In God we trust, the game is all us
'til the sky calls or it's flames on us, Push

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
I'm chilling in my camo, flipping through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo's a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position

[Verse 5: CyHi Da Prince]
I hope the people is listening, I could never sell my soul
I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickeling when I hear what haters be whispering
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Fake friends and siblings
Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15, I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21, they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

[Break: Kid Cudi & (Kanye West)]
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(Naw man, mad people was fronting
Aw man, made something from nothing)

[Outro: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know
Some people call that the art of war, you know
I guess it depends what you falling for, the clothes?
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was fronting
Goddamn, we made something from nothing[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, ménage
Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la renta(y)
Your hijo - pequeño, my nachos - bel grande
Stay sippin' that André
Spent 3 stacks - that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
Y'all couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!

[Verse 2: Bryant Dope]
I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic
I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says "what's up?"

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a [?], wish upon a star
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
Cause if music and money is the motive then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin'
I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: Retch]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', it still got me goin'
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke but tell Butter roll a blunt
Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own shit and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try em
He'll call me Retch but your bitch call me Bryan
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm draggin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin'?
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trainers cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds, [?] all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine [?] and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in LA with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit
Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
4 gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' shit
Avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to reign
Loving the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of hell's kitchen praying he don't stick from the stove
God got me, illum-i-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
'Bout 150
Let me tell y'all now, I want Nicki
Lift her up high up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (what)
Keep fresh just in margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (naw)
[?] niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
But know it's over since I was [?]
You nervous like I thought you seen [?]
Got everybody thanking me
[?]
I'm a boss [?]
[?]
[?]
Cause I'm a mad man
Fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more 45's and 9s, I ain't talking bout no J's
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter
[?]
Riding shotty in the chevy [?] know as a Krueger
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy used to call the police
Get it good girl, use your knees
I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (for real)
Back on my Compton shit
Demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (what)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(CHECK!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's 2 or 3 and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice-cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key
Bitch we great, bitch we great, fuckin' set
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get it, we gotta get it, we gonna take it
Bitch we jump, say bitch we jump, we gotta make it
Couple racks up on them [?]
Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga
All I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga
Mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal
N.Y., them eagles
Fly through, get high too
Fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group
Come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin
Boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun pounding
Keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me
Me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up,  that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up
Hennessy, Louie V
Me and you, me and her
We as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one
Freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since 8 and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like "nigga don't move"
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk [?] like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado] x2
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room
Legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon?
All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack
Just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening
Now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls
Redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up
Wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor
Burning monks to [?]
Part of the action
Retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them
Watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun
Is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, 3 grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want I'm a zombie bitch I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo prada never gonna pile up
If you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meech]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know
Niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lector
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible
I've been on my mind for days
Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill king
To get their shot, [?]
I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
When I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game
Let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, "no way"
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real west side nigga, [?]
Might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
[?] put me high [?]
You can do that, flyin', fuck, do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on [?]
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Eric Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the mac truck bulletproof'ed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once
No voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Beamer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Nina's
Instead, I was that nigga puffin reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga then drip of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the work she see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome
Your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back
Cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb
And I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man
I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame
I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride
Hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die
Pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest
[?] chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say "fuck fate"
If I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to
While I'm fine dining on YouTube
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with an Onyx [?] on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing
These rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter
1-2, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something
I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable
Make shine sit on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body
Fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up
I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
Ti'l all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry
In backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger!
Y'all got me drunk as hell
Now I been rich since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your diction is lack, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, you get a rollie, rollie
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see you serve foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody to eat but her
She but like fuck them digits, stack them digits
Cut them then we benefit, cut them then we send them into
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprints on my golds, they all on my seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe rings, featured by me
Bitches know it's time out
They be fucking me so good, I be like 'Time out!'
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
She stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like 'Time out!'
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant ?, she tall like 'Zilla
I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo in another color
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked in no pajamas
Lil' homie ran off with lots of numbers
And for that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a pill together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growing wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my things together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Michael Montana
My ? say I got stamina
I cooking the Hannah Montana
I bury these hoes like Santas do
I kill every one of my features
I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yella bands
Just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian [?]
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing "daddy's home"
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it
And right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh
My nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day hundred
Cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit
You just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out, Pasadena, Kansas state
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar
Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face
Hoes like "he so angry", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you
Real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit
It's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: SL Jones]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Look like [?] we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes
I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit
Pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader
Still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa?
Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster
World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga
That's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
It's everyone goes, they can suck a [?]
We have another song, I won't fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka
Happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social [?]
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh
Got those motherfucking custom Roshes
Feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit
My Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson
I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic
Paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt
Three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the philly
My daughter's neck is chilly
My son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut
Look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth
Ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep
That's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I;m ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, i'm spending
You lames and you fall, i'm like 2 Chainz when i ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
And [?] sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
[?] what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em
Never write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched
And your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressing
Scorin' high off the [?]
Brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good
I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper
And she gave me the sloppy gooooood
So you should tip her if you execute
Young leisure suit
[?] with no extra loot
My ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemy
Yo what's up, see me on [?] tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz] x2
Need [?]? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need a thing, a thing, then I got it right here
[?] I got it right here, I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
Most of these niggas gon' hate
Me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon' swing
We all gon' catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap
Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase
But I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time
You ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die
I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick

Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh
Big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending
Been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'

Walter White, send a [?] to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris
And free my uncle Marky

Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off [?]
Rottweiler just to watch 'em

Get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers
Press the pedal to get farther

My loose change got me Bruce Wayne

Y'all was sleepin' on the flow just a couple months later
Now y'all purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, go for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
[?] a monk, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be into me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A black claimed king
Respect the illustrator
Don't you dare try the Elohim of flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up trick

Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn
The fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm
All but the limousine, swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene
Yeah that's a Spit sixteen
Hearts inside of my tip jar
Like a bleeding beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin'
Then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like [?]
I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans
Go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross
For all of that fifteen minute fame
But I'ma get my [?]
And the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip

So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My ? on a eastside ho ?????
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it
Flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it
Running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get "Faith" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID
Game leave me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some [?]
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
[?] throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', "Oh well"
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blastin' naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Man didn't chief
My sons of sons'll sandwich the beef
We get loot, always scram from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know?
So much wax in this bitch, smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
[?]
Nah, fuck that
Bring them [?] back
[?]
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
[?] I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
10 am, it’s Ransomnia
She see the glass, it's so obvious
Run from home, after tonight we up out of here
Don't go home cause they just ran me up out of there
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night
She run her mouth, but can't eat right?
Don't read between the line and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless
SMH, we all know that cocaine killed Abel
From the scholar letters devour this
She stepped into hell, cause winter got cold
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul
Don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know
Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs
Her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs
It should be here with me
Here is where her heart

[Break: Teyana Taylor & John Legend]
I beg for mercy today
They won't take me away
Take me away from you
Don't know what I would do
Don't let us die in vain
Don't let them see our pain
Wash these demons away
Wash these demons away

[Verse 2: Malik Yusef]
You are all unwelcome to Sin City
Yet the population still increases its density
And that increases its intensity
Which increases the propensity
To complicate your simplicity
No matter your ethnicity
All for the sake of publicity, in this city

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
Huh, bad bitches with ass shots
Use a house as a stash spot
Lexus coupe with the rag-top
I'm in the loop, boy I'm tied like an ascot
I used to run with the have-nots
Kept the ave hot just so we could have knots
A lot of niggas see they dreams in a glass pot
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
We broke all the commandments
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched
Come spend a day in my Hamlet
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
But this life'll take a toll on ya
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices
I know who Christ is and he never hung with the Saints
It makes no sense to save the righteous
By the age ten, we were caged in
Now they raise men in the state pen
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins
God bless the city, amen

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Malik Yusef]
And now I'm one of the residents
They walk with none of the repercuss, but all of the decadence
And all the fuckin' debauchery
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like
Cause I could feel it in the air tonight
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite
But I am willing to share tonight
In the city that is as unfair as life[Hook: Chris Brown] x2
A hundred fuckin' bottles (x6)
Stuntin' is my motto
With two-hundred bad models

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
A hundred fucking bottles, I wanna fuck a model
I got her on Patron, she open like a novel
I told her make it wobble while I grab her from behind
Then she made it wind so I ordered some Moscato
A couple hookers and a bucket of that Rose
We up in this bitch, niggas grilling like chipotle
Twenty bottles waters, cranberry and some OJ
Throw that money in the air, watch it fall like a snow flake
I smell like Kush and Dolce
I'm on that gin & juice and I'm feeling like the old Dre
I'll be lying if I said I wasn't drunk
It feels like I smoked a hundred blunts
And I ordered like

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Oh my god waiter
We packed up in this bitch
And I'm feeling the hater vapors, yeah it's hot up in this bitch!
But boy you will never phase me
And I know why you hate me
Cause my fucking cleaning lady
Look hotter than your bitch
And you know I'm about to spend
A hundred racks up in this bar, bar
You don't wanna drink you wanna be noisy Mrs.Aard-Vark
And I know that you not used to rejection
But if you don't get naked get the fuck up out my section!

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
You know I do it the biggest
Got these bitch niggas hating
Got these bad bitches jizzing
Holdin' down my city, but I picked up that commission
Boy, I run my city so you might need my permission
I'm just champagne pissing? Drink it till I might drown
Seen her in a wedding dress, I've seen her in her night gown
Will she take me out to eat, while you'll be trying to eat her out
Got a hundred fucking bottles boing with my weiner out
Damn right, I got a hundred fucking bottles

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2[Produced by M16]

[Intro]
3:16 it is still the gospel in the whole story, because in 3:16 it is the greatest verse and the greatest text in the Bible
"God so loved the world that He gave His begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have an everlasting life!

[Verse 1]
Yea, CyHi!
Why panic if this how God planned it
My eyes slanted from smoking a gigantic
Got dammit the dope is on 5 planets
ATLien, Decatur where I landed
If I get married I hope my bride Spanish
Yea I'm kinda manish
Put some dick where her diaphragm is
But fuck relationships and friendships
Cuz I rather die on the Titanic
Live calm or die frantic
I don't do the back and forth
I throw the deuces my advantage
I'm affiliated any  drama we fire canons
In the jungle with them trees, my nigga, I'm Tarzanin'
Success is never luck it's more like smart plannin'
And the car parked is all black like Clark campus
Basquiat, paint picture without an art canvas
I always stood out my nigga I'm outstanding

[Hook]
God so loved the world gave his only begotten Rapper
If you believe in Him you live happily ever after
Word to the Pastor, smokin' this green pasture
CyHi the 3rd Chapter comin' back like the  rapture
My 3 16s nigga
My 3 16s nigga
Word to the Pastor, smokin' this green pasture
CyHi the 3rd Chapter comin' back like the  rapture

[Verse 2]
Champion from the Pantheon
I'm tired of people telling me what can't be done
From 2014 and beyond
If you ain't talkin money to me sonny than I can't respond
I'm from where them pistols whistle like Andy on
.223 just as long as Marcus Camby arms
At the St. Regis with a fancy blonde
Bitch you with a prince why you still got your panties on?
Smoke a gram with my girl while the Grammys on
Cuz this shit I write should have 11 Oscars
You ever met a author who holds his weapon awkward
This 38 my body guard I call it Kevin Costner
Street nigga, Reverend and a Rasta
Black Pentecostal who never read the gospel
My adversary do it for imaginary mobsters
The Prynce from Machiavelli cuz us rappers rarely prosper

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
CyHi!
Basking in the ambiance of the Mondrian
I'm starving like it Ramadan let's get this parmesan
I keep the piece I'm like Gandhi with a tommy gun
Slung so many elbows I think I might need Tommy John
But this rap bread sweeter than a honeybun
And I could never fall off and if I did I bungee jump
That's funny, huh? Armani, huh?
Fuck a bitch I rather see this money cum
You can't see me no more I'm out the country chump
With a girl from Capetown running naked cross the lawn
Imma don, Marcello Burlon
I swear to Allah my verses deserve to be in the Quran
Waalaikumsalam go to Barbados so fun
Ratchet hoes used to call me broke now the tables have spun
And I don't pay for pussy
Only buy shit you able to pawn
King David, the Psalm. Prophet like Jacob and John

[Hook]

[Outro]
Look at it for a moment. God is a great giver. God is the greatest. The greatest Lover: God. The greatest degree: So loved
The greatest company: The world. The greatest act: That He gave. The greatest gift...[Hook]
It ain't nothing new, dog, niggas gon' hate (yea)
I don't even listen, tell it to my 38 (yea)
Don't get it fucked up thinking Prynce ain't gon' spray
Got a first class ticket, shawty, to the pearly gates

[Verse 1: Cyhi]
I ain't no killer but dont push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to smokin kushy
Im pussy? Shit I doubt that, put it where yo mouth at
I can't stand a rat, I'm finna to snap like a mouse trap
I can't even lie, I got my ass whooped a couple times
But you best believe I'm always there when its knuckle time
Fuck a seat belt homie I dont ever buckle mine
Wait until I run into them haters I'mma muzzle mine
Like its ???, dog dont get yo shit split
Got a bunch of bitch clicks hogging up my shit list
Cause their girl call me Madden, all I do is hit stick
And I got my shit licked, nigga don't get it twisted cause

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
As long as you don't put yo hands on me, I'mma do my dance homie
If you do, I'mma leave you with a bunch of knicks like Mike D'Antoni
I stay with a ox like my man Sconey
They show me love in the D like I ran pony
So y'all ain't finna Young Berg me
Got a bunch of gangsta niggas up under me
That'll cap one, keep it on my lap son
All I see is nines around the house, I'm Warren Sapp, son
But I ain't no tough nigga, cause I get scared fast
But you know what they say about us, we empty lead fast
And my shit registered, ain't got no felonies
You smellin' me, I know fight words but never won a spellin' bee

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Prynce I heard you and them niggas ain't cool
Is it cause y'all can do what niggas can't do
We tryna build something
You dont think we bring tools
But we dont even care
We let 'em do what lames do

[Hook 2x]

Yea, yea, yea[Intro]

Champagne bottles, pretty girl, Moscato
Getting to the covers, no problem, cut the yatta

Woke up this morning, thrown on the Louie's
Keep some cameras on me cause my life is a movie
It's epic
Every day an after party
Every day an after party

[Verse 1]
I play in the Caribbean, swimming in them Benjamins
I was born flooding them, now it's time to ride on them
Forgiato, skinny tie, now it's time to emphasize
Make these niggas recognize I'm a Steven Spielberg
I direct the way you react, the every single word
The studio my VIP, and I'm on that lean on me
And I got some Puerto Rican bitches on their way to me
Plus a rock star spiked out, took a nigga fee

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, every day an after party
In my Cardy's, rolling up a sack of Marley
Old school, I could've bought a black Ferrari
Blue diamonds, my jeweler tried to Avatar me
I got rich from the Knicks, you can ask Amari
Call me pimping king cause I know how to mack a Barbie
And I don't got games, sorry that's Atari
I'm in the club fried, calamari
Y'all tryina get them M's

This should be illegal, y'all gonna have to charge me
Threw a 'on yo bitch, call it grand larceny

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pockets don't ' Ellie don't do that swag shit
Bad bitch, digging to rich, big in the jersey
Blood money, big face spinning, pussy we pass it
Hand cuffing, we dig 'em down, you niggas eat me
These niggas look and say, wanna see the Benz bitch?
Bugatti brought money but this ain't Puff, bitch
New wrist, get a new ho, new car, get a new crib
It's a movie, take a picture
It's epic the way that we live
700 for these LV's, wow, many hoes that live low
We wearing Gucci and no foe
Wearing trues and no fine
It ain't the same as Levi
My nigga riding 20 20, you niggas stuck in '09
We getting money, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I'm geeking, have you fucking faded
Celebrating constipated, shitting on them bitch we made it
I'm kinda famous, my friends call stainless
Black on white hoes on my dick, cruise faces
My drink so potent, I'm always smoking
I pop one pill and I can't stop rolling
Cause this my party, she pop one molly
We fucked in the club, can't tell nobody
I'm on molly, she's the one to party
I don't want to fuck, the kind of a suck
4 4 nigga, I'm a town shorty
I never had shit and I'mma risk all 40
I bought the whole bar, but tell about the car
And you get done till you pop 10 bars[Produced by Velous, Kanye West, Diddy and Charlie Heat; Co-produced by Mike Dean, French Montana and Noah Goldstein; Additional production by Plain Pat, Travi$ Scott, Allen Ritter & Mario Winans]

[Verse 1: XV]
Can someone tell me who this is all for?
And why I’m on the mirror’s edge, running on walls for?
20 biddies, one of Vizzy, this shit is uncalled for
But that girl with the ponytail should run with the dark horse
And I deserve it, all my life I worked hard for
Them other cats ain’t going in, that shit is soft porn
I overcame obstacles like parkour and if I get off course
It’s only ‘cause my banking is off shore
Now I ask for dutches, they give me double like jumping rope
Never been a virgin ‘cause I was always fucking dope
Doing something different, I’m getting top in convertibles
And I don’t spend a thing so why do I feel vertigo?
I be in the cut, tell them girls let’s get surgical
Fahrenheit 451, that paper we just burning through
Create money from me to cremate money, I earn it too
Do this look like work to you? Nah…

[Hook: XV and Erin Christine]
Looking at the lights like is all of this for me?
Everyone at night is here, all of this for me
Hands in the air, yeah all of this for me
Bottles over here, all of this for me
All of this for me, all of this for me
Life fast, lights flash, all of this for me
All of this for me, all of this for me
Models bringing bottles, yeah all of this for me

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
You for real? All of this for me?
Pussy, alcohol, and weed, all of this for free?
We ball hogging like we balling for the Heat
I did it first for passion, man this shit at least cost a G
Warner Brother T.I.G, turn this bitch to Dawson’s Creek
Papa John’s with the bread ‘cause we in here tossing cheese
Used to be broke as hell so I had to drop the streets
Till I got saved by them bells like I walk the hall with Screech
Come and get your bitch ‘cause your dog is off the leash
‘Cause we know how to party man, they call us Boston Tea
Plus I’m in an outfit that’s as sharp like Jaws’ teeth
Snuck my rosay out the club, what you think these bottles cheap?
With a model that call me baby more times than Monique
Niggas say I’m outta shape ‘cause my pockets is obese
I don’t care that’s your girl, all these broads in here are free
Don’t make me pull my arms out like I’m flexing my obliques

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vado]
Hermes belt with a H buckle, beige bubble
Stopping at her waist as she waits for you, stray bubble
But her quiet storm like a tre muffle, age double
No forgetting money and straight hustle
Fake muscles get you a off day, denim shirt be from All Saints
Sleeves rolled, I’m in beast mode, don’t get your boys spanked
30 and your broads think they got money from all banks
Check clear okay, we leave and tell ‘em all thanks
Baking a tall cake, I'mma need a wall safe
Mansion got four gates, three pools and a small lake
Quick to get it on time, I never call late
Shorty crashed the car, she called me before Allstate
R-U-G-B-Y, Seagull when you see me fly
Helicopter’s Petey Pab, Aston Martin DB9
We balling, can’t you see?
Different cars at one time, I’m like is all of this for me?

[Hook]

[Outro: Erin Christine]
Now wait a minute, raise your glass
Let’s toast to the, toast to the past
Lights flash, let’s be honest, you did all of this for me
Yeah, this shit was all I knew, you and me only
You did this all for me, baby don’t you see? All of this for me[Hook]
Out all night (Where you at Cyhi?)
I'm probably somewhere chilling
Depends on how I'm feeling
We'll be out all night (Where you at Cyhi?)
Riding through the city
When you leave the club, girl hit me
I'll be out all night

[Verse 1]
I'm picking out my outfit
Just finished dicking down a South chick
Got her hooked to the pole like a trout fish
She used to party but now she just wanna house-sit
She like me cause them niggas ain't about shit
Got clout, got her last nigga ousted
Jumped in the truck now my hand where her blouse is
Smoking on that kush and not that shit that's in your couches
With a tool cause I never leave the crib without it
Cause I really know what a drought is
I was next to them keys like a mouse is
My people had the blow for the low that's a crouch kick
Ha, bills like Parcells
Sold more than the Barksdale Cartel
But now he in a dark jail
But he started off the block, thugging, making hard sales
Hanging

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Shoot it out with local hustlers
All over local customers
If not them, the folks is cuffing us
We just want houses like the governors
Riding in my mobile guzzler
Headed to my mama house just to see what's up with her
Then we hit the party make sure all the girls loving us
Throwing money in the air, you know us Southerners
When we together shawty, doesn't nothing trouble us
You can keep ya ass, girl I'm going for the jugular
Ha, that was such a chuckler
But I still sneak her out the club, I'm a smuggler
Now I got her in my automo'
And all I know is her favorite spot to go is Pappadeaux's
I'm fresh from my head to my zapato's
But I apologize if I got ya ho

[Hook][Verse 1]
One for the money, yessir two for the show
Oh, No that was like 12 months ago

With a laid back delivery, my shit so comfortable
Rap Geronimo, blowing ganja smoke
Line them bitches up knock em down
Yeah thats domino
I'm talking big shit where the plunger go
Fuck it, let the plumber know
Chronicles of a warrior, valedictorian
GOOD Music we the best like DJ Khaled came on tour with us

Cause she gave the whole crew neck

[Hook]

So don't be mad at your hoMy music stay in people's head like an activator
CyHi lyrical assassinator
If your bitch look good i'mma have to take her
I'm feelin myself I'm a masturbator
I captivate her you captain save her
But we'll get to that chapter later
Hardway Musical is on the way, I'mma do numbers like a calculator
Stay on the road like a tractor trailer
I don't talk to lames I fax tha haters
Fuck what you heard I'm the Alpha Omega
And my money thick like mashed potata's
Gotta buncha bitches you can ask my neighbors
Self made nigga I don't ask for favors
The old school Chevy gotta Lambo feel
Sometimes I think I'm a Packers player
Riding through the city on a late night tip
Overtime man I work the late night shift
Gotta whole ounce full of dubs in the club
And I'mma sell it all that's a late night flip
Talk to me wrong and the K might rip
Who the fuck said they gonna take my chips
Niggas got beef so I went and bought a gun
Black 4-5 with a steak knife grip
Who the fuck wanna read that nigga
Get you knocked off for like 3 grand nigga
But I'd rather chill on the hill with a freak smokin on tree watchin C-Span nigga
Before I bust a gun I'd rather bust a pecan nigga
My N.Y. partner used to rock them tims
A-Town cats rock Eastlands nigga[Intro]
Arrange my books in order
Make up some nice stories to amuse you
Make things look smart and easy
Shape up the place, hungry for the

[Hook]
And if I found a thousand pounds, a thousand pounds (3x)

[Verse 1: Pill]
If I was privilidged enough find one thousand of that loud pack
Distribute it to trusted partners just so they can bounce back
Like juvie though, that's a thousand niggas say they knew me though
Random text messages just flexin on how they knew before the work came
That I would be a standout like a search stain
Pocket full of paper from prophet after the percaine
The first game, that I learned to play was that Tetris
Find a block filled em in and cash out on a necklace
He neckless, if he preachin' some wild shit, foul shit
Two shots now I'm sittin' in cells on some Green Mile shit
Perfect this, hustlin' rationed bustas left with some lacerations
Pounds that I've found I yawned feel like my luck awakened
We bluntin', a hundred times ten got me in
Came up and I would be a damn fool not to win
We bluntin', a hundred times ten got me in
Came up and I would be a damn fool not to win
Ok denn

[Chrous]

[Verse 2: CyHi Da Prynce]
If I ever touched a thousand I would front a bag to every hustler in public housing
All these fuckin' pounds and I would never touch a falcon
Call up my battalion tell em'that I got them brussel frostin'
Go buy some rifles for them cowards that be wylin'
Tryna' run up on us, hold that bitch up like a violin
Get hit once from the big pump, you flip punk
About my chips chump, I'm a chipmunk like Alvin
Uh, then I'm back to puffing loud and
Eyes cut lower than a Kung Fu master from Shaolin
Then I fuck a stallion in my medallion
On an island drinkin wine, cuttin' salmon
Hit the club, make a movie Robert Townsend
The way these diamonds shinin' in the ring throw the towel in
Smilin', thumbin' through this cash that I'm pilin'
Singing this Soprano man I feel like I'm Italian
WHAT

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Yuh, first thousand pounds nigga thought he hit the jackpot
Club polaroid pic, Benz symbol backdrop
Bent over redbone, she was just a mascot
Money fan can't cool you off when you that hot
Next stop car lot, Coupe wit the bald spot
Maseratti grill like a pit when the jaws locked
Malls shop a few hours took two showers
These two bitches goin' down like the Two Towers
Too sour you can see it in a hater's face
True cowards so I keep you in a hater's place
Drop them numbers on the pounds just to make em' 'scape
Weed the fake hustlers out I'm just makin' space
These niggas talk a good game I just make the cake
Niggas dying over here I just make the wake
Been seeing a thousand pounds I just scrapped the plate
For all the money that I stashed they ain't made a safe[Hook: Cyhi and Travis Porter]
Ok I represent for my city
Hold it down for my town
I'm riding down I-20
Hell yeah east bound
Those real niggas in Bankhead
All the way to Stone Mountain
I'm throwing up the A-Town
Throwing up the A-Town

Ok I'm sliding down on Lenox

A-T-L home of the brave
So I had to make a song for the A
Shawty this is where I'm born and I'm raised

Bustin like Chipper Jones with the gauge
I'm sicker than the CDC
Money longer than peachtree street
Been here before Luda had DTP
Huh, Southside to the Northside
I'm at the Hawks game sittin court side
Come to my city I'm the tour guide
I can tell you we're goin on a joy ride
Huh, this the new Atlanta
I'm a country nigga so excuse my manners
Every night of the week it's a club poppin
All you see is stars like the movie channel
Take you to the Bluff and then we shoot to Candler
All these other rapper tryin to use the grammar
I know they pissed of
Cuz we shittin on these niggas we can use a pamper
Money green like a new banana
From the A-Town so I had to do the anthem for
Zone 1 & Zone 6
And shout out to the Braves for letting me use the sample
Cause I...

[Hook]

[CyHi the Prynce- Verse 2]
A-T-L we back on the map
Where every lil nigga gotta strap in his lap
Anyway I just passed Capital Ave
Flying down 20 headed back to Dekalb
As I turn the wheel, by Turner Field
From round the corner from Summer Hill
I had sex with the girl at the Four Seasons
Had the bitch screaming out Thomasville
From Godby To Jimmy Carter
From Baker road to L-Town
This is where I made a lot of money
From all the bails that I mailed down
My teacher said I was jail bound
You tripping bitch you fell down
I dropped out of school could've went to open camp
But look at me I'm doing well now
All I ever wanted is to win a Grammy
Buy a box Chevy get it dipped in candy
You wasn't the shit back in high school
If you didn't have a girl who went to Chamblee
I'm CyHi a.k.a Mr. Bag a bitch like Kroger

Cause I....

Riding in the Cutlass smoking on a black
Man it don't get more Decatur than that
What's better than that ain't nothing better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
See through the bullshit like cellophane rap
All the slick talk we don't entertain that
Better take a step back, last nigga came 'round here talking shit
Left and never came back
Nigga I'm high, high like eagle pussy
Rolling up a heavyweight rap
My crib lay back, my chick lay back
My seat lay back yeah everything match
Niggas tryna act brave, man we the home of that
You lookin for whatever it's a zone for that
Getting paper ain't nothing wrong with that
Yeah we bout that coin like a laundromat
Maybe Candler Road make me feel like this
Or maybe OutKast make me feel like this
Put your A's up if you feel like this
We get the Georgia Dome jumping like we still got Vick
It's a dirty game and scared at that
Blame it on the red and black what better than that
Ain't nothing better than that, ain't nothing better than that

I put candy in it like eskay
Yeah, I don't mean sound cliché but I'm so G-A
Homie you can ask my DJ
Met the plug over there by the cheese cake
Don't think its sweet cause we serve it from the peach state
Me and Kanye riding down Redan
Throwing money out the roof yelling out Free Bandz
The motor in this bitch cost three grand
APD couldn't catch me with three hands
I'm back up on my A shit
That Big Boi Andre shit
That I'm Serious, that Trap or Die
Is the only thing on my playlist
I smoke swisher sweets when I chief blunts
Peters Street is where I eat lunch
Took your girl out to Lenox mall
She went downtown like Peidmont
Cause A-town my playground
I hate clowns that face frown
Cause it stay down from my waist down
Then I bus on em, Greyhound
Shawty yeen know your girl was a freak bitch
Today she let me hit for a 5 dollar bag of green
Now that's why I give her free dick

80’s baby, Grady baby, my Auntie was a candy lady
And her baby had a baby, the A-town born and raised me

From this whole world I tried to hide my face
It's the story of a bachelor
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place
It's just a story of a bachelor
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
The story of a bachelor
And I mess with memories I know so well
It's just a story of a bachelor

[Verse]
I wake up inside a California king
Brush my teeth and roll some California green
I wish I had a girl to cook a nigga dinner
But I don't, so I gotta order wings
It's hard to find a wife in my profession
In the strip club all night is my obsession
Half of the girls I used to like is baby mamas
Letting all them broke niggas pipe without protection
Man these hoes in my city don't change
They only fuck with niggas who get rid of those things
I can't see how they trick with no shame
I'd rather sit at the crib and play video games
I feel lonely even though I got a lot of women
People say they in love, but alot of y'all pretending
But for real I can't wait to get married
Somewhere in Paris and have alot of children but

[Hook]

[Verse]
I got a bachelor's degree
Cause I've been a bachelor at least
The last 7 years of my life
Shit I'm finna get my master's in a week
Huh, it's like I'm living with no emotions
I leave all my feelings below the trojan
She wanna be my girl but I just can't do it
So I'm home alone, chillin Macaulay Culkin
She living single, Queen Latifah
She said she went to high where her name is Khadija
She want a man that knows how to treat her
And she can't stand a guy who smoke a whole lot of reefer
So I already know I gotta leave her
Cause I got feelings for that pretty ho Keisha
Cause that's the love of my life
I sell it and I smoke it so I fell in love with it twice

[Hook]

[Outro]
From this whole world I tried to hide my face
But from this loneliness[Intro: Barry White Sample]
Midnight, seems so nice to me
It's the start of a new day
And there's no place in this world that I'd rather be than right here
With midnight and you
Right on baby
Right on

CYHI!

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
It started round 1976
Back when white folks was the only ones selling bricks
A little mary jane was the most you got arrested with
They hit you with some charges but it really never stick
Back when my daddy was bumping Earth, Wind and Fire
Blowing 'erb from the earth and the wind wants to hit the fire
We wasn’t selling them shawty, we was just the buyers
This was back when blacks first started getting hired
Then something perspired in the early 80s
Ronald Reagan introduced us to that perfect lady
If you cook it right its just like a cooking rice
Now your pockets looking right then you bought your first Mercedes
Now people getting addicted, mamas having early babies
The streets is getting crazy so you bought your first .380
And thats when niggas started dying every night
So go and sell some weed cause nigga this shit can carry life
I'm here to bury white

[Hook]
I'm here to bury white
I'm here to bury white
I'm here to bury white
CYHI!

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
Fast forward 1990 is the year
It started as a hustle, niggas made it a career
Now we fucking bitches, got paper up in here
Niggas killing in the 90s thought the 80s was severe
All them leaders in the hood, they took y'all from us
Fucked around and gave them all football numbers
Like rap shows, niggas was getting booked all summer
Them fokes don't give a fuck about ya
Throw that book at yo momma, your honor
Imagine growing up without a father
Section 8 your family always gotta ride the MARTA
Selling drugs was the only way I got a Starter
Jacket, and some Jordans thats what the television taught us
And our daughters
Missing with no amber alert, probably with some little boys
With they hands up her skirt
Her momma dancing, going to work
Even got married twice
Cause the first husband got indicted for that Barry White
Thats why I'm here to bury white

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
Now it's the early 2000's and the streets grew violent
From the baking soda and the see-through Pyrex
Mixed with Viola, be careful when you meet new clients
For the love of money they'll creep through silent
All you hear is police blue sirens
He used to play ball, went to a D-II college
Dropped out, met a plug from overseas who's supplying
Whoever thought niggas in the streets knew science?
How we get them bricks if we never own the boat?
They give you more time for hard than for soft
But on the low, the laws were made against us
Thats how they Willie Lynched us
Cause we only sold crack, we was never known for coke
They say it ain't over till the fat lady sings
But it's crazy how your own parter can hold a note
Better than Kelly Price just to save his petty life
Instead of giving you Barry Sanders, they gave you Jerry Rice

Thats why I'm here to bury white

[Outro: Dave Chappelle Sample]
Let's sprinkle some crack on him and get outta here[Produced by Grizzly]

[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Cyhi! Yeah

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
I got a paintbrush that you can't touch
Went on a date with the devil but I paid dutch
And shawty wore a Prada dress
With a Kate Spades clutch

Mona Lisa, Melanie Fiona Features
Got her in the loft heavily on the reefer
Ran up in her like a sneaker
Got her drinking margaritas
The pussy was picture perfect
Had her painted on the easel

Fly like an angel or an eagle on the needle
This how it woulda sound if it was a nigga in The Beatles
I'm from where they steal the speakers out your Regal
Man these young niggas evil shoot it out with the people
To my hood I'm like the tower to the people out in Pisa
You see this pyramid and say it's Illuminati
But not me, the first thing I think about is Egypt
Had your bitch doing kegels in the Begal
Went from "it was nice to meet you" to "taking off your top"
Ever since I met her at that coffee shop
She would come to the crib we would talk a lot
Listenin to Beethoven, Mozart and Bach
Now I'm kissin on her spot got her awfully hot
Sex is a art it's just like a Picas-
So don't do it for me do it for Basquiat

[Hook]
Ask me if I'm on the radio, I'm probably not
But I don't do it for the radio
I do this shit for Basquiat
So I don't care if you think my songs are hot or not
Cause I don't do this shit for y'all
I do this shit for Basquiat

[Verse 2]
I write my graffiti in Swahili
I don't follow, I'm not Phoebe
Fuck diabetes, I'mma die chic
That's the reason I'm dressed in this dashiki
Fly as Tuskegee, riding to my CD
Killin' your artists they ask me to sign a treaty
Edgar Allen, mixed with that nigga Idi
I mean can't nobody fuck with me in my city
When it comes to art, I'm the man bro
The fans follow me, everywhere my Van Gogh
Michelangelo, to your girl I'm Vermeer?
Shorty c'mere let me put these pearls in your ear
I been around the world in a year
I got the type of bars that could serve you a beer
And some Sake shots
Like the ones you get at the hibachi spot
Don't get your bitch dug out I'm Bobby Cox
My flow it'll bite your head off like Ozzy Oz
Born to be the greatest, so until my body rot
I'm the best overall, Osh Kosh Bigosh damn
Let the Gods be Gods
And get the guys that defy the odds
And your flow is Bob Ross
And my shit is more like Basquiat

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Imagine Leonardo, in a Gallardo
I'm doin well I always be at the Fargo
Color purple got me feelin like Harpo
I'm like a art show, at the Louvre
Andy Warhol on your whore's wall
Shawty quit fuckin with them cornballs
I'm Rembrandt on tour y'all
Or Jean Michel without his shoes
I'm Kanye but not as rude
I'm Banksy on top of blues
I'm Kidult with a tude
On the fire extinguish I made the news
G.O.O.D. music, we here to push the culture
We don't do it for exposure
Never confuse a painting with a poster
I can't believe you would disrespect Basquiat

[Hook][2Pac speaking]
Im not saying I'm gonna rule the world or I'm gonna change the world, but I guarantee you that I will spark the brain that will change the world. And that's our job, It's to spark somebody else watching us

[Verse 1]
Everything is Monumental
Prynce reporting live from the intercontinental
Tell black detective it’s the Temple
After that I'm doing what I do any instrumental
Check my credentials, I got sentimental
Value every time a sheet of paper touch my pencil
Mix Determination with potential
So ahead of my time my mind is eastern but I'm central
To be specific Keisha keep me twisted
I speak Prolific, man I should be teaching physics
Y'all can keep them disses, jealousy's a weak decision
My presence is better than any gift underneath the Christmas tree
Picture me I used to solicit weed
In the street where nigga's bleed like Gaddafi in Tripoli
Word to Trigger Squeeze, so before you nigga's leave
Kiss your seed on the cheek and tell em' don't be good be great

[Hook]
Don't be good be great
Don't be good be great
Don't be good be great
Don't be good be great

[Verse 2]
The agenda, turn sinners to winners
Then give ‘em to sinners, the chance is slimmer
Than Erica Mena, we're dead in the center
Or being dead in the glimmer, Trey wrestling with Zimmer
Trying to bring bread in for dinner
So never surrender to mediocracy
And all these haters within this evil society
Who obviously hate to remember
When I would rhyme with the Glock on me
Wait in the rental, a lot of fights, a lot of robberies
I wasn’t injured when the pussy niggas shot at me
So i so Solemnly swear the flow pottery
This is Scarface mixed the old Prodigy
So don't bother me, you can keep your apologies
I mean that whole heartedly I'm my own sovereignty
I always say I can, fuck your T and your apostrophe
And people who put quantity over quality
Cuz' my dad always says Cydel don't be good be great

[Hook]
Don't be good be great
Don't be good be great
Don't be good be great
Don't be good be great[Verse 1]
I just want to be a legend before I D I E
Niggas say they want to smoke me like the tree I chief
In my C I G, like B I G
Your own people hate you more than the P I G’s
Throwing money in the club, screaming T I G
Made ten bands on the G I G
What you tryna do shawty I done D I D
I’m just doing this rap shit to try and feed my niece
Fair east side, where I reside
My niggas butchers cause it’s hard to let the beef slide
Grew up in the church but don’t think that I ain’t street wise
End up in the trunk with your hands and your feet tied
Speak my mind, I was never one of those meek guys
Been a leader since knee high
All the freaks used to treat me like a Greek god
Had a chick at Dunwoody, bad bitch at Creekside

[Hook]
If you don’t believe
I was the coolest nigga on my street
If you don’t believe
You can ask all the hustlers, you can ask the freaks
If you don’t believe
If you don’t believe
You never know what you can achieve

[Verse 2]
All I need is hope, but I never got a scholarship
All I ever got was a pistol and some hollow tips
Huh, a few pounds and a lot of whips
Could’ve sold dope but that wasn’t my prerogative
I was more positive, tryna stay out of jail
Wild little niggas, oh we gave the cops hell
Rides [?] Scotsdale, I was making pot sales
Killed the fruit on my like cocktails
I do this for my nigga Greg cause he never got bailed
Real goon put a hot shell in your [?]
No joke, I ain’t Jerry Seinfeld
The only reason I ain’t in the street is cause I rhyme well
I just want a chariot and two Clydesdales [?]
And an outfit from YSL
Tryna do something that most people that try failed
But you never make it if you

[Hook]

[Outro - MLK]
I come here tonight and plead with you. Believe in yourself and believe that you’re somebody. As I said to a group last night, nobody else can do this for us! No document can do this for us. No Lincolnian Emancipation Proclamation can do this for us. No Kennesonian or Johnsonian Civil Rights Bill can do this for us. If the Negro is to be free, he must move down into the inner resources of his own soul and sign with a pen and ink of self-assertive manhood, his own Emancipation Proclamation![Kanye West]
Uh, G.O.O.D. Music, this our year
Backing drums by DJ Premier
Now let me count it down, who the fuck up in here?
Common, Don, Old G, battle rap, oh
Y'all niggas know you can’t really fuck with that
Pusha T, the Clipse just made a classic
Good music together we too Jurassic, you stay plastic
Ramadan with the flow, guaranteed everybody fasting
Big Sean is a don
CyHi Da Prynce
Why you so nervous dog stop being tense
If you ain't talking bout Rash we ain't got nothing in common
Fuck that and that's just common sense what the

Came in the game, 8 years prior
8 years later, your mans on fire
My Book of Eli, to all my subscribers
Play the two doors, street car named desire
Came in Grindin’, Ye’ came through the wire
Met at the crossroads, Bone Thugs inspired
1st of the month, Trump to the buyers
Red toupee on the coupe you been fired
Smooth criminal, no prior’s
Man in the mirror, check no liar
Still let that butter fly like Mariah
Show me the money the black Jerry McGuire
Tom Cruise on that couch if that money right
West Hollywood feels like a bunny night
With GOOD company and better jewelers
To the Good Life, we GOOD music

[Big Sean]
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day’s a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I’m pressed clean
Detroit’s angel, I even got red wings
I’m headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life’s prom night and guess who’s the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I’m Don King
Everybody know I’m coming soon like LeBron’s ring
I’m Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter, Sean Combs and Connery all in one
Whoever told you sky’s the limit is looking dumb
Cause I’m 22 and I’m moonwalking on the sun
Oh thats your girl?
She feelin on my whoo there right next to a couple boaters
And she tryna motor boat her and im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor
You might find banana clips ’cause it’s Guerilla warfare
Last year I was watching this from the couch and now I’m here
Thats to let you know what I’m about
Reaper black suit cuz my whole team’s killin'
Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin'
Many tell me I’m the man I ain't made it yet
Tell me who the baddest, I’ll see if I see them naked yet
Won’t stop til I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet

[Cyhi Da Prince]
I’m Mr. Got Bread like Quizno’s
Better known as MJ with the big nose
I swear your artist couldn’t see me on his tip toes
Only on TV I gotta take a quick pose
Let me stop I forgot this was a big show
If being dope made you broke I am piss poor
I’m big poppa plus I’m 2pacalypto
My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for?
Huh, I’m doing this for hip hop
I'm coming after you, him and his spot!
Still tied to the streets like a fish knot
Ain't nothing fake, I’m not a Rolly with a tick tock
Atlanta repper in the home of the yankee
Rosewood suit on with the hanky
I got rich from the zones of the stanky
So everybody know my money long, lanky!
So I’m flexible stretching out my decimals
Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles
Can’t bleep it out cuz there wasn’t nothing sexual
I’m blowing loud, somebody check the decibels
I’m impeccable they put me on the pedestal
And if you bite me, it’s good for you like a vegetable
Shows by the several, schedule full of festivals
And if I ever do time than you know its federal
Uh, incredible, yeah

[Common]
F-f-f-fam fam fam I’ma monster too
You don’t see I do things that the monsters do
The incomparable, remarkable, articles
About my audible technique, my technique
I recognize game like the ESPY’s
Cold to myself I say "God bless me" the truth
So I speak live and directly
You, I will set free my mic is where my check be
Rah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro
Prolly in the metro just so I can get dough
The name is Common but the frame is special
Leave requested from the years I’ve invested
Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope
The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley
Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly

[Kanye West]
The plan was to drink till the pain over
What’s worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake shit, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the world
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God asked Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visitin around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain't finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul
Rosewood we could see her with our eyes closed[Verse 1:CeeJ]

Quit all the mushy talk
These pussies looking up to me, bitch I'm a rookie boss
I take an L to the face but I never took a loss
I swear I work for the paper, I never took 'em off
Days (Daze), it's like they in a haze, they stuck on my name
Shit I'm quick-witted, this Brick City jungle I BANG
Looking for 6 figure digits man I'm stuck in my ways
Puffing away, thinking of ways I can double my gains
Which of you made(maid) niggas gonna uncover my fame
Cause all you lame hoes flows just puzzle my brain
Ever since I came up in the door I been fucking the game
But now I love her she get some of every rubber I bring
But first thing that's gon' come?...The Prenup
1-5-0's a little bit hard to re-up
Snotty ass nose a little bit hard to clean up
I'm tryna get to the mill with more than 50 to kill, and still
We chillin' on a whole 160
Me and three of my niggas got a 40, hella tipsy
You boys coming out for my fame, nigga don't tempt me
Y'all bored (board) and y'all think this a game? That's hella Risky
I'm taking Christine, we going to Tiffany's
And we ain't buying jewelry, 2 bitches with me
I guess it's S&M when they impressed with the Benz
I just sit in the back, 2 bitches whip me

And this is how its going down
Yezzir
Its like....
Bang
It's like
Bang, Bang

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
CyHi the Prynce, fresh up out the Ivy League
Nigga I'm the bomb, bitches call me IED
Probably cause I'm covered in all this I-C-E
I asked her can I fuck, she said Y-E-P
I'm blowing up like C4
Overseas tours, man I used to be poor
Sound like grenades every time I record
All I do is drop bombs, Marine Corps

[Verse 3: CeeJ]
Getting paid is keeping me on
So I can look her in the face, believe in me Moms
I just hit the same fucking stage Khalifa was on
And Hunger Pains got a shot, the heat in my palms
How can I see Miami beaches, the heat and the palms
Short spring break, lavish life for a week and I'm gone
Man I'm a king, every morning I beat the alarm
How I look shaking off a loss, this ain't Vietnam
Whoo man
My castle and you only act a fool man
And shit since I been on my grind like the school dance
Every weekend we peeking, they in love with the crew man
And I'm the crew chief, shit, we need a full tank
It's sad but rapping gon' get me money that school ain't
It's kind of backwards to me it seems like a cruel prank
But fuck it, I just roll up the good dank
Lighter in my hand, I'll ignite it for the FAM
Nigga what?

And this is how its going down
Yezzir
Its like....
Bang
It's like
Bang, Bang[Hook x4]
You can get fucked, big head bitches

[Verse 1]
Yea that bitch fine and all
But she a headache with no Tylenol
I done hung up on some hoes y'all niggas been dying to call
Got a record label full of bitches nigga don't make me sign yo broad
I told her I give her the world, if she take off her clothes
So I went to Office Depot and bought that bitch a globe
Girl I wonder where you'll be when I turn 64
You'll probably still be selling pussy, and I'll be rich and old
Soo, you need to change yo attitude
Cause my worst bitch as bad as you
So get on this bed and get latitude
Come see what this pillow top mattress do
And yo pussy better smell like passion fruit
And when you see me in the streets, don't be acting rude
Cause I'm Alaskan cool, I'll ride by you like Baton Rouge
But I can't front shawty that ass is huge
I'll still jump in that pussy bitch and act a fool cause

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
Ol' bougie ass, big ol' booty ass
The type of chick to watch a flick and talk through the movie ass
Ol' choosy ass, Ruby Tuesday ass
I would never house a ho, that's Doogie ass
It's truly sad, we call you to thrab
The waitress said "What would you like to eat" she said "I'll do the crab"
Her plate was 70 bucks, we can all do the math
I got 30 dollars left, I'm calling you a cab
So she can't say I ain't keep it 100
Chieffin' on chronic, I don't skeet in hoes stomachs
I just keep these hoes coming
I got Polo on in England, cause I'm meetin' the Lauren London
I get red kisses, leave they legs twitching
Cause of curiosity, left her with a dead kitten
This song is dedicated to the big head bitches
Cause y'all remind me of my dick head bitches

[Hook x8]
