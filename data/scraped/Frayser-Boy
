I'm getting full of drank leanin movin slow seeming
Unda the influence will make you fall asleep dreaming

Yea I know these suckas on the town gotta hate me
Doin real big and my system full of that promethazine
Have you kinda dumb sayin thangs that you don't really mean
Messin wit that gallon too have me scratching for a itch
Fill my cup to the brim over ice pourin it
2 Liters of that purple potion bout to ball out
Pints after pints, woah I think I'm bout to fall out
Frayser bizzle slummed out in the bay
Getting leaner addicted to this medicine
Yo I'm just admitting it

[Hook]

[Mike Jones]
I keep purple stuff all in my cup 84's when I'm rollin up
Big faces I'm folding up diamond shine from princess cuts
Down south we sip that lean ride candy cars wit drop out screens
Wit screwed music up in my deck texas boys finna get repect
I'm Mike Jones (Mike Jones) wit purple stuff in my styrofoam
From H Town to Memphis 10 I'm hittin licks on my wireless phone
281-3-3-oh, eight-zero-zero-fo'
You need the drank let me know and Mike Jones will have it at yo do'
I'm feelin good I'm feelin great just had a 4th and a sip of eight
I'm holdin it down "down south" representing that texas state [Repeat]
I'm Mike Jones I know you know my name
But pretty soon y'all gon know about this purple drank
Once that Codeine hits your system it gon make you lean
Another fiend compliments of promethazine

[Hook]

(Paul Wall - "lets see you po it up. swishahouse, paul wall baby")

(Juicy J)
There's a freak in north Memphis that rollin' & smokin' goodie
She toss a 380, I hate it because she hoodie
Her wreckin' be a dog, a hog, or just a bully
It's cool if she be down to clown, cause she'll pull it
Don't underestimate her face, she ain't a rookie
And when she get in deep and deep, the ho be trippin'
A gangsta type bitch that make ya say (oowwee!)
She lick my balls, ba-ba balls, I banged and freaked her pussy

(Frayser Boy)
Now I'm drankin' on this cortisone that's gots me feelin' frisky
Lookin' fo a freaky ho to suck up on my dicky
Needs a pro, and not an amateur so I come licky
Number one drop flick and sucks the dick to end this quickly
Sucks me dumb, and gots me sprung, and leaves it wit a hickey
If you gots the bitch then I don't know he's coming? fit me (frayser boy)
If you lookin' fo the ho, don't bother cause she's wit me
The bitch was born to use her tongue, he nigga's name was Vicky

Chorus (8x)

(La Chat)
A head huntin' bitch that's on a mission, lookin' for the head
For that pussy suckin' motherfucker slobbin' in my legs (wassuuuppp!)
Cause we buck, now know we ain't gon fuck
You gon put your face in face and work yo tongue until I nut
Bitch nigga, yeah you love it when I treat you like a ho
Man these niggas claimin' pimpin' is these niggas that'll go
First time? Boy whatever, so you listed a beginner

Break yo knees, keep it real, c'mon do that thang you do
All you niggas eatin' pussy Chat got notin' but love fo you
Don't be shame you a man, you supposed to please a bitch
If you want it drippin' wet you gotta lick it fo you hit
Camera ready in the closet, lights, camera, action

Man you out the frame, man you lickin' in the right spot
You gon be my man, fuck that shit I'm puttin' yo cap on lock

Chorus (8x)[Chorus]
I neva ran from a motherfuckin ho and neva will
I neva wave a white flag in a boat and neva will
I neva bow down to a fuckin sucka and neva will
I neva snitched or cross a real motherfuker and neva will
Who thank they bucker than these boys here not nan notha
Who thank they bucker than these bitches here not nan notha
Who got more money than these boys here not nan notha
Who got more mobey than these bitches here not nan notha

[Frayser Boy]
I keep my brain on some change
Some change on my brain
Picture its gon mean the same thang
Yea a playa maintain neva go against the grain
Known to bring pain in the Bay where I hang
Haters jumpin on the band wagon better thank twice
We put the Bay on the map thank Me thank Wyte
Boyz see me in the streets and they wanna act hard
Young cowards ain't gon bust a grape gon run backyard
Keep a tone arm reach for these streets that I mob
Not to do a nigga in is a everyday job
Dont stunt get mob talk shit get rob
Smack a ho yo cross her head for yo dope problem solved
Can't blame us
Cause we famous
And we came up
Neva change up
Keep it gangsta
Doin our thang bro keep rollin on its gone be danger

[Chorus]

[Frayser Boy]
Imma Frayser representative better known as the Bay
Ride wit Paul and Juicy man fuck wit you hoes say
Click tight get right everywhere the Bay go
If you got some problems when we mobbing betta lay low
Believe cause I say so
Grimmin like Play-Do
Hypnotize minds on the grind don't play ho
Rearrangin the game
But still remainin the same
Plus my money escaladin ain't no changing me man
Now I'm gainin the fame the top I'm aimmin my aim
Lock me up in jail but no restrainin my brain
Beginning to the end
If theres foes theres friends
Yea I started as a rookie turn pro at the end
Keep it goin like trends
Dont be speakin on my name boy you know we ain't friends
Born losers don't win
Can't see it like wind
And I'm posted in the Bay all day toss Ten

[Chorus]

[D.J. Paul]
I rap and crush buildings in the south I'm King Kong
I brought a knife to a gun fight and I stilll won
I was battling some fags that like to brag and run they mouth quick
But everything he rap about heaint even got the shit
People think they defeat you with washed up hypnotize artists
That they click can become platinum artists
Cut the foolin run clown keep them drugs in yo pocket
Cause if they need some decent work they be still on my block

[Juicy J]
You cowards can't fuck with the juice flow you know juice know
That you boys claiming you hardcore but you all hoes
Braggin bout war stories boy that shit old
Playa times changing everyday bodies left cold
On the grass or the concrete you know I see
Dont you come round claimin tought when you scary
I don't care what kinda game you in wuss or wanna be
Or a maida for Osa Bin it don phase me

[Chorus][Juicy J]
Frayser man tell these niggas how it was in the Bay

[Verse One]
Comin up I was told to take what a nigga need
Niggas say lets rob a nigga blind, and dammit i'd agree
Learned from the best Green Bry way back in the day
In the Bay saw a nigga get jacked for his jacket
It all started when my cousin put a gun up in my hand
Already had some sticky fingers, time to rob a man
Doin dirt since a young cat, you name it probably done that
You let me in your house a day later a nigga come back
Get the mask, get the Glock, haulin' ass to your block
Stuntin a little to much my nigga got me mobbin to your spot
Wrong place at the wrong time, incidently cost
Got on Jordans size 12,  nigga I'm like take em' off
Kick a door off the hinge, house call, comin' in
Got a cocksucka' dope and his dividends
Ain't no friends in this fucking game that we call life
Wear your Cartier to the Club better think twice

[Chorus]
So I'm fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
Fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
I gotta touch'em
I gotta touch'em
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to Get'm Get'm Get'm Get'm

[Verse Two]
I see my victims, I gotta get him, I gotta stick him
How could I miss a chili which what made me pick him
Roley on his wrist, shoes on his whip, got me scoopin'
Gotta catch his ass all alone is what I'm hoping
Got that fuckin Glock, got it fuckin cocked, thats fo sho
In about a minute he gon' find me kickin in his door
Trail his ass home, in my hand the chrome, about to stain
If he give me static, automatic take him out the game
Pull up at his home and he all alone, Jackpot
Saw him grab his pistol out his muthafuckin stash spot
Crept up behind to commit the Crime, drop the gat
Fore' I blow your ass off, put one threw your Gucci hat
Picked up the tone, now its fuckin on, robbed him blind
Didn't know that night, he'd be the victim of a fuckin crime
Took all his cash, stashed on his ass, Nah nah
Now that a nigga can fit, my description, he can't stay alive

[Chorus]
So I'm fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
Fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
I gotta touch'em
I gotta touch'em
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to Get'm Get'm Get'm Get'mCome on man quit playin man I need to be swallowed

But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it
She swallowed it
But she say she never did it

[Frayser Boy]
Now if you know Frayser Boy
You know I love to get my dick sucked
I rather lay back get some chewin
Then I'd rather fuck
I know this ho, she always flodgin like she never did it
Every new niggas she's with she's actin like she's never with it
Now you know I know the biz
I know the way the bitch is
This ho can suck a dick and swallow till it brings tears
My nigga already told me the biz, about this bitch
She swallow nut, take it up the butt and don't snitch
She didn't want the information to leak out to niggas
That she eats dick and swallows and you can take some pictures
But one day I caught the ho all alone at the store
I got up on her but she got no clue bout what I know
We exchanged numbers, but in her mind she wonders
Do he know that I could suck a dick up like a plunger
Yeah ho, Frayser Beasy no the fuckin score
You tryin to act all sedity, knowin that you a ho

[Hook]
She swallowed it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it
She swallowed it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it

[Frayser Boy]
A couple of days went by so I hit the ho up on the phone
Ask her could I come and see her while she chillin at her home
She said cool, so I'm mobbin to her fuckin crib
I wanted to ask the bitch do she want me to bring her a bib
Cause I know she finna suck dick thats for sho
Thirty minutes went by, now I'm knockin at her door
She let me in then she went and layed back on the couch
Told me to come sit by her, I guess to put dick in her mouth
We chilled for a minute, watched a little T.V
I'm yawin and stretchin, I'm tryin to make sure that she see me
Before you know she got the rubbin and feelin and uhh..
I hoping that she got some sexual healin so uhh..
She grabbed my pants all you heard was an unzip
She took the dick up out and she rubbed it gentle cross her lips
I had moves set not knowin that she followed them
I'm bout to blow of my god the bitch swallowed it

[Hook]
She swallowed it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it
She swallowed it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it
She swallowed it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it
She swallowed it
But she say she never did it
But she say she never did it

Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad
Don't let me run up on yo ass and you end up in the past

I know this nigga and he always be talking that bullshit
But little do he know he gon suffer a wig split
Like fucking with the realest the illest will fucking kill him
A straight up headbuster and also a real nigga
There's gon be consequences so niggas just run in here
I'm unloading the tone and popping an extra clip
A bitch nigga talking is something I can't stand
Or every last will pick up the mess that's gonna land
The I.V.'s in his arm the bullets up in his chest
His shop about to close he shoulda had on a vest
Don't fuck with me nigga that's something I have to stress
Keep talking shit boy your gonna end up with one less
I'm out the Bay nigga that's something you gonna respect
And stay out of my business before you feel the Tech
Don't give a shit bout you I treat you like my ho
Gon wake up one night and I'm kicking up in your door ho

Chorus 2x

When I buck em, touch em, fuck em, now you clutching laying down
Got you ducking muthafucker, turn that smile to a frown
I will pop em, drop em, bullets launching, resting all up in your chest
I'm guessing letting bullets wet ya
Shoulda been drenched down in vest ho that's fasho
I'm most definitely bringing pain to you niggas
Like some bitches when I step up in this thang
All you niggas do is gossip like some lil' hoes
You might as well go down to the Shake Junt and slide down poles
Now you running while I'm gunning
Stomping hoping to get close to some shelter
Better catch up with some polices, hope that they can help ya
Help to ? you just better get some younger quick and fast
I'm holding the match and your body's drenching down with gas
Got the tone to ya head yo life flashing right front your eyes
Blow yo ass off  ??????????
Me and Project Pat toting gats we do this for sport
Have you made lights, camera, action on the news report

Chorus 2x

[Project Pat]
Now fuck this goddamn talking
Make you bitches bring the pain
Catch yo ho ass walking stick a tone to ya brain
You insane if ya think I'ma still let ya breathe
I got Anna on my chest with some tricks up my sleeve
I'ma blast on ya ho give a damn who was looking
Blow the top off your skull then your life has been tooken
You was cooking up a scheme tryna put me in the beam
But the jokes on you jack slapped his ass with the gat
Beat 'em down to the pavement squealing like a pig
My nigga I don't save 'em beat em like a bitch
Ain't nobody tryna help ya, what they finna do
Hollow lead's gonna melt up, you and your crew

And watch this 38 slug blow your back out
Bout to bust on you boys shoot you till you dead
I love playing with them toys pocket full of leadBay area, bay area... (repeat till frayser boy starts)

[Frayser Boy]
Allow me to introduce myself two tenty one seventy six
Busted out my mama's womb, the haters havin a fit
The birth of a frayser boy is now on the fuckin scene
Raised in the Brier ain't too many things I ain't seen
Bay is in my blood, I came up around them real niggas
Niggas on the run, got feds watchin and takin pictures
Hooked up wit them thugs thats hypnotizin yo' minds
Good lookin out paul and juicy, now I'm back on this grind
Ain't no stoppin this time, because the sky is the limit
And I'mma stay loyal to my dawgs, till the day that I finish
You know this race I'mma win it and much love to the bay
And all them niggas I fucked wit then, I fuck wit today
So this yo' dawg comin at ya, so haters dont ya start
If you wit me you can catch me robbin frayser boulevard
Gone on that bay, dont you play, this is where I'm gonna stay
Found my home H.C.P. no longer a fuckin stray, dont play

Bay area, ain't love fo, fuck you hoes we down till we die(repeat x8)

[Lil' Wyte]
This the verse they gonna show you right off the wamb I throw them thumbs
H.c.p. w-y-t-e frayser B bay we be droppin bombs
Watch-the-fuck-out, here we come(pop! pop! pop!)ya'll can't get none
All of a sudden this long haired green eyed faggot tryin to get him some
Let me let ya in on a little bittty secret I could lyrically toast ya
Plus I'm from the bay that explains my reactions like a vulture
Quickly find ya, sniff ya out, now matter how far you mite be
Strong aroma, pass is over, all the air the bay I breath
That got me places, call me crazy, somehow I done fuckin made it
So mo' in my verse weak then you did it 3 months I know you hate it
Watch me rise up to the top because my hood has put me here
Sometimes I feel some parts of the bay got its own atmosphere
Haters, hustlas, rappers, real-ass-niggas, rednecks, and fuckin queers
Chokin doja, watchin po'po's ride by while they throw a beer
Yeah its kind of hectic in my neck of the woods but respect it
Life is so damn gravy in the bay for me you had to check it(BIITCH!)

And tell that ho (Don't violate me ho, don't violate) [x4]

[DJ Paul]
Now niggas man they try to copy the Three 6 but they too sloppy
You boys is fakers, nothin' but carbon copies
When we step up in the club, niggas they play dead
Cause of raps and all that bullshit that they said
It ain't nothin behind your mugs but some motherfuckin' hugs
Y'all niggas nicer than grandmas and fuckin' ladybugs
Yall haters shakin' like booties up in a strip club
I'll cut your head off like Al Queda in this bitch WHAT!

[Juicy J]
I ain't playin' wit' you niggas
I'll put my hands on you niggas
My foot will stand on you niggas
I thought you knew we pull triggers
So why you testin' me bitches
You must be tryin' to get stitches
All on your forehead, you're cold dead
For fuckin' wit' pimpin'
I'll take the back of a gun
Hit you, you startin' to run
Split you wit' two fuckin' halves
You mad runnin' your tongue
I ain't no ho that be likin'

Tacklin' and bringin' the lightnin' bitch!

[Hook]

Yea' I do it big, shit I'm playin' wit' your sister

[Frayser Boy]
Pick his ass up, drop him off on his last breath
Fuckin' wit' the hypnotize, you gon' have a fast death

Three 6 got me on now I got to keep a tone

[Hook]Chorus (8x): Gimme head till I'm dead, gimme head, gimme head

(Juicy J)
There's a freak in north Memphis that rollin' & smokin' goodie
She toss a 380, I hate it because she hoodie
Her wreckin' be a dog, a hog, or just a bully
It's cool if she be down to clown, cause she'll pull it
Don't underestimate her face, she ain't a rookie
And when she get in deep and deep, the ho be trippin'
A gangsta type bitch that make ya say (oowwee!)
She lick my balls, ba-ba balls, I banged and freaked her pussy

(Frayser Boy)
Now I'm drankin' on this cortisone that's gots me feelin' frisky
Lookin' fo a freaky ho to suck up on my dicky
Needs a pro, and not an amateur so I come licky
Number one drop flick and sucks the dick to end this quickly
Sucks me dumb, and gots me sprung, and leaves it wit a hickey
If you gots the bitch then I don't know he's coming? fit me (frayser boy)
If you lookin' fo the ho, don't bother cause she's wit me
The bitch was born to use her tongue, he nigga's name was Vicky

Chorus (8x)

(La Chat)
A head huntin' bitch that's on a mission, lookin' for the head

You gon put your face in face and work yo tongue until I nut
Bitch nigga, yeah you love it when I treat you like a ho
Man these niggas claimin' pimpin' is these niggas that'll go

All you niggas eatin' pussy Chat got notin' but love fo you
Don't be shame you a man, you supposed to please a bitch
If you want it drippin' wet you gotta lick it fo you hit
Camera ready in the closet, lights, camera, action

Man you out the frame, man you lickin' in the right spot
You gon be my man, fuck that shit I'm puttin' yo cap on lock

Chorus (8x)[Frayser Boy]
For the dro, comin' through the doe
Got it 'bout to click bitch
Used to fuck with you tough, now you on my shitlist
Frayser Boy, keep it on the low
Reap it then you sow
Yeah that 40 nickel close
Nigga keep it for a ho
Games played, lames sprayed
Fuckin' with the six, ho
Find out where you live
Cause it's time to pull a kickdoe
Snatch your pussy ass out your sleep
I'm a nightmare
Threw your ass in with the stand
Leave it right there

[Lil Wyte]
I really think you lost your wind
I'm like goddamn, this'll make you snatch up out your care
This Lil Wyte the motherfucking cracker from the camp, yeah
I hold it down where I am from
Or hit the corner, blow them crumbs
A psychopathic lyrical lunatic
And my gauge has to thump
Fuck you motherfuckers, I'm not going, I'm too smart for that
Me and Cruncy Black creeping somewhere dressed in all black and strapped
You wanna test the 6, Frayser Boy or even Project Pat
Whether or not I say your name you know where this missile's landing at
Say something else

[Lord Infamous]
Whoever wish to diss Three 6, I'll massacre your ass
If you live, creep up to your wheelchair, rip out your shitbag
Bitches bark like pitbulls but bite like poodles
Talk that shit in person, Red Dragon cook your noodles
15 years, Lord's a microphone fiend
Like Michael Myers bitch, my anniversary is Halloween
And I'm deeply into voodoo
Cut out your tongue and mute you
Wear three vests and it's STILL goin' through you

[Juicy J]
To be just like me I must start confessin'
18 years of work and prayin' and God's blessing
Raised, a ghetto child, North Memphis and that's a fact
I walked them car lots, pay cash for Maybach
It's easy to see bullshit I ain't wiiit'
Haters talkin' shit 'bout HCP cliiick
And nobody produced producers that God made
Hard on them beats and yes we is paiiid

[DJ Paul]
It's HCP nigga what the fuck you think
We pop hydro shocks and you be shootin' blanks
I got four full clips, you on a quarter of a tank
We bust like nuts on a porno tape
I'mma hit you from the rooter to the tooter
With this automatic shooter
Whatever part I hit, best believe it's goin' through ya
Shootouts for whole days
24 hours long
We been in battles for real
Y'all just making songs 'bout it

[Boogiemane]
I'm the Boogiemane bitch
Ain't no ho in my blood
It's plenty much love givin'
So I'm bringin' them slugs
And dumpin', frankly I've been sick of all these bullshit games
I'm the type, the first nigga out bringin' the pain
And gon' make sure that his ho ass losin' his life
4,5,6 shots, motherfucker surprise!
Gonna be the only motherfuckers left in this bitch
For when we mob out nigga you'll be locked down, bitch!

[Crunchy Black]
I am the main one, cut 'em up in chunks
You would rather mess wit' a faggot than mess wit' me punk
See it's one the hard way, in case you heard
I'mma send you a word 'bout a lil' bitty bird
Let me let you know somethin' see it's time's out for talkin'
Go on a blind date and meet the yawkin'
It's hard hittin' niggas don't wanna see you stalkin'
Your body on the ground outlined wit' chalkin'

[Chrome]
Violate Lil' Chrome aka Corleone
Niggas gon' need stitches just to make it back home
And I say what I mean and I mean what I say
Some Looney Tune rappers, you ain't the hardest where I stay
I never bite my tongue, you will get knocked out
Frayser, Wyte and Chrome, we the truth in the South
Hit your mouth, we really really bring 'em out
HCP bitch, put the barrel in your mouth

[Frayser Boy]
Gone like what happened?
Must have been the drugs
And them haters nuts pumped
Nigga hater put a slug in her mama
Keep it gutter in the field where I come from
Had a few minor scratches and scrapes but I'm unharmed
Y'all actin' like a ho wit' a big old wet pussy
HCP, ain't a nigga I'mma let push me
Sayin' what I feel cause I'm real
Cause it is what it is
Homie we could handle this
Cause it's real where I live
HCP nigga![Intro - Juicy J]

[Hook]

Couple a months a nigga be flippin
And you always see me glistenin
Window down bumpin system
Some of these cowards out here hatin
Keep on hatin cause I ain't finished
Just a nigga from the hood
Tryin to keep it to the good
Where them gangs run the street
And they push them Cadillac woods
And them fellas on parole
Wan to keep they pockets swole
But we gotta trust in GOD
He the one to save our soul
From these crooked ass cops
That be rollin down our block mane
Tryin to flip dis change
But they fuckin up my stock mane
Baby need sum shoes
And my broad needs a weave
But I can't work no job
So I'm out hurr smokin weed
And I gotta keep on hustlin
Cause a nigga gotta eat
You can find me at the candy lady
Slangin packs of P
Minimum wage $5.50
And they wonderin why we deal
Why niggas always stressin
Drinkin liquor
Poppin pill

I'm still real nigga, ain't nothin' changed
I'm in the Ville witcha, ain't nothin' changed
You know I won't stop, ain't nothin' changed
Until I'm on top, ain't nothin' changed
I'm fuckin with the boys, ain't nothin' changed
You know we makin' noise, ain't nothin' changed
I'm bout getting more, ain't nothin' changed
I hafta let'em know, ain't nothin' changed

[First Verse]
Nigga, ain't nothing changed but my age
But I'm still gangsta, I ain't changed in my ways
I'll take the charge for everything that I say
Fuck these niggas cuz they talking sideways
If a nigga really wanna think that I changed
Come to the Bay, young nigga, where I hang
Niggas smoke weed, sip drank, and all that
If that ain't gutter, then what do ya call that?
I stay grindin all the time to get more
Ain't gonna stop til I'm sittin on big dough
Paul and Juicy J snatched a nigga in Frayser
Now a nigga on, bunch of these niggas is haters
HCP, tryna get my shine on
Lot of these niggas, I gotta keep from firing on
But I gotta chill, stay away from the dumb shit
Let them kill themselves, sit back and become rich
Ya dig?

[Chorus]
I'm still real nigga, ain't nothin' changed
I'm in the Ville witcha, ain't nothin' changed
You know I won't stop, ain't nothin' changed
Until I'm on top, ain't nothin' changed
I'm fuckin with the boys, ain't nothin' changed
You know we makin' noise, ain't nothin' changed
I'm bout getting more, ain't nothin' changed
I hafta let'em know, ain't nothin' changed

[Second Verse]
Yeah, I know you still feel the heat from the first verse
I got something for any nigga who wanna squirt first
And I ain't playing games, and I ain't saying names
Cuz that's for anyone of you bitches, that's on everything
I try to keep the peace, but I ain't kissing ass
I roll with killas, drug dealers, you'll get missing fast
I ride with Three-Six, there's not a nann nother
Them niggas put me on, I love 'em like brothers
Them niggas got me out the hood like whatever though
They kept me out a lot of shit that you will never know
I picked another route, I chose the rap game
I'm like minus all the stuntin, I just stack change
I try to think smart and try to stay ahead
But bro, my family or my kid, you don't play with that
So if you wanna plot, I'm gon leave you with this
I ain't gotta be around when you get hit

[Chorus](After Break the Law mix)

(Frayser Boy)
Ima gun wavin' miss behavin' what you wanna do my nigga
Pulley nigga, trilly a nigga, when I'm pullin on the trigga'
Get the clip, stick the clip
Cock about one in the chamber
Aim that Bitch, Stain that Bitch
Now your lifes in fuckin danger
Brangin it and slangin it just like the crews I'm hangin it
I gotta fuckin Glock up in my draws and maintainin it
Frayser beezy off the heezy, holla if you fuckin needs me
Blow a niggas ass off, have him on his hands and kneezy

(DJ Paul)
Don't get it wrong, it's Blackhaven's own
We too black we too strong
A nigga get warm a nigga get gone
We got some big tones, its bout to get ugly
Dont fuck around with Triple less your body gets bubbly
We gettin hated on by niggas wit two dollars to two million
Forty million man to 100 zillion
I guess its cause we got them cars, for real they lyin about it
Im cuttin . . .  for real he just rap about itH C P what I'm reppin mane
If you ain't bout that better get the stepping mane
H C P what I'm reppin mane
If you ain't bout that betta get the stepping mane
H C P what I'm reppin mane
If you ain't bout that betta get the stepping mane
H C P what I'm reppin mane
If you ain't bout that betta get the stepping mane

[Verse 1]
Now I'm a tell you off top shit gone get a little drastic
Frayser come around its a wrap like plastic
Never punked out or pushed around like a basket
Keep yo lips zipped or you'll be next wit yo ass kick
Make it stick and move in and out like mash it
Handle that get the check, hit the bank, cash it
Niggas talking shit don't you get you ass blasted
Fuckin wit the bay could be deadly like acid
Laws come around them I'm poof like magic
Gone in 60 seconds now I'm breathing like a addict
Keep a tone close just in case I got some static
Nigga in the north ended up kinda tragic
Ridin home drunk in the car bout to crash it
Them folks took my license now I'm parked like Jurassic
Sittin [?] out so you know a nigga had it
Pick her up hit the room bang got her matted

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
If you got a closed mouth then you don't get fed
If you don't ask for chewin then you don't get head
You a real gangsta nigga then you don't get scared
Off you ass young nigga or you don't get bread

I wake up to a blunt got to sleep a blunt
Keep a tone in the car in the house is the pump
Bitch niggas get stomped it's the pumpkin head month
That got me looking for you like a Easter egg hunt
Got no love for you chumps real niggas don't front
Gotcha mug on me fellin Froggy then jump
Don't end up in the trunk cause you heard a lotta funk
Frayser boy bring the pain like [?]
Need an entourage every fuckin where you go
Cause you no when you alone you a flat foot
Ho pop pop da trunk hit the pump I'm headed on a fuckin mission
Time to ride lets go hide devour all my competition
Im bout to handle that im, bout to get the gat
Broke down on you once nigga you remember
That been drankin all night been smoking all day
So when you when you so fuck up my nigga this is kinda [?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I been doin this since Moby dick was a gold fish ho
Time a let her hold somthin bitch hold this
In her hand is a fat dick she stuck like a magnet
You already knew the answer ho before you ask it
Break a ho to the flow use the pimp tactic
Tricken all the time got you blind like a bat bitch
Money getting slim so its time to black mask it
I know this dumb nigga keep his do in the mattress
Appreciate things acting like I never had shit
Fetty getting short make the stretch like elastic
Take a couple hits off the blunt then pass it
Smoke so much green niggas call me Saint Patrick
On the phone wit this ho she say that she a bad bitch
My nigga hooked me up I never seen her but I'm matted
Pullin up I got her mind blown like a gasket
A ten on the phone but when you see her she a fat bitch

[Chorus][Frayser Boy]
Yeah, you got Frayser Boy up in this thang
With the King of Memphis, and my dog the Juice Man
And I got something for my niggas flickin on them 20's
21's, 2's, 3's, 4's and even got something for my limited edition niggas
On them 25's, keep that chrome flickin' baby

When you see me rollin some chrome, you know I'm flickin
Dropped low on 24's you know I'm flickin
When you see me hollerin at hoes, you know I'm flickin
Everytime I bust on the slab, I'm gon' be flickin

A Nigga flickin, I'm so tickin, when I mob down your street
Ain't no forgettin, no bullshittin, on my lap is that heat
I'm in the Bay, that gun don't play, sittin on some Giovanni's
I'm flickin by, I'm sittin up high, I'm also gettin money
See my reflection, shit gets hectic when I beat my junt up
Drinking Corona, with aroma, when I rose that blunt up
So don't you try because you high, flickin down on my little dog
I cut the real, you know the deal, I hit the gas and ball off, Boy

[DJ Paul]
My rims are big, my tires are thin, when I be on the sizzle
See something thick, wit a whick you know it's DJ Pizzle
I'm on the slab, like jumpin ground, I'm bout to grab a pissle
Ridin Pirelli's, wit big bellies, thats how HCP do
Our money's long, your money's gone, you spent it all on that ho
And sold your rims at the GM because you went love wit blow
We ridin past ya, hollerin at ya, we on 24's
Stuff on clean, real mean, blowin ounce of green you know

[Chorus]
When you see me rollin some chrome, you know I'm flickin
Dropped low on 24's you know I'm flickin
When you see me hollerin at hoes, you know I'm flickin
Everytime I bust on the slab, I'm gon' be flickin
When you see me rollin some chrome, you know I'm flickin
Dropped low on 24's you know I'm flickin
When you see me hollerin at hoes, you know I'm flickin
Got that pistol in my lap for my foes, you know I'm flickin

[DJ Paul]
Yeah, Yeah, right here we gon burn some motherfuckin rubber
In your motherfuckin hoes face, like thiss

[DJ Paul]
Around the world niggas know that HCP on
We see each other when we talk on our car phones
We smokin Bin Laden and ridin on something chrome
Them U's in our lap, never leavin'em at home
A blue Bonneville the tires are Scorpions
My rims mid-twenties some days are full grown
We Platnium on our plaques, are necks, and our arms
And we never switchin jewelry, or take clothes, we got our own

[Frayser Boy]
When you see me flickin by, I got you boys hot
Hit the D&D and flick on the lot
Sittin on some twenty-twos, and blowin up the spot
And haters don't you plot, and get yo ass shot
Because a nigga claim, its gon attract cops
Hate to see a nigga thats young and on top
The tone is in my lap and you know its on cock
Eyes poppin out yo head whenever a nigga stop

[Chorus]
When you see me rollin some chrome, you know I'm flickin
Dropped low on 24's you know I'm flickin
When you see me hollerin at hoes, you know I'm flickin
Everytime I bust on the slab, I'm gon' be flickin
When you see me rollin some chrome, you know I'm flickin
Dropped low on 24's you know I'm flickin
When you see me hollerin at hoes, you know I'm flickin
Got that pistol in my lap for my foes, you know I'm flickin

[Frayser Boy]
Niggas hollerin no way, sittin on some ho-days
Twenty-fo's on you hoes, flickin when I roll way
Hit the Bay, don't play, head down a boulevard
Lookin like some chrome ceilin fans, ima pull a card
Bout to have a heart attack when a nigga flick by
Rims they so fuckin big make a nigga sit high
Watchin for the Po Po's you know they be fuckin wit me
Hollerin at a stout little something, waitin on her to hit me
Dont forget me

[Chorus]
When you see me rollin some chrome, you know I'm flickin
Dropped low on 24's you know I'm flickin

Gimme sum, Gimme sum
Head in here you selfish pig

(La Chat)
I'm creepin up through the cut
I got the mask upon my face
I hope no one's in sight
A robbery is about to take place
La Chat, I'm out here scopin
Lookin for victims with that cheese
Whatever to make that paper, drop it off so I can hit
A bitch that's on a come up, thinkin of a ways to make a stang
A nigga that's riding twenties, bumpin out the frame
Move, that's my mane, I take the mask off my face
I'm finna pass this fool, I know he's gonna try to holler
Cause that's just what niggas do
Then bam I got him, get in the car we goin to the tel
We get into the room he stuntin, counting all his money, yea he bail
This nigga don't know what's goin down, I'm finna go and get him
He need to drop it off with no hesitation, or I'm gonna kill him
Lay down on the bed we bump-n-grind, with nothin but sex in mind
I turn him over, get on top and surprise him with my nine
I ain't ask no questions, didn't say shit
Pull the trigger straight in the head, got away with his cheese
A smooth get away, he's naked dead in bed, yea

[Chorus x 8]

(Frayser Boy)
Now when I'm comin through
I'm kickin doors off the hinges
Please believe it, best to leave it so won't be no incidents
If you wanna like a sauna nigga I'm bringin that heat
Don't you jump us, sawed pump will sweep your ass off your feet
Lay on the fuckin ground, and don't you make a sound
Or you gonna suffer till your muthafuckin body found
Nigga this shit is real, you oughta know the deal
Don't play with me cocksucka, with this pump up in your grill
So give me cooperation, and meet all my demands
With no hesitation, put that money up in my hand
Don't be flossin, bullets tossin when I see your diamond shinin
Catch your ass up in the cut, didn't know that I was behind it
I'm makin examples up out of you niggas
Who thinkin a nigga is playin wit ya
I'm buckin you suckas, I'm bringin da ruckus
I am a muthafuckin damager, don't make no swift moves
Cause you gonna lose, I give nigga blues with hard head
So don't you fuck up, and get your ass stuck
And be somewhere up in a ditch, found dead ya bitch

[Chorus x 8][DJ Paul]

And hit me with some more

[Frayser Boy]
Posted on the fuckin track

Tryin to get this fuckin money, a nigga like eatin steaks
Pistol to the head of these niggas that be actin fake
Shit is gon get real if you think about testing me

You know the game dawg, you bring it and I'm gon fuckin finish
Yeah I know your chest hurt, nigga it's a bullet in it

I'm also dodging them laws, slippin away from they paws
You better gimme respect, before you feel from Tech
We'll leave your whole body wet, with bullet hole in your neck
Leaving your dick in the dust, niggas like me you can't trust
So run 'round fuckin with us, pull back the trigger and bust
I'm out here makin this loot, quicker than a prostitute

[Frayser Boy]

Got a extra package in my draws for a nigga though
A million dollar dope track, that's what I got workin
End up on the wrong track, ho you gets a fucking hurtin
Eyes in front and in back of my head man
That's how it gots to be, if I want to maintain
Cause these ho ass niggas, they'll try to catch you fuckin slippin
So, I got that Glock and you know I'm bout to start trippin
What you gon do, when I break up that fuckin heat
It's gon be like Halloween, callin "trick-or-treat"
Frayser Boy, got a toy, will make example
Knock you down to the ground, on head I trample
Glock to your mind, and I'm pullin the trigger
Ain't takin no shit from no ho ass nigga
Whoopin ass, takin names, that's how I get down
When I come in presence, best not to make sound

[Verse 1]
Wrapped in the bay, fuck what you  say
Clique tight with, Paul and Juicy  J
They paved the way, this where I stay
I will react, stay to your place
Frayser's the name, don't fuck with lames
I'm still the same, don't fear no man
Hyp-no-tiz-ing yo' mind
We don't fuck with your kind
Bay since my birth, fuck with the real
You know the deal, get it how you live
Hand-lin' that, fuck with the gat
Don't cross me, what's up with that
Blown a-way, so don't hate
Fi-nal-ly here, gone on that bay
Tryin to get a meal, fuck how you feel
No fakin in me, I keep it real
Frayser Boulevard, is where I mob
Coming through the bay alone, you robbed
HCP tatted in blood on my arm, act a fool, left arm  harmed
All-star cast, and we'll blast
Fuck with us, you won't last
I ha-rass, check my past
Hope you understand, clear like glass
It's time to shine, money on my mind
Still on the grind, will commit to crime
Hypnotize Minds running this shit
Haters on the town, wish they was with
Light your blunts up, listen to some bump
Paul and Juicy beats, damaging your trunk
Holdin it down, for the M-town
Turning haters smiles, into some frowns

[Chorus x4]
Fuck you haters now, what you gon' do?
Bring it to the door, it's on you
Gone on that bay, thought you knew
Hypnotize Minds, oh yeah it's true[Juicy J]
Frayser man tell these niggas how it was in the Bay

[Verse One]
Comin up I was told to take what a nigga need
Niggas say lets rob a nigga blind, and dammit i'd agree
Learned from the best Green Bry way back in the day
In the Bay saw a nigga get jacked for his jacket
It all started when my cousin put a gun up in my hand
Already had some sticky fingers, time to rob a man
Doin dirt since a young cat, you name it probably done that
You let me in your house a day later a nigga come back
Get the mask, get the Glock, haulin' ass to your block
Stuntin a little to much my nigga got me mobbin to your spot
Wrong place at the wrong time, incidently cost
Got on Jordans size 12, nigga I'm like take em' off
Kick a door off the hinge, house call, comin' in
Got a cocksucka' dope and his dividends
Ain't no friends in this fucking game that we call life
Wear your Cartier to the Club better think twice

[Hook]
So I'm fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
Fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
I gotta touch'em
I gotta touch'em
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to Get'm Get'm Get'm Get'm

[Verse Two]
I see my victims, I gotta get him, I gotta stick him
How could I miss a chili which what made me pick him
Roley on his wrist, shoes on his whip, got me scoopin'
Gotta catch his ass all alone is what I'm hoping
Got that fuckin Glock, got it fuckin cocked, thats fo sho
In about a minute he gon' find me kickin in his door
Trail his ass home, in my hand the chrome, about to stain
If he give me static, automatic take him out the game
Pull up at his home and he all alone, Jackpot
Saw him grab his pistol out his muthafuckin stash spot
Crept up behind to commit the Crime, drop the gat
Fore' I blow your ass off, put one threw your Gucci hat
Picked up the tone, now its fuckin on, robbed him blind
Didn't know that night, he'd be the victim of a fuckin crime
Took all his cash, stashed on his ass, Nah nah
Now that a nigga can fit, my description, he can't stay alive

[Hook]
So I'm fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
Fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
I gotta touch'em
I gotta touch'em
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm

Throught he good and the bad ima have his back
So ima tell you young niggas in the streets today

The Police, Prosecutors are the enemies
Dont get caught up in that cross yo decsion you make
If I could turn back the hands of time, I would

He got one strike a felon, thats good
?

[Lord Infamous]

Goodie-good, it better be
If it ain't, I'm referring my niggas to some better weed
Got a blunt? Fire it up, what'chu babysittin for?
So you can go back home and get to smokin with that silly ho
That's a fuckin no-no
All she do is smoke your dope
Sittin at home on her ass, waitin on you so she can smoke
It's time out for nothin hoes, all I do is blaze trees
Smoke myself into a coma or untill I'm crazy
Got my eyes lazy
Smokin Purple Hazy
I need a stronger dose, cause that regular don't phase me

(Hook)

(Verse 2, Frayser Boy)
A nigga swervin, high, drunk
And the lane bout to change over
Chevy on my left, and on my right there's a Range Rover
Hennessey killin me, need to just remain sober
Smokin make it better, when I'm high, I think the pains over
I'm too high, games over, bout to go to sleep
Drivin, weed is got me wishin that a nigga had a auto-pilot
Cause I don't think I'm gon' make it to my destination, Jone
Arguin with this stupid bitch, blowin my high while on the phone
'Dro is got me in the zone, I can't walk a straight line
Don't you think I'm that high doggin, make you plot to take mine
Get'cho ass popped mayn, 'Dro is got me paranoid
Niggas real nervous, I can't stand the sound of loud noise
Cut the radio down, so I can enjoy my high
See the police in my rear-view, hope them bitches roll on by
Smokin like I'm a fiend
I'm always high when I'm seen
Or maybe a little slum from sippin on purple lean, 'cha mean?

(Hook)[Juicy J]
Frayser man tell these niggas how it was in the Bay

[Verse One]
Comin up I was told to take what a nigga need
Niggas say lets rob a nigga blind, and dammit i'd agree
Learned from the best Green Bry way back in the day
In the Bay saw a nigga get jacked for his jacket
It all started when my cousin put a gun up in my hand
Already had some sticky fingers, time to rob a man
Doin dirt since a young cat, you name it probably done that
You let me in your house a day later a nigga come back
Get the mask, get the Glock, haulin' ass to your block
Stuntin a little to much my nigga got me mobbin to your spot
Wrong place at the wrong time, incidently cost
Got on Jordans size 12,  nigga I'm like take em' off
Kick a door off the hinge, house call, comin' in
Got a cocksucka' dope and his dividends
Ain't no friends in this fucking game that we call life
Wear your Cartier to the Club better think twice

[Chorus]
So I'm fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
Fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
I gotta touch'em
I gotta touch'em
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to Get'm Get'm Get'm Get'm

[Verse Two]
I see my victims, I gotta get him, I gotta stick him
How could I miss a chili which what made me pick him
Roley on his wrist, shoes on his whip, got me scoopin'
Gotta catch his ass all alone is what I'm hoping
Got that fuckin Glock, got it fuckin cocked, thats fo sho
In about a minute he gon' find me kickin in his door
Trail his ass home, in my hand the chrome, about to stain
If he give me static, automatic take him out the game
Pull up at his home and he all alone, Jackpot
Saw him grab his pistol out his muthafuckin stash spot
Crept up behind to commit the Crime, drop the gat
Fore' I blow your ass off, put one threw your Gucci hat
Picked up the tone, now its fuckin on, robbed him blind
Didn't know that night, he'd be the victim of a fuckin crime
Took all his cash, stashed on his ass, Nah nah
Now that a nigga can fit, my description, he can't stay alive

[Chorus]
So I'm fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
Fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
I gotta touch'em
I gotta touch'em
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to Get'm Get'm Get'm Get'm
