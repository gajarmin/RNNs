[Intro: Rowdy Rebel]
Oh, They want that hot shit
All these social networks and these computers
Got these niggas walking round like they some shooters
See them in real life they trying to bust maneuvers
Like pussy talk that same shit from your computer

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
Just picked the cash up, they had the boy medula
Call up my broski Gene, like call up the jeweler
I just spent some cash on a pinky ring
Just made some brand new shmoney, it'd wasn't a fucking thing
And bitch I'm heading to your city
Just to clap up all them bitis
Me and JJ went from 50
Filled up the gas tank it was empty
We heading out to Philly
Smoking Fronto, bitch no Phillies
I got racks all in my Billies
Shout out to Slice, that's my Billy
For Kokane Shyste I'm getting trippy
Right to the other side with my guys and get busy
I'm shooting up the streets not the gym
I'm shooting at these suckers, not the rim
2Pac, Above The Rim
Put two shots in his chin
Ran down, he jumped the fence
I ran down in my Timbs
Saw the pussy through the tints
I was in that boy Memph Benz
With some shit that extend
Put two shots in his friends
For Kokane Shyste, I go in
For Shyste, I go in
Free my dogs out the pen
They shooting shit, Jeremy Lin
RIP that boy French
He still in Vegas with my friends
Buying out the bar, still going in
Flying down a mother fucking strip
And I got court on the fifth
Tell the DA suck a dick, not coming in
Gingerbread bitch
On the road, headed to that bread, bitch

[Interlude: Rowdy Rebel]
Brand new shmoney
Bitch, I just got some brand new shmoney

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
So you wanna talk shit and run your mouth
You wanna see my black ass right in front your house?
With some Shmurdas and the flag wrapped around my mouth
I ain't come to talk, I came to bang it out
Just called them thangs up, they begging, "Bro, don't shoot him"
But once he disrespect, it's like I gotta do him
I just spent some cash on a 40 Glock
And my nigga Killa ran through like 40 Glocks
And I'm headed to your block
Just to unload all these Glocks
My AR hold 30 shots
That's word to Kane, that's word to Hot
Bitch, I'm hated by many
So I gots to keep the semi
For Kokane, we pour out Henny
Cause for Kokane, we done shot plenty
I should say sorry to Ms. Penny
She caught me broad day in the street shooting Jimmies
I'm running niggas down in they jewels
I'm sliding over cars while I shoot
I think that I'm Tom Cruise
But, bitch I'm Bobby with that tool
I got that "bow", run up on him, act a fool
Make sure I hit you, you, and you
Got the drop, I let Monte loose
That's man downs in front the school
And we still trapping like some fools
Bitch, I been trapping up since elementary school
Told my teacher suck a dick, I'm selling food
I told my teacher suck a dick, I'm selling food
And free my daddy out the You-Know
He killed shit, bitch, grab a tombstone
RIP my nigga, Pluto
He still in Vegas with the bros
Loading up that thing, still smoking dope
Wilding on the mother fucking road
And I got court on the fourth
Told the DA lick my balls, not getting caught
Gingerbread bruh
On the road smoking hella dope, bro

[Outro: Bobby Shmurda
I just got a brand new burner

[Intro]
Girl, he got shmoney

[Hook] x2
She all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas
She don't with broke niggas, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Verse 1]
Lil bitch, go and shake that ass for these tips
Come bring it back and do a split on this dick
For a couple bands, she'll shmoney dance on this dick
Pussy so good, I went to France with the bitch
Damn, she look good when she back that ass up
Damn, I look good when I stack the cash up
I'mma lay a lil nigga now, don't forget it now
Pussy nigga good, boy, you know I tear it down
Broke niggas talking but I can't hear 'em now
Pussy niggas play, boy, you know I sit 'em down
Fool nigga play with me, I make his brains hit the floors
Smoke some good weed with my bitch and watch hit the floor
I done roll through the door, make some bands with the bitch
Like you never see me walk in holdin' hands with the bitch
I'mma lay a lil nigga, don't fuck with broke niggas
And she all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Walk up in this bitch throwing C-notes
With some G Code, got her in the back yelling "East coast"
Little bit of Henny with some weed smoke
And some Clicquot , told my freak ho "Keep my drink, ho"
She gon' pop that pussy for the week though
Every weekend, tell her I need some pussy and some deep throat
She gon' do that thing until her knees broke
On the d-low, baby, we ain't through like 3 bros
(?) told my nigga go in beast mode, I'm in beast mode
Shooting niggas for the cheap, ho
Nigga only owed the nigga 30, yeah 30
Then I shot him with the eagle
Cause a nigga got a big ego, I’m illegal, bustin’ shots like it’s legal
Cops tryna find me like I’m Nino
I’m in Reno, geeking hoes down like I’m Z-Ro

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Bitch boy, you can't tell me shit
I'm the kinda nigga she wanna be with
You the kind of nigga she likes right now
VIP and just spent 5 thou'
Get it right, welcome to the stage
Pull some cash out your pocket and watch her get paid
I know you tryna' hit that, if you ain't got enough dick for that
Big cat, she'll probably make you spend a lil more
Or maybe you should go
Silly ass pimps out there playing with these hoes
I'm a real one, ask her what she want from me
It's nothing, I'll show her how to get money
If he don't throw it in the air, he better not touch her
She don't love you, man, she nothing but a hustler
Fuck yeah, hell naw, she won't fuck you
Take her to your spot, boy, the bitch light rocks

[Hook] x2[Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda]
Let me tell you I'm conceited, bitch, I don't need a bitch
They be begging me to breed a bitch, but I can't keep a bitch
You know me, right after I beat it bitch, Imma leave it, bitch
I ain't even with the screaming shit, Imma freeze a bitch
Then ask Monte where my sneakers went, with the Beamer whip
Shooting niggas front of Keisha crib, right where Keisha live
Homie, tell me if you need a shift, I'm at Rita crib
CC2's like every weekend, bitch, ain't no sleeping this
Let me tell you 'bout my reckless life
I was selling white, homies 'bout to cause some wreck tonight
Ain't no check tonight, police looking for us left to right
Ain't no rest tonight, we on the run until the check is right
You get the message, aight?

[Hook x2: Rowdy Rebel]
Now what you know about that kitchen life
When we was pitching white?
People saying that our vision right, but we ain't living right
I told Bobby keep that pistol tight the way we living life
Niggas turn into that jealous type when you start living life

[Verse 2: Rowdy Rebel]
I'm living life like a boss
Bitch, take a photo and get busy with a star
I'm living large so don't know the total to my car
But I just know that shit real fast when it start
Shit, watch me take off, I'm a fool, I'm a dog
I'm a nigga that make music for a job
I'll drop a bomb on your big body cars
Nigga, what you thought? Bitch, I'm Rowdy, I go hard
With 30 bands then I blow it on the squad
Give a little bit of Shmoney to my moms
Remember when that nigga used to jugg and rob
Now we living large

[Hook x2: Rowdy Rebel][Intro: Fabolous]
Niggas got me on my Brooklyn shit
Aye, what I told 'em? I said
Being hot get you the MVP
Stayin' hot get you the hall of fame
It's Loso (Brooklyn forever!)
Shmurda, what up, son?
Brooklyn, what up, son? Huh?

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yo, I hit my shmoney dance when I caught the lick
I hit my shmoney dance when I caught ya chick
I Bobby Shmurdered that when she came 'round
Threw the hat up in the air, it never came down
And I just caught that body like a week ago
Real quick, click clack, get to freakin', ho
She want some hot nigga chillin' out in Mykonos
Or thot niggas all summer, every weekend, ho
I ain't no killer but don't push me, yo
I had 'em killers in yo' bushes, yo
Them trick niggas splurge on the pussy, yo
You give me one day, I'll Purge on that pussy, yo
You ain't seen these kicks since like the fifth grade
Back when Bo Jackson and Ken Griffey played
On my 90s flow, nigga, Young OG shit
On my GSC, Meet the Family shit

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Can't hold you forever, you gon' get a date
Tell 'em free my nigga Critter Mate
Hold ya head to all my niggas in the state
D-Block, GS9, nigga, get it straight
Got the semi and fully on me
Gloves, mask and a hoodie on me
Case we need to steal a V, I got the pully on me
I know you shocked, right? They got me on bully, homie
It's fake love cause they really hatin'
For my downfall, they really waitin'
Hundred yardies, a hundred Haitians
I'm a hot nigga by affiliation

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look, fresh up out the county, I done did a lil bid
Let the popos run up on me, I won't tell them coppers shit
All this money in my pocket, you might think I sold a brick
I got four hoes and some Hen, some low pros on my Benz
And if I catch that nigga slippin', I'mma shut him down
Let my homies separate his body, call that Seven Pounds
Better cool out, I'm nice with the hands
You keep talking that shit, I'll knock you out
A nigga be pickin' you up off of the ground for thinkin' you 2Pac
And shawty give me neck till I pass out
And she just gettin' checks cause her ass out
Makin' money, gotta be the fast route
Bitch, if you ain't fuckin', better get yo' ass out

[Verse 4: Rowdy Rebel]
Pow! Pow! That chopper make him Diddy Bop
Free Slice Billy, let my billy rock
And free A-billi, let A-billi out
When Flex drop a bomb on us, watch the city rock
Made Diddy shmoney dance right on Biggie block
Make him bring a hundred bands and the city out
When Fresh pull up in that brand new yop
Watch me slide off wit' ya thot cause I'm worth about a milli now
Niggas think cause we dancin' 'round, niggas won't get shot
That's Bobby Shmurda, not Bobby Brown, known to pop up on the block
These pussy niggas better calm it down, get the same drop from that thot
And these fuck niggas don't come around cause they know they gon' get shot

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Fuck around and get ya shit popped
Like hanging out too long on 91st and Winthrop
See, you the type to probably get got
See, this where all the fuckery nigga shit stop
Shawty climb this money mountain to the tip-top (get it)
Throw a hundred fifty on my wrist (watch)
Stayed with the heat, they call me Chris Bosh
Angry cause niggas see me leavin' the bitch block
Shout my nigga Web, shout my nigga Luger
Free my nigga Smiles, free my nigga Scooter
I suggest you probably pray to Buddha
Conglomerate and GS9 niggas full of shooters

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Let's talk about a hot nigga
My dogs'll sit and watch, nigga
Fuck the judge, we never cop, nigga
Who the first to bring that Lambo on the block, nigga?
Poppin' Aces in the studio wit' Bobby 'nem
Before all the labels started callin' him
Cause bitch, I understand him cause I'm one of them
So know you hatin' on me if you hatin' on them
Memphis shooters, that's who we are
Made a million out a glass jar
Cocaine, I got dope bars
My nigga Snootie just caught a gun charge
Fuck a law, we gon' ride strapped, bitch

And free my nigga Meek, I'm on my Philly shit
And my New York bitch from Dyckman, she Dominican

[Verse 7: Bobby Shmurda]
Grimy savage, that's who we are
Grimy shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my Gun Squad
And bitch, if it's a problem, we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin' out the AR

Broad daylight and we gon' let them thangs bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, ho

And tell my niggas Shmurda teamin', ho
Mitch caught a body about a week ago
Fuck wit' us and then we tweakin', ho

Everybody want to bang hot till the gang hot

Drop a dime on my nigga, I’ll block out

I'm with Rebel on the strip, I hit niggas then we dip
Bitch i'm hot, bitch i'm crip, Slice Billy with the shits
I don't fuck witchu' no more cause GS9 is how I live
And my niggas with the shits, and everybody know all my niggas up them poles, and everybody know
I call Bobby, he go savage, everybody catching holes
I call Rebel , he go crazy, everybody gotta go

[Verse 3:Rowdy Rebel]
But wait, what they know bout' Rowdy?
They don't know bout' Rowdy
That's another sh-man down, tell them come get the body

Im with shmoney Bobby, call up my shmurda posse
That boy shmurda Bobby move like shower posse
Bullets flying through ya club, that's a shower party

[Hook:Bobby Shmurda][Intro: Rowdy Rebel]
Oh, They want that hot shit
All these social networks and these computers
Got these niggas walking round like they some shooters
See them in real life they trying to bust maneuvers
Like pussy talk that same shit from your computer

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
Just picked the cash up, they had the boy medula
Call up my broski Gene, like call up the jeweler
I just spent some cash on a pinky ring
Just made some brand new shmoney, it'd wasn't a fucking thing
And bitch I'm heading to your city
Just to clap up all them bitis
Me and JJ went from 50
Filled up the gas tank it was empty
We heading out to Philly
Smoking Fronto, bitch no Phillies
I got racks all in my Billies
Shout out to Slice, that's my Billy
For Kokane Shyste I'm getting trippy
Right to the other side with my guys and get busy
I'm shooting up the streets not the gym
I'm shooting at these suckers, not the rim
2Pac, Above The Rim
Put two shots in his chin
Ran down, he jumped the fence
I ran down in my Timbs
Saw the pussy through the tints
I was in that boy Memph Benz
With some shit that extend
Put two shots in his friends
For Kokane Shyste, I go in
For Shyste, I go in
Free my dogs out the pen
They shooting shit, Jeremy Lin
RIP that boy French
He still in Vegas with my friends
Buying out the bar, still going in
Flying down a mother fucking strip
And I got court on the fifth
Tell the DA suck a dick, not coming in
Gingerbread bitch
On the road, headed to that bread, bitch

[Interlude: Rowdy Rebel]
Brand new shmoney
Bitch, I just got some brand new shmoney

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
So you wanna talk shit and run your mouth
You wanna see my black ass right in front your house?
With some Shmurdas and the flag wrapped around my mouth
I ain't come to talk, I came to bang it out
Just called them thangs up, they begging, "Bro, don't shoot him"
But once he disrespect, it's like I gotta do him
I just spent some cash on a 40 Glock
And my nigga Killa ran through like 40 Glocks
And I'm headed to your block
Just to unload all these Glocks
My AR hold 30 shots
That's word to Kane, that's word to Hot
Bitch, I'm hated by many
So I gots to keep the semi
For Kokane, we pour out Henny
Cause for Kokane, we done shot plenty
I should say sorry to Ms. Penny
She caught me broad day in the street shooting Jimmies
I'm running niggas down in they jewels
I'm sliding over cars while I shoot
I think that I'm Tom Cruise
But, bitch I'm Bobby with that tool
I got that "bow", run up on him, act a fool
Make sure I hit you, you, and you
Got the drop, I let Monte loose
That's man downs in front the school
And we still trapping like some fools
Bitch, I been trapping up since elementary school
Told my teacher suck a dick, I'm selling food
I told my teacher suck a dick, I'm selling food
And free my daddy out the You-Know
He killed shit, bitch, grab a tombstone
RIP my nigga, Pluto
He still in Vegas with the bros
Loading up that thing, still smoking dope
Wilding on the mother fucking road
And I got court on the fourth
Told the DA lick my balls, not getting caught
Gingerbread bruh
On the road smoking hella dope, bro

[Outro: Bobby Shmurda
I just got a brand new burner
I just got a brand new burner
Shmurda[hookx2]
Free all of my dogs, dope dealers
They serving that raw, them cope dealers
Thats killing all of them boys, free all my killers
Free all of my squad, I love all my niggas

[verse1]
Roll that roll that beam joint put that on his beam joint
You can put my team on for some cash and lean on
Grab some space to peeon no more smoking ping pong
Free slice billy top dog , you know we some hot boys
But for my family I focuse on that main thang
And for my family I even stopped that gangbang
And for my family I even put away some change
But on my family Rowdy you'll never change
I came a long way so fuck what they say
Copped me a [?] im riding to the bank
Spend it a hunnid cop me a plate
[?]

[hook][Bridge: Rowdy Rebel]
Got a couple of bucks with a couple more guns just to hit all these niggas
Who the fuck is these guys? I don't fuck with them niggas
GS9 are my guys, they pull a lot of them triggers
OTF are my guys, stomp the door it's a stick up

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Gang

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
Slide them doors it's a stick up, hit all of them niggas, they proud of them niggas
And when you start up with niggas, we'll steady gun down all of them niggas
And Monty can get you, when Monty come get you, you'll be outta this picture
(?)
Ain't none of us different, the only thing different is this money I'm getting
And these bitches I’m hitting, hotel from hotel bring all of them bitches
Bitch I ride for the gang, do or die for the gang, put a shot in your brain
Ain't no riding on gang, ain't no hiding from gang, you can die from gang

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Gang bang, bullets go bang bang
Call Zoo with the MAC, he don't play games
Stuck in that jam, mask up on that cam, I say lawyers I don't say names
Chiraq with them .30's on .40's
I bang, so we smoking on shawty (Tooka)
Any hood, any gang ain't worth it
Shooters on deck like Kylie Irving
Shooters go duh duh duh
One false move then he on the news
Homicide call it, don't get confused
Lil nigga 15 doing 22
Free Nine, free Rose, free 22
In the hood it ain't hard to find
Me and YC posted with the nine
I'm out on bond with a Glock 9
Bitch I'm GANG!

[Bridge + Hook][Hook – Abillyon]
Baby, I’m gon' get a room for ya
I look like a goon to ya
You don’t know what I’ll do to ya
And you look like the usual
I feel like I'm losing ya
I’m gon’ bust my tool for ya
You don’t know what I do for ya
I'm gon' keep my cool for ya

[Verse 1 – Bobby Shmurda]
Cool kid, girl I might bust a juice in your eye
Tell her go and get a room key, girl Imma get a room for us
Hit me, she told me bout my groupies
Girl that’s just groupie love
Then I told her bout my two seat
And who I had in my two seater
I was rolling like I'm Drake from DeGrassi, I think I’m fancy
I won’t let em feel this cash me, I let em pass me
A nigga all about that cash see but if you ask me
I like em classy but love em nasty
She gave me head up in my backseat, that’s where my gat be
I leave a million in the alley to fly to Paris
But then she call me like a taxi so she can text me
I told that bitch go get my batteries and rub my Cali

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Rowdy Rebel]
Late nights, great sex
She came first, I came next
Fucking up this telly
Watch the walls in this room sweat
Took a train, I called a jet
Tellin' niggas come correct, Abilly’s home so cut the check
Put a foot on nigga’s neck before a nigga disrespect I disconnect a nigga’s neck
Took a trip out west just to help me with the stress
Girl excuse me for my foolish thought cause I’m just getting used to you
Before we grab this bite, grab a room for ya
I swear to keep it true to ya
Because true was all she knew before she met me, now it’s two of us
I got her riding in the newest stuff
I bought the Bentley coupe, baby girl says she wants the Beamer truck
Fill her tank up, I fill her bank up
Kiss her, make up, we always break up
Girl look what this world do to us
Let’s go and get lost baby, I got a room for us

[Hook][Intro: Fabolous]
Niggas got me on my Brooklyn shit
Aye, what I told 'em? I said
Being hot get you the MVP
Stayin' hot get you the hall of fame
It's Loso (Brooklyn forever!)
Shmurda, what up, son?
Brooklyn, what up, son? Huh?

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yo, I hit my shmoney dance when I caught the lick
I hit my shmoney dance when I caught ya chick
I Bobby Shmurdered that when she came 'round
Threw the hat up in the air, it never came down
And I just caught that body like a week ago
Real quick, click clack, get to freakin', ho
She want some hot nigga chillin' out in Mykonos
Or thot niggas all summer, every weekend, ho
I ain't no killer but don't push me, yo
I had 'em killers in yo' bushes, yo
Them trick niggas splurge on the pussy, yo
You give me one day, I'll Purge on that pussy, yo
You ain't seen these kicks since like the fifth grade
Back when Bo Jackson and Ken Griffey played
On my 90s flow, nigga, Young OG shit
On my GSC, Meet the Family shit

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Can't hold you forever, you gon' get a date
Tell 'em free my nigga Critter Mate
Hold ya head to all my niggas in the state
D-Block, GS9, nigga, get it straight
Got the semi and fully on me
Gloves, mask and a hoodie on me
Case we need to steal a V, I got the pully on me
I know you shocked, right? They got me on bully, homie
It's fake love cause they really hatin'
For my downfall, they really waitin'
Hundred yardies, a hundred Haitians
I'm a hot nigga by affiliation

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look, fresh up out the county, I done did a lil bid
Let the popos run up on me, I won't tell them coppers shit
All this money in my pocket, you might think I sold a brick
I got four hoes and some Hen, some low pros on my Benz
And if I catch that nigga slippin', I'mma shut him down
Let my homies separate his body, call that Seven Pounds
Better cool out, I'm nice with the hands
You keep talking that shit, I'll knock you out
A nigga be pickin' you up off of the ground for thinkin' you 2Pac
And shawty give me neck till I pass out
And she just gettin' checks cause her ass out
Makin' money, gotta be the fast route
Bitch, if you ain't fuckin', better get yo' ass out

[Verse 4: Rowdy Rebel]
Pow! Pow! That chopper make him Diddy Bop
Free Slice Billy, let my billy rock
And free A-billi, let A-billi out
When Flex drop a bomb on us, watch the city rock
Made Diddy shmoney dance right on Biggie block
Make him bring a hundred bands and the city out
When Fresh pull up in that brand new yop
Watch me slide off wit' ya thot cause I'm worth about a milli now
Niggas think cause we dancin' 'round, niggas won't get shot
That's Bobby Shmurda, not Bobby Brown, known to pop up on the block
These pussy niggas better calm it down, get the same drop from that thot
And these fuck niggas don't come around cause they know they gon' get shot

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Fuck around and get ya shit popped
Like hanging out too long on 91st and Winthrop
See, you the type to probably get got
See, this where all the fuckery nigga shit stop
Shawty climb this money mountain to the tip-top (get it)
Throw a hundred fifty on my wrist (watch)
Stayed with the heat, they call me Chris Bosh
Angry cause niggas see me leavin' the bitch block
Shout my nigga Web, shout my nigga Luger
Free my nigga Smiles, free my nigga Scooter
I suggest you probably pray to Buddha
Conglomerate and GS9 niggas full of shooters

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Let's talk about a hot nigga
My dogs'll sit and watch, nigga
Fuck the judge, we never cop, nigga
Who the first to bring that Lambo on the block, nigga?
Poppin' Aces in the studio wit' Bobby 'nem
Before all the labels started callin' him
Cause bitch, I understand him cause I'm one of them
So know you hatin' on me if you hatin' on them
Memphis shooters, that's who we are
Made a million out a glass jar
Cocaine, I got dope bars
My nigga Snootie just caught a gun charge
Fuck a law, we gon' ride strapped, bitch
We be bout that beef, fuck that rap shit
And free my nigga Meek, I'm on my Philly shit
And my New York bitch from Dyckman, she Dominican

[Verse 7: Bobby Shmurda]
Grimy savage, that's who we are
Grimy shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my Gun Squad
And bitch, if it's a problem, we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin' out the AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Raw
Broad daylight and we gon' let them thangs bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, ho
Some way, free Breezy, ho
And tell my niggas Shmurda teamin', ho
Mitch caught a body about a week ago
Fuck wit' us and then we tweakin', ho
Run up on that nigga, get to squeezin', ho
Everybody catchin' bullet holes
Niggas got me on my bully, yo
I'mma run up, put that gun on him
I'mma run up, go dumb on him
Niggas got me on that young shit
Got me on that go dumb shit

[Outro: Bobby Shmurda]
Got me on that go dumb shit, man
Trap mode in this muhfucka, hotter than a bitch
Ayo, pour up, I need some more drank[Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda]
Let me tell you I'm conceited, bitch, I don't need a bitch
They be begging me to breed a bitch, but I can't keep a bitch
You know me, right after I beat it bitch, Imma leave it, bitch
I ain't even with the screaming shit, Imma freeze a bitch
Then ask Monte where my sneakers went, with the Beamer whip
Shooting niggas front of Keisha crib, right where Keisha live
Homie, tell me if you need a shift, I'm at Rita crib
CC2's like every weekend, bitch, ain't no sleeping this
Let me tell you 'bout my reckless life
I was selling white, homies 'bout to cause some wreck tonight
Ain't no check tonight, police looking for us left to right
Ain't no rest tonight, we on the run until the check is right
You get the message, aight?

[Hook x2: Rowdy Rebel]
Now what you know about that kitchen life
When we was pitching white?
People saying that our vision right, but we ain't living right
I told Bobby keep that pistol tight the way we living life
Niggas turn into that jealous type when you start living life

[Verse 2: Rowdy Rebel]
I'm living life like a boss
Bitch, take a photo and get busy with a star
I'm living large so don't know the total to my car
But I just know that shit real fast when it start
Shit, watch me take off, I'm a fool, I'm a dog
I'm a nigga that make music for a job
I'll drop a bomb on your big body cars
Nigga, what you thought? Bitch, I'm Rowdy, I go hard
With 30 bands then I blow it on the squad
Give a little bit of Shmoney to my moms
Remember when that nigga used to jugg and rob
Now we living large

[Hook x2: Rowdy Rebel][Intro]
Rowdy baby, squad
Nigga my block hot, nigga, my block burn
Nigga my block on fire, nigga, what about yours?

[Verse 1]
Early in the morning, bitch, the birds chirpin'
Narc's on my block, yeah, them boys lurkin'
Just keep your head up lil' nigga, don't be lookin' nervous
And don't panic if they run up and they try to search ya'
You feel a flame fucking with the gang, chick-a-bang
I put ya' brains on ya picture frame
And everybody on my block know I up them thangs
But nobody on my block gonna up and sing, pussy
There's rules on my block, a few done tried and a few done got shot
So don't get it confused on my block
Gettin' rude or try to be cute on my block
Like, early in the morning, go and check my blood
Oh my nigga Boss man got that work strapped up
I tell my nigga all the fuckin' time like bro, you the next best chef up
My youngins in the kitchen, they be water whippin'
Short a gram, you can find ya' daughter missin'
Picture orderin' just don't get ya order different
He wasn't swimming the sharks because I caught him fishin'
My hot boys tote Glocks, boy
And they don't just tote, yeah, they shot boys
Body twirl, watch him drop boy
Oh, I ain't tell you them niggas was hot boys?

[Hook] x2
Nigga, my block on fire, nigga, what about yours?
My hot boys rollin' and them boys don't care
Catch a fuck nigga slippin', run up on then wait
They don't want me, Allen or D-Wade

[Verse 2]
Nigga, welcome to my Zoe life, should I live a cold life?
IPhone box wrapped up, nigga, with all rice
I done seen shit that make a nigga live the wrong life
Good die young but ain't nothing bout' them boys nice
I done seen sons sell a gun for the right price
In the long run, the same gun take that boy life
We had a hard life, fought for hard white
But niggas charge it to the game, credit card swipes
Fresh mikes, probably do the all whites
Giuseppe down when I get the cash right
And I ain't fucking all these bitches from my past life
Unless the register is lit or I'm cash right
And I be waiting for the cash, waiting all night
Once the shit clear, I be there, on sight
Heard these lame niggas moving funny
Just don't jack squad, nigga, all Shmoneys

[Hook] x2[Chorus: Rich The Kid] (2x)
(I was on my way)
On my way to the bank with some hundreds
Bitch thats where my money stay
(I was on my way)
On my way to her place
She said turn up then we turn up everyday
(I was on my way)

[Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda]
On my way to the jeweler
Told nigga that I need a new chain
(that I need a new chain)
On my way to my jeweler
Told that nigga that I need like two chains
(that I need like two chains)
And if a nigga try to snatch it
Then that nigga gonna need a new brain
(he gonna need a new brain)
I told my team fore'  you pop em
And you drop em
Bro just leave my shoes clean
Before we pick it up
We pick em up and throw his ass through the food chain
Chewy 7:30 loco I'ma show you nigga's how to do things

[Chorus:] (2x)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
On my way to your bitch house
Young rich nigga in the bank pullin' racks out
Pourin' I pull up in Forgi's
Bitches is gorgeous
Droppin' the top on the Porsches
Too many chains, she looked at my pinky she gave me the brain
Walk in the bank and they knowing my name
I'd rather be rich before the fame
You ain't drop 50 racks on the Rollie
Back then I was broke you ain't know me
In the trap I been trappin' until I OD
Fuck 12 I be runnin' from the Police
On the way to the check, I got the tech
Pull up I spray at your neck
She suckin' me up in the back of the Bentley
Where is the roof on the Bentley?
Got a whole lot of hoes they turn up
Bitches too foreign they come from the border
Countin' Blue Benjamins racks on the way
Smokin' on cookies they come from the Bay
Sippin the syrup in the morning, purple like Barney
I got a 'Rari it's orange
She keep on callin', drippin' and pourin'
I cannot fuck her I'm touring

[Chorus:] (2x)

[Verse 3: Rowdy Rebel]
(Schmoney!)
Bitch I’m trapping and dappin, like my young nigga Rich
I just copped me an Aston, music keep blasting, too much water with grits
Shout out to all my QC brothers, it Feels Good to Be Rich
Jump Out the Gym, my house of the cliff, 2pac and Flip
Above the rim, that’s a brand new car, don’t lean on it
She wanna roll with a star, I told her dream on it
She tried to hop in my car, I had to speed on it
Saw it when hit 220 on the dash, with both feet on it
Fuck the speed limit, if coming too far [?]
Because I be rushing to the schmoney, I’m a fiend with it
Got the cups with the ice with the lean in it
Red dot on a Glock, that’s a beam on it
Schmurder she wrote, red ink on it
The ship too full, don’t sink on it
Yellow diamonds in the rollie, put pink in it
And the Glock got a bite, don’t think of it (Bow!)

[Chorus:] (2x)[Hook: Abillyon]
She gon' cry for a nigga
Know a nigga keep it by his side for his niggas
She gon' die for a nigga
Early mornings I’m gone

[Chorus: Abillyon]
Cry for a nigga
She gon' die for a nigga
Fire in the hammer always ride for a nigga
She don’t wanna leave me cuz she down for my niggas
With the homies so we know that ima ride for my niggas
[Everything’s on me x4]
High with my niggas
I get high with my niggas
Any nigga touch me ima die for my niggas
Know you niggas know the hammer fly for my niggas
Rolling with the 12.45 for my niggas
[Early mornings I’m gone x4]

Shmoney, Shmoney. . . Rowdy Baby

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
I came up from the hard knocks
Thats why I took the drop top, off the car lot
Early morning going all out
On the road to the Shmoney till a lil' nigga fall out
And thats why they hate me
But they could never break me
Two pennies they could never change me
I'm Rowdy, I'm Rowdy, I'm Rowdy baby
The same niggas from the start
They wanna put the pain in your heart
They wanna make your heart turn cold
Turn around and put the flame in your heart
She heard about me getting busy on the road
I got a feeling she gon' take me out
I heard this girl real crazy on the low
But thank God I made it out

[Chorus: Abillyon]
Cry for a nigga
She gon' die for a nigga
Fire in the hammer always ride for a nigga
She don’t wanna leave me cuz she down for my niggas
With the homies so we know that ima ride for my niggas
[Everything’s on me x4]
High with my niggas
I get high with my niggas
Any nigga touch me ima die for my niggas
Know you niggas know the hammer fly for my niggas
Rolling with the 12.45 for my niggas
[Early mornings I’m gone x4]

ZOE GOD

[Verse 2: Corey Finesse]
Everything is on me
Gotta keep doing my thing
Everything is on me
I got people dependent on me
Everyday on the road
Daughter need new clothes
Mommy need new home
Cueno need new tones
We don’t know how to act
All we wanna do is ball
Smoke weed with my dogs
Shit fuck with a nigga thoughts
And I lock that shit
Then when I come around niggas like Corey got that shit
Don’t stop that shit
Girl pop that shit
Hold it down for a nigga
Still stay around when its cold like winter
Ride for a nigga, she’ll die for a nigga ‘cause

Everything’s on me

[Chorus: Abillyon]
Cry for a nigga
She gon' die for a nigga
Fire in the hammer always ride for a nigga
She don’t wanna leave me cuz she down for my niggas
With the homies so we know that ima ride for my niggas
[Everything’s on me x4]
High with my niggas
I get high with my niggas
Any nigga touch me ima die for my niggas
Know you niggas know the hammer fly for my niggas
Rolling with the 12.45 for my niggas

She don't with broke niggas, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Verse 1]
Lil bitch, go and shake that ass for these tips
Come bring it back and do a split on this dick
For a couple bands, she'll shmoney dance on this dick
Pussy so good, I went to France with the bitch
Damn, she look good when she back that ass up
Damn, I look good when I stack the cash up

Pussy nigga good, boy, you know I tear it down
Broke niggas talking but I can't hear 'em now
Pussy niggas play, boy, you know I sit 'em down
Fool nigga play with me, I make his brains hit the floors
Smoke some good weed with my bitch and watch hit the floor
I done roll through the door, make some bands with the bitch
Like you never see me walk in holdin' hands with the bitch
I'mma lay a lil nigga, don't fuck with broke niggas
And she all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Walk up in this bitch throwing C-notes
With some G Code, got her in the back yelling "East coast"
Little bit of Henny with some weed smoke
And some Clicquot , told my freak ho "Keep my drink, ho"
She gon' pop that pussy for the week though
Every weekend, tell her I need some pussy and some deep throat
She gon' do that thing until her knees broke
On the d-low, baby, we ain't through like 3 bros
(?) told my nigga go in beast mode, I'm in beast mode
Shooting niggas for the cheap, ho
Nigga only owed the nigga 30, yeah 30
Then I shot him with the eagle
Cause a nigga got a big ego, I’m illegal, bustin’ shots like it’s legal
Cops tryna find me like I’m Nino
I’m in Reno, geeking hoes down like I’m Z-Ro

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Bitch boy, you can't tell me shit
I'm the kinda nigga she wanna be with
You the kind of nigga she likes right now
VIP and just spent 5 thou'
Get it right, welcome to the stage
Pull some cash out your pocket and watch her get paid
I know you tryna' hit that, if you ain't got enough dick for that
Big cat, she'll probably make you spend a lil more
Or maybe you should go
Silly ass pimps out there playing with these hoes
I'm a real one, ask her what she want from me
It's nothing, I'll show her how to get money
If he don't throw it in the air, he better not touch her
She don't love you, man, she nothing but a hustler
Fuck yeah, hell naw, she won't fuck you
Take her to your spot, boy, the bitch light rocks

[Hook] x2[Produced By Jahlil Beats]

[Hook][Hook]
They say them boys turned crazy after Shyste died
Look around bitch, it’s shyste time
But shyste ain’t dead, he just went to Vegas
With his .45 and a couple Haitians
Bitch you ain’t ‘bout that life, so why you keep on faking
Don’t make King County have another patient
Harlem Zoes I brought with me, bitch them niggas Haitians
No green card don’t call immigration

[Verse 1]
I’m on the road to the money, bitch I keep 'em chasing
No conversation with these bitches, see these bitches later
I’m racing to the shmoney that’s my destination

No one-on-one with the squad, ho, no isolation

Oh yeah my highs with the shits, that’s cooperation
And we don’t tell the cops shit, no corroboration (not at all)
Oh yeah it's shmoney on my mind, that’s my occupation
Oh yeah my Shmurda in this bitch that’s why them guns was sprayin'

And they buy out the bar when they want to

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Let that thing fly, we hitting niggas with the same nine
Who let a word fly, all my niggas do the same time

When Jordan went and hit that hang time
And Monte went and he just banged five
Quato caught a fuck boy and he slang nine
Even Sha Sha gave it up, I heard he slang fire

All my niggas in the field, bitch the gang nine
We making 'Kane smile

And my 16's still kill babies
Nigga ain't no talking on the phone
We slide on em niggas til they homes

Drop a nigga like some dominoes
Swimming on a table like a volleyball
Hang up a nigga like a dial tone
Now everybody screaming who like I'm Mike Jones
Man I wish a nigga would, on my Pac shit
Or he gon' get shot when the Glock kick
Take the mother of the moth spit
Then your block on my eyes on some hot shit
In the 9 where you find me though
So when the body drop, nobody know
So when you in yo funeral
I'm in the studio, tell em boy adios

It’s two dope boys on the avenue
Hopping out the G ride, chain glisten
Mink dragon on the floor, not to mention
The bitches they love us, they want to fuck us
The bitches they love us, they want to fuck us

[Verse 1 – Rowdy Rebel]
It's two dope boys on a mission
Hopping out the G ride, chain glisten
And these bitches they love us, they want to fuck us
GS9 all my niggas, man they my brothers
I remember late night in them trenches
On the corner ducking deals, jumping fences
Class clown, man I stayed up in detention
So when I ride by, keep the top missing
Man you never seen nothing like this
Scratch that, I’m past that, look at my wrist
And free my nigga 730 K Tone
Get busy with the Glocks, I get busy on my block boy
It’s all about the man [?]
I keep a dirty [?] round me, no extension
All eyes on me, feel their attention
Hopping out the G Ride, chain glisten

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 – Manolo Rose]
Me and my crew be on a mission
Remember when I didn’t have a pot to piss in
The nina, that’s my bitch, I be tricking
So you know I had to pay for extensions
When the finger hit the trigger call it kissing
Extra clips in my pocket made it last longer
I learned from the 9, oh yeah
Cameras watching when I’m shooting, keep your mask on
Splash brothers with the aim, fuck that
I’m past that, yeah nigga, Manolo wrote it
Young bosses in the game, oh yeah
I want my nigga [?] told him how to get it gone
