Think you're big boy cos you got a beard
Bullets will make your face look weird
Draw for the mash quickly disappeared
Left you there cause I never cared
Into the car slam it in to the gears
For what I've just done, could get years
Heart is cold and I've got no fears
Shed no tears, no MC compares
I've been badding up MCs for years
From way back when you used to wear flares
By that time you opened your ears
I'm gonna climb to the top like stairs
Think you're big boy cos you go gym
Bullets will cave your whole face in
Draw for the ting but forget to swing
First to draw will win

Don't come single against D Double
You can try but you won't be able
Soon gonna be signed to the label
Soon gonna see dough on the table
Try mess with the dough on the table a
I'll put the the tip of the gun straight up your nostril
And pull
Who's on the mic D Double not D Single

Head get mangled and dangled
To the side just like I wear my Kangol
Nowadays I'm on arms just like a bangle
(If you) try test me you get man handled
With the tool I've got bullets that like to mingle
On road and especially in the dancehall
Try duck under the table
I'll just fire my ting from the next angle

Now you want to cancel
Cause you know you'll get rubbed out like pencil
You don't want me to make you look like a fool
Got you stressed out smoking menthol
Like its commercial and you wanna draw me blood
Nah that's cool
Only thing I'm gonna draw is my tool
Better go home and make your self useful before I move to you all

Right about now joke ting lyrical
Easily turn real ting physical
Reach out with my hand with the tool and pull
Aim to your dimple and temple
Who do you resemble
Face looks fucked up like Michael
I carry gun like its legal
When we clash your gonna need more people

Bare people think they're heavy like metal
Say they've got dough but they ain't got a shekel
Seen a big gash that looks effed like Ethel
Them MCs better hide before I switch like Jekyll
Cool and seckle before
I sting your ice kettle just like a metal before
Draw for the metal in the belt buckle therefore
Don't start trouble with the Double
When I'm warmed up I'll leave you in a lyric blood puddle
Greet you with arms not talking a cuddle
The doctor can't put you back together like a puzzle
So hold your mouth shut like wearing a muzzle
On your face you'll be wearing
My knuckle imprint to the side of your temple
You're just simple, get popped like a pimple
Sounds of the D Double (OOAH OOAH!)

D Double not D Single
Who's on the mic riding the vinyl
Quick with the easy and simple
MCs get murked if they're commercial
With no rehearsal you'll get a quick burial
Rinse them clean like Ariel, biological
First thing in the morn' like cereal
Cause you're messing with a Newham General
And I take this music personal
Rude boys, they don't take it personal
If you bring your crew then I'll murk them all
Right there on the spot like Clearasil
Cause I told you before don't come single against D Double
I'll put the tip of the gun straight up your nostril and pull

D double is still
I'm part of N.A.S.T.Y Crew still
I'm lyrically ill still
Got lyrics to kill still
Back in the day I used to steal
Still more time I've got
Steel on my waist yo still
These lyrics are raw like steel
But still I've got a better one still

Yo D Double spitting the shit you feel
I keep it real, whats the deal
I hope you don't wanna steal my skill
You must not know me still
I get the tune jacked like draw by the steel
Lyrical nine mil to the DJ's wheel
Spin that one back like windmill still
My selector knows the deal
I keeps it real upon the wheels of steel

I spit a 16 bar
Hot like tar
Soon be a star
Get very far
Never gonna go away, permanent scar
Trust me this lyric no joke lyric
Gonna draw my lyric
Make your new lyrics look like very old
Like no go lyric
Make no dough lyric
Can't match but if you think you can
Then I draw for the next lyrics
Lyrics
Better go and get next lyrics
And make sure that they're your lyrics
There will never be a day when I'm spitting poor lyrics
In war quickly draw twenty four more lyrics
Spit like magnum with the four four lyrics
Hit you in the chest leave you on the floor lyrics
Next time better ignore your lyrics
Like rain, I pour raw

Then I bust a next sixteen
Quick sixteen
I'm gonna let off shots no less than sixteen
Tear an MC in to sixteen bits in sixteen bins
Been ripping the scene to bits from sixteen
And I'm still mean
Ten times better when I was sixteen
Bare man couldn't test when I was sixteen
Even man that was older than sixteen
Didn't believe I was younger than sixteen
And now I'm age two three
Sounds of the Double Double
Part of the natural artistic sounds touching you, you
That's the name of us, trust
We're gonna bust cause we work hard enough
And enough of your crews ain't hard enough
To play with us
And they're hating us
We're not into that so just move away cause

If you mess with a Newham General
Mess with a Newham General
Get left in Newham General
You'll get left in Newham General
Mess with a Newham General
Mess with a Newham General
Get left in Newham General
You'll get left in budda budda A and E!!!Chorus: Fiend (repeat 2X)

Fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas
Don't make me have to bust them niggas, bust them niggas
My fourtyfive will dust them niggas, dust them niggas
Don't make me have to touch them niggas, touch them niggas

[Fiend]
It's F-I-E, O.G. ready to prove that I'm strong enough
Prepared to rip a nigga down if he look at me long enough
I'm supposed to be fucked up with my mental capacity
That's why these killers and they old ladies be coming after me
They won't be no more after me including my body faculity
Look at my name, I'm to blame for all these casualties
No one as bad as me, I search the galaxy
And I'm willing to put up my No Limit royal salary
Go ahead make my manner please if the yapping don't decease
When I stomp, you ???, get up and catch a breeze
I ain't lying I'm horrifying, I'm the bull up in the pit
Full of that shit, and ain't resting till you get your ass whipped
Know what I'm sayin

Chorus

[Magic]
Still keeping it real, smoking weed, drinking hennessey
Every nigga around me that's why none of you niggas can bother me
I'm gettin fucked up so how many wanna ride with me
If you got a blunt get it lighted, come get high with me
I like to smoke till my lungs can't take no more
Got me ducking and diving like I'm strung out on coke
But still one of the most dangerous niggas you ever came across
Better cock my shit and bust until they label you lost
With no remorse, me, Fiend, Big Ed goin be all right
We be ???, come to the show and still gettin high
Talkin bout where my niggas at and where the bitches at
Where the fuck my niggas at, let's get this party started

Chorus

[Big Ed]
Now when I said fuck yall niggas, best believe that I meant it
For every bullet that hit your dome best believe my gat sent it
Niggas talk shit and repent it, cause they know my hollows did shit
I'm back on the streets as a hitman cause my stash is gone I spent it
Gotta jack you for your paper, I'm a No Limit terminator
Hit you like a gladiator, shake you like an alligator
What's up now bitch, when I hit your town get shot or duck down
????? get buck down, two sheds get high no time for showdown
Slow down, I got my gat all in your face
Don't make me sound this bitch off like I'm about to start a race
And leave your head all over the place now that ain't no fun
187, redrum, redrum, cause murder be the outcome

Chorus

[Fiend]
Fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas
I said fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas
I said fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas
I said what's up with them niggas, what's up with them niggas
Fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas

Who's da killer whos the motherfuckin nigga
The one that pull the gun the one that squeaze the fucking trigger
The cops wanna ask me, wanna harrass me
About this dead body in the grass G
If you think Im gonna talk then your wrong
Cause in the ghetto, snitches dont live long
So Ima mind my own and keep stiffing
And dont ask me about no motherfuckin murder weapon
My kids still ringin from the gun black
Because it all happened so fast
I guess my nigga Lil Mark going to heaven
Another black victim of 187
His mom might be crying but she ain't shocked
Her son lived and died by the fucking rock
And thats how the story goes
Everybody in the ghetto getting sweated by the po po's
But ill never help your ass in this game nigga...
Who's Da Killer?

[Master P]
Rat-tat-tat-Rat-tat-tat-Rat-tat-tat- quick to put slugs in your cap
And walk through your hood with my mug on
Call me master p or call me Al Capone
A nigga with no heart
I was born in the ghetto, homeless in a shopping cart
Pushed up the street by a dope fiend
Took to a crack house and taught to use a triple beam
And ever since then Ive been crazy
Step to a nigga like me your pushing daisies
Cause Im quick this in that ass to the county
And while your dead wipe your blood up with bounty
From the corner to the hearse and that assed up
Put bullets in your ass like a garbage truck
Eliminating fools like a sewer rat
And floss my 380 married to a mack
And that ill be a Mack 10
So when i run up on a set punk you know ima do you in

[Big Ed]
Late night in the cutti time to have some fun
Got a page on my beeper it was number 1
Reached for the mobile phone got it down to
Tuner called my lady "Yo, whats going out?"
She asked me were the fuck are you at, and yo nigga
Do you have your motherfucking gat?
Yeah im strapped, and i ran around the block
Then she told me my my older brother got shot
I got to the house and I opened up the door
And there was my brother lyin dead on the floor
And it has me tripped, my ace got popped
Cause they caught his ass slippng
Creep through the hood with my hand on my gat
I gotta get those fools who put my brother on his back
Seen some niggas up the block, released the saftey
Oh when I leave someone is going to hate me
Boot it up take every fucking nigga
Out for revenge trying to find out whos da killer

[King George]
All the way to the county thats were they had me
They sent player one trying to bag me
They keep stressing had a bad bad attitude
He got the word from the order i was a bad dude
In the sell my mind did the linger
I keeped yelling im a fucking rap singer
But nobody listened to a fresh fits convicts
They bust me off like there ears got sound sick
Back to the saga coming from my jailsell
I move around when you hear the fuckin bell yell
I got involved in a scabble thats a fist fight
When the foo bust out with a knife
He started swingin i started ducking
Started moving It was a foo who was down
With the proven, I took a ride on the
C-2 sell block
I stay strapped with my rock in a sock
Waiting for a foo to come when its my way
Sell lurked through you motherfucking didy date
Then he came promise he was down with the linching
Tear gas had the whole floor clinching
I couldn't breath I was lying in my tin bed
When a goon grabbed me by my fucking forhead
He picked me up and put me across his fucking shoulder
I said Bitch you let me die like a soldier
Damn it was a trip King George could think
All my boys on the motherfucking paint
Everywhere I rome every all dead bodies
God damn I was like John Gotti
Locked in a sell i was like a big black gorilla
Many died, but nobody saw the killer


[Silkk]
You should of know your fucking with a motherfucking lunatic
I ain't playing with a full day, and my minds about to click
I walked out the house to see if this shitwas fucking TRU
Two slugs to the dome and his face was all blue
Retalliation fuck the penitention fucking gamble
Garb the tech,  pump the facing amble
Called up my boy cause niggas say some
Where he at?, Richmond jumped  in the prowler
Rolling slow rolling slow, rolling fucking slow
Cut the lights off cause there the nigga go
Rolled on the set grab the mask point the tech out
Its a driveby sprayed the niggas house I was
Letting em go you should of seen
But in the process I cut a motherfucking slug
Dead up in my chest, cops chase me investagating
A dead nigga, I gave the cops the alias
Now whos the fucking killer

[Calli G]
Calli G chourned out by society
I used to have a 95 even bitches find me
So I refuse to be a stray for the white man
So when you see me its a gat in my right hand
Neighborhood Dopeman
Nigga from the base so you know me selling cocain
You fucking with the dank man foo, start the funk

[E-A-Ski]
A foo got smarks so they calling me the trigger nigga
Po po's got a snitch trying to frame me as the killer
Interigating me and I got them foo's spoop
I dre say ya fuck with me, then its a must that I fuck with you
Cause killers dont talk, gimme three hops in the county
Motherfuckers you figure it out, cause bout a nigga like me
If I gotta smoke a nigga ima do it on the solo creep
Cause I be damned if I tell em my self trick
Some niggas ill sell you off like pussy on the bitch
But anyway, back to the story, ya have no nuts, no glory
No evidence to cut a nigga loose, and that nigga that was snitching
Ws kuku for coco puffs foo, cause i mean a nigga thats spook
Try to hide but everybody know he wasn't cool
2 weeks past and the snitches missing
They found a nigga dead, with two to the temple
Somebody put that boy to sleep
Gave the fool a big fist and put his ass six feet deep
It might have been me whos know nigga
Who's the motherfucking killer[Hook]
Fuck that nigga man, get that bitch

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Ed]
I got another nigga in the club, macking a bitch
This nigga been hating, cause his ho sucked my dick
This nigga drove a Benz, and his pop's was rich
Square ass nigga always driving, through the hood and shit
Called my voicemail huh, and sait it was on
I guess my big dick, broke up his happy home
But uh, don't hat the player hate the game nigga
As fine as she is, you would of done the same nigga
He soft, he played like a kitten
I laughed to myself, and said oh no he didn't
So I tapped him on his shoulder, said what's happ'nin
He said what's up my nigga, I said no bitch what's happening
He took a step back, and said dog it ain't like that
He jumped I jumped, then I layed him on his back
If you yap we scrap, ain't no escaping that
Ha, Big Ed be putting it down like that

[Hook - 3x][Fiend]
Whomp! Whomp!

Direct to all surviours on the battlefield
Let's hustle up, get blunted up and test you, what the fuck?
Muscle Up, it's very crazy, for all the killings
Humble up, they don't expect like raw dealings, come winter
Bundle up, me and my pistols stay cuddled up
Gone, nigga, Jones nigga, Sleepy Eye from that zone nigga
Boy they bringing lots of guns, check my home and picture
Besides from every crick that's gone split ya
Memphis I'm hypotinzed with it, means some eyes with it
Voice so high with it, 2005 with it
So ride with it or be rolled the fuck over
Fiend's surviving the soldier, grenade thrower

Stampede on your ass when your fucking with us
I gain the strength of ten men all angeled up
PCP,  scared one droppin' big tank trucks
I'm pumpin' iron at the wake, getting all swolled up
Rip off my shirt, at concerts, cause I'm tatted up
Never worrying about them bustas, my niggas gatted up
Don't step to us, my niggas quick to tear shit up
We lock in down in every town cause we got it solded up
In the hood it's all good, cause they rolling with us
Doing shows at clubs cause I don't give a fuck
You can find me in that bitch fucking booted up
Bust a nigga in his head if he tries to run up
4 is 1, 8 is 0, bitch I stay one up

Chorus [Big Ed] (Fiend)

The battles begun heavy kissing on the front line
Strategic and bout it to explode like a land mine
So you wanna go to war huh
You brought the camoflauge panties and maching bra to get down huh
Big Ed's a soldier and your a soldierette
Nuclear warhead in the trenches watch to get you hot and wet
Bet that a war would last as long as Vietnam
Bet that when you cum it will drop like atomic bombs
Bet that I pack a 50 cal. desert eagle
That will leave you shaking in the trenches here comes the sequel
Wondering what the gats and the blitz
Your grenade exploded so many times that you can't believe this
She look at me she swolled 220 and sewed up
]From the size of the monument, chocolate and tatted up

Chorus x2

[Big Ed]
Now when I said take a bullet for my homie I meant it
Before crushed out tanks I was down to did shit
Fist fighting in clubs cause we had to run it
C-Murder was the first with TRU on his stomach
Down to die for TRU so bitch don't flinch
We been click tight way before we were rich
See this tatoo embedded deep in my skin
Before I take it off I give my right hand
I love these niggas, bust slugs, take slugs for these niggas
Even when they do wrong it ain't wrong cause they my niggas
Cut my chest and blindfold me
My niggas say they put that on TRU and I believe them like God told me

[C-Murder]
I represent that N-O nigga L-I-M-I to the motherfucking T nigga
Motherfuckers dont really wanna go to war with a nigga like me nigga

I've been a tank dog first family member since day one
P was the only nigga rapping
I wasn't tripping I was there cause I ruled that gun
That's why I get mad when niggas talkin bout TRU this TRU that
No Limit this, went and got a tatoo but nigga, I ain't approve of that

[Mia X]
Chorus x2

[Mr. Serv-On]
Aaaaaah!
When you see us, all you see is fame and bitches
When I see myself in the mirror I see a nigga bounded in bloody kisses
Wishes to see my enemies slaughtered
Don't make me harder
Wake up in the morning with this tank on my chest, that makes it easy
For me to digest the stress
Know my nigga P screamed for many years to make some money for us all
And now you niggas tryin to take off my tattoos
And name me tryin to ball (Never)
Believe me nigga when I see ya, you gots to fall (Believe that)
All my tears in my heart (You never know)
And you feel me and this motherfuckin tank will never go (Never never)
I was taught to ride for this, do some time for this
Slang some dope for this and if it came down I'd fuckin die for this

[Silkk The Shocker]
Nigga fa sho (Fa sho)

This No Limit shit bigger then this motherfucker
Niggas just wanna be down

Nobody wanna die with me or do twentyfive with me
Know what I'm sayin?
Nigga let me tell you somethin

Know what I'm sayin, you know what the fuck TRU is
All of a sudden niggas wanna leave and shit through the struggle
And now a nigga on top everybody wanna come back and shit

Ready to go to war

Chorus x2Think you're big boy cos you got a beard
Bullets will make your face look weird
Draw for the mash quickly disappeared
Left you there cause I never cared
Into the car slam it in to the gears
For what I've just done, could get years
Heart is cold and I've got no fears
Shed no tears, no MC compares
I've been badding up MCs for years
From way back when you used to wear flares
By that time you opened your ears
I'm gonna climb to the top like stairs
Think you're big boy cos you go gym
Bullets will cave your whole face in
Draw for the ting but forget to swing
First to draw will win

Don't come single against D Double
You can try but you won't be able
Soon gonna be signed to the label
Soon gonna see dough on the table
Try mess with the dough on the table a
I'll put the the tip of the gun straight up your nostril
And pull
Who's on the mic D Double not D Single

Head get mangled and dangled
To the side just like I wear my Kangol
Nowadays I'm on arms just like a bangle
(If you) try test me you get man handled
With the tool I've got bullets that like to mingle
On road and especially in the dancehall
Try duck under the table
I'll just fire my ting from the next angle

Now you want to cancel
Cause you know you'll get rubbed out like pencil
You don't want me to make you look like a fool
Got you stressed out smoking menthol
Like its commercial and you wanna draw me blood
Nah that's cool
Only thing I'm gonna draw is my tool
Better go home and make your self useful before I move to you all

Right about now joke ting lyrical
Easily turn real ting physical
Reach out with my hand with the tool and pull
Aim to your dimple and temple
Who do you resemble
Face looks fucked up like Michael
I carry gun like its legal
When we clash your gonna need more people

Bare people think they're heavy like metal
Say they've got dough but they ain't got a shekel
Seen a big gash that looks effed like Ethel
Them MCs better hide before I switch like Jekyll
Cool and seckle before
I sting your ice kettle just like a metal before
Draw for the metal in the belt buckle therefore
Don't start trouble with the Double
When I'm warmed up I'll leave you in a lyric blood puddle
Greet you with arms not talking a cuddle
The doctor can't put you back together like a puzzle
So hold your mouth shut like wearing a muzzle
On your face you'll be wearing
My knuckle imprint to the side of your temple
You're just simple, get popped like a pimple
Sounds of the D Double (OOAH OOAH!)

D Double not D Single
Who's on the mic riding the vinyl
Quick with the easy and simple
MCs get murked if they're commercial
With no rehearsal you'll get a quick burial
Rinse them clean like Ariel, biological
First thing in the morn' like cereal
Cause you're messing with a Newham General
And I take this music personal
Rude boys, they don't take it personal
If you bring your crew then I'll murk them all
Right there on the spot like Clearasil
Cause I told you before don't come single against D Double
I'll put the tip of the gun straight up your nostril and pull

D double is still
I'm part of N.A.S.T.Y Crew still
I'm lyrically ill still
Got lyrics to kill still
Back in the day I used to steal
Still more time I've got
Steel on my waist yo still
These lyrics are raw like steel
But still I've got a better one still

Yo D Double spitting the shit you feel
I keep it real, whats the deal
I hope you don't wanna steal my skill
You must not know me still
I get the tune jacked like draw by the steel
Lyrical nine mil to the DJ's wheel
Spin that one back like windmill still
My selector knows the deal
I keeps it real upon the wheels of steel

I spit a 16 bar
Hot like tar
Soon be a star
Get very far
Never gonna go away, permanent scar
Trust me this lyric no joke lyric
Gonna draw my lyric
Make your new lyrics look like very old
Like no go lyric
Make no dough lyric
Can't match but if you think you can
Then I draw for the next lyrics
Lyrics
Better go and get next lyrics
And make sure that they're your lyrics
There will never be a day when I'm spitting poor lyrics
In war quickly draw twenty four more lyrics
Spit like magnum with the four four lyrics
Hit you in the chest leave you on the floor lyrics
Next time better ignore your lyrics
Like rain, I pour raw

Then I bust a next sixteen
Quick sixteen
I'm gonna let off shots no less than sixteen
Tear an MC in to sixteen bits in sixteen bins
Been ripping the scene to bits from sixteen
And I'm still mean
Ten times better when I was sixteen
Bare man couldn't test when I was sixteen
Even man that was older than sixteen
Didn't believe I was younger than sixteen
And now I'm age two three
Sounds of the Double Double
Part of the natural artistic sounds touching you, you
That's the name of us, trust
We're gonna bust cause we work hard enough
And enough of your crews ain't hard enough
To play with us
And they're hating us
We're not into that so just move away cause

If you mess with a Newham General
Mess with a Newham General
Get left in Newham General
You'll get left in Newham General
Mess with a Newham General
Mess with a Newham General
Get left in Newham General
You'll get left in budda budda A and E!!![Soulja Slim/Big Ed]
Chorus
We suggest that you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring the more heads we bust
[Soulja Slim]
It's do or die on the streets that I roam, that I roam
That's why I never leave my gun at home, gun at home x2

[Soulja Slim]
Shit, niggas not goin for the chest these days
Niggas catch ya down bad and bust your motherfuckin head
Put it like that, should have had your gat but nigga you chose to slip
And the nigga chose to let all thirty two out the extension clip
In to your dome, that news gon meet ya momma home
I'll let you slide one time cause she was full of that fucking rum
But you wanna draw down and stunt in front of these pussy poppers
I'm from uptown so you know I gots to get you partner
I've been doin this and you just jumped off the porch with the new jacks
And I got quick reaction to bustin back and hit somethin
Fuck the stuntin, me, myself
Im twirkin somethin and hurtin somethin
Straight dome shot, and when ya fall
Got that look on my face like fuck em all
Then walk off with an innocent look on my face
Soon as I get to the corner, pick up the pace
Running like I'm running a race
Cause I ain't bout no more murder charge catching
Down here them people blues ya, lose you in a second
Get convicted for life, now you trying to appeal
Should have gave them a dome shot, should have played it real
I suggest you don't fuck with us
Suggest don't fuck with us
I suggest

Chorus x2

[Big Ed]
We some hard ass niggas, Big Ed and Soulja Slim
Niggas bust at us, watch us end low and bust at them
Get out the way, kids getting hit and shit
Already split forty rounds and not even a half a clip
Bitches know me as the assassin, tip toe and squeezing and blasting
Camoflauge fatigue feared off in a black ski maskin
A No Limit soldier, nigga we ain't scared to bring it
Nigga I'm tryin to leave the streets behind
And put in no wax and singing
And nigga keep my gat trown up like ????
Trigger finger itching like crabs
Got me strapped tighter then hoes legs wrapped around me when I stab
Nigga think got more deadly so I got more gats
Totin to edge two compacts, Big Ed be puttin it down like that!

Chorus x2

[Mr. Serv-On]
It's the S to the E to the R to the V
To the O to the N to the T to the R to
The U to the N to the I to the G to the K to the A
Can't carry ya, drama marry ya
Step across this fuckin line my tank stroll motherfucker
I straight deal ya
Be like blasting, stepping like a fuckin hog
Soulja Slim ya know me, Big Ed get at me dog
I'm still asking the lord to bless me
These niggas persist to test me
After the night, only the gangsta hell gonna accept me
I'm ready to lay my claim niggas know the game
Ain't shit changed, five hundred dollars
I'm soed up and I'm still creeping
Round the corner with my mask on
Got my gloves on, ready to get my fucking blast on
So when you see me, nigga bow down to this fucking tank
You niggas wanna be like us but you niggas fucking can't
So I'm tired of you motherfuckers
Asking why I twist my hat and wear my colors
It's all tank love, fuck the others
It's real nigga (real)Verse 1 (Master P)

Four niggas in the Chev and we all strapped
Put one up in the chamber case we had to bust caps
Let me let you know bitch who you fucking with
Master P killa murder motherfucking lunatic
With the giggety giggety nine
Put the Glock to your dome and your shit will be giggety mine
Break you off something proper bitch
Ask me where I'm from the manor central soutside of the Rich
Worry niggas can't stand me
Cause I'm known on the turf for serving
Them fiends that fucking killa candy
Break 'em off as I creep slow
But if you run up on the P
Yeah you know you get your ass smoked
12 o'clock and my beeper still beeping
On my way to the northside late night creeping

(Chorus)

Late night creeping (creeping)
Should I say jacking or should I say skeezing

The dope fiends be begging me for crack
Although they want to beat me with they baseball bats

Verse 2 (Master P)

Red and to the blue will be the giggety plain giggety thang
A nigga slang dope, but the P I don't gang bang
Leave a sucker dead any mark on a slab of rock
Arrive at your house smoke a sherm than a nigga laugh
Play a game called show and tell
And if the bitch is hella thick tell her meet me at the motel
Cause slipping is a no no
And the bitch better come true so long at the mo mo
I'll leave a bitch dead and broke
Check a ho, I ain't no motherfucking got damn captain save a ho
So with my nine I be sleeping
Check it out bitch if you catch me late night creeping

(Chorus)

Verse 3 (Master P, Lil'Ric)

I can't sleep at night my mind start playing tricks
I'm having nightmares the ghetto's trying to kill me bitch
I'm paranoid, I sleep with three fucking gats
A tech nine, a oozie, and a carjack
I'm addicted to money and bitches hella disturb
A ounce of dank, that'll calm a nigga nerves
I will mash on that ass like a gas pedal
You owe me scraps I will melt you like a piece of metal
I'm a bounce your ass just like a basketball
And with a pig's blood, write your name up on the wall
So make your fucking death wish
And why you dead I'm gone steal your goods and fuck your bitch
I'm a let you know life in the Rich ain't no joke
So don't you coming riding without your straps ho
And you know the Rich is known for busting caps
Diggety zap the P put the Rich on the giggety map

Lil' Ric

Yeah, back at that ass once again there
Its your nigga Lil Ric, creepin through the windows
Getting him for whatever I can get
Now its time for my niggas to ride
And let this shit fuckin clear

Verse 4 (Big Ed)

Late night creeping Big Ed and Master P
P has got his tech I got my nine next to me
Cause niggas like to jack and in the Bay it never stops
But my hollow tips will leave more scars than the chicken pox
Or run up ya like Emmitt
Hitting like Bonds cause I have a nice slugging percentage
Because a nigga's like loced
Run on up, I'll call ya hickory because your gonna get smoked
I ain't no joker g cause I'm TRU
And everybody in my crew a TRU g too
I thought you knew motherfucker
I'm the type of nigga that'll leave ya fucking heart in the gutter
With the rat-tat-tat rat-tat-tat rat-tat-tat-tat
P, I'm gone put this fucking nigga on his back
I'm a show you why they sleeping
Cause its me and P and we late night creeping

(Chorus)[Master P]
Yo, see them out there
Yo Fiend, fuckin mafiaso
If your fucking with No Limit
Fiend, Big Ed, Master P and Silkk
You fucking with the best
You dont want to fuck with the best
Yo mucha

[Fiend]
Chorus
I only fuck with a few
You never know what these niggas'll do
You better choose careful who you call your crew
And do a review on these bitches, before you call em your boo x2

You never know what's goin on with
Some of these hungry ass niggas arrested
And what you got, never allowed the chance to touch it
Was it obvious that nigga ain't die
He was in from the begginning had a piece of the pie
Cause in his eyes, cold like Chicago weather
Birds of a feather fuck over together, that's forever
The only change, they accepted when I got him killed
Well they all a time for real over a dollar bill
So now you feel that all street family ain't yours
Recieving cuts and sores because you opened your pores
These niggas ride like volvos, and we ain't talkin bout these whores
Give a section of the beach, nigga surfers gotta swim ashore
If you need more, then take this notion with my devotion
Remember jealousy is a wasted emotion

Chorus x2

[Master P]
I'd rather die hustling then be broke and lonely
Cause most of these niggas out here be phony
Find me on the street corner living my life fast
[Big Ed]
Remember take a bullet for your homie
[Master P]
That's my nigga Big Ed
[Big Ed]
See this TRU shit nigga I'm a kill for it
When the rents due, ya know I'm a steal for it
Take a ride with my homies if I have to
Keep your eyes on your enemies cause they'll blast you
[Master P]
And momma sheds tears cause my homies seen that
Nigga gangbang seen TRU up on my chest
To my niggas in jail, stay strong doin time
I thank the lord for taking me out the ghetto with these rhymes
Blood stains on the street cause this ghetto life's a bitch
And thats a shame cause its bound to change once a niggas rich

Chorus x2

[Silkk The Shocker]
Come take a ride at, before the game begins
I seen niggas die bad, and they die for pennies
Can't trust nobody seen around my way
Niggas dead, and that's why they ain't around today
See penetentaries, they ain't no place for me
I tell my mom dont trip, just pray for me
And to all the slugs from niggas that have hate for me
Tell my lady I'll take two years dont even wait for me
And see, you never get a second chance to live a first life
That's why I ball till I fall and live the first right
So even though I thug with them, I still ask these niggas
I've seen alot of ho shit, like you in court your homie testify against ya
I only ride with niggas that I test the water with
Niggas I slang quarters with, slaughter shit, spent the hardest shit
Only trust a few, only trust a few
You fakes, I can't even fuck with you

Chorus x2Artist: Master P f/ Big Ed, King George, Lil Ric, Silkk the Shocker
Album:  99 Ways to Die
Song:   Rollin Thru My Hood

Yo kid man, stop the music

Rollin through my, rollin through my hood
This what I see when I'm rollin through my hood
2 to the 3 to the 4 the 5 the 6
And everybody in the ghetto trying to sew this bitch
Cause she's a dope fiend, she need emphetamine
But I'm the only motherfucker with the candy cream
Now the spots hot, here come the cops
The ??????????, it's time to close up shop
Time to move on, brothas on there cellular phones
Talkin to them hoochies, I mean them ding dongs
Cause in the ghetto everbody got nicknames
Like Master p, Lil Roy, and Big Man
Eyes red, dank to the head
I'm not Snoop Dogg but I feel like Lil Half Dead
Henace with a dab of that gin and juice
Gatorade, but it gotta be 80 proof
So we can remenisce to all the niggas missed
And when I said the ghetto's trying to kill me, feel this
Cause in my hood, it's rest in peace shirt
And every nigga in they momma done did dirt
Or formed a gang, or even ganged banged
Or slang dope, motherfucker it's the same thang
Cause where I'm from you got to watch your back
Cause every nigga in the town got a gat
And these hoes, you can't love em
Even though a motherfucker wanta kiss and rub em
Watch your back, cause gats go rat-tat
But mind your own motherfucker and it's like that

Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood

Rollin through the cuts
Dippin down the alleys of killa Cali
Big Ed got that top drop cause it's not cloudy
So I roll on, tank-top with my swoll on
Pullin in sun rays that be peepin through the ozone
I like to chill out, hang out
Cause I'm cool, you know Big Ed is in the mix with the fix
Fool, I seen niggas shakin ivory, hoes shakin asses
But everybody head turn when the coup passes
Who ride, I ride with my 9 ho
I creep as I crept cause I gotta keep that low pro

Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood

This nigga, I am one
Quick to use that A-K gun
On a mark motherfucker who wanta pick a bone
2 to the dome will do your ass home
Huh, ain't no love in my motherfucking hood
Lookin where I'm at, ain't shit turning all good
We need cash cause it's all about the fucking rent
We get the dice and start rollin on the pavement
That's how it is on the first of every month
Sippin gin, and toking off of blunts
Gettin higher than the sky, don't ask why
Young G's from the hood trying to get by

Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood

When I'm rollin through my hood
I see alot of factors, alot of actors
But since the money's low, I see alot of jackers
But where I stay at, it be the east to the bay
But what do I be dippin, it be a 6 to a tre
And what do I be strappin, it be a ace to a K
But I don't love them hoes, that's why I never ever play
In the 9-4, I use to sell dope and holla at the bitch
But it's 9-5 so it's all about me trying to get a grip
14 niggas in a cut tryin to get at the butt but it ain't all good
Cause a nigga like set trippin up in my neighborhood
???? through the cut, I see task hoppin off of the tree
It's all about mine, so it's all about me tryin to get a fee
Can't trust none of these hoes, I leave them hoes at the bus
Cause it's one motherfucking thing in this world that you can't trust
It be a bitch, cause they a snitch, they get you caught up
In this game, heavy locked up, tore up from the floor up
I seen this bitches, these niggas
These niggas all the same
It's a scandel thang, and Silkk won't be caught up in this ghetto game

Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood

I hit the play twice, and then I'm off to a get away
Where I got my shit hid away in the cut
A personal yaht, I snatch a few sacks
About to hit the track to come up on some scraps
Hit the block sideways, perking, trippin
Swervin, I'm servin the shit that I made cause it's tight
All night long nigga's hustle for paper
24-7 nigga's stay on the caper
Gotta get them riches, and you gotta have game yo
Gotta keep lie-lo with them hollow
You see it's still going down
Motherfuckers gettin bucked in the town
The silent sound
Never go away, every other day it's another nigga in the game
Straight passed away
And as well as we all know
It's a little bitty city where motherfuckers bound to get shitty
Now when I roll through my spot
I see niggas like broke, with them Glocks, 17 shots nigga
Hot nigga, pop you nigga, and I just bought a 4-5 in the hood
(in the hood, in the hood)

Like that, check it out fool
It's a ghetto thang, ghetto thang, ghetto thang
And if you ain't from the ghetto you wouldn't understand

Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood
Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood
Rollin through my hood[Mia X:]
Momma mia got 5 motherfuckin reasons
Why you niggas shouldn't step 2 no limit
CCick, clat, duck

[Big Ed:]
Big Ed be puttin down like that
I'm on the attack
Hit your block with the tech & flip you like an acrobat
Relax and get done in
No limit got you suckas runnin
Hustlin, tank rollin, feather weight lifting
King of the hill like the pistons
Listen and get hypnotized
Then they'll realize your mobbs tried to hustle with ride surprise
As I analyze fictional rap chart
Niggas sellin the flea market
As I swell up like Dolly Pardon
Flow like Niagara, floss like dental
Niggas dont get caught up in my detrimentral mental
Alias assassin im blastin ask alot
While tough niggas talk from Richmond to Ottawa
Lyrical combat but we can jump into realm of bookoo guns
No Limit should be a steel mill
Catacombs when I rush
Explode when my vocals hit the west
KL be droppin the bomb tracks
Like terrorists and anvils

[Fiend]
????
Capital F-I- as I live like Incredible Hulk
I love my money in bulks
See im used to the abuse of
Marijuana, smokin coke tryin to reach my quota
Revoking mc's nice as he's
Cause im twice as nice as he's
Its your fears im splittin back they lids
Or the wigs that I live
Die instanly, searchin comin after me
Haven't learned nothin in the galaxy as bad as me
Fatalities, all yall gone be casualities
A formality, droppin dead weight rappers like calories
So casually speakin
Like ?? we beaten
But not preaching
The lyrical reaching gone leave you skiing illegally
And I gets my swerve on
With Mr. Serv On
Gettin a helluva spursion
With KL's and Burbons
Definetly  get my verse on
Got it changed by a Glock
Words that bracing you knot
My shit stay banging like Little Rock

[Kane]

My hustling is sick
Kane & Abel cake makes flips
252 grams be catching ? out each quarter brick
My deliveries obscenity, so niggas these fightin words
Watch Mr. bill collector Hannibal Lector smoke the herb
2 times 187 equals 374
What the mean im gone leave you and that buster you with stankin on the floor
Hope you got your life insurance
This deadly metomorphosis hollow tips ??
Bringing horror flicks to tricks
Raw flicks couldn't see me, if you were lookin at my picture at the post office

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde got no friends P keep the world homely and homicide
My style can't stop it
Got a gat lets drop it
Nice, strictly ice im precise like fuckin fiber optics
Hennessy got me tested
Cut that mask like Wayne Gretsky
Soldiers man desert eagle in my hand keep em' ?? like Dissy Gillepsie
Top cops couldn't arrest me
Niggas who the best be
This no limit soldiers runnin on the tank
Nigga got no time to think
Bustin on you niggas yall stink
I got my shank
The Puerto Rican leave them tweekin
Missles heat seaking
Niggas that couldn't stop me got your amplifier peakin

[Abel:]

Niggas is fake
I piss on you face at your wake (fucking bastard)
Spary paint this shit ain't over on your casket
Preacher man steady sayin thou shall not kill
I wonder if he was there when they killed my nigga Clarence at the hotel
In the city of fiends, young niggas die often
Get your hustle in hell, I left an ounce in your coffin
Young niggas gettin touched with AK's early in the moring
Catch a glimpse of the devil when he dance in New Orleans
Hollow shots make a nigga check in before his curfew
Disrespect me ill hurt you, pass the blunts in a circle

[Mr. Serv On:]
Dolly dolly dip
Wich one of you niggas want this last and final hollow tip (none)
For real from mr bitch killer money maker ho stacker
Stackin more green than the Packers
Nigga jack a Regal rider
Have you bubblin on your saliva like Hannibal Lector
Step up in the sector
UPT ain't the drives
Hit you between your eyes
Crack your bitch thighs
Mr. cap peller
Smile into the eyes of your candy dealer
Big wheeler
Stackin more diamonds that the steelers
Bringing more noise that the Cowboys
Can chop in it like Dennis the born Menace
Dont say a fuckin thang until im finished
And even then respect my blessing
I'll make Allen Iverson adress me as the real question
And niggas know me when I come through
So if im not screaming TRU (T-R-U) nigga im ready to bang at you and you
So fell this hollow tip and get what you get

On the grind tryin' to slang that muthafuckin' shit
Servin' the fiends the ice cream
You mean that crack

Bullets can't man tag, one time for the gat
Can he make it, will he fake it
Fiends call him Betty Crocker

[Master P]
Cause he got the bacon

[Big Ed]
You get a loc like that blueberry dope, that yaho
Choppin' it up like fat, gettin' hit on that pager
Cause it's all about the skrilla, nigga
Pockets gettin' bigga
Pockets gettin' swolled, but gettin' dubbed by a gold digger

[Silkk]
Now some choose to pimp hoes, and some hoes pimp them
Whatever it may be, everybody against them

Chorus 2X

[Master P]
Niggas hittin' the bass, straight playa
But you gotta watch your back for them fuckin' hatas
If I were a football player, i'd probably be Lawrence Taylor
Blockin' these hatas off, be mad
Cause they know Master P's got it goin' man
That's why I fuck your bitch, but she ain't shit
And everybody in the hood know the ho suck dick
But you cause you lame
But like Ice Cube said, "Let's cut out the little man"
You need an ounce of this real game
It ain't a thang to these TRU niggas, cause we let our nuts hang
I got love for you, fool you got love for me
But there's always some sucker talkin' 'bout wrong P
You need to jump off that glass dick
You look like a dope fiend and sound like a bitch
You want it cooked
I got baking soda for your bitch ass, huh
Cause that ho shit won't last

Chorus 2X

[King George]
Comin' from the Bayou, a triple by the dosage
Tryin' to dodge rats, but tend to find cock-roaches
We flip g's, no good deeds
Down on your knees, kidnapped by g's
Forties with the clip, shit float to your forehead
King pay dues, fuck you a dead bitch
Flip pure game, like the Og's taught me
Tryin' spit game when i'm talkin' on a for-ty

Chorus 2X

[Big Ed]
It's nothin' but the G in me
I have a question
Big Ed is on a funky G lesson
Now, how many G's in the house tonight
And how many G's spin them gold thangs tight
It's nothin' but a G thang ba-by
I gotta twank on a fubic, but can you fade me
Nigga, cause Big Ed be like TRU to it
Always wearin' Nikes' cause I just do it
Got more bounce to the ounce
Get you drunk like some liquor
Gotta ???
Cause he's rollin' on my ???, like a weather got my action
Grabbin' on my nuts like my name was Micheal Jackson
So nigga
Who ride, I ride, slide

[Master P]
But they can't touch ya

[Big Ed]
With my TRU niggas on my side

[Master P]
And you know I got 5 on it
But we gotta do this one here for my dead homie

Chorus 2X

[Silkk]
A nigga tip toe through the do'
You know I'm bout 6'4" plus mo'
So I had to get low
And niggas lookin' shady
I shook some shell up in my ass, somebody older
Y'all bitches better pay me
You want me to say it's all good in my hood
Well I can't
And anybody that told you it is, they be lyin'
Cause it ain't
I hopped in my ride, started fish tailin'
Seems I caught a flat, so Silkk started 3-wheelin'

Chorus 2X[Master P]

Oh yeah, and to our enemies
We don't hate you but uh, we got a place for ya
Cause uh

Somebody goin die tonight
No Limit assassins goin ride tonight (What's up Big Ed nigga)
Somebody goin die tonight
No Limit assassins goin ride tonight

Uhhhhhh, ha ha
My motherfuckin guns and my duty nigga
And let me handle my motherfuckin business

I served an ounce of cocain, and now I'm trapped in this game
So much weed to the brain, got you bangin for change
But I'm a No Limit soldier, tattooed in blood
Federal OZ's sold keys and now heroin and drugs
And this game got me trapped cause I've been bustin at bitches
And I've been standin on these projects countin up keys and kits
And these hoes wanna kill me, see me dead cause I'm rollin
And everything that I ride I pay with cash it's not stolen
Now I don't trip on no bitches and I don't trip on no niggas
You wanted the dope and some cain, now how'm I supposed to deliver
I got my game that's my G, I fuck with killers and ballers
I live for today and tonight so nigga fuck tommorow

See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes
And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight
See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes
And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight

[Big Ed]

I'm on my way to N.O. with four keys of cocain
I got murder on my brain with the trunk full of thangs

And I ain't satisfied till all my enemies die

See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes
And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight
See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes

No Limit soldier!
Woo woo!(Chorus - 8x)
Lets take it to the battlefield
To the battlefield

[Big Ed]
Don't talk that mess on whack
You could turn around and catch a slug in your back
Battle rap, say dog I ain't down that
That went out with LL said the ripper's back
Cause now-a-days fools spray with automatics
Leaving eachother lying wet on they back
Over some-thing that they spit on a track
It got me wondering, what happened to rap
If you got a problem player come see me
The one to hear to hear about it on a tape or CD
Especially talk about what you gone do to me
Now you got a answer to the soldiers I feed
I take war to heart boy I don't play any games
I'm the type of soldier rearrange the frame
Respect for support, or it's curtains man
I catch you down bad and put it on your brain, forget about it

(Chorus - 8x)

[Big Ed]
It gets real, haters mess around and get they whole click drilled
But animae, because they got they caps peeled
I guess it's true what they say, coming out for a deal
I'm hear to let you know that I'm not that figure
Unless you looking for the one behind the...
I put this planted chest in lungs and liver
I attack like crocodiles at the end of the river
Dog assassins got to move in silence
Don't you know mercenaries thrive off violence
I got a team of villains that's ready for war
I put the hungry soldiers uncut and raw
You will never see me till I'm in your face
Cock the two and clap it and disappear with no trace
You could mess around with all that yapping
I'm about acting, steel-toes attraction, fool what's happening

(Chorus - 8x)[Crooked Eye]
Say nigga, you talkin to me?
Nigga I know you ain't talkin to me nigga
Yeah I, I ain't bout that talkin nigga

And forever pullin strap, we bout that mess
I'm bout that mess nigga, I'm bout that mess nigga
I'm bout that mess, bout that mess, bout that mess nigga
I'm bout that mess nigga, I'm bout that mess nigga
So bring it on, bring it on, bring it on nigga

Bring it on if ya wanna, I stay ready to ride
I'm goin out like a soldier, I ain't scared to die
Secure the clips in the chopper, cock the firing pin
Grit your teeth, hold your nuts and let the war begin
Squeeze the trigger, buck em all, somebody gots to fall
I'm goin it, comin out wit it or ain't comin out at all
You better kill me, do me in, boy put me to rest
Cause if you don't that homie you stole, we about that mess

[Billy Bavgate]
Yeah I'm bout more mess then the crime up in Oakland
You fuck with me, I leave your chest open
Yeah I'm bout more mess then Joe Pesc'
I'm a Ghost Town nigga puttin one up in your flesh

Dumpin shots like Little Rock, I'm your thug nigga

On my fist you stretch, should have been bout that bout mess

[Mac]
You bout that mess nigga, then represent to the fullest
Put my name on that bullet and pull it
Who wanna ride with me, die with me, Mr. Camoflauge
Me and my niggas we trigger niggas, we do or die

Infiltrate us, we chases so many papers today
Take us to pergutory, we glory but don't ignore me

If you's about throwing things say I'm bout that mess

If you got at least four straps and you wear a vest then
You's about that mess, you's about that mess
It's the Assassin, niggas know me, Richmond baller
Raised in the Bay to be a motherfuckin night crawler
Shot caller, hoes holla, see me in the Impala
Top dollar, spinich, ass ballin like there's no tomorrow
Hollar out the window, uh oh, ohhhh
Cause when you see me, uh oh, ohhhh
Let the shots go, niggas hit the floor
Cause I'm bout that mess, you niggas already know[Big Ed]
My initial's explosive (BOOM!), left my enemies' corpse exposed
Cats when they told ya, now D-Body did the work and I'm loaded
I bust for niggas that down, gat to gat combat military tactics
So watch your set, cause the gat's a constant threat
Bet that I won't have a problem with cueing my killers
I got G's in the hood, and warriorettes slicing they some peelers
Rip the skin off your back, from your neck to your ass crack
Nigga it ain't my body, can't believe that you asked that
T-R-U tatted on my abdomen, been a killer since the eights age of ten
Got the crowds jumping
So what you wanna do, what ya thank
I have skunks that'll match your carcass saying damn that nigga stank
AR fifteens spitting shells like a elephant
Apologies are relevant, haters start protecting put out hits
Cause this is Ed a.k.a. Assassin
Me and my sister Mia X, we just counting cheddar laughing

[Chorus: Fiend, (Big Ed), & {Mia X}]

Some bomb ass click for the latest, hey the greatest
I bring da drama, safe by ya mama
When you leave the house, this is what I been about
Banging and slanging, taking yours and making it mine
Bringing in choke lines, it's my year
Strike fear in ya place when I hit the face
Bow down, bow down just in case I feel like causing problems at your way
Mama don't shake, know I'ma stay
Lay in rest your baby done took em' to the chest
And I be the culprit
The baddest motherfucker south of Army Southern
Fuck ya life, done passed the light, that's all you saw
Now you down, 1 to the 2 to the 3 fuck the numbers
It's a bloody summer, gun runner
Son of a bitch quick to slit your throat
I like some oats at the same time drink the blood of a goat
Now please let me lay happy as hell in the smoke
And let these motherfuckers choke
Off the lyrical, count em' days
Call the paramedics, it's an emergency
I done brung the fucking drama, ya heard me, Serv-On

[Mia X]
I close shop on the block, now
Tow, what you wanna do, I'm coming through
Hell naw, it them bitches now bitch get off me, biggest Mama Mia
Lady Smith & Wesson nine milli heater, wreckin' em'
Always got insubordinate say no you ain't no friend of Mia
You cannot see this ghetto diva, get rich either
So she wants to be a, but she's neither
Get her there, her central plans have been deviated
Tell em' why, her ho styles have yet to be appreciated
She's been waiting to see the fire from a real ho
No doubt who brings the noise like them bitches in a jailhouse
From el jay, or even worse a setback on a cold day
Those who play I hate, let it be known that I regulate
Will steal ya fate after just one rhyme
And chick ya left a buck jump after second line it's my time
So I bust without hesitance, every word man is evidence
Niggas clear the way cause ya lyrically impotent
Soft and mama likes it hard no doubt
I ride with the tank takes shots for the south
So bring the drama nigga

[Fiend & (Mia X)]
Bring da drama, (Find that ass in a ditch) Bring da drama niggaChorus: Fiend (repeat 2X)

[Fiend]
It's F-I-E, O.G. ready to prove that I'm strong enough
Prepared to rip a nigga down if he look at me long enough
I'm supposed to be fucked up with my mental capacity
That's why these killers and they old ladies be coming after me
They won't be no more after me including my body faculity
Look at my name, I'm to blame for all these casualties
No one as bad as me, I search the galaxy
And I'm willing to put up my No Limit royal salary
Go ahead make my manner please if the yapping don't decease
When I stomp, you ???, get up and catch a breeze
I ain't lying I'm horrifying, I'm the bull up in the pit
Full of that shit, and ain't resting till you get your ass whipped
Know what I'm sayin

Chorus

Still keeping it real, smoking weed, drinking hennessey
Every nigga around me that's why none of you niggas can bother me
I'm gettin fucked up so how many wanna ride with me
If you got a blunt get it lighted, come get high with me
I like to smoke till my lungs can't take no more
Got me ducking and diving like I'm strung out on coke
But still one of the most dangerous niggas you ever came across
Better cock my shit and bust until they label you lost
With no remorse, me, Fiend, Big Ed goin be all right
We be ???, come to the show and still gettin high
Talkin bout where my niggas at and where the bitches at
Where the fuck my niggas at, let's get this party started

Chorus

[Big Ed]
Now when I said fuck yall niggas, best believe that I meant it
For every bullet that hit your dome best believe my gat sent it
Niggas talk shit and repent it, cause they know my hollows did shit
I'm back on the streets as a hitman cause my stash is gone I spent it
Gotta jack you for your paper, I'm a No Limit terminator
Hit you like a gladiator, shake you like an alligator
What's up now bitch, when I hit your town get shot or duck down
????? get buck down, two sheds get high no time for showdown
Slow down, I got my gat all in your face
Don't make me sound this bitch off like I'm about to start a race
And leave your head all over the place now that ain't no fun

Chorus

My homegirl Chyna called me at 11:07
Says she has a treat for that will make me feel like heaven
I ain't trippin' cause her ass is tight
Plus it's been a day and a half since I laid the pipe
She got big titties, big ass, thick thighs
Work it so good it'll make a grown man cry
Chocolate, flexible, plus a scorpio
She loves it from the back and she can ride the bucking bronco
How 'bout that there?
Hung up the phone and my dick beat me outta the chair
Shaved, showered, got dressed up in the BM
Got the gat for haters, Jim-hat to catch the semen
Forting on a 40
Got to Chyna's house time to get naughty
So I rung the doorbell, she opened the door, in lingerie
Had fresh food, whip-cream on a silver tray
Walked in locked the door behind me
The high heels that she had on titled up her hiney
I had on sweats so my dick buldged out
She put her in my sweats and said "What's it all about her?"
I said "I come to knock it out"
She made me sit down and straddle me on the couch
Titties in my face, griding on my dick
She started licking on her nipples and rubbin' on her clit
Now she's sucking on her fingers
She has a surprise for me and she can't wait for me to meet her
Wait a mintue, HER?, then the bedroom door opened
The girl that walked out was so hot that she was smokin'
Now my dick is hard as brass coltins
"Oh that's your boy's old lady, I thought that was a golden"
Man the only thought I had was long strokin'
She walked up and spread her pussy wide open
Man high heels do something to a nigga
The way it prompts up everything on a female figure
This was built like a world class winner
Pretty face, caramel, so fine she could be dinner
"Hi, I'm Angie" "Nice to meet you baby"
"Big Ed, huh?" "Shit it's all gravy"
But this my dick was out
And Chyna had that deep pistol working in her mouth
Angie got alittle bit jealous
My girl Chyna's a hot dog, but shit Angie's the relish
They started sharing the dick
Back and forth, back and forth, and Angie kept it
Chyna worked her way behind Angie
Walked to her room, her ass switching in them G-string pannies
Angie sucks a hellafide dick
Why she sucks on the balls, she strokes the meat with a twist
"Oh shit yeah slob on it"
She wrapped her tits around the shaft and she twisted the knobs on em
Titty-fucking while she sucks my dick
But leave it up to Chyna for the real freaking shit
She came out the room with a bag and a grin
I looked at her and said "Let the games begin"
Chyna manuvered Angie on to the floor
Angie kept sucking, facing me on all fours
Chyna started getting Angie from the back
The way Angie sipped I thought she was having a heart attack
Chyna reached in the bag
Pulled out a strap-on dick and stuck her tounge in Angie's ass
Now that's just perverted
"You like that?" "Yeah go ahead and hurt it"
She put on the dick, grabbed Angie's hips
Inserted it, and started working it, and working it
Wear the motherfucking ass out
Angie stopped sucking dick and started biting the couch
Now I'm looking like "OH SHIT!"
Real life porno shit, a bitch banging a bitch
Jumped up and put the condom on my dick
KY'ed Chyna's ass and starting looking for some shit
6 9ing, multiple positions
Everybody cummin', no intermission
Big thick stickin', fuckin' in the kitchen
Whip cream everywhere, everybody lickin'
It went on like this all night
When I'm finished with them, look like they just lost a fight

Chorus:  [Big Ed]  (Mo B. Dick)

[Big Ed]
I got another nigga in the club, macking a bitch
This nigga been hating, cause his ho sucked my dick
This nigga drove a Benz, and his pop's was rich
Square ass nigga always driving, through the hood and shit
Called my voicemail huh, and sait it was on
I guess my big dick, broke up his happy home
But uh, don't hat the player hate the game nigga
As fine as she is, you would of done the same nigga
He soft, he played like a kitten
I laughed to myself, and said oh no he didn't
So I tapped him on his shoulder, said what's happ'nin
He said what's up my nigga, I said no bitch what's happening
He took a step back, and said dog it ain't like that
He jumped I jumped, then I layed him on his back
If you yap we scrap, ain't no escaping that
Ha, Big Ed be putting it down like that

[Hook - 3x][Fiend]
Whomp! Whomp!

Direct to all surviours on the battlefield
Let's hustle up, get blunted up and test you, what the fuck?
Muscle Up, it's very crazy, for all the killings
Humble up, they don't expect like raw dealings, come winter
Bundle up, me and my pistols stay cuddled up
Gone, nigga, Jones nigga, Sleepy Eye from that zone nigga
Boy they bringing lots of guns, check my home and picture
Besides from every crick that's gone split ya
Memphis I'm hypotinzed with it, means some eyes with it
Voice so high with it, 2005 with it
So ride with it or be rolled the fuck over
Fiend's surviving the soldier, grenade thrower

Niggas about to get fucked up
I guess you niggas don't know that I can bucked up
I'm quick to pull the gats, let 'em go, bust bust bust
Stampede on your ass when your fucking with us
I gain the strength of ten men all angeled up
PCP,  scared one droppin' big tank trucks
I'm pumpin' iron at the wake, getting all swolled up
Rip off my shirt, at concerts, cause I'm tatted up
Never worrying about them bustas, my niggas gatted up
Don't step to us, my niggas quick to tear shit up
We lock in down in every town cause we got it solded up
In the hood it's all good, cause they rolling with us
Doing shows at clubs cause I don't give a fuck
You can find me in that bitch fucking booted up
Bust a nigga in his head if he tries to run up
4 is 1, 8 is 0, bitch I stay one up

Chorus [Big Ed] (Fiend)
