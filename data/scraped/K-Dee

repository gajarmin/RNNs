Quick to get the pussy dripping so quit trippin
Like you gotta have a nigga resembling Donnie Simpson
Bitch I'm from the wild wild west fuck them preppy niggas
You need to get with this malt Liquor sipper
Picture me simpin over ya never
How ya figure
I'll be crying over yo ass like aBaby face nigga
Bitch you best to be glad I got 3 strikes
Because back in '85 I'd been done gave your ass a black eye
See I been waving at your ass all week but all
You do is roll your eyes like your shit don't stink
So now it's time for a nigga clown your ass
Because I can tell from the tattoos you's a high class hood rat
Don't want to fuck with niggas in khakis
But ho I bet for the dough
You quick to jack that ass like a 4
So quit fronting on a nigga and lick these and bitch
Hit the road with your fucked up weave.......

(Ice Cube)

How would you like to get a rough nigga rugged and raw
Outlaw rollin' down the shaw
Don't you want a mothafucka that's hard
Or a bitch-made nigga cute as El Debarge?
Do you like negros?
Him and those?
Individuals called criminals?
How'd you figure a West Coast nigga
Drinking liquor gots to know how to dig you
When we dated straight faded
Penetrated Ms. sophisticated
Know daddy hate it
Never met a nigga quite as fly as me
All bottled up in your high society
You want to check my mental
Cause how could a nigga from South Central roll in a Benzo
Spice in ya life is what you need
You're intrigued by the smell of my weed
I represent reality in your world full of lies
And I can see it in your eyes
You worried sick and I'm chillin' (Westside)
Tell your family to fuck off and roll with this villain

(chorus)
Do you like negros, him and those, individuals called criminals?(2x)

(Mack 10)
Who wanna fuck wit it I put it down for real tho
It's Mack 1-0 and let you niggas know I'm gun ho
Baby I guess maybe I can get with your program
With hundred-spoke tonas on my front and back Broham
Hit a lick or two make your whole life a thriller
Make you wanna shake the nerd and come ride with a killa
Hot as sauce out to floss no need to be discreet
I swing the fuck out this bitch til my bumper touch the street
On switches and I'm workin jerkin got ya nigga smirkin
Jack the ass up and down til my back wheels is chirpin
You need to be with me bitch you too fucking bombay
To be on the Shaw with a nigga with a Hyundai
I take you through my neighborhood raise where crime pays
No girbauds no fades just khakis and French braids
And my friends is niggas that know what ends is
In high-top Chucks pushin V-12 Benzes
With hoochy hoes groupie hoes
You know those with a gang of money lolos and penitentiary photos
So shake him now no need of waitin of debatin
Slam the door on them five stars and hop on these Daytons

(K-Dee)

Dee, dee, dee, daddi, daddi, dee, dee, daddi day
I come from the crew I thought you knew we don't play
I see your frowning but I'm clownin' anyway
Can't nobody fade K-Dee baby, baby
I know you're Catholic
But can you have you have dick up in them guts all the way to
These nuts
You're a rich girl far from skeezer
I'm playing broke at the mall with your Visa
You wanna swang with K-Swinger
(When the West is in the house, oh my God! danger)
But take a hit you'll live
But when you hit it ho you got to puff, puff give
Now I hear you giggling
But all I wanna see is asses wiggling and titties jiggling
So what you wanna do?
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Stick to them dicks and balls you're used to
Go ahead and take a big lick
Cause girls look so good on the end of
My dick
That right is it tight?
I know you ain't a dyke
What type of nigga do you like?
Bitch!

(chorus)

(chorus II)
Bitch I'm from the wild, wild west

(chorus)

(chorus II)

Do you like criminals?Anotha day
Dolla
Holla if you hear me
Comin with the bumps in my hoop'
As swoo-woop
Here I am
The mack it's clear I am
K-Dee, so baby get with the program
Damn
What's on the menu
It's about 10 to 5
So let me see what the weather's like
Step outside, glide to my ride, hit the button for the alarm 'chirp-chirp-disarm'
Pull the top back, cock the hammer on my Glock back
I ain't trippin, just lettin' 'em know I ain't slippin
Sippin, on some Lipton Iced Tea flossin
Don't trip, it ain't easy, cause it costs to be the boss
And so, I'm on the hunt
Never front with the cash flow
Hittin' Corna's slow on the go so now you know
My tires are Armor-All'd, spit shined wax on
Tank kinda low so I pulls into Exxon
Give me 10 on six, damn look at baby at pump 4
What you doin with all that rump, ho?
She must have endz, rollin in a benz
Could it be her's, or maybe it's her boyfriend's?
Slid me her number
I wonder if you got a man, cause not a man other than me can get you hotter than
Cayenne pepper
Swept her off her feet when I boned her
Catchin bitches hittin Corna's

Diamond in the back
Sunroof Top
Diggin the scene how the players lean
And to the ho's that be out there strollin
You know I'm rollin
Creepin up on ya
Hittin Corners

Skip to my Lou, took a sip of my brew
Called up my homies and took a trip with my crew
Down to the spot where the ho's all jock
Twenty-four seven around the motherfuckin clock
Tick-tock as they flock in packs
The macks come around while the other's look for sacks
But I'm lookin for the ones that ain't too proud to beg
When I spots 'em, watch 'em, swing from this third leg
Hittin no switches, but still gettin my clown on
Banked a quick left cause there's more of them down on
Crenshaw and Vernon, watch the curb while I'm turnin
Don't wanna scrape them tires, they ain't no Dayton wires
But I still got 'em feenin, leanin like I'm in the '64
But I'm in this coupe and I'm still lettin these tricks know
I'm from that number 1 crew in yo area
I ain't bullshittin, the corners I be hittin'

Diamond in the back
Sunroof Top
Diggin the scene how the players lean
And to the ho's that be out there strollin
You know I'm rollin
Creepin up on ya
Hittin Corners

One time I was rollin deep, I creep with caution
I'm bone it, cause they want it, I don't sleep that often
Slauson make a right cause they got it blocked off
For 3 corners straight up to 58th street
Detour, be sure they ain't on my tail
Bail, what the hell, they gets smoked on the DL
Just let me ride like Dre, and play my music loud
Steady mobbin', heads a bobbin' as I move through the crowd
Slow down, hit the hazards when I cross the train track
My sounds are bumpin' loud enough to make your brain crack
Bazooka Tubes bumpin Ice Cube, nigga make it rough, make it smooth
Yeah, show yo eyes so act like you know
It's 1994 so let this mack through the door
I'm in like Flynn, there ain't no stoppin
Seen my homie Snope, nigga what's poppin?
Chronic smokin, have yo ass chokin
Just about to blaze, damn we had to raise
Cause 5-0 creep my homie peeps so we jetted
Got my 9, plus no time, to be gettin sweated

Diamond in the back
Sunroof Top
Diggin the scene how the players lean
And to the ho's that be out there strollin
You know I'm rollin
Creepin up on ya

Cos I'm ruff, and nigga you can buck these nuts
If you comin with that smooth shit, hard core rules shit
[I make the hoes say 'hay' each and every day
Bitch cos I'm the k-dee, no I'm not a g]
Mothafuckin wannabe mack
[But I'm smooth like that]
I gots ta buck...you...right on up, punk you lucky that cha livin
Cos I'm the unforgiven; I like power, ain't a damn thing funny
[I like pussy and money
And I won't slam like onyx or never ever stutter
But I'm b-b-butter;
Leader of the new school, you hard core fool!]
Nigga make it ruff! [make it smooth!]
[And I'm here]
MAKE IT RUFF [naw, make it smooth.]

Verse Two: K-Dee, Ice Cube

[K-Dee]
You can lick me up and down till I yell stop!
Damn bitch ya missed a drop...cos I don't play when I sway
It's the quicker picker upper;
A pro that moves slow before this ho I'm quick
To dump her; so eeny-meeny-miney-mo, where's my dough?
I gots ta make a livin, I out ta get mo;
Money, and got more nuts for ya honey; so
Come and break me off, this nigga's walkin soft;
It's the smoothness that make niggas move to this;
For you ruffnecks, i'll check you with my tool and shit;
Don't sweat 'em, just let 'em play that hardcore
Role; we still cool, but just make it smooth...

[Ice Cube]
You know what, it's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin under, I'm chocolate thunder;
Ruff as sin, cuts on ya skin
And I blend with the tracks, see I'm black
K-dee is the mack; matter fact
Niggas hit me up with the c's and b's
But you don't wanna fuck wit these
Cos i'll put 'em on ya
And we'll have to wake ya mothafuckin ass up with ammonia
Cos hardcore rap is always on the map and it don't stop
Devoid of pop; and if I drop another smooth hit
It'll still be hard, cos I helped start this shit;

So make it ruff [naw make it smooth!]
Make it ruff! [make it smooth!!]
Make it ruff! [make it smooth!!]
MAKE IT RUFF

[..naw...make it smooth.]
MAKE IT- MAKE IT RUFF

[Naw, make it smooth.]

Verse Three: Ice Cube, K-Dee

I hate when niggas get too fuckin sexy on the track, I'm pro black
[Well I'm a pro-mack.]
I like hittin switches
[I love hittin bitches, cos I'm a player.]
Hard rhyme sayer!
[I thought you knew, but ain't no thang, you knew the way I swang;
Creepin, ain't no sleepin, ain't a damn thing changed; I hit ho after
Ho with this laid-back shit.]
Fool, I kill at will and still can fade that shit; cos it's the
Predator, I edit(?) her, so nigga watch yo step!
[You in a gang like starr, tryina get a rep!]
It ain't no sweat for me to buck buck nigga don't give a fuck; you
Better duck duck or get your ass stuck stuck!
[Don't let the smooth shit fool ya, cos I can get it on; cos I be
Breakin bones like dragonfly jones; quick to put em on ya.]
Don't make me act a fool! nigga, make it ruff!
[Make it smooth!]
[And I'm in here...]

[Naw, make it smooth][Inrto: Dr. Dre Scratching and Cutting quote below]
I know you gonna dig this....

[Verse One: Ice Cube]
Fly girls and fools each and every night
Crowd rocking rhymes, boy, that's alright
Treated like a star as you can see
But just rhyming for the cash money
Keep the crowd rocking for about B.G
New best believe that's C-O-D
Suckers like you don't make no dense
Cause it's all about making those Dollars and sense
Girls on my jack, when I'm up the stage
Reports trying to cluck, put me on the front page
C.I.A. in back of me, and cash money is all specialty
Boys In The Hood keep trying to dig
All girl friends think their heads is big
Promoters at the show trying to run that bull'
But odds got pull, get paid in full
Gold easy record cause you know it's mine
Clean my skiee-so with the FU sign
Rapping all the time on the US Mint
Plus, ring and bring Dead Presidents
TV elect, just want respect
Show me a cheque, I will break your neck
Hardcore, L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all with me
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

[Verse Two: K-Dee]
Homeboy rocked the Mic like no one else
K-Dee introduce yourself, get bounce
Dre rocks the beats, Jinx gets ill for my Posse
Ice Cube writes the rhymes to kill the show
Me breaking freaks, making dough
I was the King of teasers there on attack
You turned the wax, up to the macks
Girls in the place, to get me laid
Rhyme Zones the ace, make sure I'm paid
C.I.A. not with the dumps
Get more attention from the Me Me Amp
West L.A. is where I'm from, not a bum I didn't cum
Get some green by the leopard blues
Don't wear snickers, they'll get you around the way
Think I must ill, cause I love to chill with that dollar bill
Where I go I make that dough
Cold stop at reporter, get toss pesos
Ill, L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all easy in my fist
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

[Interlude]
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Cold rocking the microphone
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Awwww yeah, I hold my own
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Check it out, cause here I go
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Cold making that dough
[Ice Cube] YOU KNOW!!

[Verse Three: Sir Jinx]
Hip-Hop rhymes for the cash money
Sometimes a DJ, sometimes an Emcee
Turned to the cut, but that's alright
Getting paid everyday, getting laid at night
More money made, the more money spent
Making more money than the US Mint
Kick up the bass if you hip to get paying
Aim to get rich, if you know what I'm saying
Calling me a punk, you ain't making a cent
Reaching in your pocket, boy, you're snatching up lent
A.O.A got the beat going, cuts and rhymes keep the cash flowing
Dre is the producer, give the knowledge to him
Bass pumping so HARD leave the place in dim
If Barley was rapping, you knew, he'll get ripped
Cause I'm holding down L.A. like a vice grip
It's money, honey, that's no mistake
Keep Filas on my feet, big mack on plaque
Gold on my fist, my pocket's getting fat
"Why?" - it's like that, it's in my contract
Hip to play if you're hipped to pay
Jinx's spelling with.. a capital J
Death in L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all easy in my fist
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

(*Crowd Went Nuts*)

[Outro]
[Ice Cube] That was def, yeah, yeah, that was def
[Sir Jinx] Yo, can we can paid in this mothafucker..
[Dr. Dre] Rewind it, rewind it, let me hear it
[Sir Jinx] Awww, is it still going?!
[Dr. Dre] That's cool, that's cool* Another rehearsal of Jackin' For Beats

[Intro: K-Dee]
Come here, come here

"I've been fuckin' help the crew"

Get that boy!!

[Ice Cube]
Give me that brew, fool
It's a full time jack move
St. Ides Malt Liquor make the back move
And I'll tell any Tom, Dick and Hank
Who bought Eight Ball, you got ganked
With the black mack the copper
Cause the St Crooked I is so proper
With the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B toss a dope can and a forty
And that's how we'll greet you
Pass you a brew the first time we meet you
You feel dumb cause you didn't know
Ice Cube don't drink that other Bear no more
Drink some and you won't change back
You'll say - "I ain't never drunk a Bear like that"
Off the end of the bottle you'll choke
Short Dog is in the house - "Yo, pass the Coke"
And if you wanna come up
Pull to the store and get out and then run up
Go to the counter with your five
And buy a fourty of the St. Ides

[Outro]
Awww yeah
Awww yeah[Intro]
Spoken:
"After evaluating all the competition, after many, many years of getting my game right
I finally recognize, and you should, too."

[Verse 1]
Who'd ever thought it would happen?
Got them hands clapping
Laid back rapping
Nigger, what's happening?

It ain't nobody but that undercover down low
Bro
With more dough
Than the average Joe Schmoe

I'm not a G
But gotta be
The Freshest MC in the World
You know I gots to get it, girl

Because I need it
Not conceited
But convinced
Ever since I was a minor
Bumping girls finer
Than Janet

And It
Don't stop
Till
I say it's time to chill
I gots to get a meal
Still the same person, never tripped with my ego
Plus we go way back and homies don't play that

It's not a day that goes by
That I can deny that I'm fly
You gots to ask why
By the way
Butter not Parkay
It's me

[Hook]
(female vocal) "Got to be the freshest MC
Hee Heeeeee"
I'm the freshest MC in the World
(female vocal) "And it has got to be me
Hee Heeeeee"
I'm the freshest MC in the World

[Verse 2]
You heard the rest, the best they all claimed to be
Fame to me ain't nothing
Got'em all fronting

Now who's the baddest?
Be glad it's not K-Dee
Like a baby, that's precious
I'm known to be the freshest

I'm international
Cashing more checks
Than Knicks
With no tricks
Up my sleeve
Why not believe
In me? Cause that's who I got to be
It wouldn't make sense
To represent without confidence

And got more from where that came from
It's a shame some don't know
So that leaves more

Room for me
Soon to be
The talk of your town
Underground
And love it by the pound

So raise your hand if you're sure
Or get in where you fit in
They all want to sit in
On this, cause this is where it's at
In fact
I got to be free
I got to be me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm world wide, well known
For wheeling
And dealing
From the US, I stray up to New Zealand

I must confess, the best is yet to come
Some try to doubt, but now I'm out and set to run
Game like Emmitt Smith
To the limit
With funky ass hits to keep you rolling more spliffs

I can't be kept down
Making niggers step down
Recognize
Eyes open wide as I move inside
The center
Been into the game since 84 Live
Now no more nine to five

I'm too much for the average, can't be touched
With a ten-foot pole, and with more Soul
Than De La
May I continue?
Send you
On a trip with K to the Dee
See
How sweet
This beat it is on
The smooth T. I. P

[Hook X 2](WC)
Say ho I got way more dick than them niggas rolling your lexos

Bitch!

Bitch I'm from the wild, wild west

(chorus)

(chorus II)

Do you like criminals?Anotha day
Dolla
Holla if you hear me
Comin with the bumps in my hoop'
As swoo-woop
Here I am
The mack it's clear I am
K-Dee, so baby get with the program
Damn
What's on the menu
It's about 10 to 5
So let me see what the weather's like
Step outside, glide to my ride, hit the button for the alarm 'chirp-chirp-disarm'
Pull the top back, cock the hammer on my Glock back
I ain't trippin, just lettin' 'em know I ain't slippin
Sippin, on some Lipton Iced Tea flossin
Don't trip, it ain't easy, cause it costs to be the boss
And so, I'm on the hunt
Never front with the cash flow
Hittin' Corna's slow on the go so now you know
My tires are Armor-All'd, spit shined wax on
Tank kinda low so I pulls into Exxon
Give me 10 on six, damn look at baby at pump 4
What you doin with all that rump, ho?
She must have endz, rollin in a benz
Could it be her's, or maybe it's her boyfriend's?
Slid me her number
I wonder if you got a man, cause not a man other than me can get you hotter than
Cayenne pepper
Swept her off her feet when I boned her
Catchin bitches hittin Corna's

Diamond in the back
Sunroof Top
Diggin the scene how the players lean
And to the ho's that be out there strollin
You know I'm rollin
Creepin up on ya
Hittin Corners

Skip to my Lou, took a sip of my brew
Called up my homies and took a trip with my crew
Down to the spot where the ho's all jock
Twenty-four seven around the motherfuckin clock
Tick-tock as they flock in packs
The macks come around while the other's look for sacks
But I'm lookin for the ones that ain't too proud to beg
When I spots 'em, watch 'em, swing from this third leg
Hittin no switches, but still gettin my clown on
Banked a quick left cause there's more of them down on
Crenshaw and Vernon, watch the curb while I'm turnin
Don't wanna scrape them tires, they ain't no Dayton wires
But I still got 'em feenin, leanin like I'm in the '64
But I'm in this coupe and I'm still lettin these tricks know
I'm from that number 1 crew in yo area
I ain't bullshittin, the corners I be hittin'

Diamond in the back
Sunroof Top
Diggin the scene how the players lean
And to the ho's that be out there strollin
You know I'm rollin
Creepin up on ya
Hittin Corners

One time I was rollin deep, I creep with caution
I'm bone it, cause they want it, I don't sleep that often
Slauson make a right cause they got it blocked off
For 3 corners straight up to 58th street
Detour, be sure they ain't on my tail
Bail, what the hell, they gets smoked on the DL
Just let me ride like Dre, and play my music loud
Steady mobbin', heads a bobbin' as I move through the crowd
Slow down, hit the hazards when I cross the train track
My sounds are bumpin' loud enough to make your brain crack
Bazooka Tubes bumpin Ice Cube, nigga make it rough, make it smooth
Yeah, show yo eyes so act like you know
It's 1994 so let this mack through the door
I'm in like Flynn, there ain't no stoppin
Seen my homie Snope, nigga what's poppin?
Chronic smokin, have yo ass chokin
Just about to blaze, damn we had to raise
Cause 5-0 creep my homie peeps so we jetted
Got my 9, plus no time, to be gettin sweated

Diamond in the back

(Westsii-iide!!)[Inrto: Dr. Dre Scratching and Cutting quote below]
I know you gonna dig this....

[Verse One: Ice Cube]
Fly girls and fools each and every night
Crowd rocking rhymes, boy, that's alright
Treated like a star as you can see
But just rhyming for the cash money
Keep the crowd rocking for about B.G
New best believe that's C-O-D
Suckers like you don't make no dense
Cause it's all about making those Dollars and sense
Girls on my jack, when I'm up the stage
Reports trying to cluck, put me on the front page
C.I.A. in back of me, and cash money is all specialty
Boys In The Hood keep trying to dig
All girl friends think their heads is big
Promoters at the show trying to run that bull'
But odds got pull, get paid in full
Gold easy record cause you know it's mine
Clean my skiee-so with the FU sign
Rapping all the time on the US Mint
Plus, ring and bring Dead Presidents
TV elect, just want respect
Show me a cheque, I will break your neck
Hardcore, L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all with me
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

[Verse Two: K-Dee]
Homeboy rocked the Mic like no one else
K-Dee introduce yourself, get bounce
Dre rocks the beats, Jinx gets ill for my Posse
Ice Cube writes the rhymes to kill the show
Me breaking freaks, making dough
I was the King of teasers there on attack
You turned the wax, up to the macks
Girls in the place, to get me laid
Rhyme Zones the ace, make sure I'm paid
C.I.A. not with the dumps
Get more attention from the Me Me Amp
West L.A. is where I'm from, not a bum I didn't cum
Get some green by the leopard blues
Don't wear snickers, they'll get you around the way
Think I must ill, cause I love to chill with that dollar bill
Where I go I make that dough
Cold stop at reporter, get toss pesos
Ill, L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all easy in my fist
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

[Verse Three: Sir Jinx]
Hip-Hop rhymes for the cash money
Sometimes a DJ, sometimes an Emcee
Turned to the cut, but that's alright
Getting paid everyday, getting laid at night
More money made, the more money spent
Making more money than the US Mint
Kick up the bass if you hip to get paying
Aim to get rich, if you know what I'm saying
Calling me a punk, you ain't making a cent
Reaching in your pocket, boy, you're snatching up lent
A.O.A got the beat going, cuts and rhymes keep the cash flowing
Dre is the producer, give the knowledge to him
Bass pumping so HARD leave the place in dim
If Barley was rapping, you knew, he'll get ripped
Cause I'm holding down L.A. like a vice grip
It's money, honey, that's no mistake
Keep Filas on my feet, big mack on plaque
Gold on my fist, my pocket's getting fat
"Why?" - it's like that, it's in my contract
Hip to play if you're hipped to pay
Jinx's spelling with.. a capital J
Death in L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all easy in my fist
And I like that money with me

Hahahaha, baby baby!
[Hahah ya like that]

[Naw, make it smooth]

Verse One: Ice Cube, K-Dee

I make niggas say 'woof' cos I'm in the coupe with no roof
[Ya smell like somethin 90-proof]
Cos I'm ruff, and nigga you can buck these nuts
If you comin with that smooth shit, hard core rules shit
[I make the hoes say 'hay' each and every day
Bitch cos I'm the k-dee, no I'm not a g]
Mothafuckin wannabe mack
[But I'm smooth like that]
I gots ta buck...you...right on up, punk you lucky that cha livin
Cos I'm the unforgiven; I like power, ain't a damn thing funny
[I like pussy and money
And I won't slam like onyx or never ever stutter
But I'm b-b-butter;
Leader of the new school, you hard core fool!]
Nigga make it ruff! [make it smooth!]
[And I'm here]
MAKE IT RUFF [naw, make it smooth.]

Verse Two: K-Dee, Ice Cube

[K-Dee]
You can lick me up and down till I yell stop!
Damn bitch ya missed a drop...cos I don't play when I sway
It's the quicker picker upper;
A pro that moves slow before this ho I'm quick
To dump her; so eeny-meeny-miney-mo, where's my dough?
I gots ta make a livin, I out ta get mo;
Money, and got more nuts for ya honey; so
Come and break me off, this nigga's walkin soft;
It's the smoothness that make niggas move to this;
For you ruffnecks, i'll check you with my tool and shit;
Don't sweat 'em, just let 'em play that hardcore
Role; we still cool, but just make it smooth...

[Ice Cube]
You know what, it's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin under, I'm chocolate thunder;
Ruff as sin, cuts on ya skin
And I blend with the tracks, see I'm black
K-dee is the mack; matter fact
Niggas hit me up with the c's and b's
But you don't wanna fuck wit these
Cos i'll put 'em on ya
And we'll have to wake ya mothafuckin ass up with ammonia
Cos hardcore rap is always on the map and it don't stop
Devoid of pop; and if I drop another smooth hit
It'll still be hard, cos I helped start this shit;

So make it ruff [naw make it smooth!]
Make it ruff! [make it smooth!!]
Make it ruff! [make it smooth!!]
MAKE IT RUFF

[..naw...make it smooth.]
MAKE IT- MAKE IT RUFF

[Naw, make it smooth.]

Verse Three: Ice Cube, K-Dee

I hate when niggas get too fuckin sexy on the track, I'm pro black
[Well I'm a pro-mack.]
I like hittin switches
[I love hittin bitches, cos I'm a player.]
Hard rhyme sayer!
[I thought you knew, but ain't no thang, you knew the way I swang;
Creepin, ain't no sleepin, ain't a damn thing changed; I hit ho after
Ho with this laid-back shit.]
Fool, I kill at will and still can fade that shit; cos it's the
Predator, I edit(?) her, so nigga watch yo step!
[You in a gang like starr, tryina get a rep!]
It ain't no sweat for me to buck buck nigga don't give a fuck; you
Better duck duck or get your ass stuck stuck!
[Don't let the smooth shit fool ya, cos I can get it on; cos I be
Breakin bones like dragonfly jones; quick to put em on ya.]
Don't make me act a fool! nigga, make it ruff!
[Make it smooth!]
[And I'm in here...]

Spoken:
"After evaluating all the competition, after many, many years of getting my game right
I finally recognize, and you should, too."

[Verse 1]
Who'd ever thought it would happen?
Got them hands clapping
Laid back rapping
Nigger, what's happening?

It ain't nobody but that undercover down low
Bro
With more dough
Than the average Joe Schmoe

I'm not a G
But gotta be
The Freshest MC in the World
You know I gots to get it, girl

Because I need it
Not conceited
But convinced
Ever since I was a minor
Bumping girls finer
Than Janet

And It
Don't stop
Till
I say it's time to chill
I gots to get a meal
Still the same person, never tripped with my ego
Plus we go way back and homies don't play that

It's not a day that goes by
That I can deny that I'm fly
You gots to ask why
By the way
Butter not Parkay
It's me

[Hook]
(female vocal) "Got to be the freshest MC
Hee Heeeeee"
I'm the freshest MC in the World
(female vocal) "And it has got to be me
Hee Heeeeee"
I'm the freshest MC in the World

[Verse 2]
You heard the rest, the best they all claimed to be
Fame to me ain't nothing
Got'em all fronting

Now who's the baddest?
Be glad it's not K-Dee
Like a baby, that's precious
I'm known to be the freshest

I'm international
Cashing more checks
Than Knicks
With no tricks
Up my sleeve
Why not believe
In me? Cause that's who I got to be
It wouldn't make sense
To represent without confidence

And got more from where that came from
It's a shame some don't know
So that leaves more

Room for me
Soon to be
The talk of your town
Underground
And love it by the pound

So raise your hand if you're sure
Or get in where you fit in
They all want to sit in
On this, cause this is where it's at
In fact
I got to be free
I got to be me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm world wide, well known
For wheeling
And dealing
From the US, I stray up to New Zealand

I must confess, the best is yet to come
Some try to doubt, but now I'm out and set to run
Game like Emmitt Smith
To the limit
With funky ass hits to keep you rolling more spliffs

I can't be kept down
Making niggers step down
Recognize
Eyes open wide as I move inside
The center
Been into the game since 84 Live
Now no more nine to five

I'm too much for the average, can't be touched
With a ten-foot pole, and with more Soul
Than De La
May I continue?
Send you
On a trip with K to the Dee
See
How sweet
This beat it is on
The smooth T. I. P

[Hook X 2][Talking K-Dee]
Call me if you change your mind

[Devin]
I see you like takin your chances
But if your nigga knew that you do butt-naked dances
And runnin my bath and rubbin soap on my feet
Smokin my meat, while I'm smokin a sweet
And we losin his mind, thinkin bout doin a crime
The way you lick on my nutts and make me bust two at a time
You persuing my penis I seen this happen before
We fuck for bout a month and we ain't laughin no more
Then you start to get just a little curious
I don't call in two days and you take the shit serious
We can get crunk smoke weed and shit
But I rather you just call when you need some dick
There's a whole bunch of hoes out there like you
Who love to fuck and suck dick too
Gotta dip dip dive dive what can I say
She try to hit' em all inside of one day

(Chorus- Devin)
But ah, I can stick around and keep you company
Or you can spend the night if it was up to me
You can change him but you can't change me
Cause you know i rather fuck than watch t.v

Girl, I can stick around and keep you company
Or you can spend the night if it was up to me
Girl, you can change him but you can't change me
Cause you know I rather fuck than watch t.v

[Talking K.B.]
Naw you ain't got to cut the t.v. on
Why don't you just stand up and model for me

[K-Dee]
I can tell you like niggas sportin rings and lacs
Got me spittin not hittin with no strings attached
You got a man, I understand I'm cool with it
You wanna look cause a nigga don't know what to do with it
Thats why I get it, sexy outfits like french maids
Got you hollin my name with every inch laid
While I'm, fuckin I'm thinkin of ways of gettin paid
That night you was suckin, damn thats why I stayed
Now you mad cause I played more fields than Kim
Got you sayin I wish you were more like him
Ain't that a bitch, expectin me to oil you
Wine and dine your ass cause he swore you
What I look like washin your back while you shower
I ain't the nigga for leavin letters I'm sending flowers
Tryin to arch my ways, damn thats funny to me
You can change him but you can't change me

(Chorus- K-Dee) x2

[K.B.]
I lay these hoes, slay these hoes
Play these hoes, never pay these hoes
Between bitches and hoes man they really ain't shit
Some of yall givin them dick, you givin them rent money
You fuckin with him because he treats you nice
To me you a ho he'll make you his wife
He takin you shoppin and now you out boppin
For a nigga like me who talkin bout knockin
That ass on the first night, the comfort inn
You got a man at home, shit I'll be your friend
I don't need a bitch all attached to me
Cause I use these hoes then lose these hoes
Abuse these hoes for owning my dick
I'm beatin it up you nuttin too quick
I'm only out for one thang and its plan to see
You may have changed him but you can't change me

(Chorus- K.B.) x2

[Talking K.B.]
You know what I'm sayin
I know you listenin
You know I want to be up in that pussy right now
Let me come by and just dick ya down
I'm trippin, but I'm trippin cause I know you listenin
Huh, when you ridin with your boyfriend or whatever just act like it ain't you
Thats what I'm talkin bout, I ain't gone trip off that shit either
Naw naw, you having good pussy ain't got nothing to do with this (Laughing)

Man it ain't no thang
So why you playin' games, trick you know my name
Oh, am I talking loud?
What you talking bout?
And what you doing out, on my paper route (bitch)
You wanna know if we can still kick it
But can you help a young nigga get a meal ticket
Shit I can do better by myself
What's happenin'? Every motherfucker I know is platnum (Westsiiiide!)
And ain't nobody gonna sw-i-itch
And go broke for a b-i-itch
The westside is r-i-ich
So everybody get the d-i-ick (ha ha ha)

Shine y'all (bling) fat rocks that'll blind y'all
Nothing comes free, how many times must I remind y'all
Tricks taking me shoppping (what?)
Shoes size 10 (what?)
Break a nigga off some ends, bald dubs for them Benz (what?)
A panda and a parrot want the lobster with the shrimp
They way the jockin', keep my pockets swollen like a blimp
Smokin' hemp, mashin' low key with the windows tinted
Breakin' they neck to see who in it
The game is implamented to the fullest
So nice, see me roll like dice
Whey they spot me on the g-o
Makes them all want to know...

Verse 3:
Baby please, got more cheese than Kraft
Singin' autograph, leather coat like Shaft
Arrivin' at the club, hit a false sub
Me, Ice Cube, Mack 10 and that nigga Dove (Westsiiide)
Parlyin' like stars, Hennesy at the bar
No need to announce cause hoes know who we are
Then I see her freakin', peakin' from afar
How bizarre she remind me of something like R.(what)
Kelly, damn, ass shakin' like jelly
Ready to be spread, open wide and dick fed
All on my niggys it wasn't hard to detect it
Know she love criminals and wanted to get connected
Say no mo, and made our way to the door
Tip the valay, pull up Mercedes
Hopped in, it's goin' down
Baby hold on, I can hear them in the line start to say as we rode on

Had niggas on her like decals buyin' her jewells
Cause the ass was like booyah
She was the perfect bitch
Let her tell it but the ho was full of so much bullshit
I could smell it
And I could tell she was a no good ho
Cause she always want to meet the niggas that I know (like who?)
First Cube, K-Dee and I bet
If you let me mention Pooh
Then the bitch I'll get soakin wet
Wantin' to do it just to say she done it
Let him nut on her stomach
Cause he got a five hunnid
Benzo(on Lorenzos) but you know how hoes is
They itchin' fo the chickens and the niggas in show biz
With out the chips no dips or the hotteys
But 10 I'll kick a bitch like he doin' karate
In the body round house to the ribs with the gangsta boots
Man I brakes they ass off to the roots
This H.O.E.K. all muthafuckin day
And wouldn't have it no other way
So lock the door hit the floor
And if you hear any noise
You know is that nigga Mack 10 nuttin up on a ho

[Ice Cube]
I'm a ho killa
I'm a ho killa
[K-Dee] H.O.E.K. all muthafuckin day
[Ice Cube]
I'm a ho killa
I'm a ho killa
[K-Dee] H.O.E.K. all muthafuckin day (X3)[Intro]
{Door bell rings}
Ms. Parker: Oh, hi Darryl
K-Dee: How you doing Ms. Parker?
Ms. Parker: Fine...Ricky's not here
K-Dee: Oh...can I talk to you for a minute?
Ms. Parker: Well...oh, alright. Come on in

[Verse One]
God damn, ma'am
Can I take a bite of the ham-hock?
My cock is like a rock
Your son is like my brother
And with your wrinkled pussy you can be my lover
And I'll smother that shit like a biscuit
And have you sprung with the head of my dilznic
Won't treat you like a ho on Figueroa
It's K-Dee the American Gigolo
And a nigga know you like what I write
Used to spend the night just to see you in tights
Working out to that bitch Jane Fonda
Ms. Parker may I call you Yolanda?
Cause you can see, I'm all grown up
And I got this player shit all sewn up
You five years from the 5-0, I'm twenty fo'
And I thought you should know

[Hook] {x2}
I'm into you now, into you now
Into you now, into you my black baby

[Verse Two]
You're buck wild like a horse
Divorce
And wanna get back in the mix of course
An old ass freak, trying to play chic
Don't worry about your son cause we can sneak
To the mozzy
To the wozzy
Can I help you with those groceries?
I love the way you cook
I love the way you look
I'm hooked, I feel like a crook
Or a cat burglar
Pussy murderer
Look at look at her
She's what I prefer
I can picture you
With a dick or two
In your mouth
You're from the south
You like it the old fashion way
But Ms. Parker please
Hands and knees
So I can squeeze
These
T.I.T.S
We'z out
I already got the room key
To the cozy spot that's hot where you can do me
To see you naked is a dream come true
So bring your ass over, oooh

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
It was on and I wrecked it
But to tell you the truth it wasn't what I expected
A little too loose from all that abuse from your ex
No more sex
I think I had enough, but we can be friends and stuff
Girl, I know it's rough
And we can have dinner
But you gotta stop blowing up my pager like the World Trade Center
Enter The Dragon, I thinking 'bout tagging
Your daughter, she's younger
And she hungers
For a father figure
My nuts are bigger than any other nigga
She let dick her
I think you should know
I think you a ho
And, I think I better go
I hope you are stronger
But to tell you the truth I'm no longer

[Hook]

[Outro: K-Dee talking]
Get the fuck out my face. I can't fade you no more. You're too old for me. I can't even fuck with you. Well peep...is your daughter home? Well tell  her to come down stairs. Yeah. Well look...give her my pager number and tell her to page me. Yeah. Tell Ricky I came by* Another rehearsal of Jackin' For Beats

[Intro: K-Dee]
Come here, come here

"I've been fuckin' help the crew"

Get that boy!!

[Ice Cube]
Give me that brew, fool
It's a full time jack move
St. Ides Malt Liquor make the back move
And I'll tell any Tom, Dick and Hank
Who bought Eight Ball, you got ganked
With the black mack the copper
Cause the St Crooked I is so proper
With the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B toss a dope can and a forty
And that's how we'll greet you
Pass you a brew the first time we meet you
You feel dumb cause you didn't know
Ice Cube don't drink that other Bear no more
Drink some and you won't change back
You'll say - "I ain't never drunk a Bear like that"
Off the end of the bottle you'll choke
Short Dog is in the house - "Yo, pass the Coke"
And if you wanna come up
Pull to the store and get out and then run up
Go to the counter with your five
And buy a fourty of the St. Ides

[Outro]
Awww yeah
Awww yeah[Intro]
Girl: Is it good? Do you like that?
Barry White sounding dude: Ladies and gentlemen. We have a young lady making her way to the mic with some big ass motherfucking lips. She's gonna sing a song that's gonna blow your socks off. But first...it's that nigga K-Dee. Sho' yo' right

[Verse One]
You make me woo-woo-woo
When you do what you do to me
The K to the Dee
Kissing on my naval
But wait one goddamn second
Do my mic need checking? (Oh yes)
So check one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
My balls are blue, they blue, they blue, they blue
So what you gon' do is take a trip down south
Blow my trumpet as I dump it in your mouth
And you can work me like a Slurpee
Damn, I'm jerking it must be working
Putting on the hits, the best thing since grits
Girl I got the shits fo' ya
Sounding like the 5th Symphony
And I'm glad that you ain't no kin to me
Cause if you was my cousin you'd still be a trick
So get the lick

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
And make the music with your mouth bitch
(K-Dee baby!)
And make the music with your mouth bitch
"The art of sucking dick"
And make the music with your mouth bitch
(K-Dee baby!)
And make the music with your mouth bitch
(Ho, you can't be his lady)

[Verse Two]
I like when you bob and weave when you bob
I grab your weave
Girl, you can leave
When the job is done
My balls are like Lays
Bet you can't eat just one
You start to hum (hummmmm)
I'm feeling numb
Here I come, here I come, here I kitty come come
Red rum
Ready to tear up shit
While you're looking for a place to spit
Now I appreciate your soup coolers
On the one shot, big black automatic pee shooter
Rolling down the street no matter what the day is
You can blow for Miles like Davis
Ready?
No I won't Wreck like Teddy
Shooting for the stars but watch the parked cars
The radio ain't go nothing on this
Ghetto kisses like this

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
You said you never do it
Blew it for the first time
If I must say it was dope like my first rhyme
You get a nut
I stuff you like a Twinkie
And certainly
You love this smoked beef jerky
The flavor of the month so won't you come and taste me
You want a lick, got more Dick than Tracey
Just make the music, don't come with no cheat note
Just experience my version of deep throat
Get your knees dirty
Fo' about thirty
Minutes or more like Prince I'll adore
Your head in my lap, up and down
Bobbing
Doing a good job and
Slopping on my nogging
Never will admit it
That you done did it
Scared to say you suck dick
Know you straight with it
It's all good cause I know that you a pro with them knees on the flo'
And here we go

[Hook]

Babe you gon' love it {x6}[Intro]
You could feel all the tension building up from the convention as the hustlers began to arrive. There must've been 9,000 or more that came through the door, the time was 11:55

[Hook 1]
Baller, baller, baller can you come out to play?
Taking hoes out, always have to pay
I eat and I drink, free load everyday
And get the pussy anyway

[Verse One]
Never was a baller, never was a trick
Still had hoes on the dilznick
24/7
Sneaking dumb bitches in the house
While daddy would sleep on the couch
Had to tip toe, creep real slow
Damn, we made it, now it's time to fade it
She made a lot of noise so listen here buttercup
You're gonna have to shut the fuck up cause
Daddy don't like me fucking in the crib
Cause nine months later the baby needs a bib
For 18 years you'll be in my hair
Now I'm smarter than the average Huggy Bear
So go tell Starsky, go tell Hutch, I'm going dutch
Get these nuts
And if I needed some pussy all I had to do was caller
But no, I never was a baller

[Hook 2]
"I never have I never will" - Snoop Doggy Dogg
"Well I have never"
"See even though I got muscle that ain't my hustle" - Ice Cube 'What Can I Do (Remix)'
Never was a baller
"[?] pimp will slap every last bit of dog shit up out ya nigga"
"See even though I got muscle that ain't my hustle"
(K-Dee baby!)

[Verse Two]
Don't like school came up with a full cough
Can't wait till my moms pull off
Cause Ice Cube is coming over and we're both ditching
Eating cereal in the kitchen
Can't wait for the phone to ring
And bring yo' cousin with the dope ass figure to get with my nigga
So we can parlay in the covers
Back then we didn't have to use rubbers
Just let it fly on the mattress (god damn)
But here comes the bad actress
My ex-girlfriend standing on my lawn, once again it's on
I sing this song
"Why can't we be friends? Why can't we be friends? Why can't we be friend?
Hon. And do a two on one."
Yo I never was a baller
No never, no never
"I never have I never will"
Because I'm much too clever

[Hook 1]

[Verse Three]
Now a baller is the one who flaunts being rich
He flaunts his car, his doe just so he can get a bitch
But no not this kid, this is all I did
Just shoot game and then the boots came
That's how I played 'em as I laid 'em on the flo'
I dick 'em, dick 'em down till scream and scream for mo'
I make my own doe so a ho could never get mine
Cause see I drove a bucket, they still let me fuck it
Just 18, fresh outta high school
Wasn't thinking about college cause I had street knowledge
Wasn't in a gang, couldn't bang so I didn't
My mouth stayed dry from all the game I was spittin'
To a honeydip till honey stripped to the nude
Then food came up and it fucked up my mood
Talking about a movie and a nice dinner yo
You better pop some popcorn and rent a video
Because I never get done I do the doing on the slimmy
Especially for them hoes that's yelling gimmie gimmie
I kick 'em to the curb, they deserve to be abused
I never was a baller cause ballers get used

"I never have I never will"
"Big baller from around the way"
Never was a baller
"Big baller from around the way"
"Big baller from around the way"
Never was a baller
"Big baller from around the way"

[Hook 1]

"Big baller from around the way"Devin:
Uh, rollin' car not stolen
Probably never will be it's much too old and
Smokin' weed feelin' fine
In my Nightville '79

I smoke weed I drink brew
That's all I rap about cause shit that's all I do
Some people get mad cause I smoke in front of my kids
Well I also wipe they ass when they piss and shit
I treat a woman like a queen and a bitch like a slut
But I tend to make 'em both wipe off my dick when I nut
I keep a whole bunch of bitches from Brawlway to Bisanet
A bitch to buy me weed a bitch to buy me beer and cigarettes
A ho to help me with music have her ass jacked up
In my vocal booth throw my mic doing backups
She likes my old school Porshe
She like my old school knowledge
But most of all she like my special gold tooth polish
And she's bout it
If I want it then I got it
We'll be goin' off to college
I be givin' that pussy plenty mileage
I be nuttin' on your bitch while I'm rubbin' on her tits
She be suckin' on my dick
I stuck it then I split

Hook
Keep in mind
Peace of mind
Takin' it a day at a time
Stayin' high
To ease my mind
Wavin' at every bitch that goes by

K-Dee:
Ya see my organization is gettin' stronger
See we ain't for that bullshit no longer
Devin and K-Dee
Never the less we
Keep the bud handy sip the finest French brandy
Jewels be imported don't fuck with the rinky dinky
Rock Ice like Berg Slim a couple stones on each pinky
Never fakin' but makin' boyfriends becomes exs
Kick to the curb see we swerve in a Lexus
Ta-dow
How ya like us now
Got niggas sayin' "God DAMN" got white boys sayin' "Wow"
The way we put it down,hum, quite impressive
A cheese by the pound, damn so obsessive
You niggas need to stop thinkin' I'm a hater
Mad because I spit more game than a commentator
As long as your heads bobbin'
Your girls hearts throbbin'
Hit me with the dub when you see me out mobbin'

Hook

K.B.:
I fuck these hoes skinny or swole
He bitchin' bout ugly toes
You ain't fuckin' her feet fuck the ho with your eyes closed
Shit, I showed these bitches what they pussy made for
Especially a big ? Carter lookin' ass ho
Bitch name ? fuckin' pooh big Shiela
Big country ass ho with a body like a two liter
I feed her peter
She give me everything I need
I get beer by the cases and a big ole' bag a weed
Cause she love hustlin' Kelvin
I leave her with more blue notes than Melvin
Makes me a hamsandwich then I'm bailin'
Out like a felon
Something metal lock lemon
These hoes got tricks but from me all they get is dick
And a whole bunch of lies that I spit
? flew up in these bitches I leave them hoes sick
We all know they ain't shit
And so I'm out to get rich
And if I hit
The bitch thick
