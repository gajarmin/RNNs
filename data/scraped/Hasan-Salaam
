[Intro]:
Not every Zionist is Jewish
And not every Jew is a Zionist

This is for Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
It's about time we globalized the intifada
Listen close I've got six words for Obama
Long live Palestine
Long live Gaza
Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
It's about time we globalized the intifada
Listen close I've got six words for Obama
Long live Palestine, Long live Gaza

[Verse 1: Lowkey]

The government supports the people of the UK didn't
Zionism is not compatible with Judaism - the hijacked faith
The state is misrepresenting
Israel equals misplacement and ethnic cleansing
I know I'm on a list, for being more verbal, curse every Zionist since Theodor Herzl
Balfour was not a wise man
Shame on Rothschild
Between them the monster they created has gone wild

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 2:Tamer Naffar (DAM)]

We are people who were sieged by the enemy
Betrayed by our brothers
You won't feel heroic [?]
Withdrawal from Iraq, like a locust invasion
Left only destruction
No punishment
How many mouths were silenced?
How many mothers left devastated?
My freedom begins when the one who took it pays the price
Mr. Judge, open your eyes, open your ears
How many evidences scream against him...
Give me my freedom, and tie up his hands

[Verse 3: The Narcicyst]

Tears to laughter
Our children don't fear disaster
Living near the master
Clear the facts
Hear the casket
We rap and we die from bombastic times
Loons have to hide
Summer days in the thunder blaze
They merk their dreams like Theodor Herzl screams
And the UN and 48 Third Intifada
From mothers, daughters
Sons martyred and empty fathers

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 4: Eslam Jawwad]

The right of returned
A whole people got imprisoned
Bullets are falling like rain
Rain is falling hard
Breaths are cut
[?]
Take the bird out of its cage
Go fly away
Go show my blood to the world
This is my sin
I'm waiting for my Savior, for Isa
The only hope I have left is my God

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 5: Hich-Kas]

Although they always lie in the tv, i was watching the news
It showed how bricks fell on kids and mother’s tears fell on the ground
The kids are sweet
His aim was on a child who just leant how to walk, and they held his hand
He loaded, and shoot
A while ago i was seeing scenes like this in front of me
Ah, what am i saying…

[Farsi lyrics for Hich-Kas]

Ba inke to televisiona hamash mishinan dorooq migan, dashtam akhbar mididam
Ke chetor ajora roo bache ha va ashkaye madara roo zamin mirizan
Bache ha shirinan
Neshoonash roo bache Ei ke tAze yad gerefte rah bere o dastesho migiran
Por kard… Ba’d, tiri zad
Chand vaght pish sahne haei shabihe ino too chand ghadamim mididam
Ah daram chi migam…

[Hook]:

Free my people, Long live Palestine
We will never let you go

Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine

[Verse 6: Reveal]

Israel is a terrorist state
The evidence is quite obvious
War criminals using lethal weapons like white phosphorus
Burns your flesh to the bone
And if you happen to live
You'll be left infected with cancer
You'll curse the fact that you did
Forgive me if I wish to say fate on those Israelis
Responsible for killing all those innocent little babies
I studied the Torah and learnt by their own admission
Israel's actions are not kosher in their own religion

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 7: Mahmoud Jreiri (DAM)]

I look around me, I find no life
They took my land from under my feet
And gave me only suffering
We used to carry "Torreyeh" (A planting tool)
And God gave us our livelihood
Now we carry a rifle
And on God we depend
Massacre, Slaughter
Everyone has seen it on the screens
Not today, not the West Bank, not Gaza
Look closely in the pages of history
Look at Christ
People are getting crucified in Palestine for over 60 years

[Verse 8: Hasan Salaam]

The Devils got an unholy plan for the Holy Land
So I hold my Quran and
Culture power in the other hand
Damn
No oasis just bloodstained sands
Settlements settin' up to eliminate child, woman and man..
There's no such thing as the Middle East
Brother they deceiving you
No matter where you stand there's always something to the east of you
So whether it's the Mossad or the FBI policing you
It's all one struggle till the final breath is leavin' you

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 9: Shadia Mansour]

(We should, Know, How, [?])
Arabic people, our unity is our skeleton
We should learn how to think
We should learn how to deliver a message without shutting doors in our faces
I wouldn't have known what is good for me
If I haven't seen what is good for others
Take my words as experience, not an insult

(We should decapitate the head of the monster)

So it loses its way, and its true nature revealed

[Hook]

Free my people, Long live Palestine
We will never let you go

Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine[Chorus: Hezekiah]
Fuck how you feel about me
Say what you will about me
But let’s see how you feel
When the walls come tumbling down
When the walls come tumbling down yeah
When the walls come tumbling down

[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
They're saying racism in Americas over
Well tell that to the pigs when they pulling me over
No eye contact just a gun out the holster
Plantation overseers, prisons, filling their quota
They call us niggers
They call us thugs
Say we all good for nothing and we all sell drugs
They call for blood
They call in the squadron
But I am Oscar Grant I am Trayvon Martin
Jelani Manigault and Phillip Pannell
Invisible man faces at the bottom of the well
We been through hell
Still see eternal life Henrietta Lacks cells
Uncle Tom's been corrupting the biz
And that's word to the wire under Al Sharpton’s wig
Pigs still shoot us in that back tho
Regardless of the nigga tweets by Gwyneth Paltrow
How low do we go to fit in
Killing ourselves even bleaching our skin
Racism been stayed right on track
And none of it changed just because the presidents black fuck that

[Chorus: Hezekiah]
Fuck how you feel about me
Say what you will about me
But let’s see how you feel
When the walls come tumbling down
When the walls come tumbling down yeah
When the walls come tumbling down

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]

They wanna condition your brain when they get in there
To make you believe that the walls always been there
Persevering the game without getting your flesh torn
Gotta get to a square that’s not on a chess board
Invisible walls classism and privilege
That are taller than apartheid walls you live with
Governments a business clouded in smoke
And when you’re broke only real choice Pepsi and Coke
Muthafuckaz will build a wall for every reason alive
But then change the reason when they get you inside
They build a wall to try and keep terrorists out
And it becomes symbolic of what terrorism’s about
Build a great wall for barbarian neighbors
And it’s trampled by tourists a thousand years later
Now they built a wall to keep immigrants out
But wanna pick and choose the immigrants they talking about

[Bridge: Immortal Technique]
Jericho's Walls came tumbling downward
The hand of God turns Rock and Metal to powder
Rebellious Minds, I need you to think louder
Before they police every thought they encounter
Jericho's walls came tumbling downward
When empires fall you see who laid the groundwork
You think the Spark of Revolution's an outburst
I guess before Jericho we come to your house first

[Chorus: Hezekiah]
Fuck how you feel about me
Say what you will about me
But let’s see how you feel
When the walls come tumbling down
When the walls come tumbling down yeah
When the walls come tumbling down[Hook: Immortal Technique]

We in the trenches, on the offensive
Runnin' through machine gun fire and barbed wire fences
Muthafuckas say that violence is senseless
But so is getting slaughtered when you caught up defenceless
We in the trenches, on the offensive
Runnin' through machine gun fire and barbed wire fences, (Rebel Armz!)
Like the Viet Cong back with a vengeance
Your life is worthless but war is expensive

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]

I'm like the spirit of the slave trade, follow the route
Why the fuck you think them hurricanes tear through the south?
And the Mid-Atlantic, starving the frantic
Stranded, abandoned, but I’m branded the hand of God
So I stand in command of the answer for radiation driven cancer
Tuskegee and the way that they murdered the Panthers
Back-up dancers for proposition 187
But my counter-proposition is a one eighty seven
I'll put a bounty on the head of a racist reverend
And drag his body through the streets on September 11th
My presence is like a Pentagon produced earthquake
Forced abortion to control the birth-rate
Planned incarceration with test scores from the 4th grade
New world order just completed the fourth stage
But before I ever surrender to the law
I'll turn this shit into Haiti, in 1794!

[Hook X2]

[Verse 2: J Arch ]

Now, respect I demand that, do your history
Give the Indians and Africans they land back
Bustin' my ass, while the man stand back, for minumun wage
Nah, I just don't understand that
My skill level way beyond collegiate
Capsize the boat and make the passengers sea sick
Smooth with that street shit, moons(?) who's I be with
Taking back what's ours like the people of Egypt
Rebel arms representer I pledge my allegiance
No matter how I do it I break through their defense
Fuck a false pretense or sensitive ass meanings
Germany getting nice on America's current events
North Korea nukes in the morning headlines for the evenings
We all cool as fuck, but they don't want to see us breathing
By the time she on the moon (?) check to see if they receive it
Madman militant it's strategic

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam ]

This isn't just drums and rhythm, this is guns and ammunition
When its sung, redrum for the system
Let the slugs rumpapum, get it buck when you listen
Anarchist cookbook, I got the heat in the kitchen
Act up and wind up using a tube for the pot that you piss in
Sundiata spittin, yeah I rock for tradition
I'm a man on a mission like Clarence 13
Or the great Saladin leading the Mujahideen
Make moves like Kasparov, with a sawed-off and Molotov
Flows synonymous with the kickback of a Kalashnikov
Mossberg Upanishads, punishing your promenade
Like Arch Duke Ferdinand BONG in front your entourage
Rebel Armz firing squad, lugers to bazookas
Minds balanced with the talents of Larry Davis & Lumumba
Laying grounds for the future, Cairo on the 25th
All power to the people when that 5th Column spits[Chorus]
Life is a wheel and in this circle

[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
When I was young with a pad and a pencil
I grew and drew you as the example of the evil that men do
Said to your only sun he wouldn’t be shit
And I’ve spent most of my life really believing that shit
Now I wonder how I could’ve been deceived that quick
Cause up until that point you ain't teach me shit
I guess you ain't consider raising up a half a nigger
Unable to relate to the world at odds with yah
Had to rip your face out a couple of family pictures
Moms doing alright you know she ain't bitter
She even told me to take the time to sit and build with yah
But it’s been a minute pops the fuck been up with yah?

[Chorus]
Life is a wheel and in this circle

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]
Like father like sun same temper and all
Similar downfalls drowned out in alcohol
Round the time I got involved with the yes yes y'all
I caught a vision and listened to the Adhans call
Of course I wanted to know what you thought of it all
But instead of healing wounds you chose to throw me salt
Which brought our interactions to immediate halt
I remember hitting heavy bags waiting to square off
Wondering the thought that brought y’all to pair off
Were you truly loves deepest believer
Or were you just passed down the lust of the master and overseer
That left you struck with a severe case of jungle fever
See the illest thing that these eyes done seen
Was the klan raping a sister in your porn magazine
That’s some impossible shit to wipe clean
Like I was just the mistake of your wildest wet dream
Seemed at some points you wasn’t willing to deal
Treated like the black sheep of your family for real
Like race wasn’t an issue until truth was revealed
And I was accused of taking shit I wouldn’t have to steal
That’s some ill shit to have on your mind at 9
Kind of hard to be color blind when I’m hated for mine
But all of that never seemed to tarnish my shine
Till shorty said she was pregnant and swore it was mine
But that marriage ended in miscarriage
More weight for the scales that tipped me to savage
Me and Moms started going at it over everything
Disrespecting her home
Me thinking I’m grown
Like why bother I could father myself on my own
It’s against the laws of nature but through time it’s shown
No matter how wise or concrete my mother was planned
No woman by herself should have to raise no man
Especially 1 driven with a heart full of hate
All the fighting used to make her say she saw you in my face
So I’m guessing its fate that brought me here to take care of yah
Life in Black & White gotta be some grey area
Your sickness impairing yah
Barely able to walk on your own and just think I used to be scared of yah
But that’s what makes all of this that much harder
Cause Allah always said honor thy Mother and Father

[Chorus]
Life is a wheel and in this circleSmoke too many Newports
Plus attend too many court dates to cool off
Been with too many women in sin
Committing too much adultery
Not to have a Queen and seed to hold close to me
Been a while since I listened to the Lord when he spoke to me, I seem to just live for today
Was born to decay and don't do my best to pray five times a day
Gotta get saved, but who knows if Allah will forgive my ways
Played too many $2 bottles of E&J and Cognac, blunt wraps, rolled with haze
Made more mistakes than most
And at this point it seems like a waste to try and shake my ghost
Most of my life never loved myself
And that lead me to scaring and drugging myself
Lately I been wondering about my brother's health
Cuz we too stubborn to ask one another for help
So we just wait for the outcome and act on stealth
I laugh to keep from crying
Insomniac don't sleep like it'll actually aide in the fight to keep me from dying
Fear of failure never kept me from trying
High school drop out, Mom's house kicked out
My slick mouth had a knack for startin' beef just to bring them fists out
Took that slick route on a quest for papers and wound up in places
Where angels sold their wings for the worst disgraces
I'm not your basic
So I really don't give a fuck if I don't happen to make your radio playlist
Tryin' to find a way to rhyme all my problems gone and extend my arms
To cradle the soul of my children that never made this world born
Tryna brush the dust off my holy Qur'an
These ain't just songs, these are prayers from a sinner
Who might see paradise in a dream but probably never get to enter
See I wrestle with the devil to control my temper
That tempest is buried inside every one of us
And that temptress is looking to screw the strength out of every last one of us
It's too easy for this world to get the best of us
I got a knack for fucking up, never felt that I was owed
Any results from the blessings bestowed
Grown from a boy to a man, so I'm ready if tomorrow is finally the end of my road
Let truth be told
Y'all don't hear me, you feel me
A glimpse of hope in the eye of the tired and weary
The will to survive make me see things clearly
First was the word and if life is a test
Hope we graded on a curve 'cuz we weak in the flesh
Most seek treasure's of fools gold and will never understand the meaning of X
I speak from the chest, all I want is to be free and the relief from the stress
So if that means death, I'mma be my own Savior
Just had to speak my peace before I meet my maker...
I just had to speak my peace before I meet my maker....[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

This a renaissance for the art of making love
Jet Setting round the globe with the Mile High Club
Come fly with us friendly skies above
The ultimate high and baby your my drug
So let me explain that making love in the rain will make your whole life change
Said you like it ruff so every spot gets touched
Foreplay to role-play, ropes and handcuffs
So blow a kiss my way turn up the Sade
Lost in the moment been in it since Friday
Ménage à trois c'est la vi
On you, on her and you're both on me… See

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Treat Her like a Queen
Fuck Her like a Porn Star x4

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

I’m a gentleman- open doors and pull out chairs
Behind closed doors- smack ass and pull back hair
Soon as you said King put that right there
Had you up against the wall legs up in the air
So darling move your hips like a lunar eclipse
Honey dipped skin tone been calling for bliss
Could tell how you want it from the way that you kiss
So I keep a wet smile on all four of your lips


[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Treat Her like a Queen
Fuck Her like a Porn Star x4


[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]

Girl you just like me always stay in the mood
Rest of the world disappear when we get up in our groove
Cocoa butter smooth
Dance step know all the moves
And your legs look amazing is some high heel shoes
Couldn’t choose a favorite body part
It’s all a work of art
You got the Mona Lisa on smash
Said your clothes look good on yah but they look better off yah
So let’s make sure the good shit last
Take um off for me


[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Treat Her like a Queen
Fuck Her like a Porn Star x4

[Outro: Hasan Salaam]
I’m baptized in your thighs when your body explodes x3[Refrain x2]
It goes 1 for the trouble 2 for the time/
3 for the hustle and 4 for the grind/
You know the struggle I go-go for mine/
I’m oh so inclined the G-O-Divine

[Verse 1]
I Rock & Roll for the Soul of my Ancestors
And built my dynasty without the Masonic hand gestures
Yeah, this is church right here
Young Black don’t give a fuck Amerikkka’s nightmare
Next level I’m a rebel with a cause
And you can say two words without no homo or a pause
Heard your bars and I’m somewhat appalled
So clapping at you got something to do with no applause
Memorize this slogan:
Whores, jaws and laws was made to be broken
Honestly what the fuck are y'all smoking?
Hip-Hop must be dead with the shit that y'all promoting
V-Nasty saying nigger ain’t the first for a rapper
But it’s ill how ignorance make her think that she Blacker
Coming out like race don’t matter
But it's White Girl Mob like the Ku Klux chapter
Bitch, I ain’t drinking the Kool Aid
Whoever cosign her’s just a new age slave
Looking in the mirror like look what the coon made
Give a fuck about you or your YouTube plays
I’m a lover not a fighter, but if you want me to kill ya
Shit, I could fulfill your
Wish than dance on your grave like Thriller
So pick one finger the middle or the trigger

[Hook]
I’m much more than married to the weapon I carry
Born to be like soul mates
Brought together by fortune or fate
And ain't no way that you could make us separate
It goes praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Praise the Lord, praise The Lord

[Verse 2]
My albums are more Autobiography of Malcolm
AK by the window sill
Rock for the memory of young Emmett Till
Riding shotgun with a shotty like the name Bobby Seale
Fuck a record deal or how executives feel
This last supper getcha meal, Revelation 7th seal
Put work in the field like David Walker's Appeal
So the track hit you like Brandy was whipping wheels of steel
That’s a cheap shot, I guess
But the game's gone soft, I am the least not impressed
Leeches in the game trying to feast on the flesh
Tough talk, but you run to police under stress
Ain’t no swine for mine, ya dig
My style Halal, never fuck with the pigs
It is what it is, get in the way of my plans
We toss em off stage like one of Akon's fans
Damn[Verse 1]
I'm trying to shake of the blues
So I keep rolling them dice like c'mon yo I need new shoes
No handouts im out here paying my dues
You know the rules show n prove or you fixing to lose
Don't get it confused
Cause im out here grinding round the time you hitting your alarm on snooze
The proofs in the pudding and with all the work I put in
I'll be damned if I let somebody tell me I couldn't
But now everybody want something like I'm in a place
To put you on cause you added me as friends on myspace
I'm a keep it real sun I don't got a deal
Fuck you want me to do help you be unsigned to
Nah dude I gotta 1st take care a me and mines
Realize it goes much deeper than just beats and rhymes
Each lines designed as a stop look and listen sign
Free the mind and at the same time keep the music live…

[Hook]
The worlds just a stage everybody is on
You can only get played by the game so long
Its 15 minutes
Give yah 15 minutes
After 15 minutes you're gone…

[Verse 2]
Nowadays everybody wanna debate who's the greatest
Biasedly basing they statements on the rich and the famous
Dick riders name drop the same people and places
Claiming a 1st name basis with Diddy and Clive Davis
Labels want a Elvis situation reinstated
So they can re-write our history and tell us they made it
Them Hip-Hop police and federal agents
Keep staking out the shows and making bullshit cases
The DJ's don't really give a fuck what you saying
Long as the payola paying then somebody'll play it
Same 3 songs rotating on rap radio stations
Like fuck if its creative as long as the beat is banging
Kids no longer separate life from entertainment
And with all the gangsta shit no one explains an affidavit
Your ghostwriters ain't coming out to your arraignment
Emulating your favorite rappers a painstaking engagement
Backstabbers backstage with smiling faces
Put on Oscar worthy attempts full of obvious hatred
The games gone global and the stakes are elevated
But this started in the park making hits in the basement
Don't forget it…

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I stepped up in this game ditty bopping
Who rock and get it popping like grand wizard needle dropping
Not into share cropping for some cracker picking cotton
I just keep it Hip to the Hid Op and don't stop it
But now everybody telling me 30's the new 20
And eventually im a blow up like it was meant to be
Shit I don't got no time to wait on fate
My old Earth been sick and the bills are late
So when that mystical, magical, majestical day happen
I'll be dragging them haters from the back of the bandwagon
Half of um won't understand the jewels that I gave um
Other half still pronouncing my name Haysen Salem
So lets get better acquainted as I deliver the proof
Raw emotion every time that I steps in a booth
So just I case I wasn't properly introduced
Mom dukes call me Sanni you could call me the truth……[Refrain x2]
It goes 1 for the trouble 2 for the time/
3 for the hustle and 4 for the grind/
You know the struggle I go-go for mine/
I’m oh so inclined the G-O-Divine

This is beginning and end, the answer and the reason
This the life and the death, the changin of the seasons
It's the joy and the pain, the angels and the demons
It's a wonderous thing, the changin of the seasons
This is beginning and end, the answer and the reason
This the life and the death, the changin of the seasons
It's the joy and the pain, the angels and the demons
It's a wonderous thing

[Hasan Salaam]
In the winter of his discontent
He was birthed like a verse from the gospel
Pops was ghost, moms played host to the Johns in the brothel
Never heard any words to encourage out his mom's mouth
How to cook up all the hook-ups, was learned from the men
That she let in the house, turned out by the business
Missed a lot more than Christmas, giftless, childhood was a juvenile hell
Knew his number better than himself as he peered down his cell

[Akir]
Out of the darkness, in a cold labyrinth
That haunts us, his man parks up
Pullin heat out compartments like, spring into action
Cash is satisfaction, I'm sunk askin him livin life hype
He observes but back to the curb to sound the white birds
And NexTel chirps, he can tell he's accustomed by his 2-way alert
New opportunties blossomed, from niggas he met locked in
And old niggas that he knew that acted like they just forgot him (uhh)

[Hook]

[Hasan Salaam]
Life seemed like mid summer night's dream
Got a crib and a queen - first seed on the way
Due November 17th, shorty settin the scene
Beggin him to get his act clean to the right side of the law
But his audience was the money machine's constant applause
Never concerned with the effects, just out for the cause
To get back what he lost, he hustled at all cost
Started to floss foolish, pigs watchin the movements
Every crew got his Judas

[Akir]
Uhh, he holds onto the wall
Hopin that he won't fall, feelin his life slip away
Watchin the leaves float away, in the yard
The closest that he gets to guard the only bars he thought he'd be in
Would be filled with pretty women and TV's playin ESPN
And now he can't control his peein
The family that he never had but used to seein
In his daydreamin turn they back and started leavin
Come to demons and that instant turns to a infant, the change of seasons

[Hook]

[Outro]
This is beginning and end, the answer and the reason
This the life and the death, the changin of the seasons
It's the joy and the pain, the angels and the demons

No woman by herself should have to raise no man
Especially 1 driven with a heart full of hate
All the fighting used to make her say she saw you in my face
So I’m guessing its fate that brought me here to take care of yah
Life in Black & White gotta be some grey area
Your sickness impairing yah
Barely able to walk on your own and just think I used to be scared of yah
But that’s what makes all of this that much harder
Cause Allah always said honor thy Mother and Father

[Chorus]
Life is a wheel and in this circle[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
-My humble slice of Americana
Been cut and stepped on with sex, liquor and marijuana
Father chose bottle over the fam
Mama held it down with more jobs than you can count on your hand
Grandma would have me in church all day
But saw god for the 1st time with pops in AA
Playing games with his 1 day sober key chains
B4 he back at the bar hitting snow hard as a ski range
Finding me sane in them damn ink blotches
Got a longer wait than fans for Dre's detox is
When black lords was videoed ko's
I was naughty by nature getting O.P.P. like hey ho
1 track mind couldn't tell me nothing either
After that spike lee joint was called a product of the fever
Jungle boy always up in some trouble boy
Thieving, mischeiving and always tryna see double boy $$$

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]
It goes Hip-Hop don't stop the body rock
Dropped school and kicked out my Mama spot
Got bills streets was hot up in the melting pot
So my sex pistol pop popped the money shot
Ain't Never been a follower
(I'm a) Philanthropist, philosopher
Poet and pornographer
Feds wanna bust me
Pigs wanna cuff me
Mullahs wanna shush me like Salman Rushdie
Snakes gone discuss me
Their ways disgust me
But truth is none of them could fuck with me trust me
I made it this far despite all of the odds
If you can’t believe in yourself how you believe in a god
I'm a man on a mission
All fact no fiction
True to myself and all of my contradictions
Read the encryption where the moral to the story is
Life’s only black and white when developing the negatives...[Hook: Immortal Technique]

We in the trenches, on the offensive
Runnin' through machine gun fire and barbed wire fences
Muthafuckas say that violence is senseless
But so is getting slaughtered when you caught up defenceless
We in the trenches, on the offensive
Runnin' through machine gun fire and barbed wire fences, (Rebel Armz!)
Like the Viet Cong back with a vengeance
Your life is worthless but war is expensive

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]

I'm like the spirit of the slave trade, follow the route
Why the fuck you think them hurricanes tear through the south?
And the Mid-Atlantic, starving the frantic
Stranded, abandoned, but I’m branded the hand of God
So I stand in command of the answer for radiation driven cancer
Tuskegee and the way that they murdered the Panthers
Back-up dancers for proposition 187
But my counter-proposition is a one eighty seven
I'll put a bounty on the head of a racist reverend
And drag his body through the streets on September 11th
My presence is like a Pentagon produced earthquake
Forced abortion to control the birth-rate
Planned incarceration with test scores from the 4th grade
New world order just completed the fourth stage
But before I ever surrender to the law
I'll turn this shit into Haiti, in 1794!

[Hook X2]

[Verse 2: J Arch ]

Now, respect I demand that, do your history
Give the Indians and Africans they land back
Bustin' my ass, while the man stand back, for minumun wage
Nah, I just don't understand that
My skill level way beyond collegiate
Capsize the boat and make the passengers sea sick
Smooth with that street shit, moons(?) who's I be with
Taking back what's ours like the people of Egypt
Rebel arms representer I pledge my allegiance
No matter how I do it I break through their defense
Fuck a false pretense or sensitive ass meanings
Germany getting nice on America's current events
North Korea nukes in the morning headlines for the evenings
We all cool as fuck, but they don't want to see us breathing
By the time she on the moon (?) check to see if they receive it
Madman militant it's strategic

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam ]

This isn't just drums and rhythm, this is guns and ammunition
When its sung, redrum for the system
Let the slugs rumpapum, get it buck when you listen
Anarchist cookbook, I got the heat in the kitchen
Act up and wind up using a tube for the pot that you piss in
Sundiata spittin, yeah I rock for tradition
I'm a man on a mission like Clarence 13
Or the great Saladin leading the Mujahideen
Make moves like Kasparov, with a sawed-off and Molotov
Flows synonymous with the kickback of a Kalashnikov
Mossberg Upanishads, punishing your promenade
Like Arch Duke Ferdinand BONG in front your entourage
Rebel Armz firing squad, lugers to bazookas
Minds balanced with the talents of Larry Davis & Lumumba
Laying grounds for the future, Cairo on the 25th
All power to the people when that 5th Column spits[Chorus: Hezekiah]
Fuck how you feel about me
Say what you will about me
But let’s see how you feel
When the walls come tumbling down
When the walls come tumbling down yeah
When the walls come tumbling down

[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
They're saying racism in Americas over
Well tell that to the pigs when they pulling me over
No eye contact just a gun out the holster
Plantation overseers, prisons, filling their quota
They call us niggers
They call us thugs
Say we all good for nothing and we all sell drugs
They call for blood
They call in the squadron
But I am Oscar Grant I am Trayvon Martin
Jelani Manigault and Phillip Pannell
Invisible man faces at the bottom of the well
We been through hell
Still see eternal life Henrietta Lacks cells
Uncle Tom's been corrupting the biz
And that's word to the wire under Al Sharpton’s wig
Pigs still shoot us in that back tho
Regardless of the nigga tweets by Gwyneth Paltrow
How low do we go to fit in
Killing ourselves even bleaching our skin
Racism been stayed right on track
And none of it changed just because the presidents black fuck that

[Chorus: Hezekiah]
Fuck how you feel about me
Say what you will about me
But let’s see how you feel
When the walls come tumbling down
When the walls come tumbling down yeah
When the walls come tumbling down

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]

They wanna condition your brain when they get in there
To make you believe that the walls always been there
Persevering the game without getting your flesh torn
Gotta get to a square that’s not on a chess board
Invisible walls classism and privilege
That are taller than apartheid walls you live with
Governments a business clouded in smoke
And when you’re broke only real choice Pepsi and Coke
Muthafuckaz will build a wall for every reason alive
But then change the reason when they get you inside
They build a wall to try and keep terrorists out
And it becomes symbolic of what terrorism’s about
Build a great wall for barbarian neighbors
And it’s trampled by tourists a thousand years later
Now they built a wall to keep immigrants out
But wanna pick and choose the immigrants they talking about

[Bridge: Immortal Technique]
Jericho's Walls came tumbling downward
The hand of God turns Rock and Metal to powder
Rebellious Minds, I need you to think louder
Before they police every thought they encounter
Jericho's walls came tumbling downward
When empires fall you see who laid the groundwork
You think the Spark of Revolution's an outburst
I guess before Jericho we come to your house first

[Chorus: Hezekiah]
Fuck how you feel about me
Say what you will about me
But let’s see how you feel
When the walls come tumbling down
When the walls come tumbling down yeah
When the walls come tumbling downThe kingdom of heaven is here
We just gotta reach it
The garden stay in fruition with waters flowing beneath it
As the false idols of Babel are broken to pieces
Living prophecy take shape and a ciphers completed
The word of god was made flesh for the righteous to speak it
Not enough just to believe it
Gotta live it and teach it
Worst sin you can commit is keeping knowledge a secret
Truth is right in front our eyes most ain't looking to see it
The devil keep us deaf, dumb, and blind
Addicted to crime
Feeding us venomous swine
To poison our minds
Plague and pestilence redefine the signs of the times
For the 7th is a testament to all mankind
Both sides been aligned for the will to decide
We're on a very thin line between jinn and divine
You could feel the world spin
Here at the center of sin
Just look no further than yourself and find a heaven within...Amen

Chorus(4x)
La ilaha ilallah, ilallah
I bear witness there is none but Allah

Verse two
See there truly must be something that these atheists miss
With every breath every step the almighty exists
People bled a common thread and them wounds ain't stitched
Keep the Sabbath and a ratchet never cease and desist
Been through hell death ships brought us up the river Styx
Yet we still lift our voices to a heavenly pitch
From the pain that came down like acid rain through the mix
Fact remains that the sun of man cannot be eclipsed
10% would have you think this living god is a myth
In order to benefit from having all of us tricked
As the comatose drift through the darkest abyss
Shaytan is playing host to their ignorant bliss
Life ain't about what you got on your wrist
Your house or your whip salvation can't be bought by the rich
Every waking moment given is benevolent gift
So spend it wisely and not wasteful
The graceful are the faithful
The ungracious are the hateful
Life has proved fatal since the dawn of earth's cradle
Only you can save you
So stay true to them words you are bound
Its all ups and downs either you swim or you drown
Heavens no higher than your crown
And hell is no lower then the ground
Take a look around the hereafter is now
For fate is all based on god blessing the child
So when them lights dim in death you're born again
Allah's One and that has no beginning or end
Some could feel the world spin
Here at the center of sin
Just look no further than yourself and find a heaven within...Amen...[Intro]:
Not every Zionist is Jewish
And not every Jew is a Zionist

This is for Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
It's about time we globalized the intifada
Listen close I've got six words for Obama
Long live Palestine
Long live Gaza
Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
It's about time we globalized the intifada
Listen close I've got six words for Obama
Long live Palestine, Long live Gaza

[Verse 1: Lowkey]

The government supports the people of the UK didn't
Zionism is not compatible with Judaism - the hijacked faith
The state is misrepresenting
Israel equals misplacement and ethnic cleansing
I know I'm on a list, for being more verbal, curse every Zionist since Theodor Herzl
Balfour was not a wise man
Shame on Rothschild
Between them the monster they created has gone wild

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 2:Tamer Naffar (DAM)]

We are people who were sieged by the enemy
Betrayed by our brothers
You won't feel heroic [?]
Withdrawal from Iraq, like a locust invasion
Left only destruction
No punishment
How many mouths were silenced?
How many mothers left devastated?
My freedom begins when the one who took it pays the price
Mr. Judge, open your eyes, open your ears
How many evidences scream against him...
Give me my freedom, and tie up his hands

[Verse 3: The Narcicyst]

Tears to laughter
Our children don't fear disaster
Living near the master
Clear the facts
Hear the casket
We rap and we die from bombastic times
Loons have to hide
Summer days in the thunder blaze
They merk their dreams like Theodor Herzl screams
And the UN and 48 Third Intifada
From mothers, daughters
Sons martyred and empty fathers

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 4: Eslam Jawwad]

The right of returned
A whole people got imprisoned
Bullets are falling like rain
Rain is falling hard
Breaths are cut
[?]
Take the bird out of its cage
Go fly away
Go show my blood to the world
This is my sin
I'm waiting for my Savior, for Isa
The only hope I have left is my God

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 5: Hich-Kas]

Although they always lie in the tv, i was watching the news
It showed how bricks fell on kids and mother’s tears fell on the ground
The kids are sweet
His aim was on a child who just leant how to walk, and they held his hand
He loaded, and shoot
A while ago i was seeing scenes like this in front of me
Ah, what am i saying…

[Farsi lyrics for Hich-Kas]

Ba inke to televisiona hamash mishinan dorooq migan, dashtam akhbar mididam
Ke chetor ajora roo bache ha va ashkaye madara roo zamin mirizan
Bache ha shirinan
Neshoonash roo bache Ei ke tAze yad gerefte rah bere o dastesho migiran
Por kard… Ba’d, tiri zad
Chand vaght pish sahne haei shabihe ino too chand ghadamim mididam
Ah daram chi migam…

[Hook]:

Free my people, Long live Palestine
We will never let you go

Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine

[Verse 6: Reveal]

Israel is a terrorist state
The evidence is quite obvious
War criminals using lethal weapons like white phosphorus
Burns your flesh to the bone
And if you happen to live
You'll be left infected with cancer
You'll curse the fact that you did
Forgive me if I wish to say fate on those Israelis
Responsible for killing all those innocent little babies
I studied the Torah and learnt by their own admission
Israel's actions are not kosher in their own religion

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 7: Mahmoud Jreiri (DAM)]

I look around me, I find no life
They took my land from under my feet
And gave me only suffering
We used to carry "Torreyeh" (A planting tool)
And God gave us our livelihood
Now we carry a rifle
And on God we depend
Massacre, Slaughter
Everyone has seen it on the screens
Not today, not the West Bank, not Gaza
Look closely in the pages of history
Look at Christ
People are getting crucified in Palestine for over 60 years

[Verse 8: Hasan Salaam]

The Devils got an unholy plan for the Holy Land
So I hold my Quran and
Culture power in the other hand
Damn
No oasis just bloodstained sands
Settlements settin' up to eliminate child, woman and man..
There's no such thing as the Middle East
Brother they deceiving you
No matter where you stand there's always something to the east of you
So whether it's the Mossad or the FBI policing you
It's all one struggle till the final breath is leavin' you

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 9: Shadia Mansour]

(We should, Know, How, [?])
Arabic people, our unity is our skeleton
We should learn how to think
We should learn how to deliver a message without shutting doors in our faces
I wouldn't have known what is good for me
If I haven't seen what is good for others
Take my words as experience, not an insult

(We should decapitate the head of the monster)

So it loses its way, and its true nature revealed

[Hook]

Free my people, Long live Palestine
We will never let you go

Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

It goes:
Unmanned drones
Attack of the clones
Bulldozing homes word to Ariel Sharon
Beyond the Green Zone… Shhhhhh it’s a secret
Only government officials and dead men keep it
Peep it
Chosen few
Army of one
Take him out of high school hand him a gun
Just do what you’re told
Salute the patrol
And exude the control
To gain an advantage
Play the game underhanded
Dead civilians we can manage
That’s collateral damage

[Chorus: Crowd]

We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
We Killing em (What) (What) We Killing em

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

Only us-- fuck the rest of y'all
No HMO’s or PPO’s
No hospital beds for y’all
We keep it natural
GMO’s for y’all
High fructose
Glucose
High cholesterol
Food desserts    McDonalds is compost
Single cycle crops from the bowels of Monsanto’s
Chemical clouds …………..
Breathe it in
Pledge allegiance no matter what GOD you’re believing in

[Chorus: Crowd]

We killing em huh huh we killing em

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]

Foreign policy
Enforce it violently
Make them vote at gunpoint
Fuckah THIS democracy
Hypocrisy posing for the camera
Briefcase full of foreign currency for the ambassador
See the dollar signs in genocidal ma$$acre
As long as the wars in the wars in the Middle East or Africa
Nightly news readily report our views
Skip the golden rules for the profits made from fossil fuels
Capitalize on both sides of the current
Call them all insurgents
Mass graves beneath the surface
Modern warfare
Got em all scarred
Nuclear holocaust got em in the cross-hairs cause…


[Chorus: Crowd]

We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
We Killing em (What) (What) We Killing em

We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
The melodies and harmonies stick to your ribs
Like hominy grits in the winter you dig
As a kid I was raised on the sounds of Motown
From Planet Rock where galactic B-boys throw down
Breath of fresh air in the depths of despair
No matter how bad it get, the music gets there
Park jams remind us of Congo Square
And that feeling gets your ass up like musical chairs
Sang spirituals on the plantation for salvation
From blues shaman to DJs and beat breaking
It's so sacred, just know the ledge
Said if it wasn't for the music I'd be better off dead

[Hook: Baron]
It lifts me up
And calms me down
When I am lost
It's through the sound
I find my inner light through music
Music is my life

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]
The vibe that I'm giving you
Been the same since I was rocking James Brown tunes in Mama's Living room
No silver spoon, hairbrush, microphone and a boom box
Lip-syncing to M.J, moon-walking across the spot in some tube socks
From the bricks to the boondocks
Hip hop got the bass bumping up higher than blue tops
Ghetto griots still spitting they oo-ops
Like Pops on the block harmonizing his Doo-Wops
Air guitars turn us all to rock superstars
Hear your song, sing along, no matter who you are!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]
This is for the Godfather of Soul and Charles Parker
Bird lives in the flatted fifths we play sharper
Bob Marley them no capture fire starter
Big and Pac, still rockin' to the Music of Martyrs
John Lennon, Marvin Gaye, relevant to this day
No bullet could take music away!
Burning Hollywood with P.E leading the way
Yelling fuck the police with N.W.A
Ray Charles sang with 20/20 vision
And Fela's freedom got found in the rhythm
Listened to the pain of Kurt Cobain
And saw God in the notes of Saint John Coltrane
Aaliyah singing proof that angels existed
Jimi Hendrix "Purple Haze" made sure we was lifted
Voice for the voiceless, just gotta say Ashe
Let's keep celebrating Billie Holiday!

[Hook]Smoke too many Newports
Plus attend too many court dates to cool off
Been with too many women in sin
Committing too much adultery
Not to have a Queen and seed to hold close to me
Been a while since I listened to the Lord when he spoke to me, I seem to just live for today
Was born to decay and don't do my best to pray five times a day
Gotta get saved, but who knows if Allah will forgive my ways
Played too many $2 bottles of E&J and Cognac, blunt wraps, rolled with haze
Made more mistakes than most
And at this point it seems like a waste to try and shake my ghost
Most of my life never loved myself
And that lead me to scaring and drugging myself
Lately I been wondering about my brother's health
Cuz we too stubborn to ask one another for help
So we just wait for the outcome and act on stealth
I laugh to keep from crying
Insomniac don't sleep like it'll actually aide in the fight to keep me from dying
Fear of failure never kept me from trying
High school drop out, Mom's house kicked out
My slick mouth had a knack for startin' beef just to bring them fists out
Took that slick route on a quest for papers and wound up in places
Where angels sold their wings for the worst disgraces
I'm not your basic
So I really don't give a fuck if I don't happen to make your radio playlist
Tryin' to find a way to rhyme all my problems gone and extend my arms
To cradle the soul of my children that never made this world born
Tryna brush the dust off my holy Qur'an
These ain't just songs, these are prayers from a sinner
Who might see paradise in a dream but probably never get to enter
See I wrestle with the devil to control my temper
That tempest is buried inside every one of us
And that temptress is looking to screw the strength out of every last one of us
It's too easy for this world to get the best of us
I got a knack for fucking up, never felt that I was owed
Any results from the blessings bestowed
Grown from a boy to a man, so I'm ready if tomorrow is finally the end of my road
Let truth be told
Y'all don't hear me, you feel me
A glimpse of hope in the eye of the tired and weary
The will to survive make me see things clearly
First was the word and if life is a test
Hope we graded on a curve 'cuz we weak in the flesh
Most seek treasure's of fools gold and will never understand the meaning of X
I speak from the chest, all I want is to be free and the relief from the stress
So if that means death, I'mma be my own Savior
Just had to speak my peace before I meet my maker...
I just had to speak my peace before I meet my maker....[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
I light sticks and stones
Put grow lights in a nigga home
Dreadlock Prometheus, I bring you that fire
Wayward preacher, streets is my choir
And every night, Sunday morning, niggas stored like a pew
Saints are few but prophets are a dime a dozen
Slice 'em into eighths like pizza hot out the oven
Snuck the witch out her coven
Black magic, she forgot about her husband
No limit poker, hit the slots with a deck full of jokers
King of all blacks took the plastic off your granny's sofa
Got your niece financial aid backed and your brother's bond posted

[Verse 2: Privilege]
He did it all for the lust and leisure
The pursuit of passion that was plainly passive
And clearly cautious when he walks in the dark stuck in mortal madness
(All aboard the savage train!)
Leaving in a little kid the letter better not be late
It contains your fate
And seals the incredulous circumstances under which you came to cake and get cash like a ninja in a penny arcade
Nowadays its – glitz and glamour, chicks and clamor, clips and hammers
Words on tips of tongues that never get said for the sake of manners
For the fakest fifteen minute slot penciled in leather bound day planners
Hounds in the hen house, round midnight kind of blue, the
Whole train jumped the track and flew
It's the Cold Vein that I tap into
The oldest pain used to sooth these moody blues
Fell to melancholy malaise, niggas marmalade the folly of ways these days
Twisted off lemon haze, outstanding spore a moonchild when I touch the floor
Round midnight kind of blue

[Verse 3: Hi-Coup]
I'm like wow, I just stepped in and niggas is looking at me foul
Chicks thats hard of hearing be listening to me now
The black faced injun who live in the red clouds
Breathe the peace pipe then tommyhawk your body down
When I chill: hold heat, smoke weed, but the police always got a couple more rounds
For a nigga when he wanna climb two feet leave 'em be few feet deep in the ground
Better head this way, man we got better weed. better peeps, better flow, better slang
Better hoes, better brains, better blow, better pain
Fuck around and you might be a victim of hit 'em split 'em get down
Don't try to run don't cry don't scream don't make a single peep nigga not a sound
Come from the land where hands cut off hands, to hold the crown
The few, the brave, the proud, nigga what?

[Verse 4: Hasan Salam]
Scratch my name in the groove thru veins and loops
Put blues to the record that pain produced
Im raw as the H that Bird would shoot
Moose the Mooche with the verbs and the verses duke
Been smooth as vermouth with the basic boost
Going back to the days of my wayward youth
Acting uncouth off the Absolute
Seduced by the loot and ways of making it duce
Resurrected by the truth to escape the troops
Of the pigs profiling for David Duke
Same go for anyone with the Haley roots
You know they want our necks fitted for the hangman noose
Don't get soopped you a lame excuse
The games been reduced to you chains and coupes
Better watch your back when the apes are loose
For they find you in a trunk like Ray Carruth
Experiment like Iran with my hand on the nukes
Rain, hail, snow and earthquakes to the booth
Actual facts and the track are proof
Of the 99 + 1 attributes…
Let me say it 1 more time if you couldn't compute
Actual facts and the track are proof of the 99 + 1 attributes Lord…[Verse1: Hasan Salaam]
Its like coming home and finding out the locks been changed
Mailbox got new names the whole blocks rearranged
Mom and Pop spots replaced by old navy and starbucks
Fact still remains they wanna get rid of all us
From Jerz to Oaktown and back down to New Orleans
We don't own the hood we call home they strangling all us
That constitution shit it ain't never been for us
So behind closed doors you could guess what they call us
Ambitions getting clouded by the bleakest surroundings
Urban renewal only means unaffordable housing
Tenements becoming condo's worth hundreds of thousands
So single Moms with 3 mouths to feed get forced up out em
Its overcrowded at the bottom swept under the rug
Gentrification claiming more turf then Crips and the Bloods
After the flood we still waiting on something from H.U.D
But the French Quarter got Mardi Gras they partying up
What the fuck

Chorus
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some Peace of mind (mine)
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some P.E.A.C.E. of mind

[Verse2: Hasan Salaam]
My Uncle loves the devil cause he gives him nothing
He put the fear in his heart and took his knowledge from him
We keep our trigger fingers on the panic button
Self hatred got us rushing on a road straight to self-destruction
We becoming just a clone of our oppressor
Assimilate to their ways and still settle for lesser
Everyday we subject to torture beyond measure
If the tables got turned bet they'd fold under the pressure
Poverty's persistent
The ghettos afflicted
Politicians only visit for photo ops in this district
Life could end any instant
You blink and you missed it
Shit we tag our name on walls so someone knows we existed
We want some freedom but the system won't let it be
Even without a felony they push the death penalty
Genocide got us riding on the side of our enemy
There's gotta be an escape in this world of white supremacy

Chorus
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some Peace of mind (mine)
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some P.E.A.C.E. of mind

[Verse3: Hasan Salaam]
I'm trying not to let my mind erupt
Before my short time is up
I dream of heaven but I know where I'll be winding up
Recruiters in the schools quick to sign me up for lining up
On front lines of wars that ain't mine
So I can die for what?
Spill my blood over some rich mans oil
As they sit back comfortably collecting the spoils
See we're expendable as young black males
3 choices a life of servitude or you dead or in jail
We searching 4 the holy-grail as the dro is exhaled
Air is stale on the block where fresh flesh is for sale
I'll save the details for a day when justice prevails
And all the fake judges and snakes are getting stripped of their scales
Behind the veil that gets worn by this so-called democracy
Lies a country who's policy is racial inequality
So while you busy protesting occupations abroad
Might wanna fix your mess and clean your own backyard
Lord…

Chorus
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some Peace of mind (mine)
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some P.E.A.C.E. of mind[Chorus]

Whitewashed in the dead sea scrolls

Genocide provides currency for the Vatican's gold
Popes bless slave ships and deny the holocaust
Kill a Palestinian Rabbi Toast it: Mazel Tov
Imams got suicide bombers popping off
Klan burning crosses Hail Mary tossing Molotovs
Preacher pushing lac yet the church roof ain't fixed
And there's air-conditioned tents in Mecca for the rich
Guess arms only pay-day through Sunday
Cause they easily back on they bullshit by Monday

Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but...

[Verse 2]

They say what a Madonna and then what a whore
Try to act like they mother never been fucked before
The right to choose gets debated as law
Killing in the name of God in the unholiest wars
Damn the man who shot little Malala
Turned around and tried to justify it Allah
Women make 9% less on every dollar
And you complain that she spent with all that bullshit to swallow
Those who follow blind won't heed this verse
But it needs to be said because they deeds is cursed
Misleading the believers with greed and worse
Priests touching on the kids spread disease in Church
They preach that love when they speak to the parish
But how quick they change it up when it's same sex marriage
They preach that love when they speak to the parish
But how quick they change it up when it's same sex marriage

[Chorus]

Congregation gon' say amen
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation can't say "awoman"
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation gon' say amen
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation can't say "awoman"
Congregation gon' say amen

Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but...

[Verse 3]

One side call me a terrorist the other side a heretic
Dirty Jerz devilish with fanatical rhetoric
Throw stones if you without sin
Don't forget your holy water go and dive right in
Dogmatic practise they fight us my fakers
You're saved when your savings are in collection plates
They must not really believe it
Cause they soul hell-bent on forcing others agreements
Lord Jesus, when the messiah returns
She'll be crucified all over Lord when will they learn?
It's like lambs to the slaughter
If God had a son so why deny him his daughter
So for all of you who think I'm going to hell
How many of y'all gone out to build a school and a well
See Angels ain't perfect even some of them fell
You must not be shit either, how else could you tell?

[Chorus]

Congregation gon' say amen
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation can't say "awoman"
Congregation gon' say amen

Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but...[Refrain: Hasan Salaam]
The power U's a scorcher once she put it on yah got you hooked on her
Allow me to warn yah she ain't no good for yah that's why they call her
Fiend for her spoil her Pay bills support her that's why they call her
Can't refuse the offer once she put it on yah got you hooked on her

[Chorus: Lord Jamar] Ashes to ashes life is just like smoking dust    x4

[Verse1: Hasan Salaam]
Desperation in a whisper from a trick to a stripper
He think he gone get her
She loosening his zipper just to get the wallet quicker
No sex in the picture
She got the game of cat and mouse down to science
Only fucks clients as long as they buying
Meets up discreet and the payments are private
Works grinding in the club to up her clientele
Well aware that sex sells and she pimping it well
Her sweet tooth extends to nose candy as well
Said she hates cocaine but… loves the smell
From blunts laced with yay
To E and special K
Angel run through the alphabet like everyday
All your fantasies a phone call away
She could be anything you want deserves awards for the role play
Queen dominatrix always been her favorite
Feels like her talents wasted on average relations
Been offered everything from a college education
To all expenses paid vacations in the Caymans
It ain't what she's chasing but what she's escaping
Might choose to give it up but what's the toll is taking

[Chorus: Lord Jamar] Ashes to ashes life is just like smoking dust    x4

[Verse2: Hasan Salaam]
Now despite what you'd expect she's not in it for the sex
Attracted to the cash only that paper make her wet
Lost love found her more concerned with a check
Total disrespect made her think it's all she could get
Cause quiet as it's kept
She's blessed with the vocals of a siren
Fallen angel wings clipped violent
The dream fell silent
The stars in her eyelids
Evaporated when her 1st forced his way inside it
Decided at an early age
That this game works both ways might as well get paid
Instead of getting fucked over for it
Might as well leave with something to show for it
Besides being broken hearted
Started off bar hopping to finance her fetish
Repeatedly playing exes living reckless
Heavy'd her soul
With her body exposed
She measured worth in dollar tips after swinging from poles
Cold shoulder
For real brothers that'll love her
But she hot to suck a dick for the rent without a rubber
Just another notch
Nameless encounter
Might forget your wife for the night but you could never forget about her… Angel

[Chorus: Lord Jamar] Ashes to ashes life is just like smoking dust    x4

[Verse3: Hasan Salaam]
Angel always planned to take it on the road to LA LA land
Find a rich man and tan on the Malibu sands
Took a chance and booked a couple locked doors in advance
Expanded past the avenue
Pussy's international
Set up a cam and a website
Red light specials just to prove that her heads right
Never saved a penny for a rainy day or valued the cost
Of possibly losing the looks or the body falling off

[Refrain: Hasan Salaam]
The power U's a scorcher once she put it on yah got you hooked on her
Allow me to warn yah she ain't no good for yah that's why they call her
Fiend for her spoil her Pay bills support her that's why they call her
Can't refuse the offer once she put it on yah got you hooked on her

[Chorus: Lord Jamar] Ashes to ashes life is just like smoking dust    x4[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

I was there at the moment she died
Eyes wide open fixated on what waited on the other side
Doris Luke left at 9:45
Just the way she would’ve wanted on the wings of the sunrise
She kept her word down to the day that she passed away
Made a promise she would end a hospital stay
To watch the All Star game in a couple of days
Me and Dro wound up giving her the play by play
Allen I was her favorite
Even rocked his jersey during games and raised an arm whenever he made it
Every call by the refs was thoroughly debated
Reminiscing got me missing all the time that I wasted
I wasn’t always so patient
We argued like most family do and she knew just how to say shit
Screaming at the dealers on some government name shit
Like David don’t sell that mess in front of my pavement
Always decked out for holidays no doubt
Nuff Christmas lights to land a plane in front of her house
She defined ghetto fabulous
Planted silk flowers in the garden and grilled the best government cheese sandwiches
Shit I thought I could handle it
Sip on some yak keep a candle lit and just reach on
But now it’s just me and my Moms
And she keep wanting to speak on what ima do when she’s gone
Not a day goes by I ain't playing her songs
Year later waiting on a call all day long
1st born day without hearing her voice on the horn
Had me finally realizing my Grandmother was gone
Just go and ask anyone on Kenwood Ave
About Ms. Luke they’ll probably crack a smile and laugh
Then tell a story just like this 1
About a giant that stood around 4’11 and a half
My Grandmother

[Chorus: Maya Azucena]

That’s just how the story goes
Black Angels they come and they go
And how could I ever forget
The legacy that she left
Now she walks with the angels
My Black angel watching over me

[Verse 2: Drue Davis]

To know you is honor
To love you is a privilege the grand in grandmamma
Im’a say losing sight for you and I both an obstacle
Air through tubes couldn’t bear to see you in the hospital
Bedridden my feeling kept hidden
Resort to all this hiding while trying to keep from crying
So daily I’m denying how and what I feel inside and
You the glue to this family and be lost without your guidance
From you learned self-reliance
How to turn little into a lot and well the proof was in the pot when
Fresh from out your kitchen the scent of collards and chicken
Itching to take a peek in, but I am not want a beating
Was good and when you put your foot in bread pudding
Can surely testify am not nothing like home cooking
At home you made it, though I was frustrated now elated you ascended so
Its time I celebrated
And tell my little cousins and even unto my nieces
That you loved everybody and you're gliding round with Jesus
And know you're looking proudly, and if there’s ever doubt the
Easy breeze from my kitchen tells me that you’re all about me
So
No catching falling stars, or spiritual calling cards
Near or far, know exactly where you are
(In my heart)
Love you ma, but truth be told
An angel must spread its wings, so fly, you are not mine to hold
Mine alone

[Chorus: Maya Azucena]

That’s just how the story goes
Black Angels they come and they go
And how could I ever forget
The legacy that she left
Now she walks with the angels
My Black angel watching over me[Verse 1 - Sicknature]
Freedom is an illusion, from the minute we hatch, we live in a trap
Imprisoned by interest, tax and debt extending the gap
Between the rich and the poor, while the broke are stuck with their baggage shitty
Visas get maxed out from botox and plastic titties
The value of a purchase is promptly diminished
Prices are skyrocketing while the pockets are thinning
Created incidents affect the public opinions
That count for nothing, really, we just think that someone will listen
The lower class is breaking backs, to increase the economy
Human batteries keep competing and feed the plutonomy
Debt is immense, when spending is sort of on snooze
It´s a hard knock life, while more war bucks are pursued
And more inflation is created, made for corporate reasons
This is sexomnia, we´re getting fucked while we´re sleeping
And while we´re busy making ends meet and praying for breakevens
We face another day in the shape of a caged freedom

[Hook - Sicknature]
Hamsterwheel runs, racing with haste
For credits that feed the system
At the end of the day
Its all about the fucking paper we chase
The paper we chase
To buy the same freedom that will pay for the cage (2x)

[Verse 2 - Hasan Salaam]
Another night without sleeping, nother day without eating
Tryna build up the savings so I could buy without leasing
My debt been increasing and its due by the 8th
So when them bill collectors call I'm like "No Habla Ingles"
Everything is out of place, FEDs will build a RICO case
Over mix tapes like I'm pushing weight out of state
Keep some change in a safe and a stash under the mattress
Only render to Caesar's what they could cease for the taxes
Let me explain if you need it broke down
Couple years wiser lotta more know how
Pigs get me cornered I ain't never gon' back down
Go out with a bang like Jomo & the Mau Mau's
Terrestrial flow shit belong in the X-Files
80's baby raised on Reaganomics & crack viles
Problem child I make Mama so proud now
Born to move the crowd direct descendant of Wild Style

[Hook][Verse 1: Kendal Good]

Maybe I’ve been around too long and seen too much
My eyes are stone and the child inside is now grown
And they say that I ain’t change/ But how can that be
Running this new race all I do is pray/ That my past don’t catch me

[Chorus: Kendal Good]

What seems like silence actually screams like a siren
And in a way I forgot why I’m here
In the darkness and quiet we still reach for the light
It ain’t far away
It ain't far away

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

Maybe I done been here to long and seen too much
Lived through nightmares so I don’t dream too much
Seems we keep on with our eyes wide shut
In an uphill climb this world is downside up
Elders told me that I’d wind up
Dead or in jail
If I ain’t wise up before my short times up
Good intentions ain’t enough to pay the rent with
And if you look at my past than it would read that I made to many bad investments
The best lessons are learned the hard way
Spending today got me paying a price putting tomorrow’s on lay away
Hard to say what’s right cause when my backs against the wall let the chips fall where they may
In order to see the light I had to 1st go astray
But I’d never trade places
Cause me and pain know each other
Got acquainted on a 1st name basis

[Chorus: Kendal Good]

What seems like silence actually screams like a siren
And in a way I forgot why I’m here
In the darkness and quiet we still reach for the light
It ain’t far away
It ain't far away

[Bridge: Kendal Good]

If we born with that blank slate
Do the sinning truly dirty up my fate
I gotta conscience but it kick in too late
If I could turn back the hands of time…

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]

It was 2 months and shorty had been missing her period
So I said fuck school and started skipping 6th period
At Planned Parenthood I took the news serious
But knew that I had to stack up some chips period
Immature so I just wasn’t hearing it
Had to be a better Pops than mine was period
Job hunting but truly wasn’t able
To bring home enough doe to make a future home stable
Employers thought that they was robbing the cradle
So I started bagging ounces on Moms kitchen table
Fronted a hundred when the split was 60/40 less than half not enough to take care of a shorty
Didn’t think to tell Moms cause she had some hopes for me
You know the story she wanted some grand-children
That’s when I got the call and shorty was bawling
Said my 1st was born bloody as she sat on the toilet

[Chorus: Kendal Good]

What seems like silence actually screams like a siren
And in a way I forgot why I’m here
In the darkness and quiet we still reach for the light
It ain’t far away
It ain't far away[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

This a renaissance for the art of making love
Jet Setting round the globe with the Mile High Club
Come fly with us friendly skies above
The ultimate high and baby your my drug
So let me explain that making love in the rain will make your whole life change
Said you like it ruff so every spot gets touched
Foreplay to role-play, ropes and handcuffs
So blow a kiss my way turn up the Sade
Lost in the moment been in it since Friday
Ménage à trois c'est la vi
On you, on her and you're both on me… See

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Treat Her like a Queen
Fuck Her like a Porn Star x4

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

I’m a gentleman- open doors and pull out chairs
Behind closed doors- smack ass and pull back hair
Soon as you said King put that right there
Had you up against the wall legs up in the air
So darling move your hips like a lunar eclipse
Honey dipped skin tone been calling for bliss
Could tell how you want it from the way that you kiss
So I keep a wet smile on all four of your lips


[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Treat Her like a Queen
Fuck Her like a Porn Star x4


[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]

Girl you just like me always stay in the mood
Rest of the world disappear when we get up in our groove
Cocoa butter smooth
Dance step know all the moves
And your legs look amazing is some high heel shoes
Couldn’t choose a favorite body part
It’s all a work of art
You got the Mona Lisa on smash
Said your clothes look good on yah but they look better off yah
So let’s make sure the good shit last
Take um off for me


[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Treat Her like a Queen
Fuck Her like a Porn Star x4

[Outro: Hasan Salaam]
I’m baptized in your thighs when your body explodes x3
