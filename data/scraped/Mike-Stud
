[Hook]
You only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Woah-oh (x2)
Only know you've been high when you feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
You only know you love her when you let her go
But you let her go

[Verse 1]
Look, see I remember when I met you as a sophomore
Started out as friends but I knew that we would want more
Hit your favorite restaurant, with your favorite dress on
That's one of my favorite memories that I've kept on the road with me
I know it's crazy how things change so quick
Went from rock bottom to all this fame and shit
But look, I couldn't love you but I wished I could
Cause I got hurt and closed you off, and you understood
But look, yeah, that's just blood on the leaves
The champagne tastes worse when it wasn't for free
That's why these thirsty bitches didn't come here with me
Move along girl, there's nothing to see
And what a blessing every second is, missed calls and messages
I miss the nights when you would call, just checkin' in
The girl I love, I ain't seen her in months
That's just the cost of being up in the front
And yeah, we used to say this world was ours together
Yeah, the pain fades away but the scar's forever
And fate hurts but remember the hope
Cause things change but the memories don't

[Hook]

[Bridge]
My bitches, my bitches (x4)
When I'm out here on the road, it's just me and my bitches
Shit is all I know, just me and my bitches
But girl trust me, this is how it's gotta be
When I close my eyes, you're the one that I see cause -

[Hook][Verse 1: Huey Mack]
Too faded off of the Bombay
Drinking it straight because I love the taste
I'd pour out some liquor for all the careers that I'm stealing, but that'd be a waste
Fuck all that hate
Still getting paid, out my suitcase while I move state to state
All of these rappers like Chucky, they all make me chuckle
I swear that it's so Child's Play
Yeah, copped me a crib way out there in L.A
Two thousand miles away
Bro you so local and I'm on a plane
Can't even hear the shit you got to say
Still throwing shade
Fuck it, I'll dig you a grave
Just copped a benz, that's a rapper cliché
Never putting my foot up on the brakes
Cause I came to this motherfucker to stay

[Hook: Huey Mack]
You don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, that's cool
That's cool, yeah that's cool
She wanna fuck with me, I wanna fuck her too, that's cool
That's cool, yeah that's cool (that's cool)
Bitch you know that it's mutual
So mutual
Bitch you, bitch you know that it's mutual
So mutual

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
You throwing shade from my shadow
But that don't make sense to me, dog
You ain't offending me, dog
You cannot get to me
That's black and white like a referee dog, like
Hold up, I got this
Let me get something off my conscience
I don't give a fuck, I promise (x2)
My women hot and my vodka chilled
Never cuff 'em but trust me, I cop a feel
Got a spot way, way up, on top the hill
Up late talking life like I'm Dr. Phil
I got a plot to kill, plus I got the skill
And I can't say the same for you
Cause nowadays other people mistake fake for cool
But just cause you want it, that don't make it true
Now ain't that the truth

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Huey Mack]
You don't like me, well that's cool
I know way too many people who do
But that's mutual, you one of the few
I think you just mad that I don't fuck with you
Look, I made a name off of rap, that's why they mad
Oh that's your girl? She got back
She want to fuck me, I know
Gave me a blowie cause I'm 'bout to blow, woah
I don't believe in monogamy, I'm 'bout my green like a cup of tea
She say she loving me
I took her back to the telly
We fuck in the shower, she sing like she Becky G
Same kid from a year ago, except
I'm the one that they talking 'bout
And Nick Cannon can't even try to imagine the level that we Wild 'N Out
Ow

[Hook][Verse 1]
They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired, your kiss has got me wired

[Hook]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows
I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Verse 2]
We can leave the night on, but tell me what you're doing tonight
If it ain't me then you ain't doin' it right, right?
You lookin' sexy all in that dress, sending X's and O's in your texts
And that sex you know is the best, lemme show you how I do
Woo, time out
You so bad you need a shoutout
Let's go somewhere else and vibe out
With that tan skin and them red lips, can't imagine how the head is
I'm playing, I'm just saying
I think it's time we get involved
No need to talk, that look says it all
Yeah, but for real this feel like something I would want forever
We found each other, let's get lost together

[Hook]

[Bridge]
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon
We can leave the night on

[Hook][Intro: Matthew McConaughey]
"Mmm mmm mmmm. Here's the game plan. I do it cause I fucking need to."

[Hook]
Could've been on Wall Street
Should've been on a ball team
Could give a fuck about y'all team
Cause I don't really feel none of y'all, morphine
Wall Street (x6)
Now my stock rising, got they eyes on me

[Verse 1]
Had drive since the car seat
Now it's floor seats for the posse
And if you're asking what it costs me
Honestly nothing because they comp me
Killin' em softly, this ain't a movie but I'm on the reel
Still with a few G's like I'm Lauryn Hill
The summer tour net a quarter mill and I'm touring still
Pocket full of foreign bills
I'm talking cake, that Niykee Heaton
That Jen Selter, ooh, sweet Jesus
And my lawyer said don't sign no release
We call 'em the Middle East cause they all want a piece

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We at the parties with the passwords
On the rocks, whaddup Adler (Cisco)
Jacket full of green like the Masters
Tryna smoke, find the hoes, then we ghost (Casper)
Now we can't remember shit, Alzheimer's
Burn so many joints, you'd think I was arthritis
Better call Midas cause you won't get a break from me
Your girl a layup, so is mine, so I'll take the three
Late night, Letterman, doorman, let 'em in
Send 'em up, get it in, run it back, Edelman
And that's why I don't fuck with Tinder, man
Cause one screenshot, then it's up on Instagram, damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
At 21 I had a midlife crisis
But I ain't lose my head, this ain't ISIS
I just stayed the course, I just paid it forward
Didn't plan it but didn't panic and now I'm making more
Fuck dollars, I need commas
Fuck promise, I need progress
And nowadays I just rage then I get the bill
Hit the stage then I get some Ks like I'm pitching still
And I'mma win, you more like Seattle
Cause when it matters you ain't running shit, you Pete Carroll
I'm young and I'm fucking the game up, I'm making my way up
Straight up, I stay up like that plane from Malaysia (Where'd it go?)

[Hook][Intro]
Why do white people sorta throw shade at each other?
Um, probably if I had to sum it up in my view
It’s ‘cause there’s only so many spots
What’s wrong, Steven?
I’m sensing some weird energy from you

[Verse 1]
Nolan Ryan, first team, what the fuck is happening
I’m pretty sure that I’m the only All American
Got the whole game screaming “Hoodie stop talking”
‘Cause underneath, you’d rather be Pippi Longstocking
And it’s ironic that you say I got the little league fans
Bro your shows, I swear they look just like a middle school dance
Just face it, if you can’t see that get LASIK
Don’t think you’re gonna make it
Everything you said is baseless, you’re basic
I bet that’s why more than one half of your fan base still has braces
‘Cause I haven’t seen so many 12 year olds come out the woodwork since Sandusky’s basement
Man this Twitter shit is getting absurd
I can’t believe you turned my timeline into revenge of the nerds
Steven, you a jackass like Wee Man
Running from all of your demons
Always been the odd kid out, that's tryna get even
But you peaking, homie it’s mine
If you don’t know now, then you know it in time
You don’t know your facts like coke in the trash
Most of your track was throwaway lines
(What do you get when you guzzle down cum?)
Hoodie Allen’s voice when he's singing a song
Oompa loompa doopity doo
If I saw you in public then what would you do? (nothing)
(Steven, you are being an asshole)
Making rape jokes, that’s classy
If you ain’t know just ask me
Not sure if you followed the story at Duke
But the ones who were raped weren't athletes
And you said the only full ride I get is if I hop on your dick
But bro it’s public knowledge, I had a full scholarship

[Interlude]
I mean the amount of irony here is pure comedy
You worked for Google, just google this stuff next time
I mean it’s flat out inaccurate
(He’s always taken things too seriously)

[Verse 2]
Let me get this straight
Are you tryna say that I’m stupid?
I graduated from Duke
Which is ranked the same as the school that you in
That’s UPenn, now that’s stupid
(Oh man, Steve you’re better than that)
When you diss track, you better spit facts when you going at me
See I don’t understand why you’re bringing up age
When, bro you are older than me
And it seems pretty clear that I struck a nerve
Calling me a creep, but you’re named yourself after a fucking perv

[Interlude]
I guess you were just never cut out for Google
I mean take ten minutes out of your day
Do a little background check before you pull the trigger
On a named based off Woody Allen
(It’s just skin, Steven)

[Verse 3]
Are you really tryna say that I still live at home?
It’s pretty clear that there’s a lot you didn’t know
And all this really taught me is that you’re a fucking amateur
You talking ‘bout my mom, but bro your dad’s your fucking manager
‘Bout to fly by like a speeding car
You’re not a star
You look like you should work at a Genius bar
You’re a dork
And honestly, I really liked your song to me
It sucks that you can’t sing at all
‘Cause you look like you belong on Glee
Don’t test me, you fucking around with the wrong athlete
So take that backseat
You belong in Silicon Valley
‘Cause clearly you still got a thing for computers
You’ve tweeted 145,000 times (loser)

[Interlude]
You know Steve, you only live once man
Stop staring at your fucking twitter
Go outside, I know you don’t turn up
But why don't you go have a fucking picnic or something

[Verse 4]
Okay sports reference, short reference
Maybe you shoud try another search engine
Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask Jeeves, it’s really your preference
And I really don’t get this, you’re reckless
You hit me up like two weeks ago
Saying “yo Mike I fuck with your message”
You’re a nitwit, and a hypocrite
And I’m sick of it, you got no friends
You could go to the World Cup and still have no one to kick it with
You’re ridiculous, and all you do is call your fans
‘Cause when you call your friends, all you get is crickets bitch

[Outro]
This is where the healing begins
(First unheard message)
Hi Mike, it’s your mother
I had the Geek Squad over here earlier
I guess one of the guys who came here, Hoodie, Steven
I don’t even know his name
He’s upstairs sniffing through your clothes
He’s putting your jockstrap on his head
He’s acting like a nutcase
This guys seems really obsessive
He found your yearbook
He’s rifling through it, I’m a little nervous
He was even asking for baby pictures
I think he wants to see your ding-a-ling[Hook]
Closer, closer
Closer than I've ever been
Closer, closer
Closer than I've ever been
I just know we getting closer (x2)
Closer than I've ever been

[Verse 1]
I used to dream about showing the world what I dream about
Forget a mic, my whole life I thought it'd be the mound
I guess it's fitting how life threw me the curveball
Pops told me work till you make it, man, then work more
I guess I took that to heart
Cause I've been working harder now than I did at the start
And I won't stop 'till I get to the top
Till I can give all of my fam all the things that they want
But there ain't no doubt, I continue to be the doubted
But that's just motivating, so where would I be without it?
Cause the same people asking why you're doing it
Were asking how you did it
So fuck a critic, stay committed to your vision
They can't see it, it's yours
The top floor looks far when you can't get in the doors
But it's crazy what you can see with your eyes closed
I swear I stay on my grind mode
I know I'm getting closer

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My whole life's been a chase, it's a gift and a curse
Was on my way up to the top and slipped into reverse
And the same thing I thought killed me brought out the real me
And that's real, see
You gotta find what you love and let it kill you
Just gotta live with the will like Uncle Phil do
Cause on the real, everybody go through times when the sun don't shine
Don't know when our time will come, but it will come in time
Cause yo, I said it first, ain't no telling where I'm headed
So this is for the people that was with me when I said it
And when I said it, I meant it
I swear I won't forget it
Told my family and my friends that I'm forever indebted

[Hook]

[Bridge] (x2)
You start losing your mind when you're gone all the time and you always on the move
And you try to remind yourself it's gonna be fine
And you hoping that it's true
But I know we're getting closer

[Hook]

[Outro: Mike's Mother]
Hi buddy, it's me
Just thought we might catch up before you got on the plane
But I just wanted to say hi, and you're hard at work I'm sure
Love you buddy, miss you
It was great having you home, okay
You be careful and keep in touch
And I'll track you and check on you
Bless you, buddy
Bye-bye, honey[Intro]
Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make your ass fall off
And I think I wanna smash 'em all
Speed up, gas pedal (x3)
Speed up, gas pedal (x4)
Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make your ass fall off
I wanna smash 'em all
Speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal (x6)
I wanna smash through all the time, it's always on my mind
It's always on my mind
Speed up, gas pedal

[Verse 1]
November 3rd, time to celebrate
Now here's a power move that I'm tryna generate
Just got a spot in Maui for a private getaway
Doing anything I can for a Kendall Jenner date
But if not then it's on to the next, don't be mad at me
She's the one that's missing out on that Athletic D
So fuck all this acting, I just keep it 100 like Aroldis Chapman
Went from baseball to Batman, I'm kinda the shit
And you just a bat boy so I'm robbing your chick
Cause I ain't got time for a joker, okay, see you later nice to know ya
And my mom think I drink too much, she's probably right
Should probably get my shit together, but not tonight
I'm on the 6th floor drinking a fifth at the Four Seasons
With two bad bitches, and this their first threesome
They just hit me up on Twitter, acting trashy and I think I'm gonna litter
And she like to call me Splinter
Cause the only place she ever wants my wood to be is in her
Alright, okay, y'all recess but I don't play, no way
And she bout to go to work for the night, bend it over now twerk it for Mike

[Bridge]
Speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal (x8)

[Outro]
Jump on it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
Jump on it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
Jump on it, grab the wall, my saddle's waitingFuck being on some chill shit
I go 0 to 100 homie, real quick
Real quick, super quick
Well I'm swinging for the fences, call that Big Papi
Shit changed after Tommy boy, Chris Farley
And before that, well I thought I had it planned
But I made my own breaks, call that Tom Callahan
I'm just trying to get it, then I did it
If it's a lyric then I lived it, don't you get it?
I'm the realest, I just kept my fucking head on straight
You called me out but that's a stretch, like there's men on base
Cause it's all hustle, no luck
This shit hard though
Up against the wall you dropped the ball, Dick Clark
Hold up
This ain't what you want to do
This ain't for fun, I ain't the one you want to run into
Watch what you say, boy
I don't play, boy
Your girl a 5; mine's in Playboy
And fuck H.A.M. I'm going Hamilton, I got 100 dimes
Try to egg me on and shit, but I don't flip, sunny side
Cause there's no point
You ain't got it like I got it
If you try to get out of pocket, I'll serve you like I'm Roddick
You don't want it, nah man you don't want it
Cause I don't think you understand the shit you started
Homie, I was your size back in kindergarten
The shit you're talking is a bit retarded cause it's garbage
Little guy, you a little target
But I got aim though, call me Pedro
And you just clogging up the game and I'm the Drano
I go 0 to 100 real fast, give you whiplash
You just mad you was picked last in gym class
You should've kept your day job
Cause I stay in my zone, Jim Boeheim
So was it worth it to quit?
It's ironic that you left Google
But you still searching for hits and shit
I ain't got one neither, that ain't the point at all
But you dropped two tapes before I made a song
Think about it
If I was on my seventh year with your career
Well shit man, then I'd be pissed off
So fuck being on some chill shit
I go 0 to 100 Hoodie, real quick
I go 0 to a C-Note
I'm Cooperstown, bitch you're more like Cupertino
You computer guy in your suit and tie
Coming at me was kinda sorta like suicide
So run Forrest, go Forrest
You fucking clown, I hope you got some more jokes for us
And after this, nobody gon' do a song with you
You should've known that I was gon' get you
And honestly, I really tried to get along with you
But like the artwork for your song, you had the wrong picture[Hook]
No matter what I say or what I do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
And even when I'm gone, I'll be right by your side 'till 3005
Hold up (x6)

[Verse 1]
Dear Mama, wish you were here Mama
You the best woman in the world, that's how I feel Mama
I'm a world traveler, I know I'm always gone now
Out here on my own now, just tryna make you so proud
I hope you are, just like you hope I make it
Just know that taking care of you's my biggest motivation
You made me everything I am and gave me everything I needed
See I don't say this enough, but I hope you know how much you mean to me
I love you

[Hook][Verse 1]
I think I'm stuck in the middle of never caring or caring too much
Too many of these after parties to ever pursue love
And you know that I've been chasing bills, Cosby
Tryna get top of the hill figures like Tommy
Cause real recognize real like we related
One night with bitches that'd much rather be dated
I'm just faded, but it feel like we gon' make it
Team full of stars, my life's a constellation
Tyler got that new Ferrari, and Marcus went and got that Audi
And I ain't make it to my drafting day
Ain't got that athlete money, but the ass is great

[Hook]
Man, I swear it's all good
Yeah, I swear it's all good
Man, you know it's all good
She came with you, left with me
But I swear she all good
Yeah, I swear it's all good
Man, you know it's all good
I swear it's all good

[Verse 2]
She thought I was a douchebag, but that's before she met me
Keep my circle small; they're the few that really get me
And my eyes are getting heavy but I'm pushing on
Come through, I got a list that we could put you on
I swear it's all good, and everything is kosher
My sex on the beach on the coast and yours is on a coaster
And you can say I'm doing better than before
You look amazing in that dress, but it'd look better on the floor
Now I should probably close the tab out
And I should probably call the cab now
I got a crib with the city in the background
Take you back now, make you tap out
Call your man now, tell him that you all -

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ex messaging my phone now, asking when I'm coming home now
I'd rather do this on my own now, I really mean it
Cause fuck love, that shit is inconvenient
I ain't got the time
I'm on my grind though, million dollars on the line - nope
I ain't sign, no
Cause every day I negate all the connotations
And people that try to hate and debate on my rise to greatness
But I swear, I swear it's all -

[Hook][Verse 1]
Versace, versace
No, fuck that
Where my cup at?
Money on my mind like a Bucks hat
On point like a thumbtack and I'm up next, oh yeah
Are you sick of me yet?
Get love every city we at
Run around a map like a victory lap
Check YouTube if you need a recap
Man, dressed like a jock, fuck designer
Coming up behind ya, tryna fuck Rihanna
And I'mma do that, damn right I'mma do that
Oh Kendall Jenner, I can't forget her
Man, that girl bad and I want her in the worst way
She's 17? Well, when the fuck is her birthday?
Versace, versace
I do what I want and ain't nobody stopping me
Just bought so much property, my life feels like a game of Monopoly
Out on the cape and we party with Seguin, I'm cool on the hockey scene
Two chicks: one black, one white, that's right, I'm supporting equality
Bang
Now all of these dudes trying to copy me, I'm starting to get pissed off
Walk around town and I see myself, feeling like Chris Paul
Come to a show and got all of these hoes fighting for some camera time

[Hook]
Cause I got white girls going crazy, Amanda Bynes
Yeah
I got white girls going crazy, Amanda Bynes
Amanda Bynes
I got white girls going crazy

[Verse 2]
Aw man, aw damn he goin' ham again
For the cheese they keep making me a sandwich in
Got heat, so I gotta keep the candle lit
Got 'em standing in place like a mannequin
Ah, oh baby
Dear God, don't hate
But I'm with both of your exes and they thirsty, Dos Equis
I got her saying shit she'd never say
Says she likes when Mike's hard, but she ain't drinking lemonade
Get it straight, alright okay
I beg your pardon, I came to party
She said to me: "Mike, can we fuck please?"
And I said: "No doubt, Gwen Stefani"
Fuck with me though, fuck with me though
Please keep it down, I got company though
24 years old, with a quarter million on my company card
I get it, I get why these guys is hating
I keep saying no to these deals, even Howie Mandel is getting impatient
Versace, versace
My sushi is good and so is my sake
You're the man on Twitter, that's cool my g, but in person you're sloppy
Better handle all that
Zone d, bruh, better fall back
That's just how I does it
Dude got left but he had it coming
Pause[Verse 1]
What up world, welcome to the major leagues
Style's sick, quick to make a hater sneeze
Baby girl, I'm just that official
Need a tall glass of me just to wet your whistle
I stay high, stay fly, I'm a frequent flyer
I got the belt, I'm the king, call me Sire
Mike Stud, but you can call me Vinny Chase
I'm with the model chick
Pretty face, skinny waist
I dick her down, she needs CPR
Then she want a replay, like DVR
And I roll with the top dogs
We shut the party down, like cop cars
Next night I'm in the bar with some heavy hitters
And the girls on our balls like spaghetti dinners
I'm the kid with the glamour
Willy Beamen, I live for the camera

[Hook]
Stand up, what now?
Hands up, touchdown
Touchdown, yeah everybody
Put your motherfuckin' hands in the air
[X2]
Now bounce, come on, bounce, come on
Bounce
Come on, bounce
Put your motherfuckin' hands in the air
[X2]
Now bounce, come on, bounce, come on
Bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch

[Verse 2]
Fuck patience, I'm tired of waitin'
I'm speeding to the top, it's a violation
Green light, go and write the ticket
So close to the top spot that I can sniff it
You smell that? Yeah me too
Catch me out in Maui with a brew on a ski doo
What up girl, I know you like that
Damn right come here, I know you like that
Mike Stud, the cook, I got the recipe
Sittin' on top of the bread like a sesame
And I got my enemies in a frenzy
Makin' memories while you're barely makin' ends meet
Nobody sick as me, run y'all history
Go on, get a clue, I'm an unsolved mystery
And I do it on a day to day basis
They try to hate, but you can't erase greatness

[Hook][Hook: Mike Stud]
And they say she’s in the Class A-team
Stuck in her day-dream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems to slowly sink, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream, “worse things in life come free to us”
Cause we’re just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
She don’t wanna go outside tonight
And in the pipe, she flies to the motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Dark room, starin’ down a bottle
Blank face with the figure of a model
These cold nights, too often to be coincidence
Used to be an artist now the pipe's the only instrument

A-Student, her friends loved her to death
Her assessment of her men just wasn’t the best
They met freshman year, fell in love on a whim
Left after first semester, all she wanted was him

Didn’t love gettin’ high, but did it because he wanted to
Little scared, but how much damage could marijuana do?
Weed turned to pills, pills turned to pain
Personality changed, nothin’ was the same

Now he didn’t wanna kiss her, didn’t wanna love her
Everything was fuckin’ different, he left to find another
So hurt, and embarrassed
All she got was dial tones every time she called her parents

Move along, move along: what she told herself
Had to find the means so she sold herself
Used her body for a buck, but hardly was a slut
She would cry herself to sleep after every single fuck

Lost track of her reality
Thoughts of her addiction made her think this how it had to be
Now she stands, lifted on that balcony
Lost soul and ready to be a casualty

Found a star, to make one last wish
Brought the pipe up to her mouth, for one last hit
It was the ultimate high, took a breath and closed her eyes
And jumped off the ledge, she was ready to fly[Hook]
Uh, walk up in the spot with the crew
Ooh, yeah girl you're hot who are you
Do anything you want make a move
Now take it to the floor and work it like an athlete
Like an athlete (x6)
Now baby work it out like an athlete

[Verse 1: DJ Carnage]
Young dolla
Young don killa
Flashy ass nigga with the Range I'm a dealer
Loaded in the club
My many ass niggas
Going A-T with my Oakland side killas
Bad yellow bitch fucking with a nigga
Shawty faded then I pass it to my nigga
We keep it rolling keep it rolling like a track team
I got a white bitch her name is Angelina
Bad bitch bad bitch classy
Drop it to the floor make it nasty
She make it clap clap, oh you fancy
100 dollar bills like an athlete

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Role player
She like to play her part
She give us all brain
That's her train of thought
Long legs, outfit super
I'm thinking of head and I ain't talking bout the future
Uh, team Husky you lucky
Now you're bout to touch more dick than Sandusky
Ow! So take it to the floor
Easy isn't fun girl make me want it more
Not an amateur baby I got stamina
Fuck your girlfriend I got a homie that can handle her
Now she grinding on the D like a skate park
I hit it hard from the back she need State Farm

[Hook][Hook: Rich Young]
See I'm back again
I got class again
Man I miss my friends
We gon' do it again

It's been a hell of a summer
It's been a hell of a summer

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Unpack the car
Throw it in your room
Cause your roommate's home too
And then you're playing 'Rut
Shoo (shoo)
Man I thought I'd never say it
But, class starts soon
And I ain't even complainin'
Bar side partying, shots of Bacardi and
Got a cutie hangin' on the kid like a Cardigan
I been sick, I threw up, and I blew up(I blew up)
As time flies, I never grew up, so
(heh heh)
I try and tell 'em Ima do it
Teacher said music wasn't worth pursuin'
But believe me, I'm doing both, getting greedy
Cause life is a bitch and a slut
It's easy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Back to school back to school Mr. Madison
Lights, camera, actionin'
Drinkin' and we're packin' lips
Sorry Mama, I'm working on my future though
Meanwhile I party hard, like I won the Superbowl
Class by the day, rowdy in the evening
Got a ground too, because I'm outtie every weekend
Havin' a good time in every place I'm landin'
Every town, every city, every campus
Real talk, if I said it then I'm doin' it
Hold up, let me get the cup like the Bruins did
Cheers with a smile, love is what you get
Cause if you're living for the now, there's nothing to regret

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Huey Mack]
Aah, I'm back for that sophomore slump
I'm back to doing what I want
This summer was kinda cool
But I've been waiting for this year to come
They taking shots at me, I'm just taking shots of some rum
I know this shit will be fun, cause all the homies are back here
Facing bottles, we raging harder than last year
I got a new fake, they won't know I'm nineteen
Katy Perry shit, baby, this is just a Teenage Dream
And I'm about to pass all my class with flying colors
Or just get some nice double D's underneath the covers
But either way, I guess you can call it passin'
I'm back smashin' these women, and partying with a passion

[Hook][Intro: Kinetics & Mike Stud]
Drop it (x8)
Bad habits
Drop it (x8)
Yeah, it's Mike Stud and Kinetics
One Love on the track, let's go
We got another one

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Uh huh, look
It's always you I call when the party's ended
Told you what you want even when I hardly meant it
Cause most the time's I'm wrong, at least I'm startin' to admit it
Life's a game and it's on, I'mma make the pieces fit in
Call it Tetris, it's all connected
Like it or not you won't forget this, now check this
See this is me, same dude, different tendencies
Drinking like a Kennedy
Rather be hated than loved for something I pretend to be
It's all relative ain't it
Cause when you think about us, it's all negative ain't it
Told you to do what you wanted to
Fuckin' with these other dudes that we both know that I'm better than, baby
But look—
Now this is my apology
Wasn't my choice
I'm just being who I gotta be
And this is over, no more calls for help
I can't lead you down the road when I'm lost myself

[Hook: Kinetics]
Cause I'm walking away, walking away
From bad habits, bad habits
And every time I try to clear my mind
There's a voice inside and it's so loud
And you look so good
But those looks could kill
And I ain't tryin' to be a man down
But I ain't come around here to stay the night
I'd just thought I'd drop in to say goodbye, say goodbye
To them bad habits, bad habits

[Verse 2: Kinetics]
Check, what, uh huh, kinetics in your headphones
Bad habits, feel like a crack addict
It's black magic – here, you can take it back, have it
Dear bottle, you're the reason I believe in myself
And that's the issue, cause without you I'm in need of some help
But it feels like a lifetime that I could rock with you with me
Back when a Old E 40 was $2.50
Tipsy, with a high guard, but some habits they die hard
Lettin' bygones be bygones, like Jay-Z when he signed Nas
So when these women want expensive vodka
I just pour the Svedka in the Kettle bottle, and see if they sense a problem
Or maybe they're over-sensitive and that sentiment sends 'em the wrong message
Fuck it, I need a tall beverage
But what's the cost of hoping when I lost my focus?
And of course I'm coughing cause I'm claustrophobic and the coffin's closing
I guess you do what you can when they're playin' hardball
Even Lance needed a drug to make his "arm strong"

[Hook: Kinetics]

[Mike Stud]
We don't need to talk no more
I'm leavin' you all alone
I won't look back, I won't do that
Cause me and you don't belong
We don't need to talk no more
I'm leavin' you all alone
I won't look back cause me and you don't belong

[Hook: Kinetics][Verse 1]
Swag, woke up feeling super cool
Next to a couple bitches, but that's more or less the usual
Walking out this label meeting, told 'em I ain't signing shit
'Bout to shut it down this summer, doing shows and signing tits
Woah, I'm in my zone, chugging patron
I'm with my dogs and I wanna bone
So call all your friends and bring them along
And don't come alone unless you want a lot of D, LOL, OMG
Yeah you came here with your man, but you're coming home with me, yeah
And that's just how I give back to the fans
I give them that D, okay now get back to your man

[Hook]
And she said, "boy I know your game, all you want is just sex"
Told her "you can get to steppin, I got girlies on deck"
"And just so you know, this a one time thing, so step up to that plate if you're tryna take a swing"
Batter up (x4)

[Verse 2]
Now she was front row, camera out, Instagram my show
Said my music's picture perfect, so she Instagram my flow
Then she came with us later on and she Instagrammed some more
Then we took some other ones, but she ain't Instagramming those though
But baby I'mma put it on you
I'mma take you Katie Holmes but then I gotta Tom Cruise
Packing Ashton in my cigarillo, yeah that's Kusher
I'm a witty fellow, sent naked pictures to my cell though

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Huey Mack]
This for all of my dreamers, all my non-believers
Finally on the court, I got my ass up off of the bleachers
Never had a coach, I watched from the stands
But I got heart boy
I'm like that motherfucking Tin Man
Started out with a dream, I knew Mike since the beginning
Now they about to see us winning, front row at the Grammys sitting
Forget your deal, forget your label
Got fans on my side
From West Virginia to fucking worldwide

[Hook: Huey Mack]
I'm saying tonight is gonna be the night where everything is coming alive
I don't need all of the lies, just you here by my side
I don't need all of the fame, this was never supposed to happen to me
Don't know where all this gonna lead
But everything will be alright

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
This go out to my momma, this go out to my dad
Always made the best of whatever we had
And he ain't even have a father, he left him alone
And he became the man he is today all on his own
And I respect that, still by me through it all, I swear I won't forget that
No, I can't forget that, no
Now I am becoming everything I wish I would be
And I'm the living proof that it can happen if you believe

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mike Stud]
So tell me what you see, and about everything I've seen
When you take a look at me, and about who I said I'd be
They don't know about us, about us, about us
Been everywhere between hell & back
They don't know about us, about us, about us
And if you hating baby, we gonna tell them that everything will be alright

["Be Alright" portion of Hook][Hook: Kinetics]
All these things bottled up, I needed to say to you
Tried, but I never knew how
But I've been drinking all night, and I think I'm on one
So I might as well do it now
Cause I don't wanna bottle it up, bottle it up, ay yeah
Bottle it up, bottle it up, ay yeah
Bottle it up, bottle it up, ay yeah
We gonna pour it out tonight, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Another night, another flight
This a toast to everything I'm doing right (yeah)
Taking off in the literal sense
But doing music full time is a little intense
And now, I don't know where I'm flying to
I fly, then I land and I party just because I'm signed to
Mind you that I did what I was trying to
Now all I do is get with women that I'm blind to
Saying adios to the girl I love most
And these women on the road don't even come close
At the end of the day, I guess I needed you
Wanted it all, but couldn't have my cake and eat it too
Never told you anything that you need to know
And it seemed that the best bet was for me just to go
What would I say if me and you could have a night alone?
But for now, I'm gonna tell it to this microphone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kinetics]
Uh yeah, bottle it up
We don't stop pouring the bottles until the bottoms are up
And we don't have a chaser here to follow it up
Cause we like the way the honesty burns
So we turn the lights low when we took shots
Y'all don't got that good pot
Y'all need to invest in better trees, Woodstock
Cause tonight we getting faded like it's '69
Till I tell you everything that I have bottled up inside
We build clocks, print calendars, and predict the weather
But when we stop to sit, we never think to sit together
I just want to sit next to you to confess to you
I could write a book with all the things I never said to you
Why tell it all when I make a track
Cause if you wear a hard cover, you'll never make any paper back
Look you in the eyes when I state a fact
So when I finally say it, I will never take it back

[Hook]

[Bridge]
They know, they know, they know (I think they know)
They know, they know, they know (Do they really know?)
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]
Yeah, uh, but do they really know?
It started as a hobby, now I'm sitting in the lobby
Kicking it with a hottie like I'm teaching her karate
This a toast to Tommy, and this song for you
Almost gave up when baseball was falling through
And nobody more surprised than I am
Cause honestly, none of this shit was part of my plan
But I continued doing me though
Putting on this front like life is easy as a free throw
So, all this shit is one big trick up my sleeve
Cause if you're overwhelmed then you'll underachieve
Well, this is a plea, for all y'all to listen
This music is my bottle, that all y'all are drinking

[Hook][Intro: Accent]
It's Accent, Kinetics, Mike Stud
Let's get it

[Hook: Kinetics]
All these things bottled up, I needed to say to you
Tried, but I never knew how
But I've been drinking all night, and I think I'm on one
So I might as well do it now
Cause I don't wanna bottle it up, bottle it up, ay yeah
Bottle it up, bottle it up, ay yeah
Bottle it up, bottle it up, ay yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Accent]
I can't bottle this up, with my drunk ass
That's why I got this cup, to have another rum glass
There's still not enough shots for us, I'm fuckin' [?]
So I'm 'bout to bust some shots and thrust us out, my guns a-blast
Somethin' fast
Don't even ask me who the thuggest is
A-double is, and if you ain't know it then you full of piss
Full of spit, take a deep breath, that's when I pull the trig'
Connecting underground spots like a squirrel's burrowed bridge
I'm like a fuckin' bear, more like hug-a-bear
But it's like a fuckin' bear hug, when I hug a bear
Plug a deer, bright orange vest, while a chug a beer
[?] while a puff that air
I stuff that air with words that ooze from my inner
Grit my teeth and groan like someone put glue in my dinner
I poo in your dinner, remember that you's a beginner
We choose to be winners to fools who refuse to forget us

[Hook][Verse 1]
No girl, got yours for the weekend, though
Your girl taken, call Liam Neeson, bro
Spring season, mini-skirt sequins flow
I got her leakin' and I ain't even beatin', though
Easy ho, balcony views, some Pinot Grigio
Now take it to the floor and play the piccolo
Now we having a good time, so you can be my girl, but only for the night
Now listen

[Hook]
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
I can't be your boyfriend, I thought I'd let you know
That we can have some fun to tonight, but then I got to go
So you can find a better man out there on your own
Cause if I was your boyfriend, I know I'd do you wrong
I know I'd do you wrong

[Verse 2]
Let's make a video and put it on the internet
Good head, girl, I call it intellect
Best you ever had and I ain't even finished yet
Do you so good even the neighbors need a cigarette
Call me Deion, the way I put the D on
Take you to the bed, the bath, and beyond
Then I need to be gone, I got a flight to be on
But, I never told you different
Girl listen

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You got a prince, not a king, I'm a duvet
'Bout to move in on the queen like I'm playing chess
Yes, tell me what you want to do to me
Come in the room with me, cutting like a movie scene
Yeah, you got a man? I'm chilling
My heart's got ED, it's no hard feelings
And, let me take you where you want to go
And, this is something that you got to know

[Hook][Hook]
We the boys of the summer
Roll the windows down when we in your town
You know we the boys of the summer
Everybody know us, everybody show love
You know we the boys of the summer
Everybody know us, everybody show love
You know we the boys of the summer

[Verse 1]
Okay, we on a roll like Michelin
Sun's out but I'm cold like Michigan
And everybody listening, music you can feel though
No tires, but it's been a good year though
And I'm for real though, everybody know us now
40 city tour, I'mma go out and shut down
So let's get it in though, smoking out the window
Whole family with me, got me feeling like a Winslow
Cause we ain't getting any younger
One more time for the boys of the summer
So we living like tonight is the night
Come with us and have the time of your life

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And we gon' party to this song
Life's short so my drink tall, yeah let's get gone
Cause we always got a place to go
Left lane where success came, never take it slow
I'm just tryna live, so they follow like we know the way
Pretty girls sliding through the crib like a stolen base
And it go on and on, until they had enough
And after that, you know the deal baby: batter up
Cause we ain't getting any younger
One more time for the boys of the summer
So we living like tonight is the night
Come with us and have the time of your life

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Take those tits out for the boys, tits out for the boys
Tits out for the boys of the summer, for the boys of the summer
I said take those tits out for the boys, tits out for the boys of the summer
We the boys of the summer

[Hook][Intro]
Let me show you how I break it down, oh baby
Let me show you how I break it down, uhyup
Wassup, wassup, man, Sunday Stud Day freestyle edition
The Mike Stud way
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Alright, okay
Bout to shut it down on Sunday
And I'm fresh to death, I belong on a runway
So throw me that ball, I thrive on this especially
Talkin' 'bout some sex with me, damn right I got athletic D
So lights out, don't strike out, like I'm Mike Trout
I be killing it on the daily, work hard, never lazy
But I ain't really ballin' though, closest thing I got to 30 rocks is Alec Baldwin though

[Hook]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me, smoke an L in the back of the Benzie
Oh, why do I feel this way?
Cause all I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I don't give a fuck, my excuse is that I'm young
Cause I'm on one
Still got my money
Cause I'm on one
Damn right, I still got my money

[Verse 2]
Let me start this shit off with something I had to say
Remixed Nelly "Ride Wit Me", shoutout Connor Cadaret
He requested that, yes in fact
Freestyle, I'm the best with that
Made a lot of money and invested that
So throw me that ball
Let me get a little warmed up, like some foreplay
But when I go all the way, I keep it wrapped up like Chipotle
And this like four in the morning
Stay tuned, coming soon is some brand new Touring's Boring
So

[Hook]

[Outro]
Let me show you how I break it down, oh baby
Let me show you how I break it down, yup yup[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
I got 2 major hits bitch, I know you heard of them
Yes this the 3rd of them, aha, I murder them
Running on the track, matter of fact, I am hurdlin'
Cause I am Vinny chasing my dreams and they all Turtlin' hah
And I do it for my city, my tracks get spins the way I'm feeling dizzy
Damn and I grind till I get mine, so I keep it on the real like a fish line
Nah, I ain't saying I'm the greatest, but I'm blowing I think it's time that we face it
Now I'm practically famous, constant interviews and never ending arrangements
White tee fresh snapback running through these lines like a motherfucking half back
And I'm making them duck, no aflack
Mike Stud bitch, the new face of frat rap

[Hook: Missy Modell]
Knock me down and I'll get up
Turn me off and I'll go up
Never stopping down, never breaking down
Cause you can't stop me
Knock me down and I'll get up
Turn me off and I'll go up
Never stopping down, never breaking down
Cause you can't stop me

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Okay, you can catch me in the spot, never stop, in the studio
Never gonna flop no I'm not, Ricky Rubio
And I am on a roll, no sushi though
I be killing tracks man I got that call of duty flow
Flow right, never lefty
Don't test me, bars like Nestle
And I'm a jerk, for whatever it's worth
I wear a suit in the booth, cause I'm ready to work, boy
Flow nuts homie, like cashew
And soon I will be running the game like Nash do
Zoom right past you, swag top notch
Bounce around the map like I'm playing fucking hopscotch
But life is just a busy road, we doing city shows
And shooting videos
I don't got time for you, it only took 6 months and I signed with nue, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]
Hey, hey, hey, look
Something for you ear drum
I know the haters talking but I don't really hear them
So I'm flier than a pilot
Making a lot of noise, I'll retire when it's quiet
But I mean, I really don't see that happening any time soon though
Cause I got hits on deck, biatch, haha
Oh, oh, yeah

[Outro: Mike Stud]
Jon K on the track, Missy Modell just making the track real sexy
Yeah it's Mike Stud homie[Hook]
Girl drop it to the floor, I love the way that booty goes
All I wanna do is sit and watch you move while I proceed to blow this cash

[Verse 1]
OK, now stop, lemme talk for a little
I'm not Malcolm but I'm stuck in the middle
Of a couple pretty women, and a cup of chilly liquor
And they digging every minute, so they wonder why they get it
Oh Lord, have mercy, hit it hard like the home run derby
Quit playing girlfriend I know you've heard of me
Going in on every track like a surgery, ow
Got cheap champagne up on my rider
Going H.A.M.mer every night
Good thing the bus comes with the driver
Am I alive or dreaming, cause I'm living like a boss do
Who knew the boy from Duke had more soul than horseshoes
Pow, tell me how you like me know
Fresh up off the bus
Hungover as fuck at Mr. Chow's
All my decisions been driven by intuition
Said this shit from the beginning
I just wish they would have listened, for real
Said this shit from the beginning
I just wish they would have listened for real

[Bridge]
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fucking right, fucking right, alright
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fucking right, fucking right, alright

[Verse 2]
I say "Look ma, No hands", I'm with Fader I go H.A.M
I brought Kilmer, I brought Blue, and ain't got time for no romance
All these motherfuckers getting mad at me
By the way I shut it down so casually
This right here something that you had to see
Hit the stage and I'm bald like Agassi
Okay I'm on it, take my number down and call it
Cause I'm famous from the web, I guess I'm similar to Charlotte
They Pippen I'm Jordan, they shoot and they miss I'm scorin'
Got a leg up on the competition, lookin' like Captain Morgan
But for the record, I just thought I that I should mention
I'm a silver medal in bed, I always come in second
Yeah, my night is free ain't got no plans
I'm Captain Hook, but for this instead of one we got no hands

[Bridge 2]
And we fuck all night till things get right
Then we fuck all night till things get right
Cause I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
It's mine, I spend it
I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
It's mine, I spend it

[Hook][Hook]
Closer, closer
Closer than I've ever been
Closer, closer
Closer than I've ever been
I just know we getting closer (x2)
Closer than I've ever been

[Verse 1]
I used to dream about showing the world what I dream about
Forget a mic, my whole life I thought it'd be the mound
I guess it's fitting how life threw me the curveball
Pops told me work till you make it, man, then work more
I guess I took that to heart
Cause I've been working harder now than I did at the start
And I won't stop 'till I get to the top
Till I can give all of my fam all the things that they want
But there ain't no doubt, I continue to be the doubted
But that's just motivating, so where would I be without it?
Cause the same people asking why you're doing it
Were asking how you did it
So fuck a critic, stay committed to your vision
They can't see it, it's yours
The top floor looks far when you can't get in the doors
But it's crazy what you can see with your eyes closed
I swear I stay on my grind mode
I know I'm getting closer

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My whole life's been a chase, it's a gift and a curse
Was on my way up to the top and slipped into reverse
And the same thing I thought killed me brought out the real me
And that's real, see
You gotta find what you love and let it kill you
Just gotta live with the will like Uncle Phil do
Cause on the real, everybody go through times when the sun don't shine
Don't know when our time will come, but it will come in time
Cause yo, I said it first, ain't no telling where I'm headed
So this is for the people that was with me when I said it
And when I said it, I meant it
I swear I won't forget it
Told my family and my friends that I'm forever indebted

[Hook]

[Bridge] (x2)
You start losing your mind when you're gone all the time and you always on the move
And you try to remind yourself it's gonna be fine
And you hoping that it's true
But I know we're getting closer

[Hook]

[Outro: Mike's Mother]
Hi buddy, it's me
Just thought we might catch up before you got on the plane
But I just wanted to say hi, and you're hard at work I'm sure
Love you buddy, miss you
It was great having you home, okay
You be careful and keep in touch
And I'll track you and check on you
Bless you, buddy
Bye-bye, honey[Verse 1]
