[Intro]
Alright
Uh, uh, uh

[Hook]
Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

[Verse 1]
I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
Step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it
Don't give a fuck, pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel
We had females come in every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focused on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob, scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand
Steady handling my job, time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent, nigga, shit
Bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My fleeting thoughts on a leash
For the moment, high as fuck
I've been alone in my shit, for the longest
Snakes sliding in the street
Momma taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them
Pigs, riding in 'em
I'm a target so it's hard to even eye me in 'em
If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him
There's no time for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight like a collar
When you iron that
Thinking 'bout my grandmama, find a bottle
I'mma wallow when I lie in that
I just want my time and my mind intact
When they both gone, you can't buy 'em back

[Outro][Intro: Taco]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awwwwk

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says "Catch up, nigga" it looks like an accident
Um, flowin' like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimickin' a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissin' bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fuckin' Logic contradictin' dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshin' in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryna smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your mothafuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bi, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

[Interlude]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang (Yeah, fuck that)

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til' the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin'-ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
Shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that mothafuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape...and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the nigga in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah, Golf Wang[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
Promise Heron I'll put my fist up, after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
With that fucking flow that s-s-so belittles men
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas, nigga listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it, in turn, these critics and interns
Admitting the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces
Writ, it affixed, learning them digits
And simultaneously, dispelling one-trick-pony myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fucking six-nigga energy
And crawling down 'Fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shouting, thrashing
These niggas done let the Kraken out
Crack-a-lacking, like snap, crackle, popping your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga

[Hook: Casey Veggies & (Earl Sweatshirt)]
'87 roof top, Bronson
Whipping hoopties tryna boost raw chronic
(Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock vomit up)
(Sub rocking, thud knocking niggas teeth loose)
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop (Rolling with that flow swamp)
Catch me over stove top (Rapping to that coke rock)
(Passionless in old Jive clothing, with them doors wide open)
(Dim the floor lights, focused) Like it's nothing, cause it's nothing, bitch

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
From a city that's recession-hit
With stress niggas could flex metal with
Peddle to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments, trying to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde, and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breaking news: death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fucking sky that you praying to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
Disappear again, reappear bearded
On top of a lear, steering it into the kids' ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot Earl
Rawer than the skinned knee cap on the blacktop
Salivary glands, lighter fluid for the matchbox
Striking, wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy, oh boy, I'm bad as burnt pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the Little Nick, nimble, rickrolling
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Quit with all that tough talk, bruh
We know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down, bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed
I'm ready to kill, so test it, all my weapons is real
Selling thizz, couldn't tell him what the recipe is
Got 'em wishing that they never gave these weapons to kids
Cheers, send chills up spines of fat bitches
After shows throwing out sandwiches, niggas get it
How they live and I live for money, other words, I'm getting money
Little boy told me when it's time to ride, they'll send up for me
Ain't nobody scaring me, niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94, would've had 'em walking down Death Row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me, "Wet 'em if they test you"
So it's Raging Waters season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seeing
Kitten soft but in they songs be trapping hard as Jeezy
I don't believe it
But to each his own, I ain't tripping long as I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass
Tell 'em "Free Smalls," off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief for police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby J, bony niggas spraying K's
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain

[Outro]
Like it's nothing, cause it's nothing, bitch[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can’t pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain’t around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy’s Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof
There’s nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We’ll both be high, the help don’t stare
They just walk by, they must don’t care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can’t pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain’t around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy’s Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Bridge]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Oh, real love

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Close your eyes to what you can't imagine
We are the xany-gnashing
Caddy-smashing, bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts
Don’t believe us
Treat us like we can’t erupt, yup

[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I’ll jump, I never do
But when I’m drunk I act a fool
Talking bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I’m on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don’t end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can’t pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain’t around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy’s Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Outro]
Real love, ain't that something rare
I’m searching for a real love, talking bout real love
Real love yeah
Real love
I’m searching for a real love
Talking bout a real love[Hook]
Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

[Verse 1]
It's probably been twelve years since my father left, left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly I miss this nigga, like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened, it's evident
And them eyes where he hiding all them icicles at

[Hook]

[Interlude]
"Can I get that, oh... let me get that beat in my headphones, louder."

[Verse 2]
Uh... time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome, trying to make it from the bottom of Syd's
Feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, "I like attention"
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right? Like, "Thanks so much, you made my life
Harder, and the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit"
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

[Hook][Verse 1: Earl]
Intercepting a fifth of whisky
And necking it 'til I'm dizzy
I never was defenseless
I never hugged the fence
I pick a side and trust in it
Stomach full of drugs and shit
My niggas on some other
Cleanse Sunday, binge Monday
Then another six days
Back to Sunday when it's done again (shit)
And the pants better be creased on my corpse
If you need that, run until the street lights off
Back got bigger, got the team strapped on
And you thought it was magic
But that's just the difference
Nigga my team is magicians
We think of the shit that we want then we get it
Look I got hoes in my britches
Big Up Dill & Britches
Full part coming soon
Thought you knew this my nigga
It's crackin like french tips
Just checkin and balancing
And checks and salaries
Testing my friendships
Cause niggas get sour of this
Rap shit got the best of me
I threw the rest off the balcony
Shoutout Da$h and Retchy
I know yo bitch check for me
So much for chivalry
So long to every bitch tryna get intimate
I'm in my 20s now
Feet aimed at the jaws of the running mouth
Disdain for the law since a fucking child
Spotlights on me I ain't stopping in my tracks
We taking it all and we running out
Threw shade in the past but you want me now ho
Put your face in your palm when I come around ya
Tell momma get a gun if I get too popular
I'm just being honest with it
Tell her stop whining, it ain't no mo problems
I'm the best out of all these niggas
Watch your tone when you speaking
Ain't no home for the weak and
No rest for your ass if I know that you're sleeping
I'm here and I'm there
And I'm up and I'm down
And I'm low and I'm peakin
It's cold in the deep end

[Hook] x2
Bitch nigga, we the train
If you see 'em wave
Ain't no bitch in my DNA

[Verse 2: Na'kel]
Hundred blunts, niggas chains, that's my day to day
Niggas tryna ride my train like they fucking strays
My bro left today, fuck
Hot sauce in my cup of noodles, you taught me that
I ain't seen us in years
And this news right here almost made me have a heart attack
Your momma  heart intact
We just spoke, I couldn't stomach that
I'm going to London on the first, I'm bringing you something back
A house on the hill with a big ass grill
Where we could have a boxing match
Japan, Australia, I know you be proud of that
I got a couple bitches now, I ain't gotta lie about that
I know you in a better place, I can't even cry about that
When I look into the clouds, I know you look down on me
Right next to grandmammy
And the rest of the ones who wanna see me happy[Hook]
Get your lady
Cop piff, inhale and cough
Rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick and playing cautious

[Verse 1]
I'mma show you how it's done right, nigga
Drop this when the sunlight gone
Better run right home when the sky turn black
Screaming "fuck five-0" 'til my line go flat
In a ash-gray beamer, we'll be callin that the pigeon coupe
Jackknife bitches to the couches in they living rooms
Ask who the best and I doubt that they picking you
Back like how I need to style, I invented you, yup
Act like you don't know the name
Only time I ain't eating when the cho-cha stanky
Listening to "Pre," getting throat while I lane switch
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pinky, the poster child
You're 'posed to hate me, bold and wild
You broke and angry, my nigga
Name getting bigger than the difference between us
Niggas is fake, I limit the features I give 'em
Sweat (sweat) shirt (shirt)
You know you famous when the niggas that surround you switch
And if they hated in a passive tense
And now they hound your dick
And you ain't ask for this
Now you surrounded with a gaggle of 100 fucking thousand kids
Who you can't get mad at, when they want a pound and pic
Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick
And they the reason that the paper in your trouser's thick
I said sweat (sweat), shirt (shirt)
You can tell the Reaper I'mma meet 'em when he send for me
With a cleaver and  a .30, and some twisted weed
I pick one, and let the crimson leak, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You used to say you like violins and your lifestyle depend on me
And I know it's nighttime when you get lonely
And tell all your little friends how that bitch stole me
And despite all of the facts that you got phony
You gon' tell them about the night that you exposed me
For the bastard I was
And how I probably smashed every bitch that I passed in the club
And the last couple months was the worst
Cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months
That we had as a couple
My absence of fucks
Was a problem that we ain't ever really get to solve
We just smashed and we scuffled
Tryna keep it calm but I snap at you
Now you're taking all your property back and it's obvious that
That apart from the fact that we fuck and it's bomb
And I hate when you home
And I- and when I'm gone I don't call cause you nag
Man, I brought you the shit
And I bought you some shit
What you offering here?
"What the fuck you offering here?"

[Hook][Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Look for me, lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality
High up until the world ends, doing eighty-five in my ride
And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant
I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him I'm a diamond
I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro
Chilling with a vixen, thinking "This is what I did it for"
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
Still trifling, Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Doms, while they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit
I'm shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New patterns patty-caking with mannequins
Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all
Jaw-slacking, all 'em awe struck
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs
And that's, prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit?
And can a real nigga get a look at it? Crook, panic-shook
Ain't ya? Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Cheffing, fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy, running 'til my foot aching
Full-grown terror type, Ferragamo do-rag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans
Smoking 'till I'm loopy as a motherfucking toucan
20 minutes, burn a fucking quarter back to two grams
But I'mma dip, I know you must have had it with my rude assOpen up the case on 'em
Set his own pace, peeped the rats, wasn't racing with 'em
Made it out the maze, haze with the stanky odor
Simmer down my brain when I can't control it
Nigga, where your chips? You should bet 'em on him
Call the vet he barking, hear him and the mess he started
Nigga, they keep a eye on me, I am not a child artist
I raised the bar and hit a chin-up for a while on it
Life a long ride, my niggas up for it
My bitches down for me cause I stay a buck-fifty
Angel City drought time, why the fuck I'm up fifty
Playing like I'm down five? They can't really fuck with me
Let a nigga sizzle in the pan if he wanna
Los Angeles area annual summer, we burning under it
Learned from taking chances and fumbling
Nigga I was taught to take your rations and guzzle 'em, bitch[Produced by RandomBlackDude][Part 1: AM] [Verse 1: Wiki]
Nineteen, still gettin' kicked out the crib
Ripped off my bib, spit out my food, hiccup and piss
Urine burnin', I could smell the liquor in this
Cats always tryna' pick up the fist
"Duff this dude out"
Rappers stoop just to get to your crib
Now it's like bruised face, loose walk, too sauced
Distraught thoughts on my corpse on the asphalt
Back when I’d slack off, rock my slacks of my ass half-off
Every time I rap I blast-off
Back when I catch court I always had sports
Dippin' on cops in my track shorts
So tell my mom I had to make it right
I lie every night about the lime-light so I could lie at night
And tell my pops I gotta' take advice
Keep my head screwed on tight, abuse these mics
See me, I’m the contusion type
A cat to smack the mic
Against my fuckin' head when I'm losing hype
RATKING, never losing hype, no
It's RATKING and I do it right, no
RATKING, yeah, I do it nice, woah

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Bitch, I skated before I rapped
If you take me before your captain
Bet twenty hots on your daddy
That someone could Noila Clap em'
Probably cold and passive
Cause pops was the one that got to me
Feeling down like he passed it
And when I'm cornered, it's action
I was kinda' out the game
Momma put the quarter right back in the slot
In 09', we took the 7 to the Dussy 17 to the block
Bitch, if yo' nigga had Supreme, we was the reason he copped it
And nowadays I'm on the hunt for mirrors to box with
And some pretty bitches that ain't trip if it's a hit and run
I got the gold cause I don't do the crying, bro
She Mario, I'm tryna' keep the whining to a minimum
Piggies come, bet I'm splittin' quicker than I finish rum
Find me some Indica
Nuggets on my fingers and my shirt like they was chicken crumbs
The room spinnin', finna' yak if I don't hit the blunt
Got the chin wagon, slim chances of me getting up
After this
Mind in the trash next to where my fuckin' passion went
Dodge fanatics, half-a-Xanax when I'm traveling six hours or more
Brick out on the tour, got kicked out of the morgue
Spit cattle manure shit, shit, rally the Horsemen
Tally the corpses
 [Part 2: Radio] [Instrumental][Earl]
Uhh, addicts arise, when I arrive
In this cracked crack fag back slab in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side, bitch
Reach for the door, get your access denied

[Tyler]
I'm not an asshole I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screaming "Tyler, stop"
The big bad wolf to me you're just a minor fox
Red riding is getting some of this wolfly odder cock

[Earl]
We the niggas you scared of, like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch, ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit

[Tyler]
Your whole gang will be diminished, Bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenants daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it

[Earl]
Face it, me and Ace's is sick like malaria carriers
[Interlude, previous line repeated]
Jim Carrey her to the cemetery to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard

[Tyler]
Took karate, mommy told me "Tyler toughen up"
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner

[Earl]
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feeding on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops

[Tyler]
Get the certain tingle, eating Haagen Dazs
With some soccer moms where they like to fucking sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel

[Earl]
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend, a snicker dick in a vanilly chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I pre-ordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit

[Tyler]
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a Hummer while I rape her then I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her

[Earl]
Known narcissists, sipping on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barking keep you up like car alarms and shit

[Tyler]
Over the edge, yeah I hide in a potato sack
Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fucking Traq
I'm the type to put you down to bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut

[Earl]
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbing your women friends, like a gentlemen
Then dipping with the fucking pen to go sin again

[Tyler]
White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doing drive by's on a fucking fixie bike
Fuck it moron, snorting oxycontin, wearing cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playing sissy dykes

[Earl]
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Dirty crack pipes lit, bullshit to stop, halt
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open
Sly's little shop of horrors, now showing

[Tyler]
I hate gays, gangbangers and fucking jerkers
Unless it's gay gangbangers that's fucking jerkers
Whoa yo, yo.. no homo, I'm not gay, faggot
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wu-Tang banging in your system
Probably banging in your sister with my children swimming in her system
Let me say this shit in slow-mo, homo
You don't fucking skate, take off that box logo[Verse 1: MF Doom]
Uh, uh, uh
Viktor wild islander, bringing out the child in him
Singing out to silence who are more violent than heil Hitler
He gets some looks, some bullshit, pull over a dusty pull-over and a Pulitzer
A must we must busty your crusty sub-woofer sister
Foes is just bluffing, clear your nose from huff, puffing
A glutton for bludgeoning and blood gushing, here you go stud muffing, it's nothing
Get it on the get by, bet it on the dead guy, jet it on the red eye
Too many make mistake fillers, not enough live wires, too many fake killers and jive sires
Drop these bombs on a critic from a grass knoll, everybody got one, your mom's is an asshole
SOB and smug to the utmost, cut it close and catch a slug to the gut, boast: word to Thutmose
Whats worse? Clutch a purse close lady, we get more cheese bread for the baby, toast to Grady, 180

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm in the cut looking for some puss to pick apart
Dirty, like us riding in a whip that really isn't ours
Storming out the door, don't press record I hate my fucking voice
Trying to kill that noise, performing fill that void, slightly
I'm swimming in water that's been dicey since landing
And I'm owing these niggas nothing
Like all I've been handing for free
Don't pan your cameras to me, ho don't command me to speak
I got these little niggas swinging from the banners
Throwing facts in his pijamas
Walking slow because the cameras keep his stamina weak
And you can catch him like some halibut after a bad accident
Trying to get jaw jacked right where the captain had pieced
Out, Villain, Earl, Captain they commanding your street now
Rapping good as mother fucking janitors sweep now
Get the business handled, get the cannabis cheap now
It's a bunch of nuggets on him like sand on a beach towel

[Verse 3: Captain Murphy]
Captain's back (yay)
[?] put the mic away (where?)
Beside a microwave (oh)
When I die I bet you might go wave
He blowing bubbles at the pearly gates
Took a stuffy with the king but only seen my face
I'm writing darker pieces in my thesis
I'm hiding in the park with all your nieces
Trading head for Resse's pieces[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
First off, I'm a start charging y'all per compliment
You give to me, see how much purse I can earn off of it
As far as bars, you heard wrong if you heard continent
It's incontinence, inconsequent turned sponsorin'
Rockin' a fur smock with some RC and
Go from rockin' a beat to just curb stomping it
Serve consonants hotter than hot combs (coals)
And surfing through brown (perm)anent germs that will jump off of it
Hot dogging with no condiments
Flow proper this show stopper be Bogarting it
Other niggas be going hard, and Early be going artisan
And lick fo' shot of the focus, more talkative
Too talkative, let the robbers in

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Off a couple Sake shots
Watching pot grow in short shorts and some soggy crocs
Shoddy lot of black faces trading body shots
For all of the belongings in your pocket, park it
Hardly not, gnarly tots, nollie pops
Use a bit, it got me; then she buzzin' like a walkie talk
Staying gold like the only watch that Lonny rocks
Grimey socks and you know you don't wanna play with papa swamp

[Verse 3: Captain Murphy]
So unorthodox
Chillin' with a shaman, eating ramen in a parking lot
I brought a bag of dreams with me, breathe the kundalini in
Exhale the meaning and the feeling of Elysium
Even the reason leavin' 'em lost, lyrical boss, harder than most
So kill me, martyrs at most my Holy ghost
Host a party in 'em, I brought my unruly souven-
Here on her blouse like a "Yours Truly" steel pin
Ether (Ha ha ha); they can't get past the deep voice
Conceived in a Rolls Royce, abortion life, pro choice
Goth hop, put a beanie on pitch bent like a leanin' song
Learn to fly and high at the first sign that I'm dreamin' on
The Force is strong with this one though
Over 9,000 midi-chlorians say so
Really show no mercy, all master, no Percy
Show these little bastards in the journeys of my troubled mind
Saddled by your blasphemy, look at what you found inside
Now you can't imagine me, running high the casualty and fucking die
This is why we had to bring the guns out
Rattled neighbors' windows every night until the sun's out
Two dudes, two odd crews with strange leaders
Kitty cats, a couple blunts, my new wang feeder[Verse 1: Viktor Vaughn]
Vik, the wild islander, bringing out the child in ya
Singing out the silencer with more violence than "Heil Hitler"
He get some looks, some bullshit roll-over, a dusty pullover and a Pulitzer
A must we bust your crusty subwoofer system
Foes is just bluffin', clear your nose from huff-puffin'
A glutton for bludgeoning blood gushin', here you go, stud muffin
It’s nothin', get it on the get-by
Bet it on a dead guy, jet it on the red eye
Too many make mistake fillers, not enough live wires
Too many fake killers, and jive sires
Dropped these bombs on a critic from a grass knoll
Everybody got one, your mom's is a asshole
S.O.B. and smug to the utmost
Cut it close and catch a slug to the gut Mos, word to Thutmose
What's worse, clutch your purse close, lady
We get more cheese bread for the baby, toast to Grady, one-eighty

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm in the cut looking for some puss to pick apart
Dirty like us riding in the whip that really isn't ours
Storming out the door, don't press record, I hate my fucking voice
Trying to kill that noise, performing fill that void slightly
I'm swimming in water that's been dicy
Since landing
And I'm owing these niggas nothing like all that I've been handed
For free
Don't pan your cameras to me
Ho, don't command me to speak
Got these little niggas swinging from the banister, on fax in his pajamas walking slow because the camels keep his stamina weak
And you could catch him like some halibut after a bad accident
Trying to get jaw-jacked right where the catheter peeks out
Villain, Earl, and Captain in command of your street now
Rapping good as motherfucking janitors sweep now
Getting business handled, get the cannabis cheap now
It's a bunch of nuggets on him like it's sand on a beach towel

[Verse 3: Captain Murphy]
Captain's back (Yay!)
So go on put your mic away
(Where?) Inside a microwave (Oh)
When I die, I bet you Mike'll wave (hee-hee)
We blowing bubbles at the pearly gates
Took a selfie with the king but only see my face
I’m writing darker pieces in my thesis
I’m hiding in the park with all your nieces trading head for Reese's Pieces
Interject in niggas' verses with this book of witches' curses
I cast a spell upon your bitches, but my thirst is for the hearses
I’m spilling out my innards to these n-words, journey inwards
Caught her quarter past the moment, got a cord of past opponents
In a fragment of a moment, man I killed that rap then owned it
Hope to overtake the planet, with my banana in a hammock
Bitch manic parents panic, I’m a mechanic with these patterns
Propagandic with that chatter, matter of fact the Madder Hatter
Never mind the hammer, manners out the window
Pump crescendo, puff the endo, I’m Lou Ferrigno, just pretendo
Don’t ask him where the pen go cause the pencil got me paper paid
And paydirt made them paint her
With the mask and faded sweatshirt, nothing lesser
Bet you’ll never ever guess what I left under the dresser
Hid a message in the 808 to pester all the Heshers[Produced by Sweaty Fisherman]

Verse 1: Delusional [Thomas]
And he's still so delusional, stooping low as burials at funerals
Fuck the fame, dropped an album, dipped with the recoupables
My hoodie up, hide my face, cause I ain't good enough
My bitch stay my bitch, so don't look, she keep that pussy tucked
Now things are looking up, recommend the mescaline
Digest in your intestines with intentions of ascension up
Heavens no, my head is hot cause hell is cold
The bitch I'm smashing into fashion, but I know the devil wear a leopard coat
Back when Johnny Carson was dicking down Dolly Parton
Bang your pardon this my third life, I'm parking on the turnpikes
Searching for the circus lights, these demons never worked for Christ
Ain't fucking with no churches, we was all about that murder life
Samurai, murk you like you sure I'm nice
Syrup turn to purple Sprite, confirm the shit that we already know
Sick of politicking, as they talking, trying not to listen

[Hook]
I'm a real young goon, real young goon x3
I'm a real young goon

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
It's the blackest piece of trash they done seen in a RV park
So holla at your guala if ever you feel your weed sparse, nigga
Salty to tee off with us, just know that T brought villain
My nigga we all itching to see you dropped
And I don't wanna chop it up, I never front like I'm the nicest
Fame fazed him not the slightest, aim stainless at your iris
Take paper out your pocket, just as sure as Toyo tires round
That fucking little schisty clown is back in full effect
Little teeny tiny Sweat, he biting bitches by the neck
Got my fucking dick as long as lists of shit I should regret
I'm just a little bit depressed that's why the winter fit him best
I guess I'm biased to the cold, I mix the Ritalin and sess
Because I like the highs and lows and I also like the checks
That I'm siphoning from shows, bitch and triple six the set
(Six-six-six the set) run it back, tight as Corey Duffel pants
Doing niggas dirty as the motherfucking plunging cap
My main and my ex screaming like it's a habit
I move immune in between 'em because I'm diplomatic
Catch me in your city passive, cleaning up my shitty act
And bitches say them gritty raps be making up for shit he lacking
Sixes and them kitty cats, that got him missing Jerry's Thomas
Burpin' words that's hotter than the pocket where he carry chronic
Very awesome so spare the comments, I'm bi-coastal
Paid and chugging forties you niggas can keep your wine toasted
Noon high, no moving in that fine dutty wine motion
Loaded, tell a cop to suck a dick with my fly open, nigga

I got candy for niggas
I got panties for niggas
What's good? Uh, yeah
Holla at me
2013 shit, y'gnaw'mean?
Bought a nigga a purse, I don't give a fuck
What? Bitch
Yeah, uh, bitch

[Verse 3: Bill]
Look, fuck these writtens, I don't watch 106 and Park
I skate through the park in my 106's
Smoke blunts in the dark with some porno bitches
You just see the spark in the blunts like I'm porno flicking
Got the hormones tripping, I'm more so dripping
Daily Bread's tatted on the chest of my torso
And it's never gonna fade unlike my eyes
So I go trip like Psilocybin, eyes wider than Ohio
I'm going global, what you ain't a local?
Going postal if you think we won't go through what you own, dude
Watch the throne motherfucker, cause we molded you
Older school Most Dope soldier I got the pro with tools
Me and Clockwork get it in like we're supposed to
Just don't act like you know us when you see us getting over views
You're older news, I choose to move over you
I watch like a boulder, now I'm colder than a frozen you
You don't know where we're going so just hold the news
I never got over fake rappers and the overview
I'm not a rapper, I'm just scolding you
So go home, we folded you, like wallets, I'm just holding you

[Outro]
You can't see me, when I'm rolling
I got that weed nigga, so I'm swerving
Niggas know me in the hood
Niggas call me Tina Turner
Roll a blunt and get turnt up
Nigga we burnin, bitch niggaSweatshirt, Domo Genesis, throwin' chairs, killin' shit
I'm half-privileged, think white and have nigger lips
A tad different, mad smart, act ignorant
Shit, I'll pass the class when my dad starts givin' shits
But as long as our relationship is turdless
I'ma keep burning rubber and fucking these beats with burnt dick
Who that, oh, that new coon John Cusack
A Mecca button-up, shoutin' bring Fubu back
Hands full of coke, mouth full of crack mu-zack
Odd Future on the doo-rag, guess who's back
With no hint, we're egging with no tint
Plus it's a shotgun under the seat where your ho sits, uh
The Night Striker, I'm riding her, up-tying her
It's nine Vicodins stuck inside of the windpipes of her
A little bit of sherm sure provokes the fuckin' fight in her
She started bitin' cause I'm givin' cock like it's advice to her
Take that, I'm on top like wave caps
This is grade-A rap, Domo bring that bass back, nigga(Intro)
I'll fuck you up, bitch

Uh, yeah, this is stadium rap
Hotter than the last name on my alias Jack Rip
Bad bitch flip our gymnasiums back
Track itch shit's dope, y'all should slang it in sacks
Shit's sellin for ten, harder than elephant skin
Benevolent grin, I stay gold, you settle for tin
Wolf Gang, wolf pack, packin' weapons in tens
So take a wild guess as to why they lettin' us in
Please, Earl lettin' the competitor win
Is the equivalent of steppin' with stilettos in gyms
It's not happenin', so while I'm standin' checkin' your chin
Know the flow takes the "h" out of "shins," fin[Intro: Vince Staples]
"What's up, nigga? Why you so depressed and sad all the time like a little bitch? What's the problem, man? Niggas want to hear you rap. Don't nobody care about how you feel, we want raps, nigga."

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
My grandma's passing
But I'm too busy tryna get this fuckin' album cracking to see her
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen (Cut that bitch off)
And my priorities fucked up, I know it, I'm afraid I'm going to blow it
And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?
Talk all you want, I'm taking no advice, nigga
I'm 'bout to relish in this anguish, and I'm stressing over payment
So don't tell me that I made it, only relatively famous
In the midst of a tornado, misfitted, I'm Clark Gable
I'm not stable, abrasive as fuck and they all
Pay me, I'm chuckling cross-faded in public
Heart racing 'til blunt is lit like, "He don't give a fuck again, right?"

[Interlude: Earl Sweatshirt]
"Hey Thebe, nigga, what's up nigga? I heard you back, I need them raps, nigga. I need the verse, I don't care about what you going through or what you gotta do nigga, I need bars, sixteen of 'em."

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit
Judging by the pants and the mall grip
Gully, in the vans with the dark tints
I'm a start-shit type nigga
Night life living
Riding in the Jeep, I'mma side-swipe niggas
What's your life like? That's alright nigga
Hammer in the left ready when the price isn't
Right got the whip and I ain't got the license for it
And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it
The nicest doin' it, who the fuck you staring at?
Acting like you've never seen a tooth that's carat-capped
Bars hotter than the blocks where we be at
Stuntin' these niggas gon' flop like Divac
See that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga, believe that nigga
You see that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga, believe that, niggaThe rap collective you’re a member of, Odd Future, became famous very rapidly after you were sent by your mother to a school for troubled youth in Samoa. Did missing out on that success further your resolve to sort through the behavior issues that got you there?

Hell, no. Not initially, and not the way that Odd Future was coming out — it was like a temper tantrum. It was perfect. But throwing a temper tantrum in a residential treatment facility is so much less cool than throwing a temper tantrum on TV.

While you were in Samoa, your whereabouts were pieced together by fans and bloggers. Did it make you worry about how much information is available online?

One day I hope to not have a Twitter, to be sick enough that I don’t have to use the Internet. But since we came up online, I have to be online. Twitter is a real addiction, like the color of it, the process of it.

[...]

You were just in Toronto. How was that?

It was crazy. Canadians are weirdos, though. They are so nice — overbearing nice, like grandmother nice. Toronto is like a city of grandmas.

The rapper Drake is from Toronto. Is he grandma nice?

Dude, Drake is grandma nice. He was at Frank Ocean’s show in L.A. and got into an argument with Tyler, the Creator’s mom. I left and came back in the room, and she was apologizing to him for how she came at him, and he was saying: “It’s all love. I love you, Mom. I love moms.” Drake loves moms.

Your mother is a law professor at U.C.L.A. Does she ever pressure you to go to law school or anything?

No. My mom’s down for what I’m doing now that she knows I’m not unraveling. When she sent me to Samoa, it wasn’t like, “No rap music!,” you know what I mean? I didn’t get thrown in the cellar for swearing.

Rick Ross was dropped from Reebok because of a lyric about date rape on “U.O.E.N.O.” Odd Future’s music often crosses similar lines.

Rick Ross! If he was everything that he rapped about, he’d be the worst coke-dealing mass murderer ever. People got mad because he said something bad on a cool song. That was ridiculous on Reebok’s part. You picked up Rick Ross, he’s cocaine — that’s what his entire career is.

[...]

Your parents gave you the middle name Neruda after Pablo Neruda. You can see why people are curious.

Yeah, it just happens to be that people like to associate poetry and rap music. I think that idea is kind of corny. I think rap music is rap music. I mean, are there heavy writing aspects of it? Absolutely. In a sense is it poetry? Yeah. I’ve heard that so much, growing up in a house with poetry. But I think people like to use that as a shortcut for who’s good and who’s not. It’s like the word “lyrical” — “lyrical” is the worst word in the entire world.

So it’s not a shocking concept that rap could be poetry.

It’s actually so familiar that it’s annoying.[Intro]

[Earl Sweatshirt]
"Yeah... me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just tryna say somethin' before... I... I... drop it off."

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
I feel like the Tom Sawyer for real niggas
Looking for a problem, revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed, we will kill niggas
So try me if you want, bruh, I promise I'm with all of that
Late night shooters, got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white man game with my heart intact
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
North north is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait
Until the money coming in, spend it all on guns and rims
I ain't nothing but a nigga, ain't no reason to pretend

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Kept his sticky in a Stussy pouch
Ski mask, bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty, night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles, sold sniff, Momma knew
Baggies laying 'round, peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns, welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at two, plotting, trying to garner loot
Split it with his big road dog, call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch, stiff collar on the button-up
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout to run amok
Road to Hell paved with cement, covered trussled drugs, toughen up

[Hook]
"Well, alright, okay. If that's how you truly feel about it, then
Alright, okay. If that's how you truly feel about it, then."

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
Vinny Stape, they stupid, think the city safe
Until that little bindi placed, headshots, red dot
Block as hot as Denny plates, fed watch, Fed watch
Opinions only pity based, deep in the Civic with the
Evilest niggas this side of the Mississippi
All courtesy of Vincent from niggas who plot against
Ear-L-double-S, hear shells from the Tec
Hear in full-effect, eat a dick and cut a check, bitch
Few niggas I'm on a first-name basis with
Address him by the alias, that trunk weighted like he
'Bout to catch a case again, eighths louder than the voice of
Satan that be plaguing him, bruh, I'm caking
Whether Hell or bad weather, high water, I'm a sailor-type
Assailant for the paper, living like I met the maker twice
Hit it 'til I'm faded right? Mami, take a hike
Or treat it like you fucking shaking dice, bitch

[Hook 2x][Verse 1: Earl]
We come through mopping, like janitors
Smoking kush nuggets the size of fucking tarantulas
Blow got me amped as fuck, ho niggas backing up
And that nigga Short tell that nigga Jasper swag me up
Swag me up, swag is us, who can tell me how the fuck
Our number one fans is faggots that used to laugh at us
Tell me who's as rad as us and the answer was
"Um, y'all dope, Wolf Gang just the damper dust"
Yeah the dapper dogs take your head chop it off
No father, fuck being proper bitch, we're popping off
And to top it off I'm dropping monster monologues
That's hot enough to piss your local arson off
That's me spitting this fucking garbage toss
As you niggas, niggas get familiar with the art of loss
Switch swag on you little dick fags
You fucking dead bitch chips, I'm on my fifth bag with your bitch ass

[Hook]
She call me crazy, they call me crazy
They call me shady but it's a chordaroy life
I'm living baby, I'm living baby
I'm living baby, it's a chordaroy life
And you call me shady, call me crazy
Call me lazy, I ain't your baby
It's a chordaroy life that I'm living hazy
It's a chordaroy life that I'm living phase me

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
People love Hodgy I hate you though
I don't precipitate bitch, I H2O
And I move across your membrane, you loose against my insane
Thoughts, cause you're an outsider tryna get in brain
I like girls but I don't fuck with tramps
I'm elephant tusking and they succulents
I'm shaving off my boot hairs deciduosly
Break jaws Mr. Vigora, rigorously
I'm hot breeze, snot sneeze
I cop weed for less of a percentage than I fucking plot seeds
New racist, too vacant, mutations, natural selection
Bitch I got my swag card, natural protection
Pocket with a cash full of bashful weapons
I brandish and I flash tools and I have fools stepping
I'm a geophyte, move under the ground til I can see the light
Feed niggas shells like my motherfucking beach is nice

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyler]
When I say "Wolf Gang", you say "Fuck that"
Room full of wolves, inhalers and used blunt wraps
Fingers in the middle of bitches bodacious buttcracks
Enough fucking atheist rappers to get a nun slapped
This is fuck music here, let a couple sluts use it
Show their boobs, and I'll hop out the booth when I'm done pooping
Grab a couple (gats), stuff 'em in the backpack
Then take them to school for show and tell day screaming "Fuck students"
Backing up a bunch of fatherless kids and a pack of dust
Could fucking splat and show you the fucking Iraq in us
A bunch of fucking wolves and rats having niggers the size of Shaq
Backing up, like juvenile biggest fan was a moving truck
Killing these niggas off quick
Don't believe me? Then watch me empty out a full clip
Trigger being pulled, niggers in a ditch
That wasn't bullets, that was copies of Bastard, you bitch

[Hook][Hook]
Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

[Verse 1]
It's probably been twelve years since my father left, left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly I miss this nigga, like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened, it's evident
And them eyes where he hiding all them icicles at

[Hook]

[Interlude]
"Can I get that, oh... let me get that beat in my headphones, louder."

[Verse 2]
Uh... time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome, trying to make it from the bottom of Syd's
Feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, "I like attention"
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right? Like, "Thanks so much, you made my life
Harder, and the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit"
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

[Hook][Verse 1: Remy Banks]
Swerving in a hoopty, but a nigga not drunk
I'm high off of life, with a pinch of skunk
Maybe high off of determination, but I'm low on luck
Because we've been putting on for years, and people still be counting sheep on us
But its cool, I be that offspring dressed in all wolf clothing
With a mallet and a bell, just awaiting a rude awakening
Out here yellin Worlds Fair until the name ring
Hailing from a place where every nigga wanna be king
Plus this world is too cold, so I keep myself circle small
Puffing chronic with my dogs, chilly, but we holding down the city
And my burrow, feelin unstoppable like Tetsuo
Akira in the membrane Queens get the money
Yet I'm broke and going insane, stressed out my brain
Til it left on a train to Connecticut for the weekend
Might extended stay until I'm diving in the deep end
Of a pool full of euros, pounds, and yen, let's get this money, man

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
L said it's cold in this world, sometimes it's hard for me to crack a smile
That real shit is going out of style
These young niggas out here acting buck wild
We just need that real shit right now
L said it's cold in this world, somehow it's hard for me to crack a smile
That real shit is going out of style
These young niggas out here acting buck wild
They just need that real shit right now

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
For what it's worth, a nigga made his way from the dirt
All the times I went berserk, all ideas that didn't work
But we cherish when we hurt, we finished dinner and dessert
For every thought that hurt for the piece that I deserve I'm on the search
Many times a nigga felt that he would give in
Every dream that I would witness with previous premonitions
I knew that I would be this
It's never been a secret took a genius to believe it or an elitist to achieve it
I'm runnin overheated, but practice what I'm preachin
Never sleep and we catch you slippin and throw you in the deep end
I know some niggas died over pride, high
I know some fake niggas claim they ride, that's a lie
I know some hating niggas that when I rhyme, they despise
Wish I could share these visions through eyes
High like a fucking revolutionary
I'm droppin knowledge, and its only knowledge you should carry
Bitch, I'm the truth and everybody know the truth is scary

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
Looking for shit to scratch up off this bucket list
Found a tug of war between my mother and my fucking friends
Fucking bucket, bumping nothing in the summer
Trying to chug a fifth of Jack in case you wondering where the ruckus went
I kept in the baggie of Oregano
Fronting like I'm selling dope, stunting with my effort low
Let the records show these niggas why they bitches neck is swole
It's OFM to the death of us, pigs, try to hem us up
The best wrestler's back guzzling seconds up
Using label checks to fuck around in the Cressida
And I'm advocating aggression
To any man who would test us, an avid fan of the presence of vodka
This drink is like my first time hearing Flocka
Hope is what the weed can't offer
Cheap ass, coughing, C-class method actor, young nigga
Dressing like I'm geriatric, said it's very active
Strong arm, steady swearing I could tear a mattress
Track-slapping 'em silly as Tom and Jerry tactics
Why you started? I fire harder than every rapper
Gassing these fairies, dare I say that he carry matches?

[Interlude: Hodgy Beats]
Hey, you think it’s a god damn joke, don’t you?
Well, let me tell you something boy!
It’s life around here, and in life, you’re gonna have to go to school…
[inaudible]

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Hodgy Beats]
No confusion apparent, I know who I am
Responsibility enables me to move through life with agility
Home donors, pressure in the endzone, but I breeze by skillfully
Practice makes perfect said the wise man, or so his whole life span
They said a man was part of the sea
By hand, what? could he divide land?
Coast West like a took a Vyvanse, I'm just a bystander
And what you capture in my stanzas is a crossbreed
OG and banana
A jealous man I envy, cause a jealous man is friendly
Award him like a Grammy, or rather Emmy
Television all science, and music is just enough to ear a Q-tip
Where the proof sits that smells like bull shits
Ain't it a shame when a nigga can't be honest?
And it's whats-her-name that can't keep a promise
Mind is with my Comcast
Watching what I do before it's on them dot-coms and hastags, nigga[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
It's the pick of the litter
Mobbin' deep in the woods with six other niggers
Yellin' at the trees like hey, hi mister
I'm Life Litter's official stripe getter
Dig this, I'll get a shovel and strike sisters
And kick them when the handle starts diggin' in my blisters
Sick, cynical, cyanide spitter
So when I kick rhymes, my victims die quicker
I'm broke, no cheese, my ho's cracker
Snort third verse of Pigions, I'll show you a dope rapper
I'll shit on a nigga with no bladder
Then throw it in his eyes to show him he don't matter
The night creeper in a nice white Jeep
Here with three white divas who snort and like penis
I'm hotter than at least five heaters
In the middle of the summer with a sleeved wife beater
Pure bred degenerate, gentleman
Little Aryan nigga with hairy clit for dinner
It's Wolf Gang, triple six, niggas on that simple shit
I'm on a fuckin' spree burnin' bodies in a rental whip
Wolf Gang rad, no bum ass shit
So since the fans laggin', now they're tryna come back quick
Ask from Dera to Fax, they say fuck that shit
We half African swaggin' of course we run that shit

[Verse 2: Mike G]
I been sick, since I was un-mixed and mastered
Blastin' Bastard, screamin' fuck another rapper
O.F. soldier, Buffalo Bill, don't think I will
But I'm a gunner for the Bills like Tasker
I'm the cream of the crop
Officers in the trunk with six other cops
No way that I'll stop, they'll arrest me after
Fix the scene just to put me on screen like an actor
Shit, no need to tell me I know it's hot
As weather where them bitches wear bikinis with polka-dots
It's overly overkill, because my niggas know a lot
About tapin' them, rapin' them, throw them overboard from a yacht
So now they probably hate me but that's why the fuck I'm here
And you really should man up, there's no need to be sincere, faggot
Heard that you we're queer, why would you fuck with Wolves
That'll leave you on the ground like your rap career?
So you don't want it don't start none
We're fuckin' Radical, been Fuckin' Awesome
Talked a lotta shit so for words you're at a loss
Raised enough money just to get someone to kill my boss
Now that's a fuckin' suit for hire
Hang her higher, light a fire, fuck my former supervisor
I'm the truth, you're a liar, blue as clues, I inspire
Odd Future muthafucka, I'm your new supplier[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I meditate before I elevate, cough, medicate
Sedate, date which I escalate, heaven gates
No hesitation, Wolf revelation
Gang education, Freddy Jason, what it might seem
We shake and bake the cake, poison frozen icing
Fuck 'em all, ice cream, black magic, white dreams
Blue collar, purple tag label
You holla, don't bother me, you sitting at the fag table
My state is euphoric, and my pride is true courage
I reach for the stars, Fantastic Four it
Wealthy in my future, but I can't afford rich
Presidential suite, sound proof, door glitched
Terrorists landed, bet it gets handed on Christmas
You get caca if you on Santa's shit list
Receive a gun, raise your O.F. hitlist
Tongue lick of death, wish like a frozen big stick, nigga

[Hook]
Follow everywhere I go cause
I'm from Odd Future Wolf Gang, um
Follow everywhere I go cause
I'm from Odd Future Wolf Gang, they
Follow everywhere we go
We are Odd Future Wolf Gang
Say OFWG, say OFWG, say OFWG, OFWG
Say OF, say OF, say OF, Odd Future Wolf Gang

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
Mind hype, Like I'm white, with attention deficit
Blind mice, I'm life, spaz, make the best of it
Retard syndrome, purge and bend some
My crew isn't sailing, I'mma fucking rip some
Bio, sucking lipo from the fat bitches and dope beats
Golden grills, Caddy DeVille, suffocating, choke streets
Sub woof, drug kush, trunk hella steezy
I'm like the sauce between the bread and the fucking cheesy
Squeeze me, squeeze me, like a squeegee
Niggas like to bordercross, half pipe, fijis
Believe me, I'm cool like the motherfucking breezy
Heart cold, dick freezing, never shrivel up
Bars loose, pit drivels up, music riddles us
Like women nipple jugs, full grown werewolf
No yorkie, eat beef, chicken, no porky
In front of the class, eyeglass nerd dorky

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Earl]
Got these faggots shouting revolution, I am Earl, that shit's ruthless
In the booth, there's no spoofing, bitch I spit like I'm toothless
Fool, OF crew, fool y'all fruits and 'em
Lying like fuck truth, dropping shit like polution
Dirty like a bum's unwiped ass now
I'm transitioning from class clown to cash cow
Indeed, I got steez to pass out
Believe I'm dope, a fucking breathing crack house
She diseased on her knees, with ass out
Ace got on ski mask, she gon' need knee pads
Supreme 5 panels and green hats
Y'all don't come close like Winehouse and Rehab
Going back, no, the crafty assholes plateau
Got the game in a motherfucking lasso
Ride that ho, cruising in the music with the attitude
Of tool kits, make 'em respect my two cents
Could really give two shits, let alone a dollar
My flows make bros go whoa, your mother says holler
Wack niggas say nada, OF the best, no synonym
Still my pockets slim like the Olsen twins, it's on
Off I piss 'em and dismissing 'em quick and my sentences
Stay Oliver Twisting like Charles Dickens death
Wishing competition, but listen, the plot thickens
I'm a stand up nigga, well fuck it, I'm not sitting

[Hook][Verse 1: Earl]
Uh, was always smartmouthed and quick-witted
But somethin' was always missin' like six digits
Lucky seven probably poppa
Little nigga so they picked on him, hassled him
Things changed when I hassled back, so
David hit the pavement with this grapple rap
Snapple fact: you rather wack
While I am poppin' like a snappin' crack
So high you could see like Tallahass, the opposite of cataracts
Matter fact I am Farmer John milkin' cattle tracks
Action packed nipple squeezin', boy colder than sniffle season
Simple genius, go hard and spit bits of semen
So when the street is split, don't act surprised, agree with it
The Gang of Wolves that creeps in crypts
As deep as Dawson's Creek and shit
I pray they got gills either that or grab some floaties
I know I got skills, why you think I'm posted boastin'
Braggin' tell these faggots to stop naggin'
Cause them Wolf Gang niggas threw them off the bandwagon like

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Uh, was always fucked up as shit with it
But I didn't cross the line until the bridge hit it, troll
I got you niggas nervous like virgins flirtin' with Uncle Mervin
Fuckin' y'all with no lubricant, go grab the detergent
I preach to demons at your church, now I'm the newest sermon
Wearin' nothin' but they fuckin' blast with the matchin' turban
I drive through white suburbans in the black Suburban swervin'
Hittin' curbs and blastin' Erick Sermon drunk off English Bourbon
I'm stealin' purses rapin' nurses I'm a crooked surgeon
And treat the beat like sanitized nazi pussies, I'm a German
I'm squirtin' while I'm masturbatin' and regurgitatin'
From eatin' Miley Cyrus salad pussy platter they were servin'
My only purpose is to jerk it cause it has a curve
So bitches hate to do me like it's convict community service
This my Zombie Circus, you better get a fuckin' ticket
Odd Future Wolf Gang like they're filmin' Twilight in this bitch

[Verse 3: Earl]
I'm back on my sixty six sick shit
Flowin' like the blood out the competition's slit wrists
She lick it up, Dracula, then spit it back, back at ya
She mad as fuck, stuck in the back of a black Acura
Fed her acid now the duct tape quacks back at her
Hello Heather yellow feathers now you ain't laughin', huh

[Verse 4: Tyler]
Bitch you're barely breathin' leavin' on the back of the boat
While I fill you up with semen from the Wolf Gang team and
Flowin' like the creampie inside of your daughter
Oughta eat the bitch with salt and wash it down with a gallon of water
I grab the saw and sawed off her arm and auctioned it
And dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
Fuckin' awesome spittin' box of trees, got you niggas
Shakin' like it's Parkinsons from the clitoris of Kelly Clarkson's dick
Ironin' you niggas now it's time to starch the shit
Drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
Find a random abandoned garage and go to park in it
Find Earl laying on the burgundy carpet, pull my knife out, sharpen it
Stab him, put a arch on it, pour unleaded gas on him
Get the Zippo and spark the shit
Hop back in the van and then depart the bitch
Killed him on his own track, the faggot shouldn't have started it
