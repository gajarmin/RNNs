[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Wanna sit beside a sick and seductive sinner, see
Something so sinister seeking sookie somethin like a centipede
Slitherin', she's searchin' for synergy
Suckin' my seed, chakra tease stickin sippin' Hennessy, shittin'
On the hissin' I'll spit you out of commission
Position the bitch and dip in when I mention slip in submission
My operation is drippin' to the bottom, shakin' and strippin'
Odd when I bust, K.O.D. put em in Necropolis
Givin' this rod to the good broads, and they givin' they bras to us
With the gift to break up a couple that's monogamous
Stop with the probs and take off your effin' draws, bitch and rock with us
Been gitty cause them titties, are on my chin-chinny
Chin, did he pretend he was again kiddie
Suckin' the crème de la crème and the skin pretty
Dim lit he, then hitting thee trim in Sin City
Let it in, I'm the medicine, get her wetter than ever been
Never better than a veteran, level that in the bed again
Rockin' red I been in my letterman, bright as Edison
Like I said I sin, head I win at events and I’m fetishin'
Open up, you hoes, you know what's up
Told you when I bust, her clothes they wanna just
Go right off her butt, for sure they wanna cut
Explode, drop a load, cause the flow, is

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
So dope they wanna (Fuck)
So dope they wanna (Suck)
So dope they wanna (Give it all up and really abrupt)
So dope they wanna (Fuck)
So dope they wanna (Suck)
So dope they wanna (Give it all up and really abrupt)
So dope they wanna (Fuck)
So heroin, so cocaine, so ketamine, promethazine, so X (So wet)
So thorazine, so morphine, so dope that they wanna have sex

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
She said "I heard that you was packin' I'mma fan of your rapping
I'm feining action where you really from, Cape Town?"
I said "Yeah, bitch and I was born in London
So I'm thinkin' 'bout fuckin' you with the crumpets and some cake now!"
How did we get so stereotypical?
Fairly so seminal, now I'm flowin' to the pinnacle
I see you got some friends who just lookin' to get it from the medic
So I'mma 'bout to pivot on 'em and I make rounds
Want a piece of the beast from the East?
Complete, in the sheets, release beats, got her man down
Your boy just never could compete with us, please, better believe
We skeet, now wipe yourself off with a Sham Wow!
Me and Nina run deeper than receivers, I beat up all on her beaver
Now she wanna feed the meter!
Speakers bumpin' tweeters from here up into Medina leave us pleasin'
Are your nieces screamin' "Take Me to Your Leader"?
I'm trainspottin' the vein rockin' the lane off and came droppin'
Serious game all on your brain, rottin'!
Pick a million pricks and I'm pretty sure that you missed the one
That hits you on the clit, quick drip! Probably the main option
Blowin' the slut up just for good luck and I'm fuckin' the kitty up
With the angel dust in my nuts
Trophy lovin'  cup and my dopin' is such a must
That it's troublesome to give up when they lust
So dope they wanna

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
Loving to give it up in it in the back of the room and make 'em screamin'
Go up in it deep as she was feindin’ when she saw my weiner
She told me she ready for anything, I’m talkin' anything
I stuck it up in her jaws, I’m breakin' walls, like I was Katrina
Don’t even know me, but she know my flow is O.G
She told me she like to play with the pussy when she get lonely
Homie if I was only right there instead of a sony
You claimin' the pussy wet, but dont tell me baby, just show me
She ask if I’m comin' up with the mask in my entrance
Sinner in a second real spitter like every sentence
She was there for repentance, ever since i was an infant
I’m damagin' the vagina, remind you I’m filled with vengeance
Hit em whenever they wanna run up
And they doing it ‘cause i rap and shit
I really don’t care, whatever it takes, to get 'em up on the mattress
I could have been the one that’s on the run for busting a gun but this is way more fun to get up in these motherfucking actresses
In bikinis and suckin' on my zucchini
She told me she wanna be me while sippin' Apple Martinis
Fuck it if I'm a meanie she probably would never leave me
Shit I can play eenie meanie from sly and cuff on my weenie
And now I see 'em on every record and stage
They posted up in the audience, all of 'em filled with hope
Knowin' they only wanna be in the presence
Or get affiliated with you because you was dope

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Snow Tha Product]
Hey now Tech, you know I've been the type
To not go all in on I'm hoes I've been around
But the flow I spit gets hoes all in the zone
That I won’t talk shit but oh my damn they wrong
And these men calling in they're wondering if I’m a get with a little dick
They got no common sense and with no collagen
Their position is probably something insignificant
If you think I’m a bitch ‘cause I probably missed the game you kickin'
They be hollering hope I acknowledging
Because I have been methodically dropping the common knowledge
That I don’t get down like that
Now they be hounding a bitch or probably get with a trick
Or a treat cause they dogs and they all gon' bark like that
I’m killing the game, killing the game, killing the game
So he feeling me, he want to bang I want to wait
So he get at me he want to say shit that make
Me think that he gone rape me If I don’t stay
Cause I got that sickening style, that built me a crowd
And men and women feelin' me now and it's freaking me out
Cause I’m just here to figure it out and what this is about
But I’mma say it’s getting so wild that it’s tripping me out
Cause I’m like here to kill the morale just kill all these sounds
But lately when I spit to a crowd, these men just reach out
And they tell me that they women is down, they gettin' aroused
And they be tryin' to give me they child, with a Gin and a smile
They say they wanna (Fuck)[Verse 1]
Yo, look, I woke up with my attitude, Kanye
I don't give a fuck what my mom say
Okay, maybe a little bit, but only cause I'm really not tryna start up any beef with my madre
But in my mind, today I'm Beyoncé
I don't wanna hear whatever y'all say
I'm a beast, give me monster, no latte
Wearin' all black, like I'm robbin' you in broad day
I had one too many bad nights
Today I don't wanna hear no advice
So all of you little bitches, act nice
I don't wanna fuckin' have to ask twice
Bitch, any other day but not hoy
You can even hear the tone of my voice
Today my grind is pumped up on 'roids
Today my ego's gassed up, like Floyd
Look, I...

[Hook]
Swear to God, the life I live, has got my mom, like, ay, ay, ay
All my bro's, that sellin' O's, that kush, that dro, that white
What you want? Them bars, Patron, that got you on that, ay, ay, ay
Tryna roll, you lose control, we on that level, don't try, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay [x8]

[Verse 2]
Yo, look, my mama kicked me out, cause I was partyin' like YOLO
Woke me up for church, I was hungover, she's like, "oh, no"
Gave my ass a bucket, trapeador, and got the Cloro
Pitbull jacked my mom, since I was a baby she yellin ‘Como!?’
She like: Como que no? Ponte a trapear
Todo lo que compro te doi, ponte a limpiar
Pantalones rotos y ya ponte a lavar
Aqui no tienes voto, carnal, ponteme el par
Aqui no comen si no se acomiden
Si aqui no ayudan, aqui ya no viven
Si aqui no das, ya no recives
Y ponganse en linea, que esto no es chiste
Que a mi no me importa que Heather no ayude
La muchacha huevona, alla su mama
Ahora la vi con el novio que tiene
De aqui a nueve meses que ya son papas
Pinche malandro nomas pa' robar
Es poquitero, rapero local
Y Claudia no quiero que siguas al mal
Y pobre de ti que si handas de igual! (mom!)

[Hook][Bridge]
I might pour some drink up on the low (I'm drinking now)
I might pop a bar up on the low (I'm singing now)
I might get fucked up until I'm gone (I'm faded)
Why the fuck y'all care 'bout what I'm on?

[Pre-Hook]
They try to say I got a problem
I cut them bitches off (You know I cut them bitches off)
They try to say I got a problem
I cut them bitches off (You know I cut them bitches off)

[Hook]
So what if I stay faded
I know it's wrong
Don't say it, I got control
Cause what the fuck you've done for me to talk about my life?
I've being doing too many wrongs, ain't might just make a right

[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna talk shit
How all of a sudden everybody got opinions about a bitch
Now they wanna tell me how it is
Kinda funny, pretty sure I'm sure you still be chillin' at the crib
You ain't put in work as hard as this
I've been putting work in while you hoes been sleeping in
Now I'm off touring, bitches wanna say some shit
Yeah you've got your two cents but bitch you need to get a grip
Shit

[Pre-Bridge]
I'm drinking now
I'm singing now
I'm drinking now
I'm singing

[Bridge]
I might pour some drink up on the low (I'm drinking now)
I might pop a bar up on the low (I'm singing now)
I might get fucked up until I'm gone (I'm faded)
Why the fuck y'all care 'bout what I'm on?

[Pre-Hook]
They try to say I got a problem
I cut them bitches off (You know I cut them bitches off)
They try to say I got a problem
I cut them bitches off (You know I cut them bitches off)

[Hook]
So what if I stay faded
I know what's wrong
Don't say it, I got control
Cause what the fuck you've done for me to talk about my life?
I've being doing too many wrongs, ain't might just make a right[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Yeah! Uhm
Look! Pockets looking cakey like these bummy bitches make up
It's room service bitch, the game requested that it get waked up!
See all I see is paper like my secretary's staplers
So if this was yo job, then I'm thinkin' your about to get a pay cut!
This my lane so fuck road rage, fuck yo anger!
I swear they wanna cuff this pretty young thing, like a bailiff!
Cuz I'm cute
And I be killing games since way back when it was Sega!
I be repping Texas but I'm so Cali like a Laker
Yeah, yeah I'm kind of cocky
When it come to what I'm made of
Cause we, we ain't the same
And they don't want you from the waist up!
You the cookie cutter type and they call me the baker!
And all I see is numbers, numbers, numbers like a pager
I kill em and collect em
Watch me murder glass cases
I swear you got to feel where the fuck I'm coming from like a taser
Cause if she fuck with me
Then not even the captain finna save her!
These bitches thinking they beefing
Fuck around and get fed, laid up!

[Hook]
I be looking, looking, looking
I don't see no difference!
Cookie, cookie, cookie
All these cookie cutter bitches!
Fuck these bitches, fuck these bitches
Oh cookie cutter bitches!
And I be looking, looking, looking
I don't see no difference!
Cookie, cookie, cookie
All these cookie cutter bitches!
Fuck these bitches, fuck these bitches!
Oh cookie cutter bitches!

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Look! You are just a small fry
But I'll turn you to mashed potato
I'm here to bring the flavor
Just like a turkey baster
I could be the finisher that will make ya meet your maker
See, if you still sleeping, I'mma wake and bake and shake ya
See, I be repping real women so bitches seeming faker
Now they be tripping on me, but like MGK say, "lace up!"
Cause my style is permanent and these bitches dry eraser
And all you April fools, I'll kill you off before um, May come!
Yeah, I know guerrilla warfare if you wanna ape up
All these chicks be thinking they beast well watch me tame em'
Greeting earthlings, "hi!" As-salam alaykum
Cause I'm out of this world, this illegal alien way up!
I'm ahead of my time but I like competing so I be waiting
Then I turn the lights on these roach bitches and I raid 'em
Bitches owe me royalties for jacking lyrics, so pay up!
Cause most of you bitches rappin' know nothing about me
But you wishing that I never came up!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Look man I keep looking around
And all these bitches look the fuckin' same, and the same
Ain't there nothing different on the menu[Intro]
Music affects your brain
Whether people will admit it or not
And you don't have to be weak minded for it to do so

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
All I wanna do is, go harder and harder
Get smarter than Harvard, go hard with the Slaughter
To keep it one hundred, I think the industry
Wanna see a nigga like me depart as a martyr
Walking on water, the flow is immaculate
Reading off the Dead Sea Scrolls as I'm rapping it
The track I'm crashing it
Making it look like a Cadillac had a bad accident
Cuz y'all ain't passionate, catch a jab to your abdomen
Then I'mma tap your chin, I'm a boss, you an applicant
Y'all cats pretend (never ever ever rap again)
Crooked I kick it in the hood
Pistol to protect me cuz I'm figuring it could
Homie, I’m living like a genie in a lamp
Rub me wrong, I wish a nigga would
Killers ready to get dirty
Some niggas who dress nerdy who ain't even touch 30
They quiet and ain't wordy, their firing ain't sturdy
I've been a couple of light years from any nigga that wanna discern me
So callate puto, Breaking Bad and I'm Tuco
Got the Hublot hanging out the bulletproof coupe though
If you didn't, now you do know!

[Hook: Crooked I]
Yo, light that up, pour that up
Middle finger music, throw that up
Act like this cuz we don't give a fuck
(We don't give a fuck)
Cuz we don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Why should I, man, with my good eye
I can see all y'all snakes so I put my
Foot up your ass, kill em with success
Look how I pass em up, I'm like "Goodbye!"
Million dollar bitches get bucked in the face
If he ain't about money then your husband a waste
I'mma switch the scenery up to a bank
That's how a real nigga cut to the Chase
Pour a little vodka, load the Glock up
Then roll some bomb up that'll blow Sadam up
Pull up in the drop with Snow Tha Product
We don't give a fuck is our code of conduct

[Verse 3: Snow Tha Product]
I've been at the shit through past due rents
Man I've been broke, I've been homeless, shit packed in bins
I've been at this since back when tax bracket shit
Was way past any practical math I did
Now I'm halfway past half to a capitalist
Three-fourths day of the year i rap top of the list
Now I'm really getting my dividends and stackin' up big
Gotta go back to where I'm from to mentally handle this shit
Cuz I've been a nobody so long, gonna readjust
Get a North Hollywood home
Still close enough to deal with bullshit deals
But yet far enough to be where Latin folks roam
All originality with a capital O
So the game wanna see a bitch broke with no soul
So I grasp it tight because a chick like me know
That I would rob these bitches because old habits die slow
Look I never been a punk and I never been a bitch
So you bitches better run, we all know the benefits
Cuz your 15's done when my 16's hit
Heard games are for fun but this game's bullshit
Bitch, no I did not come this far to quit
This argument is not even real
Went from not having a pot to piss to coppin' whips
And stocks and casas in hills
All these new bitches talking but chill
Watch when they get out of pocket, I'll kill
Any of them, got plenty of friends, in any event
I'll finish em off, no question, no squeal
Yes I am tired of all you sluts
That been coming in the game cause you bought your butts
Now you wanna claim fame cuz some guy you fucked
Is giving you a hood pass, should've passed you up
But yup, of course you lie, sit there and organize
Try to be more than just hoes, umm
Thinking you sort of tight cause someone wrote your lines
Thinking you whores have got flow, no
You can record the lies, gimme some more so I
Finally listen and hear dough
Cuz I've been trying to hear competition for a god damn year
But don't hear shit but ripoffs and hoes
Get off the blow, get up and get y'all a show
I have been hitting the road, building my own
Little by little but no, I do it all on my own
Yes I got dough, I don't split shit but to roll
Bitch I can show y'all the ropes
All of you hoes that got cosigns, clothesline dry ass
Stale ass bitches need those, I don't!

[Hook: Crooked I]

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
In the underground they put me on the throne
In the mainstream they say I don't belong
Talk about a nigga only good for a freestyle
Fuck that, we can go song-for-song
Word, I'm killing the best of men
Get rid of they next of kin, get rid of the pestilence
I give em a testament, I'm rebuilding the West
And I'm pissing off in the coffin that you resting in
Skinny jeans and leggings, you're anything but legend
I really bring the weapons, the semi beam behead ya
The guillotine'll sever my killing team and catch all my enemies
I bet you the ten of these will break you apart, yeah
Leaking in a puddle, whole hospital staff meeting in a huddle
Trying to figure out how to put your body parts back together
Just like the pieces of a puzzle
And I'm gone in the wind, yeah, I'm gone in the wind
I was fucked up, broke, really
Resting my Achilles, I'm balling again
Never going broke, say fuck that shit (fuck that shit)
Yeah fuck that shit
She don't fuck with Snow, fuck that bitch (fuck that bitch)
Fuck that bitch
Like imagination during masturbation
Fuck what you think, what the fuck did you think?
The day your opinions can cut me a check
That'll be the day I give a fuck what you think
You weak minded![Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
R.I.P. to Mike Brown
Never met Affleck, but I do it for the town
In the Chi where they find bodies in the lost and found
I've been blowing up in London, still smelling like a pound
While Ferguson was looting in the street
Obama was on the treadmill moving in repeat
I'm 21, I ain't had a cosign yet
Like Lamar Odom, they already know I had crack
Shout to Khloe, not Axel Foley
Call the police, your the lames on TV with braids like Lil' Romeo
No limit when I go in, it's a war zone
My troops home, they *brrt* "where you at?" like a boost phone
Y'all mobile, I'm global, we been different
Had a number #1 in the UK, that's a big difference
Not to mention, as a minor I was major
I ain't never get a job, I got my own business
SAVEMONEY

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Good credit, need no cosign
Snow Tha Product got the balls to come in the game
And I won't get no push from no guy
When I need the dough, split no pies
I'm not a cookie cutter bitch, but no shade
But if Snow spit it, Snow write
Oh, by the way you rappers namedrop El Chapo
Migos, Narkos, coppos, cop o's from papos
[?] Griselda Blanco
But I'm not gonna get my shot though?
Cuando a la culture para latina, tu you cacho
Pero mina que esta I'm raised on Pun and the best of 'em
You know I don't like Visas, give an Amex to a Mexican
And ooh, I'm 'bout to represent, ask BET
It's STP, hit your SAP button ASAP
Si porque mira nomas, mira que litica la chica [?}
Corazon de oro, pero con plata [?]
Si pero aqui no mas la que mata, bars, Sabado Gigante
Cause I'll be damned, if the only Latin rep is Joseline Hernandez

[Verse 3: Los]
Yo, I keep these rappers running like roaches when Raid come in
Los is the dopest, please don't provoke him to spray something
I hopped up out the bed as fresh as a Glade plugin
Cause I charged a high fee like the dance in the Bay, cousin
Just exit
Trying to describe me in one word is like if you spell dog, but you dyslexic
They should've kept my cage locked
Where I'm from if he say he tryna shoot that fade he get his fade shot
Hey, Pac, remember shit was poppin'?
You on my list, it was a wrap, I was Christmas shoppin'
I kept a full body cast for a bitch to hop in
Then I full bodied Cass while Swizz was watching
I'm way better whether you may agree
Mayweather pedigree, you make cheddar bet it on me
I get the best of the best dealt with
So when my magazine hit I ain't talking XXL shit
So the whip matte black, the top bent back
Got a chick misguided like a [?] flip
"Hello?" Man, hold that phone
My little homie raw, man, he got both Techs on
He told me to tell you it's a no flex zone
So you ain't making no chuck, nor is he getting his Bo Flex on
He unload that chrome, and send them if you talkie
I give him detail, and he'll pin it on a donkey
King

[Verse 4: Treach]
I put the word out like word out, word is bond, word up
Word is bird, wordie words that I heard
I got a herd of verbs that'll slap [?] after yours
Anything after the fact is an act of war
Bad man and a wicked shotta
Wet you up like an otter, operate like Shabba
Hundred thousands way to hump, choose a telly
I'm rude and black like Ox from Belly
Got shellys to shock your shooters
Bet a bottom dollar I can make thunder clap and make a rottweiler holla
Yeah, rob the rich and eat with the hood, bang
Cause Jersey's back, back top of the food chain
KG was on the scenery
He said "eat the cypher, turn the BET to an eatery"
And here's a true statement
Half of the hip in hip hop needs a hip replacement

[Verse 5: David Banner]
My dream is to be a part of team Elohim
To transcend ten of walks of human beings
Meditate and convo with the all eye seeing
To maybe just hear
Quiet my soul so he shares or It can lighten my load
My soul [?] commode
Defecate [?]
I'm susceptible to the pressure but then I think about Shakir Stewart
I need help from the almighty
To ask why don't we discuss the trials of Chris Lightly
From Ku Klux the Klan who tied Emmett Till to a fan
The same that shot Tray, Zimmerman's hand
They got my stomach to a knot
I'm bent over prayin' to God like it's a lot, it's a lot
Ankles tied to some chain
I wanna say yes, but it's no like Tulane
I mean N.O
Not too many blacks make it to the show; Jay Leno
Went broke in a Bentley, now I'm rich whipping a pinto
I'm stunting like deep dish rims on Hertz rentals
When I was broke I was proud to sell dope to ya old folks house
Nigga, I meant it how it sounds
Where were the white rappers when they mowed Mike Brown down?
Nowhere to be found[Hook: x2]
I got a backpack, shades, and a heart that's made of gold
And the title of my life: "The Best Story Ever Told" and
I think that I'm doing alright
So what if I wake up late and party all night?
I'm doing fine

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Pale skin shawty, clay chain hanging
All these haters like to talk
But I'm still something they can't hang with they blogging at their home
I'm out on paid vacation
And I would name em all by name
But that's my time that they've been wasting
So I'm kicking back, hanging out
Really ain't shit that I'm worried bout
I'm just paying my bills, and my mama bills too
Your problems seem so basic now
Me and my team getting fading now
But they're now playing bout while we wait around
Two shows one day three tests for the weekend
We can't even make it now
It seems so funny that they hating what we moving
It's kind of crazy, that they chasing what we doing
It's kind of lame all these other rappers choose it
And start hating on the girls starting to fuck with the movement
Come on man, we do it!

[Hook, 2x]

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Hype around snowy anything I say I mean
Anything I spit is real as me
Anything I do is from my team
So we just kicking back making move
Hold to get a break for a day or two
And even then I got bizz, when I handle in the bit
Then is back up on road trip with the wake up crew
We woke, we smoke, we wake the game up
And we know we go, so go, the game gon' change up
This little chick from San Jose
And I'm taking over mind is made up
And I ain't gonna stop, till I cop me a guap
Found mansion somewhere rich as fuck
And I'm just dreaming big, having fun
Still one of the cool kids
Then I tell mom that I'm gonna get paid
Then I'm stopping all the bullshit
Cause she know she know the money I'm using
Till the bills is off of my music
And she finally coming around, I told her "Come on man, we do this!"

[Hook 2x][Produced by Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Man I got a call 'bout 11 o'clock
So I had to step out and step in the garage
And as I looked down and I checked who had called
I had noticed it was you and I text you to stop
I had to hit you with the "not now" with the "hold up"
Even though you know I'm not down you like "so what"
I'm looking at the bigger picture but you want a close up
What we had is in the past now you wanna show up
I remember what you put me through
And I remember what you did when you did what you did back then
Now you wanna come around like I'm supposed to be down
Trying to fuck up everything and the situation I'm in
Hold up

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign] (x2)
Girl, I just wanna kick it 1 time
I ain't worried 'bout your man, hell naw I don't mind
What he don't know won't hurt him

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
I guess the saying is true when it pertain to you
Cause you be missing what you have like it's a thing to do
You left a dollar for a dime and now when things improve
You wanna call me up, talking 'bout "I'm swinging through"
And with them late night texts, talking all that mess
Saying to give you one night cause you were my best
Boy I don't really pay no mind to anything I've left
It must be something that you're missing, but I digress
I got a business meeting, no visiting
You be trippin' and hitting me up
Just to kick it and such
Now you tryna chill in the cut
Bet that isn't enough
Hit you with the "mmm hold up"

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
All I need is one time with ya
One more goodbye
One last kiss, one last try
He don't know you like I do girl
He don't hold you like I do girl
And to tell you the truth
He ain't got enough money to handle you girl

[Hook] (x2)[Intro]
I mean, it's like New Year's Eve and shit
I maaay be drunk, hehe, I'm drunk..
Look

[Verse 1]
Snowy ohhee, bored with the game
I'm just fucking taking selfies, keeping boys entertained
With the noise if you hate, lately I've been on my shit
I've been smoking, I've been drinking, popping pills and pulled a fit
I'm just trying to find some peace, but lately I've done lost my shit
I'm just trying to throw the peace up, then I realize I'm it
Imma need a fucking hit, Imma need these fucking chips
I'm the closest one to making it, and Latinas don't quit
I've done came so far, Tha Liks thou
That Chicano rap ain't show me love but its so
Hey, look I done got these bitches hands up like dip blow
I ain't even salty, I'm no hater so sit yo motherfucking ass right back and listen to me then
I'm the proudest motherfucking Mexican ever since SPM
I've done did this shit myself and ain't nobody politic
Up in my favorite, I've got haters that don't wanna see me win
But I'm with it, spit it, straight from the beginning
Still up in the race that ain't nobody ever finish
And I'm gifted, get it, who else fucking with it?
Fuck it, Imma kill the game and leave y'all guys as witness
Its about to fucking snow, its a cold fucking winter
When this game's a piece of cake and they won't even get a sliver
I've done have my own style and Snow got them hoes all up shivered
I've just got my motherfucking hair stole by a Jenner
I'm like "Fuck that shit, I don't give a fuck."
Ask anybody caught, he got trying to touch Cloe's ass
I ain't beefing with no female, we all trying to get cash
Only beef with Uncle Sam cause he got my ass taxed

[Outro]
Not bad for procrastinating all of 2014, though

Happy 2015!

Fuck you Uncle Sam for taxing the fuck out of a young playa!

Ahh! I was still going to have that one more time!
It ended?[Hook: B Real]
All black everything, just like paint
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East
I'm moving, I'm moving
East and the East and the killers in the West
Just get smoking
Why you fucking with stress?

[Verse 1: B Real]
Break in my line if you don't know the dock
Get in line, don't fuck around looking for my crop
Get dumb as the one that's the rise to the top
Product of Versace I'mma hit you with the Glock
Bitch we riding high, we keep stacking
Money like coats in closets, keep racking
Backs like Cali quakes, keep cracking
Skilled what the doctor know, what up with no slacking

[Hook: B Real]
All black everything, just like paint
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East
I'm moving, I'm moving
East and the East and the killers in the West
Just get smoking
Why you fucking with stress?

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Killer in the game and the one finna pop
So don't mind if I come around, spend a little guap
Snow been the chick, all these rap bitches jock
All these bum bitches, I'm the cream of the crop
Look I'm riding 'round, I been got it
Robbing these banks, these dudes, and these pockets
All of these hating bitches still watching
But I don't get no pay for no talking
Constant

[Hook: B Real]
All black everything, just like paint
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East

East and the East and the killers in the West
Just get smoking
Why you fucking with stress?

[Verse 3: Demrick]
Couple rolled up for the road
Hotbox any spot that I go
Yah
Steamed like a pot on the stove
Chase that with a shot of Patron
Fuck stacking my papers
But that just assesses I make it
I know boy it's coming
You don't like where I'm at
Then I know for a fact
People really hate what I'm becoming
I came in this game with a flow and a flame
Never go'n switch man the story's the same
Drinking this liquor, I fuck with my niggas
I always deliver, that's not gonna change
Ribs on a raise, tits on a frame
Jet fuel on a plane
Her ass is ridic, she grabbed on my stick
Trying drive me insane

[Hook: B Real]
All black everything, just like paint
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East
I'm moving, I'm moving
East and the East and the killers in the West
Just get smoking
Why you fucking with stress?[Verse 1]
Yo, look, I woke up with my attitude, Kanye
I don't give a fuck what my mom say
Okay, maybe a little bit, but only cause I'm really not tryna start up any beef with my madre
But in my mind, today I'm Beyoncé
I don't wanna hear whatever y'all say
I'm a beast, give me monster, no latte
Wearin' all black, like I'm robbin' you in broad day
I had one too many bad nights
Today I don't wanna hear no advice
So all of you little bitches, act nice
I don't wanna fuckin' have to ask twice
Bitch, any other day but not hoy
You can even hear the tone of my voice
Today my grind is pumped up on 'roids
Today my ego's gassed up, like Floyd
Look, I...

[Hook]
Swear to God, the life I live, has got my mom, like, ay, ay, ay
All my bro's, that sellin' O's, that kush, that dro, that white
What you want? Them bars, Patron, that got you on that, ay, ay, ay
Tryna roll, you lose control, we on that level, don't try, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay [x8]

[Verse 2]
Yo, look, my mama kicked me out, cause I was partyin' like YOLO
Woke me up for church, I was hungover, she's like, "oh, no"
Gave my ass a bucket, trapeador, and got the Cloro
Pitbull jacked my mom, since I was a baby she yellin ‘Como!?’
She like: Como que no? Ponte a trapear
Todo lo que compro te doi, ponte a limpiar
Pantalones rotos y ya ponte a lavar
Aqui no tienes voto, carnal, ponteme el par
Aqui no comen si no se acomiden
Si aqui no ayudan, aqui ya no viven
Si aqui no das, ya no recives
Y ponganse en linea, que esto no es chiste
Que a mi no me importa que Heather no ayude
La muchacha huevona, alla su mama
Ahora la vi con el novio que tiene
De aqui a nueve meses que ya son papas
Pinche malandro nomas pa' robar
Es poquitero, rapero local
Y Claudia no quiero que siguas al mal
Y pobre de ti que si handas de igual! (mom!)

[Hook][Hook x4]
Bad bitches, bad bitches on deck (stage)
Checking for the cash and I'm cashing all these checks

[Verse 1]
Young mami, flyer than a bitch
I'm a deal's home-run, don't need to slide in the shit
They can't stop me and its obviously
Cause i just hop up in the booth to show them monsters exist
I never brag about shit but Imma brag about tonight
I got all the bottles coming and I'm stunting out of spite
Cause these bitches keep on thinking they not finna see me shine
Bitch, I just spent 'bout 30 racks like it ain't shit so fuck your life
I'm saying uhh, who you think brought up all these chicks?
I'm saying uhh, who you think handling her biz?
I got a buzz, probably make me harder than i rip up any track
And still i ain't gotta show my ass or show you shit
I got a white girl texting from the crowd like where you at
My ex boyfriend in this bitch and he still tryna get me back
I got a couple Puerto Ricans popping bars up in the back
And I'm still kinda indepo, I keep it Strange like snake and bat
I'm saying

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
Young mami, pulled up in a foreign
I brought up all these bitches and i pull them on like torrents
Club owner gon' love me, we ain't leaving till the morning
Tell 'em keep on bringing bottles, I was Woke TV recording
I'm like who the fuck will judge us when it's dark outside
If you're hating, then you're broke, bitch, fuck your life
Win your prize, if you're nice I can sign you to the label
You can dance up on stage like you're dancing on the table
I'm a boss bitch with a real boss bitch playing
Got deposits and they all big like Rosanne
Best be cautious I got options think fast
Here's the office number call it, this your chance
I never brag about shit but Imma brag about tonight
I got all the bottles coming and I'm stunting out of spite
Cause these bitches keep on thinking they not finna see me shine
Bitch, I just spent 'bout 30 racks like it ain't shit so fuck your life

[Hook x4][Hook] x 2
So we just keep it movin', movin'
Movin', movin', movin', movin'
Hate it’s the cheapest hobby you can have
So we gonna make it to the top
And keep makin' these haters mad
Just keep it movin'

[Verse 1]
I'ma, just keep it moving, while I roll like this
I got plenty of old friends that don’t get dough like this
So let me just pick up the phone and order 4 or 5 big
Bottles to pop while we’re on top and run the show like this
I know I should have never brag but damn it feel too great
That when they hated, I created more new songs they played
And I just took this struggle and stride took day by day
And now I’m coming up to the top and yep we came to stay
I got these haters talkin' but I just seem to keep on movin'
I’m just chillin', looking icy, keep it real and keep it cool
And makin' money makin' moves, and living life with something to prove
Cause life’s a teacher, I’m the student
I’m just learning what I’m doing and ain’t really much to do
But give me the best in the world
They say that life’s a bitch
I hope that bitch like Mexican girls and hey
Just give me the best in the world
They say that life’s a bitch
I hope that bitches like Mexican girls

[Hook] x 2

[Verse 2]
Its hard coming in the game, when you hop in the beat
The weakest said, so instead of simply being happy for me
You just some haters that my privacy need
Back to the streets, and back to struggling for money
And back to having cds
Up in my back pack and sellin' em, pitchin' em
One by one, they want me to back track to when I was struggling selling none
I used to wish that I could live it up tourin' and havin' fun
I want mom to top floor and got my haters lookin' up
Cause they wanna bring me down but my team and I moving
We’re sippin' on a 40 edition with my crew
We keep it movin', oh yeah we keep it movin'
I got my product pushas' back because I know they got mine
I always chop it up with them, but these haters get no time
I got these kids are down for me, so I don’t care about co signs
Cause co signs are for bad credit
My credit is just fine

[Hook] x 2[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
R.I.P. to Mike Brown
Never met Affleck, but I do it for the town
In the Chi where they find bodies in the lost and found
I've been blowing up in London, still smelling like a pound
While Ferguson was looting in the street
Obama was on the treadmill moving in repeat
I'm 21, I ain't had a cosign yet
Like Lamar Odom, they already know I had crack
Shout to Khloe, not Axel Foley
Call the police, your the lames on TV with braids like Lil' Romeo
No limit when I go in, it's a war zone
My troops home, they *brrt* "where you at?" like a boost phone
Y'all mobile, I'm global, we been different
Had a number #1 in the UK, that's a big difference
Not to mention, as a minor I was major
I ain't never get a job, I got my own business
SAVEMONEY

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Good credit, need no cosign
Snow Tha Product got the balls to come in the game
And I won't get no push from no guy
When I need the dough, split no pies
I'm not a cookie cutter bitch, but no shade
But if Snow spit it, Snow write
Oh, by the way you rappers namedrop El Chapo
Migos, Narkos, coppos, cop o's from papos
[?] Griselda Blanco
But I'm not gonna get my shot though?
Cuando a la culture para latina, tu you cacho
Pero mina que esta I'm raised on Pun and the best of 'em
You know I don't like Visas, give an Amex to a Mexican
And ooh, I'm 'bout to represent, ask BET
It's STP, hit your SAP button ASAP
Si porque mira nomas, mira que litica la chica [?}
Corazon de oro, pero con plata [?]
Si pero aqui no mas la que mata, bars, Sabado Gigante
Cause I'll be damned, if the only Latin rep is Joseline Hernandez

[Verse 3: Los]
Yo, I keep these rappers running like roaches when Raid come in
Los is the dopest, please don't provoke him to spray something
I hopped up out the bed as fresh as a Glade plugin
Cause I charged a high fee like the dance in the Bay, cousin
Just exit
Trying to describe me in one word is like if you spell dog, but you dyslexic
They should've kept my cage locked
Where I'm from if he say he tryna shoot that fade he get his fade shot
Hey, Pac, remember shit was poppin'?
You on my list, it was a wrap, I was Christmas shoppin'
I kept a full body cast for a bitch to hop in
Then I full bodied Cass while Swizz was watching
I'm way better whether you may agree
Mayweather pedigree, you make cheddar bet it on me
I get the best of the best dealt with
So when my magazine hit I ain't talking XXL shit
So the whip matte black, the top bent back
Got a chick misguided like a [?] flip
"Hello?" Man, hold that phone
My little homie raw, man, he got both Techs on
He told me to tell you it's a no flex zone
So you ain't making no chuck, nor is he getting his Bo Flex on
He unload that chrome, and send them if you talkie
I give him detail, and he'll pin it on a donkey
King

[Verse 4: Treach]
I put the word out like word out, word is bond, word up
Word is bird, wordie words that I heard
I got a herd of verbs that'll slap [?] after yours
Anything after the fact is an act of war
Bad man and a wicked shotta
Wet you up like an otter, operate like Shabba
Hundred thousands way to hump, choose a telly
I'm rude and black like Ox from Belly
Got shellys to shock your shooters
Bet a bottom dollar I can make thunder clap and make a rottweiler holla
Yeah, rob the rich and eat with the hood, bang
Cause Jersey's back, back top of the food chain
KG was on the scenery
He said "eat the cypher, turn the BET to an eatery"
And here's a true statement
Half of the hip in hip hop needs a hip replacement

[Verse 5: David Banner]
My dream is to be a part of team Elohim
To transcend ten of walks of human beings
Meditate and convo with the all eye seeing
To maybe just hear
Quiet my soul so he shares or It can lighten my load
My soul [?] commode
Defecate [?]
I'm susceptible to the pressure but then I think about Shakir Stewart
I need help from the almighty
To ask why don't we discuss the trials of Chris Lightly
From Ku Klux the Klan who tied Emmett Till to a fan
The same that shot Tray, Zimmerman's hand
They got my stomach to a knot
I'm bent over prayin' to God like it's a lot, it's a lot
Ankles tied to some chain
I wanna say yes, but it's no like Tulane
I mean N.O
Not too many blacks make it to the show; Jay Leno
Went broke in a Bentley, now I'm rich whipping a pinto
I'm stunting like deep dish rims on Hertz rentals
When I was broke I was proud to sell dope to ya old folks house
Nigga, I meant it how it sounds
Where were the white rappers when they mowed Mike Brown down?
Nowhere to be found[Verse 1]
Bet that I blow a few stacks
That you ain't know, Woke independent
I tell them I know you knew that, Snow be so dope
I'm numbing the feeling of all of the hate that I feel that I'm getting
From broke male rappers and ugly ass women
That say I ain't shit cause Nicki and Iggy
They downplay the lyrics delivered, I'm killing
I'm hitting, but have you seen them?
Only way that Imma kill it, get a booty like Selena
Heard she ate pizza, now I'm calling Domino's, Pizza Hut, my man cheesin'
Cause for some reason he like that I'm eating
I'm pushing this weight now my weight kinda leading
I'm staying in places, he like what he seeing
I tell him grab on cause I'm taking these meeting
And-I'm-out-here working again
Ain't that what I'm supposed to do? Bitch, I'm a Mexican
While you bedazzled, I'm fighting embezzlements
I be in court and I'm not one to settle it
Y'all owe me money, I will fucking getting it
Then, I know the rules and my rules have been bent
And my grind committed, my money demented
I'll hire some immigrants, pin you like Pinterest
Cause they don't know English, they won't get a sentence
Cause we could build houses, no blueprint, no template
Believe me, it's easy to burn down your residence
Snow get them wake cause they're not on the sentence

[Hook]
Now bitch, you can bet that I will
Now bitch, you can bet that I will
Now bitch, you can bet that I will[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Yo, look
Always been the type to overthink
Which caused all this fear in me
But I ain't never been scared
And I been full aware
But the truth in this shit killin' me
Cause I know this world
And I know a girl
Like me ain't really gonna change it all
But I know I've worked
And I know they heard
That me and my partners came to ball
And ain't nothing gonn' stop this
Cause I do it for more than my pockets
And I do it for more than just dough
There's more to Miss Snow
Find out 'fore you talk shit
Cause I got a crew of kids that's involved
I do this music for y'all
I'm out here touring this hard
Just know this winner won't fall
And I go HAM cause I know my chances
Have gone by half cause [?]
And I know I'm gonn' have to be all I can
Cause all my fam seeing all this

[Bridge]
Man tell 'em that am gonn' need all this cash (now)

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Man, I've been about it
Everyone but this pen has doubted
Look bro, I been alone
And I been at home
Wit' like 20 in the bank but the rent's a thousand
Had a one bedroom
And I built me a booth
Paid for Pro Tools
Got a pull out couch
Slept in the living room
Made Ramen Noodle soup
No food don't tell me what being down is
I've worked for this
Let 'em know what my verses is

Tryna talk down if she ain't heard my shit?

Cake cake cake cake (ahh)

Back in the day they didn't cop my tape
They didn't not give a shit so fuck they feelings (ahh)

[Hook]

[Outro: Snow Tha Product] x2
Tell 'em put me on

[Hook][Hook: Honey Cocaine] (x2)
Oh you drink a lot? (bitch same)

Gotta hit it then I lane switch, go
And I got the right game, bitch flow

Your mantle is weak, frame full of ramen
Only stupid bitches never eat their almonds
Your bae lookin' basic, and mine lookin' foreign
Turn your bitch a Rita Ora when we touring
Fuck it call her Rita Ora when we touring
Damn, pull up to Miami just to tan dog

I'm original, your a motherfuckin' sample

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]

Get confronted by some Mexicans in case they catch you flexin'
I be getting all the bread, my bank on continental breakfast
Me and Honey getting money, that's assured you second guessing
Bitch

[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Um, you must not know the word value
You grown, find out what it is when a girl get at you
Don't you know what I've been about?
How long I've been down for me to have heard about you?
Trying to go behind my back? Got no time for that
Tryin' to drive birds into my coupe?
You said hold you down
I held you down, I even held you up
No one gave a fuck about your troubles
Who the hell do you think stepped up?
Your memory is fuzzy again
Even your buddies and friends wasn't around
Now that the money come in, you gonna pretend
You don't know who helped you out
Okay, okay, okay, let's both play little games this way
Relocate your pay my way 'for I go take these bills to co-pay
Cause it ain't going down like that
See, I loved you but the truth is
You fucked me over but fucked with my money ughh I'm gonna get ruthless

[Hook:]
You just gotta accept this
It's a wrap, It's a wrap
I'm only gonna tell you one time
Imma tell you what the business is

Cause once you're going, there's no coming back
I'm only gonna tell you one time
Imma tell you what the business is
Imma tell you what the business is

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
They gon' mind me, I'm just telling it like it is
I'm just saying that I'm done being the rider chick that you wanted in
Now you switched all of it, cause you be balling in
I was with you in college and didn't I help you through all of it?
Didn't I pay for the deposit and got busted APT?
That we lived in when you act shady?
Now you're gonna act like your chick ain't G?
Cause I'll be damned if you think you're gonna play me
Oh, oh, I wasn't with you shooting in the gym?
Who the fuck do you think held you down when your punk ass didn't win?
Yeah, when you be calling me
When you be crying to me cause you felt like shit
I gave you all of me with no apology and this is the help I get?
Okay, okay, okay, go on and leave then
But as for the keys and Visa, please get the fuck out but just leave them

[Hook][Verse 1]
Hot mama from California
The senorita, the reason these whores be up
Pour me up, drink in a 40 up

Good nights, motherfucker, bad mornings, huh
Good kush bad bitch is the formula
Course we up, everybody on Morpheus
Smoking till we get cataracts in our corneas
I’m in factor up in it, back to cash getting
I relax for a minute, back to fast living
I’ve been acting and we have to crash in it
‘Cause this rap shit is in me, have to have work

[Bridge]
And it’s all black, everything down to the socks
Kill em, leave evidence, motherfuck a cop, cop
Hit ‘em like mary jane, I don’t need a wedding ring
OG’s out, yeah, I’m married to the block

[Hook]
Tryina get to this function

California love

[Verse 2]
Killer Cali in a Caddy
San Jo' shark in the central valley
Haters gonna get but no one getting at me

And these haters all cop but my clock tick tock
Haters all watch but I’m ‘bout to go off

And I still rock a beanie and a hoodie in Cortez

[Bridge]

[Hook][Hook: x2]
I guess the cash rules everything around me
I need to change my ways
I've been trying but I need to change my ways

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Half of the time, I don't know where I'm at, I'll be tripping and shit
I'm not famous or unknown but this can get to you quick
I'll sip on a little alcohol and I'll be dabbling on some drugs
I'm not telling you what to do, but if you haven't then trust
Don't do it, shit'll get you fucked up
Or have you feeling numb once and you be falling in love
Aww man, you mean I don't gotta feel no more?
You mean I can live in my head, dreams won't get killed no more?
I can erase whatever happened and I don't gotta deal no more?
I mean you can, but then you're back and shit ain't real no more
You gotta backtrack and shit, go back to where you left it all
Thought you left it all, but nope, this shit will get you lost
Now you're right back but more depressed than when you left
You gotta 'fess to the bullshit feelings of emptiness
And now you're tripping, everyone thinking that you're okay
But now you're slipping, late nights you laying in your bed
And you start thinking, how the fuck am I gonna matter?
I wanna change but I need change, so I'm making my pockets fatter
Cause the cash rules everything aroound

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
What are we even here for?
My generation is lame, so you start like
Dear Lord, please help me to get some change
I need some cash, I need it fast, I need a job that I like
Imma need someone on my bed that'll make me feel it's alright
These negative thoughts in my head that be making me think twice
About everything I'm doing when I'm just trying to do right
Going up like elevators, cause Andre used to talk to me
But he's been gone lately, so I be looking for him constantly
I need some Lauryn, Pun, Pac, and some Eminem
I need some artists that I can listen to like way back when
I need a lot, fuck, I need peace of mind
And you only get that with accounts with a couple G's aside
For this empathy inside, cause I know we all need
Artists need to humanize, cause I know we all bleed
And I know I can't cop half the shit that rappers nowadays get
But I kinda be thinking that Imma need to help this generation

[Hook][Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Yeah! Uhm
Look! Pockets looking cakey like these bummy bitches make up
It's room service bitch, the game requested that it get waked up!

And they don't want you from the waist up!
You the cookie cutter type and they call me the baker!
And all I see is numbers, numbers, numbers like a pager

Watch me murder glass cases
I swear you got to feel where the fuck I'm coming from like a taser

Now they be tripping on me, but like MGK say, "lace up!"
Cause my style is permanent and these bitches dry eraser
And all you April fools, I'll kill you off before um, May come!
Yeah, I know guerrilla warfare if you wanna ape up
All these chicks be thinking they beast well watch me tame em'
Greeting earthlings, "hi!" As-salam alaykum
Cause I'm out of this world, this illegal alien way up!
I'm ahead of my time but I like competing so I be waiting
Then I turn the lights on these roach bitches and I raid 'em
Bitches owe me royalties for jacking lyrics, so pay up!
Cause most of you bitches rappin' know nothing about me
But you wishing that I never came up!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Look man I keep looking around
And all these bitches look the fuckin' same, and the same
Ain't there nothing different on the menu[Intro]
[Woman:] What's up? What's wrong?
[Snow:] Let's kill this motherfucker
[Woman:] Yeah, but what's wrong though?
[Snow:] I feel fucking disrespected, and this is what the fuck I do, I fucking kill people. So if you're riding, we're going, and if not, get the fuck out
[Woman:] Shit, I'm down
[Snow:] Let's go then


[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
If a fight break out, your lights may go out and
Might he slow your life, know your life span
Try with all your might but you just can't
See you slept when you stepping on me
Can digging your join your jeffer with me
Don't pretend number one contender
Not what you're used to, juice you like blender
If busting is a crime I'm the first offender
Can open up a can, on your ass is tender
And got a proper referee never da have a legacy
Who be the best of the best and I'm guessing me (You're guessing me)
And break down a sixteen, if it's clean, not missing
Not one thing is glistening, it's pristine, you're listening to

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] (x2)

Isn't your group with ya?
DAMAGE DAMAGE

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Now when I step in, these bitches that sitting
Fit'in' to get the fuck up
I'm make em all get dead, I’m a Mexican wreckin'
Like a junk in a truck
When I said younger bested, this is statement
No question, and I don’t give a fuck
And you said that you fly, you habitual liar
You comin against me, you shit out of luck
I'ma come through and damage, everything that you own
Everything that you like, if you ain't understanding
Is it hard to decode, can you see in my eyes
That I'm not to be played with, I'm possibly crazy and nuts
See monstrosities constantly y'all at the back of my mind
Bitch I damage, everything that’s average
I'ma kill em again, I go H.A.M. no sammich
No spittin' in Spanish Mami si que anda al cien
Ahora si, si, Ven contra mi, mi. Let's do it again
Compra mi CD, te mato a ti, ti, y mato a tus friends

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] (x2)

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Now to the people, the people they see no evil, the people love us
There is no evil, then if you peeping then leave him to us
Run from the steep hill, but even we can be mean when we bust
Not just a little, we try to eat up your veetle's for lunch (Keep goin')
I think my sequel genius wasn't equal, people seen us they was teekel
That we sing up and link too much (And then)
You still be getting beaten and see the repeatedly, repeating our frequency
Guess I'm just speaking too much

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] (x2)

Yeah yeah yeah he used to be a player
Used to say he's getting that paper
And he used to call my friends haters
Cause they told me he was unfaithful
Yeah, he used to say he work late but
Then, all them lies that he made up
Really wasn't shit when I caught him with a chick
Then I had to cut em off like a razor
Now I only care about my riches
Got my, got my M with them sixes
Cut my hair and got six inch heels
Get killed when I hit that switching
Now he talking about that he misses
Says he really wanna make his misses
Now he said he really wanna make me his Mrs
He said he stopped with them bitches
I said boy that ain't none of my business

[Hook:]
Got my ex-es saying damn it
Miss-missing what they had

Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it

[Verse 2:]
He used to act like he was pimping
Brag about bitches he been with
Used to talk that mess about he winning
Used to drive around in that Lincoln
Now he got some stupid girl pregnant
Got himself two dependents
At his momma's house with no credit
He’s all bad and got 2 infants
Meanwhile I been getting my cheese up
Swiping Debit and Visas
Mind my business and i re'd up
That little thing got a little bit of G's up
In my piggy bank & getting hella features
And in my aide in a beast cut
And ain't no telling when you fucking with a felon
Who been dealing with a whole lot of believers

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
This guy that I used to date
Used to act like everything gray
But he used to fuck with girls like all day
Then he left me for some ho around the way
But to say in goes, the players get played
Girl fucked his bro and gave his ass shade
Boy he beat her ass and called her gay
And then he just so happens to call me the other day
See now he calling me something crazy
Been bout me having this baby
Said he swear thinking about me lately
I'm like damn that girl gave you shady
Cause you broke now, you got no style
And she left you with no car
Meanwhile I've been coming up in the game
And then shit change, you're a bum and I'm a star

[Hook:][Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Light skinned long hair señorita, rolling up sativa
Finally in the lime light, slice limes and tequila
Living like can you keep up, I'm on the beach in Rosarito
Yup I got my feet up, you wanna see then pull a seat up
Cause we bout to eat good, we been working for the past years
Life's about to have to pay me back for the past tears
Passing cashiers all of my Visa cards
I hand my momma hella bags and tell her these are yours
Now we afford to buy cause of my weeks of tours
Are having to finally pay me back cause yes I need couture
Now I need you boys to know you can keep the whores
Cause I ain't looking for a man, I make G's galore

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Please don't judge me
No, please don't say you love me
(I'm young and I'm dumb and I'm turning up
Turning up turning up (x2))

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
I came back from quite the hiatus
Yeah I had them waiting counted out but I came around
I'm saying hi to you haters
Cause I'm bout to make it, about to take it to the majors
Man I'm tired of playing, I'm tired of having to being patient
We bout to eat good no more struggling now
We buzzing in town, my cousin and my brother been down
To run for the crown, we about to make em woke if they sleeping
Coming for y'all, we bout to make a toast to the weekend
Cause I got me a check with my name on top
I'm bout to make it happen for the kids on the block
Cause the turn up don't stop yea it don't stop tell em

[Hook][Hook]
Now I'm on the phone talkin' with you
Cause I'm drunk and I miss you
And I know we have issues
But I called to say "What's up" and "What you doin'?"
"Who you there with?"
"Would you like me to come over
And remind you why we fell in drunk love?"

[Verse 1]
Okay we had a fight, so what?
Don't act like you never done me wrong, hold up
So I got mad and I called the tow truck
And it ended up costin' you 454 bucks
But, umm, you should of never yelled like that
And you know me, you know that I'll be yellin' right back
You know what I'm about and you know where my mind's at
And if you gonna disrespect me, then I'm gonna fight back
But anyway, yes I hit the club
And anyway, yes I did get buzzed
And anyway, yes I thought about stuff
And I realized I think I'm a little messed up
Cause I drank 5 shots, cause my girls said "eff him,"
"Girl you don't need him if he gon' be disrespectin"
"Girl you did right and I hope he learned his lesson"
I'm like "Yeah! Wait a second... "

[Hook]
Now I'm on the phone talkin' with you
Cause I'm drunk and I miss you
And I know we have issues
But I called to say "What's up" and "What you doin'?"
"Who you there with?"
"Would you like me to come over
And remind you why we fell in drunk love?"

[Verse 2]
Okay, don't hang up
I know we do this a lot, but wait up
I thought about it, and I don't wanna break up
And I was thinkin' maybe I can stop by later
And I can make you feel the same way
Cause I know you got me feelin' crazy
And you got me back and forth and my last resort is to drink and that just ain't me
And I know we argue
And I been trying not to call you
And it's been roller-coaster ride, and it got a lot worse when you walked in to the club and I saw you
So now I'm back to this, after I've been drinkin'
Back to you and I'm losin' my inhibitions
Maybe I shouldn't have called it like this, but I'm drunk and I been thinkin'...

[Hook]
Now I'm on the phone talkin' with you
Cause I'm drunk and I miss you
And I know we have issues
But I called to say "What's up" and "What you doin'?"
"Who you there with?"
"Would you like me to come over
And remind you why we fell in drunk love?"

[Bridge x2]
I'm in this punch drunk love
So I had to call so I could say "What's up? "
I'm trying to figure out if we can chill (if we can chill)
If we can chill (if we can chill)
If we can chill (if we can chill)
If we can chill (if we can chill)

[Hook]
Now I'm on the phone talkin' with you
Cause I'm drunk and I miss you
And I know we have issues
But I called to say "What's up" and "What you doin'?"
"Who you there with?"
"Would you like me to come over
And remind you why we fell in drunk love?"

[Outro]
Punch drunk love...
Punch drunk love...
Punch drunk love...
Punch drunk love...[Intro: Snow Tha Product (talking)]
I mean, like, this song goes hella hard (laughs)
I don't want G-Eazy to be mad at me or nothing
I just really like this song..

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Pardon my Español, but hola güey
Look I done popped on the scene and I'm suave
Us Cali rappers gas on 'em no low octane
Tours 40 days headlining, no off days
Cortezes, eyeliner, love my chola ways
Still really not concerned what you hoes all say
That is not my job that is yo job, babe
Look I'm from Killa California, bitch you don't want fades
Went from sellin' yadamean to these co-op days
Got my business structured, bitch I get dough all day
I'm just gettin braggadocious, mane don't mind me
But I came a ways from flea markets yellin', "Comprale!"
I'll take it way back, Greyhound, Redwood City
Had the Bay sound when I came out rappin like, "Fuck wit' me"
San Jose shark in daygo cause life was good to me
Now I'm in Hollywood, finna pop fans lovin me
Goin' far

[Hook: G-Eazy and Snow Tha Product]
They used to tell me
I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone)
They used to always say
I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone)
But now I'm here, bitch!

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
My parents had a combined income of 20k
Went and quadrupled that shit in one good day
So everything from now on is just icing on the cake
Even on my bad days I just open up the safe
I done went from no job, no income comin'
To several smart investments, check Miss Snow's budget
Nobody gonna tell me shit if you wasn't
With me in '07 slangin' tapes, no buddy
Back when I was sellin' tickets to open in SD
When producers said "To make it best, dress sexy"
Mexi, Lil' chick, backpack, best trees
Yes me hustle, big shouts BMSB
Think I'm not gone make it when they doubt all this shit
When I got on, they was on superficial fake shit
Fake wigs, fake nails, fake ass, fake tits
I done came to bring the real, now they copy pastin'
Wait bitch, keep it simple, never basic
Way that I was getting snubbed, you would think they racist
Tank shit taught me be a shark
Play this rap game for what it's worth
Switch it up and bank quick, so here we go

[Hook: G-Eazy and Snow Tha Product]
They used to tell me
I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone)
They used to always say
I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone)
But now I'm here, bitch!
But now I'm here, bitch![Intro: Daenerys]
Do you understand I'm no ordinary woman?
My dreams come true

[Verse 1]
I've been marginalized, I've been obliged
To succumb to come to the politics, swallow my pride
I been in the offering by all of these guys
Try walk, I get the brought down to size
Why am I constantly questioned
If inevitably I'm destined to take what we know as my life
That's the life on the throne and a life I should own
Only people that standing would be on my side
I've been up for this long and ain't slept
I've been here, I've been gone with no rest
And I'll take that, take this and take them
Taking no stepbacks, we'll make shit a movement
There ain't no rest out, I'll be taking to allignment
And ain't no example, no tempering, I will win
But I bet that betting will begin by a measly small, frail woman
Now they see me, but I will summon
But to me it's fire like hell's coming

[Verse 2]
In a world where a girl isn't much
I got the fire that none of y'all gonna touch
I've built an army, I've been all in the cut
I've moved along
I've worked as hard as the toughest men involved in all the darkness
Of blood so [?] the swords were drawn at the cusp
But oppurtunity risen between broken trust
And an obsene scene of deep greed and lust
And I've seen the injust'
Then they told me to cut the chains, leashes up
And that's reason enough
And I will take that, take this and take them
Where the rest at there won't be next of kin
If you don't step back, step down, I'm convinced
I don't wanna kill, but I bet I will for the win
What I built isn't it, gather a milion men
It's a man's world 'til a girl works hard as him
When I begin and thoughts come in, stick it to them again
I can guarantee no one fighting me is gonna live
