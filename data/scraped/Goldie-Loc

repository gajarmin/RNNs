[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yo what's Crip-a-lat'n, this big Snoop Dogg
Leave your name and your number at the motherfucking beep
If this one of my hoes, two-way me

[Dr. Dre]
Ay ay Snoop whattup, this your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

[Snoop Dogg]
Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

[Butch Cassidy]
Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

[Goldie Loc]
Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

[Tray Deee]
Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

[Master P]
Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me cause I'm a million dolla hitta
It's, No Limit til I D-I-E
C-P-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

[Hook][Hook]
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water

[Verse 1: E-40]
Narcotics vision of death merchant, shipping and handling yola I supply

Yeah, I only gotta' couple of pies left that'll last me through the year
Yolla, (ewwww!) ice cream candy (What it do?)

(Ewwww!) It's real walkie talkie (What else?)
I got that from the DB's, my cousin.. work dirty!
If you want 'em I got 'em; you here for the cop, you'd better be about your grip
Devour any cowards, sours slippery at the lip
Beast, don't suck up to none, don't be no sucker
Be a block monster, be a reputable motherfucker
Real mannish with my Spanish
If ain't about no gouda, partner you can vanish
Don't get put up in yo' place
Give me 40 feet and an ounce of space

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now-A-Later's, gum drops, jelly beans
Lollipops and triple beams
Blue carpet, yeah that's the treatment
Candy so sweet, got everybody eatin it
Bigg Snoop Dogg, I'm the star of this
So gone on and get yourself a bar of this
No change man.. gimme the bucks
The kinda candy I sell they call it deez nutz
(Deez nuts!) I'm almond with the caramel insides
European front end with the french fries
How it feel man? What it look like?
I'm in your neighborhood, pullin on some Bud Light
Sweet and sticky, take it out the wrapper
Now put it in your mouth
To the beat of the drum, it'll be fun
And I bet you can't just eat one (Candy!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm in the hood with the six-trey candy paint
Lil' somethin to chunk, make the hoes all faint
If you know when to beep, jump my baby rate
When I grip round her butt, I hold her steady
G-yeah.. she my one and only
Quick to keep back haters who don't know me
I... feel... good about candy (Candy!)
My gangstas understand me

[Verse 4: Goldie Loc]
Shake it baby, don't break it baby, now can you make it clap? (clap!)
Tryna fit this work in your gap (gap!)
Drop it like it water pagoda, get my hustle on
I get it from you then I step on you to bubble on
It's gettin sweeter than a sugar cane
Here come that sugar daddy, black, rollin on gold thangs
Fo'shigiddy, he turned it into somethin, boy
Cause I can't leave this filthy game without my Almond Joy (Candy!)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Daz Dillinger]
"It's like candy, candy!"
Get it how you want it
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner
Voila, taadow, check out this bizarre
The D-A-T the N-I double G, the D-A-Z
Again it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for shit
God damn! You already know who I am
Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches
Hit the gas, hit the brake, y'all really burn rubber?
Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip!

[Verse 6: Kurupt]
Yeah, nigga.. shot caller
It's America's number one baller
Man I don't give a fuck.. like, "Fuck it"

And G'z stompin' on niggas like parades
Escapades and charades played
When the stampede stopped
And it continuously Young Gotti
Seen so many bodies
Drop fours hop classics and drastic measures
Principle's a pleasure and penal endeavours
Whatever the case, whatever case, it's caught on a chase
When a chase, it began in the facial of race
Me and Fred, he make beats, I make rhymes
And Snoop, he controls and calculates
Impervious moves, the Pound Pentagon
Wit a pistols, I holla where the gangstas' at
Daz poppin' his coller, nigga sweet and sour

Once upon a time not long ago

And all the fly tricks say they'd die for me
Cause I was raised in the hood as a little ass G

Here's my thang trick, now you know what you're facing
And now that's how I greet'em, I treat'em, like bomb mixes major
Hold them on the hip like a mother fuckin' rager
But it feels real good to be single
When I hit the bomb clubs all it does do is mingle
Pass the hooch to me
Better pass it right back
I'm not gonna lock it down cause it ain't about that
But for a second she gotta see my spoon coon
With me she better be ready for swinging fatter than chrome so zoom
It might be the day that she wakes up
And realize that I got the girl shook up

(Snoop chorus)
Now I have fucked one million ho's
And I have done bout a million shows
I gotta bout a million dollars in gold
While I'm dippin' with the homie Goldie Loc lets roll

Cause I know it screw ya, ya try up do us
But you can't cause you lovin' this beat
Uh, uh... we dump, dump to make you pump, pump

Freddy said he had a whole a gritty down to go steady
And stick up Eddie for his fedy and bring it all back to daddy
I want bread, cheese now put it on the patty
Knick Knack style, kick back and flip files
In the verge, on now listen now honey child
Bow Wow, do ya now, how ya like it doggystyle?
Smile and grinnin', sippin' on some gin'n
Roll wit a cap and ya all strapped in
Once ya back in, it's straight mackin'

[Hook - 4x]
This is how we all get down
Bring back that "G" shit fo' me!

[Snoop Dogg]
I know I slept you, kept ya, fin'na fetch ya
Snatch ya back too, slapped you and rapped too
The vacuum sat 'chu and rat packed you, act two
Now what must I do, to get you back
To the way is used to see, D-P-G-C'ology
I'm not talkin' 'bout chemistry or biology
This "G"'ology, you feelin' me
Niggas be killin' me and willin' me
Silly he, thinkin' y'all gon' smash on me
Blast on me, the audacity
I'll take ya back to the ol' skool and let ya cut class wit me
Get some ass wit me
Then get us somethin' to drink and let you sip out the same glass as me
And now you a killa
And it was all over weed and a tall can of milla, illa
Kill a nigga like a flea
Bigg Snoopy D-O double gizzle
Way off tha hizzle my nizzle

[Goldie Loc]
I hit niggas and bitches if you fuck wit my mental
Cause I'm a killa and stick release ya pop like a pimple
If you don't got my money I suggest you run
Cause the Gold Loc, he do you like a 20 or done
Ain't no fun the way I play, nigga I plays fo' keeps
No details you've just been sweeped to sweep
Locations, directions, not even a trace
Bitch I doubt it, if ya body get found like waste
In the alley, killa Cali, this Eastsidaz Crips
Never slip, set trip, and smoke chronic dip
Cuz!

[Hook -4x]

[Traci Nelson]

[Fred Durst]
Hey![Hook]
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
(Repeat x8)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Narcotics vision of death merchant, shipping and handling yola I supply
Time to get up and wipe the eye boogers out my eye (out my eye!)
Whatchu try'na buy, pimpin? y'know it's kinda' dry here
Yeah, I only gotta' couple of pies left that'll last me through the year
Yolla, (ewwww!) ice cream candy (What it do?)
Man that shit be comin in handy
(Ewwww!) It's real walkie talkie (What else?)
I got that from the DB's, my cousin.. work dirty!
If you want 'em I got 'em; you here for the cop, you'd better be about your grip
Devour any cowards, sours slippery at the lip
Beast, don't suck up to none, don't be no sucker
Be a block monster, be a reputable motherfucker
Real mannish with my Spanish
If ain't about no gouda, partner you can vanish
Don't get put up in yo' place
Give me 40 feet and an ounce of space

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now-A-Later's, gum drops, jelly beans
Lollipops and triple beams
Blue carpet, yeah that's the treatment
Candy so sweet, got everybody eatin it
Bigg Snoop Dogg, I'm the star of this
So gone on and get yourself a bar of this
No change man.. gimme the bucks
The kinda candy I sell they call it deez nutz
(Deez nuts!) I'm almond with the caramel insides
European front end with the french fries
How it feel man? What it look like?
I'm in your neighborhood, pullin on some Bud Light
Sweet and sticky, take it out the wrapper
Now put it in your mouth
To the beat of the drum, it'll be fun
And I bet you can't just eat one (Candy!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm in the hood with the six-trey candy paint
Lil' somethin to chunk, make the hoes all faint
If you know when to beep, jump my baby rate
When I grip round her butt, I hold her steady
G-yeah.. she my one and only
Quick to keep back haters who don't know me
I... feel... good about candy (Candy!)
My gangstas understand me

[Verse 4: Goldie Loc]
Shake it baby, don't break it baby, now can you make it clap? (clap!)
Tryna fit this work in your gap (gap!)
Drop it like it water pagoda, get my hustle on
I get it from you then I step on you to bubble on
It's gettin sweeter than a sugar cane
Here come that sugar daddy, black, rollin on gold thangs
Fo'shigiddy, he turned it into somethin, boy
Cause I can't leave this filthy game without my Almond Joy (Candy!)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Daz Dillinger]
"It's like candy, candy!"
Get it how you want it
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner
Voila, taadow, check out this bizarre
The D-A-T the N-I double G, the D-A-Z
Again it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for shit
God damn! You already know who I am
Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches
Hit the gas, hit the brake, y'all really burn rubber?
Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip!

[Verse 6: Kurupt]
Yeah, nigga.. shot caller
It's America's number one baller
Man I don't give a fuck.. like, "Fuck it"
Hi...bye.. slide in the bucket
Little momma all up on a nigga like a coat
I got the perfect thang that'll coat her throat (Candy!)

[Hook][Verse 1]
Gritty grimy shit
Slumpin in my Chevrolet
Cause I can't listen to that Techno music all day (Hell Na)
So I'm Dubsteppin'
Never leave the house without Smith & Wesson
It's gonna be a bloody mess if you fuck with me
And I put that on East Side LBC
C'mon now, catch me puffin on that devil stick
You don't wanna see me black out so don't say shit
Black ski mask with them leather OJ Simpson gloves
Choke the DJ out if he dont bang this shit up in the club

[Hook x 4]
C'mon now
Let's go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, talkin that shit will get you scraped up
Bleeding on the ground for the coroner to scoop you up
Bullets move like Mayweather, quick and fast
Better button up those lips before these hollow tips snap that ass
I've been waiting for a silly war to pop off
Now everybody walk around with them sawed-offs
The Holocaust is back
There's no speakers in my trunk
It's dead bodies in my Cadillac

[Hook]

The hood like a cemetery
Tombstones everywhere
No flowers, black gates
Like the desert brown air

Yo, it's Waniac, the maniac, Trip Loc won't you spit that rap

Holla at my folks I know up in the complex
Nigga ready to ride as soon as he get dressed
Now we ready to roll, hit the store, then the carpool lane

Swoopin to some Soopafly, gettin my smoke on
Nigga Goldie Loc got the heat on roast it
4 Tay on the way plus the twins is posted
Bout to set it off bet it's off the hook
Straight crooks, gettin money off the books
Makin nothin but that gangsta shit that niggas lovin
Thuggin at the house party, fuck goin clubbin

[2nd Hook]

[Goldie Loc]
Let me hear you say pimps, banks, hustlers

Ice skatin over dicthes

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

[Snoop Dogg]
Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

[Butch Cassidy]
Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

[Goldie Loc]
Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

[Tray Deee]
Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

[Master P]
Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me cause I'm a million dolla hitta
It's, No Limit til I D-I-E
C-P-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

[Hook]Once upon a time not long ago
When gangsta's sported gats and smoked dope dope
And all the fly tricks say they'd die for me
Cause I was raised in the hood as a little ass G

Once upon a time not long ago
When gangsta's sported gats and smoked dope dope
And all the fly tricks say they'd die for me
Cause I was raised in the hood as a little ass G

Twos, fours, hoochs and shows
These tricks only trickin with them real g dogs
Toutin' up on all the brothers insizignt
She never had chippers on me, She chipped in on my cadilliac
I see cat with the bomb you can sniff appreciate
When I get your ass just like a gift, trick sniff, sniff
Hold up your spine
Now you better have my motherfuckin' tip o'nine
Like playin' on meditate so what's this pimp sayin'
I said that thing between your legs gots those tricks playin'
You think I'm some kinda sugar daddy
Next time we'll do it your ass on all the homies having daddies

(Snoop chorus)
Now I have touched one million flows
And I have done about a million shows
I'm tryin' to get about a million dollars in gold
While I'm dippin' with the homie Goldie Loc let's roll

Chickies these days be bootin' a whole lot
Messin' around get got
Pimpin' and never stop
No hope because she won't trust me
I'm little Goldie D and I'll be out for the money, money, money

But when I see something strange, I change the situation
Here's my thang trick, now you know what you're facing
And now that's how I greet'em, I treat'em, like bomb mixes major
Hold them on the hip like a mother fuckin' rager
But it feels real good to be single
When I hit the bomb clubs all it does do is mingle
Pass the hooch to me
Better pass it right back
I'm not gonna lock it down cause it ain't about that
But for a second she gotta see my spoon coon
With me she better be ready for swinging fatter than chrome so zoom
It might be the day that she wakes up
And realize that I got the girl shook up

(Snoop chorus)
Now I have fucked one million ho's
And I have done bout a million shows
I gotta bout a million dollars in gold
While I'm dippin' with the homie Goldie Loc lets roll

(voiceover)
I hear you little Goldie Loc. Sorry if I'm homie
Let'em know we don't play on the Eastside
But Dogg what's happenin' with these broads talking about bills, bills, bills
Callin us grugs and all that homie

(Snoop)
Honey child you need to chizill
I ain't payin' your biznill, on the riznill
Niggers out there from the L.B.C. Northside, Northside up
All the homies from the Westside. Westside up
Ain't no Southside Long Beach niggers
There's only Eastside. Eastside up... Eastsidaz
This is how we doing it ya'll. Dogghouse
You didn't know. You do now
We outa this biotch. You know the rest

(Snoop chorus)
Well, well ya'll push me to the limit now its time to sail
But when the ship sails there won't be no ho's again
But as for right now I like the way you sound
Cause you're putting it down
So all you ho's out as soon as it hits the streets[Verse 1: Defari]
Take a chance, come dance with a cowboy
Playin stopped playing long time ago with childish toys
It's only men in here; deuce deuce inch Pirelli
And Goodyear niggas, sip malt liquor beer
They gave me sixth man of the year, came off the bench for Tha Liks
Shot the lights out at the championship
Big chips, big trips, new fits, my money clip's
Full of green cheese, my other pocket got green weed
Rap niggers, we different individuals
Elevate the level of the music and the visuals
It's do or die, I need a Priest, call Soopafly
Whatever we discuss when we meet's between you and I
I'm truly high, red-eyed for the red-eye flight
Five hours, eight drinks, I rode all night, shit
Everyday, every night's a saloon
Crime blitty, good bottle, million dollar tunes

[Hook: Kokane]
Love when when you're out there on the ave
When you're down 24/7, niggers don't know the half
My Romeo's step down on the pedal
My back keeps on scraping the metal
I be coasting and be coasting, hitting three wheel motion
With my rimz and tirez

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
I ain't never seen Kevlar flesh (hell naw)
Y'all bitch niggers is flirting and fuckin with death
I was taught to stick with the right and work with the left
Never love nothing, never turn snitch and confess
Gotta catch me in the heat of the act, and run the risk
Of catchin three to the back, and try walking with that (yeah!)
I ain't goin to the pimp for shit, except to snatch up
My loved ones to get loose and hop the fence
It ain't hard to look hard, snatch up a catalogue
Mad dog to niggers that walk up your boulevard (yeah!)
But one day, you gon' feel it (what?)
I'm a firm believer in the theory if it bleeds, I can kill it
A hit man for hire (yeah!) caught up in the crossfire
The live wire, leak a nigger like a vampire
My empire roll rimz and tirez
Either get with us, forget us and get behind us, motherfucker

[Hook]

Ride along, with my rimz and tirez
Side along

[Verse 3: Goldie Loc]
Mr. Recycler (what?) I'm looking for a sixty-two Chevy
And she kinda bad, threw him six and I was ready
(Whatchu want me to do?) To get spic and span
Man I'm glad you came and got me from that old white man (good looking)
He took me to a spot in Long Beach, hooked me up with four pumps
(bzzt) but everybody in the hood can't jump (bzzt)
And I change colors when the sun hit me
Fix me up, now my owner wanna slang me for 50?
Bling bling, now I belong to a Japanese
And they was quick to throw me in the magazines
I make money (huh?) I never broke down, fools tripping
(Check it out) How many cars you see in Seoul on streets dipping?
(None) Afraid to get that ass caught slipping (why?)
For me it was an easy task
I kept an engine on my ass with heat under the dash
Fool (peep game) I was born to low ride on rimz and tirez, yeah

[Hook][Snoop Dogg:]
My goodness my gracious shell toe Adidas with the fat blue laces
Hand full of aces trumped up dump trunk white wall paces
Drink til you drop motherfucker cop
Old English 800 on the block
Way before St. Ide's came to the spot
Niggas used to hang out and do the pop lock
And if we got into some shit we never pop shots
We'd squab scrap whatever it was
And live to talk about it and we get old cause
And keep a pack of zig zags for that good old bud
We do a house party what the fuck is a club
And the ese's they sold most of the drugs
La familia hell and [?]
We get money yeah and we do low ride
Represent it and talk nope no not I
That's the code in every hood that you roam
Fastest way to catch a hot slug in your dome
O.G. the place that I call home
Black Lac like that and it's sitting on chrome
Plaque in back strap in Lac
Antennas wake you up for a rat trying to set a new trap
Swinging the track dripping curl juice on your back
Breaking hearts like Roger and Zapp motherfucker

[Bootsy Collins:]
Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her
Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer
Pound for pound we were the baddest in town
You just had to get up for the get down
Some say we the next generation
But we lack education

[Goldie Loc:]
[?] drinking mad dog 20/20
Silver satin blue Kool Aid sagging in my Dickies
I got my loccs on sailing through my neighborhood
Catch you slipping on them bricks it ain't all good
Front door kicker Glock spitter
Black and gold flag across my face when I get you
3 wheeler tipping turning up the Alpine
[?] while I listen to the grapevine
[?] blue Crips all by the front door
East side rip riding gang banging all I know
Heart break hotel hush puppy neck kicker
I grew up on that crazy one five nigga
If you locc from my block then hop something
And I ain't talking bout no peel nigga block hunting
Blue corduroys while I'm talking on my brick phone
14 years old had to bring the shit home
My uncle Sugar Bear showed me how to bag it up
Look at the block now nigga it's sewed up
I ain't playing with you old grand pubas
Peace out Rolando ran things with no [?]
Now take a picture of this 8 ball sipper
Look down at my shoes blue strings nigga
Goldie Loc will keep this motherfucker crack-a-lackin
The only thing I wanna hear is gang bang rapping

[Bootsy Collins:]
Some say we the next generation
But we lack education
Hanging with the crew of devastation
Yeah but we one nation mama
Tally-ho and away we go
See you next week with a brand new show
When you funk around here ain't nothing consensual
You know I funk so hard you gonna need your parent's credential
Now I'm in the street cause I lost my sheep
But now I know where to find that
Now how cool is cold when you're trying to compete
Standing next to me son you better take a seat
Can't none of you cut throats funk like me
You better check with Snoop Dogg and get your pedigree
Why oh why do I think like that
If I am with the dog you must be a cat
Now tally-ho and away we go
See you next week with a brand new show
I want the bomb I want that O.G. back
There's a party going on in my head
While I think about the blood that we shed
Then party uh when the player play
There's a party going on up in here

Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her
Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer
Pound for pound we were the baddest in town
You just had to get up for the get down
Some say we the next generation
But we lack education
Hanging with the crew of devastation
Yeah but we one nation mama
Hanging with the Snoopatronics bobba[Snoop Dogg]

Mama gon bring it first class a ten every smoke session
Wit protection for every nigga that smile

My crew penetrate commison chin checkin
We split wigs in split seconds if you know what you workin wit
I'm lookin for a thug nigga wit on some 'xotic shit
If he ain't got the potential for gettin paid to keep paper
Then ain't no need to chase him a game force game
Never let the legs spread, I see he got it all in his head
Fuck fuckin in the bed
Two broke muthafuckas can't break bed
Intimidated cause my game is on lock and its crump tight

[Chorus:1x]

[Verse 2-Conyiac&Kola]

[Kola]
Haters let ya jaws rest, wettin up all chest

Beyond the baddest bitch we boss on brutal tactics
Eliminate the additics, heat em leavin em cravit

(We ain't givin a pass unless the floss cash)

[Kola]

[Bad Azz]
I'm so proper - I came up like a liqour store robber
I'm so L.A., like the Dodgers or the Lakers
Man I put money on players
On the corner, with the Mayor of Pomona
So break down, bitch, in a serious fashion
If the pimpin' don't kill you than I'm forced to blast ya
It's a paper thang, it ain't about the pussy and dick
It's the difference between you walkin' and you pushin' a whip
See it's a major type of paper, caper, motivator, playa, neighbor
Haters hate us, I don't give a fuck if you don't play this later
I'm to the strip, I gotta check my money makers

[Snoop Dogg]
Do it to 'em now and save some for later

[Hook]
Dogghouse niggas, we ridaz
We always got a car load of bitches beside us
You punk motherfuckers wanna try and divide us
The homies on deck with the heaters behind us
Wide up, so bonafied up
This ain't that same ol' shit you get tired of
The heat for the street from the best suppliers
(West and Eastside up, Eastsidaz)

[Suga Free]
You might not ever get rich...
So you might as well go ahead and bust you a bitch...
Nigga, now if I hang around nine squares (I would be the dif')
And if I hang around nine fools feelin' loose (I would be the dif')
But if I hang around nine projects a mile (I would be the dif')
And if I hang around nine rich business men (I would be the dif')

Now if I had wings - I'd fly
And if if was a fifth - I'll be alright
It ain't so sippin' in my pimpin'
(They don't know)
We got them regulars trickin'
(We got it crackin' on the stroll)
And I know sometime when I pee I forget to lift the seat
But she don't cook, clean, cash every night, and her hair's always neat
Nah nah, get gone
Don't forget to remind me to whoop your motherfuckin' ass as soon as we get home

[Hook]
Dogghouse niggas, we ridaz
We always got a car load of bitches beside us
You punk motherfuckers wanna try and divide us
The homies on deck with the heaters behind us
Wide up, so bonafied up
This ain't that same ol' shit you get tired of
The heat for the street from the best suppliers
(West and Eastside up, Eastsidaz)

[Goldie Loc]
Now this is dedicated to hoo-bangin', slangin'
Catch heat from this motherfuckin' dirty rap game
I won't tell you nothin', that you might have been told
I won't sell you nothin', that you might have had bought
Just fuck wit cha nigga cause I stay low gold
Quick to blast moms and pops and the dog To-to
You don't know me nigga, so keep my name out your grill
If I see you on the streets I'm just gon' keep it way real
They know again, keepin' that shit gangsta cuhz
I got my head on straight, with my brain on buzz
Trust a slug, when it slip the AK's flip
Squeezin' on the trigger yellin' Rollin' 20 Crip
Walkin' through the shadow of death, I see my shadow on my left
Grip tight with the heat on my right
Will I make it through these fucked up situations?
I'm headed to Dogghouse, so D's paper chasin' (motherfucker)

[Hook]
Dogghouse niggas, we ridaz
We always got a car load of bitches beside us
You punk motherfuckers wanna try and divide us
The homies on deck with the heaters behind us
Wide up, so bonafied up
This ain't that same ol' shit you get tired of
The heat for the street from the best suppliers
(West and Eastside up, Eastsidaz)

And hidin in trees, to escape the mic that I breathe on
Bleed on, exceed on!
Weak rappers with titles after twelve
Hit a bell that's what I'll feed on!
Microphone Don, walkin flesh, talkin bomb
Bringin harm, to the calm, and, them be alarmed
It's the African, oh, you wanna battle again?
I'll turn, you and your mans, to my yesterday plans
Oh damn, totin two pistols like Yosemite Sam
Old man be grand, loud as the Southern band
Pickups and caravans, the soldier, that could, that can

Droppin the heat, lock up the street, we 'posed to

HOOK[Intro]
It’s your boy, big Snoop D-O-double G,got a couple a my homeboys wit me right now
And we wanna holla at the ladies, not you fool
Oh, that’s your girl, well let me know
Or maybe not, or let her know
What else (what else, what else, yea, what else)

[Verse 1]
What else could I say, what else could I do, if she keep looking my way
Smoking on the bombs, I don’t drink the Henl like I used to
Plus I’m more calm, aged she grown to center stage, front page
It’s been written all over your body and all over your face
You for me,it’s me for you, it’s true
What u tryna do,what u tryna get into
There is just so many different things I can see that you into, soft and gentle
Someone that a nigga like me could get into
She been through similar things that I’ve been through
What you wanna do, wanna do
Just a little to get you, a  little bit closer so I could paint you a picture
I can keep the bubble popping, if you add to the mixture
And just

[Chorus]
Let me know (let me know), if you want you can leave with me
Let him know, that you wanna be with me
Let us go, so we can get this z, in between the sheets

[Verse 2]
Let me know so I can scoop you up and ride out
So I can show you what just one night stand about
I’m gonna get up in em sheets like Ron Isley
Freaky sideki, I love when you surprise me
You ain’t into all that club hopping
We headin straight to my yacht, lil mama to get it poppin
All that ass baby girl,let’s make it crackalay
Smellin like grapes, I’m gonna mate like apes
So seductive, you ma lil pumpkin
Then I can’t go 5 minutes without us humping
You can be with me, just constantly be ma freak
So we can get to sweatin in em satin sheets
All this time on our hands, we gotta twerk som’n
Cause I been patiently waiting, to hurt som’n
Sexy thing, this our secret location
We can always meet up an exchange sex faces

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The moment the bill in, yea dollars go spend
A couple a thug niggas, sippy cups in hand
And a couple a jealous eyes, ain’t no surprise
She figures she can hit me, wit a couple of lies
Hold up, what your nigga got to do wit me?
Slide me the church, yea so easy
Heading back to the circle with a couple of girls
Making sure I see that ass do a couple a twirls
Couple a more sips, now you’re back in ma face
Watching you so hard, nigga tryna give chase
I ain’t playin no tug-a-war, now what you here for?
What’s keeping the dirty looks, all on the dance floor
Let me know
Let me know fast, your drunk ass want, or let me go
Really though, you need to make up your mind
Cause the nigga that you with make you decline

[Chorus][Intro: Silkk the Shocker + (Snoop Dogg)]
Hey yo Snoop
Tell Xzibit and Dre to be havin' that thing bumpin' when I come out there

(That's funky Soopafly..
Big Snoop Dogg  {Snoop Dogg!}
Silkk the Shocker
Ain't No Limit to this
2000
Gangsta shit
West West ya'll)

It's my second home...
Snoop tell 'em what's up

[Snoop Dogg]
The gangstas bang, do that damn thang
Me and my nephew, Dogghouse keep it true
Roll that weed - pass that drank
Holla at your nigga, baby bring your thang
You could shake what you got, get your pussy real hot
Jump in the 'gator we could slide to my speezot
Just keep it on leezy, I know it ain't easy
You bucket mouth breezy
Silkk this bitch cute, thick and all that (damn)
"Why must I, chase the cat"
If you was me (me), and I was you (you)
You'd probably floss on a nigga
Burnin' rubber in a 52
Most bitches do, and most niggas do too
In the land where it's all about the red and blue
But me - I'd rather get the greenery
And smoke out the whole motherfuckin' scenary

[Chorus]
Pop lockin' in my Rolls Royce, Cadillac
Lincoln and Mercedes Benz
Pop lockin' at the Howard Johnson, the Sheraton
Pop lockin' at the Holiday Inn
Pop lockin' in my Rolls Royce, Cadillac
Lincoln and Mercedes Benz
Pop lockin' at the Howard Johnson, the Sheraton
Pop lockin' with all my friends

It's that West Coast way we're livin'
(Money, cars, weed, bitches)
It's that West Coast way we're livin'
(From the South to the West)
It's that West Coast way we're livin'
(Money, cars, weed, bitches)
It's that West Coast way we're livin'

[Goldie Loc]
Why must I, be like that
With them ???? tux, draped in all black
Takin' back like the pop lockin' ???? gold suits
Bangin' back in the day just to get a lil' jucie
Fuck the trus'
Cause we can get Cripped out crazy
Blast on all you suckas, went to throw away 380
Fuck around get found up in a dumpster somewhere
Cause them Southside-Eastside gangstaz don't care
Nigga I won't, fool you don't (know you don't)
He fuckin' with no niggas more gangsta than me
Tell him the truth loc
120 proof outs the sun roof
Throwin' up the motherfuckin' ????
Tru Tank Doggs fuckin' with Bigg Snoop Dogg
Soopafly to keep them high so they could come out there draws
What you player hatin' perpitrator niggas make me mad
So I'm mad off you suckas and my pants never sag

[Chorus]

[Silkk the Shocker]
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, you know who we bring
No Limit and Dogghouse, ain't nothin' but a G thang
You know, we think to win
Y'all think money's soft, nah y'all better think again
Cause if ain't about money, then why would I bother?
If she ain't keepin' it real, then why would I holla?
Til' she come swim by the crib with the house, come with the lake
Eat as much as you want to as long as you know what come with the plate
On my lap a fo' five, in the trunk - keep a K
In the deck P, Snoop, Biggie, Pac, fool just keep up Dre
And the heat I got on me, always gotta ride with it
I don't spend money, fool I spend money cause I can - die with it
Project nigga, huh, get my work on
Host MTV with a Eastsidaz shirt on
Ghetto like that, you know how we live
On the East it's 6 feet, on the West it's 3 wheels

[Chorus]


[Outro: Silkk the Shocker]
Soopafly, No Limit
My nigga Xzibit, Bad Azz, Eastsidaz Gang
Doggy's Angels, Dogg Pound, and Damian Young
Cube, Westside, my nigga Marv, what up Eminem?

Somebody stop me cause I'm makin' too much noise down the runway
Swervin' cracked the sun roof, let them hear this .38 (*Gun Shots*)
The streets is gettin' bigger and thicker
To be exact my nigga, they want us out to picture (*Gun cocked*)

Bend your back to get rain up in
Take the dick with the Gin, then turn back in the friends (*Gun cocked*)

[Snoop Dogg]
We do break hoes
We don't fuck with fake hoes
Yeah, we make hoes
Strip down to they panty hose
Pop your whip, now grab that bitch
Pimping Snoop ain't having it
Oh you like pussy, congratulations
I'm trying to get your ass in my congregations
I keep three hoes in my room at one time
Two nickels and the other's a dime
You wouldn't wanna, keep a hood on her
When I'm dropping that motherfucking wood on her
Cause I perform, a G like Warren
A nigga getting paid off shooting porn
They call me the black folks President
Snoop Heffner mixed with a little bit of Doggy Flint
Banging this parliament, come get a bar with this
You would wanna be a part of this, oh bitch ass nigga
Quit playing with the ho, and let me borrow the bitch

[Hook: Charlie Wilson]
You got what I want
Tell me if you want, just what I want
Cause I got, what you need
Baby if you need some, get it from me
Cause I got, what you want
I want you to want, just what I want
Just want, what I want
Ooh you got just what I want

[Goldie Loc]
Look mama make you hot like a corn to pop
And watch how fast you see a nigga boxers drop
I'm trying to work it fast, but I know you like it slow
You know I got to bust a nut and hurry up and go
You got something that I want right now
Hurry up and let me put the black spot on the cow
Make the pussy ball up like salt to a snail
And when I kill it big daddy, I want you to tell
Cause I don't give a damn when it come to freaking hoes
Call up forty hoes, and have a rolly peep show
And when you give me something, you gone want something back
This dick to your mouth, little mama like that
Fish cost too much, so I feed her sardines
Man I'm the motherfucking MVP of the team
Cold game how a nigga steady spitting this shit
Make her mama jump back and say bitch is a pimp

[Hook]

[Charlie Wilson]
Of course she love my nine
Bitch I got that antidote
Got a bigger dick that'll crack your spine
Then I'm gonna let it inside your throat

[Ludacris]
Tricked out, kicked out get her on gone
Ludacris on the motherfucking microphone
Heey, what's up I came to pimp
Fur hats and fur clothes, time to raise the temp
Biiiiatch, I got it made
Just pick one of my hoes, and I got it laid
You never heard as many bitches so fast and frequent
"Can I get the ends?" Is this bitch delinquent?
Run my bath water, cook my meals
And SHUT THE FUCK UP, when I book the deals
And iron my draws, give me cuffs and creases
It's your nephew come to fuck your nieces

[Hook - 2x]

Gimme what I want
I got what you need
Gimme what I want
Yeah, yeah
