[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Uh yeah, Bad Boy baby
Biggie Smalls
Listen...

[Pre-Hook: Ralph Tresvant]
Uh yeah baby oooooooh, listen to me, oh yeaaaah

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the EP along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or boy-skinned or black, baby I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' "Ay papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin' mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

[Hook: Ralph Tresvant]
What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Bitches screamin' they want that old thing back
Like B I Double G I E
With some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known to bustin' in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love and hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to come the ghetto is crazy
How come you ain't, your sis make semi your faces
When I come you be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches
Knows when picture in the camera rollin
Cause I only be knowin' how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left
It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Shit...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
Is my mind playin' tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin' nightmares of girls killin' me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin' rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase em, I replace em
And if I'm caressin' em, I'm undressin' em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin' fantasies without that nigga Mr. Walk
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin' for an intermission
Fuck the kissin', lickin' down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me B.I.G. for nuttin, all of a sudden

[Hook]

[Puff Daddy: Outro]
Biggie Smalls
P. Diddy y'all
Bad Boy for life
Once again going to the top baby[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse, if I was broke would you want me
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
Bitches kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a eight-figga nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a baller so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

[Refrain]
Can I get a fuck you
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough

[Amil]
Can I get a woop woop
To these niggas from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggas without dubs

[Jay-Z]
Now will you bounce with me bounce with me
Bounce bitch, bounce

[Verse 2: Amil]
You ain't gotta be rich but fuck that
How we gonna get around on your bus pass
Before I put this pussy on your mustache, can you afford me
My niggas breadwinners, never corny
Ambition makes me so horny
Not the fussin' and the frontin'
If you got nothing, baby boy, you better
Get up, get out and get some, shit
I like a - lot of Prada, Alize and vodka
Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up
Get it up I put it down everytime it pop up, huh
I got to snap 'em, let it loose, then I knock ya
Feel the juice, then I got ya - when you produce a rock
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa
My - coochie remains in a Gucci name
Never test my patience, nigga, I'm high maintenance
High class, if you ain't rollin', bypass
If you ain't holdin' I dash yo

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
It ain't even a question
How my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes
Like my puss wet like damp clothes
What y'all niggas don't know: it's easy to pimp a ho
Bitches better have my money fo sho
Before they go runnin' they mouth, promotin' how
I be dickin' they back out, go 'head, let it out
I fucks with my Gat out, bounce and leave a hundred
Makin em feel, slutted even if they don't want it
It's been so long, since I met a chick ain't about chips but then I'm
Dead wrong, when I tell em, "be gone"
So hold on to the feelin' of flossin' and plat-num
Cause from now on
You can witness Ja the i-con
With hoodies and Timbs on, cause I thugs my bitches
VV studs my bitches, then we rob bitch niggas
I'm talkin' bout straight figures, if you here, you with us
If not Boo, you know what, I still fucked you(Ja Rule)
Where would I be without my baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

(Ja Rule)
Girl it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a, part of me
Mind body and soul ain't no I in we (baby)
When you cry who wipes your tears
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin to fear
Girl I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on, your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to
See Jacob's and frost your wrist up
Now you owe me, I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

[Hook 2X: Ja Rule]
Where would I be without you (uh)
I only think about you (yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (lonely)
So baby girl put it on me (put it on me)

(Vita)
Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy put it on me

[Hook]

(Ja Rule)
Since we met it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon cry
If you leave me lonely
Cuz you not just my love you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love
I'm outta control hold me, my love
Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
Cause every thug needs a lady (yeah, yeah)
I feel you baby cause them eyes ain't lying
Wash away all the tears there be no more crying (baby)
And you complete me, and I would die if you ain't wit me
So baby girl put it on me

[Hook] - 2X[Intro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call (Buckshots, ha), always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

[Hook: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Hook: Ashanti]

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Hook: Ashanti]

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

[Hook: Ashanti]

[Outro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

[Radio Announcer]
Here at W-I-Z, we play nothing but the hits, nothing but the hits
Nothing but the motherfucking hitsHaha, yeah
Whattup ma? How you been
Yeah I know, I know, hehe
It's all good.. (Murder Inc.)

[Hook: Ja Rule] + (Ashanti)
Girl your stare, those eyes I (love it when you look at me baby)
Your lips, your smile I (love it when you kiss me baby)
Your hips, those thighs I (love it when you call me baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm witchu baby)

[Ja Rule]
I, got a fetish for fuckin you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin so long? I'm gettin anxious
But patiently waitin for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin to G you, ma I'm tryin to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin the dick game is potent
Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin, lovin the way you be moanin
Grippin the sheets, lookin at me lickin at me
Cause every woman just wanna be happy
And it's CRA-ZAY, but BAY-BAY, I.. (love it when I'm witchu baby)

[Hook]

[Ashanti]
I wanna get away, cause you know like I know
And there's a better day, a-comin, I'm hooked on your lovin
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin
Like when we kissin - bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll - ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me baby

[Hook]

[Ja Rule] + (Ashanti)
Shorty, are you really gettin bored with me, or him?
Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
(But then again I'm still young and I'm livin my life)
You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your bumper
(BABY, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)

[Ashanti] + (Ja Rule)
{*harmonizes*}
You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
(It's a man's world, but I understand)
But there's still nothin different boy, stick to the plan
(You be my down ass, witcha round ass)
I know I'm feelin you (like you feelin me)
The way you're holdin my body, the way you touch me

[Hook]

[Ashanti: repeat 2X]
I love when you touch me baby
All over my body baby
I love when you kiss me baby
All over my body baby

[Hook][Hook - Ja Rule]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits next time if you talk (you talk)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits next time if you talk (you talk)
(And I know)

[Verse 1 - Ja Rule]
Y'all niggas is pussy, punani, vagina
Your Monologue's getting tired, now it's time to ride
Your Print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire
Harley dipped in octane
Let east coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every 'hood possible, pushin through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin at the speed of sound
Tryin to catch the ears of niggas that's runnin their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin our prey out
Leavin 'em layed out, dead, in just a sport
Cause we ain't playin up here in New York

[Hook - Fat Joe]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
And you can tell the way the homie spit, That nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
I got a hundred ways to make a grip, Yes, I'm from New York (New York)
And you can tell I get real ignorant, cause nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
(And this is how we do)

[Verse 2 - Fat Joe]
Nigga I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find god
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin' crazy how they're AK spit
But we done did some investigatin', and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
"Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me"
True Story, I'm bringing the team back
Even Roy Jones was forced to Lean Back
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin them hard, niggas said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the x is where the team be at

[Hook - Jadakiss]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
Ruff Ryde, and D-Block and shit, Nigga fuck what you thought (you thought)
And you can't take shit for granted, because life is too short (too short)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York
(Aha, and this is how we do)

[Verse 3 - Jadakiss]
I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin out with them old rifles
Just doin shit for nothing, it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that niggas wanna murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

[Hook - Ja Rule, Jadakiss & Fat Joe]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
And you can tell the way the homie spit, That nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits next time if you talk (you talk)
(And this is how we do)[intro: Jennifer Lopez and (Ja Rule)]
(What's my motherfucking name?)
R-U-L-E
(Blowin' back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin' the game)
And the game done chose me
(To bring pain to pussy niggas and pussy hoes, it's one in the same)
Ever since you told me
(There's only room for two, I've been makin less room for you)
Now only God can hold me
(Hug me, love me, judge me, the only Man that hovers above me, holla)

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I met so many men and
It's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving
Is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feelin sexy
Who's going to come for me
My only problem is
Their insecurity

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez and (Ja Rule)]
(Tired of bein alone) Yeah, yeah
(Sick of arguing on the phone) Yeah, yeah
(Are you tellin all your friends) Yeah, yeah
(That your nigga don't understand) My love

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez and (Ja Rule)]
Because I'm real
(The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk)
Because I'm real
(The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair)
Because I'm real
(The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild)
Because I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, I've been thinkin bout this relationship
And I want to know is this as good as it gets?
Because we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been looking at me, smiling at me, laughing like we wasn't happy
But not knowing that we're growing and we're getting married
Hard loving and straight thugging
Bitch, I am not doing this shit for nothing
I'm here to get it popping, hopping, let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowing in the wind, sun glistening off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't fuck with your baby

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez and (Ja Rule)]

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Now people loving me and hating me, treating me ungratefully
But not knowing that they aren't making or breaking me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again
Now people screaming what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them niggas mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
Because I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I could breathe again, baby, now I could breathe again

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez and (Ja Rule)]

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez and (Ja Rule)][Wyclef talking]
Yo to my people doing time, Xzibit, Juvenile, y'all need to
[Wake up everybody] Nature, Ja Rule, Reptile come on
Bring the heat

[Xzibit - overlaps Wyclef]
Look, I'm inhumane livin' in this house of pain
Stuck with a thousand street hustlers
Down on they luck
Repeat felons caught up with the death I was sellin'
And for the past three months yo I can still hear my victims yellin'
But I can't listen to my conscience it's nonsense
If I didn't shoot I'd be the nigga in the suit in the box under the ground
Fox chased by the hound locked permanent frown Xzibit get down
By liftin' iron by the pound for the tough individual
Runnin' run his mouth throw some hands with the General
Walk one day in the shoes of a criminal
Death disease keep your luxuries to a minimal
I'm not talkin' about weed, jewels, & Bentleys
I'm talkin' about clean clothes, hot food, and Dentyne
See what I mean livin' with the scum of the earth
Hit with plenty of time to adjust to life on the inside
(Wyclef) [For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]

[Juvenile]
You got me fucked up I'm innocent
Look I ain't do shit you don't want to hear my side
But you believin' that bitch
You makin' my nerves bad I need to smoke me a jo'
Cause I know y'all ain't even thinkin' 'bout lettin' me go
Where my lawyer, nigga told me Juv' I can't do nothin' for ya
Y'all go tell that to my mother & my father
But they gon' cuss ya out so don't you even bother
You know that shit ain't right that bitch didn't see nothin'
Cause it was dark at night but I guess us blacks
Look the same to y'all passin' niggas around like a game of ball
This is my third felony plus my third strike
Man I ain't goin' home I got 25 to Life
[For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]

[Nature]
QU New York, you try to criticize me I criticize you
Been the same muthafucka since in high school
Any beat I shed light to with crazy wattage
Blankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars
Learned who not to trust grew obnoxious
So niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us
Circlin' but they don't slow down take you to court
Think you seein' Judge Joe Brown they just actin'
Niggas throwin' Tyson back in another year
Fuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at you bust in the air
Give me space beats with plenty bass drink my Hennessey straight
'til I hurl out third world clout I'll take niggas hearts
And turn killers into girl scouts works of art
Picasso from the Hydro roller-slash-hustler CEO-slash-retired soldier
[For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]

[Ja Rule]
Kill or be killed behind the wall 40 day short
Still the thought of murderer true to the sport
I bang with the best in niggas career criminals
Now I'm in with these youngins lookin' to feel me out
Hollerin' 'bout how they gon' hit on me now
Niggas is real wild bangin' before trial
New case, new trial, I don't give a fuck
I'm playin' the yard ox taped to my nuts
Ready to self destruct Lord I don't wanna die
But what powered your honor to hit me with 25 fuck 'em
I know that real recognize every hustle
And die with they niggas in the struggle, ya feel me?

[Reptile]
Oh God shells loaded in the semi auto quoted
Unknown cat never voted picture me on the scene
Huntin' for greens like Mike Meyers trick or treatin' on Halloween
Mashed down in fatigues servin' the fiends
Kill or be killed metal pipes under the sleeve
In the city slicker bust checks or puff cess
Ruffneck love liquor & act figures bloodsport on the streets
No gloves pullin' knives out the 'fridge handin' out cold cuts
Ugh streets real thug so recognize thug close yo' eyes thug
You 'bout to die thug!
Call the President I'm blowin' up ya residence
Spill acid on the corpse to clear the evidence
Protestors outside screamin' free Gotti
Guard your body SWAT teams is waitin' with the shotty

Yo, yo Funk Doc straight lunatic since young
I ate paint chips the rare moon
That pair mics, my maintenance
I battle you and then me and Meth exchange shifts
For money, to your house arrest anklet
I take it all, if not, here's a thousand
Bricks, be shooting fair ones with bail bonds men
I'm constant, on that paper chase
Blow zip codes from bricks to 8-1-8
Doc serve til you lickin' the plate
Battle royal, in the ring smoking like Doc out of oil
Fire thrown to the roof of you apartment
Hit 95 then I hide with the Waltons
Down South, the forty-four feela
I'm a Dolo nigga, you a Polo nigga
I'm an Uptown shopper, you a Soho nigga
Westside highway running, homo nigga

[LL Cool J]
I'm the sultan of the ghetto
The homicidal aficionado
I empty niggas out like Cristal bottles, uh
When I battle, I'm breaking Bentleys down to gravel
I got the heat right here, we ain't got to travel
I'm bigger than producers, I figured out you losers
I knew my longevity confuse ya
Big paper game, come on run into these flames
Recognize the power of the royal King James
Phantom Menace, that's why niggas make faces like they drinking Guinness
When they realize I'm not finished
I've been paid, I've been platinum, been spittin', uh
Been eatin', been ballin' and you know I'm shittin'
Platinum links, chinky-eyed blonde haired honeys sippin' rainbow colored drinks
Black thugs with white minks, ready to jack the brink
Bend your little wifee over help her stretch out the kinks
That's why ya niggas freeze when I step up in the building
The Godfather's here giving blessings to his children
Carats shine, the world all mine
Can't believe these cats is poppin' shit about papers in their rhymes
Or bodies they collect, black Gotti shot a tech
Them gangsta visions will have you ass up in an ambulance
Cats ain't live, look up in my eyes
We can do this one more time, I'll let you decide
The Alize swigger, I clock twelve figgas
Think Giuliani's rough I got some real shit for niggas
Never been defeated, niggas retreated
Made the choice to be seated until my mission's completed
Get loose, get loose, Method Man get loose
What the world gonna do when my dogs get loose?
(Blaze one) Blaze one (Blaze one) Blaze One
Blaze, blaze, blaze one

Now four corners, four seasons
Four MC's with four reasons to bring this game to its knees
And why you down there, suck my dick
My whole motto is fuck it
Hit the smoke shop and blow my budget
MC's abusing my bitch, using my shit
I'm hanging off the roof with one hand, losing my grip
Now y'all don't wanna see me do that, now do you?
Go straight cuckoo and terrorize rap, do you?
I do my best work stressed out and under pressure
Deep inside the mind is where you'll find my buried treasure
I'm still wild, still Tical
Still gritty style, foul, crimi-niminal, individual
Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of chits
Too many rappers be on John Gotti's dick
Now this is something that we don't rehearse
Put that rap shit second, and hip-hop first

[Ja Rule]
Easy, ain't Nann niggas spitting like me
Nor Murderers motherfuckin' INC
Niggas will pass me, look me in the face, ask me
Are y'all really holdin' weight or did somebody gas me?
Ja be the myth, Reggie hand me the fifth let me explain
Your lil' man made me give him a lift
So you ridin' with gangstas
I'm up to a whole lot of other shit
Murderers is the clique, niggas can't deal with
Try it (Hataz) you gonna get yours to the heart
Lesson tonight by the four-four
Niggas want more than a little bit, hot shit

[Ja Rule]
I'm so ignorant cuz I done played my last tears
And pain is bliss been through so many things
It's hard to resist a mind that's currently
Thinking on his last wish it's nothing to fuck with
When I know what I want because you must think I'm a fool
Claiming you love what I do and be out playing the Rule
Bad move, more cars, more hoes, more jewels, and I'd love
Nothin more than to see you (6 Feet Underground) doesn't
Matter how we gonna get outta weed rollin it outta mindows
Nor from adam? but we show them uh now we leave them niggas
Creating a deal let it open so won't be goin (6 Feet Underground)

My body and soul I been outta control ever since I fell in the zone
I want nothin more than to see my niggas eat with me
But my enemies want nothin more than to see me (6 Feet Underground)

Chorus: (2x)

Come on nigga get it in blood because I've feel I've cursed
My body and soul I been outta control ever since I fell in the zone

But my enemies want nothin more than to see me (6 Feet Underground)

Chris Gotti
It doesn't matter what these morons say[Ja Rule] [Verse 1]
Murda Inc, ha, ha
It, must, be the ASS - that got me like damn
If they get any fatter
Man the Rule going to have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the L-O, hello
No, I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald
I'm the Rule and I shot call
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now

[Jennifer Lopez]
Isn't it funny
It's been awhile since you came around
Now you want to see what's going down
Trying to tell me why you want my time
Trying to tell me how I'm on your mind
See it never had to be this way
You should have never played the games you played
Now I'm seeing that you're kind of lame
Knowing how the situation change

[Chorus] [Jennifer Lopez]
Isn't that funny
Baby that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Isn't that funny
Baby that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Isn't that funny

[Jennifer Lopez] [Verse 2]
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're looking like a lonely man
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurting because my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
[Cadillac Tah]
C-A double D, HA!!!
Double dose ma
Fly by, red line, Testa Rossa
Oh I, never been a sucker for chocha
Spit the ism, hit them, get rid of em
And you know That get it gully
And isn't that funny
How they want me see me working with money
But Caddy isn't a dummy
What these brodies want from me
Because all I got is G, J.LO!!!
And Murda I.N.C

[Jennifer Lopez]
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Trying to make me sit and reminisce
Trying to blind me with your blinging bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever want to hear from you
I had enough of being there for you
Now I'm laughing why you play the fool

[Chorus]

[Ja Rul] [Verse 4]
Baby, is that your girlfriend
I got my boyfriend
But maybe we can be friends
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Baby, I've got my boyfriend
Is that your girlfriend
But maybe we can be friends
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Chorus][Intro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call (Buckshots, ha), always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

[Hook: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Hook: Ashanti]

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Hook: Ashanti]

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

[Hook: Ashanti]

[Outro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

[Radio Announcer]
Here at W-I-Z, we play nothing but the hits, nothing but the hits
Nothing but the motherfucking hits(Ashanti) [Ja Rule talking]
Always there when you call [Buck-shots, haha]
Always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby

(Chorus - Ashanti)
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

(Ja Rule)
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter-past three
And shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in hoops and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
[With Ashanti]
But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

(Chorus)
(Jay-Z)
Hov!
Big Pimpin'
Walk with a small limp
And I'm here to scoop you broads out your mid-sized cars
Bring hoes out of the closet
My dough gives chicks motive
He got enough money to afford it!
But one thing you could say about Jay
It's not a day I ever bought it
Y'all can audit my life
I put on that on my unborn daughter's life
All I give 'em is game
I don't give 'em my name
Chicks leap through hula-hoops to get in the flame
All it takes is Cristal juice to get in they pants, man
Ain't nothin' gon' change 'bout Hov
But my socks, my draws, and my Roc-A-Wear clothes
And of course the flows
So pretty soon I'll be able to rap in Morse Code (beep beep, beep beep)
Please believe me
But enough about Jay
My resume speaks for itself
Get your keys we leavin'
Hov!

(Chorus)
Oh I'm, feelin' like you livin' a, double life
Cause you don't be comin' home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin' for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
[With Ashanti]
But who cares, you care

(Chorus)
(Ashanti)
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine[Intro: Irv Gotti]
Nobody cares...
Trouble's like a cancer, you gotta get it early
You don't get it early it gets to big, it kills you
Nobody cares... that's why you gotta cut it out
Nobody cares, capeesh
Worry about yourself, your family, and people that are important to you
Let me tell you something...
When your alone late at night in the bed
Just you and her under the covers
You're only allowed three great women in your life
(Is it better to be loved or feared?)
They come along like the great fighters, once every ten years
Nobody cares (That's a good question
It's nice to be both but it'd be very difficult)
That's it, capeesh
(If I had my choice I'd rather be feared, see fear last longer than love)
Don't forget where you came from {*beat begins*}
Yeah, hell yeah
I'd like to welcome everybody
Inside the world of Murder I-N-C
And I'd like to introduce to y'all
My nigga, ATL's own huh Lloyd, Lloyd

[Lloyd]
Ladies come step inside with me
To take this ride with me
To see the top of the globe
Courtesy of Murder I-N-C's
Provided privacy, nobody'll know
Yeah I know I brought the mob with me
Cause obviously a lot of niggas snitch on the low
Just open your eyes, and see all these blind lies he done told
I realize how niggas fantasize
And the unreal truth gets sold to the youth
While others try to provide their souls to the booth
Fuck that, I'm bustin' back through the roof
Thugs tact or not, hard top or drop
Show em' how to rock and rock and roll and rock
How to relocate and open shop
Bringin' everything I know I got

[Hook: Lloyd]
Ain't no stoppin' what we doin'
Oh, feels like I been waitin' a while
Know it's been a long time comin' so ride
We gon' keep on movin'
It's my time to steer it now
Oh, right here and now

[Lloyd]
Niggas come and take this ride with me
Bricks and pies we'll see on the side of the road
Where everyday different bodies decay
Niggas is rotten in graves gettin' dropped in a hole
Follow me and come ride with this
Hide with and keep your eyes on watchin' for the po's
Cause they don't know about
Where we be hidin' out better turn up your jets
Headed right there yet, better build up your rep
Cause my niggas cash checks from Hollis to the Dec
Holla at me my nigga I gotta good connect
Outbid for the complex, polishin' the Lex
Redbone bagets, French robes is fresh
Love money and sex, the best of the best
When it's all said and done it's your time to invest
You just got to do it for yourself

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
Yeah, yo
Look here my lil' nigga, let me talk to you for a minute
I'mma tell you about this business and these cash incentives
About these fake ass bitches and these bitch ass niggas
How to spot the cowards from the killers, the flowers from the spitters
This industry is all smoke and mirrors
But we in the street niggas so our focus is to finish niggas off
How often do we put a nigga on
So you must be the chosen one
Your priority concern is never leave your residence without your gun
Cause you'd rather be caught with than without one
Trust me I'm like that old gangsta named Lucky
Niggas know that my hands are dirty but still can't touch me
In this game, if you clean, you can get all the money
When it starts gettin' dirty they look at you funny
Cause it's "A Bronx Tale" like Calogero and Sonny
And that bus don't stop for everybody, call it
Keep your nose clean fuckin' with addicts and alcoholics
Cause I'll have us on the bed with some hood bitches from Georgia
That's ATL for you, New York's no different
It's L.A. and Miami that's how they visit
Keep your eyes on these snitches and fraud ass niggas
They claim to be gangstas as soon as you see em' split em'
It's a cold world, be grateful that the Lord's forgiving
And be happy you ain't dead, sick, or in prison
My nigga

[Outro: Lloyd]
Ladies come take this ride with me
Niggas come take this ride with me
Ladies come take this ride with me
Niggas come take this ride with me
Ride with me, ride with me
Oh, it's Murder INC[LL Cool J Talking]
Yo, yea, aight after this particular practice run
I'mma practice both verses, after this, I want you to find a spot
That's close to when the beat drops to the rewind point, locate point
You ain't gotta be on that all night, this the soundtrack
Yo, Yea, Check it
Ok, alright, huh ok

[Verse 1]
The other night I was up at Farmers, politican wit some bloods
They told me "yo L, in the streets you ain't gettin no Love
And Ever since the X's and the Jiggas came out
My niggas ain't tryin to the hear that smooth shit you talk about
What's Up wit that cat Canibus, some played you out
Why you didn't answer back correctly, fuck was that about?"
As I sip on some henny, and try to explain some things
About the life of a legend, and all the Drama it brings
Been gone a long time, had a lot of shit on my mind
I decided I don't want to reach my goal if it means losing my shine
Streets is Hip-hop and I'm Hip-Hop, so the streets is Mine
Ballin' as long as you been livin', that's a long time
Hard to Stay hungry when your pockets are so fat
You hit a hot one in every city on the map
And niggas keep sleepin' and you keep coming back
You know better than the gat, but niggas still wanna clap

[Hook-2x][Ja Rule]
It feels so good to be back Where I Belong
The Streets is Where I Belong
They Had me locked down much too long
Hey Hey

[Verse 2]
Some Say "L that's cool, but see times have changed"
Niggas got red bandanas, and the grill in the range
That gold shit is dead, niggas rock platinum chains
Trade O.E. for Henny, Colt 45 for champagne
Hustling niggas found they way into the game
Extorting all these so called ballers wit big names
And you gotta have a squad, cuz running from Def ain't safe
I know you living good, but ain't no smile up on our face
I'm like a villain, I'm representing on my lyrics
And force feed the world, even if they don't want to hear it
As far as Canibus go, my man is hittin' his ex-broad
I'm getting head from his new piece
While 20 gang-bangers applaud, you came up with that bullshit
Some heads sucked it up, then you dropped that garbage album
And Totally fucked it up, I coulda told ya I knew your moms
From the after-hours spot, when I used to be up in Canada
With the dreads on a black block, before you dick rode Lost Boyz
For a ticket our to Jersey, but being the man I am
I tried to show ya mercy, I coulda told the World
The way ya label hates your guts
And how me and Wyclef, got together to set you up
And how he gave me half your budget, don't believe me look it up
Ya A&R promotion niggas, they helped me hook it up
I hate to be responsible, for destroying your career
A one-hit wonder, huh
No Wonder you disappeared, I coulda told the world
You get your lyrics from the internet
Then spit 'em word for word
Like you really a rap vet, How you take metaphors from books
And put 'em in your rhyme, and how you really from Canada
And you been frontin' all this time
I heard your second album, that shit is garbage too
LL Cool J and I did this to you
On that note he said
"Yo L, you the man", I said peace, one love
And Drove off in the Lex Land

[Hook- 2x]

[LL Cool J talking]
Yea nigga, the jig is up nigga, huh ha
You know what I'm sayin?, all that bullshit you was talking
Dont mean shit, you finish now
I'm still the man nigga
The vanguard award is in my motherfuckin living room
You know what I mean? come get that shit, fuck, what
MIC still on my arm nigga, word up
Both arms, I'mma get another one nigga
You Know what I'm sayin, this LL you know how I get down
You should of known, when you did it
He probably did it to get some fame
But is this really what you want? Hahahahahahahha[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
It was supposed to be you and I and the curtains closed
But somewhere along the lines we switched episodes
It's kinda like when Gina left Martin for New York
Speaking of New York, the city is so lost
Even with the Knicks looking to make the playoffs
Spike is back on the court, and Jeter's still with the Bronx
Bloomberg got the city ready for seance
Go get your ouija boards out, niggas, and pray on
You want drama? Get your fucking ? on
Still got the world on my shoulders, a nigga headstrong
About to go in, you can lock my body
Contract my mind, my thoughts keep escaping
Power of the pen, a work of art like Basquiat
I ? 'cept I paint my pictures lyrically, you fancy, huh
Bitch foamin like a Swiss B
And we ain't talkin hoes, we talkin Euros and raw weed

[Hook]
Who do you believe in?
Is it money or the man upstairs? Is it power or prayer?
God bless the dead and fuck the world fast
What's progression if you never been through backlash?
Nigga, what do you believe in?
Cause my money's on me, myself, and I, my team, and this music
Y'all ain't gon' believe this
Maybe it's my fault, or maybe y'all just making excuses

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Who do you believe in?
Motherfucker the money is talking to me and tellin me that it's lonely
In need of new friends, preferably Grants and Franklins
And the singles and the fives went to the bitches
Dubs is for wifing in the club, no mention
But you know who you are, nigga stop flinching
Stop cuffing; you may not think that it's a bitch
But life's a ho and everybody's been fucking
See, that's what I believe in
With no logic, no need for experience
To fuck the world would be a lifetime achievement
You make it cum then e'rybody jump on the dick
Y'all niggas full of shit, that's why you fuckin assholes
And never smell the shit stinking 'til you get shitted on
Fuck 'em all, not for nothing
I ain't always on time, too much ice in the vodka mo'fucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Who do you believe in? Cause even the smartest
Of niggas got the gall and the balls to believe this
Rule back, renaissance nigga, that's the project
Up next, the pill, deuces, gon' swallow that
Matter of fact, swallow dick, bitch, get your fix on
Gased up niggas go and get it, gon' get it
Next on, the next episode, new time, new cats
News flash: nobody's exempt from the backlash
Backstabbing, bootlicking me, kissing ass
Niggas still stick to the system, God bless 'em
Cause power brings power, money making more money
Love will make you not love again, but constantly want it
Warning: feelings erupt when they're left dormant
It's what y'all witnessing, it's what I believe in
Like new money, new cars, new bitches
Life is a game of inches, believe this

[Hook]Murder Inc. shit
Uh... uh, uh, uh

Chorus: Christina Milian

Now every little thing that we do (that we do)
Should be between me and you (me and you)
The freaky things that we do (that we do)
Let's keep between me and you (me and you)
Cause every little thing that we do (that we do)
Should be between me and you (me and you)
The freaky things that we do (that we do)
Let's keep between me and you, ba-byyy

[Ja Rule]
Yo...
Now when I first met her all I thought was "Thong thong-thong"
Like, "Lose the lame, we can get our freakin on"
Baby know the game, slip away, and slide me yo' number
It's the last day of spring, see you first day this summer
I'm a bad motha; shut yo' mouth! Pull the drop out and
Creep at a low speed, cause homey probably know me
I push the pedal, thoughts of your stilleto
Way up in the air like I think he's here
Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you (with you)
Homey be checkin up on you (on you)
But if that nigga only knew (only knew)
You've got a lot of freak in you, ba-byyy
Well now it's startin to rain, I pop the roof and the champagne
How Jay said? "Money Ain't a Thing"
It's been close a few, at times even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, ba-byyy

Chorus

[Ja Rule]
Girl it's on again, every year - we hummer 'em in
Beaches, houses, hoes, foes, friends
And when the, day ends - that's when it all begins
You wit him? Here's my room key; holla at me
While you thinka-think I'mma hit it up
Then look at the nigga you thinkin you love? C'mon love
We could go there, me and you, creep off all night
If you love it, in the mornin, awake with new light
If you lookin like I ain't gonna handle his
Let me handle my bizzz, it is what it is
Nigga livin his liiiife, and that's my bitch
You know I gotta wiiiife, let's keep this thing tight, ba-byyy

Chorus

[Ja Rule]
Don't let the word get out (shhh), ba-byyy
This is - strictly between me and you, ba-byyy
If they - knew we were doin what we were doin it'd probably ruin
Our creep away summer in Cancun'n-and I, love
The way we get away, throw away a whole day
Turn off the pagers and phones, we in the zone like
"Fuck liife, we live liife
This is our liife, live your liife"

[Christina Milian]
Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you (with you)
Shorty be checkin up on you (on you)
But if baby girl only knew (only knew)
You've got a lot of freak in you, ba-byyy

[Ja Rule]
Did I ever tell you, my man love what you do
That little thing with yo' tongue; you the best, who knew?
It's been close a few, at times even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, ba-byyy

Chorus

(That we do)
(Me and you)
(That we do)
(Me and you)
(That we do)
(Me and you)
(That we do)
(Me and you)[Ja Rule]
Drummer drives me
In the bing doing flat three
Rather rip a nigga for rap than fight to be free
That's just me
Ja Rule inevitably
Living the lifestyle that get most niggas shot down
I'm in now
And only niggas thrown from tiers gon' touch ground
Seal his lips to silence the sound
I drop on niggas heavy
And all of my bing monsters is ridin' ready
Benchin the weight of Chevy's
Ox is like machetes, for when it's

[Headrush Napoleon]
The white man's justice
Be the black mans grief
Animal instinct
Abnormal canine teeth
I earned my black heart for props to hold turf
Go down on a V.I. ox your whole earth
Make it pop at church service
While you're lying to God
We bring drama
Get it on with the entire riot squad
Ain't an enemy of mines
That'll step in my house
Cause the CO's is my hijos
And they settin me out
From Clinton to Coxsackie to Sing Sing daddy
We eat high hoes
Juice and jack mac patties
If not probably arroz con godbody
I got a one to three
Rockin with niggas biddin bodies
Never was a dead nigga till I reached them bars
And I earned the doorag gem stars and keloid scars
For y'all

Triple O survive or die
Canine rise with wolves
Sneak thieve your dorm, and walk on all fours
Locked in the mountains
Niggas'll lose things
Like they manhood
Hung with shoestrings
Faces disfigured
Disgrace these niggas
Run 'em out of the house like Replacement Killers
Cowards playing the towers
Loose powers
Won't last an hour
Get aped in the showers
Bing monsters come through and bust you
Guerillas extortion
Strong arm muscle
Drag queen kill a fiend for thorazine
Take they blood oath and form they own team
Niggas spittin out razors
Fiend for rangers
Locked with a sumo thug in small cages

Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me

[Verse 1]
She better come straight with no chaser
Cause ran this motherfucker, I'd chase her
And she the only one I got a taste for
All drinks is on me, I can taste her
Cause I know that you see me through the glass
So cool it down boy, they call me Ice cube
You alwayš go down so smooth
I think I'll have a double with you
Vodka came with Khalua
And vermouth for guesses to three
And this is how I see you
A couple more will make look more like Shakira

[Pre-Hook]
A few shots of tequila, it might kill you
Or it's more than likely to get your mind blown
Feel me, more importantly you feel love
If not, maybe you didn't have enough of that

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I very rarely drinking on a weekday
But this was the day after Tuesday, hump day
So I make an exception to the rule
Got cocktails for two, it was only me and you
Ugly, like a hangover
Had a fuck and get drunk and call my ex over
She will remain sober
But have you ever seen this bitch with her clothes off
We turn the lights off, lit up some candles
She was the OJ, I was the Smirnoff
Cancel, it's like when the show's over
House lights off, everybody go home

[Pre-Hook]
Cause too much of petroleum might kill you
It's more than likely to get your mind blown
Feel me, more importantly you feel love
If not, maybe you didn't have enough of that

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Pretty brown eyes, beautiful lips
Dark complexion like licorice
I run my finger around the edge of the rim
Of my shot glass, body's an hourglass
It's summertime, still got class
Still the best shot a nigga ever threw back
You finna get me drunk fast
Hit me home, strip me down, butterfly effect
You so fly (so fly)
I'm so high (so high)
I can't lie, no matter how bad I want you
You ain't ever gon' feel like the firšt time

[Pre-Hook]
And too much tequila might kill you
But it's more than likely to get your mind blown
Feel me, more importantly you feel love
If not, maybe you didn't have enough of that

[Hook x2][Intro Hussein Fatal]
And what ever it is then that's what is gonna be nigga
Hussein Fatal, the outlaw don, "Blood In My Eyes"
Shyea', Triple O stand up, Got your mind's back right
Jerse's mobbin' these cowards all the time
You know gunning them down, Every thing like that
Smooth stayin' forty below on these cowards, early nigga
Outlaw status only got these niggas on freeze
Get down and lay down, Draw heat and protect your self
Rule' holla at yo' peoples nigga..

[Verse 1 Ja Rule]
For now on call me the don, and bicthes call me don da da
Where ever I go niggas soon to follow'
Like when I dropped my first joint making the world "Holla"
I kept it "Between Me And You"
Cause that what real street niggas do
"Put it on Me, cause even thugs get lonely
Sometimes "I Cry", fo' niggas I'm a baptized
When will they realize I "Live It Up"
Cop tha coke sell it and re' it up
I'm "Always On Time" got bitches "Memsmerize"
From the "Thug Lovin" load the clip
Cock back the nine, open mouth shove it
Look in his eyes, and squeeze like fuck it
And just to think my niggas do this shit for nuthin'
When my wild Rule' thuggins, lookin' to get a come up
Come on in and catch the angel that's all in
Call me Lord remis' my time, and I'll arrive with
Blood in my eyes

[Hussein Fatal Talking]
That's what real niggas do u know
We hold it down for each other
We don't waste time we get it done
Why not, Why would'nt we, you know
That what goes down you know
You draw yours, I draw mine
Who ever get the drop that what it is
The object is to get it done, let's go it's nuthin' (Yo)

[Verse 2 Ja Rule]
Fuck tha world and niggas that proceed to run it
Rule' for prez cause I'm one of the best that done it
On the M-I, these niggas spittin' semi, to get by
But never really get right, livin off of the hit I
"DMX" was my dog, but now we just dog fight
Sucking on glass dicks
Calling
Them crack pipes
And I'm hearin' you letting yo' health slide these days
And yo lady's dicked up, and you contracted to aids
Who the fuck you callin' gay nigga, must a been talk to
Em' and "Dre", nigga, pour out a little liqour
And rest in peace to "2Pac Shakur", cause you let us know
That Dre was a queer before
And "Marshall" how dare you use his name in vain
Son of a panther, you'll never understand his pain
But you do understand trailer parks and cocaine
Disrespcting your mother what fuckin part of
The game is that man , I guess this world need change
So we got it, and now I gotta put 'em in the grave
Red, dot 'em before they put us in the cage
Rule' and Gotti america's most wanted to many..
Come and get me!!! (Pretty soon ya gonna pay)[Caddillac Tah]
Yeah..
Yeah, yeah, yo
I got a knack for pushin crack, and cookin raw coke
Fresh off the boat, no vest but I tote, and wear it like a coat
I'm starin through the scope, with one eye open and one shut
Zero in on the target, spark him and watch his head bust
Ain't shit to discuss, unless it's moneybags
Or the SK-8, drop Jag with funny tags
Homey laugh now but die later when the lead dump
And double barrel slugs like Elmer Fudd, I'm handsome

[Black Child]
Some of your favorite rappers is flamin, I'm bangin things at them
They claim they gangster, lettin mens give brains to them
I aim the stainless, let the games begin
Bang bang dangerous, my gun gang famous
My hoes don't speak english, catch 'em at the foreign money exchange
New Armani leather in the Range
When you see my gang, tuck in your chain
We stuck in the game, we fuckin the same, bang!

[Hook: INC]
[Merc] I'm bout my money and bout my business (bang!)
[B.C.] Shout out my niggas en route to riches (bang!)
[B.C.] I doubt we different, hustlers pitchin (bang!)
[B.C.] And we all gon' get away, all my niggas say
[Merc] I'm bout my money and bout my business (yeah!)
[B.C.] Whatta, bout my bitches who mouth is ridiculous (yeah!)
[B.C.] Gettin money and nigga it's insignificant (yeah! what?)
[B.C.] Always get your pay, I love it when I hear 'em say

[Black Child]
It's back to business, stackin riches
If you, act suspicious, it's a Wrap like Reynolds
Black Continental, mac outta the window
Black's out of his mental, I black out with pistols
It ain't confidential, all the shit I been through
Now I'm gettin money and a mill' is essential
Bang bang, nigga, 'til the day we die
A tooth for a tooth and a eye for a eye

[Caddillac Tah]
Nigga you know it's, business befo' pleasure, money over chicks
Dummies in the clip, nickel on my hip patrollin through the strip
Bet a stack, head crack, no rollin to the six
Scoop up my chips, then I split, with my beautiful bitch
Like Jada Pinkett Smith, for that paper I leave stinkin and stiff
Your pinky and wrist, and your necklace
Get removed nigga, my wolves is playin hardball
Leavin him bloody like a Pelican Bay yard brawl

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
Who wanna know why I got so much beef with so many rappers?
Drama, it's the INC redrum spun backwards
Karma, is a muh'fucker watch your actions
Cause the clip to the max slips in bananas
I catch fire like matches {*whew*} then blow out
And the flyest crews goin the fastest
Pull up to the hottest club in New York, with my hazards on
No tags, I just drove it off the showroom floor
Straight cash, bout my paper, I'm on my gangster
Doin this shit for ten years, niggas I'm major
Maybach and all that, same behaviour
Money over bitches, bitches over strangers
Guns befo' bangers but bangers do
For niggas that had enough and ain't got no clue
That they can get slayed, flex and get sprayed
And spin they head like yo' hottest DJ's, motherfuckers!

[Hook]

[Merc] I'm bout my money and bout my business..[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse, if I was broke would you want me
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
Bitches kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a eight-figga nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a baller so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

[Refrain]
Can I get a fuck you
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough

[Amil]
Can I get a woop woop
To these niggas from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggas without dubs

[Jay-Z]
Now will you bounce with me bounce with me
Bounce bitch, bounce

[Verse 2: Amil]
You ain't gotta be rich but fuck that
How we gonna get around on your bus pass
Before I put this pussy on your mustache, can you afford me
My niggas breadwinners, never corny
Ambition makes me so horny
Not the fussin' and the frontin'
If you got nothing, baby boy, you better
Get up, get out and get some, shit
I like a - lot of Prada, Alize and vodka
Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up
Get it up I put it down everytime it pop up, huh
I got to snap 'em, let it loose, then I knock ya
Feel the juice, then I got ya - when you produce a rock
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa
My - coochie remains in a Gucci name
Never test my patience, nigga, I'm high maintenance
High class, if you ain't rollin', bypass
If you ain't holdin' I dash yo

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
It ain't even a question
How my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes
Like my puss wet like damp clothes
What y'all niggas don't know: it's easy to pimp a ho
Bitches better have my money fo sho
Before they go runnin' they mouth, promotin' how
I be dickin' they back out, go 'head, let it out
I fucks with my Gat out, bounce and leave a hundred
Makin em feel, slutted even if they don't want it
It's been so long, since I met a chick ain't about chips but then I'm
Dead wrong, when I tell em, "be gone"
So hold on to the feelin' of flossin' and plat-num
Cause from now on
You can witness Ja the i-con
With hoodies and Timbs on, cause I thugs my bitches
VV studs my bitches, then we rob bitch niggas
I'm talkin' bout straight figures, if you here, you with us
If not Boo, you know what, I still fucked you[Intro - Ja Rule - talking]
Word to mother, my nigga Buck 3000 on the boards
Holla back ... hey Terry you gon' be big boy
Y'knahmsayin? ... aiyyo, aiyyo Jody
Hey you can tell somebody to go downstairs to the car and shit, get that bottle of Voo
Out the back of the back for me baby
I need to get right before I do this here
Uh huh

[Hook - Lloyd] + (Alexus)
(Why me and you)
Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up
(What we been through)
It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feelin you)
And I'm feelin we should both be free
(If we were through)
Just imagine what life be without me

[Verse 1 - Ja Rule]
Mami I put my best foot forward, though it's kinda awkward
Cause I'm pigeon-toed and bow-legged, but you ain't too proud to beg
First time we got alone, you gave me some head
And been callin me ever since, to do it again
When we met you was a seven, just creepin to ten
And now your my lucky quarter, the days get shorter, lights get longer
You know when the weather is cold, feelings grow stronger
Wanna perform her, your pussy feel like walkin pneumonia
Got me snifflin, sneezin, coughin, and achin and shit
And I'm startin to think I'm fallin in love with this bitch
I'm havin dreams about her jeans and how they fit
... in that Urban Jeffrey baby tee
She's wearin my name already, so you know she's fuckin me
I'm a G like that, but for you I fell backwards
The only question I ask myself is ... shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ja Rule]
Why me? Better yet why you and I?
Why I always pick the ones not in they right mind and crazy?
Singing "Dangerously In Love" and ... this a dangerous broad I'm fuckin
Like Al it's the "Scent of a Woman"
That got me playin hardball like Doc Gooden
Excuse my intrudin, I don't mean to be rude, but our situation is kinda amusin
Cause we both like each other, but scared of each other
It's like we more than friends, but less than lovers
And my niggas can't tell us, what we been doin is wrong
And your girl's gettin jealous, cause we been gettin along
Hold on, this is how it all begins
You call your friends, I'll call my friends, we'll all be friends
And hang out at the mansion, in the Hamptons on weekends
Then it all ends, and the question is ..

[Hook]

[Break - Lloyd]
Have you even been touched like I touch ya?
Been held like I hold ya?
Been loved like I love ya?
Be real, be real
Have you ever been seen like I see you?
Been heard how I hear you?
Been felt how I feel you?
Be real, be real

[Verse 3 - Ja Rule]
Girl your my (sunshine)
But sometimes it gets a little cloudy don't it?
Them sunny days
I see the sunrise, and wish that it could hit ya face
It'd be great to get up every morning to eggs and steak
But you can't relate, so we separated on good terms
No one's concerned, about who ya been fuckin, and who ya fucked last
But when I see you, still the question I ask is ..

[Hook] - 2X[Intro - Ja Rule]
Yeah, yeah.. haha yeah!
I gotta get my headphones
All my gangsta niggas is in the building on this one!
You know! Yeah yeah ya know
It's real!! Hussein what's happ'nin nigga?
I see you, aight Shadow what's poppin BLAT!
Haha haha, yeah my nigga O-1 in the motherfucking house
Jody in the house (Jody Mack!)
My nigga Cadillac, Gotti what up!
Blackchild what up!
I'd like to welcome all my niggas
To the world famous Murda Inc. Show
Big shout to all my Queens niggas in Staten Island
Niggas in Uptown, niggas in Brooklyn niggas
All my Bronx niggas yeah, all my Jersey niggas! you know?
We doing it real big right here! all my money niggas
This shit commentated on the one's and two's!
They call me the Mighty Rule! how ya living?
This real shit we talking
I wanna ask all my gangsta niggas a real question (holla back)
What do you do - when niggas spit at you?

[Hook - Ja Rule]
Clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war niggas!)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war niggas!)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back

[Verse 1 - Ja Rule]
Fuck if they holl'in about Rule nigga, here's the real
I'll pop ya top like Champagne bottles that chill
Wear nothing but ice, smiles tinted up to The Greatest
Tell em I'm nice too, plus push them nice coupes
The Inc roll like duece man, I'm ol' G Bobby J
And we slinging soccer fields of yay
They don't respect that, don't get your mind around
You'll get it pushed back, y'all don't want that
I send em to the morgue while keepin my bitches bouncin fa sho
"In Da Club" with no gun, got em taking it off
Can't help that, I'm the nigga that puts it down
Once I hit that, that's if I'm up in the Maybach
Fasten them holding the throwback, West 44 Lakers
Let's make no mistakes when these F's take place
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga air out the space!
(C'mon!) We gon'

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ja Rule]
The Rule be "In Da Club" rude motherfucker poppin the bubbly
When shit get ugly I hug the snub closely
But usually we still see your bitches
Dancin on some freak shit, trying to ride my dick
I can't handle it, lower their manners
To get they ass infront of my dick to dance, to B.I.G.'s "One More Chance"
Catching hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These niggas is mere ants, I'll stomp 'em wit a shank
Give bitches the back hand, pimp shit, it's not realistic
The game is helpless, let's not get it twisted
I'm young, wrapped, and gifted, but still at the bottom
And stuck somewhere between Gomorrah and Saddam
I'm here to make this rap shit hotter than Harlem
Fuck the dog cause the werewolves is out the prowl
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga air out the space!
(C'mon!) We gon'

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ja Rule]
Like Bush and Saddam, I'm a find out
Where Em Laden's hiding and bomb him first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than yo scrubs
Mask and glove, gun hot from burnin ass up
I'd rather be bossed up, wit a bunch of broads
The preachers daughter screaming out "Fuck the Lord!"
I may have struck a chord, wit the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessings to handle my business
All these wanksta snitches, let the nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress
And "Clap that boy" like Birdman and Clipse
I got these niggas all over my dick, like hoes
I'm the star at these shows, I must be as hot as they come
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga air out the space!
(C'mon!) We gon'

[Hook]

[Outro]
[Ja Rule] Yeah, my nigga Zino in this motherfucker
[Benzino] That's how we do it, know what I mean
[Benzino] Buck '89 what's up baby, I see you
[Ja Rule] Break 'em down nigga! break 'em down!

[Ja Rule] All my Brooklyn niggas, Brooklyn sir what up!
[Ja Rule] Haha, yeah, holla at me manWoooooo
Murder Inc Motherfucker

[Hook: Chink Santana]
We world wide connected, and ya'll don't want to fuck with us
In the streets we respected, so ya'll don't want to fuck wit us
World wide connected nigga, ya'll don't want to fuck wit us
We gangster ass niggas and we hard to hit
Murder Inc in the role who could fuck wit this

[Eastwood]
It ain't no verse mother fuckers who fake east thugs
Its murder Inc and the Row nigga throw up your dub
They show us love in the club real niggas bossed up man
We heavily intoxicated so toss it up
Attacks your mind and your conscience
Written to enhance this verbally thugs grammar
I'm bout to touch the roof wit it
Extraordinary and I was never ordinary in cemetery
Bisit my thugs in mortuaries
End all most reality young name and 'Pac
I'm a keep my heat tucked until my soul goes pop
I hear a lot of niggas rapping
But there ain't that many rappers out there scraping and keep it cracking
We keep it happening
I'm a million out the gate
No scratch that 8 from cd's to tapes we rock like earthquakes
I'm Eastwood catch me dipping a Fleetwood like a g should
Young Eastwood is so damn good

[Hook]

[Crooked I]
Nigga think that I is raw spit
Murder Inc and Tha Raw, we all sick
So niggas Involved get mauled quick as a dog and the raw gets you involved
And I'm a draw quick, nigga awwww shit
Punks talking lick I haul off quick
Wit a sawed off kick It's like they fall off cliffs
Y'all call it off before all y'all get stoned
Like you're fallen off in a raw mosh pit
Get tossed in a ditch your coffin is sick
While I floss in the awesomest whips and I toss in your chicks
Your caution when your calling your six
Cause your talk can get you crossed and lost in the mix
I'm a pause in the bitch bossed in the pits
Burn I serve niggas stay off at ya clique
Spend off with ya grip my land of gangreen
You have the doctors taking your leg off of your hip
Motherfucker!

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
All y'all niggas need to get off my dick
I spit it how I live it plus the flows real sick
Bronchial eating
I got killers ranged from Compton to Cleveland
World wide connected air tight niggas there's no breathing
Give me the reason I put a halo throw your mental
And give your the Holy Spirit and see you to gods temple
I'm the avenging angle and earth be thy claim
And Ja be thy name, I know your all praying
For the day of my diminishing
Why don't somebody finish them off and put it right through his cross
The X's The 50'S ya'll gotta be kidding me
These niggas is my sons
Raised them from young
Curtis and lil earl, should of been little girls
Coz they bitchmade now they act like one of my itchbays
Touche the rule is more than ready
Gun heavy, and worldwide connected feel me?

[Hook]It's my heart
Pray

Daddy's little baby, must learn this world is shady
And the color of your skin don't make you less of a lady
Degrade yourself, never cuz I'm teaching you better
Life ain't all about cheddar diamonds and leather
Understand you a black sister, in this white man's
World, don't let it get ya, down girl
It's essential that you grow amongst your group
So you don't grow too fast and be doin lord knows who
Cuz daddy loves you, don't let nobody tell you different
What I, do for a living is a talent I'm given
And I'mma raise you too black too strong beautiful
Tell the truth let you know what women go through
Lies and deceit, the nigga you love he gone cheat
So be careful in the heat baby girl wit cold feet
Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you daddy's little baby ha

[Hook]

I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever

Yo Ja's imagery is somewhat like God and his chemistry
Blasphemy, I tell my baby girl proudly
Put her over my knee and let her know this world is yours
Men are dogs take it from daddy and hold yours
Head high lady, love is bout lies and deception
Will always be seen through the eyes
In my demise don't cry just, hold on
Stay headstrong and live to learn that life goes on
The day you was born God answered my cry for help
I look at you a female replica of myself
I was conceived 2/29 you 9/22
God' whats the science in this sign you threw?
I wanna know just so I can spread the jewel to my youth
So she don't have to come up like I did runnin loots
Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
For real

[Hook]

When I look in yo eyes I see stars
It's me and you against the world
Baby it's in the signs
And anything you want you can get it daddy's getting it done
You the reason why I keep the hundreds under the ones
And go through rain sleet and snow to kiss the sun
Though my travel through the storm has just begun
Swear to god when my sister died, I was only five
Didn't even cry, couldn't know the value of a life
Know I realize why Brittney's so rare to me
She came at the time when nobody cared for me
This world's tough, I'mma guide you through it carefully
Learn the game and remember nothing in life's free
My little lady, can't quite understand me now
But baby, in time I'll break it down
So keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
For real

[Hook][Ja Rule]
Yea, yo - yo - yo - YO! - (yo) - Holla (Holla)
The Last Temptation, we comin' through now niggas
S'the problem?, (the problem?) s'the problem?, (the problem?)
Always has been, hahaha, yo partna (yo partna)
Turn me up this bitch up in my mothafuckin' headphones and shit
C'mon, well let these niggas know, (niggas know)
Let it known...muh'afuckas y'all want war wit' the GOD
C'mon y'all know better, I put holes in ya leather
Reknit your sweater, and I bet the flows wetter
Then ocean front property - better come at me properly
Niggas better off poppin' me - but I believe
Y'all scared to clap them hammers
And the fact I'm unpredictable, gives me the advantage
What the fuck, am I'm speaking spanish niggas
What I got ta tell y'all in detail how we murder niggas
Handle ya buisness, Tha Inc. is religious
Murder's the sacrifice, throwing M's niggas
That means Murda fa' life, and I'll die for that red and black
That house wit' tha chedda stack, wit' smiles in my kids face
What could replace this, this lil' nigga here
The coming to grips with death, to taste it
My airs thick and filled with hatred
Surprise of that look in my eyes, but don't be
I'm just following the foots of the Lord, then thank me
If I go crazily insane, I'mma blame it on the world
Look what I became, cause they ain't give me all the
Fame and the money mayne, made me an I-con
So the world can catch a nigga with his lights on
That's the pros and con, ya never quite free
So just gimme a lil' room so I can breathe
And my pain goin' be the death of me
But to be loved is my destiny, my black people...
Yea (yea) - we out (we out) Holla (Holla - Holla - Holla)
