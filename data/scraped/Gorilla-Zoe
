[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
Walking around looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
A Labyrinth, a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

[Hook 1: Gorilla Zoe]
I'm lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving
On and off the road
I'm lost on a road
But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm livin in a rush
I don't understand this fuss
My brain is bout to bust

[Hook 2]
I think I'm losin it
I might be losin it
I just might lose
Am I losin my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losin it?
Am I losin it?
I think I'm losin
I'm losin my mind
Am I losin it?
Am I losin it?
I think I'm losin
I'm losin my mind

[Verse 2]
I call up my girlfriend she dosen't answer
I hit the strip club and fuck with a dancer
Throwing my ones up, like I'm paying ransom
Told me I look good, she said I was handsome
So believed her, because I am lonely
Im just a loner, my life is a movie
Tonight we're just actors, and this is a sitcom
So tell me you love me, and tell me i'll get some

[Hook 1 & Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
I'm makin this money
Just to go spend it
Livin the good life
Hope nobody ends it
But who are you kidding?
Ay who are you lying to?
You know if they want you
Best believe they will find you

We took the 4's of the Chevy and we set it on those 6's

Bring another band get yourself a pound of midget
They know what it is, y'all know what it is
He know what it is, she know what it is

[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
Threw them 26 inch shocks on a 71 Chevelle

They say shawty give a mill
Shawty I'mma give a mill
Quarter milli worth of jewelry
Like that boy can't even care
'Bout no money, 'bout no ho
'Bout no car, 'bout no clothes
Boy you better hold your nose
Cuz I'm shitting, hold your nose
Get a Louis bag for what?

Run up on me if you want
You won't have time to make a call
Give the burner to my dog
He catch a case I break him off
Putting mileage on my Pyrex
Yeah we call that baking off
Talking fast, counting cash
Take that pussy hit them all
Never wear a rubber
Where I'm from we call that living fast
CEO of Maybach Music but I need no limit cash
Master P done with the kilo
Puerto Rico, s√≠ gordito
Finest nigga in the game
Can a playa shoot a free throw? (Swish)
I'm speaking the facts
It's Deeper Than Rap
Paid off the Maybach
And I did it three weeks in the trap

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Gorilla Zoe]
My chain is worth a mansion
And my wrist is worth a Lambo
But I'm living in a mansion
And I'm riding in a Lambo
Bunch of ganstas like Sopranos
Like keys, like pianos
And I'm looking for a bitch
That wants to join me in a porno
Hello darling, how you doing?
That's your man? You need to lose him
He ain't doing what I'm doing
I go tall like Patrick Ewing
Urkel purple pants are cushioned
Straight from Oakland they just flew in
If I bust that package open
You would think I started booing

Hop up in a whip and get out of here

You can go where I go, I go where you won't go
Trips to Acapulco, probably cause I got dough
Baby I got game though, I am not a lame-o
Gucci Gucci Gucci, baby come up out that rainbow
Swag to the left to the right with me
And I can cover your body with Louis V
Fantasy fulfilled if you come with me
And I'll introduce you to a lavish live of luxury
It's just you and me, wherever we go
I wanna know is the one to stow
And I'm spending the dough
Tell me what's going to break me
Receipts so long, mayn, he thinking I'm crazy
If you were my baby

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

[Gucci Mane]
I ain't never had shit nigga that's the truth
Rich kids in the school used to jones my shoes
Name stayed on the board, fo' checks in chalk
In detention cause the teacher say that we can't talk
Counselor raggin and my momma got that I just walk
I wish I had a nickel for every fight I fought
Stealin candy out the sto' like I can't get caught
Just a lil' bad black boy, it ain't my fault
After school snack syrup and fo' pieces of bread
Granddaddy why yo' eyes so God damn red?
"Got a real soft ass and a hard-ass head
Better mind your fuckin manners boy," that's what he said

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
I moved to East Atlanta at the age of 9
Real cold winter, 1989

They won't let you pack a tool on the b-ball court
Cluster Ave, Monty Paul, where my daddy now?
Things goin alright, we a family now
Got the dopeman Nikes and the Starter coat
Only nigga in school with the dopeman rope
Pull the joint two times, man I'm high already

Got that bump for stick-up, Starter and the big boy chest
Tried to take it on the train but I just couldn't let him

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
14 gettin drunk at a house party
They locked me up, they must have hid a half a ounce on me
Momma mad as a mother', daddy let him be
Gucci Mane, raised me to be a straight up G
Now my daddy hustle hard, but he love sum liquor
And my momma wanna leave him but she love the nigga
Everything kinda changed when I turned 16
Got the old school Regal with the chrome back rings
Like a newborn baby, man that bitch clean
But the motor fucked up and the transmission
And it's knockin down the street with the 415's
In Mackmile parkin lot, stright whipping
And I'm Bankhead bouncin, fo' hoes want me
Hit the half and give me two dimes for 15
And my mind's on gettin rich by all means
In the trap, cause this rap shit was just my dream

It was a cold winter day
I was chilling out by the pool, alright
Tryna figure out what to do
With my life
It seems like everything I do is wrong, right on time
So I'll just stuff my bong
And try to drink some wine
To ease my mind
Maybe everything'll be fine

[Hook]
I'm a day dreamer, living in a nightmare
I'm a day dreamer, wonder why we're all here
Day dreaming; high, so I don't care
I'm a day dreamer, my life is like a nightmare

[Verse 2]
I need rehab, I can't take it
Say I'm depressed, I don't see it
I'm in deep, now; damn near senile
All my problems, they stress me out

Find me so high, up in smoke clouds
Walk on the sky, blowing smoke out
Then I start thinking, then I start drinking
I can't walk in the AA meeting

Know I'm addicted, my mind is afflicted
When I can't kick it, I need a one-way ticket
Out of this town, out of this world
So I start dreaming, let my legs unfurl

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm sick of my job, I'm sick of my boss
I'm sick of myself and I'm sick of my thoughts
I'm sick of this drink and I'm sick of this weed
It keeps me hurling, and down on my knees

Praying to the porcelain
Looking at the stall
Somebody wrote their name
And their number on the wall
That's when I blacked out
Either that, or I just passed out

That's when I start dreaming
About some shit I don't remember
But this ain't nothing new to me
Cause I'm a day dreamer
Fucked up

[Hook X 2]

Cause I'm a day dreamer
I'm a day dreamer
Cause I'm a day dreamer
I'm a day dreamer[Produced by Sonny Digital]

[Hook]
I said look baby I'm sorry (I told you that I'm sorry)
Shawty I can't be your Drake (I can't be your Drake)
I'm not that emotional (I never been emotional)
[?] I don't wear no cape (I never wore a cape)
I said shawty I'm sorry (I told you that I'm sorry)
Baby I can't be your man (I can't be your man)
I'm really not a [?] (I never been a [?])
I hope you understand (I know you understand)

[Verse 1]
Now some of you pussy ass niggas got a lot of these dumb hoes thinking that they wifey type
If a nigga say [?] that don't really mean [?] popping he just wanna see if you fucking right
Suck a dick with no hands do a couple handstands now you running round bitch like you a prototype
Never say we go together you just one girl that I like
Baby I don't need your number we just fucking for the night

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Shout out my nigga Drake
That's my nigga [?]
But don't compare me bitch I'll never be that nigga ho
I cannot love a bitch
I can't convert a ho
What she can do is fuck in my convertible
While you shaking and [?]
I'm getting head while I'm driving
I pull up getting noggin
She sucking and swallowing
I'm watching her smiling
She's seeing me styling
Call me solid girl
My dressing's italian

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She her booty shake like jelly
Skin soft as butter
She's a nasty motherfucker
[?]
I would never love her
Let a nigga cuff her
I woke up in the morning getting head off the covers
I didn't pay for shit
Cause I am not a trip
On somebody bitch you ought a be paying his dick
But instead I just gave the bitch a bust down
And smoke a 7 with her call that shit a touchdown

[Hook][Intro]
RIP to Eazy, I'm [?]
My bitches, they get broke it ain't no problem cause it's easy

[Bridge]
I'm spendin' money easy, like I don't really need it
The wind blowin' through it, boy make ya look so easy
A hundred bottles easy
Rollie shinin' easy
Dollars on the dime, she gon' shake it for me easy

[Hook x2]
Ballin' like it's easy
Bugatti, Lamborghini
I throw it up, she take it all
We make this shit look easy

[Verse 1]
Fuck niggas gon' hate me but these strippers love me the most
Remember me in that old school but I pulled up in that Ghost
Only street nigga that traps shit, I jumped off of that porch
Now it's bamboo on Sunday and my nigga makin' that toast
And that rolex on glow, fifty bands I blow
You say you started off on that bottom bitch, but I really started off broke
And they prayin' all on my downfall, like "Where the fuck did he go?"
Tell 'em I'm a [?] millionaire, nigga you ain't even know it
Go!

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo main bitch my side ho, we fuck ya bitch by 2
The whole crew done ran through
Bitch ain't shit special 'bout you
[?], that's real money we threw
Spend a hundred bands on Big K.O.D, they like what the fuck did they do
Spend a hundred bands on my crew, two seater no roof
Got a bad bitch in my passenger and I swear to god is she loose
We ridin' round with that [?], Ben Franklin that truth
My left pocket a fed case but fuck nigga need proof

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Niggas watchin' my pocket, bitches all on my dick
Throw ten thousand in ten minutes, that's how you get a bitch wet
I'm ridin' 'round with that sack, that bag nigga that check
I pull up at that stop light, these hoes breakin' their necks
For a UFO or [?] gold, that's two things I ain't met
That money all on that table nigga, I roll the dice and I bet
Said scared money don't make money, you niggas ain't rich yet
And I move weight like Schwarzenegger, real nigga I flex

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Bridge]E-e-Echo

[Verse 1]
You did it to yourself
Now you're all by your self
Acting like you hate me
I left because you made me
You played me to the left
Now there's nobody left
To hear your complaining
I'm gone and all you're hearin' is your own

[Hook]
E-echo!
E-e-echo!
And I'm gone
And your all alone
Can't you hear the hear the
Echo!
E-echo!
No one to hear you
There's nobody near you

[Verse 2]
It started off great
But who was to know
That love that is lost
Cannot be let go
You say it's my fault
Ok then i'll go
It's better to know
Now there's nobody to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who your with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!
And your all alone hearing your own damn

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Disgusted with trust
I trust no one no more
Just went with the flow
Found myself on the floor
When you went away
All my pain went astray
Like it's a new day
Now I have no one to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who your with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!
And your all alone
Hearing your own damn

Echo
Your own damn
E-echo
No one is near you
No one can hear you
With your own damn
Echo!
E-echo!
No one to hear you
There's nobody near you

All night long
I thought to myself
Why would I stay with you
Realized that you were the one who had issues
So why would I miss you?

No one to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who your with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!
And your all alone

Hearing your own damn echo!
It's just you and your
E-echo!
Its just you and your
I hope that yall get along
It's just you and your
Echo!
It's just you and your
E-echo!
There's no one to hear you
There's nobody near you
It's just your own damn
Echo!
Your own damn
E-echo!
Echo!
E-e-echo!
Echo
E-echo
E-e-echo

No one to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who your with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!!

Everywhere I go, the ho know me
Still wearing black we dont rock white tee

Ten grand in the club out the bar just to front

Treat her like a rope
And tie her in a knot
Hood nigga shit meet me at the travelodge
Bring some redbulls and some Trojan extra large
Work a big chop, she gon lose a lot of carbs
Make that juice box talk, man I make that pussy fart

And make her back In
I beat it for an hour
Than I rest for 10
And grab another rubber
And do it all again

Walking around looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
A Labyrinth, a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

[Hook 1: Gorilla Zoe]
I'm lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving
On and off the road
I'm lost on a road
But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm livin in a rush
I don't understand this fuss
My brain is bout to bust

[Hook 2]
I think I'm losin it
I might be losin it
I just might lose
Am I losin my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losin it?
Am I losin it?
I think I'm losin
I'm losin my mind
Am I losin it?
Am I losin it?
I think I'm losin
I'm losin my mind

[Verse 2]
I call up my girlfriend she dosen't answer
I hit the strip club and fuck with a dancer
Throwing my ones up, like I'm paying ransom
Told me I look good, she said I was handsome
So believed her, because I am lonely
Im just a loner, my life is a movie
Tonight we're just actors, and this is a sitcom
So tell me you love me, and tell me i'll get some

[Hook 1 & Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
I'm makin this money
Just to go spend it
Livin the good life
Hope nobody ends it
But who are you kidding?
Ay who are you lying to?
You know if they want you
Best believe they will find you

[Hook 1 & Hook 2][Intro]

[Hook]
You say ya man got a fountain
Boy I got a jet
You say he got money

Baby flow with me

In the restaurant, ‚ÄúExcuse me? Could you hand me my furry coat?‚Äù
And baby could you see me where a G like me can smoke?
I know it sounds ugh, but don‚Äôt take it for a joke
See my dog is from the hood & he just wants some hen & coke
Pop the hood to Hollywood
So we just doing what we want

Just took my permit, but I still got a gun

And me, I'm from the streets, I never repeat the shit I heard
Never describe the shit I saw, never complained about no loss

You tryin' to make a hit and I'm tryin' to dodge the Feds
