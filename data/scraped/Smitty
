Big booty strippers, I’m tipping

Argentina for Pepsi; Orlando All-Star
Fuck you said, bitch? Fuck you (pornstar)

I'm in my own lane, you ain't in my categor
You like a Rav 4; I’m like the Aventador
Birkin bags, man I murk them ads
When I re-up on reloaded, I'mma hurt them bad
Every shoot is hot; when I'm out, I'm spotted
They gone frame the receipt if I sign the dotted
N-N-Niggas on Banshees is speeding
Dirt bikes is out for the season
Back break wheelie and leaning
Damn, a bitch late for a meeting

Double R engine humming
Acting a fool, we dumbin’

All grey Impala, big dollas like cred tho
Where them E's at, where them P's at?
Said you need that, where my where my G's at?
Nu-nuttin less tho, watch full of crystals
Hands on that bottle, wit that bottle full of X-O
Got 2 or 3 dimes in the back-back
Got 2 or 3 rounds in that tech-tech
Bought 23's round on that S-S
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds-diamonds on my necklace

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Smitty]
Where them low ridas, where them poofs at?
Where my roof at, where my-where my roof at?
And yea I thought so, switched like I'm hot tho
Say you gettin money like me, but you not tho
Where them 4-5's, where them trey's at?
Where them K's, where my-where my K's at?
Just got those, just from the box tho
Red mark means enemies pay a lotto
And you can hear it in the back-back
The beat pounds like the sound of a mack-mack
Ay we ain't playin around nigga that's that
Diamonds on my neck, diamond-diamonds on my necklace

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Smitty]
I'mma tell you what that nigga told me
Mouth full of golds don't make you no G
Got beef wit em, now we gon see

What it's gon be?(be) Got an OZ (Z)
Drop down, top down, blowin AC
Live in the back, black tee crisp
Diamonds on my neck, diamond-diamonds on my necklace

[Hook] x3I strong arm with lyrics, watch how I prove myself
Whether shadow-boxing or full contact I maneuver well
About to have rap locked, with rhymes two to a cell
Inmate inseragated housing unit refusing the mail
Nervous, chain smoker, high blood pressure
I mastered food or court jester, lyrical sport experts
Dress for tennis, the mind of Minota with special-effect lenses
Parade of all stars, with rhymes with bullet gold cards
Done played with a full deck, as positive as my drug urine test
My rhymes do to your brain what bullets do ta flesh!
Rockin the house, the cradle, in the eighth grade
Coulda rocked the bells, but I was more comfortable in straight legs
Strong, like the contribution to rap Kane gave
My ego and my conscience refuse to share the same space
Treacherous like Naughty By Nature and Kool Moe Dee
Wouldn't catch me Half Steppin', even if I lost both feet

[Unique London]

*instrumental outro*[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Then the god stepped in
Instead of A the track should say Amen (Haha)
Drama I got it, Weezy bionic, Wayne iconic
Get up in that ass like a colonic
We don't do drive by's we do pull ups like Sonic
Don't it, remind you of greatness
Leave your ass faceless
I battle you, take your heart, and then taste it
I'm a crazy motherfucker, and so is my homies
And I promise, to make most of my moment
You boys ain't talking bout shit
Even in the bathroom you ain't talking bout shit
Shoot your ass in the leg, tell you walk it out bitch
Tommy gun on me like a Tommy outfit
I'm a, Hollygrove asshole
Bitch I'm gutta like a bad bone
Make the money do cartwheels
Footprint like a Carolina Tarheel
Just like young Mike
It's Young Money bitch we about to take flight
Weezy

[Verse 2: Smitty]
Yes, you are now rocking with the best
Evil empire, DJ EFX
Remix Mafia, 3 6, we sick, make hit records prestigious
We just, ride 'til the new budget free up
Married to this shit 10 years, no prenup
Done with the games, man put the Wii up
Meet up at the Days Inn then turn the beat up
Re-up, yea I'm trynna get a key up
Say the game locked, Wayne better get a key up
(Ugh) On the flow put the G up
Velour suit FILA, feet up 2 seater
We up in the Poconos brewing that tea up
Bet better yet ? like cheya
Cheya money long like me (yuh)
Mean sixteens that'll end your career
We are, right here mon frere
From the same label that brought you Aaliyah
Prayer, in the air one shot, one tear
Warning, these rap niggas not what they appear
Never been cheap Louis Vs on my ear
Fuck the grill rather spend 10 mil on veneers (yea)
This a hip-hop premier
Talking old school D and D like ?
And Aaliyah (yea) still on some fly shit
And tell Splash "yea homie this our shit"
The flow crack, go and get the ?
Now clip that, take it back to the projects
I obsess over trying to be the best
But if it's no struggle, then it's no progress
And that's a hard pill that I try and digest
I just kill them off soft like Wyclef
Rooms in the sky, dead men fly
These type of words make a grown man cry
(Who am I) Most hated, underrated, and debated
If we ain't talking money homie I'll see you later
Kinda faded with this thick bitch looking like Jada
Take her back to the truck, then we fuck
Then I ate her, made her nut
Got her up, now she talking 'bout payment
Baby you already know that the flow so crazy
Nothing more, nothing less
Yes, you are now rocking with the best[Verse 1: Karde]
(Got my nigga Bre, Smitty)
Niggas ain't fuckin' with the Mafia
Say you finna bust what's stoppin' ya
East side niggas whats poppin' cuh, fuck dick riding niggas just stop it bruh
Came through with Bre in the black truck, think we on a trip how we packin' stuff
Iraq shit like Pakistan, hit 'em in the chest oh that's your man
Not from the Middle East but you said I ran, trynna fuck us up oh that's yo plan
I'm thinking you probaby need a new one
When my thugs pull up ya whole crew run
My mob roll deep you a shook one
Not a game when ya head leakin' Temple Run
Make moves like Wii or a fuckin' Kinect
To get some weed hit my fuckin' connect
Gold all in my bezzle, different color charms Fruity Pebbles
Got ya dream girl in ya dream car, that's a Porsche of course I'm a fuckin' star
Got all the work in the mansion, from CT to LA expansion
Red bottoms look like my foot bloody, turn ya girl out now that bitch slutty
She want want my money, she want this dick
A smile and a wave is all she get
She wanted World Peace back when I first Metta
Looked her in the eyes and said you know better
Karde why you such an asshole, bet she still gave me the ass though
Stop it, my profit, is 2 mill, I'm too trill
You niggas don't got shit, you just get high and pop pills
Shout out to Rihanna, word around town she a bad gyal
Be my baby mama, in the bed we can burn mad cals
Always in some designer clothes, Givenchy, Versace it's mine ya know
Give two fucks about a hater, when my iPhone ring I'll see you later
Just got back from the Caribbean, her Spanish friends and they all tens
Business with pleasure that's a bad mix, that's like a lame nigga with a bad bitch
This street talk, this drug talk.. when my thugs talk, its gonna drop

[Verse 2: Smitty]
It's Bre in this bitch
Stay calm when it come to these fuck niggas
Blow up so quick don't know what hit ya
East coast chillin' yeah that's cool with me
Fine art off the Canon, gold jewelry
Ya flow tight but none of y'all niggas can fool with me
Got my chips all dressed in cheddar
Hit ya girl once beat it up then its see you later
She up in the Bentley screamin' "Bre Bre bend me"
Bank roll so large it'll never go empty
96 to 2013 Chanel clean Pimp C, and premiere still comin'
Bars so cold always got your nose runnin'
It's NIP on MIP in all black
Flights are silence with these two Gs, comin' on top nigga can't you see
Game on lock with my niggas SGT, told you that we won't stop with the luxuries
Bad red thick bitch with the diamonds B
Rap hood, I'm good for ya take your minerals B
Every nigga wanna talk about the bitches they fuck
Ya bread really needa to get to start racking up
Skinny nigga well paid get put on the wave
My heart to the Ricans, fat asses my fave
When the money come you know the girls come too
Tell Dre to let the foreign women come through
Nikes on my feet with the Bape on the tee
She said my style is street, it's hustle time no shit come free
I street talk to your girl with no I.D
This ain't the life I live, the dream you gonna see
We armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed no angel dust[Intro: DJ KaySlay]
It's that street nigga shit!!!
Smitty!!! Jae Millz!!! Mike Beck!!! Kayslay!!! Greg Street!!!
Y'all know what the fuck it is!!! Let's! Go!

[Verse 1: Smitty]
This is nothin new to me, life ain't what it used to be
Now it's all gun cocked, scared a nigga truthfully
Cock, black, assault, fast
Got, cash, cop, crash
And y'all full of shit keep the heart full of clips
Yo' pot his pot keep the spot full of bricks
No fame no game I pull a bitch
New whip blue six same color crip
And y'all lame niggas hear we on some other shit
Off white soft white as long as it's butter shit
Burn, yay, you earn, you straight
You earn, we take, you hungry, we ate
No stress one sack already done that
Call my weight Jordan (Why) because it come back
Five five for the ounce spit one stack
Cock that drop that nigga that's a comeback
Need a new hustle already done rap
Tired of the same cash so I called Dame Dash
My CD, is real, it's Smitty and Millz
Live from the ghetto why I never let go

[Verse 2: Jae Millz] (DJ KaySlay)
Papa wasn't never here O.G.'s made me grown
Mama let her baby roam and now baby holdin chrome
It don't matter who you name he can't flow like me
I petty might be aight yeah but he ain't dope as me
If you been around fam I know you notice me
Yes! One hand in the air one on the chest
It's Mr. wanna what some call me one of the best
And if they don't, it must be cause they want it to deaf
Everybody talk bullets to you give it one of them fresh
One wrong punchline will get you one through ya vest
And you ain't gotta be Hines Ward to catch
Somethin from thirty yards out fuck what ya bars 'bout
We shootin niggas like Reggie Miller did
Nah I ain't Scarface homey I'm worst, I'll kill your kids
Who doubtin me I'll do your newborn like Mike did his lil' ass from the balcony
Corny industry niggas hatin and reroutin me
But I'm a wolverine I was raised where the moutains be
Slept in the dungeon the trainin be the same
Sylvestor Stallone did before he fought Dolph Lundred
Nigga yous a pumpkin Smitty spark the lama
And nigga fuck the frontin till the cats believe that I'm a be the (Street niggga!!!)

[Verse 3: Mike Beck] (DJ KaySlay)
The hood is full of roaches the crib is so full of roaches
My livin was so atrocious so flippin we came devoted
Ask about the wrist game whip game
How I flip change make it to diamonds that glisten
I'm the shit man manuer street polluter
Peeps is beast just to eat they'll shoot ya
Politics as usual it's usual crucial
Shoot through your Red Monkey's let the shells seduce ya
I'm a, predicate cutter, better be butter
If I touch it I must get cash in a bundance
Stacks, for the hundred, pass smell the blunt scent
Get you in the car in your pockets it's your months rent
In the front big head on the horn
By the time they come check your pulse presume your dead I'm gone
Were probably on another coast new clothes another toast
New hoes with new dough move low right through those
Death points, from the hood to borderline
Take money from the hood and bought the borderline
So much more than rhyme his thoughts borderline
His brawl with this boar listen to 'em tell 'em I'm a (Street nigga!!!)[Post Hook: Mann]

All I know is this
Fuck the Politics
I'mma be a millionaire before I call it quits
You gone always see me shaded with a model bitch
I'mma Always be the Man as long as I exist Yump

[Verse 1: Mann]

Look I got it, Money in my wallet
Whip I bought it, and my bitch exotic
And I've been swimming in that aquatic
My rims looking brolic, give them niggas no option
When I Pull up, all them hoes be droolin
I ain't tripping, im just shaded im coolin
Yo bitch be hittin me like "What you doing"
And I be like "nothing, come through and smoking something"
You know whats up
She just want to be around a nigga who dope as fuck
She hang around even though she know there is no hope for us
I hit her with the "you already, knew what it was
I had fun but I'm through with it love" hahaha
I had to laugh, because the only thing I'm afters cash
From west la where them young niggas play snatch and grab
Get'cha chain ganked, pawn that thang just to make bank
Where it ain't safe, only way out is to make cake
I know how it is, I'm from the city, coming off the ave
When stars hit roscoes we don't ask for autographs
Star struck? na'll bra. Where them dollars at
I need a lot of cash, because you know just what we gotta have

[Hook: Mann]

The money The money The money The money

[Verse 2: Mann]

Calling all Gs, Calling all G's
When I was young I knew money wasn't falling off trees
Mama couldn't give 5 dollars for lunch
Never wanted to get dropped off in the front
Riding in a bucket, single parent struggling
12 years old said fuck it and started hustling
Selling dub sacks that I got from my cousin
I was in Jr High getting niggas super high
Knew what I was doing learned the hustler mentality
Loyalty needed for anyone who want to be down with me
Supply and demand, make sure you give them quality
The best is what it got to be can't give em nothing less
Now Im doing the same thing putting on for the West
Music so wet, got baddies on deck
Bang dannon all day fuck everything else
Hating on us then they playing they self
Payed 650 for the hermes belt
Thats money you'll never see like a mermaids tail
Its 2012 time to keep it real
Been doing myself feeling like fuck a deal

Don't you know I'm on some ole' fuck the world type shit?
Giving a nigga the bullet to bite with, ham-burger

Rolling with some Real Mccoy gangstas on this phat track
Again kicking that gangsta shit to put these niggas on they back
They wondered if I could kick it, motherfuckers I'ma kick this

Dropping a verse and getting them up from the get-go

So I'ma send the fucking shot to make you buckle up
And if you want some motherfucker won't you knuckle up?

Get down to the hits that's made by the Odd Squad

Going deeper than deep so you better grab your swimwear
And all your business take care

The rawest motherfucker you ever saw and that's

In other words I rips up enough for damages
But I got some little niggas in my hooptie

So slap that ass back before you get a gold slug in your motherfucker mug
Little Kilo is giving bigger niggas love

A young buck stepped up and got his motherfucking dome peeled
Shorty came real with the motherfucking hand skills

But when I'm silent I get pissed
They tried to hold a black back cause I throw up my black fist
Just call me "assassin" while I'm blasting on yo' bitch ass
I'm that sicka nigga, I can dig a ditch fast
And I can lay you six feet deep like the undertaker
Make a sick nigga wanna break a
Motherfucking neck
What did you expect from the lunatic?
Soon it gets deeper than deep
The buck boom will kick fast
Blast blast motherfuckers never stop
Dropping cops till we the last motherfuckers
In the clique, awe shit, what a sight
No motherfucking flashing lights
Fucking with the ounces, mo' bounces

Suckas wanna feel the real but they don't hear me though
Don't die
Why must I act a fucking clown?
Ten deep in the game and I came to get down

[Hook]

[Blind Rob]
I put my left foot in, my left foot out
Now I doing the hokey pokey with this thang in your mouth
My niggas known to be prone to scrape the plaque off your teeth
I know you used to have baloney but have you ever tried beef?
And it's the handicap assassin
And I be blasting
And if you don't know you better ask kid
I'm the one who gets down for mine
AKA The Fucking Man and I'll dick you all the time
And you can put that on your granny's panty
Handing out knuckle sandwiches and keeping plenty rubbers handy
My style is simple and plain mayne
None of that skiddily diddily day ah
Or jumping around and playing
Cause I gets blitzed off that Schlitz bitch but peep this
But I still kicks that ill tip, pardon me while I take this quick piss
Oooh

But it's the O double D, bitch
And we came to get down

[The Unrappable]

Saying, saying, what the fuck am I saying?

[Mr. 3-2]

Watch a nigga grab the motherfucking 12 gauge and blast you

[Hook][singing in background]

[talking]
B-Slick... Guru...

[Chorus: Smitty] - 2X
How you gon' be a killa with no shells in them tecs
You sellin dreams when you sell a cassette, and miss
Beef like delicatess', I'm Elliot Ness, it's a mess
When I tele-connect, it hits

[Guru]
Nigga, yo your pussy 'round my format bitch is mad masculine
I have to win, down in the basement with my clownies, I'm blastin it
Thoughts travel past you and
I cock back, release the speech and travel faster than
A bullet in flight, I ignite the fight
What's the purpose of the black against black or black against white
But whatever color you are, we off you quick fast punk
If you ain't actin right - so pay homage while we make the farmage
I mean far-mage - hungry like there's no food in my sto-mach
I've done it son, did it son, spit it son, I'm wit it son
Admit it son, lemme find out you kinda timid son
I didn't run, like I told you in "DWYCK"
I'm holdin my shit, other hand holdin my dick
Protectin the fort with all sorts of gats
And all sorts of hot pipes and banana clips, I stand equipped

[Chorus] - 2X

[Smitty]
Yo, how can I put it kid, as plain as can be
Ain't no braggin, just imagine, what pain it can be
Let's get it on and get this shit resolved, amigably(?)
If it's on you good as gone kid, I'm sayin if it's me
I'll undress a nigga, to a lesser figga
Gotta press a trigga (BLAOW!!) ain't messin witcha
Call shots and end the game early
At the end of the day, playa you blame-worthy
The method I use to freak it, I use it frequent
To "Scare" you "Straight" like first offenders and juvenile dilinquents
When I, talk that talk, I walk that walk amigo
It's confidence, you probably think it's a hell of an ego
Cats is askin, whose feet are you walkin in?
The multi-millionaires with mass media marketin
Displayed in a major way, my pager say, I'm bout to get paid today
Now make way

[Chorus] - 2X

[short singing]

[Chorus][Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Then the god stepped in
Instead of A the track should say Amen (Haha)
Drama I got it, Weezy bionic, Wayne iconic
Get up in that ass like a colonic
We don't do drive by's we do pull ups like Sonic
Don't it, remind you of greatness
Leave your ass faceless
I battle you, take your heart, and then taste it
I'm a crazy motherfucker, and so is my homies
And I promise, to make most of my moment
You boys ain't talking bout shit
Even in the bathroom you ain't talking bout shit
Shoot your ass in the leg, tell you walk it out bitch
Tommy gun on me like a Tommy outfit
I'm a, Hollygrove asshole
Bitch I'm gutta like a bad bone
Make the money do cartwheels
Footprint like a Carolina Tarheel
Just like young Mike
It's Young Money bitch we about to take flight
Weezy

[Verse 2: Smitty]
Yes, you are now rocking with the best
Evil empire, DJ EFX
Remix Mafia, 3 6, we sick, make hit records prestigious
We just, ride 'til the new budget free up
Married to this shit 10 years, no prenup
Done with the games, man put the Wii up
Meet up at the Days Inn then turn the beat up
Re-up, yea I'm trynna get a key up
Say the game locked, Wayne better get a key up
(Ugh) On the flow put the G up
Velour suit FILA, feet up 2 seater
We up in the Poconos brewing that tea up
Bet better yet ? like cheya
Cheya money long like me (yuh)
Mean sixteens that'll end your career
We are, right here mon frere
From the same label that brought you Aaliyah
Prayer, in the air one shot, one tear
Warning, these rap niggas not what they appear
Never been cheap Louis Vs on my ear
Fuck the grill rather spend 10 mil on veneers (yea)
This a hip-hop premier
Talking old school D and D like ?
And Aaliyah (yea) still on some fly shit
And tell Splash "yea homie this our shit"
The flow crack, go and get the ?
Now clip that, take it back to the projects
I obsess over trying to be the best
But if it's no struggle, then it's no progress
And that's a hard pill that I try and digest
I just kill them off soft like Wyclef
Rooms in the sky, dead men fly
These type of words make a grown man cry
(Who am I) Most hated, underrated, and debated
If we ain't talking money homie I'll see you later
Kinda faded with this thick bitch looking like Jada
Take her back to the truck, then we fuck
Then I ate her, made her nut
Got her up, now she talking 'bout payment
Baby you already know that the flow so crazy
Nothing more, nothing less
Yes, you are now rocking with the best[Intro: DJ KaySlay]
It's that street nigga shit!!!
Smitty!!! Jae Millz!!! Mike Beck!!! Kayslay!!! Greg Street!!!
Y'all know what the fuck it is!!! Let's! Go!

[Verse 1: Smitty]
This is nothin new to me, life ain't what it used to be
Now it's all gun cocked, scared a nigga truthfully
Cock, black, assault, fast
Got, cash, cop, crash
And y'all full of shit keep the heart full of clips
Yo' pot his pot keep the spot full of bricks
No fame no game I pull a bitch
New whip blue six same color crip
And y'all lame niggas hear we on some other shit
Off white soft white as long as it's butter shit
Burn, yay, you earn, you straight
You earn, we take, you hungry, we ate
No stress one sack already done that
Call my weight Jordan (Why) because it come back
Five five for the ounce spit one stack
Cock that drop that nigga that's a comeback
Need a new hustle already done rap
Tired of the same cash so I called Dame Dash
My CD, is real, it's Smitty and Millz
Live from the ghetto why I never let go

[Verse 2: Jae Millz] (DJ KaySlay)
Papa wasn't never here O.G.'s made me grown
Mama let her baby roam and now baby holdin chrome
It don't matter who you name he can't flow like me
I petty might be aight yeah but he ain't dope as me
If you been around fam I know you notice me
Yes! One hand in the air one on the chest
It's Mr. wanna what some call me one of the best
And if they don't, it must be cause they want it to deaf
Everybody talk bullets to you give it one of them fresh
One wrong punchline will get you one through ya vest
And you ain't gotta be Hines Ward to catch
Somethin from thirty yards out fuck what ya bars 'bout
We shootin niggas like Reggie Miller did
Nah I ain't Scarface homey I'm worst, I'll kill your kids
Who doubtin me I'll do your newborn like Mike did his lil' ass from the balcony
Corny industry niggas hatin and reroutin me
But I'm a wolverine I was raised where the moutains be
Slept in the dungeon the trainin be the same
Sylvestor Stallone did before he fought Dolph Lundred
Nigga yous a pumpkin Smitty spark the lama
And nigga fuck the frontin till the cats believe that I'm a be the (Street niggga!!!)

[Verse 3: Mike Beck] (DJ KaySlay)
The hood is full of roaches the crib is so full of roaches
My livin was so atrocious so flippin we came devoted
Ask about the wrist game whip game
How I flip change make it to diamonds that glisten
I'm the shit man manuer street polluter
Peeps is beast just to eat they'll shoot ya
Politics as usual it's usual crucial
Shoot through your Red Monkey's let the shells seduce ya
I'm a, predicate cutter, better be butter
If I touch it I must get cash in a bundance
Stacks, for the hundred, pass smell the blunt scent
Get you in the car in your pockets it's your months rent
In the front big head on the horn
By the time they come check your pulse presume your dead I'm gone
Were probably on another coast new clothes another toast
New hoes with new dough move low right through those
Death points, from the hood to borderline
Take money from the hood and bought the borderline
So much more than rhyme his thoughts borderline
His brawl with this boar listen to 'em tell 'em I'm a (Street nigga!!!)
