[Intro]
Suwoo business on mines, blood, Bompton Inglewood, nigga. This the mothafuckin' Woo mix, on Piru!

[Hook: YG]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Verse 1]
(Woo woo!) Where I'm from you hear that, the wolves come out
Like on Bloods, what's happenin'?
(Woo woo!) Cause when it's on, we're front line
Ain't no bicken, the whole hood get brackin'
I'm from the bottoms where [?] get chest highs
Before Worldstar, head ups weren't televised
Crack sales with shoe box deposits
Homie lived outside and the cleaners was the closet
Work got swallowed, enemies got knocked off
Giver to the [?] half the nigga's top gone
Work, sold for it, young niggas flocked for it
I represent Inglewood and the whole corner pop for it
Enemies all foul, snitch when you bust at 'em
But they the enemy, fuck it, still bust at 'em
Original young gangsters, the ones with the say-so
We bicken back being bool, but on Bloods, we don't play though

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
It's Mack 10, Blood, what it do
I'm from the 400 block of the Q
I put the Wood on the map, niggas say what they want
But thank me for puttin' the Su in the Woo
And all I think about is money, nigga rollin' in that fast shit
What's the next move, homie, how we get the cash, yeah?
Water in that soft white, get to rockin'
I'm a D-boy, never did no flockin'
Real Inglewood nigga with a real fuckin' attitude
Blood had a 9 but the chopper is a fatter tool
It's who bangin' so we shootin' out of Rovers
And them 223 shells be knockin' shit over
Lay 'em down, spray the whole situation
You with this gangsta shit, throw up your affiliation
I wrote the book and all the rules
I can act a fuckin' fool but I'm bicken back being bool

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Do anybody remember the CPD?
Look who outlast 'em, that's that TTP
Arabian spruce, the cranberry's the juice
That we drink with that vodka cause they don't make [?]
The first platinum nigga with some big red plaques
Then Mack-10 hit the scene, that nigga had me backed
And I kept pushin', drinkin', smokin' kush and
Puttin' money back in my hood and rollin' bushes
Now who the fuck would say that? Find out where you lay at
Bring it right up to your porch, your home, stay back
Nigga I'm the unofficial mayer, a surreptitious player
And I'll burn my wallet up before I pay her, mothafucka

Bumpin' BlackSTREET, treated like a athlete
Life ain't a track meet (no) it's a marathon
Fuck the cemetery that a nigga get buried on
We be clubbing till the day we die
Nigga ask the bartender if you think we lie
But if you think we high, nigga think again
Cause when it's sink or swim
You got to think to win
And if I drink this Hen'
Everybody will know it
Cause I ain't going for it
So pray to the Lord that I don't pull out
Cuss out and bust out

And I got 'em by the dozen
When they buzzin', quick to say fuck your husband
This is for my niggas locked away
Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date
But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great
As soon as I get a word we can rush the safe
Fuck them license plates because life is great
It don't matter if you're rich and your folks ain't straight

No matter how many niggas say we ain't the shit, bitch

Gotta love this pup shit
Passing the mud shit
Pockets on flood shit
OG lyrical blood shit
I don't rent I buy shit
Niggas jealous of my shit
You unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit
While you're rooting and recruiting
Nigga 6-8 whooping
I was in the hood shooting cause I had the wife whooping
I come from padres gold in oversized jars
I past up strife and got star awards
No time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing
Came out the substation to the hip hop nation
The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga
Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga
Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it
I keep pushing, don't quit it
Don't stop till I get it

Freaky gyration is close to fornication...
Yeah uh-huh, Ice Cube, Westside Connection
Know how we do?
We puttin' it down, constantly
Get your ass up and hurraFeaturing Ice Cube W.C

(Mack 10)
Microphone check 1-0 from the west coast beller and tella
I cuss like a sailor, when you see her shes a gonna
Moved to California blew the bitch up put the gangsta twist on
Her sunny southern cal it never snows
Niggas yellin' hey's and ho's, we jumpin out of 64's
When it comes to the gun play, we vets
It's west coast for life no crews, only sets

(Ice cube)
It's the dog breathin' through the smog
I'm a hog of this gangster shit
Don of the clique
All you suckas want to dis the pacific
But you buster niggas never get specific
Used to love her, mad cause we fucked her
Pussy whipped bitch with no Common Sense
Hip hop started in the west
Ice Cube bailin' through the east without a vest

(W.C)
Now as I look to my riz-zight and to my left
I see motherfuckers staring like they wanna step
So I'm grabbin' my rusty screwdriver
In case I got to cut ya deeper than Vanessa Del Rio's vagina
Find a-notha crew of niggas that can fuck with this
Lyrical bully, given verbal bruises to crews, fool
You must be on dick, dope and dynamite
How you figure, speed on before you get peed on, nigga

(Mack 10)
Fool what side is you
Red or the blue
Wild as the L.A. zoo, it's round two
I ignite, grab the mic, tight strike like a rattle
Bringin' rhymes and nines to the mutherfuckin' battle
So sun down to sun up, run up with my gun up
All brakes get to pumpin'
They know a nigga dumpin'
You dred like a rasta when I lock like a terrier
Mack 10, the nigga with the heat that'll bury ya

(Ice Cube)
Oh ah,oh ah, do a walk by and watch everybody die
Niggas into gangs thangs and narcotics
Freak bitches, riches, and hydrolics
Pull heat, knock you off your feet
Clear the whole block, both sides of the street
Even crips and bloods hear my thuds
Fee fie foe fum: hey nigga, where you from? (Westside!)

(W.C.)
Fuck all you niggas, I'm yellin'
This is M.A.A.D. circle to the fullest everybody 187um
Toones play the piano, fuck a battle
I'm socking rappers like mad man Santiago
Cause you niggas ain't impressin' me, plus you singin' big red records
So nigga, fuck what you tellin' me
Sit down junior, you couldn't see me if you wanted to
Look ya'll, it's Mack 10, Cube and the "W"

(Mack 10)
I just had a scrap for the neighborhood
Inglewood sterotype
Got to deal with the hype
Known to kick back with the fat sack, fuck that
Where my gat at? These niggas trippin off my Bulls hat
About to let loose with the chrome trey-deuce
Five shots and I put holes in your bandana
I push a Benz, you still rollin' Gs
So nigga miss me with that set trip
And start slangin' keys

(Ice Cube)
When I say gitchy-gitchy
Niggas get bitchy-bitchy cause they heard of the
Natural born murderah
I'm like Frankenstein, it's spankin' time
Layin' in the sunshine
With only one nine
So who wants to bust with the never rust
Goin' platinum plus, every time I cuss
So fuck the whole world black
Niggas better hope I don't grow my jheri-curl back

(W.C.)
Stepper, murderah steppin' out a Chevrolet
Sportin' a beanie like Marvin Gaye
Stalkin', walkin' in my big black Chuck's
Standin' tall in your freestyle session, holdin' my balls
I'm peepin' game like a ref in '95
Cause niggas be foul and bitin' other niggas' styles
But if you're bitin' this, you better bring a dentist
Cause sucking these balls're give your ass lockjaw, fools

(Mack 10)
Which way shall I go, nigga, what should I do?
Should I bang with the red or should I truce with the blue?
Should I rock dope beats, and grab the mic and stay down?
Or should I shoot out of town and flip this pound?
Shit. I never knew that my nuts'd get bigger
Checkin' major figures, I'm hangin with platinum niggas
It's Mack 10 and I'm Inglewood swingin'
No time for bangin'
But still got my khakis hangin'

(Ice Cube)
Fuck one love, it's the bloody glove, killin' honkey hoes
Leaving blood stains on Broncos
In a Hertz rental, I drive on the 405
Is he dead or alive?
Mother-fuck court, took another snort
Jumpin' over chairs as I run through the airport
So I can catch a flight away from the drama
Number 32 chillin' in the Bahamas

(W.C.)
Shucky ducky quack niggas ain't knowin' how to act
Sucka ducks play the back
Niggas used to dis, but now it's turning around
And like Brandy, motherfuckers wanna be down
With this west coast rap game I can give a fuck
If you wasn't down at first you can buck these nuts
Transformers get stole on boom (BOOOM)
Get the picture killa Cali, home of the body bags, nigga

Westside (x2)[Produced by Mannie Fresh]

[Verse 1: Mack 10]
I jump out the blocks like ready! set! go!
Check all my traps and dodge the fed co
I'm all about the mix like a fuckin collage
And out the garage, is a Bentley Onage
With the brains blowed out, so the sun's beamin
I got the jackers drooling, and the hoes fiendin
And since I'm Westside Connected got the streets on hype
I got big deals, big skrill, big wheels, big pipes..

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Twenty-inchers roll - go and get these hoes
Picky hoes wanna roll with my niggaroles
But be a freak about it, and I'mma see about it
Speak about it, no bitch I'mma be about it
Who want some of this, West running this
Mack 10 with the playboy bunny bitch
She's a dummy bitch - with a money pit?
You broke ass niggas can't even stomach this

[Verse 3: W.C.]
What that connect like? Nigga like three time felon
Six-double-0-west nigga selling rich Ru-bellin'
Throw it up, hold it up, guns bust fo' fingers up
Two twisted in the middle with the thumb cuffed
Chevy Nash and dippin the ass and king of the zaggin
Fo'-fo' mackin and coat taggin
Dub the hood phtanom I'm in a blue phantom
In front of the club and valet, do for talk and mack 'em trick

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]
What is it like, tossin' them hoes?
And rollin' them fools on them vogues
Flossin' them chains, we doin' big thangs
And bustin' on punks at close range
This the way us gangstas roll
Sit back and watch as it unfolds
Bitches and suckers stunt so cold
This is the life we chose..

[Verse 4: Mack 10]
Dope money and rapping shit I'm all with it
And all I know is the street so that's how I spit it
Chickenhawk see a bird, then I gotta get it
So if ya hood come up short, then I probably did it
And if lil' momma thick then I gotta hit it
The trojan gotta be a magnum for me to fit it
If it was sherm on a stick then I probably lit it
The red beam is on your wig so I probably split it

[Verse 5: Ice Cube]
To all them bitches that think they bootylicious
I think they nutritious - I think they do dishes
I'm makin three wishes, or takin' they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches
Ego maniac - little homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an asshole and it ain't an act
So take a hit of that - and remember that
Where my motherfuckin niggas and my bitches at?

[Verse 6: W.C.]
Tree-i-ick! I'm Dub-C, the rider with the clique
And like a dragon it's nathin' but fire when I spit
And I can't shake these ghetto ways
A street rich nigga eatin a bag of Lays
And rubber bands and braids
From the turf for the side, rings an ambulance
Where we keep the pistols smoking just like Afghanistan
It's gangsta the killa - the dope dealer
Back for mo' figgas - so trick bow down and po' the liquor bitch

[Hook 2X]

[Mack 10: 2X]
It's plain to see, you can't change me
Cause I'mma be "Connected for Life"

[Outro: Mack 10]
Yeah!, West Connect gang for life
Butch Cassidy, Mannie Fresh you a fool for this beat, boy
Uh, uh, uh[Intro]
Blaze up (Oh yeah!)
World wide, don't stop don't stop
West side, don't stop
Mack 10 with Tha Dogg Pound
Yeah and the hits don't stop (Sucka)
Hey, Daz, check this out, dog

[Verse 1: Mack 10]
Now when I come to ya'll hood, ya'll watch my back
And when ya come to Inglewood I'm a front you a sack
So we can grind and get away with the cash like a caper
Cause it ain't about the set-trip, it's all about the paper
Made the poverty cease, on the rise like yeast
A pavé ‘lex piece, and I keep my khaki's creased
Mack 10 is the lick, and ya know what my set be
Connect gang, nigga, from the west, where the best be

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
It ain't no questions asked, you down to blast for me?
Down to ride for me? Down to die for me?
I come through for these sucka-ass niggas who rep
Come creepin' up on shorty slowly, show him death
Pull out the Mack 90 automatic for static
Blast a couple of niggas, leave 'em all panicked
And we swerve and hit the curb, smoke some herb
We came up too much, too tough, and too rough

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
We in the war zone where the war's on, where ya gun, nigga?
Show 'em where you're from, nigga, ridin'-ass young nigga
Arsenel equipped, hot enough to scorch
With the double fours on the hip rolling with the force
He's out to catch a body
Talking, 'bout I thought this was a gangsta party
Now he's walking around salty as the sea
Talking 'bout what's jumpin?
I'm about to get the pump to pumping and start dumping on something

[Hook]
Fuck you over there, party over here
And if you wanna trip, we got the straps near
Cause niggas like us do platinum every year
And if I ruled this sphere [your shit'd disappear]
Now everybody in the house, throw your dubs in the air
And wave 'em all around like ya just don't care
It's worldwide and dope, so, nigga, act like ya savvy
Mack 10 and Tha Pound cooking nothing but the cavi

[Verse 4: Mack 10]
I'm servin' niggas like a host with the pound, so take a toast
Dog, this west coast and our shit bump the most
Cause vine to vine I swing through the woods of Ingle
And everything I make, fuck around and be a single
From the hoo-bangin' hits, to the yes, yes, ya'lls
Now all down my halls, got plaques on my walls
We might slow the roll, sit back and still kick it
But the shit don't stop 'til we hit a meal ticket

[Verse 5: Daz Dillinger]
I'll be goddamned, I'm in it for a meal ticket
And the goal's successful I don't know who to prove a show
Usual swerve a corner and hit a block back-to-back
I don't know, it's like that, where the gang-bangers hang at
They say, "Daz, you a rider?"
I reply with, "Boy, hell yeah, I'm a rider!"
From the east side of Long Beach to the west side of Inglewood
On a cash mission bailing hood to hood

[Verse 6: Kurupt]
Once upon a time in the early stages of my life
Sacrifice, out for the loot shaking niggas like dice
Forever and a day, say what you say
On the mic I display, Philly to LA
I've been all over from Crenshaw and Imperial
To 108th, I'm sure Mack got my back
It's all about mashing, cash and heat in the stash
When you're in the neigborhood of assassins
What you say?

[Hook]

[Outro]
What do you consider fun?
(That's the bomb, that's the bomb)
All day night, and all night long
(That's the bomb, that's the bomb)
When you wake up in the morning and you start to yawn
(That's the bomb, that's the bomb)
All day night, and all day long
(That's the bomb, that's the bomb)
C'mon, c'mon
Yeah, dub S.C.G
D.P.G.C
Take a picture, trick
Take a picture, trick
Take a picture, trick
It might make ya rich
West side!

Wait a minute, that ain't how the West Coast rock nigga!

Hell Yeah!!!
Foe Life

Mack 10:
Nigga, Westside

[Verse 1]
Mack 10, nutty as they come leave 'em face down
And numb from the waist down
It's a Sunday a gun day
Rollin' down a one way
In my 'lac front and back
Over train tracks
On yak and herb nigga swerve
It get's on my nerves, banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
What you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
Comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
But niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'mma vet you can bet
That I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
Everybody run when I bust a cap
Puttin' Inglewood up on the map
Look at what I do when I pull my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
Bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

[Hook]
Foe life, foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes
Foe life, foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes

[Verse 2]
Khacki suit ski mask is my attire
With my luck cut my chucks on the barbed wire
Fool where ya keep the rims and tires
'fo yo' life expires, I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler
A lot of stiches in the ass, blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
Caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand, your Honor I'mma changed man
So please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go? and if he say no
I'mma have to say bitch get out the car slow and leave ya fuckin' dough
Cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
Let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Call 911 there's a son of a bitch on the roof
Yarned up in his birthday suit
(Mack 10 to the rescue)
My momma wanna know why I do what I do
Cause I'm superman superbad supermad superfly
Fool you can die
There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
And I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway
'bout to buck you down with this throw away
With no serial number it's the summer
Where niggas die, it's hotter than July
You better stay low fo' you get a halo
Plus wings and a gown when I come around
So take 10 paces
And try to guess the color of my shoelaces

[Hook][Hook]
Niggas wanna fuck with me
That's why I gots to bang on you
Hater's wanna fuck with the g's
That's why we gots bang on you
Niggas wanna fuck with me
That's why I gots to bang on you
Hater's wanna fuck with the g's
That's why I gots bang on you

[ verse-Ganxta Ridd ]
I say fuck them all when I bang them on some
From Inglewood to my city of Carson
Through every hood you should be bangin more often
Is your life more then what it is costin
Chicken hawker shit talken dogg barker
Ghost the scene the snatch of the nath watcher
The cock it down blood walker collar blocker
Never throw it up I through down with the wreath rock
SOO WOO set ride on the left put my flag on my
Shoulder so it lays on my chest
The dime piece put the "I" in finess but you can bless
That chrome while I bless my fit
It's on tell these 5th niggas its on p-funk I funk or no funk at all
Ganxta Ridd Mack 10 with the flamedarin

[Hook]
[Mack 10]
Uh HUH

[Verse Mack 10]

Slang blowin in a drive jack foe moe figgaz
Walked in the party more flamed then a arson
Cuz the QSI caught a link with the Carson
I'm Gangsta, you ain't tried it don't knock it
Sag when I feel flag in my right pocket
The West been G'z it ain't a new style
And the Boo Yaa more Samoans then a luau
I fucks with 'em cuz we from the same side
And who ever got hit with the K flame died
Always been a rida always stood up
Damu niggas and bitches throw yo hood up (SOO WOO)
Get it how you live if you tamper with the sack
I go to war over crack like Bush and Iraq (ha ha)
It's mack 10 nigga hoo bangin affiliate
Stay gangsta all the time and fuck who ain't feelin it

[Hook]

[Verse-Gangxta Ridd]
I stay flamed up ritual keep the dickies original
Authorized to smash through a gang funeral
With the G.A.W.T.T.I. belt buckle the west chuckle
My bumpy knuckles can't stop my hustle
They puzzle how the hen get guzzled
They tumble tryin to fade through the muscle
They in trouble when the mind go humble
The debris from the rubble got the whole ben doubled
Where they at, there they go gangsta shit
Where you from here we go gangsta hit
The rap scholar scrap brawler burgandy maroon
Neva visualize unless it go boom
G.A.W.T.T.I. get teflan boss of all dons
Always outnumbered but never outdone
Niggas don't want to march unless we a million
Let me p-funk it Westside and make don

[Hook x's 3](Intro)
Geah
Hoo-Bangin in the house c'mon
Geah
Eihthype in the house c'mon
Geah
And I'm representin
Real Compton City G's on this one
My nigga [??] in the house
We gon set it off like this

(Verse 1)
Y'all niggas wanna toss on me
Throw sum
Get ready for the hot one here it come
Y'all scream like bitches scheme my riches
Too suspicious my Glock rocks to your jaw
Nigga just too vicious land of the lost
Who's the boss get tossed have you seen her
My Nina, she's catchin a misdemeanor
My rep gets bigger my finger on the trigger
I cocks the hammer back like 'fucks you nigga!'
I let loose shells fly like the [?spruise-goose?]
Push weight protects mine, much juice
I hoo-bangs with a gang and slangs caine
Fuck what you tryin to get nigga, it's my thang!
[??] cops more white and hit claims
I serves everything from white to mary jane
I'm hittin the one times with a fake last thing
Just to keep my ass on the streets, in the game, it's automatic

(Chorus)
I represent the hoodrats and the B.G's
The niggas on the corner whop white to make cheese
If you want some then niggas bring static
It's automatic

(Verse 2)
You need to get at me, I'm the G
Locin and provokin dips blocks with cavi
Search a ki' cross the street and smash out
The '63 bounce back to the same route
You fools best get the fuck off my cold tales
Gang tales of how the fuckin dead body smells
Late night horror shows in jail cells
Represent where you from no one to tell
Life ain't nuthin but the hood and snaps
Hoodrats carry work with straps in they laps
Quarter niggas with nicknames play craps
Enemies tryin to cross the front line
Get capped nuthin but escape, uh
Second flat my gat let loose like 'Rat-a-tat-tat'
The underground hero guess y'all is back
My custom, my khaki suit and a blue cap, automatic

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I make it difficult for a nigga to find me
Crazy-ass Hoo-Bangin G's behind me
You're fucked up for that last time fo' sho'
Now you know, two in your door, four to the floor
Any nigga wanna bring it-bring
I guarantee your ass will hear the Glock sing
Quick to hit out like [name] the street king
Shells ricochet up your body, ping ping
Eazy don't come to [??] pound
West to the chest

You know we're the best
The WEST (westside)
YES!
WESTSIDE!
GeahYeah, yeah, yeah

Verse One:

Saturday morning at the crack of sunrise
Thank the man upstairs for lettin me open my eyes
It's a whole new game for me like T-Lee
It's nine-seven now and I'mma stay sucka free
Thinkin about all my homeboys behind bars
As I crease up my khakis and lace up my stars
And everthang is straight I'm in the full zone
Gettin paper every day, it's all I'm trippin on
Cause ain't nothin like a ride in Californ-ia
With the top back, rollin on a hot sunny day
It's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin all the rookies
With a pocket full of cookies
And mashin to the backyard boogie

Get yo' boogie on [repeat 3X]
And then we comin wit that

Chorus:

Backyard boogie oogie oogie (yeah)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's all about that)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (unh)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's the backyard boogie) [repeat 3X]
Backyard boogie oogie oogie [repeat 2X]

Verse Two:

Now just throw yo hands up high in the sky
Representin where you from cause it's West till I die
Put it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth
Been a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf
So I bails in the party, everythang is cool
It's niggas in the hood I ain't seen since high school
And everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues
Crips, Damus, and other clicks and crews
Just gettin they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin loose
It kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce
I'm even kickin back, and I'm usually chicken hawkin
The bloods shootin dice, and the crips are C walkin
Now the party is jumpin, and the crowd's gettin bigger
Looked up and saw four hoes to every nigga
And it's off the hook, got ya grindin and humpin
Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin

(Unh, straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
And we comin with that)

Chorus

Verse Three

Now it's out of control, and everywhere you look
Ain't nothin but real niggas, the bustas got shook
And everybody left with the whole hustla bang
And Daisy Dukes and khakis do seem to be the thang
You choose or you lose while you conversatin
Enough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin
I want homegirl over there in red
Cause Baby Got Backs like Mix-a-Lot said
When I keep my composure, kick back like a pro
Cause Mack one-oh just refuse to save a ho
But it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key
Cause she gonna lead a backyard boogie with me
(Get yo' boogie on, yeah
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood, pause
Get yo' backyard boogie on)

Chorus

Straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
Mackness, mackness, unh!
Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on, nigga get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on baby, pause
Get yo' backyard boogie on
Gangstas don't dance we boogie
Niggas run out and get yo' cookies
Gangstas don't dance we boogie
Mack 10 ain't no motherfucker rookie
Backyard boogie oogie oofie [repeat 8X][Hook]
Niggas wanna fuck with me

That's why we gots bang on you
Niggas wanna fuck with me

Hater's wanna fuck with the g's
That's why I gots bang on you

[ verse-Ganxta Ridd ]
I say fuck them all when I bang them on some
From Inglewood to my city of Carson
Through every hood you should be bangin more often
Is your life more then what it is costin
Chicken hawker shit talken dogg barker
Ghost the scene the snatch of the nath watcher
The cock it down blood walker collar blocker
Never throw it up I through down with the wreath rock
SOO WOO set ride on the left put my flag on my
Shoulder so it lays on my chest
The dime piece put the "I" in finess but you can bless
That chrome while I bless my fit
It's on tell these 5th niggas its on p-funk I funk or no funk at all
Ganxta Ridd Mack 10 with the flamedarin
Piru 3 street yall ain't ready for this

[Hook]
[Mack 10]
Uh HUH
Eyes forward
Huh

[Verse Mack 10]
Yall don't understand I bang on ho niggas
Slang blowin in a drive jack foe moe figgaz
Walked in the party more flamed then a arson
Cuz the QSI caught a link with the Carson
I'm Gangsta, you ain't tried it don't knock it
Sag when I feel flag in my right pocket
The West been G'z it ain't a new style
And the Boo Yaa more Samoans then a luau
I fucks with 'em cuz we from the same side
And who ever got hit with the K flame died
Always been a rida always stood up
Damu niggas and bitches throw yo hood up (SOO WOO)
Get it how you live if you tamper with the sack
I go to war over crack like Bush and Iraq (ha ha)
It's mack 10 nigga hoo bangin affiliate
Stay gangsta all the time and fuck who ain't feelin it

[Hook]

[Verse-Gangxta Ridd]
I stay flamed up ritual keep the dickies original
Authorized to smash through a gang funeral
With the G.A.W.T.T.I. belt buckle the west chuckle
My bumpy knuckles can't stop my hustle
They puzzle how the hen get guzzled
They tumble tryin to fade through the muscle
They in trouble when the mind go humble
The debris from the rubble got the whole ben doubled
Where they at, there they go gangsta shit
Where you from here we go gangsta hit
The rap scholar scrap brawler burgandy maroon
Neva visualize unless it go boom
G.A.W.T.T.I. get teflan boss of all dons
Always outnumbered but never outdone
Niggas don't want to march unless we a million
Let me p-funk it Westside and make don

[Hook x's 3][Intro]
Suwoo business on mines, blood, Bompton Inglewood, nigga. This the mothafuckin' Woo mix, on Piru!

[Hook: YG]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Verse 1]
(Woo woo!) Where I'm from you hear that, the wolves come out
Like on Bloods, what's happenin'?
(Woo woo!) Cause when it's on, we're front line
Ain't no bicken, the whole hood get brackin'
I'm from the bottoms where [?] get chest highs
Before Worldstar, head ups weren't televised
Crack sales with shoe box deposits
Homie lived outside and the cleaners was the closet
Work got swallowed, enemies got knocked off
Giver to the [?] half the nigga's top gone
Work, sold for it, young niggas flocked for it
I represent Inglewood and the whole corner pop for it
Enemies all foul, snitch when you bust at 'em
But they the enemy, fuck it, still bust at 'em
Original young gangsters, the ones with the say-so
We bicken back being bool, but on Bloods, we don't play though

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
It's Mack 10, Blood, what it do
I'm from the 400 block of the Q
I put the Wood on the map, niggas say what they want
But thank me for puttin' the Su in the Woo
And all I think about is money, nigga rollin' in that fast shit
What's the next move, homie, how we get the cash, yeah?
Water in that soft white, get to rockin'
I'm a D-boy, never did no flockin'
Real Inglewood nigga with a real fuckin' attitude
Blood had a 9 but the chopper is a fatter tool
It's who bangin' so we shootin' out of Rovers
And them 223 shells be knockin' shit over
Lay 'em down, spray the whole situation
You with this gangsta shit, throw up your affiliation
I wrote the book and all the rules
I can act a fuckin' fool but I'm bicken back being bool

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Do anybody remember the CPD?
Look who outlast 'em, that's that TTP
Arabian spruce, the cranberry's the juice
That we drink with that vodka cause they don't make [?]
The first platinum nigga with some big red plaques
Then Mack-10 hit the scene, that nigga had me backed
And I kept pushin', drinkin', smokin' kush and
Puttin' money back in my hood and rollin' bushes
Now who the fuck would say that? Find out where you lay at
Bring it right up to your porch, your home, stay back
Nigga I'm the unofficial mayer, a surreptitious player
And I'll burn my wallet up before I pay her, mothafucka

[Hook][Intro]
Welcome to California
Remix (echo)

[Verse 1 - Mack 10]
Uh Westcoast
Mack 10, Sly Boogy and the rest of the homies, look...

See I was raised at the gutter
And no matter what happened I got that raw cane & water
I ain't dependin' on rappin'
And I ain't wit the disrespect, watch ya mouth when ya yappin
I grab the homies and some bullies, hit ya block and start clappin
And I got so much aqua, my traps got floods on it
Gettin' that rubber band money and who cares if Bloods is on it
Mack 10, one of the few West Coasters to shine
And most of them got the mainstream, the hood is mine

[Verse 2 - Jayo Felony]
Man, I'm quick to tell a killer that I'm iller than he is
See, and I'm a G since it's me and my peeps, please
Look I'm the quickest no stitches, hit switches
And I love these witches that be gobblin' snobbishness
We takin' wrist watches, we be plottin' on change main
Why did I hit you up? Homie this is the gang thang
Can't hang with us gorillas, main, you just an orangutan
Sly and Bullet Loco gone bring these killers PAIN!

[Verse 3 - Sly Boogy]
Right, aight, hold up, trip (ha ha!)
Me and my niggas came to blow up shit (yeah)
And show these niggas how to flow that spit (yeah)
And quit actin' like some ho-ass tricks (Sly Boogy)
Fool, you know who the hell it is (yeah)
I'm clickin' up wit all my cousins and relatives
And you could roll wit us and rep yo block
And we could show these motherfuckers how the West Coast rock
So come on

[Hook - Butch Cassidy]
Everybody all around the world (yeah)
All the little baby boys and girls (alright)
Can't sleep cause they wanna know what's goin' on in California
All the seeds all across the globe
People comin' from coast to coast
For the show cause they wanna know what's goin' on in California

[Verse 4 - E-40]
Talk to me, I talk back, ain't no need to explain
Y'all know my name
Y'all know who this is rappin' over this steel trap
Y'all know it's the man wit the slang
Use no pedal when pushin' that cane
Everything that I ever sold in the street it was top grade
Magazines, three mics, sprinkle truth in the game, spit the venom
Every rapper got a little E-40 up in em
Every rapper off the heezy fo sheezy
I thought you plot 'em wit Jigga down
For shit got down

[Verse 5 - Kurupt]
Switches, bitches, chrome deep dishes
Impalas, pop collars and pop collar bones
It's California, Gangstaville, in ya mouth, all up on ya
Cologne, you California
I'm Chuck All Stars, chronic sack, skull hat, Nissan truck
Not to give a fuck, Kurupt
86 gang bang, World War 3
Thunder Dome, Crenshaw, Chemical Ali
California nigga!

[HOOK]

[Verse 6 - Crooked I]
The women hop in the whip
They love the way the speakers be subbin' in eight places
I represent Cali like Governor Gray Davis
On roller coaster rims, I own my own company pal
I'm slangin' spinners, how you lovin' me now
In L.A. you gotta be do or die in junior high
He's Sly Boogy, I'm Crooked I and we ride - you know?
And I'm Death Row, heartless and lethal
You seen Menace to Society, I should start in the sequel
Yeeah

[Verse 7 - Roscoe]
Blaze up the sticky dro, raise up the '64
Sittin' low at the liquor store
He's better than generous, inconsiderate
On a shwe wit a cigarette
You know that nigga Young Roscoe rollin' in the Cadillac
Rag on these (on these)
I got my Khakillac saggin' wit the crease
And everybody wanna know like, "what's up wit Sco?"
It's Y.A. Killafornia!

[Verse 8 - 2Pac]
Know for doin' scandalous deeds, no handlin' me
And nah it ain't the drugs, it's the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rapid delivery is automatic, lettin' niggas have it
I been labelled as a thug nigga
Since they don't sell my shit to white folks, ship it to the drug dealers
And catch a, catch a nigga worldwide
A fucking Mob Figga, West Coast who ride

[HOOK]

(Outro)

We hope you have enjoyed your stay (echo)

Aiight One O this E Feezee, I gotta I gotta
Thank my math teacher Count Dracula
For just teachin' a brother to you know

What about you?

Verse 1 (Mack)
You see I can't stop I won't stop
'til I check a mil I need a super bad bitch
And a house on the hill
365 7days I believe crack pays
My estates been guarded by pit bulls and AK's
I'm straight cookin' them thangs
Movin' weight like I should
Cause a nigga livin' good
Don't mean he went Hollywood
Dog I practice my craft
So each year I get better
To stay ghetto and clever
But be richer than ever

(E-40) Fonzerelli man I thought you was a rebel
I am but tell me this then
Why you move up out the ghetto (the ghetto)
Mothafucka I am the ghetto
I beg yo pardon
Nigga I was grindin' tryin to take off niggas heads
Flossin' & fuckin' hoes when you was in kindergarten
Nigga this ain't Lenny and Squiggy
This E-Feezee & Mack Teezee
Fuckin' with Italian Romaine pasta chicken Tortellini
Thirty odd six custodian, with the scope
Far from Nickelodeon no shit no joke
Southern Cali up North see we be rollin'
Make a bitch purchase a gun
Report it stolen
Plead the 5th but don't snitch
No case cause they're po po
And they mami know that 12 gage equipment can be traced
Stand on ya bunions
Nigga don't try to get caught in his drawers
Cause them 2.2.3's be penetratin' through walls
Plus I got warrants and shit
Didn't pay child support
Thinkin' about skippin' town
Movin' to Shreveport
Bitch

Chorus
(Mack 10) You see I can't stop I won't stop
'til I check a mil'
I need a super bad bitch and a house on the hill
(E-40) From L.A. to the Yay see we be rollin'
Make a bitch purchase a gun report it stolen
(Mack 10)You see I can't stop I won't stop
'til I check a mil'
I need a super bad bitch and a house on the hill
(E-40) See you my dude right
That mean we pa'tnas in crime
It's Forty Fonzarelli and Mack Dime (Mack Dime) Bitch

Verse 2
(Mack 10) Forty I'm the one bro that's in the mix like gumbo
Now how can I stay humble
And make feddy by the bundle
Marv said we got bigger triggas
Mack we got bigger figures
Now throw the top back on the 'Rarri
And bang gears on these niggas
And watch what the money show you
About niggas that don't know you
Busters is gone hate
Real G's is happy foe ya
It's Mack Dime on the grind
Fool it's my time to shine
Now would you niggas kick back
And let me get mine
(E-40) Causin' havoc sparkin' up chaos
Bringin' the ruckus heavy metal heaters
Mobb, under buckets
If ya can't beat us
Then join us get on the team
Streetsweepers grenades rifles
And M1 car beams
Dice games craps bets over car titles
Pink slips cash money
Watchin' out for rival gang members beefin'
Bad weather but it all boils down to
Who got the most paper

Chorus

Verse 3
(Mack 10) I shoot 'em up like syringes
I know what real ends is
Lo lo's Harley Davis and big body Benzes
Ain't been faded so far on my wrist
I got a R hundred thousand dollar car
Cause I push the caviar
So what's up what you need everybody huddle up
Got that 2 for 1 special with the rock called double up
So get lit take a hit shop is open all day
From L.A. to the Bay it's Mack 10 & E-Fortaay
(E-40) Sometimes I wonder if it's worth this
Fuckin' with the law tryna make it look like
I'm runnin' a legitimate tow truck service
With a Just Say No to Drug bumper sticker
On the back window (back window)
Knowin' I been smokin' a gang of Indo
Around the corner four houses down across the way way
Make a right and then a left
Over there by Safeway and when ya get there page me
Punch in how much you wanna spend
Seperate the 20's from the 1's 5's and 10's
Slick sly sharp narcotic vendors
Always do business in shopping centers
Buck 'em stick 'em stuck 'em don't ever fuck me
Hate 'em bleed 'em love 'em shit can get ugly

Chorus

Hoo bang hoo ride (2X)
Hoo ride hoo bang
Who be ridin' who be bangin' (Westside) Ride Nigga
(Repeat)
Fuck 'em and feed 'em cold sardines, cold sardines
(Repeat)[Hook: sample]
Some people get caught up
Some try and get rolled up
Some people... (x9)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ol' Dirty kickin' your ass
The things that you learnt in class is trash
You can't do nothin' wit' it, I put you in the past
You broken motherfuckers, shut the fuck up
I do it 'til you bad luck and head gets plucked
The only thing on your brain is to give me this cash
Stay out of my business cause I'm takin' your tash
This struggle on the ming, non of y'all bring
I got y'all in.. flavouring

Chorus x2

[Mack 10]
I seem to fuck about a bitch or a crooked ass cop
I'm a burst that, it's dealin', the hustle don't stop
I got stones and hairone, ecstasy and weed
Meth, imphetamine, sherm, sticks and speed
Pay it high wid, dope is all I got to give
I'm a ghetto nigga dog so I get it how I live
Got money, lock 'em off, fuckers still I got drama
Got two strike dog and five baby mamas
With new strain I maintain, I'm ready and willin'
To keep change on niggas brains to keep the blood spillin'
I hate it but it ain't complicated, it's real simple
Fuck with me and know you get a hole in your temple
I ain't gonna play you niggas, I'mma slay you niggas
Don't take but a few figures and a few new triggers
Mack 10 livin' legend, every West coast rhymin'
Straight hoo bangin' gangsta and all rhymin' sodom, it's bad

Chorus x2

[Royal Flush]
Shut up, let me talk for a minute, alot of bull shit on my mind
Dealin' with crime, alot of y'all dealin' wid rhymes
Stuck on the grind, crackheads cookin' my pies
Startin' off on the 1-2-5, the block's mine
Bucket the spine, DH tryna tap my line
Stop my producitons, wanna know my money discussions
Who I roll wid, "buy so many cars is he legitin' of my dick"
It didn't matter when I ain't have shit
They done watch me in helicopters, parklin' in my crib
All I wanna feed is my kids, no time to do a bid
Feel me, I forced the whole guns a while for my ones
Didn't sell drugs, where the money come from?
No school, no job, no bitch, no food, fuck that
Do what I do to make my shit true
And I make it hard on them boys who blew they cats charges
If I go to jail you know I'm blowin' on the Sergeants

Chorus x5[Cube]
Uhh uhh Come on...
Got to get the scrilla got to get the scrilla
Got to get the cash hey come on got to get it (huh huh)

Back once again straight faded off Henn'
It's that nigga WC with the pocket full of spend
Runnin' all the gators with the new chrome feet
Checkin' through my rearview with my hand on my heat
Cause hatas can't stand to see a nigga doin' good
But fuck Hollywood I'm a still bang the 'hood
Gettin' my stalk on walk on loc I'm all about the paper
Hoppin' out the Navigator with braids & Chucks Taylors
A regulator scopin' the field like a commentator
Dodgin' investigators haters & salt shakers
The cookie baker the 64 pancaker
Bitch my whole entourage is full of hit makers &
Gators trip makers to Vegas from bird breakers from skyscrapers
Tippin' nobellas cause loc we's all about the Cheddar

See we down for whatever

Everybody get yo' scrilla

[Repeat Hook]

Better
Bounce baby baby bounce baby baby bounce
To them outta town niggas I still got 'em 9 an ounce
Can't rely on no label to send my kids to college
So after I rock the spot meet me in the parking lot
Now call it what you want but the game got me cheese
With bitches on my dick since my last CD
I went from young black & broke bro' to dub the inevitable
Turnin' over three decimals bangin' the oyster perpetual
Let it go rags to riches buckets to Phillies
I went from no dough to mo' dough
To still gettin' these switches
I'm wicked for digits forgive me God for the truth
But I fiends for Cheddar like a smoker with a sweet tooth
Got game from Legit & 40 C Mac & Short
Cube told me the key to it all is to keep hustlin' loc
Put your family first & the rest will endeavor
Stay focused & forever we can get this Cheddar
Come on...

[Mack]
See we down for whatever

Betta bet ya stepped on it cause last year ya slept on her
But now I'm up on her givin' golden showers to my opponents
Grindin' til I'm paid in full

*Gunshot*[Produced by Mannie Fresh]

[Verse 1: Mack 10]
I jump out the blocks like ready! set! go!
Check all my traps and dodge the fed co
I'm all about the mix like a fuckin collage
And out the garage, is a Bentley Onage
With the brains blowed out, so the sun's beamin
I got the jackers drooling, and the hoes fiendin
And since I'm Westside Connected got the streets on hype
I got big deals, big skrill, big wheels, big pipes..

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Twenty-inchers roll - go and get these hoes
Picky hoes wanna roll with my niggaroles
But be a freak about it, and I'mma see about it
Speak about it, no bitch I'mma be about it
Who want some of this, West running this
Mack 10 with the playboy bunny bitch
She's a dummy bitch - with a money pit?
You broke ass niggas can't even stomach this

[Verse 3: W.C.]
What that connect like? Nigga like three time felon
Six-double-0-west nigga selling rich Ru-bellin'
Throw it up, hold it up, guns bust fo' fingers up
Two twisted in the middle with the thumb cuffed
Chevy Nash and dippin the ass and king of the zaggin
Fo'-fo' mackin and coat taggin
Dub the hood phtanom I'm in a blue phantom
In front of the club and valet, do for talk and mack 'em trick

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]
What is it like, tossin' them hoes?
And rollin' them fools on them vogues
Flossin' them chains, we doin' big thangs
And bustin' on punks at close range
This the way us gangstas roll
Sit back and watch as it unfolds
Bitches and suckers stunt so cold
This is the life we chose..

[Verse 4: Mack 10]
Dope money and rapping shit I'm all with it
And all I know is the street so that's how I spit it
Chickenhawk see a bird, then I gotta get it
So if ya hood come up short, then I probably did it
And if lil' momma thick then I gotta hit it
The trojan gotta be a magnum for me to fit it
If it was sherm on a stick then I probably lit it
The red beam is on your wig so I probably split it

[Verse 5: Ice Cube]
To all them bitches that think they bootylicious
I think they nutritious - I think they do dishes
I'm makin three wishes, or takin' they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches
Ego maniac - little homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an asshole and it ain't an act
So take a hit of that - and remember that
Where my motherfuckin niggas and my bitches at?

[Verse 6: W.C.]
Tree-i-ick! I'm Dub-C, the rider with the clique
And like a dragon it's nathin' but fire when I spit
And I can't shake these ghetto ways
A street rich nigga eatin a bag of Lays
And rubber bands and braids
From the turf for the side, rings an ambulance
Where we keep the pistols smoking just like Afghanistan
It's gangsta the killa - the dope dealer
Back for mo' figgas - so trick bow down and po' the liquor bitch

[Hook 2X]

[Mack 10: 2X]
It's plain to see, you can't change me
Cause I'mma be "Connected for Life"

[Outro: Mack 10]
Yeah!, West Connect gang for life
Butch Cassidy, Mannie Fresh you a fool for this beat, boy
Uh, uh, uh[Intro: Mack 10]
BLaaaow Blam 187
Straight murder display from LA to the Bay
Westside, My nigga Spice 1 aka Fetty Chico
And I'll be Mack 10 aka Mack Manson
What up Spice

[Verse 1: Spice 1]
We serving chickens you damn sure can't get at Roscoe's
If you don't want to see no murder then keep your eyes closed
Nigga shake the dice up, roll 'em if it's one or ten
They won't be able to put your ass together again
Leave you in Reece's Pieces, rolling in white cornices
Knocking out teethes, I know where we can get the blackheads cheapest
From my homie down the street on the block
He copping everything from Desert Eagles down to them mini-Glocks
If niggas fuck off the money we raise the murder stats
Me and my nigga Mack 10 committing terrorist acts
You see us bailing don't mumble under your breath
Have the heart to say fuck you so I can put five in your chest nigga
Don't be no punk, I put my Uzi where my mouth is
Yay under couches running out of crack houses
We down and dirty for the birdy thirty-five a sack
Nigga give up the stack it's Fetty Chico and The Mack

[Hook: Spice 1]
Fetty Chico and The Mack
(Murder Murder) Ma-A-Mack 10 shooter, kill a man looter
Fetty Chico And The Mack
(Murder Murder) Open up your mouth, Say Ahh, get
Ready for the Blaaoow
Fetty Chico and The Mack
(Murder Murder) Ma-A-Mack 10 shooter, kill a man looter
Fetty Chico And The Mack
(Murder Murder) Open up your mouth, Say Ahh, get
Ready for the Blaaoow

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
I'm in a murderous mindstate
I'm on so much dope and coke I can't even do my line straight
I smoke that warren that shit put me in a trance
And since my last LP they start calling me Mack Manson
Now when I come around punks know they're gone
Smell my pistol around and fall straight into a coma
So take if you want it that's my number one motto
Hitting licks like the lotto, with a four-five bottle
And assault rifles like Rambo full of ammo
Dump a nigga in his chest and watch him bleed through his flesh
???...... chicken hawking
You kill a nigga, you kill his bitch so she can't talk
So I smoked the bitch and made it simple
I put one in her temple and got horny as a nympho
So with a hard dick and guns, a bad bitch dies
I take my two fingers and then I slowly close her eyes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spice 1]
Capping him in his b-brain, with the m-mack t-ten
That's my p-partner we d-d-doing him in
L-l-leave him in the t-trunk
'til his c-crazy kid kicks one in the ch-chamber off
The s-safety
I g-got 'em g-got 'em four extra c-clips
Infra-red b-beam h-hollow tips
D-dirty l-licks m-midnight
M-Mack W-One O and l-laser sights
R-rollin b-blunts smoking to the doobie
In my h-hooptie with my uzi t-talking to me
Telling me thought another lick we can go pull off
He told me keep your mask on don't take your hood off
So me bail into Burger King and me pistol whip the guard
Everybody up on the floor nobody try to make it hard
Another guard was hiding he jumped out and bust at me
So I let him count the bullets in my C-L-I-P
Me hear them sirens ringing and me take off with the stack
Bailing without the stretch it's Fetty Chico and The Mack
187-187-187-187-Blaaaow

Hell Yeah!!!
Foe Life

Mack 10:
Nigga, Westside

[Verse 1]
Mack 10, nutty as they come leave 'em face down
And numb from the waist down
It's a Sunday a gun day
Rollin' down a one way
In my 'lac front and back
Over train tracks
On yak and herb nigga swerve
It get's on my nerves, banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
What you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
Comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
But niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'mma vet you can bet
That I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
Everybody run when I bust a cap
Puttin' Inglewood up on the map
Look at what I do when I pull my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
Bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

[Hook]
Foe life, foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes
Foe life, foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes

[Verse 2]
Khacki suit ski mask is my attire
With my luck cut my chucks on the barbed wire
Fool where ya keep the rims and tires
'fo yo' life expires, I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler
A lot of stiches in the ass, blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
Caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand, your Honor I'mma changed man
So please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go? and if he say no
I'mma have to say bitch get out the car slow and leave ya fuckin' dough
Cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
Let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Call 911 there's a son of a bitch on the roof
Yarned up in his birthday suit
(Mack 10 to the rescue)
My momma wanna know why I do what I do
Cause I'm superman superbad supermad superfly
Fool you can die
There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
And I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway
'bout to buck you down with this throw away
With no serial number it's the summer
Where niggas die, it's hotter than July
You better stay low fo' you get a halo
Plus wings and a gown when I come around
So take 10 paces
And try to guess the color of my shoelaces

[Hook]Ladies and gentlemen, flight 1-0 from LAX is now arriving into
JFK International

[ODB talking]
What? What? (...?...) about that money, nigga
How many, hey yo, how many niggas is really making money now
Now what I'm saying?
This 98, I'mma tell y'all cats somethin
This is the year of do it, or don't
If you gon do it, you better roll on with this crew cat
Juggyyyyy!!!!

[Mack 10] (ODB)
People call me crazy, but that's alright with me (It's alright!)
They ask me why I'm hustlin, (We hustlin!) I say for the money (Yeah!)
I duck down with Buckshot, Hoo Bang with Wu-Tang (Oooooo!)
Won't hesiate to slang, so money ain't a thang (Ahhhhh!)
Called Buck and Dirty, asked em what they need
They said send me two thangs and some LA weed
So my belief is fuck the beef, all money the same
And when I get to New York, I'mma show you the whoop game
I make a bitch stay down, cuz I'm that type of guy
Put the work on the Greyhound and fly to the NY
Hit the east coast with a pocket fulla cheddar
Tan khakis on with a thick red sweater (Oh yeah!)
They see me with some hoes, couldn't be better timing
Cuz though a nigga g'd up, I got on big diamonds, so nigga what?
(Tell it to em cat!)

[Hook] [Mack 10] (ODB)
People call me crazy, but that's alright with me
They ask me why I'm hustlin, I say for the money
(Yo, I am comin over, to your spot tonight
I promise you my baby, that I'm gon do you right!)

[Buckshot] (ODB) {Mack 10}
Through the gusty wind, I roll with fifty men
Ready to get nifty and shifty and low
So what's the movements, yo? Let me know
Cuz when I come for motherfuckers, I'm comin for throats
It was sad I bled, but the red in my eyes shed
Light on the dark, I led the blind in sight
Now I got all of them inside
It's the reason why I do this, and I night ride
(For the moneyyyyy!!!!!!)
If you and a nigga outside, say the word
And I'm a spruge with my flight team soarin like birds
Missed it on the Friday with my nigga Cube
But the bomb blew Saturday when Mack lit the fuse
Who other than Buckshot come pick up the pieces
And straighten niggas out like creases
{Speak on it} Yeah nigga
(It's for the moneyyyyyy!!!!!)
Buckshot, ODB, Mack 10, back at it again

[Hook]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Hey yo, most of you know me, some of you don't
When it comes to challengin, none of you won't
Arrange this battle to improve your style
It's a brother with a totally different profile
Most of you play cold front in your face
Hesitatin on the rhymes, shoulda been Memorex
But, you forgot, you's an amatuer
Mystery worshipper, yo I prefer
I mind you, tease you, who's the boss?
Sucka amneisa, memory loss, welllll
Hit this, just quiet as kept
Mmmmm C's on the charts from the start had slept
Leeeeet's take them, wake them
You should be woke
Cuz you take MC'in for a practical joke, Hmmmmm
I present myself to be a similar nightmare of an Amazing Story

[Hook]

[ODB talking]
Yo, you ain't hearin nothing but a drop of the dime
Know what I'm saying?
To all my dogs, I wanna give a shout out
You got my nigga, Mack 10
You got my nigga, Buckshot shorty
And you got the one, dirt dog
Know what I'm saying?
And we gon do it like sweat hogs, my nigga
This how we get down!

[Mack 10 talking]
People call me crazy, but that's alright with me
They ask me why I'm hustlin, I say for the money
Haha, Hoo Bangin records, pushin weight in 98
Cookin nothing but the bomb
You know what I'm sayin?
Cuz we got the Recipe, fo sho![Tray Deee]
Yeah again, another group collaboration

Verse One: Tray Deee

From the second I get dressed to get to steepin I'm on one
Fillin up the 4-4 if pop-po want some
I ain't runnin from a motherfucker
Dust a sucker off if he soft then fuck him if he suffer
Another One Bites The Dust like the song say
Bust em in the wrong way, caught up in the gunplay
One day, some say, we all gon' die
Human lives to my eyes, take a size and bye
You're on your own, give em all and go explode
It's a cold that aroze when you chose your clothes
Blue or red, who will care if we all was rich?
Ballin tills, haulin chickens, flossin grips
I give a damn bout the next fool, my Tek rule
Ol' school nigga bout to take it to the next school
This gangsta shit is like drugs, runnin with thugs
Puttin slugs in your motherfuckin mug

Chorus: Squeak-Ru, (Tray Deee)

This gangsta shit is like a drug, (I got to ride)
And live for the hood to show my love
*repeat*
(*singing*)
This gangsta shit is like a motherfuckin gangsta drug
Crips and Bloods, ooooh
*repeat*

Verse Two: Squeak-Ru

I got to bang on my enemy
I got make sure they know, they ain't afraid of me
So I'm gon' ride on they hood
Leavin nuttin but obituaries til they get it understood
You know that Squeak-Ru capped em
I wantcha homegirl photo book to be full of em
I'll be the gossip for ya block
When y'all explain to each other how I creep with the Glock
The 4-5 nigga did the damage
I took two to da dome, so, nigga, fuck a bandage
And all you got was a bodybag
Accomadations to the morgue, equipped with a toe tag
Now you know I'm a killer
You cross my name out on the ward, it lets me know y'all remember
Mashed on your hood and got a trophy
If you really want revenge, nigga, come get me

Chorus

Verse Three: Mack 10

This gangsta shit is a must, and plus I bust
And puff angel dust for the headrush
I like the way the Teks spit when I'm lit
I feel like "Fuck the police" and "a bitch ain't shit"
Plus I represent my curb to the fullest
And them, so-called hogs be like track stars when I pull this
Beat out, get the sheet out when I roam
Cos the first fool caught slippin on my block gettin done
So fuck a job, dogg, I jacks for my figures
Plus I live by the trigger and I ride for my niggas
On all-gold twisters on a front and back Caddy
Every broad in they ghetto wish I was their baby daddy
So which lucky ho wanna be Miss Mack 1-0
You gotta have a gang of ass and be a dick-suckin pro
I wanna down bitch for my bride and when we ride
Gotta love this gangsta shit and be down for the homicide

Chorus:

This gangsta shit is like a drug, (I got to ride)
And live for the hood to show my love
*repeat*
(*singing*)
This gangsta shit is like a motherfuckin gangsta drug
Crips and Bloods, ooooh
*repeat x3*

[Mack 10] Rest in peace to all the soldiers
We lost to this gangsta shit[Mack 10]
Let me do some shit with my niggas from the CPT, ha ha
You ready Eiht?

[MC Eiht]
Yeah, c'mon

[Verse 1: Mack 10]

I was born to ride, bang and pack heat
Got turned out early by the scandalous freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pullin jewelry licks
Moms said, "Mack, baby watch for danger"
I said, "Momma don't you know I'm a real gangbanger?"
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twistin triple gold with the all black Eagles
Got a deuce, fired at Scoop's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G-homie Wreck (whatup)
He said, "Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip in case you might need it"
Get the eighty eight skate, ang get your slide on
Throw the Hoo-Bang plaque in the back and your ride on

[Chorus: Mack 10]
Ride for me, I'mma ride for you
You Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew
Get yo ride on, get yo slide on, who the best
Nobody rides like these killas from the west

Ride for me, I'mma ride for you
You Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew
Get yo slide on, get yo ride on, who the best
Nobody rides like these killas from the west

[Verse 2: Eazy E]
1, 2, 3, and to the 4
Eazy muthafuckin E with the chrome to your dome
Cruisin in my 6-4 rag top
I got a lot of juice, a lot of fuckin block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncin
More Bounce to the Ounce and I'm clownin
Keep the gat in my lap cuz I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps cuz I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Peep, nigga I don't sleep
Bury muthafuckas in the concrete
You try to creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I peep you niggas out in my left window
So I blast and I blast till I blast no more
Yo, they call a motherfucker John Doe

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
Real thugs roll cuz the Westside's sick
Which enemy depicts to catch the 9 clip
Slick, but not like Rick, the gang story
G's kill and ain't shit funny like Joe Torre
Don't make me laugh cause I'm on the wrong the path
Catch the blood bath, it's the aftermath
Slang strike to make money, now ain't that simple?
Y'all silly niggas wearin' vests but we aim for the temple (brrrrrrr)
Watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo
Keep the calico with extra ammo
So and so gets blasted, to the casket
Never seen these westside G's face, we masked it
Ya'll best be defeat and be discreet
Catch the hot heat from across the street
Take me in the dump schools that, wanna push me
Retaliation, straight better than hittin' pussy

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ugh, MC Eiht in the muthafuckin house
(yeah, Hoo-Bang one time)
Yeah, ha
(Hoo-Bang two times)
Rest in peace Eazy E
(the hiphop thugsta)
(yeah)
Fa sho
(Mack Dime)
Come on, ugh
(all day baby, all day baby)
WESTSIDERIDERS!! UghIntro: Ras Kass

Once again, we tango for cash
Ras Kass, Dr. Dre and Mack 10 connected
We ghetto fabulous baby
The best food, drink and pussy that money can buy

[Verse One: Ras Kass]
Every day of my life is off the ringer
That's guaranteed, like a fistfight on Jerry Springer
I got the hottest flow to hit the street since lava
So holla, we all hustle for dollar dollars
From Sac to Houston, New Orleans to D.C
We drinkin' V-S-O-P the beats beep
Bangin, catch me with a dimepiece next to me
My body all over your body like LSG
Neighborhood celeb with the keys to my city like the mayor
Rookies askin us how to be a playa
Get in where you fit in, and never get your ghetto pass revoked
No matter how much money you make
Stay true to the game loc, guest list terror clothes
In jeans and tennis shoes, breakin your strict dress codes
Spit lyrical bricks, thirteen g
So I can be richer than Master P sellin 'Ghetto D'

[Hook: Mack 10]
We Ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcastin live from Los Angeles
We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcastin live from Los Angeles

[Verse Two: Dr. Dre]
You ain't heard of me, you ain't listenin hard enough
Started in Compton servin from a ice cream truck
Now ten years later whippin a custom Navigator
Steppin on your toes playa, stuffin up your alligators
I'm ghetto, like Newport cigarettes, feel me
Boom bap and slap that ass silly
This is for the full time students slash part time strippers
And young niggas, clockin at least five figures
Some of us pro atheletes, some of us rap over fat beats
Some of us hustle in the streets
Twenty deep in Club Nikki's so you know we gots to mingle
Trickin' off a pocket full of singles, huh
And it's all bueno, musical mafia like Frank Sinatra
Pop a thirteen shot Glock to make you Go See the Doctor
Ain't nuttin nice
From hood to hood, love livin the lavish life

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Ras Kass]
Nigga Stu-B-Doo in the GS300 playing number two Tekken
Zero to sixty in six point seven seconds
*tires screech* hanging out the window acting up
Chickenheads like "You doin fo'(4) much!"
Flexin the Rolex oyster perpetual, thirty-five diamonds
Across the face, still eatin out foam cups and paper plates
We don't call it playa hatin in the nine-eight
It's P.I, that's pass intereference, automatic first down
Want Juice like 2Pac, then Obey Your Thirst clown
Be in the PJ's in NY, rockin DK
Mix EJ with OJ, OK, we say
"L.A. niggas got crazy game
Like John Elway got a superbowl ring"
The homies down for whatever, we stack the chedda
Swiss bank accounts, and mo' mozzarella fella

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ugh! And it don't stop!
HAHA, WESTSIDE RIDERS BABY, HAHA![Mack 10]
I'm screamin as I'm dreamin, I see evil bad spirits
So I wake up in the middle of the night to write lyrics
In a cold sweat, heard magnums in my dreams, my ears ring
So this time on the mic I bring horror like Stephen King
All my good times are turned bad like the Evan's
Seen hundreds get wounded but like a thousand 187's
Everybody that was so real, they were now phony
And the nigga that used to be my homie, shit he turned on me
I got a 45 that spit hot lead that'll drill him
The nigga know too much about me, so it's a must that I kill him
If it's time available at the shrink, man I need to spend it
Cuz now I see the chair rockin, but ain't nobody in it
I'm psycho like Norman Bates in the fresh side of my mind and
All I think about is comittin redrums like The Shining
So Lord please help me and forgive me for my sins
And tell me, why do I deserve the twilight zone that I'm in?
Somebody ease the pain I need a shot of novacaine
Or angel dust smoke circulatin through my brain
So who got the slaughter water, la la the brain killer
I got five on it, four stick, to the first dealer
With no screws left it's like my head is now hollow
I'm so crazy seems like my own shadow's scared to follow
Ain't that a bitch, 1-O caught up in the horror show
But ain't no popcorn or bon bons, it's all teflons nigga

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a 44 everywhere I go
It's 1-O in the ghetto horror show

[Jayo Felony]
I'm slangin ?nocous? on the boulders
Keys, O-Z's and quarters
Come along, get up, stand up, and come and get your sack
I'm bustin nigga's hearts with this motherfuckin crack
I'm sayin please oh please oh please give me just one more hit
Now I'm surrounded by skinny motherfuckers with glass dicks
I'll jack Jack and Jill, smack Bill Clinton and his bitch
Tell po po they can't fade me I'll kill him and his snitch
I'm a bad influence, I'm a bad influence
And motherfuckers don't wanna know what I'll tell these fuckin kids
Fuck school nigga, bang with me
Why you gotta get a job nigga, slang with me
Listen, my 44 protects ya if any nigga tries to test ya
Nigga who the fuck is you? I'm Peer Pressure
Took the last bit of the thorazine, I'm at the end of the rainbow
There ain't no fuckin pot of gold, just the ghetto horror show
There we go

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a AK everywhere I go
It's Jayo in the ghetto horror show

[Ice Cube]
I got to testify, I grew up in this ghetto horror
?Justaora? got me spittin from the ghetto Torah
Ghetto bible survival I'm hittin rivals in their vitals
Tryin to rob titles, from livin idols
I give recitals on the drugs to sex to county checks to Lex
Your respect from the hot techs
And it's the same for me cuz the fame don't wipe away the black
Westside can't react
Braniac with this maniac, get to losin 'fore the schools get to oozin
And your bitch get to ?twosin?
The niggas at 600 pools and like the Pope
Get on the fuckin city F niggas like to vote
It's the horror, no tomorrow in your eyes
But look at me nigga I believe I can fly
You believe you can die, well shit it might happen
I believe I can rhyme and look, I start rappin nigga

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a tech nine everywhere I go
It's Ice Cube in the ghetto horror show

[Mack 10 talking]
What is time? Huh, time is divded by two
Before it happens, and after it happens
Right now, we callin it the ghetto horrow show

[Some guy]
Only a fool would go there at night![Mack 10]
Hoo Bangin' and Cash Money

[Manny Fresh]
It's that day, phat day
Kidnappin' and gun play
I need my riches from you bitches and I can't stay
Now that the flavor that I savor neighbor, 20 inch thangs
Rag on my head, white T-shirt and bagette chains
Mac like roni the one and only
Nigga Puff like Daddy and I'm pretty like Tony
Friday, lie day, tell the lil nigga I'll pay 'em
And when he come up with the product, ya'll niggas spray 'em
Now why they
Had to do me on Friday

Chorus: B.G. (2x)

It's Friday, nigga on the block straight shinin'
Runnin' a bitch down, tryin' to get it I'm grindin'
Sellin' 2 for 1's what ever nigga I got it
Them checks came out so the set straight poppin'

[Lil' Wayne]
Listen, listen, listen, la
Weezy-We, movin' 20 ki's a week
On a good friday it's like easy street
Breakin' down whole chickens, to quarters and halves
You gould get it harded than slabs or softer than sand
If you come around my court nigga
Ask for the short nigga
Not on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I be duckin' the law nigga
You know I got that raw nigga, bags to bricks
Whole things goin' for 10 and ounces for 6
Look it's iceberg nigga expect the worst
Friday done fell on the first and I got that work
And if I fron the whole thing, I'mma ask for 11
If I front a half a thing, I'm taxin' ya 7
Cause I gotta ride dubs nigga when and where ever
A CMR standard nigga got a flosser Kompressor
I got a extra 223, and my pockets to spend
And on the next Friday, I'mma do it again
Wha

Chorus: B.G. (2x)

[Mack 10]
Man first it was a hard night
And that was good Friday, I got to duck 'til I'm special on the hard white
I'm ridin' 20 inches, flossin', stay shinin'
I'm the boss, I get chickens at cost and stay grindin'
Don't make me put on the bass and so I'm bout to start hoopin'
I'll remake 2 out a 1 so I can get hootin' and recoopin'
My game gettin' strong and my profit gettin' long
I bust the whole chick down and sell it all in zones
Try to beat me or cheat me and get your shirt stained up
And run for pop those hollows towards the door and freeze your brain up
All hustlin' hit the stores and turn the flame up
Left the water bubblin' and rocked the caine up
So Baby, you Wayne and Fresh y'all get the machetes
Put it in B.G. cook it and y'all chop it when it's ready
And when you come to my hood and you lookin' for them thangs
Mack 10 is the name on the Caddy door now what

[Manny Fresh]
Why they
Had to do me on Friday
Why they
Had to persue on Friday
Why they
Had to do me on Friday
Why they
Had to persue on Friday
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hotYou can hear it bumpin through the door
It's a party jumpin on the floor
And from the way it sound it ain't no doubt (whassup?)
That the West coast is in yo' mouth

[Mack 10]
Yea, yea
It's all gravy, petty cash never fades me
So po' me a shot of 'gnac and purple haze me
I'm a hustler, gettin cash like crazy
Hard grindin pays me, work ethic is never lazy
Block hugger, the hood raised me
And she, won't be happy 'til she lays me
No, you never seem to amaze me
So the cheap shot you took at me never even grazed me
My name sparkin like a street king
Cause I mixed, the Hoo-Bang thing with the "Bling Bling"
A whole lot of haters out there it seem
But I flip 'em all off and keep doin my thing
I'm a boss about, when I Inglewood swing
Rocked out from my ear down to my pinkie ring
Now ding ding - let the bell ring
And if it's drama you want, then it's drama I bring, sing

[Hook]
Meanwhile I be indeed
And I can still see the hate in yo' eyes, hate in yo' eyes
Cause I'm livin like a G you intrigued
And I can still see the hate in yo' eyes, hate in yo' eyes
Never trippin cause it ain't nuttin to me
But I can still see the hate in yo' eyes, hate in yo' eyes
Hah, hah, hah - I can see the hate in yo' eyes, hate in yo' eyes

[Mack 10]
Look - you local cats is just small potatoes
No names, cause this addressed to ALL the haters
From the 'Wood, there is NONE greater
Mack the headliner and y'all are spectators
Remember "Foe Life?" I put the 'Wood in it
And looked out for you when your own hood didn't
And plus you forgot who was payin your bills
Introduced you to the game and gave you a deal
For me good livin, y'all independently rhymin
You got the hustle game backwards, you nickle and dimin
Oh hip-hop classics? I make 'em AND got 'em
And yo' group, ain't been heard of past the Bottoms
I can't go to my turf, and mingle with my G's
I got one word to say about that one - what? Please
Chickenhawks, y'all ain't worth a feather in my wing
And all this hatin just let me know I'm doin my thing, sing

[Hook]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Hoo-Bang, Hoo-Ride
All day, all night
Throw dubs, up high
Westside, foe life

[Mack 10]
Now tell me, is it the deuce-ones on the Bentley?
The lowriders, the mansions, is that why you resent me?
Smile in my face, and act so friendly
Walk away with hate and a heart full of envy
Say bruh, what part of the game is that?
You got ways like a dame and how LAME is that?
Actin like a groupie around famous cats
And it's strange, you don't have no shame in that
I got your card playboy, but I ain't trippin
You know me, I just roll with the punches and keep it pimpin
Get dough by bunches, donatin and tippin
Let it ride on the Harley, and six-fo' dippin
Stay real about my scrill if you know what I mean
I'm like a leprechaun, I want nuttin BUT green
Avoid the haters, and for the party scene
Copped a rock from the D-R to make the head ring, sing

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Mack]
Uhh that's right uhh yeah ha ha ha ha
What the fuck you smilin' at
Right

Verse 1
It's that nigga west side swangin'
Heat I'm bringin' like I'm bangin'
Slangin' khakis hangin'
Took the script & I'm flippin' it
Got bustas straight trippin' it
Never thought Mack 10'll
Be the new nigga rippin' shit
Real G style on a funky freestyle
Solo flo show with my bitch & my lo lo
Gettin' my floss on as I slide my locs on
Hit the corna' bitch hold on
Danas is what I roll on
So watch yo' step quiet it's kept on the leak
I blast I don't stick the different nigga in the click
As I kick rhymes niggas pick mines from the stack
Threw the roof on the sack then cut the 'lac front & back
On all gold hundred spoke D's when I skiis
Nigga please wanna be G's don't wanna see these
Straight from killa Cali it's like the Valley of Death
Of who's left I'll be a G 'til my very last breath

Chorus
Alli alli all come free here comes the G
Fresh as a new pack I'll be doper than my cavi sack
Alli alli all come free here comes the G
Checkin' loot like it's crazy in painter pants & Stacys
(Repeat)

Verse 2
Now as I roll through the turf with that true G pride
Feeling high as I ride from the west to the eastside
On them switches went from rags to riches
All snitches must die I can't lie
I like them hoochie bitches
Though I know that a ho is a gamble
Scandle hard to handle them dookey braids & sandals
That's how I like it hike it touchdown then spike it
Then pipe it so tough they can't gripe it
So if it's on from uh dusk 'til dawn
Keep it crackin' stay packin' as long as niggas jackin'
Mackin' like Goldie bumpin' nothin' but oldies
Reminiscin' tilt the 40's when I vibe the dead homies

Talking:
Yeah I wanna say what's up to all my deceased homeboys
From the west & eastside didn't make it to see this rap
Oh yeah it's still Mack 10 foe life puttin' it down like this here

Chorus

Verse 3
Down for the dirt I sport khakis and a white t-shirt
Slangin' work got the big birdies that don't chirp
I came up from a crawler now my stack is taller
Big baller shot caller movin' shit like a U-Hauler
So now it's on like that & I'm rollin'
Controllin' the 'hood guns about a boat swollen
Back arms tatted (Inglewood) so tweed can get gatted
Cavi water weed or speed what you need cause I have it
So come through run through & uhh smell the vapors
Won't be no set trip if it's all about paper
Down with the Lench Mob I can't go wrong
Well known & it's on bankin corners in my Brougham

Chorus

Mack 10, westside, foe life, and we out[Intro: Ice Cube]
You are now rockin with the west
We don't fuck with the stress
Westside connect-Gangin, hoo-bangin
And we got thousands, so fuck what you claimin

[Verse 1: Mack 10]
Who wanna scrap with a nigga that bang
Straight mass murderin on 24 tracks
I put it down like a hog, I got what you need
I'm from the westcoast the bad seed with the bomb weed
Hollow points is my venom
I bust rapid as the beat, flamin hot when I send em
And them niggas out of bounds better duck when I come around
Movin the crowd with a tech layin niggas down
You say shit my whole crew claimin true
Some niggas damu and niggas wear blue
Pennitentary bound, smokin weed by the pound as I clown
Sendin work out of town on the greyhound

[Hook: Cube and Mack 10 - repeat 2X]
[Ice Cube] Mack 10 is the lick, Westside is the click
[Mack 10] Can't get enough of this gangsta shit

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
We got bulletproof vests and 96 SS's
Leavin fly bitches in donna karen dresses
With a neck full of hickeys, situation lookin tricky
20,000 in my pocket and I'm still sportin dickies
Fuck that, connect life, let me make it plain and simple
You say you roll deep you gonna get busted like a pimple
Till my very last breath, I'mma Inglewood swang
So tell me do you bang, fool, what set you claim?
Cause niggas like you can't win with Mack 10
So let the games begin, I'll leave you black again
Cause on a homicide I ride to the fullest, not just a little
Cause its four fingers up and two twisted in the middle

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3: Mack 10]
I'm on the hunt for the loot, watch your pockets cause I pat em
Bailin through the hood in chucks and stacey adams
Got the spot still poppin, got your legs still rockin
Ever since foe life, my ex bitch been jockin
I can't fade no hoes, And this is one of those
That I iron on my clothes, and shine my romeos
Be the best friend to me, get a little hennessey
Always down to scwab when I blast on my enemy
A bitch thats the leader of the hoo bang committee
With a 100% Mack 10 on her tittie
Lookin pretty as a bangin if you wanna hoo bang
Throw your neighborhood up like it ain't no thang

[Hook] -4X

[Mack 10]
Yeah, gun ho mack 1-0
Straight stompin and chicken hawkin
Inglewood swangin, dope slangin
And Hoo-Bangin' Comin from the...

West-side
