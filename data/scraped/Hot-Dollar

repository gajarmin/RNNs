Run up on me and it's gonna be a murder, homie
Up in Quervo 1800

"Roll up in the club
All eyes on me
All eyes on me..." --] 2Pac[Verse 1: Guerilla Black]
Man I've walked through so many miles of hatred
They treat me like and alien up off of a spaceship
I heard them talking while I was in hibernation
They looked at me crazy, as if I was Lil' Kim with a face lift
Soon as you leave, they got they hands on the throat
No need for Snoop and Game, I'm a man of my own
Go ask Bishop and mom, they didn't grasp alone (?)
Dollar figure went all through vision, man, in his song (?)
I want to "Touch the Sky", just like Kanye
They treated me like an "Outkast", just like Andre
If I could show 'em my talent, like Beyonce
I'd have Gabrielle Union as my fiance (rarr)
I'd probably be at the Gremlins in tight ass jeans
But, nahh, I ain't rapping like the Black Eyed Peas
But it's not like ain't hot like the Black Eyed Peas
I just rap about the block, and they ain't like me!

Okay! The killer is hot!

A mill for the deal, all you bitches can miss me
Me and Black ain't the same for brothers
But you can't put the fame above us
Or name another
That spit how the night's here are changing colors
I kill you, singing toungue 'till you shameless mother
Call me the black John Diamond
I'm in my Maserati
Getting head while I drive is a hobby
Riding through the city with my casket face
Scared rappers need church like Pastor Mase!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Guerilla Black]
Don't call it a comeback
The cycle just repeated again

Not with awful Dodgers and Ed Hardey
Niggas'll test a gangster like Charles Barkley

I know the haters must must have hated "Did me in"
But I'm back and stronger than a million men
