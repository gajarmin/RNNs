[Hook]
They see me rolling
They hating, patrolling and trying to catch me riding dirty
Trying to catch me riding dirty
My music so loud I'm swangin'
They hoping that they gonna catch me riding dirty
Trying to catch me riding dirty

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Grinding to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
And ride with a new chick, she like "Hold up"
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full clip in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just trying to bone, ain't trying to have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas trying to jack for some
But we packing something and what we have for em
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum security cell
I'm gripping oak
Music loud and I'm tipping slow
Twin's steady twisting like "Hit this dough"
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down, got to stop pollution
CD changes, niggas like, "Who is that producing?"
That's the Play N Skillz when we out and cruising
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Krayzie Bone]
I've been drinking and smoking, holy shit cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home before the po-po's scope this
Big old Excursion just swervin', all up in the curb'n
A nigga be sipping on the Hennessy and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And roll another one up, we living like we ain't giving a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezing my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Coming pretty deep, me and my dogs
Yo I gotta hit the back streets
Wondering about the 6 pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key
With no regard for the law
We dodge em like: "Fuck em all"
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it poppin', dogg
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire (Millionaire)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
Now would you think it so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', cause they think they know
That they catching me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, trying to check my tags
Look in my rear view and they smiling
Thinking they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep trying
Steady denying that it's racial profiling
Houston, Texas you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them giving a
Damn about them not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even riding dirty
Bet you'll be leaving with an even madder mood
I'mma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Yea, my #2 on some old-school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, telling em: "We hate you"
I can't be touched and tell em that they should've known
Tipping down, I'm sitting crooked on my chrome
Booking my phone, finding a chick I want to bone
Like they couldn't stop me
I'm bout to pull up at your home, and it's on[Intro: Jim Jones]

And if you from the West Coast, my nigga, W-w-w-w-westside

[Nas]

Chopping holes in all the walls that's all they saw

[The Game]
Hip-hop ain't dead it just took a couple shots

The King's coming no, I'm not Jay-Z
Too many niggas hate me but they scared to face me
This ain't a movie dog, no not Waist Deep

She giving one blood, one love on dubs
A hundred forty thousand the first week

[Fat Joe]
All these niggas wanna front trill with them stiff faces

[Lil' Wayne]
504 gangsta New Orleans soldier

And you ain't gotta go overseas to see Iraq shit
You can come to LeFrak Queens and get jacked quick

[Jadakiss and Styles P]
One Blood we used to the spilling
Came from the hood so we used to the killing
Used to the Black males making cracksales in the building
How else you get the Benz with the suede on the ceiling
Blood in, Blood out
Me and homie back to back
Both loaded working we about to pitch a shut out
I'm New York's king I'm New York's hardest nigga
Anything in between's a motherfucking target nigga
D-B-L-O-C-K, he spray
The hawk'll find a nice home right where your cheeks stay
We got a mean team hip-Hop dream team
Them boys is only in the projects on green screen

One dutch, one bud, one burner, one slug
Want a couple casualties, but we'll settle for just one blood

[Fabolous]
What it look like all I say at most
Shooters waiting on the word just say it Los
I let these niggas live yes I saw em pull the plug
Have them goons pulling gloves, leave the room full of slugs
Catch me trafficking on maroon colored dubs
Couple Africans with balloons full of drugs
If they like me tell em line up
While I sit behind team point em out like a line up

[Juelz Santana]
Mic check, one two, one two check
I'm strapped, you strapped let's play two-on-two
Let's go you're eyeing us in the iron bus, boom

Mama told me not to play with fire but
She never told me I would grow to be a lighter

[Rick Ross]
One love to the gangs but I'm in the thangs
Save the colors for the cars see we kill for the fame
The boss made it yeah, we floss flagrant
Shame how I lost your life savings up in Las Vegas

And we gon sit here and wait for the derelicts

[Twista]
Bitch Chi got Lords and Gangsters show me where them niggas at

[Daz]

They hold cards down nigga like spades and pinochle
West coast gang bang, riders erasing em
Got funny niggas raising up and riders replacing em, cuz

[Daz Dillinger]
Draped in blue, notorious gangsta crew
RIP for niggas who don't stay true
Deep down in the crevices see the jets veteran
Dwelling in the land of the gang bang profession
I'm legendary yes, yes a Westcoaster
Throwing up two C's with two guns in my holster
I'm from Long Beach City a crip next to Compton
Down with my nigga Game if you niggas want problems
From the streets to the suites anywhere we can meet
Del Amo to Compton, Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide get swept away by the tide
By Gs and BGs, OGs it's time to ride

[WC]
Who the rider, looter through the gutter man
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes
From the Westside striving to dead em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans, blue strings, blowing blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and a blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese chunking up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub C and one Blood

[E-40]
The Bay Area fuckers we pop em
Open you up if you got a problem
Up top born in Cali-forn-ia
Clean your clock open your can of tuna
Make a choice either it's hell or it's heaven
Get your chest layed out with the FM 57
This ain't nothing to do with nobody
But in the Yay there ain't nothing to do but catch bodies

[Bun B]
I'm coming straight outta PAT like Compton in all black
But when we say what it do they never say holla back
Bun B the OG like '95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club offa Fairfax
Ask The Hundreds, it's doable I done done it
At the summit of rap and I'm watching you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it to Bun it don't differ
Wipe the streets with you like you a swiffer as a gifter one blood

[Chamillionaire]
I'm the realest youngster thats breathing and I don't gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire, y'all competing to be competing
My purpose is to get the cheese and as a purpose that should defeating
So shut your mouth, have a seat and be quiet till I finish eating
My label tells me I'm greedy, hogging all the room on your tv
Like Eric they think its Eazy, but it isn't easy believe me
Need to make a room in B.E. television if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy, I had to make room for me, G

[Slim Thug]
It's one Blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug it's still one love
I rep my blue boy team but I do it for green
I do it for my folks Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers future rappers standing out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood man and stack em a knot
Put your sets in the air scream fuck the cops
We gon rep for the hood man like it or not

[Young Dro]
My feed mashable, murders are catastrophical
Cars is improbable I'm overcoming obstacles
Trapping I made it logical my topic is impossible
I got a partner named Shoe Strang cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux, cars be tropical
All guns choppable all blocks are mobbable
I'm unstoppable my calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical, cushion is not ???

[The Clipse]
Red rum, red rum such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest was he talking to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior, look what the Lord gave you
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And reviving the track like we flowing through jumper cables
What duo you know get XXL kudos while copping off Coolio
Classic shit we mastered this left for dead, I'm back
I'm Lazarus

[Ja Rule]
Nigga, one Crip, one Blood
LA, New York
The Game, the Rule, one love guns up
Hands down, can't touch the flow is a bit much
The style wanna keep up
I'd advise you to speed up
With money moving like coke these days gotta re-up
G up, cop some heaters and dare a nigga to act up
You see us in dual seaters and throw it up
It's all hood niggas rep your sets if your Cuz or Blood
Niggas, we all bleed
These niggas can't breathe
Only because the guns are drawn and aimed to part
Niggas that got bullets with names on them
Want em, come get em niggas y'all know where to get at me
Look at me now pass me maybe you can be half me
You bastards, I'm laughing bullets sticking in family
Who sadly gets torn between one Crip and one Blood
Y'all niggas know me, yeah[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Got plenty cheese plenty carats, man we looking like some caterers
And its looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that trunk be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
I still represent H-Town, the city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars but they don't understand it
They say the never seen ya boy out here gettin his grind on
Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Yeh this the city thats slow, the city thats thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
And sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This Clutch City but we play what we delt
Reppin the H-Town

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Paul Wall]
Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north
I'm talking Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall wat it do baby

[Verse 6: Yung Redd]
(Heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)
Purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Stay blowin down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunny Side
I could walk these streets if I was blind, nahmtawkinbout?
Yung Reedd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate swear to God I was a jewler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute
MAYNE!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lil Keke]
H-O to the U-S, T-O to the N
God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunny Side and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rolling up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hiding
Don Ke' heart of the south, slab riding

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it cause there's not a product we dont push
We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touching it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Welcome to H-Town, this 3rd Ward talking

Put'cha H'es up, represent'cha city bro
Counting money, iced out, like I'm in a video

[Hook]

[Verse 12: Trae]
Cheyah!

Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin it like a platinum Rolls
Suicide make the door presidential when they decide to close (real talk)
They want the throne but tell the haters that I got it locked (got it locked)
I shoot em on the west so whatever all they way to the block (doors up)

This game a pie I dont want it all I just need a slice

[Hook][Slim Thug - Hook - 4x]
Still Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin' four hoes, and I'm packin' four fours (Hanh!)

Now look who creeping look who crawling still balling in the mix
It's that six six long dick slim nigga sticking your chick
Pullin tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping
Bar sipping car dipping grant wood grain gripping
Still tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin' four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Blowing on that indo GameCube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand me cuz I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big Glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big Boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm ridin' Sprewells sliding like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the nawf
Ain't shit changed I still represent (Still..), Hanh!

[Slim Thug - Hook - 4x]
Still Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Tippin' four hoes, and I'm packin' four fours (Here Lizard, Lizard, Lizard)

[Chamillionaire]
Ay Bigg Tyme
I'm tryna see the president dead (presidents dead?), that's what I said
But not the one in the white house man, the one with the green presidents head
Blue or red I'm still ridin', ladies be tellin' me that I'm sexist
And I guess it's, cuz I always love the money over dresses
Always been about them horizontal lines through them S's
That's a dollar sign, Impala flyin' watch how she undresses
Don't matter, if she black or white, dark or bright, she ain't actin' right
I'mma take that pretty braud out to eat, and then leave her there with a
Appetite
Niggas tell me they look up to me, and I know what y'all mean
Cuz I'm balling with tall green stacks taller then Yao Ming
All King, Koopa the Don, cruise with a gun
If being rich was a contest, Chamillion you would've won
I know, but watch the jealousy cuz ya still a get trampled
If you got whipped in the past then ya still a example
Treatin' niggas like Swishahouse flows, nigga what?
Soon as he start talkin' slow we gon' chop that boy up

[Slim Thug - Hook - 4x] {Chopped & Screwed}
Still Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin' four hoes, and I'm packin' four fours[Hook]
With so much drama in the industry, hip-hop police are listening
Be careful or you'll be history, looks like another unsolved mystery
It's murder! (Murder, murder)
Ahhh, it's murder! (Murder, murder)
Yeahh it's murder! (Murder, murder)
Somebody tell em it's murder
Murder was the case - and they blamed me

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Officer I didn't do it, you can't blame me for this
Could you please loosen up the handcuffs on my wrists?
You can call me what you wanna man but I ain't a snitch
No cooperation is exactly what you will get
'Til I talk til my lawyer, you get no reply
You've obviously been watching too much CSI
I'm not a crash dummy so don't even try
To talk your dirty trash to me, no BFI
If you are not guilty of anything, then why did you run?
Cause you the police! And plus I saw you cocking your gun
And the chamber wasn't empty, it was obviously one
If you think I'm believing that one then you're obviously dumb
I know that you heard the sirens, you dived in
To the vehicle you was driving and riding in
Instead you shouldn't be whining, but abiding
By the law, naw, it's obvious that you're lying

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Stop lying to me boy, it'd be best you confess
I can smell the BS on the scent of your breath
Saw the meth while I was inspecting your deck
Saw that you was ridin' dirty when I looked at the rest
Who is this guy Busta? Who is this guy Snoop?
Who is his other friend who's wearing the sky blue?
Look at this pic here, he standing beside you
Tell me his name now, I heard he was Piru
Confiscated the CD's at one of your homes
For evidence ever since we heard some of your songs
What about this Pimp guy, he was on one of your songs
I could've sworn that he said he had a "Pocket Full of Stones"
Am I wrong?
Hell yeah! I don't know who that is!
I don't know no Pimp C, all I know is I'm rich
And I'mma Bond like James, bet I be out here quick man
You ain't getting out of here, you must think that you're slick
In the car we confiscated the chronic and the clips
Diary that you had and all your blueprints
On the Death Row booklet, we found your two prints
Your thumb and your index, the judge will love this

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Now you can see you're screwed as the evidence pours in
The witness said the crime was at three in the morning
Gave us a description so we picked up your boy and
You'll get a lighter sentence if you put the crime on him

[Verse 3: Slick Rick]
A big celebrity, a case we long for
You a pirate - why you got that eyepatch on for?
Funny
Putting people in a hearse what I heard for
Where were you the night of April 21st son?
Home
I think you got your facts wrong, gat's onYou, Chamillionaire, robbed, shot a couple cats on Melview
What?
We gonna have to jail you too
In the lineup, don't speak until we tell you to
This the person who jimmied your lock, sir?
Well it's dark, kinda look like him, I'm not sure
Failure to nail cause assailant's another (uh-huh)
Believe I see an unmarked tailing a brother
Hit the bodega, not no more game
This chick used to be nice acting all strange
Like she was gonna get it, pathetic
Assailant caught, now they all apologetic

[Hook][2Pac]
Quit starin' at me like an infra red nigga
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Pictures of penny
Sippin' my glass full of henny
Hands on my semi-
Automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact
Cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire
Niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap
It's a trap a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks
Makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say
We murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the crack out
My lyrics neva fail me
I inhale strong weed then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like yay-yo
Niggas pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy it fatal
'fficiently I delete then flee
The art of war
Livin' sucka free
Get wit' me
Motherfucker don't sleep

[Hook: 2Pac] (2x)
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

[Young Buck]
I'm starin' thru my rear view
Doin' 'bout 90
The pedal to the metal
So I can't see what's behind me
Buckle up your seat belt eyes on the road
They know we ridin' dirty gotta play it how it go
They close down the projects the clubs been closed
And then they wonder why niggas breakin down o's
I'm a run away slave
Ya get it nigga off the chain
I got that thug life shit runnin' thru my veins
And now they scare
They know that I been heaven sent
And yeah we know the dope comin' from the president
But look at us
We ain't got shit to lose
Feel like we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes
In the ghetto or better yet home sweet home
This is the land of the free
But to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the white house strapped wit' my heat
So don't fall asleep

Come on niggas

[Hook] (2x)

[Chamillionaire]
They say that the moe they hate ya the moe that it motivate ya
My mind set on grind my mental set on the paper
62 hours and countin' and I'm still awake
And they slippin' me sleepin' pills wit' the will I break
Broke nigga always tellin' ya how to make ya cash adjust
So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media cause they always mad at us
I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate when we get gats and bust
They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff
I'm takin' back my money counter cause it wasn't fast enough, yep
I got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money
Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to maneuver with the ruger
To live like Freddie Krueger these nightmares just ain't as bloody
In meetings they always askin' what my passion is
(And the) money talks so I always have words to answer this (yep)
I can't relax cause its like I'm a fetti activist
Might see me on tv never a mat-tress

[Hook]

Don't go to sleep

Sleep banger

[Hook] (2x)[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
My name is Krizz Kaliko
I'm totally alone here
Well, maybe just one of few left
If anybody's out there, anybody -- please, help!

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
This music game here is in a state of emergency
All about currency, wackness reoccurring with urgency
Can't take it any more
Maybe I'm getting too old, mouth piece just too cold
It's getting me swole
I need to occupy hip-hop like it's my concubine
But I'm the nigga so that mean I gotta be the bigger one
Tell Rittz to pull the trigger all them niggas is done
If I miss then all the hits you can name under the sun
It's a trick and how they doing this, music is done
Tell man don't mic me up
Tell the weed people light me up
Your CD don't hype me up
YouTube fans like me up
You too loose man, tighten up
I don't need to be a Freshman, I'm fresh, no yes men
Rap 'til I can't breathe let me catch my breath and
Industry needs Epinephrine
Pastor what you see better get the reverend
Rapping overseas but I rap Midwestern
Krizz the bee's knees so I guess the best in
Me I gets deeper than your depth perception
MCs believe in me and there's no question
This is my S.O.S. to you and also FU too
And I won't step to you again
And I'mma hold my breath for you to stop these checks
Comin' to these train wrecks of many men
Try to save it try to stay connected resurrected
Never expecting me to win
One of hip-hop's last few legends
I'm holding a grudge until the end

[Hook]
Hollering "Mayday!"
Anybody can you hear me?
Yeah, me
Why do they mistreat us, save us
Aimless bastards leave us, shameless
By the time we're rich and famous
All our art will be forsaken
While you're waiting sides are taken
Nonsense they just keep on makin'
While our last breath we are takin'
We don't want our heartbeats just to stop - stop - stop

[Verse 2: Rittz]
They love me on the internet
But they don't wanna see me on no magazine cover
Half of these wack rappers never see struggle
I've been fighting all my life and never let my knees buckle
Now I finally made it everybody wanna seem stuck up
Me suck up to the industry suckas
Please fuck ‘em I can barely afford to eat supper
Now you telling me the work that I put in and all the years we hustled
Makin' music now somebody wanna eat a piece of it
Fuck you and your snap back and your wack rap
You suck, you suck, he sucks too
They rap, he raps, she raps, he’s wack please that’s killing me
What you an MC, what’s new
Just shoot me
You should go to college
You could join the army
You could be a barber
You can be anything you wanna be but not a rap artist
Your lyrics ain't cutting it, you suck as a performer
Sorry to inform ya
What you mad and wanna battle me you gonna need some armor
I try to keep it calm but, every time I log on to WorldStar I see a bunch of shit
I know is gonna piss me off more
The comments are worse than the rappers are
Fans say that you're the best, spectacular
The next minute they talking about how wack you are
It's no wonder why I always wanna smack someone
I need a magic wand, abracadabra gone, your shit is past beyond bad
It's trash it's scum you need to practice some
I hear you rap and yawn
That bullshit I heard you spit will never have its run
Bullshit music fucked this game up
You should be embarrassed you should be ashamed of
Ever trying to rap I think it's time to change up
Rittz and Krizz Kaliko, adios

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Here we go now
Horror flick, you should start with the sequel
Peephole, what I saw to deceive you
I’m the doctor that walks in and greets you
And serve you a smile like I’m all for the people
Meanwhile I’m the wrong one to speak to
To hell with a bark or my dogs will delete you
The bars are illegal and all this is lethal
It’s Conrad Murray when he walk in and greet you
I sharpen the needles, let it rewind
Badder flow, that’ll mess up your mind
Got a Kaliko, got a Tech and a N9ne
And more weapons then everyone on this record combined
And that’s strange
Cause I seem so nice, I seen your wife
No better yet, I seen her twice
She needed flights, I got ‘em when I seen the price
And let her roll with me like she had some green to dice
I know it’s been a while since I sold a platinum too
A million and a million-and-a-half of you
You tell me I’m the rapper you was rappin’ to
I have you lookin’ like a mummy when they wrappin’ you
Don't be up with my face when I'm asking you
You better leave space like a NASA crew
I didn’t have dollars, now I have a few
And now they look at my garage and tell me that’s a zoo
Is that a Jaguar?
Of course it is, I purchased it because the corpse’ll fit
And this trunk is bigger than the Porsche’s is
They say I changed, well I call it metamorphosis
Fast lane, get the hell up outta my lane
Your brain will never be as quick as my brain
Advil will only cure you for a time frame
But I got a bullet that’ll get rid of your migraine

[Hook][Intro - Chamillionaire - talking]
Haha, a wise man once told me keep me your friends close and keep your enemies closer
And he only got close enough to tell me that because, well he was a enemy
Shout out to all my frenemies, haha, Major Pain boy
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
I'm in first place, in this wonderful World chase
I'm a current case of a rapper that won't break
Playin dirty (yeah), I'm too sick with the word play
I make words that don't rhyme start rhymin like "you're gay"
Be on your way, I'm a mercy mercy
You be workin hard, she givin me your pay
Women walk up to me, "it's nothin" that girl say (yeah)
Stick money on my shirt like it was my birthday (hey!)
Let's go, rest mo', get slowed
I'm like "f hoes", they metroed, I'm petroed
Get blowed by your girl like red nose
And every single day I'm catchin a head cold (hachoo)
"Pimp Mode", Katt Williams, yeah them know
Put it on a tape and call it the "Best Show"
Koop' versus Chamillionaire, which is the best flow?
You'll probably see a tie like NBA dress code
Be the best to, jump up and get squashed
Just thoughts, just talk your lip gloss
Cause you spit soft, dick bosses get off
And I know what you're thinkin, I hit ya with this pause (haha)
They say you shouldn't throw stones at a glass house
Got my money up and I throw out of my stash house
What your cash 'bout? I ain't takin the tag out
Ask me why I bought it, my wallet just passed out
Rapper ran mouth and I bet he get ran out
I bet another sucker gonna follow that man route
I'm a bad cough, that sick, big, bad boss
See me and they bow like "Wow!"...Shad Moss (haha)
Tryin to say that you ain't real if you got it
Yeah I'm on the internet because it fill up my wallet
Uh, street money helped me get into college
I bust you in your face, log on and Twitter about it (woo!)
Uh, the auducity, run 'em over like athletes
Self serve means I'm the only person that's gassin me
You should ask of me, money lookin like math to me
One plus one equals equity, what it has to be
Uh, better come at your boy carefully
Or get shown the definition of real reality
Who's as bad as me? Any other name is calamity
Cause I be flippin the G's daily like Vanna be
Wanna challenge me? What a beautiful day that that'll be
You could battle me any Sunday through Saturday
You a cavity, too sweet to even handle me
I'm insanity, not sane, my brain out of me (woo)
Take a budget, turn it into confetti
If I start another label I'm a call it "Machete"
Nah, won't drop an album 'til I'm motherf'in ready
Was gonna call it "Venom", when I'm strikin I am deadly
Don't know me Mister, don't ask me about my sister
They don't really know me but label me like a risk a
You can have all the swagger, you can have the charisma
If I want your opinion, I'll log on the 'net and Twit ya (Tweet)
It's the Mister "Sicker Than Every Pic Ya Makin"
But it's no hate and they waitin to get ya issue
And it's official, I'm so official
Turn my iPhone towards me and I take a picture (cheese!)
Women say you real and say that they wanna kiss ya
Haters see it happen, that day they gonna wanna diss ya
Promise it's a myth, you need to know I will get ya
Richer, so I call up my lawyer before I hit ya (uh)
You mess with me, impossible gonna be possible
What you think we even look at the Oscars for?
Hang with me to hear product cause he a gossiper
Thought that we was fly but ain't like a ostrich bro (woo)
That's why I say no way, Larry King of this thing, my pay stay okay
Mixtapes in the street and pass A plus K
Aunt Jemima plus vagina, you a sweet pussy
Every verse is a better verse, you know what it's worth
Since my birth been blessed with a curse, realest on the Earth
It's a curse, get another nurse, in a mini skirt
Make her work 'til her feet is hurt, open up your purse, Captain Kirk
I can't ever be, she'll be payin me (me)
Walkin through the mall like we on a shopping spree (spree)
Open up the garage, yeah everything you see, black on black like the NAACP
Gettin money, yeah I let the cat out
I get any sicker then I'm probably gonna pass out
In the studio cause they sleep on me like the black couch
Still got mad clout, that's what haters is mad 'bout
Here we go, here we go, I'm in the studio
My whip got me feelin like my name was Domino
Cause it's a big six with me everywhere I go
Your chick is still tryin to get me in a figure four
Lookin for some hotness, let a heat seeker know
George Bush, one push, let a heat seeker go
Hit the studio, there goes another heat seeker "whoa!" (whoa)
But I don't know why they doubt cause I've done this before (whoa)

[Outro - Chamillionaire - talking]
I want a hundred million dollars, hundred million dollars
Hundred million dollars, hundred million dollars
Try to get on my level, try to get on my level, let's go, um"Sippin, sippin on lean, sippin, sippin on bo'"

[Bun B]
Comin down grippin grain, diamonds up against the wood
Tops drop, blades chop, trunk is popped, I'm lookin good
Swangin down the boulevard, chunky deuce, the fifth is shinin
The queen is ridin shotgun and Finger's behind me
So never you mind me, I'm just hustling, grindin
My pockets are heavy and my diamonds are blindin
My pistols are loaded and cocked so know that I'm ready
I'll die for my family dog but I'll kill for my fair day
R.I.P. to my baby bro, UGK until
It ain't no stopping this movement, you lose on the real
Cause we keeping it trill, that's from ashes to dust
We got paper to make and fake nigga's asses to bust
If you down for your hood, and you bangin that Screw
Put your sets in the sky, cause this one is for you
Keep on keepin it true, fuck haters and again
Cause we don't play the game to say we play, we play to win

[Hook: Mistah F.A.B.] {X2}
Leanin to the side, you cain't speed through
Two miles per hour, so everybody sees you
Ridin by myself, with the pistol in the do'
"Sippin, sippin on lean, sippin, sippin on bo'"

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Candy on my big wheel, yeah man I'm still a kid
Twenty-six, rims same age as me, can you dig?
Ridin down the block, knockin pictures off your wall
Just showin off my grill made by Paul Wall
Alpine speakers in my grill on blast
Like my boys in Texas, hittin corner on them slabs
Seat laid back, you know how us pimps be
Keep your head up Bun B, rest in peace Pimp C
A mill' on mine rolled back to back and young millionaires we haven't scratched
Rhyme through the hood and habitat, candy paint look like some cabbage patch
Haters hot, they mad at that, Chamillionaire, how F.A.B. get that?
Two dimes in a car, how bad is that? King of the jungle, you an alley cat
Prince of the coast brought Cali back, just threw some D's on a Cadillac
Smoke so much, got cataracts, been rollin up for a matter of fact
F.A.B. get love where F.A.B. is at, from the Bay to the South where them slabs is at
Oakland down to Houston, only rollin with them savage cats

[Hook] {X2}

[Chamillionaire] {*Over Hook: Chamillitary mayne, yeah*}
It's gon' be, F-A-C, T to the Feds gon' mess with me
And F-A-B, when they see, mixtape money yes they pay me
Mugabe, Inspector G, bring 'em all cause they cain't get me
Ten vehicles parked in the yard, pick your choice, I'll get that key
Take that jet out to West, let's swang and get our swerve on
Hit that strip in my whip, gon' strip and let them sexy curves show
Vehicle sittin very low, pimp that caddy very slow
They like "Yeah, Chamillionaire, the realest I done heard holmes"

[Paul Wall]
I'm leanin to the side sideways, sittin crooked
My Jolly Rancher paint got all of the people lookin
I'm beatin down the block, givin the streets an ass whoopin
Peep the way a player move, take notes lil young-un
I'm movin slow mo', leanin off a potent fo'
Pistol in my lap, plus another one in the side do'
You know I'm just a young hustler all about my doe
Gettin cake and stackin up that paper, I need mo'

[Hook] {X2}

"Sippin, sippin on lean, sippin, sippin on bo'"(187, 187, 187)
(Who's next?)

[Intro - Chopped and Screwed Voice - talking behind Hook] - w/ ad libs
Screwed Up Click
You know what this means, right?
Clover G! Let's go
Yeah, I'm too real to be an actor
Ya dig?
You know who you are
You be home, you behind the mic
Not me though

[Hook]
"Nigga's a threat, too real to be an actor" - 8X

[Verse 1 - Lil' Flip]
This ain't a movie, this more like a screenplay
Cause on the real I went to the block each day (for real)
The G way, so hit me on my three way
Look if you want to live, you better take it easy
You jump, fly with me, I clip your wings off
You violate me again, I infa beam y'all
This H-Town, the home of the trunk poppers
Oh and I'm on that kush nigga, I'm a funk doctor
I make hits in the streets and in the booth
So keep playin I'll put one on you (YOU)
I'm tatted up, cause I love takin pain
I give my artist's a cheat and tell 'em "keep the change"
I ain't petty player, I buy the whole thang
My work pure since you want to talk blow man
I got that shit that made Len Bias overdose
Yours truly, the King of the Third Coast

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
Yo, it's Koopa baby, uh
Jackers pay attention and don't get the script confused
Cause I promise Black & Decker ain't gon' miss you with the tools
Better duck before you lose, like McDuck or Mr. Scrooge
I ain't givin away a golden cent or nothin to you fools
Clownin on the camera, tryin to get you on the news
Sometimes the cloest ones, the ones who tryin to see you lose
They say that family matters, tell Urkel that I'm the truth
Because I'm a be a Family Guy until Stewie gets it misconstrued
Scratchin off the serial, materials get thrown away
For jackers, I got that serial, I'm pouring out the Special K
Don't get blown away, plot and you will bowl away
From no one just with a Cheerio size hole to stay
Homie it ain't no debate, some Pirelli's known to hate
So I had to motivate a set of O's to hold my swangs
Tippin on my rollerblades, head to toe way on them thangs
Tickets just get thrown away like I was supposed to pay

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lil' Flip]
Look, aye it's way too late to try to make peace
Just be glad they didn't find your ass on the streets
First they said H-Town wasn't gonna blow
But we proved 'em wrong, even Bun B went gold
I'm Michael Phelps, the way I swim up in your wife
Look I'm the reason her juice box ain't tight
(Who the King of Houston?), y'all better say me
Cause Def Jam Vendetta is the only way you'll play me

[Verse 4 - Chamillionaire]
NBA Live 2006, only way that they'll play me
I was born to be a boss and you just a trainee
In money that we trust, so you can trust in me
Cause I am money, you should see how much I clutched this week
They say that money talks, so you can trust this speech
It's Barack O'Balla baby, let's do lunch, let's feast
Landlord of the H, let's discuss this lease
If you in Texas and you leanin, then adjust your seat, for Pimp C

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Lil' Flip - talking]
Hey, we too real man
For real, yeah
Too real to be an actor, man
(187, 187, who's next?) 187, who's next?
Hahaha
Hey Cham man
It feel good to be amongst the platinum elite club baby
Hey let 'em know
The grind don't stop, Flipgates, Chamillionaire
It's Volume 4, right?
Hey Cham man, let these niggas know man
I'm fuckin with these beats now
682-561-8900[Hook]
Say that she a model and she know how to dance (dance)
She do what she want she ain't got no man at allll
Say she not a groupie and she a steelers fan
I said girl if that's true then I'm a let you know the plan
And you should go and bring some partners thorugh
Let's chill after the superbowl (superbooowl)
Maybe me and you can kick it for a few
After the packers loooose
Here lizard, lizard, lizard

[Verse 1]
I took my Black Card out and slid it
Told my crew that it's time to get it
Black & yellow crime scene tape just so you know who did it
Got a clip and you can fit it
Ever on no band wagons
So if you bet me bring my change
And a couple rubber band wagons, pants sagging
Chick you having she nicknamed me the dragon
Cause she know that I spit that fire
And my dick so big that it be draggin
Yea your misses prolly having carpet burns while she grabbin
Knees red look like she bein giving head to aladdin
Why they rapping cause it's a rap
You can not like koopa but don't get slapped
Never seen losers in yellow and black
And they call them the Packers cause they's gon' pack
Know what I mean told the green
Bay gon' be the losing team
Only thing me and Green Bay got in common is the green

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ey I spit his just to be like I told ya
Steelers win stole that game over
Then I wroom start in a range rover
Packers just got signed like solar
Front page steelers stealinyour exposure
Murderer fam never get closure
Why my money stay HIGH as a toker
Cause I got as much drive as a chauffer, ha
Chicks straight up out of Playboy
Kinda mirror I'm a whip it like a play toy
Ally year with the internet cake boy
Matter fact you ain't on my rap radar
I'm too dope boy, get cash
You can back and just let me get that
My whip fast, when I whip fast
Got em breaking they neck you can call it whiplash
Pull her jeans low frappuchino
Cause she be creamin when I touch
Never bein ready my hustle game heavy
I bet your dreams I'l get to crushed
Can't rock with chamillionaire
He be singing way too much
Well I'm a keep singing so you keep comin and just swinging on my nuts
Hold up

[Hook][Hook - Chamillionaire] - 2X
Ain't nobody cool as me
Ain't nobody cool as me
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody, ain't nobody cool as me

Hold up

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
First of all let's talk about these leeches that be on my sack
Thinkin that I'm gon' get sacked, I Reggie Bush your cornerback
The realest that's on a plaque, the realest to get on a track
Just point me to where you at and I'll visit it on a map
No I'm not gonna say your name, you too lame to be announced
Keep my name up out your mouth and my success gonna take it out
To me it's raining in a drought, you fakers that's fadin out
You mad cause I'm what it is and just what it ain't about
And I came with a gang of clout, showed up with a Rapid Ric
He came with a stack of chips you can't explain with a adjective (huh, huh)
Catch me chillin with Victoria models
I be on twenty hour flights, layin horizontal
And you will want to but you can't even fathom
You ain't headed to the Opera, you can't even Phantom
See I hear 'em talkin but I can't understand 'em
These rappers hate the King but can't say that he isn't jammin
You say you hate me and think you rap so greatly
You should step up to the plate, do your best to replace me
That's what I thought, you can't do it, cause you ain't me
You flowin in a analog and I'm flowin in HD
Don't get a fan and a male groupie to confuse faker
Confuse it with a male groupie, it's probably you hater
Forget a newspaper, I'm tryin to do new data
So stuck to the viral money, it's feelin like glue paper
F it, I'm 'bout to get rid of my whole fleet
Just gon' keep any car that came before '03
Whole league, guacamole, I am on key
They said you have to be the best, so I'll just own me, yeah

[Hook][Intro - Chamillionaire - talking]

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire - singing]
I used to not know why haters would try so hard to hate (why they hatin baby?)
Until I moved up from Ramen Noodles to shrimp and steak
Ewww (I know you like that steak)
Girl (filet mignon)
You can order what you like (haha, it's on me)
You can order what you like (haha, it's on me baby)

Ewww (you're feelin great baby)
Girl, I'm a help you clear your mind
I'm a help you clear your mind (Chamillitary mayne)

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire - rapping]
Uh, yeah
She said "Hakeem, we should pause for a quick flick"
Seen my jewels, I remind her of Slick Rick
Dough that'll grow like we heatin up biscuits
Chamill got a mil that's as cheesy as it gets (I don't get it)
Cheddar, Velveeta with the money
I don't break a sweat baby, even if it's sunny
Ladies they love me, I'm Fresh like Doug E
I hated being broke so I made money my buddy (haha)
I promise I don't say it just to spit it (spit it)
Go to Saint Martin and tell 'em I already did it (did it)
French or the Dutch side, tell me if you with it (with it)
Cook like the Curry goin be finished in a minute
Steak's so large, she goin to say she want to split it (split it)
Passport fool, you would think I run the city (city)
Put me on the stand, I'm like "ah, damn (ah, damn)
I promise there's a witness that saw me gettin in that - pool
Yeah, the Thrilla in Manila (woo)
Thrilla in Manila, naw I'm trilla than Manila

While I'm bumpin that "Trilla", while I feel ya in the villa (villa)
Business man, do whatever stop no ma'am
BlackBerry's near, always lookin for mo' grands
Ronald Isley is the sound of the slow jam
If sex is a weapon, then I'm ready to go BLAM! (hah)
Get a two day tan
Cause the other two days, me and you stay in
Turn backwards like Kriss and them used to do they pants
Your homegirl just mad, cause her dude ain't Cham
The kid goin to prevail when it come to the skills
Like LL "I be doin it and doin it well"
But right now when I do it, I don't do it for sales (oh yeah?)
When I do what I be doin, I just do it for self (haha)

[Hook] - w/ ad libs
All around the world, girls all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world
All around the world, girls all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world
All around the world, all, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world
All around the world, all, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world

[Outro - Chamillionaire - talking over the Hook]
Yeah, we in Dubai on a peninsula baby
Not an island, a peninsula
An island is completely surrounded by water
And a peninsula is almost all the way surrounded by water
Haha, we do it big like that
Hugh Hefner's next door too
What up Hef?[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
You would never know
If you could ever be
If you never try
You would never see
Stayed in Africa
We ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn't he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't feared so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by the W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions, Civil War got avoided
Little black Sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as a old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Quran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where FOX News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins Mandela peace prize

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Martin luther had a dream got a movie in my head and it's
So repetative so I think that it's time to tell em it
Who's ahead of it bun b would be the president
Cause all us texas boys id do it bigger than they ever did
Not so competitive nobody would be your nemesis
Ain't no devilish sinners doing what the devil did
A muslim sits at a coffee table with the methadist
Listen to method man talking tell em what the method is
Can do it effordless he would be who your professor is
Mr ice cubes who we use to watch the defacites
Just a brief case wouldn't have ta wear a vest with it
Saving in your cheque and bank account wouldn't be so decilate
And what's a pessimist every person would be gettin chips
Wayne and sean carter would be 2 people you would never diss
To make a living strippers wouldn't have to show there nakedness
They would make 6 figures just to serve a plate of beverages
Lil kim in the lab mixin like a chemist did
Nicki minaj she the potion tell her that she messed with it
No fighting with a record label to get levarage
Gucci mane would be the c.e.o and talk with eliquence
Just like elephants everybodies pockets hella thick
Koopa wonders this but for now well say it's tenative
Reality shows stars always show intelligence
And nobody would have to beef because we all be gettin rich

I know this this type of dream seems like a stretch
But everyone of us would be the best
With plenty of money
Yea everyone of us would see the change
And we would never have to worry bout dealing with stress
Cause really none of us would be depressed
We would do what we wanted
Ya couldn't tell me that that wouldn't be freshhhh

[Hook:]

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy I cordially invite you to
Ask why can't it be?
Now we can do nothing bout the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make fast or we can make it last
Every woman Queenin' and every man a Kingin'
When those color lines come we can't see between
We just close our eyes 'til it's all black every-THING

[Hook][Intro: Al Pacino]
The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own mark, and enforce it
We gotta think big now
Think big

[Verse 1]
Sitting in my jacuzzi, sitting in my jacuzzi
Over here talking about 9-5, nah, that ain't gon' move me
Anything less than ten, bro, that's that old Nintendo
Cause y'all playin' games, stop playing games, I spent that on my windows
(You spent that on your) N-O, I spent that on my ten ho
When your dough get long enough, then they said you got extendo
You can turn your doors to bulletproof and that won't stop an attempt, though
Ain't worried about anybody shooting through cause I'm thinking 'bout the demo
(Hello? Hello?) Don't call me on the wrong Jack
(Don't call you on the wrong, what?) No, just hang up and don't call back
Hope your car is trustworthy, hope you got the car fax
Hope you don't open the door and explode right after contact
I keep a banana with me, I think I'm Axel Foley
Hope you get my point like you try not to be a goalie
You said "they have real rubber", what's this garbage they sold me
If the world was sucker free, then I'd probably be here lonely

[Hook]
If you ain't got it, you ain't God of me and you just ain't the same
Got that viral "Ammunition", watch me hit them with the pain
Sitting in my Jacuzzi, watching a groupie do her thang
If she work it well enough, I might remember this girl's name
Moving through the airport, hundreds with the small face
I know they gon' check me so they [?]
Walk into the [?] house, she thought this was our place
This my house, what you think, it's Scarface

[Bridge]
Yeah, this world is all mine
Yeah, this world is all mine
I said, yeah, this world is all mine
Yeah, this world is all mine

[Interlude: Al Pacino]
You need people like me, so you can point your fucking fingers, and say "that's the bad guy." Well say good night to the bad guy!

[Verse 2:]
All mine, all mine, come and take me up off the throne
They'll pull my hollows up out your dome
And I'm back in town, I ride alone, they tryna run up inside my home
Copycats, my body clones, oh, no, they softer than Styrofoam
If your problems with me is on wax
I'm gon' argue with you, that's non-fact, I don't buy them weed, I buy 'em back
I could sit on top of these tall Gats, just sit on top of these tall stacks
And be higher than you little liars in, you still wouldn't get to reach where I'm at
I lead where I'm at, and I'm poppin' up on you out the blue
Who you think that you talkin' to, what that do casa mi casa, fool
Keep surveillance for all my haters, you watchin' me, well, I'm watchin' you
Keep the butcher knife and a drill, just try not to get chopped and screwed

[Hook]

[Bridge][Intro]
Hey there little fella
I know you missed me
You’re a mean little fella aren’t you?
You hungry?

Chamillitary mayne

Here lizard lizard lizard
Here lizard lizard lizard
Major pain major pain
Here lizard lizard lizard
Here lizard lizard lizard
Major pain
Here we go

Hustlers and my players let’s talk to these haters (Pain)
Do your boy a favor turn right to your neighbors (Pain)
We got of the majors but still doing major (Pain)
Nobody can save ya when Koopa bring that major pain (Pain)

Left, Left, Left, Right Left, Pain, Left, Left, Left, Right Left, Pain
Left, Left, Left, Right Left, Pain, Left, Left, Left, Right Left
Here we go

Nah I won’t let them turn me pop even though my little niece like Justin Beiber
Yeah I made that song Ridin' Dirty but that should let ya know that I clutch a heater
Yeah I got played by Michael Jordan and I swear MJ he such a diva
Moral of the story is I don’t care cuz yeah I’m still here plus I don’t need ya
Yeah I met a girl at taco bell that slipped me her number in a fajita
Funny thing is I ain’t order that, I took that ho back and got her pita
Why I gotta get back on my throne on and keep turning these fake fans to believers
Yeah I got a call from my major label I swear I hung up tha receiver

Do you wanna be successful so bad that you know you would do it ever?
Would you be the one to jump the ship to be safe or hold that ship together?
Would you be the chick that try to leave when you can’t live like Cinderella?
Would you be broke and chill with god or you would be rich and with the devil?
What you gonna do when the music stops or would you still do this accapela?
That decision is really yours and it really ain’t much that I could tell ya
What I know is that I ain’t you and my words I’ll be the realest ever
Chamillitary will rain forever just know I ain’t talking about the weather

Right and then left (left) right and then left (left)
March with me forever soldier take another step (step)
Right and then left (left) right and then left (left)
March with me forever soldier take another step

This is for you know who and don’t you ever be mislead
I know just how I said it and I meant just what I just said
I feel as good as ever when I hop outta my bed
Baby you ain’t living life you must be already dead[Chamillionaire - Part I:]
Chamilitaryman
Come to Houston, Texas
Where the hustlers and the players play
The cars be oldschool
Like the Clyde Drexler fade-away
The haters say
Oh, we really be riders, came to take the grills, swinging wheels
'til they get introduced to the stainless steels
I can niggas say the thrill
The name, really, them heard about
My murder ???
Killin' the charts
U fellin' that burner shot
Y'all know, Banjo and I'm gonna get fatty banks
Flirtin' with a pretty ass
German, her man is pretty mad
Cuz I'm the truest lookin' cool as
Wonder how i make more than the president in the US
I'm not the vice-president, i just like presidents
So i get dough and than i go high than night ambulance
Be quiet, cuz say what snitch kids
What u wouldn't believe it was true like a memphis
So i won't get descriptive
But i'll tell u how to get a hundred gram
Understand, you can't fit a hundred inside a rubber band

[Hook 2x]
Wir sind am Riden
Ich hab kein Plan was ihr Fucker wollt
Fenster runter und die Boxen bis an Anschlag
We're ridin'
Ich hab kein Plan was ihr Fucker wollt
(sit-sittin' on my chrome)

[Olli Banjo - Part II:]
Ich bin am r-riden, ich roll auf Zwanzigern
Ich sitz easy über dem Rest, Rap-Deutschland hat mein Schwanz im Arsch
Ich mache den besten Rap in Deutschland, die Toys sind Depp
Dieser Banjo war der beste Act aufm Splash, frag die deutschen Heads
Ich bin der schönste Rapper Deutschlands auch mit Winterkickz
Gegen mich wirkt Chuck Norris wie ein lesbisches Kindermädchen
Ich komm vom Affen wie Tarzan, du bekommst Dschungelfieber
Groupies wollen an meinem Ast knabbern wie ein schwuler Biber
Ich mach Party wie ein Tier im Club
Ich hab mir eine Fanbase aufgebaut wie Adi in den Vierzigern
Hol dir nen Helm, Ellenbogen- und Ohrenschutz
Komm zu meinem Gig, ich mach Häuser kaputt wie George Bush
Du willst es nicht fronten was ich über den Beat zieh
Du willst auf einmal wieder nach hause wie E.T
Dein rap ist veraltet, Oldschool und fegt den Friedhof leer
Ich ride d-d-dirty über den Beat mit Chamillionaire

[Hook 2x]

[Olli Banjo - Part III:]
Das ist Lifeshow, ihr Fucker seid alle Pommes
Ich mach richtige Alben, nicht zehn Lieder für die Tonne
Ich bin ein Fels in der Brandung, g-guck mein Stehvermögen
Ohne Promo verkauf ich so wie ein Act beim Majorlabel
Ich hab das nach Bello höchstgechartete Mixtape Deutschlands
Also frag mich nicht ob ich von dieser Performance enttäuscht war
Ich hab treue Fans, ich weiss, dass ich Familie hab
Die ganz genau wissen dass ich für sie für immer Liebe hab
Ich roll easy mit Chamillionaire, guck mein Status
Ich bin der coolste live-Rapper und du bist Arschloch
Ich pack Seele in die Musik ohne Phrasenfüller
Ihr Heinzelmännchen seid laufende Klischees, ihr Abziehbilder
Ich kann alles, rappen, häkeln und essen kochen
Katja is die Coolste und macht mich zum Unterwäschemodell
Das ist Lifeshow, dieses Album ist kochend heiß
In einem Atemzug mit Illmatic, Chronic und Doggystyle

[Hook 2x][Intro]
Niggas better see a nigga roll
Starch diamonds and I'm rollin on 84

[Chorus 2X]
Ay, ay, ay swang and I swang and I swang to the left
I pop my trunk and now she tellin me she's so impressed (yes)
It's the answer machine (yes), it's the answer machine
Leave the message for me after the tone

[Verse]
If you callin bout some money, you say I owe you youse a bloody lie
That's a science fiction like that movie with the ugly fly
Money stackin high, got it lookin like a money sky
Jam rag by your thigh, (ha ha!) baby youse a bloody lie
I don't care what they show you OR they tol' you, (tol' you) nigga please!
Tell you-know-who they shouldn'ta been bootleggin my mix CD (please!)
Some of y'all sucks, so keep suckin while I squirt and squeeze
Liftin up the muscle, like, "Hercules! Hercu-LES!!"
Hope you don't hurt ya knees, let me grant ya next wish
Awkward feelin that you got soon as you leave ya ex-it
Ladies, don't be shy, give it a try, you should mess wit
The Mixtape Messiah's runnin in, that's right you guessed it
Laid up wit a broad (broad), help me with my message
It's Chamilitary mayne, you know who the best is
You know won't nobody in the underground can test this
You know who the flyest and the freshest in the flesh is
Nah, I got no daughter or no son, but I confess this
A playa in a playa that I'd know you'd be impressed wit
I could sit here braggin about how lovely that my sex is
But words cannot describe my lovin in a couple seconds
Enough wit all the small talk, come over and undress miss
You won't have a small thought when you come and undress this
Naw, just say "ah" open up ya jaw and press this
Up against ya tonsils then after that I'll press this..

[Chorus 2X]*Song borrows the beat from LL Cool J's "Baby"*

[Intro - Chamillionaire]
You just reached the answer machine
When you call me, I'm never answerin
Umm, I be always hustlin, so that's the reason that I'm gone
So maybe you will understand, why I can't pick up the phone
(Leave a message)

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Yes she's a pro (pro), sex and a slow (slow)
American Idol, a professional show (woo)
Givin you a vote and it's impressive to know
When she open her mouth that she was destined to blow (whoa)
How you tell me you ain't impressed with my dough?
This ain't the type of money you done messed with before
Stretchin the dough (dough), best with the flow (flow)
Sick the way I spit, they say I'm blessed with a cold
Touchin your body, leave your flesh with a glow
Chasin the Pussycat and tryin to get with Nicole
Really that's a myth, my confession is no (no)
Really I'm on the grind and tryin to get with the dough (dough)
Game's to be sold, can you dig what I'm sellin?
If it's a crime, they gon' say that I'm felon
Sexual eruption, you eruptin like seven
While I'm singin out, I just want to +F You+ like Devin
Lights, cameras, action, I hope you're not Ellen
Talk show, is exactly what you're not gettin
Money's my cologne and the scent that I'm smellin
So gold diggin women say my scent is like heaven, heaven, heaven
Shocked when I knocked her
Love my company, but that's a Gamble like Proctor
Before your boyfriend sneak up on you like 'got ya!' (got ya)
Better straighten up like posture

[Hook - Chamillionaire]
I'm not your - baby
Your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm not your - baby
Your baby, your baby, your baby
And you so - crazy
So crazy, so crazy, so crazy
And you so - crazy
So crazyyyyy
You really need to stop callin my phone

[Break - Woman - talking]
Hello?
So why are you not answerin the phone
You said you were going to call me right back
And it's been like a minute and a half
And I don't know why you would say you would call me right back
If right back, isn't right back
I mean when I say I'm going to call you right back
I call you right, back
And I mean I just don't understand why your not answering the phone
If you don't want to talk to me
It's like why ...

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
Errr, message erased, got to get to the cake
You actin like a billion is easy to make
Other rappers out there tryin to get an estate
That's a house, while I'm out tryin to get me a state
Uh, so now you tryin to get all of my case
And I just met you last week, you should try brakes
Slow yourself down, now I'm ready to migrate
Should have never hit you back on myspace
(I'm not your baby)

[Break - Woman - talking]
So I'm, I'm still waitin for you to call me back
I don't know what you're doing
What you're not doing, who you're with
Like, you need to talk to me, okay?
We need some, we have to talk about some things
I miss you, I haven't seen you
It's been like, three days
And I just want to know where you are
I just want to hear your voice
You know like, you have no idea how it makes me feel
Knowing that your doing, whatever your doing
You know, and, and your not checking on me
And I'm checking on you
I want somebody to call me
The way I call you, I mean I can ...

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
Errr, message erased, you ain't even my chick (chick)
And three days ago, you saw the profile pic (pic)
On the internet, talkin like you legit
And a Stan is a man, but you must be a Sis
Better bother Rapper Rick, or go call K.J
Better call Masa or pick up May Bay
Go and call Tyson or go call Ray J
Call Hurricane and he might say +A Bay Bay+

[Outro - Operator Recording]
"The number you have reached is not in service at this time
And there is no new number
Please be sure you have checked the telephone directory for the right number
And you are dialing correctly
This is a recording
If you need help, you need help, hang up, hang up
And then di, and then di, and then di" (*echo*)

Female voice: Chamillitary mayne[Intro]
Yeeeeaaaahh
Venom on the way
You already know, it’s yours truly Chamillionaire
I woke up this mornin’ and uhhh...well actually I didn’t wake up cause I really never go to sleep
But uhm, this is what came cross to my mind
I don’t know about you but

[Hook]
My hustle game, Awesome

And That wood grain, Awesome
Hustle every day I wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’

See you gotta wake up everyday thinkin’ bout’ how you gonna get to the money
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’
I don’t know about you but that’s what I do. Venom on the way

[Verse 1]
Wait until they see the futuristic-ness I’m flossin’ in
I don’t F with Michael, I’m caucasian Air Forcin’ ‘em
Marchin’ in my telly, ladies talk to me like Carson when
She callin’ me daily baby “I just wanna talk to him”
Ya’ll be readin’ rumors ya’ll XXL and sourcin’ ‘em
I’m hollin’ at Obama why he ask if I’m gon’ tour with him
They know you important when your rims is lookin’ porcelain
They didn’t even got ‘em. How I get em? From importin ‘em
Portland, ya’ll already know I’m back to scorchin’ em
It’s a suicide bout to kill em like I’m corpsin’ em
Better dodge ya eyes if you’re tryna beef because of him
Behy dodge ya eye if you ever think of crossin’ em
Homie don’t do it good advice what you should offer him
You don’t wanna be the dummy jumpin’off the porch with him
Say that he gon’ get me then he better bring his boys with him
Your hood can be your home bring it on, and I’m gon’ orphan ‘em!
Why the heck they mad I already earned a fortune and
Your chick is taking pictures pulling polaroids to portrait him
So outta this world, yeah my swagger is in the orbit and
They lookin’ at my neck it’s like he “he brought the jewlry store with him”
That crosses them. Texas boys they brought they candy toys with ‘em
They gon’ earn this that boy Ray face got Slim the boss with him
They'd be in that tone, in that Dallas, in that Austin and
The underground ain’t dead cause my hustle game is awesome man

[Hook]
My hustle game, Awesome
She say my chain, Awesome
See me in my whip and the ladies say, Awesome
My candy paint, Awesome
And That wood grain, Awesome
Hustle every day I wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Hold up I’m thinkin’ white make, I’m thinkin’ diamonds so pink lil like you can drink!
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Hold up I’m thinkin’ takin’ everything in the game including the kitchen sink!

[Verse 2/ Outro]
XXL tried to call it preaching in the streets I motivate
Texas you know what it is, Venom album on the way
You ain’t takin’ me to jail, I ain’t really got more to say
Take my license on the dash and put my pistol on display
Koopa[Chamillionaire]
I run with niggas that be smokin' stanky-danky on some twankies
Won't curse inside my verse, but ya misses is tryin' to blank me, hold up
No need to thank me, I'm just tryin' to get my cabbage
Better than average, Chamillion's the baddest even in Dallas, hold up
My trunk don't pop, my trunk stay locked
I got 2 Glocks, and 2 15's in the back of the drop
And you can snack on a cock, if you thinkin' you Miss Thang
I grip-grain pull up on chrome, and watch ya lip-hang, hold up[Hook]
Cause I'm the bad guy (bad guy)
Cause I'm the bad guy (bad guy)
Cause I'm the bad guy
They getting mad, they pointing at me (ha ha)
They gon' be mad why
They gon' be mad why
They gon' be mad, cause they'll never be me
Never, since I'm the bad guy
And I'm gonna be the best damn bad guy that I can be


[Verse 1]
Look around and you'll notice that I'm surrounded by soldiers
Them other niggas can stay away from me, I call them roaches
Them scared suckers, they scatter when they see trouble approaches
Some hate me cause I'm the realest, some hate me cause I'm the coldest
No, don't be scared of the soldiers, no, don't be scared of my homies
I'll beat your ass by myself, they just out here rooting for me
So anybody got a problem, speak up now or just hold your peace
No knife and no batter please, just bring your fist to the beef
Some call it beef that I have, I call I beef that I had
See me in the streets and don't speak, like your teeth in a glass
Know when you're heated and mad, but you get no reason to pass
Cause I feel like teaching a class, how quick I can beat your ass

[Pre-Chorus]
They keep telling me I look for trouble
But it seems like trouble just follows me (hey)
So there's drama everywhere that I go
Cause I can spot a hater a mile away (hater)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Don't get it twisted, I'm feeling like if it's
A need to get physical, it'll get critical real quick
I'm the nigga they fear, they point at me like they wanted me
Like a beat down is gonna be what they gonna put on to me
Hate that they're feeling happy, mugging and grinning at me
And thinking 'bout at getting at me, that won't happen here, lil' daddy
Police is even as mad, seeing me creeping in SLAB's
Scanner that beep on the dash, while they still peeping my tags
True public enemy, niggas know the description of that
Usually be in the 'lac,  platinum teeth and be black
But I stay peeping all that, I'm riding clean as a whistle
Registered, passed the inspection, insurance, see it's official

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Most of them niggas you see around, scared to tell you what's on their mind
Most of the niggas you see around me, ready to, ready to put it down
See niggas gonna attack your name, but that's all they attacking, mane
Ain't really going to click-clack the thing, in other words they actors, mane
When cameras on they don't act the same, they switch it up and turn back to lames
The bad guy is who they have to blame, y'all talk when they ask your name
You don't see them messing with me and some will say cause they ain't trusting me
Ain't cause you don't mess with me, I don't mess with you, nigga, I'm sucker-free
And the subject they discuss is me but they don't say that stuff to me
They stick to the subliminals but I feel like you speaking just to me

Get a weapon and put it right into your palms, you're invited to the slums
Look at your partners, niggas done got you walking around like you the Don
You can get beat down 'til your bloody, wondering why'd I do you wrong
Your heart trying to keep it real, your brain reminding you to run
And the streets get angry with me, get ignited through the drums
Beef included cause I do it, not just apply it to a song


[Hook](*talking*)
Balling is a habit over here, at Paid In Full
Want you to know that, g'yeah

[Hook - 2x]
Balling is a habit like Jordan, Bird and Magic
My life is fantastic, immaculate, extravagant
Got a high rise and a bachelor pad, rims tumble like acrobats
A buck sixty where the dash is at, platinum card no maxing that

[50/50 Twin]
Balling is a habit baby
Chinchilla, makes my jackets baby
I don't wanna get cash, from rapping crazy
I'm gutter I grind, stop acting crazy
Capping on wax, ain't really me
Ten G's a day, that's a brilliant week
Big faces breeder thee
Caugh nine packs, I sneeze a ki
Roll through Panama, floss the Benz
Wipe my Timberland's, off with ten's
50/50, the Lil' Twin
Leave the rap game, with a flawless win
Take a flight, in a G-4-7
Spend the night, in a East Coast setting
I'm so hot dog, I need more relish
2004, watch B.C. fetish

[Hook - 2x]

[Paul Wall]
When my car, is changing speed
I'm like Tarzan, swanging through trees
It's so much, ice in my mouth
When I take a deep breath, I get brain freeze
Millionaires wanna hang with me
R&B girls keep singing to me
The FEDs think, I'm exchanging ki's
Everyday new car, I'm exchanging keys
Boys riding in 7-45's, that was cool last year
But I'm V-12 in a 7-60, Kenyon passing me beer
I step in the club cameras flashing, girls wanna take my pic
Which girls am I taking home, I can take my pick
50/50 in fur coats, so please no finger prints on his mink
I tip the bar tender more money, than I spend on the drinks
Lil' mama keep skipping and wink, she give me glances
I'mma make a move, on them sexual advances
And by the end of the night, I can garuntee I'mma be up in them panties
I ain't never slept in the same room, twice in my house
Frosty the Snowman can build a house, with the ice in my mouth
I got more diamonds than South Africa, flawless ice is immaculate
I'm flipping the game like a spatula, now these girls ex-boyfriends mad at us

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
No spending ends, in gentlemen's
Strip clubs, it's just for spinning rims
I want it now, I get it then
Cop it drop it, cop it again
Not him again, not Bennegan's
Treat a slut for what, not fin to spend
For bitter Gin, and dinner when
I can get up in, her little friend
Rewind, back to fact that you
Get attached, to the bachelor
Cause the fact, that I captured the
Green back, she unstrapping her
Bra strap, getting back in the
Jacuzzi, cause of my macking the
Water gun'll be splashing for
The girl that hops in, right after her
Riding mayn, in a Lac with the
T.V. screens, in the back of the
Seat, Ro got strack and uh
Strapped with him, and that's because
The same person, that's dapping you
Be the same, thinking bout jacking you
Stack, is what the girl asking for
My ad-libs, is gon laugh at her (ha-ha-ha)
Koopa got you Koopa will spot you, yeah right
All she gon see, is my tail lights
And choke on the smoke, from my tail pipe
Houton Texas, endacedar
Purple stuff, if that's lavendar
Major labels, that's not what I'm asking for
Hang up the phone, I'll get back with you

[Hook - 2x][Hook]
Mmm.. I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of tah-ryin
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the BIG LEAGUES
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin, it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nuttin wrong with that, huh - batter up

[Chamillionaire]
-Look, Look
I might pull my cash out
And make ya women pass out
Cuz I get more green then a leprechaun in a grass house
Hold Up..Just shut ya trap and listen to what the Chamill-Yun say
I mo' throwed then a football on Super Bowl sunday
Even if my nuts fell off and broke in little pieces
I'd still be the first nigga to get chose by ya nieces
Look, even if the tip of my dick was ashy
Ya misses would still harass me, bout doin' the nasty
Mouth glassy, lookin' like I swallowed a mirror
Gotta brush my teeth with windex to see my ice more clearer
Ice got my lip numb, feel like I lost my lip
I don't drink and drive, Chamillion only park and sip
I'm off the (hiccup), oops I mean I'm off the hook
Niggas see me but don't speak, because I'm also a crook
Look, niggas wanna hate me, cuz they to scared to baller block this
I'll have ya girl top-less at the hotel eatin' chocolate
Wearin' nothing but boxers and you talkin' to who?
I'll make a nigga slow his roll like he was talkin' in screw
Parkin' lot pimp, I'm pullin' all the hoes in my view
A G in my wallet and a little bit of dough in my shoe
Knock-Knock, who is it?
It's the color changin' lizard
And my choppa come to pay you boot-leggin' midgets a visit
Hold up..No need to knock it if the Chamillionaire spoke it
Got niggas in Wedgewood sayin' Chamillionaire broke it
Get it right[Talking]
(This is your conscience)
What you want man?
(You can't tell em you the best man)
I can tell em whatever I wanna tell em
(Nah you can't tell em that)
How you gon' tell me that?
(That's against the rules man)
I make the rules, look look

[Verse]
Koopa, yeah I used to hoop like hula
I'm a god in the game it's the mixtape Buddha
Flew to Jamaica for some curry cuz I knew the
Residence that was there would say it ain't a kid cooler
Montay sent me the track then I laced it with Luda
Are you a boss of yourself really ain't no approval
Ring looking bluer gave thanks to my jeweler
Cause he the reason these snakes in my face like Medusa
Sue ya, now I will probably bring in a shooter
Put some bank in his bank to keep it gangsta as hoova
My name on the bullet, my bullet in the ruger
Walk into ya nightmares and introduce myself to ya
Like booyah, let em keep my name on your brain
I swang at everything your lane gone be my lane
Mayne, I gotta get change before it rain
My jeans is looking green my change is known to stain
Pain! But there is no 'T' I'm still insane
As Eminem Jay or Wayne I bet you will feel the same
Ashamed, Chamill is the name they gonna blame
For letting the news loose you lames is bout to hang
Strange how you get a name if millies ain't
The only thing in your bank you losers don't really think
Chamilli don't get big bank like Hank
I don't pick up bucks in armored trucks I pick em up in a tank
Bang! Ya already know my diamonds exposed
I never wore Kenneth Cole's I'm ghetto down to the toes
Pockets is like a drive-thru bank that don't ever close
You ever touch any dough my metal gon' hit your nose
Pretend like Unk is your conscience and you should walk it out
Hope that breaking into my vault ain't what you talking bout
Cause I got mo' paper and clips than a new office spot
Used to have one bad chick now I can call alot
This is not a driveway this is what you call a lot
Stay getting guap and just when you think it's gonna stop
You put up the top you be riding with a halter top
I cut off the top all my whips than hit the barber shop
Come to the shop get some rims on your cruiser
I can show you big blades quick as Wolverine or Krueger
I'm the mixtape ruler, Koopa
Ya chick anywhere inside the city I really think that you should move her
Who ya think your talking to you should stop
I show up at woodstock and turn it to hoodstock
Get popped like you got shot with a wood Glock
Be eating splinters for dinner who wanna take woodshop
Underground king I'm who you supposed to pay homage to
Who the heck you talking bout you bout to bring some trauma to
Let me give you fakers a quick clue about what I'mma do
I'mma run upon you with the quickness like Sonic pewwwww
Promise you gonna wake up paler than Madonna do
I'mma wake up and touch the green like a farmer do
Keep your girl away from me or I'm gonna be haunting you
I come after your boo like sandman at the apollo do
Stacks in my jeans a hundredfifty worth of rocks
All these rubberbands and rocks they call me the slingshot
Think hot when you ever see me don't think plot
Think you're sharper than a marker you turn to a ink blodge
Leak out, when I get a buck I'm bout to nut
No homo I do it solo my wallet turned to a slut
Trick what? I never get stuck I get it up
She say she wanting a cut this trigger bout to get cut
Garages like ours got camera's on each seat
Alarms is like bombs stay further than three feet
I went and bought three cars I call em a threepeat
I went and bought three mo' and I call it a repeat
Defeat, is what they gon' get when I arrive
You better open your eyes, I bet you gon' get surprised
So let me spell it out for those saying I'm telling lies
My initials is FU I'm the best rapper alive[Talking]
Yeah, Uh, The King
You already know what this is...

[Verse 1]
I am the best rapper alive
If I ain't him the best rapper done lied
They say get money, and put that to the side
But if I do that, they gone think it's a tie
Who's sicker than I?
Look me in the eye
Ya'll fake rappers must be ready to die
Yeah, Yeah, I'll fix that. Click, Clack, Get back
Getting paid is a better feelin'
I don't wanna take the shot of penicillin
I ain't chillin, business dealin'
Look down on you. My floor is your ceiling
Solo, Unity. At your girlfriend crib tryin move the D
And the car got a super V
If a leaf fall on it, I'll shoot the tree (Yeah)
First name Hakeem, middle name money
Signature look clean
Mixtape scene, yall know I'm king
I'll put you on the screen like Sway and Shaheem
Rabbit, Rabbit, Gotta get cabbage
Mixtape savage, I rip through tablets
Crib so lavish, don't know magic
Shades just open like Go, Go Gadget
Like your readin my mind
Ya'll ain't keepin up with me and my rhyme
Make you exit like your readin a sign
I'm the hardest rapper LA Reid didn't sign
Got the balls to prove it
Venom album comin, get your exclusive
Don't try to act like your excluded
Cause your neck fit right on my nooses (Ha Ha)

Let me light it up, Let me light it up
I'm the best rapper, I swear
Let me make this clear...

He can rap and out sing ya (Uh)
I'm the one that out think ya
Damn, He just dropped a new single
I'll have the industry shook with one finger
50 got rich and he didn't even die
Jay getting rich, he ain't needin to reply
R. Kelly on the ground, he believin he can fly
I'm runnin through the drought like it isn't even dry
Amigo, me gotta get the peso
I get mo' like Shawty Lo, they know
I don't waive at a hater, call Magno
Money go "Ha Ha", Play-Doh (play dough)
Yeah, got mixtape bars
I'm the ruler of the mixtape art
Put 'em on sale like it's K-Mart
All bow down to the Mixtape God[Hook: Trick Daddy]
Sittin high, still ridin dem big whips
Still fly, still grindin, getting big checks
Still thuggin, still leanin to the baaack, you can bet that
You can bet that I ride I shine, nigga you can bet that
I smoke, I drank boy you can bet that
22's, 24's all we roll... I'm a dunk rider fa' sho

[Verse 1]
Everyday me and my dog we wylin
7-Tre 7-5 dope ridin'
And we ain't trippin' on nothin', just vibin'
Big 9 with me 'cuz a fuck nigga tried me
They already know, how I let him go
Kill his ass and make sho' at his funeral
How the hell a O.B. gon' try me?
I'm O.G. on and off TV, see
Middle fingers in the air, tell 'em fuck yall
Tryin to hate on my dawgs, hell fuck nah
Why you hatin on a nigga like that
Why you tryin' to stab a nigga in his back
I know some niggas don't like this
But them niggas is the reason I'm like this
Fuck niggas done made me mad
I'm 'bout to snap 'n' put this K on his ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Hey
I pull up Bentleys, lookin like they not annoyed
Trunk popped up lookin like a Tonka Toy
If you dont like it you know can get that Almond Joy (What?)
Deez nuts nigga, wuddup Trick, I got ya boy
I'm clickin' over, lemme tell her I got another call
Ridin' wit my trunk popped up like I'm "Above The Law"
Tires wet and nigga they still drippin' Armor-All
Tell me you gon' fall, and I ain't got to use the arm at all
Bet Daddy finna Trick 'em, finna flip the paper
Chamillinator, me and Trick we finna shred a hater
Tip the dinner waiter Trick 'em like we finna date her
Get off ya sleeves let 'em breathe like a ventilator
Hey, what can I say me and the King Of M.I.A
Finna, (Hey) finna touch ya niggas and ya finna pay
Stay wit it hey you we ain't finna play
Snatch ya off the wheels and you can watch ya rims spin away

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy & (Goldru$h) - {both}]
(In the club wit my dogs we wylin'
Two straight coup grey dome ridin)
Look at cha boy go so many hoes
Look in his mouf he got so many gold
(Im sippin and I'm goin'
Whole click, that's how we rollin')
Stay fly, stay right if ya didn't know
(And that's everywhere that we go)
All I wanna do is
Drive my Chevy through years
And let 'em sweat the candy paint
Ain't it right?, ain't it tight?, ain't it nice?, yes
Niggas like, "Who painted that?"
Candy apple green, lookin mean anywhere
Tweety seat with the digital dash
And a swat just right in the ass
{They wanna know what I got in here
I got shit when it hit betta run 'em up outta here}
They ain't neva heard nuthin like that
And they ain't even turned the bass up yet
{I love aggressive music
I smoke, I listen to it}
I drank so much, sometimes I think I need to quit but I can't do it

[Hook]
