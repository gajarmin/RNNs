[Intro]
My Spider senses is tingling
Feel something, got my radars up

[Verse 1]
Something going on, I feel funny can't tell me nuttin' different
My nose twitching
Intuition setting in like Steve vision
I still close my eyes, I still see visions
Still hear that voice in the back of my mind
So what I do, I still take heed, I still listen
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism
My words still skipping through air
I know you can't, don't, won't get it
You niggas chose to ride that ship, sunk with it
I'm still afloat, I ain't the captain of the yacht but I'm on the boat
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't
You niggas acting like you will but I know you won't
I read between the lines of your eyes to your brows
Your handshake ain't matching your smile
Ah-ah, you niggas foul

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air

[Verse 2]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at hammers
Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me, two techs, extra clips on me
I know my mind ain't playing tricks on me
I ain't skitz homey
Ain't no body drop a nick on me
It's like they tryna plot a set on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like mack tighten up your circle before they hurt you
Read they body language
Eighty five percent communication non-verbal
Eighty five percent swear they know you
Ten percent you know they story, man the other five
Time'll show you, just know you
Then pull they strings, you the puppet master
Fuck them other bastards
Man watch who you puffing after
Play your cards, go against all odds
Shoot for the moon, if you miss
You still amongst those stars

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Can you feel it, can you feel it floating
Without picture quoting, scriptures from Revelation
Talk shit and got the devil waiting
Body get stiff, so levitate
Why do I speak blasphemy
Knowing one day that he'll ask for me
Ask for my sins, no one'll feel his wrath for me
I go through it, so you wouldn't do it after me
As for me, I'm still circling the block before I'm parking
Not bitching, I'm just still cautious
Same black parka, same uzi, extra clips, still clapping with that same larking
Damn I feel it in the air you not sincere
Nigga it ain't an us or we or I'mma thing
It's a good/bad karma thing
This a song man of honor sing
I swear I feel something honestly

[Hook][Jay-Z]
Uh huh yea, yeah
Duro!
You gotta let it bump
Uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
Come on bring the chorus in

[Hook]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

[Jay-Z Talking about his best friend]
I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from another pop, minus one shot
We Neno and G-Money man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Ty
My nigga High, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that’s right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
That's how we run, when you ain’t around
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line
If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga

[Hook] x2

[Jay-z Talking about his mother]
I know mama, your little baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom for your wisdom for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
"Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them"
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was weezing
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine

[Hook] x2

Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
The world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it’s code red if you're wrong my nigga
You’re my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga

[Hook] x4[Jay-Z]
To all my street niggas, project niggas
Real niggas, worldwide
Let's reflect, everybody got a story
We all ghetto B. Here's mine

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
See I was born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit
I kept arms 38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs - arms through it, or stuffed with embalming fluid
Shit, I'm going through it - mom dukes too
Tears streaming down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is gettin too wild
I need to bring some sort calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming "Don't do it!"
It's like '93, '94, bout the year
That Big and Mack dropped and "Illmatic" rocked
Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doing them, I'm still stretching on the block
Like "Damn, I'mma be a failure"
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug paraphenalia
Cops, courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Trying to figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you selling
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon

[Hook: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Chill dog
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinking damn; how my older sister goin' make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'mma keep it real
I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggas thinking what y'all reading in The Source is real
What my life like, you lookin at the source, it's real
What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real
Passing judgment, you niggas second-guessing Beans
Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Mu'min
Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an
I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine
Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
Make 'em feel hell on earth before Allah drop me
I feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me
Till them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make Mac not act like Beans
Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin
My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave dog
Shit I know that I'mma see 'em when I leave dog
I come back in the afterlife
Like fuck it I done touched hell twice; what's the meanin?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Now as I walk into the studio, to do this with Jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, countin our blessings cause Brad's two
Prayin for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
Lovin your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurtin for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losin life; but you can view it like this
God's got open hands homey, he in the midst.. of good company
Who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be wit your son
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong
I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love
It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us
This can't be life

[Hook][Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yes sir! Just the sound of his voice is a hit, heh heh
Y'all niggas got me really confused out there
I make "Big Pimpin'" or "Give it to Me" one of those
Y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought provokin shit y'all question whether he fallin off
I'mma really confuse y'all on this one... follow!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
When them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
"That's him!" I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount
Cause I been doin' this since CHiPS was out
Watchin Erik Estrada, baggin up at the Ramada
Table full of powder, A.C. broke
'Bout to take another shower on my twenty-fifth hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or the fight
You might see me anywhere, day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night

[Hook: Jay-Z]
I'm so bossy, bitch get off me
Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6's on Sprees
Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me
This is that ignorant shit you like
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus ice", c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you love
Nigga fuck shit maricon puta and drugs, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you need
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus weed, c'mon
I'm only tryin to give you what you want
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like it don't front!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
They're all actors
Lookin at themselves in the mirror backwards
Can't even face themselves, don't fear no rappers
They're all weirdos, DeNiros in practice
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures;
It's mostly backwards
Unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song you happen to see
Then, actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R
See y'all in Hell, shoot niggas straight through the E.R
Whoa! This ain't B.R., no
This S.C. CEO, the next Lyor, no
The next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'mma do is free Sigel, go

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Take off the cuffs, unlock the gate
It's that ignorant nigga that you love to hate
The oh-seven Ice Cube, B. Sieg' so rude
Tell a trick get these nuts, eat dick like food
Now see if I care if this verse get aired
Even if you mute it, the curse is there, yeah
I'm so raunchy, bitch get off me
Keep my flea collar on, you lil' ticks get off me

[Jay-Z]
I missed the part when it stopped bein 'bout Imus
What do my lyrics got to do with this shit!
"Scarface" the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Are you saying what I'm spittin'
Is worse than these celebrattantes showing they kitten, you kiddin'!
Let's stop the bullshittin
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin[Intro: Freeway]
Man if I get rocked, this shit for my kids nigga
It's that real shit

*Even though what we do is wrong...*

[Verse 1: Freeway]
We still hustle 'til the sun come up
Crack a 40 when the sun go down
It's a cold winter
Y'all niggas better bundle up
And I bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion
Just to rock it down; you hot now, listen up:
Don't you know cops' sole purpose is to lock us down?
And throw away the key
But without this drug shit your kids ain't got no way to eat, huh
We still try to keep Mom...smilin'
Cuz when the teeth stop showin' and the stomach start growlin'
Then the heat start flowin'
If you from the hood I know you feel me (Jay-Z: Keep goin'...)
If a sneak start leaning and the heat stop workin'
Then my heat start working I'm a rob me a person
Catch a nigga sleeping while he out in the open...and I'm-a get him (Jay-Z: Keep flowin'...)
We gotta raise our kids while we livin'
Make a million off-a record bail my niggas outta prison
Fuck a Bentley or a Lexus just my boys in the squadder
Nigga talk reckless then I hit 'em with the Smif 'n
But I'm never snitching I'm a rider
If my kids hungry snatch the dishes out ya kitchen
I'll be wilding til they pick me outta line-up
We keep the nines tucked, chopped dimes up, rap about it
Wild out, fuck niggas up, laugh about it
I'm not trying to visit the morgue but Freeway move out 'til I sit with the Lord
'Til I...get my shit together, clean up my sins
Freeway got it in like 10 in the morning
And I can get it to ya like 10 while you yawning mang
Still deliver the order mang!
And I ain't talking bout chicken and gravy mang!
I'm talking bout bricks 'o ye-yo, halves and quarters
4 and a halves of hash you do the math
Swing past us scoop up your daughter
She wanna roll with a thug that rap, you do the math
He gone blast 'til my stacks in order mang!

[Jay-Z]
...MANG! Lemme get 'em Free
Hov never slackin mang, zippin in the black Range
Faster than the red ghost, gettin' ghost wit' Pac-Man
One-time know I got a knack to get that change
Leader of the black gang, R-O-C mang
Bang like T-Mac, ski mask air it out
Gotta kill witnesses cause Free's beard's sticking out
Y'all don't want no witness shit, we squeeze hammers mang
Bullets breeze by you, like Lousiana mang
But I gotta feed Tianna mang
So I move keys you can call me the Piano Man
Rain...sleet, hail...snow man
Slang dope, E, hydro man

[Beanie Sigel]
You know B. Sige in the third lane
Gramps still praying, working on my nerves man
Like, "Son you gotta get your soul clean
Before they blow them horns like Coltrane"
But still I cry tears of a hustler
Wipe tears from my mother, pull out beers for her brothers
That's above us, make beds for the babies
Tuck kids under covers, buy cribs for their mothers
Shit I'll probably be wilding with their fathers
Tell Ms. Robert, tell Anajmah that I'm riding for her father
That's like my brother, like same mother different father
Any problems dog know I got 'em
And still we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom, sold crack in the alleyways
Still gave back Marcy on Dollar Day
Real gangstas make hood holidays
They ain't thank us but we still paid homage mang
Soul Food Sunday looking like Big Momma's mang
Tell the gang I never break my promise mang...mang...unnh![Intro: Beanie Sigel]
Damn how am I gonna say this shit?
Hey - hey dad, yeah it's your boy
Remember me? I wanna talk to you scrap

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
I remember being kicked out the house
Cause I looked just like you
Said I'd be nothing but a crook
Just like you
The niggas in the hood was shook
Where the just like you
Cause all they said was little whitey look
I'm just like you
But dog I can't see it at all, shit
We never kicked it at all
We never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dog, you never taught me shit
How to fight, ride a bike, fix a flat
None of that sorts of shit
Nigga you was an abusive pops
Fuck you left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta teach News to box
Gotta teach News to bop
And that ain't the half of it man
I gotta teach News to block
It's about time we have a father to son (nigga sit down)
Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons
How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughters
Nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
I never follow your orders
Nigga you make me sick
Pussy you could....ooh
How you gonna leave these memories in the back of my mind
I can see it clear as day you smackin my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young
And said that would be mine, you turned me out
The reason why I hit the block
Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hitting shots
Reason why I started getting licked
And drinking syrup and skipping court
Gingerbread Man never think of getting caught
Look at your hand man damn you fought
Nigga you left my mom
Left us with no good-bye's
You left us out to dry
You left us with no letters, notes, (nothing!) no replies
No digits numbers was unlisted
You left us with some of my loneliest night
Nigga some of my hungriest nights
Shit, one of the reasons for years (shit embarrasin)
Damn we used to think money was white
Yeah you gave us life like, fruit from a plant
We ain't eat right from them foods from them stamps
And to think you was my pop
Man I gotta stop shit

[Hook]
[Female:]Daddy, Where Have You Been?
[Beanie:] And when you come home, you got us here all alone
[Female:] Mommy, Where Daddy Went?
[Beanie:] You always stick up for him
Always said you'd make up for him
[Female:] Mommy, What Happened Then?
[Beanie:] What was you cheatin on him?
Why he's always beatin' on you?
[Female:] Daddy, Where Have You Been?
[Beanie:] Nigga, you gonna hear me out

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I wanted to walk just like him (remember?)
Wanted to talk just like him (word)
Often momma said I look too much
And I thought just like him (and I'd get happy)
Wanted to drink Miller nips
And smoke Newports just like you
But you left me, now I'm goin to court just like you
I would say "my daddy loves me and he'll never go away"
Bullshit, do you even remember December's my birthday?
Do you even remember the tender boy
You turned into a cold young man
With one goal and one plan
Get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one
Always short with the income
Always late with the rent
You said that you was comin through
I would stay in the hallway (waitin)
Always playin the bench (waitin)
And that day came and went
Fuck You! very much you showed me the worst kind of pain
But I'm stronger and trust me I will never hurt again
Will never ask mommy "Why daddy don't love me?
Why is we so poor?, why is life so ugly?
Mommy why is your eyes puffy?"
Please don't cry everything'll be alright
I know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light
It's us against the world
We don't need him, right? (right)
Mommy drivin 6's now (yeah), I got riches now (yeah)
I bought I nice home for both of my sisters now
We doin real good
We don't miss you now
See how life twists around, fucker?[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I’ma chase my dream
Coming to America like Prince Akeem
I ain't never give a fuck but then I seen
High definition to get whats forever given
But nothing was never given
I build it from ground up
I started out with my basement and builded my house up
I’m rich off opportunity, money gon’ pile up
My swag on a hundred mill, how the stylist gon' style us
Caught up in the light, caught up in the life
I see youngin on the corner with a quarter of that white
He just tryna chase his dream plus his daughter needs some wipes
And some pampers so he don’t give a fuck about the slammer
He just tryna stay alive, clutching on his hammer
World full of problems, ain't nobody gotta answer
Mommy in the grave, daddy gettin’ high
Bills steady rollin’ in, he barely gettin’ by
Same clothes everyday, he barely gettin’ fly
Erryday he wake, he just swear to do his job
What that is? Chasin’ dreams, time is tickin’ so it seems
On his downtime he’s spittin’ and he’s sick, his flow is mean
He just want his real chance, no reality show
But the graveyard the jail cell, reality though
Crack house was his crib, the streets fathered him though
And he ain't got no twitter page but you can follow him tho
Woah

[Hook]
Dream chaser, keep chasin’
Grind will turn into your shine, be patient
Yeah, a hundred miles and runnin’
Tryna catch up to my dreams so you know I’m Forrest Gumpin’
I’ma dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
I was raised by my momma
Pop used to beat her
Got a sister my age, my pop was a cheater
Gram’s kept something in the pot for us to eat up
Had to open up the oven for the house to heat up
Christmas missed us, no birthday’s or Easter’s
Used to snatch bags from Halloween trick or treaters
Hot dogs and beans, fish sticks on the weekend
Shared the same bed that my cousin used to pee in
Dreamed to be the Huxtable’s, settled for the Brady’s
Black and white on top of floor model wit’ no cable
My sister used to punch me, beat me, slap me
Caught my first case stealin’ cookies outta ACME
Raised in South Phil, 2-4 where you can find me at
Used to kick the machines for quarters out the laundromat
Dirty little teen, going to school embarrassin’
Gas cut off, my clothes smelling like kerosene

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
It all started in the basement, me, my pen and my pad
Started thinkin’ bout things I never had
Was broke as a joke, ain't never laugh
I woke up and went and got it, now they forever mad
How can you hate me where I came from
When just a year ago I was the same one
Them dudes you call your homies be the main one
You’d be surprised what niggas do as soon as the fame come
But I ain't worried, discouraged, I just observe it
When my dreams started to crumble, niggas deserted
Empty courtroom when my judge read my verdict
But now I’m gettin’ to it, niggas act like they deserve it
Sittin’ in my cell, watching my dream
Fade like Mike, fourth quarter, tie game
Shackles on my ankles and wrist my first chains
And now it’s hard work on the menu, I thirst cream

[Hook][Beanie Sigel]
1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
What's the problem shorty?

[Shorty]
Yeah whattup man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me

[Beanie Sigel]
Alright; hold on - Hova, line one

[Jay-Z]
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggas don't know a brick from a bite
They keep buying hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life"
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

[Shorty]
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'mma roll with that one

[Jay-Z]
Make out a check for eight hundred dollars

[Beans] Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on
Bleek, line two

[Memphis Bleek]
Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, that's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggas who gettin it - DEAD IT
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out
{*click*, *dial tone*}

[Beans] 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your dog

[Beans] Free, pick up line five

[Freeway]
First things first, watch what you say out your mouth
When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (ho!)
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)
You stoppin dough when we clutching the gas
I know you heard "Friend or Foe," this ain't different from that
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dykes and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Cause boys want three bundles two streaks and pipe for sure
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more
Nine and four, everyday back and forth
Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler
Pass the number til you're stackin balls
Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more

Two E's, that'll be two G's

Ghetto Vision, Roc-A-Fella
Man it's outrageous
And we out[Beanie Sigel]
Ughh, ughh, yeah
This is Beanie Sigel
That Philly cat who ain't with that silly rap
Put your weight up, not your hate up, niggas
Y'all know how I play quiet towns and tie 'em down
Haters wonderin' how I got a position with Roc
Cuz I listen to The LOX and I listen then watch
While you still sittin' in spots, ditchin' the cops
I'm in the Porsche Box with Fox, glistenin' watch
War steel gray, Lexus, GS-4
Desert Eagle metal in the door, pedal to the floor
I'm routin' down South, for my aim is to score
Eight cylinder, screamin' 'Fuck the law!'

Got a tank full of gas, trunk full of cash
Hammers in the stash, scanners in the dash
Radar detectors, troopers can't find us
We bubble down ATL and hit the 'Linas
Then get clubbed with some Dirty South thugs
Go all out thugs, go in your house thugs
Talk shit, put blood in your mouth thugs
36 South stuck, stay on route thugs
You know how Mac play, quiet town, tie it down
I supply it now, by the pound
Might front you a Q if you buy a pound
If you didn't try it then, why would you try it now?
Think cause Mac rap, I wouldn't fire a round into your crown
I lay you down and retire you clown

And I clap niggas, nap niggas in the dirt
Pat-pat with the deuce deuce, it'll work
Bitch ass niggas wearin' thongs and skirts
Catch 'em early in the mornin' while they goin' to work
See you pretty motherfuckers stay stuck in the mirror
And you weak ass niggas only bust out of fear
I know y'all softer than them feathers that they stuff in a bear
I pack two barettas, never bust in the air
Twist your shit back, spit til my gat sits back
Pack four pieces like a Kit Kat. Heh, get that?
Cop Cris' by the six-pack, Range Rov?' Dot six that
Benz Coupe, drop six that
Buggy eye seven come out? Shit, took the six back
Switch the Double R, the Double R's are, gotta get that
You see how we play, pop Cris' on the E-Way
Soakin' the seat, gettin' drunk with Bleek
Or the Shark Bar, grilled salmon, poppin' Dom P
While you chicken when you chasin' your high with hot tea
Niggas flashin' back money like it's they money
Slap 500 on back of a three-twenty
I'm bringin' it to any nigga tryin' to shoot games (yeah)
With them bullshit buggy-eyed kits and CDs

[Memphis Bleek]
Check it out, yo, yo
Well, I'm a lil' nigga don't speak, I tote heat
Here to shut down your whole operation on the street
Bleek, you know niggas just had to recruit this
My flow drool out like a old nigga toothless
Who would believe they pump Bleek with Ritalin
Too hyped up, but weed calm my adrenaline
Roll day on the strip, SK in the crib
Hundred crack viles, playin' the Benj'
Nickel nine gleam, like it's Armor All'd up
My squad be armed up, gotcha niggas' arms up
Who the fuck want what? Me and Bean's trumped up
Witcha town under siege, Dillinger in the sleeve
If my gun jam, you niggas'll squeeze on me
You niggas them cats, that'll call D's on me
I'm on on my off game, need a stadium for in stores
Floss chains and I pimp whores, stay smoked out
Shirt be poked out with the snub-nosed eight
Six to jump out, you eat what you spit
Motherfucker die clean
For you actin' tough cats, but in your heart you serene
I read your body languo
You off balance and don't wanna mangle
You want a challenge, get it brought to from every angle
This shit'll slow 'em down, I bet that
Your up front dough and your six, bet that motherfucker

[Foxy Brown]
Sassy Fox some brick money, cop me a drop
You know how I run it, 600, glassy top
Rock the light gray wrist shit, flash them rocks
The red, the yellow, the green, causin' traffic stops
Bitch please, never freeze, gonna blast the Glock
Then I show a little cleave' and breeze past the cops
You talk slick but suck dick for money in y'all hand
I'm like, "Bitch, I got more money than your man"
While you get your knees scraped up, cum all on your glands
Shit, I'm in the V Twinz ballin' on you tramps
Y'all hoes greasy, so I keep the bitch easy
Rookie, fuck you know about Glocks and pock' books?
You know Na Na rock that shit, Pra-da that shit

Hollow points, top that shit, fuck you tryin' to aim
Pop that shit, yeah, nigga, Fox got that shit
You see the ice wrist shit, can you cop that shit

You know my style, I be spendin' they cash
And I'll show their little dick some celebrity ass
And get 'em a brick, I know what style to get them niggas shit real
Well, fuck, I let 'em live and lick the tip of my shit
To remind 'em of some rose petals, candles, and shit
Or some hydro like the nigga grew a plant in my shit
So that's what it is, that's why them hoes mad at my shit
See my whilin' in the four-six, stylin' on they bum ass
Goddess MC, y'all bitches is little Foxes
I see my girls frontin', tossin' they little watches

Cats? I fouls on. Hoes? I styles on, nigga
Wear y'all out then air y'all out
Over here? Hustle from where, clear all out
Shit, greyhound bitch, stay down bitch
And y'all know Jigga sent me here to lay down shit
I will spray y'all niggas, will waste y'all niggas
Cause I fucked the nigga and paid y'all niggas
Shit, what the fuck[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
Ayo, this time it's for my family, we ride or die
It's in the blood til the death, now aim for the sky
My four blow fo sure, for dough, for only
It's money, drugs, and hot slugs
You know Bleek squeeze hammers til they nail me
Fuck wha niggas tell me
Street scholar, keep firing is what they tell me
Drug chemist, thug nigga be named Memphis
Straight from da borough of dem B.K. niggas
Where we rob for the fun of it, hustle for the drug of it
Wrap money in rubber bands, just for the love of it
Straight from my ghetto, we listen to heavy metal like
Desert Eagles, street sweepers, loud metal
It's hit and run now, motherfuck anyone of you
We dem niggas be in ya crib just like furniture
Pop up wit the gun in ya
Release one for zero-zero M (Yeah)
Bleek-R-O-C (Yeah yeah) dot com (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
This Philly cat back at it
Still throwing crack at it
Still fucking wit them crack addicts
Still bust 'em wit them black 'matics
It's ain't the bucks, it's the rush
You trying to get my ass at it
They say I think ass backwards
Fuck how I act, as long as I stack, it's all mathematics
Our tracks nice, hug the block to track dice
Late night, club night, Mac attract dikes
I pull up, Cadillac truck nice
Two guns, you know Mac pack gat twice
Gets that crack back with that ice
No joke wit the coke, I whips that right
No doubt, never a droubt, gets that price (Uh)
It gets that nice, when you live that life
Papi knows yours name and you ditched that wife nigga
Gets that green nigga, gets that chain nigga

[Amil]
I get forty G's a feature now
Hold Franklins like a Aretha now
In the SL two seater now
And I'm in nothing but diamonds
I'm the illest female that you heard thus far
Five-five with the thirty-four B-cup bra
I don't fuck with them cats who ain't up to par
I get niggas for cash, clothes, jeweleries, plus cars
I'm talking rent money, I'm talking bank money
I'm talking Martha Keats step of wit the rent money
Moving on up, two in the sauna
Still ride through the block, pull up on the corner, plus
Plus, give me an inch so I can take a mile
I bring life like a new born naked child
Bitches trying to come up, gotta wait a while
As of now, Amil-lion just played ya style
(You dealing wit), nigga

[Jay-Z]
The, the Roc, the the, the Roc
(Let me talk to ya'll niggas real quick)
The, the Roc, uh uh, the Roc

Yo, y'all niggas truly ain't ready for this "Dynasty" thing
Y'all thinking Blake Carrington, I'm thinkin more like Ming
I got four nephews, and they all writing
They all young and wild, plus they all like things
And I'm having a child, which is more frighting
What y'all about to witness is big business kid
Big bosses, cocky, and big Benzsesses
Come through flossing them shiny rims it is
And "loss" don't pop up in their sentences
I think you understand what type of event this is
I don't think you know how focused young Memphis is
Or how Sigel's so real, when you add on Amil
This is much more than rap, it's black entrepreneur
Clothing, movie, and films, we come to conquer it all
Rocawear, eighty mill in like, eighteen months
You could bullshit with rap if you want, motherfuckers
When it's all said and done, we gon see what's what
Holla at Hov, I'll be in the cut (What, huh)

The, the Roc, the the, the Roc
The, the Roc, the uh, the Roc (You rollin wit)
The Roc, dynasty niggas (Whoop)
Uh-huh, get'cha mind right, c'mon
Roc-A-Fella Records, 2000 nigga
Get'cha mind right, holla[Scratch intro]

Chorus [Black Thought and Scratch] 2x
Once again 'gain
Once again 'gain
Once again 'gain 'gain ladies and gentlemen
Once again 'gain
Once again 'gain
Once again 'gain 'gain
Yo, Adrenaline

[Black Thought]
Yo I'm in the eye of the storm, where the pressure's on
And MC's is dressed funny like a leprechuan
I chop rappers up like chicken szechuan
Sells a squads off like a slave auction
Aiyyo my zodiac sign read caution
On stage, I make your seed to an or-phan
Yo, my age an algebraic equation
Niggas want some? I hit em wit a portion
Son, The Fifth foursome, armed at the door son
M-illi-tilla, Dice Raw, quick draw son
You don't want no more son? That's when more come
And drag a nigga Erie Avenue to Oregon, you're all done
Ladies and gentlemen
Select the weapon at the gate upon entering, The Roots instrumentaling
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit
We hit em like the L at 60th and Market
South Philly clip a hole into a nigga pocket
Take sneaks, chains and rings and bracelets
Split back this like we the therapist
Adrenaline, Fifth mic terrorist, once again

Chorus

[Malik B]
Zigga zigga zigga tryin to get a grip but still slip, so lift me up
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt
You get to know me, you poke me slowly, when caught puzzin
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't
Punked em wit a dozen of pellets all in they skelet
Transform, from the norm, start to brainstorm
Yeah Malik B from The Roots, he ain't gone
I took the wrong exit, the sign said Langhorne
I'm trapped up in about five worlds with live pearls
Shouts to Armour Akquan whose name is Jalil
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand it
Demanding, takin you back like Knotts Landing
I'm Ralph Kramden, we out, you'll see in Hampton
Yo what the what the what the, what the what the what the
Pivot on this concrete earth until I rot
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet but still I plot, once again

Chorus

[Dice Raw]
Beans passed the Mac and we held em, like hostages
Rappers see me, hide they face like ostriches
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages
Underwater rap, you know who the bosses is
North Philly baby, that's where that Raw shit is
You'll get blown out the sky once shit get talkative
A-D devise rise, I fathered it
So when you see me on the street, don't bother kid
Just be on your merry way, or you might get slit
Ask around, wondering what Dice Raw did
Lay you on floors like ya getting carpeted
You need a special kind of mic for retarded kids
Me against you's like Kane verse the Partridges
You wanna battle, change your name to The Forfeiters
Cuz that's what you do, face to face wit raw niggas
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters, once again

Chorus

[Beanie Sigel]
They used to talk shit, but I'ma quiet them
Kick in the door wit my boys stick to rioting
First nigga that flinch, I'mma fire em
Tape em up, grip his hands, and plier em
Know the bricks is in here, where you hiding em?
Don't die in the shit that you lying in
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buying em
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplying him
Paid the front row seat watching Iverson
First class air crafts what I'm flying in
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them
Used to shotgun in cars, now I'm driving em
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbing them
Ran up in y'all spot wit Rob and them
Grew up, two-four, wit Pie and em
But do my dirt, 21st, wit Kyle and them
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them
Brother news, nigga schooled Marley Park and them
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparking em
I know shit right now getting dark to them
Tore they body all up, ain't no chalking em
Too sharp for them, move out in the dark on em
These Illadel foul streets what I'm stomping in once again

Chorus

[Scratch outro][Jay-Z]
Uh huh yea, yeah
Duro!
You gotta let it bump
Uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
Come on bring the chorus in

[Hook]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

[Jay-Z Talking about his best friend]
I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from another pop, minus one shot
We Neno and G-Money man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Ty
My nigga High, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that’s right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
That's how we run, when you ain’t around
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line
If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga

[Hook] x2

[Jay-z Talking about his mother]
I know mama, your little baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom for your wisdom for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
"Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them"
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was weezing
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine

[Hook] x2

Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
The world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it’s code red if you're wrong my nigga
You’re my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga

It's the rap guerilla that still clap...fucker
Yeah, guess who's back?

[Verse 1]
Mack, bitch - I move blocks and pounds
I move out with small blocks and towns
Move out with small Glocks and pounds (uh-huh)
And I take everything to the table, bag and rock it down
Fuck who watching now; the neighbors, they in pocket now
Fuck you haters -- cop some pocket now
When it come to coke, you can't outwit me; mine cheap
'Bout to take over the city of Philly like John Street
Nigga, ask all y'all fiends, they call me Chef Boy-ar-Beans
Beanie Crocker, cook coke proper
Right amount of flour sifting it up
Coke spots running by the hour, shifting it up
Graveyard shifts, move packs in bundles
Braveheart kids, use gats don't rumble
Gorilla niggas going apes in this concrete jungle
Banana clips'll make them monkeys humble

[Hook]
BEANIE! Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIE! Yeah, but guess who back

[Verse 2]
It's Mack, bitch - uh-huh, back in the mix of the scuffle
I'm in the hood with them chips like Ruffles
Box man, Frito Lay, for that free dough boxing
You will lay, nigga I'm not playing
Listen, whether I make cash or take cash
I'm in the hood eating with my dog like when we break fast
B's on the hood and the wheel and the brake pad
Shit, when I skate past, bitches shake ass
I sit four-thirty deep in wheels
You 'bout four-thirty cheap in wheels - small Benz
Look at your small rims, small wheel, small grill
Big Beans, sitting in Bentley my heart peels
Zero to sixty so quickly -- how you want it? You can have it
Drop top, stick shift, automatic
Back wheels still smoking
6-4 still rolling, 3 wheel motion, it's ferocious

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
On the low though (shh!), the whole city is mine
I'm trying to flood the whole city with dimes
I'm in the kitchen yeah, with that vision wear
Get them digits clear you can come and get them pigeons here
Niggas talk about the crack game slowed up, BULLSHIT
You switched your hustle when the rap game showed up (uh-huh)
While you wasting your time spitting them rhymes
I'm getting mine spitting them rhymes, plus still pitching them dimes
And the spot still sick with da grime
Glock 26 nigga but I'm sicker than nine
I'm live with the pound, small silencer calming the sound
Stick with the seven, strictly Smith with the seven (shit)
When I drop back and cock back
And pop that, I'm popping for keeps -
I'm not getting stopped in the streets
Imagine that a nigga trying to rock Mack
Only nigga did it was Jay, and he did it when I signed the contract

[Hook]Beanie Mack
Rocafella y'all
Check

A yo two decades, three years and still in order
I done stabbed sticks, killed bricks drowned drops of water
Ate a million dollars
Shitted four million quarters
Stuck mothers, sisters, aunt, nieces and daughters
Fuck Taco Bell
I run south of the border
Cop a whole pie and you working wit a quarter
Stay cased up like my man Rhyme Slaughter
Sleep in crack spots on off that water
Y'all scrape up for weed money and grub
Me and my man roll in a Benz four dub
On our way to the club
Smoking weed out the jug
While most stay in court trying to plead with the judge
What!
Fist and wrist stay glitered up
Don pee sip it up to I spit it up
I fuck bitches who bust checks to flood my neck
Give me rough sex
Huff wet
Bust teks
Feds eyeing, like I'm imported that shit
I trying to be cased up in court for that shit
I just want to breeze through sported that shit
Laughing at them Point Breeze niggas snorting that shit
Y'all niggas would never finish that y'all be starting
Never could back up that shit y'all be talking
I make you famous
I put your face on milk cartons
Beenie Mack smoother than Jerome on Martin
I keep the silence on the three eighty loughton
Quiets the bus but can't do shit about this sparking
That's why I get my bodies right before darken
Your dogs ain't biting shit, just doing a lot of barking
Your squads leaking
Fronting like y'all eating
Rent a little car get dress on the weekend
That that Joe shit
You don't know me why you speaking?
Cause I shut down blocks and clock like Puerto Ricans
Beenie Mack rap gorilla
I'm out for the scrilla
Face it ain't no replacement for this killer[Intro - DJ Khaled]
Yeah..
I represent loyalty
I am loyalty
I am the definition of loyalty
I represent the G's

We The Best

[Verse 1 - Beanie Sigel]
All the bullshit stops here (Here)
Let's get this clear (Yeah)
Shoot rear, fresh off the top tear (Unhh)
What I'mma 'bout to do for you, is not fair
I'm not answerin' questions for you, dat are not clear
Whuddup with State Prop. the crew, when they not there?
The moment dat they heard it the verdict, when it wasn't clear
Ya boi had the to sit a year, did they really disappear?
Jay really not visit there? Dame and Beans are they tight as it seems
Or is it all fabricated from dat same fabric
Now rip the rock marriage straight from seams
Thing's ain't what it seems but at time do tell, the truth shall prevail
Until then, you dudes bite yall nails in anticipation (Fuck)
I know you hate it why I got chu waitin? (Shiiit..) - I too, am waitin'
Gotta see a couple faces, when I make 'em face it
Truth dat is dat ya boy have patience (Yes!)
As a matter a fact, it's wearin' thin
But I tell you this tho, when the New Year begins
Pussies who got nuts cause I'm goin' all in

[Hook - Pooh Bear]
Can you hear me (Ayyy), came for attention (Ayyy)
But it ain't good if you don't wait (Ooooh)
It ain't good if you don't wait (Ooooh)
I'm the plot in every movie but my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you dont wait (Ooooh)
It ain't good if you dont wait (Ooooh)
Nah-uhhh..

[Verse 2 - Beanie Sigel]
Now let's not get this misconstrued
To say dat diss record - I don't diss my dudes!
Outta respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew
Never in front of you I couldn't get dat rude
Ionn give a fuck but I couldn't get dat crew
Cause knowin what I do I can get like (Khh) ouu
You wanna know what I do, don't cha?
You'd love it if I told you lil' fuckers, won't cha?
Uh-unh, scrap gotta pay for this one
Sorry youngin', got to wait on this one (Yes)
The Solution, soon in stores
Date to be posted, until then - I'm on pause

[DJ Khaled talkin']
Yeah, to DJ khaled aka We The Best
Beanie Sigel (Whudd!.. Ain't no more too it)
Give em more man, more

[Verse 3 - Beanie Sigel]
Well fuck it I don't wanna stop
Whatchu forgot the gun'll pop
Tell me who ya wanna rock
This true love, Roc-a-Fella 'till I die
Nigga keep it movin', don't get caught up in this drive-by
The break's over, ya boi 'bout to take over
If dat number one spot opens, give it here (Here)
Get my crown, dust of my chair
And yall niggas can kiss my ass before I sitted there
Back from the dead (Unhh) fresh off the prison tier
Daddy here to put the kids to bed (Get it clear!)
By the way, the wars on - you can't call it off
It's too late once the boss involved
Here I come!!

[Hook]

[Outro - DJ Khaled]
In life--There's real niggas... And there's fuck niggas...

Beanie, Mac!! I see ya, I'mma salute cha[Omillio Sparks]
Philly shit.....
Yall niggas stop snitching out there we see you
How you get indited and come straight home? answer that

[Sparks]
Wrap up in your quilts and tripple goose, its gon be a cold winter
The streets got me feeling trapped like my wrist be in handcuffs
Omillio Sparks you niggas I distance myself from snitches
Cause them madicons I'll have you feeling like you driving on cobblestones
On the road to the riches, but I try to run a smooth operation but lately
I find myself carrying burners with me
Cause niggas that I knew since a child wanna kill me now - no problem
I know how to handle that, I send em shots from the mac
Try to understand I come to far to fall back
SHIT! Not even a year ago I was there crack
Slinging crack on the back of dirty blocks
With yall getting my scrape on til the cops rolled up
That's was home and I stay dedicated
But I saw no numbers
I guess thats whats yall gon call taking a fall but I'm a man
So I set aside the set backs tryed to bounce back got a this rap
Covered it all from the movies, the videos to fucking these groupies
Even long money, now these niggas wanna test me
But I don't give a fuck, I'm feeling like William H.Bonnie  tonight
Who wanna make the papers I could make ya famous
Go for your guns, start the ignition how many of yall gon ride to night
NOT TO MANY NIGGAS! Cause half yall fake niggas turn out to be snitch niggas

[Beanie]
Bitch niggas, snitch niggas, bitch niggas, pussy motherfuckers
[Sparks]
Its time for you snitch niggas to be exposed
Don't let me find out theres a bitch under them clothes
[Beanie]
Real thugs stand up straight never fold
And they don't shit if anything ever blows

[Beanie]
You muthafucking right Mac keep them weapons drawn
For you niggas that rap and keep them dresses on its getting out of hand
Niggas taking the stand picking out they man
Lifting they right hand to snitch on they right hand
Whats behind that shit you both push bricks
But you gon make a statement and sign that shit
After that anything goes, your kids thats a brick in they nose
Ill steal your gat and live by the cold
Ill rather die than be labeled a snitch, snake rat or a bitch
I hate a theif but I know I'm a prick
You fucking lames in the game like its sweet
Never came from the streets
Type to get locked and change ur name to Shareef
Its fucked up when your team got a bitch on it
Bench warmers, you got bench warrants
Detective got a tech with two prints on it
But you the only one that get arrested and pinched for it
Get knocked ill have you touched every way
Extorted every other week fucked every other day
Niggas with the will, to run in your hut, run in your but
Six foot niggas tongueing you up
You niggas gossip like soap operas
But them niggas upstate use the mop sticks so proper
You niggas is bitch I know you got in yall
Cause the dog allows me to spot it in yall

Chorus x 5

[Beanie] Snitch ass bitch ass muthafuckas
[Sparks] Get down or lay down
[Beanie] Get down or fucking lay down
Yall know the fucking rules lay down you stay down
[Sparks] Ride Muthafuckas Ride
[Beanie] I know my nigga Touche know whats its like to be snitched on[Sample]

Darling
Ya know, you give a man a reason for living
Not to mention, you take my paycheck
Now baby, but I give it to you because I love you
Ya know cuz the things that I feel so proud about
The things that you do
Ya know, like runnin' my car into telephone poles
Plus (?) I didn't get mad did I?
Y-Y-y'member, 'member when
W-W-When I tried to take my clothes to the cleaners
And on the way out
My very best pinstripe caught a nail
I didn't get mad
I was proud because you thought, enough of your man
To be in such a hurry
It made me feel grand, yes it did
Uuh I need you, I just need you

[Verse 1]
Uh
You know I was your bread, your butter
And I ain't talkin bout that bread I fucked up on you
Cause in my head man I swore I lucked up
Wasn't countin all the butter I spreaded on you
So true now, why would I play you bitch I made you
I'm not talkin bout the things that I gave you
Clothes wit the labels, I brought you round Hov and the label
Spring water while holdin you're age koo
Naw I ain't tryin to degrade you
But you was a lost little girl n you're world boo I saved you
Ya pop owe me a favor, I basically raised you
From squada to Bentley-whippin
Ain't have to watch Cribs to see how I was livin
Me, so blinded ain't see the Robin Givens in you
Huh, shoulda seen the Ginger in you
Tried to off Beans like Rothstein? Go figure
Youu take my dough, spend wit the next nigga you crazy bitch?

(Chorus #1)
And dis was the one I trusted
Who would ever think she would spread like mustard
Bitch I was your bread and butter
You shoulda tucked dat bread and butter
Ya know what?... Dis shit funny to me
It ain't nuttin but money to me
You lookin hungry to me
But I was your bread and butter
Bitch shoulda tucked dat bread and butter
Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm

[Verse 2]
You got the whole town laughin at me, silly he
Silly to see got me feelin silly like Denise like
Oh what could it be in you, I see
N dis young P-Y-T
She got me L-O-V, E-T-K-O'd
Uh, like Teddy P. whatever she say goes
But I'm, ready to +Turn Off The Lights+
Close the door, on my pretty young mi amor
Now peep game wit 'em, need, I, more
Gimme dat, E thy or
No Beanie Mac don't play dat crap wit these whores
She want me missin her (in my room) like the O'Jays homes
But I'm on to my zone like O.J. Jones
Beano brown, cancel dis bitch, I'll buy another one
It's my world you lil squirrel tryna get a nut bitch
Do you- what bitch? Lil smut bitch
Got you're name ringin, spreadin like mustard
And I'm supposed to trust it after he touched it?

(Chorus #2)
I told dat ass +slow down+ like Puba
Now your days are gray like the 4 pound Ruga
Bread and Butter, see I was you're bread and butter
Heyyy, baby ya hips is getting big
Now you getting thin you don't care about your whip
Cuz I was you're bread and butter
Shoulda tucked that bread and butter
Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm

(Bridge being sung)
So proud, of you.. a'ye-ah
I gotta say it loud, yes I do, a'yeah (yeah yeah)
When you do (do) What you do (do)
How do you know, What you know
Aw, shame on you
I need you (oh oh)
Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm

[Verse 3 - Grand Puba]
Yeah
Now you know I was your bread and butter
You had a shot to be my baby mother
Ain't no sorry I ain't Rueben Studdard
I can't apologize, it's multi-platinum time
Takin all my shit and sendin you back to you're moms cryin
So don't cry baby dry, ya eyes
You tried to get all greasy like you super-size fries
So, pack ya shit
Leave the whip
It's been nice but listen ma I gotta defrost ya ice
Dats rite

(Chorus #2)

(Bread and Butter 4x)

*Mm Mm said repeatedly til fade to end*[Verse 1 - Beanie Sigel]
You can't tell me nothing
Gangster? I don't buy it -- you can't sell me nothing
I'm everything you thought I wasn't
Now check out how I does it on this K. West production
All your bullshit, I will flush it
And I got the paper to wipe that ass
Every little song and dance come out, y'all hype that trash
And yo, I'm far from a hater
Cause suckers gotta eat too -- get y'all paper
I ain't mad at cha -- I just can't deal with these fake rappers
Cause most of these niggas wear they boxers backwards
Niggas claim king but can't govern they household
Now real niggas doing time from shit they mouth told
Why dick-eating niggas always rap with a mouth full?
But you know they don't play with me
The realest nigga alive -- what can these niggas say to me? Nothing

[Hook - Kanye West]
La la la la, wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la, then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
I had a dream that Jay and Dame was back together
And in that second, everything was back the same
In reality, your boy went to Mecca, came back
And said that I would never rap again
But I'm back and that's the way the ball bounce
A verse is a ounce, a album's a brick -- now it's time for traffic game
Y'all lame, I am the product
Hotter than lava, they wonder how this Roc-a-fella package came
First you take a brick of Jay, a brick of 'Ye
Couple quarters of Freeway, an ounce of Beans
Then you kill 'em with the flow
We the realest; even Dontrelle Willis couldn't out the team
We speak the truth and they believe us
Tell FEMA even Hurricane Katrina couldn't out the flames
Roc-a-fella here to stay, we airing out y'all lames
Free At Last on the way, so clear 'em out my lane

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
Yeah homie, this the theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
Three hundred dollar jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Lear jet
Fly as the insect even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number cause
When I get my money right, she gon' come running
And I be good like God with a extra "o"
God knows that my check needs some extra O's
And you know that you need to bring some extra
Not in jogging pants, either -- tell 'em wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional and my chain so fresh, they go
But after the fame, did you gain anything?
Damn, 'Ye, would you change anything?
Well, [Young Jeezy: If I had a billion dollars]
I'd cop more pink Polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname "Sorrow"
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
"Wait 'til I get my money" everybody motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything that I wrote
Yeah -- hey mama, they can't hate 'em
Cause after all of the drama, K slayed 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Uncle Murda]
Listen -- I ain't worried 'bout shit
It's a Roc-a-fella/GMG invasion, bitch
You hear them niggas talking 'bout me? Ain't that some shit
These niggas is like bitches -- they all on my dick
They don't want no real G to get in position
I opened up the door so all my real niggas could get in
Roc-a-fella, Def Jam, GMG it's on
Uncle Murda coming for the motherfucking throne
Listen, you could call me the king of New York
You can't front, I'm doing my thing
If it wasn't for the chronic and these bad-ass ho's
I'd be shooting motherfuckers everywhere I go, oh
But the head I be getting got me chilling
Got a nigga like, let me focus on these millions, man
It got me not thinking 'bout these lames
They don't really want no beef, they ain't life-threatening
I'm puffing purple haze with that sour diesel
Can't forget that kush -- I'm high as a eagle
And just cause I'm high off that marijuana
Don't mean I don't see them niggas creeping around the corner
They goners[Samples from "We Are the Champions" by Queen]
Time after time / I've done my sentence / but committed no crime
I've done my sentence / but committed no crime
I've done my sentence / but committed no crime, crime, crime
And we mean to go on and on and on and on

[Intro: Dame Dash]
Sup y'all? Yo, this is Dame Dash the CEO
Here to welcome y'all to the Dream Team
What y'all niggas thought I was gonna rap? Never
I'm just a little mad at niggas comin at my neck
Like my Team ain't the best in the world... y'knahmsayin?
Like we ain't got Beans, Cam, Jay, Bleek, Freeway

[Hook]
We are the champions, my friend
And we'll keep on fighting, to the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers / cause we are the champions... of the world

[Dame Dash]
Got damn Kanye! I bet niggas didn't know you could rap huh? (They didn't)
That's my motherfucking producer
This the producer on the Roc, he rap better than most rappers!

[Kanye West]
Well Dame, if these niggas thought about they self for a change
Then maybe they can finally figure out how to get they self some change
I done seen jealousy make niggas do t-terrible things
How'd that song go I did with HOV, oh yeah -- shit'll never change
Not to worry, though -- we are the cham-p-ions
Spend a lot of time in Hampt-i-ons, do a lot of beats you can't be on
Damn all these fans can't be wrong, damn B.I.G. you can't be gone
Make those beats thugs want to rock, make a nigga feel just like 'Pac
Make it street but it just might pop, make it straight to the mountain top
Had the Chi' on lock, when they finally heard I signed with Roc
Came in the game, changed it again, changed everything, yeahhhhh
If you feeling this here, throw your fucking hands in the air

[Young Chris]
Its the Roc-a-Fella label baby fuck them other labels baby
And we been ducking shots from all them haters lately
We getting paper baby, them others trying to keep up
We on top, so I guess we they saviors - NOPE!
We labelled as the Roc-A-Fellas, Jacob, watch's colors
Everywhere hell yea, test us and the gauges BLOW!
Fuck they hatin fo'? Don't make me pop a fella
Roc-A-Fella, stop a fella, could get hot for fellas, SIG!!!

[Beanie Sigel]
WHAT?! Don't make me chop a fella, have to call the cop for fellas
Order helicopter fellas... NIG-GA! I'm a Roc-A-Fella
What nigga for Roc-A-Fella shit I will rock a fella
Dame! (God damn Beans I got this let me talk my shit one time)
No we the illest niggas; realest, I will kill these niggas!!

[Dame Dash]
Now that's what the fuck I'm talking bout!
And you wonder why I'm proud of my family?
And you wonder why I ain't gotta rap?
I got niggas that will assassinate you B, lyrically!
Really shut you the fuck down!! Don't get your career ended
Leave us the fuck alone, let us rock!
We are Roc-Heusen, we're the R., O., C. - HOLLA!

[Cam'Ron]
I'm here Dame, I'm here, Killa
This is just fate, how I would sit on a crate
Listen to tapes, every day a frisk was at stake
Jakes' cuffs, wrists getting raped; my mission was straight -- to
Visit them states near them great Michigan lakes
And fuck a bathroom, I pissed on the gate
Flipped the bird at em, flip a bird, switch up my plates
I got plans that was better than jail
Now look -- we like Bird, Parish, Kevin McHale
Scott, Worthy, Jabbar, and Magic
Oh my god it's magic; Isiah, Dumars, I will carve your casket
Phil, Scottie, and Mike; Phil, Shaq, and Kobe
My gats will detach you, homie
And I'm friends with thugs, I sell endless drugs
For the Roc Fam, dog, I extend my love
Jay, Bleek, beef I'll be crossing the bridge
Tossing they wigs, make corpse of they kids
Free, O, Sparks, and Mack Mittens
I'm 95 south, no doubt, mac clip in
I stack chips and I'm Saks Fifth-in
Louis Vuitton loafers, hat dripping
I go retrieve a duck, tell her proceed and suck
I don't just beat my cases, I beat 'em up
My lawyer eat 'em up put bars behind me
I'm glad they didn't stop that car behind me
Shit, it had three felons, gun shooters no
50 cal. A.C.P., Bazooka Joe
Don't be stupid though, I get scrilla man
I'm for'rilla man, yeah it's Killa Cam
Uhhh... DIP SET BITCH!

[Dame Dash]
What y'all thought I was finished?
I'm not! I just recuited somebody new!
I'm like the George Steinbrenner of this shit
I mean I'm rich like him, HOLLA!

[Twista]
Everybody's swarming, oh my god
It's the newest power forward of the squad
A legacy like Jordan with the mob
That be known for breaking motherfuckers hard
Put Roc-A-Fella on my pinky ring
Fuck a battle, nigga -- I'mma get them thangs
Rollin with them Lords and them folks up out the Chi
Twista gone make em spit the game
I represent the mob to the fullest
You don't want it with that boy who's known to pull it
With Kanye on the track of the Dream Team
I'm fin' to be the shit no matter which way you put it
They blessed a nigga in, now I'm fin' to go into a zone
Taking it to some motherfuckers domes
Cause it's on, I will rock until I'm gone
Filling my body with lead, clutching chrome
Take it to your gut, take it to your chest
I be more provoking when I'm smoking sess
And we getting stronger, hope you got a vest
Already got them Macs, already got them Tecs
Served a few dimes, Beans got pearls
Legendary we on top of the world
How could you haters think we can be done
Hold it down because we got champions!![Jay-Z]

Let it be known; Daz Dillinger, rough to the bone
All alone, roam ya neighborhood high (??)
High stylin, profilin, y'all comin after me
In actuality they fake the technicality
Dogg Pound Roc-A-Fella that's my family
On site niggas died for they salary
We the gang and we walk like we talk
And we stalk and we do what we do after dark
Get one shot Dillinger Roc La Familia
{*Now y'all feelin us! Now y'all feelin us!*}

[Hook]
Don't change the game for these hoes
Who plays the game like we supposed

[Jay] Sigel Sigel in the house

[Beanie Sigel]
Uh-huh, sick bastard
Even mo' sicker ya brain get mo' twisted

Sigel, two Desert Eagle hit you niggas up quick
Got 'em diggin ditches up quick
Got you niggas spittin up cause I'm sick
Gettin up slow from hits from the fifth
Let a row go quick from the clip
Shit, sit a nigga down quick when I'm pitchin a bitch
You see light then you takin a trip
Five hours, spill a clip and make the hammer dance
I'll holla, while you holla in the ambulance
STOP ... it's the Roc nigga R-O-C
With the D-O-G on ya block
Fuck the C-O-P's, let me see those trees
No stems, no sticks, no seeds, just breathe

[Memphis Bleek]
Relax bitch, don't act bitch, we don't stop
It's the R-O-C, geah who forgot
You never thought Bleek walk on a track before
Hit a switch in a black 6-4 before
Down on Sunset I run sets, I does that
Niggas look at me and be like damn I was that
I'm "The Understanding" with my peeps, fuck foes
Got a house in the back with a Benz and dough
Get cha mind right nigga 'fore you mention me
Your click ain't too thorough to mention we
Don't matter who we collab' with, nigga it's a classic
Dogg Pound linked with the Roc could cause traffic
Who want rump, get it crunk with me
I'm Bleek, you a got a gun wanna dump with me?
You catch Bleek in B.K. (or) down in L.A
With my W and E up nigga, who want play?

[Kurupt *sung*]
Psycho, like no, bitch-ass nigga so
When you see the R-O-to-the-C sneak creep low

[Jay-Z]
I will not, lose[Beanie Sigel]
You bout to witness somethin like no other
The sky gon' get dark, streets gon' clutter
Weak-ass niggas out there gon' suffer
Vets gon' quit, it's gettin hectic (uhh)
The shit got deep - right about the time
When the year skipped a beat, that's when my shit hit the street
Shit gon' shake up, squads gon' break up
Coats gon' get pulled, niggas gon' wake up
Everybody want see a chance to eat
And chance the streets, you know they gon' 'vance police
Like the time they shackled me from hands to feet
Cause I gave the jail system, a chance to speak
You know the cops wanna trap me up, the block wanna clap me up
It won't stop 'til they wrap me up (E'rything signed and sealed nigga)
Gat be tucked, heat gon' back me up
R.O.C. - Bleek come on nigga, back me up

{*beat changes*}

[Memphis Bleek]
Yeah.. yo..
Aiyyo Memph the young God, boss of this game
Got my part locked, I does my thang
Don't mistake me, I tote them thangs
Glock fo' pop off, knocks off thangs
Whole squad here, you know my click
Petit nice thing, you know my bitch
Wide body truck, you know my whip
Cop that rock that pop that shit
Y'all niggas, talk about, ain't really got
Me, I think dog, you not really hot
The hood I be, I stay in the drop
My hood, yo' hood, I'll lock any block
East to West Coast, Chi-Town baby
I come through, it's my town baby
A.T.L., I yell "Whattup my baby?"
Hit that, get that, bye bye baby!

{*beat changes*}

[Jay-Z]
Uh-huh uhh..
Guess who? Young Hov'
Bout to tear this motherfucker DOWN!
Holla at me! It goes.. uhh
Jigga Man huh, it goes..
Nah! Y'all niggas ain't gon' have me rappin on the bullshit man
I.. I need some real music
So when we count to three and shit
Ya gonna drop some real shit
One, two, three - let's go![DJ Clue] New Beanie Sigel! Freeway!
[Beanie] Don't get scurred
[DJ Clue] Fat shout, Beat Street

[Hook 1: Beanie]
1, 2 - Sigel comin for you
3, 4 - I'm bout to kick in your door
5, 6 - Man I want those bricks
7, 8 - You gon' give up dat weight
9, 10 - I'll put the Glock to ya chin
11, 12 - Man I'll see you in hell

[Verse 1: Beanie]
I handle tools like hammers and ratchets
Gats wit metal attachments, how you want it metal or plastic
Disrespect your fam bastard, close your casket
Then I give 'em a can of hold your ashes
Visions of the killer for we rose a passin
True killer, true thug, never show no passion
Hit your rug, hit your ceiling, if I know if you stashin
Wrong, nigga the rug, nigga know who you passin
Fresh year from rammin off the zany's fours and perks
Keep the semi handy jammin you for war or work
Niggas like the border goin bizurk
On the roof bangin dat swat, lettin off shots and spurts
Dey tryin to trap me in the back of the yard
Man I'm lettin every cat fall hittin from the cap to the sarge
Can't see me back in the yard, two wacks back to the wall
Use the two gat stash pack in the wall
Picture Mac liftin up racks in the yard
I had a block shiftin up knocking off racks by the yard
The dope from dem dudes, smokeless confused, shit
They ain't know if they want a crack or the saw
Switch they life, straight from the pipe to the straw
Coke in they vein, what you want the dope or the cane
I open the game, to sniffin the D, X to the Z
Hot shit from B-Sig consecutively

[Hook 2: Freeway]
1, 2 - Freeway's comin for yo' ass
3, 4 - You better watch yo' stash
5, 6 - Have you duckin from dem clips
7, 8 - Fuck it I can't wait

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Y'all niggas crazy think Free won't draw the lev'
Prefer the nine but I got the four four instead
I move dymes who your dyme get your whore in bed
Tell that triflin bitch I want more than head
Free might spark at ya clip take more than bread
Guns and bricks while young bulls hug the block
Dey love the strip, help 'em get chains and watches
Guns and kicks, Freeway my name is priceless, flow is sick
And remember if you lie on Free
Lie in the lake, while your bitch lies on Free
She ride on the snake and my whip over her key
We ride in the jakes, empty clips hop on Amtrak
Out of the state, broody shit, you and yo man, right outta ya case
Hold dis clip blow your brain right outta ya face
Flow legendary, hotter than Mase
Dude Free never where we outta the case
Roc-A-Fella pop criss til we outta the case
Form the hood nigga Nikes, Delts, and 'Lo Sport
Hood niggas just like me, belted and blow court
Hood chickens just bite me well and blow squad
I was 16, 12,000 wit no job
And I skipped school, gripped a bitch wit no ride
See the crack smoked leave bitch wit no thighs, no tits
Rob hustlers wit no clips, no guns, left niggas wit no chips
And the flow runs like the Mississippi River
And your ho comes, ya bitch hear me when I whisper
Silence all guns hit 'em fo-fo-fo-fo-for dey hit ya
If we comin for you than nigga we gonna get ya

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]* the version on Belly has an extra verse

[Memphis]
Yeah, check it
Yo yeah I smoke weed now I don't give a fuck
And I also tote guns in case my dram pop up
It's crew love I spit two at every few thugs
Fo doves blow dubs holdin eight snub
I hold it down my strip, goin nowhere
Flip two eightballs trick the dough on low gear
The next week two O's gone
Nigga don't prolong
Play the studio and get my flow on
And sell weight on a later base
My older brother kept guns on his waist in case he air the place
And walk straight up on you fuckin crooked niggas
Comin out ya mouth sideways like some rookie niggas
I drink Henny mixed wit nothing
My weed and the dutch is somethin
What you niggas sayin nuttin
It's Bleek, controllin these streets holdin the heat
Reportin for my live niggas just like me WHAT

[Jay-Z]
Haha this is Roc-A-Fella for life
This is Roc-A-Fella for life

[Hook]
You know it's crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die
As long as you and I keep it movin like a drive-by
We could stack dough sky-high
Niggas can't touch what they can't feel real recognize real
Crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die
As long as you and I keep it movin like a drive-by
We could stack dough sky-high
Niggas can't touch what they can't feel real recognize real

[Beanie Siegel]
Yo, I set up shop wit nick rocks that'll upset rookies
Make 'em slide like li'l dicks in wet pussy
Open up the whole strip, like Monopoly
Dare one of ya'll to land on my property
Think you get some dough for my community chest?
Blaow blaow two to yo chest
Ya'll niggas can't pass go cuz it cost to pass
Ya'll niggas cheap like Baltic Ave
Type ta land on jail can't pay your bail
Wanna borrow from the bank, nigga what you think
I'm the wrong one to lie to
Shit I'm the man who supply who supply who supply YOU
And ya'll a bunch talk money
I'm tryin to get it down for that motherfuckin boardwalk money
Two-brick money new blue six money
Peru trip money flew in six money
Taj Mahal trips orange chips money
Long dick money all in yo bitch money
Flow like the flu and spit sick money
Peep hotty's Roc-A-Fella wools route
All black mask down wit they tools out
Beanie mack I'll move out
I had niggas runnin from school pickin new routes
Then I'll run and lick a shot make 'em move south
Switch up they last name get a new spouse
Scrambled up some down-payment for a new house
No matter where you go Mack gone find ya
I'm like a shadow nigga I'm right behind ya
I'll blow out ya brains and won't give ya no reminder

[Hook]

[Memphis]
Me and my road dog
Been OG's for so long
Spit raw rolled up niggas can smoke on
Shit I let 'em have it you faggots ain't know my status
Fuckin with my mathematics you make us savage
Five nine one six O, light brown
M-E-M-P-H-I-S Bleek put it down

[Jay-Z]
Its crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die
As long as you and I keep it movin, nigga

[Beanie]
Aiyyo I pray to the God MC to bless me
Wit a ill ass flow and sick ass dough
Where it don't make no sense that hundreds and cents and
Thousands of dollars ice freezes my collar
Where I need a turtle-neck to rock my check
And a pair of isotoners to rock my rings
Get the signin bonus know mack toppin them thangs
Flip twice rip that crew then I'm droppin my thang

[Jay-Z]
Nigga it's crew love[P. Diddy]
Bad Boy
Let's dance (7x)
Yo, everybody report to the dance floor
Report to the dance floor
Bad Boy baby
112, Beanie Sigel
Here we go!

[Beanie Sigel]
God damn, guess who stepped up in the place?
The kid with two rubbers on his waist
Two steppin' to the base
And I don't usually step up in the place
I usually pull that lead out, ready to get a lead out
But damn, since I stepped up in the place
I'm try'na touch you, squeeze you, tell you what's the case
Before I bust, you squeeze, outta telly and a case of Cris'
I'm tryin' to take you to the telly, bust in ya ffffff
Tryin' to lure me out on the dance floor
I'm tryin' to get it twirly on the dance floor
Everything remains the same, might spit-talk to it
Then "Change The Game", might Crip-Walk to it
But never Harlem shake it, Harlem make it, Harlem break it
Dawg, I ain't hardly made this
You talkin' to one of Roc's finest
And do rewind this; it's Bad Boy's finest!

[Slim]
I can see over there, just chillin' with your girlfriends
Can't believe your by yourself, you should be here with me
Chillin' with me, drinkin' with me, freakin' with me

[Hook: 112]
I see you lookin' at me
I can tell by your eyes that you're feelin' me
And I really want you to get close to me
So would ya, dance with me, dance with me?
My drop-top's in the parking lot
And I wanna take you back to my spot
But we still got a little more time to rock
So would ya, dance with me, dance with me?

[Slim]
I can see it in your eyes that you're lookin' at the time
You wanna leave this party and I know you wanna leave with me
Touch her with me, to drink with me, to freak with me
Oh baby!

[Hook 2x]

[Bridge]
Oh baby, won't you come with me?
On to the dance floor
Cause you're lookin' so sexy I just want you to come home with me
So that it could be just you and me
But before we go I just want you to come dance with me

[Hook]

[Daron]
If you're sexy and ya know it, clap yo' hands (2x)
And if you're sexy and ya know it, and you really wanna show it
If you're sexy and ya know it, clap yo' hands

[Hook till fade]
