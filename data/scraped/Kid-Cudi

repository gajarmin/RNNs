[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I’ve forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I’m in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said “take them glasses off and get in the pool”
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don’t believe in yesterday
And what’s a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m coming after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, it's like that y'all
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can’t live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Outro: Kid Cudi][Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Crush a bit - little bit - roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel, driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling in the Midwest side and out, living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out: "Fuck that"
I'mma do just what I want, looking ahead no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

[Hook: MGMT] x2
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Tell me what you know about dreaming, dreaming
You don't really know about nothing, nothing
Tell me what you know about them night terrors, every night
5AM cold sweats waking up to the sky
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams
Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow

[Hook: MGMT] x2

[Hook: Kid Cudi]

[Bridge: Guitar Solo]

[Hook: MGMT] x2

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Pursuit of happiness, yeah
I don't get it, I'll be good (no)
Oh, man (oh)
Room's spinning (room's spinning)
Oh my god, why'd I go and drink so much and smoke so much, oh
Oh[Produced by Kanye West; Co-Produced by Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Choir]
All of the lights, lights, all of the lights

[Hook: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Post-Hook: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flash lights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I’ll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own

[Verse 3: Fergie]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

[Hook: Choir]

[Outro: Alicia Keys & Elton John]
Whoa, whoa
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh
Whoa, whoa
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh
Whoa, whoa
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh
Whoa, whoa
I tried to tell you but all I could say[Verse 1]
I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga Man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rolling with them Brooklyn boys
You know how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
"Why he by himself?"
He got two older brothers, one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see, the little bit of sadness in me, Scotty

[Hook]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 2]
I'm super paranoid, like a 6th sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I tried to think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cocks been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancun
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try to shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand... fam

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I was close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slitting my throat
Ignorance to cope man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love, and I need that shit
If I never did shows, then I'd probably be a myth
If I cared about the blogs, then I'd probably be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' bout fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down, pussy and some Cali trees
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

[Hook][Verse 1: King Chip]
I'm just what you made God - not many I trust
I'mma go my own way, God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryin' to get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin' bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush, that big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on" she said, "Naw, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, endless shopping, I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain’t working fam
In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world of trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

[Hook]

[Outro]
Need it to get by, ya
Willy[Produced by Kid Cudi & Dot Da Genius]

[Verse 1]
I am happy to be alive
Cause I know I could not be in a place that's filled with lies
Can't stand no quiet nights, why I fill up my glass with pride
Hopeful is  all I know, how to keep me from silent cries
Nothing I can say
Facing all this pain in my way
I fight it every day
Why am I this way?
A nigga tryna maintain
I sit and tell myself, "okay"
We gotta find another way
You gotta find another way
You gotta find another way

[Hook] (x2)
Don't be so down, c'mon young homie
You'll be okay, you'll find real love
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely
Now is the time to show what you're made of

[Verse 2]
I am happy to be alive
Cause I know I could not be in a place so filled with lies
Can't stand no quiet nights, why I fill up my glass with pride
Hopeful is all I know, how to keep me from silent cries
Nothing I can say
Done running from this pain in my way
I'm fighting every day
Why am I this way?
A nigga tryna maintain
I sit and tell my self, "okay"
We gotta find another way
You gotta find another way
You gotta find another way

[Hook] (x2)

[Hook][Verse 1 - Kid Cudi]
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me
Anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

[Hook]
She said: I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

[Verse 2 - Kid Cudi]
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
I'm Yeezy, she say "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you a angel, you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, you take her to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, "No, not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die Aria!Born to do it
Even though all my friends lookin at me like who knew it
Run to it
The hoods just spit by new nigga
Feel cats talkin like who nigga
Is he
Where did he come from CL
My mom prayed for me on my journey
Treat me like an alien something like sigourney
Live through the game for the fame and the gurney
Tried to put me on the pedestal
Hoes treated me like who are you
Now I get to choose like you and her too
I just like girls not whores
But I have a chill time make s'mores
But if I wanna plow someone like a snow blower
I can work that ass like a workout plan
And then I holla at fam
Talkin bout Ye, Don C., Jigga man
Been representing since I met 'Quence and I get style tips from my homeboy Ibn
Common's the homie
Really Doe is the homie
GLC is the homie
And Big Sean what a gwan'
I go monkey paw on the record and they think I’m cookoo
Niggas is sign and dated like they recorded in fubu
Most niggas will quote you play scrabble with your words man
Till you see them at your shows is my dick that they blow man
I would sit up some nights and think about my own place
Probably cause I took so many blunts of Kush to the face
My bad thoughts I can’t erase
Or eat what’s on the devils plate
I just tell the devil wait
Cause murder will not be the case
In london with hudson
And them girls want some cuttin
I’m with him so I’m cool
Plus my face on the telly
But I’m pissed at the moment
I got charged for some roamin'
AT&T is some bullshit man I wish they’d stop frontin'
But when I roll back to brooklyn
Hit the store for a dutchie
I say homie keep rappin
I say homie its nothin
I’m
This is
Dream on
Now when I roll back to cleveland
Hit the store for a phillie
Niggas tell me keep rappin
Cause them young niggas feel me
Hear me
Hah hem
Hear me
Yep yep
Hear me
Yep yep yep
Hear me
Hear me
When I roll out to cali
Hit the store for a swisher
Niggas tell me keep rappin
I say homie I get'cha
Hear me
Hear me
Cudder
This is the Dopest shit
Hope Niggas like that shit
("Dream On", "Dream On")[Verse 1]
You sit and think about how you can hit the scene
Take one look inside, your mirror clear to see
You need to find yourself as honest as can be
There must be 50 ways to make a record
Now don't get wrapped into the hype and what they think
This shit ain't rocket science and the scene changes with beats
And now you ask yourself, how you want to be seen
There must be 50 ways to make a record
He's up inside the clubs, they like to lean and rock, oh
Stands around and looks intrigued by what he saw, now he askes me
How he can make hit songs to reach the top
There must be 50 ways to make a record.. 50 ways to make a record

[Verse 2]
You got talent and your soul cannot be bought
He looked and smiled at me and told me "Thanks a lot."
See I could use your help
And would you please explain about the 50 ways
It's kind of easy if you have a open mind
This game is more than spending money and fucking dimes
It's all within your words, some shit that outlives time
There must be 50 ways to make a record.. 50 ways to make a record[King Chip]
Have us a good time, and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around, nigga slide by,
Have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, got some friends around me

I'm feeling strange in the night
I'm in myself I feel I'm thrown into a fight
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide nothing's right
My skin is burning and my heart begins to speed
There's something going wrong with me
I am changing rapidly
I'm feeling stronger, more alert, I'm on the move
I smell her scent and I know I will find her soon, soon, soon
The one to come and free me from this fate
I'll find her, it's not too late, hey, hey

You call it Heaven, I do too we feel the same
Ain't nothing wrong I bin feasting on something brave
A sexy lady who's pure, she has the cure, uh
I hope she can find a man within the beast, and
I hope she saves me from the curse I have to beat, hey
I hope she figures out a way to save my soul
Yeah, to save my heart, hey

And took up in the clizzoud
I am the lone wolf
Go where I wanna
Let the moon shine be the guide to the lizzight
Even when I stray away the light never left me, uh
I learn to follow my instinct
Blinded by the light
Rather that than the evil
Feelin out of place in a room full of people
Try and be the same, but you know you're not a sequel
Your fate will be whatever it shall be, be, be, be, be
We'll fight no more, I let these things just be, be, be, be

When the nights, change
So do my nightmares too

All along, all along
I guess, I'm meant, to be alone
All along, all along

Out there on my own, yeah

When the weeks change

When the months, change
So do my love point of views

At the beach, we come undone

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Hey, hello world, hello sweet summer Cudder
Ain't nobody rowdy, the cops won't hound me
The women of the women of the Chucks I'm wearin'
They slave through my artistry, can't stop starin'
So nice, Swishers for the roll-up, the grape Cigarillo
Little Mama roll'em good though
Everybody chillin' we ain't worried 'bout shit
Everybody chillin' we ain't worried 'bout a thing
I understand life of the beggar
Lookin' at the ocean, on shrooms is way iller
Callin my mama, tell her not to worry
I'm a man in the wild, and the wild is the best
I digress, this might just be hit or miss
My intentions all summer have certain just been missed
Mantain, they keep my brain 'sane
With a little rage

[Hook: Bethany Cosentino] (x2)

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Ex-juvenile delinquent
Yes, relapse when I fuck with Jameson
I'm thinking 'bout death like it's pussy in my mind
And the vibe, and I'm feelin like life's so lame
Heaven's probably iller, with way more babes
Way more ways to get faded
My first album was emo? What the fuck
Cats tryna play me, now I gotta show 'em what is what
I'm the one who comes when you're feeling so numb
You're the one who runs so I'm the one who hunts you
Hoes try to remember it's so fun to confront you
I am the rager, I am forever
Half of the time most the time I'm blunted
If I die it wouldn't all be for nothing
And all my life I'm doin what I wanna
So I'm livin' in the moment til God push the button on me

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half stepping
Over here we ain't half stepping
Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half stepping
Over here we ain't half stepping

[Verse 2: Chip tha Ripper]
I'm a cold young man Midwest Cleveland representer
My bitch could take your bitch home with her
I'm hot and cold, but never lukewarm
And niggas always talking 'bout what they can do for 'em
I'm the prince I came royal penis stay clean
All the shit that I seen you can only day dream
Runnin my city since I was 18
The coldest, so fuck what a hater might think
Chillin on the higher side of the clouds
Life was nothing like life is now
Just wanna have a couple dollars on deck
And change their perspec I'mma aim for the neck
In the club I see you niggas jumping up and down sweating
Only for attention
Pathetic
You only paid twelve hundred dollars for that old school
Name dropping ass nigga, don't nobody know you

Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half steppin
Over here we ain't half steppin
Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk

[Intro x3: Jay-Z]
You either love me or leave me alone

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Oh, they want me to fall (fall)
Fall from the top (top)
They want me to drop (drop)
They want me to stop (stop)
They want me to go (go)
I'm already gone (already)
The shit that I'm on (hey)
I'm already home

[Bridge: Jay Z]
Hey, I'm already home
Now one more 'gin

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
These niggas want me to go, don’t they know that I'm gone
They know I'm space shuttle level, they need oxyg-g-g-gen
Don't they know that they boring? Don’t they know that I yawn?
Only time they exciting is when they mentioning Shawn
Seen Single White Female when she dyed her hair blonde?
Sometimes I look at these rappers, the movie remind me of them
Somebody turn these boys off, don't they know that I'm on
Can't they see that it's foolish to try and kill me with songs
What the fuck are they Lauryn, they killing me softly
You talk me to death, only thing you can do to him
I open the door for them, what else can I do
These niggas want me to walk for them
Somebody talk to them before I go off on them

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I taught 'em 'bout fish scale, they want me to fish for them
They want me to catch clean then cook up a dish for them
All of this just for them or they got a diss for him
They want me to disappear like it's gon shift for them
They say that I'm in the way, they want me to sit for them
But what they admitting is they ain't got shit for him
And really the fact is, we not in the same bracket
Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets
Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches
So how am I in the way, what is it I'm missing?
Nigga I been missing, nigga I been gone
The shit that you just witnessing I been on
And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it
Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it
Now these niggas is mad, oh, they call me a Camel
But I mastered the drought, what the fuck I'm an animal
Half man half mammal, my sign is a Sadge
This is just what I planned to do, oh, don't be mad

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I’m in The Hall already, on the wall already
I’m a work of art, I'm a Warhol already
On another level, on another plane already
H-O-V, I got my own lane already
I done cooked up the rock already
So why the fuck can't ya'll get hot already
Put your name in the pot already
Niggas compare me to Biggie and Pac (already)
Like I'm gone already
And I am nigga I'm already home already (already)
If ya'll can't already see
I ain't worried about ya'll cause I'm already me (already)
Do you already, enough with the complaining, boo-hoo's already
Eat food already ain't nothing given you gotta claim your shoes already

[Bridge]
Yeah so in summation I don't know who you racing
I'm already at the finish line with the flag waving
Come on

[Hook] x2[Hook] x2
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons

[Verse 1]
I was born on the pirate ship
Hold your tongue to say that
Super duper nervous all the time
Never chill back
Never caught slippin', even in my kicks made of ice
All day, all day lookin foward to the night
Feel like I'mma die any minute, so I live on tracks beyond these limits
You should stay free when I partyin and wippin
I can hear them coming, the demons like to listen
I trip out sippin, I re-lax stoned
Never feel safe even if I'm at my home
They can still find me, we ridin all the time
Hot damn she is fine, hope she party all the time
I can be your Eddie, my dick is up and ready
The lust takes over, merging all the hours
Before I go sour, I step back and look at
The evils got me tooken, most cats be shooken

[Hook] x3[Kid Cudi]
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Uh-huh... yeah
First things first, been rippin, get it in Cudder
Niggas know the name, it's none other

Two-stepper, gun-toter nah nah, smoke kusher

Skinny niggy niggy in your city gettin chizzange
Like I'm Carmelo, meet me in the pizzaint
Yammin on you sucker niggas, yammin on these hoes
Roll Swishers in the whip, i'm dippin' so quick

If you knew me man, I don't really worry about
A nigga tryin to Judge; who are you, Judy?!
Girl shake a feather, do your thang 'til you feel right

[Hook]

[Bridge: repeat 2X]
Life, together we all in together now
All in together, all all baby

[Kid Cudi]

Even if I do somethin unruly
I be like, "FUCK IT NIGGA I WAS PROBABLY ZOOTED!"
Off top... honestly

Find my own rhythm while I'm lookin through my Viennas
Everybody gon' talk that shit until they see 'em

Aye it's just chip tha rip and kiddo
It's just chip the rip and kiddo, (yeah)
Ask about me

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Dawg it's the weirdo again
I packed my bags back up in the land
Hoes talk down and then shake your hand
Believe me my nigga, supply and demand
I walked that line I learned them ropes
Did my thing I prayed and hoped
Now I'm getting back cuz my thick hoes wanna date
Put no limit just twerkin' and movin'
I stick and probe when I get it in then I might dip fast
If you focused you might cash
But not like Ray so please fall back
Live your life don't focus on money
Hello girl you can call me the moon man
Up above I fly fast anywhere nigga any given time a couple lines
Homeboy I ain't gotta rhyme so nice with it
And I keep that wahoo fitted
Flow was gravy, Bape, beige and navys
Back in high school hoes tried to diss me
Now all I gotta do is sing for a pretty thing
Give me five minutes, she all on my ding-a-ling
Can't live if you ain't about something
Can't talk if you live life frontin'
Boss life from invisible see a model then it's go time
Never handed it so I took mine
I didn't have a watch so I took time
Format it now they gotta jock it
My slim cut jeans haters try to knock it
Now them same mother fuckers keep 501's
10 Deep, bumpin' that slab up

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
I be on that-that-that monster shit
RAWR bitch, lot's of dick
If hoes get to beggin' that front door shall be their consequence
Get up outta here bitch, Cudi got some hoes comin'
And when them hoes come all they talkin' cummin'
Turn pike hustler that'll be I
Pullin' up to your city pretty high
And it's all for the rent, it's all for the fits
The money goes to the kush packs and the cigs
And the music I do it for the hoods and the kids
And the baby mamas who be in the hood with the kids
Do shit for the money fuck a favor
Text the address I'll see you later
M-I-A that's where I'll be
But for now I'mma G-R-I-N-D
Til a nigga caked up ain't worried bout shit
Meantime nigga better worry about Chip
Meantime nigga better worry bout clips
They gone be up in your ass if you talkin' that shit
To the wrong motherfucker from the jungle dog
Niggas out here come and hunt you down
Doors still be wide as a mother fucker
And them 15s be jumpin dog
Mister Don't-Give-A-Fuck is in the place
Louis shades, 700 on my face
Fresh scampi I'm loving that taste
Neva snitch, 12 hundred for the case
Me and Cudi here now what's good
You done fell off like we knew you would
Now I can show you how to be a real nigga be the coldest and still be true to your hood

[Hook] x4[Produced by WZRD]

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Help me take off my Balmain jeans
I’ll undo yours
You can lick it after I’m done lickin’ you first
I wanna taste it
Tired of waitin’
Are you tasty?

Yahm yahm
Come on baby
Yahm

Hope you can feel that vibe
The vibes of the night
Your body is warm
In my arms
We're under the stars

Can I come inside your vortex
Can I come inside your vortex
Let me baby

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
It’s been so long, been such a hobby
Finding someone who electrifies my body
I need you to protect my heart
Gimme your hand, put it here
This is where you start

Keep feelin’ on me
(Don’t stop)
Keep feelin’ on me

Keep feelin’ on me
(Don’t stop)
Keep feelin’ on me

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Lord help me
Lord help me
I got a lover under my covers
I don’t want her to leave
She said I'm perfect
Perfectly kissing on my neck
She is the sexiest
She said she loves my scent

Hope you can feel that vibe
The vibes in the night
Her body is warm
In my arms
We're under the stars

I wanna taste it
Tired of waitin’
Are you tasty?

Yahm yahm
Come on baby
Yahm

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Raphael Saadiq]

[Intro: RZA]
Zig-Zag. Yo, check it. Eyo

[Verse 1: RZA]
Who could take a single buck, an empty cup, a stroke of luck
Fuck around and reconstruct it up to a million bucks
In God we trust, every part of us is marvelous
You Krusty Krab squad, ya'll will rust, ya'll ain't hard enough
Demolition expert, I exert through your network while the TEC squirt jerk
There's holes inside your sweatshirt
Through your apparel, through your blood, through your bone marrow
Precise with this mic device, slice your pie like Sbarros
You falling nigga, and you can't get up
You been stalling motherfucker now your ass is stuck
Brooklyn, Brownsville, baby stay with the Killer Hill crazy
Ankle strap above the boot, it conceals my three eighty
Are you running for this money money, hunting eggs like easter bunny
Geeks trying to beast upon me, freak I will eat a zombie
Calm and double while you jumping through these hurdles, silly rabbit
The race is always won by the turtle, mental machinery
Purple herbal mixed with that greenery
I don’t write songs, grasshopper, I write sceneries
Everything ain’t what it seems to be, what it means to you it don’t mean to me
Bzzzz, a sting from the killer bees

[Hook]
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them them them, motherfucking Beez) [x4]
Beez on 'em
Stings bitch
Bzzzz... BzzzzZZZzzz

[Verse 2: RZA]
I pass any test of litmus, I workout at 24 fitness
On the weekends, I sip Belvedere with that citrus
My dogs is vicious, exotic
Exotic nympho whore for the mistress
Life is good, I live every day like it's Christmas
Happy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here
I splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear
Trust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out
Long dick stamina, I fuck a bird til she sings out
La la la la, Bobby could convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala
Plus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas
Like Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla
Gold rings like the Green Lantern
You see me in the mean phantom
Pushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton
Or maybe in the grotty, rugged projects of Staten
Tall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton

[Hook][Verse 1]
These voices they tell me go
Why should I ever go?
Man, I'm so comfortable here
Why should I head to a place where people live in fear?
Stand off is still really here
Something they can really feel
But see, I'll never get why the earth is a puzzle that'll never fit
I'm not of their world
So why should I leave my sanctuary?
Man, the whole thought of that is scary
How do I know that their kind will truly hear me out
Will they understand I'm flying from a different route?
Pose as a human being, mother moon tells me that people need my help
I guess these are the cards she threw out and dealt
She said I gotta do it alone
She said I gotta do it alone
I guess I gotta go

[Hook:]
You gotta do it alone, man
You gotta do it alone
You gotta do it alone, man, go on your own
It's bigger than you, man
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than you, man

[Verse 2]
She said to pack my bags dawg, and never look back
This is something that I have to do
A hero to save the world
A hero with no girl and no family
Just sacrifice as a friend
And struggle is the enemy
But weed is the remedy
And if you get lonely, boy, you can just roll up a dutch and keep your head high
Wanna see home, look at the sky
Remember you're not strange, but you're not the same man[Bridge]
No light to guide my way
I'm going blind down the hill
Nothing that no one can say
I'm gonna find my will to live

No light to guide my way
I'm goin' blind down the hill
There's nothing that no one can say
I'm gonna find my will to live

[Hook]
No, I won't brake
No, I won't brake, yaauw

[Bridge]
No light to guide my way
Im' goin blind down the hill
There's nothing that no one can say
Im gonna find my will to live

[Hook]
No, I won't brake, yeaaa[Verse 1: King Chip]
If my niggas don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in 92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas go'n eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be (x4)
Hey yo, all right

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they neva change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin got them sucka niggas hatin
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' bout crack or we talkin about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up, then they pickin the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin, they fixin' to run up
Then they gettin the come up, yup bitch
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If its a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad my nigga

[Hook][Verse 1: King Chip]
If my niggas don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you

Hey yo, all right

[Verse 2: Rolla Costa]
If my brothers don't fuck with you ima fuck with you
Egg your fucking whip right in front of your bad bitch
Didn't care if my swag was weird they staired
Like 50 flights so they couldn't keep up with my fly
But it's like when they see me with a new joint they wanna cyph
But I'm laughing like ain't this nigga said I can't ride a bike
Started rocking these jerseys and it trended to my brothers
Like Ben got my brother franklin working started from a boss at young
But rally just chillin having fun
So when you see me just know I'm
Working
Trying to start a business
Ah tv show a clothing line
My nigga we be hoping the train back to the block
We saved guap for lil cezar pizza box (Ahhh) real nigga shit right there
For now crunch time is lunch time and one rhyme is dumb fine

[Hook][Verse 1: Consequence]
Yo, Microphone Check 1 2 what is this?
Con took a check from every boss in the business
You can't be mad at me, thanks for having me
I'm from the same borough as Mobb Deep and Tragedy
Might be on Chelsea lately because of all the fame
So I spit a little game, maybe let her with a chain
Because styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
I'm dropping 20,000 when I'm up on 5th ave
I wear Dior sneakers because the boy's getting cash
And when we in the club, yeah I swing a Louis rag
When it comes to the devils, I'm not a half stepper
To pass weed is speedier than graffiti on the leather
Refuse to compete with BS competition
That couldn't get signed if they had a petition
I never walk streets thinking it's all about me
But I know niggas scheming so it's under the seat
I just try my best not to dumb on out
A Tribe with the Cud so you must be buggin' out

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Yo, a few new stations, put me in rotation
They've embraced the martian, congratulations
Now my knots is too too thick
Bruskies running up asking me to do their favourite hit
With finesse, spit a verse and occasionally I blurt out
I'll strike a chord, and you can thank the lord
As I go in between the glitz and the glam
Listen my submission is the wishes of the fam-o
As a segway, I am alone
I'm trying to get mine, and you should go and get your own
Smoking my weed because it's therapy for me
When everything seems bleak because the devils I foresee
You-me, I-fly
You can't be me because your flow is too shy
I know I'll be the man if a co pull a plug on the autotune
But I can't and that's bug

Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out : (fading)[Kid Cudi]
Element of the surprise
Such a spectacular thing I cannot, lie
So many things people wanna limit you to be
I show you a glimmer inside the spectrum of the wizard
Well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
The negative that come out they mouth, so sad
When I smash wipe the smirk off their face, my bad
Who bad? I am, my dad raised one hell of a man
At eleven I had to throw on the pants
Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
Come on who gon' go half on a zone
Oh, thought I would be done off the coke, no
Let me tell you something ho
Ben said "Everything that shine ain't gold."
Been skeetin' on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
Been the nigga sittin' in hell in fresh ass clothes
I know what it feels like to have a broken nose
And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be ok, with being demented
By the way nigga these cars ain't rented I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted look who the fuck it be
That skinny Cleveland niggie I stay reppin' my city bitch
Been smokin no jokin cudder’s had that itch
So I scratch, so please no more speculation bout that

[Outro]
Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted
I’m back so please no more speculation ‘bout that
Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted
I’m back, niggas think I’m livin life paranoid
(Mothafuck that, man)
Aw, they got me twisted, they don’t know that boy
(Mothafuck them, man)
I’m just gettin busy killin it, gettin busy
(Mothafuck that, man)
I just wanna watch it burn, baby, burn
Niggas think I’m living life paranoid
(Mothafuck that, man)
Aw, they got me twisted, they don't know that boy
(Mothafuck that, man)
I’m just gettin busy killin it, I'm gettin busy
