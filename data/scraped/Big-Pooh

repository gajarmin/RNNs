[Hook: Darien Brockington]
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
So happy

[Phonte]
Aiyyo man, I don't ask for much
I just wanna chill at home and sip my drink out of my plastic cups
Even though my roommate have me mad as fuck
Nigga be acting crackish, fucking up my money hustling backwards
Financially I took some hard blows
But shit I also rocked some hard shows
Niggas came to check us out by the carloads
Screaming my name like I scanned a million barcodes already
My squad flows till we all sweaty
We struggling to pay our bills so we really can't ball heavy
And God knows I be calling on him
Cause I be writing mad cheques that might as well have Spalding on 'em
The shoulders of my team, I be falling on 'em
Providing support that help the pain go away
And helping me to see the light like Towa Tei standing by me
That's all I really need to satisfy me
It's just my peeps y'all, for real

[Hook: Darien Brockington with Phonte]
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
Aiyyo, it's real easy to see
Don't take much to please a cat like me, that's how we doing it
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
Uh uh, now bring it back
So happy

[Rapper Big Pooh]
There's been nights I wanted to quit, broke, crying to God
It's kinda hard going far with a lot to carry
Waking up still tired from sessions
Going to class, dozing off, waking up, never learning the lessons
But thanks to my faith and blessing
Struggles pass and I go about life without half the stressing
I know who got my back, no need for raising the question
Cause when times get hard, it's to my brothers I call
Taking the weight, no matter large or small
I smile everyday, thanks to y'all, we gonna eat for real
Ease the mind so we can sleep for real
It took longer than we wished but the blow meant I knew we could
Find the best way to live life, it's so right
We jail tight, ain't no strip stopping our move
We one nation all under a groove
Sending peace to that cat Nicolay, we gonna meet real soon
I'm so happy

[Hook: Darien Brockington with Rapper Big Pooh & Phonte]
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
Uh, we doing this for y'all

Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
Yo, aiyyo we running it now
So happy

[Phonte]
Feel me, like this yo and this how we doing it
It's going out to mans Big Pooh and it
Is like this and it's just how we ripping it
Shouts out to my man named Infinite
And it's just the way got to begin with it
It's going out to my man For 10 and it
And it's just the way we gots to keep it on
For my man Big Dho and Chaundon, let's get it going y'all

[Hook X2: Darien Brockington with Phonte]
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
From Justus League to the world baby
Yo, we keep it going on, yo-yo, we keep it going on
Good people, good loving

Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me...

[Phonte]
You wanna know what I'm feeling for real? Start that shit[Verse 1]
Beat box, this is back to the block
Before every rapper sold rocks
Before everybody needed rocks in they watch
Just watch, now, it's all about boardrooms and stocks
Words paint pictures, I'm an artist non-stop
Raw beats, raps, this is called Hip-Hop
Only way I flop is belly first in they pool
People talk brand talk to a pimp cool
Learn to follow rules, I'm a man first, fool
Get schooled, chalk it all up to business, being shrewd
No guidelines, you're an outline, fool
Sharks in the water, this is what you wanna do
For me, this is like breathing, blood in the veins
Muscle on the bone, we are not the same
I rap to make change, you rapping for the change
Scraps and Cadillacs, go ahead and do your thang

[Hook - Chopped samples]
Over the global, my vocals be travelling
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
I'm the flavor
Over the global, my-my-my my vocals be travelling
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me

[Verse 2]
Gossip sites is where you go to get your raps from
Forbes magazine the spot and we number 1
But no rapper gonna make it to that top layer
You a nigga now, was before you got here
Spitter hard feelings, this is dope dealing
Enough rope for you to choke yourself, easy killing
Call it hands free, youngin', ask for me
I'm on the balcony, hands gripping the pump
See how being drunk off the ego will skew the mind, limited view
A theater near you displays every dream until it seems that it's true
Cointelpro, they infiltrated the crew
Then throw us in a jail operated like a zoo
I'm just reminding you of things you already knew
From that project concrete, a rose grew
But we only see the weeds in our view

[Hook][Intro: Ab-Soul]
I'm just a regular nigga doing regular shit
Doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do
Just a regular nigga doing regular shit
Yeah doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Only thing I ever seen with a purple label
Was a grape swisha, fill it with the purple kush
Pro fives all day, what you know 'bout that?
I know all my LA, niggas know 'bout that
I had the '87 with no system
Portable CD player adapter and it sound ok
Yeah it's a bucket, but I still make it around ok
I was a hustler making my rounds all day though
I keep the cool like a fridge in an igloo
Not too flashy and I ain't too ashy to class he, but that's me
Y'all niggas having menages, I was happy to score in the backseat
I had to get a job, y'all was pushing the packs
Y'all was on Melrose, we was on Am block
Y'all was shooting, we was going twenty-one no headshots
Enjoying it, you new rap niggas is spoiling it

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
I'm just a regular nigga doing regular shit
I drive a regular car, got my regular bitch
Still dressing the part in my regular fit
Like being regular is some irregular shit
You niggas is living the dream
You niggas is getting the cream
Ab in the back, passin' a black
Which one of y'all don't know 'bout that?
I'm on my regular shit

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
White shirt, black chucks
Some new tattoos, am I cool or what?
A few karats in the ear
And I make music that you need to hear
Cups up, let's toast to the year
Young old nigga, I ain't just appear
To the public, my picture's unclear
Around my neck, I don't sport chandeliers
And I don't travel in the Lear
Business or coach class, West coast I'm here
It's no benz's pulling up
No bitches in the back of the 'Bach trynna fuck
I just stack up my chips
Young black man traveling on the road to get rich
Then get wealthy, y'all don't smell me
Regular nigga now, ain't shit you can tell me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Okay, back to reality
You playboys makin' rap a fantasy
Hugh Hef could run hip-hop
How many of his hoes have y'all use his props?
In videos and whatnot, shows, entourage
How much your whole ensemble cost?
Look I'm sayin', there's nothing wrong with flossin'
But there's so much more important
Than what you sport in, how many mills you got
Or how many houses on the hill you got
They didn't love me when I was lucky enough to get new kicks
But now they all on some new shit, on who's dick?
Bargain shoppin', a walk-in closet
Until my money sky high like the mutant school
I like to give you what you're not immune to
You all look the same, I can't tell who's who

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do
Yeah, doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do

[Outro]
What else could you do? What else could Ab-Soul do?
Could Ab-Soul do the 9 to 5? Could you be a construction worker?
Or is it just, is it not gonna happen, like it's gotta be music
I mean, it's really all I got man
There's not too much else I wanna do
I'm not gonna say too much I can do
But it's not much else that I wanna do really, know what I mean?
This is really my passion, but I'm just gonna ride it out
Know what I mean? Whether I'm making minimum wage with it or whatever
Know what I'm sayin'? Shit, I'm broke, I still got a job right now[Sample]
Take your time
Don't be in a hurry
You don't have to...

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Luxury vehicle, not a drop of white in it
Personal license plate so they know it ain't rented
Cruising by the Cruiser so they got to see who in it
A young black male with the intent to sell
"Happy" through the speakers bump a lil' bit Pharrell
Go easy on the gas cause these cops now shell
Five miles later there's another on the trail
A nigger sweating bullets like he moving by the scale
Lights flash and life does too
Make a decision, what the fuck you suppose to do?
When the law is in the rear view to serve no protection
Firing shots off, no discretion
First impression can be your last one
You visualize when you pass 'em
We know the stories and the scene is a continuation
Quiet street to enforce this extermination
Through your mind reverse the situation
Mike shot with his hands held high
And John got killed because of a damn lie
[Kasheem] killed blocks away from where Big Mike died
Oscar got shot with his hands cuffed behind
Shawn killed the night before his wedding that was tough
Diallo shot at 41 times, these cops are nuts
Victor shot handcuffed in the cop car
They ruled it suicide so tell me I'm not far
From being off when I'm thinking just to run
It don't matter that I'm innocent when they pointing the guns
My life is in the balance
And I was never trained for this challenge
So to me that's a lose/lose
This ain't the way we trying to make it on the news
Mama hearing stories 'bout her baby that ain't true
Slander in the first
Dehumanized before you even lowered in the dirt
Shot at nine times when you was just leaving work
Now who afraid of whom?
Cops drawing guns on black males like high noon
Guilty I assume what they thinking cause I look
Like one of them guys featured in they book
They ask me where I'm going
State the violation
Right on red light
What's my occupation?
License and registration
Tell me where you coming from
I search your car, any drugs any guns?
"That's only if you plant it" I respond with a smirk
He shot a look back, my response was knee jerk
Let off with a warning consider myself blessed
Only a few alive can understand that stress

[Hook: Steve Roxx]
And there is sometimes that everybody gets lucky
And I know the feeling
When I'm stopped
I wanna go somewhere
So far away from here
But I don't think he getting me
So what? When I'm stopped[Intro]
Reporting live, from Compton, California
North Cackalack

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, no Audemar on my wrist
Its arthritis from holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
Whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
With offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, who ya? No one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
Like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
Off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
To celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even Zeus can beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
City like a District Attorney being the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers

[Verse 4: Rapper Big Pooh]
U-P-S, I deliver
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped

[Hook][Produced by Tommy Black]

[Intro]
Uh, Soul Brother Number...
Rapper ! Ha, Whats Good Big Homie
Ya Know I Got That Flava

(Good Evening Ladies & Gentleman
This evening takes great pride in presenting)

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Uh, Soul brother number 2
Here to take number 2 on any number 2
That's who's ever after me
Don't get my spot confused
Like a gang of dalmatians in the same room
I never sleep; you snooze, you lose
I'm on a consecutive leap
Slick wit it, sippin' a 40, No WD
Splendid, ended my name on your brain
Like a paragraphs first sentence..(MANE!)
Please see the passion in this young man
Burn this bitch down even if I got one fan
Like, You hear this, you ears will sun tan
I'm an army tank, you're just one man
And niggas talkin' bout they label offers
Knowin' damn well them labels off ya
You know you got it all wrong
When you start equating your success with Drake and Trey Songz
Soul

[Hook]
Where you need to be?
Where you need to go?
What you need to see,? lemme know
(Baby I Can show You...show You)
We only got one life
Live it to the T
But, Take It From Me
(Don't let time control you..trol' You)

Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?

I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like

Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?

I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
I say I'm livin' like the world can't hold me
Mama can't scold me, like a lawn chair niggas fold me
Flow sounding moldy & dated
Rap game I hate it
But at the same time I'm in love deeply
I'm in love indiscreetly, stop looking for them neat raps
Go ahead get ya wet naps
Chicago poetic justice with my wave cap
I know some people mad at me cause I ain't wave back
Double Impact; No Jean Claude
Niggas got stories but most of them fraud
We are all flawwed
Only difference is I display mine
If I say your music whack, that's a hate crime
You can debate I'm better than the next one
Each fan text one, I could a have million
Me and Ab building, Me and Ab killing
I wish you would fight the feeling

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
King of my stomping ground
I don't fuck around, like a Tupperware top I shut shit down
I wear the underwear here, it's best you know now
When Queers interfere I can feel it in the air
They ain't gotta make a sound
Ain't shit sweet
But the swisher full of weed where my thumb and my index meet
You don't quite cut the criteria
We keep trees on us like LRG, Cause
Mass hysteria walkin' across the street, cause
They never seen a nigga so concrete
And You can understand that right?
You look a little dumbfounded
Believe whatever you looking for I done found it
I can show you the real and I can tell you the grind
But even T-Pain get this shit overnight
And If, nothing else remember this
The smartest man in the world know we don't know shit

[Outro]
Tommy Black, Wassup
Tommy Black, Wassup
Soul Brother Number.....See, you'll always be a part of me
I'll be good for you, wait and see...

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
My mama told me Thomas you should keep fighting
The words that I heard is you should keep writing
Blank stare out the window, watching a plastic bag go exactly as the wind blow
Steady is the tempo, these people think it's simple waking up every morning trying to figure out where time go
My thoughts ain't clear, how am I wind up here?
Now I'm drinking a beer, it's 10 o'clock in the a.m. me and my body swaying to the mayhem
People like it ain't him, staring at me like they looking at an evil twin
Half grin the only thing that I could muster, knowing at that exact moment my life was really flustered
My house flooded, career studded, me and my baby got our backs to the wall like it ain't nothing
Actually I'm breaking down though, my life's soundtrack the beautiful sounds of a piano
Played by a two year old, banging on the keys
Every night I'm on my knees asking God mercy please help me out
I know he hear my please without a doubt (ha)
Now it's time for me to get out, keep pushing
No cushion, hungrier than ever, I'm willing to grind forever
Fuck whether I'm the postman
The end of the night propose a toast fam
Trying to fake it til you make it, you dont understand

[Hook: Jared Evans]
I was never happy, but if you're here with me then we could sing a song
How ill would that be? If we could celebrate forever til we're gone
With (?) around me, is everything I need so let the candles go
(uh huh) happy birthday ya'll, happy birthday ya'll

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Parked the car I burned out out of second gear
Every year, I'm talking bout it's my year
On that 12th now, working on the 5th year
Trying to navigate the world, but its rocky here
No Adrians, No Apollo Creeds
I flipping soil for my future seeds
I'm tired of flipping soil and I don't own the deeds
If a snakes in your yard better cut the weeds
Preoccupied with want;s, can't afford your needs
And the teacher told me I wouldn't succeed (haha)
Can you hear me now? Margie's middle child making mama really proud
You can finally smile, tomorrow means a brighter day
Happy birthday ya'll, wipe your tears away

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Happy birthday ya'll, Happy birthday-birthday, yeah (3x)[Verse 1]
Beat box, this is back to the block
Before every rapper sold rocks
Before everybody needed rocks in they watch
Just watch, now, it's all about boardrooms and stocks
Words paint pictures, I'm an artist non-stop
Raw beats, raps, this is called Hip-Hop
Only way I flop is belly first in they pool
People talk brand talk to a pimp cool
Learn to follow rules, I'm a man first, fool
Get schooled, chalk it all up to business, being shrewd
No guidelines, you're an outline, fool
Sharks in the water, this is what you wanna do
For me, this is like breathing, blood in the veins
Muscle on the bone, we are not the same
I rap to make change, you rapping for the change
Scraps and Cadillacs, go ahead and do your thang

[Hook - Chopped samples]
Over the global, my vocals be travelling
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
I'm the flavor
Over the global, my-my-my my vocals be travelling
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me

[Verse 2]
Gossip sites is where you go to get your raps from
Forbes magazine the spot and we number 1
But no rapper gonna make it to that top layer
You a nigga now, was before you got here
Spitter hard feelings, this is dope dealing
Enough rope for you to choke yourself, easy killing
Call it hands free, youngin', ask for me
I'm on the balcony, hands gripping the pump
See how being drunk off the ego will skew the mind, limited view
A theater near you displays every dream until it seems that it's true
Cointelpro, they infiltrated the crew
Then throw us in a jail operated like a zoo
I'm just reminding you of things you already knew
From that project concrete, a rose grew
But we only see the weeds in our view

[Hook][Hook: HaLo]
It's like the bomb's last bang
It's feeling like the bomb's last bang
It's feeling like the bomb's last bang
The pull back point
What it do, what are you
Got to prove that joint

[Verse 1: Big Remo]
My prayers get longer by the day
One for all the youngin round the way poundin pavement
That grave yard shift shit
Made in Winston, brave heart spirit
Two times for the resident in federal penitentiaries
Babies and babies mammas who barely could eat
With no families to help em so they marry the streets
Baby daddy carry heat like he got a disease
He told her...he out to eat like a savagin beast
And his cabinets is bare as can be
And he barely can breath
And I been there but that was in 2003
Battling asthma wit Maalik, it wakes him out of his sleep
And that remind me of me, and that was 1983
My dad would bring medicine and something to drink
We grab hands when the family eat
Everyone of us, me...I pray for clarity
Peace prosperity
In 2014 ima bleed for everything. The bang nigga

[Verse 2: Big Remo]
And I'm still down to kick it wit the homies from the hood
If I could I put on each and all my homies in the hood
Like I had to get mines homie you should get yours
And stop focusing on what a nigga drivin thru the hood
Ima survivor of the violence
Product of my environment
Who somehow made it out
I seen my shot and took a shot at it
Id hope that you be proud of me. Your kids prolly admire me
If not I know they mommas be, she used to always ride the D
Harsh reality I like to call it honesty
But spoken modestly
I understand why momma be wildin and on her knees in her feelins
She say my words a double edged sword and it's blood on the mirror
I'm not a killer nor a dealer
But they hatin I can feel it, and that's bad for the spirit
For she rest at night she whisper to The Lord
Please don't let these haters take em that's my boy
With a dream and he explored it and niggas ain't supportin it
That bang nigga[Murs - Intro]
It's the barbershop, y'all know the rules..
No fighting, no cussing, no Cuz and no Bloodin'
And sit yourself down and act like you got some sense

Now I step through the door in the flyest pair of Dunks
Quit lying, you ain't seen these at Foot Locker, chump
And I ain't about to argue shoe game with you punks
Who don't know Air Jordans from some Reebok Pumps
And out of twenty-three, thirteen was the hottest
If it's rare and it goes on your foot, then I got it
I’m at Undefeated off La Brea playin' modest
While you running up to eBay to empty out your pockets

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Sock it, in the mouth if you don't wanna get clowned on
Metro-actin cats gettin frowned on, we sound on
Everything from ball to y'alls women
Ballers up in here and they bragging how they living
'Til they card get pulled, still at home with they mommy
Changing faces, Bull City, there's where you find me
Getting a low-down from the nigga innanet
You ain't done with my haircut, yet! I swear to God...

[Hook 2X]
Now if your fade is as tight as we is on the mic
Just got your whip clean and your kicks on tight
'Bout to pull the flyest chick you ever pulled in your life
Then you doing what we doing and you doing it right

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Ayo MURS, it ain't all about a cut to me
Wanna go somewhere, catch some comedy
And get the low-down on the drama, B
This lil' dude showing out, "Who his mama be?!"
It's a lotta trash-talk - "I dress better than him"
"Look better than them, you ain't got no style!"
Keep the pagers going wild with my new-new joints
Caught a glimpse in the mirror, can't keep me on point

[Murs]
Finally made it to Midtown, walked in the Legend's Isle
Got one waiting, so I gotta go second
Checkin it with Quan, cran and Goose
C-2 got his son in the shop running loose
To set the slang straight, ya girl is ya cape
And if she's blowing you out, then you gotta set her straight
Now everybody hate to wait, but it's so much fun
A bunch of dudes chilling, no beef, no guns

[Hook 2X]

[Murs]
Now my barber named Lester, he from the N-O
Best fades in LA if you, didn't know
Tighter than Jamie, in the Kanye video
Still freestyle and getting Gs' when I rip a show
Especially when it's in the scope, you know I'm gettin low
Shout out to all my playas that be chillin in the Mo'
...Slim, you don't want it with him
Peel ya cap back to the fat meet with this pen

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I been, in the chair, four bucks and some change
Can't keep takin breaks, cause he wanna go eat
Then he start taking breaks, cause he wanna go speak
I shoulda known better coulda went over to T, but
It's all gravy bread, put the money in his hand
Right now, got me cut like a new man
Caught up on my jokes, fashion to folks
Who I ain't seen since the last time we spoke

[Hook 2X]

[Rapper Big Pooh - Outro]
(YEAH) Aiyyo, 9th man, me and MURS we was in the Circuit City the other day, man..
An, and-and then took me back to the barbershop
Cause I ask ya boy, I said "Yo man, is Chris-Chris {?} here today, man? He workin?
And y'know what this dude ttold me man?
You, you-you know what this dude TOLD me, 9th? (WHAT?!)
He was like, he was like, "Naw man, to-the-Cameras ain't here today" - EUH-HAH!!!
(CAM-RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!)
Chris to-the-CAMERAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!!
Bah! BAH! BAH! Shout-out to my man Jermaine
First cut..NIGGA! Nigga! Sorry Murs...[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Y'all looking like the same rappers shipped off the same assembly line
Want to be king of the jungle, you niggas is lying
You the best at dressing up is what you really implying
Swag, here today, gone the next week
Either stand for something or just stay sleep
What it is, most of y'all prefer to stay sheep
Following the follower, the future looks bleak
Shout out to M. Eazy
The most known unknown can't see the
Bottom line or even the in-between's
Until it's all done, my nigga, I'm talking Queens
Things is uneasy when you switching up the scenes
Better stay inside that fence where the Astro Turf's green
Yeah, this is what they call boom-bap
Where they try to figure out what's in that backpack
Gold chains like I'm bringing Slick Rick back
No aim, extra clips for that black Mac
Neither, one time for the believers
Who wonder why my name ain't burning up, catching fevers
It's better than being mourned by the grievers
We on our 'Pac and Dre shit, they can't see us
I'm in all black and brown, the provider of the sound
Niggas reign and we never been crowned

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh and (Teddy Pendergrass sample)]
(Turn off the lights)
And light a candle
God gave you just enough for you to handle
(Turn off the lights)
I understand, oh
Niggas try to put a trophy on their mantle
(Turn off the lights)
And light a candle
God gave you just enough for you to handle
(Turn off the lights)
I understand, oh
Niggas need role models, here's a sample
(Turn 'em off!)

[Verse 2: Marv Won]
Killers, you rappers is so flaky
Nigga, you can love or hate me, it won't break me
Don't respect what you build and your foundation's shaky
Outfit ain't worth a penny and that's word to Jay Z
So, go on ahead and retell them lies
How your man got butter and he's sell the pies
Keep talking, nigga, yeah, detail the prize
I need to see dough for the biscuit, heat, swell and rise
Bang, like Amar'e, dang, the story changed
Niggas was big shots until Robert Horry came
Now they Corey Haim's
Look, nigga, either you gonna shit or get off the pot, it's seems poorly trained
Captain Vest Sparrow, I'm running a tight ship
25/8, ain't no day or no night shift
I want a pretty girl with a mouth just like a vice grip
You ain't never seen 2 fat niggas like this

[Hook]Keepin' it real
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
I let the words magnetize me
Nothing surprises me
This is more than a friendly little rivalry
No games nigga even though that's what they called
Trying to make a summer in the middle of the fall
Trying to save a dollar, fuck burning down the mall
Your career's like a car
You praying it don't stall in the morning when you crank it
No plan b's, no security blanket
Failure not an option
I worked 30 years on this lifelong doctrine
Burnt a few careers the public they adopted
Comes the original, no religion per say
But me I'm kind of spiritual, recognize the higher power
This is more than me bragging dog
Rap's a headache, this is more like the Tylenol
And this here is my vision
(Keeping it real)
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition

Beats make me falling asleep, I keep falling

So I run it back like I'm Earl Campbell
Walter Payton got you egg kids in a scramble
Do damage leave competition in shambles
Flame burning like an everlasting lit candle
I'm nice until the moment I retire
These words will inspire the rest of ya'll to think twice
I admit I'm your supplier
I'm trying to take you higher
Be dope, that's my good advice

(Beats make me falling asleep, I keep falling)

[Verse 2: Mikkey Halsted]
Big Pooh let me hold the track
That's a dead end, something like a cul-de-sac
Never been that hard to find, I'm probably where your ho is at
This rap game's a minstrel show, little brother showed you that
Stay with the poker face, go ahead play your cards
I see you little 16s then I raise the bar
Suckers shuck and jive and smiling for a living
(Keeping it real)
Others such as myself is trying to carry on tradition

(Beats make me falling asleep, I keep falling)

From where we can't afford to sleep, that's why we never dream
And I'm envisioning some shit that ya'll ain't never seen
The track's the match, the words I write are like the kerosene
The mic's the cotton-filled bottle that quickly blows the seam
It's time to get up off the sidelines and pick a team
Either the Wrong City Devils or the Elohims
I'm in the belly trying to duck the places made for crooks
Smoke like the Ethiopians blowing on the ancient kush
I'm trying to get up off the corner
Searching for the lime like I opened a Corona
Niggas ain't hard G, they sweet as Arizona tea
Never fuck with John McCain but how does Arizona see
Yeah, I'm Ernie Barnes mixed with Van Gogh
Monopolize the game, pay me when you pass Go
Suckers shuck and jive and smiling for a living
(Keeping it real)
Others such as myself is trying to carry on tradition
And it's like that[V-Stylez]
MoSS, I'm..
The wrong type of cat, gritty nigga and I'm evil
Out for the presents, sneaky dude, call me Smeagol
Lord of the ring and when the bell go "ding"
Jabs looking very sharp, punches hard and clean
You never land, I'm too elusive for your amateur game
Spit it well, you didn't know? You better check my name
V-Style, get it right and I rep the D
Where everybody hood hard, yo I just emcee
It don't matter if you big or tall or who the shortest
Just show me where the challenge is at, call your florist
Cause I'mma John Wayne on your ass, that's true grit
Talk slick and I would damage your top, wig split
D-X on muh'fuckers, silly dudes can +Suck It!+
Take my twins from my waste, blast my Kirby Pucketts
Yo my brain propane, gas turn into flame
Straight fire when ignited, break you down to the grain

[Royce Da 5'9"]
G shit, we sick, we spit, fuck you
Pay me, fuck all that free shit, eat dick
Crew shining like shit, we split, she strip
We tip, blue diamonds got mammy all seasick
Now take a brief sit, here's a handkerchief tip
While I fall on the floor, 'nuff money for a cheap trip
Huh, bitch, now who I'm finna leave with?
Find a friend and come, who you wanna get on your knees with?
My jewellery sick, I got a disease on my wrist
My neck and the shit's making me freeze bit
Breeze in with my Angela Jolie bitch
She lick my underarms, you can call me B. Pitt
Any problems nigga, we fix, my bitch
Will hit you, be like boiling water nigga, she slick
That's a trip saying he slip
Always on point like a Christmas tree tip
Creep up and eat clips

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Aiyyo, I know you like how Rapper C is waiting
Cause D niggas recognize thee nigga waiting
Rapper remain patient, took jabs like a champ now
Every verse out need the Rapper Pooh stamp
I tramp on foes, face down for them hoes
Pity the fool, any fool likely to oppose
See right through them clothes and your real nigga pose
Real niggas won't say a word, case closed
Blessed with the pen game, take aim
Maimed your career off of this strain, the disdain
All on your face mayne, it's plain with no competition
Me and you in the same breath, don't mention
This is my position right now in the future
Sewing up careers like some well-done sutures
These are maneuvers, up the ladder I ascend
Clash of the titans, nigga fuck a new trend

[Elzhi]
This nigga biting while I'm thinking, writing, to get the ink ignited
So when he move it's like a streak of lightning
Fuck where the crowns at, this brown cat could leave the town flat
And beat you like the part of the speaker you pump the sound at
I'm not stopping the slot topping, so when I plot
Dropping something hot, you copped it, it got popped in
Vultures better duck, flows with lead is tucking
Expose the feather ducking, blows your head to chunks
Rip flyer before I dip, be quick, hip fire
Slip by you a line that goes off like a trip wire
I'm from the sickest city, your whole clique is kiddy
If your chick is pretty, she'll suck a dick, I'll lick the titties
Your type of rhyming got me bored but I'm a star
The kind that you found where the comics are, knock you off your feet
Fussing, I eat dozen, I move the streets, trusting
In some sweet crushing petite Russians, skeet bussing
Screaming like they bout to meet Justin
Timberlake, I tremor quakes, hemmers shake
I'm the one with the gems and cake
Extra smokes and skinny dips like naked folks in swimming lakes

[Phat Kat]
Around the world my fans know me for the flows I bust
The Polo I rock and hoes I crushed
And the sound of my voice turn haters to dust
But still making funky music is a must
The newest star in Catacombs giving haters the flux
I switched it, bounced it, upgrade to super-deluxe
My whole crew is dangerous, ain't no taming us
The fast get wound on point, the finger's blaming us
Simply, oh, oh, it's the year of the emcee
We're here to fill the void, the game been running on empty
Had a long day nigga so please don't tempt me
Cooked so much beef but my name ain't Wimpy
Bout to snatch all your customs, your bag's too skimpy
And my shit sound fresh when this the voice in this empty
Tongue's so sharp, I chop you niggas down to mincemeat
So fuck your money, jewels and cars, using it as camouflage
Need to focus on planning the strength in your bars
It's Phat Kat the living legend, still counting my funds
Because I never kissed no ass, I stuck to my guns
While you're still coming up short, Kat holding the fort
Dedicate this to my fans, thanks for all your support
Yeah, this cold steel bitches, it's how we do it and it's real bitches
Yeah, it's Ronnie Kat

[V-Stylez]
Yeah, it's your man V-Stylez
Royce 5'9", Phat Kat and Elzhi
The Rapper Big Pooh from Little Brother
And MoSS on the beat bringing the heat
It's Hip Hop, non-stop[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Hook: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Deals, round 'em up
Bills, count 'em up
Need a V12 coupe with a broad that's down as fuck
Met up with this money then fell in love
Playin' this game, stay in your lane
Ain't no traffic when you does
Ain't gon' happen just because
And that's when anything it's gon' take passion, it's gon' take love
But you got actions just don't budge
But I just make this magic with these words
And I take all this cabbage and just splurge

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
All my habits gettin' worse
For instance, all the cars that catch my interest cost at least two hundred thousand
Is it worth it? Tough question
I never consider, I just be flexin'
Some days I drink champagne for breakfast
And what's the point of time, we live blind with a death wish
Came for a circle, now the story is the message
We all want success but most of us is success-less
We all know the game but most of us don't respect it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: GQ]
Before the music, I was dreamin' of sneaker deals
I know they listen when the seats is filled
Still, the night glitter, early morning we chief until
We leaving, printed on it like when tequila spills
Black bottles, lifestyle attract models
A tough act to follow, livin' a black novel
Who the fuck are you? Complimented attitude
Paintin' my city when I'm passing by them avenues
Don't wanna wake up, dream got me up in a coma
Wine bottles and women that age like [Wilona?]
The talk changed, remember face but lost names
I'm still fishin' like card games, cup fizzin'
Reality shots, I'm just drinkin' for confirmation
I got 'em witnessin' my operation
On this, [slickin'?] like Audis get, tropic as Maui trips
Me and my nigga Nipsey on some Cali shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rapper Big Pooh]
I like my 5's on top of 10's, 10's on top of 20's
50's 100's are better, standin' out like a Coogee sweater
Clear sky, sandy beach, women and warm weather
A brainstorm, I hope you brought umbrellas
I'm tired of broke niggas fakin' it
Cause most'll never make it to
Be the caricature of the character they idolizin'
It's like a spreadsheet I'm itemizing
Separatin' the real from what's not
Results are so surprising -- I need Maury
Was in it for the glory
Til I seen [Denzel?] gettin' whipped for that home cookin'
Fell in love when I wasn't lookin'
Write it myself so I'm not mistaken
Bought a Lex with my first big cheque just to show I had the bacon
Money ain't a thing girl, what's shakin'?
My ego probly, I'm in the lobby
Thinking bout this hobby, and how them dream killas tryna rob me
I just wanna be great like Ali, or feared like Tyson
But niggas make it hard when they bitin'
So I pen these letters to enlighten
Fear I'm excitin'
Get in an elevator with a white women, she frightened
As I stand with a smile on my face
She got her hand in her purse ready to introduce mace
While you over there lookin' at me
I'm lookin' at buying a place so count 'em up[Consequence]
Yeah, you break artists, look, they crying broke
Career in the garbage, they decided to croak
I guess my assignment now is just to poke
At the sleeping giant until he's awoke
I can take the slingshot and make these heat rocks
Hit 'em between the eyes until this bad dream stops
To be at the top the price ain't cheap
I pay DJ's, they still send me drop sheets
I drop heat and you can blame it on my past
Why I only work for currency now like Damon Dash
Forget being mad I can tell they pissed off
That I became like Jermaine when
He would rhyme with Kriss Kross
Da Brat and Xscape and whoever else
He had signed but made wait
That's the old bait and switch
The bullshit you go through to get rich
And that's the reason why Tyson hit Mitch
Right in front of Dapper Dan before
He got the chance to stitch
Up a new outfit, there ain't an outfit
That I can't out spit, cause they don't rap about shit
So take these words home and think 'em through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

[Hook:]
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
So you can quit crying BROKE

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Today is the first of the rest of your life
Cause you refuse to write on paper, that don't make you nice
Windex on your chain. that don't make that ice
Lil' niggas wanting fame, this a sacrifice
Plenty rappers getting signed, spending time on the shelf
It's a flaw in the design, learn you rhyme for yaself
Dusty records ain't classics, most people plastic
But fans ain't plastic, they more like metal
Refuse to play the end of ya strings, no Geppettos
Men with ho tendencies, your Jordans are stilettos
Drum and bass flow, your soul is so cello
Sugar free jell-o, I will never settle for less than what I deserve
Youngins got nerve, think they story gonna be different
Be on the same train, different cars, nigga listen
The game is full of sheep, and wolves attack herds
Cause you already sleep

[Hook:]
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
So you can quit crying BROKE

[Elzhi]
You rather see me cryin broke, die and croak
We gettin high and smoke
Off the water with Hawaiian folk
You funny and ain't even try and joke
Because I got the right dollars
To move next to white collars who be buyin coke
But last year was different
I felt my knees buckle that's when I
Got on my knuckles like the apes inside the jungles
Up in Africa, imagine feelin like the reaper's after ya
Tax man taking half of the pie, only to suck you dry
Like he Dracula
It made my spine tense
It's all due to this record label nonsense
But I've been fine since, I got back up on my feet
Spittin heat with the Cons-Quence
And only because I plan on running and I'm far from stressed
You'd rather see me with my car possessed
And my mansion haunted
And I was terribly deprived
The moment they try to bury me alive
I barely survived, now I'm here

[Hook:]
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
So you can quit crying BROKE[Intro]
To anybody
That ever looked at a blank piece of paper
And felt that feeling
That you didn't, you don't know what to say
You be wondering
If your next joint is gonna be banging or not
You be wondering if people gonna be feeling your shit
This is for y'all
Come On

[Verse 1]
I've been stuck on the same page
Seven days isolated in the same cage
Six minutes spitting out curse words of rage
Holding on to my pen like it's the last days
And she my only weapon
Still stepping with a passionate cause
But the block reveals all of your flaws hoping you give in
Shifting, more swift than the panic
Older brain with the pen feeling so diplomatic
Until you fight back
Pen strokes tend to quiet that and at the same time my mind drift
Between the pen and the paper there's a slight rift
The pressure's on and I might miss
Who can bare that stress?
First start is the second guess
The third try I'm still hopeless
I'm like a penny with a hole in it
The words come but no soul in it
So it's back to the block trying to figure out this damn thing

[Hook]
So if you see me in the lab with a pen and a pad
I'm trying to write a verse that's doper than my last one
Let's put it down for my peeps going at it hard
On every block, every corner, every boulevard
Some niggas think about sex, I think about checks
And I ain't spitting 16 until I know I'm about to cash one
Let's spit a rhyme for the streets steady pulling cards
On every block, every corner, every boulevard

[Verse 2]
They say the pressure's on to make more music
And write a better song to make the hoars loose it
Dance floor music with out no heart attatched
For all them harder cats that I was sleeping on
Not trying to lead you on but there's a deeper zone
When you start dealing with the industry and keeping on
You do your thing, I do mine
Fuck it, 10 inches long
Cause I ain't even on but still you want to sweat
Looking for me to fill your pockets and your deficits
Asking for loot and I ain't even sold no records yet
My family argue when they beefing over petty shit
And niggas still think this journey was everless
Shit
Yo, that's why I'm using God as my guide
Cause making moves in this game
It's kind of hard to decide
Once you put your Hancock on the line
My niggas change at the drop of a dime
That put a block on your mind, for real

[Hook]
So if you see me in the streets and my eyes look red
It's probably because I ain't been able to sleep
We put it down for our peeps going at it hard
On every block, every corner, every boulevard
Some niggas spit for the range
I spit for the change to make sure that all my family got something to eat
Spit a rhyme for the street steady pullin cards
For every block, every corner, every boulevard

[Outro]
Yo, it's like that y'all
State to state
Country to country
It's Little Brother
9th Wonder
The Justus League, undiscovered
It's like that y'all
We keep it going
We keep it on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on
Like that

[Outro scene]
Pooh
Oh Pooh
Wake up big daddy
Look at you
Laying there looking all cute and cuddly
(Different lady)
Good morning baby
You remember.. we agreed on that minajee(sp?)
Well, I got something better than that
I brought Tasha
(First lady)
Pooh
Oh Pooh
(Third lady)
Terrance!
Yeah, come on
(Man's voice)
WAKE UP, WAKE UP, WAKE UP[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Pushers and politicians often move with the same rhythm
You speak of government, my thoughts are cynical
So, while we're focused on the pinnacle
They getting paid off everything they label criminal
They not overturning then sentences, pouring in remembrance
Dream of Americana, no 'semblance to what they know
Liquor in the cup watching curbs grow
My man gave me 2, he's trying to stack 4
See plenty dough, like a pizza shop
Got preachers buying jets, stealing from their flock
Pop, pop, lost innocence
Pouring in remembrance
Praying for us sinners, no difference between the two
Fountain of youth for the chosen few
Want to control the population, poisoning the food
We got money for wars, can't feed the poor
2pac was on to something, maybe more but we'll never know

[Hook]
Eyes wide open, Lord, and I can't see
This is for the people, right?
Eyes wide open, Lord, and I can't see
Wonder how they sleep at night
Eyes wide open, Lord, and I can't see
But it's for the people, right?
Eyes wide open, Lord, and I can't see

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
I'm spitting Alex Jones with immortal technique
Infowars [?] from the sheikhs
Love's going to get you, manipulate the feature though
Barack should have brought your ass home a week ago
Love decided by the color of skin
Love subverted by the need to fit in
Society, why are we watching CNN
The White House put me back to sleep again
Hatred killed another unarmed black
Hard to land on my feet like a one-armed cat
We dying, Mr. President, you're lying, Mr. President
If Heaven got a hot spot, you're frying, Mr. President
Democrat, Republican, push the same agenda
Global euthanasia by United Nation members
Insomniac, don't be mad at me
I see the knife, put your hands where my eyes can see
Wide open

[Hook][Verse One] [Big Pooh]
Since '07 I said, "Fuck being famous"
I'm still gon' make sure you know what my name is
Still gon' make sure you see where my lane is
Seven years later and I still know what pain is
Obama president, we waitin' on them changes
We broke up cause niggas ain't the same kids
Left Atlantic cause we ain't in the same biz
Neo fights lookin' like he what insane is
Shit, you don't even know the half
Motherfuckas actin' like I didn't take math
Puttin' up walls, tryin' to block my path
No matter what they do, can't stop my laugh
A best friend chose to go and cross my path
Cool ass nigga, no need for the wrath
I'm a good guy and I refuse to finish last
Most people puttin' out music now trash
Any instrumental that you got I'll smash
Claim to be a Titan when you don't wanna Clash
Ask S1 about Pooh, I mash
Got a girl head in my lap, that's class
All that bullshit that you spread, I'll pass
People go nuts when they ego get gassed
On that bitch shit, move your neck with sass
On that Cher shit, walk around with a Mask
Joe I need some more Jack D in my flask
MC Eiht niggas, +All 4 The Cash+

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Oh no it can't be
Hall Of Justus is the family
We had it with you niggas comin' 'round talkin' free
Reservoir Dogs, pretty soon you'll see

[Verse Two] [Chaundon]
Chaundon's outta here, my career's goin' into orbit
Flow's Rasputia, y'all niggas in Norbit
Came into the game, made 'em forfeit
Hit 'em with more shit
Lyrically I carry the torches
Any broad I'm fuckin' is gorgeous
I make 'em all deep throat with no hands, I call it the cordless
Tryin' to get my hands on some Grants/grands like Horace
Flows on fire, I will burn down your forest
Every verse kick like Chuck Norris
Hooked on every one of my words, my shit will never need a chorus
Pontiac niggas goin' at a team of Porsches
Fast and furious, my track record flawless
Give it up before I get it on, cut your losses
Middle management niggas, you know who the boss is
Y'all niggas ain't nothin' but monkeys on porches
Al Green ya chest, what I spit, scorches
I keep on raisin' the bar and you're a novice
All of y'all are Roc Emerson, that mean you garbage
Run up in the street with the heat, make 'em nauseous
You girl want sex for breakfast, I feed her sausage
Bon appetit then I skeet on the porridge

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Oh no it can't be
Hall Of Justus is the family
We had it with you niggas comin' 'round talkin' free
Reservoir Dogs, pretty soon you'll see

[Verse Three] [Joe Scudda]
As I proceed to keep flossin'
Share my speed and use caution
Give 'em what they want cause really what they need
If for me to be nothin' less than awesome
H.O.J.'s the enterprise
So anything other than us is uncivilized
Uncontrollable
And in my lane, is such a disdain for anything not a quotable
So anythang you hear from Joe is notable
It's the best shit you heard in a lifetime
My flow's the price of oil
Takin' a toll, so you can say H.O.J.'s the pipeline
You can say it, Joe Scudda's a mack
In fact you can say anything other than wack
Cause I ain't ever been that
No I will never see it
And anybody sayin' they saw it, we don't believe it
I don't have to repeat it
Put it simple and plain, I'm the best
Did it for the love of the game
Uh, I did it once than I did it again
Did it for the fans, I did it for the fame
It's the H.O.J

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Oh no it can't be
Hall Of Justus is the family
We had it with you niggas comin' 'round talkin' free
Reservoir Dogs, pretty soon you'll see

[Verse Four] [Jozeemo]
Yeah, I got blindsided but I post right back up
I went the thug route, tool's out, bitch back up
I'm an Eastwood gang member, not a Blood, not a Crip
Tommy Gun buster, hold up that's a drum, not a clip
Niggas can't drink with me, not a drop, not a sip
But I'll get you smoked out, Rutger 9, llama fifth
Plus I got the drama kit
Magazine and hollow tips
President Barack, he should surround you with the politics
First you got the congress
Those be the old heads
House of Representatives
Niggas who won't wear red
The Senate get money
But any means necessary
They the reason the recession gon' be legendary
It's kinda scary when you think about it
Sharp shooter take your chain, blow a link up out it
Take your dream, make you blink about it
You need your mouth, you can't drink without it
Shut it before I get mad with you
Punchin' niggas so hard, break my hand grissle
I'm doin' you a favor by lettin' my man twist you
I was all cool, y'all made it a damn issue
You really wanna take it to pistols? What is you loco?
Or is you snitchin', workin' undercover for the po-po?
Put this nigga in a choke hold

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Oh no it can't be
Hall Of Justus is the family
We had it with you niggas comin' 'round talkin' free
Reservoir Dogs, pretty soon you'll see[Intro]

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
We were best friends
At least that's what I thought
Then you had to go and rip out my fucking heart
I admit I fell in love
From the very start
I never imagined a moment where we would be apart
I know what you're thinking
"damn you really bugging"
But I supported you when the world said you was nothing
There in the beginning to this unhappy ending
I figured it was I time I can finally stop pretending
You did the unthinkable
It's no turning back
And that's exactly where you left the blade at
This is not a disagreement
It's more lack of trust
I should have had in you
That you had in us
So here we both probably thinking about the past
"could I have done more to help this thing that we had"
Maybe
That's just silly me being crazy
I'm never gonna fuck with you again
It's over

[Hook]
I said they don't love you they know how to pretend
And these are the people who call themselves friends

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
I can't front
It's funny how life do
Cause in the beginning I said things just spite you
Took a few shots out but now I really like who you choose to become
When most people run
They had you boxed in
And I ain't going to sit here and pretend to even know what the talk did to you
Scars on the ego
Tend to be wounds that never heal and if they do slow
Whats your motivation
What keeps you coming back
How you keep pushing when niggas turn they backs
I'm getting pissed for you but you looking so relaxed
If it's chinks in your armor you refuse to show cracks
Many claim to have the medicine
But most of them are quacks
I ain't one to judge but most them niggas wack
What you think about them
I wish nothing but the best
Keep doing you
Motherfuck the rest

[Hook][Verse 1]
I think my pressure boiling from all the shit that's spoiling
Uh, I once was on it but now my head's enormous
Uh, your shit was boring, my art is fast and forming
Creativity is what you lack in your performance
You see the crowd nigga? Microphone checker
Mr. Home Wrecker, give me hard liquor
Let the blunt flicker, you see my style evolve
Reservoir Dogs and we some Hannibals
If I would catalog, feeling phenomenon
I'm after the Parmesan, while gripping my fire arm
Bang, he lost an arm, bang, he writing nothing
Nigga you wasting time, I'm wasted, past the line, I'm hard
My nig, you whine, you broke, my nig, you lying, you owe
You buying dimes, look my nig, we know the signs
But quick to speak our minds, fronting like you balling man
I couldn't tell, Hell, smoking more than what your dealer sell
Huh, super fail, super duper fail
Listen to the Schoolboy, my mic can teach you well, Hell
Hah, left him at a pit stop
Top Dawg, mothafuck your hip hop

[Hook]
Mothafuck your hip hop
Mothafuck your hip hop
You ain't gotta cop it when my shit drop?
Mothafuck your hip hop

[Verse 2: Big Pooh]
They don't wanna see you shine, they don't wanna see you grow
They don't wanna see you sign on that line and get doe
Wanna keep you in they pocket, I fire like a rocket
I'm tryna blow up, like sticking forks in the socket
I did it for the love, I do it for the art
Now how am I supposed to write these 16's in the dark?
My car's on park, I can't eat skills
And props ain't gon' pay all these mothafuckin' bills
I can keep it real and get paid at the same time
Money in my pocket won't reflect on my next line
Next rhyme, next date, showing off my chest plate
Belly big, looking all full, cause I just ate
Know some shit been going wrong if I lost weight
Ain't about the doe, but I need it now, won't wait
Can't stop, won't stop, not even a drip drop
Say what you want but mothafuck your hip hop

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
They say, "Murs why you put Dogg Pound on Paid Dues and shit?
Must have gone mainstream, sold out losing it"
Niggas that's been underground for years and ain't doing shit
My homies ain't no B-boys fool, all they do is Crip
Keep on talking shit and they gon' sock you in the lip
And you gon' do is get mad and try to sue a pimp
Then I'm spending loot on a lawyer that's ludicrous
Cashing out my street cred for you? Man, I'm through with this
I'm a changed man, that's the only reason you exist
If this was '96 we would have caught you in a twist
The little homies busting at you out the Bronco
Peel your cap ten kick back at the compost
Large orange bang and a bomb plate of nachos
Biter broke nigga, quit hating, keep your mouth closed
Rapping 30 years, you still ain't this hot
Shut your ass up nigga, mothafuck your hip hop

[Hook][Produced by: Statik Selektah]

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
At my ring fittin, feelin like my ring different
My hands grew from the last time they was ring dishin
They made mine but they stunted on the ring givin
So now I'm taxin the jeweler like "where the ring sittin?"
If all's movin and tell 'em that I'm beyond movin
I'm all through it, I told 'em that I don't part two it
It's one shot like take it or leave it
The advantage is off top, it's like breakin a ceiling
I handle it off top, both hands on rightfully
They say I achieve too much for them to hype for me
Did it on my own, so yeah I got the right to be
Half of my inbox starts with "can you write for me?"
Huh, so as far as your speakish fam
We not neighbors but I can give your speech a hand
I told 'em, I obsoleted the ones you believed in
And did it on Posturepedics but you thought I was sleepin
Still dozin

[Hook: Lee Wilson]
Streets keep callin me now, tryin to make me act out
I'm tryin to stay on my nine to five, so one day I can get out
Get out, of everything that keeps tryin to bring me down, yeee-eah

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
I ain't your favorite but the one you like, been a fan
If I sayin I'm the shit then I rightfully am
I write for the yams, a man with no face
In public, I stand, the fans give no chase
Just because I'm public, some fans, get out of place
This is my world, you privileged to get a taste
Or a sample
Dudes get mad when they say that I trampled
Their dreams with no comments, my commentary'll shape the nation of you
You talkin 'bout life and them things that you been through
I've been through the wire
Now I aspire, to take my game higher
Than I ever been, niggas, crabby I'm ahead of them
You either swim with the sharks or bail out when you see the fin
There's no mistakin when you see the grin
You still sleepin, here's the beast that I held within
Stop dozin

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Torae]
Yeah, uh, yo, I tell niggas that I'll sleep when I'm dead
A lot of y'all snoozin, spend weeks in the bed
They say they never heard of a speech from the kid, unfamilarity
So I clarify anywhere you need clarity
Every form of media for music affairs
Had a write up, a post or a feature of his
So if you really involved from the streets to the blogs
You'll be familiar with the God
Nigga my pen is more potent, my dots is more doper
Than the stage presence, the style's what got 'em all open
I might even be the future is what they all hopin
But my mission in music, to make it more focused
Soon as the boy wrote it, they quote it, take notice
They know they fittin to be outta they job in a moment
Niggas is well bogus
Anything I write, ignite the high, hopeless, how is y'all dozin?

[Break: Lee Wilson]  (x2)
I'm really tryin to walk the line
Straight into a new life
Streets keep callin me, they still need me
For me they still provide
What am I to do?
What would you do if you were standin in my shoes?

Yeeeaaaah

[Hook:]Before I can enjoy breakfast i pray to the Lord
That I step in the right direction
Helpless in the face of destiny,
You ain’t what you try to be
My epiphany is sky, honestly
See, He is me, so He I see
And you can't see defeat when your B.I.G
So everything I said, you know I D.I.D
Go way beyond me when I D.I.E
I’m God sent, don’t you hear them trumpets?
Ladies get stump when they step on my sub conference
Even when the vultures start circling, thought that I was over
Than came back, repented my sins, I forgive them
I don’t even seek vengeance, fuck them, burn bridges, I’m back, bitches!
Listen sisters dirty district we back top trending
It’s hard time, our spot, god will it
More women, more shows, top bill it
And I’m a take it to the start, that’s the beginning
Go
Things change as you start to get older
Begin to see
Clear as you get a lil sober
Took a little time but
Im finally getting over
Stressing bout shit that i had
No control over
Niggas dont like me
Because of the music i was making
Peter dont like me
Cuz they saw me eating bacon
Women getting mad talking
Bout i keep faking
And even some of the homies
Get caught perpetrating
Never in my corner to begin with
Critics talking bout he getting better
Naw im still certain
Teacher used to tell
My mom thomas ain't gonna make it
Im'a stop waiting for prove a nigga im'a take it
Niggas[Hook]
Listen girl I wanna take you home
Listen girl I wanna take you home
What's your phone number?
I wanna take you home
Matter of fact, I wanna bring you home
What's your phone number?
I wanna bring you home
Listen girl I wanna bring you home
I need your phone number
Can I bring you home?
I wanna bring you home
What's your phone number?

[Verse 1]
It's written all over your face
You don't have to say a word
But of course you can
I know we just e-met, I'm tryna be your man
I'm sayin', cause girl I dig your look
And against better judgment, fuck the rest of the book
What a cover, I wanna be your lover, babe
You said you like Prince, right?
Long walks under moonlight
You want a man to fuck you all night, right?
Strawberries, wine, and whipped cream
Blackberry come and be a part of my team
Matter fact, check it out, what's your phone number?
What's your Skype name? You ain't got a camera?
It's all good, let me hear what you talkin' 'bout
Girl sick, sight, voice, I'mma rub one out
So I checked on a plane ticket
The way my account set up, well, you don't wanna hear it
Yo, it's either train or bus
Somebody gotta travel, if it's gonna be an us
Oh, you're busy next month?
Oh, the next three months?

[Hook]
I'm tryin' to get you home
Baby girl I'm tryin' to get you home
Tryin' to get you, yeah
I'm tryin' to get you home
And I'm tired of talking over the phone
I'm tryin' to get you home
I'm tryin' to get you home
Nigga tired of talking over the phone
I need to get you home

[Bridge]
If you think you're lonely now
Then wait until tonight girl

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of playing this game
What the fuck you waiting on? We need to finally set a date
Only so much time I can patiently wait
If I ain't with you looking forward to right now then I ain't
Cause I ain't, gon' keep dragging this along
And I can't, play another sad song
And I won't, keep chasing you online
And I won't, so what we finna do, huh?

[Outro]
You best to get on that bus
Greyhound, Megabus
You better travel to see me
I wanna see you
I need you
I want you
Oh
You better jump on the Amtrak, baby
The airbus, cop you a ticket
Priceline
You best a-call William Shatner baby
And get your tickets for cheap
I want you[Rapper Big Pooh]
Uh, uh, punks jump up then get beat down
Turn that track up, bang my sound
Niggas ask why I walk around with a frown
Cause I ain't a muh'fuckin clown
Pay me in pounds, get bread, US fed
Love making heads turn off some shit I said
Code red, ring the alarm, standing in the eye of the storm
I exhibit miraculous calm
My miraculous charm keep me chilled with a dime at my arm
Thoroughbred like I'm running a farm
Who fucking with I? Who want it with him?
I bring it to your crew, then your next of kin
Hall of J. run tight like we Mexicans
On the search for the Wiz like you made of tin
Roc C is on, Chaundon is nice
Rapper Pooh bout to make niggas pay the price

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh] + (Chaundon)
If you're rocking with the homie Big Pooh
And the whole Hall of Justus crew
If you're rocking with the homie Roc C
Or my West coast family
If you're rocking with my man Chaundon
The Back Twist got it going on
To everybody, put your hands up (hands up)
Now everybody get your hands up (hands up)

[Roc C]
My reality penitentiary casualties, protect my family
Never live in the fantasies, Mister Ceremony
Prepare for the testimony, known for having weapons on me
Women call him Macaroni, Pooh we'll try to tell 'em homie
Home known as Killa Cali, listen to Makaveli
Dead bodies in the alley, never dumb down
Come round get gunned down
Still Hip Hop but you still get shot
Roc not your average individual
More of a criminal, don't speak subliminals
Disco ball fall down on your physical
Condition critical, maximize, never minimal
A soldier to a general is like fucking with Mike
When he was in his pinnacle
Puff medical, lyrical green visuals
Sensual seductors blow cock like that window do
Alpha Team get 'em or we'll get the other half of you

[Hook]

[Chaundon]
Aiyyo, I am that nigga, make niggas sick
White chicks love me and my big nigga dick
Chaundon the Back Twist, hoes know the moniker
Money, power and respect's what I rock it for
No need to rehearse, y'all niggas is wack
You should all Auto-Tune your verse
Step back little dude, listen
If you ain't getting money now then you not professional
I do this on the regular
You are like A-cup titties fronting like you bigger in a Wonderbra
Damn y'all, is this where it's going?
If wack's the new nice then I need to stop flowing
Cause I can turn the radio on and randomly pick
Ten rappers on the playlist who ain't shit
Huh, and I don't care about none of your Grammies
You main scale, you be dealing with trannies

[Hook][Hook: Darien Brockington]
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
So happy

[Phonte]
Aiyyo man, I don't ask for much
I just wanna chill at home and sip my drink out of my plastic cups
Even though my roommate have me mad as fuck
Nigga be acting crackish, fucking up my money hustling backwards
Financially I took some hard blows
But shit I also rocked some hard shows
Niggas came to check us out by the carloads
Screaming my name like I scanned a million barcodes already
My squad flows till we all sweaty
We struggling to pay our bills so we really can't ball heavy
And God knows I be calling on him
Cause I be writing mad cheques that might as well have Spalding on 'em
The shoulders of my team, I be falling on 'em
Providing support that help the pain go away
And helping me to see the light like Towa Tei standing by me
That's all I really need to satisfy me
It's just my peeps y'all, for real

[Hook: Darien Brockington with Phonte]
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
Aiyyo, it's real easy to see
Don't take much to please a cat like me, that's how we doing it
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
Uh uh, now bring it back
So happy

[Rapper Big Pooh]
There's been nights I wanted to quit, broke, crying to God
It's kinda hard going far with a lot to carry
Waking up still tired from sessions
Going to class, dozing off, waking up, never learning the lessons
But thanks to my faith and blessing
Struggles pass and I go about life without half the stressing
I know who got my back, no need for raising the question
Cause when times get hard, it's to my brothers I call
Taking the weight, no matter large or small
I smile everyday, thanks to y'all, we gonna eat for real
Ease the mind so we can sleep for real
It took longer than we wished but the blow meant I knew we could
Find the best way to live life, it's so right
We jail tight, ain't no strip stopping our move
We one nation all under a groove
Sending peace to that cat Nicolay, we gonna meet real soon
I'm so happy

[Hook: Darien Brockington with Rapper Big Pooh & Phonte]
Good people, good loving
Good music in my life, it makes me happy
Uh, we doing this for y'all

Good people, good loving

[Phonte]
Feel me, like this yo and this how we doing it

For my man Big Dho and Chaundon, let's get it going y'all

[Hook X2: Darien Brockington with Phonte]

[Phonte]
You wanna know what I'm feeling for real? Start that shitSee, you'll always be a part of me
I'll be good for you, wait and see...

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
My mama told me Thomas you should keep fighting
The words that I heard is you should keep writing
Blank stare out the window, watching a plastic bag go exactly as the wind blow
Steady is the tempo, these people think it's simple waking up every morning trying to figure out where time go
My thoughts ain't clear, how am I wind up here?
Now I'm drinking a beer, it's 10 o'clock in the a.m. me and my body swaying to the mayhem
People like it ain't him, staring at me like they looking at an evil twin
Half grin the only thing that I could muster, knowing at that exact moment my life was really flustered
My house flooded, career studded, me and my baby got our backs to the wall like it ain't nothing
Actually I'm breaking down though, my life's soundtrack the beautiful sounds of a piano
Played by a two year old, banging on the keys
Every night I'm on my knees asking God mercy please help me out
I know he hear my please without a doubt (ha)
Now it's time for me to get out, keep pushing
No cushion, hungrier than ever, I'm willing to grind forever
Fuck whether I'm the postman
The end of the night propose a toast fam
Trying to fake it til you make it, you dont understand

[Hook: Jared Evans]
I was never happy, but if you're here with me then we could sing a song
How ill would that be? If we could celebrate forever til we're gone
With (?) around me, is everything I need so let the candles go
(uh huh) happy birthday ya'll, happy birthday ya'll

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Parked the car I burned out out of second gear
Every year, I'm talking bout it's my year
On that 12th now, working on the 5th year
Trying to navigate the world, but its rocky here
No Adrians, No Apollo Creeds
I flipping soil for my future seeds
I'm tired of flipping soil and I don't own the deeds
If a snakes in your yard better cut the weeds
Preoccupied with want;s, can't afford your needs
And the teacher told me I wouldn't succeed (haha)
Can you hear me now? Margie's middle child making mama really proud
You can finally smile, tomorrow means a brighter day
Happy birthday ya'll, wipe your tears away

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Happy birthday ya'll, Happy birthday-birthday, yeah (3x)Yeah. Look

(Chorus)
Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

[Verse 1: Dee-1]
Yo. Yo. Yo
Press record, spit the heat, you know how we do it
Put this song on repeat, make a million to it
Sitting back, reminiscing bout the old days
Spent the whole day, reminiscing bout the old days
It's not a secret, we keep it G'r than y'all
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the realest of ‘em all?
Your reality ain't real, so you ain't real at all
You robbing Peter to pay Paul, you Ray Charles
Opposite of mission vision, intuition AWOL
Blind to reality, ya whole life a fallacy
Actually, these dudes too emotional for me
Don't email, or text me your frustrations my G
All that passive aggressiveness, ain't my style
Save the drama for ya mama dawg, you ain't my child
Look, there's no 'I' in team, that's why yo team blind
There's two eyes in mission that why this vision fine

(Chorus)
Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

[Verse 2: Dee-1]
Look
It started off in dorm room 309, now Dee-1 global
So come and look into the mind of a young mogul
Trying to do business fair in this frigid air
Cold world, heater broken, technicians rare
The hood need brain food, cause all the kitchen’s bare
Jordan’s is fly, but don’t die tryna get a pair
My heart bleeding on these beats, pass the Band-Aid
Matter fact cut the beat off, I don’t need no band aid
I act paid, cause I’m rich
But the currency ain’t man made
That’s why they trying to stop my shine, like a lamp shade
Believe I mean it, if I say it
When they hear me, they go to throwing them red flags
Cause in a instant, they replay it
When the people want it, haters are irrelevant
And you can’t overturn they call, cause you got inconclusive evidence
I can’t deny I’m blessed, that’s cause the heart of a warrior beats inside my chest
Yes. Yes. Yes

(Chorus)
Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

[Verse 3: Rapper Big Pooh]
Rapper!
Uhh! I got the heart of a lion
Praying on my downfall quit trying
Applying every lesson I was taught to every battle I had fought
Supplying me with nerves, like iron
Ice cold veins, the memory remains
When I would ask my mama, why don’t we have nice things
She told me I was fed, with the roof over head
Her most important duty, is to make sure I’m prepared
N's don’t play fair, they tend to change like the weather do
And leave behind in they absence, certain residues
Knock you off schedule, bullsh— perpetual
Then get uptight, when they think you got a better view
I just pulled ahead of you, with blinders on
While you use ya brawn, I’ma use my brain
Therefore I have changed
People believe whatever they gon’ believe
A king is how I should be perceived, Forever

(Chorus)
Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it
