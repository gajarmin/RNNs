[Hook: DVS]
Hold on tight to what you own, cos there's people like me outside your door
Hold on tight to what you own, cos there's people like me outside your door

[Verse 1: Orifice Vulgatron]
Step in the ring, blaze cats, slay bate twats
Make that train, wait back, spread an 8-track
Spitting out all kind of rhyme with the way that
Make any rapper wanna stop with the late chat
Nobody knows a nigga looking to bring by
You couldn't even rock a toe with a play back
Foreign beggar fam over run as I take that
Rap Montana, write my name by the train tracks
Kit Kat rappers get bucked and bitch slapped
Cut, black eye, some wanna play flip-flap?
Sit back up, chit chatter, where da check at?
Charge next man £10 for a Tic Tac
Spit down lyric quick fast when they say cash
Ship-wrecked rappers get bucked with a big bat
Kill any mini-man dick with a shit gat
Spill a man's guts with the face of a pick-axe
Woah? commin on a bit gotta get a (lick sharp?)
Quick fix, bitch, then did a bit of crack rock
Red-hot rapper, nigga nock about his spit right
Lock up any amatuer that wanna come shit talk
Ruba dub dub get dumped in the trunk
Armed with a mic and a big bag of punk
[?] run a muck and then I'll come
Make a hall stand up, fuck 'em up and to the back to the front
From my earliest pillaging and scheming with mad men
Bad men form all the way from Erith to Camden
Challenging any man dem who spit on a track
I never saw talkin' shit and get ready to lamp him
Big bad rappers get slapped up in tandem
Acting like dons but they're openly rampant
Jump up in the back of the car like he was strapped in
None of us panic, here I come with my fat pen

[Hook] x 2

[Verse 2: Skinnyman]
Blud, I ain't trying to prove nothing, move something
Too many man are left dead for nothing
Get battered up, whacked up, spurred for nothing
Beat down, hurt, or left murked for nothing blad
But thats just how tings were gwannin
When a man said hes a bad man from morning
Now wait till Sunday morning, his family's in church, dressed in black; mourning
Nobody had a chance to warn him coz he had just been
On stage performing and certain girl-dem had started to swarm him
And after that just sounds quite alarming
One brother said your a chief and yes you can
Tell that im looking beef coz i live around all the depression
On the streets [?] my main stress relief
Bust one, and in your belly
Bust one, and in your teeth
And heap on anyone I'm looking to eat
Cos any idiot could have drawn the gun back
Lick out the barrel and make the gun clap
Me I just step at the mic and I run checks
Give them the eye and I shall return in a comeback
Mr Vulga asked me to guest track
Instead of me telling the man dem to get flat
The manor that I'm living in, yes I rep that
Anything I want in life yes I get that
Disrespect me, get disrespect back
Are you really from the ends blad?
Forget that
Are you really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, from the ends blad?
Forget that
Are you really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, from the ends blad?
Forget that

[Hook x 2][Intro]
Talkin' 'bout the science of social deprivation
From 'ere to wherever in the council estates the man are strugglin'
The poor lower working class

[Verse 1]
Blud, you go to sleep round here and have nightmares
Wake up and find the worst reality is right there
The difference is, in my dreams I'm always runnin' scared
But in reality, on road, I'm comin' prepared
So now who's gonna wanna run up and become a goner?
Everybody's gonna wanna get us, but they're on a longers
I'm still out to get the same cats from last summer
But man can't see them again, it's like they've done a runner
I'm still in the same manor, on the same number
And everybody knows where I'm at and what I'm under
I'm in the same slums, raisin' the funds
In the city where the youth man are blazin' the guns
Just look how this United Kingdom has come
Within the council estates where man'll fight over crumbs
You got young single parent mums
Havin' the hardest time tryn'a survive for their daughters and their sons
Be comin' out their youths, cause their youths are left out there
Raised on the ways of these streets without care
Now we're havin' our fair share of gun warfare
And it's all gone nuts and that's just cause it's poor here
People want more here, we're all on the floor here
It's raw here, can't even sleep and ignore here
Cause life's kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothing's equivalent to this council estate of mind

[Hook]
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds

[Verse 2]
I live amongst smashed syringes
Squatters' doors hangin' off the hinges
Hookers lookin' money for Bobby, shottin' their minges
Leavin' used condoms out on the staircases
Next to the broken pipes that's left by the Base heads
Local estate heads, have grown up to hate Feds
Kids with no helmets drivin' round on some bait peds
Abandoned cars are at the bottom of the block
So when it's pissin' down, kids have got a place to plot
To cotch and blaze pot, and watch this whole spot
Full up of lost souls with no goals who get left to rot
And what, I don't expect you to ever comprehend is
Why I got all actin' so self defensive
The neighbourhood shotters have all seen what it's comin' to
Local coppers on patrol are boppin' with a gun too
So anyone could bun you, leave and desert you
How long they gonna mourn you when somebody merks you?
Tryin' not to get shift when shiftin' your work true
When you wanna shift there ain't nowhere to splurt to
The stakes are high, still the best get placed
Tryn'a find how sweet success might taste
In a place where everybody is tryin' to flex
Nobody's really gettin' anywhere, so everybody's vexed
Livin' life kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothin's equivalent to this council estate of mind

[Hook]
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds

[Verse 3]
So these are lyrics for my people, livin' on the streets who
Know they ain't got nuttin' else to retreat to
If you gettin' food next man'll wanna eat you
Pure, bad beefs just to get to delete you
So many man nowadays are so see-through
Beware of their deceitful ways when they greet you
Those who feel it know it because they've been through
Times when their friends wanna switch up to beat you
I never used to see it but, now I got a clear view
Don't let no bad minded heads try get near you
If they're not on your level they'll never hear you
Ain't no time to be shaken or fearful
If you've been through, some of this evil that we do
A hundred Hail Mary's ain't enough to redeem you
All of my long time friends are crack fiends
Who have gone too far, but still say they didn't mean to
Does alleviation through base and crack relieve you?
Everybody's losin' their mind, and even me too
Step into my world if you wanna catch a preview
But don't tell a soul, cause they just won't believe you
That life's kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothin's equivalent to this council estate of mind
Life's kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothin's equivalent to this council estate of mind

[Hook x2]
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds[Verse 1: Skinnyman]
...We both came from the city of Leeds
With all those wicked as theives
We halve the apple for the man to proceed
Now we, come to blaze it all across the map
We know where we're coming from so we know where it's at
It's Braintax and Skinnyman blazing a track
Biro Funk for all the rap junkies to pack in a sack

[Verse 2: Braintx]
First of all for all the heads who don't know by now
I'm gonna start from the top and break it all right down
My moniker is Braintax when I'm spitting on wax
Or when I'm making a track but when I'm sending a fax
I sign J Christie on a licence contract cos I'm on my own label
And it's called Low Life
Putting records in the shops since '92
A lot of people don't know and think this here's brand new
I gotta shout out Destiny from Catch A Groove days
For buying in my records trekking round in a haze
Through the West End, back then me and my best friend
But now Braintax is a one-man scheme
And all my friends contribute to this solo team
I know I mean what I say plus I know what I mean
Do you know what I mean? This is Biro Funk
And it feels like a giro and a henry of skunk
See I - got the beats from Harry Love I do shows with
And me and Mystro got flows and now you know mate
I've been rapping since the Toxteth riots
So you new jack, American-wannabees need to stay quiet
I'm mad at life cos I don't really wanna be here
My Benny Live track will make you see clear
Like The Grip - Jehst beat - politics, know the dark shit
Low Life is depth, dopeness we start shit and show paths
Not in it for the laughs
And looking after business though I still hate maths
But I love cash, every 20 note's a brick
In my house in the sun that's why I'm up at half 1
I swore to stop writing punchline nonsense
And now it takes longer but I penetrate your conscience
(Who's this?) No-one else sounds like Brains, you get me?
North plus South, and my mood? Well, it's tetchy

[Hook] {repeats}
"Everybody, everybody, everbody"
"C'mon"

[Braintax]
OK, we're just starting now
Stay with the Biro Funk
I gotta give shout outs to people on the album, made it what it is
And goes like this (Braintax) that's me
Harry Love hitting on with funky beats
(Mystro!) flows to make you feel complete
Skinnyman too for analysing my shit
On the cut shorty blitzen, the shit don't stink
I'm banging for that SP shit
(Like what?) and Benny Live with the different vibe
And Jehst, one of the best - a true scribe
I ??? for the funk life
Taskforce music from the corner this year
A Shepard's Bush traffic for my atmosphere

That's how we set it off
Braintax, the finest shit
One more time fore the weed heads at the back!
La da da da dat dat
La da da da dat dat...(Out of this room, out of this place, you know; back into the world
IT'S YOUR FUCKIN WORLD MATE, NOT MINE, YOU CAN STICK IT UP UR ARSE, I DON'T WAN' IT!)

Now you bin tru the worst years, jail for years
And had to come face 2 face with the worst of your fears
Seen blood shed and sweaty old soldiers shed tears
If you cudn't stand the bang up with the maddest, the brers
Let 'em hang up, slit your wrist, nobody cares
Did you ever feel that there was duppies round you every where?
Dats rite blud, Ru gna take your life blud?
Theres no beta place and tonites the nite blud
Before you tie your neck on that pipe blud
Jus pass all your tings out the window, and swing 'em to the right blud
Rite blud?
Fuckin wid dis ting called life blud
I've never bin the one whose ever bin the rowdy type blud
From I was a nut gettin bust, I had to fight blud
And I can't see myself tryna giv up on life blud
Not light blud
I really wana see the light blud
I mean I wana fix up, and make tings rite blud
Now I wana fix my life blud
I mean I wana make tings rite blud
And see dat light blud

(Well, those are your options, and you've created 'em, you've brought it all upon youself...
Before you kick another door down, or you kick another chef in the bollocks)Verse 1 (Chester P)
I'm sick of hearing people say how they got everything going bad for them
And how the world's against them and how the whole scene hates them
And how it's holding them back, boy you know what...
It weren't me
It weren't the task f.o.r.c.e
It weren't the Mud Fam, the Bury Cru or Mark B
So I run around town searching for clues
And all them people losing touch bredrens it's on you
I'm a drill a bray the Milky Way for trying to operate a scam
This is an expose resistance makes a stand
Who do you think we are some fly by night militia
Just take hold of your positions the storms about to start
And you ain't never gonna make this cos it ain't in your heart
You piss take and get taken over real sharp
I hope you followed the description of my story so far
Cos we ain't operating petty over wars and feuds
So at the end of the night bredren it's on you
It's on you bredren so what ya gonna do
Chorus
MC's it's on you
DJ's it's on you
And the man's making beats for their crews it's on you
It's on you

Verse 2 (Eno Red Rum)
For those who boost their skills with their clothes
For those who run stagnated rap flows
It's over when Eno screams Red Rum
The rhythm murderer smashing verbal rockers on drums
Practical production over flowing instruments
Desirable finales that remain your only influence
Ripped from my inputs your about to be buried
In the graveyard under moonlit cemetries
Your decision is to tearaway like delinquents
Put aside your insolance for some hard spoken militance
Dominate civilians with minus a millions
Operation get a slice of the pie and stay high
Chorus

Verse 3 (Farma G)
It's on you with no blame being thrown off the stage
It's on me when my rhymes broke down yesterday
I'm saying it's on you to accept reasoning way
It's on you includes those who love to lay the blame
I've heard rappers excuses of why they can't make it
And producers say that our rappers are shit
But it ain't down to you to give hope and new improved
It's not just on me it's not just on you
I'm saying when I pull my weight dreams start to come true
If you're wack it's on you don't blame the world for your failure
It's all down to you whats gonna make ya or break ya
It's on you bredren how longs it gonna take ya

Verse 4 (Skinnyman)
There ain't no finger to point no name to call
If anyone's to blame for our downfall it's us all
From wack MC's confused about their identities
To journalists in magazines saying you'll never cut the cheese
There's things to be considered within the industries
Of A and R's who's only concern is making the G's
Take the art form take it apart from the norm
Add their little bit of booj cos their whole plans to chartstorm
Box and MTV are best to pull up their socks
Cos fake man with all awards we're gonna knock off your blocks
So all the fake groups pulled together by those A and R's
Filling your heads with how they'll take you make ya into stars
Shooting videos with bimbos and hired out cars
Getting down with media hypenitis drinking in the plush bars
That's the promise but not your artisticness to flourish
Cos when it does they'll shelf you and say your music's rubbish
And this mud overstand bogus operation
Of the one hit wonders claim to be the latest pop sensation
Now I'm gonna do whatever I want to
To make myself follow through cos the rest is on you
It's on you to kids with those sprays on trains
Tagging mud fams name to help our shit maintain
It's on you to kids in the record shops
Keep it real and spend your money on the British hip-hop
It's on you to DJ's on rap radio's
Who play our shit on their shows to make sure everybody knows
It's on you to recognise exactly what you got
Even though you might of thought that it's not what

Chorus

Outro (Chester P)
All you rappers, DJ's, producers, breakers, taggers
All the elements of Hip-Hop must strive together to be alive together
Because basically it's on all of us it ain't on one of us
It ain't on the Yankees to lead the way
It's all about the UK it's on us today
It's on you

Outro (Farma G)
Yeah it's the Task Force
It's the Farma G and Mr Chester P Hackenbush
Eno Red Rum, Mark B
Big up to Skinnyman, Mongo, the Bury Cru
Yeah Mr Thing on the cuts and DJ Vadim
Big up Jodie Green and all mans supporting the cause
Don't put this shit on pause
This is the K'Boro shit, ninety nine lick
Get ready cos we're coming[Intro: "interviewer" (Skinnyman)]
"So Skinnyman, now that you've signed a deal with talkin loud and your currently
Recording your album, how's this altered your lifestyle...?"
(Let me play this one, tell you exactly how it is in Finsbury
Cause in my life, ain't nuttin nice...check ya blud...)

[Skinnyman]
Nowadays I live my life on a day to day basis
Cuz everybody in the whole fam's got cases
Roamin the streets that are full of the screw faces
Resortin us back to the blocks that are on the stair cases
We hope we don't get to face the bases
Who wanna try and raise us to take the papers, laterz
To what my whole council estate is
Dwellin on the city on top of these sky scrapers
Me? I keep a watch over the whole of my acres
To those who wanna take us from 5'0's to fakers
Cuz all were tryin'a be is money makers
So we might have had a chance to escape from some of these derelict places
We're livin life at fast paces
It's like were gutter rats tryin'a contend these rap races
So best to tighten up your laces
Cuz this year I'm steppin up a gear too fast for you to chase us
You think I'd wanna stick around this town
And have to wait for a crackhead to beat my mum down
To get a phone call sayin just bring your money now
By any little fassy with a bucky runnin round
I don't love the sound of what those haters wanna do to me
Thats why I'm not givin them any opportunity
For me its not about all of the money and the jewellrey
Survival of the fittest is life so now its you or me
And I don't wanna move away from the flats
But thats they only way for me to get away from these cats
I sit and wonder why the fuck it has to be like that
And wonder it would have been like if we blew up in rap
But that's a dream and me I put reality first
And yeah its real that these theives wanna steal your mums purse
Does it seem, the whole of this manor is cursed
Like the bubble is boilin and just waitin to burst
This generations gettin worse - these youth man are comin up
Nuttins out there for 'em so they just don't give a fuck
And they ain't got nuttin to lose so them
They're out on streets late nights confused again
You put your feet in their shoes for them
And you see what you can do for them
And you too might screw for them
And this ain't really nuttin new for them
A man like you will probably label them a hooligan
To live good or bad, but me I'm mud cause the hood is bad
Dressin in rags on the ags you know my hood is mad
With worry bout gettin beat up or stabbed
Now we worry bout the man thats come to shoot up the ave'
The dreams we used to have are gone
For those hopes are basic needs we're in the bottom of the barrel tryin'a fight for life's necessities
This older man takin time to give advice to me
Tryina show me just how nice my life could be
I'd like to share the vision
But all I see is man on a mission
My streets are full of friction
And you can check my diction
It gets deep everywhere that you go
Cuz theres snakes everywhere in every ghetto you go
Wo wo...

[Outro: "interviewer"]
"So there we have it, a live interview from Skinnyman
Outside subterania-the infamous home of hip hop-this is ?...signing out..."[Skinnyman]
Who? Me, listen..
This time when we splash, trust we're gonna splash
They're gonna come up runnin' and pun us with their mash
Men are gonna stand firm, some are gonna dash
Some of them boys just ain't ready for the clash
When you don't see your life past you by in a flash
Cuz others wanna hate on the fat Jamaic' cash
Everything they've tried to achieve has even crashed
They're left walkin' up and down road lookin' brassed
Alas, most of them men are fassio's
Every two weeks they have to sign for dole
I'm on another level blood, check it, I'm-a roll
Rippin' down any spark with my famine toll
You don't know how that go, any way you want it
Settin' you which way, blood I'm on it, so run it

Who? Me, listen..

I used to roll deep with a crew of nasty soldiers
Now I hold heat, carryin' that weight on my shoulders
The way that I've been raised is too much to get over
The way the streets have tried to mould us then hold us to the pavement
Now we're facin' modern day enslavement
Gettin' shift, lookin' at the world behind the jail fence
Twenty three hours locked down is how your day's spent
Thinkin' 'bout the way all of my old school braves went
Cuz I been here puttin' it down for years
I watch my silence, screams will break the death ears
Nothings left here but a holy but fuckery
All over the country road is lookin' ugly, trust me
From the age of ten years old
Certain runnings that I've been through remain untold

Who? Me..

That's why I resurface, cause everything I hear sounds worthless
Man who wanna play your part, they know your purpose
I know my heart, my rhyme's stomp full of curses
Makin' every one around me start actin' nervous
Call doctors and nurses, emergency services
Pull it back like cartwheel spin reverses
Check my verses, the way I'm puttin' 'em down
The way I'm shuttin' 'em down, I'm not fuckin' around
I'm cleanin' up town like some old street sweepers
In broad daylight, I roll with night time creepers
Whoever want to eat us, beef us or show my peeps love
The others can meet their Grim Reapers
Forget bein' six feet deep dug, it don't matter
After I've left ya with ya scull bone shattered
The heads that you see me roll ain't no rappers
Gun clappers who live like nuttin don't matter[Intro: Tim Westwood (Mr. Tibbs) {Skinnyman} [Blade]]
Yo this is Westwood
I'm at Radio 1 just doin' my thing tonight
And just walked into this studio some of the hottest UK cats out there
My man Skinnyman {Woah, woah}, Blade [what's up?]
And Mr. Tibbs what's the deal? What you got for me?
{Yeah we got ya the new banger Tim straight from RZA
Straight from the Wu-Tang}
[Yeah this is Blade and the track, the hot new joints called the Boing, Boing]

(Yeah representin' live all my UK hip hop heads in the North Side, el tarno)
Down it's gonna bang in ya face, lets go

[Skinnyman (RZA)]
Regardless, I'll be here bringin' it heartless
Ruthless, to the death I'll stand for the truth yes
My God given talent is all that I can do best
Keep spittin' over these tracks and leavin' you blessed
So who requested my time on the set
Skinnyman's what you get, so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet
Ya best upthreat cuz it gets better yet
I'm that deft intellect, them boy they don't pent
So who requested Wu-Tang on the set (it's the RZA)
What you get so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet
We'll never let anybody else step
Or ever come with anything less for what you'd expect
If you pass me the mic then I'll gladly accept
I'll take it to the street, show you how rough it can get
Cuz everybody knows this rappin' thing isn't happenin'
Now they jack it in and go back to shottin' crack again
Locked down the block and get strapped with the gat again
Then we break it down then just deal with the matter then
So how you'd think a British ghetto youth feels
He can't get a record deal but he can get drugs to deal
He can't get a job but he can go for rob and steel
Lookin' for a mill' while you screamin' "keep it real!"
So I'll just stand here with this mic that I hold
Request the higher force to sweep over my soul
So I can fulfill my dream, go for my goals
I'm sick of spendin' every late night out of role

Calm but still merciless, rugged on impact
Explosive, leavin' nuttin' but rubber with a spinback
Snap a photo with your camera, capture the stamina
Hand it to a amature, show him how to damage a
Live set, make him feel the full effect
And yet still make it hard to detect and what's left?
Four men remain standin' like Gladiators
When the dusk clears nuttin' for the average ears
For years its been the same with minds of the artillery
God forgave us all for the merciless delivery
Holdin' the tools of the trade with a death grip
Rememberin' the times when nothin' was right, we was desperate
Dreams blown to smithereens, turned into nightmares with screams
There's a world of CREAM
If all goes correct we can stash supreme
Feed the fiend cuz that's the way it was meant to have been
You should of seen the comin', the language is universal
One time perfect attack with no rehearsal
Shook the Earth for what it's worth
You're in danger of a takeover, and it's analysed as global
We can find them whatever your predictions
Enterin' the realm unknown with no restricitons
It might be hard to believe
We invade, we conquer and lead

[Mr. Tibbs]
I'm a country man at heart but a city man by nature
Cuz even though it's fuck free, it's all about the paper
I love to live expensive, smoke like I'm in Jamiaca
Even when I'm broke I think I'm like but a creater
Avoids the green, even from my early teens
???????? in need of CREAM seen (seen)
But then I had a dream 'bout bein' the best rapper
But that ain't what it seems, next chapter
That's spreadin' the word
Inspiration from the hurb is what you hear when I got heard
I sat back and observed most of the men that shined before me
All that respect, keeper know 'nough of them will bore me
Singin' the same story, I'm better than you
And to tell you the truth most of them men are shut fools
We asked them in the struggle to make ends meet
That's why I told these MCs that talk is cheap
You might think you know Tibbs, you don't know me
Unless you walk my streets and talk to my peeps

[Hook: RZA]
Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing
Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing

[RZA]
With your high pitched face like eye liner
If the black gat bust you get struck by the side winder
You can't block and stop it when I spotted
I shoot like Luke Skywalker inside the cockpit
Aimin' at the top fighter
Who I mighta have thirty thousand kids spark the lighter
And set flames to the sky, we aim high
The baseline kick like the kid from Shang-Hi
Make your bubble bust, cuddle up from the rubble thrust
You'se will have the double juice duck, then I doubled up
To the double four, puddles pour from ya bum bot
Open swords can't be cured by the blood clot
Ya bum bastards, son I come classic
Frame won't last the length of my matchstick
Drunk off the Hennessey V.S. stop the B.S
I'm still off to catch the CREAM like P.S
Jake was makin' that green
People always say what the hell does that mean

Talkin' 'bout the science of social deprivation
From 'ere to wherever in the council estates the man are strugglin'
The poor lower working class

[Verse 1]
Blud, you go to sleep round here and have nightmares
Wake up and find the worst reality is right there
The difference is, in my dreams I'm always runnin' scared
But in reality, on road, I'm comin' prepared
So now who's gonna wanna run up and become a goner?
Everybody's gonna wanna get us, but they're on a longers
I'm still out to get the same cats from last summer
But man can't see them again, it's like they've done a runner
I'm still in the same manor, on the same number
And everybody knows where I'm at and what I'm under
I'm in the same slums, raisin' the funds
In the city where the youth man are blazin' the guns
Just look how this United Kingdom has come
Within the council estates where man'll fight over crumbs
You got young single parent mums
Havin' the hardest time tryn'a survive for their daughters and their sons
Be comin' out their youths, cause their youths are left out there
Raised on the ways of these streets without care
Now we're havin' our fair share of gun warfare
And it's all gone nuts and that's just cause it's poor here
People want more here, we're all on the floor here
It's raw here, can't even sleep and ignore here
Cause life's kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothing's equivalent to this council estate of mind

[Hook]
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds

[Verse 2]
I live amongst smashed syringes
Squatters' doors hangin' off the hinges
Hookers lookin' money for Bobby, shottin' their minges
Leavin' used condoms out on the staircases
Next to the broken pipes that's left by the Base heads
Local estate heads, have grown up to hate Feds
Kids with no helmets drivin' round on some bait peds
Abandoned cars are at the bottom of the block
So when it's pissin' down, kids have got a place to plot
To cotch and blaze pot, and watch this whole spot
Full up of lost souls with no goals who get left to rot
And what, I don't expect you to ever comprehend is
Why I got all actin' so self defensive
The neighbourhood shotters have all seen what it's comin' to
Local coppers on patrol are boppin' with a gun too
So anyone could bun you, leave and desert you
How long they gonna mourn you when somebody merks you?
Tryin' not to get shift when shiftin' your work true
When you wanna shift there ain't nowhere to splurt to
The stakes are high, still the best get placed
Tryn'a find how sweet success might taste
In a place where everybody is tryin' to flex
Nobody's really gettin' anywhere, so everybody's vexed
Livin' life kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothin's equivalent to this council estate of mind

[Hook]
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds

[Verse 3]
So these are lyrics for my people, livin' on the streets who
Know they ain't got nuttin' else to retreat to
If you gettin' food next man'll wanna eat you
Pure, bad beefs just to get to delete you
So many man nowadays are so see-through
Beware of their deceitful ways when they greet you
Those who feel it know it because they've been through
Times when their friends wanna switch up to beat you
I never used to see it but, now I got a clear view
Don't let no bad minded heads try get near you
If they're not on your level they'll never hear you
Ain't no time to be shaken or fearful
If you've been through, some of this evil that we do
A hundred Hail Mary's ain't enough to redeem you
All of my long time friends are crack fiends
Who have gone too far, but still say they didn't mean to
Does alleviation through base and crack relieve you?
Everybody's losin' their mind, and even me too
Step into my world if you wanna catch a preview
But don't tell a soul, cause they just won't believe you
That life's kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothin's equivalent to this council estate of mind
Life's kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothin's equivalent to this council estate of mind

[Hook x2]
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds[Intro: "interviewer" (Skinnyman)]
"So Skinnyman, now that you've signed a deal with talkin loud and your currently
Recording your album, how's this altered your lifestyle...?"
(Let me play this one, tell you exactly how it is in Finsbury
Cause in my life, ain't nuttin nice...check ya blud...)

[Skinnyman]
Nowadays I live my life on a day to day basis
Cuz everybody in the whole fam's got cases
Roamin the streets that are full of the screw faces
Resortin us back to the blocks that are on the stair cases
We hope we don't get to face the bases
Who wanna try and raise us to take the papers, laterz
To what my whole council estate is
Dwellin on the city on top of these sky scrapers
Me? I keep a watch over the whole of my acres
To those who wanna take us from 5'0's to fakers
Cuz all were tryin'a be is money makers
So we might have had a chance to escape from some of these derelict places
We're livin life at fast paces
It's like were gutter rats tryin'a contend these rap races
So best to tighten up your laces
Cuz this year I'm steppin up a gear too fast for you to chase us
You think I'd wanna stick around this town
And have to wait for a crackhead to beat my mum down
To get a phone call sayin just bring your money now
By any little fassy with a bucky runnin round
I don't love the sound of what those haters wanna do to me
Thats why I'm not givin them any opportunity
For me its not about all of the money and the jewellrey
Survival of the fittest is life so now its you or me
And I don't wanna move away from the flats
But thats they only way for me to get away from these cats
I sit and wonder why the fuck it has to be like that
And wonder it would have been like if we blew up in rap
But that's a dream and me I put reality first
And yeah its real that these theives wanna steal your mums purse
Does it seem, the whole of this manor is cursed
Like the bubble is boilin and just waitin to burst
This generations gettin worse - these youth man are comin up
Nuttins out there for 'em so they just don't give a fuck
And they ain't got nuttin to lose so them
They're out on streets late nights confused again
You put your feet in their shoes for them
And you see what you can do for them
And you too might screw for them
And this ain't really nuttin new for them
A man like you will probably label them a hooligan
To live good or bad, but me I'm mud cause the hood is bad
Dressin in rags on the ags you know my hood is mad
With worry bout gettin beat up or stabbed
Now we worry bout the man thats come to shoot up the ave'
The dreams we used to have are gone
For those hopes are basic needs we're in the bottom of the barrel tryin'a fight for life's necessities
This older man takin time to give advice to me
Tryina show me just how nice my life could be
I'd like to share the vision
But all I see is man on a mission
My streets are full of friction
And you can check my diction
It gets deep everywhere that you go
Cuz theres snakes everywhere in every ghetto you go
Wo wo...

[Outro: "interviewer"]
"So there we have it, a live interview from Skinnyman
Outside subterania-the infamous home of hip hop-this is ?...signing out..."[Verse 1: Wiley]

Shhh... it's Eskiboy

I been killing sound boys on the regular
Me and my crew speak raw on the regular
Tell 'em where I'm from, let 'em know I'm a regular
These three kids make money on the regular

I make tunes sell records on the regular
Boy you know I don't have it on the regular
Flex supersize I blaze on the regular
Practice on the radio on the regular

Joe Pesci boy I war on the regs
Some of them hatched last week from the eggs
Imma come through and slew them on the regs
Used to make toy guns right from the pegs and a bit of wood
I'm on the estate on the regs
Playing marbles in the playground on the regs
Took everybody's marbles on the regs
Did you see that black T-Spark on the regs?

[Hook]
Fame
Fame makes a grown man change from the change into black tie arranging the game and

Fame makes a grown man change from the change into black tie arranging the game and

[Verse 2: Skinnyman]

Dope ting, high manner on a broke ting
Still high hoping, high grade smoking
But we don't get to see no doors open
You don't want to see the way that I'm coping
Smashing everything that I've been clashing
In it with a passion, ready for the action, mashing
Mandem on the bandwagon, little follow fashion, thinking that they're splashing
Counting them off: 5, 6, 7, 8 - Skinnyman hitting them hard just like a heavyweight
You're not ready mate, 'cos my lyrics gonna penetrate to elevate the youths on the council estate and
Mad fam is the name brand
With a dark art little Dapper Dan is the main man
They're all stunted and they're in it for the fame and the money but they don't know this ain't a game man

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wunda]

Open your eyes and see, you can't shoot a bredda up on the mic like me
From your nose to your bun, cheech a guy like me but you're gonna know the sky like me
You'll see it's me - aka K.I.D. -  never roll when you're running with a fake ID
If you roll to the manor then you may find me in the yard with a zoot from the bare tight weed

So - stay keen to the gangsta theme, I step out the whip walking, the gangsta lean
You get ch-ch (gunshot) banging at your gangster spleen that's how they separate the men from the gangstas, seen?
Turning in the gangsta dream and these hoes they know how to keep a gangsta keen
Thanks to me they now suck a trampoline
I run them chicken like a tambourine, they don't know[Skinnyman]
I don't wanna blow up, throughout every era I've been here
So far the underground circuit has been fair
The home of hip hop, can you say you've been there?
Home's where the heart is so hip hop lives right here
I'm from UK, to you that might seem rare
I'm steppin' up now to make sure I seem clear
In every council estate we've got pure talent
No one don't care because I seen as a challenge
I suppose we'll never be the balance that you're lookin'
You wanna dilute the realness then sling their hookin'
Most A&R cats I've ever met was all shooken
I'm lost for words if they don't bring a chequebook in
I'm livin' in a place where you can get your life tooken
For half steppin, by kids that'll blast weapons
Pull out by the lights they'll have you out in half seconds
Think you're rough hang around if your ass reckons
Don't have to look for trouble, trouble it'll find ya
Don't turn around it'll be right behind ya
Then September the 11th will remind ya
Nobody ain't too major nor minor
If you're back in the streets or in a brand new recliner
Grab ya dicks and girls rub your vagina
Pay the pound I'll provide the punch liner
Might look young but I'm a real old timer
Been around ever since the days of Boogie Down
You can check my résumé the evidence can be found
Forever been blessin' eloquence over sound
Before we had the lino for spinnin' on the ground
Since then shit's changed, mad shits gone down
But we're still gettin' down to this same old sound, that hip hop
That good shit for rockin' a crowd
Where there ain't no space for mistakes allowed
I feel proud when I'm leavin' crowds vyin' for more
This year I'm really thinkin; bout tryin a tour
Is hip hop worth dying for, if your life's on the line and your only crime is being poor?
This time around I feel I want more
I wanna see my son's future set secure
Without havin' to go out and start breakin' the law
I'm sick of being sat in the flat shottin' the draw
I'm sick of watchin every day come and go by, tellin' Titch and Fat Boy, hold ya head high
See others come and go, watchin' their mothers cry, sayin', "Why did my boy have to die?"
And still we'll try
As others might choose to get high
But we must uprise through to get by
It don't take too much to figure out the facts about, who's bringin in all the coke and the crack?
This week an 82 year old got her throat slashed in the flats by some cats lookin' cash for their crack
And we're the kids whose left facing the facts
Now youts lookin' mobiles that match their straps
Like fashion, everybody's ready for the action
Ready for the mashin' and thuggin' it with a passion
Only takes two egos to start clashin', bullets start flyin' then the blood'll start splashin'
Social rage is really climaxing
Everyday I see it getting worse by a fraction
Drought for the weed, but nuff of that crack thing
Nobody round here is gonna be relaxin'
And this ain't no whites or a blacks thing
It's if you're livin' in the council flats and on da brap ting
They got us on a lab rat thing
And it's funny to me how easily we're all adapting
So I'm jus gonna keep-a rappin'
You lot keep ya necks snappin', and fuck the hook
Come on fuck your hook, come on "fuck the hook", say "fuck the hook"
Fuck the hook, come on fuck the hook
Fuck the hook, fuck the hook...Teachers who saw their education as a blessin
Come to school now all in a sort of depression
All o' da kids in the class, they all stressin
The teacher's just waitin for that first kid to test him
So school doesn't seem like its any kind of lesson
We're out on the streets tryna make our possession
The manor that we're from has turned like spaghetti western
With itchy fingers on da triggers ready for the pressin and its...

Pure depression, I'm standin at the crossroads
Thinkin bout all the other children of the lost souls
And now we only aim for goals that we can see
Another brother thought he saw his future shottin B
He's 19 an' he's caught wid a half a Kee
So now he ain't comin' home until he's 33
What a waste of a life
Jus' like a criss girl I knew who fucked man for a taste of pipe
No-one's ready to face up to these fights
But you find some mad shit on these council estates at night
So lock your shit down safe an tight
And stand firm like a soldier so you don't lose face, all right?

The police patrol the streets like beasts
Instead of chasin the thiefs they pull us up and give us beats
So we run these streets red, kids are holdin their head
As they drivin around on their stolen peds
They're just dealin the cards that life has dealt em
Half of their crews are now lockdown in Feltham
Schools an' probation just can't seem to help dem
The law has made sure that they've grown to resent dem
Don't ask them now what is their life representin
To get through their day is their sole intention
An you can't tell them that they're wrong
Coz they're all men-child and feel they know what's goin on
They haven't got no time to enjoy jus bein young or havin fun
They out there keepin it headstrong
They couldn't let Skinnyman come and advise them
They look at me as if my words was patronisin
They can't think about no long-term plans
When they just young boys tryin to be some o' da mans dem
They can't think about no long term plans
When they just young boys tryin to be some o' da mans them...[Hook: DVS]
Hold on tight to what you own, cos there's people like me outside your door
Hold on tight to what you own, cos there's people like me outside your door

[Verse 1: Orifice Vulgatron]
Step in the ring, blaze cats, slay bate twats
Make that train, wait back, spread an 8-track
Spitting out all kind of rhyme with the way that
Make any rapper wanna stop with the late chat
Nobody knows a nigga looking to bring by
You couldn't even rock a toe with a play back
Foreign beggar fam over run as I take that
Rap Montana, write my name by the train tracks
Kit Kat rappers get bucked and bitch slapped
Cut, black eye, some wanna play flip-flap?
Sit back up, chit chatter, where da check at?
Charge next man £10 for a Tic Tac
Spit down lyric quick fast when they say cash
Ship-wrecked rappers get bucked with a big bat
Kill any mini-man dick with a shit gat
Spill a man's guts with the face of a pick-axe
Woah? commin on a bit gotta get a (lick sharp?)
Quick fix, bitch, then did a bit of crack rock
Red-hot rapper, nigga nock about his spit right
Lock up any amatuer that wanna come shit talk
Ruba dub dub get dumped in the trunk
Armed with a mic and a big bag of punk
[?] run a muck and then I'll come
Make a hall stand up, fuck 'em up and to the back to the front
From my earliest pillaging and scheming with mad men
Bad men form all the way from Erith to Camden
Challenging any man dem who spit on a track
I never saw talkin' shit and get ready to lamp him
Big bad rappers get slapped up in tandem
Acting like dons but they're openly rampant
Jump up in the back of the car like he was strapped in
None of us panic, here I come with my fat pen

[Hook] x 2

[Verse 2: Skinnyman]
Blud, I ain't trying to prove nothing, move something
Too many man are left dead for nothing
Get battered up, whacked up, spurred for nothing
Beat down, hurt, or left murked for nothing blad
But thats just how tings were gwannin
When a man said hes a bad man from morning
Now wait till Sunday morning, his family's in church, dressed in black; mourning
Nobody had a chance to warn him coz he had just been
On stage performing and certain girl-dem had started to swarm him
And after that just sounds quite alarming
One brother said your a chief and yes you can
Tell that im looking beef coz i live around all the depression
On the streets [?] my main stress relief
Bust one, and in your belly
Bust one, and in your teeth
And heap on anyone I'm looking to eat
Cos any idiot could have drawn the gun back
Lick out the barrel and make the gun clap
Me I just step at the mic and I run checks
Give them the eye and I shall return in a comeback
Mr Vulga asked me to guest track
Instead of me telling the man dem to get flat
The manor that I'm living in, yes I rep that
Anything I want in life yes I get that
Disrespect me, get disrespect back
Are you really from the ends blad?
Forget that
Are you really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, from the ends blad?
Forget that
Are you really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, from the ends blad?
Forget that

[Hook x 2][Hook: Sly and the Family Stone]
If I make it till tomorrow
I’ll be surprised (I’ll be surprised), (I’ll be surprised)
If I make it till tomorrow
I’ll be surprised (I’ll be surprised) (I’ll be surprised)

[Verse 1: Skinnyman]
Tonight there’s gonna be a massacre
Straight after the sun goes down
Going out for all of them haters and running them down
I’m bunning them down
How you mean I’m gunning them down?
They going on as if they got the right to yam up town
Well no they won’t, we no more eating for them now
I’m bringing them beef
It’s not the meat from a cow
You wanna jack man and act like that’s gonna be allowed?
Do you think I’d let that ride?
I’m too fucking proud
The tables turn as I ride on you now
Say goodnight as I’m puttin’ your lights out
Should’ve taken me out when you had the chance
Under the moonlight
Time to meet the Devil and dance
Ask Nas, you from the Hood
You have to get yourself a gun
And when it’s on, you don’t pop your shit and run
You stand firm till the whole clip’s done
Or else you’ll have a slim chance of seeing tomorrow son

[Hook]

So now I’m roaming with 2 straps
Both off the safety catch
Around the spots where they’re shotting the crack
I’m looking for cats, to get any haters I see
How many haters up in Finsbury are there out to get me?
Just like Chong
A crack head paedophile and his son
Going on as if they heavy ’cause they holding a gun
They can’t run
How many more life’s have gotta done
So them man can sit back with a crack-pipe to bun?
Fucking scum
Love to take life for fun
Killing innocent sons and leaving heartbroken mums
I say, MURDERER, blood is on your trainer
Policeman took that to forensic doctor
MURDER the victim’s family must all hate ya
So kill me now because you won’t kill me later
I’m ready to die and I’m ready to take life
And I’m gonna be surprised if I make it through tonight

[Hook]

All night I’ve been searching
To find out where them fassy ‘oles are lurking
Think I finally found them but I still gotta be certain
I heard they shotting work in the crack house in the block
The flat, without the curtain
Come. We go hurt them?
Firebomb the letter box and leave them all burning
If they coming running, my bullets gonna splurt them
I’m all out to hurt them and leave them for dead
Making sure every one of them gets one in the head
I’m running it red
Not thinking about running from Feds
The only thoughts that I’m having is to fill them full of lead
I didn’t wanna have to go resort to all the bloodshed
But now it’s kill or be killed and left on your death bed
As I look into the face of this crack-facing demon
Knowing he’s the type who rapes his own semen
What do you believe in
The dark or the light?
I know I’m gonna be surprised if I make it through tonight

[Hook][Skinnyman]
So now the Little Man's caught by the feds
He's in a cell in he the parrow state
Straight from the judge's courtrooms to the prison gates
Sittin' in a sweatbox thinkin', he has to ride an eight
Sittin' in a jail cell just eatin' food and pushin' weights
Gettin' straight, hopin' his parole board can set a date
Everyday he's made to just sit a wait makes him full of hate
It makes the Screws with fuck me attitudes
Leaves him baffled and confused, not knowin' what to do
What path to choose or how he's gonna follow through
Feelin' like the systems only set out for him to loose
He's black-eyed, goes to his garden in the crack house
Knocks on the door of the flats and pulls the gat out
Shot the dealer in his chest, blew the brothers back out
Said that, "I'm the big dog now" and chased the cats out
To chat 'bout murderous ways that he would act out
A brother rolled in money, so he beat him 'til he blacked out
Took him to his mothers yard, bandaged up his yat’s mouth
Tied the brother to the chair and pulled the baseball bat out
He took the slack route, that was really his decision
His freedom of will has left him with the life he's livin'
So now Little Man, we see that look in your eyes
Now that your beatin' and defeaten, institutionalised
I said Little Man So, we see the look in your eyes
Now that your beatin' and your defeaten, institutionalized[Hook]
Music speaks louder than words
It’s the only thing the the whole world listens to

[Verse 1]
They didn't want to understand about the views of the kids
Until they heard it getting ran over the music I did
A true reflection of the place we live
Getting broadcasted live way beyond those council estate cribs
The sound of music and the power it gives
That's why I'm forever reaching out to my fans, doing my gigs
Anyone who see my show can see how true that this is
Now there's journalists wanna interview me for this
They can't be disillusioned or confused from my hits
I've just been telling it the way that it is, it's not about showbiz
Before that they wanna make my words sound twist
I think they're either dumb, ignorant or taking the piss
Before I get into this and let my words sound twist
I say excuse me while I light up my spliff
Rather twist up my 'erbs, instead of letting you lot twist up my verbs
I let my music speak out for me, louder than words

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I took my raps and ran to the booth
I knew my lyrics brang you the truth
It's like nobody didn't wanna take a stand for the youth
I let them know that the system's got a plan for the youth
And how the media really couldn't handle the truth
They don't expose how the police like to handle the youth
In broad daylight they get away with strangling youth
In Camden Town on a Saturday, I brang you the proof
RIP Uncle Dob I'm still banging for you
I'm damned if I don't, same way I'm damned if I do
Now if I namesake they claim say I'm some scandalous yout
Cos the message that I brang to ya
Is the opposite to their political hypocritical propaganda
So know what you stand for or fall for anything
The jewel in the mind is worth more than any bling
That's why I'm bringing myself up in this position
To give it you it the only way the whole world listens to

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I stay loyal to the music, it won't betray me
And I'm mad over music cos it drives me crazy
I've changed for the better cos my music's changed me
I feel I've been saved like my music's saved me
Unstoppable, got my ambition in music
And I won't go abuse my position in music
I'm feeling like a man on a mission in music
The way to make the whole world listen is music

[Hook][Hook]
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (I'm not tryin to be no big thing)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice (I can't tell you how to live your life blud)
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (no role models up in here, what?)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice

[Verse 1]
Blud I'm not sayin that I'm anything, who am I to give man advice?
It's not that I know best, when trust blud I don't
All I know is if your comin from this manor I'm from
You'll find nuff man'll test ya don't think they won't
Everybody is on their own little hustle just to find a way to try get thru
When your raised in this fuckry
And if your makin some papes on these estates man'll try and get you
So you run and grab your bucky
You count your blessins everyday but still accept you'll have to take your loses
It's money that your makin
Especially if your comin up in the ranks
Against the big crime bosses that are all sittin hatin
The jealous ones'll always envy so you dare say it now who wants it
Let them fuckers spite ya
They're out to get you so you get them first
And look now uve done it cause your arrived in a lifer
Stop

I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (man ain't tryin to be nothing big blud)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice (I can't really tell you how to live your life, get me)
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (nuttin big star)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice

[Verse 2]
I'm from a manor where the last 20yrs have been infested
By the crack-cocaine, that you'll find man endeavourin
To come down from the ? man are shovin needles in thier vein
With juice full up of heroin
We are all stuck in this struggle but its not as if we can't see
That nuff mans out there shottin work
They use it for an escape as if its really gonna set man free
When we are still diggin in the dirt
The schools are underacheivin in the grades so its minumum wage
By the time you go to look a job
But on the streets we are learnin every other aspect of the criminal trade
So instead we gonna look to rob
It's like a gamble for your life on this manor so you hope that you win
Or else you'll just be runnin shook
And I can't tell you how to live any better I ain't no big ting
Trust me listen to the hook
Look

I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (I'm not tryin to be no big thing)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice (I can't tell you how to live your life at all)
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (I ain't tryin to be no biggie blud)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice

[Verse 3]
So what's the method for the madness
For any of these kids who get left out on these streets
Where you find evrybody's frettin
And walkin round with screw faces thinkin that
Pure bad beefs is all their likely plan to getting
Don't let anybody get in your way
From tryin to chase your dreams blud, whatever they might be
You've got to go for whatever you wanna be no matta
If that might seem however unlikely
If you don't go make a start for the betta then your shit won't change
And you'll just get left behind
And end up like so many brothers who still out here
Goin insane feelin' like they've lost their mind
So get lost in the dust if your not goin to make your start
Instead of just sittin and wishin
Nobodys getting any younger so you know
You 'av to play your part
If you wanna betta your position
Listen

I'm not tryin to be, no big thing
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing, no no
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice[Delta]
It's gone too far
It's time to wipe the fake blood off that platinum plate
"When you say you're right, but you know you're wrong
Than have you the right to carry on"

[Verse 1: Delta]
On these beats how many emcees present arms
Teach kids how to commit grievous harm
Martin turned Port Arthur into Vietnam
Joe Citizen thinks he's Genghis Kahn
And a Heckler & Koch replaced my boombox
Flocks rock ox-cutters in their tube socks
I don't disrespect those forced to battle
No hippy tryna slide a white flower down a barrel
But that thug pose, where the snub nose gotta go
You suffer paranoia? Most don't wanna know
These rappers openly claim to cock back the heat
Before career criminals, they're not that discreet
That M16 with a full magazine
You can't disasemble and don't know how to clean
A rhyme about a gun ain't as dangerous
As a kid holding one feeling aimlessness, suckers

[Hook]
"When you say you're right"
One less gun
"But you know you're wrong"
What we saying is
"Than have you the right to carry on"
STOP YOUR GUN TALK --] Skinnyman
"When you say you're right"
One less gun
"But you know you're wrong"
Drop that front
"When you take the life"
The pain goes on

[Verse 2: Skinnyman]
You can't be pulling no wool over my eyes
To tell me that it's right, when it's wrong
And where acting like life goes on
Carry on, after so many lives have gone
From the blades of the swords to the bullets of the guns
And now we're recognising how far we've come
Hell on earth is manifested through the shell of a bomb
And ??? carnage running strong, now we're facing armageddon
Don't tell me that it's right when it's far from fixed up
The whole world's mixed-up, put your arms in the air
It's the arms of fear, your nations sticker
Plain to see they can't justify their acts
And they can't deny the facts
What took place through the past and karma's gonna come right back
So don't tell me nothing's wrong with that
After years of our life you've been saying that it's all alright
But it's all coming home tonight, and we'll see if you're right

[Hook]
"When you say you're right"

[Verse 3: Delta]
Half game-hunter, half blade-runner
303 or 45, the same number
Scant to enter the club? No wonder
First blood's the Hollywood spell your son's under
Before you lick off spray, may wish to pay
Attention to which way the bullets ricochet
A loaded fire arm is a clip full of strays
To lay any innocent victim up in a grave
Inner-hate we feel now rising to the skin
Hiding in a rental home, fighting for your kin
The worth of life hangs in the balance
The true challenge is to not assume the role of a savage
Sharpen up and bury hatchets
Infra-red Crew wear the new era logo on your cap is
How pathetic another joint about a gat is
Now uranium can blow the globe off its axis

[Hook]
"When you say you're right"

One less gun --] Skinnyman
Drop that front
"When you take the life"

[Skinnyman]
They can't say that they're right when we know that they're wrong
From the days they've owned the very first gun
From when they took the Chinese gun powder and put it in a led pipe
And shot someone
From when they took a cannon and took 21 shots to blow off the nose
Of the sphinx
It kinda makes you think, they keep using the bombs and the guns
And we'll all be extinct
This has been a Mark B production
Brought to you by Delta, featuring myself, Skinnyman
We don't back no weapons of destruction
Not at all we don't take life
That's not part of our promotion
And we're out, peace

"When you say you're right, but you know you're wrong
Than have you the right to carry on"[Verse 1: Skinnyman]
...We both came from the city of Leeds
With all those wicked as theives
We halve the apple for the man to proceed
Now we, come to blaze it all across the map
We know where we're coming from so we know where it's at
It's Braintax and Skinnyman blazing a track
Biro Funk for all the rap junkies to pack in a sack

[Verse 2: Braintx]
First of all for all the heads who don't know by now
I'm gonna start from the top and break it all right down
My moniker is Braintax when I'm spitting on wax
Or when I'm making a track but when I'm sending a fax
I sign J Christie on a licence contract cos I'm on my own label
And it's called Low Life
Putting records in the shops since '92
A lot of people don't know and think this here's brand new
I gotta shout out Destiny from Catch A Groove days
For buying in my records trekking round in a haze
Through the West End, back then me and my best friend
But now Braintax is a one-man scheme
And all my friends contribute to this solo team
I know I mean what I say plus I know what I mean
Do you know what I mean? This is Biro Funk
And it feels like a giro and a henry of skunk
See I - got the beats from Harry Love I do shows with
And me and Mystro got flows and now you know mate
I've been rapping since the Toxteth riots
So you new jack, American-wannabees need to stay quiet
I'm mad at life cos I don't really wanna be here
My Benny Live track will make you see clear
Like The Grip - Jehst beat - politics, know the dark shit
Low Life is depth, dopeness we start shit and show paths
Not in it for the laughs
And looking after business though I still hate maths
But I love cash, every 20 note's a brick
In my house in the sun that's why I'm up at half 1
I swore to stop writing punchline nonsense
And now it takes longer but I penetrate your conscience
(Who's this?) No-one else sounds like Brains, you get me?
North plus South, and my mood? Well, it's tetchy

[Hook] {repeats}
"Everybody, everybody, everbody"
"C'mon"

[Braintax]
OK, we're just starting now
Stay with the Biro Funk
I gotta give shout outs to people on the album, made it what it is
And goes like this (Braintax) that's me
Harry Love hitting on with funky beats
(Mystro!) flows to make you feel complete
Skinnyman too for analysing my shit
On the cut shorty blitzen, the shit don't stink
I'm banging for that SP shit
(Like what?) and Benny Live with the different vibe
And Jehst, one of the best - a true scribe
I ??? for the funk life
Taskforce music from the corner this year
A Shepard's Bush traffic for my atmosphere

That's how we set it off
Braintax, the finest shit
One more time fore the weed heads at the back!

Just give me light bless, :-)[Blade]
I'm sort of like a doctor about to operate
Crowds cooperate waiting for Source to set the date
The long awaited album finally planned for production
Full steam ahead, I hope the fans are prepared
We hope we go platinum, ain't nothing wrong with dreaming
While the jealous are scheming because we get the crowds screaming
For more, real rappers becoming extinct like dinosaurs
While we're preparing for tours, you're rushing the stores
To get a copy, 'The Unknown' far from poppy
Highly recommended by many cause we ain't sloppy
Trust me, this album will be known for setting standards
Selling cause we're good not cause we're paying back-handers
Like them boy bands put together like a jigsaw puzzle
Made to fit, we're the opposite, maybe we'll hit
We're breaking most barriers
Conquering many lands and as it stands
Our reputation expands
No if, buts or ands
Follow the procedure
When we're done, clap your hands
For those who know us well, you know we're bound to excel
And at the same time we're building our clientele

[Lewis Parker]
Yeah, it's like jealous ones envy Mark B, Blade and Parker
Cocktails and long nails and rooms full of laughter
The undercover master hold it down to extreme
You're getting loose at the seems so I'm pulling your card
Yeah we're at large, espionage in the city
Gigantic in sounds soaking through the tin pan dizzy shit
Too many fools on silly shit, whatever
Ain't got time
Cause time is too valid, serve it up like salad
The poison ballad on the menu, big ladies and
Machine guns versus pencil thin models
Fools stop and ogle, boggled by the perversions
Until their guns turn causing concern and dispersion
From the display, the truth is whatever they say
They hype is narrow cause that's the way they stay
As the bottoms sway I make my way without selling it
What up to my fellowship busy in experiment
Back in the lab, keep the break over the stab
Who's the man of the moment as nature's gone mad
Mark B and Blade may be an odd couple
Opposites attract
We play 'em at their own hustle

[Skinnyman]
The most anticipated, most long awaited to burst
You're damn right you'd have to hold me back until the third verse
You probably realized it's me by now and start to curse
Before you say fuck me, I'll say fuck you first
And come worse than any wicked man, Skinnyman, Muddy Fam
Dargdart dapper dan, long time veteran
From I was a youth I used to sit and listen Papa San
Now I listen Sizzla Kalonji and Capleton
Bishy Bashy in a ragga dance like I'm Rodigan
Hip-hop something that's coming straight out of Engaland
Spin this on the radio and in every jam
By Chubby Kid, Short Blitz, Tim Westwood and the Number Man
This is for the youths so they can understand exactly what I'm under man
Representing here from another dan
Blade a rap renegade for years
Legendary in the game, you'd have to run go check your peers
They're running around, talking about who's gonna pioneer
Like they didn't know that we'd been representing for years
I'm like a lion that rules the jungle without fear
Y2K is exactly our year, you hear[Skinnyman]
Who? Me, listen..
This time when we splash, trust we're gonna splash
They're gonna come up runnin' and pun us with their mash
Men are gonna stand firm, some are gonna dash
Some of them boys just ain't ready for the clash
When you don't see your life past you by in a flash
Cuz others wanna hate on the fat Jamaic' cash
Everything they've tried to achieve has even crashed
They're left walkin' up and down road lookin' brassed
Alas, most of them men are fassio's
Every two weeks they have to sign for dole
I'm on another level blood, check it, I'm-a roll
Rippin' down any spark with my famine toll
You don't know how that go, any way you want it
Settin' you which way, blood I'm on it, so run it

Who? Me, listen..

I used to roll deep with a crew of nasty soldiers
Now I hold heat, carryin' that weight on my shoulders
The way that I've been raised is too much to get over
The way the streets have tried to mould us then hold us to the pavement
Now we're facin' modern day enslavement
Gettin' shift, lookin' at the world behind the jail fence
Twenty three hours locked down is how your day's spent
Thinkin' 'bout the way all of my old school braves went
Cuz I been here puttin' it down for years
I watch my silence, screams will break the death ears
Nothings left here but a holy but fuckery
All over the country road is lookin' ugly, trust me
From the age of ten years old
Certain runnings that I've been through remain untold

Who? Me..

That's why I resurface, cause everything I hear sounds worthless
Man who wanna play your part, they know your purpose
I know my heart, my rhyme's stomp full of curses
Makin' every one around me start actin' nervous
Call doctors and nurses, emergency services
Pull it back like cartwheel spin reverses
Check my verses, the way I'm puttin' 'em down
The way I'm shuttin' 'em down, I'm not fuckin' around
I'm cleanin' up town like some old street sweepers
In broad daylight, I roll with night time creepers
Whoever want to eat us, beef us or show my peeps love
The others can meet their Grim Reapers
Forget bein' six feet deep dug, it don't matter
After I've left ya with ya scull bone shattered
The heads that you see me roll ain't no rappers
Gun clappers who live like nuttin don't matter[Intro]

Louiie B!Hooooldin tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade
Soooo - I'm holding tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade no more

Step in the booth get bars on the page out lining up high grade on the table
Who woulda thought that this guy'd end up fucked up tryna get paid through paypal
Gigs on the regs with culprate blaze out, hyping a set see I'm outta my cage now
Act real nice off stage then when I'm on the mic i'll unleash hype in the rave like blaow
Ye i run that, i'll do shout outs at the end so bun that
I'm gonna get real deep on the mic so hold on tight inside while i run this vibe right by you
Find that darkest part of the room and sit, on ur backside
Don't get up till the end of the track, I mean don't move or you might get smacked I
Need to calm, and get the words out that thinking about
Oh dear I know what this songs bout here pass me the grade and split that snout then
Bill another zoot and make it tasty, gotta make zoots bare fat when i blaze these
Then my mind starts turning deep head rush to the brain I'm weak in the knees
I'm startin to feel bare rough when i speak i'm holding onto this zoot
But i know i can't hold on much longer, half of my potential squandered
When i sit bunnin up zoots, loving up tunes, billin up hoots, killin up booths
My mind resorts to turning ill, the end is near but for now I'm still just -

Hooooldin tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade
Soooo - I'm holding tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade no more

I ain't got nothin to prove if i get roughed up I'm bussing a move
I'm lean as fuck and I still might light these up before the nights through
See, theres no controlling me, its my choice if i get dope n lean
But i ain't gonna drag no one down with me, if its the end, then I'm gonna move swiftly
Quick see when i drift i get lost in abyss in the mist of a black hole
Tryna find my way back to the clean intact soul that i used to inhabit
But now its so, packed fulla dope when i toke its green thats causin damage
The truth is i should have really tried to quite time ago
But i couldn't quit so i gave rhymes a go, and now i'm
So reliant on the grade that i puff 10 zoots in a day and it don't even phase me
Apart from the fact that i surrender to munchies and get real lazy
So maybe its time that i gave it a break and changed up the mind state
Forget the dark vibes 'lifes alright mate', cos if i keep thinking like this
Then i ain’t gonna live for a whole lot longer, a diet thats consists of zoots and bongs
Well & truly means that my potentials squandered, when i sit
Bunnin up zoots, loving up tunes, billin up hoots, killin up booths
My mind resorts to turning ill, the end is near but for now I'm still just -


Hooooldin tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade
Soooo - I'm holding tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade no moreVerse 1 (Chester P)
I'm sick of hearing people say how they got everything going bad for them
And how the world's against them and how the whole scene hates them
And how it's holding them back, boy you know what...
It weren't me
It weren't the task f.o.r.c.e
It weren't the Mud Fam, the Bury Cru or Mark B
So I run around town searching for clues
And all them people losing touch bredrens it's on you
I'm a drill a bray the Milky Way for trying to operate a scam
This is an expose resistance makes a stand
Who do you think we are some fly by night militia
Just take hold of your positions the storms about to start
And you ain't never gonna make this cos it ain't in your heart
You piss take and get taken over real sharp
I hope you followed the description of my story so far
Cos we ain't operating petty over wars and feuds
So at the end of the night bredren it's on you
It's on you bredren so what ya gonna do
Chorus
MC's it's on you
DJ's it's on you
And the man's making beats for their crews it's on you
It's on you

Verse 2 (Eno Red Rum)
For those who boost their skills with their clothes
For those who run stagnated rap flows
It's over when Eno screams Red Rum
The rhythm murderer smashing verbal rockers on drums
Practical production over flowing instruments
Desirable finales that remain your only influence
Ripped from my inputs your about to be buried
In the graveyard under moonlit cemetries
Your decision is to tearaway like delinquents
Put aside your insolance for some hard spoken militance
Dominate civilians with minus a millions
Operation get a slice of the pie and stay high
Chorus

Verse 3 (Farma G)
It's on you with no blame being thrown off the stage
It's on me when my rhymes broke down yesterday
I'm saying it's on you to accept reasoning way
It's on you includes those who love to lay the blame
I've heard rappers excuses of why they can't make it
And producers say that our rappers are shit
But it ain't down to you to give hope and new improved
It's not just on me it's not just on you
I'm saying when I pull my weight dreams start to come true
If you're wack it's on you don't blame the world for your failure
It's all down to you whats gonna make ya or break ya
It's on you bredren how longs it gonna take ya

Verse 4 (Skinnyman)
There ain't no finger to point no name to call
If anyone's to blame for our downfall it's us all
From wack MC's confused about their identities
To journalists in magazines saying you'll never cut the cheese
There's things to be considered within the industries
Of A and R's who's only concern is making the G's
Take the art form take it apart from the norm
Add their little bit of booj cos their whole plans to chartstorm
Box and MTV are best to pull up their socks
Cos fake man with all awards we're gonna knock off your blocks
So all the fake groups pulled together by those A and R's
Filling your heads with how they'll take you make ya into stars
Shooting videos with bimbos and hired out cars
Getting down with media hypenitis drinking in the plush bars
That's the promise but not your artisticness to flourish
Cos when it does they'll shelf you and say your music's rubbish
And this mud overstand bogus operation
Of the one hit wonders claim to be the latest pop sensation
Now I'm gonna do whatever I want to
To make myself follow through cos the rest is on you
It's on you to kids with those sprays on trains
Tagging mud fams name to help our shit maintain
It's on you to kids in the record shops
Keep it real and spend your money on the British hip-hop
It's on you to DJ's on rap radio's
Who play our shit on their shows to make sure everybody knows
It's on you to recognise exactly what you got
Even though you might of thought that it's not what

Chorus

Outro (Chester P)
All you rappers, DJ's, producers, breakers, taggers
All the elements of Hip-Hop must strive together to be alive together
Because basically it's on all of us it ain't on one of us
It ain't on the Yankees to lead the way
It's all about the UK it's on us today
It's on you

Outro (Farma G)
Yeah it's the Task Force
It's the Farma G and Mr Chester P Hackenbush
Eno Red Rum, Mark B
Big up to Skinnyman, Mongo, the Bury Cru
Yeah Mr Thing on the cuts and DJ Vadim
Big up Jodie Green and all mans supporting the cause
Don't put this shit on pause
This is the K'Boro shit, ninety nine lick
Get ready cos we're coming(Out of this room, out of this place, you know; back into the world
IT'S YOUR FUCKIN WORLD MATE, NOT MINE, YOU CAN STICK IT UP UR ARSE, I DON'T WAN' IT!)

Now you bin tru the worst years, jail for years
And had to come face 2 face with the worst of your fears
Seen blood shed and sweaty old soldiers shed tears
If you cudn't stand the bang up with the maddest, the brers
Let 'em hang up, slit your wrist, nobody cares
Did you ever feel that there was duppies round you every where?
Dats rite blud, Ru gna take your life blud?
Theres no beta place and tonites the nite blud
Before you tie your neck on that pipe blud
Jus pass all your tings out the window, and swing 'em to the right blud
Rite blud?
Fuckin wid dis ting called life blud
I've never bin the one whose ever bin the rowdy type blud
From I was a nut gettin bust, I had to fight blud
And I can't see myself tryna giv up on life blud
Not light blud
I really wana see the light blud
I mean I wana fix up, and make tings rite blud
Now I wana fix my life blud
I mean I wana make tings rite blud
And see dat light blud

(Well, those are your options, and you've created 'em, you've brought it all upon youself...
Before you kick another door down, or you kick another chef in the bollocks)
