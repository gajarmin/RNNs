[Hook: Sage the Gemini]
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real (x3)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Your girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a sheik, I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spending this As-salamu alaykum, peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches, surfboard in high tide
I could just roll up cause I'm swoll up
So that birthday cake get the cobra
Bugatti for real, I'm cold bruh
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I set records, ratchets hold up
(I set records, ratchets hold up)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
And they already know me
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah my girl you never seen her
Cause my tints by limousines
My touch say it's the Midas
We the plus your man a minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough that's Bronchitis
Put your hands up
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers

[Hook]

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it

[Outro: Sage the Gemini]
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
They be speaking on what they don't know
Thye don't know because I keep it low
When I go low she tell me "way to go"
I make her act up, when I come back up
She says her feelings too strong, make her wanna back up
And I respond like "damn"
Believe me when I tell you why I agree
(Like damn) An hour later it was gon' be you or me
(Like damn) Now I don't wanna let you go
But there's something that you gotta know

[Pre-Hook: Nick Jonas]
This ain't nothing but dangerous
We about to be over it
Why can't it just be what it is
Why can't it be what it is
We’re both getting emotional
Same time getting so sexual
Why can’t it be what it is
Why can’t it be what it is

[Hook: Nick Jonas]
I know you know we know
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening
I know you know we know
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
I ain't never felt the way you make me feel
Continue so I know it's real
Think about me like I know you will
Fall for me, let it fall for me, give it all to me
Stand in the middle of the floor, throw your broad to me
This is real, yeah, this is real, let your guard down
This is good shit, ain't no time to call it off now
Now I don't wanna let you go, but there's something that you gotta know

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] x4[Intro x2: Sage The Gemini]
I know something you don't that's me coming for you
You want war, we got war, we just wanna warn you

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
War for war, bodies that hit the ground
You ready for us, cuz its about to go down
Push em to the left, push em to the right
Load them choppers up, hit em on sight
Never turning back, I've done been in hell and back
Me running out of guns, nah never heard of that
I ain't never ran from a gunfight
This is you and me Mano Y Mano your damn right

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Respiratory begging for relief, I don't let em breathe
Going hard I'm my own boss, many ain't believe
A feeling not an item appearing up out of thin air
Conquer everything that's in front of me now they under me
Rush to lead and respond, they strayed away how a tunnel be
Took a leap of faith bungee cord about to give out
Nowadays whatever you say you gotta live out
Altitude have a parachute failure we got a problem
Grow a set of wings or die when you hit the bottom
Never prayed to god, but never too late to try him
Shots fired, Allen Iverson in the league
They say I ball hog and I'm not a part of the team
Breadwinner with these winners, built the regime
Taliban weapon in hand, kill everything
Amphetamines all for the state of a better means
I'm beautiful but known for the dope like Medellin

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Future]
Dressing all black like a funeral
Murder, homicide wanna ride get residuals
Living on fire for residuals
365 when I grind for residuals
45 magnum in the van with em
Ratta tatta tat I let the blam hit em
I say fuck the whole world and put a bomb in it
Finger on the trigger til I put my whole arm in it
I just want revenge, I just want revenge
We get it poppin' everyday
They took away my happiness, they tryna take my head away
You walk at night, you walk at Glam
I'm bound to cause some problems with it

[Hook x2][Hook: Sage The Gemini]
She always complaining, she say I'm a player
Cars stupid fast, goodbye to my haters
Ballin' at the gym, now who wanna play us
Got a bad bitch, Guantanamera
Whoa Guantanamera
Whoa whoa Guantanamera
Whoa Guantanamera
Hey, hey, Guantanamera

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Guantanamera we in Venezuela
I don't know her name but I know where she came from
House so big I can't see my neighbors
I grab em and pass em, you try to save em
Whoa Guantanamera
Ridin' Audis through the hood, you know I be skatin'
Tiptoeing' in my Jordans soon as I lace em
Spent in all at the mall, it was Vuitton she lace 'em
Now I'ma go crazy, now baby you know that your looks are deceiving
I tell all these girl that I'm rich and don't need em and no one believes me
These niggas be mad, I be catching their baby girl looking and peeping
Take her home then I beat it till she sleeping, sleeping

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Pull up in a Benz screaming "fuck a hater!"
And nigga I done caught your bitch on an elevator
Nigga I done told your bitch I'ma fuck her later
And she gon' only get this dick, not no fuckin' paper
Vamanos, knock em all down like dominoes
Then I tell em adios
If you got a bad bitch and she suck a good dick
Better lock her pussy down and you call it Guantanamo
Huh, that pussy tryna run, call that cardio
This gon' be a lot of fun, moon turn to the sun
We gon' get it to tomorrow
Spend a couple car notes on a couple bottles
Yo the rich shit don't end
You don't wanna roll all along, tell your homies come on
And it's on, I'ma hit your friend
I'm cool with it if you cool with it
If you suck, spit and you drool with it
And I'ma be up in the hole all day
Guantanamo bay, Trey

[Hook: Sage The Gemini & Trey Songz]"H-h-h-h-holy shhh..."

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
You already know me, S-A-G-E
Look, ugh

[Hook][Intro]
(Ho-ho-ho-ho-holy shit)..

[Verse 1]
Uh, I got a bad girl let me bang like Kurt Co
Take 'em down, take 'em down to the first floor
Hoes waitin for a nigga on pluto
So why on earth would I be waitin' on you for?
I got a bad girl like everyday
Night time, mouth look like a sunny day
I'm in a new whip switchin' every other lane
While you walkin down the street switchin every other way
'Tryna find a nigga
But I better drive past you was raw out
Talkin' 'bout 'How long did it last?'
They want it bad and you know it don't you
But you know I got cash to put on it don't you -
Bitch

[Hook:]
"Yeah you're bad and you know it don't you
She always say 'Boy you know I don't want you' (want you)
You're bad and you know it don't you
Now you're single and you're bad and you know it, don't you
But it's good
You're bad and you know it don't you, (woah, woah, woah)
She always say 'Boy you know I don't want you' (want you)
You're bad and you know it don't you
Now you're single and you're bad and you know it, don't you
But it's good."

[Verse 2]
Umm
I'm 'bout to do me some bad girls heavy man
Still 'tryna get a girl from the seventh grade
It's like 'Damn why you teasin' me?'
Nice shape, and her face is Alicia Keys - yikes!
But I ain't trippin', there's bigger fishes to reel in
Relationships, but when does the 'real' come in?
Sleepin' on me like when does the pill kick in?
Been thuggin and it's over like Dave's shit, man
I been 'tryna make it better for your life
And you know I'm 'finna ask you out for dinner tonight
You lay back and enjoy it, don't you
But you know I got racks to put on it, don't you -
Bitch

[Hook]

"Yeah you're bad and you know it don't you
She always say 'Boy you know I don't want you' (want you)
You're bad and you know it don't you
Now you're single and you're bad and you know it, don't you
But it's good
You're bad and you know it don't you
She always say 'Boy you know I don't want you' (want you)
You're bad and you know it don't you

[Sage the Gemini]
That booty talkin' to me, what that shit say?

And I'm-a keep throwin money 'til your bank full
Cake-cake-cake-cake, birthday suit
Damn in a little I'm-a forget your age soon
Whoa, OK, now let's do it my way

And if she don't believe me tell that bitch just try me
Bet you she be shakin' from the club back to my place, whoa

[Hook]

[Sage]
I told her time to go to work, clock in
Go on open up, I'm a locksmith
West Side, tell them other people stop it
I'm fly, and that's why she headed to the cockpit
Black Money Sage, whoadie I'mma winner
I just play 'em like a game I don't press enter
I'm hella raw: listen to the way I did her
I was in her and her nigga was there makin' dinner
Uh, all this money start movin' and I'm-a throw it
She choosin' I got her lookin, hm is it ok?
Black Money we take 'em in and then quit it
We shake 'em and if she like me it's nothin, ok
Party hard, party hard with no party fouls
Couple girls in the back wit' some party mouths
Cave her back in, then turn the party out
Shake it like a red nose, time to let 'em out, whoa

[Hook]

[Outro]
All this money on me
All she tryna do is get naked, naked, naked, naked

But you look so different girl
You... You got your girls, I got my niggas
So you... should tell yo girls to come fuck with us

[Pre-Hook]
Come live in the fast lane
Bottles every night, whatever you like
Coz I do things
And you know my niggas keep that thing on the side
Coz a nigga wanna act strange
But this ain't about me, girl it's all about you
And I ain't just running game
I ain't running game

[Hook]

Neck frozen, wrist too
They ain't never seen a California igloo
My dude, on the magazine, for the issue
You better off tryin' to kick it like jujitsu

My momma, I ain't for the drama
From the seb, no beef, we're just tryna' get the commas

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My niggas pull off in this whip
Full speed to my after-hours

[Pre-Hook]

Hey Sage
(I would say I'm back but I never left)
I want you to talk that shit!

[Verse: Sage The Gemini]
Fuck your bullshit it really don't amaze me (Bay God!)
I'm on many niggas list trying to erase me
Tell a bitch nigga if them keys paid
You can be an automation clip it still won't faze me
I'm living girl, money fatter than Cartman
Talking shit from a distance like I don't know marksmen
Doing shit [?] like I'm social with corks and I'm really varsity
Rookie and [?] they like "How [?] ya'll got your [?]"
Ya'll the starting team
I was a ghost like [?]
Doing twerk songs bringing out hoes like that nigga Santa
Hating niggas man I can't stand them
So I pump fear and make them hold their chest like the national anthem
See ya'll done brought the Bay Area out
My niggas come from 2 ways like stereo out
Hop off a [?] black match
Carry them out
And Ooh Kill Em' like Terio account
It's real nigga
707 not 007
If you shut the fuck up it might save your ass from heaven
You ain't suffer, niggas don't understand me
[?] but only 2 pieces of cheese can feed the whole family
Yeah, nigga
They say don't forget where you came from or [?] doing stick ups
Fixing, some of these niggas be bitches
Hang a fruit by the foot and beat his ass till' he 6 inches
But, that ain't a gay joke
What's really funny is niggas think whips and chains they really Django
And I'mma shine on this music that's what it's made for
And I hope it's worth every dollar the people paid for
It's me

[Outro: DJ Drama]
You know that's just like a warm up type of thing

[Hook: Sage]
All this time I spent walking in deserts of mirages
All this time I spent walking in deserts of mirages

[Verse 1: Sage]
Putting time in the cup
For an unsteady hand to be patiently waiting to waste it, yeah
Never thought I’d have a girl run with two boyfriends
Leave her, get rich and now that bitch is chasing, yeah
Funny how the tables turn like DJ Experience
Same girls that turn me down
They trying to experiment, damn
Desert full of mirages
Think something is real
Come closer to know you lost it
I only love you for flossing
Riding for the rims that’s glossing
All they know is green
Watch NBA root for Boston
Never care what its costing
But are you good enough
You care neither by now you lost it, huh?
This thing called happiness Imma find you
Tired of cop lights being freedom til they behind you
All these songs talking about what’s on your wrist, how could it blind you?
When really blinding themselves from unsolved feelings inside you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Berner]
I can never love another dancer from the club
Or bring another friend around the plug
I lost a lot of money cause of trust
Eat a slug
A hundred grand flat
If you really need the dub
Back to fake friends when you’re broke
Imma laugh told you (shit)
And the other (shit) probably wouldn’t last
Pretty bitches and cash, this European is fast
This long flight got me up all night
Warm gin in my glass
I had the craziest past
A bunch of bitches nah
I was really in the A
I was getting them off
I might dip in it raw
But wouldn’t kiss it at all
Take a sniff of this to shit
And make you wiggle your jaw
We fell out and I ain’t seen you again
How you been?
Me, I’m thirty toes down in Las Vegas my friend
A new Benz, few spots
Cold bottle, two shots
Long walks got me thinking too much

[Hook]

[Bridge: Sage (Kehlani background vocals)]
All this time I spent walking in (desert of mirages)
All this time I spent (I spent) desert of mirages

You’re not unknown now
Ooo your love has got me (got me)
I just want to see (to see)
Yeah your love has got me (got me)

Eat your heart out used to take the bart out
To the city from my mom house, now I ball with my tongue out
Pull out my chain and think that the sun out
