[Hook]
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

[Verse 1]
(Now rapping basketball -- Number 1, Kurtis Blow)
Basketball is my favorite sport
I like the way they dribble up and down the court
Just like I'm the king on the microphone, so is Dr. J and Moses Malone
I like slam dunks, take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go
Cause it's basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I used to go to dinner, then take the girl
To see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl
And Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West
Play basketball at it's very best
Basketball has always been my thing
I like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King
And number 33, my man Kareem
Is the center on my starting team

(To the hoop, y'all, watch out, watch out
In yo' face, now here comes the rest)

[Verse 3]
Clyde, Rick Barry, and Pistol Pete
Now these players could never be beat
Isiah, and Iceman too
Just give 'em the ball, and then you chalk up two
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene
And Ralph Sampson is really mean
Bill Russell didn't take no junk
And Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk

[Verse 4]
Tell me, were you in the joint
The night Wilt scored 100 points?
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back
And didn't give nobody no kind of slack?
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team
With moves that came right out of a dream?
Or when Willis Reed stood so tall
Playing D with desire? It's basketball!

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I get the ball and then I go and play
Like a superstar in the NBA
The forwards, the centers, and all the guards
The ones you see on the bubblegum cards
Me and homeboy would go one-on-one
Cause playing the game is a lot of fun
Sit by the TV and watch 'em all
Cause Kurtis Blow is rapping basketball[Hook]
Clap your hands everybody
If you got what it takes
Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know
That these are the breaks

Breaks on a bus, brakes on a car
Breaks to make you a superstar
Breaks to win and breaks to lose
But these here breaks will rock your shoes
And these are the breaks
Break it up break it up break it up!

If your woman steps out with another man
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And she runs off with him to Japan
And the IRS says they want to chat
And you can't explain why you claimed your cat
And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill
With 18 phone calls to Brazil
And you borrowed money from the mob
And yesterday you lost your job
Well, these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up

Throw your hands up in the sky
And wave em round from side to side
And if you deserve a break tonight
Somebody say alright!
(All right) Say ho-oo!
(Ho-oo!) And you don't stop
Keep on, somebody scream!
(Owwwww!) Break down!

Breaks on a stage, breaks on a screen
Breaks to make your wallet lean
Breaks run cold and breaks run hot
Some folks got 'em and some have not
But these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down!

To the girl in brown, stop messing around
(Break it up, break it up!)
To the guy in blue, whatcha gonna do?
To the girl in green, don't be so mean
And the guy in red, say what I said
Break down!

Brakes on a plane, brakes on a train
Breaks to make you go insane
Breaks in love, breaks in war
But we got the breaks to get you on the floor
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down! Yo!

Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!

You say last week you met the perfect guy
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And he promised you the stars in the sky
He said his Cadillac was gold
But he didn't say it was 10 years old
He took you out to the Red Coach grill
But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill
And he told you the story of his life
But he forgot the part about...his wife! Huh! Huh!
Well, these are the breaks!
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down![Verse 1]
If I ruled the world, was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home
I'm not running for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see - first it was a dream, I was living in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the world ranked #1
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that, the King was in town
As I arrived the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, "The King is here!"
So I headed toward stage, to make a speech
About the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

[Hook]
If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls.. I love em love em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

[Verse 2]
People started flowing as they reached for my hand
I said, "Thank you for bringing me to the Promised Land
But now I must go, say goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party"
And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party
I was dancing to the beat and entertaining: "La-Di-Da-Di"
The music started ending, it was time for a speech
The crowd started sitting as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream; I explained to the crowd
But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud
Excuse me please for stopping this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and votes too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know hours passedI continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
Cause there's nothing in the world like being #1 king!

[Hook]

{AJ Scratch cuts up the track for a bit}

[Verse 3]
Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rolling with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker MC's that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'm rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love, and happiness
In a world of peace, and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's running the show
And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doing and listen to me
Cause we gotta stop war and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
Cause the African baby is dying overseas
While you sucker mission politicians busting out Z's
Huh, 20 million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe
And it's time for a CHANGE, to a better way
Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day
So LISTEN UP world, while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
The King who took my place was happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more[Intro]
[Storyteller]
'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house
[Kurtis Blow]
Hold it now! Wait, hold it. That's played out. Hit it!

[Verse 1]
Don't you give me all that jive about things you wrote before I's alive
Cause this ain't 1823 -- ain't even 1970
Now I'm the guy named Kurtis Blow and Christmas is one thing I know
So every year just about this time, I celebrate it with a rhyme

Gonna shake it, gonna bake it, gonna make it good
Gonna rock shock clock it through your neighbourhood
Gonna read, gonna sing it till it's understood
My rappin' bout to happen like a knee you've been slapping
Or a toe you've been tapping on a hunk of wood

Bout a red-suited dude with a friendly attitude
And a sleigh full of goodies for for the people on the block
Got a long white beard, maybe looks kind a weird
And if you ever see him, he could give you quite a shock

Now people let me tell ya bout last year
When the dude came flying over here
Well, the hog was out, snow's on the ground
Folks stayed in to party down
The beat was thumping on the box, and I was dancing in my socks
And the drummer played at a solid pace
And a taste of the bass was in my face
And the guitar player layed down a heavy layer
Of the funky junky rhythm of the disco beat
And the guy with the 88's started to participate
And I could sure appreciate a sound so sweat

We were all in the mood so we had a little food
And a joke, and a smoke, and a little bit of wine
When I thought I heard a hoof on the top of the roof
Could it be or was it me? I was feeling super fine
So I went to your attic where I thought heard the static
On the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in
But the noise on the top was a reindeer clop
Just a trick St. Nick, and I let the sucker in

He was roly, he was poly, and I said, "Holy moly!
You got a lot of whiskers on your chinny chin chin"
He allowed he was proud of the hairy little crowd
On the point of his jaw where the skin should've been
Gets cool for a fool going out every Yule
For a day on a sleigh when the cold went low
So the beard may be weird but I'll never have it sheared
Cause it's warm in the storm when it's ten below

I said, "You're right, it's cold tonight
But can you stop for a drop before you go?"
He said, "Why not if the music's hot?
And I'll chance a dance beneath the mistletoe"
So he went downstairs and forgot his guests
And he rocked the spot and danced like a pro
And every young girl tried to rock his world
But he boogie oogie oogied til he had to go

And before he went, this fine old gent
Brought a gift with a sift through his big red bags
In the top or the bottom, he reached in and got 'em
Toys for the boys, for the girls glad rags
And the grownups got some presents too
A new TV and a stereo
A new Seville bout as blue as the sky
The best that money couldn't buy
Cause money could never ever buy the feeling
The one that comes from not concealing
The way you you feel about your friends
And this is how the story ends

The dude in red's back at the Pole
Up north where everything is cold
But if he were right here tonight
He'd say, Merry Christmas and to all a good nightBrrrrrr stick 'em
Ha ha ha stick 'em
Brrrrrr stick 'em
Ha ha ha stick 'em
Brrrrrr stick 'em
Ha ha ha stick 'em

Get ready all people for the future shock

Hard times (Hard times)
To the bridge

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]

[Repeat Verse 4]

[Bridge][Intro]
There are 8 million stories in the naked city

8 million stories
8 million stories (Cold-hearted city)
8 million stories (Watch your back)
8 million stories

[Verse 1: Kurtis Blow]
There are 8 million stories in the naked city
Some ice cold and told without pity
About the mean streets and the ghetto culture
The pimps, the pushers, the sharks and vultures
Things that happen when it reaches dark
And all the things you hear about Central Park
You got to be down, you got to have strength
If you're gonna survive past 110th
Well it ain't no thing when blood is spilled
The emergency ward is capacity filled
And nothing ever comes as a big surprise
And the naked city never closes its eyes
A new story every day
Told a thousand different ways
That's how it is and that's how it goes
The city with the 8 and six big O's

New York is a crazy city man
Word, skyscrapers, everything
And you just never know who you might be meting in this town
Yo, my home boys Run DMC

[Verse 2: Run DMC]
A young girl seemed to be gaining weight
Her parents all thought it was the food she ate
Their attitudes were all "La Di Da Di"
But little did they know there's a baby in the body
She tried to hide it, but they'll soon know
Because sooner or later that baby's got to show
Can her daddy just accept it as a fact
That it wasn't the meals and it wasn't the snack
Then there's another girl, her name is Vicki
The girl is fine, but sho'nuff tricky
Vicki's fine, but then she's not very kind
She'll lay you down and then she'll rob you blind
You wake up in the morning and you're feeling blue
Because Vicki is gone and your money is too
She's more sinister than Peter Lorre
And this is just two of 8 million stories

8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories (You hear what i'm saying)
8 million stories (Homeboys and girlies)
8 million stories
8 million stories

8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories (Sing)
8 million stories (Sing the song)
8 million stories
8 million stories

[Verse 3: Kurtis Blow]
Fresh kid and the stories complete
Born on a dim lit ghetto street
Father unknown, mother astray
He learned about life the real hard way
Wearing pretty things for all the ladies to see
Funky fresh diamonds and gold jewelry
Spent all his time just counting his bank
Because he's a fly muh-ha-ha, now fill in the blank
Because he's a fresh kid and his money's long
Been the subject of a ghetto song
Poor kids admire, ladies desire
They say water can't put out this fire
Because he's a fresh kid, yeah he's alright
Grew up with the pushers and the pimps of the night
And you could measure or even treasure
The thought that cocaine became his pleasure
Peruvian rock never cut with speed
And he gets skied until his nose would bleed
And that was just one weakness, must admit
That when he took a hit he could never quit
Because he's one slick pusher living day by day
When the crazy thing happened along the way
You know he started to base at a hell a pace
And now it's a disgrace, he's got the pipe in his face
For twenty-four seven a terrible Jones
Didn't take care of business, didn't answer the phone
He stayed home alone all in the twilight zone
Just biting on a pipe like a dog on a bone
Turning blue in the face, by holding his breath
With the white cloud bullshit stuck in his chest
But then he tried to stop, but it never worked
And then the ladies started calling him a freebase jerk
Just to break it all down, you know he's not very slick
Because he spent all his money and he spent it real quick
He lost his car, his house, his friends, his wife
And basing cocaine made him lose his life
Because he bought some on credit and couldn't pay
And then the pusher looked for him and blew him away
In a blaze of glory in his own territory
8 million stories sad but all real stories

8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories (You hear what i'm saying)
8 million stories (Homeboys and girlies)
8 million stories
8 million stories (Sing)
8 million stories (Sing the song)
8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories(intro)
One,two,three,four...hit it

(verse one)

Up in the Bronx,where the people are fresh
There was one DJ who had to pass the test
And now he's down by law and he's ready to play
That's right, y'all, his name is AJ
Never gets nervous when he cuts the beat
Top notch service in the clutch on the street
A complete elite treat that can't be beat
Because AJ never knew the agony of defeat

(chorus)

AJ,I wanna see you (X4)
Kurtis Blow (scratch)

(verse two)

Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa
Starsky, Spoonie Gee and Run DMC
Gotta realize that he goes way back
And now he's down with the king
And we could never be whack
So just kick off you shoes and relax your feet
And rock to the rhythm of the Kurtis Blow beat
Yes,yes,y'all and just shake butt
Because AJ is gonna cut it up

(chorus)

Clap your hands (scratch)[Hook]
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

[Verse 1]
(Now rapping basketball -- Number 1, Kurtis Blow)
Basketball is my favorite sport
I like the way they dribble up and down the court
Just like I'm the king on the microphone, so is Dr. J and Moses Malone
I like slam dunks, take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go
Cause it's basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I used to go to dinner, then take the girl
To see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl
And Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West
Play basketball at it's very best
Basketball has always been my thing
I like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King
And number 33, my man Kareem
Is the center on my starting team

(To the hoop, y'all, watch out, watch out
In yo' face, now here comes the rest)

[Verse 3]
Clyde, Rick Barry, and Pistol Pete
Now these players could never be beat
Isiah, and Iceman too
Just give 'em the ball, and then you chalk up two
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene
And Ralph Sampson is really mean
Bill Russell didn't take no junk
And Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk

[Verse 4]
Tell me, were you in the joint
The night Wilt scored 100 points?
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back
And didn't give nobody no kind of slack?
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team
With moves that came right out of a dream?
Or when Willis Reed stood so tall
Playing D with desire? It's basketball!

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I get the ball and then I go and play
Like a superstar in the NBA
The forwards, the centers, and all the guards
The ones you see on the bubblegum cards
Me and homeboy would go one-on-one
Cause playing the game is a lot of fun
Sit by the TV and watch 'em all
Cause Kurtis Blow is rapping basketball[Intro]

I'm gonna keep on fighting 'till my very last breath
Hard times (Hard times)
Hard times (Hard times)
To the bridge

[Bridge]

[Repeat Verse 4]

[Bridge][Verse 1]
If I ruled the world, was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home
I'm not running for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see - first it was a dream, I was living in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the world ranked #1
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that, the King was in town
As I arrived the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, "The King is here!"
So I headed toward stage, to make a speech
About the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

[Hook]
If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls.. I love em love em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

[Verse 2]
People started flowing as they reached for my hand
I said, "Thank you for bringing me to the Promised Land
But now I must go, say goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party"
And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party
I was dancing to the beat and entertaining: "La-Di-Da-Di"
The music started ending, it was time for a speech
The crowd started sitting as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream; I explained to the crowd
But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud
Excuse me please for stopping this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and votes too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know hours passedI continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
Cause there's nothing in the world like being #1 king!

[Hook]

{AJ Scratch cuts up the track for a bit}

[Verse 3]
Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rolling with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker MC's that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'm rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love, and happiness
In a world of peace, and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's running the show
And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doing and listen to me
Cause we gotta stop war and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
Cause the African baby is dying overseas
While you sucker mission politicians busting out Z's
Huh, 20 million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe
And it's time for a CHANGE, to a better way
Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day
So LISTEN UP world, while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
The King who took my place was happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once moreI see that its not clear
For you good buddy so clean out your ears
So listen very closely while I pop my game
Cause my name's in the Hall of Fame

The K-U-R, the T-I-S
The first is the best I must confess
The B-L-O and the W
Makes you wanna catch the boogaloo flu

Now, If your name is Annie
Get up off your fannie
If your name is Clyde
Get off your backside
If you name is Pete
You don't need a seat

Cause i'm Kurtis Blow and i'm on the go
I'm rocking to the beat in stere-ery-ooh!

Now just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if your ready like Freddie to rock real steady
Somebody say, "Oh yeah!"

Young ladies, all the ladies in the house say, "Owww"
And you don't stop, come on, come on, come on, let me see you rock

Ah get down and stop messing around
When Kurtis Blow is in your town
I'm Kurtis Blow on the microphone
A place called Harlem was my home

I was rocking one day, it started to shake
It sound to me a-like a earthquake
I packed my bags, I said goodbye
I kissed my woman, and I started to fly

I came to Earth by a meteorite
To rock you all on the mic
So just kick off your shoes, let your fingers pop
Kurtis Blow's just about ready to rock

Now people in the back, if you're not too whack, say:
"Don't stop the body rock!"

People in the front, if you want to bump, say:
"Don't stop the body rock!"

People in the middle, if you want to wiggle, say:
"Don't stop the body rock!"

And people on the side, if you want to slide, say:
"Don't stop the body rock!"

Now a preacher or a teacher or a e-lec-tri-cian
A fighter, or a writer, or a po-li-ti-cian
The man with the key to your ignition
Kurtis Blow is competition

Young ladies, shock the house
Yes, the young ladies, shock the house

A-just throw your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

If you're really, really ready to rock this house this morning
Somebody say, "Oh yeah!"

Somebody scream

Young ladies, Mercedes, all the ladies in the house say "ow"
"Ow"

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho-ho-ho![The Human Beat Box]
Yo hook my mic up please, make- Kurt- make the bass come out so clear
(C'mon!) Please... I'm asking you, KB
Ready?
[Prince Markie Dee] Yeah, ready?

Fat Boys!

[Prince Markie Dee]
Brrr, Stick 'em!

[Kool Rock-Ski]
Where the fresh beats and rhymes collide
[?] and the Fat Boys 'bout to get ready for [?]
We keep it up, no slack
You guessed it: the Fat Boys are back
[Prince Markie Dee] With Prince
And Kool
[Prince Markie Dee] And The Human Beat Box one time in your mind

[Prince Markie Dee]
Amazing to the eye, devastating to the ear
And if you've never seen him, you'll wonder where
His beats come from: machine or man?
He's also cutting up cause he's in command

[Prince Markie Dee]
Now, my name is Markie Dee and I'm on the go
And to the miscalculations, I'ma let you know
That I'm prince of rap, the king of hip-hop
And when my mouth starts to moving, I will not stop
Cause I'm all the way live, with so much juice
You should check out the Prince as I start to get loose
Capital P, bad as can be, can't no other MC mess with me
Because I travel to places where MCs are mean
Where their eyes turn red and their tongues turn green
Some of them fat and some quite lean
But they all step back when I'm on the scene
Because I make 'em, break 'em, wake up, or shake 'em
Slap icing on the top and sure enough bake 'em
I can grease the pan, I got the juice the girls
That five-foot-eight with natural curls
And Kool Rock, Kool Rock-Ski, I heard you're in the place to be

[Kool Rock-Ski]
Kool Rock-Ski, as you can see
Master of disaster, the chief of [?]
And when I'm on the mic I'm making [?] rhymes
Hip-hop often, I'm qualified
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
Bolder than bad, I'm badder than bold
I'm on the microphone, in complete control
With The Human Beat Box on the side of me
Guaranteed to rock the rhythm, make you move your feet
I'm like that, y'all, I'm like this, y'all
And when I fire my bomber I never miss

[Beatbox interlude]

Fat Boys![Hook]
Clap your hands everybody
If you got what it takes
Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know
That these are the breaks

Breaks on a bus, brakes on a car
Breaks to make you a superstar
Breaks to win and breaks to lose
But these here breaks will rock your shoes
And these are the breaks
Break it up break it up break it up!

If your woman steps out with another man
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And she runs off with him to Japan
And the IRS says they want to chat
And you can't explain why you claimed your cat
And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill
With 18 phone calls to Brazil
And you borrowed money from the mob
And yesterday you lost your job
Well, these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up

Throw your hands up in the sky
And wave em round from side to side
And if you deserve a break tonight
Somebody say alright!
(All right) Say ho-oo!
(Ho-oo!) And you don't stop
Keep on, somebody scream!
(Owwwww!) Break down!

Breaks on a stage, breaks on a screen
Breaks to make your wallet lean
Breaks run cold and breaks run hot
Some folks got 'em and some have not
But these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down!

To the girl in brown, stop messing around
(Break it up, break it up!)
To the guy in blue, whatcha gonna do?
To the girl in green, don't be so mean
And the guy in red, say what I said
Break down!

Brakes on a plane, brakes on a train
Breaks to make you go insane
Breaks in love, breaks in war
But we got the breaks to get you on the floor
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down! Yo!

Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!

You say last week you met the perfect guy
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And he promised you the stars in the sky
He said his Cadillac was gold
But he didn't say it was 10 years old
He took you out to the Red Coach grill
But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill
And he told you the story of his life
But he forgot the part about...his wife! Huh! Huh!
Well, these are the breaks!
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down!Intro:
I don't want a lot,I want just enough
So why has it got to be so damn TOUGH

Livin' on the uptown side of jive
Hustlin' a buck to stay alive
Lookin' for a ten and they give your five
Well it's tough
You talk to the boss,the boss is gruff
You ask for a raise and they call your bluff
You may get some,but it's never enough
Because it's tough

STRONG:Like a magnum force
ROUGH:Like a new divorce
MEAN:Like a three-time loser
BAD:Like an L.A. cruiser
DOWN:Like a limousine
BLIND:Like a submarine
HARD:Like cold concrete
TOUGH:That's the rhythm of the beat

You hit the street and you look for work
You don't want to be some welfare jerk
But I wonder how you get to be Captain Kirk
It's tough
Now Kirk has a ship called the Enterprise
He cuts the aliens down to size
But I wonder what he'd do with the uptown guys
They're tough

TOUGH:
Try to get some cash
When you're looking for a raise and they give you trash

ROUGH:
When you got it like that
And your woman's running 'round with a baseball bat

HARD:
Try to play it cool when the girl's all know you're an out of work fool

TOUGH:
How it seems to be,wish I had somebody lookin' out for me

Try to find a lover if you dare
Even if you do she just won't care
Well no one ever said that that life is fair
Because it's tough
Saw a fine young lady the other day
I started my rap,I had a lot to say
But she said she was goin' with a C.P.A
Now it's tough

STRONG:Like a superhero
ROUGH:Like a bank book zero
MEAN:Like the Oakland Raiders
BAD:Like the Caped Crusaders
DOWN:Like a homerun ball
BLIND:Like an umpire's call
HARD:Like a cruel deceit
TOUGH:That's the rhythm of the beat

You worked all year to buy a brand new car
A Coupe de Ville or a Jaguar
But you didn't make enough for a good cigar
Because it's tough
So you went to the bank to try to get a loan
But the guy behind the desk had a heart os stone
He said "You don't need a car,use the telephone!"
It's tough

TOUGH:
It's a way of life,lost your job
Your money,but not your wife

ROUGH:
Gettin' in the black,Uncle Sam's in your pocket
And your woman's on your back

HARD:
That's the deal,had to get a loan just to buy a meal

TOUGH:
That's how it goes,when it's gettin' better,nobody knows

STRONG:Like Chocolate Thunder
ROUGH:Like Stevie Wonder
MEAN:Like Brucie The Shark
BAD:Like the Raider's Ark
DOWN:Like Sugar's Glove
BLIND: Like a man in love
HARD:Like a big defeat
TOUGH:That's the rhythm of the beat

TOUGH:That's the word,unemployment is all I heard
ROUGH:When you start your day,watch the finance man tow your car away
HARD:To hold a job when you've been replaced by a little blue knob
TOUGH:Like a dollar steak,ain't someone ever gonna give me a break

Tough.....(Intro)
One for the trouble,two for the bass
Check me out while I rock this place

(CHORUS)
Under fire
Take it higher
Desire
Under fire

(VERSE ONE)
Hello party people,I'm Kurtis Blow
King of the rap and a 10 years pro
The ladies heart stopper,the fly guys best
A sureshot rocker and I'm always fresh
But when I try make it,they try to take it
And it ain't in my nature just to fake it
So bust my moves,you'll never stop me
I'm the best MC,I could never be

(CHORUS)

(VERSE TWO)
Here I am rappin',they call me the king
But there's more to me than just doing my thing
Wanna move ahead,got to make a choice
Got to make this planet hear my voice
Lebanon,Russia,Iraq and Iran
Too many people dyin' playing Superman
Be cool,don't be no fool
Please Mr.Reagan don't put me

(CHORUS)

(VERSE THREE)
I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to see
To make it today we need unity
Do not fear reality
Cause they can't stop what was meant to be(Even under fire)

Trying hard to make through the easy way of life
Thinking you can fake it with a pistol or a knife
You live it,you give it,you do it,you blew it
And then you want to tell everybody you knew it
It's easy to point your fingers
And say you and you and you're wrong
But when it's time to be about unity
Huh-huh-huh you sing another song

Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby,baby

Well I am the member of a new breed
And the solution is a revolution
So I hope you all see the light
Hear my name....Unite!To the next phase

K-U-R-T-I-S B-L-O-W what you wanna do(x2)

Under fire (x2)

K-U-R-T-I-S B-L-O-W what you wanna do(x12)[Verse 1]
A cute one, a shy one
A slim one, a sly one
A big one, a small one
A real of the all one

[Chorus]
All I want in this world is to find that girl

[Verse 2]
A long one, a lean one
I just didn't be clean one
A short one, a tall one
I didn't need at all one

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've searched this fine world over
Tryin' to find someone
A New York to California
On a journey that's only begun
I've been the Maine to Mimphis
The Motor City to LA
And you might think I get this girl is
But I know that I'll find her some day

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Girl I know you out there somewhere and there's one thing I want you to know
I believe that for every man there's a girl and you're the girl for me
And I know it may take a long, long time but I'm gonna get right on tryin'
Bacause you just never ever really know, you may be half-way round the world
Or you may be, you may be right here, right here tonight

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]I know your last man did you wrong
And I know you and your mama don't quite get along
And I know you'd help with the bills if you could
And I know that your intentions are basically good
But there's one more thing that I definitely know

It's baby,you've got to go

And I'm sure you'd cook if you knew how to use a pot
And I'm sure you'd clean if the soaps weren't so hot
And I'm sure you'd mop the floors if you weren't afraid of hot water
And I'm sure you do the laundry if you only had a quarter
And I'm sure that I wish that it just wasn't so

But baby,you've got to go

And I know that you want a career in high fashion
Cause when you buy your clothes you do it with passion
Well that's chilly by me,you do what you will
But when you're finished,don't send me the bill
Cause Halston and Jordache got enough of my dough

So baby,you've got to go

I'm sure you've got problems I can't understand
And I'm sure it's because I'm only a man
And I'm sure if I had an astounding I.Q
I could solve all the problems that happen to you
But I ain't no genius,I just take it slow

So baby,you've got to go

Now I know you're worried about what Erica will do tomorrow
But that won't help pay back the money you borrow
And I know that each person must be someplace my dear
But I really don't know why you must be here
So this is the day for your last tale of woe

Cause baby,you've got to goDon't you get me all that JIVE about things you wrote before I's
Alive
Cause this ain't 1823 ain't even 1970
Now I'm the guy named Kurtis Blow and Christmas is one thing I know
So every year, just about this time , I celebrate it with a rhyme:
Gonna shake it, gonna bake it, gonna make it good
Gonna rock shock rock through your neighborhood
Gonna ring it, gonna sing it till it's understood
My rap's about to happen, like the knee you was slappin;
Or the toe you been tappin' on a hunk of wood
'Bout a red suited dude, with a friendly attitude and a sleigh full
Of goodies for for the people on the block. Got a long white beard
Maybe looks kind of weird, and if you ever seen him he could give a
Quite shock. Now people let me tell ya about last year when the
Dude came flying over here, Well the hawk was out the snow's on the
Ground, folks stayed into party down. The beat was thumping on the
Blcok, and I was dancing in my sockS, and the drummer played at a
Solid pace, and a taste of the base was in my face. And the guitar
Laid down a heavy layer of the funky junky rhythm of the
Disco Beat. And the guy with the 88 started to participate, and I
Could Sure appreciate it sound so sweat

We were all in the mood so we had a little food, and a joke, and a
Smoke, and a little bit of wine, when I thought I heard a hoof on
Top of the roof. Could it be or was it me, I was feeling super
Fine. So I went to the attic where I thought heard the static
On a chance that the prance was somebody breaking in. But the
Noise on the top was a reindeer clop, Just a trick St. Nick, and I
Let the sucker in

He was roly, he was Poly and not the holy moly, you got a lot of
Whiskers on your chinny, chin, chin. He allowed, he was proud of
The hairy little crowd on the point of the door where the skin
Should've been
Get's cool for a fool throwin' out every you for a day on sleigh
Where the cold winds blow. So the beard maybe cleared
But I never have a cheered cause it's warm in the storm when it's
Ten below

I said you're right it's cold tonight
Can you stop for a drop before you go?
He said why not if the music'S hot and I'll chance a dance beneath
The mistletoe
So he went downstairs and forgot his cares and he rocked the spot
And danced like a
Pro
And every young girl tried to rock his world
But he boogie oogie oogied till he had to go
And before he went this fine old gent
Finding gifts went to sift through his big red bags
In the top for the bottom he reached in and got toys ?-------? on a
Girls flat rag
And the grownups got some presents too
A new TV and a stere-u. A new Seville 'bout as blue as the sky
The best that money couldn't buy
Cause money could never ever buy the feelin
The one that comes from not concealin
The way you feel about your friends
And this is how the story ends

The dude ya reads back at the pole
Up north where everything is cold
But if he were right here tonight
He'd say merry Christmas and to all a good night[D-Rock]
Ayo what's up, my name is D-Rock the number one
I'm here to celebrate the first annual

**crowd cheering and clapping**Looking back through time in the corners of my mind
I see you standing here
Oh baby how I miss you
And how much I need to kiss you
Run my fingers through your hair
But then again,it's just my imagination
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation

Daydreamin' takes me where I want to be
Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me

Oh,girl if you knew all that I've been going through
You'd have a change of heart
But come rain or shine you're foverer on my mind
Of my life you're the part
But then again,it's just my imagination
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation

Daydreamin' takes me where I want to be
Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me

Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
You stole my heart and I belong to you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
You are the one and I will be true

D...D...D...D...Daydreamin' (x4)

You know I want you girl
You know I miss you girl
Come back,come back baby..oo-wee,be my lady
You know I miss you girl
You were my only world
Come back,come back honey
Make my day bright and sunny...yeah

Come back ...honey....Chorus:
Fallin',fallin',back in love
I'm back in love again
I say I'm back,back in love again
I say I'm back,right back in love again

Suddenly it's happening again
I'm walking along the seashore
Building castles in the sand
And suddenly all my dreams have come true
And if at all love is the question
Then girl the answer's you
I feel I'm fallin'.....

(chorus)

Back in love,I'm back in love again
I tried to fight as best I can
It seems to happen every now and then
I'm falling back in love,I'm back in love again
So many times love's broke my heart
But it seems to me it's time to start again

(chorus)

Shadows dancing all across my wall
I called your name but it was all in vain
Because it wasn't you at all
So, I had to find you
Some way my love some how
And now my dear since you are here
Tell me how do you like me now
That I'm fallin'.......

(chorus)

You and me,for eternity will always be in love
You and me,for eternity will always be in love
You know I want you girl,you know  I need yoo baby
Yes you,you,I need you,you know I want you girl
You know I need you baby you got me back in love

(chorus)Brrrrrr stick 'em
Ha ha ha stick 'em
Brrrrrr stick 'em
Ha ha ha stick 'em
Brrrrrr stick 'em
Ha ha ha stick 'em
Gonna rock the beat box in a fresh funky rhythm

And we’ll repeat it if we have to – once or twice
We’re gonna take it from the bottom and straight to the top

The man with the beats to cause a disaster
The man who’s overtop, guaranteed to rock
From a positive source, it’s the Human Beat Box
With a million watts of power coming out his mouth
Making all the young ladies want to scream and shout
With a thousand beats for every day of the week
So come on Beat Box – play one for me

You now the passion is great
The beats are clear
The people are drawn
From far and near
We’re fierce
Fresh
Kicking it live
And we’re pumped at the party from 9 to 5
So if you want a sound that’ll fit you to a tee
Listen to the sounds of the Disco 3I'm about to squeeze off on everyone that I know
Cause every time they see me they ask for dough
They think I'm rich cause my name is Kurtis Blow

I can't stand it,I can't take it no more

(I can't stand it,I can't take it no more) (x4)

I can't take it no more (x4)

Lookin' out my window five stories up
I see a wino with a bottle he don't need a cup
And there's a hooker in the alley way
Takin' a chance,tryin' to make a days pay
But the rats in the alley are takin' a stand
Chewin' on somethin' that used to be a man

I can't stand it,I can't take it no more (x2)

I can't take it no more (x4)

Gun shots just up the block
By a kid whose head is hard as a rock
A lady with a baby who was crossing the street
Gets hit by a bullet and falls off her feet
The people gather round,the baby is crying
The ambulance is late and the lady is dying
The trigger happy did not step off that day
But the lady with the baby was a D-O-A

I can't stand it,I can't take it no more (x2)

I can't take it no more (x8)I was walkin' down the avenue the other day
When I heard this crazy sound
It was nothing but a  guy with a set of drums
But he was really gettin' down
He said my name is Jack and I'm a rhythm attack
When I got a pair of sticks in hand
I got savior-faire on the bass and snare
And I'm here to take my stand
I got juice

The next to show was a guy named Joe
Came in from Kalamazoo
Had a Kango cap with a real smooth rap
And he knew just what to do
He was an outta work bricklayer,part-time conga player
Brought along a set of LP's
Don't do a lot of talkin',let my fingers do the walkin'
And I play just as pretty as you please
I got juice

There was a guy with a bass,had a handsome face
And designer clothes all around
He said I'm into threads,don't wear Pro Keds
But I can make that funky sound
I play Fender Jazz,I got razz-ma-tazz
I got style from head to toe
It's a funky sound that I learned uptown
And I'm here to let you know
I got juice

About a minute went by when another guy
Showed up with an old guitar
Well it hard to be from World War III
Or run over by a car
It don't look like much,but it's sweet to touch
They don't make'em like this today
It's been around,but check the sound
Then see what you say
I got juice

There was a dude with a bongo,came from the Congo
Had a rough beat of his own
He dressed real strangle,wore beads and chains
But he could rock you all alone
He said call me Chief and I've got relief
For those weary dancin' blues
I got jungle heat from a primative beat
And I know I'll move your shoes,HUH-HUH
I got juice

The next to show was Kurtis Blow
With timbales in his hands
Well I'm known for rap and I play with snap
And I think you'll understand
Now I was taught to play in a different way
By a dude known as Delgado
He said listen to me and you soon will be
A timbale desparato
I got juice

What do you say when you're bustin' loose
JUICE,JUICE
It's good for the gander and chilly for the goose
JUICE,JUICE
Breakin' out from that weekday noose
JUICE,JUICE
Gettin' down on the one and up on the deuce
JUICE.JUICE
