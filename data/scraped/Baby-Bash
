[Intro: Jonn Hart]
P-P-P-Papi
P-P-P-Papi

[Verse 1: Jonn Hart]
She wake me up with the head like top of the morning
You know I love to make it clap clap like we in New Orleans
Back it up on me, yeah she like to ride like a mothafuckin' G
Put both those off, oh
If I'm mobbin', she mobbin'
No problem it's just us
If I'm all out, she all in
She keep a nigga up
Better act like you know
She'd catch a case for me
Ride or die for sure
You know what it is, yeah

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
She love to call me papi (yes sir)
Hold it down shorty cool as fuck
She love to call me papi (whoa)
She love to call me papi (yes sir)
Catch a fade if a bitch act up
She love to call me papi (whoa)
Oh whoa oh

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Yeah she love to call me Chulo, chew low
Cuz she know I'm the numero uno
And she know when I tap that culo
I'ma give it to her heavy like sumo
And she know that I'm on my grind
So in a few hours I'll be on my way
So every minute is quality time
She gon' sip that wine
I'ma smoke mine babe
So if you've ever had a Spanish girl give you love
You could know exactly what I'm thinkin' of
And if you turn the music down she gon' turn it up
Watch her on the dance floor, she gon' burn it up
Move her body and she turn me on
In the bed I'ma serve her long
And she could take it all night
The way daddy put it down, get her head right

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Baeza]
See I met her back in high school
She the one I never lied to, yeah yeah
The type you always need beside you
Call her whenever and she gon' slide thru
She hold the heat when it's gettin' hot
She roll the weed and then we gettin' gone
She look at me and then she gettin' on
Good sex til the morning
She wet and she moaning
Leave her scent on my clothes
I don't wanna leave
She a tease with them poses
Ooh, but I'm already knowin'
Don't do it girl, I'm already growin'
She want another round
I say, "fuck it" then I'm goin' in
It's alright, oh boy she just might
Get a playa in the game to reside
Cuz nothin' better than a girl that's down to ride

[Hook][Intro: Frankie J.]
So tight, so fly
You got me lifted
You got me lifted

[Hook: Frankie J]
Got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooohwee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly

[Bridge: Baby Bash]
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watchin' screens gettin' high
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Off top, I can't lie, I love to get blowed
You my little sugar, I'm your little chulo
And every time we kick it
It's off to the groovy
Treat you like my sticky ickey
Or my sweet oooh-wee, gooey (Fa real, though)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Baby Bash
Now, I ain't worried about a thang cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a superfly chick
And uh-uh ad there ain't nothin' you can say to a player
Cause doo wop
She fly like the planes in the air
That's right, she full grown, settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' her ozone
So fly, like a dove, fly, like a raven
Quick, to politic with some fly, conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools, blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Barada
Rockin' Dolce & Gabbana, with hydro in a Cubana

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Baby Bash]
Fa real, though

[Hook]

[Baby Bash]
So high, like I'm a star
So high, like I'm a star
So high, like I'm a star
So high, like I'm a star
Azucar[Intro]
Yeah..
Yeeeahhhh
Uhmmm

[Hook: Baby-E]
Light up, light up
Strike a match and watch the flames burn bright
Light up, light up
Breathe deep and let it clear your mind
When you start feeling down, light one up, pass it 'round
Keep your chin up and head high cause nothing's forever
Light up, light up
Breathe deep and put it in the sky

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
I'm never drinking and driving, I'm only smoking and flying
Too many dying, alcohol related death's multiplying
So you know, we gotta keep it in perspective
Get my point across, like a boss and make sure that mi gente gets the message
I'm just gonna blow up on this fire, who got the lighter?
You want that sherbert OG Kush, that cookie gets you higher
Need no crazy pills, they give me no crazy thrills
That's cause how a playa feels, I'm smoking until the wheels fall off
Yeah, and that's how we keep it lifted
California fine's are organically engifted
I'm in love with Mary Jane, some call it that Marichuana
I'm the one you call when you need that good ganja

[Hook: Baby-E]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Uuuuuh
Inhale, exhale, fucking right I love it
I got murder munchies, Iâ€™ll die without chicken McNuggets
Used to buy bags, now I bring it back in buckets
The fuck is this a seed? My nigga, you must be bucking
I don't smoke less than OG Kush bitch
Y'all boys smoking on that bull shit
Probably ain't even coughing off none of that
If I was you, I wouldn't even much none of that
Can't even smell it when it's burning, that's that lil boy shit
I'm a grown man, I don't smoke with lil boys bitch
Super Sour Mix with that cookie
Veteran lungs since day one, I've never been a rookie
Plain RAW papers, or RAW paper cones
If I add a styrofoam cup I ain't gon' make it home
I'm just saying I'm so gone, I don't even know where I'm suppose to be at
How the fuck we suppose to be sober when Mary Jane everywhere we at

[Hook: Baby-E]

[Verse 3: Berner]
Cookie smoke in the air, there's police everywhere
Yeah I smoke where I want, now I don't really care
Will I share? I don't know
If I'm down? I'm in town for a week
Let's go half on that pound, yeah I only want that loud
Yo, we don't make a sound that ain't good
No swishas, no woods, bong hits if we could
Roll another one, think we should
You can smell it through the bag
I made it killing off the wax, so wanna take another dab?

Chorus: Mickael
She moves her body like a
Cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all
Night long
Going hard, when they turn the spot
Lights on
Because she moves her body like a
Cyclone

Cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all
Night long
Going hard, when they turn the spot
Lights on
Because she moves her body like a
Cyclone

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
Now look at that
Dumper on the back of that bumper
She ain't even
Playing when she shaking that rumpa
And, oh, you ain't
Know, she get lower than a muffler
Either with her girlfriends
Or showstoppin' with her hustler
The way she move her body, she might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me, tryin' to show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy, always tighten, never sloppy
And got an entourage and her own paparazzi
Now, there she go
Again, ridin' through the stormy weather
You better button
Up, if you wanna go get her
Cause it is
What it is, everybody wanna love her
But when she
Pop it, boy, you better run for cover {*thunder*}

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
It's a rap
When she breakin' boys off the typhoon (It's a rap)
Gotta get that feri like a boss Tycoon (It's a rap)
Now hold it steady, cause she make a monsoon (It's a rap)
Now you can Google, download to iTunes
See, what I'm sayin', she ain't playin', bet she got the mans turnin'
You gon' hear 'em clack-clack, when them heels get to burnin'
Stiletto so fuego
She got her own label
And got us all doin' her tomato
Ugh!

Hook: T-Pain
Shawty got looks (And)
Shawty got class
Shawty got hips (And)
Shawty got ass

Oh!

Oh![Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Pull up, on the double, these boys want trouble
They call me Flintstone, and my homie's born/Barn' Rubble
Rebel
Devil
Chase em' through the ghetto
Break these motherfuckers off with just one dedo
Metal bracelets, facin'
Once, incarceration
Aim for the dome, gotta keep my concentration
Since elementary
It was destined for me
To see the penitentiary
Late Friday, or was it early Saturday
I hit him with the shotty that I bought from Academy
Duck for cover, you marked, motherfucker
Didn't momma say not to play with niggas from the gutter
I smell undercovers
I die with my brothers
And when I'm on the mic, I represent
All colors
Last summer
I escaped from an asylum
You know the three digits, bitch, you better dial 'em

Break 1: South Park Mexican
No matter where you at, do you represent your city
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you take fools out like the homie Frank Nitty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Did your crib get raided by this little piggy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Have you ever whooped a nigga til he really look silly
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
I suck the blood like mosquito
Facin' Judge Ito
Joint in my mouth, lookin' big as a burrito
Turnin' ten into twenty
Twenty into forty
Forty into eighty
Everything is gravy
Won't you play me in your deck-ah
Microphone check-ah
Quick to grab a chickenhead, hutch by the neck-ah
Double decker
Hoes on my Woody Woodpecker
Niggas call me cryin', say that I'm a homewrecker
Berreta
Underneath my
Raider sweater
Fuck a fine loca by the name of Jueta
Stackin' more cheddar, the Speedy Gonzales
Smoother than the head of Mister Telly Sevalas
Tu sabes, haciendo jales
Movin' yabes
Order two tacos with the beans and nopales
Don't blame us
Just because I'm famous
And got my middle
Finger up your baby mama anus
Biotch

Break 2: South Park Mexican
Do you raise Ben Davis, or do you sag Dickies
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you sleep with your wife or with a nine milli
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
I got sacks for sale, in the land of hell
My enemies don't even get a chance to yell
In the black Seville
With my man Miguel
Little pigs wanna put my fuckin' ass in jail
Stack my mail
Where the bastards dwell
Puffin' on Jane cause that's my gal
Never brag or tell
But I blast 'em well
I shoot more shots than Sam Cassell/can sell
Well
Pick the chosen, and form an alliance
Move in silence and gather loyal clients
Corporate giants
With street science
Cookin' dope on a kitchen appliance
Don't try it
If you can't keep quiet
I put seventeen bullets in your diet
Layin' in a puddle cause you hoes wanna rumble
SPM like Tarzan
King of the jungle

Well it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin bout you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I dont know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I dont know if it's right
I'm tossin turning in my bed
It's 5 oclock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me weak...
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I dont know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby...

[Hook]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Now I know you're not my lady
But I'm just tryin to make this right
I dont know what to do I'm going out of my mind
So baby if you let me
Kick it witchu well than maybe we could ride together
We could do this all nite
Now I dont care if you got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
Cuz I know he can't love you right, quite like I can
It's 5 oclock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me weak...
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I dont know what to do I think I'm in love

[Hook]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

I love the way you freaky like that
I love the way you freaky like that
I love the way you freaky like that
It's an obsession

[Baby Bash]
Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feelin less surene
Where my candy, where my cream
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got alot of money, I love to spend it
And thats whats up and I dont care what people scream
You're my blessin when I'm stressin
My superfly beauty queen
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Cuz my ma know how I do
We go rendez-vous
Mi corazon belongs to you

[Hook]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong) what am I do wrong [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
What am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong?) what am I do so wrong? [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

[Hook]

[Baby Bash] + (Akon)

And now I'm elevating
Sellin 5000 dollar beats

[Hook: Grimm]

I smoke two joints when I wake up
In the car I smoke two joints
I smoke two joints when in play video games
And every 10,000 points

And two in time of war ar
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke two more

[Verse 2: SPM and Low-G]

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
She loves it when I come through, poppin' the slang
The million dollar Mexican is at it again
She want me to take her to the top of the game
Cause she keep it on track like she ridin' the train
Heels and half tops, to watchin' her ass drop
The crowd, they can't stop, they lovin' the lollipop
Ugh
Off top, she locked and sewed up
Got the club spotlight, til your boy showed up

Now girl go on and break it down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
She gonna break it down like a pound or a key
Executive suites little mama ven aquÃ­
Lifestyle VIP and we living real mosca
Yeah that's my girl with that platinum chocha
Attitude is a mess cause she loves to get spoiled
Puffing on that cookie with a cup full of oil
Make it blood boil when she coil like a snake
Booty like man, hold up, wait
See the dude she came with, looking square as back pockets
And she leaving with your boy and he couldn't cock block it
And of course I would destroy when I get the bed rockin'
Million dollar pussy and to me its me all profit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Too Short]
You by the bar, broke dudes trying to holla
Can't buy you a drink, he only got 20 dollars
And y'all bitches too fine for that
All the fake ass lines he spit, its bullshit
He ain't no pimp (pimp)
Who you with girl, just you and your friend
We pop bottles last night, we gonna do it again
Baddest girls in the club we moving em in
Find a spot, I'm doing it locked
But if you ain't hot, you know I'm not
We drink shots of PatrÃ³n and CÃ®roc over here
You can go back over there and drink beer

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
I'm a gangsta but I'm so fly
Thirty thousand feet without a plane so high
This an Amsterdam bag not regular motah
Run upon me if you wanna I'm going in your eye
Call me Rother Vandross or the king of the ghetto
I'm a Christian but I got a laser beam on that metal
I don't even need a beat I go platinum accapella
Eiffel Tower leaning homie got purple and got yellow
Finger nails, limousine tinted, smoked too many doobies
200 on the dash no human can lose me
My lower body is for real, woman you can use me
Whenever I break it down, it is where it should be

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Clyde Carson]
I tell the baddest bitch in the party break it down
A real one in the building, smellin' like a pound
I'm comin' fresh up out the huddle, like I'm callin a play
VIP deep and we all from the bay (aaaaayyyy)
You know they know how we act, they know what we do
Reputation for sinnin' em, so come to our booth
Champagne passed around, yeah we aight
Playin with the chicks, since I was knee-high
Models goin up, its prolly goin down
Hard in the paint, mixin clear with my brown
Fuck what they think, as long as I wear the crown
Got lost from your man, you don't wanna be found

All I can picture is the color of your eyes (Color of your eyes)

Chaos and confusion

Am I doing too much
Doing too much[Low G]
Ghetto Soldier, I'm representin' from that Houston
Second Ward, that be the place where I do my dirt
Kick in doors, sellin' dope, only my God knows
I have to do what I have to do, just to stay alive
I lost a friend, but God blessed me with some real niggas
Hell is soft, I kept it real from the fuckin' start
I stay strapped, cause my neighborhood so dirty
I kiss my Grandma goodbye, but my jefa looks so worried
Pitbulls from my tierra that I call my home
It ain't much, but its something I can call my own
I go to war at any times, at any place
Why yo punk twelve gauge, all in your face
I want your jades, your jackets, and your jewelry
What the fuck you on my block, if you ain't cool with me
You crossed the line, ain't no time to press rewind
I caught you slippin' cause I heard that you dropped a dime
On my perro, now he doin' twenty-five to life
Low G, now I got to earn another stripe
Ghetto star, Greyhound is my fuckin' car
Ghetto clothes, but I'm feeling like I'm ghetto far

But if they want some static, I got an automatic
This automatic, if I grab it
Sometimes it's tragic, causin havoc
Bullets blastin, but he had to have it from startin racket
Looked at the wounded and all the graphic
The game is graphic, and the classic, in and out of traffic
Money stackin, by any means keep your gadget
And find a way to keep supporting my weed habit
I get my shit dirt cheap, the way I like it
You disrespect the clip, puto I get excited
My trigga finger get itchy, like I was +Lionel Richie+
A +Commodore+, when I go to war
So get down so I can touch you quickly
No substitute for these thugs, who love to shoot and cut the loot
You fuckin punk, that's why I don't fuck with you
Cock strong, pretty boy but don't get it twisted
A savage with this beat you want it mayne then come and get it
Cause every blow has nothing but these bad intentions
So now you know Baby Bash keeps it gut wrenchin'

You're my eye candy
Ain't nothing sweeter than your love

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
How about some Don Perigone, before we start to carry on
You know I'm on the grind, so I can't stay very long
Everytime I hear the radio, it's like every song
Make me think of you and me, gettin' our merry on
Like a cherry on, top of cake and ice cream
Cheech and to the Chong, me and you is like a nice dream
Lookin' so classy, lookin' so jazzy
Down for the daddy, your boy, Bash Bashy
I'm on some late night hype, so I might not make it home

She's in love with a hustla
She only messing with them suckas
Looking so good, little tight jeans on and G-string on
And I know that she be feeling me

[Baby Beesh]
She in love with a hustla, someone she could trust uh
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas
Sleep all day, and grind all night
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks
And even though sometime, it might seem strange
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

[Chorus]
(*ad-libs*)

[Baby Beesh]
Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance
And end up with a over jealous sucka romance
Love to see me get the lapdance every now and then huh
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
Now that's living like, who's the boss
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce
Even though she approached by them big time ballas
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa
And her parents just don't understand
What kind of man she in love with, but she don't give a damn

[Chorus]

One day we gone get it together
One day we gone keep it together - 4x

Covered in diamonds, get a load of this wrist

Chorus (2 X's)

Verse 2
(SPM)
Im kinda hotta than lava, I got a dog that slobba

Im still comin down Orem just floorin the foreign
Never borin or simple, man im really excitin
I go to clubs and be fightin, I be kickin and bitin
I might poke ya eye out , I dont fight that fair
I fought a dude with some braids and started pullin his hair
But my boys back me up and leave nobody standin
Im like "why y'all jump in? man I almost had'em"
And they was like "los, he was beatin yo ass"
I was letting him get tired, man you messed up my plans
Anyway, I'mma write a song about it, and tell
All my fans that I beat him up all by myself--haha

Chorus (2 X's)

Verse 3
(Low-G)
I might play chalupa, thats mexican bingo
Peace to my boys up in coffield and beto

If I hit the pen walk around with a pico
I used to slang cincos, chilled on domingos
Dickies look young ain't got no wrinkles
Shoot like ming when he hit 12 footaz
I be pullin hoes like a kid pick boogaz
You can see my rolli when I dip guacamole
Gotta all white pit like angelina jolie
I put red dots on 9 milla Glocks
Might make you think that you got chicken pox
Got rims like a spida, weed to the lighta
Its ya boy low, ima killa not a fighta
Roll with china, phone off the ringa
I know you hear the hook, nigga thats my lil prima

Chorus (2 X's)

(Bash)
Im at the dope house smoked out, baby bash loc'd out
Doin tracks with charlie brown whe broe out
He choked out his C.O., did it on the D-lo
Went to see his wife and his daughter and his mijo
The game is so frio, now he tippin Styrofoam
Said he gotta be right back before th lights is on
Buts its al gravity, learn from tragedy
Just to let you konw cold tem batches be
Cause when it comes to the jealous man it gets messy
I fuck around and gotta turn into some joe pesci
I pimp the blood out ya mama and ya loved ones
Sell dog shit to ya uncles and ya cousins
And guaranteed that you won't say nada
Radio or not, man you still dont want no brrr--aa, brrr--aa
And thats the really realest shit I ever spoken
Dot get twisted mayne, dope house is still open[SPM]
Fresh off the cut, mama who? mama what?
Take a 40-ounce hard to the gut
On the run so call me the perro
In the club with a sharp ass filero
Ya'll gettin large, Dopehouse is larger
I'm in the hotel tryin to find my charger
Its another hot summer, she gave me the peck
And then let me tongue her
Love it maan, I'm with my dame
Young and dumb with real good brains
In the club eatin steak and ostrich
Smoke weed and get more hungry than a hostage
I've been hard since the very first demo
We came up with no problemo
Darn, yeah I'm from a farm
With 700 elbows in the barn!

A forty dollar sweet

In this times
Of hate and pain
We need a remedy
To get us out the rain
Jealousy
A little greed
I been thinking
Of what I need
Purple leaves
With crystal flakes
If it's not hydro, please get that out my face
Two-twenty five for a half of O-Z
In the club, with my homeboy Joey T
My science project was in the school arena
Cause I made a bong out this old steam cleaner
Ya mon

But wait

Always wanna smoke like a damn chimney
Motherfuckers call me Miss Big Cheat
But I don't give a fuck cause I love my weed

If you want that dope

While my girl got my baby momma in a chokehold
Smoke til my eyes turn Japaneese
Me and Carlos lit half-a-tree
Now I don't pimp
A jigalow
I blow big indo with my niggaros
Gotta mouth full of cotton cause I'm off green butter
Marijuana, mayn, I love her
[SPM]          This some good ass weed, Beesh

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican (Carolyn Rodriguez)]
You see
I smash on you pussies
And creep with the thugs
I got a T-shirt that say (Weed is not drugs)
I got a tight spot
That sits by the sea
Three story beach house, let's throw a party
Fucked up in the head
I don't know what happened
I have nightmares, and I wake up laughin'
With a bottle of Tequila
Tryin' to reach the bottom
And why do all my ass friends have a X on 'em
Got two rusty gats
Two house cats
And I don't feed 'em shit, so they live off the rats
And still didn't even pay my warrants
I just sat up in jail and ate my porridge

Chorus:

I need some Purity, so I screwed it and chopped it
Haters can't block it
Fuck a Judge [{*Ellis*}]
Mexicans gettin' big, so they start, gettin' jealous
Overzealous when we dip
Through the spot, into the club
Cock blockers gettin' slapped
With the motherfuckin' snub
You a thug, you a killer, you a gangsta, you a G
But I bet you with these hands, mayne, you can't fuck with me
You just a silly trick warrant, mayne, talkin' all that maza
You love to smell the shit
Yeah, you love to smell the caca
While we love the smell of roses and we driving somethin' vicious
Yeah, we comin' down, droppin' all you punk bitches

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: ICE]
Dicen que los quieren matar pero ni se pueden acercar
Esta rola es una bomba que acaba de estallar
So fijate bien y mira quien es, no somos dos, somos los tres
Los que fumamos mota para realisar estres
El mojado y sur de park, con el Bash, listo para tumbarte
Listos para un desaster por eso no quieren acercarse
So pescamos todos armados
Y el carro con rimes cromados
Cuetes en cada lado, con medicina en mi liquado
Escucha todo lo que escribo
Por eso mi estilos bien frio
Repensentando los illegales y todos que crusando el rio
Gritamos siganme los malos
Rodiando de mil caiga palos
Brincando en cada scenario, gritando "Libreren a Carlos"

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 4: South Park Mexican]
I solemnly swear to tell the truth and nothin', but
My niggas dead all because of fuckin' slut
I never love a ho
That one, fa sho
Fuck home, cause I roam just like the buffalo
I'm the baby of the family
Runt of the litter
I can't stop smoking
Cause no one likes a quitter
Every three months
My house will get raided
This motherfuckin' album is the fuckin' shit, ain't it
Hydroponic leaves
Rollin' up my sleeves
Throw your guns up, and the sky falling
Holla peace to my boys on the Hillwood strand
Tryin' to make some cash, mama, please understand

[Hook: Baby-E]
Light up, light up
Strike a match and watch the flames burn bright
Light up, light up
Breathe deep and let it clear your mind
When you start feeling down, light one up, pass it 'round
Keep your chin up and head high cause nothing's forever
Light up, light up
Breathe deep and put it in the sky

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
I'm never drinking and driving, I'm only smoking and flying
Too many dying, alcohol related death's multiplying
So you know, we gotta keep it in perspective
Get my point across, like a boss and make sure that mi gente gets the message
I'm just gonna blow up on this fire, who got the lighter?
You want that sherbert OG Kush, that cookie gets you higher
Need no crazy pills, they give me no crazy thrills
That's cause how a playa feels, I'm smoking until the wheels fall off
Yeah, and that's how we keep it lifted
California fine's are organically engifted
I'm in love with Mary Jane, some call it that Marichuana
I'm the one you call when you need that good ganja

[Hook: Baby-E]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Uuuuuh
Inhale, exhale, fucking right I love it
I got murder munchies, Iâ€™ll die without chicken McNuggets
Used to buy bags, now I bring it back in buckets
The fuck is this a seed? My nigga, you must be bucking
I don't smoke less than OG Kush bitch
Y'all boys smoking on that bull shit
Probably ain't even coughing off none of that
If I was you, I wouldn't even much none of that
Can't even smell it when it's burning, that's that lil boy shit
I'm a grown man, I don't smoke with lil boys bitch
Super Sour Mix with that cookie
Veteran lungs since day one, I've never been a rookie
Plain RAW papers, or RAW paper cones
If I add a styrofoam cup I ain't gon' make it home
I'm just saying I'm so gone, I don't even know where I'm suppose to be at
How the fuck we suppose to be sober when Mary Jane everywhere we at

[Hook: Baby-E]

[Verse 3: Berner]
Cookie smoke in the air, there's police everywhere
Yeah I smoke where I want, now I don't really care
Will I share? I don't know
If I'm down? I'm in town for a week
Let's go half on that pound, yeah I only want that loud
Yo, we don't make a sound that ain't good
No swishas, no woods, bong hits if we could
Roll another one, think we should
You can smell it through the bag
I made it killing off the wax, so wanna take another dab?

[Hook: Baby-E]
