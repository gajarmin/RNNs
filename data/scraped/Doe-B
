[Intro: Doe B]
I ain't missin' (don't miss, nigga)
One shot, one chance
The kid, let's do it

[Hook: Doe B]
I fuck who I wanna fuck
When I'm out I'mma hit her and I ain't missin'
And you can duck all you wanna duck
Hundred shots out the ripper and I ain't missin'
These niggas tell me they feel me
I drop a hit when I'm ready and I ain't missin'
You know they can't do nothing with me
I ain't ballin', I'm swishin'
I ain't missin'

[Verse 1: Doe B]
Just copped a six for the summer, you know my pull up game vicious
Can hit your bitch if I wanna, real talk, I ain't missin'
[?] with no ceilings
In a room full of prostitutes, boy, you still can't fuck with 'em
Ballin' like I'm Nowitzki
Better yet, like Mark Cuban
I ain't talkin' my necklace when I say my links are Cuban
Bricks comin' in Tuesday
Ah, man, they can't stop me
Got your bitch on that Molly
And got four hoes in the trunk
Nigga, this ain't no Audi
Park the foreign in the projects, they holler "Whoa, Kemosabe"
This a million dollar nigga, bitch I'm Ted DiBiase
Wait for a nigga to trap me, I'm Barry Bonds with the gun
Hit homeruns or better, nigga this the steroids era

[Hook: Doe B]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Now pay attention, don't wanna miss this
I came up with the quickness
Haters hate that I made it, they actin' sour as citrus
Walk in rooms and cause reactions
They're like "Who the fuck is this?"
I came with homies but I leave here with bitches
Listen, now if I set my eyes on her and then decide that I want her
Then I ain't missin', believe me, when I make moves she's a gonner
Whether Rihanna, Madonna, Lana Del Ray, or your momma
She's old as nada, I close my eyes then hit a pinata
I'm as crazy as Patrick, a young american psycho
If I said it, I meant it, now listen there is no typo
Haters keep tryna tell me to shut my arrogant pie hole
But I'm a bull in the booth, who wanna pair against Michael
I kept giving less and less fucks 'till I got to zero
Now all I care about is pussy, deniero
Tryna take care of my family, I feel like I'm a young Rob De Niro
I'm the villian, I am no fucking hero, it's all for real though

[Hook: Doe B]

[Verse 3: Maino]
Now, everything in my vision I plan to hit with precision
Niggas food on my dishes, I'm 'bout to handle my business
Lil' homies is trippin', you pray to God that we missin'
I swear to God we ain't missin'
Now up the guard we gonna lift him
Man these pussies is bitches, and my niggas is itching
I just lost my religion so help me Lord, I'm a villain
Got the soul of a soldier, got the vibe of a rider
Got the eyes of a killer, I don't miss when I fire
If that was still in my spirit, I don't talk man I live it
When I speak niggas listen, bullets close like they kissin'
I'm just battle my dough, I'm down bottom with dough
Got them funerals ready, niggas die in the road!

[Hook: Doe B][Intro: Doe B]
Yea
I got a lot of questions, no answers man
No
Rest in peace to all my niggas who ain’t here with me
(I don’t know why)
Free all my niggas locked down
Listen I keep it real tho
(I don’t know why)
Aye
(I said I don’t know why)
I don’t know why yall can be like this tho

[Hook: Doe B]
I don’t know why these niggas hatin on me
I don’t know why we still stuck in in these streets
I don’t know why I can’t get no sleep
I don’t know why the pain is runnin so deep
I don’t know why we in a world so cold
I don’t know why he had to take my folks
I don’t know why they had to cage my folks
I don’t know why I hate to say they don’t know

[Verse 1: Doe B]
I don’t know why they had to take Lil Heep
That was my nigga since we were 13
I swear to God everyday still hurts me
I probably would’ve died if they would’ve merk fees
And I don’t know why the devil had to curse me
I don’t why these niggas killed Lil D
I’mma keep yo name alive, you still live through me
Lawd when I die give me bulletproof wings
And just cus I can fly these niggas wanna shoot me
That's why I keep that iron I can’t let em do me
I gotta stay alive, got too many mouths to feed
You can hate it all day still ain’t no stopping me
Gotta change my ways, I can’t be in these streets
I made it all the way to BET & MTV
That’s the number one reason why these niggas envy me
Gotta kill these niggas I can't say i'm killing me

[Hook: Doe B]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Why I’m so slum to death, till I’m so numb in life?
Some in it say I’m the king, But will I ever survive?
Will I forever be shaking? These suckers rolling the dice
Man would I cherish the fame if God lowered the price?
Have I already been where I’m gon go in my life?
Will everybody who doubted me now be finally right?
Well I don’t give a fuck when kids don’t say I’m dope
Don’t they know that I only do this for Phil, My daughter Leah and Dub
Why am I so so fuckin selfish? Why it’s takin so much?
For me to be happy with myself, why niggas hatin so much?
Why niggas playin with they life? Speaking on my wife
Forgive em for they know not Lord
I’m just prayin for they life
What Doe B did for Montgomery no one could ever take from him
Why they kill him ‘fore he get to the money? Riddle me this
Why my city ain’t shit like it used to be
SOME said ’cause they locked up Meech and T

[Hook: Doe B]

[Outro: T.I.]
Rest in peace to my nigga Doe B
Hustle Gang over everything
CBM what it do?
Aye my nigga we all miss you and we ridin for you partna
And for whatever worth tho you were bossed up at the funeral

[Verse 1 : Doe B]
Let me find out these niggas still hating on the low
And their whole life savings I get paid for a show
Their re-up, that's my walk-through
My sneakers, there they house note
Think I need a whole thang of Keisha just to talk to 'em
Small town, big money, baby I make boss moves
They say Doe B lane is like T-Pain without the autotune
Bring out the Apollo boom

You got a foul mouth ? You'll get 2 shots
Nigga And1 with my handgun
Nigga talk about dough but that's sumthing you ain't never had your hands on
Got folk in Alabama, they still call Arm & Hammer

But let me find out that she's havin' your baby though

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Juicy J]
Let me find out, Juicy J's your girl's favorite rapper
I'mma fuck her all night and I'mma give her back after
I ain't hand cuffing these hoes like shackles
For the green & the cheese like a Green Bay packer
Trippy Mane : fuck you pay me, I come play like Tom Brady
Kush is my medication, ride presidential like Ronald Reagan
Pussy niggas need to stop hating my flow sick like cancer patients
Rolex and a new Bugatti, yes bitch I'm ice skating
My last bitch must've been a chauffeur, she drove me crazy
No key, that space age, my ignition, I done made it
Juicy J, that's trippy ho, Taylor Gang that's trippy ho
Smoking on that Christmas tree my belt buckle like mistletoe
Who stands with your wife? She just spent the night
With my dick in her mouth & my balls in her hand
Like the bitch was shooting dice
Juicy J, I got long money
I got 1998 song money
Bitch pour that Patron for me
I rock shows, boy I'm stone money

[Hook]

[Outro]
[?]
Let me find out you put Molly all in her champagne and she don't even know it
Let me find out you put the Plan B in the bitch breakfast
Actually that ain’t bad, you actually should put Plan B in these hoes breakfast
[?]
Let me find out Juicy J got stabbed in a shootout
Let me find out Tip still ridin' 'round with guns
I'mma whoop his motherfuckin' ass
Let me find out your pussy hairs look the Django beard, ho
Let me find out you went to the club and left your kids with your other kids
In the car

[Hook: Doe B]

[Verse 4: B.o.B]
Bottle poppin' with my possy, we ballin like the Cosbys
Ballin’s in my bloodline, casa de mi patri
Young god is the prophet, young playa stackin' profit
I made a quarter million and I never went to college
Say the flow out here is solid, smoking hydroponics
Even in Japan boy, I get plenty sake
I’m all about the dollar, bitches wanna holler
Bet yo girl got more inside her mouth than just in gossips
And this life is all that I know
Ain’t after that, I didn’t miss it
And we go hard, these niggas lip but them ventriloquists whisper
From band hitters on 6, niggas would kill to get rich
And this Doe B, B.o.B, G.D.O.D, we rich nigga

[Bridge: Doe B]

[Hook: Doe B]

[Verse 5: T.I]

And yo gang play, cocaine pay

I’m still a drug dealer, how you love that?
Love a real nigga, den you love me!
Catch me in the spot, where they sellin' drugs at
Come with 50-60, you can get you 2 or 3
Bending corners in Ferrari Californias

(Ay what you doin'?) Smokin' shit you get from California
Bitch get wrong she gon' get left in California

[Hook: Doe B][Intro]
Salute to the streets
Smile my nigga

Doe B, Baby Jesus
DJ Scream signing out

[Verse 1]
For all the ones that hated
I still got love for 'em
I don’t wish nothing bad on 'em, just got tough love for 'em
Guess all the love that I was showin'
It wasn’t enough for 'em
But I wish you all the best
Just gon' kill you with success
Cause I know it hurts you nigga eyes when you see me shine
I know you niggas wish you were blind when you see me shine
Man I ain’t tryin' to hurt you, I don’t wanna see you dead
I wanna see your family perfect
Wanna see you take care of your kids
I wanna see you and you see me pull up in that foreign shit
I wanna see you saluting a kid like don’t stay on yo shit
But instead you wanna go against this shit
This is history in the making
I don’t wanna see you miss this shit

[Hook]
I just wanna see you smile
I just wanna see you happy
I’m just tryna make you proud
Just wanna hear you say you love me
And I don’t wanna see you down
No, I don’t wanna see you struggling
I’m just tryna see you smile
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you smile

[Verse 2]
I’mma say this out to my mama who put away all my drama
200 and 52 months, that’s 21 summers
I never should attempt, you such a strong one
You went to marry both the whole world, that’s why I owe you
And you deserve it even though nobody’s perfect
In God eyes is a fully round circle in my eyes
Shit, but I ain’t satisfied, see you got that house baby
See you deserve a mansion, hoping the times will change this
Bet you done took and keep a nigga belly full
The flies close on my back, you the reason why I’m so cool
You the reason why where I’m bad
I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you
And you know I love you for that, I want for that

[Hook][Hook x2 : Doe B]
Who the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?
Who the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?
I don't know that bitch, I don't know them either
Kinda look familiar, I done caught amnesia
X2

[Verse 1: Doe B]
I done fucked so many hoes I can't keep count no more
Will somebody tell Hugh Hefner he ain't got shit on Doe?
My neck on freeze, my wrist on glow
I'm high as fuck, I'm sitting low
Want your ho, come get your ho
I got her walking pigeon toed
America next top model, right here in my condo?
I don't even know her name, I just asked her for a condom
And she look like Rihanna, her ass is like humongous
She say she love my convo cause I kick shit like a punter
But I don't know her name, and she don't know me either
She just want the fame, I just want bomb no teeth
Love me long time, love me, love me long time
The reason all my dates be blind dates cause this charm of mine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Dear Lord, could you please have mercy?
Rock hard, bitch on me twerkin'
Bitch like, "You stupid jerk!"
Look, I ain't grab your ass on purpose
Don't remember nothing, guess I'm getting worse
BMTP, that's murder
Bring me the pussy, you ain't ever heard her?
Now we fucking in an old excursion
Getting head while I drive excursion
On the phone asking "Am I working?"
He must want me to hurt him
Instead of talking like its urgent
Where you know me from, I'm lost
Man you about to make me get off
It was hard, but it started soft
Fish scale, what the hell, that's raw
Hold shots, come get broke off
Two paws, oh God, that's the law
Shots fired, man down, what happened?
Envelope, beep phone, I stabbed him
Two shooters, you dummy, I'm coming, get the money
Got a bank roll in this bitch
Amnesia, I have that shit
Ask anything, I forget, quick

[Hook][Hook]
I got too many hoes, I got too many foes
Too many fake ass friends, these niggas all clones
I got too many shows, I’m always on the road
I got on too much ice, that’s why my heart so cold
I got too many problems, man I don’t let it stop me
Ain’t worried bout no niggas, I got too many choppas
Ain’t worried bout no bitches, I got too many options
And money’s not a issue, ain’t never too much money

[Verse 1]
No ain’t money but too much paper
Ain’t never too much paper
But right now my bitch frank, ain’t never call me racist
Never too many haters, I need my motivation
Ain’t never too much swagged out, never too much flavor
I got on too much ice, that’s probably why they hate me
My chain fay that life, this for you so called takers
I’ll keep that bitch on safety, too many niggas flaky
These niggas all clones dog, too many niggas fakin'
And all these niggas basic, I’m extraordinary
No problems, got no laces
My watch in trunk canary
And I’m a living legend, real talk I should have been burried
Aye, I’ve been through it all dawg, the streets say I’m the realest

Too much time, many rhymes to get this shit off my chest

Ay real talk nigga dig this

[Hook: T.I.]
Holdin your own is just something, either you do or you can't
Is you a gangster for real, either you is or you ain't
It ain't both, it can't be both
You either solid and thoroughbred, or you snitch on your friends
Either you balling for real, or you leasing your Benz
It ain't both, it can't be both

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm either ball deep in it or I'll accept the fact I'm finished
Demanding my respect when all these other rappers timid
Try me I'll bust a nigga ass in a minute
I'm just dyin' to ain't bust a nigga ass in a minute
I handle my business no mask when i did it
Just Latex gloves and trash bags when I'm finished
Shit you talk in your rhymes I really know how to do it
You braggin about a nine you know you ain't gon shoot it
You know you don't wanna kill a man
But then again scary nigga kill quicka, George Zimmerman
And Lord knows I be trying to be the bigger man
But one of you niggas try me I'm headed to the pen again
Stand up count, razor in my mouth
Shank a nigga ass on the yard and I'm out
We been know for keeping bails of kush and bricks of hard at the house
And we made it out of that  what we arguing about nigga?

[Hook: T.I.]
Holdin your own is just something, either you do or you can't
Is you a gangster for real, either you is or you ain't
It ain't both, it can't be both
You either solid and thoroughbred, or you snitch on your friends
Either you balling for real, or you leasing your Benz
It ain't both, it can't be both


[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Labor Day, Murciélago, everything elegant
Somewhere getting paper while pussy niggas irrelevant
Double barrel shotty's with nostrils big as an elephant
Leave spiritual and physical floating like you was Heaven sent
Black hand jack your face hiding under this beanie
Run up in you spot, wish a nigga would, fuck a genie
Haters catch execution like Benito Mussolini
Fuck the world like a Makaveli son of Misifini
Niggas say they banging, when it's pressure they a businessman
You out of bounds, fuck around and get charged like a sentence man
You either gangster out you ain't, fuck thinking about it
You and every pussy on you ship gonna end up sinkin out it
I die for my reputation get rejected
Knowing its a plague of fuck niggas leavin shit infected
I'm holding court off in these streets, get your issue swept
Jump out on them with this P-90 leave them to plead the fifth

[Hook 2: T.I.]
You either solid and thoroughbred, or you snitch on your friends
Either you balling for real, or you leasing your Benz
It ain't both, it can't be both

[Verse 3: Dro]
Ak-47 to your face, boy im dead wrong
Bullet to your dome for niggas thinking they head strong
Catch him with them Beats by Dre headsets on
If he ain't listen throw one up  in his headphone
Haah
Which one is you workin?
Say you pushing a Benz but you can't buy your bitch a Birkin
You a pussy that's for certain
And everybody feeling me
I got these niggas nervous, gorilla nigga really thin
Testarosa shit you mad cause im kosher huh
Blue diamonds in the charm, look like the ocean huh
50 keys nightly, wrists brightly
If you don't like the way that I'm kickin it come and fight me
Keep hollin' about you the man, but your hand out
While we was over seas buying keys til they ran out
See me in the 'vette tearing up the asphalt
Playing with a Hustle Gang nigga knock his ass off

[Hook 3: T.I.]
Holdin your own is just something, either you do or you can't
Is you a gangster for real, either you is or you ain't
It ain't both, it can't be both

[Verse 4: Spodee]
Business is business, packages shipping
No limit on spending, I'm in Fifth and Saks with the women
A chemist in kitchens I was cooking crack when a nigga was really 'posed to be timid
I really deserve a sentence
Bagging bitches is a talent, smart as devoted leaders
On probation for ten years and still hold heatas
Let a stupid nigga try Spodee, I'mma punch him in his face
If I can't beat him I'mma draw down with a forty
And these days bitches wanna bow down and adore me
I feed haters shit while eating shrimp, they mouth water
I keep potato chips with cheese dip in that order
A nigga hate on me I take his bitch past Florida
And you know that she ain't been nowhere
I really don't care, all a nigga really want is some head, I'mma watch your hair
I'mma be so fair, I got the whole city ridin with me
??

[Verse 5: Doe B]
Sucker niggas playing both sides, I'm straight as a bow tie
Point blank dead center, down the middle, bulls eye
Get familiar with a real nigga no cosign
Stand up guy like the roll tide o-line
Protecting my land if you ain't dying with honors then
You less of a man, nigga you a Juwanna-man
I came, I saw, I conquered
And my only fear is to slip and die on my momma land
It's a jungle man
You got rats, you got snakes out here
You got lions, you got apes out here
These niggas lying they so fake out here
Like them dead presidents ??

[Hook: T.I.]
Holdin your own is just something, either you do or you can't
Is you a gangster for real, either you is or you ain't
It ain't both, it can't be both
You either solid and thoroughbred, or you snitch on your friends
Either you balling for real, or you leasing your Benz
It ain't both, it can't be both[Verse 1:Doe B]
I come straight up out the bottom
Have 50 with dope fiends and robbers
Every nigga on my team got a choppa
Screamin for fuck the coppas, head bustin and fed duckin
All we know, all we know
30 round, LA shit, that’s all we know
Play, we get seen about
Take in a SK in the Sweeney house
50 pounds in the backyard, watching out for the jack boys
Jump in the task force
I’d like to welcome yall to ridgecrest
And those old niggas round me still there
Its Cote Block to my very last breath
When my granny died, I think that’s when I shed my last tear nigga
You don’t feel how I feel cos you don’t live how I live nigga
And I got hundrin in my blood uh
Got bricks all in my crib nigga(Free my uncle)
Wut you know bout having bricks in your crib nigga
Talking so many you can build a crib nigga
Lil nigga

[Hook]
Hustling baby is all we know
Blinded by these cars and clothes
These streets got me caught up in this place
Tryna make it out and maintain

[Verse 2: Trenacote Shawty]
Everyday trap house
Trenacote, got them pounds in the masc
Can’t serve without a get go
I bought that murda nawf back out
We was standing in the hallways
Duckin feds, servin Js
R.I.P Lil Mike, they had to take that boy away
Then why everytime you see my people throw away?
Posted in the cut with the cut always
And I am a Murk nigga, rest in peace Jerry
I know these niggas wanna see me on the T-shirt
They wanna see me fall, but I land feet first
Don’t wanna see me ball bitch but I get work
Circle K gas station, we don't smoke purp
All I blow is OG, kush and sip syrup
Trenacote Shawty, thee project baby
Prodigal of my environment, cause the bricks made me

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Doe B]
Caught up in the game like a maze
Come out first thing, bought a chain and a case so a nigga start hatin
Go get em out the way, 81 lawyers
So forget about the case and we can keep thuggin
There’s a pistol on your waist
Let 'em know that mister don’t play and mister don’t miss
Cause case don’t jail, real niggas don’t snitch
With the fully automatic, wiping out yo whole key yea
I know niggas on the road on a very long trip
I know niggas sold they soul homie just to look rich
If it ain’t bout money then you know it’s bullshit
When them shoes get ugly that when niggas pull tricks
I’ve been round niggas thuggin ever since I was a legit
Since a juvenile I’ve been getting it how I live
When father get a job, nigga I will pay bills
You can say a couple raw boys, see me shootin real
I need to wrap it, nigga

[Hook]

The streets is so hot
The streets is so hot
We tryna make it out there
We tryna make it out there
But hustling is all we know
Blinded by the cars and clothes[Hook x2 : Doe B]
Who the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?
Who the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?
I don't know that bitch, I don't know them either
Kinda look familiar, I done caught amnesia
X2

[Verse 1: Doe B]
I done fucked so many hoes I can't keep count no more
Will somebody tell Hugh Hefner he ain't got shit on Doe?
My neck on freeze, my wrist on glow
I'm high as fuck, I'm sitting low
Want your ho, come get your ho
I got her walking pigeon toed
America next top model, right here in my condo?
I don't even know her name, I just asked her for a condom
And she look like Rihanna, her ass is like humongous
She say she love my convo cause I kick shit like a punter
But I don't know her name, and she don't know me either
She just want the fame, I just want bomb no teeth
Love me long time, love me, love me long time
The reason all my dates be blind dates cause this charm of mine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Dear Lord, could you please have mercy?
Rock hard, bitch on me twerkin'
Bitch like, "You stupid jerk!"
Look, I ain't grab your ass on purpose
Don't remember nothing, guess I'm getting worse
BMTP, that's murder
Bring me the pussy, you ain't ever heard her?
Now we fucking in an old excursion
Getting head while I drive excursion
On the phone asking "Am I working?"
He must want me to hurt him
Instead of talking like its urgent
Where you know me from, I'm lost
Man you about to make me get off
It was hard, but it started soft
Fish scale, what the hell, that's raw
Hold shots, come get broke off
Two paws, oh God, that's the law
Shots fired, man down, what happened?
Envelope, beep phone, I stabbed him
Two shooters, you dummy, I'm coming, get the money
Got a bank roll in this bitch
Amnesia, I have that shit
Ask anything, I forget, quick

[Hook][Intro]
Amp me up, little nigga
Real recognize real, money recognize money
And if you gain money nigga, you know money when you see it nigga
You betta know it, nigga
See me on Hustle Gang, you know what it is nigga

[Hook x2]
I'm a young nigga getting money, better know it
Bank roll full of them a hundred, better know it
Watch costs a car I ain't frontin', better know it
Imma walk in a star, that's nothin', better know it
Brand new yacht with a honey, better know it
Them niggas just talkin', they don't want it, better know it
Sparkles on the bottle keep 'em comin', better know it
Blow a hundred thousand it ain't nothin', better know it

[Verse 1]
I'm a dead man walkin'
Cause I keep a lot of dead presidents on me
I ain't rich, homie, but I'm gettin' rich, homie
S550, AMG kit on me
Your whip should have been foreign
Your bitch ain't she should have been foreign
She like girls, I like girls, we got a lot in common
She only fuck with me cause I get a lot of money
But if you got it, ain't tricki
Lil' nigga, I got it, I ain't trippin'
One show, get it back, thirty minutes
Do a show, blow the rest, thirty minutes
Fuckin' with the big booty hoes
In the strip club, throwing money to her clothes
Cuban link around my collar, I'm a big dawg
Nigga listen to seattle, what the fuck are those?
Imma take a trip out to Mexico
Tell Pablo I'm back to sellin' dope
Imma pour a four can't catch a cold
And I'm iced up like an Eskimo
Real diamonds on my wrist, look!
This this type of shit that get yo' bitch took
Thousand dollar frame D cutter (yeaaaaah)
And if he do the same he a hunter too

[Hook x2]

[Verse]
I'm a young nigga with a check
I'm a young nigga with respect
A hard head leave a pussy wet
Shoot this bitch up like Durant
For 0's in his back like an Audi
Whole brick on your head, that's a bounty
My nigga won't spend a night in the county
Keep a fine lawyer like Jenny Corry
Self made nigga, no co-signs
Fifty racks on the AP, no dimes
I ain't frontin' baby don't goes right
Cause the plug throwin' balls like an old lime
Mixin' purple with the yellow like a Laker, nigga
The Nelson Mandella, I ain't bassin' nigga
AK47 with no safety nigga
Aimin' at your head like a safety nigga
Love the white girl, I ain't wristin' nigga
All you dead white, I need a cemetery
Blowin' money like a crazy nigga
I just spent 80 racks and I ain't finished
Ridin' clean, but I'm slippin' dirty
I got caught up with tha whole pint
Got a little nigga livin' careless
Wanna know what your ho think ?

[Hook x2][Intro: Doe B]
Make sure you have heart 'fore you stab it in a fight

[Hook: Doe B]
Ye' ain't 'bout where you from, nigga's 'bout you back
Make sure you have heart 'fore you stab it in a fight
Give a young nigga a gun, he going to shoot or get shot
Dawg and all these nigga's crunk, won't be able to get got

It's an eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
[x2]

[Verse 1: Doe B]
Yeah, welcome to the concrete jungle
What tomorrow ain't promise
And nigga's shoot choppa's like jumpa's
Well, if you fake you get ate like lasagna
Nigga, these the streets that controlled by us youngsters
Twenty-five and under
In the great words of Sunny Cash, "Respect your minors."
If ye' ain't 'bout that life, it don't take a scientist
To figure out you need to take a different route
Can't wait 'til that day that they let my nigga's out
Real nigga's out
Sometimes you get put in a lose-lose situation
Kill or be killed, gray yard or probation

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trenacote Shawty]
Eye for an eye, brother got shot
Long night, cold days, thugging on the block
[?] got to keep a Glock
Yes, weigh my dough, if you really want to shop
Remember, I had none, bitches wouldn't stop
Now I'm on top, bitches coming by the flock
Me and Doe Beezy got the streets on lock
Don't play with them young'uns, they'll set you on fire
Nigga, I don't lie, and numbers don't lie
Before I was rapping, I was living that life
Couple nigga's left me, and these bitches ain't right
Got to watch these haters, cause they living so sheisty

[Hook][Verse]
Started out with peanuts, young street dreamer
Feeling like Ace Boogie when he first quit the cleaners
Almost shocked the world, Muhammad Ali
I’m back stabbing, Calvin ass niggas tryna team up
Back watching my nigga because I’m watching for niggas
Who wanna stop me my nigga but trust me I’mma get richer
By any means, like macking with that thing in that picture
I ain't ringing like a iPhone, niggas wanna leave me cause
When you get money, trouble tend to come your way
If you play, raise my gun like my son in your face
I bust it like a nut, made me cum on your face
I go off like a bomb, think Saddam in this place
A lot of niggas in the way, still in a turtle race
But you know it ain’t no fun when the rabbit got the cake
I go hard like a pallet in yo place
And I ain’t spraying like Proactive in your face, you niggas at me to the streets
I can’t believe niggas believe niggas
Bet, you could check my background
Yea, I was gone for a minute but I’m back now
And you little niggas, summer’s over, fallback now
I done fell down a couple times, crawl back now
Hoes ain’t used to answer for me, now they call back now
I ain’t used to be shit, they think I’m all that now
Niggas hollering beef shit back to me, y'all on cow  worse
Yea, and these is words of a real nigga
No matter where, hand you a Dolce got a deal with it
And how I feel is how I feel, there’s no feel niggas
Cause fake niggas paralyze real niggas
Back when I was little loved to idolize real niggas
And see how much it says really do kill niggas
They ain’t gon' feel you til they kill you
I’m top five dead or alive,  one of the realest
Just the ordinary life of a G
I can’t believe these niggas want stripes off of me
Niggas I grew up with, I can’t even fuck with
He can’t look you in the eyes, then a nigga suspect
That’s the reason I can’t trust shit
But my vision colorful as TrukFit
I could see the future
I could see the winners and the loser
Copping Versace, I feel like Medusa
Snakes around my head, snakes around my bed
Snakes all in the yard, damn, gotta cut the grass
Niggas I give my last, they don’t even wanna see me last
Take the good with the bad but damn this shit bad
Get money, don’t get mad
I said get money, don’t get married
Only wife of mine just this life of crime
When I started fronting with Duck I almost got fired
I remember hearing shots fired in the hospital dog
Said he thrown apart, can’t recognize
I’m up nine, mane backin' down
It’s trap life til my casket down
This my city, you can ask around
And if I’m lying in that case, a fish can drown
My god, we ain’t no motherfuckin biscuit town
Yall can keep all that bullshit, just don’t forget the crown
King shit[Intro: DJ Scream]
As long as DJ Scream right here
As long as Bigga Rankin right here
Frank White
The whole world needs to know
Doe B gon’ live forever


[Verse 1: Doe B]
Hey

H-Town, half a brick sh*t
Remix, in the drought
Get you rich sh*t
Who got it? They got it, we yellin’
That hit a lick sh*t
Show a monkey ass n*gga
How a banana splits sh*t
Fifty rounds, hundred rounds
That’s that drum sh*t
Band practice
F*ck around and get your dome hit
By starin’ at me
I’m paranoid like I’m on it
Sold so many bricks, I f*ck around
And make your home flip
Real estate
F*ck where you’re from, I’m from a realer state
Fish fillet, fish scale
Boy, that’s killer yay
Weigh your white
Then pull up on you with a pillowcase
And sell you some
You getting’ money, nigga tell me something


[Interlude: Doe B]
Hey, ya’ll n*ggas gettin’ money out there or what n*gga?

Shop with me
All the real n*ggas know me
They f*ck with me
Ask about me, boy I got the streets
Stupid clientele got my name ringin’ bells
Got a Cali plug for real
Say the word, he’s breakin’ bails
I got birds, I got squares
Pull up on ya with some sh*t
Get caught with this, you gettin’ an L
If you’re scared, say you’re scared
Every night I say my prayers
Cross my heart, hope they don’t tell
If you catch the wrong cell
You might end up in a cell
Cocaine paraphernal’
Get your ass some long years
B*tch n*ggas never graduated
Get more money than a mil

B*tch it’s trap life!
What you n*ggas know about it?
Yea, act like it
These n*ggas ain’t ‘bout no violence
Talkin’ ‘bout them killers
These n*ggas ain’t catchin’ no bodies
Boy, you get your issue
I ain’t talkin’ magazines either
A hundred pages
I ain’t talkin’ magazines neither
That AK sh*t
Everything we tote illegal
That mayday sh*t
Let’s call it quits, these n*ggas evil
Cold turkey
I’ll turn this b*tch to Thanksgiving
Back with no mercy
Hot sh*t straight out the kitchen
Let it burn like Hershel
And that choppa got rhythm
It don’t skip a beat
You laid up in a hospital
‘Till your sh*t go bee-eee-p

F*ck n*gga, trick or treat!
In your house with the mask
Like it’s time to eat
Come on hurry with them bags
My lil’ n*ggas starvin’
And they’re preyin’ on a body
With no holy water
God damn, these n*ggas violent (sh*t!)


[Outro: Doe B]
Yea
Come up off that, my n*gga
(Let me get that)
We have to take what’s ours, n*gga (huh?)
So whoever says they’ve got the street (who got the streets, n*gga?)
You know what I mean?
You need that, right now, A.S.A.P., n*gga (pronto!)
See me on television getting’ money, n*gga

This sh*t right here (haha!)
They ain’t gon’ like this sh*t
(On my life?), n*gga
Hey![Verse 1: Doe B]
I'm still Doe B bitch, so what the fuck is up
Got yo' ho' on my dick, whole town on my nuts
I got keys on the streets, I got shooters in the cut
Talkin' bout beefing with me, a 62 will get you touched
Man these niggas small fries, choppers come in all size
Don't associate with pigs, snitch get your hog tied
In that bubblized Benz, gave your bitch the frog eyes
Fish Bowl, no tent, let her see a nigga shine
Make a bitch go blind, tell your bitch go down
Got 'er sucking my dick right before show time
Out flooded on my wrist, spot the brick on mine
Checking out my Rollie watch and said it's yo' time
I am killin' these niggas, I am killin' these niggas
Paralyzed to the fake game, feelin' these niggas
Satisfied with the hate, I'm to real for these niggas
Rest in peace Pimp C, that's chinchilla, lil nigga

[Hook: T.I.] [2x]
And nigga we don't let the drama slide (the drama slide)
You try me there gon' be a homicide (a homicide)
Found my churching in my mama lies (on my mama lies)
Try us this gon' be a homicide (a homicide)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Blood on the chain, I collected the check
My team come down for the shooters, bet chop of the neck (bop, bop)
It ain't the threat, it's what happens out to get the respect (fight me nigga)
I'm the rant of the town, nigga humbling down
I just bought my new P.J., to fly them gunners in town
Man I'm the pick of my homie, ask your O.G. he know me
Go hit a lick for the 40, bust it down with a homie
Only if the nigga where knowin'
We where holdin' more than we showin'
If they violate, we gonna go in there
And make his family mourn, god bless, let em rest, as I die-gret
We the bank roll mob, bitch we just buy shit
And fly shit, with a bad yellow thigh bitch
Caught her in the valley, we should of made her say thigh quick
My nigga Doe pulled up on me after 5 bricks
Took it to Montgomery, had it flippin' like a side kick
Her nigga try us there gon' be a homicide quick

[Hook: T.I.] [2x]

[Bridge: T.I.]
Keep on playin' around, like we playin' with you
Now you gon' fuck right round and have my nigga sprayin' at you
Now keep on playin' around, think we playin' with you
Man you gon' fuck right round and have my nigga sprayin' at you

[Verse 3: T.I.]
And fuck all these niggas, and these loud mouth hoes
All I got for the yeah yeah, is a lot 44
With my company homie, you ain't a live no mo'
Kept me somewhere inside you, blowing loud and rolls
Cup out, cup movin', cashin' out on these hoes
Hustle Gang the name, just made 10 million in clothes
And we gon' do it again, just know we did it for Doe
The thumper bangin', catchin' body, no we did it for Doe

[Hook: T.I.] [2x][Verse 1]
I’m still that lil nigga from Cloverland
All I wanted was to know the man
Seen fiends smoking out the soda can
Seen niggas fuck about 400 band
Ridin in ridgecrest it ain't never safe
If you from Circle K, then you forever straight
I woke up told my mom, we gone see better days
She say she heard that same shit yesterday
Man I’mma keep going hard for my daughter’s sake
Every first of the month for me's a holiday
I told my teacher fuck a job I’m selling that rock today
I’m in the streets with no breaks, ain’t no stopping me
And all the real niggas round the world gone vouch for me
Sometimes I feel like somebody watching me
That why I can’t go nowhere without this Glock on me?
If I die tonight just bury me with G’s on top of me

[Hook]
And these is all my hood memories
Since a little man I’ve been a G
Tonight if the lord so happen send for me
Just cover me in Gucci bury me a G
I know some niggas still out here hatin on me
But I’mma get this money, I can’t let em get to me
And the day I leave the world they gon remember me
Just cover me in Gucci bury me a G

[Verse 2]
And I’m still the same nigga
Trying to numb my feelings popping pain killers
Going through so much, you'll go insane nigga
Nigga all these bigger targets, fuck the fame nigga
Fuck the fame
I live the real life
Boy ain’t nobody untouchable
You'll get killed tonight
I’ve been through so much and man I got real stripes
You niggas wouldn’t know what sacrifice would even feel like
What it feel like
I went from rag to riches
From fuckin hood rats to fuckin the baddest bitches
Put the city on my back and start it up with Dilly
Man I ain’t lookin for recognition, I woundn't recommend it
I’m tryin to catch a million
Cause I got bigger problems
Streets talkin, niggas plottin
My own nigga robbed me
Shit real on my side
But if I shoot you on brainless
If you shoot me you famous
Just separate the real from fake and you will see who remained

[Hook]
And these is all my hood memories
Since a little man I’ve been a G
Tonight if the lord so happen send for me
Just cover me in Gucci bury me a G
I know some niggas still out here hatin on me
But I’mma get this money, I can’t let em get to me
And the day I leave leave this world they gon remember me
Just cover me in Gucci bury me a G[Intro: Doe B]
I ain't missin' (don't miss, nigga)
One shot, one chance
The kid, let's do it

[Hook: Doe B]
I fuck who I wanna fuck
When I'm out I'mma hit her and I ain't missin'
And you can duck all you wanna duck
Hundred shots out the ripper and I ain't missin'
These niggas tell me they feel me
I drop a hit when I'm ready and I ain't missin'
You know they can't do nothing with me
I ain't ballin', I'm swishin'
I ain't missin'

[Verse 1: Doe B]
Just copped a six for the summer, you know my pull up game vicious
Can hit your bitch if I wanna, real talk, I ain't missin'
[?] with no ceilings
In a room full of prostitutes, boy, you still can't fuck with 'em
Ballin' like I'm Nowitzki
Better yet, like Mark Cuban
I ain't talkin' my necklace when I say my links are Cuban
Bricks comin' in Tuesday
Ah, man, they can't stop me
Got your bitch on that Molly
And got four hoes in the trunk
Nigga, this ain't no Audi
Park the foreign in the projects, they holler "Whoa, Kemosabe"
This a million dollar nigga, bitch I'm Ted DiBiase
Wait for a nigga to trap me, I'm Barry Bonds with the gun
Hit homeruns or better, nigga this the steroids era

[Hook: Doe B]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Now pay attention, don't wanna miss this
I came up with the quickness
Haters hate that I made it, they actin' sour as citrus
Walk in rooms and cause reactions
They're like "Who the fuck is this?"
I came with homies but I leave here with bitches
Listen, now if I set my eyes on her and then decide that I want her
Then I ain't missin', believe me, when I make moves she's a gonner
Whether Rihanna, Madonna, Lana Del Ray, or your momma
She's old as nada, I close my eyes then hit a pinata
I'm as crazy as Patrick, a young american psycho
If I said it, I meant it, now listen there is no typo
Haters keep tryna tell me to shut my arrogant pie hole
But I'm a bull in the booth, who wanna pair against Michael
I kept giving less and less fucks 'till I got to zero
Now all I care about is pussy, deniero
Tryna take care of my family, I feel like I'm a young Rob De Niro
I'm the villian, I am no fucking hero, it's all for real though

[Hook: Doe B]

[Verse 3: Maino]
Now, everything in my vision I plan to hit with precision
Niggas food on my dishes, I'm 'bout to handle my business
Lil' homies is trippin', you pray to God that we missin'
I swear to God we ain't missin'
Now up the guard we gonna lift him
Man these pussies is bitches, and my niggas is itching
I just lost my religion so help me Lord, I'm a villain
Got the soul of a soldier, got the vibe of a rider
Got the eyes of a killer, I don't miss when I fire
If that was still in my spirit, I don't talk man I live it
When I speak niggas listen, bullets close like they kissin'
I'm just battle my dough, I'm down bottom with dough
Got them funerals ready, niggas die in the road!

[Hook: Doe B][Verse 1]

I remember it was winter time, 2008
In December round Christmas time, I couldn’t cop the J’s
Mama facing prison time, barely had a place to stay
Look myself in the mirror and said I’d rather be in the grave
Thats why 'till this very day I still scream fuck the state
Fuck the feds, fuck the judge, he hold a grudge against my race
17 years old with a quarter ounce of yay
Cut that shit up so bad they said it need a band-aid
Live for the first and fifth, nigga that’s a bad date
We don’t know nothing else that’s how we get our rent paid
I was working like a slave, call me Kunta Kinte
Caught the chain in the whip and went and got my shit sprayed
When you ride candy paint the hoes  fuck the first day
So much crack in the sink I thought we had an earthquake
Hit that bitch with the yank then smoke a set on first plate
Plug sent so many chickens went and bought a bird cage
My nigga waiting on the bond now he got a murder case
Bet this rap shit ain’t fun now they let me in the game
All these pussy niggas done now, stick a fork in 'em
Just got finished eating my lunch now tell me what’s for dinner
Lord forgive me, I’m a sinner, fuck them niggas and who with them
If you ain’t with me, you against me, ain’t no monkey in the middle
And its CBM, choppers, bricks, money, we official
Still with the same niggas and they dumping off the glizzy
Hold up, them niggas ain’t ready to die[Intro: Raekwon]
Real niggas in the house
You already know
Niggas sit down and play pool and shit
Relax
What niggas don't know inside the muthafucking
Pool balls is nothing but blow
We gettin' money nigga. You already know boy
Toast off nigga lets go man c'mon

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Raised off a knucklehead block, you know the pattern
Black Reeboks all day, let's be it captain
Posing in ostrich, woolrich Galoshes
Clear gazelles crush diamonds in the boxes
Wave game spiral, sneaker game rival
Front on me, see twenty-four Caligos
Drug niggas I hang with, hold up let me change shit
Feds is listening, calicoes rang quick
Thugs blow alcohol, white bitches, tap'em all
So fuck the ass or something, yup pass it off
Icy in the ass mints, so much dough it's elastic
Fuck with the Jews, Crews, and black bits
Might break a man, the heart that'll shake a man
Smack the bones out of ya skin, wake up fam
We the veterans, so many little niggas feather skin
One corny dub, drown you in your letter kid
Necks look thirsty, whats the word, reimburse me
Two techs on his neck, burst sweet he check writing liars
Pull the gold out of your mouth with rusty pliers
Take down the flyers nigga

[Intermission: Raekwon]
Yo, yo, you already know what is nigga
This is not a game, this is not televised
This some shit that happened on a train nigga
Most powerful of them all nigga
Don't make me snatch your heart out your champion shirt nigga

[Verse 2: Doe B]
Hey, I'm from the home of the cop killers
Raised to be a rotten nigga
Rob nigga, shot ninja
You know I got that small in me
"Real Deal" Holyfield, they not authentic
Nah, these niggas half-baked crab cakes
Bitch is baby Jesus, I could sneeze and make a ground shake
Show no pity, charging city niggas out-of-town rate
While you little niggas sending wayne on an ounce plate
I'm in my house shoes, making major boss moves
Dead alone, make the wrong move it'll cost you
Old cats want they corner back, you know how Moss do
They trying to keep up with him
You starve and eat dust nigga
I'm starting to heat up nigga
Then shout "what up nigga"
What's for dinner? This is Chess not Checkers
Real finesse, a nigga trying to molest the system
Black Mamba in jungle possessed with venom
D farmer and I stalk the rest is history

[Verse 3: T.I.]
We from a small house, dropping off an eight ball
To a big deal, thirty-six mil up in my escrow
You walk up with your chest swoll, make it deflate
Been getting keys since we were wearing a Enyce
Now cool what we do, thirty-eight special in my boot
I shoot you from my shoe nigga
My wife say it's a shame how I do niggas
I say "you want me to starve them out"
She say "nah boo, get'em"
So that why I'm a handle all you niggas
Like the bitch that you are
Don't make me get you out that car and get to going in that shit
While you poppin' off? At point you knowing with this shit
We roll up slow and get you hit, pull up in morning with this shit
Or wherever, know that's not where you better be at
Or else, tell your momma pick the casket herself
Hope it make her feel better, you were dead the first year
He ain't suffer but he still a dead muthafucka
Ain't no bullets in the gun, you know you scared muthafucka
And I'm still a Bankhead muthafucka
With the plum for the low, for the bread muthafucka
I said I'm still a Bankhead muthafucka
With the plum for the low, for the bread muthafucka

[Outro: T.I.]
They say Yo B
Hustle Gang G.D.O.D
Raekwon the chef
T.I.P the King
We cold to cold with this shit man
East Coast, West Coast, Midwest
Mid-Alantic, North East, Down South
Patna I got the boy cold
Come seem me

Young god is the prophet, young playa stackin' profit

Say the flow out here is solid, smoking hydroponics
Even in Japan boy, I get plenty sake
I’m all about the dollar, bitches wanna holler
Bet yo girl got more inside her mouth than just in gossips
And this life is all that I know
Ain’t after that, I didn’t miss it
And we go hard, these niggas lip but them ventriloquists whisper
From band hitters on 6, niggas would kill to get rich

And what you blowin' on ain't strong
Let me find out you tryin' to sound like me
On my lil' song
Let me find out you niggas sold your soul for some joints
Let me find out that lil' money in them photos ain't yours
Let me find out you crashin' out

Let me find out you nobody
Bitch, you ain't important
