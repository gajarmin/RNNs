[Hook: sung by Tracey Nelson]
Walking down the street, in my All Stars
In my, khaki suit, doin what I do
Walking down the street, smoking, chronic
In my black locs, lookin, at you

[The Game]
Guess who's back on the West coast tracks
It's the motherfucking messiah of gangsta rap
Still dip in the six-fo', still puffin on the same chronic
Haters mad cause I still got it
I never fall off, even without the Doc
You niggas sellin your soul trying to stay on top
Bitch nigga check your Kotex
You niggas ain't moving shit like the hand on a fake-ass Rolex
I'm five million sold
The cover of my last album the only time you see me sittin on gold
I'm the most anticipated, most celebrated
Most loved and the motherfucking most hated
Keep rolling like gold Daytons
Niggas got the game fucked up like Hennessy with a Coke chaser
You gotta deal with me, I'm the West Coast savior
Niggas think of me every time they six-fo' scraper

[Mac Minister]
What do you call a nigga who's overbearing
Belligerent, foul, defiant and very disrespectful?
You call that nigga the Doctor's Advocate
He's a reflection of Dr. Dre in his heyday in the worst way
The five star surgeon general
Took Jayceon to the Aftermath research department
And gave him a blood test
It came back G-A-M-E positive
The nigga's infected with the Game virus
His oratorical skills are so impeccable
That niggas in the streets call him Cyrus
The young damu's down with violence
Cause in his heart he's a tyrant
It's not a game, it's just called The Game
There'll be no referees, no halftime reports
When the game is over, The Game is over
You can't put a quarter in the machine and get three mo' men
THAT'S, the end

[Hook]

[The Game]
I done been to hell and back
Left for dead, you know who to thank for that
Finished my second LP without a Dr. Dre track
You can take my soul but can't take my plaques
I'm the motherfucking snare when it touch the beat
I'm the 808 drum that got you movin your feet
I'm the heir to the throne after the D-R-E
Product of my environment, you old-ass niggas
Get ready for your early retirement
Before I let hip-hop burn down I run in the building like a fireman
Who can outspit me when I'm high off sticky
Throwing back Patron shots in some creased up dickies
I'm D.O.C. certified, Ice Cube lynch'd me
Snoop stamped me and the good Doc handpicked me
You still with me?
Me and my mic can't be separated like Interscope and - hahaha

Ohhh shit
This some good ass motherfucking weed
California sticky green!
This is the aftermath for the Aftermath
West, coast![Mac Minister]
Bad Azz, ever since we was knee high to a ducks butt
He didn't give a fuck, so you suckas is shit out of luck
He got more cousins than Foster Farms got eggs by the dozens
So if you're weak, you blink, you take too long to think
The little nigga will sink, your battleship
Ever since he was yay big to a pig, he was born a hog
With the game to teach all y'all, earhustlin' paperback pimps
Who've been suckin' up the game like a dry ass sponge
I said, his game is as sharp as a great white sharks teeth
Starvin' for beef, so before you go fuckin' with Bad Azz
You'd rather go to the Million Man March dressed up as the Ku Klux Klan
Sellin' pork chop sandwiches to Farakhan's kids[Mac Minister]
A bitch nigga, is the type of a nigga
That'll hustle from 9 to 5, 2 to 10, 3 to 11
Graveyard, overtime, just to give a bitch his daily earnings
A bitch nigga, is the type of a nigga
That can't use the phone in the County Jail
And he gots to take the top bunk cause he's a punk
A bitch nigga, is the type of a nigga
That'll tell your bitch about your other bitch
A bitch nigga, is the type of a nigga
That's softer than doctors cotton in the emergency room
He's a puddin' pop, a bitch nigga
So nigga don't say nothin' to the Mac
Until you check that bitch.. (What bitch Mac?)
(Mac, what you talkin' about, what bitch?)
The bitch in you nigga!.. Check that ho[Hook: sung by Tracey Nelson]
