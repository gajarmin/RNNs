[Intro]
Oooooh, Damn!
I mean I just keep thinkin about you (awww baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh, oh, oh, ooooh)
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know, but I'm a go ahead and talk about it, Listen

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
I'm sittin lookin out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You still runnin through my mind - when I'm knowin that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowin that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even apalled
I still got alot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been runnin 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they lovin it
I'm likin it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm tryna let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm tryna let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm workin at it and it ain't gettin no better
Just tryna be like "yeah, forget it, whatever"
Instead of starrin out this glass - lookin at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...

[Hook - T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick, out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me) - you don't even understand
Damn - you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doin?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin'me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm tryin man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leavin with the hot shots
Knowin they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not poppin, and my brain ain't stoppin
Thinkin who she with?, or where she goin?, is she club hoppin?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealin with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and everytime you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause

[Hook]

[Bow Wow - Repeat 2x]
Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been runnin thru my mind all day - can you feel me
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

[Hook]

[Bow Wow]
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But I guess I gotta move on right?
Still hard, and I still love until this day.. Peace![Verse 1]
I just touched down, touched down
Quarter after two, flight 102
I know it's late, real late
But I'm calling you, calling you
Tryna figure if I, I
Can, can
I, I
Come, come
See, see
You, can I come see you
I know you're sleep, you're sleep
But you're on my mind, my mind
And I'm wide awake, awake
And I wanna stop by, come on over
So can you get up and get out of the bed
Cause I wanna see you
And I been wondering

[Hook x2]
Can I come over, can I
Come over, stop by
Come over, to see you
Come over, tonight
Can I come over, can I
Come over, get wit' ya
Come over, just wanna
Come over, be with you baby

[Verse 2]
So tell me what the deal
You're not that far
I just got my bags
And I'm headed to the car
Say yes or no, cause I'm on the road
{Um, wait a minute my battery's low...lemme, aight}
Baby, I wanna come see you
Said I really wanna come see you
Don't you worry about a thing
I'm just wanting to hold you
Embrace you, I want to
Look at you and tell you
How much I love you
I want you, I need you, I miss you

[Hook x2][2Pac]
Shit, I'm a changed man
Ay, turn the lights out
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look

[Verse One: 2Pac]
By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggas trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a balling cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin' is

[Hook: Johnta Austin + (2Pac)]
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin with a changed man

[Verse Two: T.I.]
In drop top, the Glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggas but hardly stop niggas
Not if they got niggas, doughboys and hot niggas
Who mighta shot niggas but only by skrilla
I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
To be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat - don't creep
Oh what you think, T.I., P and them sweet? (Don't sleep)
Get you hit from your head to your feet (And you don't know me)
I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload
You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G
No three niggas here are gonna let me be
Or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga

[Hook]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin through coastin'
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin' out
M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
#1 in the nation
I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin' to the whole nation
GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin' on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggas
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggas
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the mass of smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries BLEED
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin' with a changed man

[Hook]

[Hook w/ 2Pac speaking over it]
E'rybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggas don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man

[Outro]
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Nigga, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, I ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, fuckin' with a changed man, changed manShawty where you at?
Shawty where you at?
Shawty where you at?
Yea, yea

It gets lonely in this business, need a homey
Who tha realest
Someone who wants to find out all that I have to give
Who can bring me what is missin', when I talk she wanna listen
Sittin' patient steady waitin', for the day when I can face it

The one that can love me for, who I am and so much more (is it you?)
You ma Bonnie (say that I) I found the one
I ain't gonna rest till I know for sure, sure

[Hook]
Baby please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl (need a girl)
So come on pretty lady won't you holla back, I need a girl
(I'm a tell you what I need)
I need a girl that's goin' be my baby, so if you love me say "I'm your baby"
So fine I go "that's my baby", so if you need me say "your my baby"

I'm a good man, who ain't got a lot to ask
Just lookin' for somethin' I can build on
I'm a young man, with a whole lotta cash
Just lookin' for a lady I can spend on
So all the young ladies in every little city
When I come to your town, let me know that you down
Sittin' patient steady waitin', for the day when I can face it

The one that can love me for, who I am and so much more (is it you?)
You ma Bonnie (say that I) I found the one
I ain't gonna rest till I know for sure, sure oohhh

Baby please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl (girl)
So come on pretty lady won't you holla back, I need a girl

So fine I go "that's my baby", so if you need me say "your my baby"

You could, be my everything
Oh you mean so much to me and I don't even know your name
(But I know that...) that I'm your man (man), and you are my girl (girl)
And if I eva meet ya I'm a give ya the world (oh)

[Hook] x2

"Your my baby!"
Yea, (huh) ye yeaa yea yea oh yea, yeeee yea yea[Intro]

Said I got, I got
And I love, I love
And I say, I say
Everyday, everyday
Said I got, I got (an angel)
And I love, I love (my angel)
And I say, I say (she's an angel)
Everyday, everyday (she's my angel)


[Verse 1]

Daily, nightly, you are in my world
Words can't, say how, much I need you girl
Still I'd, like to, try and find a few
To paint a, picture, of how I feel for you


[Bridge]

Inspiring, unbelievable, I'm smart enough to know
That only the real, could speak the truth
And I don't lie, baby I need you


[Hook]

So real, I hope you understand the way I feel, inside
So clear, there's only one girl I want right here, in my life
And that's the way I feel about you baby
No lie
I swear that there's an angel missing from heaven, tonight
And the angel is mine
Said I got, I got (an angel)
And I love, I love (my angel)
And I say, I say (she's an angel)
Everyday, everyday (she's my angel)


[Verse 2]

Lying, cheating, I would never dare
I'll be, honest, that's how much I care
For you, I'll give, up the playboy rules
They're overrated, when compared to you


[Bridge]

[Hook]


[Verse 3]

You'll be the real, could speak the truth
And I won't lie, baby I need you
And I only hope, you need me the same
Cause without you, I'm less of a man


[Bridge]

[Outro]

So real, I hope you understand the way I feel, inside
So clear, there's only one girl I want right here, in my life
And that's the way I feel about you baby
No lie
I swear that there's an angel missing from heaven, tonight
And the angel is mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
Said the angel is mine(Trey)

Another minute's gone and I know it's coming
You about to say "don't go, don't go"
Believe me when I tell you
I wish that there was something
Something I could say
But you know, you know..
Never know how long I'm
Ever gon' be gone
If I could buy a minute then you know that I would spend it with you
Kissing, touching, hugging, making love (making love)

(Johnta Austin)

I wish money could buy me time
I wish I could stay a day through the night
But it's never, never..
I try to say what's going on
But before I know it, you moan and it's gone
Cause it's never, never, never..
I love everything you do
That's why I try to stay with you
And I would if I could but I can't cos she's calling me too
I swear there's never enough time in a day.. no, no

(Trey)

She call me busy busy bee
(Cos I'm) never ever free
(And err'time) I get up in it she begging me not too leave, (no)

(Johnta Austin)

I wish there was some more me
And I didn't have to run shit
I wish there was another me
But there's only one

(Trey)

I just need to pardon me
And why your body's calling me
I check the other line, to find another dime
And she'd never do

(Johnta Austin)

Ain't gonna lie when I'm gone I'm missing you
It's a trip how I live

(Chorus: Johnta Austin)

I wish money could buy me time
I wish I could stay a day through the night
But it's never, never..
I try to say what's going on
But before I know it, you moan and it's gone
Cause it's never, never, never..
I love everything you do
That's why I try to stay with you
And I would if I could but I can't cos she's calling me too
I swear there's never enough time in a day.. no

(Johnta Austin)

In a perfect world we'd chill
But the world ain't perfect cos it's never, never, never
Wanna be in your arms but you know
That I can't so I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take
I'm gonna have to take that pain

(Chorus: Johnta Austin)

I wish money could buy me time
I wish I could stay a day through the night
But it's never, never..
I try to say what's going on
But before I know it, you moan and it's gone
Cause it's never, never, never..
I love everything you do
That's why I try to stay with you
And I would if I could but I can't cos she's calling me too
I swear there's never enough time in a day.. no, no[Verse - Juvenile]
Juvenile and Mario pimping and we on deck
So stay tune to ya programs cause we on next
I wanna see the women catching the wall
Unless she got that disease, no ass at all
For the hood, for the club, videos or whatever
I got that oldschool, the Bentley or the Porsche Carerra
Profiling with the top off
Wilding, looking for a dime piece I can knock off

[Verse - Mario]
Up in the spot sipping on a little something
Feeling like this joint's is bout to pop off
Looking around trying to spot a little something
Trying to see what somebody talking bout
And if it's good I'm a lend my ear
To a little bit of game all up in my ear
I think I found a window over here
Homegirl is all up in my face like (boom)
Oh yes indeed, all we needed is a hell of a beat like (boom)
And we gon to jam cause I'm feeling like a Yeah! tonight

[Chorus - Mario]
Hold up it's like (boom!)
That's that beat we like
Bet it make the party jump off (boom!)
DJ spin that twice, we about to tear this club up! (boom!)
Ladies you gotta move something (boom!)
Cause the fellas wanna see ya shake something like (boom!)
We got the party getting crunk!
If you don't give a damn, gon throw it up!

[Verse - Mario]
No more siting on the wall little shorty
Starting to feel like a stone cold party
Don't act like you can't sit wit me
Everybody in the club getting tipsy
Ain't this beat on fire, DJ spin it back one more time
Fill my glass up one more time
We gon start it up right on time like (boom)
Yes indeed, all we needed is a hell of a beat like (boom)
And we gon to jam cause I'm feeling like a Yeah! tonight

[Chorus - repeat 2x]

[Verse - Juvenile]
She know about the grill and want to see my teeth
And if we ever bump heads they want to be my freak
She pulling on me cause she feel that heat
She don't wanna go to sleep she wanna feel that meat
That's a Lil Jon beat playa, run that back
It's aight if you kinda tipsy and you fall off track
I'm feeling great, I just had me a drink
She twurking over there, I'm bout to see what she thinks

[Bridge - Mario]
Say oh ohhh! Let's take it to the floor (B'More let's go)
Say yeah! do it like you don't care (WOO! A-Town!)
We gon do it all, from the windows to the wall
Let's gooo!! Let me see ya get low (get low) get low (get low)
Represent yo town (B'More! B'More!)
Throw up your hood (A-Town! A-Town!)
Represent yo town (Jersey! Jersey!)
Throw up your hood (get down now)
Represent yo town (LA let's go!)
Throw up your hood (Chicago!)
Represent yo town (Miami!)
Throw up yo hood (New York!)

I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm tryna let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm workin at it and it ain't gettin no better
Just tryna be like "yeah, forget it, whatever"
Instead of starrin out this glass - lookin at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...

[Hook - T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick, out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me) - you don't even understand
Damn - you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doin?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin'me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm tryin man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leavin with the hot shots
Knowin they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not poppin, and my brain ain't stoppin
Thinkin who she with?, or where she goin?, is she club hoppin?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealin with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and everytime you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause

[Hook]

[Bow Wow - Repeat 2x]
Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been runnin thru my mind all day - can you feel me
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

[Hook]

[Bow Wow]
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But I guess I gotta move on right?
Still hard, and I still love until this day.. Peace![Hook: Johnta Austin]
Tell your friends, to get with my friends
And we can be friends, and do it all weekend
Smoke blunts, get drunk, do it all weekend
From Thursday to Friday to Saturday to Sunday

[Daz]
Well I was chillin' sittin', smokin' in my Escalade
Cadillac pimpin', lookin' for a escapade
I saw some bad body with a beautiful face
What it is ho, you ain't from around the way
You got everybody lookin' and ya know that
Hair right, outfit, ass so phat
On top of that baby girl know just how to throw that
Too fine for me to fight and try to hold back
I had to immediately hit her with some West Coast game
Cause uh, all these niggas screamin' what's yo' name
And uh, buyin' roses and the best champagne
She can see through the glass that yo' ass is lame
She cool, she ain't trippin' off no cash flow
Cause she went to school and still puff-puff-pass though
Right in my alley, as we sat there shootin' the shit
I broke it down, broke it down to the shorty like this

[Hook: Johnta Austin]
Tell your friends, to get with my friends
And we can be friends, and do it all weekend
Smoke blunts, get drunk, do it all weekend
From Thursday to Friday to Saturday to Sunday

[Daz]
I told the ho "You ain't had it 'til you had mine"
I'mma make you forget the nigga name of the last time
I'mma have you in my bed beggin' me for halftime
And after that we smoke-smoke and have some red wine
I can see it in her eye, she got the program
And plus she know she ain't dealin' with a poor man
I'm in the mood for some candles and some slow jams
A lot of niggas smooth but nigga I'm so down, and
(Girl I ain't playin' no games
I hope you're ready, for sure
I got the bubbly and a pound of that weed
And a pocket full of fetti, let's go
See all I want is some head and some pussy
And I'll tell ya, for sure
Girl I ain't playin' no games, I hope your ready)
{Is you ready?} (Let's go)

[Hook: Johnta Austin]
Tell your friends, to get with my friends

You still sending me crazy emails
Like I know its just sex you want (you want)
I can't lie the sex is truly incredible (incredible)
And every part of your body is so edible (edible)
I get tears from just thinking bout it
But that ain't the reason why im stuck and can't let you go (let you go)
We got a serious serious bond (bond)
And when we kick it we have nothin but fun (but fun)
I feel a whole lot of L-O-V-E between you and me

But still I choose you to be

You got me like

[Hook][Intro]

Said I got, I got
And I love, I love
And I say, I say
Everyday, everyday
Said I got, I got (an angel)
And I love, I love (my angel)
And I say, I say (she's an angel)
Everyday, everyday (she's my angel)


[Verse 1]

Daily, nightly, you are in my world
Words can't, say how, much I need you girl
Still I'd, like to, try and find a few
To paint a, picture, of how I feel for you


[Bridge]

Inspiring, unbelievable, I'm smart enough to know
That only the real, could speak the truth
And I don't lie, baby I need you


[Hook]

So real, I hope you understand the way I feel, inside
So clear, there's only one girl I want right here, in my life
And that's the way I feel about you baby
No lie
I swear that there's an angel missing from heaven, tonight
And the angel is mine
Said I got, I got (an angel)
And I love, I love (my angel)
And I say, I say (she's an angel)
Everyday, everyday (she's my angel)


[Verse 2]

Lying, cheating, I would never dare
I'll be, honest, that's how much I care
For you, I'll give, up the playboy rules
They're overrated, when compared to you


[Bridge]

[Hook]


[Verse 3]

You'll be the real, could speak the truth
And I won't lie, baby I need you
And I only hope, you need me the same
Cause without you, I'm less of a man


[Bridge]

[Outro]

So real, I hope you understand the way I feel, inside
So clear, there's only one girl I want right here, in my life
And that's the way I feel about you baby
No lie
I swear that there's an angel missing from heaven, tonight
And the angel is mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
Said the angel is mine[Verse - Juvenile]
Juvenile and Mario pimping and we on deck
So stay tune to ya programs cause we on next
I wanna see the women catching the wall
Unless she got that disease, no ass at all
For the hood, for the club, videos or whatever
I got that oldschool, the Bentley or the Porsche Carerra
Profiling with the top off
Wilding, looking for a dime piece I can knock off

[Verse - Mario]
Up in the spot sipping on a little something
Feeling like this joint's is bout to pop off
Looking around trying to spot a little something
Trying to see what somebody talking bout
And if it's good I'm a lend my ear
To a little bit of game all up in my ear
I think I found a window over here
Homegirl is all up in my face like (boom)
Oh yes indeed, all we needed is a hell of a beat like (boom)
And we gon to jam cause I'm feeling like a Yeah! tonight

[Chorus - Mario]
Hold up it's like (boom!)
That's that beat we like
Bet it make the party jump off (boom!)
DJ spin that twice, we about to tear this club up! (boom!)
Ladies you gotta move something (boom!)
Cause the fellas wanna see ya shake something like (boom!)
We got the party getting crunk!
If you don't give a damn, gon throw it up!

[Verse - Mario]
No more siting on the wall little shorty
Starting to feel like a stone cold party
Don't act like you can't sit wit me
Everybody in the club getting tipsy
Ain't this beat on fire, DJ spin it back one more time
Fill my glass up one more time
We gon start it up right on time like (boom)
Yes indeed, all we needed is a hell of a beat like (boom)
And we gon to jam cause I'm feeling like a Yeah! tonight

[Chorus - repeat 2x]

[Verse - Juvenile]
She know about the grill and want to see my teeth
And if we ever bump heads they want to be my freak
She pulling on me cause she feel that heat
She don't wanna go to sleep she wanna feel that meat
That's a Lil Jon beat playa, run that back
It's aight if you kinda tipsy and you fall off track
I'm feeling great, I just had me a drink
She twurking over there, I'm bout to see what she thinks

[Bridge - Mario]
Say oh ohhh! Let's take it to the floor (B'More let's go)
Say yeah! do it like you don't care (WOO! A-Town!)
We gon do it all, from the windows to the wall
Let's gooo!! Let me see ya get low (get low) get low (get low)
Represent yo town (B'More! B'More!)
Throw up your hood (A-Town! A-Town!)
Represent yo town (Jersey! Jersey!)
Throw up your hood (get down now)
Represent yo town (LA let's go!)
Throw up your hood (Chicago!)
Represent yo town (Miami!)
Throw up yo hood (New York!)

[Chorus - repeat 2x]Ha, ha, listen, you know I do it for the ladies
Lambourghini Moss and uh see
I done had my share with the right but um
Look there's something about you, baby
Got me going crazy and that's my lady, yeah, ha, ha

Look, it's like this girl got me going all out
I got a few sick days, yeah, I'ma call out
Scoop shorty, hit the mall then we ball out
Catch a movie, grab a bite then fall out

I got her spoiled wrotten
She keep her jaws droppin'
The latest wear she rockin'
Gotta couture poppin'
(Fresh)

And what's more shockin'
Them whores at the door knocking
Ain't worth a second in my G-shock when
She in them pumps, not them Reeboks kid

The only time we fight is on the wii boxin'
I don't even keep up with how many g's I spend
Usually I keep a safe with the key locked in
But she a new type, maybe a new wife

Maybe the one I settle with in a new life
I gotta see, it's moving fast right now
I needa have a conversation with Shad and Bow Wow
Cause ahh

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down
But you made me proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
Cause I never had no one love me like this

Like wha? Like this
Like wha? Like da,da,da,da, like this girl

I guess, I'm kinda open just sitting here hoping
That what we shared is more than a joke and
We can last like the great ones do
As long as our love for each other stays true

Look, I see the growth, we done both came a long way
Arguments here and there,fuss and fightin'
Just showing that we care can't nobody else compare
Start it over with another, neither one of us would dare

All she gotta do is holla and her baby will be there
Ain't a doubt about it in my mind that we a perfect pair
Can't think of anyone, that's how I wanna spend my years
Try my hardest not to hurt her

Hate to bring her to them tears
And I know just how it feel when I whisper in her ear
No, I let her drive a stick, she know how to work dem gears
Ain't gotta worry 'bout the chicks I meet during my career
Me going somewhere should be the last of her fears

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down
But you made me proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
Cause I never had no one love me like this

She's my L.O.V.E
Used to be scared of relationships but this one I can't deny
You my L.O.V.E, yeah, and when you see her
You see me for her, I ride or die like Ruff Ryders

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down
But you made me proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
Cause I never had no one love me like this[Intro]
Whoa Whoa 1-2-3-4
What's up girl?
Let me holler at you for a second
I just want you to know
All of those other girls
They never meant anything to me
Your the only one for me

[Verse 1]
You turned me on, sounds so good talking fast
But before we go on there's something I should ask
Not about your past cause I don't care who came before me
No, my maturity is bigger than that
I am more curious 'bout what you truly want
Do I sense sincerity or just good talk
I don't care about the rumor mill
But be understanding how you truly feel for me
And yea, I want you sexually

[Chorus 1]
But I ain't talking bout that, ain't talking 'bout them
(Ain't talking bout her), ain't talking 'bout him
(I'm talking 'bout trust), I'm talking 'bout truth
(I'm talking 'bout me) and what I'm giving you
(This is my heart), please take care
(This is my heart), always be there
(This is my heart), some things you can't take
(This is my heart)So whatever you do
Please don't break my heart

[Verse 2]
Some girls are satisfied with cash in hand
And some girls are happy just to have a man
But my heart has my word to never put her in the way of harm
So even though I like your charm

[Chorus 2]
But I ain't talking bout that, ain't talking 'bout them
(Ain't talking 'bout her), ain't talking 'bout him
(I'm talking 'bout trust), I'm talking 'bout truth
(I'm talking  bout me) and what I'm giving you
(This is my heart) so treat it like gold
(This is my heart), pretend that it's yours
(This is my heart), it's too valuable to bruise
(This is my heart)
So whatever you do, don't loose my heart

[Bridge]
One night isn't gonna get you no where
There's so much to learn
And what you dedicate to me you'll get back in return
Now my bedroom game is sick
If that's only the half of it
(I need love), I'm tired of the same
(Gimme love) before you gimme game

[Chorus 3]
I ain't talking bout that, ain't talking bout them
(Ain't talking 'bout her) ain't talking 'bout him
(I'm talking 'bout trust), I'm talking 'bout truth
(I'm talking 'bout me) and what I'm giving you
(This is my heart), so before you tell a lie
(This is my heart), draw me a line
(This is my heart), remember pain's too rough
(This is my heart)
So whatever you do, please don't break my heart

[Outro]
(I ain't talking bout that, ain't talking bout her)
(I'm talking 'bout trust), I'm talking 'bout truth
(I'm talking 'bout me) and what I'm giving you
(This is my heart), my heart
(This is my heart, This is my heart)
So whatever you do, don't break my heart
(This is my heart)(Talking:)
Yo this game is over man
I can't do this no more
Tired of frontin'
Life ain't the same
I miss you
I need you

(Verse 1:)
It's been way too long
Since you up and gone
I'm madder than ever cause you won't pick up the phone
And I'm tired of actin' like I ain't hurtin'
I told you, "you could leave"
I helped you pack your bags
Who knew that when you left
I'd be askin you back
It ain't about my ego cause I hate to lose
But more than that, my heart's been bruised

(Chorus:)
Life's too hard, can't even breathe
Wherever you are, reach out to me
I got this chick, that chick
But it don't matter
Cause I still love the one that got away
And I'm in need of, your kiss and your touch
Girl I'm screaming, I miss you so much
I got this house, this whip
But it don't matter
Cause you're still the one that got away

(Verse 2:)
Do I ever cross your mind?
You know the rest
Try to relax, but I'm stressed
Thoughts of you, keep me pressed
Holdin' hands, stealin' kisses
I'm at the bar, makin' wishes
Now I'm twisted, trippin', tryin' like hell to fix it
Girl I got to get it
Back to the way it was, back to happy times
Back when I was yours, back when you were mine
It ain't about my ego, cause I hate to lose

But more than that, my heart's been bruised

(Chorus:)
Life's too hard, can't even breathe
Wherever you are, reach out to me
I got this chick, that chick
But it don't matter
Cause I still love the one that got away
And I'm in need of, your kiss and your touch
Girl I'm screaming, I miss you so much
I got this house, this whip
But it don't matter
Cause you're still the one that got away

(Verse 3:)
This can't be right
How did I become the reason you ain't at home
I'm out my mind
I don't want to be the reason why I'm alone
I need one more thing
I need one more try
I need one more day
I need one more night
This ain't about my ego, though I hate to lose
But more than that, my heart is bruised
It's been way too long
Since you up and gone
I'm madder than ever cause you won't pick up the phone
And I'm tired of actin' like I ain't hurtin'

(Chorus: x2)
Life's too hard, can't even breathe
Wherever you are, reach out to me
I got this chick, that chick
But it don't matter
Cause I still love the one that got away
And I'm in need of, your kiss and your touch
Girl I'm screaming, I miss you so much
I got this house, this whip
But it don't matter
Cause you're still the one that got away

And every part of your body is so edible
I get tears from just thinking bout it
But that ain't the reason why i'm stuck and can't let you go
We got a serious serious bond
And when we kick it we have nothin' but fun
I feel a whole lot of L-O-V-E between you and me
Even though we still young
Just your company ain't gota get none
Talk the same lingo, understand where i'm coming from
And if anybody ask me a question about you
I'ma tell em you the one
You got me like

Wooo-hooo
And when i think about you
That the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like
Wooo-hooo

Wooo-hooo
And when i think about you
That's the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like
Wooo-hoo
Shawtie you can get it all
You can get it all, you can get it

As long as you know that
I can have any girl i want to
Baby that sexual infectual
But still i choose you to be
With me and were gonna
So you better not break it up
You got me like

Wooo-hooo
And when i think about you
That the first thing that come to my mind

I know you heard my reputation
You don't think i would ever do right by you
You think that if you and i was in a relationship
I would never be true (be true)
You think that anything i say is straight gang
And to me your just another new name
But what i'm tryna tell you for every man
Theres a woman that'll make him change
And i believe you the one that'll make me
But any time i try to show you you shake me
I know i make it real hard for you to take me serious
But baby girl i am (i am)
And i ain't stoppin' right here, i'ma keep going
And i'm gonna make sure everyday tat you keep knowing
Weather if i have to send you flowers
Or talk to you on the cell-phone for few hours
I'm yellin like..

Wooo-hooo
And when i think about you
That the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like
Wooo-hooo
Baby you can get it all

That's the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like

(One, one, one, one)
One minute you act like you like me
And then the next you dont
You still sending me crazy emails
Like i know its just sex you want
I can't lie the sex is truly incredible
And every part of your body is so edible
I get tears from just thinking bout it
But that ain't the reason why i'm stuck and can't let you go
