[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Verse 1]
MauSe
Fumes from the paint can, slither through the night
Tunes from a waste land, visionary light
I'm giving people life from the mouth of a reaper
I'm like Malcolm the teacher, announced through the speaker
My father taught me that buying a house is procedure
And beds are a privilege when a couch cushions cheaper
Sleeping on the floor isn't a doubtful procedure
When your dreams are the reality of doubt to receivers
Leaving my mark, in a literary state
On buildings and estates, no filters for my paint
I'm filming what I make
Dark clothes on, what I throw on, these pilgrims wanna hate
On the pillars that I make
A gathering for my comrades
Passionate what I forecast
Question marks on they forehead
Looking at me when they walk past
Outlaw throwing the law out
There's an out-pour of what I thought out
Cops got me all sought out
Cause my work now get me more clout
Uh
Building my name up, never thought it get like this
Yall do the same stuff, yall ain't see no shit like this
Remain humble through it all, man I don't Bogart
Remember my past life and that helps me go so hard
Sleeping on benches, the stenches from the bums are so relentless
But so is my drive, my hearts an engine
Fuel, labored so long fingers that draw what I have viewed
My table is gone, eat on the floor while I chew
Young painter looking at the front pagers
The basquiats, the warhols, all the plush painters
Inspiration on a daily basis
I copped a can and went bombing like Hiroshima in train stations
Last name numerical
Question what I'm telling you
Ill question plus riddle you like Batman in the physical
Think about it, & keep it with you like a souvenir
And when you do come find me, ill be in Union Square

[Outro: Basquiat]
I think its a lot of people that are neglected in art, I don't know because if its too many of the paintings or what. But um... I know black people are never really portrayed realistically. Or not even portrayed in modern art. Its just um... Up for a change you know?And I'm a leave on one more note
One more motherfuckin note
It's like this, look at him

[Verse 1: Drake]
I ain't been here in a minute
Cut the lights off I feel fantastic right now baby
I said I used to keep the porch lights on and now
I keep the Porsche's lights on just to let them know their foresight's wrong
Where this rapper goin' with that obscure ice on
He a lame I'm just tryna get my mature life on
OD OD, everybody know me
Even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C
Oh me oh my them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip get a glass pour the X.O. in
I dare one these niggas to say that I'm not insane
Pick a road cause where you drivin is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C life is not a game
Taking over the world no Pinky just a lotta Brain
He bout to send them the shit that I'm on
You prolly could have predicted I'm on
My sense of judgment is officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the swisha is blown
I'm grown, I'm grown I'm livin' in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high I'm never comin' down
And you say you got them hoes but they never comin' round
I got Penthouse walls, I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over (bitches)
But moneys over (her)
Cause money's under (nothin')
My life is such a (blur)
That's not the way it has to go it's jus what I prefer
And do not disagree with me it's best you jus concur
I'm a legend with a legacy that can't help but survive
Even when I fuckin' die they gonna bury me Alive

[Refrain]
And I'm so prestigious, I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight no creases
P P P Peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air... we good (O.D. O.D.)
Bithces over there... we good (O.D. O.D.)
Money on the floor we good, O.D. O.D everybody know me
[Verse 2: Travis McCoy]
Oh no Travie high on life again... (Wow)
Feel like I swallowed a whole bottle of Vicodin... (Dam)
So high I wanna cry like tiny violins
In my best mode Depeche Mode enjoy the silence... (Shh)
Stop the violence, how when every line I write
Is like the motherfuckin Watts riots pouring out of my pen
Iight dam be easy I'm a get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics but I can't leave the crib without some xanax in my wallet... (Nope)
Hello my name is Travie and I'm a life-aholic
Told'em all these beats is like the Wallace to my Gromit
The Alfred to my Bruce Wayne, stripes on my candy cane
One without the other, Soul 4 Real without the Candy Rain
Super trooper like a gun-toting handyman
Ask me how I'm livin bet I tell ya fine and dandy man
Check his vital signs, they peakin' off the meter man
I'mma live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
Fuck pulling the nine out
I'ma pull a Amy Winehouse
Sippin' Purple Rain with Mary Jane girls in my house
Isaiah I'm a see ya when I get there
Until then hold me down like gravity it's Travie...Uno...Easy

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Ha I’m bout to overdose on life somebody please pass the needle
So if I comatose tonight you won't have to ask the people
If the things that I seen through my Prada frames got me paid
Watch me mane I'm cocky slave with this Rocky chain
I got I got my veins cluttered with this bud
And this name of it is Fame and it's all up in my blood
Tyna suppress the too fresh feeling I got... Oooo yes
I'm in it for the hugest duplex, livin' like I'm Hugh Hef
Every other night I need a brunette for group sex
Leaving with a bruise neck then I yell whose next... (Next)
Stand 'em in a line this is New Factz City
Take this crack between your thighs (Yeah)
(Mickey what you mean?)
I'm promethazine fuck the queen
Sniff the white horse of success and then let him lean... (Let'em see)
Tryna match my high on life... (Then let'em dream)
Gotta catch the spot on my flight
First class known of the aroma of the smoker life
Got me like a stoner, a zoner but nah it's never over
(Mickey what you mean?)
I stick my tongue out sippin Remy conceited of I'm teasing every bum out
Hung out with celebrities from every drug house
So when you remember me say that I was strung out
I'm an addict for the green cash I'm a O.D
So fluck going to rehab

[Refrain][Thoughts from MauSe]

[Intro]
Question!

[Hook]
Move for me
I move for you
Move for me
I move for you
I'm just taking pictures of girls naked
I'm just taking pictures of girls naked
I'm just taking pictures of girls naked
I'm just taking pictures of girls naked

[Verse 1]
It's nice to meet you darling, she said Hello to me
She was a pretty young thang, but she was grown to me
I asked for red wine, she had alcohol for me
Put on a show for me, then get exposed for me
Her hands were on herself, but she had a hold on me
I picked my camera up and told her ass to pose for me
Take photo's for me, take off them clothes for me
Put on this robe for me, real slow for me
Got Anita Baker on, watching as you dancing
I'm looking at through a lens, see that photo flashing?
Let you turn around, Pull it off your shoulder
Got your bra & thong on, see my Minolta
Spy on what your hands do, see your hands move
Down to where your pants used to be, I need a chance to
Check you in your glory, make this photo glossy
Look right in this camera and take it off for me
All off...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Right strap fall
Left strap fall
Right strap off
Left strap off
I see your bra, now I see it gone
Don't know your cup size, but I wanna drink it all
Breast out, black thong, too fresh, silk baby
Lately, I'm like Hugh Heff with this film baby
Shutter click, what a trip, this is fucking sick
I'm taking flicks of a naughty chick, that's sexy and really love to strip
Your thong is sitting on ya hips, let your thumb stretch it out
Stay right there, hold up, don't move, check you out!
Polaroid, lemme air the picture out
Put your frame, up in a frame then get it framed for my house
This is art, as I capture you all in the nude
This a photoshoot interview for my visions view
Thank you baby, I love the way you move
& next time you come through, you gotta bring your crew...
Naked!

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Oh this is perfect, this is perfect. Ho- hold it right there. Right there, yes, yes yes. Arch, arch ya back just a little bit. Right there, yes yes. Hold. Yes. Just like that. Don't move. Perfect!

[Hook](Hook 1)
In our dying words
Will we make the right decision
In our dying words
Will we say just how we feel
In our final hour
Will we be able to speak
To the ones we miss the most
For it's only god we seek
In our dying words

(Verse 1)
Uh, I've spent a couple years searching
For something that was urgent, is this the ultimate purpose
Kicking my little raps (?) like fuck I'm the greatest
Wasn't being myself, I just reenacted my favorites
An adolescent, learning nothing lasted forever
But you can leave a legacy, fuck it I'll give it effort
These verses gave me a chance to believe in me
When all I saw was doubt around my city repeatedly
It's 2012 and all I know is my father's feeding me lies
I see it in his eyes, all he's trying to do is provide and I don't have the time
All I can do is focus and rhyme
My competition's winning, this isn't what I envisioned, dog
I need more, my lord, young and impatient
Don't wanna leave this world without reaching my destination
Excel ahead of the curb, huh
We all just want our voices being heard

(Hook 2)
In our dying words
Will we make the right decision
In our dying words
Will we say just how we feel
In our final hour
Will we be able to speak
To the ones we love the most
For it's only god we seek
In our dying words

(Verse 2)
Uh, family matters I never got it, was dumb and rebellious
These are the times where I was careless
When niggas had me gassed, I was coming off of eleven grand
(?) would come into alignment
It's funny at seventeen, on the edge of your dream
I don't hold a chip on my shoulder, but fuck a Jermaine Dupri
It's amazing I see
Falling off of major proportions to figure out what's important
Me and my mother speak every day, the love is enormous
Progression from a time where arguments over money were cutting our family ties
She's, climbing a ladder of aging, that's why I'm slaving
I hope she understands that it's more than personal wagers
I hope she gets to see me be more than what she expected
Achieving everything that this visionary projected
Mother dearest, know that I murdered your last nerve
I promise you everything in the world
In our dying words

(Hook 1)

(Verse 3)
Uh, Throwing caution to wind
Now it's more than bargaining wins, I am targeted since
I had a check on my reality, plus it's like a salary
Really started fucking with my mentality
Time is waiting for no man
Here today, you're gone tomorrow
I start to question what I have to offer
What is a man if he can't provide for his fam
Doesn't signify who I am, but it plays a part in my insecurities
Plus the stresses keep luring me
Into places I never thought I would ever be
Sitting moving cleverly, sick of all of this jealousy
Making up excuses for why these niggas ahead of me
I really need to let it be
I'm going through something, my woman's touch is so heavenly
Reminds me why I fight for this shit
I live my life for this shit
In my lowest stages, I still become a favorite
Could have been with ballas, but she picked a struggling artist
Don't mind me I'm venting
I'm concerned with all of these worries
Twenty-three yeah I'm young, but I'm still in a fucking hurry
A young man's sport, gotta make it before you thirty
They getting younger and younger, nobody's truly deserving
It's real, I'm just giving you the truth in this song
Before I leave, David Copperfield, poof and be gone
I pray I do it all, everything that I deserve
Nothing less, as I take my last breath
In our dying words

(Hook 2)

(Outro)
I've been searching, searching, searching
I recall days, sitting in sun rays
Fourth grade while, park patrons played on swings
Slides, and with chess games I cried
Dreaming of better days
Who am I?
When my aunt passed I didn't even say goodbye
Because, I was so mad
A runaway, on his own path
Searching, searching, searching
Who am I?
Walking through K-Mart
Opening food without paying for it takes heart
No job, just, searching
Astronaut thoughts, basketball sports, practice law talk, rapping's my source, and yet
Who am I?
Being on a quest to search and find can take time
Parallel lines between him and I can't cause us to collide
Nor divide, but rather, coincide
Doubts and clout will sprout throughout our brains to our lungs then our mouths
As we announce then pronounce then shout, what we're about
With dreams of having our own land
Our own families
Our own house
While searching within to bring it all out
Who am I?
Am I me?
Am I you?
No, No
I am we, and I am Q
Factz

(Skit)
QuESt's Mom: "Make sure you call me when you land out there. Remember baby, you can always come back home if you need to. I love you."[Intro]

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
And I never came down from the last time
But that don't mean nothing, niggas still climbing
Bitches popping bottles and they sipping pink diamonds
I took a break from the game and I seen these niggas clowning
The blogs wouldn't be the same if you took Spitta out it
Props to the ones who instrumentally getting me popping
Balling without first learning the fundamentals, forget about it
Tryna 360 up the middle, you ain't even learn to dribble
Twiddling my thumbs smoking lime
Watching hamster ass rappers running wheels going nowhere with their rhymes
Stuck, Glenn Robinson big dog bus, socks up, top down, killing squares, riding around
Coolest nigga in yo city, even when I'm not in town
Smoking like I signed for 50 million and I'm underground
Yeah, uh
Smoking like I signed for 50 million still underground

[Verse 2: J-Lie]
And who we are, flow away above all, see
If I didn't rap I still look like a star, just admit, you know
You can spot me from afar, no big diamond chain that was so old for
Just a mention going up, it's nothing that I fire
Put the ladies sleeping over, slumber parties every night
Get your flights from … sending me all over
Bring me to the club, cause all the bitches like
What other rapper you know can call from Dakota, anger ...and call from a favor
And Brooklyn and Queens cause they got I'm a king
Avoiding tattoos, ...take the music …
My kicks so is fresh no scuffs from the ground, this nigger's too fly, can't get scuffs from the clouds
This ain't even my city but shit might as well, that's why me and spitta sold out ATL

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Jet setter, I've been iller, causing vendettas with all of you Ben Stillers
These little fuckers hate my endeavors, time for men sweaters under chinchillas
Trend setter, kick killer my feet wear caskets
Fresh to death and rare glasses, the bomb bottles, rose petals and Ford models
Who all follow my Twitter and still sword swallow
DM me, got him in the frenzy, it's all about the benjies
I'm feeling like the kembe, block haters stop player I'm so clean
My pockets love the earth baby they go green
Sitting back in that cold thing, wanna rock the mic but she don't sing
Messing with the flow king, kiss the gold ring, pucker up buttercup, or knuckle up to these punch lines that uppercut

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Chillin in my teepee, no indian but he be
The realest shit I must admit I'm baskin in my feces
My style is harder, yours is watered down they call it fiji
The bible or my CD, both of them were said to be the
Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill
House party with killers, pray for Italy villas
Where accents think it's Buffy and chandeliers hang from ceilings
I'm dreaming, I'm scheming to be major
Compose art like a Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus, today is
The day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain
The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
Paper bout the forest tree, acres of that THC
I don't smoke but homies do, find the cloud and have a seat
And I wonder how ... live to see 80
I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes[Intro]
That was cute man, that was real cute
Now you about to get some competiton
Cause i dont know if anyone else is gonna say anything
So we about to get into this
We about to bring this all the way back to the Bronx, know what i mean
S'Mickey - Black apple, bitch
XMJ, peace to Lord GFC
Yeah, I'm ready

[Verse]
Where I've been at, what I'm up to
Nobody cares so my response is fuck you
Black apple patron in the city y'all black foes
Throw my hues like Langston
I dont know what you thinkin
So Kendrick wanna play this game? Cool, I got you
Game point and I spot you
Shoot over you then I watch you
Look over to see the ball go through the net when i washed you
You knew who to name in that song and who not to
From the bottomless pit, out comes the pit
Treatin kenny like Bane after he blew Gotham to bits
Gotta be Mick, got the slick tho
This is what you wanted nigga?
Competition from a killer that's a tundra spitter - cold
I wonder what your steez did your sunny iller bars
Black out eyes just like your album cover, nigga
You the king of New York? Beg your pardon
The king of LA is dead and that nigga from Harlem (2Pac)
Don't be like Ja Rule mimicking him
Or we gonna sell you drunk outta that pool of liquor again
Who Bishop against? None of y'all
You avoid juice
Fake Omar Epps, just be a schoolxboy, Q
Gonna prove Factz wrong, talk over that shit
You set the bar high, nigga, I vault over that shit
Hollywood star, nigga, I walk over that shit
You say you sick? I cough over that shit
Who want this?
I'm targeting you, calling your crew
Who see the soul of Ab fly if he sparring with you
Homie it's true
But you know what? I ain't gonna namedrop y'all to death
Cause Hova's team is the only Jay Rock we respect
New York, no beef, just lyrical warfare
I heard the record sat in my lawnchair like aw yeah
I'm at the window like Malcolm looking at y'all scared
You at your internet window, you saying I'm soft, where? (where?)
You love my city, keep it accurate, dawg
Stole Loso's haircut and think you got fabulous bars?
Oh yeah, you used to copy Charles Hamilton, dawg
A good kid turned the mad city after him y'all
Plus the girl you was rumored with is outta New York
I guarantee his lady go gaga over this song
I aim for the soul with them bars, I won't spare it
I'm just concerned with the haters who hate after they hear us
So if Black Hippy step they gonna die off, bless
Vampire with the bars, I'mma find y'all next
Killing everybody, you can cosign those bets
You shot and got a quick return like the IRS (pow!)
Better than you, said it back in twenty ten though
Polic with the penstroke, call up all your kinfolk
Mighty with the sword, Ninja Gaiden
It's shockin how I held back and came at 'em full force
Remember Raiden (yeah)
Let's bet on the next threat, new cess next
You struggle with the bars over your head like a benchpress
Telling you right now, don't talk around me
Cause out west you couldn't picture getting hit like a papparazzi
Black apple, I'm ready to set it off
Coming for the bank, who ready to play the God?
While I'm busting open doors everybody on the floor
Put the money in the bags, don't ring any alarms
I'm taking over the town, Ben Affleck on the song
Ain't no king of New York, Biggie gone, Christopher Wallace
Put it on the blogs for the frauds, make a response
I'll be here with the rest of my city holding the fort
Reality gonna show him that I'm raw
But can he get cancelled with his bitch? That's Khloe and Lamar

Let's have it, lets have some fun, you know
You wanted to have some fun? Well, let's do that then
You know, make sure y'all ready
Cause clearly we're ready over here
You know

Nah, fuck, I got another verse
I bet the funeral home got a stash, reverend got another church
Two arts and mouse
I'd rather battle Picasso and Dali in the gardens of Garvey
Shadowbox with Ali, postin up Barkley
Hypnotize...[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Verse 1]
Body out of order
Alcohol flowing, not a lot of water
Manslaughter with the magic marker
In the lobby of Madison Square Garden, I loiter
The Knicks just got Kenny Walker
Bernard King is the best scorer
Still a sketch drawer, had a fresh aura
Sorta
Married to my art, but my style just altered
Ya see, ya see I'm sloppy 'round borders
My man told me about chalk he had imported
The rumor 'round town is he snorted
He said he was drawing, oh that's what you call it? Heh...
Nose candy, made his whole soul happy
In cold alley's in the gutter like a bowling alley
I caught a strike when he tried to throw it at me
Ironically I took a hit like a soldier rally
Yea
White lines is a vacation
I seen Keith Haring use it in the train station
Uh
He drew it out like he was play making
It was cleaner than spray painting
I had a new safe haven
Took me a while, but I became patient
Like an AIDS patient, that's waiting up for a grave placement
My whole style shifted, lifted, hit it and got addicted from the moment I sniffed it

[Hook]
I got cocaine, running around my brain
I got cocaine, running around my brain

[Verse 2]
Using chalk in Paradise Garage
A bar on the Lower East Side that show art
And whenever the stars come through they bogard
We treat Madonna like Mozart, Oh God
We got so large, Tony Schafrazi is digging the whole spark it was a cold start
Bags of teacher material was imperial
Got us all high we were aerial
Girls still dig it no burial
Rolled a hundred dollar bill
Ben Frank got stoned with me, what a higher thrill
Writing skills got sharp like a lions grill, I got a fire feel
These other guys are fire drills, false alarms with minor appeal
Acquired a deal to sculpt got hired for steel
Admire the will, daily rush of the fairy dust
Got my face flush, what a scary touch serious
Fab 5 Freddy, had to get me from the telly
I was passed out all over the floor like confetti
Parade got rained on
No umbrella for that brainstorm
Piece of white got my brain worn
A work of art with my frame torn
Sick as a bat but I'm Bruce Wayne calm, with a cape on
Hospital bed, I.V. in my vein long
Can't wait until this pain gone...
Chalk

[Cee-Lo Greene]
All I want is your understanding, as in the small like of affection

[George Jung]
The official toxicity limit for humans is between 1 and 1 1/2 grams of cocaine depending on body weight. I was averaging 5 grams a day maybe more. I snorted 10 grams in 10 minutes once. I guess I had a high tolerance

[Cee-Lo Greene]
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up. Don't Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up. Wake up, Wake up, Wake up

[Verse 3]
Early morning flight
Got the red eye
Looking like a jedi
Light saber
Life saver
Body not in Ny
Flight taker
Ice breaker
Rambling am I?
Disoriented...
In & outta conscious, dealing with the nonsense
No longer pompous
Obnoxious, Rambunctious
The socialites at my bedside, prayers up above
Unicorns are flying, maybe its the drugs
Crush on my nurse, lady in her scrubs
They say I got a buzz... Whaaaat?
Dedicated wall with my picture on it
Inebriated floors full of liquor on it
I ain't dead yet
I RSVP'd for the pearly gates, haven't got in yet
Neighbor in the next bed, lost his left leg
On his deathbed, he was a meth head
Chalk put me in a yolk like fresh eggs
I hope for the best meds
Drawing question marks in jet red
Jet blue
Jet black
Memory lost track
I lost track
Call back
Jupiter is hotter in the winter
When the birds gotta swim across the river to get dinner
Lost a lotta weight, I'm feeling thinner
H20 in my ex eyes, I forgive her
I've seen better days
If I past, after I die, sellebrate[Thoughts from MauSe]

Interviewer: Mr. President, in talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed mistakes of the past, and you have blamed the congress. Does any of the blame belong to you?

Ronald Reagan: Yes because for many years, I was a Democrat

Crowd: *laughs*

[Verse 1]
They say illuminati's in the air
That's why the dollar bill has an eye
What if I told you that I didn't care?
Because the pyramid doesn't cry
Which means they don't see the kids grieve
In the inner cities, that they let the outsiders blitzkrieg
But the outsiders get these, warrants to get things all up in the mean streets
Commentary on the brick wall
They made it monetary off a pitfall
Kids see they mom and daddy all piss poor
Pitchforks in they arm, on the floor, rent gone
My mask up, as I tag up
Letting my views breathe life on the canvas
The fast buck put doom on my friends so I pray
But I still see grins everyday

[Hook]
& I can tell you know how hard this life can be...
But you keep on smiling for me
But the 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles
Keep on smiling for me
The 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles

[Verse 2]
Food stamps and welfare
That's what they giving us from Congress
They say you can't be helped here
I swear I think we need a conference
Conquests of areas breed conflict
And conflict makes convicts
Photo shoots for con flicks
It's like a jail contest
Pro's and cons for a congruent conscious
The concept of my spirit is acrylic
I let my art speak and my hear just mimics
Political cynics believe in a little pillage
But to raise one child it takes a small village
Mother on the corner tryna make money
Her slogan is ain't nothing that they can take from me
Things are rough right now, please pray for me
She just smirked as she waved to me

[Hook]
& I can tell you know how hard this life can be...
But you keep on smiling for me
But the 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles
Keep on smiling for me
The 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles

[Verse 3]
From Staten Island to Astoria
My 3y3's look at the government getting cornier
MauSe, I swear it feels ima foreigner
So many secrets Victoria, isn't sure of the
Signs, they hang in front of our 3y3's without a corridor
They all look at us blind but we are warriors
Can you dig it? They dominating
This is a fruit fight, let's impeach Ronald Reagan

[Hook]

[Outro: Ronald Reagan]
One of my favorite quotations about age, comes from Thomas Jefferson, he said that "We should never judge a president by his age only by his work." And ever since he told me that, I've stopped worrying. Just to show you how youthful I am, I plan to campaign in all 13 states

Crowd: *laughs*[Intro]
If you wanna feel rich
Just count the days you have, that money can't buy
It's Mickey

[Verse 1]
This is my second time talking on this beat
So it got too tight, was like Lebron with the Heat
I belong to the songs I record
Shit is deep as the waters in the pond or creek
I was born from the leak, ever week
I put my thoughts on the streets of the internet concrete
Walk with your feet as I take you on a voyage from the safety of the Cloisters
To the places down on [?] where they daily eatin' oysters
Rappers full of snakes and I'm playing in the poison
There's days I be saying that I hated that I joined in
Bunch of sensitive niggas that get offended when I mention that I'm better than niggas
I'm a competitor nigga, how can I sit around and listen to these lyrics now
Shit I said a couple years ago I'm hearing now (wow)
Lemme simmer down, digress and tell you about my progress
3 sets of managers, 5 guys 1 girl, shit was such a process
Hard for me to digest, did a video with Marshall label
Had a conference, conflicts, sad to see Jive had to die next
Got moved to RCA and had to fire my reps
Hired LA Reid's son and still couldn't drop next
Did Mickey Mouse, it was a classic ass concept, complex
Plus it got praised by Complex
Number 1 prospect, Swizz tweeted the project
Fiasco called it a masterpiece, full of [?]
Felt like Kevin Hart in Smart Tech
Yelling at the label for they wildness
That's the day that I left
3rd day before my birthday, it was July 10th
Underground railroad, left with my masters
No album on the shelf though, 2 mixtapes in 2 weeks, hell yeah bro
These other niggas moving snail slow
Let's go to the next year though, 20-13
It's only nightmares in Mickey's first dream
I sense envy, when did the city turn green I painted the town red
From an indigo scene I inspired folks
Just like when Biggie heard c.r.e.a.m
So for y'all to say you hate it
I feel the worst things, that's like asking Cyclops would he really hurt Jean
I probably do this for life like Eddie Murphy, and that's raw
I signed a deal in July, and that went caput
I rap but it feels like I'm trapped in a book (damn)
My words a latch with a hook, I'm sick of this
It's hard for me for to heal like the back of a foot
I had a track with Yelawolf, but that wasn't pushed
Then I'm added to a tour with my big brother Lu, I was happy to the core
It was only 3 shows wait, matter of fact 4, 1 got cancelled
From a storm that was Niagara Falls lost money from
What I had in store so Fiasco got a call and let him know the situation
And he said that he'll add a couple more, part of me said that I could travel to a mall
That's family for sure, I had sold out crowds I was practicing my art
Spray painted on a canvas in New York and it sold for 300 like I had to go to war, yep
That was my reward, but, but, but what about my feelings
I made money on the tour so where hell the digits
I called one man and [?] told her I was quittin'
And I'm not bullshittin' I said good riddance
I'm tired of the critics, I'm tired of the business
I'm tired of under sold shows, I'm tired of the gimmicks
I went on Instagram and I was tired of the pictures
I'm tired of writing lyrics, when lyrics aren't lyrics
To the spirits that'll hear us, see I'm tired of being gifted
Text saying getting replied to I guess my friends thought I was suicidal
I just needed space, I was prideful
Thought about working at a job too
Then I thought, that's remedial for my IQ
Rather look at life with my own birds eye view
Then I was mindful, got get it straight and doubt
If I keep rapping then I gotta make it count
I had 90,000 saved but in 20-14 I had 4.14 in the bank account
I had 4.14 in my bank account
I had 4.14 in my bank account
Now you see why I ain't wanna rap with artists
Buy colors when it ain't nothing to paint about
So I got on my knees this is what I pray about
Lord God my dreams and help me make it out (yeah)
Paying rent to my wallet
Negative account so I'm scarred to deposit
Running around town when I really should be jogging
And preserving all my energy instead I be willin'
I said this on the first rendition of the song but
Since you won't hear it then I figured I should drive it
(song fades)This song should be fading right now if you got it[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Hook]
If tonight is my last night, please don't cry
Just remember the good times of my life

[Verse 1]
Listen to the maestro, maestro
MauSe is a pyro
Sellebrate life yo, Psycho for a night show
Mudd club, paradise
Give me a drink and a pair of dice
And a hot girl that'll rock my world
Before I go to the after life
I ain't there yet
Don't care if I gotta year left
Just care if there's more beer left
That I can take to the head like a hair net
I been everywhere on a leer jet
I just need a girl I can stare at
Put my hands at, where her rear at
You hear that? I don't fear death
I scare death, so let's dance!

[Hook]
If tonight is my last night, please don't cry
Just remember the good times of my life
"Remember my life, my life, remember my life."
I'm gonna Sellebrate, Sellebrate
Whoaaa ooo ohhhh
Sellebrate!
Sellebrate, Sellebrate
Whoaaa ooo ohhhh
Sellebrate!

[Verse 2]
The night just started for me
Someone's daughters on me
Gave me a magic marker and asked can you start drawing on me?
Low life's in the spot
With Decepticons, no Auto-bots
Time to pose for a photo-op
Say cheese, this just what I need
My scene, this just what I mean
I'm free its just what I see
Living life, no regrets
But If I could turn no to yes
And turn water to wine, turn broke to checks
Turn over my soul, eternal rest
Wait my turn, no rush for me
I'm right where I want to be
Where you at though?

[Hook]
If tonight is my last night, please don't cry
"Enjoy the night, tonight, Enjoy the night, tonight."
Just remember the good times of my life
"Remember my life, my life, remember my life."
I'm gonna Sellebrate, Sellebrate
Whoaaa ooo ohhhh
Sellebrate
Sellebrate, Sellebrate
Whoaaa ooo ohhhh
Sellebrate!

[Verse 3]
Who wants to be mine tonight?
I'm tryna ride tonight
You know I can't drive tonight
I had too much wine tonight
That don't mean ima die tonight
But if I do, don't cry tonight
Remember me, everyday
After I die, Sellebrate!

[Bridge]
Its ok, its alright
Tonight is the night
Don't worry about tomorrow
We may never see a tomorrow
Let's dance till we see the sunshine!

[Hook][Intro]
Warning! Warning!
Evacuation will commence
In approximately one minute
Please stay tuned
Latch all available doors
Thank you

[Verse]
One, let your head nod to the drum
Two, I'm a tell you what to do
Three, hands are what I want to see
Four, let's get it on, forget about
Five, gots to get live
I want to see y'all hands in the sky
Put them up high, let's feel the vibe
Sorry, no magazine required
Hop in the ride, time to decide
I want to know if you ready for the drive
When we collide, it won't be a crash
More like a prize I won't let pass
I'm so fly, I got jetlag
I don't know why but I won't ask
And I won't brag, cause you'll get mad
Can't be touched, who is this bad?
Michael, flow is trifle
Doing handstands on a motorcycle
I'm so damn spiteful
It's hot when no one's like you
You wack cause no one likes you
It's sad cause no one tries to
We in the land of the lost
I'm lost in a land that I can't get across

I want to see underarms

[Hook]
Jump in my car
Step on the brakes
This is my job
Hand on the wheel

Ain't no facade, ain't no mirage
Everything you see is here, it's not far
Nah, it's not far, man it's right here
This is where it starts, let's get it clear

Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air

[Bridge]
Put, put them up high, let's feel the vibe
Just put them up high, let's feel the vibe
Just put them up high, let's feel the vibe
I want to see y'all hands in the sky

Put them up
Put them up high
Put them up
I want to see y'all hands in the sky

Omega!

[Hook]
Jump in my car
Step on the brakes
This is my job
Hand on the wheel

Ain't no facade, ain't no mirage
Everything you see is here, it's not far
Nah, it's not far, man it's right here
This is where it starts, let's get it clear

Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air

Omega![Peter Bjorn & John]
I'm a blue period Picasso stuck on a wall
In the middle of a hall in Barcelona
Trying to figure out
How to get down
Cause this solitude is bringing me down
The paintings around me
The paintings around me
The paintings around me
The paintings around me
The paintings around me
The paintings around me

[Naledge talking]
Let's have some fun y'all
Just gotta paint a picture for these niggas, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse One] [Naledge]
Now, now
See who walked in the room
Dance on the treble, see the 808 boom
Bad ass girl in the room, that is guarenteed boom
Where a place, wear you hat to the side, get a boom
You ain't heard about me get in-tune
Like a bitch, guaranteed I get a room
Make room for mister, Mister Go Illa
East side Godzilla
No one illa
Girl put 'em in three, just like Reg Miller
Hennessy and Hypno, call that Ferrigno
Call me Mr. Make Your Girlfriend Get Low
I don't care she like Lil' Jon, dip low
I'm on a mission.org
Guaranteed, in a lane, know I'm gonna score
Chicago Picasso in stores
And greatness be the only thing in store

[Hook] [Peter Bjorn John] [x5]
The paintings around me

[Mickey talking]
Uh huh. Sticky. Yo Boogie what up? Finally happened right?
Naledge, I see you. nVMe what up? Let's go

[Verse Two]
Art deco
Real life gecko
I'm so insured, the commercial said so
Street fighter in a E-Honda
Street bomber
Huh
Coulda been meat lawyer
Now
I'm the honorable
E'rybody rise
Givin' straight facts while e'rybody lies
Critics try to blame me
E'rybody cries
Live forever with aunt while e'rybody dies
No I
Why?
That's your answer
I was born sick
Cancer
Crab ass rappers left under the sea with one stanza
Incredible ask Sebastian
Drive headbangers to airbangers
Brother I'm the best painter with ten fingers
It's the Chicago Picasso
I'm New York's Leonardo
Don't get it backwards
I'm tryin' to get that Harpo

[Hook] [Peter Bjorn John] [x5]
The paintings around me

[Naledge talking]
I told y'all. We not playin' games this year, you know what I'm sayin'?
Picasso shit ain't playin' man. I'm paintin' extra

[Verse Three] [Naledge]
Cooler than a slim cigarette
I am fresh like this weeks broccoli, got me?
If rap was hockey, I'm Crosby
You're baby ass flow need a car seat
You just a backseat driver
I'm in the driver's seat with the livest speech
On the beach, so complete I'm the shit
When I reek, I release
I'm a beast
Little Verne Troyer's just Mini-Me's
That's a death wish to all my enemies
Think they fly till they crash like Kennedy
Junior, ya sleep with petunias
The truth
This not a rumor
I'm sick but this not a tumor
Platinum type tongue and a golden ass medulla
Brainiac, we the manure
Chew on!

[Hook] [Peter Bjorn John] [x5]
The paintings around me[Verse 1: A-live]

Down on my last dollar, god damn I better blow
Working harder ‘cause second place I can’t settle for
The will to win is the shit they give out medals for
Never fazed by the pain, this I was destined for
While you were out here partying, me and Ren were arguing
About album release dates, promotions and the marketing
My girl calling my phone but I can’t seem to answer it
Cause she don’t understand how the stress can get so damaging
Gave my mom more grief than I would prefer
But now she smile when my Beamer pull up to the curb
I did it ma, I made it ma, and I’m still your son
But now the pressure on ‘cause they saying I’m the one
So close I can taste it, a couple hours from greatness
A quiet kid but for the cash, I’m murdering like Mase did
Praying that we make it, but I don’t want to be famous
Living in my moment, I’m knowing we gonna take this

[Chorus: Anik Khan]

What we talking about, huh?
If it ain’t about paper, get from around us
Cause patience ain’t a virtue where we from bruh
It’s now or never so you better understand
We do this here by any means

[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]

Up and down, roller coaster this is what I’ve been through
Label after label, see the bullshit I get into
Never had a thought when I was 12 and had a pencil
Writing to an instrumental, I get paid off my mental
But I did it, I did it, and I’m still trying to get closer
I’m winning, I’m winning and I can’t stop till it’s over
Got a niece now that I’m proud of, get emotional when I hold her
Probably wouldn’t be rapping about 5 months ago if I didn’t know her
But I do, so that’s one plus one equals two
I added Q to that equation and my hunger really grew
Got doubted by some people that I thought I really knew
That ain’t nothing really new, hope you got a clearer view
‘Cause I’m Malcolm at window by any means
Martin while he marching, sleepwalking with many dreams
Michael Jackson, microphone magic in my Billie Jean
Set myself a goal and I’mma do it when I hit the scene, feeling me?

[Verse 3: Soupa]

Yo I'm tryna make a buck/
If I'm asleep then wake me up/
Im on the field that's on the real no time to chill n wait for luck/
Without a whip, I'll take the bus/
Miss the bus, I'll take a hike/
My foes be tryna take me light/
Shorties tryna spend the night/
But I been in my basement on probation/
I done harbored so much hatred, felt like god had left me fatherless and faded/
Now I'm off 40 ounce, stumble thru the city/
When you black and out of order don't nobody show you pity/
But I been a goon
A silver spoon is something I ain't used to
All the grindings made me coocoo, missing times that we would shoot hoops/
Now I can't tell who's who , my homie faded poppin pills, it's hard to chill/
I can't explain the pain I'm not no doctor Phil/
Sittin Replaying our lives like we were watching film/
I'm grown now lets play a little game it's called do not killed/
And I got the will to win, it's something that I feel within/
Hustle hard lets get it in, hustle hard lets get it in[Verse 1]
Both hands covering my face
I'm not really trying to talk to her
Laying down on my pillow case
It's so crazy how thoughts do you
Day before at a carnival, good times
Now I'm feeling horrible
Birthday in a couple a days and a part of you
Was saying what's wrong with you
And I say nothin'
Truth is cuz my brain cluttered
So I'm thinking what did she just take from it
She asks about my future and me being a loser
And I said look, I try to stay away from it
Coming from the man who said this the soundtrack for 2016 back in 2008
I had my hand covering my eyes
So she couldn't see my iris formulate a lay
Remember live order, Lauryn Hill on the chorus that July summer
6 years later and I guess I got karma
Should be on my third album but I'm far from it, damn
But she don't understand that
She wanna know where her best friend at
Where you been at, I think he been kidnapped
It's not the man she feel for, that shit whack
Baby, I agree with you
Because if I didn't I wouldn't even be with you
But it's different when your life get a mean issue
Wait, let me put it like this
Fellas if you got a job you love then you suddenly get fired
And you get another gig cuz surviving is required but you wanna go back
To the job you had prior but your girl is saying "we got bills" as a reminder
And deep down she don't know your a fighter
So what you do..

[Hook: HIRAETH]
And it's just a random thrills you know
Like you took an extra pill that you control
She's the one that makes me feel so high
Hate will always kill, but love never die

[Verse 2]
I felt bad when she left
She just want me to smile more and have real conversations
I be thinking what's next
We could be in the same room, not say one word
And it feel like we just met
Watch TV, cook each other food
Mad as hell at each other but we still just connect
That's what love mean to me
I don't want someone mad, that's when you try and give em space
When they get horny then you be up in their face
You ain't gotta spend money when you on a date
And you now deep down can't be replaced
That's ill, real, something you can feel
Gotta let it out there ain't nothing you can seal
Ima talk about it more on LoveLustLost part 2
So for now just enjoy everything you hear

[Hook]I’m like five years old moving around to six
Every Sunday morning Calvin and Hobbes comic strip
Tiger came alive, day before, I’m riding high
Watching X-Men at eleven it’s on channel five
Couple hours later in church singing songs to God
Me and my cousin Hal in the back recite a lot of rhymes
Had a Walkman by Sony, bootlegging shit
Three dollars to the Africans on one twenty-fifth
Clue tapes best to big out that was the manuscript
The Lox Family, DMX vs. Cannabis
Recording over gospel tapes, I was a fan of it
Inside stuff from ? to Analysts
Black Power Ranger was black, so amazing
Yellow Power Ranger was hot, she was an Asian
Wait a minute, black and yellow, Wiz Khalifa shit?
Yellow, Asian, damn I can’t believe this shit
Used to steal my pop’s CDs and put ‘em back later
Found out about Biggie by 'em, baby baby!
Michael Jordan dunking on Ewing, then there was Pippen next
Hardaway, Mourning, man we never get respect
‘Til Starks dunked on the Bulls, baseline crack
Bulls fans cried it was Horace, Jordan was in the back
Me? I was a Sonic fan I loved Shawn Kemp
Gary Payton throwing alley-oops to the strong pimp
Seven kids, six mothers, drug user, alcoholic
Before school I watched Zack kiss every freak
On Saved By The Bell, Lisa Turtle duckin’ Screech
Lark Voorhies was on fire, Never really liked Laura
Had a crush on Mira, would’ve banged out Topanga
Prolly got messy, dreamt of head from Kelly, would’ve gave pills to Jessie
Me and my cousin Vinny snuck and heard all The Chronic
Throwing fake guns in the air acting like Onyx
Found my pop’s porn on the shelf in his closet
Used to watch Janet Jacme scream loud getting popped in
Still a virgin, paper boy in baggy jeans
I had Parasucos with lines down the seams
Can’t we get along? We singing simple songs
Timothy McVeigh vs. Flex, who got the bigger bombs?
Cell phones big as a forearm, ditched prom
Didn’t have a date, my ex blamed it on Islam
Street Fighter that was the shit, I used Ryu
Played Genesis all day, Streets of Rage 2
Martha Stewart was a good thing
Stealing potato chips from the stores was a hood thing
The Knicks in the middle of the Finals
Olajuwon spinning off Ewing for the title
We had a Gulf War, what the fuck for?
Kids in Somalia died ‘cause they starved
Dawg, my president ain’t black
But my man got head and he sure can play the sax
Then he got an office in Harlem next to blacks
Smoked weed but he didn’t inhale, how real is that?
White boys in trench coats aired out Columbine
Tossing old kicks in the air on top of power lines
Worked a McDonald’s job for a dollar sign
And got fired for McFlurrys I was tryna slide
Forrest Gump on the bench sitting awkwardly
Ready to Die was my artery
I remember writing lyrics down from Bone Thugs N Harmony
Recite it back to my friends so they’d be a part of me
Loved Diddy before the shiny shit
I’m a 80s baby and a 90s kid, dig?[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Verse 1]
Body out of order
Alcohol flowing, not a lot of water
Manslaughter with the magic marker
In the lobby of Madison Square Garden, I loiter
The Knicks just got Kenny Walker
Bernard King is the best scorer
Still a sketch drawer, had a fresh aura
Sorta
Married to my art, but my style just altered
Ya see, ya see I'm sloppy 'round borders
My man told me about chalk he had imported
The rumor 'round town is he snorted
He said he was drawing, oh that's what you call it? Heh...
Nose candy, made his whole soul happy
In cold alley's in the gutter like a bowling alley
I caught a strike when he tried to throw it at me
Ironically I took a hit like a soldier rally
Yea
White lines is a vacation
I seen Keith Haring use it in the train station
Uh
He drew it out like he was play making
It was cleaner than spray painting
I had a new safe haven
Took me a while, but I became patient
Like an AIDS patient, that's waiting up for a grave placement
My whole style shifted, lifted, hit it and got addicted from the moment I sniffed it

[Hook]
I got cocaine, running around my brain
I got cocaine, running around my brain

[Verse 2]
Using chalk in Paradise Garage
A bar on the Lower East Side that show art
And whenever the stars come through they bogard
We treat Madonna like Mozart, Oh God
We got so large, Tony Schafrazi is digging the whole spark it was a cold start
Bags of teacher material was imperial
Got us all high we were aerial
Girls still dig it no burial
Rolled a hundred dollar bill
Ben Frank got stoned with me, what a higher thrill
Writing skills got sharp like a lions grill, I got a fire feel
These other guys are fire drills, false alarms with minor appeal
Acquired a deal to sculpt got hired for steel
Admire the will, daily rush of the fairy dust
Got my face flush, what a scary touch serious
Fab 5 Freddy, had to get me from the telly
I was passed out all over the floor like confetti
Parade got rained on
No umbrella for that brainstorm
Piece of white got my brain worn
A work of art with my frame torn
Sick as a bat but I'm Bruce Wayne calm, with a cape on
Hospital bed, I.V. in my vein long
Can't wait until this pain gone...
Chalk

[Cee-Lo Greene]
All I want is your understanding, as in the small like of affection

[George Jung]
The official toxicity limit for humans is between 1 and 1 1/2 grams of cocaine depending on body weight. I was averaging 5 grams a day maybe more. I snorted 10 grams in 10 minutes once. I guess I had a high tolerance

[Cee-Lo Greene]
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up. Don't Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up. Wake up, Wake up, Wake up

[Verse 3]
Early morning flight
Got the red eye
Looking like a jedi
Light saber
Life saver
Body not in Ny
Flight taker
Ice breaker
Rambling am I?
Disoriented...
In & outta conscious, dealing with the nonsense
No longer pompous
Obnoxious, Rambunctious
The socialites at my bedside, prayers up above
Unicorns are flying, maybe its the drugs
Crush on my nurse, lady in her scrubs
They say I got a buzz... Whaaaat?
Dedicated wall with my picture on it
Inebriated floors full of liquor on it
I ain't dead yet
I RSVP'd for the pearly gates, haven't got in yet
Neighbor in the next bed, lost his left leg
On his deathbed, he was a meth head
Chalk put me in a yolk like fresh eggs
I hope for the best meds
Drawing question marks in jet red
Jet blue
Jet black
Memory lost track
I lost track
Call back
Jupiter is hotter in the winter
When the birds gotta swim across the river to get dinner
Lost a lotta weight, I'm feeling thinner
H20 in my ex eyes, I forgive her
I've seen better days
If I past, after I die, sellebrate[Thoughts from MauSe]

Beck: "I can't believe what we've seen outside. You and me watching the jets go by."

[Verse 1]
I'm being watched for the wrong reasons
All scheming
They say they love you but they hate you in all seasons
They spring up when you win turns to more freedom
Cause they want summa ya bread before you fall screaming
Believe it, quiz Ripley about the kid mickey
The artist with 4 eyes but not from Mississippi
Ironically I ain't got nothing but vision in me
I'm ill when I paint words nobody sicker than me
I heal when I spray words its no Achilles with me
But clones still wanna kick and hit me
I scare bastards, ghost on the air you fear Casper
Eyes watch but it never works out for stare masters
I'm judged, every year after I hear laughter
Invade your mind, your ear captured, thereafter
So many people got opinions on my dominion
I've worked for what I've earned I'm not offended, I meant it

[Hook]
So many people... So many people...
"Where do I go? Where do I go?
I'll never know, I'll never know."
So many people... So many people...
"Where do I go? Where do I go?
I'll never know, I'll never know."

[Pre-Verse]
See its a shame, how money will make people strange
So when people change, I don't even give the people change

[Verse 2]
Your relatives are first to try & take advantage
Family tree cross me, then I'm breaking branches
Spray paint a canvas
Create a world you can't find like when God made Atlantis I'm displaying talent
Preying mantis, I make em panic
Rape the planet, fuck the world, I'm naked dammit
I came with nothing and I leave with nothing
I don't have faith in suckers I believe in something
And that's me, Mickey MauSe my splash reach
Is longer than rap sheets by criminal athletes
To me its a sport, vacation in the gulf
On a scale of one to ehh you know who ten is, of course
The Arthur Ashe of the street autographs
I'm the shit, you a toilet splash that's talking trash
Brain crowded, evade cowards
Mask on leave my mark on a strange tower

[Hook]

[Pre-Verse]
Such a pity I don't give love in my own city
I had to fly overseas to get love for Mickey

[Verse 3]
MauSe, see I'm gentle with the pencil
Trips to Asia, stencil work on a temple
Respected by the elders, packed my Nintendo
Never beat Zelda but Mario was simple
Fans adored me, no security on me
Ladder on the side of a forty floor story
Black Riddler who concentrated ask Hitler
Camped out, in the Jihad river and had dinner

[Hook][Intro]
What they call you?
Red. Red and I ain't no punk

[Hook]
Detroit red, my name is Detroit red
Detroit red, my name is Detroit red
Detroit red, my name is Detroit red

[Verse 1]
Grew up in the world full of thieves, son of Earl and Louise
Yearning for greed, I was working for me
My Pops died on the train tracks
Whites left em laid flat
Cause my Momma fell in love with a man with a shade black
Probably got his brain cracked, scared as a little kid
Thought about law school, but that's not what niggas did
Cracka ass teacher thought carpentry was what it is
Still smarter than them little bastards, I was a wiz
My hair was red, no kind of coloring
All natural, tried to be the black Ed Sullivan
Moved in with Ella, I was clubbing it
Shining shoes suffering, so I started hustling
Train job, wasn't cutting it
I couldn't fuck with it
Serving white people wasn't me I had enough of it
Fell in love with Harlem, cool cats not squares
Old country boys in green suits and conked hair
I got drunk, smoked weed, ran numbers
Give me some skin daddio, I was a bad brother
Kalamazoo had my mother in the padded gutter
She went crazy when that man dumped her
Black hustler, turned down the army being in the packed bunker
Dreams of a Cadillac bumper, I was a gat sucker
Used to run packaged errands
Thinking back, I blame it all on my lack of parents
Midwest boy in Harlem with a whack appearance
Gambling pennies and tips into racketeering
Hanging out uptown, Sammy master pimpin'
Red fox cleaning kitchens he was stacking dishes
Man listen, I got fired from smalls
I had to prove a point
Selling reefers using joints, everybody knew Detroit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man, I was on the cops hit list, never sent list
Was senseless, moved to 110th I still sell sticks
Drop offs because I had the pigs searching my [?]
This was way before Bill Russell was on the Celtics
Reefer money moved slow, started doing stick ups
Cocaine I had to sniff [?] to cure the hiccups
Had to pick the four fifth up without a mix up
Sammy tried to kill me because I smacked his bitch up
Kept gambling strongly
[?] numbering, getting paid from Archie
The west Indian man with good memory
He'll kill you in a heartbeat
Left Harlem because he tried to spark me, wrongly
Got back to Boston, and me and shorty was rocking
Sophia and the sister was down and we started plotting
Brought another guy named Rudy into the projects
Had to set him straight so we knew that was a problem
Wasn't afraid to die, started willin'
Emptied out my gun with the bullets I had inside it
Silence, it covered the room, I had it quiet
Put a slug back in the gun like a deposit
Let the cylinder spin then put it to my noggin
Popped it, nothing came out I started smiling
Did it again, they was astonished
But little did they know I had the bullet in my pocket
Then we started robbing, handbags and jewelry boxes
Going into the houses, sneakier than the mouse gets
Money out of wallets, clothes out of closets
Even when they snored lifted up arms and took watches
Did it for a while, until shit got obnoxious
Door started knocking, we got caught by the copers
Judge gave me 10, but not because of my chargers
But cuz Sophia and the sister looked like his daughters
2 year crime turned into a dime cuz of racism
I hate prison cuz I see it as a slave system
It's all good, should be painless, shameless
As long as Boston and Harlem know what my name is

[Hook]

[Outro from Spike Lee's 'Malcolm X' & The Documentary 'Park Ave']As I slip my kicks on one foot at a time
Then I throw these denim on that I just put to the side
Shades and shirt match now, feel good cause I'm fly
Stand up, approach the mirror then look in my eyes
The clothes ain't making me a better man
I woke up today praying for a better plan
Even though I'm fly, I'm trying to make it out of Neverland
Cause if I never grow up then who gon' lend a hand?
Just a hook, I call it piracy
I'm losing privacy, but here's the irony
I want to be alone when I step inside my home
But then I'm looking at my phone, hoping that a girl's dialing me
But it never rings, no text either
I'm staring at my BlackBerry's BBM feature
And I know she read it, I see the "R"
If you ain't gonna respond, then why you read it for?
Art galleries and rap battles
Super Street Fighter IV, bad damsels
$300 kicks, plaid flannels
This is my life, welcome to my Black Apple
I seen competition pass me
But ask me if I think any will outlast me
And lastly, I reply gladly
The flyest Benz couldn't outclass me; diamond dust
Diamond dust
Diamond dust
Diamond dust
Diamond dust
Abandoned, but never stranded
I'll see you when I get here, I just landed
Lost my laptop and can't figure how that happened
I hope my carelessness made somebody else happy
My brother Dutch told me since day 1
Him and I would be like Jay-Z and Dame, son
At the Grammy podium, water in my eyes, I'm trying to hold it in
I can't wait until that day comes
I thought about where I came from
I ain't have an opportunity until I made one
So when I say "I'm Better Than You"
I only say it to the person I literally changed from
Anyway, I got to say it everyday
Soundtrack to my life, got to play it everyday
Why rap about money, spending paper everyday
When there's people that's poor out in Haiti everyday?
It's crazy in a way, but that don't stop me
From shopping and copping things that I do not need
Damn, I make it up to my fans
Who really don't think I say as much as I can
Well, I'm not laying up in the sand
I spread diamonds to the people, break them up in my hands
Dust, diamond dust
Diamond dust
Diamond dust
Diamond dust
Diamond dust
Diamond dust
Diamond dust
Diamond dust[Intro]

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
And I never came down from the last time
But that don't mean nothing, niggas still climbing
Bitches popping bottles and they sipping pink diamonds
I took a break from the game and I seen these niggas clowning
The blogs wouldn't be the same if you took Spitta out it
Props to the ones who instrumentally getting me popping
Balling without first learning the fundamentals, forget about it
Tryna 360 up the middle, you ain't even learn to dribble
Twiddling my thumbs smoking lime
Watching hamster ass rappers running wheels going nowhere with their rhymes
Stuck, Glenn Robinson big dog bus, socks up, top down, killing squares, riding around
Coolest nigga in yo city, even when I'm not in town
Smoking like I signed for 50 million and I'm underground
Yeah, uh
Smoking like I signed for 50 million still underground

[Verse 2: J-Lie]
And who we are, flow away above all, see
If I didn't rap I still look like a star, just admit, you know
You can spot me from afar, no big diamond chain that was so old for
Just a mention going up, it's nothing that I fire
Put the ladies sleeping over, slumber parties every night
Get your flights from … sending me all over
Bring me to the club, cause all the bitches like
What other rapper you know can call from Dakota, anger ...and call from a favor
And Brooklyn and Queens cause they got I'm a king
Avoiding tattoos, ...take the music …
My kicks so is fresh no scuffs from the ground, this nigger's too fly, can't get scuffs from the clouds
This ain't even my city but shit might as well, that's why me and spitta sold out ATL

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Jet setter, I've been iller, causing vendettas with all of you Ben Stillers
These little fuckers hate my endeavors, time for men sweaters under chinchillas
Trend setter, kick killer my feet wear caskets
Fresh to death and rare glasses, the bomb bottles, rose petals and Ford models
Who all follow my Twitter and still sword swallow
DM me, got him in the frenzy, it's all about the benjies
I'm feeling like the kembe, block haters stop player I'm so clean
My pockets love the earth baby they go green
Sitting back in that cold thing, wanna rock the mic but she don't sing
Messing with the flow king, kiss the gold ring, pucker up buttercup, or knuckle up to these punch lines that uppercut

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Chillin in my teepee, no indian but he be
The realest shit I must admit I'm baskin in my feces
My style is harder, yours is watered down they call it fiji
The bible or my CD, both of them were said to be the
Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill
House party with killers, pray for Italy villas
Where accents think it's Buffy and chandeliers hang from ceilings
I'm dreaming, I'm scheming to be major
Compose art like a Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus, today is
The day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain
The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
Paper bout the forest tree, acres of that THC
I don't smoke but homies do, find the cloud and have a seat
And I wonder how ... live to see 80
I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Intro]
Are you the first original Mickey Mouse? (Yea)

[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
Narcoleptic for S's with railroads through it (Hey!)
Dreams of money can get you a jail pose viewing (The Sheriff!)
Beepers and cell phone users are coke rulers
So in summer when snows moving, the roads ruined
(We'll be right over!)
Get a plow, get a blaow, you get a trial
For a rich lawyer to get it reconciled (A customer!)
These dreams turn to nightmares, you'll see Freddy smile
Your life can end in one ring like a wedding vow (The telephone!)
Phone call 'bout a bread pile, will get you drowned
Indecent proposal can leave your whole bed defiled
You want Moore like Demi, so for the chedder now (I'll say we do!)
Ain't nothing on sale, but you selling out
Look where you headed
Searching for a comforter but not where your bed is
For that green sheet you count sheep like a shepherd
Psalm 23, on repeat like a record, that's scratched from the beginning
Slumber for the presidents (Ha ha)
They tried to kill Reagan twice that's evidence (Ha ha)
Women put their bodies on display and sell a bit but not celibate
They waking up hell bent feeling devilish (Good morning)
Money's the root of all evil so the message is
The relatives on your family tree can be your nemesis
Visions of canopy's counting salaries in ya crib
Isn't reality but the fantasy helps ya live (We'll get it)
Homeless people street dream but they can't handle
So they panhandle (Ok!)
Water washed away their sand castle
So they're trapped inside of a black apple
Where the worms go back and forth like hand paddles (Ha ha)
Hanging off a fire escape I see it all
Hand on a ladder, making my words be a wall (What do ya know?)
Could've studied at Seton Hall but luckily me and art
Don't snore or yawn, either or
I'm back bro (Hey!)
Singing lullabies for the cash flow (Hey!)
They call me butterfly cause I'm that dope
Stutter lines got called a cocoon, but when the stacks grow
I attract folks
They assholes who jump in their sleep, tadpoles in bathrobes
Now all they can do is nap, so
They attach dough to fabric up on a flagpole
Salute it like Castro
Beauties turn beast for it, no glass rose
And they would lie worse than pinocchio's last nose (My nose!)
And that's low
Inspiring actress
On a mattress
Slipping out of a black dress
Just to be that next
Star...
Bet on their ass and ass bet (On the bed!)
Pillow fights to cash checks
Silly right? Yes
Eyes wide shut
If that's the windows to your soul, put your blinds up (Ha ha ha)
Daydreaming bout my bucks
At least I see what I'm doing so when I rise up
Dollar signs in my eye ducts (Hahahahahaha!)
Cry tears that make sense, blind fear makes strength
My brush sways left, blind folded to the paint sketch (OK!)
My eyes rolling while I take breaths (Yezzir!)
If I doze then I may have slept on what I may have dreamt (Oh Boy!)
Hold up like I made a tent
I'm broke but I'm still paying rent
I'm living like I'm bed ridden how my day is spent
I'm hanging with SegaSonic, but everybody think it's Kemp
Fall asleep with a woman for a ladies scent
Penny for her thoughts, I need closure (Ha Ha!)
Want to be well-rested when it's over (Ha Ha!)
One hand on the holster
Because before I get broke, I'll put myself in a coma(Hook 1)
In our dying words
Will we make the right decision
In our dying words
Will we say just how we feel
In our final hour
Will we be able to speak
To the ones we miss the most
For it's only god we seek
In our dying words

(Verse 1)
Uh, I've spent a couple years searching
For something that was urgent, is this the ultimate purpose
Kicking my little raps (?) like fuck I'm the greatest
Wasn't being myself, I just reenacted my favorites
An adolescent, learning nothing lasted forever
But you can leave a legacy, fuck it I'll give it effort
These verses gave me a chance to believe in me
When all I saw was doubt around my city repeatedly
It's 2012 and all I know is my father's feeding me lies
I see it in his eyes, all he's trying to do is provide and I don't have the time
All I can do is focus and rhyme
My competition's winning, this isn't what I envisioned, dog
I need more, my lord, young and impatient
Don't wanna leave this world without reaching my destination
Excel ahead of the curb, huh
We all just want our voices being heard

(Hook 2)
In our dying words
Will we make the right decision
In our dying words
Will we say just how we feel
In our final hour
Will we be able to speak
To the ones we love the most
For it's only god we seek
In our dying words

(Verse 2)
Uh, family matters I never got it, was dumb and rebellious
These are the times where I was careless
When niggas had me gassed, I was coming off of eleven grand
(?) would come into alignment
It's funny at seventeen, on the edge of your dream
I don't hold a chip on my shoulder, but fuck a Jermaine Dupri
It's amazing I see
Falling off of major proportions to figure out what's important
Me and my mother speak every day, the love is enormous
Progression from a time where arguments over money were cutting our family ties
She's, climbing a ladder of aging, that's why I'm slaving
I hope she understands that it's more than personal wagers
I hope she gets to see me be more than what she expected
Achieving everything that this visionary projected
Mother dearest, know that I murdered your last nerve
I promise you everything in the world
In our dying words

(Hook 1)

(Verse 3)
Uh, Throwing caution to wind
Now it's more than bargaining wins, I am targeted since
I had a check on my reality, plus it's like a salary
Really started fucking with my mentality
Time is waiting for no man
Here today, you're gone tomorrow
I start to question what I have to offer
What is a man if he can't provide for his fam
Doesn't signify who I am, but it plays a part in my insecurities
Plus the stresses keep luring me
Into places I never thought I would ever be
Sitting moving cleverly, sick of all of this jealousy
Making up excuses for why these niggas ahead of me
I really need to let it be
I'm going through something, my woman's touch is so heavenly
Reminds me why I fight for this shit
I live my life for this shit
In my lowest stages, I still become a favorite
Could have been with ballas, but she picked a struggling artist
Don't mind me I'm venting
I'm concerned with all of these worries
Twenty-three yeah I'm young, but I'm still in a fucking hurry
A young man's sport, gotta make it before you thirty
They getting younger and younger, nobody's truly deserving
It's real, I'm just giving you the truth in this song
Before I leave, David Copperfield, poof and be gone
I pray I do it all, everything that I deserve
Nothing less, as I take my last breath
In our dying words

(Hook 2)

(Outro)
I've been searching, searching, searching
I recall days, sitting in sun rays
Fourth grade while, park patrons played on swings
Slides, and with chess games I cried
Dreaming of better days
Who am I?
When my aunt passed I didn't even say goodbye
Because, I was so mad
A runaway, on his own path
Searching, searching, searching
Who am I?
Walking through K-Mart
Opening food without paying for it takes heart
No job, just, searching
Astronaut thoughts, basketball sports, practice law talk, rapping's my source, and yet
Who am I?
Being on a quest to search and find can take time
Parallel lines between him and I can't cause us to collide
Nor divide, but rather, coincide
Doubts and clout will sprout throughout our brains to our lungs then our mouths
As we announce then pronounce then shout, what we're about
With dreams of having our own land
Our own families
Our own house
While searching within to bring it all out
Who am I?
Am I me?
Am I you?
No, No
I am we, and I am Q
Factz

(Skit)
QuESt's Mom: "Make sure you call me when you land out there. Remember baby, you can always come back home if you need to. I love you."[Verse One: Mickey Factz]
See, I seen so many faces
I've been to many places
So, I get so tired of dating
That, I just get tired of waiting
I met these species of woman
It was nothing to keep me from looking
So I wondered if she was from Brooklyn
Cause she was out of this world
I need some info about this girl
Looking fabulous, pushing a Saturn
I hope she take me to her planet
If she touch me then it'll get ugly
If I'm lucky, she will abduct me
On a spaceship and tell me she want me
I know I got her
Now that's what I call a close encounter
Uhh

[Hook]
They say I'm extraterrestrial
Which means I'm out of this world
Your glow is oh so sexual
So you should phone home to me girl

[Verse Two: Harlem's Cash]
They say I got E.T.'s bling
? spaceship, red or blue pills, now we in the Matrix
Foreign top models, yeah I stay with
An illegal alien chick stuck in immigration
See she from Belize
But just invaded South Beach
Asked to be brought to her leader
They directed her to me
The one who bubble from the bottom like Nikes
Now I'm moon walking niggas in my Y3s
Not in vain/vein though, no IV
Twin baby boys, Siamese Tyrese
So if it ain't about scratch, then no flees
I'm a ? like racist, nigga please
(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
I'm outta this world Apollo 13
She Mindy I'm Mork around these Earthlings
Champion
? to Earth rings
You a Fo kid, he heard he had wings
Cash, Gordon, Mickey, me

[Hook](x2):
They say I'm extraterrestrial
Which means I'm out of this world
Your glow is oh so sexual
So you should phone home to me girl

[Verse Three: XV]
Working at the Daily Planet, I manage to meet her
Took off my glasses so I could really see her
She said, "I love the Squarian demeanor
So Square in the Circle, put a circle around my finger."
Must of had me confused, my name's Clark Kent
And I landed in Kansas from a star ship
Open up the closet in my apartment
"If you ain't Superman then what do you call this?"
Damn
Now she know my secret
"Now tell me what I gotta do to make you keep it."
"Fly me around the world and buy me Victoria Secret
And I'll be so tight that I could never ever leak it."
"True dat." Should of knew that from jump street
Under the covers and then she comes sleep
Mix Master Ice on the process
The new UTFO, you the newest object
Peace

[Hook](x2)
They say I'm extraterrestrial
Which means I'm out of this world
Your glow is oh so sexual
So you should phone home to me girl[Intro: The Black Keys]
The look on the cake, it ain’t always the taste
My ex girl, she had such a beautiful face
I wanted love but not for myself
But for the girl so she could love herself

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Listen, my ex-chick’s raw, I had to put it to rest
I fuck crazy bitches though ’cause psycho pussy the best
Now shawty sending me texts, spaz and stress
Asking who I'm with and where I am and if I been smashing
I told her yes laughing, I don’t owe you
Baby, you will regret telling me that I don’t know you
The shit is over, you’re lying to get me over every week
It’s an emergency, I finna lose composure
How many times I done told you to just let go of it?
If home is where the heart is, you heartless so now you homeless
Lonely bitch, why you blowing up my phone again?
I killed your self esteem, I give your ego my condolences
Rolling with folks who only know you as a failure
When I met you, you showed your best parts, you like a trailer
And now I’m feeling like your ass done got the best of me
Making sure that your ass is nothing like my next to be

[Hook]
My next girl will be nothing like my ex girl
I made mistakes back then, I’ll never do it again
Oh my next girl, she'll be nothing like my ex girl
It was a painful death, I got a second chance

[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]
Here is a reminder dear, you was a recliner chair
Always trying to fall back from me, now you’re trying to appear
‘Cause you see vagina hairs all around my designer wear
You like "Mickey, please call back honey", funny
Nope, I dropped the dark phoenix, we wasn’t at all speaking
Blind as your ex-man, Cyclops, it was all seeing
You was my Jean Grey until you went psycho on me
Ghost writer ‘cause she was stereotyping for me
You think you know somebody till you see they true colors
Girls being Frankie Lymon, singing why do fools love us?
So for two Summers, she was a true blooder
Breaking my heart but I’m gonna get you sucker
Vampire slayer, can’t fly a prayer for this damn lying trader
Who didn’t stand by and make it work
I hate to jerk all my damn life, you damn right
Even though I fucked her and told her I loved her last night

[Hook][Verse 1: Curren$y]
Burn slow like joints of purple
Hot Spitta, jet nigga ya'll know
Roll 84 down bumpy roads
Take Kanye advice: drive slow
Niggas think they tough they not macho
They soft, soggy nachos
That's mine doggie not yo's
Style, gear, ya got it from here
No worries, raps I got plenty to share
I'm on top I did my ground work last year
You could pass go you could pass the ball
But don't pass me the reggie that you're growing in your backyard
Shit might hurt me fuck my raps off
Aurora Borealis blast make me blast off
I came I kicked that shit
Shoulda took my Chris Webber Air Max off

[Hook]
Come on and take a bite
Of this food for thought
Let it ease your mind
Let it take control

[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]
I was born in Roswell
Performed and dropped hell
It's the lyrical Norman Rockwell
And I have to be seen
Call me the king looking for my Alexander McQueen
Mean, I'm giving soul food to protools
That go through your brain waves, you like it don't you?
Don't move, and ya'll won't late
It's John Coultrane with this raw propane
I line 'em up like we on Soul Train
Cause rappers stink like raw Lo Mein
And I paint pictures like Claude Monet
So when you listen to me it's like you snort cocaine
I scored ??-
She heard of me
It's Mick Jordan chillin with Steve Curren$y
Emergency, come talk to a beast
Whose givin' you food for thought
It's all you can eat
PEACE

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Amanda Diva]
Hot like pepper pot
Sweet like sour sop
West side born
But the spice isle in my heart
Boss like the man Barack
People listen when I talk
Start of the movement
I'm the spark that got the game on lock
Took my spot/ I foxed the lot
Didn't see me coming
Bgirl I can pop and lock
But Got them boys running man
Like water they want it and I got it drippin
A lady they buggin if they think they'll be sippin
On this nectar
Next to greatness empress of the rhythm
Rising to the top/ like cream of the crop
I redeem all the little women like Alcott
Give em someone to believe in not a black girl lost
And the table's been set we preparing a feast
Something for the mind spirit and the body
Cookin up the future with these rhymes and beats
So go and get out the kitchen if you can stand the heat[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
My good friend, my secret crush
The girl that I want but don't see enough
Burberry scent, just the sweetest Touch
And when I see her strut, gives me a rush!
I can be the guy that can tell her she's the hottest
She's a pilot coming out her closet
I can be her confidant, show her that I'm honest
Serving to the queen bow down to the highness
Beauty fades but she's timeless
Apple in my iris, I see paradise
I'm tryna find the right words miss vanwrite
I wanna buy a vowel, hoping my cash is right

[Hook: Redd Stylez & Lundon (Mickey Factz)]
I got what you want but you don't see it yet
I want you in my arms but you just put me, in the friend zone
(You got me stuck, you got me stuck, can't get out)
In the friend zone
(You got me stuck, you got me stuck, can't get out)

[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]
If you're sick I'm your doctor
I talk to you better than a teleprompter
Let's take a ride high in a helicopter
And see the city from the eyes of a bird when it flies
I can be your second shot of ketel vodka... Right?
I got your feeling nice, I want you in my life
Tell you your jeans' fitting right when you put em' on
I'm the one that you're looking for
I can be, everything that you need
The air that you breathe
The mirror that you see, when you're staring back at me
I'm your shoulder, lean on me closer
It's good that I tell ya but it's better if I showed ya

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Let me show you what I mean, I'm a tell you what I'm about
I, prove it everyday so that you'll never have a doubt
I'm the blood in your heart from your roof to your house
You don't EVER gotta ponder; hear the words from my mouth
I, can, be, what the others weren't
I ain't judging em baby girl but what's the verdict?
Captain to your ship, set sail, rest well
Take a little breather, I'm waiting for you to exhale
That's the breeze of a new life
Watch it flick your hair, let's take a picture there
Darling, they say your photo's a thousand words
Well the conversation crown is heard

[Hook]

[Bridge: Redd Stylez]
Baby if you, just... Try me
I'll show you how good... I'll be, yeah...[Intro: Mackie]
Hey, what it is, it's the boy Mackie. You're listening to Larry Love and DJ Ominya on W-LLL. Mickey Factz, what up

[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
Lord, please show me the way
Why do girls I like keep floating away
And the ones that don't mean, slowly decay
Treat em like a frisbee and throw them away

[Hook]
Am I right or wrong
Can I right this wrong
Well you're a slave to indecision
Keep holding on
Holding on

[Verse 2]
I guess this is the lust part
The love talk get you left with a crushed heart
This is a double edge sword and they both sharp
I keep saying what I want when I shouldn't
And I still end up tug a war pullin'
Furthermore, I'm in another world looking for another girl
When I need a love and grown women, but they throw me away

[Hook]
It seems mistakes never go away
Making choices in the moment
So will you stay
Or leave your thoughts with me
I don't wanna waste your time, oh my
What do you think about that


[Verse 3]
Get one play with it, all day with it
Then you do away with it, won't stay with it
I been there, laid with it in the shade with it
Then I felt shame with it, so lame with it
What goes around comes back
But I don't want that
It's just like a frisbee
You throw it to your boy and you hoping that he catch it
And  do the same thing
But I let it fall flat
As a man am I supposed to wait
Am I supposed to chase
When I just wanna stroke and be close to mate
Without a show for date
These are the problems these hoes create
But I'm a ho, and when I find somebody I can hold
Introduce her to my moms on the low
She do to the same thing I be doin' yo
Well I don't know, I just figured as a man it's expected
Meet a girl take her home let her get naked
Beat it up never call takes no effort
Walk of shame, I don't make no breakfast
But then when I put work in I'm neglected
True story, you hurt when I'm rejected
Reckless, this is why I flirt every second
Check it, my pops say I gotta keep dating
My moms say that I gotta keep waiting
My heart say why I gotta keep breaking
For you to understand I'm not a frisbee to play with
Don't throw me away

[Hook]
It seems mistakes never go away
Making choices in the moment
So will you stay
Or leave your thoughts with me
I don't wanna waste your time, oh my
What do you think about that
Could be right or wrong
Am I right or wrong
Baby, what you make of it
So inconsiderate, I guess we have fallen off target
I guess we've fallen off target

[Larry Love]
She got me, frisbee, both by Mickey Factz. And speak of the devil, he is here, finally

[Mickey Factz]
Yo, yo - it's Mickey!

[Larry Love]
Yes, yes. So, explain to us this dumb title, Frisbee. What ever happened to titles like, 'What's goin' on', or 'What's love got to do with it', or 'Between the sheets'?

[Mickey Factz]
Well, first of all shout to everybody tuned in, my achievers. My tour is approaching and I'm coming to a city near you. Um, I came up with the title thinking about all the times these guys throw away women when it's convenient. And woman too, you know? You know it goes, bruh, c'mon. Larry, you know how it go bruh

[Larry Love]
Ok, ok, I get it, but I don't know. How do you feel about that?

[Mackie]
Give the guy a break man, you know it's a new generation and love, lust and kinds of stuff man

[Larry Love]
I mean, no, no. I'm from that era where music was music and Frisbee doesn't make sense to me

[Mackie]
Well to him it makes sense you know. You don't know what his heart has been through

[Larry Love]
Well, let's talk about this project, Love.Lust.Lost 2. Why? Why do a sequel?

[Mickey Factz]
Well the fans loved the first one and I wanted to top it. I had the Badu record that I couldn't put out as well as the John Legend record that I brought up here just for you guys to play and I wanted a home for both of them. So, this project was the only way to get it out

[Larry Love]
Wow, that's interesting. Let's get into that while we got more Mickey Factz on W-lll. Keep it locked
