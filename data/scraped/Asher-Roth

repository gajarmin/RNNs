[Intro]
"Cause I ain't going out like a sucka, no way"
I'm nice right now
I-I feel good
If you have a drink
Would you please put it in the air

[Hook]
That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

[Verse 1]
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise you naked
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is, um

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Man I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
Man I love college (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
I can't tell you what I learned from school
But, I could tell you a story or two
Um yea, of course I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'til the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Interlude]
Now if everybody would please
Put their drink, as high as they can
As high as they can, and repeat after me
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Freshmen! Freshmen!
Freshmen! Freshmen!
Do something crazy! Do something crazy!
Do something crazy! Do something crazy!
Keg-stand! Keg-stand!
Keg-stand! Keg-stand!
(That party last night)
Man I love collge, I love it
(That party last night)
Goodnight everybody
I gotta head back to class for a little bit

[Hook]

[Outro during Hook]
But after that
You know what's goin' down
My house and 3 kegs
See you there, you're all invited
Bring your friends, bring your mom
Do I really have to graduate
Or can I just stay here the rest of my life?[Intro]
Mhmm, yeah, at least its just bass

[Verse 1]
Fuck everything you heard about
Your word of mouth ain’t worth a dollar
Verses vicious versatile, don’t you take it personal
Turn around, tell another person how I birthed your style
Now  I make you nervous, I’m superfluous, is this allowed
This is child abuse I’d beat my kid if he was you
Use the same switch that AP did, these nincompoops
No more cute, fuck the rules, draft him next year too
This ain't fantasy you pansy, get your Netflix queue
We on that next shit
Your best bet is to get 2 bedrooms with a pool
A nice view on lake and just move
Take the next few, digest, pack a couple bathing suits
Take your lady on vacation get away just you two
Get a clue on what to do when in the presence of a fool
Never hesitate to set them straight, don’t get it misconstrued
It's a lesson how to dress when you don’t have a thing to prove
Ayahuasca and a headdress, resting in Peru

[Hook]
That cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you but that's cute
That cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you but that's cute
That cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you but that's cute
That cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you but that's cute

[Verse 2]
Slip and slide, sit inside
Had Xzibit pimp my ride
Pick her up at 8 but show up later, maybe close to 9
Won’t apologize, other things up on my mind
Like time is money honey hope you hungry even though you side piece
Ch tea, [?] ha, looking like Ashanti
High for the first time, tell her that I’m [?]
Nah mean? Sitting shotgun blowing shotties
Avi top 3 so work that body body
Don’t hurt no body my bonds diversified as my rhymes
Verses as hot as the mom of Steph Curry, cmon
The broad side of a barn goes unharmed when you're on
Your arms as strong as I’m hurried
Like when Curtis through the first pitch
Worse then a nerve twitch
Controlling the motherboard, captain of the Mothership
The whirling dervish of this word shit
At my worst I’m perfect , at your girl’s nursing

[Hook][Verse 1: Asher Roth]
First of all, my dog, back off
Ash Roth top five right now, better know that
But rap without me is like braidless Moesha, Kobe with no Shaq
But when I'm on the mic all I get is blank stares
No cares, it's a slow clap
But just because you rapping like "Da-da-da-da-da-da"
Doesn't mean you really rap
I can't grasp how these broke asses claiming to be rich
But really get no cash
I been to your whack show, what you call that, bro?
25 people at home with a cat?
You go posting like "Yo it was packed, it was dope
It was girls from the front to the back"
All these cum rags keep comparing white rappers with Asher
But everybody knows I'm the dad
For the craft, or a laugh, not a tad outlasted
I don't really care what you say
10 years from now I'ma still love college
While I'm fucking white girls out in Arizona State
I'm sick of hearing all the hoes you be having
How much dro you be smoking, homie no you don't
You showed up with bros
Here's a RAW paper, do you even know how to roll?
Let it go like my hair length
I'm gonna quit rap start it better I'm gonna play bass guitar
Me, Chevy, Chip, and Dumbfounded
What should we call it?
Hmm, How about RAW?

[Verse 2: King Chip]
I been wakin' up everyday, doing the fuck I want
All I need is for shit to be cool, and pass that fuckin' blunt
Nigga never gave no fuck about police, I piss all on their grave
Justice for Mike Brown, you son of a bitches gon' be held to pay
I got the severed hands of 100 cops up out my chariot
What if every hood united? That would be some scary shit
Way more niggas than cops
You too sure nigga how to do anything
3D print my SK, walk in TSA, couldn’t say anything
I walked in like a real one, ready to kill somethin'
Its impossible to hear my voice, and not feel nothin'
Suck a black dick, Bill O'Reilly fuck you
I'm King Chip I say exactly what I want to
Nigga never gave no fuck ‘bout politics, I got the power, bitch
4 bedroom house, in my living room I got a lot of chicks
Smokin’ fool… Nigga, we smokin' fools
How does it feel to be wearing a chain that's way more dope than you?

[Verse 3: $kinny]
I be that same nigga with a whole lot of jewels, whole lot of hoes, whole lot of O’s, blow whole lot of O’s, whole lot of guns blow whole lot of holes, home full of holes, whole full of fuck yous, whole lot of crews that’ll ride for me, die for me, pry for me, rob for me, probably get caught by the cops for me, cop drops for niggas that’ll lie for me. And if you wanna pop off let it pop off. In a benz with the top off with some drop offs. In the tint it’ll be hotboxed you’ll be hot sauce with some twins in the lunchbox full of pot roast. ????
I be up in cairo with the pharaohs
I be up in cabo with dineros
On the beach with a barrel full of arrows
Y'all can't bang with us hang with us
Bunch of fuckin' traderers, strangerers
Never see me paperless, I’m angel dust
Dope boy straight dangerous, irregulars
I’m the same nigga you love to hate
Must be the bands i make
Must be the pounds i make
Must be the way i bang LA
Must be the whip i brought around the town today
Must be the bitch i flew in outta town today
Must be the shit i blew up in the Mandalay better do what the camel say
Few goons from France saint tropez. Haters go scramblé

[Verse 4: Chevy Woods]
Young dope sellin' nigga
4800 got the coke sellin' nigga
Now all these wannabe friends see us real now they wanna try and coattail a nigga, but
Ha.. look I ain't for it, dodge on them niggas nah this ain't ford
211 when they run it back to me now that’s what I call a raw report
That Honda accord, three chickens in a wheel well
Lil nigga when it come to that kitchen you know I know that shit real well
Yea, say hi to me, the nigga who they sayin' wouldn't be shit
Oh, look and I'm Randy Savage ?? Yo bitch want the beef stick
That’s cold, see this watch here cost a new home
Look baby I’m ballin' watch these shooters get you outta that zone
You talkin' like you gettin' to the money, you ain't gettin' to the money pussy leave me alone
Ha…. Ha…
And I never keep shit at my home
Niggas always talkin' that killa shit but they don’t know no motherfuckin' killas
They say I always rap about drug sellin' cuz I was out on that corner with the dealers
You see I’m doin' this so I’m ain't gotta go back to that book bag full of that work
And a pussy ass nigga tried to set me up same pussy ass nigga that got merked
If you bang that shit, nigga claim that shit, see me I don’t fuck with that side, try me better look out your window I have them niggas waitin' in that car parked outside
I ain't ever get no money with you broke ass niggas, never told y'all who’s the connect
Ima always be 4800 nigga real shit homies on the set
Shoes off, champagne, steak well done not the crib this is all on a jet
They don’t wanna give it to me imma take my shit either way imma get my respect
Free all my niggas that’s locked in the cage when they touch down they gon' see
And tell them pussy ass niggas don’t copy my shit and you know that’s TGOD fuck nigga
Oooohhhh!![Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
9 times out of 10 you a 10
If your schedule open I'll pencil you in
Ight, wiggle it in, get with your friend
Laugh now, cry later, hope you ticklish then
Let's figure it out, I figured it out
Shawty so thick she put a dent in my couch
And dent in my wallet, I'm diggin' her probably
I told her let's kick it, karate
Got a black belt on, Versace
Wanna get my eat on, Hibachi
2 Chainz on with a pinky ring
If I'm your boyfriend, you can have anything
(Anything?) anything, (anything?) everything
(Everything) I can upgrade you to better things (true)
(Hello) you hear that wedding ring?
And if you answer, then we settling

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl
You'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman
Anything you want
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go
Never let you go

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Youngin' gettin' money, all these honeys say they love me
Buddha belly, how I'm lucky, girls be rubbin' on my tummy
I can be your man, get you everything you need
Have you ever had a Rollie, Stewart Weitzman on your feet?
And you can be my queen, couple thousand on the jeans
Cause I'm down to do some spendin' on the women of my dreams
Marvin told us we should get it on, right here in the restaurant
Ain't no point in waitin' baby, I can get you what you want
Leprechaun gold, got leprechaun gold
And I came out hot like I was steppin' on coals
But I never got cold, keepin' extra long dough
For a rainy day, need a vacation, name a place, we can go
Where I'm tryna take you, we gon' need a boat
Independent raps, yeah my life is like the Beatles though
Invest a big check to make sure you get fresh
Cause if I was your boyfriend, I'd treat you like a princess

[Hook: Justin Bieber]

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
And we can be like Selena and Biebs
Wild and free, a couple disobedient teens
Sneaking out to meet around like 2 o'clock in the eve
Paparazzi ain't a problem, we just hide on the beach
Girl you hotter than me, let's go fly overseas
Or just slide up in the closet, never findin' the key
Cause 7 minutes in heaven ain't enough when we're together
Kisses to the forehead, when I slide my hands to second
Wait a second, smilies in a text
I kinda be interested, I'm lyin' girl I'm obsessed
Stylish sun dresses, legs in jean shorts
Please pick me, love's a team sport
I'll be your boyfriend, jokes and pillow talk
Lay around in our undies, chill, play Tony Hawk
Dance slow in the dark, come roll with Roth
Cause when that falsetto hits, yall gonna know who to call
So JB

[Hook: Justin Bieber]

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
So give me a chance, cause you're all I need girl
Spend a week with your boy, I'll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your man, I'd never leave you girl
I just want to love you, and treat you right

[Hook: Justin Bieber][Verse 1]
Sitting on a truffet, puffing on the best cut buds
Trying to get butt from Miss Muffet
Me and Teddy Ruxpin sturring up a ruckus
Egging all the houses, smashing all the pumpkins
Suck a Dick Butkus, chumps can't funk with the punk kids
Ash Roth be the king of the blumpkins
Any Tim Duncan, spur of the moment
Let the whole world know I run shit, jump ship quick
Tell a friend that I'm dumb sick
Spit fungus that'll grow from a dung trip
Twist to a front flip, son that was some trick
Watch all the dumb chicks hump when I bump this

[Verse 2]
Kinda like the blonde Bob Saget, Ash can get nasty
Pass me a blunt and some Captain
Chilling with an Ashley, heading to the mall
Sitting in the backseat, getting jerked off
Ten feet tall with the balls of a matador
Door-matted whore with your words, heard that before
Poor metaphor, pedicure, get your feet fixed
Walk in my shoes for a few, you gonna need it
Yeah, get your Wii Fit to practice your frees with
Need a few weeks before you can compete with
Razor Ramon flow, oh so sharp
You can take Kapowski, I'mma take Lark on my go-kart

[Verse 3]
Mario Kart skills are outrageous
Play me anyday and I'll be the best racist
Wait, no, erase it, meant to say racer
Traded in my cell phone for a new pager
Take off your Bluetooth now dot com
I'm at the grocery store with hot moms
About thirty five with at least two kids
We can make-out while my friend baby sits
All up in your fridge eating left-over shit
Tuna sandwich, Butterscotch Krimpets
Cheetos be my choice of chips
I enjoy for a bit, take a sip from my Ssips and split

Roll that J up, is it rolled?
Yeah, roll it up, uhh

[Verse 4]
Hair like a troll doll, basketball shorts on
Yeah, I'm a dork but I'm still holding court
Ball up, baller, y'all take too long to get dolled up
Give a fuck if I look like I just woke up
Who am I trying to impress? Honey in the sun dress
With the breasts luscious just sent me a text
O-M-G, you're the B-E-est
If you're trying to have sex, I'm the best at it[Produced by Blended Babies]

[Intro]
Someone's always caught up in the...
Someone's always caught up in the fast life
Someone's always caught up in the fast life

[Hook: Asher Roth]
Fast life, someone's always caught up in the fast life
Fast life, someone's always caught up in the fast life
Fast life, someone's always caught up in the fast life
Fast life, someone's always caught up in the fast life

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Far too delicate, it's hard when a father is yelling and
Takes it out on her or the dog for the hell of it
Only thirteen when she started developing
By fifteen, attractin' older gentlemen
She let them in, mom wasn't looking, she might have been
Turned a blind eye found it better than fighting with
Her little girl caught in a sinister world
No sibling or a sister that could show her the pearls
So she turns to the night sky
Drinking to get by, pills above the sink that be helping her get high
All the while she's forgetting to ask why
Feeling like the only way of living is let die
Why goodbye is the hardest of speech
Go along for the ride at a startling speed
Through the rise and the fall and the valleys and peaks
While the heart tries to find what it needs
Don't get caught up in the

[Hook: Asher Roth]

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Ain't it hard, to get up out of your momma's basement
If I could buy my way to Heaven or a diamond bracelet
Can't help, but wonder if my time is wasted
If I'm waiting on a train instead of trying to race it
Too fast, my lady told me "Slow down baby
By the way I work for seven", she said she know I'm crazy, ayyy
How you gotta walk before you run
Gotta look before you leap but lose faith before you preach
And just think before you reaching for the handle of your gun
And you running from  what you done to become what you never wanted to
Hunted you want to run, running from the sound of the sirens
Chicago no violence, Nobody could tell me
Come find me, I need an island, to hold my family
Take up ten rows of the Grammy seats
Granted we've known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine
Look around

[Hook: Asher Roth (2X)][Verse 1: Chuck Inglish]
And it's falling off the side like back fat
Giving girls rides to the crib not a rat trap
Cheese, peanut butter freeze raps
I want all these snapped in his back in the day
Like a tall tee tag
I need that whip clean G
What's the weather gon be
Drop top, no drips on this upholstery
Supposed to be headed downtown
Carwash like blaow
And my girl drive the chevy while I break this tree down
Roll the window back up
Good, turn it back up
Ugh, UGK
Diamonds & Wood
Hold up, yea roll up
That's tight, that's right
You do this right, you might have the time of your life

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Coming from the Westside but my fitted say Sox
Where you get banged on if you in it or not
Looking like Cain cause I watch Menace a lot
And I'm tryna fuck your friend so is she with it or not
Shout out to ATL cause I'm in Lennox a lot
And I dont like looking, I go in there to cop
Houston High Rollers, I go in it a lot
Spending money with the strippers you go in there to watch
Blowin on L's, smelling like Chanel
You say you the man but dawg these bitches can't tell
But ladies love Dom cause I'm gettin that mail
To make it out my hood is like to make it out of jail
Put the tens up and start breaking out the twelves
Bet I have your girlfriend shaking out her heels
We shaking all deals
And chasing all meals
I'm popping all over how you haters all feel

[Big Sean]
Smoke good, fuck better
Count money, what's better
These lil niggas can't hang
Big shit popping bitch and big my first name
I'm a Westsider, Detroit player
Fuck around and I might bring back gators
Everyday I leave the crib with no money
And come back later with that muthafucking paper
Finally famous over erything thats just how I feel bitch
They trying to stop my shine
They yellin hit the kill switch
Wrong nigga to deal with
Less you doing a deal with
Grind hard, thats how I was built bitch
Whoa there, whoa there
I'm who everybody know here
I come through in the club and get more money than promoters
Oh thats your girl
I see her at my show there
I be off in the hood I bet you dont ever go there
Ayy so slow there boy
Don't go there boy
It's people you dont know there boy
Young nigga that's addicted to the Polaroids
And I gave these niggas more lines than corduroy
And my bitches be gorgeous boy
Showtime I hope you record em boy
I'm out here

[Boldy James]
Let's reel half of a brick and bring it back to the kitchen
See the crack its fizzing
Then bring it back when its finished
Jimbo put that on a dish
And Chizzel will bag it and sell it
Then boldly factor the digits
To know the cash that I'm flipping
Six gonna get stashed in the ceiling
6-O's in traffic I'm pitching this o
That one get split and broke to halves
And this one his o
And that one is his
And this o I'm bagging and this one
This o the last
The nigga Ro is a crackilitician
Rolling the ave cause I'm getting dough in that slab
Cause I'm getting over, they mad
I just grill 'em bro, with my mag on my briches
Know I'll blast if you tempt him
Bro you will crash in your whip with holes in your back cause you hit
Going as fast as your engine go
When you smash in the strip smoking a bag with your bitch
Choking, gasping for breath holding
Grabbing your chest from boldly magging that tech
Unload it faster than Vick's concreture school craft to the the sick
Bomb as a brick

[Asher Roth]
I be frustrated with the way that shit's been aging
And I'm about to take a break and get away on a vacation
Like, maybe Malaysia to escape the meditation
I'll just eat, pray and wait for my day of revelation or I'll
Take peyote, roam the rivers of Nairobi
Change my name to Navajo and live alone and only grow weed
Cause this, Naomi flowing show gets pretty lonely
Don't nobody ever know you
Everybody call you homie
Mony Mony they'll be sure to treat you phony
As soon as you hit your low they won't be picking up the phone
See, I moved to (Comie ?) show these fools that I am home
And when Im on the microphone all you wanna-be's can blow me
So, take this boner to the dome you little bo-peeps
That may be inapropy but Im certainly no sheep
See, I only lead in this game of entertainment
Roth and Big Sean
We on Finally Famous

[Chip Tha Ripper]
Yea, now roll ten of em up
Fuck the rules we Auntie Anne's pretzel bendin em up
Don't give a fuck/Word to your daddy leather sandals
Either pay the light bill or light up them candles
Regular White Owl Cigarillo, no Flavors
Break that bitch down and peel of the first layer
Smooth, like a baby's ass
Mercedes pass
The ladies ask can they be next cause I'm kicking their favorite raps
Life is playing 2k and kicking raps all day by the lake
Smoking truth till I collapse in broad day
I'm surfing, radical
Gnarly, far out
My stoner chicks gather round soon as I break the jar out
Ay baby girl pass the blizz-ard
Your woman chose me so I had to jizz her
Don't be sleeping or taking no cat naps
We leaders of the new school with these fat raps[Chris Brown]
Shattered glasses and cigarettes
There's a lot built up inside of me
I have so many regrets, this isn't how things used to be
You're never satisfied
Guess what? I'll stop fuckin trying
You suck
In case you didn't know, you're horrible
But it's always true, I'm always wrong anything I do
And I always go to war with you and I lose
I'm a silly dude cause I keep coming back to you
This is feeling like Deja Vu
My head's spinning around and you got me saying

[Hook - Chris Brown]
You're way too complicated
I can no longer take it
We're no good, let's just face it
Cause you're way too complicated

[Chris Brown]
You're such a snobby girl, used to think you were a queen
Damn, sure did rain on my parade
Same old silly games you play, this is such a waste of time
Starting to think that you're insane - cukoo cukoo!
But it's always true, I'm always wrong anything I do
I'm a silly dude cause I keep coming back to you
This is feeling like Deja Vu
My head's spinning around and you got me saying

[Hook]

[Asher Roth]
I'm not sure, what else can I do?
I've had enough of your truths
Yeah you're way too Soduku, true
Ain't in no mood for proofs and square roots
Go ahead, run and find yourself another man
Figure you wild, I'm sick of your mouth
Bout to slit at them wrists and sleep on the couch
Yeah, stick to my decision
Chick I'm kicking you out
No mathematician, take the digits and bounce
You got me screaming out[Hook: Asher Roth]
Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up
Acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

Go go [x4]

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Here I go
Yeah yo, what's the scenario?
Can't understand, what you staring for?
Like you've never seen a white boy dance before
But damn she fine
That's one chick I can stand behind
Play in my field like a dandelion
Put it all on 'til you can't decide
What's it gon' be?
You, me, her, her, her, you, me
Girl, go beserk, gotta beat 'em with a tree
Go ahead, fall back, [?] boy gon' breathe
Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up
Floating, sipping, having fun, cause I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up, acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

[Hook: Asher Roth]

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
So I walked in the club with a dope hairdo
Checking my fresh, everything brand new
Sexy old dude, saying "who's you?"
You do me, and I'mma do you
What what, what you talkin about Willis?
Man fall back, I'm just chillin'
Hate when they check for a bad-bad bitch
Gotta have respect for my bad habits
P-p, now pass me the tree
I'mma get wild, I'mma nail you to me
Pull out the camera and shoot me a links
Cause I'mma act up, sweetie pie, what you think?
Go insane in the membrane, [?]

Badder than a m-, MJ level
Face down, ass up, skinnys on, dirty Chucks
Showing off, I'mma swag it up
Good girl gone bad, grab my bud

[Hook: Asher Roth]

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
19 year old and I gotta act up
Cause I'm so so fly, yeah I'm so fly
And I don't know why, really know I, go so wow, till the bass goes oh my
Oh I, I gotta slow it down
Yeah I'm on the loose, and I won't stop now
Cause I go so loud, and I go so wow
So you better watch out cause I’m oh so ahh
I’m on some risky business
I like women and French kisses
Mama told do the dishes but I'm here catching fishes
Cause I'm still young and acting up
Girls on my mind, so I still mack up
They see the money, see the money, rack up, till the walls dark green, cause I'm stacking up
Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fu--
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up
Acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Yikes, I guess I'm actin' up
I'm about to go in, let me wrap it up
Young old school like Galaga
But I'mma call these shots, caliber
What it is JB, my Ray-Bans in my jacket might give you rabies
My chain heavy, give it to the ladies
Hold up, hold up, watch 'em go crazy
Chilling with Asher Roth
Girls let me touch, cause their ass is soft
Yes I'mma score with them basketballs
She gon' give it up, I don't pass at all
My crew neck match my two-step
I just had group sex on my new jet
So many pretty girl, I'm like "who's next?"
So drunk all my white friends like, "Do it!"
Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up
Smoking, drinking, having fun, cause I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up
Acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

[Hook: Asher Roth]Uh. know what I mean
We all, we all got our own thing
And heres mine..

[Verse: 1]
Now ma' things was cool
I swore id never break the rules
Straight with you cause I could relate to you
Stay with you
Special in my book
In my point of view he couldn't sex you like I could
You got with you wanted
And flaunted what you wanted
And I went a little further even when you didn't want it
Cause right in time, right what I had in mind
Plus your heads been right in mine (my mind)
So I took the time, my choice was to love you
And I didn't listen when they said never should I trust you
So why must you take me for granted
I swore you loved me too, damn ill never understand it
I'm a man with feeling to and I'm a fool for the way I still feel for you
But heres to you, I'm a better man then that
You took my heart then and now I want it back
So come on

[Hook]
Told me you and I might live together someday(someday)
Now I see it in a whole new other way
And ain't gonna lie girl you need to realize
I'm staying home tonight (so come on)
Said I wanna be alone (said I wanna be alone)
All by myself
Said I'm staying home, I don't need no one else (wanna be alone)

[Verse: 2]
I was cool, gave you one more chance
You gave the same old song, same old dance
So hell with it, I had to face that shit
You was to immature for relationships
So I moved on for the time being
Then I heard a lie, theres a guy that you were caught seeing
I flipped shits, but you flipped shits right back
You cried you knew I wouldn't do you like that
Still my heart was lonely, nobody to hold me
You was my only, damn girl you was my homie
You know me, you said you were stuck back there
So when I tried you leave you sucked me right back in
Why would I taste what I already ate?
So I took time to get my priorities straight
So listen you know me well I hate to doubt you
But girl truth is I'm better off with out you and

[Hook]

[Verse: 3]
Damn girl I thought it never would end
But this is it thats all, never again
I couldn't deal with it then and I sure can't now
So what makes you think I'mma let you hold me down, no
I told you before never to roam but this is real when I say leave me alone
I gotta be on my own, and you do too
Through and through just please let me do what I do
Maybe sometime soon we can both be friends,
But for now this is where its suppose to end
My brain is sick, my heart is torn, my arms are empty
But baby girl I just need to be alone
My heart will beat alone, and I keep my head up
But truth is now I'm a little bit fed up
I don't hate you though, you still close to me
So lets just go back to how we used to be, cool..

[Hook]
Told me you and I might live together someday(someday)
Now I see it in a whole new other way
And ain't gonna lie girl you need to realize
I'm staying home tonight (so come on)
Said I wanna be alone (said I wanna be alone)
All by myself (no no no no no)
Said I'm staying home, I don't need no one (wanna be alone)
I don't wanna be here in this chair
Waiting on you aw baby, to see things my way
Why don't you see things my way
(woahhhhhh)
Told me you and I might live together someday(someday)
Now I see it in a whole new other way
And ain't gonna lie girl you need to realize
I'm staying home tonight (so come on)
Said I wanna be alone (no no no no no)
All by myself
Said I'm staying home(said I'm staying home)
I don't need no one (wanna be alone)
I'm so gone(Bangladesh!)
No, not Bangladesh! Bangley
Yo, Brain Bang!
Yo Myspace's been blowing me up
Telling me I had to do it
And since I'm a real democracy
I figured "I might as well"
You know what I mean
It goes like this

A million here, a million there
Yeah, you got a mil but for real dog nobody cares
If you don't share, don't donate to charity
Children who can barely eat, no shoes on their feet
We don't see, we don't read, we don't really need to
Self-centered humans be the root of all evil
In this industry, we just feed our egos
Got a 7 series and a brand new pea coat
With that "oh, oh look at me yo
"Heard Ash on milli he ain't talking 'bout me though"
Yes I am, yo, you call yourself a man
But it ain't about the money, it's about what you stand for
This is for my people who can't afford pampers
Wake up in the morning got my clothes out the hamper

Money ain't the answer, still ain't cured cancer
I ain't got a mil but I'm a pretty good dancer
My advance lasts me about a week
After taxes and my bills and a big sack of weed
I am back to where I began
Chilling watching CNN
Thinking damn, we are damned, not again
How is George Bush not in jail for treason
But Clinton gets impeached for busting semen? uh

A million dead, a million scarred
A million bars till' you realize you took it too far
With your cars and you guns, ha, hardy-har-har
Til' I'm dead and I'm gone I'mma party too hard
Life's short, have a ball, matter fact, have two
Yo the government don't care, here's a big "Fuck you!"
Cause gas is 4 bucks, but they still drive trucks
Dumb and dumber in your hummer, yo I bet that sucks
Spend a milli at the pump
In the city you don't need that
Buy a fucking bike, maybe you wouldn't be fat

Yo homie where the weed at?
Yeah I need to relax, motherfucker I'm chill

(Just relax b, are you done yet?)
Nah
It's just these stupid motherfuckers never get it
It's pathetic
Yo they get to the pros and don't do shit
Like they Reddick
When I get that check
I'm gonna take it right to the medic
Cause these sick kids need it more than I need a necklace
Y'all need to respect this
I'm Asher Paul Roth, yo, I'm always on the guest list
Yeah I got a checklist
Stay getting checked, bitch
Keep your mouth closed don't let yourself get checked bitch
Rap's Wayne Gretzky, yes, I'm the best and
Only 22, almost Alex Ovechkin
I suggest y'all invest in some self-esteem
Intervene with Charlton Heston's
Plan to arm every man with a handgun
Who kills people, the gun or the man? um
I'm the best sword fighter in the land, come test me
I'll be drinking wine while practicing my fencing
And driving a jet-ski, straight multitasking
"How are you so good?"
I don't know, don't ask me

A million here, a million there
Yeah, you got a mil but for real dog nobody cares
If you don't share, don't donate to charity
Children who can barely eat, no shoes on their feet
We don't see, we don't read, we don't really need to
Self-centered humans be the root of all evil

Motherfucker I'm ill
What up Bangly?
Your welcome[Intro]
If I gave you my love
Tell you what I do

[Verse 1]
You know this shit, I grow this shit
My modus operandi is devoted to the rhyming
Take the time out to remind them
Watch your heiny right behind you
Lions hide and strike in silence
I'm giant, intertwined with Iron Mike and Kobe Bryant
Cause I am reaching new heights now that I'm defying science
I provide entire slices, all depends how big my pie is, but
I forgot the apricot
Gosh, I'm such a Roger klutz
Knocking sake back with Knoblauch at the opera
Na unh ma ma Babar memoir
I recall it all my dar armed in Upper Darby
Call it karma if you want, when my alarm went off it startled ya
Finish what we started bruh
Departed down the closest road, slowly heading north, let's go

[Verse 2]
A forest or scorched Earth
Morphed into Steven Dorf
A touristy poor world
Unsure what it's even worth
Even worse, my torso's torn, between the two doors
Endorsing the core source, which do I want more?
Is it reality or fantasy
Xanax in my pantry
I supplant the frantic manic depression, utter insanity
Fans and upper management can't understand my planets yet
My plans to be a man, I can stand up
So I vanished quick. My stance on this is scandalous
Fanciness is damaging
Don't let em mix your standards up
Plant your hands and handle it
This game, I put my stamp on it
Handprints in the sand, I'm like a phantom
I'mma scram and dismantle the can that they crammed me in“It was in 2008 when I signed my first record deal. Steve Rifkind took a chance on me after hearing a few bars about equality and an animated Gaby insisting ‘Do not let this kid leave the room.’ I celebrated like any 22-year-old would by dropping out of school and moving to Atlanta with a few of my college buddies. Scooter Braun took responsibility for us hooligans and fostered us into a seasoned starter home on Standard Drive. That Spring we let loose a compilation of recordings we made in our rat-infested basement dubbed The Greenhouse Effect Volume 1. Rounding up some local friends, we shot a video in our living room for a track called “Roth Boys.” The following weeks were spent yelling ‘We on the couuuch’ and/or ‘Who’s in your mouth!’ Excitement ensued and we intensified it by placing a song “I Love College” on my MySpace page. My beer pong skills soon went on to receive recognition and before long we had been plucked from The Greenhouse, released a ‘debut’ album Asleep in the Bread Aisle and placed on tour with fellow [XXL] freshmen Kid Cudi & B.o.B. The Great Hangover had begun.

My life in 2009 was full of experiences that happened so fast I’m glad we taped it. Asleep in the Bread Aisle debuting at number 5 on Billboard along with a successful nationwide tour had left me with somewhat of a career. I met a girl the summer after tour concluded and decided it best to spend my next chapter in New York.

I owe a lot to my time in New York. I met some amazing people who are still very impactful on my life today. I also learned that nobody really gives a fuck. Not in a depressing, cynical way. It’s just that nobody cares about you more than you do. My manager, Scooter, had begun to harbor other talent and the business was starting to take the forefront. The label had begun its search for “I Love College II” and I was only interested in compiling household recordings over some of my favorite beats, which became known as Seared Foie Gras With Quince And Cranberry. I remember recording “I’m Eddy” and feeling like I had accomplished something. Something I was proud of. For the most part, nobody at the label really gave a shit. No offense to me, as I understand it’s their job to concentrate on hit records and not great verses over Dipset beats. Budgets became scarce as the label turned to expensive solutions to find something for the radio. All I could do was vent my frustration in an EP called Rawth with boom bap extraordinaire Nottz Raw."

...

"Still there’s nothing I would change about these past 4 years. I’ve learned too much. I’ve learned about who I am. I’ve learned about where I am. I’ve learned about what I’m doing. I’ve learned about picking your battles. I’ve learned about patience. I’ve learned about communication. About being part of a team. I’ve learned to shut up and listen. These last few years have instilled in me an understanding that vision and commitment go a long way. That the scenic route takes time and isn’t easy but it is by far the most rewarding. I’ve learned to spend time with people you love. Doing what you love. To surround yourself with people who inspire and believe in each other. People who encourage you to just do your thing.

That is why I’ve decided to stray from the path UMG has laid for me and continue on the scenic route. I prefer to relay my music directly to my fans. Show them what it is I see. Share with them what it is I think. I enjoy letting you hear free-flowing ideas recorded in basements and broom closets. Who cares that they will probably never be heard on the radio? I want to be proactive and not reactive and I would rather nothing get in the way of the relationship I have with my family, friends, fans and my music.

I encourage you all to do the same. Do your thing. Do it every day. Do it unapologetically. Don’t be discouraged by criticism. You probably already know what they’re going to say. Pay no mind to the fear of failure. It’s far more valuable than success. Take ownership, take chances and have fun. And no matter what, don’t ever stop doing your thing.”[Verse 1 - Asher Roth]
Don't it feel so good
Say it out loud, lemme hear y'all
It's the weekend, you can fill my cup
Put it in the air, don't care, so what
Day's been long but the night's still young
And the prettiest of women wanna have some fun
Place be jumpin', Nate Dogg pumpin
Put your bag down, take a break for once
Dance on the floor if you want to
Make plans, bring friends, yeah come through
Do a little 2-step, yeah 1 2
Getting drunk til I start doing kung fu
Rum's cool, with a little Red Bull
And a tiny bit of lemon: goes down so smooth
I'm grown up now so there's really no rules
I'm happy that I made it through the day
Let it go, like:

[Hook]
Hey, it's another one down
Another one down

[Verse 2 - Asher Roth]
There's a lot going on in the world, man
I just wanna kick back with my girlfriend
Get an ice cream cone, put a swirl in
And not worry about when the work ends
Self-serve, man we going way too fast
Need to slow down, lean back, relax
Turn the tunes up, throw down them bags
Pick yourself up, man don't be sad
It ain't that bad, don't freak son
Some things can't take Liam Neeson
Got fam, got friends, got freedom
Good to have an iPhone, don't need one
Let me see some, screaming out "ole"
Time to celebrate, hip-hop hooray
This ones on me; no work, all play
I'm happy that I made it through the day
Let it go like:

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Baby, life is more than
Making copies and drinking coffee
It's time for me to make time for me (Right?)
Baby, we should celebrate
And go crazy, just you and me

[Hook][Verse 1]
Holy goof, who gon' do it if it's not me?
Oh it's only you, whoopdie do who gon' stop me?
Linking up with Tek in Cincinnati
Steady rocking rhymes while you talk Illuminati
Child please, steaming hot steady making broccoli
Sugar snap peas, better piece what I'm sprouting
Bounce b like we going out with no house keys
Leave 'em like wow, so wow, don't know how he
(?) be proud freaking speak loudly
Can't figure out, go try to seek therapy
Hourly, rate is like 15 for fakes
Got 16s for real, a big screen in space
And Brooke Shields so real I can almost lick her face
A slicker Navy Seal, I ain't slippin' 'til it's safe
One more sip and I can taste it, notice the concentration
Got that fresh juice, it's the end of conversation
Forget about it, it's stellar talent, he's well around it
A better challenge an entire planet he been around it
Get your calendar counting up all the men who doubted
Friends that matter don't flatter you they just get the pound
Gather around it's astounding I quickly think it's crowded
The highly touted get routed without a set to salvage
Since it's valid, I'm setting aside the Caesar salad
Instead of violence I keep the balance and clean my palette
This is Allen in game one when they won
Tyronn Lue, you lose but hope you stay strong
Take the rapping way back into where it came from
You say you stacking my tracks but couldn't name one
Stay hungry, stay cool, play dumb
Skip school and break rules, it's way fun
Grey Goose with Jesus and his gay son
Phase two, it's steak juice; A1[Hook]
I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas
I like to oh, oh, oh, opples and bononos
I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas
I like to oh, oh, oh, opples and bononos

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Holy smokes artichoke, art of Mozart
Sharpen note, poptart, part Hall and Oates (Hall and Oates)
Heart of coal, à la carte, de la mode, De La Soul, de la woah
Yo that Roth kid can go (he can go)
De la flow, daylight come, she go home
We got stoned, she got flown tho so I got dome (I got dome).
HAHA-YO, this is corner liquor store
Flick my bic and bitch and moan, switching pictures pitch is low (pitch is low)
Sit your slow ass down, a-bow bow
I Ron Browz with pants down all around town (around town)
So So-Cal there's no doubt I know now
Grow your own style, yo, right about now.

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Pop a chakra, pop, lock, and drop it
Block block, get off him Rock n Jock was awesome
Talk to John Carson, clock stops the ball, son
Pause... Who died and left Charles in charge?
Let me borrow your car, bring it back tomorrow unscarred
In the garden of art, startled dog caught me off guard
D-d-d, darn it Mercutio, dookie chain, Gucci flow
Hootie blows fish, thought I really love sushi though (no she don't)
Never on the first date anyway
Used to bang groupie hoes, Now I'm in a better place (better rate)
Better late than never better set 'er straight
Meditate to center Eddie Vedder needs a better mate (better man)
Better stay, settle for the lesser pay
Like the sweater weather but I still believe in yesterday (what's today?)
What's-his-face must've missed the bus but hey
Fuck it what's the rush? We gon' walk it up the other way

[Hook][Intro: Asher Roth]
You're like a one year old bro
Yeah, well you're like a nine year old
Yeah, well at least I know shit
Here's a— (x11)

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Here's a different perspective
My best shit comes when I least expect it
My concerts blood tears and sweat shit
My contents been pure neglected, but
I guess I need to be less domestic (true)
I tend to rest in the nest and just think 'bout
That's where it all gets a bit messy
I'll be all stressed trying to be impressive like
I need to be the best no exceptions so
When I blow up those expect me to
And the flow oh so perfected
Flow the freshest so so infectious tell
Tell the rest can agree nobody better than Ash
No rest, no breathe 'til I'm making it happen
You know the fact, yeah veteran act
Yeah impression, that whenever I rap
I'm tremendous when I'm putting every letter intact
That's when it all crashes, ashes to ashes
Fall flat smack dab right on my ass, and
The glass shatters and it shattered on the floor
And everything you thought of doesn't matter anymore
It's erratic, only static when grammatic from your pore
It's as bad as if a rapper didn't have metaphor (whats a metaphor?)
A metaphor a dinner that is never poured
Triple what I ordered, yo I think I need a better four
But of course only on the first course, par four
Four more tell when I can call—four!
Playing horse I already have hor—
Need a miracle and so I heave it up from half court
Im heating up A. Roth small forward
I wanna cross-over ever since I saw Jordan, but
Now I'm torn wanna be more burr
33 so mean on that green uniform, but
Really what I means and it seems I've learned
I can only be me, I can be no more
When I'm free, I'm Thor, When I speak I'm sure
That everything released comes deep from the pour
Like back in ’04 way 'fore I scored a single that had lingered
And got us on tour I would rap for a laugh
Rap just to pass and the time and
The pass and the rhyme to the left
Got signed and forget how to rhyme and direct like
From the feeling from the feelings that I get
So back to the back to the basics
White t-shirt and some mother fucking Asics
Ay bitch this is the rebirth of the greatest
Famous name and it starts with an A it's—Ash Roth![Hook: D.A.]
Take me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end
Write these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know

[Verse 1: Asher Roth] + (D.A.)
I was in seventh grade when I heard The Slim Shady LP
Yeah my mom brought it down when I was ironing, irony
Getting out the wrinkles, just a little kid in middle school
Sink my teeth in anything, to think I'm cool
Riding the bus, I feel the rush from "I Still Don't Give a Fuck"
Yeah, I wish I could agree, but I've already had enough
I've already given up, from playing the same game
Every interview, feel like I'm saying the same thing
Like "Em was great, yeah he paved the way for me"
He was inspiration for everybody from A to Z
But they keep relating me, I can't get away, chasing me
(All Day Long) I hear it (All Day Long)
And now the masses think that Asher wants to be a Marshall Mathers
They say "Asher's not a rapper, nah his ass is just an actor"
Cause we have the same complexion and similar voice inflection
It's easy to see the pieces and to reach for that connection
Each second of every minute, each hour of every day
I'm constantly on the fence, defending my own name
Explaining we're not the same
Not much that I can say, except that I'm sick of it
Critics, I've only sparked up a flame, it's on...

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Asher Roth] + (D.A.)
Now, don't get it twisted, I've definitely benefited
It's like suddenly everyone wants to hear what I be spitting
So different, the image, they don't get it
It's simple, I'm just a kid who wants to rap to make a living
But Em was in it way before I committed
And his lyrics were the shit so I really gotta come with it (gotta go hard)
But each critic be picking apart my writtens
If it isn't up to par than Asher Paul is just a gimmick (fucking joke)
Is it my fault? Must I be more convincing?
Y'all talk all ya want, never halt me from my mission
Use it as ammunition, would you please keep dissing me?
(All Day Long) I hear it (All Day Long)
And yeah the haters wanna hate me cause I made it and I'm famous
But until you take my place, you'll never know bout what it takes
To make a record for respect, take a second to inspect
When you look like someone else, then what the fuck do you expect?
I just want to be accepted as the illest in the game
But it's harder for an artist creating his own lane
That's synonymous with rhyming and combined with perfect timing
On the time I got left declining and bout to explode so hold on

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
So fuck it, that's all I've got, there's nothing else for me to say
If I don't confront the problem, then it will never go away
Unless it is addressed, there is nothing left for me to do
It's impossible rejecting an elephant in the room
Say goodbye to all the bullshit, notions pre-conceived
So long to all the blogs, coulda sworn they knew me
If you have no further questions and can't think of other thoughts
Then I'd like to introduce you to Asher Paul Roth, dawg

[Hook] x2[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Yeah, as comfortable as a mug
The rug under my feet, you see it keeps me from pulling it up
I'm young, I got my lunch packed and brown bagged do not look fat
I even think I got a snack pack
And dad pays for gas in the hatch back front seat
Lean back when I leave it there he always gets mad
Turn the bass on the BOSE up to full let it blow roll the windows down and lets roll
I'm home
Feels so good knowing there's a bowl of cereal
And milk in the fridge when I wake every morn
Never fold my own laundry, dog are you feeling me?
I pay no bills, no rent, no utilities
As, good as it gets
But, no regrets
When I turn my back on it
Tell my parents I'm gone and
Don't wait up, be late when I make the name famous
The smile on my face size of the Great Lakes (Great Lakes)

[Verse 2: Whatzisface]
When I get back home I'm ma kick my feet up
Got man food to eat up
Went to take a poo
Who left my seat up? (what the?)
I read the paper while I'm pushing them trouble times
Plus, the can fit for a king, wiping with double ply
Toothbrush new, and clean my shoes with it, yep man
Shower all clean no pubes in a wet drain
No dudes on my couch, or chicks in my crib
But just a, ill that I rolled, and a six in my fridge
I got my, hand on my balls while I hang up my drawers
And wіth my, full on pause I ain’t taking nο calls
Sο if уου, know lіkе I know being home ain't a chore
Sο I'm ma sit οn my couch, chill watching ѕοmе porn
Cause when the rents gone dog I bе οn ѕοmе Ferris
Bueller I be fueling up the car at mу parents
Bυt wait a second, mу folks don’t hаνе a Solarus
Oops, mу bad, seems thіѕ іѕ thе wrong address

[Verse 3: Chip Tha Ripper]
I’m іn thе basement cold chillin' (chllin')
Dіd I take thе garbage out, I sure didn’t
I’m straight tripping, grades slipping I’m οn punishment
Cаn’t even slide tο that house party where аll thе honeys wеnt (damn)
Cartoon Network, MTV, BET, MTV jams, vh1, History, A&E
Working fοr whoever paying mе except thе police
Stay up аll night kicking raps аnd smoking don’t gеt nο sleep
And еνеr ѕіnсе I brοkе thаt table іn thе kitchen
Thеу bеen taking mу allowance аѕ thе payment fοr thе fixin'
Cυt thе grass, clean mу room аnd аll thаt bull
Kicking nеw raps in thе lunchroom whеn I gеt tο school
Mу nigga dope took mе tο Sydney Bloke tο gеt thе gear
Throw backs and J's ain’t thаt whу wе here
I’m 13 again hopped up іn thе hot tub time machine
Cаn’t walk without no freestyles egging οn Holloween[Asher Roth]
Uh, and it just keeps goin (yeah)
And it just keeps

So I'm in the airport getting ready to leave
Heading to a friend's wedding in the N.Y.C
But my head has been spinning, I'm forgetting to eat
All this jet setting has been really getting to me
It's already 11:20, I'm ready to sleep
But instead I end up sitting in a 27-C
An aisle seat, fine by me
But the guy that's inside's always tryin to pee
With a wild child behind me, he's cryin and keeps
Flippin out and kickin at me while he violently screams
So I silently plea, oh God, please
Let there be a honey sitting 27-B
But of course some morbidly obese
Beast is in the seat that wheezes when he breathes
Dude sitting D is at least three deep
And he keeps telling me what is wrong with his knees: (I got bad knees)
'Osgood Schlatters,' just need water
But for a bottle they charge two dollars" (what?)
And when I thought that it couldn't get worse
I forgot my iPod

[Hook: Jazze Pha + Asher Roth]
I'm havin a bad day
Nothin ever seems to go my way
Everybody needs to go away
Why? Because I'm havin a bad dayyyyy, yeah
Hey hey, and it just keeps goin (keep goin)
And it just keeps (goin on!)
And it just keeps goin (keep goin)
And it just keeps (goin on)

[Asher Roth]
So four hours and turbulence
We land when I'm about to turd in my pants
But the captain has "Seatbelt fastened"
So my ass is just passin gas and
Then at last I escaped from the plane
When I'm minutes away from clinically insane
I make my way towards baggage claim
When I hear a high-pitched voice scream my name (Asher!)
Some dumb bitch I went to high school with
While I'm sweating she's telling me she likes my shit
I just smile and think, 'bout how great it would be
If I could just hit this chick with a quick leg sweep (leg sweep)
So I pick up my L.L. Bean
And beeline for the next taxi
In need of weed, and boxer briefs
But my bag's only got Maxi's

[Hook]

[Asher Roth]
I check in to my hotel room
And I pick up my cell phone to dial the groom
Tell him my mood and I'm ordering food
And I'm probably gonna stay in and watch a movie
But the tube has no HBO (what?)
So anything I want, yo I'm paying fo'
But I'm lame and broke, so I'm laying in a robe
Watching that "Little People, Big World" show
Right then there's a knock at the door
It's my last hope for a Spanish whore
Who will change my sheets in exchange for penis
"Hi, I've lost my cat; have you seen it?"
Jesus, this day is the worst
At least I can give Little Me a jerk
And then go to sleep, healthy and disease-less
It guess it could be worse; but I'm just

[Hook]

[Jazze Pha]
Hey, and it keep goin onnnnn
Hahahaha, yo[Hook]
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
My raps, my raps
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
Too advanced for y'all
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
I spark light with the pen
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
My raps are, my raps are unbelievable

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
I think it's time I play the lotto
I'm feeling lucky sucker, oh well fuck it is my motto
Gotta bring the ruckus, smoking nuggets, sip moscato
With Roscoe Dash while I play his record on serato
Vado's prolly my favorite rapper since Bob Dole
Odd flow so I drive slow with my eyes closed
Stop stroll, nah yo I'd rather eat hot crow
Closed throat, gross bro don't forget to swallow
Hollow that's what they try to tell me that my rhymes is
So I found God, had to tell him what his Moms did
What is this some fucking sick joke
Like an anorexic chick putting on a strip show
No shit oh bitch go and let them nips show
Let me see a pole flip and then throw it back ho
Bend that back bone when I take it back home
Heard I made that ass fat, im a fucking rap pro let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvey]
Man I came to bring the pain, Twelvey spitting flames
Live from the 212 with my A dollar gang
AP Audamar, running like a Viking back
Instagram with the flow
All the hoes be liking that, recite it back
Run it back, play it over, play it over
ASAP everything, my young nigga’s taking over
Pop Rex make your soda loud its a roll up
Cooking up some shit Ty Dash screaming hold up
Rosay what it do, trill niggas making moves
Came to give you hell, for the pleasure and the principal
Kicked outta school, school, trapping in the frat house
Gorgeous motherfucker getting pussy like a cat house
Blow her back out, didn’t bring the stacks out
Then she got a train, everybody in the stash house
Carolina blue jays, shit is like Stackhouse
Sipping real slow but a nigga on the fast route
Last year this time I was on some low shit
Last year this time y'all was on some ho shit
Body after body I'm a twelve gauge shotty
Toasted to the most high cause I know that God's got me

[Bridge]
Man I came to play
I ain’t talking bout no games today
Man i’m tripping on the fame today
Man I aim to spray, step back and let the flame away
I set it off, man I came to play
Man i’m tripping on the fame today
Man I aim to spray, step back and let the flame away
Yo I think I took to many of those
Yo Ash how many was I supposed to take, I think I'm fucked

[Verse 3: Chip Tha Ripper]
Walk in the most expensive strip club with my dick out
Pitched a fist full of change at the stripper and knocked that bitch out
Today was my first day at work I brought your dish out
Clip my toenails over your plate to watch you fish out
Pictures of greatness show me wear the cake is
I'mma take it and shove it all up in the lawmakers faces
Doing what you feel could be unreal
I looked up and spit like a half a mill
Pictures of my old crib hanging in my new crib
Raps and hoes besides those I don’t do shit
Trying to live extra cool, I don’t fuck with the stress
Louie condoms, bitch come get fucked with finesse
The school pimping the kids, they selling chocolate bars
Me and my niggas in this bitch and we some chocolate stars
You said I fell off, my money said that bitch a liar
How you sleeping on Chip when your mattress on fire
Tonight's the night that could change your life girl
All you gotta do is give him what he like girl
A lotta head, a lot of shut the fuck up and chill
Maybe a twenty-five some and two Viagra pills

[Hook]

[Verse 4: YP]
Blunts rolled now flame up, I done came up
When you steady going up they wanna hang you
But I ain't worried until they read me a verdict
I promise I'mma splurge it cause I feel I deserved it
I get more from flipping than burgers
Move from a worker to the chairman of my own operation
You could get under, no wonder
I throw a party and bitches think it's a slumber
It's some chicks that spent the night, I never gave em my number
I'm young Hefner, couple cuties to measure
Hundred and twelve weigh it up, its nothing extra
And when you murdered the pen they wanna test you
Just dont make me black yo eyes like Uncle Fester
Don't you know I'm one of them guys go check the record
Have me get to clapping like the end of a lecture
I'm building an empire you part of this, you lucky
They call me YP but in my city I'm like Nucky
Ripley's couldn't believe it and haters feel the same
They dont know about the grand, think juices are Minute Maid
I tell them all the time, get out, get paid
Are you here for the long haul or only just a phase[Verse]
Y'all learned the hard way, sometimes you crawl too far
But you ain't climbed this high to fall
Scared of heights bright lights, shine in the dark
It's no walk in the park, more like salsa dancing in New York
Can't be taught all raw talent, my talents, all valid, organics, my salad
I'm authentic, I'm off my neck
Yeah I think I must have lost my head by keep rolling
I'm waste deep in the quicksand, this is where it kicks in
Killer instincts, they grip in
No kickstand ride it, ride it
And this is it man, ride or dying
I'm taking it too easy not warm yet
Don't wanna pull nothing let's not force it now
Cause close only counts in horseshoes pal
If I'mma do it, I'mma do it all sorts of wow
Rhyme with you, I'mma ruin all sorts of doubt
She with you then I'mma do in, just toss the towel
Run in to it my intuitive is awesome, wow
Super duper how he do it he's a foster child?
Hardly, raised in, Yardley, this rap thing's a phase it's mainly a hobby
But oddly enough, stayed with it, I'll be
Gosh darn it what his name isn't who is he — Asher!
Last chance here's a free pass man
Go now we can put it in the past tense
Or you can stay and get your ass kicked
Mop the floor with you, put you in the trash can
No laughing I'm actually passive but Ash is just nasty when naturally rapping
Too fast I don't think you can grasp it
And that's it, Cannon show 'em where the scratch is[Intro: Cee-Lo]
I gotta be by myself
Gotta be by myself this time

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
In the backseat screaming out loud
In the backseat screaming out
Ash is young, attractive, handsome bachelor, awesome rapper
Got a knack for vernacular when I perform spectacular
I'll have any girl that I want
I'mma take the girl in the front
Boobs bounce when I tell the crowd jump
Honey, come backstage I just want to have fun
But I'm too young to be locked down, not now
Need a new car, drive around with the top down
New broad with her bra and her top down
Chillin' in the backseat screaming out loud

[Refrain: Cee-Lo]
She wants to be my lady but I don't see her
She wants to be my lady but I'm a free bird
I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, go get high by myself this time

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
The cycle is Shawn Michaels, heartbreak
And yeah, I like you but not enough to wife you
Say I'm nice, true and you think I'm the right dude
But there's another girl just like you, like who
I'm on the road, another night, another show
New event in a new time zone
And the live show is so mind blowing
And it's my show so you know that I'm blown, you know
No text gonna give me head
Long distance just ain't my thing
Yeah I'm single, don't need no ring
I'm a free man now, I don't need no strings, sing

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
If you're cool with nights at the pool
Jacuzzis and groupies, groupies and booze
And no rules, I'm only twenty two
I need to watch football and hang with the crew
But if you don't get mad when I get fat
Cause all I do is eat, drink, smoke weed and rap
And play Madden then dag
You're pretty rad and I take it all back, c'mon

[Hook]

Just keep clapping your hands
Feels good, feels nice and warm in here right now
I'm feeling free, if you feel free
Clap your hands, ah, ah, ah, c'mon

[Refrain][Produced by Asher Roth and Blended Babies]

[Hook: Major Myjah]
When the crows fly away
And the sun decides to come out
And all my dreams awake
And I feel free again
The crows fly away
And the sun decides to come out
And all my dreams awake
And I feel free again

[Hook: Major Myjah]
Just let me be right [x4]
Just lettin' the beat ride [x4]

[Verse 1 - Asher Roth]
Give it away, give it away
Give it away, now
Haven't felt this way
Since when I moved to A-town
I've decided I'm a do my thing
And stay proud
Used to be some doubt
But now the whole world's my playground
Yesterday, I felt the burdens on my shoulder
But I learned to let it go and
Keep on keeping on my composure
Yea they always told me certain things hit when your older
So you must lift up the hood
And take a look up at the motor
So, no more oil slips
You owe me that, you owe me this
You’re on your own, You’re only hope is ownin up
To know your gift
The zodiac can only help to loan you hints
Take control of yours alone, for ownerships the only risk
No magic potion for the loneliness
Some people who are the loneliest, they happen to be only rich
So get going before the going gets
Homie saw my loathing so he told me this

[Hook: Major Myjah]

[Hook: Major Myjah](x2)

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Yeah trust that my gut is in the right place
And when I jump, won’t hit a bump and fall right on to my face
And I might
And thats alright
Ill just get up and say
At least I took a chance to make advances in this life, hey
Hey a new day, never wasted
Don’t be scared to take it there
The truth gets in the way and makes the mood muddled lazy
Fools are persuaded
But our rules aren’t the same
Remember do something crazy! (Do something crazy!)
Don’t want every day to be the same thing
Would be a shame to miss the beauty that the rain brings
When the change intimidates and says remain tame
Look it in its face and say that ain't how he became king
King, king, but really I don’t need much
When it comes to time I want for mine to be on recess
No more feeling tied up in complete stress
Big sigh of relief
I have reset

[Hook: Major Myjah]

[Hook: Major Myjah](x8)[Intro: Don Cannon]
Greenhouse Effect Volume 1!
Asher Roth!
Don Cannon!

[Hook: Asher Roth] x2
I got the fresh bowl cut, curly blond locks
LA Gears light up when I walk, floss
And my Osh Kosh B'Gosh overalls match my He-Man lunch box

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Overall, probably say I was an 8
Only cause I was running a slightly bit late
For my first day of first grade with Ms. Smith
Who sat across the way, was the chick Meredith
The hottest girl I knew at the age of 6
Bow matched the shoes, shoes matched the dress
I'm an anxious kid, so this is dangerous
Start sweatin', gettin' nervous, feelin' strange as shit
Now it's lunchtime, I'm drinking milk
Brain starts to panic, room starts to tilt
I'm feelin' nauseous, stomach doin' flips
Then up comes my lunch right on to Meredith
A little on her lap, more so on her black shoes
"Sorry," I said "Couldn't wait until the bathroom."
"I feel so bad, how do I make it up to you?
Can I pick you up on my bike after school like..."[Intro]
Man, I don't know
I'm just trying to have fun with it everywhere I go
Truth be told I just got caught up in a bunch of nonsense
Trying to take the fun out of my back pockets and stuff
You'll never take my freedom, you know?

[Verse]
Yo, Ash stop fucking around, yo where's the album?
Your second try never came out my man, how come?
You were like the coolest guy, now we want Malcolm
Who out here too loud, you need to turn it down some
Chill, not now son
Your doubt can't jeopardize my outcome
I style like I'm stretching out in Shaolin
Man of many sounds, I come around
They ask "Who?" like Pete Townshend
I'm O-Town meets Andre 3000, either way keep bouncing
It's wild, I don't even leave the house
And I don't feel the need to reason with you children
Needs to be arousing like a jousting match fouled him
I ain't counting that, astounding how I'm rounding out my alphabet
We ain't even rowdy yet
Salvy ain't make himself a Salvy yet
Bout it since we started smoking salvia
Cruising in a golf cart on the gulf coast with a GoPro
And my bro knows, why old folks go 'There goes that Bozo'
My flow like J. Flacco getting tackled by fat dude
Who grabbed [?] on a back road in bath robe with a bad cold
Homie, I'm that cold
Ash, I just walk around with an afro
And a gavel and I laugh more than a jackal
Crack up, pistachio
Graduate, forget to flip that tassel
My bad yo, that's too much of a hassle
Casserole with Castro
Stash gets blown like it's a gastro, you gassed though
More like watching grass grow
I can be an asshole
I rather just hang out in my castle, blast Outkast
Yo Elroy, where's Astro?
Bet if the Jetsons had a best friend from Def Jam
And Geffen and wed them, I would be the best man
Get it? I'm a breast man
Stick my face right between that chest and
Motorboat those cocos you know it though
Don't no one wan' go toe-to-toe…. rototiller… photos off your motorola phone are terrible
Terrible, Terridome, territory, Tara Reid
Dude from 90210, tornado made of hammer domes
Sharin' poems here, smell my pheromones
Yeah yo, my hair's long
I don't even care homes
Takes these earphones, put them on your eardrums
Here's some of this red rum, you ready boy, here it comes
You ready boy, here it comes

[Verse 2]
On a full ride to Florida State, too high played it safe
Could've been Flo Rida, my bad, my mistake
Should've started Footloose, the new Kevin Bac'
The way I play chicken in busses with no brakes
And Busta was on break, taking a pay cut
I play cuts from my stuff, make everybody go nuts
Now everybody say "Whaaaat?"

[Outro]
What was that? That was fun
Let's do that again[Intro]
Let's head into the Ford Taurus and cruise around the streets for a little bit

[Hook]
Yo, we cruisin', Yeah, we cruisin'
Yo, we cruisin' down the streets
I got the money, Who got the dutchie?
You got the munchies, I got the weed
You know we be
Blunt Cruisin' x2
My homies in the front, got honeys in the back
Yo, roll that weed up and put it in the air
You know we be
Blunt Cruisin' x2

[Verse 1]
Yo, roll it up (roll it tight), hit it once (hit it twice)
Pass it round (pass it round) but don't roll the windows down
Let's box it out (box it out) and save the trees (save the trees)
We hoppin' out like the mystery machine
My eyes be the size of Mr. Miyagis
Squinting to read the fine print on the widescreen
We riding, riding and that's when I see
Headlights behind me, I then start to freak
Hide the weed, oh x4
You know I got it

[Hook 2]
You know we be
Blunt Cruisin' x2
My homies in the front, got honeys in the back
Yo, roll that weed up and put it in the air
You know we be
Blunt Cruisin' x2
Yo, we cruisin', Yeah, we cruisin'
Yo, we cruisin' down the streets
I got the money, Who got the dutchie?
You got the munchies, I got the weed

[Verse 2]
Yo, stop at Sev' for a drink, ice cream and some chips
Where's the dutch at, homie pass that shit
Not like that, homie, ash that shit
Can you turn this song up, homie, ash that shit
You don't need roach clips if you can't hold it
You can use your phone tip, hurry up and take this
Fa real man, hurry up and take this shit
Yo, it's burning my fingertips, dude
Drop the weed, oh x2
Yeah I got it
Drop the weed, oh x2
Yeah I got it, oh x3

[Hook]
