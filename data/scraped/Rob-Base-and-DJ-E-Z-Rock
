[Intro]
Right about now, you're about to be possessed by the sounds of emcee Rob Base and D.J. E-Z Rock

[Hook]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

[Verse 1]
I wanna rock right now
I'm Rob Base and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known to rock the microphone
Because I get stupid, I mean outrageous
Stay away from me if you're contagious
Cause I'm the winner, no, I'm not a loser
To be an M.C. is what I choose-a
Ladies love me, girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me
Like the way that I rhyme at a show
The reason why, man, I don't know
So let's go, cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My name is Rob, I gotta real funky concept
Listen up, cause I'm gonna keep you in step
I got an idea
That I wanna share
You don't like it? So what, I don't care
I'm number one, the uno, I like comp
Bring all the suckers cause all them I'll stomp
Bold and black but I won't protect
All of my followers cause all I want is respect
I'm not a doctor, put them in rapture
A slick brother that can easy outfox ya
Cause I'm Rob, the last name Base, yeah
And on the mic, I'm known to be the freshest
So let's start, it shouldn't be too hard
I'm not a sucker so I don't need a bodyguard
I won't fess, wear a bulletproof vest
Don't smoke buddha, can't stand sess, yes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The situation that the Base is in
I'm kinda stingy that's why I don't wanna lend
A funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend
But listen up cause I want you to comprehend
Cause I'm the leader, the man superior
I take care of ya and then ya get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes are not counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt to listen to Red Alert
Take off your shirt
Make sure it don't hit the dirt
I like the kids; the guys, the girls
I want the ducats cause this is Rob Base's world
I'm on a mission, ya better just listen
To my rhymes cause I'm all about dissin'
Cause

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I stand alone, don't need anyone
Cause I'm Rob, just came to have fun
Don't need friends that act like foes
Cause I'm Rob Base, the one who knows
About things that make ya get weary
Don't cheer me, just hear me
Out cause I got the clout, shout (Ho!)
Before I turn the party out
I won't stutter
Project my voice, speak clearly
So you can be my choice
On stage or on record
Go to the Wiz and select it
Take it off the rack, if it's wack put it back
I like the Whopper, fuck the Big Mac
If you want static, so let's go
So, throw up your hands
Go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me? No, oh
Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the back-up
We're not soft, so you better just slack up
Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze
Rock the mike with the help of EZ
Rock on the set, the music plays
Only cuts the records that I say

[Hook]

[Outro]
All right, now, EZ Rock
Now, when I count to three
I want you to get busy
You ready now?
One, two, three, get loose now!

[Hook][Hook:]
Joy and pain
Like sunshine and rain
Joy and pain
Like sunshine and rain

[Verse 1:]
Well I'm the new kid, I'm just comin' up
A lot of rappers think that I can't tear it up
Well I'm 'a show 'em and ignore 'em
And when they think I ain't lookin' I floor 'em
I mean take 'em out I keep groovin'
A slick bass line keep the beat movin'
They can't take it they just fake it
They wonder how the Rob Base make it
I get I'll, you know the deal
Cause this is how the Rob Base feels

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I keep smokin', hot like fire
You had the turn, now retire
Don't talk back, I'm not a new jack
Cause I'm fresher than you, an' you're whacked
I keep tryin', I'm not lyin'
Up to number 1 is where I'm flyin'
I won't slow down cause I'm the new kid
With the devastatin' sound that hits
In the house where I used to practice
No one knew the Rob exists, but now
I'm gettin' greedy, don't lead me
The wrong way cause is just might, might, might
Bring me down, I'll have to fight to get back up
Move away cause I just won't slack up

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Now, I go to shows to watch other MCs rock
And if they're good, I don't knock
The way they perform cause I like to see a good show
After that, go play ceelo, y'know
Cause I'm a leader, no I'm not a follower
And MCs like you I swallow 'em
So don't look and try to judge me
Because you think that I'm another MC, well
I'm the new kind, I just moved around
But that don't mean I can't rip up the town
Me an' my boys, we make noise
I hate MCs that think they're with toys
I'm hittin' harder than any other MC
Who try to come up and go against me

[Hook:]

[Verse 4:]
Not from the old school or from the new
Applaud the boom, do what you want to
Talk to me then try to put me down
We used to be cool now we don't hang around
Used to be friends but now we're foes
Ask me why, man, no one knows
Maybe jealousy between you and me
Could be the fame, could be the money
I'm goin' for mine and I don't really care
Cause the spotlight Rob Base don't share
I'm the headliner of this show
And you're just a kid and you need to grow, because

[Hook:]Artist: Rob Base and D.J. E-Z Rock
Album: It Takes Two
Song: Don't Sleep on It

Emcees, tryin' ta play post, play me up close, brag and boast
Ya know
Things like that make me weary, but
I never let a rapper get near me, cuz
I'm Rob Base, pick up the pace
It takes more than beats to rock this place
It takes more than rhymes to rock this time
Rhyme for rhyme, the Base design
M.C.'s get mad, cuz I'm blowin' up
To every battle, the Base keeps showin' up
A fast tempo, a-with a hook
Don't judge a book by the way that the cover look
Cuz I'm mean, reign supreme
Wrote my first rhyme at the age of fifteen
I'm like a match, when struck I burn
Not concerned cuz I'm sure that ya won't learn
Now git up, and let's start
I wanna see which sucka got heart
I get fresh as I get older
Every time I rock I get bolder
So don't sleep, and say I'm wack
Cuz if ya do ya get backslap (backslap)

Chorus:

If it's not in your vision
Don't sleep on it
Don't sleep on it

Don't make a-no decision
TURN IT UP! (On the bass right now)

Drop your ego, and let me go
And just show what I know cuz I'm on the go
I rock smooth, bust a move, hit me
And the way I perform, you can't forget me
Clear off the smoke, this ain't a joke
The new kid on the block is like dope
Been here for a while, been all punishment
But now I'm on (I'mon), so let's start it
No I'm not retarded, or either crazy
I work hard, I'm not lazy
Rappers don't faze me, or eith-amaze me
Or either come up close and just graze me
Coolin', neva be a fool, and
Gimme just a little mo' time I be rulin
Tell it to the mack, cuz I'm on wax
But should I pay tac, or should I just act
To get a new job, yes, time is what I'm pressed for
Every time I perform ya want more so (so...)

Chorus

Aaaaaah, break it down, to get the dope sound
Then hang around with the posse from Uptown
On the Ave, they get cash
But I leave it alone cuz I'm a smash
On the mic, I think differently, a-from another or other MC who
Intervene, try to just rip up the Rob on the sneak tip
I get mad, they get sad, or either rag the had cuz I'm that bad
I'm not frontin', cuz this is my theory
You don't believe me, so just hear me
I rock harder, I rock longer
I do this cuz I gotta get stronger
A lotta rappers rhyme harder, and meaner
But I rhyme with the sound that's cleaner
"I ain't nuthin'", that's what they say
Well OK if they wanna play that way
Cuz I'm Rob buttkickin' Base
What rapper's next to be erased?
On my list, I'm not known to diss
But I'll do it, so don't sleep on this, c'mon

Chorus

Hit it, admit it, ya did it, ya can't fit it
So forget it cuz I know you ain't wit' it
In the centre, I didn't rent her
Sat 'cha butt in the chair, got a splintuh!
Back in the days, amazed by the rap phrase
Rap today, to me it don't faaaaaaze me
I'm not another M.C., or angry by the way ya speak to me
Jealousy; what makes you wanna battle me
Dope beats; what makes you wanna idol me
It ain't nuthin' to me or E-Z
Cuz I'm the R, the O, the B, and he's E-Z
I bust a fee wherever it be, ya see
He or me, the E, the Z, the A, the B
Alphabet's from A to Z, ya see
I'm not tryin' to confuse your mind
I'm just tryin' to pump this plain old fresh rhyme
I stay calm, rap like a pro
I know ya know, so let's go, c'mon!

Chorus

Now E-Z Rock, you remember how we did it before
I want you to do it one more time, for ya mind
1-2-3, give it to 'em

If it's not (scratching)
Don't sleep on it, come on!
If it, if it, if it's not (scratching)
Don't sleep on it, come on!
(To fade)Chorus:

You got the time
Ta ta tata ta ta times are gettin' ill

[Verse 1]

Just last week I had a good thing goin
The money was flowin
I had a notion, I made a motion
To get a girl with love and devotion
I went to a disco...ordered a bottle of Cisco
Took a seat, and I looked around
Bobbin' my head to the sound
Of the D.J., OK, this is what I'm tryin' ta say
I heard a scream (AAAAAAH!)
Then a shot rang out (BOOOOOM...BOOOOOM)
That's when I got the hell out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Gettin ill, with the boys
Somebody yelled (KILL THAT NOISE!!!)
I didn't even front
Pulled out the brand new pump shotgun
He pulled first, that's when things got worse
I didn't wanna raaaaahd no hearse
So I pulled the trigger with a burst...of gunfire
He missed, I hit, and that's the end of it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

There was this girl named Lisa
I was in love with her
This girl was superiuh
She had a Benz and a Audi
She was fly, but the girl was kinda rowdy
I couldn't understand, her plan
A girl like this didn't have a man
So I pushed up, and made my move
To the bass that was real smoove
I pulled her, and now I'm hangin' out...with huh
She offered me coke
I said no cuz I don't do dope
She got mad, started breakin
Started braggin bout the money she's makin
Off of sellin it, for the hell of it
To me it's not irrelevant

[Hook]

[Verse Four:]

Sittin on a stoop with the rest of the crew
It was nothin' ta do
So we took a walk, through Central Park...it was dark
A car drove up, it was a Mercedes
Filled with a bunch of ladies
The driver was a guy, with a tie, the man was fly
He was a pimp, or a dope pusha
I could tell by the way he mushed uh
Girl in her face
She ran, he started to chase her
And beat her down, to the ground
While the other girls just stood around
We didn't like it...we got mad
He looked like he thought he was bad
Hopped in his car, and he drove away
This is what I'm tryin' ta say

I got the time
