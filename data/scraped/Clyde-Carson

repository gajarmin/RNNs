Slow down, slow down

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
(I tell 'em)
Ay, I'm on the case gettin' sideways
Dolla fo' five on the highway
You know a nigga state to state
On a dolo mission I got a date with the cake
Wide awoke, 3 A.M
Prolly touch down when the sun come in
Ay, when them guards hit the gate I be tired as fuck after that 8-hour race
I come from the land where we swing our cars
Figure 8 Benz concrete leave marks
Call it paid, super-charged
Back to back race the Benz with the four door Porsche
I'm tearin' up tires in this luxury
Hella smoke says she wanna fuck with me
Money on my mind ain't nothin' for free
Tryna keep up with me but it's nothin' to me

[Hook]x2

[Verse 2: Kaz Kyzah]
(I tell 'em)
Slow down, you know you can't catch me
Hype without fugitive, Snipes Wesley

Wet than a motha fucka whip like a jet ski
Ride like Presley, pills like Graceland
They wanna ship me to Rita and off to reception
Nah, ain't tryna see the state pen
I'm Black Scaled out in my Ray-Bans
Diamond-certified, I ain't neva lied
I ain't had L's since Pac died
Ridin' through the biters, couple bundles talkin' bout sliders
Run from the labors, mind's still swift
FedEx movement all on the bitch
Audi with the stash box, Cazzy too swift
No frontin' push a button give a nigga that...gift

[Hook]x2

[Verse 3: Mayne Mannish]
I'm Jeff Gordon in his heyday
Ridin' like Tony Stewart smashin' through a two-way
Doin' bout a hundred kinda burnin' up the Lou-ie
Lou-ie, Louie 13th motha fucka yeah Louie
D.U.I. drivin black Henny on my lap
Pedal to the flo' with a 808 clap
Money motivated doin' sprints when I'm chasin'
And it gotta be a hemi I don't normally do the basic
Six-cylinder, r-really bruh? Slow it down, keep up
And I'm killin' ya, hope I'm not offendin' ya
See you at the finish line, leavin' em
Burn rubba, bu-burn rubba
This is how we do it when I'm dippin' on a corna
Burn rubba, bu-burn rubba
This is how we do it in Northern California[Hook: Clyde Carson]
Nigga turn down for what?

[Hook: Clyde Carson]

Bitch, I'm from bompton, 2 speeds
Hood nigga smack the kush outta loose leaves
Let her bounce on the dick till that bitch leave
She ain't even gotta call take my ten speed
We don't love 'em(X2) we don't fuck 'em

Dirty sprite, red cup 'em

[Hook: Clyde Carson & Game]

[Verse: 3 Game]

I be smashin' on em (hey, slow down)
They love my style
They scream for my team, mayne they all go wild
Comin' straight out of the bay, where it all goes down
Mayne that sucker shit is dead fuck all those clowns
I'm with Carson and caz and a truck full of broads and some cash
Tell em slow down like they trynna be last
It’s all on a bitch they think I’m trynna be last
Young G, I’m countin' money in class
I’m addicted to somethin'
Need a whip with some buttons
To start my engine
Don’t play like we in detention or somethin'
Every verse is retarded
My brain is missin' or somethin'
And all I know is the money
I’m on a mission or somethin' AYE!!!

[Hook]x2[Chorus: Baby Bash]
See them boys at the bar, they all playing games
Fuck that square, shake that lane
Meet me at the tables, stand up on the couch
And grab the whole bottle and put it in your mouth
I'mma make you break it down
I'mma make you break it down
Now girl go on and break it down, down, down, down, down
Now girl go on and break it down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
She gonna break it down like a pound or a key
Executive suites little mama ven aquí
Lifestyle VIP and we living real mosca
Yeah that's my girl with that platinum chocha
Attitude is a mess cause she loves to get spoiled
Puffing on that cookie with a cup full of oil
Make it blood boil when she coil like a snake
Booty like man, hold up, wait
See the dude she came with, looking square as back pockets
And she leaving with your boy and he couldn't cock block it
And of course I would destroy when I get the bed rockin'
Million dollar pussy and to me its me all profit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Too Short]
You by the bar, broke dudes trying to holla
Can't buy you a drink, he only got 20 dollars
And y'all bitches too fine for that
All the fake ass lines he spit, its bullshit
He ain't no pimp (pimp)
Who you with girl, just you and your friend
We pop bottles last night, we gonna do it again
Baddest girls in the club we moving em in
Find a spot, I'm doing it locked
But if you ain't hot, you know I'm not
We drink shots of Patrón and Cîroc over here
You can go back over there and drink beer

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
I'm a gangsta but I'm so fly
Thirty thousand feet without a plane so high
This an Amsterdam bag not regular motah
Run upon me if you wanna I'm going in your eye
Call me Rother Vandross or the king of the ghetto
I'm a Christian but I got a laser beam on that metal
I don't even need a beat I go platinum accapella
Eiffel Tower leaning homie got purple and got yellow
Finger nails, limousine tinted, smoked too many doobies
200 on the dash no human can lose me
My lower body is for real, woman you can use me
Whenever I break it down, it is where it should be

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Clyde Carson]
I tell the baddest bitch in the party break it down
A real one in the building, smellin' like a pound
I'm comin' fresh up out the huddle, like I'm callin a play
VIP deep and we all from the bay (aaaaayyyy)
You know they know how we act, they know what we do
Reputation for sinnin' em, so come to our booth
Champagne passed around, yeah we aight
Playin with the chicks, since I was knee-high
Models goin up, its prolly goin down
Hard in the paint, mixin clear with my brown
Fuck what they think, as long as I wear the crown
Got lost from your man, you don't wanna be found

[Chorus][Intro/Outro]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
Baby, wanna fuck with me?
On a late night, she just wanna creep
On her boyfriend, she just wanna cheat

[Verse 1]
Top down blunt lit, cup full
Fast lane turnt, got us and off the half lane work
Throwin money while she on stage
They only know about code name champagne
But we ain't at the club. Lil act right have her actin up
I'm in a muscle car
Seven deuce cut, keep the trap tight
Never loosen up, get shit done
Call shots, something new up off the car lot
Her top off, I'm get a hard top
Pull up when that car stop

[Bridge]
All you see is, niggas having uncle whip shinin
Stuntin on these niggas
Without tryin'
Stuntin on these hoes
They know I'm buying
It's on me
We ain't hidin

[Hook]
We bring 'em out
Hot cars
Champagne with hot broads
We bring 'em out
On call
Ready to go
It won't stall

[Verse 2]
Giuseppe heels, Celine bag
Look like she hop out a Kings match
She want the real, I want the cash
She know the deal, don't get her past
I smell like O.G, sipping codein
But I never slow it down, still going O.T
Doing hard in the game like it's post-season
Ten chains on, no reason
Club life, Thug life
We brought the hoes out
So get right
Money fall out
The card swipe
Before this party
Bitch, real life
Club life, Thug life
We brought the hoes out
So get right
Money fall out

Molly and the weed tho, that’s all I gotta say
When I put my dicks in this hoes
I hope they high as me
Prolly not, fuck it, taxi all in public
Never wanna use it, prolly don’t
If she let me fuck it
Hella burnt turnt like a car going 'round the corner
Won’t change like the coin machine is fucking out of order
Never ever follow orders I make orders follow me
Riding in the ghost got me hella booze
Halloween, me and that clown, no make up
Red velvet in the sky, my cake’s up
Bitch booty sittin high, her cake’s up
2 words I can’t stand lace front
Ha, I'm playing girl you know you fly
Blow me bitch don’t blow my high, what?

Drugs, drugs, drugs

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson
Zoner, get owner, all cash pink slip, and a loaner
Need something in your mouth I’m a donor
35 racks in my cup holder
Feels for deals my voice give her the chills
I blow a kiss to molly, then she give me the thrill
It’s like a high, just can’t quit
6 in the morning, a nigga still lit
Tell them that I’m living a life you want in
You can mob, long as you understand this and do your job
Sun coming up man she still wanna ride
I don’t like shit but I still wanna drive
Moving lane to lane I got the coupe 2 stepping
Hop out like a young black Hugh Hefner
Fly, fresher, hella weed, bunch of sour on the dresser, huh?

[Hook: Problem]
Drugs, drugs, drugs
Bitch I’m on drugs, huh?
Drugs, drugs, drugs
Bitch I’m on drugs, huh?

[Verse: Berner]
Wake up in the morning, hit the kesha
Right before I head to the weed spot
I dump all 10 then I recup
My liver too shine, need a detox
Why you clear, you that’s coke and criss
I get her drunk as hell then let her choke on dick
I’m breathing slow, heart beating fast
I got cookie for days, your weed is trash
I used to be at school on the jail tab
I made a quarter mill off a meth lab
I brought a 10 pack on the grey hound
I used to be along with the grey pound
I'm on one, xans and a bottle of gyn
Throw a molly in the glass
Make her suck all my friends
Real talk no time for games
I smoke DMT and now I’m seeing thangs
I’m on drugs
Drugs, drugs, drugs[Hook: Clyde Carson]
Uh, you feeling dizzy yet?
I'm doing shit to get your pussy wet
Go time like "ready, set"

Aye, I'm in the club on a motherfucking weeknight

Bitches in the club, yeah we got options
Tryna tell us "Put the smoke out" but we ain't stopping (nah)
We ain't stopping, we ain't stopping

Shots fired, get shit popping
Another round head spinning while the DJ rocking

Right hand on the bible I'm liable to roof
And my dawg then poofed, voila! that moose

But when it got dark is when my orange grew
In that black light
It's like the ass get fatter, and the face look badder
Hey hey batter batter
Then the sex swings bat and she know it's gone
My boxers and my socks blowing little pablo
A couple shots taking back to vinyl, spinning then she got naked
Incense burning, the job writing the rules, I'm violating the coup, but not bacon
Boy I'm fresh out the oven, one of the best go discuss it
I don't stress off that rubber, she don't invest in my budget
And on the left they gon' love it, R Geezy, you beezy, it's easy

Dark room, black light, where she strip at
Hella faded seeing double

Mixed Bacardi in my soda pop

The million dollar home on a dock with the views, I'mma
Young schizo, same young flip dough
And every since I saw my deal every chick a nympho
Broke niggas krypto, Haters give me energy
I flow a lil' schizo, maniass memory
Million dollar baby, rich from the hood tough
Twenty on the piece, still up in the hood stove
Rookies I can teach, call this shit a hood show
Your homies can't compete, cus I've been giving the hood dough

[Hook]
Boy if you a baller then you know me
Girl if you a stunna then you know me
I'm living that life of a young OG
And everybody doin' that
See me doin' that
X2

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
Piece in my lap as I mob with the crew
It's mo' dough so you know how mob niggas do
I'm Dolo so you know I'm high when I cruise
I'm high when I choose, I fly when I move
High speak while I rode through the town brand new
My brother said sid top down passed through
We stop, we roll, the cops patrol
But they can't do nothing just for stuntin', let us go, got the
Town Locked up, Clique hit the block up
With every nigga in the whip shift out, rocked out
Step out, hop up, chainz on in front of me
Youngsters in the hood, on the block where the burners be
Maine got a bumbelbee, kelly yellow lambo
Famous from the dance, everybody let your hands go
Rubber band grands, pocket full of cash flow
Pimpin' I'm the man, never seen the cash low

[Hook]
Boy if you a baller then you know me
Girl if you a stunna then you know me
I'm living that life of a young OG
And everybody doin' that
See me doin' that

Drugs, drugs, bitch I’m on drugs

[Verse 1: Problem]
Molly and the weed tho, that’s all I gotta say

I hope they high as me
Prolly not, fuck it, taxi all in public
Never wanna use it, prolly don’t
If she let me fuck it
Hella burnt turnt like a car going 'round the corner
Won’t change like the coin machine is fucking out of order
Never ever follow orders I make orders follow me
Riding in the ghost got me hella booze
Halloween, me and that clown, no make up
Red velvet in the sky, my cake’s up
Bitch booty sittin high, her cake’s up
2 words I can’t stand lace front
Ha, I'm playing girl you know you fly
Blow me bitch don’t blow my high, what?

[Hook: Problem]
Drugs, drugs, drugs
Bitch I’m on drugs, huh?
Drugs, drugs, drugs
Bitch I’m on drugs, huh?

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson
Zoner, get owner, all cash pink slip, and a loaner
Need something in your mouth I’m a donor
35 racks in my cup holder
Feels for deals my voice give her the chills
I blow a kiss to molly, then she give me the thrill
It’s like a high, just can’t quit
6 in the morning, a nigga still lit
Tell them that I’m living a life you want in
You can mob, long as you understand this and do your job
Sun coming up man she still wanna ride
I don’t like shit but I still wanna drive
Moving lane to lane I got the coupe 2 stepping
Hop out like a young black Hugh Hefner
Fly, fresher, hella weed, bunch of sour on the dresser, huh?

[Hook: Problem]
Drugs, drugs, drugs
Bitch I’m on drugs, huh?
Drugs, drugs, drugs
Bitch I’m on drugs, huh?

[Verse: Berner]
Wake up in the morning, hit the kesha
Right before I head to the weed spot
I dump all 10 then I recup
My liver too shine, need a detox
Why you clear, you that’s coke and criss
I get her drunk as hell then let her choke on dick
I’m breathing slow, heart beating fast
I got cookie for days, your weed is trash
I used to be at school on the jail tab
I made a quarter mill off a meth lab
I brought a 10 pack on the grey hound
I used to be along with the grey pound
I'm on one, xans and a bottle of gyn
Throw a molly in the glass
Make her suck all my friends
Real talk no time for games
I smoke DMT and now I’m seeing thangs
I’m on drugs
Drugs, drugs, drugs[Intro: J12 (Starting Six)]
It’s J12, the dj that is, starting 6, on your bitch
Ah, tpe, saucy in this thang
Turn up, the bay is back
(Get Ghost) (Get Ghost)

[Verse 1: Big Steve]
You can call me getting ghost, I swear you can’t see me
Puffin on a big ass blunt full of sea weed
Mama on deck, got her waiting for the text
My late night thing, gotta love her for the neck
Riding round town, hella high down the 80
Slap that shit, watch your girls go crazy
It’s not what it is man, it’s really what it do
It’s a party, it’s a party, whole team coming through
You can call me getting ghost

[Verse 2: Goose]
And I’m feeling like casper, yeah there’s 50 hollows in the back
Never act up
Plus I’m freshing up, light a blunt and I’m phantom
Call me Patrick Swayze, I’m an ace baby
What’s happening, what’s packing
I’m just ghosting, yoke in the whip, blow a smoke
Looking toasted
Smoother than the smoothest, colder than the coolest
Never see me twice, stay mark, keep it moving

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
Get ghost, you move too slow, I’m invisible
Bitch I thought you knew
Tell em, get ghost, get ghost, get ghost
Get ghost, get ghost, get ghost
Argh, I’m a life between, hoes following me
I just tell em get ghost like halloween
Tell em, get ghost, get ghost, get ghost
Get ghost, get ghost, get ghost

[Verse 3]
Dala 45 ain’t fast enough, 4 new cars keep adding up
Just coped no trade in, no deal living like I made it
1000, what the fuck is that?
I made that yesterhour
Think I’m sellin product, 4 crossing on a beat
They turn it up louder
Team banging motto hollow tips for them cowards
Prada & BVC and some Louis, my whole wardrobe is a movie
Never skip a doobie, put the molly in the champagne
And watch it do the foolie
Slow down, making a mess, tearing up the streets in my brand new vet
Free my nigga PS, the original driver, yeah
But I got next

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sage The Gemini]
Ah, I’m a bay boy, with a double [?]

If you ain’t footballing I’ma fumble you
If you don’t get that mula, with me cover’s blown
She a freak yeah, freak for the freaking nature
Your man mad you freak here freaking head
Pop out cause when I’m popular, I’am pop you later
If she ain’t with the Schwarzenegger

Black money, black money yeah Obama wins
My shirts cost more than your mama get

While you, you lookin like the opposite
Ah, get ghost like after hours

Might fuck her even after powers
I fuck her hour until she British bitch I’m Austin Powers

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I’m with the 6, ho you better get
Ghost, giving them haters goose bumps with my cold flows
We in the traffic, with the doors, open swanging
Getting her wet and banging
And the hoes line up when I ride through the [?]
Eyes hella low and I ain’t talking bout Chinese
Finna walk on the game, watch my shoes break the concrete
Finna hit hard, real hard like boxing

[Verse 6]
Speakers turnt doing donuts in your residence
Black tenants, I be riding like the president
And she really nasty than every nigga I know can hit
Smash it than I vanish, 50 soldiers like a magic trick
You can get a couple of friends, and y’all can fuck with us
And you can get the fuck out the hotel and catch the bus
I put it on ya, then shot glasses pass to the corner
Then come back round it’s like karma

[Hook][Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
I pull up to the store, the bottle’s on me
The functions and foe, I know we gonn see
Yeah, ice with chicks we can holler at
Know I wanna meet
Just don’t forget the ice, pour one up for me
Yeah, sip a little drank, I sip a little more
Yeah, the feeling feel good, I turn it up slow
Aight, I’m riding with my niggas, I’m riding with my folks
Yeah we rolling some up, I like it, another day off
Sipping on that

[Hook]
Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup
Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup

Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup
Yeah we at the function, bad bitches I see a bunch of them
I see my partners here, gonn have lunch with em
We still barbeque, I stay in touch with them
I hit the ladies, and greatest of what’s been up
Laugh out the past while we twist one up
See you staring while I fix this up
Wave you to me while I mix my cup
Yeah, I’m checking out your style, you focused on me
Ah, I’m checking out your style, I like what I see
Yeah, alright, I’m feeling alright, we off some good tree
You want what I got, alright, let’s make another drink

[Hook]
Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup
Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup
Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup
Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
There’s something about, hands up if you drinking with me
That takes me so high, sipping yak aight daddy can’t move
There’s something about, hands up if you drinking with me
That I can do nothing
That’s right, I can’t leave

[Hook]
Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup
Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup
Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup
Henny in my red cup, henny in my red cup

I ain't doing too much, just had 3 cups
This around the time I get on
I ain't doing too much, just had 3 cups
This around the time I get on

There’s something about you
That takes me so high
There’s something about
That I can’t deny[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
Call me the dopest, or just say the flow is
Too much for the world, the pearl diamond of Oakland
The movement of your girl when she curled off of the potion
Maybe it's the way that she twirls, you love the motion
It's really not a challenge for me, it's hocus pocus; magic
Poof, the shit you can get from rapping
The feeling of "I made it", yeah, sometimes I have it
I wouldn't even call this work, it's more like practice
More of a habit, easy as acting
Playing the role with passion, I'm catching what you been lacking
I MC for a living, 1, 2, I make it happen
Brain on drugs, the egg I've been cracking
They been asking, so I let em see it
Look what I did, they telling me that they need it
Right now I'm living it, right now you dreaming
Right now I'm killing it, it's beautiful, can't you see it?

[Hook: Goapele]
Plant a seed, watch it grow
Water, sun, lie and flow
You got it so, so
Plant a seed, watch it grow
Water, sun, lie and flow
You got it so, so

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
Call me your favourite, maybe I was made for it
Well, who knows so the moment might as well savor it
I went from hungry to food from all the catering
And have to blow these bitches fake kisses, maybe it's Maybeline
They same my name is King Crunk Clyde Carson
Switching the flow from every style you start with
They try to follow like the cycles walking through darkness
If I don't speak then they don't eat, so what would you call this?
Maybe a blessing, maybe a lesson
Class on class, don't get it then keep guessing
Picasso on the paintings, you niggas is just sketching
I ain't even got started my nigga, I'm just stretching
So come test em, I promise you fasho
To write, cut the records and cut the flow
See I bust records, you know how I let it go
The sickest shit you heard, it's beautiful, ain't it though?

[Hook: Goapele]

[Verse 3: Clyde Carson]
Call me the bestest, obvious I'm the freshest
Talk of the town, the crown, I accept it
The greatest of the greatest, I'm proud they respect it
And how I mix that hood shit with the sounds, that's eclectic
Hieroglyphics, style is prolific
So casual, style is so mischief
I let them pass it down, now I'm so gifted
Just addicted to the life that I found with no vision
Eyes closed it, standing behind the cop stopper
Middle of the East where them cops is ducking the choppers
I could, see the birth of my window, they in that chopper watching
Any lil' nigga that's busting eyes on the block and clocking
I got it popping, first with The Team
Respect ain't really coming 'till the juice at the scene
They been waiting for the solo, know I came for the ring
I'm just a young mobile moving, ain't it beautiful man?

[Hook: Goapele]Got a bar in my living room
Just in case I gotta get more into you
But knocking on my hoes, in this world I do my interviews
Did I mention that I sent a few young magnificent with tree on deck
Slap on the slash but we on next

Kill shit, leave the track D.O.A
Some peach sirock or prolly some pink rose

[Hook]
Won't get far on hating shit
You never get far
Let's move forward on some player shit
Meet me by the bar
Pour up, pour up, pour up
Pour up some drank for me
Roll up, roll up now
Roll up some purp for me

Late night with your bottom bitch
Out of pocket and she just acknowledged it
Every conversation she has, I'm the top again
Bout time we holler then fall through the bill
Right on time, diamonds in my watch and on my right arm
Maybe jordans or louis vuitton
I'm feeling important, life of a don

[Hook]

On the case getting sideways
Loaded on the highway, got out from the club
Now we headed my driveway
Bout to have it my way, 4 in the morning we still on
After this shit she don't wanna go back home
Moving, never alone, I gotta sell em a dream, I can't sell my soul

[Hook][Hook]
Pour up pour up pour up, pour up some drank with me
Roll up Roll up now, Roll up some dank with me

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
It’s the motherfucking world nigga
Avion everywhere
Champagne extravaganza
If you fuck niggas askin' them questions I got answers
Big booty, red bone look like a dancer
The way a nigga blowing that strong, might have cancer
Drop no top baby chemo
City round  my waist cost a kilo
Same coupe different color, call it CeeLo
Bad Mexicana out west, she call me primo
She know I keep my shooters with me never solo
Said she love the way I kick it like a cholo
Choppers layin' all around the mental like the navy
I don't know about this rap shit this motherfucker crazy
Pop 20 bottles of Rose by the pool nigger
Niggas  at the gate where they ours and  they a fool nigger
Do this shit till the sun set nigger
South Central to Sunset nigger
Mission Impossible, yeah  Tom Cruise shit
100 Thousand metric tons, nigger fill a cruise ship
I'm like fuck it, two Glocks in a bucket
Let my little niggas handle that think nothing of it
I'm wondering what you niggas is claiming, just throw it up
And I don't know what these bitches is drinking just pour it up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
Got some broads in my living room
More up on the way don’t get offended boo
Ciroc in the cabana if you hot then get up in the pool
Got her kickin' off her tennis shoes
Young Magnificent with tree on deck
Acting innocent till she take that sip
Dom Perignon and some Pinot gris
Peach Ciroc and probably some pink rozay
Won’t get far on that hatin' shit
Bucket of some ice on some Ace of Spades
Gangsta remix Young Jeez and Game
Young Clyde Carson you don’t know the name
We getting high on the west coast, west coast, west coast
Got the best smoke, dollars like Creflo
Let my [chest?] pour, Hennie in my red cup just a play boy
Bottles up let’s pour

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
They call me Disco Chuck
If I pull the Lamborghini out, a bitch gon' fuck
Gas speed up gas speed up
Disrespect one of my niggas get your ass beat up
Diamond like 10, great J's feet up
Nigga out of ace tell they ass re-up
We up where the clouds and the [lids?] be
G6s playing for the RiRis
I tell a bitch back it up beep beep
She said chuck slow it down, skeet skeet
She want the D
So I politely just come in her weave
She don't want to leave, roll up the tree
She want a nigga to break of the leaves
She want the keys
Nada baby, remind me of Eve, Ruff Ryder baby

[Hook]

[Outro]
Delete all that shit! Delete all that shit! I'm not playing with you Peggy!!
Delete all that shit! Delete all that shit! I'm not playing with you Peggy!![Hook]x2

You know a nigga state to state
On a dolo mission I got a date with the cake
Wide awoke, 3 A.M
Prolly touch down when the sun come in
Ay, when them guards hit the gate I be tired as fuck after that 8-hour race
I come from the land where we swing our cars
Figure 8 Benz concrete leave marks
Call it paid, super-charged
Back to back race the Benz with the four door Porsche
I'm tearin' up tires in this luxury
Hella smoke says she wanna fuck with me
Money on my mind ain't nothin' for free
Tryna keep up with me but it's nothin' to me

[Hook]x2

[Verse 2: Kaz Kyzah]
(I tell 'em)
Slow down, you know you can't catch me

Wet than a motha fucka whip like a jet ski
Ride like Presley, pills like Graceland
They wanna ship me to Rita and off to reception
Nah, ain't tryna see the state pen
I'm Black Scaled out in my Ray-Bans
Diamond-certified, I ain't neva lied
I ain't had L's since Pac died
Ridin' through the biters, couple bundles talkin' bout sliders
Run from the labors, mind's still swift
FedEx movement all on the bitch
Audi with the stash box, Cazzy too swift
No frontin' push a button give a nigga that...gift

[Hook]x2

[Verse 3: Mayne Mannish]

Ridin' like Tony Stewart smashin' through a two-way
Doin' bout a hundred kinda burnin' up the Lou-ie
Lou-ie, Louie 13th motha fucka yeah Louie
D.U.I. drivin black Henny on my lap
Pedal to the flo' with a 808 clap
Money motivated doin' sprints when I'm chasin'
And it gotta be a hemi I don't normally do the basic
Six-cylinder, r-really bruh? Slow it down, keep up
And I'm killin' ya, hope I'm not offendin' ya
See you at the finish line, leavin' em

Burn rubba, bu-burn rubba

[Hook]x2[E-A-Ski talking]
Hell yeah...
E-A-Ski, CMT track...ha ha ha
Yeah Bullys Wit Fullys part 3
Messy Marv, Guce, Fillmoe', Hunters Point, it don't stop, let's go

[Verse 1: Messy Marv]
I'm switchin' lanes with them stunnas on my face
Chop in the trunk, wally on my waist
Back in the game nigga feelin' like Mase
Red J Jonas with the red shoe lace
Deuces on the load, rocks in my load
The ice in my mouth keep my Nextel froze
Have you ever seen a scrape with the Lamborghini doors
Bitch I thizz and play with my nose

[Guce]
The girls, the girls they love me
It's the project lover
But I'm gang banger, and a drug smuggler
Gucey Guce, dope boy with the cake mix
I'm naked with it in the kitchen doin' late shift
See I been bout it, other niggas rap about it
If you got it cuz, then blood better ask about it
We in the drama, bangin' the hammers, orangutans
Goin' bananas in the game, throwin' up the gang

[Clyde Carson - Chorus:]
When I roll up, streets show love
I just wanna be on the block with my thugs
I just wanna sit in the drop on my dubs
Open up the doors and turn the beat up, cause
I'm from the ghetto baby, I'm from the hood
When in my ghetto baby, I know I'm good

[Verse 2: Messy Marv]
These niggas got toolies but that ain't no heat
I'll slap one of you niggas like a E-A-Ski beat
I had these Girbauds on full bout a week
Ya boy look grimy but the money look sweet
You got me fucked up, bitch this the Bay
Me and every niggas do this shit all day
I'll lay everybody down in the room
But whatever I do I'mma stay a tycoon

[Guce]
Aaaa....
What you know bout bricks and traps
Bullys Wit Fullys is a gang in all black and strapped
I'm not a rapper, I'm a street nigga
I'm so hungry with this heat tryin' to eat nigga
Real talk we in this bitch buyin' out the bar
Talk shit I'll make this cold iron hot to yo jaw
Represent gangstas, two step hustlers
Hands in the air you gettin' cookies on sight

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Messy Marv]
Stunna on mine, and all on a ho
Richmond, Vallejo, the City, and the O
Gang dog Blood, oh what you didn't know
Good weed in my mouth, mac on the floor
You ridin' with a star, bitch feelin' like whoa
She feelin' like stay but I'm feelin' like go
And I ain't got nothin' against the new bay
I used to ride through with Fab nigga back in the day

[Guce]
You already know Bullys Wit Fullys is so hood
Guce and Tay now we got Mess, the nigga so hood
Pill Music got you sort of like some wet wet
You in the club gang bangin' throwin' up ya set
Me and Mess dog runnin' the game
600 back to back dog huggin' the lane
Yeah this .50 Cal., make it worth ya while
Everybody goin' dumb off a half of pound

[Hook][Verse 1: The Game]
I'm Huey P. Newton with Air Force One’s on
Doctor Martin Luther King with two guns on
I'm one zone short of a break
One chronic blunt away from a classic
I'm a motherfucking bastard... literally
I let my lyrics overflow on the page
Until they spill on the beat
I do what you niggas can’t
I am what you niggas ain’t
You say you an artist motherfucker then paint...
That’s the base line
The motivation for Jamie to play rape line...
I paint pictures in my mind
Imagine who dead if I see a flat line
You niggas ain’t like me
And it's likely that I'm Spike Lee in some coke white Nikes
At the Knicks game with my legs crossed like a boss
How a nigga from Compton become the talk of New York?

[Hook]
We been broke so long it’s so hard
Hiding from behind my scars
That's something to just think about...
It was no dope, just hope in my heart
Tired of reaching for the stars
Now, I'm something you can speak about

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
Look into my eyes, ain't too much I ain't seen
Except death and the penitentiary gates leave...
My mark on the world 'fore I cut
The artist homie spoken with the potenent brush
Paint a picture of a world made up
I try to be different but I'm just like them
Fairy tales and fantasies of made up jims
I never went as far as rocking fake ones still...
The pressures of life, if that’s the career
To say what they want, and not what you feel
What's inside your soul is uncomfortable fear
To let it out the only way you be clear
Ain't been in a Lear
But you can bet I rapped about it
So far life good without it
Strive for what's great though the hood is grounded
And punishment can’t leave the block but I’m bouncing

[Hook]
We been broke so long it’s so hard
Hiding from behind my scars
That's something to just think about...
It was no dope just hope in my heart
Tired of reaching for the stars
Now, I'm something you can speak about

[Verse 3: Clyde Carson]
Aye homie I’m just talking my shit
Everyday hustle I’m just authoring hits
Scorsese penned last puff then flick
Light up and let the world hear this
Sharp as the guitar that plays in the background
Torn as the baton that’s passed from the playground
Youngen with the slick tongue thugin'
Years later, opened up the oven
Years later, who knew that they love me
And thank me for everyday hustling
Consider me the king but I act like I don’t want it
Lab rat, elaborate, rapping performance, stage is enormous
Doing my gig
Feeling myself like Mac D.R.E
We be the best like Fat Joe dj
The ghetto to a multi-mil estate to know that...

[Hook]
We been broke so long it’s so hard
Hiding from behind my scars
Now, that's something to just think about...
It was no dope just hope in my heart
Tired of reaching for the stars
Now, I'm something you can speak about

[Outro][Hook: Clyde Carson]
Uh, you feeling dizzy yet?
I'm doing shit to get your pussy wet
Go time like "ready, set"
So go ahead and take it to the neck (all this dick)
Take it to the neck (all this liquor)
Take it to the neck (all this dick)
Take it to the neck (all this liquor)
Take it to the neck (all this dick)
Take it to the neck (all this liquor)
Take it to the neck (all this dick)
Take it to the neck (all this liquor)
Take it to the neck

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
Aye, I'm in the club on a motherfucking weeknight
Going up, shit jumping, ain't a weak night
Stupid on the floor, she shaking it in the V.I
Can't recognize these real niggas then she blind (she blind)
Pockets super sized, give my coupe a try
I copped a newer ride cause my gouda high
Sold my old benz for the newest fire
But still po pimpin' like im do or die
Boppers jocking, bottles poppings
We got cribs to go to, with numbers locked in
Bitches in the club, yeah we got options
Tryna tell us "Put the smoke out" but we ain't stopping (nah)
We ain't stopping, we ain't stopping
Tell us "Put the smoke out" but we ain't stopping
Shots fired, get shit popping
Another round head spinning while the DJ rocking
I'm saying

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
Ok, ready set
I took you on a date, is you ready yet?
Steady saying "No" but yo pussy wet
Niggas stealing my swag, that's petty theft
Do I, got next? Is yo pussy fat?
You let all yo homies hit now yo pussy wack
Little henny in her system, have her sucking
I ain't a snitch so I ain't saying nothing
Uh, "I can give it to ya but what you gonna do with it?"
Bust it open for me, I'mma act a fool in it
Is the, inside of your pussy pink?
Bust a nut then wash my dick off in the sink
Girl, I'm with the bullshit baby
I be slanging dick like crack in the 80's
And if the homie Ace ain't here
Girl put it in my face, let me taste that shit

[Hook][Verse 1: Mann]

Girl I see you looking you should say something
They play my shit and it's bound to get this whole place jumping
Out of nothing I made something A1 since day 1
Got my cake up I got a gang of hundreds
And I ain't fronting/ but don't say nothing/
Low key smooth as David Ruffin
Master cheffin don't ask no questions
O.G. we stay puffing coconut ciroc that's the beverage
Turned up since my adolescence
This my job no past professions
I see your body that's perfection
I chose you that's a blessing
VIP baby that's the section
But I think we should dip out together
Fuck a club I'm trying to get to know you
Smoke some Kush in this Cali weather
Got that maro with the top back
Feel like I'm in a 6'4 really on my shit tho
Young nigga What it hit for

[Hook: Mann]

Bring the weed get the drink set the vibe and find the bounce
You with me what you thank I like mine in large amounts
I got cheese in the bank I'm living life that's all that counts
Get high while I'm riding round know how I get  down
She like my style like the way I get down

[Verse: Clyde Carson]

You got the drop top I got the hard top
She gotta soft ass I gotta hard cock
Living too fast like Im 2Pac
Make a splash in her juice box
In my box Chevorlet
In the middle of the hills of beverly
Wanna lay down, Imma have you face down
Pill got you feeling heavenly
In the stars lost trying to find control
Cuhz I fuck you like I just got parole
Got you, taking off your clothes
When we done you you can't find your drawls every time huh
Sheets are designer and we in between them word to Isleys
Call me Mr Big dick straight like a line up so go ahead climb up
Puff puff pass after the fact she just want some more weed
Liking what we just had and she just want some more weed
Puff puff pass after the fact she just want some more weed
She got friends tell her bring something they can't just kick it for free

[End][Hook]
3 hunnid thousands in the tuck spot
But I ride around like Im broke ho
These bitches on my nuts now
Cause they know a nigga getting more dough

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
Stupid mainy hella saucey from the trap
Must have blew her mind soon as she heard a nigga back
I slid through the spot already gone off yak
Half a bottle in my pocket aint no act, nigga
My folks was driving, hoes was hiding
When they seen that s5 pull up beside em
Run off and stay in pocket like a real bitch
The P is in my swag, can you feel it
I step up in the joint let the hoes get on me
Turn the party off whenever team performing
I pull off in foreign I might squat the limit
Have to see my house to see how Im living
Its bout, its bout

[Hook: Clyde Carson x2]
3 hunnid thousands in the tuck spot
But I ride around like Im broke ho
These bitches on my nuts now
Cause they know a nigga getting more dough

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
Boss mac-ing looking like a ball player
Got a mansion on a golf course by the lake I look out
Type of pad make your bitch panties drop come in
Get amazed, get some head, get some dick and get out
A little conversation figured I was broke
Aint know her favorite song is the song I wrote
Aint even gotta stunt, no jewelry on
Rather blow her mind when I bring her home
Fuck her on the couch, fucking up the head board
Let her fly me out, take me to the airport
Walking round broke, rare form
Old whip, but I got some new jordan, whoop out!

[Hook: Clyde Carson x2]
3 hunnid thousands in the tuck spot
But I ride around like Im broke ho
These bitches on my nuts now
Cause they know a nigga getting more dough

[Verse 3: Clyde Carson]
Another million in the attic, money Im an addict
Dont follow her around cause my shit on automatic
R.A. sticks shift porsche automatic
If they knew how much I have, then they prolly need a medic
Stay on under but niggas know Im big whipping
I slide through the block with my new shit sitting
Sitting, sitting, new bitch sitting for a stand up nigga
So that new bitch sitting
3 in the morning aint disappointed, my bitch the truth
Just likes to join her it aint no loot, it aint important
Im eating good, but living normal, whoop out!
