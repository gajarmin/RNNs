[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip Hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars driving slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned, styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is coming look around your town is crumbling
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leaving MCs listless
On the Wake Up Show, make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher, partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9ne's vilde!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house through the front window
And heard this guy shout, "Hey that's my couch"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm ripping this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flipping vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breaking so many freaking needles, I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake Up
The X-Man, catch me doing drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting from high noon till the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was, when I cut ya neck
Leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon and spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinning like lead from out the  Heck and K
Tearing your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate
Until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to but what you gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you but what you gon' do
Rev can give it to you but what you gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fucking up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style foul file sexual harassment like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fucking murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show repping with Sway and Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One coming with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willing to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willing to bet, on a Sway and a Tec, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gaining respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just seckle
Ha-ha-ha, fresh for 1999 you suckersThe time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Champagne wishes and caviar dreams a team that's gettin' cream
With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin' the life of Riley packin' fifty calis
Rockin lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count math from steam baths
We've seen a half a milli dashin out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin papers by the layers
And those that betray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used as shootin targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
That'll straight pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin straight charming in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots come through a whole army
The cee-lo rollers, money folders, sippin' Bolla, holdin mad payola
Slangin that Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game we do our thing son

[Chorus (x2)]
Livin' the Fast Life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American Dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven figure cream

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo I got, guns from Italy, smoke trees, considerably
Mid-state and Green it seems, is where all my niggas be
The ghetto misery, shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular, angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lexo but who's petro
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin Cristal like it's my first child, lickin shots, holiday style
Rockin Steele sweaters, Wallabee down
Twenty-four carats, countin cabbage, like the arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin Guinness shootin catchin cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys
The Luciano, Frankie Yale, Bugsy Siegel
Green papers with eagles from a trade that's illegal

*singer* Brother you've got to make it happen
Yeahhhahhyeahhh, get this money, yeahhh
Brother you've got to make it happen
When you're living in the fast life, heyy yeah yeah

[Verse 3: G Rap & Nas]
[Rap] Aiyyo my lifestyle's exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
[Nas] Esquire attire standin on ground with one pivot
[Rap] Two players rockin silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
[Nas] Lands with namebrand seats reclinin like in spaceships
[Rap] Bodies on ice
[Nas] Livin trife, rollin fixed up dice
[Rap] Gamblin Grants
[Nas] Handlin stamps
[Duo] Moves are sheist
[Nas] My bankrolls, got the cops comin in plain clothes
[Rap] Tryin to arraign again cause of our fame that's how the game goes
[Nas] True
[Rap] Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin up grams with Arm & Hammer supplyin scramblers in Alabama
[Nas] Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin us Dom P my cliquo
Dimes with magnifico, puttin' in cut inside perico
Heat for foes, shoppin sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Carribean suites, deep, rippin beats with flows
[Rap] Aiyyo, we went from standin on blocks, without some socks
Sellin rocks, to pickin up stock and boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin all the blue steel we keeps it real inside the battlefield
[Nas] Yeah so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

[Chorus]

*singer does same part again with variations to fade, mostly "I" for "you*[Masta Ace]
Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off then, I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can lift your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital "A" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like Crusoe
Sleep if ya wanna, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm
Next up (Yo, I believe that's me)
Craig G, light up the mic for the Symphony

[Craig G]
This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, cuz now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on the tip when you heard me and the Juice Crew
You said, "Mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo Craig, I heard you in that jam, and it's pumpin'!
I apologize. Oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?"
That's how I'm livin': on surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
Cuz if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, cuz on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up...(Yo, I believe that's me)
Kool G Rap, light up the mic for the Symphony

[Kool G. Rap]
Yo, Marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When G Rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
That make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and wanna sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's death
Makin' veterans run for medicine
Cuz I put out more lights in a fight than Con Edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
So if you want rage, I'mma make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, todays the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though. Solo. Cuz you're still all...soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than Brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me
Bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me -- I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Serve the sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, G Rap wrecks, he's rated X, that means the boy is sex. Next
The amplifier gets used and abused. Pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang a
Rapper or singer: I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up... (I believe that's me)
Big Daddy Kane, get on the mic for the Symphony

[Big Daddy Kane]
Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord;
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear -- then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
Cause rockin' a party? Yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution. I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kicked it
Cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, cause Daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to your health
So put a quarter in your ass, cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade. You need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that Allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun; on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
Cause when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, emcees, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge. Don't barge, cause goddamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant. You're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin'. So put Kane in, that category. Period. End of story[Voices]

You be careful crossin the street
Hey mister, you forgot your things, hey mister

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
I got a job with the mob, makin g’s
Doin some pickups, deliveries and transportin keys
Yeah they got me like a flunkie money
I’m drivin' around with ten kilos inside my trunk g
And I’m holdin the suitcase
With a half a million dollars on my lap in front of my face
And I’m tryin to ignore it
But sometimes I get tempted to go dip and make a run for it
The thought alone makes me shiver, damn
What if I get caught? they’ll find me floatin in the hudson river
But if I escape, I’ll be in shape for my life
But they might, get my kid and my wife
See I’m supposed to make a stop
To an uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop
But I got somethin else in mind
So at the next stop sign I pull out and load up the nine
I got the money and the hit
Went through the brook nonstop cause I ain’t droppin off a block of it
Then I thought of a plan
So I drove to my house and got my girl and my little man
C’mon baby, pack your stuff, get ready
Damn, why your face all sweaty?
Just hurry up, don't throw no fits
I’m a dead man walking, understand, we gotta split
I switched the locks on the door
Started packin gucci bags like I was goin on a world tour
Grabbed the luggage and the gun
C’mon we gotta go, you gotta brother on the run

[Hook: Mobsters talking]
Mobster: They gotta the shipment
Don: What?
Mobster: They got the whole shipment
Don: I want that son of a bitch dead, I don't care....

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
Now I’m drivin and I’m lookin at my passport
I’m outta here soon as I hit Kennedy Airport
Loaded the other automatic
I don’t believe this, I'm like a sitting duck stuck in traffic
I’m gettin nervous as hell g
A lincoln continental pullin right up beside me
Puts down my girl and then I bent low
Bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the guinea's back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin crazy mafia members in the neck
Looked at my girl, a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain’t givin up nothin my brother
Hit me rollin up in trenches
Sprayin at my car, only missin me by little inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my girl is harmed?
Man they only hit her in the upper arm
Now I’m drivin off sidewalks, makin sharp turns
My son is in the back catching heartburns
I got the car shakin' wildly
I made a turn, and then I then I ditched the bimmer in a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin stuff is done
Yeah they got a brother on the run

[Hook: Mobsters Talking]
Don: I want Him dead!
I want his family dead!
I want his house burnt to the ground!

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin with the engine running all night
I started pullin on my ho
What man what? wake up stupid, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I’m headin south no doubt
Don’t care about my whereabouts, as long it’s a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That’s when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin' me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my girl she started cryin, my finger on the trigger
Pulled it- bullets started flyin
Now I’m hittin all them bastards
I’m droppin em fast, while I blast the blood splashes
Then I finally done it
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I’m lookin for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
Catchin' breath the only one left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up on the sucker
Put my gun to his head, whassup now motherfucker?
He said, wait, I want to talk
(three gunshots) I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil’s gun
Now they no longer got a brother on the run[Verse 1]
When I was five years old I realized there was a road
At the end I will win lots of pots of gold
Never took a break, never made a mistake
Took time to create cause there's money to make
To be a billionaire takes hard work for years
Some nights I shed a tear while I said a prayer
Been through hard times, even worked part time
In a Key Food store sweeping floors sometimes
I was sort of a porter taking the next man's orders
Breaking my back for a shack from headquarters
All my manpower for four bucks an hour
Took my time and wrote rhymes in the shower
Shoes are scuffed cause the road gets rough
But I'mma rock it cause my pockets ain't stuffed enough
All the freaks wouldn't speak cause my checks were weak
They would turn the other cheek so I started to seek
A way to get a play, and maybe one day
I'll be performing up a storm for a decent pay
No matter how it seems, I always kept the dream
All the girlies screamed and suckers get creamed
Dreamed about it for five years straight
Finally I got a break to cut my first plate
The road ain't yellow and it ain't no witches
My name is Kool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches

[Verse 2]
I used to stand on the block selling cooked up rock
Money busting out my sock cos I really would clock
They were for kind of fiends bringing jackets and jeans
Magazines, anything, just to hustle up beans
The cash was coming fast, money grew like grass
People hungry for the blast that don't even last
Didn't want to be involved but the money will get ya
Gettin richer and richer, the police took my picture
But I still supplied, some people I knew died
Murders and homicides for bottles of suicide
Money, jewelry, living like a star
And I wasn't too far from a Jaguar car
In a small-time casino, the town's Al Pacino
For all of the girls, the pretty boy Valentino
I shot up stores and I kicked down doors
Collected scars from little neighborhood wars
Many legs I broke, many necks I choked
And if provoked I let the pistol smoke
Loyal members in a crew now down with the game
Selling nickels and dimes in sunshine or rain
What I had was bad from my shoes to my pad
In the first time in my life loaning money to dad
Now the table's turned and my lifestyle switches
My name is Kool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches

[Verse 3]
A thug will mugs for drugs, he eventually bugs
Looking for crack on carpets and rugs
The squealers tells but the dealer still sells
Little spoiled kids inheriting oil wells
I was the type on the opposite side
Of smoking the pipe, in a beef I got hype
Cause rags to riches switches men to witches
Become stitches, body bags in ditches
Bloodshed, I painted the town red
People fled as I put a dread's head to bed
That means dead, in other words deceased
Face got erased, bullets got released
Bombs were planted and kids were kidnapped
In fact this was a way to get back
At enemies who tried to clock G's
On my block, now they forever knock Z's
Plans of rampages went for ages
Some got knocked and locked inside cages
Some bit the dust for crumbs and crusts
In God we trust, now rots to rust
Bust caps to cops, policeman drops
You blew off his top when the pistol went pop
Troopers, soldiers, rolling like boulders
Eyes of hate and their hearts get colder
Some young male put in jail
His lawyer so good his bail is on sale
Looking at the hourglass, how long can this power last
Longer than my song but he already fell
He likes to eat hearty, party
Be like John Gotti, and drive a Maserati
Rough in the ghetto, but in jail he's Jello
Mellow, yellow fellow, tell or hell, hello
One court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate
But just stay, ship him upstate by the Great Lakes
And than a-wait and wait and wait
Until he breaks, that's all it takes
So he fakes to be a man, but he can't stand
On his own two feet because now he's in a new land
Rules are different and so is life
When you think with a shank, talk with a knife
Not my lifestyle so I made a U-turn
More money I earn, more money to burn
Pushing all buttons, pulling all switches
My name is G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches[Kool G. Rap]
You know the Don's armed with sixteen
And I do harm for this big cream, the whips and the carriage
Ball like the Knicks and the Mavericks, slipping the fabrics
Pull up wit some big shit, lieutenant shit, hitting the hazards
Spot a bitch wit that Cris habit, gotta have it
Fuck shorty and send her OT wit a brick in her baggage
Roll where the clubs at slip for the rabbit
Trick only lick dick status to get cabbage
She get lathered to the dick baptist
Who back on the map? Giancana wit a vengeance
It's drama to the finish, put the Llama to your appendix
And squeezing the slugs, gun powder season your blood
I'm a legend breathing, the reason you thug (nigga)
This where the buck stops, fuck props
Buck shots at the top money, what the fuck you forgot?
Thought I was done and wasn't touching the block?
Still real, busting the Glock
Put up and you can see it (blaow) what up now?

(Chorus)
"I'll exile barbarian style like an executor"
Wanna test Vinnie Paz man (Jedi Mind Tricks)
Enforce the moves on fools
[?] I'm invincible

[Mike Tyson]
Everybody talks and they like I'm losing my head, I'm losing confidence and that I'm talking loud and vulgar
I'm talking vulgar because I'm angry at what I've experienced all my years through this and I'm just angry!
Everyone else has the right to be angry too but that's just how I express myself

[Vinnie Paz]
Yo, bust a motherfucking gat to this
Y'all believe lies like y'all was Catholics
I rap in Arabic, so my message is just immaculate
My rap elaborate, drink a forty and blaze a sack to it
My aim is accurate, take your brain and blow out the back of it
I'm salty, miserable cat that slap shorties
Looks kinda resemble that, a fat Pauly
I don't even clap, young boy, he claps for me
Chain hang down to my dick, I'm that gaudy
I don't even fuck wit you cats, you rap poorly
I don't even buck at you cats, you that corny
Wit a wack army, we barkin' at you
And Vinnie Paz holds a hammer like a carpenter do
You should understand that I ain't really fuckin' around
And if you don't, you gonna find your body stuffed in the ground
We buckin' em down, cuz that's how wrong my life is
Y'all don't overstand how fuckin' strong my wife is
I'm from a time where every song was righteous
Before rap was just a swarm of white kids
And y'all a witness to the dawn of hypeness
Or just another victim to the pawns and sheisters
I'll feed your corpse to a swarm of vipers
Let em suck the blood till your form is lifeless
What! Fuckin' Vinnie Paz daddy! Jedi Mind Tricks! (Yeah!)

(Chorus)[Kool G. Rap]
Last week I beat my bitch up in the street for lyin to me
She thought she caught a cutie but didn't know the nigga knew me
He said he had but one or two affairs with the booga bear
All a nigga could do was try to act like he don't fuckin care
I was about to drop the hammer on this nigga
Till grip pulled out his wallet and he had my bitch's pictures
That undercover lover bullshit was now discovered
Can't wait to see this bitch cause I'mma beat her ass in public
I went to her sister's house, drove by her momma's
I even stepped to poppa duke's house to bring the drama
Lookin up the block, yeah hold up, yeah there goes that bitch
From a mile away yo I could tell my bitch is switched
So I ran up on her, hey wassup bitch I got a question
If your lot of Smith & Wessons gonna teach ya ass a lesson
You ever fucked around on me before? "Hell no!" *smack*
"Yo what you hit me with that gun for?"
Bitch why you lyin, bitch you've been cheatin
Now I gotsa to give your motherfuckin ass a beatin
I punched her in the ribcage and kicked her in the stomach
Take off all my motherfuckin jewellery, bitch runnin
I stomped her and I kicked her and I punched her in the face
Some people crowded around but nobody got out of place
Don't want heroics, "Hey buddy" - aiyyo money don't get in this
"Hey miss you alright?" - motherfucker mind your business!
I'm bashin her with the nine, inches away from pullin the trigger
But a nigga got to hit her till I see her face get bigger
I'm sick of all the bullshit, tired of all the nonsense
So I pistol whipped the bitch till her ass fell out of conscious
Now she's all bloodied up, layin in that red shit
Bitch press charges, I guarantee you she's a dead bitch
The first time you play me is your last
So yo don't interrupt me when I'm whoopin on my bitch ass

[Chorus]
"Hey mister mister, what the fuck you doin?"
"Hey mister mister" - keep walking past!
"Hey mister mister, what the fuck you doin?"
Don't interrupt me when I'm whoopin on my bitch ass!

[Kool G. Rap]
I'm baggin up mad shit, puttin it on the street
I never snorted but I find myself shorted every weekend
Shit is disappearin and I'm lookin for the logic
Of why my shit gets lower every time I count the profit
It never fails again, these bitches drawers they go back up
One hundred here, two hundred here, but all that shit adds up
So I'm layin for the traitor
So I can put foot in they ass cause I'm a motherfucking bitch hater!
So I'm peepin out the spot for a week
If I catch one of these bitches stashin bread she'll be dead meat
I took one to the bath and tried to knock it
Feelin on her ass, hey yo bitch what's this in your pocket?
Aha finally caught your ass!
The bitch had my cash, I rolled up inside her stash
She started coppin a plea but I ain't really tryin to hear her
I snatched her by her hand, bashed her face up in the mirror
I threw her right on the ground and then her skirt revealed her panties
Now a nigga's ready to shove his dick up in her fanny
I hit the bitch like one more time and then I just said fuck it
Pulled my zipper down, whipped out my dick and made her suck it
I'm rammin my dick inside of her mouth and tryin to make her choke
Then I grabbed the back of her head and shot come down her throat
I beat her and I dissed the bitch for tryin to steal my cash
So yo don't interrupt me when I'm whoopin on my bitch ass

[Chorus 2X][Kool G Rap]
Fo'-fo' calibre spit game, you know?
KGR, Giacana, Queens runnin things you know?
Know it!

[Verse 1]
Any nigga crazy enough to take G for a joke
I don't know about your flow but I'mma see that you float
Cause I don't waste my time beefing with dopes, the heat smokes
Only microphone niggas speaking to me on this rope
Get some hood bitches to point out where you and your ho live
A crack head can even MAC 11 your whole crib
Get twenty holes in your wig from eleven-year-old kids
Only twenty-two when they come from eleven-year-old bids
Find out ya racin to the 5-0 station
Got a Jake on a payroll to give your location
I'mma shove a machete inside your ass like Jason
End up a fresh nig' buried in the basement
That's how we movin, got killers from other coasts
Give some pennies to wire whips with explosives
We okay niggas to death at high doses
Columbian necktie, nigga you closest

[Hook] {X2}
You know it's trouble when the Click come around here
Shit that we totin, gotta get from the sound here
Whoever want it on your script, gun 'em down
Spin your whips, Hummers round with a swift hundred rounds, yeah

[Verse 2]
Give two of them things to a frame in armour
Razor blade a nigga face like he came from Uganda
Run in your shit aiming the llamas, while your dame in pyjamas
Then you watch while niggas banging her posture
All we want is them C-notes, that bundle of dope
You can play hero and die, try to rumble with toasters
Just be easy baby boy, it only take us a minute
Got a bag of yay, some pussy and some cake to split it
Cross right over your line nigga we take the scrimmage
Keep the stones and the jewellery blue as the face on the grimace
New York State menace with eight's by the appendix
No lactose in it, get raw freight from the chemist

[Hook] {X2}

[Outro] {X2}
Stop acting like you ain't know me, you know my name yo
Stop acting like you don't notice the way my chain glow
Stop acting like you ain't loving me in my mink coat
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah[Kool G. Rap]
The last time I caught a body it was recent
Gimme a HK, four banana clips, and I'll take on a precinct
Yeah, the murder rate is on the rise, with niggas like me
Steady poppin, niggas are droppin like flies
To get em up when I hit em I hit em hard, there'll be no get well card
Niggas straight to the motherfuckin graveyard
Cause me no wanna get undone
Me pickin the one and lickin em up and hit em up for fun
He thought them bullet hit me but him didn't get none
You better run son, because me beginnin to get the gun
Yo, murder me, you musta heard of me
And if you get rushed to emergency, I'm shootin niggas in surgery
Another nigga life is took
I'll be at your wake motherfucker signin my name on that book
Inside the morgue another body freezes
It's one more bitch nigga that was sent to meet Jesus
"Come on down!" "Whassup nigga?"
No ambulence, just paramedics scrapin your brains off the street
So yeah motherfucker come get a taste
Cause I'mma give your punk ass my two in face and beat the case
My finger's on the trigger, I'mma pull it
So now you know that Kool G Rap is number one with a bullet

[Big Daddy Kane]
A one man gang to bring the bang
So the next nigga can't even hang, yang yang yang yang
You know my style, and know my pedigree
You can ask Sadaam Hussein about me
I'm never to let a brother bass
And if you bring on a crew, I hope the bitches saw Scarface
Cause I'mma send em to the morgue
Six feet under, gettin their mail from the groundhog
Cause I'm the wrong brother to push
When put to the test, I go to war like George Bush
And I got apartments to give
The landlord of the morgue, now who need a place to live?
I'm rough and tough, the man on the scene
The baddest the maddest, you know the routine
I flip and rip, to set the rank
The coolest in rulin the gangsta lean
I got my gat to your dome and I'mma pull it
I'm number motherfuckin one with a bullet

[Kool G. Rap]
Niggas are wavin white flags, then dragged
In a hospital bed, full of lead, with a shit bag
You get a slug in your mug
Just give him a kiss and a hug, I pull the mother, "flatline"
I'm fuckin him up I'm buckin him up all properly
No poppin me is stoppin me even if he go look out for me
I'm quicker to flicker the nigga the trigger is the plan for me
You try to run me comin to kill the whole family
Cause in the city there's no pity or no sympathy
You gotta hem em up, and now you're just a memory
Yeah nigga, I leave em done when I hit em
When pussy comes to get em, tell em Kool G Rap did em
With my fingers on the trigger I'm Terminatin like umm..
(Who Schwarzenegger?) Yeah that nigga!
So fuck all the bullshit
You know a nigga's number one with a bullet[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Yeah, you know the clique move deep as the Red Sea
7:30 like a nigga be on PSP
Be in VIP, VSOP doing it B-I-G
Nigga you know me
Soon as the motherfucking jakes on him he low key
Take a little journey O-T where that dough be
The fifth on him
I O-D like the O-D the fish on him
Brim of the hat to the nose piece the chicks on him
Some wild hoes, in wild style clothes
They download and videotape 'em like al po
The wild road facing the chair if the trial blow
That's with the best friends and the sounds Tical knows
Know that killers come with calm faces
Shakes and hugs ace with gloves
Hate from love the traits of thugs
Snake like characteristics
Me, Big J, R.A gun barrels get lifted

[Hook]
3 kings, there ain't no snatching our crowns
We be them 3 kings, we here to fracture you clowns
3 kings, Big John, Rugged Man and G Rap
Talking trash, no talking back, we slaughter you cats

[Verse 2: R.A the Rugged Man]
Who the master in the rap game? Thorburn last name
Reigning smacking attacking ya brain aiming back with the flame
Attract pain and learn from the best murdering burning the rest
We ain't no GQ rappers like Pharrell or Kanye West
I'm an abomination, I'm bombing a nation's population
You just a chick with a dick without no operation
I'm barely eating badly beaten, beaten badly in the precient
I'm the hardest that God ever gave the privilege of speaking
Frantically bannin'g me, Rugged Man'll panicky that'd be fantasy
Loaded hammer he handing me blabber the bragger be
A man who'd be damned if he happily married with family
Splatter ya mammy mammory gland insane insanity anarchy
Swagger the rapper the biter biting his flattery
Beating buzzing you battery agony back to reality
Bring it back you deliver that pitiful pitter pat
Pull the trigger snitch hit a rat you wick-wick-wack

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big John]
Decapitation vaccination Big John ain't no mental patient
Been on medication ever since the day I could talk
You want a sedative you can drink the blood from my heart
We magnificent glistening banging bitches while we christening
You kelters and helters we here to body you cowards
My occupations slaughtery for wack rappers who try and bother me
You not as hot as me, Big John it gotta be
Exceptional technical poison pumping through my ventricals
I'm fresh in 0-7 those battles pseudo-intellectuals
Y'all faggots get smashed quick, for rapping that wack shit
Chop with the hatchet throw it in the trunk of a black whip
You can't imagine my passion combined with rapping adaption
And with the comic book caption reads I'm the bombest kid rapping
I smack cliques with wack writs cause really they that bitch
Big John, Giancana stuff bricks in the mattress
Fuck with R.A and im leaving you backless[Big Daddy Kane]
You in the perils of the lyrical heroes
That rule just like the pharoahs
Robert Dinero's got it covered just like sombreros
Seek shelter, here comes the warpath
Anyone who's tryin' to reign, I change the whole forecast
If I slip, half a herd he learned
This murder he earned turned his body to third-degree burns
You're purely pathetic, I won't let it
And once I set it, the after-party's in the paramedics
Vultures, come back when you're older
Talkin' like you're grown, you cats is Small Soldiers
Enough of them as the god muscle in, it's puzzlin'
You couldn't carry weight if you was hustlin'
Style ain't even de-cent, them not gonna squeeze none
Please dun, give me one rea-son
What I, say in a verse will be slayin' you worse
As I wet 'em up just for the sake of obeying my thirst
Anytime anywhere, without any fair
I'll do it with any hair, what da deal, ain't he there, wha wha what
What I do will be crucially brutally
Usually legal and rippin' stupidly, ain't nothin' new to me
What I spit attract felons, crack melons
Leave the chickenheads back swellin'
Game tight wit the way I'm livin'
I bag birds and I stuff em like Thanksgiving
My bad self, get more love than tennis
From New York to Venice
Black as a Guinness here to represent to live with the menace
To win The Apprentice, if your heart shows stealth
You better watch yo' self before I stop yo' health
Cause any props here baby, you ain't gettin'
You better recognize, the true and livin'
You played yourself fast, put two quarters in your ass
What I meant, arcades done went up to fifty cent

[Chino XL]
That lyric tarantula, Chino about to make this example of
Wit one verse, shittin' on a whole label roster sampler
My first name: Chino, my last name: Went There
Leavin' rappers curled up and dyed like Immature's hair
Wit lyrical warfare, when I spray shit
My style like AIDS, half a y'all got it just none of y'all is sayin' shit
I hate and spit at devils that want to posses Chi
Jesus came in the vocal booth, like "Nigga, you the next me"
So test me, battle and you will become a dead man
And there's a lot of fake Chino's like Craig Mack's a fake Redman
But I'm above the surface of this rap circus
Writin' more incredible verses on accident than you can on purpose
You a worthless waste of flesh, like fat asses on a nun
I'm God's bastard son, that blasts and thinks bloodbaths are fun
I hate you with a passion, make white chicks faint like I'm Hanson
Historically known for bringin' down the house like I'm Samson
My damn tongue bursts, in the the first verse there's a bad curse that hurts
I'm leavin' wack church passengers inside of a fast hearse
Escapin the wrath of Jerse
It's a sad earth when my pen dirts
Axe murderer type of massacre occurs if we match words
I'm past blurs, I smack herbs
Gritty-green eyes like Badu
Leavin' minds fucked up like Maxwell's hair-do
And I'mma be the sickest till I'm dead
The type to rent Halloween 4 eight times just to laugh at LL's head
My new album is Flo-Jo's heart, watch it blow up
You ain't just wack, you're what wack wants to be when it grows up

[Kool G Rap]
The Godfather saga, hit you dead in the chest like shots of Vodka
Funer-als crowded like soccer while I'm watchin' opera
Last like Sinatra, blast like Binaca
Binoculars is how I'm watchin' droppin' from the chopper
Mafia imposter
You're left for dead with your face inside of your plate of pasta
?Freddy in a hasa?, salute to my crew to prosper
You know how we do, we icepick the boulder
You get dabbed over glasses of ice with the Bolla
Blood on your shoulder, make costra nostra
Keepin' the heater with the toasters
Dough in the sofa, cashmeres and gator loafers
We bullet-proof the Rovers, pimp-smack you sober
Our whole crew is skippin' to lieutenants and soldiers
Flip on you the way Montana did to Minola
Condition vulgar holdin' on blowers older than Yoda
Leave bad odors when we give cobras crystal like Yoga
Colder than the caps that's in the Polar, bubble like soda
Bend these old Lola Falanas over
Cross me, cut our your momma's ovaries
Kid you know the steez, have your wake smellin' like potpourri
On the low-key, ship keys to over-seas
My shit gets sold quicker than groceries
K-double-O-L-and-G, you know it's me4, 5, 6 is in the mix - I'm hittin them with trip's
Headcrack, time to get the bread black!
4, 5, 6 is in the mix - I'm hittin them with trip's
Headcrack, time to get the bread!

I rolled on every cee-lo corner that I know inside the city
Kiddies, I got a fat mitt in my pocket lookin pretty
So who wanna get paid on the block? A thousand's in the pock'
Now go and grab your knots from the stash spot
I shake them up and shake them up roll and I break em up
Two tracies and a pound-cake ("Yeah nigga, wake em up!")
Keepin my fingers wrapped around the joint in case niggas
Start brawlin, because I see em FALLIN to the strong point
One by one they losin down the line
A fifty buck roll, a duck blows, old nigga pay me mine! ("Damn nigga!")
I grab the dice, place your price, all you men are mice
Riffin as I'm sippin on a Heineken and gettin nice
I shake em up they papes are gettin dead, nigga sittin on a Beretta
Said he wanna bet that I don't throw a better
Now the game is surrounded by some money hungry bitches
I put the kisses on my fists and rolled the triple sixes
And once again it be the point, that I shoot
That be puttin crazy loot, in the pocket of my army suit
Now who wanna come throw another round
I rolled a fo', a six, hold up, NOW I seen a fuckin pound
Yeah you nigga know what the name of the game is
I'm in yo' anus, cee-lo you know that shit that made a nigga famous
Because I'm on the ding-dong, I can't go wrong
Rollin for two hours long and STILL rollin strong

4, 5, 6 is in the mix - I'm hittin them with trip's
Headcrack, time to get the bread black!
4, 5, 6 is in the mix - I'm hittin them with trip's
"Bettin Grants with the cee-lo champs" -] Nas

I make em sweat from beginners to the vets, I'm a threat
Some niggas double up on they fifty bets
I gotta be nice to the dice, so I'm talkin to em
I step back, gave a snap on the sidewalk and threw em
Nigga went and put his foot in the way see, and tried to ace me
Now I've got niggas rollin to that bitch Tracy
Yeah, but Tracy ain't so gentle, niggas thought she was simple
And loses with two deuces and a fuckin pimple ("A loser!")
I crack another brew, sit back and watch what niggas do
Who threw that 2-U? I'm rollin the whole fuckin crew
One by one niggas come payin, that fell to the trey and
Furlough inside the bait, that's what a nigga sayin
Your luck is tough, I'm makin enough to buy a kilo
Uh-oh, look out below, I think I rolled another cee-lo
Pick up my crap, niggas don't get back a DIME of that
And keep my hand right by my waist where my nine is at
One more test, and niggas quittin, that's zero
Broke, cryin broke, I'm doin backstrokes in cee-notes
Crazy pockets are empty, what a god damn shame
Niggas you know the name of the game - word the fuck up!

4, 5, 6 is in the mix - I'm hittin them with trip's
Headcrack, time to get the bread black!
4, 5, 6 is in the mix - I'm hittin them with trip's

"Bettin Grants with the cee-lo champs" -] Nas[Verse 1: Ghostface]
Yeah! Come on! I know many boney niggas that knock big niggas out
Force MC's to write more when my pen is out
Indian Gym's pedestal prince sit on thrones
Crack bones hardly pay back loans
Fuck a Maybach I hash back a three G stone
One bitch, four fifth, rubber grip, never hidden it's shown
This is for dirt balm niggas wingworm babies who smell like piss in school
Smoke wombs, rob and tote tools
Jail and poke fools, bash niggas in the head
With forties after thatm shake your hand and get more brew
Please be at ease God, fuck the disease God
You rap niggas front on me, I'm a squeeze God
Headline, man get sprayed by retard
Ghostly thing, he left behind the red clark
His gun bark up big trees
Made his best with a bomb and fluid, olivie oil and mint leaves
When y'all bag up your fuckin bottles is empty
We serve glaciers that's why the fiends is friendly

[Hook]
Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime
I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave!!!

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
Then, uh, what! Bread ridiculous, heads want a whiff of this
Glad for hypocrites layin back and triple this
Model heads hollow heads and the nickel fifth
When I juggle fuck a double nigga flip with chips
Sets I cripple this let a nigga nipple kiss
The scene'll hit or miss I'll show you where you ticklish
The more iceyed out need to bang your wifey out
She like the way my Rose Gold chain swing my thing bang
Know I got niggas in Sing Sing like Ving Rhames
I'm not a nigga that maintain the same dames
I'm steady switchin up, Chevy truck glistened up
I'm not them other suckers motherfuckers listen up
This nigga riffin what, who the fuck is kissin up
You own the cake you'll get ducktaped listen up
The goon trace when they say Buck lift 'em up
New York plates on the interstate shiftin up, what

[Hook]
Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Aiyyo! Squeezin your hammer jammin it
Each of my niggas gamblin with people don't think we family
Clark whip up call up Sammy
I clash with major paper my blood is an alligator
My style is a mile away from y'all niggas Sal of haters
We came to take it over my plane is delayed I drove up with hangers and back up rovers
Movin through the rain with golfers
Who carry heavy armor with bangers and rep regardless
Chef will play the Jeffrey Dahmer dig you when I'm in your garments
Y'all niggas is 'spicious, supercrabfragilistic
Niggas that I'm against is ginzu 'em with the quickness
Rappers is pussy so soft, mad gushy
Go north, your your dad pushed me schooled him cause he had a pussy
We puff crazy reefa too tough the thing'll heat ya up
Got them leeches off your ass nigga keep shit up
We blown the speakers and Chef go and season shit up
Release of the gutter and still wanna beat shit up, whattup!!!

[Hook]
Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime

[Verse 4: Lord Tariq]
Lord the borough's mainframe, I remain the same chain
Lames play the game to gain cock and aim the than thang (Bang!!!)
I let the thang rang then became the king of caine
Gettin chains slingin thangs no different than Richard mane
Call a order off the water y'all native New Yorker
Caught a case the law was lacin y'all with eights and raw the states applaud
Facin it for sure with just the taste the states and laws
Made to degrade my age limit diminish my cause
Ain't nothin to us nothin move us tightly knitten up and through us
Type of shit the hype the gripe I got despite my life is it
And what you talk is what we walk
And what we up we love this spot
Place none above me of course faithfully yours
I hate when it warms, rapin the law
Came through the door with a cape and cane
Sayin my name wavin the four
Displayin the false aim and then buss claim it was yours
Ain't no team hotter than Team Saga sign the Lord!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Who wanna feel the fire from me fuckin with the don
Just save the Ying Yang for Lil' Jon kid it's on
Got the coffin case Slay they try to connect
They know that, Stuyvesant vet a be the livest we get rid of
Greasy is from where the sleezy is from
Devious one, and anytime you need me it's done
Some talkin off the yap trip and what they gonna do?
But know they couldn't find the fuckin heart with John Q
I'm hear to warn you, we vouched your plans
My name is sent to 'mounts of millions you get thousand fans
Little fly by night nigga that's about to land
Let me take the shit up out of your hands
Understand, your games won't work can't hide your own jerk
And any technicalities I'm pullin on skirts
Beside the mink jacket that be where the chrome lurks
So make sure my paper write like we checkin homework, come on

Ghostface Killah, Kool G. Rap, Raekwon The Chef, Lord Tariq, Big Daddy Kane!!!
We out!!![Canibus]
Yo.. the shottie rip, perforate the skin on top of ya ribs
Red stuff come out his ribs like a Hollywood script
Bitch-niggas on the floor screamin for mommy and shit
Cardiologists hook up the heart monitors quick
Thermometer temperature dips below 76
That's what you get for tellin niggas that you better than 'Bis
Not possible - if I can't pronounce it, it ain't rhymable
The audible probability probably ain't probable
Supreme rap, G Rap, underground without a rule
Shopper proof, holdin hip-hop for hostage, bout to shoot
Helicopters stabilized at low altitudes
Talkin to the negotiator, layin out the rules
In a tight compromise salute, road-block with troops
Underwater's not to shoot, but they break ya vertebrae with boots
Ten o'clock news flash, 'Bis and G Rap
All punch bullets are lookin for them niggas in black
Lean back in the avocado El Dorado, passin the bottle
Speakin Japanese like Nomi Masho
She got a bangin body, cold sushi with warm saki
If I'm rappin sloppy, she got me...

[Kool G Rap]
Welcome to my world, danger and hazards
Gang of bastards, bangin they ratchets
King and the Jacker, slangin in traffic
Claimin they cabbage, obtain half, they aimin for stackage
Get brains from the addict, keep blingin with karats
Cops aiming the 'matics, then let ya dame have it, flames to the attic
The stains on ya fabric, the paint in the graphic
Canibus and G Rap, bangin a classic
And if that beef on the street - hate you enough
Blow out ya brain in ya casket
Don't you love this drug element?
Where slugs crush ya melon and dome
Chrome that's known to break bones in an elephant
Shotgun pellets and, gunsmoke; smell the scent
Big bullets, wiggle ya guts like gelatin
Cut through ya skeleton, knock out ya intelligence
Ride, stand, and bite the dust
Jake wanna be like a Russian cuffed on that Riker bus
We raised in the slums, with haze in our lungs
Raisin the guns, knowin;
My day'll come, razors under the tongue
Clips in the steel, bricks in the wheels
Chips in the field of fortune
Dead men walkin with hits on the grills
Late night at the spot, posted with goons, dope and balloons
Coke and the doom, scheme; I'll leave you open with wounds nigga
Witness G Rap put it back in perspective
Beat up shit with a dash of the peppers
Get blast for ya necklace
Leave ya brains on the dash in ya Lexus
We up in the club, dash for the exit
Make ya spread 'em out - show you what this lead about
Take it from an old thug, whoever clean cold blood
Believe they bled it out (yo)
Crave for the war, pop out rages with fours
Hit the jackpot, blazin the raw - gettin bands in the pores
Bitches and whores with dick in their jaws
The frame drank sick of Valor, straight bandit spot
Open up shop, turn the block to "Planet Rock"
Shit with no chop, slept with the Glock with the hammer cocked
Servin the fiends, hop in the Suburban and lean
Look at that don nigga swervin in Queens, playa
Ballin a lot, brawlin for props, callin the shots
Hit the curb, birds all on the flock
Jockin, like "who that there covered in all of them rocks"
It's royalty bitch, fall on the cock, recognize one
Giacanna G Rap, that live one - pay homage
Get it fucked up, I spray comments, nigga what?!
(Nigga what, it's the Curriculum!)

[Canibus]
Yo, e'rything is e'rything my nigga
I ain't bitter, but if I gave you the finger it'd be behind the trigger
Faggot-ass nigga livin in a gated community
Up in radio, tellin them what you gon' do to me
I live in the 'burbs - clean my Winchester
Every other weekend with the same dirty Hanes shirt
It takes two to tango, three to jump rope
Four to bury the body, plus look out for po'
Yo I guard everything within the limits of my post
My orders is to smoke you if you get to close
The whole globe scared of my flow, spirit world scared of my soul
Nowadays it's like I'm scared to be known
The methods of my motivation is completely subjective
My perception is completely parallel to perspective
Rhyming is the reason I spit in faces
Habituation of my flamboyance without rational reservation
Whiskey, X-Ray, yankee, Zulu, unusual
Word-ologically my syllable position is beautiful
Only respect niggas if the feeling is mutual
G Rap snatch the tools from you, I'll throw 'em in the crucible
Prolly throw you in there too, mix it up and make nigga-stew
If you can't admit I'm iller than you
Baby you sparred with the shadows, Canibus and G Rap yo
Motherfucker professionallin with the pros

[Kool G Rap]
Know it's, dough over hoes - bankrolls, Rovers and clothes
And shots blow all them cowards and foes
Giacanna proud with the pros, foul mode
We quick reachers, spear with the fearless til you drip liters
Flip divas, the big secret, strip to they tits and beaver
Sip Cris' and sniff coke of the peeter
Yeah we ball big baby, look off the meter
You should see us, it's movie star status
Scar lackers lost cabbage, rip the Pablo Escobar fabrics
Froze the road we chose, not a pretty route, Diddied out
Grimey and grittied out, stack dough, jiggy out
Dime bitches behavin like ya sex slave skizzied out
Some nigga dizzy south, til he's out, busy mouth
Swerve to the curb, hit the bird split the kitties out
We kidnap for trap - blackmail for a gang a mill
Spot banger himself, fishscale rocks under the fingernails
The blood trail lead to a corpse
Treat my appetite for greed with a torch
For keys to a Porsche, to breeze in the loft
Roll up my hand sheets with the force
We squeeze off, no need for remorse, playa
Forty wild goons, we forty Calhouns
You die forty foul dooms for forty coward moves
Bless sparkle, and spark until my shorty style rules
Giancanna dead? Widespread, I'll be a 40 mile tune nigga
What, what nigga? The noble laureate
Comin at y'all niggas..
Uh.. 40-pound style nigga...[Kool G. Rap]
You know the Don's armed with sixteen
And I do harm for this big cream, the whips and the carriage
Ball like the Knicks and the Mavericks, slipping the fabrics
Pull up wit some big shit, lieutenant shit, hitting the hazards
Spot a bitch wit that Cris habit, gotta have it
Fuck shorty and send her OT wit a brick in her baggage
Roll where the clubs at slip for the rabbit
Trick only lick dick status to get cabbage
She get lathered to the dick baptist
Who back on the map? Giancana wit a vengeance
It's drama to the finish, put the Llama to your appendix
And squeezing the slugs, gun powder season your blood
I'm a legend breathing, the reason you thug (nigga)
This where the buck stops, fuck props
Buck shots at the top money, what the fuck you forgot?
Thought I was done and wasn't touching the block?
Still real, busting the Glock
Put up and you can see it (blaow) what up now?

(Chorus)
"I'll exile barbarian style like an executor"
Wanna test Vinnie Paz man (Jedi Mind Tricks)
Enforce the moves on fools
[?] I'm invincible

[Mike Tyson]
Everybody talks and they like I'm losing my head, I'm losing confidence and that I'm talking loud and vulgar
I'm talking vulgar because I'm angry at what I've experienced all my years through this and I'm just angry!
Everyone else has the right to be angry too but that's just how I express myself

[Vinnie Paz]
Yo, bust a motherfucking gat to this
Y'all believe lies like y'all was Catholics
I rap in Arabic, so my message is just immaculate
My rap elaborate, drink a forty and blaze a sack to it
My aim is accurate, take your brain and blow out the back of it
I'm salty, miserable cat that slap shorties
Looks kinda resemble that, a fat Pauly
I don't even clap, young boy, he claps for me
Chain hang down to my dick, I'm that gaudy
I don't even fuck wit you cats, you rap poorly
I don't even buck at you cats, you that corny
Wit a wack army, we barkin' at you
And Vinnie Paz holds a hammer like a carpenter do
You should understand that I ain't really fuckin' around
And if you don't, you gonna find your body stuffed in the ground
We buckin' em down, cuz that's how wrong my life is
Y'all don't overstand how fuckin' strong my wife is
I'm from a time where every song was righteous
Before rap was just a swarm of white kids
And y'all a witness to the dawn of hypeness
Or just another victim to the pawns and sheisters
I'll feed your corpse to a swarm of vipers
Let em suck the blood till your form is lifeless
What! Fuckin' Vinnie Paz daddy! Jedi Mind Tricks! (Yeah!)

(Chorus)"Coming From Queens" *scratching*

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]

Yo
Light the leaf, lay sugar sweet
Inhale the mystic
The three shells by the toilet
I'm futuristic
I'm so ridiculous, my mental sickness-
Women, love a light skinned brown with lots of thickness
A Queen's thing, no shoes in the tatami room
Legs crossed sipping hot sake
Big drugs like a sushi roll
She see the cops, throw the drug up in a poopy hole
Plus she steered the coupe
Eyes shining like diamonds
Smiling like new veneers
Fuck her once, left a souvenir
Plus she take it through the rear door
I watched her change
Now she balling, got a clear floor
Halibut seared off
I'm not impressed though
Cigar full of pesto
Smoking rings, linen from Ernesto
Straight from Queens where it's wise to wear a vest, bro
We blowing up in the world, i'll never let go

[Hook]

"Coming From Queens" *scratching*
It's a Queen's Thing (3x)

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]

The streets know how I get down
I bang these weaponry
So think "before I let go"
Like Frankie Beverly
Yeah, I creep with your wife, kid
Her brain be heavenly
Dribble on my balls so crazy
Her game need a referee
Come and run to me and complain
Lean my press and squeeze
I hit your frame
Till you're shit stained and wet with pee
I'm a loose shooter
The color of the coupe puter
Stewardess on the dick on a plane to Aruba
Introduced her to the mile high club and scooped her
Told the bitch that I'm the QU Larry Hoover
I run things in the sewers
With flames from the Rugers
Keep heat like saunas
Crimes for the drama
With body armor up under Louis Vuitton farmers
Still trapped in the 80's, Dapper Dan crazy
Tan Mercedes, whip it past the traffic jam, baby
Hundred grand wrapped in rubber bands
Niggas straight cheese
It's me

[Hook][Chapter I: Kool G Rap]
I know this chick, yo mami is rich, she push a six
Living some bloodshed, her man is pushing bricks
Crib way out in the sticks, they house looking slick
It's like some shit straight out of a Hollywood flick
Me and my clique met the chick up at Saint Nicks
Honey was thick, I was the first nigga to kick
Yo mami was thick, silk skirt with thigh split
I couldn't quit, trying to peep out the privates
The live shit, you know how loose I get
I'm scheming on her back, peeping her hips, fiending to hit
Plump cherry lips, medium tits, Chink eyes her baby hair chick
The type you want to pair with, have an affair with
We chattered a bit, slipped me the digits, to the hip and the phone flip
Said she had to split, hopped in the whip, headed up the strip
Probably had to get with her man and shit
Later on at night, I'm stressing love at first sight
Some ain't right, I ain't the type of cat like me
To be dealing with mad feelings
And even though mami was mad appealing
Body revealing and big wheeling
This shit is illin, I don't like it
Fuck it, I can't fight it
I reaching for the cordless to call Miss
I insist to get with this
Tan Tone answer the phone, "Hello, who this?" (chick)
"It's me baby, G Luciano, what up lady"
"Fine and how you doing boo" (chick)
"Ain't nothing new but you, angel, yo why don't you swing through
"we could sip on some champagne from Spain boo"
About an hour or two she came thru, fly hairdo
We link, push in the six circle circle drink
To purple mink, had mad bank, Chanel bag full of Benjamin Franks
More ices than a hockey rink, face of a Saint
Went for a drink, open windows, a spot for our shots
Would wanna spend those five digit o's, on bimbo's
Bar closed, back to her six double o, she drove
My eyes closed her nigga dozed, when I awoke
Saw mad snow, we at her spot at the Poconos
Bridge robes, crib hot as a stove
She changed out of her clothes, put on a silky bath robe
Panty hoes with see thru holes, pretty toes
Took me into the master suite, shit was sweet
Jacuzzi four feet deep, with satin sheets
As I was speaking to this half black/latin freak
Met on a Manhatten street, body petite, fat on the cheeks
I was getting open, started laughing and joking
We weed smoking, stroking, the shorty's spoke and
Said what the deal is, the realness
My man is crazy as Bruce Willis
If he catches us, he'll try to kill us
He got a whole army of Killers
Me no worry, I got the clapper son
End of the first verse, chapter one
Word
Shit is real in the field
Thug love story

[Chapter II Intro: "G. Luciano"]
So here I am
Laid up in this lavish house, up in the Poconos
With this chick I don't even really know
Steady stressing me how ill her man is
So what I go and do, heh-heh, I nail her ass to the bed anyway
Straight twisting mami's back out
Hit three o'clock, fell right the fuck to sleep
Clothes still on, breath smelling like Henrock
Totally no kind of regards for this bitch's man
I guess it's just another one of those G Rap adventures

[Chapter II: Kool G. Rap]
The next day about a quarter to eight
I heard a squeek on the staircase
Got the gat from under the pillow case
Somebody broke in, now me and boo fully awoken
Good thing I slept inside my clothes and shorty was frozen
I'm waiting for a head to poke in, and start smoking
The home invasion, right through the door, he started blazing
Bullets was grazing, shit was crazy and
I had to think fast, let the gun blast, duck, then dash
Heard a crash, they broke through the door, they on her ass
Jumped off the balcony like a falcon Gee
With honey right in back of me, feel on top of the snow in agony
Shit was thick, couldn't get to the six, they loaded the fifth
Saw the snowmobile yo fuck it
We start jumped it, get on top of the shit and peeled
Mad soldiers out in the field, busting they steel
The raw deal, kill or be killed, shit is real
Ten hit me right on my heels, trying to make a thugs blood spill
In zero degrees, niggas on skis, me and these Gees
Slipping through pine trees, we skid up behind these
Two big rocks and left off shots, about four dropped
The other six started to pop, I feel something hot
I think I got hit, my jacket is ripped
Loaded my last clip then broke out quick and checked the chick
She on my back tighter than shit, like vise grips
I started clapping, niggas rolled up in blowing black and
Spotted this Rover by a log cabin, we got our as in
Mash the gas, make the fucking wheel spin
The safety again, and still doing a hundred and ten
Shorty shivering, lips quivering, ski suits up in the back seat
Pulled over the Jeep get it in
And took a rest stop at the river bend
We living, we made it the fuck out, mad slugs delivering
Pretty soon we at my rest piece, up in the bedroom
Got shorty boo tending my bullet wound
Put on some tunes, she blew my shit like a balloon
Up in the moonlit room, and dicking her womb
Hitting full behind her, grinding her with my anaconda
She rode the dick like a honda
I took her to the point of no return like Bridgette Fonda
She back spasmed, giving the crazy orgasm, from steady rhythm
My dick glistened, her lips hit'em, I shot jism
Then laid back in the sack and lit the ism
I thought about the realism
Niggas coming and bring they steel with them
I got just the thing to deal with them
Nickel plate Mac, the laser attached, with two clips packed
Push a niggas whole head back, so I snatched that
So quick spread out and play the layout
Still on alert, me and the skirt, day in and day out

[Chapter III Intro]
["G. Luciano"] Yo what's the matter mami, you scared or something?
["Mami"]  I'm a little worried baby
["G. Luciano"] Yo, don't be worried about nothing, alright
Everything is gonna be alright
["Mami"] OK
["G. Luciano"] Look, we just gonna go to your house, go get the money
You know, we gonna get your backs or whatever
And we gonna get out of there, alright?
["Mami"] Alright, ven paca papi, dame un besito
[G. Luciano] Alright, grab that bag money
[Mami] Let's do this, baby

[Chapter III: Kool G. Rap]
After three whole days of lamping, we broke camp and
Went out to the beach, many mansions out in the Hamptons
Brung the clamp, ready to shoot shit up at random
Five hundred grand is buried in the sand
We planning, up in the crib-o with big windows, I'm counting the dough
She packing her clothes, had her Lexus in the back of the Rolls
I saw the keys, I grabbed the G's, we on and took those
Shit was sitting on some chrome momo's
Tinted windows, a LS Ford double O
Told the chick, yo you moving to slow
Speed it up baby, we got to go
And get this plane and hit the Caymans
With the payment, somebody came in
A platoon of goons with heaters aiming
I drew the Mac 10 and started flaming, they did the same and
Slugs spraying and blood raining, I left about seven thugs laying
But this one cat was gaining, he grab the dame and
Put the heater to the chicks brain and
I let my two guns drop, they got the drop
They took us both to a boat dock, then on a yacht
The chick's man was there with a sixteen shot
Nigga was hot, took the Glock and hit me dead in my knot
Honey started to panic and yelling that money in spanish
Thinking he's out to take advantage
So we're out in the fucking Atlantic
With no lifesavers and stranded
Backhanded the chick on the floor, called her a whore
Said, "amor you won't be pretty no more"
Took us on a tour, down in the deck
Guess he wasn't ready to kill us yet
Saw this nigga there, holding the Tec
Ready to wet, I'm started to sweat, a niggas stressed
We up beside a horrible mess
I saw a box with the letters on it S.O.S
So I took out a flare gun and shot the kid in the chest
Took the Tec from out his hand, now I'm ready to bless
The madness, put the rest of them niggas to rest
Looked around, the chick's man was the only one left
Threw his ass over board and told him hold your breath
Caught my breath, I seen honey down on the deck
Eyes closed with a bullet hole dead in her breast
Held her in my arms till her soul finally left
I'm mad depressed, my baby was an innocent death
A real thug lost the only women he loved
And I bugged, busting slugs at the stars above
Word[Verse 1: Kool G. Rap]
I'm bad to the bone with a style like Al Capone
I'ma smile while I give you the dial tone
Eatin shrimp and girls I be pimpin
Walk like I'm limpin, this brother ain't simpin
Not to mention, I'm winner of Mack Daddy conventions
I get a lot of attention
Sleepin in sheets that's made of satin
With one of my money makin honies, she's mixed Spanish and Latin
She's a fly type of swinger
Twenty carats on her fingers, minks on every coathanger
In a highrise, made for only fly guys
With a size that attracts the ladies eyes
Keepin the stash and the cashflow
Profile's kept low, more dough than Barry Manilow
Fly cars, I got diamonds in jelly jars
To earn respect, collectin bar fight scars
Slick talkin with a chick when I'm walkin
Midnight stalkin, all the suckers be hawkin
And I max while you be waxin your Cadillacs
Smooth as a fax, but I can cut you like an axe
Big spender, cause I'm a winner like Bruce Jenner
I burn all beginners and let em simmer like a TV dinner
On the phone cause I'm hard like stone
Holdin my own, cause I'm bad to the bone

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
I'm gettin cash and ladies receive my passion
Parties I'm crashin with a flashy type of action
On stage I kick outrageous
And I enslave the bravest, more diamonds than Sammy Davis
I'm more dramatic than Dallas is
More pretty than a palace is, hands no callouses
Give me a clever girl and I'll outfox her
The man that rocks her in pure silk boxers
So what you want honey a chump or a champ?
Visa or food stamps, Latins or lamps?
I run the game like Sega
Go to war like Noreaga, hit like Schwarzenegger
Excitin when I'm fightin I'm frightenin
Stick chicks slick in quick like greased lightning
Ladies I'll love you all tomorrow like Annie
And I bet you'll all leave with wet panties
Cause I can make a eighty yard dash come back fast
Wrap rappers all up in the back like a jackass
Police wanna harass me
Cause I got all the material that has me lookin jazzy
The MC patroller
Pockets so fat, I flat em down with a dough roller
Dead zone when I strike the microphone
G. Rap's known, cause I'm bad to the bone

[Verse 3: Kool G. Rap]
I never needed a helpin handin
I'm outstandin, type of guy girls never abandon
The one who rollin with force, three across your belly
Knockin suckers out the box like I'm playin skelly
Cause I pull out the .45 if you offend me
And leave the barrel of it smokin like a chimney
Rhymes are dynamic, voice is titanic
Gigantic, suckers get frantic and then panic
A smooth talker, cause I'm a Queens New Yorker
My rhymes bring more Good Times than Jimmie Walker
A bumrusher, cause I'm a crusher of hardrocks
When I turn 30, I'll still be dirty as Redd Foxx
Try to cope, what I wrote, get a sore throat
My lyrical notes float like sailboats
I keep it steady for the petty sucker rappers I'll be ready
I got more bodies than Frank Nitti
Battles I win em cause I send em to Hell when I begin em
Because I put it in em like a venom
Discover the toughest rap brother you ever seen
Not a fairy, but milky like the Dairy Queen
Movin around like a smooth choreographer
Posin my hoes in all clothes for the photographer
On video, show I makin your girlfriend moan
Cause I'm bad to the boneShe tossed the flamer '94 walked into danger
Behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back on the street, back on her feet
Clappin the heat...

[unknown singer]
She's dressed to kill
Iced-out head to toe, a snake in black
She's cleared, to, get ill
She's about the dough, the black widow

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Yo, she was a tight bird, female version of Iceberg
To put in the right words
Played the right curves, beige and white birds
The type she served it was quite superb
Ran through the city in a white suburb
Lived in a predominantly white suburb
She liked the herb, rockin all the richest type of furs
Make your life submerge if you strike a nerve
Dough she like to splurge
Shine of her light blurs from off her finger
Honey was off the ringer, the way she tossed the flamer
'94 walked into danger, behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back to the street, back on her feet
Clappin the heat, from the back seat, in back of a jeep
Stackin the heat, pilin the ones
Made her point when violence was brung
Regulated and balanced the slums
Brought in a cat with a talent for guns
Click quick to silence a Dunn
Convoys of black limos
Employs strapped with mack millos
Bustin off caps through a cracked window, that's the MO
Push your wig back, make you a black Leno
The feds on her tracks got the phones tapped for info
Tryin to map the dividend flow, and where the ends go
Checkin on whose name the Benz go
Who pushes the buttons when Mac-10's blow
A rose on a black satin pillow
The silhouette of her web, killin for bloodspill, a black widow

[Hook: unknown singer] + (Kool G Rap)
She's (out for blood) dressed (for the kill) to kill (bustin slugs)
Iced-out (shit is real) head (livin crime) to toe (life of crime)
A snake (droppin heads) in black (pullin nines)
She's cleared (dodgin heat) to (play the street)
Get ill (let the guns blow, had to eat)
She's about (copped the raw) the dough (went to war)
The black widow (beef no more, cold fours at your door)

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
She was married but four times a widow
The fifth time ditto, kiddo
Step out of line, kitko, she spit nines and shi-dells
Put a pound to the tip of your niddose
Put em in line piddles
Diamond-stud shinin the clito', the web spinnin
With bloodstains soaked in the bed linen
Spread venom, known for bustin the lead grinnin, tilted red brimmin
Makin the lights inside of your head dimmin
Givin head to men and, leave a knife in they chest with a red ribbon
Bread to swim in, foes get left deader than Lennon
Threads of linen, sippin gin with a shread of lemon
Dead-up thoroughbred, slim and trim and stackin cake like Emminger's
Under the down coat brown coat like cinnamon
She went to have the Benjamins, for that she injure men
Send a squad to go and injure men that injure men
On top of that she popular, hit the opera
Francis Ford Coppola, mezzanine she's with binoculars
You even think about poppin her, stoppin her, moppin her, droppin her
Hard with bodyguards divin on top of her
Cops in they Blu-Blockers watchin her, steady clockin her
Jock her, dreamin of knockin her, thinkin a scheme for knockin her
Dress provocative, show the cleavage between her knockers
Bust a sock off with a blocker to rasta inside her locker
She cover the bills though, restaurant delicatessen Armadillo
White Willow, strike of the black widow

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
She held a white weddin
Type settin just like a sight from heaven
Spend twice the bread'n from her last rice on her head'n
All types of presents, striking presence
Bodyguards ready to light they weapons, ignite the Wessons
Refuse to live the life of a peasant
Days and nights was right and type pleasant
At the foot of the aisles, took vows
With all the criminals and crook pals
That put smiles on niggas' necks while they look foul
Piles of cops peepin her central book files
Beef them niggas cook wild, groom lookin shook style
Forced into marriage, horse and a carriage
Remember lifespan shorter than average, lady boss flossin her carats
Dreams to get rich and perish in Paris
Cherish the cabbagem, makin her path out of the church passage
Thugs they do they dirt massive
Skirt slashed, first class, Doni Amberg glasses
Flirt with her lashes
Snapshots, smirk for the flashes
Plots to leave her murked in the masses
Two killin experts on the grasses
Put in they Tec work for the cashes
Leave the Earth hurt with a passion
Two louds shots burstin in action
Made her head jerk from the blastin
Lady down, holdin her shirt gaspin, hit by another turf assassin
Reason not even worth askin; the facts are real, though
Got her cap peeled for stackin real dough
Lifestyle brillo when you're rollin for krill dough
Death of a black widow[Verse 1]
Back in the days was kinda crazy, kid I started out with nothin'
Wasn't livin' like Thanksgiving, I was turkey without the stuffin'
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the poorhouse
Say mama caught the drama, she would bleed tryin to feed 4 mouths
Wasn't rockin' Girbauds, I barely had clothes, and when it snowed
And temperatures droppin' below zero, you know I froze
No CD's, a black and white TV, a seat is a rubber tire
With a hanger for the antenna, turned channels with some pliers
Had nothin' in my cabinet, but cans of Raid
I'm knockin' on my neighbor's door
To borrow a cup of sugar for my Kool-Aid
I wasn't freshly dipped, my gear was straight ripped, I'm trippin'
Cause my winter coat got lost buttons
And zippers that wouldn't stay zipped
I never remembered ?, the brother was straight fat cat
Not even a Big Mac black, I had kit-kats on top of crackerjacks
Walkin' the streets, with the weak sneaks on my feet
And the freaks wouldn't speak, I never had lipstick on my cheek
So much for gettin' humped from the stunts, I always struck out
The ones you like says take a hike if you can’t pull a buck out
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world

[Hook]
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, youknowhatI'msayin? I'm blowin' up in the world

Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, yeah...

[Verse 2]
It seems like only yesterday, my moms was on my back
"Get your butt up out the sack and find a job or hit the road Jack"
Black, I don't disown her, I'm just a kid from Corona
With a G.E.D. diploma, with more ribs showin' than Tony Roma's
In order to get straight, I gots ta to make a muscle
Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle
Standin' down on the corner slangin' fat rocks to bottles
With the black tops, for cops got my shorty watchin' my back Hobbes
Makin' mad lucci, bought up Louis Vuitton & gucci
Hoochies callin' me boochi, while they smooch me, givin' up the coochie
Now I'm a felon, started sellin' and splittin' melons
I started gellin', to tellin' police just cause I was swellin
Hangin' out on the corner playin' cee-lo, rollin' for half a kilo
Yo you'll never see G-low a-goin below
Yeah, straight gettin' fortunate,  as long as fiends was torchin' it
It started gettin' hot around the block, the cops was scorchin' it
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me
Cause business is drugs is gettin' too risky
So now I just lamp, collect stamps, snatch up tramps diamonds and pearls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got put on by DJ Polo, cut the record, "It's a Demo"
And started chillin' in limos with champagne and tinted windows
Hoppin', no time for pages, sportin' gold chains and rings
Clockin' money and fame, nothin' changed, I'm still the same
Just spendin' 20's and 10's at women pullin' on my linen
And grinnin' cause I was winnin' in this game from the beginning
The lyrical skills was kinda ill, gave you a slight chill
So I just let the hype build, known for rappers run and go write wills
I turned from a hobo to a solo posing for photos
Though my dough used to be low, now I puff on cigars and blow Mo'
So catch a flashback, of a G. Rap track, attacked, like a head crack
That's smack, through your cap, with the lead black
And here's a new cut, for pooh-butt, rappers hangin' from off my
Two nuts like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux
So peep Kool G. Rap, don't sleep, money unless it's witcha girl
Straight up kid, I'm blowin' up in the world

[Hook][Intro]

Yo, beatin' bitches up ain't nothing new to me

You better hold on to your changes
Don't come talkin that slappin' shit
Cause that you're a woman, Miss
Don't think that it can't happen bitch
I make, bitches panick and sweat for their life
It's bad that bitches mostly get
Stabbed to death with they own knife
Dark skin bitches turn black and blue
I cruise around town, cruise their ass with a .22 (Bitch)
Cali bitches get the gat that I'm blastin'
I think straight slang
Sprinklers I'mma (?) when they askin'
Get the man and his wolfpack

Nobody's shit goes live

And drunk bitch that keep 'em full of it

I'm the first straight hater to yell out:
Go stupid bitch! Go stupid bitch!
Ain't nothing good about me, girlfriend
You want a good boyfriend, check the Marines

Don't hear me I ain't get no love (Fuck that)

You bite like bats if you heard me rap
Drop somethin fat on a track and take on thirty cats, you dirty rats
So here we go, yell Geronimo
Then pass up a hiney, yo
The flow will make you feel like a tiny ho
I grand-slam like I'm Van Damme
Act like a lumberjack, in fact the track will slam like a Rams fan
You suck so much you need a nipple
I squeeze a trigger, squeeze a Charmin and I cripple Mr. Whipple
And triple any rapper runnin his trapper tryin to kick it
Pull a pump out on a chump and make him jump like Jiminy Cricket
Flippin it like a page until the damn stage is torn
So bring it on, kid, bring it on

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 2: Kool G Rap ]
Send in the fire engines cause G Rap is startin fires
Rappers are jumpin like Evil Knievel
You better believe it, I'm comin like Michael Myers
So run and go hide as I get rid of the ones that hid
But on the lid what I did was, "Yo honey, I blew up the kids"
My broom's not singin the blues, so bring on the crews that try to do me
I'm skimpy like ?Kimpy?, snappy like Daffy and yahoowee!
See, I disrespects em, indeed I disrespect her
Your damn Sam Goody's record makes me laugh like Woody Pecker
Got price on hot mics so your spotlights are dimmin
Lyrics are fatter than womens that you see with Richard Simmons
So back up, don't act up, just be on some good behaviour
You thought it was Lifesavers, the flavor I just gave ya
In fact I pack a disco, my lyrics are slicker than Crisco
Give thrills from Blueberry Hill down to the streets of San Franscico
Like Tabasco I'm hot, if I wanna get ripple go sip on a Cisco
You hookey-playin rookies like they cookies from Nabisco
I shake it, I bake it, I take it to the break of, break of dawn
So bring it on, sucker, bring it on

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3: Ali Dee ]
I make examples out of suckers that I trample
Givin plenty lumps to them chumps, I'm a champ
Here's a sample, I catch flashbacks while I smash tracks
Then I blast stacks of wack and sad sack rappers get your ass waxed
Frontin get you nothin but a coffin
I bother your father and bring the drama to your mama, make your ass an orphan
I put some lead inside your head, you're dead and gone
So bring it on, trooper, bring it on

[ Hook ][Hook]
Billy Danze: Representing 1 7 1 8, dangerously
Cousin, you know the drill
Lil Fame: Respect mine we Brooklyn bound, bound!

[Method Man]
Playing my position, hot Nixon
This one, for all the sick ones, confliction
Posionous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itching with two broke legs, now I'm tripping
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly, tap your jaw
From my punch, watch your son and you
Got you shitting in your last Huggie, running who?
Fucking punk, get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu

[Redman]
Aiyyo I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin your ex ho
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobbling
Shit I'm driving in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be taking notes
I drop like I should've invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots

(Chorus)

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Today's agenda
Got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest
If no money exchanges
I got these kids in ranges
Believe them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless
You just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go thru
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo killings clean
Slugs up in between
They eyes, like True Lies
Kill em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, yo life is on the shelf
We mean this Frank
Them cats we fucking wit put bombs in yo moms gas tank
Lets get this money baby
They shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies
And burn em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies

[Raekwon]
We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Laying on the bed, looking like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, looking at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who would've ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitching noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor

(Chorus)

[Ghostface Killah]
Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust
If he holding the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot
Up early in the morning, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'
(fuck) the brawling, cause Tony for the stalling
And all I see is $ signs, here's the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggas)
Working out, all I curl is my index finger
Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggas) respect winners
I got them big spenders coming through, hourly
Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully
Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me
You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga

[Rakim]
Its mister word renowned with the best verse
One of the illest the streets, from the east to the west, heard
Get greeted with ghetto gestures like "yessir"
A pre-meditated killer for the way I stretch words
Some of us love to flow 'til the club close
And some in love with blow for the love of dough
In it for fortune and fame, flamboyant for girls
They extorting the game, exploiting the hood
Rappers ride for bread while the gossip spread
It's only hot cause we ride, spotted cops with feds
Plus, lots of heads go Pop instead
That's the word on the block is, "Hip-Hop Is Dead"
So consumers quit copping, rappers flip-flopping
Artist pimped by they labels like a slave pick cotton
Pop Charts killing underground Hip-Hopers
While the world still looking for Ra like Bin Laden, let's go

(Chorus)

[Busta Rhymes]
In God we trust
Yo its a must that you heard of us yo we murderous
A lot of niggas is wonderin and they curious
I'm making my niggas deal with it so mysterious
Furious all of my niggas is serious
Should niggas be walkin around fearing us
Frontin nigga like you don't wanna be hearing us
Gotta listen to the radio be playing us
30 time a day shit'll make you delirious
Damagin everything all up in your areas
Yo its funny how all the chickens be always serving us
All up in between they ass where they wanna carry us
Hitcha gonna hit em off with the illiest
Varias chickens they wanna marry us
Yo its Flipmode my nigga you know we bout to bust
Settle for your money the label preparing us

[Kool G Rap]
Suckers I clobber, because my town is full of cops and robbers
You're not promised tomorrow in this Little Shop of Horrors
So I got to get with the business of hit quick
Moneygrip's pocket's looking thick so I stick Slick
Hold it right here, hands in the air, I know you got the loot
Or better yet, face down on the ground, empty your pockets troop
Hit the deck I got the Tech right on your neck
And I expect to make a buck to heck with a traveller's check
But if a vic' tries to choke me
I'll have to smoke him like I'm Smokey the Bear, so okie dokie
Goodbye, or bon voyage, have a good journey
Don't even try begging for your life, that don't concern me
So to the next weasel that freezes
Your begging and your pleases only getting your closer to meeting Jesus
Yeah, I shake a schmuck just to make a buck
Then I break a duck and if the duck gotta get bucked then I don't give a f**k

(Chorus)[I'm Kool G Rap
Their latest release (x2)
I'm Kool G Rap...and he's Polo]

He's the big boss when his hands criss-cross
Up and down the crossfader turning wax to sauce
It ain't a hip-hop record that he can't chop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

[Get violent (x3)]

The rhythm he brings makes the audience swing
While the plates rotates his fingers cling
To the records on felts, your earwax melts
Scratching so hard that he breaks the belts
DJ's relax, kneecaps collapse
My rap perhaps is like a booby trap
Polo the big boar, I'm the warrior of metaphor
Fully equipped manipulating my competitor
And I remain just like a stain
As long as I maintain my brainiac brain
Rap words rehearsed since first grade
My utensil is the pencil and his is a blade
The man at the top of the needle drop
Polo let's have some fun, show them how it's done
Treat them like your son, in the butcher shop

[Psychopath on the phonograph (x2)]

DJ's he's disputed you should be saluted
The man gives a cut with scratches included
I'm Kool G Rap, he's my DJ
This is a mortal combat of the Polo play
Cuts like a scissor, rips like a razor
The sound penetrates elements like a laser
The beat connects to my dialect
New Technic turntables, the party I wreck
Motivation to blend, the rotation begins
They reported his fins on 1010 West
And his name is Polo the phonograph is for bolo
I go solo, to battle Kool G Rap is no-no, bozo
Your style is so-so, equal to disco
Swing and some go-go, and on to calypso
So biters and reciters, don't mean to offend you
Yes I will continue but I'm not a menu
So don't bite or swallow or fight or follow
Recite or borrow rhymes and want to give them back tomorrow
Polo is like Zorro, war hero
Horror, terror, errors: zero
The alert concert network expert
He'll wreck dissect inject insert
Cuts, til your eardrums pop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

[Nut of the cuts]

I'm a walking dictionary, an encyclopedia
Rapper with data, the best in the media
Or area, so prepare for your burial
On your radio, pull out your aerial
Or antenna cause this one is a winner
Not a sinner, or an MC beginner
Kool G Rap is just me not he or she or we
Or any other MC
So please, I'm single and not plural
I'm totally high moral, excellent with the oral
Contact, and at the maximum, yo he's climax
DJ Polo attacks the earwax
In the butcher shop

[I'm Kool G Rap and he's Polo...][RZA]
Yeah
Shake your funky ass, bitch
Yaknowmean...
Yo

[Kool G Rap]
Yo we divide cakes to rise the stakes
Me and my apes die for papes
Bust heat and hide from jake
Up in the skyscrape, on top of the world
Back yourself against the wall, gun brawl
Kid, I end it for all ya'll (Shake that cake bitch)
Son'll stop the dough from flowin
Spotless rock glowin, shots are blowin
Pop the c-lock, rollin waistline and Glock is showin
We keep it thugged out, who not knowin get your knot blown in

[RZA]
Yo yo
Bob Digital and Kool G Rap, we set the booby trap
African wiz wit the gat inside her dooby wrap
Derelict rhyme crabs, you rappin for a Scooby Snack
Foul-tongued bitch, you bound to lick my doody crack
Verbal pellets spray, tec sound makes my amex
Every slap on my snare drum son could break necks
You get yanked up and spanked up, your face shanked up
Who the FUCK raise your rank up?
I blow your tank up, pop the lock on a cop handcuff
Puff a dutch of dust, bust the jump' up and snuff out the judge
Fuck a cell block, black top capsule, the mailbox
It's heavy-bone birds stash Glock in the nailshop
One the strip, took a sip, twist the L top
The God jewels son sound like a third rail shock
The gold crossbone, doorag, universal flag
Blast at the turbo charge and purple herbal drag
Known for the W, carry a double-two in the shoe
Iron snub rubber noose in the bubble goose
Bullets soaked in oil, hot heat will flame broil
Wu-Tang slang I bang makes your brain coil

Shaolin gods we known to stack cakes
Desert Queen projects son, they bake cakes
Uptown Pilan dogs, you make cakes
Cold Medina sons, they known to take cakes

[Kool G Rap]
Yo, we have the Wu-Tang, we let two's bang
That's how we do thangs, that's how we move thangs
Shoes paid wit two in the brain
Keep the ice blue in the Range
Me and The RZ' quick wit two of them dames
Got my dick blew in the Range
My nigga keep it true to the game
It ain't no tellin what I do to you lames
If my mood change, choose to aim
Do you and your dudes the same
Go against grain and lose a fame
Who claim life in the thug lane but life is real
Lead come out of pipes of steel
Rob, kill, or heist for mills
Spill as I let out and slice your grill
Nigga don't think twice to peel
Just open shop and dice to grill
Send the six out, bust crib route
To the brickhouse, steppin on new terrain, bring the click out
The streets don't wanna see you read, let a clip out
These niggas slip out, make they blood drip out

Yo we divide the cakes to rise the stakes
Me and my apes die for papes
Bust heat and hide from jake
Up in the skyscrape, on top of the world
Back is up against the wall, gun brawl
Kid, I end it for all ya'll
The flood'll stop the dough from flowin
Spotless rock glowin, shots I'm blowin
Pop the c-lock, rollin waistline, the Glock is showin
E keep it thugged out, who not knowin get your knot blown in

[RZA]
We said Uptown Pilan dogs, you make cakes
Cold Medina sons, you known to take cakes
Desert Queen project wizes, they bake cakes
Shaolin gods, we known to stack cakes
Uptown Pilan dogs, you make cakes
Cold Medina sons is known to take cakes
Desert Queen project cats, they bake cakes
Shaolin gods, we known to stack cakes
Desert Queen project cats, they bake cakes
Shaolin gods is known to stack cakes

Cold Medina son is bound to take cakes[Intro]
Heyyo check it
This goes out for all of the ones that's walkin' around here
Out in the streets blindfolded
Not knowin' what's really goin' on
Nawimsayin?
These streets is a habitat baby
Word up
Pito

[Verse 1]
In the garden of snakes, ain't no breaks, no mistakes
Just games that's played at high stakes, the next guys wake
Try to fly straight, not violate if you wanna die late
The tri-state, crime at a high rate, where peoples dilate
Gun shots that make the block vibrate, it shook niggas migrate
Some die by fate, yo niggas cry hate
A fly facer get they thighs scraped
And little PUS that's why raped
A kid inside his gate, gets murdered by jake
A young nigga try ta fly capes, and get caught on the FBI tape
In verse of the State
Lost the case and gotta fry date
Ninety ninety eight, day of July eighth
Some cats get ta stack the hot papes
Live in the skyscrapes
Go ta airline, buy flyin' states
Where they can hibernate and operate
Impregnate, some chinky-eyed mate
Other niggas will lay the power race, wit tre 8's
Try to apply weight, and ready ta die staced off and dehydrate

[Hook]
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down
Son how that sound?
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down
Son how that sound?

[Verse 2]
It's like a time bomb you hit Vietnam ta Saigon
Keep your mind calm, your nine on, me hard ta find harm
Peep the crime dons rollin' wit ex-cons holdin' they out rons
And teflons ta be streets flooded wit red ponds
Like it was red dawn, bodies get found around without the heads on
Judges set bonds that figures they know niggas is dead on
What's left of death penalty facilities where niggas step on
Wit those that blew trough, go get they body filled wit electrons
The tec drawns, the ones that live foul, they're leavin' wet moms
Wit lead charms, put her ta bed wit her head drawn
Killas wit red palms leavin' bodies cool as the dead fonz
Caught in the dead wrong, found they way, ran into the feds arms
Yo

[Hook]
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down
Son how that sound?
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down
Son how that sound?

[Verse 3]
For steady cash flows, niggas'll blast you past the Astros
Blow you like afros, the little fast hoes that last all the fast dough
They splash foes, red as Tabasco, they lay your asshole where the grass grow
Runnin' wit armies like they Castro
Them Donny Brasco's get Johnny Doj around they last holes
Keepin' em half froze, put in shiny boxes rockin' they last clothes
The cash close inside your top pocket of stashed roast
Body got found down on the back roads where all the trash blows
And broken glass globes, the dip chicks slicker than gastro
Who bag a slash blow and spot some top of the block hot as a gas stove
That's Mastro's cats in the Astros
Who ain't afraid ta let they gats go
The paper dash bros lovin' the flash though
And pass mo'
Stash rolls, count em like math pros
And crash low soda, PoPo's don't step all up in they path yo
Them cats go, that's smack on the back burner, but keepin' the gas low
When task rolls they snatch his ass mows, movin' too ass slow[Missjones]
Don't you know that G Rap's straight thuggin
And you know you can't stop the shine

[Kool G Rap]
Uhh, uhh
Kool G Rap, Underworld, Illville

(Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do?)
Whattup, whattup, whattup

Uhh, uhh
Daddy Bigbucks, got the forty-five cal' tucked
Giovanni style tux, see the Cristal erupt
Be up at the bar what? Diamonds, carved and cut
The sluts get starstruck wonder if the car's what
The new BM, rimmed up, the Navigator truck
Feet be like skinned up in only gator stuff
For fly mami get hemmed up, she got the Jada cuts
These cats pushin they lens up, they can't hate enough
They countin what I spend up, already made enough
To live plush, you must eat out a fat plate of mush
Got what you lust, the Bulgari smothered with slush
Yours covered with rust, diamonds studded with dust
Mine flooded with crush, rides big as a bus
Thirty-two plus, what can you and your crew do to us
But look in disgust, plot to seize the shinin sea
From coppin the V-T-W-E-L-V-E
Pissed off at G's but we don't believe in knockin knees
We cock and squeeze, and leave some shit shot and breeze
Attractin these chicks mixed, black and japanese
And slappin these nitwits, with fat stacks of G's
Bag your rat, she should lack, grabbin the back of threes
On her knees, see more semen than all the seven seas
She goldminin, lookin for new fashion designin
Rings with rocks blindin cause my world started shinin, uhh

Chorus: missjones and G Rap

[Mj] Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do?
[GR] When you see mines and can't stop the shine
Sippin wine from up a little grapevine
Too much ice up on the wrist to tell the time
[Mj] Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do?
[GR] When you see me up in the 6 with a dime
Yeah, chicks of all kinds, mad concubines
Will you cock the nine and sneak me from behind?

[Kool G Rap]
My jet leaves, down to the beaches in the West Keys
With jet skis, only sex G's, with S-E's
And Lex G-S-3's, cheese to bless G
Baguettes be the ice makin my neck and chest freeze
Vietnamese, Tibetan G's with wet beads
In sets of three, breasts in 3-D that slept with me
The sexy, beauty of the week of the ? G's
Bangladesh G's, on the other side of the Red Sea
The lefty, sippin Remi inside the Pepsi
Jew-els shinin, holdin down what you fell behind in
Mink shit with silk linin, penetrate right through
Your hymen, handle a nine like I'm Lex Diamond
Organized crimin, bank rolls yeah we get those
Fly clothes, slip those, spot foes then we hit those
The whole click glow, click the sickoes
With the chick-o's, hit the ones with the six-oh's
Hollow tops spit those, let the dough pile
Leave no profile, drama wild leave you layin Castellano style
With ? llama cows, whole click be kinda wild
On a mission, get the death kiss end up missin

Chorus w/ variations to end
