Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Verse:
Yo. Lil girls in the city. Dress up pretty
Go out and get messed up and shitty
Girls by the sea, dress like hippies. And wear love beads and go skinny dippin'
Girls in the hills, go day trippin. To get their nails done, and hair straighten
Lil girls in the 818. Get hot when I roll over laurel canyon

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
She walk slow down the avenue
I ain't met her, but I get her when I do
Let me tell you about a girl I love
She stay at home cause she hate the club
Baby but, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her

Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Girls in New York look like giraffes
Long neck, long legs, tiny tits and ass
Girls from L.A rock oversized shades
And chill all day cause they already paid
Girls in Miami. Street bikinis
Bump techno by Dj Tiesto
Girls from Detroit Like electro. And dance all night till they break they neck, yo

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
Let me tell you about a girl I love
Let me tell you about a girl I love

Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Now if you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up
(if you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up.)
If you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love
(If you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love.)
Now if you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up
(if you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up.)
Now, if you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love, huh. And this is what I'm lookin for

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
She walk slow down the avenue
I ain't met her, but I get her when I do
Let me tell you about a girl I love
She stay at home cause she hate the club
Baby but, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her

Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your sandy beach
And if your brother don't like my style
We could could take it to the street
We could take it to the street[Hook]

I just wanna fuck tonight
Love is overrated
I dont wanna take my time
Cuz that gets complicated
And you get, you get so jaded
Please dont, please dont think were dating
I just wanna fuck tonight
Love is overrated

[Verse 1]

Raised in a trailer by the beaches
Now I got different spots all over like a cheetah
Knew this white girl, ass like bonita
But she act like she don’t wanna, when you act like you need her
Fell in love once and she cheat cheat cheated
So I fucked her best friend til she skeet skeet skeeted
Heartbroken and I won't repeat it
Ain't looking for love unless is backseated

[Bridge]

Anytime is the right time
Come alive in the night time
Body surfing high tide
All for the thrill of the ride
But I ain't looking for love
I ain't looking for love
I ain't looking for love tonight
I ain't looking for love
I ain't looking for love
I just wanna have a good time

[Hook]

La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated

[Verse 2]

Ain't no wrong way to eat it like a Reese's
And she eating adderall so she ain't really sleeping
Had her heartbroken into itty-bitty pieces
Now she in the night club straight looking for a reason
Fell in love once and he cheat cheat cheated
So she fucked his best friend, man he couldn't believe it
Got back together then it all repeated
I ain't looking for love man I dont need it

[Bridge]

Anytime is the right time
Come alive in the night time
Body surfing high tide
All for the thrill of the ride
But I ain't looking for love
I ain't looking for love

I ain't looking for love
I just wanna have a good time

La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overratedI met her at a backyard
Blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me
Like she knew who I was
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love

Bang bang, baby shot
Me in the heart, in the dark
With the dart felt the spark
When it hit
When we me at the spot
It was hot, like this song
Saw the thong, it was on
Now it's 8 in the mornin'
I move on like the Greyhound bus
I go town to town
And I prey on sluts
I got to go
So scream out your area code
I'm comin' all the way
Live from the 310!
I gotta whole lot of love
But none like you
You make me wanna stay
Here in heaven with you
I'll write your name in the sand
Put your hand with mine
Come on baby
Shoot your gun in the sky!

I met her at a backyard
Blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me
Like she knew who I was
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love

Bang bang baby hit me one time
Two days on the road
And you're still on my mind
You'd think that I would learn
Cause I'm young and fine
But I'm broke, so I'm tryin' to make
A hustle out of rhyme
I gotta see the world one girl at a time
But you're hangin' on my sleeve
Like I care that you're cryin'
And I do
I'm just tryin' to play it cool
I got a rep to protect
Down at the high school
Why you tryin' to cage me in
And when I leave we both know
That you'll be pagin' him
And when I come back
We gonn' do it again
I promise we gonn' do it again

I met her at a backyard
Blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me
Like she knew who I was
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love

Bang bang, I wanna give you my name
But I'm tryin' to put some
Diamonds in my Shwayze chain
Babies change
They start showin' them thangs
Tryin' to take a ride on
Those crazy trains
Choo choo
What the hell am I to do?
I got a girl in every city
From here to Peru
When I left you
I saw my name on your left boob
Now go get that tattoed
I'll be back soon
Don't cry, I'll bless you
With a text soon
I gotta go, but I'll
Be back next June
Or July. Sparks in the sky
She said, 'Boy you crazy.'
Nah, I'm Shwayze

I met her at a backyard
Blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me
Like she knew who I was
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love

And I don't know what she was on
Whatever it was, I want some
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love[Hook]
Do the Scrooge Mcduck, and then you dive into your money. (3x)
Call me Uncle Scrooge, cause I'm all about my money, bitch

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
I walk around town, so legit
Cause I'm makin' hits, and I own this shit
Make a lot of money, then I blow that shit
Smoke a lot of weed, cause I grow that shit
Yeah
I'll show you what a mogul is;
Just bought a jet, now I'm global bitch
Dropped off a million, at an orphanage
Yo, this is how you look in a Porsche kids
You've never seen a-
Nother nigga cleaner
Jacuzzi in my jet, and Fifa in my Beamer
Ah, Ah
Im stylin' baby, money pilin' baby
When my shits a hit I'm gonna buy another island, baby

[Hook]
Do the Scrooge Mcduck, and then you dive into your money. (3x)
Call me Uncle Scrooge, cause I'm all about my money, bitch

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
I ain't all about the money, but I'm all about the cash flow
All about the booty, cause baby, I'm an asshole
You all about comin' up, and comin' fast
Good guys finish first? I finish last
Tidal wave of money, while you other suckers duck dive
Call me Laird Hamilton, and you are just low tide
Leg steeze, wakeboard
You say you makin' money, but we makin' way more

Call me Uncle Scrooge cause I'm all about my money, bitch
Do the Scrooge Mcduck, and then you dive into your money
Evolve everyday, thats why we're fuckin' rich
Call me Uncle Scrooge, cause I'm all about my money, bitch[Hook : Devin K]
If diamonds didn't sparkle would you want em ?
If your clothes were cheap would you still flaunt em ?
If gold was only sand, would it matter in the palm of your hand ?
Ms Fortune, five hundred, she could buy anything that she wanted
And this love is free, but she'd rather have the money than me

[Verse 1 : Shwayze]
I keep on hittin refresh up on your Insta, lookin at the same picture
And if you post another, best believe I ain't gon miss it
Still thinkin bout your kissin, reminiscing on our history
I should have paid attention, in high school during history
Cause it's always gon repeat, like the hook up on this beat
Before you loved the money I could swear that you loved me
That life you lead's expensive, but my lovin is free
Anything you want you'll get it but you'll never feel complete

[Hook : Shwayze & Devin K]
If diamonds didn't sparkle would you want em ?
If your clothes were cheap would you still flaunt em ?
If gold was only sand, would it matter in the palm of your hand ?
Ms Fortune, five hundred, she could buy anything that she wanted
And this love is free, but she'd rather have the money than me

(Money over love, over love) She'd rather have the money than me (she chose money over love)
(Money over love, over love) She'd rather have the money than me (she chose money over love)

[Verse 2 : Shwayze]
Damn, that's really not feel enough
So many fish in the sea and that money's a good hook
If currency was currently about the talent
Then we wouldn't have to worry bout the commas in my balance
But when the label dropped me, all you did was copy
Trynna find the new Shway, but he's not me
I'll never be second cause second's way too sloppy
When all you did was doubt me, I just bounce back like Rocky
Don't know what you got til it's gone, hope those shopping sprees are good
Love defined in a dollar sign, I wish you understood
That life you lead's expensive, but my lovin is free
Anything you want you'll get it but you'll never feel complete

[Hook : Shwayze & Devin K]
If diamonds didn't sparkle would you want em ?
If your clothes were cheap would you still flaunt em ?
If gold was only sand, would it matter in the palm of your hand ?
Ms Fortune, five hundred, she could buy anything that she wanted
And this love is free, but she'd rather have the money than me

(Money over love, over love) She'd rather have the money than me (she chose money over love)
(Money over love, over love) She'd rather have the money than me (she chose money over love)

[Outro : Shwayze & Devin K]
Money over love, over love. She chose money over love
Money over love, over love. She chose money over love
She'd rather have the money than me
She'd rather have the money than me
But love makes you rich, don't you get it ?[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
And we all just wanna shine
Before we pass our prime
So right now it's just my time
So get your hands high
And we could wave goodbye
To my old life
We could wave goodbye
To my old life
We could wave goodbye
To my old life
We can say bye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Okay
Woke up in a bed, I ain't worried 'bout who next to me
Question marks and exclamation points will be the death of me
Never have I ever gave a fuck about the recipe
Cause everything I make these muthafuckas say is specialty
So I just, I just, cook it up and let you bask in it
Cause all I'm after is some furiously fast women
Pump the brakes and hit the gas women
I ain't thinking 'bout no class dog
I'm on my Billy Madison
I said I'm all about the green like my cars, Miss Lippy
Always with a southern chick, I never Mississippi
Always acting drunk as shit, but never getting tipsy
That's a stupid combination, like a hippy playing Frisbee
So, throw it back when you see me
The writings on the wall, and I ain't talking graffiti
Tell her that I'm a god, and I ain't talking to Shiva, Kamini
I'm on another level no Avicii
Holla at me when you see me, whoop!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
Thinking 'bout my old life
Move on to the future
Trade my dirty Converse for a brand new pair of Supras
Cause I'm super
In high school they done told me I'm a loser
Now they come to all my shows
And brag about how they new ya, hallelujah!
And they wanna bow to the kid
But I'm about to make a hundred thou' for the gig
Mutha fuckas told me I'm not allowed to be rich
Well, you one percenters, just got a different agenda
I never be the person I'm trying hard to remember
Shout out to Stacy Ferg cause she started out as a pretender
Fell in love with a girl that I met way back in September
So I spent the whole winter trying to sweat her
And they sayin' that you got it, you got it bad
Don't need no usher
Point me in the direction of how I'm able to fuck her
Trying to say goodbye, but I forgot your number
She said focus on yourself before you focus on others, shit

[Hook]

[Bridge: Shwayze]
I said bye to the old me
Getting high off the OG
Riding 'round with my homies
And you can't tell me nothing
No you can't tell me nothing
Lastly girl that you know me
Got me high when we blow trees
Never hide from the police
Cause they can't tell me nothing
No they can't tell me nothing
Naw mean?

[Hook]This is what you call real puppy love

[Hook: Cyrano]
Baby I’m not usually a shy dude
And I know we ain't in high school
No more
It’s just a little something that I wrote
(A Love letter just a little love letter)
Saying hey girl I know you don’t know me
But maybe we could chill some time
Drink a little wine
You’ll find
Everything you need's right in front of your eyes
Got me singing hey girl I know you don’t know me
And I bet you get this all the time
But I can’t lie
Every time you leave I want to press rewind
Say ay
Ay ay
I love you
(chica chica chica)
Ay
Ay ay
I love you

See what I was really trying to say was well uh

[Verse 1: Aaron Smith]
L-O-V-E is a four letter word
Shit, cause she got me looking for a better herb
Cause she get me highest
Higher than the clouds
On my flight to L.A. and I’m looking for the flyest
If love is a drug I just want to try it
One hit of her lips is like a coke diet
Can’t eat can’t sleep
I can’t silence what I feel so deep
And my heart beats
For her, and she don’t want me
But all I need is time and time is money
And I’m a grown man still just trying to be funny
But I guess this is about money
And cars
So I close my tab at the bar
So I close my tab at the bar
And just then she walked in
I had to to tell her

[Hook: Cyrano]
I’m not usually a shy dude
And I know we ain't in high school

See what I was really trying to say was well um

[Verse 2: Campa]
She’s a saint I’m a sinner
She want to drink wine I got a vineyard
I’m straight but a little off centered
And it would mean the world if you wanted to enter
I let ya up inside my
She could ride my
(stick)
Lady gaga
(ohh)
Shenana
I’m feeling good but I need her love
Cause when it all adds up
(chica chica)
A plus
And that’s real
I’ll pay for the meal
But you can do desert
I’m looking at your shirt
I’m looking at your skirt
We don’t need to flirt
Baby tell me the directions to pick you up from work
(chica chica)(aaaa)
I’m just a regular guy
Who’s getting paid
Every single day
Dancing in the rain
Bitch I’m on and I want you
I even wrote this song just to flaunt you
I love you

[Hook: Campa]
Baby I’m not usually a shy dude

(this is what you call real puppy love)[Hook : Shwayze]
And, I don't wanna lie no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna get high no more
But it's all I know, all I know, all I know

[Verse 1 : Shwayze]
Now everybody want the Shwayze flow
Let me meet your lady, be prepared to let your baby go
Beach boy, surf's up with a Jane Doe
That mean she fresh to death even in plain clothes
She a rich girl, we in a Range Rov'
She ain't my girlfriend, she my main, know
I put the CD on my back like a Jenks point
That's when I told her I'd be back and I hit the A pole
This new city is pretty, tonight we gonna party
I bet the bar, totally, is already flooded with hotties
Left my bag in the lobby, got a tequila and probably
Gonna be drunk at the show, my cutie cute, she saw me

[Hook : Shwayze]
And I don't wanna lie no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna get high no more
But it's all I know, all I know
And I can blame it on the alcohol
And take another adderall
And you're not even mad at all
Cause it's all I know, all I know, all I know

[Verse 2 : Tayyib Ali]
All these new place got me seeing hella faces
We smoking doobies with Shwayze looking at my life in HD
It's crazy how things can change
And you probably thought I'd be different but I stayed the same
Riding in my lane, looking sippy, ass licking
And I just won the bad chick with ash tits and brains mashed
Then run into me after a long day, it's how we play, it's how my grind work
In my line when you come to Philly cause I got work
I just hit the town and roam, don't know where Imma go
The music makes me feel all lonely on this rocky road
Smoke another O, I think I'm better off alone
But we just party and get drunk until the morning sun

[Hook : Shwayze]
And I don't wanna lie no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna get high no more
But it's all I know, all I know
And I can blame it on the alcohol
And take another adderall
And you're not even mad at all
Cause it's all I know, all I know, all I know

[Interlude : Shwayze]
I know that I love you
I know that I care
Yeah, I know that I want to
But I can't always be there
And now every day I'm thinking about
What would've been, what could've been
What I should've did but I didn't do
I say I'm over you but I'm missing you
An apology is overdue but this is what I do

[Hook : Shwayze]
And I don't wanna lie no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna get high no more
But it's all I know, all I know
And I can blame it on the alcohol
And take another adderall
And you're not even mad at all
Cause it's all I know, all I know, all I know

[Outro : Shwayze]
I know that I love you, I know that I care
I know that I love you, I know that I care
I know that I love you, I know that I care
I know that I want to but I can't always be thereThis heartbreak is better than most loves
Cuz even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
Even when we break up

Your hot like cashmere I dont need that beer
Drunk off your love and Im cool chilling right here
In school you never wouldve talked to me
Its cool cuz now your getting lost with me
Your body is just like an hourglass
Its crazy how quick an hour pass
Know were having fun thinking about the times we had
Cuz even when the times were bad

I can't forget it, making love in public
Let them all see, fuck it
They search the world to find something like this
Forget it, making love in public
Let them all see, fuck it
They search the world to find something like this

Heartbreak is better than most loves
Cuz even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
This heartbreak is better than most loves
Cuz even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
Even when we break up

She like her man happy, tatted, ashy to classy
Knew she was the one right when she walked past me
Take a hand baby lets get out of here
Black man, your daddy's worst nightmare
Crazy, but you want it like I want it baby
Im coming for your love
Think about the times we had cuz even when the times were bad

I can't forget it, making love in public
Let them all see, fuck it
They search the world to find something like this
Forget it, making love in public

Making out in public
My chick is high so fuck it
Who are they to judge us
Partying for days now
Baby lets just lay down
Who are they to judge us
They just mad cuz they ain't us

They search the world to find something like this
Heartbreak is better than most loves
Cuz even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
Even when we break up
This heartbreak is better than most loves
Cuz even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
Even when we break up girl[Verse 1]

I wasn't raised in the city lights
I didn't come from struggle
I got a pretty wife, wassup baby I love you
Im a good guy but I stay in trouble
Music gave me life, Malibu made me humble
Kids driving Jags in the twelfth grade
I take a drag celebrating that Im self made
You could do anything, just put your mind to it
The way she move that thing I think there ain't no spine to it
I like to grind through it, fine tune it
Bump to the beat then I rhyme to it
Her body dumb, mind stupid
But when she give me brain, she like a Harvard student
Its a little past noon down in little Dune
Hawaiian suntan looking beautiful
When you see me say wassup, I say the usual
Eyes low kickin' flows in the studio

[Hook]

All this gold on me got me feeling like Bolt
Fuck moving fast, Im just tryna take it slow
Ain't think about the past cuz its all up in smoke
So Im raising up my glass, toast to the west coast
City views to the palm trees
I just wanna bad bitch and some bomb weed
West coast, west coast, plenty booze and its all free
I just wanna bad bitch and some bomb weed

[Verse 2 - Sky Blu]

Im a shining star dreaming of a brighter day
Where I can go through the meditation is my hideaway
Mind elevation, getting paid off creation
While all you suckas hating me and Shwayze rocking aces
There is a method to my madness, opposite of sadness
Sometimes its weed, sometimes its a bad bitch
Sometimes its giving somebody hungry a sandwich
The world is so cruel man I dont understand it
People doubted me, people doubted me
By any means necessary I will succeed
Its in my DNA, its what I breathe its what I bleed
And bringing the world together is the legacy I lead
Grew up a skateboarder by the beach
Always gazed at the stars so I decided to reach
LMFAO, everyday I see my dream
And my message to you is just believe

[Hook]

All this gold on me got me feeling like Bolt
Fuck moving fast, Im just tryna take it slow
Ain't think about the past cuz its all up in smoke
So Im raising up my glass, toast to the west coast
City views to the palm trees
I just wanna bad bitch and some bomb weed
Plenty booze and its all free
I just wanna bad bitch and some bomb weed

All this gold on me got me feeling like Bolt
Fuck moving fast, Im just tryna take it slow
Ain't think about the past cuz its all up in smoke
So Im raising up my glass, toast to the west coast
City views to the palm trees
I just wanna bad bitch and some bomb weed
Plenty booze and its all free
I just wanna bad bitch and some bomb weedI know you hear me on the radio
And you see me in my video
And now your trying to play me like a stereo
You got me blowin up your phone

You givin me butterflies, butterflies again
You givin me butterflies, butterflies again
Something about your lovin caught me by surprise
Oh yeah, you givin me butterflies, butterflies, butterflies again

Sweeter than an M&M
Remember when you took me swimming
In your summer house in the sands
Was in the air we were both 16 then
But you looked 23 sick in the one piece
Dumb me had to take it to the friends’ zone
Up, up all night talking on the phone
If I never told you then you didn’t know
As you never really know till its really gone
Really down on the full-ride scholarship
Kill me now on the bus down Hollywood
Writing songs about you and how I wish I could
And you were here right now then you knew I would
Playing shows so we’re blowing up the dope
Catch myself talking about you every now and then
Last out Philly, pulled up to the DLA
Turned around and I saw your face

You givin me butterflies, butterflies again
You givin me butterflies, butterflies again
Something about your lovin caught me by surprise
Oh yeah, you givin me butterflies, butterflies, butterflies again

Chilling out by the pool on a summer day
Still reminding me of you in some sort of way
‘Cause you’re cooler than a tall glass of lemonade
And your hotter than the sunshine, baby, when you shine for me
Don’t you ever say I settle for less
I would never have sex if it would give you a bad rep
Give me a kiss on the cheek
And I won’t wash it off till I see you next week
Because I’m love stoned that’s what your doin to me
If you must know, I see you in my dreams
And my hunchback got my head on my knees
Baby please tell me is this make believe
Or is it real life? What’s the difference?
I know it can all change in an instant
For instance when you made your entrance
You changed me now its all we did

You givin me butterflies, butterflies again
You givin me butterflies, butterflies again
Something about your lovin caught me by surprise
Oh yeah, you givin me butterflies, butterflies, butterflies again

I know you hear me on the radio
And you see me in my video
And now your trying to play me like a stereo
You got me blowin up your phone
But you sill won’t answer it
You smoke your cancer stick
Sit around, think about the things we did
Wishin we were kids
Chasin those butterflies, butterflies again
Chasin those butterflies, butterflies again

You givin me butterflies, butterflies again
You givin me butterflies, butterflies again
Something about your lovin caught me by surprise
Oh yeah, you givin me butterflies, butterflies, butterflies again
You givin me butterflies, butterflies again…I met her at a backyard
Blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me
Like she knew who I was
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love

Bang bang, baby shot
Me in the heart, in the dark
With the dart felt the spark
When it hit
When we me at the spot
It was hot, like this song
Saw the thong, it was on
Now it's 8 in the mornin'
I move on like the Greyhound bus
I go town to town
And I prey on sluts
I got to go
So scream out your area code
I'm comin' all the way
Live from the 310!
I gotta whole lot of love
But none like you
You make me wanna stay
Here in heaven with you
I'll write your name in the sand
Put your hand with mine
Come on baby
Shoot your gun in the sky!

I met her at a backyard
Blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me
Like she knew who I was
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love

Bang bang baby hit me one time
Two days on the road
And you're still on my mind
You'd think that I would learn
Cause I'm young and fine
But I'm broke, so I'm tryin' to make
A hustle out of rhyme
I gotta see the world one girl at a time
But you're hangin' on my sleeve
Like I care that you're cryin'
And I do
I'm just tryin' to play it cool
I got a rep to protect
Down at the high school
Why you tryin' to cage me in
And when I leave we both know
That you'll be pagin' him
And when I come back
We gonn' do it again
I promise we gonn' do it again

I met her at a backyard
Blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me
Like she knew who I was
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love

Bang bang, I wanna give you my name
But I'm tryin' to put some
Diamonds in my Shwayze chain
Babies change
They start showin' them thangs
Tryin' to take a ride on
Those crazy trains
Choo choo
What the hell am I to do?
I got a girl in every city
From here to Peru
When I left you
I saw my name on your left boob
Now go get that tattoed
I'll be back soon
Don't cry, I'll bless you
With a text soon
I gotta go, but I'll
Be back next June
Or July. Sparks in the sky
She said, 'Boy you crazy.'
Nah, I'm Shwayze

I met her at a backyard
Blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me
Like she knew who I was
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love

And I don't know what she was on
Whatever it was, I want some
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love[Cisco]
Cali' Trippin' and I think my mind is slippin' away
Cali' Trippin' and I'm wishin' I was back in LA

[Shwayze]
Once apon a time, I wrote a lil' rhyme
About a pretty girl, she was in her prime
I'm a skinny boy, in my skinny jeans
And mini-me was poppin out my corduroys
She was a dime, I ain't have a nickel
But I had jokes, so I made her giggle
And her folks were very influential
So when I smoked that adam made her feel like a bad girl
But she's a good girl, in a bad world
So I felt bad for corrupting her
Not really, but her dad would kill me
So I told her we had to slow it down

She said: I wanna Rock (I wanna Rock)
And roll a joint, and get high (And get high)
Don't talk, just vibe
Let's get in the ride, and just drive

If you got nothing good to say
Then don't say shit
And it's always easier to forget
We cali' trippin', you gotta love it
And ain't nothing wrong with making out in public

[Cisco]
Taking pictures of girls on a trip around the world
And it, just reminds me of everything I miss back home
Cali' trippin' and I think my mind is slippin' away
Cali' trippin' and I'm wishin' I was back in LA

[Shwayze]
She was so fine, but she was out of mind
Goin' full speed, crash on the autobon
She get what she wants, she get it from her mom
And her dad show us love with the credit card
Where do I fit in? I'm the token black
With a coke and jack, lookin' for the right girl
The reason that I'm loving you, is the way that you do you

I wanna Rock (I wanna Rock)
And roll a joint, and get high (And get high)
Don't talk, just vibe
Let's get in the ride, and just drive

If you got nothing good to say
Then don't say shit
And it's always easier to forget
We cali' trippin', you gotta love it
And ain't nothing wrong with making out in public

[Cisco]
Taking pictures of girls on a trip around the world
And it, just reminds me of everything I miss back home
Cali' trippin' and I think my mind is slippin away

[Shwayze]
I'm Cali' Trippin', I'm Cali' Trippin'
I'm Cali' Trippin', I'm Cali' Trippin'
I'm Cali' Trippin', I'm Cali' Trippin'
Cali' Trippin' Baby, Cali' Trippin' yeah
Cali' Trippin' Baby, Cali' Trippin' yeah
Cali' Trippin' Baby, Cali' Trippin' yeah
Cali' Trippin' Baby, Cali' Trippin'

I wanna Rock (I wanna Rock)
And roll a joint, and get high (And get high)

(Ain't nothin wrong wit making out in public)
(Wishin' I was back in LA)
(Ain't nothin wrong wit makin out in public)
(Wishin' I was back in LA)
(Ain't nothing wrong wit makin out in public)

I like the way the chain sits, between her bra and tits
Takin' bong hits with her and I'm on assist
I must admit she got me on that sprung shit
I can't deny she got me on that young shit
It's all good cause she got my back
Like a JanSport backpack culdesec
It's funny cause we both used to ditch class
The kiss in the back of the cabbage patch
Rat-a-tat-tat on the window pane
Outside lookin' in but I won't complain
Too many highs turn down the game
And don't be surprised when I say that name
In vain, Cali-forn-i-aYeah
Wait a minute

Operator, on the line. I need your help. I got a girl to find
I got her number but I ain't got a dime
And I really wanna tell her that its real this time

Yeah
Ill admit, Im a generous degenerate
Got jokes like Degeneres, but this time its cereal
What if I told you I just wanted to hold you?
Im not the old me, youre not the old you
People grow like they're supposed to
We should go be bicostal
Sleep under the stars
Its all undecided till you pick up my call
(Pick up my call, girl)

Please!
[Chorus]
Its the middle of the night
And I call your phone
I lost mine so I dial zero and say
Collect, collect call
Collect, collect call
Will you accept my collect call?

Operator, on the line, I really think shes gonna pick up this time
(Sir, you have to stop. I said if you dont we have to call the cops)
I ain't stalking
And theres nothing wrong with two people talking but Im out of tokens
Help me
Im broke and lonely
Dont hang up on me

[Chorus x2]

Sittin here waching time move like a snail
Cause its the 3rd time in three years that Im in jail
Im callin you

[Chorus x2]Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Verse:
Yo. Lil girls in the city. Dress up pretty
Go out and get messed up and shitty
Girls by the sea, dress like hippies. And wear love beads and go skinny dippin'
Girls in the hills, go day trippin. To get their nails done, and hair straighten
Lil girls in the 818. Get hot when I roll over laurel canyon

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
She walk slow down the avenue
I ain't met her, but I get her when I do
Let me tell you about a girl I love
She stay at home cause she hate the club
Baby but, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her

Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Girls in New York look like giraffes
Long neck, long legs, tiny tits and ass
Girls from L.A rock oversized shades
And chill all day cause they already paid
Girls in Miami. Street bikinis
Bump techno by Dj Tiesto
Girls from Detroit Like electro. And dance all night till they break they neck, yo

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
Let me tell you about a girl I love
Let me tell you about a girl I love

Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Now if you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up
(if you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up.)
If you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love
(If you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love.)
Now if you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up
(if you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up.)
Now, if you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love, huh. And this is what I'm lookin for

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
She walk slow down the avenue
I ain't met her, but I get her when I do
Let me tell you about a girl I love
She stay at home cause she hate the club
Baby but, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her

Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your sandy beach
And if your brother don't like my style
We could could take it to the street
We could take it to the street[Verse 1]
I was born to rock, learned to walk in flip flops
And I bought my clothes at the local thrift shop
I wouldn't be late if I looked at the clock
But I'd rather spend time than by a wrist watch
Zip-lock keep it fresh. Red Hot Chili Pep
Dread lock rosta
I was high when we met, but I remember everything from your eyes to your dress
Sun rise on the east when it sets on the west side
Let the guitar play. Yeah, let's vibe
Forget the bad days, think about the good times
The Pimp C's at the Hollywood go, where is my mind?
I just don't know
Life goes so fast then it goes too slow
Had to join a band to discover the flow
But ay yo I got two tickets to the rock show
Dead center front row

[Hook: Cisco]
I wanna take you out to the rock show baby
Make you understand what makes me
And if you want I will go crazy for you
(if you wanna go crazy girl) oh oh (then you can be my baby girl)

[Verse 2]
Before I drove I walked, kicking rocks in the park
Kick flip and drop shooting hoops on the black top
I still remember when the joints were skinny
Way before I had a penny and Lenny chopped his dread locks
Late night, I listened to the tape box till the daylight come and
I break off to find a girl so I could sing a love song in her ear
And tell her where we go from here
Get the guitar baby play let's drop
Forget the bad days, think about the good times
Make love every night like the first night
And dance in the sand, like its our birth right
Live it up cause it may not last
Life goes too slow then it goes too fast
Had to see the future to discover the past
So if you wanna go here's a backstage pass

[Chrous: Cisco]
I wanna take you out to the rock show baby
Make you understand what makes me
And if you want I will go crazy for you
(if you wanna go crazy girl) oh oh (then you can be my baby girl)
I wanna take you out to the rock show baby
Make you understand what makes me
And if you want I will go crazy for you
Oh oh (yeah you could be my baby girl)
I wanna take you out to the rock show baby
Make you understand what makes me
And if you want I will go crazy for you
Oh oh. oh ooooh ohhhh
If you want I will go crazy
If you want I will go crazy
If you want I will go crazy for youuuuu
Oh ooooh ohhhhUh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Certainly you should be filled with uncertainty
For 13 years I've been hurtin girls purposely
I've been called a worthless freak a jerk and a cheat
Cause I turn the other cheek after we fuck for a week
Stop crying you know that I done learn from these mistakes that I've made
But the past keeps burnin me like meatheads with cigarettes or freshmens in fraternities
But Shwayze say how bout burnin' herbal trees with purple leaves

I'm sorry that I hurt your heart
But that's just the part that you're playin' in my autobiography
I'm sorry that I did you wrong
I promise that I'll write a song
And play it for you as my apology

[Chrous: Cisco]
We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon' dance in the sand tonight
We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon' dance in the sand tonight

[Verse 2]
You know what, maybe girl. You wasn't meant to be my baby girl
Shwayze's just a player and my stage is his crazy world
But lately lovely I've been thinking of you all the time
All my friends say I gotta put it all far behind
But I don't mind they just jealous you get all my time
I saw the signs you my ace of bass
Damn you fine
You got Shwayze shakin' the rattle
Crying like a baby Cause I'm sleepless in Seattle
While you in Hollywood
Longs legs short skirt
Tellin' all the dudes how you made my feelings hurt

[Chrous: Cisco]
We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon' dance in the sand tonight
We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon' dance in the sand tonight

Dance in the sand
We gonna dance in the sand

[Verse 3]
Dance in the sand
Like a street fighting Sam
Yes am I what I am
What I am is a man
We gonna dance in the sand
Dance in the sand tonight
Dance in the sand cause we ain't got a plan
Two peas in a pod you and I me and you
And love is a bitch
Let's hold hands. Let's get rich
Romance in the stone
Make a home outta house
Build a rome in a day
You know what they say
Every pimp needs a ho and lady

We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon'dance in the sand tonight
(Every pimp needs a ho)
We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon' dance in the sand tonight
(every pimp needs a ho)Woke up in the morning and I rolled myself a joint
I had something to tell you but I forgot so what's the point
Must have been a lie
That's what my mother said
Every now and then there's going to be daze like this

If good guys finish last then I'm bad. I'm trying to take you to the pad
Black James Dean on a moped
No cigarettes nah
I got the big bam booze with the weed instead
And I always got a helmet on my head
Bad girls go fast slow up and crash
Baby on top like a ball of hash
Nino don't stop till he gets the ass
Half full but not half bad
And I really don't want to make you sad girl
But I gotta be on my way

Woke up in the morning and I rolled myself a joint
I had something to tell you but I forgot so what's the point
Must have been a lie
That's what my mother said
Every now and then there's going to be daze like this
Oh yeah daze like this
I'm in a daze like this
Daze like this
Momma said there'd be daze like this
Momma said there'd be daze like this

It's 8pm two girls pull up in a grey BMW
Like Shwayze we in love with you
They said we got your CD for Christmas
Do you wanna have a threesome with us?
It could be a dream but I don't want it to end
Opened up the back door and I hopped in
Women and weed over bitches and guns
I ain't from the hood

Woke up in the morning and I rolled myself a joint
I had something to tell you but I forgot so what's the point
Must have been a lie
That's what my mother said
Every now and then there's going to be daze like this
Daze like this
I'm in a daze like this
Momma said there'd be daze like this
Momma said there'd be daze like this

Pulled up to the club with no cash
Like I'm doing cannonballs with no splash
But I pulled a ten
And I'll do it again
I dunno it might be the mustache
And you never gonna know if you must ask
But my new CD is a must have
I'm about the quality not the price tag
Better have a nice brain with that nice ass

Woke up in the morning and I rolled myself a joint
I had something to tell you but I forgot so what's the point
Must have been a lie
That's what my mother said
Every now and then there's going to be daze like this
Daze like this
I'm in a daze like this
Hey hey hey hey

Dirty little girl in her dirty little life
Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind
Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies
My dirty little girl (girl) (get dirty!)
Sure cleans up nice

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Yeah, high fashion, trash on the street
Studio apartment, Penthouse Suite
High Class, low life freak, but shit goes on like O-Bla-Di
Day and night she walk to the beat, no sleep and you gotta eat
Shake it like a tambourine, lemme taste it, little tangerine

Some girls like movie stars, some girls like cash and cars
Some girls like champagne, some girls like caviar
Some girls like other things, dont need no diamond rings
All my dirty girls sing:

[Hook:]
Dirty little girl in her dirty little life
Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind
Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies
My dirty little girl (girl)
Sure cleans up nice

[Verse 2: Joey]
Yo, appetite for destruction she downtown hipster (?) and I'm Johnny Rotten
She's too punk for Manolo, we rock more plaid than a cholo and only roll dolo
I gotta left part, down for a solo, for you front stage, and no time for a no show
See I merely know your post in weights
(?) like cobra snake, um
You're the best
Thinking about you in the freeze frame, fashion
You're something like a frozen Kate Moss
Trapped in the glass
And all I really wanna do is tap that ass
Cause
Some girls like other things, dont need no diamond rings
Now all my dirty girls sing:

[Hook:] (x2)
Dirty little girl in her dirty little life
Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind
Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies
My dirty little girl (girl)
Sure cleans up nice

[Verse 3: Krispy]
In the verse, something mysterious, she looking better in the leather, I'm curious
How you got that ass..from your mom? I knew it. Face bomb, body and your mind, I blew it
Thin tight, them jeans skin tight
Finna bump that ass above the rib like
Cobay booty bubble like Rose
Them haters can't see me I'm the man with no face
Screwdrivers, vodka and OJ
Fresh prophylactic, the one with the gold papes
That's my dime chick, so even when we fuss, we make up
Hotter on her nose with no blush
Some girls like other things, dont need no diamond rings
All my dirty girls sing:

My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

[Hook:]
Dirty little girl in her dirty little life
Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind
Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies
My dirty little girl (girl)
Sure cleans up nice

[Outro:]
Hi, welcome to the Motel Sss....Ahh, Fuck
If it isn't Cheech and Chong
Well listen, if you're gonna stay here, I'm gonna need an $800 deposit this time
It took us two fucking days to get the weed smell out of that place
I'm not even gonna get started on the sheetsCome, come summertime
Love, love hold my hand
Come, come summertime
Love, love take a ride with me

Sweet little nectarine
Sit down next to me
Take a load off, Annie
I think you’re beautiful

Do-ah-diddy-diddy-dum-diddy-do
When the moon is full, I’ll be a wolf
Howl at you and growl at you
Ladybugs and flowers, too
I want to go out with you

I’m just a kid, living a dream
Slid in the scene like an old pair of jeans
You know my name, but you don’t know me
Wanna go out with me? Show me

Come, come summertime
Love, love, hold my hand
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don’t be shy
Come, come summertime
Love, love, take a ride with me
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don’t be shy

Black smoke billow out the black tinted window
In my black limousine as I ride through the ghetto

She wore blush, it gave me a rush
She was a lush, I gave her a touch on the tush
I gave her a push on the bed
And we smushed our lips together
Like blue and yellow, we made a green meadow
Chilled together forever, real mellow
She fell in love, I had her at hello
I couldn’t say goodbye, she was too special

Come, come summertime
Love, love hold my hand
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don’t be shy
Come, come summertime
Love, love take a ride with me
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don’t be shy

All my ladies, put your hands in the sky for me babies
And say my name, they call me Shwayze
Turn it up, turn it up, Play me
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up

Black smoke billow out the black tinted window
In my black limousine as I ride through the ghetto
(Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up)

Come, come summertime
Love, love, hold my hand
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don’t be shy
Come, come summertime

It's 6 AM and I'm drinkin' a brew
6:45 still thinkin' of you
Thinkin who, wanna give they love to you
Better than the only black kid in the 'bu ?
I ain't from the hood but my rap is good
Knocked three times on the cadillac wood
Kid got luck like a rabbits foot
Shit is good yeah shit is good
Chillin in the sand with my video cam
Swallowed the benzodiazipan
Sports illustrated model gettin' tan
Said "damn Shwayze you kinda like the man"
Yeah I am and I'm big in Japan
My pick in my hair and my dick in my hand
What would you do with a hundred grand?
Shit, id buy a fresh ass benz

Chorus
When she walked in that club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

Left the club when it's light outside
She sing along to my songs in the ride
"It's alright we can call it a night"
I said politely eventhough it didn't sound right
She said "yeah right"
I said "damn straight"
I know a place where we can get down babe
I got a blanky
I'll lay it on the sand sand
I went deep like the God damn Grand Can
Grand slam, bacon and the ham
She was a fan that turned to a friend
But now I think I love her since I took her to bed
She shook up my head
Took all my time
Spent all my money on diamonds and wine
What would you do with a hundred grand?
Shit I'd spend it all on a girl man
What would you do with a hundred grand?
Shit i'd buy a fresh ass benz

Chorus
When she walked in that club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

When she walked in the club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

You got a light? Boy I got a spliff
Gotta split got a life to live
I gotta get gotta write some shit
On the tip of my tongue just like a kiss
I might miss but I might just hit
And if I do I'm a be hella rich
And I'll get a way finer bitch
So you better be nice sweet lips
And I might just buy you a benz

Chorus
When she walked in thst club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

When she walked in the club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

When she walked in the club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

When she walked in the club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lightsShe look like sex, drugs, rock and roll
When she move it on the dance floor
Stop, go, stop and go
Like a New York cab yo
Fast, slow, fast and slow
She drives me mad yo
Just like my nano
She shuffling, I’m lovin’ it

I’m thinking about touchin’ it
Kissin’ her in public
But baby got me fumblin’
Stumblin’, and mumblin’
She got me wonderin’
If I should get her number then
She just looked up at me and said

Take me in the bathroom
Take my clothes off
Make love to me up against a dirty wall
‘Cause I can’t wait to get you home (wait to get you home)

She tastes like cigarettes and alcohol
Up all night on aderoll
Innocent, but not at all
She my Brooklyn Barbie doll
Dancin’ like (mmm), fakin’ like (ohhh)
What you think about sex on the first night? (okay)

I’m thinking about touchin’ it
Kissin’ her in public
But baby got me fumblin’
Stumblin’, and mumblin’
She got me wonderin’
If I should get her number then
I just looked at her instead (I said)

Take me in the bathroom
Take my clothes off
Make love to me up against a dirty wall
‘Cause I can’t wait to get you home (wait to get you home)
Take me out the back door
Take my clothes off
Make love to me up against somebody’s car
‘Cause I can’t wait to get you home (wait to get you home)

She was a waitress
Wait, she was an actress
I, dimmed like a starlet, in fact she was a harlot
Her lips like Scarlet, Johansson
They part to say I’m handsome
I start to say I know
That’s when she pulled out my handgun (bam)

Take me in the bathroom
Take my clothes off
Make love to me up against a dirty wall
‘Cause I can’t wait to get you home (wait to get you home)
Take me out the back door
Take my clothes off
Make love to me up against somebody’s car

‘Cause I can’t wait to get you
‘Cause I can’t wait to get you homeBaby come along with me
To a land of fantasy
Where the good things are free
And everybody's smiling
Come along with me
To where the sun meets the sea
California, California, land of golden dreams

Pair of dice and a pair of eyes
Kill me now but I don't wanna die till I see you smile
Cryin tears of joy on the green mile
But I'm gonna stop now cause that just ain't my style
It's goin down like the Dow Jones
Soccer moms and town homes
Nuke and new cal zones
Kid's skippin school cause they on that home grown
Dad a alien straight ET phone home
No po bono high school yo just wanna bone hoes
I was the high fool all stoned in the photos
Chillin on the beach, solo dolo
Kick off my sneaks, watch the world in slow mo

Another year goes bye, priorities change
The tide comes in and takes us away
Sometimes stranger ain't such a bad thing
I look at them and say

Baby come along with me
To a land of fantasy
Where the good things are free
And everybody's smilin
Come along with me
To where the sun meets the sea
California, California, land of golden dreams

It's all good like I knew it would
I'll be your tour guide if you come to Hollywood
Black Jhonny Depp slept on the pirate ship
Woke up with a chick she was hot as shit
Cruisin down sunset in the palasay
Smilie face thinkin what would your daddy say
You and I blend together like a puree
Palm trees, bomb weed there's no other way
We ain't models but we sittin on the runway
Hit that bottle and we make a clean getaway
Don't worry babe, it's just another vacay
Tell your momma we be back again another day

Another year goes bye, priorities change
The tide comes in and takes us away
Sometimes stranger ain't such a bad thing
I look at them and say

So baby come along with me
To a land of fantasy
Where the good things are free
And everybody's smilin
Come along with me
To where the sun meets to sea
California, California, land of golden dreams

California, California, land of golden dreams

Hey Cali baby, will you be my sugar honey
I do it from the heart so it ain't about the money
And if I got you it's a rap like a mummy
I get goosebumps every time you say you love me cause

You make me feel like love for the first time
You make me feel like eternal sunshine

Come along with me
To a land of fantasy
Where the good things are free
And everybody's smilin
Come along with me
To where the sun meets the sea
California, California, land of golden dreams

California, California, land of golden dreamsYeah

[Verse 1 - Shwayze]
I know a place where the hearts dont break
The reality is scripted and the boobs are fake
The smell of success is sold like inscents
And pump through the vents of your mercedes-benz
And all my friends are almost famous
Making sex tapes to get on the a-list
Trynna get their faces on the tabloid pages
So they can get paid to party in vegas
And rehab and then its off to rehab and a 22 million dollar malibu beach pad
I seen that the ways these girls on the scene that
When they first show up
Trynna blow up you know what these little girls better grow up
Before they sniff and spend all their dough up
O.D. choke on they throw up
In the hotel california

[Hook - Cisco]
I know a little place we can go right down the road
The lights are always on
The bar is never closed
I know a little place we can go right down the road
But nothing good is free
It'll cost you your heart and your soul

[Verse 2 - Shwayze]
I know a place on the sunset strip
Where all the beautiful ladies like to undress quick
And if you gotta nice whip
And come pick up the check
You can get your dick wet by a young rocket
Sex money and fame in los angeles
Its a place where a pretty face get you access
To the access of the young and the reckless
Another scratch on the bumper of my lexus
New kid in town is the next big thing
And she sing like a bird if your pitch corrected
Little pop star headed for the top now
In the fast lane with the top down
Too late for the brakes can't stop now
Wild child call for your mom now
Screamin' out there's no place like home
And then she spend another night alone

[Hook - Cisco]
I know a little place we can go right down the road
The lights are always on
The bar is never closed
I know a little place we can go right down the road
But nothing good is free
It'll cost you your heart and your soul

[Verse 3 - Shwayze]
Its ashame how the money and fame
Gotta pretty young thang goin' out with a bang
Gettin' used up so beat and bruised up
The same ol' shit come later come sooner
Nuthin' new just a diferent case
She dissappeared in a year no sign no trace
Got caught up in the pace leather and lace
Got addicted after just one taste
She made an entrance lit up the place
With a thousand flashes goin' off in her face
She couldn't take it the fame stripped her naked
Taken over by the need to make it
Sleepin' with the agents to get a start
Sleepin' with directors to get the part
Sleepin' pills and alcohol
I seen it all in the valley of the dogs

[Hook - Cisco]
I know a little place we can go right down the road
The lights are always on
The bar is never closed
I know a little place we can go right down the road
But nothing good is free
It'll cost you your heart and your soul(Chorus)
If you got the weed
I got the pipe
We ca get high together all night
If you got the weed I got the light
We can get high together all night

9:45 work start at 10
So it look like im callin in sick again
Id rather get some herbs
And kick it with my friends
Hit the beach
And treat it like a weekend
Me and Jen ain't really speakin
So baby girl come over this instant
Got a new ride so fuck the speed limit
I live by the w's: weed n women
I live on the beach down the street from cheech
I can't buy you a drink and its not that im cheap
Im jus broke ma to let you know
But somehow I always got some weed to smoke
And if I dont ill still get you high
With my love under the moon sky
21 years young got a limited time
Cuz we livin to die
So im livin it right

(chorus)

It was saturday
Took her to a play it was the matinae
I didn't even pay her
The daddy say that he dont like my ways
Probably because I hit her 3 times a day dropped her off late with a sticky face
So a kiss on the cheek is your mistake
Drivin down PCH with a smile on my face
And a blunt in my ash tray cute chick on my side and the ass is great
Almost outa gas so we hit the bank
Ain't been payed so I told her thanks
When she lent me the card and filled my tank
Yeah she in the sceen yada yada
With the Ksubi jeans sidekick and the purse
Alexander McQueen I got ripped t-shirt and some brand new kicks but you know they ain't clean[Intro : Shwayze]
Hey have you ever kissed your lady ?
And her lips taste like dick ?
Well yeah, there there, that's my dick, man !

[Verse 1 : Shwayze]
Oh you think you found love ? Ahah, congratulations !
We just finished playing when y'all first started dating
She ain't even with me but my name up on the dandy
She don't want come with me, she don't wanna cum with me
She just want me to eat her when I come to her city
She a gold getter, so she come get me at the W, smoking W
She ain't in love with you, she in love with Shway

[Verse 2 : Sky Blu]
Oh shit, he with my old bitch
Starin' cause she miss me and he know it
She hit me on text, said she wanna sex
I said no. But you can blow it, haha !
Don't fall in love in the clump nigga, uh
She only fuckin with the a-lister
I took her and her sister, fucked 'em in the pits
When she came out, and kissed her

[Hook]
How my dick taste ? Mother fucker
Walkin with my old bitch in the club
How my dick taste ? You stupid mother fucker
Now your dumbass is in love, AH !

[Verse 3 : Riff Raff]
Uh, yo, uh ! Yo, uh, yo !
Put her in a sleep, sleep
Like the grim reeper, reeper
Dropped my last bitch cause it's not cheaper to keep
Strang a street sweeper, put her in the bleachers
Playin' this game, charge it to the VISA
Let in two-seaters, might buy a piece a pizza
Maybe paint pretty pictures, red-gang Mona Lisa
Pay me I'm buy myself, I leave with my health
Vasachi on my maximill, one more notch up on my bed
No time for these haters, I'm dodging earth quakers
Swing blade through our shred, the crocodile Dundee never gate 'em
In this game, game, I wanna leave like David Stern
You girlfriend like a doorknob, everybody had a turn

[Hook]
How my dick taste ? Mother fucker
Walkin with my old bitch in the club
How my dick taste ? You stupid mother fucker
Now your dumbass is in love, AH !

[Outro 1 : Riff Raff]
How my dick taste ? Mother fucker...
How my dick taste ? Fucker... Fucker...

[Outro 2]
Oh shit, I figured it out !
The bitch can't talk cause my dick in her mouth
Don't kiss her ! Yeah, don't kiss her ! YeahSome say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us

Ay yo
What the hell am I rhyming for
Designer clothes and designer whores
Designer cars and designer doors
Designer kitchen with designer drawers
Hell no, vagina dog
The other shit bore me like a monologue
Like The Beatles when they were bigger then Jesus
I'm genius Bill Clinton were my speeches
Look you in the eye and lie
Believe it, I mean it
Girl I'm leaving
I don't really know where I'm gonna go
But I got a backpack full of demos
I'm a player baby, I should run for mayor maybe
The way I'm politicking lately
The way I'm politicking ladies
The way I'm politicking ladies

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us

I'm convinced that if I hop the fence
I can climb on in and get my fingerprints on your booty, julie
I know you wanna do me
Since I moved to malibu from the hood like a movie
Peoples chant with my sneakers in the sand
Blowing up like an amp so they kicked me out the band
That's when I met my man strummin on a six string drink in his hand talking to his ding-a-ling

Whys everybody always picking on me
Whys everybody always picking on me
Whys everybody always picking on me
Whys everybody still coming to my party

Everybody coming to my party (background)

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us

Everybody coming to my party
It starts today
We getting naughty by 9
So don't be late
There's gonna be a line
So prepare to wait
Fine fine ladies first
And bring your ice skates
And bring your wings
We all getting high tonight
And touching things
Muffin butt blowing cigarette rings

Everybody coming to my party x4

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
