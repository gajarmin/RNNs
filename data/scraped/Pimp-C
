[3-2]
Mama put me out at only fourteen
So I start sellin crack cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper, I gotta do it quick
Thinkin I'm a juvenile but they don't know who they messin wit, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live every day like its my muthafuckin last one
Every nigga and they mama askin why
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'm a die
And if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the Come N Go
Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penitentiary
So I'm a take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin crack and pack two clips
And when ya think about that you say "it'll be on"
It's a trip you're here today but the next day you're gone

[Hook][x4]
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone

[Bun B]
This world we livin in, man it ain't nothing but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya
In New York niggas gettin shot for bombers
Now they got your life in the palm of they hand like California
Niggas with dubs of hydroponic marijuana
Gangbangin got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my nigga Pots died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died wish it was twice man
I remember being eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin us act bad not giving a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin to the end
And I had to quit lettin that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen for damn near ten
But now it look like when he come out man I'm goin in
So shit I walk around with my mind blown in my own fuckin zone
Cause one day you're here, the next day you're gone

One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone (repeat)

[Pimp C]
I'm up early cause ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets and sold these chickens 'fo the clock strike nine
Big nut holder my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin shife so I look shife back
Can't show no weakness with these bitches get your life jacked
Man it's a trip where I stay especially for me
Them bitches trying to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga Donny 40, Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I ain't no liar
My man BoBo just lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked God, "Why You let these killas live and take my homeboy's son away?"
Man if you got kids, show em you love em cause God just might call em home
Cause one day they're here and baby the next day they're gone[Intro: Pimp C]
Yeah, coming down
Dedicated to them boys riding slab

[Hook]
I fli-, I flips down the Ave
Know I'm looking good
I'm banging "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I flip down the Ave., you know I'm looking tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine, nigga never do that
Who say he going through a thang, when y'all ain't never lied
I gotta baby, but his mama act like he ain't mine
Wicked women, using children to live on
Wanna hurt and try to hate, cause she know the thrill is gone
Wanna hurt and try to hate, cause she know the thrill is gone
Say man, I stopped smoking wit' haters back in ninety-four
But niggas thinking that a Sweet gong get him through my door
But niggas talk alotta shit, in a safe place
I know cause he can't look me eye-to-eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my beats, and see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, ain't all what it look like
So I keep swanging, out here clanging tryna live my life

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I see these niggas and days, go and come
And for me, just to wake, I know I'm blessed
I grab my 'ses and split my Swisher wit' my thumb
Some of my Sweets be tight, now some of my Sweets be fucked up!
But alla' my Sweets gon' blow, so killa' smoke get sucked up!
I looked up today, and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say, tomorrow they won't be blasting this-a-way
I'm puffin' spliff's of hay, still upset about the drama here
At this time of year, I'm wiping away my dead homies mama tears (Shit)
But naturally, them fucking laws was always after me
So I have to be, in that manor on that five-oh-three
I'm living dastardly, must be all about survival 'g
These niggas passing me, streets just keep on getting live wit' me
They said there has to be another way, but I ain't feeling that
They tried to steal a Lac, and my wig, they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains, it's all about the 'cain
"Swang and Bang", peace to ESG and all the victims of the game, mang

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Flipping through the Ave, tryina see some good
But everythang is still the same, in my neighborhood
Niggas frown when you up, and smile when you down
And when you change for the better, shife fools stop coming around
I see the jealousy and hating and the wicked ways
We all lost children, praisin' paper, smoking our life away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me, but all we do now is fuck and fight
My conscience fuck wit' me so much that I can't eat or sleep
The other side of selling dope, and out there running the streets
And even though I'm gaining street fame, coming from this rap game
Lustful thinking and compulsive drinking is a normal thang
Some get erased and misplaced, trying to win the race
Some try to hold on to they place, by smoking wit' lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gon' change the hood
I'm smoking skunk and popping the trunk to make me feel good

[Hook][Intro: Juicy J]
You niggas ain't high as me
But I got a way you can do it

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm smokin' I'm rollin' (x16)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Codeine in my system, mane this life outstanding
Feel like I'm on another planet, I don't plan on landing
My Audemar is iced out, ice cream soft served
Prescription pills, prescription weed, drink prescription cough syrup
My swag belong on the short bus, I'm smokin' out in my tour bus
I'm chasing after that long money and I don't take no short cuts
Where the hell is we headed, I don't know but I'm high
I roll another zip of that fire, scream Taylor Gang or die
A zip and a double cup, bitch I'm pourin' up
Introduce ya to the fast life, but I'm slow as fuck
Bad bitch she take a sip, after that she open up
Livin' like a rockstar, I've never been sober bruh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Ugh, smashing out, lashing out
Keeping these bitches cashing out
Licking they ass, passing out
Don't give a fuck if they mad or not
What you gon' do when they come for you
I'm a bust back like a hog would do
Macing game, on the lose
Sip the foam, cup the deuce
High pursuit for a prostitute
Hoes wanna choose, what's stopping you
That nigga there cock blocking you
I'm a show you what a rock baller do
I might rip the road like Pendergrass; Pimp C, ain't Teddy P
I just jump in the Benz and smash the gas, she wanna give me some ass, but the dick ain't freeAnother Myke Diesel production

[Hook x2: Pimp C]
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
R.I.P. to Robert Davis, he the king of the south
Anything else said, need to shut your fucking mouth
I'm down with Lil' Flip, and I'm down with T.I.P
If them niggas come together, know how much paper we could see?
Slim Thug and Z-Ro, y'all still bullshitting
Need to sit down, take a tour, there's too much money to be get
Paul Wall and that Koopa still ain't talking
Money speak, all that bullshit keep walking
Y'all niggas got the game fucked up
All you record company people need to shut the fuck up
Cause y'all keeping up that bullshit rapping
The white people laughing at 'em, that's what's happening
The same stupid ass niggas still ain't figured it out
Long as they stay divided, man we gon' run the south
Y'all need to get up out the dumb shit
I got a bread truck, get up out that crumb shit, nigga

[Hook x2: Pimp C]

[Verse 2: P.O.P.]
Hey, I got the bass quaking, trunk shaking like tambourines
In the H, where them paints sweet as tangerines
Where they bouncing on fours like trampolines
It's the great state of Texas so I can't believe
All the conflict and plex that we carrying
It's time to get rid of the beef like vegetarians
I'm 'bout stacking bank, everyday
So I pay attention to the vets and I ain't talking 'bout a Chevrolet
Keke the Don, Pimp C a king
Lil' J, the owner of the squad, H-Town, we the team
It ain't no I in that, you trying that, you be fatigued
But if we man up and press, we could lead the league
We some all-stars, the roster is sick, man
I ain't gotta start, P.O.P.'ll be the sixth man
Rap-A-Lot's a southern empire for the assist, man
Three, two, one, swish, and

[Hook x2: Pimp C]

[Verse 3: Lil' Keke]
You see the slab outside, it look good, don't it?
Masterpiece, dripped out, with the fours on it
Trunk airtight, speakers and them show lights
Holding, cops around, nigga get your shit tight
Let me tell you the meaning of coming through
When the seats off-cream and the candy is dark blue
Approaching downtown, knocking doors down
Tint eleven slabs in a single-file line
Flossing, swerving, the rims is glistening
They gotta see the wood cause the top is missing
I sleep on dreams cause it's paper I'm chasing
My roots come from Texas, this Pimpalation
The barre is tasty, the Benz is spacey
I gotta show my class so these haters can face me
Riding up the boulevard, crushing the sidewalk
Showing my surround while I'm knocking the doors off

[Hook x2: Pimp C][Produced by Pimp C]

[Verse One: Pimp C]

I'm still Pimp C bitch so what the fuck is up?
Puttin' powder on the streets cuz I got big fuckin' nuts Comin' back from Louisiana in a Fleetwood Lac
I just served them niggas some shit to put they fiends on they back
Got the pounds going for 4 cause you know I just pay 2
Nigga bought thirty from me So I front him 42
He gon' pop for 700 times 62
24/8 is what I do so nigga fuck what 'cha do
If I told ya cocaine numbers, you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas 22 is talkin' bout they retirin'
In the game ain't a thang comin' foreign with Benz
Brick home and two apartments where I entertain friends
Mo bounce to the ounce cuz the Brougham the shit
I done got me 50 ounces out of birds in this bitch
Tightin' up, no slack, bitches checkin' my stock
Got some birds I'll sell a nigga, so might go rock for rock
Just got back from California kicked it with B-Legit
Put me down with purple chronic and that hurricane shit
At the studio with Tone, I wish I could stay
I got to holla at Master P, cuz we got money to make
And when playaz from the South stack G'z man
Like Ball I got to stack big cheeze man
Bitch say he wanna show you got nine grand?
I ain't rappin' shit until my money in my hand
South Texas mutherfucka that's where I stay
Gettin' money from yo bitches every goddamn day
Big paper I'm foldin'
Hoes is on my mutherfuckin' jock for all this dick that I be holdin'

Ho ass nigga

Chorus:

Murder, Mur, Mur, Murder

Verse Two: [Bun-B]

Well it's Bun-B bitch, and I'm the king of movin' chickens'
Not them finger lickins
Stickin' niggas that be trickin'
You need a swift kick in' yo ass is right for the pickin'
Now as my pockets thicken
I be kickin' nickel slickin' you sick when I be clickin'
Now take a look at the
Bigger nigga Malt liquor swigger
Playa hata ditch digger
Figure my hair trigger get a hot one in yo liver
You shiver, shake, and quiver
I'm frivolous if a nigga get wetter than a river
For what it's worth it's the birth of some niggas doin' dirt
Fuck her first and take off her skirt
Now make the pussy hurt
It's the Master
Hit the Swisha faster then you fever blister bastard
Fuck yo sister faster
Fifty elbows for sale yo
Brother better have my mail ho
Fore I catch a murder case and go to jail
Oh, hell no! Time to bail hit the trail so
We can sell mo fuckin' yayo get the scale
No other bullet duckers can shove us out the game
So they better buck us
Cause the cluckers they love us
Make them glass dick suckers
Shake their jelly like Smucker's
I hit like nun-chuckers
Cause Short Texas bring the rukus
This for my muthafuckers
Cookin' cheese to crooked G'z
Rockin' up quarter keys
Just to get the hook with ease
Wannabes get on yo knees
Feel the squeeze from them HK 1-3s
From here to overseas
We do what we please
Don't trip cause we flip
Light up a dip
I'm breakin' 'em off from they hip to yo lip
Go ask that boy Skip
That nigga Bun rip
With one clip, soon as the gun slip
Now I done ripped out my Barrelli
Flyin' through yo Pelle Pelle and
Some smelly red jelly is drippin' out of ya belly
Servin' 'em like a Deli jumped on my cellular telli
Ho sell it like it's goin' out of style
You can't see me Marcus so have a
Motherfuckin' Sweet and a smile

Chorus:[Pimp C]
Smoke somethin, bitch!
A trademark (trademark), know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Young Pimp.. know what we doin? (Texas!)

[Hook: Pimp C]
Smokin out, pourin up, puttin dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck x3
I'm smokin out, pourin up, keepin lean up in my cup
All my cars got leather and wood, in my (uh!) hood we call it {*screwed*}

[Pimp C]
Grippin grain, switchin lanes, sellin cocaine outta candy thang
Jammin Lil' Wayne, gotta trunk of bang, cause I'mma +Hot Boy+, gotta hot flame
And my hoes pay me, just like Baby, that's the only way they can lay me
Niggas shoot slugs but they ain't graze me, they want Sweet Jones be pushin daisies
But you slow and lazy, you can't fade me, that's the reason I knock ya lady
How you gon' pimp wit'cha dick up in her? I told the pimp God that you was a sinner
You takin these square hoes out to dinner, the bitch chose me cause she want a winner
I mix a ho head up like a blender, ho need a daddy, you'se pretender
I used to be a young drug dealer, now I'mma young girl stealer
I hit the 3 just like Steve Jackson, nigga say my name watch ya bitch reaction
Sweet Jones or Sweet James? Switched my name and finger fucked the game
The nigga fell off cause his raps are shitty, plus a nigga need to move up out the city
The game gritty but the bitch pretty, lemme snort some white girl up off ya titty
Ya heard me right, we play wit our nose
Wear platinum piece and wit' the Gucci clothes
Paid my dues, I ain't came to lose, I wear Marvin Blackman tennis shoes
In the winter time, mink coat to match the mink on the floor in my candy 'Lac

[Hook]

[Mike Jones]
Uh! I'm comin out in that candy thang, 8 carats in my pinky rang
Drop the top in the parking lot so y'all can see butter guts & swangs
Candy paint what I'm flippin on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin on
MOMO wood grain I'm grippin on, grippin on
I said! Candy paint what I'm flippin on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin on, codeine in cup I'm sippin on
I hog the lane in that candy train, swangin left to right then I turn up the bang
I'mma say it for those who don't know my name, know my name
They call me Mike Jones and I blew up quick, Ice Age the name you can't tell by the wrists?
I sit on buck in that candy 6, and I keep that thing real handy bitch!
I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!

[Hook]

[Bun B]
When I pull the slab out and hit the block, wit' them 4's and vogues they clankin out
When they trunks pop, drop the top, don't be surprised you can go in shock
Wit' them neon lights, candy paint, belts and buckles across the back
Don't disrespect or call this a Cadi, maybe this more than just a 'Lac
Some like the white but I'mma roll the green, purple dro up in the swisha
Horny ladies sittin on the grill, wood grain to grip it's hard to miss us
We "G" so don't dismiss us, been here before gon' be here later
Down wit' that you understand the G Code and if you don't then you'se hater
If so, I can't roll wit'cha, it ain't how I do it man
I'm from Texas, P.A. to be exact where we screw it man {*screwed*}
U.G.K. for life is the family, that's how we get down
Bring them trill niggas to ya hood and shut ya shit down
Playa you need to sit down, you outta ya league
Tryna keep up wit' the trill, you just might die of fatigue
You can't carry the load, you can't handle the weight
Not like them boys up out that Lone Star state so get it straight
We be...

[Hook][Hook x3: Bun B]
Pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I guess you can call me a family man
Cause I care for bitches' babies every chance that I can
I don't give 'em clothes, or diapers and shit
But I like to feed they babies with my big black dick
Cause I'ma tell you if you didn't know
You ain't did shit 'til you fucked a pregnant ho
The pussy is hotter, it's got a extra kick
It feel like hot potato pie around your dick
Sometimes I swing high, sometimes I swing low
Sometimes I like to fuck a pregnant bitch on my floor
Hit it kinda hard, and speed it up fast
Fuck her 'til she get the cherry blisters on her ass
Cause if she expecting, I can satisfy
And at the same time, give her kid a pacifier
And I love it when I bust that old nut
Cause I know that her baby's just gon' lick it all up

[Hook x3: Bun B]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Ain't no pussy like one impregnated
A pussy made for nutting in, I could never hate it
A swoll pussy hole is the best on earth
And a big dick helps make an easy childbirth
I love the big titties but I hate the taste of milk
And a bigger, fatter ass on my dick is smooth as silk
Now if she got a boy, it ain't fun
But if she got a girl, then it's two pussies for the price of one
And if the belly's all stacked
I'll put the ho on all four and hit the pussy from the back
I'm fucking all over the womb
Now I move your baby to the side so I can get a little room
I love to fuck them pregnant hoes
Your baby's sneezing out nuts because I bust one in his nose
So when your little child is born
I bet the motherfucker tell you pregnant pussy got it going on

[Hook x3: Bun B]

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
You see, fucking pregnant pussy is simple
All you gotta do is hope the baby think your dickhead is a nipple
And if the cum snatcha stimulate my sack
He just might get a fat load of Similac
And if he start kicking, I'ma keep sticking
Go a little deeper, give his bad ass a whipping
Within nine months, I can hit it late or sooner
It's me, Miss Jones, and Mr. Jones Junior
And once I get the bitch in the raw
Me and her kid can have a nice ménage à trois
So believe I ain't kicking no bullshit
Cause pregnant pussy is the best you can get

[Hook x3: Bun B][Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Question; What y'all know about swangers on slab
30's on a Hummer with the butterfly doors
Lucky Charm teeth, lack on them D's
Chevy sitting high, iced out everythang
Stacks on deck, no bank
What y'all know about five of the hottest young niggas in the game
Bow Wow, Short Dawg, Scrappy
The boy Lil' Wayne, the homie Pimp C
We got a little story to tell y'all bout where we come from

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I come from where a Chevy with a trunk full of bump is all that's wanted
And the year don't matter long as you throw some, throw some Ds on it
Mouth cost more than your house, house on ten acres
And the inside so fly niggas call me Jim Baker
From Ohio to Texas, we're so infectious
A-T-L to S-T-L it's gon' be hard to catch us
I'm talking bout bills sipping on bar
Drinking crunk, living like there's no tomorrow
See out-of-towners can't understand, cause I cut all my words short
Popping Texas, mandatory, Saturday at the mall
Hoods ain't hoods, they called wars and zones
Guns cart choppers and when it's on, it's on
See the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, hear me out
Said the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, now answer me this

[Hook x4: Pimp C]
Unh, now what y'all know about the country boys
Coming down with candy toys, playing hard talking noise

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
The boy country like overalls you know that dawg
Catch me in the slab, the same color as Bubu's rust
Cruising up the Ave and I'm probably gon give yo' ho a call
Cuz I ball hard and I'm stuntin' like there's no tomorrow
So yesterday, I swear I spent about fifty G's
On a wristwatch that shine brighter that a Christmas tree
If you was getting cheese, you would probably spend it, too
So don't hate me cause I blow paper like the wind do
And hop out clean, so watch out, Queen
I'm the biggest balla in Houston homie, not Yao Ming
I'm getting money maine, so my pockets hella chubby
And I be sipping drank that's purple like a Teletubby
So when it comes to the women dog, I can tell they love me
They put they panties in a envelope an mail 'em to me
Now how's that for some fanmail
But me an Bow got a question, know the answer, raise your hand, yea

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Lil' Scrappy]
They call me Fisher Price cause all I do is play nice
And I ain't gon run a gang of gorillas that love to fight
I'm the Iceman, I'm far away from the sun
But I'm still hot like a bullet pushing up out a gun
My charger look like a muscle lifting a ton
If you picking on me, yea you picked the right one
You passed another drink and I'm sipping another one
You trust me with the blunt and I'm blowing myself a blunt
Got a Fruit Loop Coupe looking like orange juice
When them niggas see the troop, they don't be knowing what to do
Yea I'm Scrap, greatest young nigga in the nation
Y'all niggas quit hating on the money that I'm making
I'm just country

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]
Look they call me Wayne, dirty south chaperone
So far ahead in the race, I don't know which lap I'm on
No homo, Young Louisiana
Hit you wit the .357 like MC Hammer
And money talks, so that's my grammar
If you ain't about money, you can step like a gamma
Am I the illest doing this? Hell yeah
I am fresher than the Prince of Bel-Air
And OG kush I what you smell here
Smoking the biggest blunts, don't worry I brought a spare
They say I'm at the top, but I'm almost there
And when I get, I will sit, don't worry I brought a chair
I put ice all over the Audemar
Piguet watchface, now time is hard to tell
And I will do whatever The Carter shall
So hot, going out with me is like going to hell

[Refrain][Jazze Pha]
Ladies and Gentlemen..

[Hook - Young Buck]
I got my pistol in my pants, rocks in my drawers
Holla "WOOPT, WOOPT" homie if you see them laws
I got my pistol in my pants, rocks in my drawers
Holla "WOOPT, WOOPT" homie if you see them laws

[Hook: Pimp C]
I was standin' on the corner slangin' 'caine (tryna make it do what it do)
Just another young nigga havin' thangs man (I gotta get, I, I gotta get it get it)
I was standin' on the corner slangin' 'caine (tryna make it do what it do)
Just another young nigga havin' thangs man (I gotta get, I, I gotta get it get it)

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm in the Porsche no passenger
Feeling like a filthy rich drug trafficker
See didn't nobody give me shit I got my ass on that interstate
Made sure my mama had food on that dinner plate
You not a boss if you ain't never took a loss
Some birds never landed but at least I didn't get caught
We don't even use scales, niggas break off a brick
Whatever over is yours homie, just take it and git!
They gave Big Paul life, but I ain't thinking about stopping
Cuz soon as he tried to quit
That's when the feds came, got him
Ain't nothin' in my name, and 50 cleaned up mine
I'm still paranoid though from what I left behind
Gotta put me some gloves on, they fuckin' wit Buck now
Tryna slow me down, got me pissin' in cups now
Three Kings on a mission, see we got it for cheap
You put us together, nigga the streets finna eat
YEAHH

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Hey
Remember standin' in the trap wit 5 or 6 over-vision and a pirat
That nigga who oderderd that quarter ki ain't even came by yet
Blew a whole O of dro, and I ain't even high yet

5ft 6in standing with his mouth piece near. Buyer making him wait
Smoked an ounce of hydro

Spent 4 G's or mo', and I ain't even fly yet

$4,000 on Moet and he ain't drunk yet

Viper truck, Bentley grill, big wheel pimpin'
They done gave her 20 mil, well big deal pimpin'
Think we fakin' when we spittin', better get real pimpin'
Cause we still will kill, you just better chill pimpin'
Get it how he used to live, and keep on fakin' for the women
In life we all make decisions even when faced with collisions
Like me at 13, out in no supervision
Straight thug livin', bumpin' pot drug-dealin'
Seen daily on the block, need Yay we on the block
Keep the hatin' to yourself, cause that AK be on the block
Dougy C be in the V, me and KT, we in the drop
Went from standin' on the block wit rock, to standin' on the top

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Young Jeezy]
Let's go
1 for the bread, and 2 for the blow
Mr. 17.5, ya damn right it's gon' snow
Told y'all I was gon' blow, kinky B said so
Or not, back to chargin' 600 for an O
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before (True)
Alleyoop nigga, all you gotta do is score
I turn the brick into a label, nigga I'm a boss
Brush my teeth in the morning, I ain't even gotta floss (Haha)
Sold two million records, and half a million O's (Damn)
Add it all up, it's 'bout a billion rocks
You can't be serious, you niggas ain't fo' real
Just my ears alone, is like a quarter mil' (That's right)
Hit ya by the tech, and blow half the budget (Yup)
I do it for the streets and mutha fuckers love it
Just copped the new Bent, you know ya boy pay cash
Now that's Thug Motivation for your mutha fuckin' ass

Aye, if you gon' believe in something, why not believe in us?
You know what I'm talking 'bout, this Mr. Ivory P

Ready to be elected, its elected ya' dig by a bad bitch
Yeah lets go to the moon and form the stars on the way ho
You know what I'm talking 'bout, that's for real ya' dig
Yeah Mr. Ivory P., a pimp said that ho you know what I'm talking 'bout for real
You either gonna go fast or slow bitch you know what I'm talking 'bout
Aye and I want a ho you know what I'm saying with a turban ass like kin' said ya' dig

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I just knocked your ho give up her clothes, it's gone
If I was a mother fucking band, I'd be a baritone
If I was a mother fucking car I be a Phantom stretch
I got a 850 Benz, they ain't made that bitch yet
Left the money with the dealer, come out I'm a get it
You say that you a baller, but you leasing your rent
Leaning, scheming, sinning, you need the lord
So when I’m in front you, she think she speaking to a God
Ain't indecisive but a ten percenter
The girl tired of losing so she choosing a winner
Grip so much wood bitch my hand got a splinter
Call my bottle told 'em guess whose coming for dinner?
She said who? I said a horse like you
To suck her pussy out, no dick 'til she drop it out
Push it out big money stay drug free
If you gon' believe in something bitch believe in me

[Chorus: Pimp C]
If you gon' believe in something, well well well, why not believe in me
Pimp game never die, live to tell the truth even when I tell a lie
If you gon' believe in something, well well well, why not believe in me
Cause I'm ice cold, bend over let me see it, don't touch your toes

[Verse 2: Cory Mo]
Please believe it, if I said it, I meant it
I keep it pimping at all times, you with it, I'm with it
The windows be tinted, them 4's be spinning over the speed limit
It's Cory Mo, where the dro at my nigga? I ain't tripping

[Verse 3: Hezeleo]
It's easily on the high rise
Nigga we trill, give a fuck about the rest of you guys
I'm a truth around yonder
I'm flipping the Benz, while you flipping in yo' baby-mama's Honda
I'm a O.G bonafide, old school so cool
Sock it to a bitch and make it stick like soul food
If it ain't about the money then what we gon' do?
If I teach you how to get it, could you bring me some money boo?

[Verse 4: BankRoll Jones]
Need a pimp bankroll, don't just take a application
365, ho ain't taking no vacation
24/7, I'm the man to dedication
One of the few you should believe in me and early doctor patient

[Chorus: Pimp C]

[Verse 5: Young Toe]
Take notes from this pimp shit
But don't choke when my dick in your throat bitch
I'm Young Toe aka wake a bitch quick
Slash take a nigga bitch slash make her make me rich
Peep swag ho, I'm a Pimp C like Chad ho
Underdawg, young hogg, want some asshole
It's UGK all day I want the purse first
Gon' believe in the D, believe in T.O.E church

[Verse 6: Doe B]
Aye, aye
Young B Doe keep two quarter piece, cross breeze
Fresh braids, fresh shades, riding in something from cross seas
From P.A to the Bay, I got some brain surgeons
They'll get me 6 figures a year, so daddy stay flirting
It's nothing close your eyes and see I'm still that nigga
Your bitch chose me she follow me on Twitter
You better get her 'fore I show you how I do 'em
I bleed they ass dry and let my partners ride through 'em

[Chorus: Pimp C]

[Outro: Pimp C]
Yeah and all these old fake ass pimp niggas up out here

I know you hoes on a mission to steal my dick
But Pimp Chad ain't goin for the Georgia, bitch (Georgia, bitch!)
It wasn't nuttin when I saw ya bitch (saw ya bitch!)
She knew that I was on some millionaire shit
Everythang I say is the truth (is the truth!)
I need five funky hoes for one prostitute
Just cause you sell pussy don't make you certified
You ain't in it to win it, I can see it in yo' eyes
WWW dot, "Wonder why I'm quickly gettin exposed"
Breakin tricks for they money like a female is supposed ('posed!)
I'm out in Neptune, on some Space Age shit
All my diamonds got paper, Emmitt keeping me legit ('git!)
When the welfare was over, I be sellin cocaine ('caine!)
I'm out in Las Vegas, takin over bitches' brains (brains!)

Pimp hard on a cracker but I love me a crow (love me a crow!)

[Hook: Pimp C] - repeat 2X
I gotta big truck on some big rims
I get my dick sucked, when I pull out the Bent'
These hoes jockin me, they wanna ride with me
They gotta be down ho! Like Bobby Brown and Whitney

[Verse 2: 8 Ball]
Life is a game of inches
You move up little by little to the fame and riches
Life be a game and a broad of visions
Some niggas is hoes and all women ain't bitches
And your reach? Keep the heat near
Games, I don't play , I'm tryna make it clear
You don't hear me nigga? Open up ya ears
If you movin too fast, slow down and switch gears
P.A. somethin, ya life give ya nothin
The streets ain't pokin, you can get shot bluffin
Cash rule everythang, keep that on ya brain
Get rich quick, let pimpin do the blame
Midnight blue with the peanut butter guts
Chrome on my feet and bump in the trunk
Ball cap popped up, raised to the back
Kush in my rillo, rollin big like Shaq

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Verse 3: MJG]
I'mma pimp, sellin hoes to a chick on the track
Make my money, bend her or over, slap the dick on the back
They call me M (Jayyy!!!) G, I'm the man in charge
If you read this application, you'll change ya job
I gotta order motherfuckin rappers, teachers, preachers, and athletes
All make a personal visit or to the backstreets
I even gotta ho, play away
With one rule, 'til ya gray, nigga stay away
See I'm the reason why ya letcha girl stay at the house
And beat her up cause my name couldn't stay out her mouth
And I don't need to know if she just wanna join the team
Get down and kiss all my royal marines
I keep a Cadillac and I select a few in my car
If you don't own one, then you ain't got shit in ya garage
I go hard, you motherfuckas ain't breakin a ho
You just flyin bitches in, showcasing a ho

[Hook] - repeat 2X(Pimp C)
I gotta come down, I got a bangin trunk
So when I come through you feel the slab just bump
Them niggas sipin syrup and them bitches on that gin
Man hit that sweet one time for Smoke-D locked down in that pen
I'm blowin out the window, you know I'm rollin glass
I'm bumpin that Screw, that t-a-t, that boy actin a ass
Cause down in Texas nigga, we got our own stores
We got the baddest bitches and we roll the freshest cars
I flip to New Orleans by you clask I'm on the scene
Got dress improvement steam I step out that bitch so clean
I poured out some liquor on the street for that fool Todd
He was a trill ass nigga never came at me prod
Man I was talkin to Playa G just the other night
He told me about this nigga that was talkin about me shife
Fool nigga this UGK Bun and C we run the streets
And tell your bitch ass brother he can't fuck with my beats
So if you wanna be bangin nigga the good shit don't come cheap
I'm talkin 7000 over 3 knock off a G
Cause fool this ain't no game nigga all about my change
I'm comin baby Fleetwood swangin on them thangs

(Chorus 4x)
I gotta come down
I gotta stay real
I gotta break them boys off bumper and grill

(Bun B)
Now tell me what it's all about in the south
Big gold grill in you mouth
Much leather inside yo car, on yo back, in yo house
Sit in a nigga's ride the seats feel like a couch
Big keys in my pouch
Bitch if it hurt say ouch
Now if I look like a south don't try to cap
You know a nigga like me be ridin dirty with big dope up in his lap
Oh, but when I'm shinin bitch I'm blazin
Hoes shrivlin up like raisins talkin bout it so amazin
How big Bun be rollin through Texas with sexy hoes keepin they wig done
Bustas bite the big one
From dis to dip this swisher houses
Let's flip from that maker maker to that after hours on Scott
They always drinkin trip mixed with crush 75 or 4
Make a nigga wanna fuss, but I can't
Cause I need the rush of codeine so I can lean
I prop a pill
Cause I'm trill to the bone
Crushin with that crome

Chorus

(N.O. Joe)
What's up bruh this N.O. Joe representin gumbo
Funk in you trunk that got yo ears wide open like you dumb ho
I'm livin larger than most a coast to coast slipper
That ice-bowl sipper that's never known to be a set tripper
Too many diamonds for you to try to look at directly
Haters don't check me they respect me
A pistol packin, no shank, shiny grill, full tank
Checkin out these bustas thinkin they real when they ain't
Y'all call me mister foreign
I'm comin down at navy porscha
Either way I'mma be a highway scorcher, blunt torcher
I'm catchin out doin 120 on the tallway the whole way
Turnin the corners that I once hung out
I got the boppers strung out
Walkin around with they tounge out
Naw, I stay behind the wheel grinnin
Burnin 500 dollar rubber, 5000 dollar rim spinnin

Chorus 7x[Intro]
Hold up
Smoke something, bitch
My trademark, know what I’m talkin bout?
Yea, know what I’m talkin bout?
Uncle George was talkin' bout
Hey man, do fries come with that shake?
Do green guys come with them thighs
Shit, pimpin', Tommy loose, OC

[Hook: Pimp C (x2)]
Boss get cash money, smokin' the vapors
Don’t chase the cat, chase the paper
Them thighs come with that shake
Bitch in yo mind, ho I got cake

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Well Peter Piper, Pete Kepers, and Run rock rhymes
You know that C Pimp hoes and Bun knock dimes
I be at it and on it, don’t start no static, I want it
When I want it I get it, so get to hoppin' up on it
Ain't no stopping, no frontin, this certified and official
When I see you lickin your lips, you wanna blow on my whistle
But I got that harmonica, you can play it like Stevie
They say that pimpin ain’t easy, man it is if you be me
I see a new one every day, and they think that
Cause they jazzy and they carefree they gon' talk me out my pay
See, you tight, but see my game is just a little bit tighter
Pay for pussy, that’s alright, I grab the smoke so pass the lighter

[Hook: Pimp C (x2)]

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
Mane you know I hit the first night, get 'em right the first date
But I got a question for yah, do thighs come with that shake?
You want Pappadeaux seafood, well you gon have to eat boo
Won't be in my foreign car, you gon' be a porn star
I know what’s going through your head, If I hit 'em right with head
I might get a slice of bread for just a minute
I get cash in duffle bags,  I don't chase the cat
Let em ride, get em high as I pay for cake
Sorry, girl, I gotta go, like Pimp I’m on that purple dro
Mid-west, 30 a show, yea I hustle and flow
Round town, a bad chicks tryna flag me down
Zoom zoom, see ya later, I gotta get the paper

[Hook: Pimp C (x2)]

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
Shit, now all the trickin', you should stop it, money been the topic
While she digging in your pockets I be pluggin on her socket
All off in your crib, feet up on your shit
Instead of breakin' off a ho, you out here lovin' a bitch
When I get this pimpin' biz, steel toe, real throwed
The type of dick that run a chick some shit that she could bill for
Live for, all off in your billfold to make her happy
She shake you off, I break her off cause she bring it back to daddy
Don’t be mad at me, cause your ho done chose
I was out here on the stroll, she got down like she's supposed
I put her on some Vogues, and some flavors on her mind
Cause thighs come with that shake and green on the side

[Hook: Pimp C (x2)][Hook]
I keep my cup raised up my nigga cause I'm a playa
Nigga cause I'm a playa, nigga cause I'm a playa
My dollars stay stackin' nigga cause I be mackin'
Nigga cause I be mackin', nigga cause I be mackin'
I keep my cup raised up my nigga cause I'm a playa
Nigga cause I'm a playa, nigga cause I'm a playa
My dollars stay stackin' nigga cause I be mackin'
Nigga cause I be mackin', nigga cause I be mackin'

[Verse 1]
I'm just out here slangin' CDs nigga like rock for rockers
Still rollin' Hypnotize, we quick to knock off yo' blocker
Blastin' nothin' but choppers, nigga we non-stoppers
Whippin' up this cream, real mean, like Betty Crocker
The guts, icy white-tin, leather is what I'm lik-in'
Pull up, chrome rims, didn't holla, she must be dykin'
Like she didn't see the colors change colors on my paint job
Just like all the colors on my ice in my wrist watch
Pimps scarred, nothin' but some conversation for some dough
Slangin' these words out my mouth, like I'm sellin' snow
Tellin' no, lies, compromise, only cheese wise
If ya try to cross, real killers then you must, die

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Pimp C]
Mackaroni Pretty Tony Snow keep it poppin'
Movin' to the internet, keep that pussy droppin'
Mob it up, slop it up, see the ball chop it up
Whip it up, sit down on that meat I'm fit' to push it up
If that game was over I'd get some work and cook it up
Wanna show let's rook it up, you want a beat I'll hook it up
We run the streets I seen a part up in the shit I took it up
She wanted me to hit her pussy I'mma go off in her butt
What you gon' do, when that thang go to fightin'?
I'mma lay ya deep off in them hoes, them hoes be boppin'
Tellin' me to stop but bitch, I ain't fit' to stop it
Ya pussy is a pitbull bitch, gon' and lock it
Fuckin' 'round wit' me I knock ya thang up outta socket
Ya ho wanna look at me ya bitch is outta pocket
Flyin' in the Bentley gettin' it sucked just like a rocket
Pimp C bitch I got a zoo off in my closet

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cruisin' Chelsea Avenue, in the hood, it's a sunny day
Junts out, walkin' miniskirts, let them bunnies play
Money stay, in a nigga's pocket wrapped in rubberbands
Seven hundred ones wit' 'bout seventy Benjamins
Understand, couple hollow jackets in the bar-ra-rel
Make a wild nigga wanna walk a straight and nar-ra-row
My dogs strapped, on point, God we like the phar-ra-roah
My hundred shots, comin' out the mouth, of the calico
Yean' know? Mayne a nigga do's what he gon' do
I'm lookin' for some beef, but the kind, at a barbeque
Comin' through, flickin' old school, Box Chevy thang
Ridin' twenty two's, on you fools, let the system bang

I keep my cup raised up (echoes out)[Intro Pimp C]
Uh, hol' up
For all them niggas out there ridin' candy
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Blowin' on somethin' sweet
Goin' down
Hol' up
Check it

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Boys kickin' back, layin' in the shade
Ain't nobody trippin' cause the money already made
The 90s was for jackin', 2000 for the ballers:
The drop top Jag or the candy red Impala
If you sellin' big cheese, keep pushin', my nigga
Polo horses on my bed - fuck Hilfiger
I'm Pimp C, bitch, in the ghetto I'm a star
I made this for the niggas tryin' ta chop in they cars

[Hook: Pimp C x4]
Could I, Would I, Should I break 'em?
Uh...I wanna chop blades

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Now, when I turn my knock up, and bangin' yo' block up
Without pickin' my Glock up, I'm raisin' my stock up
I got haters on lock-up...boy, they slangin' rock up
And bangin' Makaveli 7, crankin' my 'Pac up
Now, ain't no stoppin' when the tops start droppin'
Hearin' Fat Pat rappin', your hat back capin'
In a black 'Lac mackin' wit' a bop in a fade
Boy, we fat stack packin', steady choppin' on blades...blades...blades..

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
It's time to hit the slab
Benz sittin' low
I'm puffin' on the 'dro, I got the pistol in the do'
I pulled up in my ride, these hoes lookin' hot
If she get up on my leatha, then her panties gon' drop
I just can't stop...bleedin' my block
Got some prime cut cock, I mean some private-ass stock
They put it in they mouth and never say no
Some nut-suckin' hoes, I mean some dick-suckin' pros
That like to get exposed, and play with they nose
And bend they pussy over, for my nigga, and touch they toes
She do that shit for daddy, but them tricks gotta pay
Just like E-40: Pimpin' in a major way
It's all for the money
She tryin' ta stay paid
She steady breakin' niggas on them shiny-ass thangs
I'm deep up in the street
I'm tryin' to fill my nuts
And later on I'mma try to skeet it on her butt

[Hook x4]

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Say, nigga, I keeps my rims clean
Shinin through a dim scene
Got yo' bitch wetter than the captain of the swim team
Steppin' out the Caddy, bitch, I'm fresher than Dentyne
Slicker than Crisco, sweeter than Nabisco
From Philly to 'Frisco where the Don be a Sisqo
You better get some Blades if you still ridin' this ho
Boys puttin' Swangers on Benzes, it gotta stop
If you fittin' ta ride foreign, then, nigga, you gotta chop
And Southern niggas still got the nerve to ride D's
I ain't hatin' on Daytons, but it's 2000, nigga please
It's all about the candy paint, it's all about the Vogues
It's all about the slab, baby, it's all about the hoes
Got some cars and some pros: some real and some fraud;
Hated on by a nigga, hated on by a broad
So long as J's sell, and them boppin' hoes slut
I'll be ridin' chromin' blades, steady choppin' hoes up

[Hook x16]

[Bun B]
Yeah, dedicated to boys choppin' on chromin' thangs

[Hook: Pimp C]

The grill on the front, trunk steady hummin

[Bun B]
Well let me introduce ya to the baddest bitch alive
Can't nothin fuck wit her (wit her) when I put her in drive
Other hoes got fo' shoes, but mine got five (she got five)
And got the hood buzzin like a beehive
She's immaculately dressed, with good hygiene
Take a bath everyday, cause she gots to stay clean
I wipe her down slow with a real soft rag
Now she lookin so good (good) a nigga gots to brag (I gots to brag)
When we pull up my nigga we stop to show
You probably kill yourself when you see the suicide do'
In the summertime she might come outside without a top (without a top)
And one look'll make a nigga mouth drop (ya mouth drop)
We don't stop we keep it rollin like a ball
With a bitch this bad, how could a nigga take a fall?

[Hook]

[Pimp C]

Have it on your mind cause she'll put it in your heart
The game'll be over 'fore the motor even start

But don't call it plastic surgery, it's body sculptin
Take a old school give it new car sense
And then I don't regret one motherfuckin dollar I spent mayne~!

[Hook](*talking*)
(cocaine cocaine), I'd like to introduce you all to
(cocaine cocaine) UGK, UGK bitch my man Bun B
Pimp C in the house y'all, put your hands together
Big Dick Cheney and Tony Snow, (cocaine cocaine)

[Pimp C]
Uh the bitch, been good to me
Been bad to my homies, keep it cool with me
I played it by the rules, and the regulations
I use to switch cars with the Mexican, at the gas station
Mine had money in it, his had the work
After the deal was done, I make my girl pussy squirt
Cause after the deal, we would all celebrate
Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight
I never came, with the funny business
That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggas, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up
I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'mma hit it with the Sprite, and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch, get up in my nose

[Hook - 5x]
Cocaine, cocaine

[Bun B]
They call it cocaine, coc-a-ina, yayo
Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from
The mountains of Columbia, and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine

[Hook - 5x]

[Rick Ross]
You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hard, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
M-I-yAyo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)

[Hook - 9x][Note: This version has additional lines in Bun B's verse]

[Pimp C]
Pimp C bitch! So what the fuck is up?
Step wrong nigga and I'll take ya fuckin nuts!
Got more dope than a pharmacy ho
Got a job for the city bitch, I'm shoveling snow
South Texas motherfucker that's where I stay
Gettin pussy from these bitches every god damn day
Kick it with a trill nigga so you best not trip
Bought the Caddy crossed the pier and kicked to Ganksta Nip
Selling weight, get it straight, fuck them 20s and 10's
Only love my fuckin momma no she {?} her friends
Motherfucker either down or the motherfucker ain't
And if ya bitch-ass ain't, then ya dick is in the paint
If ya gal look fine you better hide the bitch
Cause if I find her I'mma fuckin make her suck my dick
That goes for your momma and your sister too
And if I'm locked down then tell that shit might go for you
Don't try to get no false nuts, I take 'em sucker
Fuckin 'round with C you'll be a dead motherfucker
Nigga only 17 but I'm runnin the show
Sellin dope from Louisiana down to El Segundo, ha!
I think it's only fair that I should knock on wood
Cause my bitch is on the street, pussy sell real good
And all my ho know not to trip, bitch fuck pitty
I'll take out my nine and shoot ya in ya fuckin titty
Ho niggas forty-five tryin to, get with me
Sellin fifty dollar slabs as I'm slangin them ki's
If you need to get some powder I'm fully supplied
I got the, cocaine in the back of the ride, motherfucker!

[Hook: repeat 8X w/ variations]
Cocaine in the back of the ride (Yeeeeeah, motherfucker!)

[Bun B]
Aiyyo it's Bun B bitch, and I'm the king of the hubba trade
Pockets fat as fuck from all the ducats the brother made
Hoes like to jock, but see I try to contain 'em
They droppin them drawers because I move they cocaine in
But I just laugh, cause pussy games be triflin
The legs get spread, I cut that ass like a knife then
Bust a nut on her stomach, wash my dick in the sink
And buy a 40 at the store, from the god damn chink
Dope games keep ya SICK, just like a disease
Movin ki's makin G's, hoes drop to they knees
Little kids on the corner, steady grabbin they nuts
Sayin, "I wish I was Bun when I grow the fuck up"
Baby blue Riviera, Dayton and laced rims
Khaki pants, black sweater with the U.G.K. brim
Black gat fully loaded nigga come with respect
Step up the wrong way I'll break yo' god damn neck
Big dick in my drawers, the niggas from down South
Down to put a twelve gauge in yo' god damn mouth!
Think I'm playin bitch try me, it ain't no thang
Put them hands up bitch, and kiss this god damn ring
Cause I move tons of dope, twenty-four hours a day
Cocaine from Argentina to the 'Frisco bay
DEA try to stop me yo, but they shit ain't cold
Cause the nigga's got politicians on the Big Tyme payroll
Narcotic agents wearin cement shoes
Reported missin on the news, they singin the blues!
And if my money get fucked, I'll let it slide
It's just some mo' cocaine in the back of the ride, bitch!

[Pimp C - Outro]
Yo, I wanna send this shit out to them motherfuckers
In 3A sellin that dope
South Texas in the house, on the behalf of myself
Bun B, Big Tyme Records, and we outta here...

"Cocaine in the back of the ride" [- repeated 'til end of song[Hook: Pimp C]
I got the colors in my watch and my rang
Piece in my chain bitch I'm pushing everything
Colors, candy red on the Lac
Queen white Bentley keep them strippers on they back
I got them colors, she brown she red she black she white
Got a japper we can bite
Colors, I don't know about y'all
Yellow lights cut the fog, I'm a young fucking dog
I got them colors, like the pimp Ice T
Leaning on a swish, popped up on 3

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Red, blue make green pussy nigga
Promethazine purple lean pussy nigga
Red polo horses it's still fuck Hilfiger
This the underdog young fucking hogg on the trigger
Got candy on the wrist, 7 on my feet
Hoes sell pussy then they come buy me
You wanna see colors? I can show you every shade
Foreign hoes going platinum on my niggas space page

[Hook: Pimp C]

[Verse 2: DJ B-Do]
I got purple drank, green money, yellow diamonds, red cars
Blue dreams and yellow hoes that suck me up cause I'm a star
I'm a damn fool, think I ain't then come see
B-Do keep it too trill like my nigga Bun B
I know you see the ice it got my body froze up
Lamborghini doors up, you see your ho done chose up
I ain't no pimp, I's a player with a lot of game with a million dollar swag
And I stay popping tags

[Hook: Pimp C]

[Verse 3: TOE]
Colors in my teeth, piece, and in my chain
And every time I ball my fist it's cause it's in my rang
Step up yo' game VVS's make my neck glow
My watch is skittles, colors change like a rainbow
And you can see yo' boy shining even in the shade
Cause I got yellow ice looking like some lemonade
Smoking on some kush got a nigga feeling great
Got a pocket full of green T O E is getting cake

[Hook: Pimp C][Bridge]
This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk (let's see)
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk (what am I gon' wear today?)
This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk (gimme them Cedar gloves)
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk (I'm goin' into my cashmere closet)
This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk (I got mo' cashmere than y'all)
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk (where my trousers?)
This is what we call, the movin' sidewalk (cream brown and 3 inch cuffs)
Movin' sidewalk, movin'-movin' sidewalk (where my sneakers?)
(I don't wear sneakers, I wear slippers)

[Fonzworth Bentley]
The rumor, of me in the Isuzu Trooper, fooled ya
It was a Porsche, a super duper
Charger, it wasn't Bankhead it was Boulevardin'
Wasn't Shawty it was comedian not it (uh-uh)
That wasn't my car, I was walkin', in velvet slippers
Know ya talkin' but before you do you need to know that
That's the type of brother got a castle wit' the cognac river
For a moat, I'll tell you what floats my boat
Purple silk linin', in, all of my coats
What you want? You want cashmere in the winter?
Really wanna know my worth? Wanna know my splendor?
Before, I deliver, gonna warn ya, may offend ya
Tesh and Kina this thang while you just a Simba
Watch the beak on this penguin his raps are sicker
I can weave in this lane, halogens I flicker
Foreign somethin' sittin' in the back wit' drivin' gloves and wavin' lazy

[Hook]
We gon' paint the town tonight
They gon' faint and fall in line (yeah)

Pimp mode, meat good like pie a la mode
On parole, still keep me a calico ('co)
Never them gym clothes, cut Hilfiger ('figer)
Polo horses on my bed, pillow and spread
That girl want a wild bull between her legs
Too much game for them squares and them lames
I'm in a wet car (car) candy thang (thang)
Cologne smell good taste like a candy cane
Lane to lane (lane) brain to brain (brain)
I wrecked the Spur (Spur), it really ain't no thang
I'm in red, brand new, hoggin' the game
I got the Phantom, car's tuned true, just bought a Range
At press time hadn't dropped the album yet
Chinese girls love me long time on the G4 jet
Unh, ya hear that noise in my closet?
That's the gator tryna talk to this chinchilla tryin' to
Touch the ostrich

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Umm... microphone check twelve or just one two
I am me, who are...
And I'm one too, high, you should look, up to me
My French girls love it when we smoke the oohwee (translate)
Um bellan France, I don't when we smoke the oohwee
I do me, she feel me comin' like new teeth(ow!)
I got paper like loose leaf
Come over here and maybe you can get a few sheets
My body's unique like the Sistene chapel
Fresh, six green apples
I should cut myself to see, if my blood's red
Baby I brainstorm, call me Floodhead
Married to the money, and if she leaves me bury me money
And when you're not good then ya arrogance is funny
And when you're really rich, then asparagus is yummy
Weezy F. Baby

Hold up (Hold Up), we jammin

[Hook]
I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)
Cause I'm comin down, playin surround and livin these ho's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin maids and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)
Deep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
I'm comin up (choppin on dubs and showin 'em love)
2000-Fizive and you are not fly enough (young bitch)
Uhhh Hold up young bitch-bitch I just don't wanna stop comin'up

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uhhh it's never too much the paper I make
These other pussy niggas ain't real them ho's fake
I'm Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch
I treat you good because you know I'm rich
I was in the ghetto-had nothin'
Sold alot of records and grabbed somethin
Now I'm goin through movies in L.A
Playin the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm tryna get my mothafuckin paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they record sound shitty
When I see you in the town I'm a hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up

[Hook]
I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)
Cause I'm comin down, playa surroundin-livin these ho's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin'blades and playin maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'-Comin Up

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is too valuable for me to play with life now
Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guilty just because now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can vividly remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin in wad's like blocks
Let's go half on a Yacht-I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I can't even hear you haters you've been muted by my paper chase

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Flip]
Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fifty-thousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now I'm smokin high dro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now I'm rockin clubs
After "Diamonds N Yo Face" I was coppin dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand
Rappers talk alot of shit but you ain't stoppin us
Look you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia (Huh)
Look you don't know shit about UGK
Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch I'm wearin
I'm the first cat in Houston with a black McLaren
Lil' Flipper tote pistols for them non believers
Cause down here we poppin trunks on Cadillacs and Regals (Oh boy)

[Hook]

[Pimp C]
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
I'm comin up (choppin on dubs and showin 'em love)

[Pimp C]
My paint too wet bitch, never pay my set bitch
Blue and red make green, just cash the check bitch
Went to the store a lot, bought me a vanguish{?}
Never trick my money in the club with a skank bitch
Big shrimp on my plate, look like dolphins (dolphins)
Pushin cookies in the soft ones
I can do better by myself, not bad (bad)
Girl ate the whole thing if she call me Chad (Chad)
The records ain't sellin up there, they mad (mad)
Rappin like us gotta hit but you a fag
I'm a young country nigga, uncut like snow (snow)
Make them young girls get down on the flo' (flo')
Make them young niggas put candy on the 'Llac
You got clouds in them diamonds, take that monkey shit back
Cause I'm smokin out, throwin up, keep that lean off in my cup
Smokin out, throwin up, keep that heat off in our truck

[Hook: Nelly, Pimp C, Sean P]
When I hit the parkin lot, and the fifth wheel drop
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me!)
When I'm fresh from the jeweler and it's sunny outside
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me!)
When I'm creased up, J'd up, E's and my K's up
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me!)
From all them niggas that's trill to them niggas unreal
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me) uh-uh
So quit it mayne (lil' boy) cut it out (look here)
Quit it mayne (lil' boy) cut it out (look here)

[Nelly]
I ain't choose yo' chick, yo' chick chose me
I ain't gotta pick one, I'mma take all these
For every hundred you got, I'mma peel off three
Hey, don't worry 'bout it lil' boy, that bill on me
Eight years now, you can call me a vet
That money you grossin, call that a fourth of my neck
We don't call paint shiny, we call paint wet
A Darryl Strawberry colored Coupe, call that a Met
Got a few rides already, got a few more to cop
Got a blue one that's hard, got a black one that dropped
Got a Buick that's green, the same color my snot
Lil' daddy you ain't the shit, you might as well get off the pot
That's some new St. Louis shit, yeah that's funny
But I'mma stick with the old, the new don't make enough money
So when I'm on (wipe me down) when they dirty (wipe 'em down)
You think I showed my ass befo', sit front row (and watch me now)
Cause my grandmomma hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Said my grandmomma hate it, but my lil' mama love it

[Hook]

[Sean P]
28 inches sittin tall, it's ridiculous
With a slum yellow bitch cause that's the type I kick it with
Ride with a stupid pack, and a couple stupid cats
They call us the Goon Squad, so you know we stupid strapped
Shuttin down the parkin lot, we doin the moonwalk
I ain't stuntin ass ho, cause I'm tryin to pillow talk
I be where that work at, where niggas get murked at
Earth is spread, then we mounted up and drop the purp' back
Can't you tell I'm hood rich? You ain't from my hood bitch?
Don't you see the leather seats? The way we grip the wood pimp?
Goin hard on 'em (goin hard on 'em) rocks shined on 'em (rocks shined on 'em)
Bust up out a hood, this is our grind money
If we pop the bands on 'em (pop a band) throwin grands on 'em (throwin grands)
Nelly grab the wheel and make the Chevy dance on 'em
I'm a block star (block star) ain't a phony nigga (nah never)
A phone call'll have them youngsters all on ya nigga

[Nelly]
So don't start no shit, won't be no shit!
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit, boy!

[Hook][Hook: Pimp C singing]
You lost yo' spot when you went pop
CD flopped, you ain't hot..
But the game been good to meeeee...
(Hol' up, hol' up bitch!)
You lost your cars, and yo' house
Now you sleep on yo' mama's couch
But the game been good to meeeee...

[Pimp C - Verse One]
UHH, first album went platinum, now you can't go gold
Made ya deal with the devil, but you sold yo' soul
You rent a lotta cars, rent a mansion and them hoes
You say you sold your Phantom, bitch they took yo' Rolls
Get disrespected everywhere you go
Big bodyguards when you come for the shows
They already know you got shit on your name
Nigga, you a pussy, they gon' take yo' chain
Take yo' piece, rings and watch
You play rich, boy you need to stop
I ain't dissin nobody, no particular name
Ya shoe fit nigga, get the fuck up out the game - lil' BITCH!

[Hook]

(Pussy nigguuuh..)

[Bun B - Verse Two]
I'm a Down South MC, I'm cold on the mic
I say it how I feel and I do it how I like
I write what I see, what I do, and what I know
And keep it one hundred off top from the do'
Now whether at a show, in the booth, or on the street
No matter where I go and no matter who I meet
Everybody tryna tell me how they feel 'bout the South
On the cool, them haters need to shut they fuckin mouth
Cause we grip grain, nigga we pop trunk
We to' straps and we ready for the funk
Some niggas two-step, some niggas dance
Some niggas just ball wit' a bottle in they hands
Sell a couple ringtones niggas, that's bread
You hatin on paper get that FUCK up out yo' head
Worryin 'bout my cheese, getcha own stack
It's goin down in the South, you don't like it
Click clack, motherfucker!

[Hook]

(Pussy nigguuuh..)

[Pimp C - Verse Three]
You got caught with that work on 10
Made a deal with the state to turn your foul partner in
But he took 15, befo' you could tell
He ain't witchu no mo' ho, you got twenty in a cell
I sent you a lawyer, you ain't listened that time
Ain't no appeal, but they dropped it to five?
Who you had to fuck to give back that time?
Textin me from a cell phone - bitch, yo lost YO' FUCKIN MIND?
How dare you tryna get me on conspiracy, Jack?
If the feds hit me, I'mma hit yo' ass BACK!
You fight witcho tounge, I send 'em killa
Transcript writer, I'll kill you nigguuuh!

[Hook]

(Smoke sum'hin, bitch..)

[Hook 2: Pimp C singing]
Got caught with the shit, twenty years
Youse a snitch, you turned biiii-tch..
The game been good to meeeee...
(Hol' up, bitch!)
I took yo' ho, she's a pro
Bought me all, of yo' dough..
The game been good to meeeee...
(Pussy nigguuuh..)[Intro: Pimp C]
Yeah, coming down
Dedicated to them boys riding slab

[Hook]
I fli-, I flips down the Ave
Know I'm looking good
I'm banging "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I flip down the Ave., you know I'm looking tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine, nigga never do that
Who say he going through a thang, when y'all ain't never lied
I gotta baby, but his mama act like he ain't mine
Wicked women, using children to live on
Wanna hurt and try to hate, cause she know the thrill is gone
Wanna hurt and try to hate, cause she know the thrill is gone
Say man, I stopped smoking wit' haters back in ninety-four
But niggas thinking that a Sweet gong get him through my door
But niggas talk alotta shit, in a safe place
I know cause he can't look me eye-to-eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my beats, and see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, ain't all what it look like
So I keep swanging, out here clanging tryna live my life

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I see these niggas and days, go and come
And for me, just to wake, I know I'm blessed
I grab my 'ses and split my Swisher wit' my thumb
Some of my Sweets be tight, now some of my Sweets be fucked up!
But alla' my Sweets gon' blow, so killa' smoke get sucked up!
I looked up today, and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say, tomorrow they won't be blasting this-a-way
I'm puffin' spliff's of hay, still upset about the drama here
At this time of year, I'm wiping away my dead homies mama tears (Shit)
But naturally, them fucking laws was always after me
So I have to be, in that manor on that five-oh-three
I'm living dastardly, must be all about survival 'g
These niggas passing me, streets just keep on getting live wit' me
They said there has to be another way, but I ain't feeling that
They tried to steal a Lac, and my wig, they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains, it's all about the 'cain
"Swang and Bang", peace to ESG and all the victims of the game, mang

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Flipping through the Ave, tryina see some good
But everythang is still the same, in my neighborhood
Niggas frown when you up, and smile when you down
And when you change for the better, shife fools stop coming around
I see the jealousy and hating and the wicked ways
We all lost children, praisin' paper, smoking our life away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me, but all we do now is fuck and fight
My conscience fuck wit' me so much that I can't eat or sleep
The other side of selling dope, and out there running the streets
And even though I'm gaining street fame, coming from this rap game
Lustful thinking and compulsive drinking is a normal thang
Some get erased and misplaced, trying to win the race
Some try to hold on to they place, by smoking wit' lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gon' change the hood
I'm smoking skunk and popping the trunk to make me feel good

[Hook][Intro: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, already
Two underground kings, one underground legend
I've been in my dickies, my black flags since day one
Yeah, Pimp where you at?

[Hook: Pimp C]
Got my dickies on ho

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uhhhhh, Uhhhhh
I'm Pimp C bitch, got my dickies on ho
Keep a chrome .44 and a bumper full of snow
Got red dickies, white dickies, orange dickies too
And I even got the blue for when I represent for Screw
Nigga, I been wearing khakis since before that shit was cool
Fucking with Jon Johnson wearing dickies to the school
With them hard heads packed a condomn, gangsta night
Way before I had a record, I was rocking the mic
Got a pocket full of stones nigga
Call me Sweet Jones nigga
You girl love me, she can't leave my dick alone nigga
Cause she a carnivore
Take the leash off the bitch cause she a real live whore

[Hook: Pimp C]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Say man I'm fresh off the west side of 9th street soldier
I be up on my grind early morning, no Folgers
No Starbucks, nigga no latte
Need it for me, I hit up the streets and get it grande
Hit the swap meet, I head up to the flea market
Swang the candy slab through and let 'em watch a G park it
I'm buying Jordans or them thousand dollar I.D's
And a fresh pair of dickies that's how I be
I'm khaki'd up, I'm creased tight
With no cuffs, yeah that's right
Strapped in the back, not in the front
Tec on the side, 'bout to smoke a blunt
So pass the strawberry Philly bro
Or the Swisher Sweet cigarillo really though
And fill it up with the sticky
Make sure the ashes don't fall on my dickies

[Hook: Pimp C]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Got my dickies on ho, got my tickets on bitch
Young fresh nigga, hundred thousand dollar outfit
Got a new one everyday, hundred dollars ain't shit
Made a hundred for the fit, left a hundred dollar tip
One time I lost a crip, tax in Missisip
I'll tell you 'bout it later, bet you niggas gon' trip
Ask me how I did it, I tell them clientele
Now everybody hating on me, that why the hell he ain't in jail
Bitch I ain't in jail cause I'm a muhh'fucking G
Making dirty money so I put it in the clean
Lights going on, baby way too many carats
Watch keep blushing, got a young nigga embarrassed
Hate where you, no way you always sitting Ferris (wheel)
Look into the mirror, changes scare me
M.O.B that's how the rich got rich
22-20 make a real nigga snitch

[Hook: Pimp C]

Got in this game so heavily, just like Frankie Beverly
Silly nigga that Southern girl
Put cocaine up in your world
Cause I'm a young ass nigga on the slab
Comin through in a whippin Nav'
I used to be out on the ave
But now all my keys got the Midas stamp
