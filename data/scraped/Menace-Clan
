Hey yo, check dis dope ass beat out
Willie back in da muthafuckin house and i got my niggas
Da menace clan on dis one to help me out
And we representin our god damn selves
Cuz how da fuck
You gona tell me how to get to where I'm goin
When you dont know where da fuck you goin
Man das da blind leadin da muthafuckin blind

I could'v been a leader not a follower a coach not a balla
I could've had progress
I could've lived wit less stress
But i took it upon myself and played da card i wuz delt
Thought about my self
Fuck everyone else
And they said fuck me too
But it was cool like that
See my mission was paper chasin and puttin da hood aon da map
Now i've done been there
Done that
Took one step and dew back
For da life i wuz takin
Wut da fuck wuz i thinkin
Should'v slowed it down but i wuz speedin
And i wuz stuck with a code
And niggas waitin around to see if i wuz gonna come up befo
But i can fold like a bitch
Seen da chance to switch
But i wuz brought up yo make it
Seen da chance to take it
Find a rule and break it
Take a badge and shake it
And against all odds
Get da fuck outta dodge
But I'm a nigga wit records dat da state can't file
Young, blind, and wild
An uncontrollable child in da ghetto
But seddling fo mo everyday
And when i make up my mind I'm gonna get back in line but now I'm
Chorus 2x

Blind leadin da blind
In a world of wars i search for peace of mind my stabillity
Fo my niggas and me said da way life wuz supposed to be in da ghetto

I looked out my window wut did i see
It wuz a crack head nigga starin dead at me
He said can i get a muthafuckin nickle for three
I told his ass to da better in his rorock swetta
He got a daughter he ain't fed her
He'd rather get high
In his eye i see da demon
I can hear babies screamin
Feenin
It demeaning to see him
To be in the ghetto
But this is where i settle
Now wut would you do wit a strap in yo hand
Gangstas do wut dey wunt to
Suckas do wut dey can
My role modle sips on a forty botlle
In his footsteps i follow grab da brew and take a swallow
I've been livin on da streets since da age of thirteen
Cuz i wuz sick of being raised by a dope fiend i so seen
Babies need similac money dat wuz meant for similac wuz spent on crack
Now do you wanna
No i dont and its a liquor sto on every cona
And niggas ain't da owna
Now listen, we can't afford to send our kids to school but dey got da
Knowledge
To spend dey money on da chaps when we could send our kids to college
Now here we are: hoes, dopes, dealers, and bums
At da white man's table still beggin fo crumbs but its da
Chorus 2x

Niggas shoot ball
(niggas shoot da logs)
Nigas shoot da doves
(niggas shoot to love)
Niggas shoot up
(niggas shoot pool)
But watch out cuz niggas shoot niggas too
So wut da fuck am i to do when niggas fallin down like flies
And dis muthafuckin money starin me in da eyes
And my brother sayin come on in stop buggin
But we done already lost 3 uncles and 5 cousins
To da streets niggas shit deep
No room fo da maple leafs
Cuz muthafuckas play fo keep
I wunt respect when i step on da field
Saw a nigga dat killed i gotta kill befo deez niggas get sum bright ideals
And start thinkin we hoes or sumthin
So when i see dat muthafucka nigga nigga staight dumpin
Chorus 2xYou can run
You can hide
You can wear a bulletproof vest
But I'll catch ya
There is no escape
I'm the bullet, nigga
You'll never get away from me
I'm the bullet, nigga

[ VERSE: 1 ]
I sit all day in the clip
With 15 others, hollow point tip
Waitin for a nigga to set-trip
I might be on your hip
Or under the car seat
It's cold outside so niggas always carry heat, that's me
The motherfucking b-u-l-l-e-t, nigga, everybody depends on me
You cock the Glock, squeeze the trigger
I get hit by the pin and then exit through the barrel
Trough your skin, through your heart, break off your spine
When I come out the 9, .380, Uzi or the Tec
Make your brand new t-shirt wet
Groovin through your set
Fuckin up your party, don't know, ask somebody
You'll probably die, out the window I fly drive-by
I make your mama cry, don't doubt me
See you niggas can't survive without me
Fuck the ballistics, you know nothing about me
Ain't no name on me
Watch your aim, homie
You can make me, but can't break me
I'mma make you break yo'self, nigga, break yo'self
Gimme the cash, the jewels, the keys to your car
You can run, you won't get far, I'll catch you
I'm the bullet, remember?
Niggas call me heat, I'm cold as December
When I enter the chamber
I'm known for fuckin up the LA gang banger
The 9 is a bitch, she talks shit, starts battlin
Now I'm in your body travellin
Your whole world's unravellin
Never thought them niggas would come back like this
Menace niggas be movin when I be groovin
You can find me where the murder at
Trace me back to the gat
But you gon still get jacked
And I

Sit all day in the clip, waitin for a nigga to set-trip
16 motherfucking hollow point tips
Biaaatch

Ain't no wars without me, nigga, don't never doubt me
I'm the motherfucking sure fire, murderer for hire
Nigga, you can catch me in any pawn-shop
Motherfuckers know I go pop
You'se a fool
And I'm the motherfucking tool
Ha ha ha, nigga

[ VERSE: 2 ]
Niggas like to roll with me
I'm a toy when I'm empty
Government-issued, miss you, nah don't toss me
In a fucking back yard, I'mma make a nigga hard
Plus when we on a coupe I gets to roll with his broad
Got to keep me cocked, I'm a-fuckin when I'm buckin
Go in with me and I bet ya comin out with something
A case of the cash, plus a hole in yo ass
When you hear me speakin hear a motherfuckin blast
Penetentiary steel, smoke, grain or chrome
Fuck 911, I was hip before the phone
Everybody's heard of me, I cause emergencies
Keep your hands off of me, and everything'll be cool
I make a civil man a fool, they got me in the schools
Cos there ain't no motherfucking rules
The extension of a Menace, the start and the finish
Populations diminish, all because of me
22, 45, Glock 23, I'm a son of a gun
My grandpa's a rifle, trifling trick
Stare down my 8-inch dick
You don't want a motherfucker pullin my leg
Headshots are comin, a hinder me
And motherfuckers runnin for they life, I was there
When a cracker shot his wife and his two kids
Then himself in the head, laid me on the bed
I ain't dead, I'm a killer
The realest of the realest, I'm the one who did it
My nuts ain't got no name, so who you gon' blame?

1 shot to the dome
The guns
The bullet, the gun..[Intro: Easy Mo Bee]

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline
I want a presidential Roley (So)
So I crush MCs to guacamole, making Robin scream, "Holy moley!"
Big Poppa, fuck a cape, I'm that Paper Crusader
Playing Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Coolio]
I shot dice with a priest and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I , loc, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lawn, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

[Doodlebug]
Well, I travel the land like my man in Kung Fu
Marching up this hip-hop scene with my Digable crew
Now you and you know the science so don't front
Cause Brooklyn won't front, nah we don't front
In fact, it's getting like a Daily Operation
See Knowledge Born represents my young nation
And I'm facing opposition in every form
So my Manchu Squad seven odds is on a swarm, like crazily
Cause it don't pay to be, a black man in a land of mental slavery
They say Cash Rules Everything Around Me, true
So what I got to do to be as lavish as you?
I don't roll with no crew, and do the same old same
So I travel the seventh plane by way of Coltrane
Now that's an ill thought, niggas get caught in my wisdom
Because the number Seven is like the master of a rhythm

[Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fakes fell when my heat made a sound
Now, hogging nonbelievers gonna fall
When my niggas make the fucking final call
We started out small, now we got 'em stepping nationwide
1995, one minute, heads are gonna fly
With that rootin' tootin', Southside shooting
Booting any nigga who ain't trooping with Huey Newton
Fuck disputing and it's time for a change
Nigga, what you gon' do, when we rearrange the game?
Blow 'em out the frame with new ideas
We's about to gain leverage putting it down out here

I stepped in the jam with the god on my side
And the god S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
"Yo, throw the wax on" "How many emcees must get dissed"
The mist from the blunt smoke decides who's next on my list
Can you feel the hiss from the snake moving my direction?
No u-turn, you getting burned from the sun in my intersection
The god has spoken, sword stroken
If you think you ready for a fair one, pay your token
On my soul train, control your brain
Bucktown representative, break it down like a ki' of cocaine
Straight from the lab, and I still elevate past the snakes in the grass
Fuck it

[Redman]
It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the best, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical buck-buck, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Ill Al Skratch]
Aiyyo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy like Mo Bee
The ex-convict on some Vietnam shit, criminal
On the subliminal, (Niggas!) watch what your women do
All the bitches wanna know why the frames I (rock)
That's just the "blacka blam" from the Glock
Bear witness, (to my mental fitness, no fear,)
Precaution, (maybe) too se-(vere) for your (ear)
People round pro, on the down low, let off a round slow
Subtle, (and leave you in a) puddle
Breaker, Breaker, 1,9
Cause it ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like that

[Rock]
I can rhyme as long as my dick, get bucked
I grabs the mic and I do's what the fuck I want
I'll outlast any blunt,  White Owl, Philly or a Dutch Master
Raw like a natural disaster, as I crack ya ass like cheap plaster
I might bash ya, while my tongue lash ya, when the Rock cruise, I crash ya, Leave or get your car wrecked
And I give a tribute to the Ripper Tek, and I slash ya
After I'm show that you jokes, I go see my bro with the 'fro when we toast
All the punks 'pon the planet, plus every single fool
Cause without all of y'all, Heltah Skeltah wouldn't prove what we do

[Layzie Bone]
Putting your shit to the pavement, them meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased
Bone, my deadly fist of brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Wish Bone]
Deliver the psychopath, so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once again
Enough to pick a defender they try to contend us
See, all they gon' win is that Mac-10
There's never another to go with a brother
While smotherin' suckas been gon' undercover
We leave em in gutters, ain’t gonna get caught. But who was the sucker that squealed on a murda?

[Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street, sweeper, better R.I.P. and pray
The bullet don't put in much work but I'm a sure, wit, shot
Puttin' the bullets just where it hurts, and um

Better be nothing to me, you set up, wet up, get 'em on the get up, Bone won't let up

Hey, you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You better believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me coincide, "Please give me room, yo step aside"
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[Dee]
I hang with blacks and you hang with whites
I pack a nine and  I don't like fights
I'm from the deepest darkest ghetto streets of South Central L.A.,
I jack for Jewels, watch where you bail
It's right across the street from Hell
And no one said to repent, went to the liquor store
Blast on the cashier, just like I did last year
Now tell me if you was there, would you be down?
When them black boys beat Reginald Denny to the ground?
Now, a brother beat me for a dollar, I shot him for the buck of it
I try to rap (?) some white people, they said change that shit
This is West Coast Rap-A-Lot
I smoke the Houston Astrals Hat a lot
I shot a punk for hitting me up

[Assassin]
Down to wet something up, that's opposing my cause
What's the difference between this and Hell with gasoline drawers? I live a sick lifestyle, my profile shows I'm in this
Handling business, to defend this, Justice is cause for action
My people tell me "don't hold a strap, Man"
I don't give a damn, South Central and
Looking out for the black man, struggling with my brother man
Roll with the Clan, brokers ride the Tascam
It's us against the man, and I'ma damn get shot
They'll have to put me into jail, cause I ain't going for the clock
Turning pig wigs to mop, time for the bullshit to stop
I got a hood I die for, been organized since '64

[Jamal]
Jamal gets down, the master of bringing the massacre
Rolling on crews like Pirellis on Acuras
If you don't believe my steez is real
You can check the emptiness of my Glock 9-mil'
It don't matter which way you come
I still be the nigga calling shots with the gun
I lick one shot, I make your whole squad run
None is about to fuck with the son
Mally G, I never kick a rhyme for free
Function rap skills, I come live like TV
For all of y'all, I come across to be real
With super shit like Fall Guy, in lines to make 'em all die
Infrared beams, mind full of schemes
95 'til keep it real, get the cream
Fuck around and get dropped, it don't stop, Nahmean?Even though I live in Cali, nigga, it's cold out here
When I step out the house, it's like steppin in a freezer
Either he wants to get me or she wants to stick me
I swear, I don't know how the fuck I made it past 20
I can spit some cold shit, always keep heat, so I'm safe
From gettin frost-bit, hit a corner and a corner after I bust
So I can toss it, I think everybody's lost it
And I'm the only nigga left sane maintainin, nigga

Nigga, it's cold outside, so I always carry my heat
An enemy hood on feet, groovin through the alleys and backstreets
Creepin on the east side, hopin I don't get spotted
The world is cold so I stay hot like a Glock after I just shot it
But when I say it's cold outside, fuck you jacker
The Tec-9 is my heat and you know I always pack it

Nigga, my brain ain't strainin long as I'm aimin back
It's a motherfucking fact, this is a cold world
So fuck the whole world, cos I don't owe this world nothing
A bankroll's the only thing I'm cuttin fo'
So I can hold something, I gives a fuck about nothing
But fucking and popping, what, you don't hear me or something?

[ Hook ]
I say these niggas is cold outside so I always carry my heat
It's a cold world, so fuck the whole world

Supply your own heat

No matter the weather
A Menace is something that comes off the barrel of a Beretta
I make your t-shirt wet, your sweater wetter
Cos in the South Central it's freezin, little locs and OG's and
Police and crack fiends fiendin, thievin, I believe in
T-shirt, Levi's, St. Ives, ( ? ) and Chucks
Snatchin crackers out their trucks, now, that's some cold shit
Niggas shootin at the police, that's some bold shit
Watch where you goin, what you wearin, who you stroll with

Supply your own heat, cos it's cold in the street
And a nigga without it shoulda have thought about it
Or bein 6 feet, got to be as scandalous as Los Angeles
Get you something so you can handle this, the Menace way
Gun play and funerals dates is all I'm concerned with
You won't catch me in LA without my shit because I know

Here come the police yellin "Freeze"
Cos I'm groovin with my G's
The hood is gettin hot, now the homies is chillin
On the west side of LA, you know who's doin all the killin
I send shouts to South Central, Compton, Watts and fuck the cops
I shot six, I dare for one of you busters hit me up
It's some cold niggas in LA, but I ain't never been burned
I learned

[ Hook ]

Watch who you fuckin with and who you talk shit to
Because a nigga will dump and give two fucks about you
Heat, a nigga need it where I'm from
Fuck words when a nigga got a gun and his ass ain't playin
Sprayin and you stuck behind the truck without no get-back
Fuck that, I keep a strap, don't worry about where it's at
I got a nigga before he got me with my Mac-10
Before the bullets all gone I loads my shit up again
Can't take no ass-whippin, I'm a sore loser
Anybody manoeuvre on the streets, break out the white sheets
Turn up the heater with my 9 millimeter, PD-roll a nigga
That I hold a nigga, little locs are colder niggas than the older niggas
It never snows, just six-fo's, afros, ho's, niggas with Jherri curls
It's a cold world, supply your own heat
I sell your ass some fake, fuck you ain't the first to get beat
I'm tellin youWe can take over the world, he said
And it's plenty gold in my country, he said
A 1000 men make a company, he said
But I gotta put into your butt lead, I say

When it's dark fuck the dumb, I'm on the run
Go to the shack for somebody black that wanna come
Original man in a swamp land habitat
Old man said, "Don't go," but fuck that
I gotta be free, they can't catch me
Cause I'm too quick for 'em, see?
Check the north star, goin' real far north
A straight line is designed for the shortest course
So a crooked devil wants me back now
He let his dogs go to chase this black down
But I ain't down with being caught, so I fought back
They gotta drag them a bleeding dead nigga back
But not like that, fool, I ain't going out
Before I do I bet I take one of these crackers out
(Freedom, freedom!) Fuck yeah, I killed him
(Freedom, freedom!) Now should I bury him? (Fuck nah!)
Fuck nah, he didn't do the same for my grandpa
Grandpa died with his finger like fuck y'all
Ran through the woods ( ? ) and I step in
Made a haystack for a black man that's sleeping
Next day well on my way up north
(Surround the nigga) trip cut short
Standing in the middle, know I'm black till the end
Waiting, in a second now the shots will begin
25 shotguns pointed at me, fuck y'all devils, now I'm free
Motherfucker, you'll never catch me

Runaway slave, I'm out of here ( ? ), I'm outtie

I'm a motherfucking slave, I'm tired, I'm thirsty and I'm hungry
Picking cotton to build a white man's country
My mother's working hard and she's dying of starvation
Never seen my brother, he's on another plantation
My father fought back, he wasn't going for this
Now he's hanging from a tree in the forest (damn)
My little sister gets raped and beaten
Nothing but dirty water and pork for eating
I can't take this shit no longer
As I work harder I get stronger and stronger
Looking at my chains and my chains are rusty red
( ?Look at? ) the bull grip, he don't trust me
But I'mma chill and wait till 12 o'clock
Pick up a rock, hit the chain and it broke in half (I'm out of here)
Now feel the wrath of a runaway slave
But I'm gonna stay brave
When I'm getting free I'm putting pale face in the grave
Thinking about my people and how I'm gonna free them
Pass my father body still hanging from a tree limb
Running and running and on the trail there's some dobermans
The smell of a sweaty black nigga, yeah, they know the scent
Picking up ground and I started to run faster
Double barrel pump fired by the slave master
I hid in some bushes so I can catch my breath
Trying to gather up the strength that I had left
If I could rest for a second I'd be gone
Oh shit, there goes the dobermans, the chase is back on
Them wanna catch me, them wanna take my freedom
Them can't catch me, them can't have my freedom
Them took it once I want it back, gimme my freedom
I kept on running, I thought I had 'em beaten
Until I ran into the middle of a Ku Klux Klan meeting
They all stopped, as they stood there staring at me
I must have seen a 100 guns they had pointed at me
White robes, white hoods, blue eyes
6 dobermans chewing on my thighs
I took a deep breath cause I knew what time it was
Just before they pulled their triggers I yelled, "Fuck y'all crackers!"We can take over the world, he said
And it's plenty gold in my country, he said
A 1000 men make a company, he said

So it's me, myself and I , loc, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lawn, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

[Doodlebug]
Well, I travel the land like my man in Kung Fu
Marching up this hip-hop scene with my Digable crew
Now you and you know the science so don't front
Cause Brooklyn won't front, nah we don't front
In fact, it's getting like a Daily Operation
See Knowledge Born represents my young nation
And I'm facing opposition in every form
So my Manchu Squad seven odds is on a swarm, like crazily
Cause it don't pay to be, a black man in a land of mental slavery
They say Cash Rules Everything Around Me, true
So what I got to do to be as lavish as you?
I don't roll with no crew, and do the same old same
So I travel the seventh plane by way of Coltrane
Now that's an ill thought, niggas get caught in my wisdom
Because the number Seven is like the master of a rhythm

[Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fakes fell when my heat made a sound
Now, hogging nonbelievers gonna fall
When my niggas make the fucking final call
We started out small, now we got 'em stepping nationwide
1995, one minute, heads are gonna fly
With that rootin' tootin', Southside shooting
Booting any nigga who ain't trooping with Huey Newton
Fuck disputing and it's time for a change
Nigga, what you gon' do, when we rearrange the game?
Blow 'em out the frame with new ideas
We's about to gain leverage putting it down out here

Break 1: Easy Mo Bee
{*scratching*}
"Go for mine, and run down the line"
{*scratching*}
"Go for mine, and run down the line"

[Buckshot]
I stepped in the jam with the god on my side
And the god S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
"Yo, throw the wax on" "How many emcees must get dissed"
The mist from the blunt smoke decides who's next on my list
Can you feel the hiss from the snake moving my direction?
No u-turn, you getting burned from the sun in my intersection
The god has spoken, sword stroken
If you think you ready for a fair one, pay your token
On my soul train, control your brain
Bucktown representative, break it down like a ki' of cocaine
Straight from the lab, and I still elevate past the snakes in the grass
Fuck it

[Redman]
It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the best, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical buck-buck, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Ill Al Skratch]
Aiyyo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy like Mo Bee
The ex-convict on some Vietnam shit, criminal
On the subliminal, (Niggas!) watch what your women do
All the bitches wanna know why the frames I (rock)
That's just the "blacka blam" from the Glock
Bear witness, (to my mental fitness, no fear,)
Precaution, (maybe) too se-(vere) for your (ear)
People round pro, on the down low, let off a round slow
Subtle, (and leave you in a) puddle
Breaker, Breaker, 1,9
Cause it ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like that

[Rock]
I can rhyme as long as my dick, get bucked
I grabs the mic and I do's what the fuck I want
I'll outlast any blunt,  White Owl, Philly or a Dutch Master
Raw like a natural disaster, as I crack ya ass like cheap plaster
I might bash ya, while my tongue lash ya, when the Rock cruise, I crash ya, Leave or get your car wrecked
And I give a tribute to the Ripper Tek, and I slash ya
After I'm show that you jokes, I go see my bro with the 'fro when we toast
All the punks 'pon the planet, plus every single fool
Cause without all of y'all, Heltah Skeltah wouldn't prove what we do

[Layzie Bone]
Putting your shit to the pavement, them meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased
Bone, my deadly fist of brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Wish Bone]
Deliver the psychopath, so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once again
Enough to pick a defender they try to contend us
See, all they gon' win is that Mac-10
There's never another to go with a brother
While smotherin' suckas been gon' undercover
We leave em in gutters, ain’t gonna get caught. But who was the sucker that squealed on a murda?

[Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street, sweeper, better R.I.P. and pray
The bullet don't put in much work but I'm a sure, wit, shot
Puttin' the bullets just where it hurts, and um
With a me tech'll slip up one on the popos, Bone, Bone
Better be nothing to me, you set up, wet up, get 'em on the get up, Bone won't let up

Break 2: Easy Mo Bee

"Go for mine, and run down the line"

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey, you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You better believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me coincide, "Please give me room, yo step aside"
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[Dee]
I hang with blacks and you hang with whites
I pack a nine and  I don't like fights
I'm from the deepest darkest ghetto streets of South Central L.A.,
I jack for Jewels, watch where you bail
It's right across the street from Hell
And no one said to repent, went to the liquor store
Blast on the cashier, just like I did last year
Now tell me if you was there, would you be down?
When them black boys beat Reginald Denny to the ground?
Now, a brother beat me for a dollar, I shot him for the buck of it
I try to rap (?) some white people, they said change that shit
This is West Coast Rap-A-Lot
I smoke the Houston Astrals Hat a lot
I shot a punk for hitting me up

[Assassin]
Down to wet something up, that's opposing my cause
What's the difference between this and Hell with gasoline drawers? I live a sick lifestyle, my profile shows I'm in this
Handling business, to defend this, Justice is cause for action
My people tell me "don't hold a strap, Man"
I don't give a damn, South Central and
Looking out for the black man, struggling with my brother man
Roll with the Clan, brokers ride the Tascam
It's us against the man, and I'ma damn get shot
They'll have to put me into jail, cause I ain't going for the clock
Turning pig wigs to mop, time for the bullshit to stop
I got a hood I die for, been organized since '64

[Jamal]
Jamal gets down, the master of bringing the massacre
Rolling on crews like Pirellis on Acuras
If you don't believe my steez is real
You can check the emptiness of my Glock 9-mil'
It don't matter which way you come
I still be the nigga calling shots with the gun
I lick one shot, I make your whole squad run
None is about to fuck with the son
Mally G, I never kick a rhyme for free
Function rap skills, I come live like TV
For all of y'all, I come across to be real
With super shit like Fall Guy, in lines to make 'em all die
Infrared beams, mind full of schemes
95 'til keep it real, get the cream
Fuck around and get dropped, it don't stop, Nahmean?Hey yo, check dis dope ass beat out
Willie back in da muthafuckin house and i got my niggas
Da menace clan on dis one to help me out
And we representin our god damn selves
Cuz how da fuck
You gona tell me how to get to where I'm goin
When you dont know where da fuck you goin
Man das da blind leadin da muthafuckin blind

I could'v been a leader not a follower a coach not a balla
I could've had progress
I could've lived wit less stress
But i took it upon myself and played da card i wuz delt
Thought about my self
Fuck everyone else
And they said fuck me too
But it was cool like that
See my mission was paper chasin and puttin da hood aon da map
Now i've done been there
Done that
Took one step and dew back
For da life i wuz takin
Wut da fuck wuz i thinkin
Should'v slowed it down but i wuz speedin
And i wuz stuck with a code
And niggas waitin around to see if i wuz gonna come up befo
But i can fold like a bitch
Seen da chance to switch
But i wuz brought up yo make it
Seen da chance to take it
Find a rule and break it
Take a badge and shake it
And against all odds
Get da fuck outta dodge
But I'm a nigga wit records dat da state can't file
Young, blind, and wild
An uncontrollable child in da ghetto
But seddling fo mo everyday
And when i make up my mind I'm gonna get back in line but now I'm
Chorus 2x

Blind leadin da blind
In a world of wars i search for peace of mind my stabillity
Fo my niggas and me said da way life wuz supposed to be in da ghetto

I looked out my window wut did i see
It wuz a crack head nigga starin dead at me
He said can i get a muthafuckin nickle for three
I told his ass to da better in his rorock swetta
He got a daughter he ain't fed her
He'd rather get high
In his eye i see da demon
I can hear babies screamin
Feenin
It demeaning to see him
To be in the ghetto
But this is where i settle
Now wut would you do wit a strap in yo hand
Gangstas do wut dey wunt to
Suckas do wut dey can
My role modle sips on a forty botlle
In his footsteps i follow grab da brew and take a swallow
I've been livin on da streets since da age of thirteen
Cuz i wuz sick of being raised by a dope fiend i so seen
Babies need similac money dat wuz meant for similac wuz spent on crack
Now do you wanna
No i dont and its a liquor sto on every cona
And niggas ain't da owna
Now listen, we can't afford to send our kids to school but dey got da
Knowledge
To spend dey money on da chaps when we could send our kids to college
Now here we are: hoes, dopes, dealers, and bums
At da white man's table still beggin fo crumbs but its da
Chorus 2x

Niggas shoot ball
(niggas shoot da logs)
Nigas shoot da doves
(niggas shoot to love)
Niggas shoot up
(niggas shoot pool)
But watch out cuz niggas shoot niggas too
So wut da fuck am i to do when niggas fallin down like flies
And dis muthafuckin money starin me in da eyes
And my brother sayin come on in stop buggin
But we done already lost 3 uncles and 5 cousins
To da streets niggas shit deep
No room fo da maple leafs
Cuz muthafuckas play fo keep
I wunt respect when i step on da field
Saw a nigga dat killed i gotta kill befo deez niggas get sum bright ideals
And start thinkin we hoes or sumthin
So when i see dat muthafucka nigga nigga staight dumpin
Chorus 2xEven though I live in Cali, nigga, it's cold out here
When I step out the house, it's like steppin in a freezer
Either he wants to get me or she wants to stick me
I swear, I don't know how the fuck I made it past 20
I can spit some cold shit, always keep heat, so I'm safe
From gettin frost-bit, hit a corner and a corner after I bust
So I can toss it, I think everybody's lost it
And I'm the only nigga left sane maintainin, nigga

Nigga, it's cold outside, so I always carry my heat
An enemy hood on feet, groovin through the alleys and backstreets
Creepin on the east side, hopin I don't get spotted
The world is cold so I stay hot like a Glock after I just shot it
But when I say it's cold outside, fuck you jacker
The Tec-9 is my heat and you know I always pack it

Nigga, my brain ain't strainin long as I'm aimin back
It's a motherfucking fact, this is a cold world
So fuck the whole world, cos I don't owe this world nothing
A bankroll's the only thing I'm cuttin fo'
So I can hold something, I gives a fuck about nothing
But fucking and popping, what, you don't hear me or something?

[ Hook ]
I say these niggas is cold outside so I always carry my heat
It's a cold world, so fuck the whole world

Supply your own heat

No matter the weather
A Menace is something that comes off the barrel of a Beretta
I make your t-shirt wet, your sweater wetter
Cos in the South Central it's freezin, little locs and OG's and
Police and crack fiends fiendin, thievin, I believe in
T-shirt, Levi's, St. Ives, ( ? ) and Chucks
Snatchin crackers out their trucks, now, that's some cold shit
Niggas shootin at the police, that's some bold shit
Watch where you goin, what you wearin, who you stroll with

Supply your own heat, cos it's cold in the street
And a nigga without it shoulda have thought about it
Or bein 6 feet, got to be as scandalous as Los Angeles
Get you something so you can handle this, the Menace way
Gun play and funerals dates is all I'm concerned with
You won't catch me in LA without my shit because I know

Here come the police yellin "Freeze"
Cos I'm groovin with my G's
The hood is gettin hot, now the homies is chillin
On the west side of LA, you know who's doin all the killin
I send shouts to South Central, Compton, Watts and fuck the cops
I shot six, I dare for one of you busters hit me up
It's some cold niggas in LA, but I ain't never been burned
I learned

[ Hook ]

Watch who you fuckin with and who you talk shit to
Because a nigga will dump and give two fucks about you
Heat, a nigga need it where I'm from
Fuck words when a nigga got a gun and his ass ain't playin
Sprayin and you stuck behind the truck without no get-back
Fuck that, I keep a strap, don't worry about where it's at
I got a nigga before he got me with my Mac-10
Before the bullets all gone I loads my shit up again
Can't take no ass-whippin, I'm a sore loser
Anybody manoeuvre on the streets, break out the white sheets
Turn up the heater with my 9 millimeter, PD-roll a nigga
That I hold a nigga, little locs are colder niggas than the older niggas
It never snows, just six-fo's, afros, ho's, niggas with Jherri curls
It's a cold world, supply your own heat
I sell your ass some fake, fuck you ain't the first to get beat
I'm tellin youYou can run
You can hide
You can wear a bulletproof vest
But I'll catch ya
There is no escape
I'm the bullet, nigga
You'll never get away from me
I'm the bullet, nigga

[ VERSE: 1 ]
I sit all day in the clip
With 15 others, hollow point tip
Waitin for a nigga to set-trip
I might be on your hip
Or under the car seat
It's cold outside so niggas always carry heat, that's me
The motherfucking b-u-l-l-e-t, nigga, everybody depends on me
You cock the Glock, squeeze the trigger
I get hit by the pin and then exit through the barrel
Trough your skin, through your heart, break off your spine
When I come out the 9, .380, Uzi or the Tec
Make your brand new t-shirt wet
Groovin through your set
Fuckin up your party, don't know, ask somebody
You'll probably die, out the window I fly drive-by
I make your mama cry, don't doubt me
See you niggas can't survive without me
Fuck the ballistics, you know nothing about me
Ain't no name on me
Watch your aim, homie
You can make me, but can't break me
I'mma make you break yo'self, nigga, break yo'self
Gimme the cash, the jewels, the keys to your car
You can run, you won't get far, I'll catch you
I'm the bullet, remember?
Niggas call me heat, I'm cold as December
When I enter the chamber
I'm known for fuckin up the LA gang banger
The 9 is a bitch, she talks shit, starts battlin
Now I'm in your body travellin
Your whole world's unravellin
Never thought them niggas would come back like this
Menace niggas be movin when I be groovin
You can find me where the murder at
Trace me back to the gat
But you gon still get jacked
And I

Sit all day in the clip, waitin for a nigga to set-trip
16 motherfucking hollow point tips
Biaaatch

Ain't no wars without me, nigga, don't never doubt me
I'm the motherfucking sure fire, murderer for hire
Nigga, you can catch me in any pawn-shop
Motherfuckers know I go pop
You'se a fool
And I'm the motherfucking tool
Ha ha ha, nigga

[ VERSE: 2 ]
Niggas like to roll with me
I'm a toy when I'm empty
Government-issued, miss you, nah don't toss me
In a fucking back yard, I'mma make a nigga hard
Plus when we on a coupe I gets to roll with his broad
Got to keep me cocked, I'm a-fuckin when I'm buckin
Go in with me and I bet ya comin out with something
A case of the cash, plus a hole in yo ass
When you hear me speakin hear a motherfuckin blast
Penetentiary steel, smoke, grain or chrome
Fuck 911, I was hip before the phone
Everybody's heard of me, I cause emergencies
Keep your hands off of me, and everything'll be cool
I make a civil man a fool, they got me in the schools
Cos there ain't no motherfucking rules
The extension of a Menace, the start and the finish
Populations diminish, all because of me
22, 45, Glock 23, I'm a son of a gun
My grandpa's a rifle, trifling trick
Stare down my 8-inch dick
You don't want a motherfucker pullin my leg
Headshots are comin, a hinder me
And motherfuckers runnin for they life, I was there
When a cracker shot his wife and his two kids
Then himself in the head, laid me on the bed
I ain't dead, I'm a killer
The realest of the realest, I'm the one who did it
My nuts ain't got no name, so who you gon' blame?

1 shot to the dome
The guns
The bullet, the gun..
