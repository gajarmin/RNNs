Which means season 2' gotta be an even bigger smash

Yo son you wanna see me, pull out your smart phone and IMDB me

Ask my wife Shah, she'll let you know
Don't question me, but act like ya heard
Had enthusiasm long before curb
Me and Matt Damon bought a zoo

Just like my man Jonah Hill
Cartoon voices I bring to life
Robot Chicken, Black Dy-na-mite
A show called The League and another called Bent
Thats not my resume, it's only a dent
So I'm bound to get paid on season 3
Or no JB on BET
JB is the mothafuckin' shit

[Break: Kevin]
The cypher continues

[Verse 2: Duane Martin]
Last year breakaway suit

When I get old I got the breakaway tooth
Breakaway show, breakaway spoof
I'm from Brooklyn, so you know I'm about the truth
Yo we so hot, other networks not
Started from the bottom, now we at the top
Real Husbands got the number one spot
We so conceited, cause the other shows conceded
Yo check it out my album in stores September 35th, go cop that

[Break: Kevin Hart]
Breakaway suits the cypher continues

[Verse 3: Boris Kodjoe]
Sowas habt ihr noch nie gesehen

Ein Traum, kaum zu glauben bis ich da war
No regrets it's a blessing to share a messaging
In my native languaging
All of these fools don't know what I'm saying though
Checking the subtitles while watching their own show
Who's the tallest? The ballest?
The one with the flawless, the finest
The halfest, the wideness [?]
The german chocolatest, the ab checkers
The one who nevertheless can teach you all some culture facts
"Real" is "echter", "husband" is "Ehemann"
Hollywood really dummy? Hollywood is Hollywood
They call us mitches with attitude
Who's they? Who do you think?
It's Kev, it makes him feel good

[Break: Kevin Hart & Nick Cannon]
It just got real...the cypher continues
That's a monkey with him

How I see now I'm the one they expect to spit
No boss thus far, no Ross no Rick
K-I-N-G, shout out to Tip
The only rapper in this bitch, no disrespect to Nick
More heart than Kevin, mo' tall and all
The realest husband in hollywood, no wife at all
Above the rim before Duane could crawl

Nigga what you say? Check the mise

[Verse 6: Chocolate Droppa]
Save the best for the last so let's get it
Drop a hunk of beef for a second so I can spit it
Matter of fact keep it going

Smack your girl then say "haha"

Get your sexy, sexy ass

And tell the DJ spin it back
And play this sexy ass song![Pre-Hook – Future]
I’m fresh to death, I need an ambulance
I like a bad Puerto Rican on a handstand
Never top out when she be wearing off in the club
I’m talking bout what that bitch be wearing off in my room

[Hook]
In my room, get it popping in them pajama pants
Get it popping in them pajama pants
In my room, get it popping in them pajama pants
Get it popping in them pajama pants

[Verse 1 – Nick Cannon]
Tell the white girls to pop it, tell the black girls to drop it
Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, do it again, don’t stop it
Don’t want to see you in no skirt
Don’t want to see you in no bra
Got some hoes and some hoes and some hoes in this house
She came in the club with her friends, so now I’m fucking her friends
You know how we go with them hating ass hoes (Yo it’s Nick Cannon and Migos!)
But don’t believe the rumors, fuck college girls and cougars
They creeping in my room tryna cut like Freddy Krueger

[Bridge][x2]
Them strippers I salute you, church girls, hallelujah
Even got your grandmamma twerk-twerking out her bloomers

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 2 – Takeoff]
She pop lock and drop it, and shawty Korean
She twerk it, she roll it, her body like Shakira
Migos, Nick Cannon, we wyling out
Lil mama she bad, she standing out
Trap out the bando, I’m hiding out
She twerking it, making that money for certain
She hit the bedroom and she squirting
[?], lord have mercy
Then I pull up in the Fisker, but never tell her that I miss her

[Verse 3 – Quavo]
She can pop it in pajamas, take her to the Bahamas
She can smoke up all my reefer, she be introduced to my mama
Like a pizza, delivery to the neighbors
And you can kiss me with Nick Cannon, wyling out on vacation
We on our way to the top, Migos party at the top floor
And you can’t attend this party ‘less you got on pajamas

[Verse 3 – Traphik]
I say, who got the nicest cakes up in they PJs
Could it be them east coast latino mamis twerking in BK
Or, could it be that LA face, with a but from the bay
Either way, put that cake in my face like it’s my b-day
She know just what she doing when she doing what she does
I take a couple shots up off her booty till I’m buzzed
Cause, I feel that Henny pumping through my blood
Don’t like my bitches skinny, I just like a little budge
So if you got that apple, maybe peach, maybe a plum
My banana’s in pajamas so watch out cause here I come
A movie from Nick Cannon cause I beat it like a drum
Got my hands up on her cakes and then I squeeze em till their crumbs
Wake up in the morning, make a sandwhich and I’m swazy
You cannot have my babys, I’m so sorry, please don’t hate me
She said if I wore my PJs then I thought that you would date me
I said no you had it backwards baby, I was only JP

Not all, now here's the news
I pick 'em up and drop 'em off to [school](undefined)
Larry David made J. B. smoove
I let J. B. hang with me and now J. B.'s cool
You got a fool in your crew?
Nigga please, my whole crew is the fool
Season 1 was the shit too cool
Now season 2, yeah a nigga renewed

And just watch me as I pat the wealth
And uh, step back with the Versace scarf
And uh, no tip, no biff, no barf
Nigga what you say? Check the mise
Is them pants leather? So is mines

[Verse 6: Chocolate Droppa]
Save the best for the last so let's get it
Drop a hunk of beef for a second so I can spit it
Matter of fact keep it going
I'm about to get raw, let's go
We wear white cause doves cry
This ain't your alibi
Smack your girl then say "haha"
Take it back cause I wanna say "bye"
Saw you last week didn't like your face
Saw you this week in the same place
That mean I don't travel
That mean I stay in the same place
Got your spit in your face
I got your girl looking (motions to body)
And she wearing all lace
Buck, buck, bang bang that's a gun homie
Look at you, what you wanna do? Run homie
I'm mad, I'm glad at the same time feeling all sad
I miss my dad
And sometimes that shit make me mad
But I'm back at being a real nigga
Spittin like I'm Tommy Hilfiger
Didn't like my clothes so I took em off
Now look at me, cough cough
That mean I'm sick
I'm too legit to quit
Like hammer without the dance moves
I'm looking at you and JB Smoove
Yeah run, run homie
Yeah that's Bobby Brown homie
Yeah, he is the king
I'm doing this cause he's a chicken wing
I'm on fire now
Look at me, man pull me out now
If you don't then say it won't stop
Man at the end of the day it's Chocolate Droppa[Hook: (Kid Talking)]
Hey big spender, hey big spender, hey big spender

[Bridge: Nick Cannon]
I don't see no shows, I don't see no rolls
I don't see no lolos, and a low profile
As far as the wardrobe goes, all those ain't your clothes
The product placement videos with no logos
You got a chain, no glow
Got a deal, no dough
Just the same, Joe small throwbacks and corn ropes

[Verse 1]
Not a good first weeks, worry gonna blow
But there's no need to front you broke we both know
Had the hoes rolling in drows
Now you over exposed
Pointing to your account and the amounts you owe
Your record was so close not def just so so
How you label don't know you on talking no show
The only time you in the streets is just signs for promos
Yo everybody know who wrote your stole flow
You gotta pay him too, your publician's a no go
I got speddy gonzales dollars and yours is slow mo

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You never seen a nigga quite like this before
He was stunting hard as hell before you even got to blow
Magazines claim he gassed like Texaco
They say [?] walk with him in Mexico
Back when the cars caused too much to floss
Them alligator [?] I stitched those
Body official, how, when my money stayed in the rear like Game or DJ Quik's clothes
And I wanted to go platinum one time
Nick, he still spending money from drunk line
Man when I finish this Usher tour up
I'ma try my best to clear my credit score up
Or is it cause my name on them backstage passes
Niggers always asking where his maybach's is
Mother fucker have you seen my taxes?

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3: Nick Cannon]
They thought you was gonna blow, but now you weren't
I got good news though, I just saved the car insurance
You probably learn and this music game all in crack
Need to go back to slinging crack
In fact you wasn't even good at doing that
Yo your street credibility, you ruined that
Trying to be [?] and pursuing rap
Far as wack contracts, you was doomed from that
Manger threw your door, now you sewing black
What I get for a track you never make in life
I'm like when coke just hit, I make a million a night
Yo what happened to your [?]?
Yeah I seen you on cribs, that's not what you live
Man  I know your babies mom
Why you dodging your kids?
Yeah I make big money, yeah I drive big cars
But I can do that dog, I'm a movie star

[Hook](x2)[Verse 1: Gennis]
Bad girls, pay attention
Even good girls with bad intentions
This especially goes out to my grown women
Who life routine cause the fun missing
Lemme answer y'all service, proven success aw yeah and it's worth it
You know it's right when you feel a lil nervous
Butterflies in the stomach mean that it's working
It may not be meant to be
But this red bull is the monster with the energy
The newer, the better
The younger, the fresher
The excitement gonna' have you writing love letters like
Dear baby I miss you, can't wait to see you and kiss you
You and I, the perfect match
Once you down with G ain't no turning back right ?

[Hook: Legacy]
I think your man need to fall back
When you pop that I'm all off track
Like I ain't neva' saw that
All that, tell me what they call that
Tell me what they call that
I just want to know what they call that
Girl tell me what they call that
I just want to know what they call that

[Verse 2: Tool]
Andale! Andale! Mami E, I, E, I, Oh Oh
You poppin' tonight, all you need is some me in your life
I'm young and fun and I could treat you right
It's your life, you deserve it
I'm far from retiring, your boy be working
I do it with a smile, my engine run good girl it got low miles
Tool, I'm still that dude
Day going bad, lemme switch that mood
Day going great cause of you know who
Don't short change yourself, you can have that boo
Live life, don't worry
Forget them haters girl, this your story
Now, just gone gone get it, and let your boy know if you with it
Cause I be like

[Hook]

Tell me what they call that
Call that
Tell me what they call that
I just want to know (fall back)
Tell me what they call that
Call that
Tell Tell me what they call that
I just want to know, know

[Hook]

(know know know)[Nick Cannon]
Can I live?
I'm talking, ma
I know this situation is personal
But it's something that has to be told
As I was making this beat
You was all I could think about
You heard my voice
Yeah, uh huh
Just think, just think
What if you could just
Just blink your self away
Just, just wait, just pause for a second
Let me plead my case

It's the late 70's, huh
You seventeen, huh
And having me, that will ruin everything huh
It's a lot of angels waiting on their wings
You see me in your sleep so you can't kill your dreams
Three hundred dollars, that's the price of living? What?
Mommy, I don't like this clinic
Hopefully you'll make the right decision
And don't go though with the knife decision
But it's hard to make the right move when you in high school
Now you gotta work all day and take night school
Hopping on the bus and the rain is pouring
What you want morning sickness or the sickness of mourning?
Can I live?

[Hook - Anthony Hamilton]
I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul, know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live?
Can I live?

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul, know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live?
Can I live?

[Nick Cannon]
I'm a child of the king, ain't no need to go fear me
And I see the flowing tears so I know that you hear me
When I move in your womb that's me being scared
Cuz who knows where my future holds
Yo, the truth be told you ain't told a soul
Yo, you ain't even showing, I'm just two months old
Through your clothes try to hide me, deny me
Went up three sizes, your pride got you lying
Saying ain't nothing but a migraine
It ain't surprising you not trying to be in Wic Food lines
Your friends look at you funny but look at you mommy
That's a life inside, take a look at your tummy
What is becoming, ma? I'm Oprah bound
You can tell he a star from the Ultrasound
Our spirits connected, doors open now
Nothing but love and respect
Thanks for holding it down, she let me live

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Nick Cannon]
It's uplifing for real, y'all
I ain't passing no judgement, ain't making no decisions
I'm just telling y'all my story
I love life
And I love my mother for giving me life
We all need to appreciate life
And a strong woman who had to make a sacrifice
Thanks for listening
Thanks for listening!
Momma, thanks for listening[Intro: Kevin Hart]

Yo, we so hot, other networks not

Real Husbands got the number one spot!
Man I'm so conceited, other shows can seed it

[Verse 3: Boris Kodjoe (Translated)]
Born in the year of Ox, 1973
Mother is German, the father from Ghana, Africa
Then off to America, a dream, hard to grasp, until I got here
No regrets, it's a blessing, hear a message
In my native language, all these fools don't know what I'm saying
Checking those subtitles or watching that old show (Oooh)s
Who's the tallest, the balers with the flawers
Working with finest, half the [?]
Half the wifest
The German chocolate The ab protecter
Teach all of you some culture  facts

They call us mitches with attitudes
Who's day? Who ya think? It's Kev, it makes him feel good

[Verse 4: Nick Cannon]
I guess Nelly said it's hot in herre cause Kev took his shirt off
Question for his chest though, how you get that bird off
Kevin Hart definition of a jerk-off

Never liked you anyway

Man I miss my dad yo....[Verse 1: J-brown]
Let's get it started, let me see your cup
Let me see your drink ya we ain't got to think
We taking all our worries and we flush em' down the sink
When I look around all I see is pink
When I'm in the club you call me DJ
Techno and dubstep that's what we play
In my club we don't even serve beer
Hardcore liquor impossible to steer
And we keep on going going goin' goin' on
Wake up in the morning we are so gone
Party every day. Party every night
Tired of the city so I'm taking a flight
To another planet to another place
It doesn't matter where we are so I'm kicking up the bass
Walking in with a girl on each arm
So many bitches like I breed em' on a farm

[Verse 2: J-brown]
And we keep going and we never ever ever stop
Pull up in the car flipping off the cops
It's all right we ain't  gonna freak
So fucked up I can't even speak
Get a little dull get a little bleak
No way bro it's a never ending peak
Party so hard you might pass out
It's all good I got a pull out couch
Chillin' in my room light a fat joint
Even when I'm old no longer on point
Don't know where I am got Alzheimers
Don't know my own name still a sick rhymer
But I'm seventeen
Still a prime timer. Starting Lineup I think so
Player number one in the first row
Heard about me know I'm putting on a show


[Verse 3: J- brown]
Been through alot and I'm only seventeen
Far from the average like I know what that means
Means I got years and years left to party
Think about the future ya too hardy
When we get bored, fed up with the club
Bring a girl home give a little love
When it's all done send the bitch home
I can be a dick I hope my cover isn't blown

[Interlude J-Brown]
Oh shit
Oh shit
Alright, My Boy OD is comin' in on this track
Yo OD you ready?

[Verse 4: OD]
Yo I'm ready

Hold on [x3] I think I got somethin'. Hold on
Lemme grab my Iphone

[Verse 3: OD]
Got my heart pumping like the bass
Take straight shots don't like to chase
Hit the shit once got me in space
Hit the shit twice memory erased
I ain't Lil' B but a nigga so based
The shit that I'm drinkin' got me fallin on my face
I think my girl is hookin' up with a chick
And I'm not really sure who is on my dick
Shots, shots to the fucking dome
Drunk as fuck don't know how I'm getting home
OD on the track fucking up the beat
Play it real loud so the neighbors can't sleep[Intro - R. Kelly] + (Nick Cannon)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, uh, haha, Cannon Ball)

Always surrounded, by so many (HO!)

Drop in the Six, cause I love them (HO!)

[Verse 1 - Nick Cannon]
Shorty I, only got one night in town, tell me baby where you down

Head to her knees, please if you ever need a bastard remember me
Just rock to the melody, I got you in bed wit me

You wanna name me, like Amerie

Tryna get lil' mami, in that thang of reese
Only getting in for free, if you came wit me
Cause I'mma grown man, not B2K
If I need a Girlfriend, it won't be to-day
No, I'm NOT tryna be ya man, pimp bones in my body
Rock them body-hotty, rock them, like ladi-dadi
Me and Kels on Ducatti's, wanna see you drop it shawty
Oh weee! tryna leave the club, wit a groupie!

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Nick Cannon]
Ma I'm busy on tour, ma, you busy on the floor

But like my favorite records, keep spinning new thangs
Let my hair grow, cause I was looking for a change
Shorty call me the Scare Crow, I'm looking for some brain
In "The Wiz", there it go, here it is, where the show

And the way you wear ya jeans, is means to cuss
So DAMN! how you get them on, DAMN! big secrets on her
Throwback chick, hotter than Ms. Vic Damone
This the type of ... I'm on, not picking up the phone
Unless you unblock ya joint, then put on ya coat
Know when to hit, when Nick get in the booth
Come through in something new, wit an invisible roof
Oh the sentence on my necklace seem invisible too
When we do what we do, we can't be visible boo
The last thing I need is lawsuits, all I did is call you
Initiated first move, shorty that was all you
I'm NOT tryna be ya man, pimp bones in my body
Rock them body-hotty, rock them, like ladi-dadi
Me and Kels on Ducatti's, wanna see you drop it shawty, oh weee!

Mutter Deutsch und der Vater aus Ghana, das ist Afrika
Und ich geh nach Amerika
Ein Traum, kaum zu glauben bis ich da war
No regrets it's a blessing to share a messaging
In my native languaging
All of these fools don't know what I'm saying though
Checking the subtitles while watching their own show (Woah!)
Who's the tallest? The ballest?
The one with the flawless, the finest
The halfest, the whitest?
The german chocolatest, the ab checkers
The one who nevertheless can teach you all some culture facts
"Real" is "echter", "husband" is "Ehemann"
Hollywood really dummy? Hollywood is Hollywood
They call us mitches with attitude
Who's they? Who do you think?
It's Kev, it makes him feel good

[Break: Kevin Hart & Nick Cannon]
It just got real...the cypher continues
Let's go Nick

[Verse 3]
I hate you, I date you, I love you, I make you
I miss you, I thank you, for you I'm grateful
I need you, I am you, I stand you, I have to
I had you, I left you, but I had to, I failed you
I scared you, I dared you, compared you, I held you
I kept you, I dissed you, I helped you, I felt you
When I kiss you, I melt you, I see you, I saw you
I hear you, I call you, no answer I get you
Forget you, forgot you, I lost you, I got you
I trust you, I doubt you, I can't live without you
I feel you, I kill you, I heal you, I steal you
I stole you, I have you, I hold you, I know you
I knew you, I owed you, I groomed you, I mold you
I warn you, I scold you, how could I be so cold to you?
I owe you my life, my soul I live, that's why I believe
You are my rib

[Hook 2x]As we all know I do interviews every single day about all my various projects, whether promoting AGT, Wild’N Out, my album, my stand-up special, NCredible consumer products, and various philanthropic and charitable efforts. Usually during these interviews I am consistently questioned about my wife, my kids, and my health and I happily answer them all. But as of lately I have been hit with an onslaught of questions about someone I consider family, someone I watched grow up, and someone I genuinely feel is one of the most pleasant human beings I have had the pleasure of meeting, Amanda Bynes.

The questions have ranged from, “Have you spoken to Amanda" to “Are you working on her rap album". Sometimes I would answer in a playful humorous manner and sometimes I would brush it off as another Pop culture topic that a reporter was trying to retrieve a sound bite for. But after recent events of Amanda being admitted under psychiatric care and reported as 5150, I see this as no laughing matter. I tweeted a few weeks about how the entertainment industry just consumes people and spits them out like flavorless bubblegum. A few chews of enjoyment then they’re under a city bus bench. Don’t get me wrong this is not a pity for the popular statement. I am always the first to say that fame and entertainment is one of the best and easiest occupations to ever have, but one must know how to navigate through the matrix or you may find yourself in a very dark hole. When a person is told all of their life that they are awesome, the best, the greatest and they are catered to every moment of the day. Imagine being the breadwinner in your household before you can even drive. Imagine you parents, teachers, and employers NEVER telling you NO. Anything you ask for or want, the world gives you, at some point you are bound to self-destruct. I call this “access to excess". I’ve seen it happen to many of my friends and colleagues young and old. It goes back to that old saying; “Too much of anything is bad for anyone". Whether it’s fame, money, sex, drugs, attention. It’s all a dangerous addiction. When there is no balance in your life a person will always become victim to their reality or lack thereof. The question is, when this destruction occurs, who is there to help put back the pieces. What do you do when you have no solid support system? When you feel like your friends are talking behind your back. When you feel like your co-workers are jealous and out to competitively sabotage you. When you feel your family has turned your back on you. When you feel like you parents have a conditional appreciation for you and only really love your money. You find yourself alone in that dark hole. Then you have to rely on your own devices once again in this vulnerable state. You become paranoid, frantic, manic, irrational because you can bounce your thoughts or ideas off of anyone anymore. Your reality no longer allows you to reason with the world, so you try to break through to get back to what you think is common ground. You are either trying to get back “hot" again or just searching for that adulation that you once received daily from the masses. Then enters the media, or what I like to call the ultimate magnifier. It’s like if you have a delicate piece of tissue under the sun, that tissue is under INTENSE heat with nowhere to escape but once you place a magnifying glass over that tissue, it’s bound to instantly burn up in flames. This is what I believe happens to many people in the public eye and we all sit back and judge these people for our own entertainment. We say things like, " I’m glad I’m not famous ", “Celebrities are Crazy", “See what fame and money does to people". And most of the time your assumptions and accusations maybe accurate but also inappropriate. No one on this planet needs to be judged or even has the right to judge. We are all equal and we all have our downfalls, fame or no fame. Money or no money. Life is hard for everyone in some since. And we need each other to in times of despair. No one can make it through anything alone. So I ask people who are quick to judge, tweet, report, or comment to ask yourself; what if that person was my sister? My brother? My Mother? Or me? What then would I say? In the words of the great poet and artist Bill Withers, "Sometimes in our lives We all have pain, we all have sorrow". We all end up alone in that dark hole at some point in our lives and if you don’t have a foundation of friends and family to help bring you up and out it makes that journey long and detrimental. So I say to my sister Amanda Bynes you’re not alone. I’m here for you. I understand. I care and I appreciate you, because that’s what family does and that’s what family is for. I also extend this to anyone else in my life, past or present that may find themselves in hard times. I’m here! Call me! Because I truly believe, the hand you’re helping up today may be the one you’re reaching for tomorrow. So not to be all cheesy and over sentimental but I got to end this with the ingenious Wither’s lyrics "Lean on me when you’re not strong and I’ll be your friend, I’ll help you carry on. For it won’t be long until I’ll need somebody to lean on.”[Pre-Hook – Future]
I’m fresh to death, I need an ambulance
I like a bad Puerto Rican on a handstand
Never top out when she be wearing off in the club
I’m talking bout what that bitch be wearing off in my room

[Hook]
In my room, get it popping in them pajama pants
Get it popping in them pajama pants
In my room, get it popping in them pajama pants
Get it popping in them pajama pants

[Verse 1 – Nick Cannon]
Tell the white girls to pop it, tell the black girls to drop it
Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, do it again, don’t stop it
Don’t want to see you in no skirt
Don’t want to see you in no bra
Got some hoes and some hoes and some hoes in this house
She came in the club with her friends, so now I’m fucking her friends
You know how we go with them hating ass hoes (Yo it’s Nick Cannon and Migos!)
But don’t believe the rumors, fuck college girls and cougars
They creeping in my room tryna cut like Freddy Krueger

[Bridge][x2]
Them strippers I salute you, church girls, hallelujah
Even got your grandmamma twerk-twerking out her bloomers

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 2 – Takeoff]
She pop lock and drop it, and shawty Korean
She twerk it, she roll it, her body like Shakira
Migos, Nick Cannon, we wyling out
Lil mama she bad, she standing out
Trap out the bando, I’m hiding out
She twerking it, making that money for certain
She hit the bedroom and she squirting
[?], lord have mercy
Then I pull up in the Fisker, but never tell her that I miss her

[Verse 3 – Quavo]
She can pop it in pajamas, take her to the Bahamas
She can smoke up all my reefer, she be introduced to my mama
Like a pizza, delivery to the neighbors
And you can kiss me with Nick Cannon, wyling out on vacation
We on our way to the top, Migos party at the top floor
And you can’t attend this party ‘less you got on pajamas

[Verse 3 – Traphik]
I say, who got the nicest cakes up in they PJs
Could it be them east coast latino mamis twerking in BK
Or, could it be that LA face, with a but from the bay
Either way, put that cake in my face like it’s my b-day
She know just what she doing when she doing what she does
I take a couple shots up off her booty till I’m buzzed
Cause, I feel that Henny pumping through my blood
Don’t like my bitches skinny, I just like a little budge
So if you got that apple, maybe peach, maybe a plum
My banana’s in pajamas so watch out cause here I come
A movie from Nick Cannon cause I beat it like a drum
Got my hands up on her cakes and then I squeeze em till their crumbs
Wake up in the morning, make a sandwhich and I’m swazy
You cannot have my babys, I’m so sorry, please don’t hate me
She said if I wore my PJs then I thought that you would date me
I said no you had it backwards baby, I was only JP

So I, cut the chase, took her out the place
Put her in a bed, put smile on her face (uh)

And like yo yo well here's, the whole story

Yo yo yo

[Verse 1]
She was a tall slim model chick
I met last week at the mall
Cute feet with the baby fat
Yo chick paged me to come over tommorrow
So I smashed in the crib bumping (ohhh)
Cam'Ron "Oh Boy" wit the doo rag on (oh boy) yo boy
She sings that song, shes turing me on
I'm I was to lone her but pops was home
Coulda stayed at the crib holla at her on the phone
Pops got hot, he was old school pimpin
Tank tops, flip flops and dress socks
Ran game when he came with the questions
Boy you a younging how you going for the lexus
Sorry mr jackson but I sell records
Naw once again I ain't got a jail record
It's Nick Cannon, that cat you ain't used too
The rapper/actor, comedian/producer

[Hook]
I really don't like this dude
I can't stand him, where did he come from, tell me
I really don't like this dude
I want so much more for my daugher
Your pops don't like me, your pops don't like me

[Verse 2]
The girls in the ghetto flashing the size of their stilletos
6, 7, 8, wanta make us wait
If they wanta date, gotta ask pops
You a grown woman, all that need to stop
At the club you love thug, but at home you not
Your daddy's little girl daddy loves a lot
I bet he don't know bout that tat you got
Naw I ain't playing, just whylin
Shorty we should probably hook up, in Cali, teach
You how to move in older birds and collies
Cut to the next day in a half
Called the crib, and your dad hung up on my asss...

[Imitating 50 Cent]
Is it cause of the block ma, he don't like me
Or is it the watch ma, he don't like me
Cause I'm pushing a drop ma, he don't like me
He don't like me, like me, your pops don't like me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Is it cause I make more money then him
TV shows and those films ain't funny to him
Or is cause I keep the block hot
With money and dem, rims inching ony my Benz
Ya that's 20 on them now I'mma fallback, and get the win
Last time I called back he picked up again
Don't know you saw that my devilish grin
Let you know the young black elvis is in
I ain't stuntin your pops, why he frontin your pops
Gonna have me straight huntin your pops
Naw doesn't wanta Roy Jones your pops
Left right uppercut, knockout your pops
Close the door, lock out your pops
We on a roll now suga,i ain't bout too stop
I don't care if he tried kicking me out your house
Do you understand the words that are coming out my mouth?

[Hook]

[Imitating 50 Cent]
Is it cause I'm handsome, keep the ladies dancing he don't like me
He don't like me
Cause my house is a mansion, he don't like me
Like me, your pops don't like me
Is it cause the cornrolls, or is it my hormones
The G's in the bank roll
Like me, your pops don't like me

[Repeat to fade][Verse 1: Pitbull]
I love her, you know her like I know her
So powerful, so beautiful, it's crazy to think
The things that she'll do to you
She'll change your life
She'll give you the freedom to be what you want
She's doing nice, she's the only one

[Nick Cannon]
I climbed on the bar to see her
Everybody in the world wants to meet her
I drive thousands of miles just to take a picture
So beautiful and magical I dripped and bust since I was a little boy

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Cannon]
So I need to find her, she is a special girl
Nothing is like her, I search for her around the world
I wanna make her mine, think of her all the time
She'll never leave me, she'll never leave me

[Chorus: Nick Cannon]
Her name is America, she is my lady
I swear to protect her, oh so amazing
Her name is America, she is my baby
I promised to love her, more than God above us
She is America, and I want her
She is America, and I love her

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Oho, America, America, ooh, that girl
Oho, America, America, ooh that girl

[Verse 2: Nick Cannon]
Fight to people
Battling, they want her, they try to steal her
Pick my armor up and put my spears down
She's my number one, the only one I wanna stay by her side

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Cannon]
So I need to find her, she is a special girl
Nothing is like her, I search for her around the world
I wanna make her mine, think of her all the time
She'll never leave me, she'll never leave me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
America baby, hold on baby
Wassup baby, go ahead baby
Maybe we can jump off in the car
Drop the top and look at the 50 stars
Dressed with skin tight, red, white, blue
Her heels like ooh, and I was like ooh
Baby go and lie, maybe later on we can hit my spot, right
She know Trina and her girlfriend Gina
Going back and forth like they was Serena
On Monday I'm seeing Erica, but God bless America

[Nick Cannon]
Twerk it, twerk it, twerk it, to the dawn's early light, light
Mami in the club, full of stars, we got stripes
Walk it out in the sound, tryna get them civil rights
It's Mister Worldwide and your man Nick Cannon
We salute her all night

[Chorus][Verse 1]
It's like me and you
Me and my mans and your girlfriends too
After tonight I'm a only visit be with you
When the moon is blue
Is that your mans right there what he doin with you
Saying talk to the hands
Is that still cute?
Jimmy choo boots
That's real cute
Only chick in the place with style and grace
And like 5'8" with a tropical face
And like expensive taste
Spotted my chain
That's right
Get on my game gotta see well hear that
Is that a weave can't believe that I said that
I don't know what possessed you to wear that
Girl, you out of tap
Girl wear that
Wait to be not, make it hot
Ma you feel that
Smashing all across the states
And I stays iced out like frosted flakes

[Bridge]
Anything you really wanna do
I'm with that
Only wanna kick it with you
I'm With that
Meet me in the parking lot at two
I'm with that
But you you gotta quit that attitude and get back to me

[Chorus]
I don't know you
My names not important i'm as big as elvis
You think you so cute
Keep it real ma you don't know me like that dance
But I don't want to
Believe me I don't give up that easy girl
Cuz I kind of like your attitude

[Verse 2]
I done been to every club in the world
I seen them hot chicks and they blocking and ugly home girls
EWWWW And ninety nine percent of the time
It be hits like this brainwashing your mind
Yo, you lookin at my watch
Just watch the time
You think I'm gonna stop you must be out of your mind
If you ain't V.I.P
Then get out of the line
Think I woke up one day and just decided to rhyme
NAH I ain't got no problems with ya'll
We all ken I'm tryin to find a barbie doll
So I could get a phone number
Call her tommorow
See how her night went with a superstar
Yeah That's what I was shooting for
Im one hundred percent over the fence
You like a mad mechanic
Throw in a wrench
And my game mad cuz you playin the bench

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's your attitude that got me whipped in my whip
Like whips you be wealth
I can't be mad at you
Looking good
You remind me of my benz when im pushing through the hood
24 inch rims steering wheel all good
Envision the bigger picture for real its all good
Wouldn't ya'll do it
If ya'll could
If ya'll could
Wouldn't yall do it
But ya'll ain't for stardom
On the road from autumn to autumn
From Cali to atlanta
To atlanta to harlem
You don't need Burt Reynolds for the Cannonball run

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
X2
Jam on it
Jam on it
I said yea JAm Jigga Jigga Jam On it
Get Out of your seats and dance
To ghetto beats girl don't be shy just flaunt it
