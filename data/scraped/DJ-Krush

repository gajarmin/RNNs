[Verse 1 - Guru]
Rotten scum has found its way to power
Time to protect projects, check the hour
I'm fed worse than just angry
Ready for action, baby
Not gettin' lazy, not goin' crazy
Cause I'mma make something happen
Not when just a member when I'm rappin'
For real, and it's amazing to me
How suckas be hopelessly fakin' to be
Somebody on-point and influential
Yet they got no talent and never had no potential
Cause they lack the bear essential
Strength of the mental, the soulful vocals
Crushing all you ugly oculs
People try to rate me like I'm the pulse
But then they find that I'm the most
Too complex when I'm vexed
And right about now I'mma wreck your game
Yeah, this is the season for a change

[Hook - Guru](2X)
This is the season, this is the season
This is the season, for a change

[Verse 2 - Guru]
And if this is offensive than take it personal
You start to squint from my lines and so I'm hurtin' you
But I ain't on no mission to be wishin' you no bad luck
I put you down, so you know what's up
You need to change your perspective
Peep the rhyme, that's corrective, selective
To speak facts that's my objective
I mess with a little bit of this flow and that if
And then the little bit start to sound fat, and
S-M-double-O-T-H
Believe me, the feeling yo it's worth to wait
But I still can't stand those, who try to front
Because they soft as butter rolls
A kid gets a gun, he feels he needs one
Either he shoots one or else he gets done
And what's the purpose of this tragic outcome
It's always easier to shift the blame
But ehm this is the season for a change

[Hook](3X)

[Verse 3 - Guru]
You cosmetic freak your style is weak and cornballed
And even worse when you speak
I put a lid on it and sit on it a bit
Don't even do it to yourself
Just be glad you got your health
Cut the bull, stop the nonsense
You're tryin' to get props under false pretense
But I came just to wreck ya game
This is the season for a change

[Hook](4X)Niggas don't you know?  Never promised tomorrow man
Check it, check it *the next life*
Life life (yeah) right now for what it is before you lose that shit
For real man, shit can happen
In the blink of a fuckin eye you can lose your life man
Recognize that for real
You're never promise tomorrow, you know
Any nigga that you know, knahmsayin?
You never know about these things, word up

His body was cold yet his face remained calmly
He spoke differently, as if he was Godly
Layin on the ground the gat still in his clutches
Shoulda saw it comin but he smoked too many Dutches
Situation, made me sober as fuck
As he coughed up blood, tellin me he's stuck
Gunmen, drove off in a Yukon truck
Said a prayer for him, hopin that his soul was blessed
Cause my hands couldn't cover all the holes in his chest
His eyes told the story that his heart was diminished
The ambulance took about a hour, ten minutes
They didn't have to tell me that my Son life was finished
I guess his heart never knew the love that was in it
Yeah, word up, goin back

Chorus: Tragedy

If your heart stop beating I'll go back in time
Make your heart beat again, real niggas to the end
It's all about cash, and the diamond rings
Dedicated, cause real niggas do real things
(repeat 2X)

Word up, real things, real niggas do real things
Yo, movin on

Through his eyes I seen the next life flash in front of his
Cocked back the gat wonderin who the gunner is
The blood drenched in his Armani linen
I guess that's the karma of a thug when he sinnin
From the beginnin, I reminisce the younger years
When we were younger peers on the block pourin out beers
And now the tears, I can't stop from comin
I wanna bring it to this nigga blaze him while he runnin
It seemed stunnin, the way we started in the game
I never wanted, my Son dyin in this pain
Now the nigga that shot him I wanna find him and kill him
Heard he's a Willie and keep a bunch of killers with him
The Jake snatched him up so I just had to forget him
But on the low, if I ever see him, I'ma hit him
Yo when he bust a slug in the heart of a true thug
It's real love, this is what a real nigga does

Chorus

What yo, real niggas do real things
Word up, real niggas do.. real niggas, yeah
Yo, 41st side, Queensbridge yo, yo

The words cut like a knife, ma your son was shot
Her mouth, wide open, seemed like her heart dropped
She fell to the floor with her eyes in shock
I was standin there stuck off the words I said
Worst thing to tell a mother that her son was dead
Shoulda knew what love is, 'fore he learned what a thug is
Now he left his kids to be raised by they mothers
From the cradle to the grave we was like brothers
Went to same schools and fucked the same bitches
Pumped on the same block with the same snitches
Burnin lye on the roof, talkin bout riches
And I remember, when we was both five percenters
Goin hand to hand, gettin bent, crashin renters
And now the end is, justifyin all the means
That's just the story when you're dyin out in Queens
And it's real, word up, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo

Chorus (repeats)

Yeah, Capone-N-Noreaga still my niggas
Even if you don't get no bigger
Finsta, Crash, presedential
Confidential, fuck it, yo, yo, what?
Japan rules, foreign exchange, how we do, yo
Begins, world currency
The way the dollar bends, and it haunts me
It wants me it traps me, in the hole
Reachin for my soul, fuck it, yo

Chorus(CL Smooth verse)
(yeah, DJ Krush in the house, the car-mel kingpin
CL Smooth and only the strong survive)

Actual facts
The ghetto reacts to warfare
Real bullets miss you by your hair
Survival of the fittest
Hell for the three time losers
The prisoners of enemy manuvers
Hold down the fort
Coz life is short enough to get it taken
Forsaken when your mental planes' breakin
Concealin' a 4 pound with every area
We surround coz clown
I get down for my crown
Take it to the streets for the
Honour and respect
Connect the lethal
Plus my young guns are unbeatable
Aiding and abetting the foul
Is a violation
That's why my retalliation
Is premeditation
The invitation
Is to run with a crew you can't do
And too great to infiltrate from a
Nickel plate
I state
This be the illest ever known on a rush
Swervin' with the krush

	(CL Smooth 2nd verse)
Slip into the world of shiesty individuals
A troubled man stalked by criminals
Creeping through the city
I step on the block to chat with
Thugs from all the drugs for fatcat
Stepping off the set now hand on my tool
Thinking how bad I want to flip on that fool
Times are wasting
Chasing these punks for petty loot
When there is a real mission to execute
I put the plan in effect
Forget what you heard
When you get the word from 1st and 3rd
For real I got the fam and all my soldiers to feed
With the gunslingers on the block puffin' weed
Envision the prison that I walk through
Leaving any witness
When I'm about to handle my business
No escape from the duct tape and artillery
Now tell me big man
Where's the money ain't a damn thing funny

	(CL Smooth 3rd verse)
Cops play for medals
Killers play for corners
In the middle are your sons and are
Your daughters
Who gives the orders
To chaos and mayhem
Who has the proper guidance and mind to save them
From this cold world of heartless ghetto dwellers
Pimps, prostitutes, and dope sellers
Strive to be the lead and not follow
Ladies
You can be the queens of tommorrow
Dig it, I want all that and more
For my peeps in the stuggle
Food, clothing, and shelter
Is essential
To maintain the hardcore from the soft
That pushed me to the edge but I can't fall off
My battlegrounds keep the sound of babies crying
Gunshots, and cursing
Can you feel my reel
Here's the deal
By any means necessary
Go all out
And keep this alive
Coz only the strong survive* currently only available in Japan or as an import

(Verse 1)
Yo, yo, you wasn't payin' attention, I'm henchman, hit the entrance
Trenchin', wasn't no means, a intervention
A dollar bill will make a hundred-ten Yen son
How much you willing to sacrifice to win, huh?
I personally have paid mine and then some
Climbed up an inch at a time, now who the Zen one
If not self, whom else could you depend on
Friends gon' swear it's aight, and probably been wrong
I've got them battlefield dents in my armor
A twitch from the drama, the trees, and bad Karma
But yo, I'm a precision, proceed ya preformer
We operate every night, and leave in the morning
To get you high as a kite is the reason you wanted
It's like, a direct flight from freezing to burning hot shit
The audience fiend for this fix
And Krush come with the guillotine for this mix yo...

[Various soft-spoken words from Black Thought]

(Verse 2)
Yo, who got they fingers on the carousel, locked in position
It's got to be my guy, the turntable tactician
You all in a hush, silent, trying to listen
You wanna feel this realness, that reads "spittin"
It got ya head, splits ya eyes, can't stop twitchin'
The only thing that you can do is rock to the rhythm
Thought puttin' down, cuz he's the world-reknowned
See me lickin' rhymes, trappin' like I'm firing rounds
And um, you in tune to this infinite sound
And um, the revolution poppin' off right now
I make you raise ya fist, raise and I'm proud
Raise ya fifth, and bust it at the flag like BLOW
You fuck-boy niggas tryin' to keep it on a hush
But Black Thought spit it cuz you people want the rush
You feel? That's why the audience fiend for this fix
And Krush come with the guillotine for this mix yo...

[Various soft-spoken words from Black Thought]

(Verse 3)
Yo, I got that renaissance, turn-of-the-century choke
And I'ma do the people right if y'all just give me the vote
We feel to ride, hit 'em high, Krush just give me the rope
See all the porcelain chase cats gettin' the broke
One at a time, now best focus on who the dime
When your blade's sharp as mine and people want you to rhyme
And want you to spill, for me it's not nothin' for real
Me and my man run at your band yo we tough on the will
He'll blow ya mind like bustin' the steel
I give the crowd somethin to feel
This sound got the power to heal
It's like The Green Mile, now I need an hour to chill
A quarter a kill, the bird while patrolling the field
I'm puttin' rappers out cold
I done rocked from Tokyo to the North Pole
Whenever my man program the passcode y'all receive the fist
Aiyo Krush come with the guillotine for this mix yo...

[Various soft-spoken words from Black Thought]I'm gonna take you there
Adjust your gear and brace yourself
Cause my force is severe when the bassline kicks
My brain starts to twitch
Lyrics are woven like thread as I stitch together
A commentary more than clever
Rough and durable fit for any weather
See it's not me to sound mediocre
Picture the Guru comin' off like a joker
No instead i'll smoke ya
Light me like fireworks city dweller
The streets is where I lurk and I don't sweat the limelight
My folks know I'm hype and sucka rappers need to rhyme right
So you can call me the equalizer with my elite speech
You'll all know I'm wiser
Some emcees are fads and that's a drag
But I'm genuine and DJ Krush is a b-boy mastamind

B-boy mastamind, one of the greatest of all time
Truly the game never lame or mundane
It's a shame the way some do rap
With the mad corny tracks and the lines that are wack
But beware cause I'm here to testify
Lit up against me even the best'll fry
You know not fish or chicken til they get nice and crisp
And learn respect or then i'll have to dismiss 'em
Which one'll be next to meet the slayer
Yes the payer of dues the super cool rhymesayer
You gets no wins
You get dropped like bowling pins
I wonder but look how deep you're in
Now there's no turnin' back
You better come attack
Quit the phony crap or I'ma flip like billy jack
I use my mic like a bat or a stick
And bash every single emcee that's counterfeit
You can fool some people some of the time
But who you trying to kid with those played out rhymes
This ain't no joke, it's an art
And punk rappers fake hard when they got no heart
But a true b-boy knows the real stuff
I don't have to fantasize and tell lies to feel tough
I got more rhymes than new york's got crimes
Why, cause I'm a b-boy mastamind

My styles universal
In a battle, i'd hurt you
You ain't got enough skills to even enter my circle
You can try to compete but if the flow is weak
You'll end up on the floor flat out on the concrete
I never ever thought about losin'
Cause chumps I'm abusin', and microphones I'm bruisin'
I get charged, I done leavin' rappers scarred
Suckas should be barred, yo I'm pullin their cards
I'm sick and tired of these copycat rap acts
Bitin' concepts and frontin with knapsacks that's wack
Because they know they aren't fly
After this year, kiss their careers goodbye
And I will remain being real
Cause when I rock, I got more strength than Seal
Feel the pressure that I release
It's kind of like the gunpowder in my piece
Ya beggin me and Krush to spare ya
Cause we take mad respect when we're in your area
And you know we won't be lettin' up
And after we hit ya, yo you won't be gettin up
I'm wettin up, each and every sucka crew
Chumps make one record then start to act new
I'ma burn ya with a slower or faster rhyme
You can't test a b-boy mastamind[Black Thought]
Yin for yang I walk on a line
Between ghetto slang and stimulation of the mind
Life is a labyrinth for dollars and cents
As I quest for cream, through the steam so dense
From the sensei me a puff, cause the tunnel is tough
Some lick shots with sound, some'll bust from the cannon
Experts o-rig-i-nal man'll examine
I am in fact lacking con-fus-ion, as to what's real
And what's illus-ion
I come from Illadelph where ya health you never take for granted
As hot as the equator in a cypher round the planet
Or abnormal, niggas appearing out of portals and demanding your soul
Who controls the eight immortals but the number seven
In this continual maze, where night fight with days
Within my mind marijuan blaze
And some say I should change my ways
But it's hard to hear the phrase through the havoc and haze
Thought's style will never since or never cease to excella-rate
It's the great lab dwella
Tha mentals of The Roots are beyond any computer
The judge prosecutor, or the drug distributor
Respect to the ex-Lex Luger, my nigga Malik B the intruder
Phila 5th Dynasty's the future
And DJ Krush is the producer, ya healin with the ginseng Roots
We get ya renascence loosa
Remember me the Thought I represent essentially and
Mentally eventually, ya mention me as most high
My decibels are most fly, I come to paint ya Thought's Black
Yo Krush, where's it at?!!!??!

[Malik B]
The Roots bring it from the Phila Fifth, spill the gift
The melody of a felony is straight off a cliff
Now can I get a witness to dismiss Christmas from the myth list
Man that's bogus, let's try to stay focused
You would think it was the Fourth of July
Cause in Illadelph a round of applause light up the sky
Why? Don't ask me, subtle attitudes sometimes nasty
Foul mouth bitches walk around looking trashy
Bimbos talking about where's the indo?
Crackheads leavin babies unattended at the window
To see death, and brothers with strikes who got three left
I'm trying to make it, cause if I don't I'll probably take it
But perserverence is a virtue
The person that you thinking you hurting might hurt you
Ya celly might jerk too
Perhaps I'll go to court this time when I'm summoned
But I'm a rebel to the system so I might not be coming
So if I fail, man just get up the bail
It's just more time to write another story to tell
Ill elements, drop intelligence, Black Thought Malik B
Fuck up their-re-le-vance
We got strain on the brain from bodies left in the dust
Man just leave it to us, look main aim and I'll bust
Fuck betrayal just trust, all the tracks we lust
With DJ Krush from Japan with no more need to discuss[Intro]

[Hook: El-P]
You've got a very soft vision of art
You've got a deficit disorder of heart
Thes are the wings of an endangered drum pattern
This is the flight of the hapless, you've got it all backwards

[Verse 1: El-P]
When Krush drops a fuckin' city buster, I call it the crowd rapist
Ace of base shitty, compounded to drown faces
Out of the ground basics, found in lost spaces
Ashamed of its own bass-line traces (that's pure hatred)
Perhaps the internet feeds your village fright (right)
I got the double ox wingspan dragon archetype tonight
The part that reflects light, the razor blade kite
Fuck it the rugged word, my immortal beloved
Got you suckin' off Muppet's for Bisquick and contracts and shit
Printed on the back of Triscuits and served rectally
(mumbling)
What a difference indifference can make
My bad chemistry chalks lines like little deranged johnny the terrain bum
Borderline fuck ya sound-bombing
I'm heated like broke days with nothing but noodle ramen and water
Water tainted, complaint filed time to transfer
Take me out, transfer denied, answer supplied as:
Stab 'em through the nipples with they own bitchy as rim-shots
I'm audio two basic combust with strange lust
With modus operandum and balk the funcrush
You box with soft touch, touched with soft tentacle
Tickle me sickly, sedate my brain quickly
So much slower the whole scenery seems
Moving through plasticine brackets backwards
After-burn full thrust monks react trackless
Come to confront funk slugs with salt tactics
Turn the Farrah Fawcett on and burn 'em in they mattress
Then ashes float to heaven quicker than souls of children
Murdered by a strange man in the basement of their building
Time to build time to be brazen with cane raisin'
The same faded disdain with a grain of insane patience
Patent that, fire in the sky, cataract eyes
This is nervous unnerving word-ship
Reported fortnights of journey through warning you
Secret pathfinder that cast of bad sitcom
The laugh track added to the last cat shit on
The audience claps like Dillenger gun masonic
Rounds falling down, trample the trespass sound
Ample distress, amp will get loud as Tourettes
From banshee with a megaphone, me-me-me-me-mega????
Hold the frequency, hold it unevenly, unsheathe the Jihad blade
And become animalistic
Authority walks the plank, that's implicit
The shambles of the gifted, dismantled and imprisoned
This is just a cf thought car derailed and resold as old feelings
To those with false motion
All potion, pour to parched hearts open
Casted out, sold out in the open
DJ fuckin' Len will leave the boom box dead
DJ Fuckin' KRUSH will make your children throw furniture
Learning disabilities spring from the scene
Like a recessive biter gene, ignited like a flare for all teams
Tall beams broken, bring down the foundation
Found in a pool of cess where the worms unnerve stations
FM is just a feminine breaks on rotation
Company Flow hold the mic naked, famous
Aside from murder touch, fuck with the once known divine style
Dummy droid noise for bad cats and basset
I enter like Aslan, demented and god-like
Odd mic clutched and chucked at glass structure
Sided to the funk with a working class rupture
Eat at that party of martyrs and pump action
Something to funk thumps with blood and duck fashion
Techno-spawn the last long-cock rhymer
Get with it, space-ghost the force soul weapon
Get with it, get got or got missing

[Verse 1]
Searching for adventure, welcome to dementia
Lif sent ya', every message that he meant ta'
Envision this, your perimeters are limitless
30,000 feet in the air, we're all there
Standard procedure, land them at Narita
Find reefer, hit the telly for some leisure
Relaxing, looking over Osaka
Thinking of a line for a rhyme that'll rock ya'
On stage shock ya', jetting cause I've gotta
Hit Tokyo with another dark and lonely flow
Language barrier like a carrier aircraft
When I move my physical frame, you'll hear math
Numbers crunch your bone well, struggle through your own hell
Pray you weren't alone when your dome fell, oh well
Go and grab another mop for the body shop
And while you rot, the dead'll get the fuck up and walk

[Hook]
Strange things happen in the nighttime
When you leave your crib to come and hear a hype rhyme
At the show, so I've got you, black Nosferatu
Rock that ass to sleep with a beat then I'll chop you
Strange things happen in the nighttime
When you leave your crib to come and hear a hype rhyme
At the show, so I've got you, black Nosferatu
When you're under spell, I'll do what the hell I want to

[Verse 2]
Let me lighten up, total eclipse, the universe flips
Sunken ships sink towards the sea's surface
A thousand tales of those who failed but kept composure
Decomposure, bloated from exposure
The sun bust, you better duck son, the government sonned us
To work toward needs and gun lust
We could buy our souls back, but we sold that
It's a no-go black, hire Scully and Kojak
Detectives with corrective lens perceptive
Tight perspective, yet missed the objective
Fuck it, live and let live, they could never catch Lif
Hit me with a beat and a mic, let's get biz
Lights dimming, that means your chances of escape slimming
Hands up and heads bobbing to the rhythm
Blood shower, now ya' body lose power
Within an hour I'll teleport to Kanazawa
To start my feeding again I'm peeling your skin
Then you scream, thus release the feelings within
Here's a flyer, missing my event would be a sin
Nigga showtime's at 9, welcome, let it begin

[Hook 2x]Niggas don't you know?  Never promised tomorrow man
Check it, check it *the next life*

But I still can't stand those, who try to front
Because they soft as butter rolls
A kid gets a gun, he feels he needs one
Either he shoots one or else he gets done
And what's the purpose of this tragic outcome
It's always easier to shift the blame
But ehm this is the season for a change

[Hook](3X)

[Verse 3 - Guru]
You cosmetic freak your style is weak and cornballed
And even worse when you speak
I put a lid on it and sit on it a bit
Don't even do it to yourself
Just be glad you got your health
Cut the bull, stop the nonsense
You're tryin' to get props under false pretense
But I came just to wreck ya game
This is the season for a change

[Hook](4X)[Intro]

[Hook: El-P]
You've got a very soft vision of art
You've got a deficit disorder of heart
Thes are the wings of an endangered drum pattern
This is the flight of the hapless, you've got it all backwards

[Verse 1: El-P]
When Krush drops a fuckin' city buster, I call it the crowd rapist
Ace of base shitty, compounded to drown faces
Out of the ground basics, found in lost spaces
Ashamed of its own bass-line traces (that's pure hatred)
Perhaps the internet feeds your village fright (right)
I got the double ox wingspan dragon archetype tonight
The part that reflects light, the razor blade kite
Fuck it the rugged word, my immortal beloved
Got you suckin' off Muppet's for Bisquick and contracts and shit
Printed on the back of Triscuits and served rectally
(mumbling)
What a difference indifference can make
My bad chemistry chalks lines like little deranged johnny the terrain bum
Borderline fuck ya sound-bombing
I'm heated like broke days with nothing but noodle ramen and water
Water tainted, complaint filed time to transfer
Take me out, transfer denied, answer supplied as:
Stab 'em through the nipples with they own bitchy as rim-shots
I'm audio two basic combust with strange lust
With modus operandum and balk the funcrush
You box with soft touch, touched with soft tentacle
Tickle me sickly, sedate my brain quickly
So much slower the whole scenery seems
Moving through plasticine brackets backwards
After-burn full thrust monks react trackless
Come to confront funk slugs with salt tactics
Turn the Farrah Fawcett on and burn 'em in they mattress
Then ashes float to heaven quicker than souls of children
Murdered by a strange man in the basement of their building
Time to build time to be brazen with cane raisin'
The same faded disdain with a grain of insane patience
Patent that, fire in the sky, cataract eyes
This is nervous unnerving word-ship
Reported fortnights of journey through warning you
Secret pathfinder that cast of bad sitcom
The laugh track added to the last cat shit on
The audience claps like Dillenger gun masonic
Rounds falling down, trample the trespass sound
Ample distress, amp will get loud as Tourettes
From banshee with a megaphone, me-me-me-me-mega????
Hold the frequency, hold it unevenly, unsheathe the Jihad blade
And become animalistic
Authority walks the plank, that's implicit
The shambles of the gifted, dismantled and imprisoned
This is just a cf thought car derailed and resold as old feelings
To those with false motion
All potion, pour to parched hearts open
Casted out, sold out in the open
DJ fuckin' Len will leave the boom box dead
DJ Fuckin' KRUSH will make your children throw furniture
Learning disabilities spring from the scene
Like a recessive biter gene, ignited like a flare for all teams
Tall beams broken, bring down the foundation
Found in a pool of cess where the worms unnerve stations
FM is just a feminine breaks on rotation
Company Flow hold the mic naked, famous
Aside from murder touch, fuck with the once known divine style
Dummy droid noise for bad cats and basset
I enter like Aslan, demented and god-like
Odd mic clutched and chucked at glass structure
Sided to the funk with a working class rupture
Eat at that party of martyrs and pump action
Something to funk thumps with blood and duck fashion
Techno-spawn the last long-cock rhymer
Get with it, space-ghost the force soul weapon
Get with it, get got or got missing

[Hook: El-P]
You've got a very soft vision of art
You've got a deficit disorder of heart
These are the wings of an endangered drum pattern
This is the flight of the hapless, you've got it all backwards* currently only available in Japan or as an import

(Verse 1)
Yo, yo, you wasn't payin' attention, I'm henchman, hit the entrance
Trenchin', wasn't no means, a intervention
A dollar bill will make a hundred-ten Yen son
How much you willing to sacrifice to win, huh?
I personally have paid mine and then some
Climbed up an inch at a time, now who the Zen one
If not self, whom else could you depend on
Friends gon' swear it's aight, and probably been wrong
I've got them battlefield dents in my armor
A twitch from the drama, the trees, and bad Karma
But yo, I'm a precision, proceed ya preformer
We operate every night, and leave in the morning
To get you high as a kite is the reason you wanted
It's like, a direct flight from freezing to burning hot shit
The audience fiend for this fix
And Krush come with the guillotine for this mix yo...

[Various soft-spoken words from Black Thought]

(Verse 2)
Yo, who got they fingers on the carousel, locked in position
It's got to be my guy, the turntable tactician
You all in a hush, silent, trying to listen
You wanna feel this realness, that reads "spittin"
It got ya head, splits ya eyes, can't stop twitchin'
The only thing that you can do is rock to the rhythm
Thought puttin' down, cuz he's the world-reknowned
See me lickin' rhymes, trappin' like I'm firing rounds
And um, you in tune to this infinite sound
And um, the revolution poppin' off right now
I make you raise ya fist, raise and I'm proud
Raise ya fifth, and bust it at the flag like BLOW
You fuck-boy niggas tryin' to keep it on a hush
But Black Thought spit it cuz you people want the rush
You feel? That's why the audience fiend for this fix
And Krush come with the guillotine for this mix yo...

[Various soft-spoken words from Black Thought]

(Verse 3)
Yo, I got that renaissance, turn-of-the-century choke
And I'ma do the people right if y'all just give me the vote
We feel to ride, hit 'em high, Krush just give me the rope
See all the porcelain chase cats gettin' the broke
One at a time, now best focus on who the dime
When your blade's sharp as mine and people want you to rhyme
And want you to spill, for me it's not nothin' for real
Me and my man run at your band yo we tough on the will
He'll blow ya mind like bustin' the steel
I give the crowd somethin to feel
This sound got the power to heal
It's like The Green Mile, now I need an hour to chill
A quarter a kill, the bird while patrolling the field
I'm puttin' rappers out cold
I done rocked from Tokyo to the North Pole
Whenever my man program the passcode y'all receive the fist
Aiyo Krush come with the guillotine for this mix yo...

[Various soft-spoken words from Black Thought][Produced by DJ Krush]I'm gonna take you there
Adjust your gear and brace yourself
Cause my force is severe when the bassline kicks
My brain starts to twitch
Lyrics are woven like thread as I stitch together
A commentary more than clever
Rough and durable fit for any weather
See it's not me to sound mediocre
Picture the Guru comin' off like a joker
No instead i'll smoke ya
Light me like fireworks city dweller
The streets is where I lurk and I don't sweat the limelight
My folks know I'm hype and sucka rappers need to rhyme right
So you can call me the equalizer with my elite speech
You'll all know I'm wiser
Some emcees are fads and that's a drag
But I'm genuine and DJ Krush is a b-boy mastamind

B-boy mastamind, one of the greatest of all time
Truly the game never lame or mundane
It's a shame the way some do rap
With the mad corny tracks and the lines that are wack
But beware cause I'm here to testify
Lit up against me even the best'll fry
You know not fish or chicken til they get nice and crisp
And learn respect or then i'll have to dismiss 'em
Which one'll be next to meet the slayer
Yes the payer of dues the super cool rhymesayer
You gets no wins
You get dropped like bowling pins
I wonder but look how deep you're in
Now there's no turnin' back
You better come attack
Quit the phony crap or I'ma flip like billy jack
I use my mic like a bat or a stick
And bash every single emcee that's counterfeit
You can fool some people some of the time
But who you trying to kid with those played out rhymes
This ain't no joke, it's an art
And punk rappers fake hard when they got no heart
But a true b-boy knows the real stuff
I don't have to fantasize and tell lies to feel tough
I got more rhymes than new york's got crimes
Why, cause I'm a b-boy mastamind

My styles universal
In a battle, i'd hurt you
You ain't got enough skills to even enter my circle
You can try to compete but if the flow is weak
You'll end up on the floor flat out on the concrete
I never ever thought about losin'
Cause chumps I'm abusin', and microphones I'm bruisin'
I get charged, I done leavin' rappers scarred
Suckas should be barred, yo I'm pullin their cards
I'm sick and tired of these copycat rap acts
Bitin' concepts and frontin with knapsacks that's wack
Because they know they aren't fly
After this year, kiss their careers goodbye
And I will remain being real
Cause when I rock, I got more strength than Seal
Feel the pressure that I release
It's kind of like the gunpowder in my piece
Ya beggin me and Krush to spare ya
Cause we take mad respect when we're in your area
And you know we won't be lettin' up
And after we hit ya, yo you won't be gettin up
I'm wettin up, each and every sucka crew
Chumps make one record then start to act new
I'ma burn ya with a slower or faster rhyme
You can't test a b-boy mastamindCruisin' up and down
This avenue
Baby don't you know
My eye's on you
Hiding in your shadow
Gaze is kinda hollow
I just like your smile
Your hair is really wild

Big city lover
I take a chance on you
Big city lover
But I think I like your groove
Big city lover
Just keep that attitude

Didn't take too long
To get you home
Just to find your heart
Was made of stone
Drowning in my sorrow
Love don't like to furrow
Never thought you'd leave
My feelings on the floor

Big city lover
I don't want to hear your lies
Big city lover
Don't think I sympathize
Big city lover
You know I don't like to cry
Big city lover
You know - I changed my mind
Big city lover
I thought that you were kind
Big city lover
Now I just ain't got the time

Big city lover
I don't want to hear your lies
Big city lover
Don't think I sympathize oh-no-no

Cruisin' up and down
This avenue
Honey don't you know
My eye's on you

Big city lover
Hell just might take a chance on you
Big city lover
I think I kinda like your groove
Big city lover
Just lose that attitudeThis stress is so old, but the moon is still young
I adapt to the smog- developing steel lungs
Let's abandon this life for just this one night
I'm on a date with the angels until the sun rise
It's like my passion and actions are a magnet
With opposite reactions; in fact, they're attracted
And I'm so infatuated with her soul so attractive
The beauty of her fashion; now Cupid's my assassin
Imagination wanting more than a tease
I'll compete until my essence be absorbing her steeze
Take the keys from the jeans, as we thrust to the street
Gas touch floor, and the clutch will release

Now I'm stuck to the seat, me and gravity hug tight
I'm pushed back; like I wasn't holding the gun right
A flood of insight, when the mood is completed
The windows fully rolled down, the moon roof receded
Fitted and adidas be caressed by the speakers
That's in through one ear, with blue-tooth- like features
-And if the city is a forest then the buildings are the cedars
Exploring every corner before the coroner sees us
-Lone orator finally found a companion
Manifested in the barren metropolitan canyon
And the night light covers like a drape or a blanket
It ain't the same than what they got described in the pamphlet
Life's a sound track, when this car goes faster-
-Add a session with the city then the tracks are mastered
Los Angeles attached to my heart, like a laniard
-And when my car's in transit, these angels are the passengers

Maneuvering it faster, through the tunnels and land bridges
Entranced by the lights, metaphysical back flipping
The mastiff of rap ish, a passion for hand-lin'
Craft that enamors these chicks with attraction
It's infinity; the city completing the symphony
Proficiently; but with these lyrics are my affinity
Love slice the air with precision through vicinities
Elegant and delicate agility and symmetry
And music is the session; with speech, we jam well
With enough soul to make a Jazz piece look stale
-Let's ditch the safe side, tonight we take chance
Getting lost in the bliss till buildings can breakdance

So set the tone baby, cause I want feel your breath alone
According to my tempo, my heart beat's the metronome
Let me take the lead, and you could follow full heartedly
Reciting you my song, while you're singing me the harmony
It's Romeo and Juliet; so hold me close and truly yet
I'm lonely so I'm taking these emotions and I'm fooling it
I pray you fall from a tall place, and fast too
Cause that's the only way I could run fast and catch you
So attached to... the woman standing in my mirror image
-Imperfection's my only way of showing heroism
It's lyricism simply cause I ain't the best addressing ya
Poetry, cause I ain't the best confessing love
Longing for what's better, for my always and forever
And I be first to admit; I'm a novice giving pleasure
-And through the sickness of the Winter to the Summer's embrace
I spill my heart for you at night and we can watch the sky illuminate
It's hard to estimate on what time we will get there
Cause bliss makes time feel suspended in mid air
If wish it'd be fair to wish that could be time altered
I'll savor every moment till it turns to nostalgia
So meet me at the altar, cause I'm waiting where the service is
Despite the nervousness, you know my love for you is permanent
I can't wait 'till we're alone... just your beauty with the sun and I
I wrote for you a poem but the lyrics turned to butterflies
Your lullaby the best at inspiring the inner child in me
Preaching it so vibrantly; yet you're speaking so silently
It's sexy how you got me deciphering all the irony
If I could only carry our future inside this time machine
I'm in love with these angels; if your streets could talk
I'mma hug em till I'm just another piece of chalk
Your love's a firing squad, so baby fire at will
I pray that when I gaze into you, time would just stand stillIf love is a danger, should we avoid it?
If love is a danger, should we avoid it?

It was a rainy day today
Sky stayed grey
A lonely day, lonely day
It will be a lovely night
Sunshine in my heart
Even when we are apart

(The danger of love) Drive me crazy
(The danger of love) Drives me easy
(The danger of love) Makes the power of your day
(The danger of love) Makes the power of your way
The danger of love...

Your love bring the sun in me
I could smell your essence
With or without your presence
It was a lovely day
A lovely day
A lovely daaay
A lovely daaaaaay ehhh

Drive crazy (the danger of love)
Drive me insane (the danger of love)

Power of your way (the danger of love)

Lovely day

It was a rainy day
Sky stayed grey
They don't know nothing about love
Sunshine in me to stay
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dreeeeeeeam (the danger of love)

The danger of love

Tonight
Tonight see you in my dream
See you in my dream[Produced by DJ Krush & DJ Shadow]I traveled far to find you
Who knew you'd be so far away
I will stay now
Love

This weary heart
The only gift i bring you
This love I give to you
It won't stray

I could give you
The most delicious kisses on your face
You see I need you to be addicted to me
I am calm now in the corners of his mouth
I am still now, I will not live without
I am pure now, safe inside my final home

I could give you
The most delicious kisses on your face
You see i need you to be addicted to me
I am calm now in the corners of his mouth
I am still now, I will not live without
I am pure now, safe inside my final home

My home.. my home....
My home inside you
Safe inside my final home
My home inside you[Verse 1]
This is Minister Metal Foot, treat a pedal like an earwig
And cook off by applying the same logic to the gearshift
Bird of prey circle serf homes like I tweaked
When the beak hit the bones, leave 'em alone
Leaky break fluid but ghost the boy whip swift
Cruise for the unusually mutual shoes
In & out hotstepper lane eat fame
Spit the blinking lights back to the lions Keep the name
Freak the frame Like it lasts without compromising the mission
On guard to peak with the gain the second
The second frame twitches
Which is fine, I learned stay alert early
For the buzzards that burgle the worms know nothing of mercy
Wrote this one in Europe with Walz while his ravi sick at home, It`s killing him
If you can`t identify
Peep, see when you kill the shows, then the bills unfold
And if the bills unfold, the children ain`t gonna pick at bones
Only soldiers shoulders built to carry weight could troop us
Shake a room up scoop the venue phone
1-800 Brooklyn zoo is Kenya home
I mean, it`s love when the screams leave your face
But it`s realer when your seed`s fever breaks
Kid, I got your family, pull up a chair
I got a little something that I want y'all to hear
There is much greater peace out there still
And if I gotta carry it home in my teeth for y'all, I will

[Hook]
There is a greater love Greater than your papercuts
Greater than the labor Suckin souls out of the razor tongued
All eyes on it
Cut the edge and walk toward it
Water & hot porridge
There is a medicine I know and live
It dissolves and swims between the bones and skin
When the dry walls start closing in
I mosey out to hold the win, kill switch

[Verse 2]
Welcome to sham city limits Let your insects do the walking
Let your indent through the shredder Let your instinct make it awkward
If Gitty in the gauntlet, set the phasers on kill
Cuz the minions that haunt it ain't offered the same pills
My chemical happy squad operate with freedom fighters
Eye of the tiger pride prize fight Nighter off a Geiger
Napkin scribble to crack riddles
Fizzle back in after the ax tip rizzle grips actually swivels
And they won't stop asking all the wrong questions
All the right answers for shit you ain't find interesting
Hand pull the plug and fuck it
Make a hundred albums
Not a one for public consumption
Now that's that, good lovin`
Lugging fetus
Feedback isn`t what I got down for

Dancing on the ceiling with that lip On the ground floor
Of the building, You`d leak anything from document to poison
To stand on your brother`s face and holler buoyant
Float like a butterfly Sting Jackals
You could never shackle
Zooka maggots bring mavericks
Sing a song of sick spit blood in savage
Illin' children, cuttin` papers lilacs in the attic
And I casually shift up These crusaders
Hold a dual saber defense For the cruel natured weekend drifter
Please do not interrupt the placement
Of the steak upon my kinfolk's plate, wait...

[Hook](CL Smooth verse)
(yeah, DJ Krush in the house, the car-mel kingpin
CL Smooth and only the strong survive)

Actual facts
The ghetto reacts to warfare
Real bullets miss you by your hair
Survival of the fittest
Hell for the three time losers
The prisoners of enemy manuvers
Hold down the fort
Coz life is short enough to get it taken
Forsaken when your mental planes' breakin
Concealin' a 4 pound with every area
We surround coz clown
I get down for my crown
Take it to the streets for the
Honour and respect
Connect the lethal
Plus my young guns are unbeatable
Aiding and abetting the foul
Is a violation
That's why my retalliation
Is premeditation
The invitation
Is to run with a crew you can't do
And too great to infiltrate from a
Nickel plate
I state
This be the illest ever known on a rush
Swervin' with the krush

	(CL Smooth 2nd verse)
Slip into the world of shiesty individuals
A troubled man stalked by criminals
Creeping through the city
I step on the block to chat with
Thugs from all the drugs for fatcat
Stepping off the set now hand on my tool
Thinking how bad I want to flip on that fool
Times are wasting
Chasing these punks for petty loot
When there is a real mission to execute
I put the plan in effect
Forget what you heard
When you get the word from 1st and 3rd
For real I got the fam and all my soldiers to feed
With the gunslingers on the block puffin' weed
Envision the prison that I walk through
Leaving any witness
When I'm about to handle my business
No escape from the duct tape and artillery
Now tell me big man
Where's the money ain't a damn thing funny

	(CL Smooth 3rd verse)
Cops play for medals
Killers play for corners
In the middle are your sons and are
Your daughters
Who gives the orders
To chaos and mayhem
Who has the proper guidance and mind to save them
From this cold world of heartless ghetto dwellers
Pimps, prostitutes, and dope sellers
Strive to be the lead and not follow
Ladies
You can be the queens of tommorrow
Dig it, I want all that and more
For my peeps in the stuggle
Food, clothing, and shelter
Is essential
To maintain the hardcore from the soft
That pushed me to the edge but I can't fall off
My battlegrounds keep the sound of babies crying
Gunshots, and cursing
Can you feel my reel
Here's the deal
By any means necessary
Go all out
And keep this alive
Coz only the strong survive[Intro]
[?] rock the set, you know the vibe, baby
And DJ Krush he get down, word up, you know the vibe, baby
And [?] get down, you know the vibe, baby
But Mos Def keep the crown (Representin' Brooklyn!) you know the vibe, yo

[Verse 1]
From all borders, doorways and gates
Resurrection draw near as mankind awaits
When you're living in this world you got to survive
Shaitan is lookin' on alert, attackin' from all sides
Witness before all eyes, the evidence of unseen
The power past the comprehension that controls all things
The battle fought by good and evil is a real contest
It is the outcome of the struggle that we play context
To all sets, sections, corny cliques, crews and clans
Gilgreens to Badlands, jump up to understand
I'm just a man, not the universal architect
We tread the face of this heavenly place, and show respect
Tokyo, raise your hands, where you at?
Osaka, raise your hands, where you at?
[??? Japanese Line ???]
DJ Krush, Mos Def on the touch, we let it fly
I send my salaam to my entire squad
Meiso hard, yo, wherever you are, stay on your job
Strugglin' hard, to overcome the perils of life
We writing rhymes on enemy lines to shine light
Stay in meditation to keep the head right
Spreading wings like heavenly things, we take flight

[Hook]
Everything gon' be alright, everything gon' be alright
And you got to believe
Everything gon' be alright, everything gon' be alright
And you got to believe
Everything gon' be alright, everything gon' be alright
I said you got to believe, I said you got to believe, yo bust it, baby!

[Verse 2]
Me and Krush, we politickin', buildin' on this money mission
[?] somethin' so I had to stop and listen
And time forever tickin', my [?] forever [?]
I'm tryin to get mine, cause son, it's here for the gettin'
Allah's provision will help us in the providential
My pad and pencil will transcribe the elemental
The raw essential, the Southbound residential
The pure and simple to resonate in your mental
I flash a dimple, my [?] shine like precious metal
Left the rah-rah livin alone, about to settle
Fast act tryin to gas, slow down and save your petrol
Cause the beat don't stop, like yellow cabs in the metro
Free voice your verse to earth as the verse to next
This is a daily operation like birth to death
And I burst the breath, yep, as a so-called vet
I've orchestrated designs while they slept, quietest kept
Everything that you heard in advance is just a glance
Of the landscape, [?]
Sunsets and [?] of pure skill
At night, I do right to excite what truth reveal
Got to believe, that the Most High I see
Every degree, of this three-see-ix to -y
We maintain, son, and carry on officially
From troubled projects to the shores of Tripoli
I speak prolifically, I write [?]
Transmit upliftedly, it sounds terrific, G
Allah has gifted me with great ability
To speak to my beloved, and make em all love it
Refined, rugged, a product of the ghetto public
Allah is the King of the world, we just subjects
Allah is the King of the world, we just subjects
Allah is the King, Allah is the King

Nippon, said you got it goin' on (say what?)
Nippon, said you got it goin' on (say what?)
Nippon, said you got it goin' on, said you got it goin' on, said you got it goin' on, LOVE!I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no

When I feel heavy metal
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Well I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure when I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

When I feel heavy metal
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Well I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure when I need you
Pleased to meet you

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah[Intro: Pedestrian]
There's a little Johnny Walker Lindh in every Meadow Creek Middle School
And when the rap tape grows up
Each wave topples at first wind before the self settles in the body

[Hook: Dose & Why?]
The names of prominent families
Carry no weight in foreign cities
And even the sons of senators
Receive no welcome outside the States
The names of prominent families
Carry no weight in foreign cities
And even the sons of senators
Receive no welcome outside the States

[Verse 1: Dose]
We hold these truths to be self-evident
Once a-fucking-gain we got a dollar model president
Carving his face up for the cover of the next new nickel
Combing every cotton coil of his inner white wig
Curling perfect sers to his own thin lips in the mirror
Working on his Contrapposto for stone
Oh yeah whitey, you got empire guilt

[Bridge: Why? & Dose]
We know John Walker, we know John Booth
Waste our days swatting this single song
At a long line of Yale and bones born old men
We know John Walker, we know John Booth
Waste our days swatting this single song
At a long line of Yale and bones born old men

[Verse 2: Alias]
While the widows buy rubber grips to open bottles with
It's dreams with dusty dashboards and chipping paint
At least the animals have something to poison themselves with
Director yelling "Cut!" on riot footage in the background is faint
And at dusk the clanking of fork to plates syncs
Man of the house drowning out the chatter of housewife
To yet another unmanned spyplane crash
Now televangelists have a basis for book sales
And the promise of effective prayers that get results
As well as God's insurance policy for guaranteed divinity
Time to give the fallout shelters a makeover
Grab a pen and pad of paper and Ikea catalogue today

[Verse 2: Sole]
No matter what plastic you pray to or sponsorship you kill for
Become a smart happy healthy pet rock if you can eat like us
You'll make great soup and hot new imports for domesticated devils
Don't worry, in thirty years we'll all be Johns and Sarahs

[Hook: Dose & Why?]
But the names of prominent families
Carry no weight in foreign cities
And even the sons of senators receive no welcome outside the States
The names of prominent families
Carry no weight in foreign cities
And even the sons of senators receive no welcome outside the States

[Interlude: Why?]
A flag stripes trying to tear free in heavy wind
And separate themselves from any unified composition
Oh, I heard the two parties split platforms at the turn of the century
But I know I'm American by the coins I carry
And that's fucking scary
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
And even the worn wigged hard news anchors are unaffected
And every psychic and small-time prophet is aloof
We've been injected to the point of immunity
It takes an f load of s to stimulate the
Desensitized tastebuds of the sugar-expecting community
Till we can barely detect the weather man's insincerity
Their tongues are fast and free
Like a child's translucent un-braced teeth
A low relief long horn
On a roughneck's rawhide wallet
(Can I hear that, ah, last tongues are fast, you know)

[Dose]
Yeah America, you got it

[Verse 3: Passage]
The audio haunting promise provides for even the smallest of sparrows
So long as the ghosts are clean and clearly showing through you
I've been helpful, metal man bides his time
In the sands on Minus Island
Everything is fine, your heart is working properly
All my love and luck on the river Euphrates

[Verse 3: Passage & Sole]
Don't take no wooden nickels, kid
There's bikinis selling SUV's in the TV's in teepees
Time to look for Job, the dorks have hit the desert
The carbohydrate kings are back with fanny packs
And daisy-cutters strapping parachutes to Lunchables
To land on the lap of the new batch of bargain hunters
Now we're not saying anything cause we're not supposed to
But like Blockbuster hamster gave the Black Panthers cancer
I know what you're thinking, it's like drinking the ocean
But if you can fall in love in prison you can die a healthy plant

[Outro: Dose]
He wanted Hammer pants, he joined the Taliban
He sought an absolute truth, the alpha cliché
But he got the omega and bucked
How many more humans will wear gun spit in their guts
Why, you can still smile on the cover of Life magazine
No matter how many bullets you take
Again we use the magnets poorly
Again we use the magnets poorly
Again we use the magnets poorly
Again we use the magnets like shit
What is it with all these men in their fifties
Wanting to win the world over like there's no tomorrow already?

No matter what you do, G.W
There'll be no dollar for you
Woe is the billionaire
Woe is the billionaire
No matter what you do, G.W
There'll be no dollar for you
Woe is the billionaire
Give him a bomb to suck on
