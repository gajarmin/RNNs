I meet this girl in Atlanta, let me play in her mizzouth
She make my dick so hizzard, it never goes Sizzouth
From the side to the side, the bitch gon' get it all
From the top of my dizzick, to the bottom of my bizzall
I feel her fingernail as she grab it and beat it
She ready to eat it whenever I skeet it
She did it in the dark but in the light she won't do it
She be unzippin my pants she be gettin straight to it
No, it was not a dream, even though that's what it seemed
I kick, I scrat, I skit, I scrat, I scream
The shit was feelin freaky, she was feelin fun
I didn't feel her teethes, I only felt her tongue
Relax, I'm gettin massaged by tha massouse
She wouldn't let me gi-zzo, she wouldn't let me loose
I don't know her she was somebody else
But I was happy that's why I said to myself
But this shit was nothin new, she do it anyway
She didn't wanna talk she ain't got nothin to say but

****Chorus****
Oh ah ah ou ow ah ah ou love ya, love in ya mouth (x 2)
We makin love sho nuff we makin love all in ya mouth (x2)
Well can I put it in yo mouth, yes ya can ((x4)

I take 3 bitches and I put 'em in a line
I take 4, 5 ,6 and blow 'dem hoes mine
It'll take 1 more before I go for mine
7 bitches get fucked at tha same time
She eats me, sun she, she can suck a dingo
All day all night all evenin long
She said she never done it, she said she never tried
Shes sittin there tellin a mother fuckin lie
Now, how many licks does it take to make my dick split
Well, not many licks if tha bitch is a good trick
Now, any niggas can talk to a bitch and get tha bitch to fuck
But how many niggas can talk to a bitch and get they dick sucked
Like me a pimp that u nevea saw
Now how do u say "ménage à trois?"
When my shit gets soft
She make my shit get long
I don't see nothin, I don't see nothin, I don't see nothin wrong

~~~Chorus~~~

Dick off to tha rima
Bring me all tha girs that be fuckin all of 'dem
With tha big pizza parler
Yes yes y'all
Me dick iz not to big 'dem pussys are to small
Wipe me dick off with a rag
Self respect doin to tha pussy I just had
As she holla'd like a chid
Dick up to her spine
For that crack head head woman there will be no tryin
Ummmmm, I can be a lover ta man
Ooooooo, no one do like I can
Hurt me hurt me for I won't cry(Chorus)x2
I'm gonna show you (show you)
You buster (you buster)
You know you love me (love me)
Now show me love (show me)

I flow like a butterfly and sting like a bee
It's Me! Ali!
And the heat inside your brain cold strong in the game
And you know this MAN
Your so good can't refuse it
This is my shadow this is my music
It's the fire, it's the funk
Now you feel me, now you don't
Super show, side to side
Shawty sukky sukky now
Cut up cut up in the dish
How much cut up do you wish?
I dont play, I'm no toy
I'm rollin it up for my homeboys
I start on it, there will be no stop
You can't beat me boy, I'm SUPERMAN

(chorus)x2

I rap too the fans, makin' that cash
Cutti'n up like a piece of glass
Imagine if you can
If you can rap like Kilo man
Flllll-bass, flllll-low
I live inside your radio
So dont give me no hastle
For I'm the king of the castle
And a reign supreme
You who am I?......Kilo the dream
That's right ha ha
That's it ha ha
Some times a brother trip
I know you admire me
I didn't mean to dis you I'm sorry
I apologize, but you better recognize
What is crap if you dont know crap
What is rap if you really can't rap then
Who in the hell said they wanted a little more
What in the fuck do you take me for?
I'll never go out for the die
And you you'll never take me alive
Can Kilo keep the party jumpin?.....ha ha

(chorus)x2

Say I, I make that pussy hurt
To sexy for my shirt
We didn't know know why
I put my dick on the side of her drawz
She came all down my pants
She got up and danced
And then she started sayin, oh  I,  love your ding a ling
Told the rest of the girls I was little
But I can go 24 in the middle
Fuckin girls is part of my diiiiick
Bumped de bump, remember that
From the back, looked kinda fat
GOOOOOOD-Damn!
Sha-Shawty  you made me scream
Sha-Shawty was 17
Sha-Shawty was a beauty queen
Shawty is a name, budda G, budda G

(chorus)till endWhen I'm alone in my room
I sit and stare at the wall
Brother can't find no love at all
I'm gonna find you girl someway, somehow
I need you right now!
Search the world, but couldn't find that feeling
Cause your love is a one in a million
Cause I like the way that you (Touch me)
And I like the way you (Fuck me)
And you really make it (Worth my while)
I said Woof, Woof, Woof, Woof, (Doggy style)
Cause you're on my mind, on my thoughts
Let me see your body talk
I'm makin love on a whole 'nother level
Have you ever danced with the Devil?
When I'm around you I feel like this
A kiss is just a kiss

(Chorus)
(girl) Baby, baby!
(kilo) Oh, work it on me
(girl) Baby, bab!y
(kilo) I need your L-O-V-E
(girl) Baby, baby!
(kilo) Baby, baby!
(girl) Baby, baby!
(kilo) And I want you to know that

Cause I'm a lover, niggas talk shit
I wish them punks would get up off my dick
Cause they try me, and they push me
I'm fuckin these niggas like pussy
But a nigga ain't gay
I said uh UH UH, it's your birthday
Same ho talk about I'm a busta
Yeah, I fucked her
I rocked her world
I Said she use to be, use to be my girl
For just one night, I said uh that face wa tight
She said I think I'm Stevie Wonder
Well I'd like to thank your momma
When I'm around you I feel like this
A kiss is just a kiss

(chorus)

Well, you can blame it on the lover in me
The heavy weight cut of the champion Ali
And in the hood I'm a menace
Hold on, sit down, let me talk, let me finish
I get that ass
Keep the camera rollin, I'm kinda fast
Get all the girls, and I shock the world
Why'd Humpty Dumpty have to fall?
Cause he was freakin off the wall
And it be like that
When you be trying, to break that back
I give my number to the ladies
Cause I would love to love you baby
When I'm around you I feel like this
A kiss is just a kiss

Alright, once again it's me
Kilo-Ali with positivity
?? so you got to hustle
Drug dealers ain't nothin but trouble
Do the crime, you gotta pay the price
What you gonna tell Jesus Christ
He don't smoke, and he don't get high
Where the kingpins go after they die?
Cause it's a sin to sell
Brother you can go to jail, you can go to hell
What about a brother be thinking he a pimp though
Will he call his own mother a trick ho?
Or his cousin, or his sister, or his auntie
Boy, you better learn to love the ladies
I think your slippin
But you think your pimp, pimp, pimpin
For a nickle and a dime, some uh y'all done lost y'all mind(2x)

I gotta stand up for myself
Brother give me freedom or give me death
When I rap for the blacks
White folks don't like to hear me talk like that
Black cop will lock me up faster
He'll be ?? for master
And I'm looking for a brother
He called me a black mother (sigh)
So I looked him in his eyes
And he made me cry, cry, cry
I know you gotta make you a livin
But why you gotta hurt my feelings
For a nickle and a dime
Some uh y'all done lost y'all mind (2x)

Chorus (4x)

See the world is a zoo
And if you live in the world I'm talking about you
You try to touch somebody's hand
They just run a better place
And if you can
See, all we need to do is keep the love in our hearts
We all survive
Without Godwe have nothing
And with God we have everything
Yes, that's why I always say
I say

Money and clothes
And beamers and bowls
I'd rather go to heaven then any of those (5x)I met this girl in Atlanta, let me play in her mizzouth
