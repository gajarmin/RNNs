[Intro]
Oooooh, Damn!
I mean I just keep thinkin about you (awww baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh, oh, oh, ooooh)
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know, but I'm a go ahead and talk about it, Listen

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
I'm sittin lookin out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You still runnin through my mind - when I'm knowin that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowin that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even apalled
I still got alot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been runnin 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they lovin it
I'm likin it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm tryna let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm tryna let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm workin at it and it ain't gettin no better
Just tryna be like "yeah, forget it, whatever"
Instead of starrin out this glass - lookin at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...

[Hook - T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick, out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me) - you don't even understand
Damn - you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doin?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin'me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm tryin man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leavin with the hot shots
Knowin they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not poppin, and my brain ain't stoppin
Thinkin who she with?, or where she goin?, is she club hoppin?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealin with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and everytime you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause

[Hook]

[Bow Wow - Repeat 2x]
Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been runnin thru my mind all day - can you feel me
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

[Hook]

[Bow Wow]
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But I guess I gotta move on right?
Still hard, and I still love until this day.. Peace![Bow Wow]
When I was 8 I was rhymin not backyard game playin
Watchin Snoop anxiously and waitin for my chance man
Hot and cocky wit it cause I kno that I am man
I'm goin down in history like American Bandstand
I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top cause I keep comin wit dough man
You steady watchin stealin but there ain't no hope man
You dealin wit somethin bigger than the US Open
And ain't no jokin
Fresh like fatlaces and dukey ropes and I keep on smokin
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm strokin
Look at me now days girl a dawg is pokin
Addicted to it J.D. say I got it bad
18 nigga makin more than yo dad see
They think they doin it but I'mma out do 'em
If you know somebody like that pull up and say to 'em

[Hook: Bow Wow] + (J-Kwon)
Ye ain't ridin (ye ain't ridin)
Ye ain't bumpin like I'm bumpin

You don't keep it Doug E. like I keep it Doug E
Lil buddy you ain't fresh azimiz

[J-Kwon]

Think you can get it crunk like me but you can't

[Verse 2]
Now every record that I make I'm tryin to get up out the store man
Every car I drive I'm tryin have you sayin whoa man
Fourth album comeback power like rogaine
Records say Columbia but I'm So So man
I stay on my grind bringin in that dough man
From records to movies now a TV show man
Anything given to me I'm gon rep man
Big house, big cars what you expect man
Just to get a glimpse girls breakin they neck man
Blinded by the light glistenin off the Breitling
Bow hot as ever I ain't lost no step
Straight t-shirt, sneakers I ain't tryin to go prep
Like these lil r 'n' b groups that need my help
Wish they had my style wish they had my rep
But oh no, you'll never have it like me man
And if you can't understand this is what I'm sayin

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got a spot in M-I-A to get away from the cold weather
Talk around town as if I'm wit Ciara
Bow fall off nigga that'll be never
I'm rich (yea I'm rich) I can do whatever
I get a kick outta shuttin suckas down in the parkin lot
Especially when they tryin to stunt thinking they hot
All out the window talking loud like they runnin my block
That's when I come through (come through) and all that stop
And ain't another younger keep it fresh like dis man
Every year, same time come wit them hits man
Tired of makin girls fall out wit a kiss man
Well listen and you're stuck music just like quicksand
Older people say that lil young dude sick man
Young A.I. and we crew thick man
Difference between me and you is you be bricklin
And I ain't never ever done that before (no)

[Bow Wow]
Ye ain't ridin (ye ain't ridin)
Ye ain't bumpin like I'm bumpin
Ye ain't sayin nuthin homie
Ye ain't fresh azimiz

You don't keep it Doug E. like I keep it Doug E
Lil buddy you ain't fresh azimiz

[Hook][Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Uhh... (ooooooh)
Uhh, ha ha (uh, uh, listen)
Y'all know what this is! (let's go)

[Verse 1: Nelly (J.D.)]
We used to ditch school and head straight up to the mall (mall)
Just so we could be the first ones with 'em on (c'mon)
Returned to school by lunchtime like, "Nigga what now?"
And today we in the club like, "Nigga what now?"
You better look down cause uhh, I know you see 'em (say what?)
I know you see 'em (say what?) I know you see 'em
I paid - a thousand for the jeans, I paid 200 for the shoes
And uhh, fuck a shirt, I'mma rock these tattoos (and uh)
You see my fitted mayne, I represent the crib
Cause even at the crib, I represent the crib
I, might pop my grill in - and I, might let my chain hang
And I, might wrap my wrist dang (go on derrty do the damn thang)
I get 'em free (say what) but I pay
And if I want I rock a different year of J's e'ry day (uhh)
A different style, different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like

[Hook: Nelly] {w/ J.D. ad libs}
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
These just came out! He done stepped on my J's (uhh)
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
I can't believe this shit! He done stepped on my J's

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
Uhh, I-I-I got 'em all (got 'em all) but they don't get no run
Like them 13's, 7's, number fo' and the 1's
I like, how they look with Dickies, how do Levi lay on 'em?
If you ain't got 'em when you see me you definitely gon' want 'em
If they knew I gotta get 'em first, old as a copper box
Hook 'em with a shirt, and the matchin color socks
I think the coldest was the black on black with leathers with the red bottom
Or the number 9's, you shoulda seen me when I got 'em
I was in my house (in my house) dancin in the mirror
Straight thinkin 'bout gettin out and how I'm 'bout to kill 'em
When you know you got a pair that ain't nobody got (body got)
You can't hold 'em back homie, you gotta rock (you gotta rock)
I'm a addict, a Jordan fanatic, little Mars Blackmon
I know when they comin, number, color, e'rything that's happenin
You know, a different style, a different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ciara]
I-I-I, I see you lil' daddy you look sexy with them J's on
I pull up in the drop, and step out, with them things on
I got me the black and pink - patent leather with the grey
Matchin with the skinny jeans - off with the shades
I know you see me (I know you see me) my jeans be never slippin (slippin)
The paparazzi, I might stop and take a picture in 'em
Yeahhhhh, we be fresh every day
And if you lookin for me lil' daddy you can find me in the A! A! A! A!

[Verse 4: Nelly (J.D.)]
I got the Retro 1's, uhh
(Then I bought the) 2's (and the) 3's (and the) 4's (uhh)
I had to order these, you can't find them in the store (nope)
Called up my stylist like, "Shorty send more"
And if you would please send 'em to me out on tour
(Uh-uh, uh-uh) They be here in a minute mayne
See I got that connect where I can damn near get like anythang
Plus all my hoes on 'em, then I'mma stroll on 'em
I call my hook-up at the store like "Put a hold on 'em"
Them Carolina number 9's matchin patent leather wristbands
Patent leather number 11's, we call 'em Space Jams
You in my space man, I'mma make you jump man
I'll make you jump, the jump, the jump jump man
See on my weekends, my J's play a part
I'm rockin these to the club and these to the park
I'm puttin these on now and these here tomorrow
A spare off in my car, just in case I catch a scar

[Hook][Hook: Trey Songz]
This is the last time, I know I'm 'bout to drive you crazy
Last time but I gotta see my baby
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more
Try to walk but I just can't leave her alone, girl
She keep callin' me, callin' me, I try to leave her alone but
She keep callin' me, callin' me and I gotta go

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Damn, here we go again, I just came back
Girl, don't make me go again, she say you been in the streets
You was with that ho again, money wrapped in rubber bands
What you sellin' blow again?
How she got you holdin' guns but you call that ho your friend?
You ain't 'posed to bring her home, what do you show her in?
I was like show her in, never that, oh no
Anybody in the streets know that that's a no, no
So know I would never ever, ever, ever
Baby, I'm a G, yeah, that's right the seventh letter
See one thing about the streets, I know where the heffer at
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her at
But you know we had a bond, no ring, no paper
And I don't hear this shit when I bring home paper
My ears to the streets, what you gonna tell us?
You keep talkin' down, girl, you sound like you jealous

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Hi honey, I'm home
She looked at me and said it's five somethin' in the morn
You smell like you been drinkin', the vibe from me this strong
I said, baby, that's cologne, she said, nigga, that's patron
If you wanna keep with them bad habits, that's fine
You think I'm with it then you out your rabid ass mind
They'll say tricks are for kids, most chicks woulda slid
But who ain't miss a visit through the six that you did
I'll be damned if I do another six with some kids
Who only see they daddy in them flicks on the fridge
Them niggas that you think are inna mix with ya shit
They the same reason Michael Vick's doin' bids
I say hold up, I met you, I was thuggin' back then
And you was ridin' with me holdin' on a Mack 10
But that was back when you ain't give a what
Now you standin' here tellin' me to give her up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Hold on, baby please
You can't leave now, no, John baby, please
We gonna get you to a hospital, as quickly as possible
Life is full of obstacles, we gon' get you through this one
You looked me in my eye when you told me you was done
I played her for a fool but I guess I was the foolish one
'Member when she told me that she know how this dream ends
Late night phone call from one of my close friends
Tellin' you that we are, rushin' to the ER
By this time tomorrow we was posed to be in DR
Me blowin' a cigar, you sippin' a 'tini
I told her pack her bags and don't forget her bikini
Then just like Houdini, it all disappeared
The escape to paradise, didn't end like this I swear
Sorry baby girl, I tried the best I could
If I can't be in the streets I guess Heaven's just as good

[Hook][Hook: Trey Songz]
I see you looking at me exactly like you know what it do
When I leave where I'm at, make my way over to you
'Cuz I ain't playin with you girl (just want you to know) I ain't playin
If I whisper in your ear wats goin through in my, in my head baby
I bet you turn around and tell me baby let's le-eave

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Any girl JD used to bring around I had a crush on
Wishing I cud take 'em to my room and get my touch on
If you was just a lil older is what they used to say
Kissing me huggin callin me baby how dey use to play
But now that I am twenty-one if you go to kissing and hugging me
Lil mommy I'm trying to cop something, I'm in the club now tearing up
Tank top, standing on the couch screaming "who bet I can't stop"
Album number 7, started at 11, steady youngest nigga killing it
Shawty you better tell 'em uh, used to be your lil sister that I was concerned about
Now I want you I see you lookin now I'm a thug it out
Don't slip look again girl if you do I'm goin in tell 'em lil mama wat you waitin for I just want you to know
I ain't playin I ain't playin girl you already kno

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
If you a fly young chick I'm a fly young nigga
Plenty dudes make fake us but nobody got a swag like mine
Feelin horny girl I know you want me girl
I'm 'bout to tell you what I'm thinking baby close your eyes
I'm right here baby I'm in your ear baby
Let's make a movie need to get that ass in here baby
I like to drink a lot let's take it to my spot
Soon as we hit the doooor were gonna drink some more
And I'm a kiss you here and I'm a kiss you there and I'm a kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya
Kiss ya everywhere (bow wow) said I'm a kiss you der and I'm a kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya
Kiss ya everywhere

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
They say rockstars live tha life, but I beg to differ
Tommy Lee and Nikki somethin' ain't got shit on this nigga
From some playboy bunnies girls with their own money
Got 'em so backed up in my sidekick it ain't funny
Got 'em high enough in parties sometimes keep the red carpet
'Cuz I don't know how to stop it once I get it started
I go hard, go hard when I'm in the paint quick to let you know I'm everything that your nigga ain't
If he ain't got a mil ticket, a mansion, and a condo fleet full of cars than you need to let your man go
This ain't bout the money baby, this about a good time and I ain't trying to replace your man I'm just talking bout this one time
And your mind saying no but your body saying yes, how you droppin in that dress and your eyes tell the rest
So don't slip (jecho) look again (jecho) girl if you do I'm goin inI mean, I mean, heh
Y'all know what that is right?
I mean, I mean
Y'all know what that is right? Uhh

[Chorus]
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' mama (shake shake that back girl) I wanna see ya
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' mama (shake shake that back girl)

[Bow Wow]
Tags on the back of the Lamb' say B-Dub
Everynight I'm in the streets and I'm G'd up
5th album and I'm still bangin out ya spea-kers
SoSoDef, can't nobody see us
You know I keep it fresh when it comes to the fashion
At the age 10 is when my momma heard the passion
I gotta stay stuntin and I gotta keep flashin
7 figure checks is the only thing I'm cashin, I smash it
Everything I get on it look tight
Ain't nothin like a hump when it jump and it shook right, shook right
Ladies on a homey like I'm Denzel
Shirt off, big chain rockin like I'm LL
Since 12 I done had a mill' sittin in my garage
Lil' Brazilian girls comin givin me a massage
Before I was, people was treat me like a big {ass} star
It's a test if you wanna be in my entourage, uhh

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow]
I keep catchin all my lil' comp in a slumber
Comin with that heat that keep me hotter than a summer
Call it what you want, I'm the king of Columbus
And if you wanna act up, D got the dumper (how you ride)
'Round here I'm ridin 30's on a Hummer
Tag on the back of it say "Boy Wonder"
Fo' 15's beats sound like thunder
The baddest girl up in here, I better get her number
When I was younger, momma said I was a dreamer
Moved to Atlanta, stayed with J.D. and Teena
Never ever though, I'd be sellin out arenas
Drivin e'rythang from a Phantom to a Beemer
Baby is you hearin what I'm sayin, I'm the real deal
{Nigga} that you wit, he a snack I'm a full meal
I see you got it in the back like Jessica Beale
But you talkin baby all I wanna know if it's trill
Now let me see

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow]
Groove with it (groove with it) do it (do it)
Girl turn around and show me how you move it, I said
Groove with it (groove with it) do it (do it)
Girl turn around and show me how you move it
Rollin with the B it's like when you fly first class
E'rything free, much different than them dirtbags
I'm an entertainer keep you focused like a circus
God put me here to get it poppin, that's my purpose
{Niggas} say they know me cause they gettin overpowered
See I make it storm and the {bitch} make it shower
20 minutes all he got, I last four hours
So when I come around, he outta business like Tower
Baby it ain't trickin if you got it, that's the motto
Hitmakers ballin like we just hit the lotto
Front and back, y'all feel with e'ry kind of auto
Take your pick and you can bring it back tomorrow long as you let me see it

[Chorus]"It's not - It's not me exactly, who touches people
It's what I represent, the possibility that dreams long ago
May still come true, even if they - even-even-even if they look lost forever"

[Bow Wow]
I had a homey named Tony, sixteen, six two
Headed to the NBA straight from high school
My nigga had his ball game on lock
But at the same time, he was in love with the block
All the stuff that came wit it, the drugs and the guns
The gangs, the slang and all the funds
He just got a letter of contempt from the Cavaliers
Sayin' how they love him and they wish he was there
He had +it made+ like +Special Ed+, about to get the bread
But chose, to do, sumthin' dumb instead
Go to war with the crew on the other side of town
And was mo' ready, and Tony got laid down
He ain't even have a chance
Died before the ambulance, even got to him
So many went through him
I hate to tell the story, but that's how it is
Growin' up in the hood as a kid

[Hook]
When you got big dreams, don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the wayside ("even-even if they look lost forever")
When you got big dreams
Don't listen to what nobody say and don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the waste side, reach for the sky ("even-even if they look lost forever")

I knew this girl named Gina that was a hell of a singer
And everybody fell in love with her when they seen her
Baby girl was on the verge of signing a big deal
Eighteen, and life looked so-so real
She was stuck wit a dude that was all bad news
And all he ever did was give baby the blues
But she was true to a nigga, do for a nigga
Pop you and ya whole crew for a nigga
One night he came, picked her up told her, "let's ride!"
That's the same night that he watched her die!
They was tryna hit a lick, but the lick hit back
Put a end to the deal, and all of that
She ain't even have to be there, he know it wha'nt right
Now he gotta deal with it for the rest of his life
And the part I don't like, he ain't even get graze
But homegirl, Gina, is layin' in the grave

[Hook]

I got a few relatives given family drama
Always got they hands out when they see me and my momma
One coulda been a doctor, the other a chef
But when he got his own kitchen, he was cookin' sumthin' else
Now his life in the drain, a triflin' shame
He all washed up, wife took e'rything
No car, no mo', no HOUSE
And everywhere he go, he stole, so they throwed him out
I was growin' up, lookin' up to be like them
Now I'm throwin' up cash, rollin' up in the Bent
I was stuck wit a dream I had since a shorty
I be DAMNED if I let another man support me, now
Uncle Junebug's sick, skinny as hell
He got AIDS in his body from the needles he shared
E'rytime he get his welfare checks, he don't care
You wanna see him go to the crack house, he there

[Hook]

When you got big dreams
When you got big dreams ("even-even if they look lost forever")

Question; What y'all know about swangers on slab
30's on a Hummer with the butterfly doors
Lucky Charm teeth, lack on them D's
Chevy sitting high, iced out everythang
Stacks on deck, no bank
What y'all know about five of the hottest young niggas in the game
Bow Wow, Short Dawg, Scrappy
The boy Lil' Wayne, the homie Pimp C
We got a little story to tell y'all bout where we come from

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I come from where a Chevy with a trunk full of bump is all that's wanted
And the year don't matter long as you throw some, throw some Ds on it
Mouth cost more than your house, house on ten acres
And the inside so fly niggas call me Jim Baker
From Ohio to Texas, we're so infectious
A-T-L to S-T-L it's gon' be hard to catch us
I'm talking bout bills sipping on bar
Drinking crunk, living like there's no tomorrow
See out-of-towners can't understand, cause I cut all my words short
Popping Texas, mandatory, Saturday at the mall
Hoods ain't hoods, they called wars and zones
Guns cart choppers and when it's on, it's on
See the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, hear me out
Said the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, now answer me this

[Hook x4: Pimp C]
Unh, now what y'all know about the country boys
Coming down with candy toys, playing hard talking noise

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
The boy country like overalls you know that dawg
Catch me in the slab, the same color as Bubu's rust
Cruising up the Ave and I'm probably gon give yo' ho a call
Cuz I ball hard and I'm stuntin' like there's no tomorrow
So yesterday, I swear I spent about fifty G's
On a wristwatch that shine brighter that a Christmas tree
If you was getting cheese, you would probably spend it, too
So don't hate me cause I blow paper like the wind do
And hop out clean, so watch out, Queen
I'm the biggest balla in Houston homie, not Yao Ming
I'm getting money maine, so my pockets hella chubby
And I be sipping drank that's purple like a Teletubby
So when it comes to the women dog, I can tell they love me
They put they panties in a envelope an mail 'em to me
Now how's that for some fanmail
But me an Bow got a question, know the answer, raise your hand, yea

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Lil' Scrappy]
They call me Fisher Price cause all I do is play nice
And I ain't gon run a gang of gorillas that love to fight
I'm the Iceman, I'm far away from the sun
But I'm still hot like a bullet pushing up out a gun
My charger look like a muscle lifting a ton
If you picking on me, yea you picked the right one
You passed another drink and I'm sipping another one
You trust me with the blunt and I'm blowing myself a blunt
Got a Fruit Loop Coupe looking like orange juice
When them niggas see the troop, they don't be knowing what to do
Yea I'm Scrap, greatest young nigga in the nation
Y'all niggas quit hating on the money that I'm making
I'm just country

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]
Look they call me Wayne, dirty south chaperone
So far ahead in the race, I don't know which lap I'm on
No homo, Young Louisiana
Hit you wit the .357 like MC Hammer
And money talks, so that's my grammar
If you ain't about money, you can step like a gamma
Am I the illest doing this? Hell yeah
I am fresher than the Prince of Bel-Air
And OG kush I what you smell here
Smoking the biggest blunts, don't worry I brought a spare
They say I'm at the top, but I'm almost there
And when I get, I will sit, don't worry I brought a chair
I put ice all over the Audemar
Piguet watchface, now time is hard to tell
And I will do whatever The Carter shall
So hot, going out with me is like going to hell

[Refrain]"It's not - It's not me exactly, who touches people
It's what I represent, the possibility that dreams long ago
May still come true, even if they - even-even-even if they look lost forever"

Don't listen to what nobody say and don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the waste side, reach for the sky ("even-even if they look lost forever")

I knew this girl named Gina that was a hell of a singer
And everybody fell in love with her when they seen her
Baby girl was on the verge of signing a big deal
Eighteen, and life looked so-so real
She was stuck wit a dude that was all bad news
And all he ever did was give baby the blues
But she was true to a nigga, do for a nigga
Pop you and ya whole crew for a nigga
One night he came, picked her up told her, "let's ride!"
That's the same night that he watched her die!
They was tryna hit a lick, but the lick hit back
Put a end to the deal, and all of that
She ain't even have to be there, he know it wha'nt right
Now he gotta deal with it for the rest of his life
And the part I don't like, he ain't even get graze
But homegirl, Gina, is layin' in the grave

[Hook]

I got a few relatives given family drama
Always got they hands out when they see me and my momma
One coulda been a doctor, the other a chef
But when he got his own kitchen, he was cookin' sumthin' else
Now his life in the drain, a triflin' shame
He all washed up, wife took e'rything
No car, no mo', no HOUSE
And everywhere he go, he stole, so they throwed him out
I was growin' up, lookin' up to be like them
Now I'm throwin' up cash, rollin' up in the Bent
I was stuck wit a dream I had since a shorty
I be DAMNED if I let another man support me, now
Uncle Junebug's sick, skinny as hell
He got AIDS in his body from the needles he shared
E'rytime he get his welfare checks, he don't care
You wanna see him go to the crack house, he there

[Hook]

When you got big dreams
When you got big dreams ("even-even if they look lost forever")
When you got big dreams
When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the waste side, reach for the sky
("even-even-even if they look lost forever")[Hook - Bow Wow] + (Snoop Dogg)
On a mission whisin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
(In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin niggas down like Evander Holyfield, geah)

[Verse 1]
I might come to your toooooown, shut a show dooooooown (okay)
Got the whole crowd screamin', "Lil' Bow Wooooow"
Without the "Lil'" but I'm still on top
Back with S.S.D. record sales won't flop (nah)
That's what you thought, but I'm in that new Porshe
No box earrings, chain on no watch (that's big)
Picture a grandfather clock with DII-amonds
That's just the kinda mind state that I'mmm in
Caviar, Cartier, carterdrop
On my neck, call her dead cute shorty called liner (come heeere)
I'm on my p's and my q's
Stones green to the blue 23's when I cruise
Feel my calf muscle on the gas and the brake pedal
Ain't another youngin' on my bank level (where you at?!)
I'm right hurr, neva late, please see clurrr, its no blurrrr, yes surrr

[Hook 1 1/2X with Snoop and Bow Wow's line switched around]

I'm on leer jets, know what make your face
From your tears wet while you rockin' last years SWEATS
Swag, yeah, I got it Prada bags for my luggage
Face on-screen for everything I does in the pub-lic
Boy won-da, make the other boys won-da
How we keep it comin' different e'ry summa
Don't be amazed cause of me
Be amazed cause the V came with a five year opped-out lease
Yea...that's cause I paid what I paid
If you paid like I'm paid, then yo' cribs came wit the maids
And if it didn't, then you slippin', catch up
But by the time you do, I'll probably do it different
I'm advanced, see the pants, see the kicks
See the stones on the risk, you see the phone on my hip? (where it at?!)
It's right thurr, up to date, please see clurrr, its no blurrr, yes surrr

[Hook 2 with Snoop and Bow Wow's line switched back around]

[Snoop Dogg]
Shootin' niggas down, slappin' bitches up
Straight cash strut with some Henny in my cup
Rude for the hell of it, I should be the president
Aye yo homey, Doggy Dogg got the medicine
(Where, where?) In the cabinet, I'm the magnet
Of attracting the baddest bitches on the planet, dig it (dig it, dig it)
I once was a pup, neva scared to run up
I did it 'til the day I came up
And stars do shine, I take my 32 lines and try to make you unwind
First I, chop 'em and den some, flop 'em then flip 'em
Break 'em and bend 'em, then fix 'em
Convince 'em to buy my records, cause you know it's all hits
Spread the word cause you know it's the shit!
Quit playin', go get it, quit hesitatin'
It's the young and the big on tha real my nig'

[Bow Wow]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, UH..
106 & Park ain't been the same since I had it
So I'm back at it - freeze
Still a Juvenile at 400 Degrees
Lil' girls still fallin' out, I'm still ballin'
Crawlin' out the hottest speeds on these ATL streets
From the Garden, to the box office, I shuts down both
And no matter where I go I'm still, O-H-I-Ohhhhhhh
E'rybody know this is MY turf!
Who had it crunk first, and had girls of all ages off one verse?
(YOU!) Ain't nobody else can name
Another seventeen year-old manye that do it this HARD
"Oh LORD", that's what them old niggas say about me
Young niggas play, can't go a day without me
If bling was a drug, I'd DIE from an overdose
Fresh Prince to Sugarloaf, Homey I'm the most you've seen
I got the same affects on both coasts
And e'rything hot on fo' wheels, homey I'm ghost

[Hook 1]
Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he
Stop tryna do what you see
Do you - Cause right here is my love homey
Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey
Do you - It's so-so sloppy and the fans know a copy
When they see one, I would neva wanna be one
Do you - As long as it sound right
E'rybody in town like it
Don't worry 'bout nobody else, else
Do you

Not just the rap game, the whole industry the same
E'rybody wanna look and sound like the next manye
But I'm definite there ain't another me
And I'm So-So-Definite, back wit J.D
Back to give these little imitators sumthin' to talk on
Breathe, Stretch, let it go, homey get yo walk on!
Black Beat, Teen People, can't forget Right On!
A lotta things changed since the young don's been gone
What chug on roll with? The future is me!
Only youngins that's movin' units is.ugh.ME
Young Ali, float like a butterfly
Get up out them stores quick, why wouldn't you wanna buy?
The carbon copy, not the copy
Imitators mimic, but them guys is sloppy, heh, heh
As for me, I'm the leader of the new school
I can just ad-just, so the rest of y'all just

[Hook 1]
Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he
Stop tryna do what you see
Do you - Cause right here is my love homey
Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey
Do you - It's so-so sloppy and the fans know a copy
When they see one, I would neva wanna be one
Do you - As long as it sound right
E'rybody in town like it
Don't worry 'bout nobody else, else
Do you

[Jermaine Durpi - talking]
See?!
It's rare to find people like us..
Everybody out there doin what I'm doin!
Or tryna do what I'm doin, you can't man!
At one point in ya life, man, you gotta get in yo own lane and stop swervin' in mine!
See what I do, I do my way!
What about you, huh?! HUH?! CAN YOU SAY THAT?!

[Hook 2]
Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he
Stop tryna do what you see
Do you - Cause right here is my love homey
Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey
Do you- [Choir singing]
Do you

When I was 8 I was rhymin not backyard game playin

I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top cause I keep comin wit dough man
You steady watchin stealin but there ain't no hope man
You dealin wit somethin bigger than the US Open

Fresh like fatlaces and dukey ropes and I keep on smokin
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm strokin
Look at me now days girl a dawg is pokin
Addicted to it J.D. say I got it bad

[Hook: Bow Wow] + (J-Kwon)

Every car I drive I'm tryin have you sayin whoa man
Fourth album comeback power like rogaine

From records to movies now a TV show man
Anything given to me I'm gon rep man
Big house, big cars what you expect man
Just to get a glimpse girls breakin they neck man
Blinded by the light glistenin off the Breitling
Bow hot as ever I ain't lost no step
Straight t-shirt, sneakers I ain't tryin to go prep
Like these lil r 'n' b groups that need my help
Wish they had my style wish they had my rep
But oh no, you'll never have it like me man
And if you can't understand this is what I'm sayin

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got a spot in M-I-A to get away from the cold weather
Talk around town as if I'm wit Ciara
Bow fall off nigga that'll be never
I'm rich (yea I'm rich) I can do whatever
I get a kick outta shuttin suckas down in the parkin lot
Especially when they tryin to stunt thinking they hot
All out the window talking loud like they runnin my block
That's when I come through (come through) and all that stop
And ain't another younger keep it fresh like dis man
Every year, same time come wit them hits man
Tired of makin girls fall out wit a kiss man
Well listen and you're stuck music just like quicksand
Older people say that lil young dude sick man
Young A.I. and we crew thick man
Difference between me and you is you be bricklin
And I ain't never ever done that before (no)

[Bow Wow]
Ye ain't ridin (ye ain't ridin)

Lil' lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' mama (shake shake that back girl)

[Bow Wow]
Tags on the back of the Lamb' say B-Dub
Everynight I'm in the streets and I'm G'd up
5th album and I'm still bangin out ya spea-kers
SoSoDef, can't nobody see us
You know I keep it fresh when it comes to the fashion
At the age 10 is when my momma heard the passion
I gotta stay stuntin and I gotta keep flashin
7 figure checks is the only thing I'm cashin, I smash it
Everything I get on it look tight
Ain't nothin like a hump when it jump and it shook right, shook right
Ladies on a homey like I'm Denzel
Shirt off, big chain rockin like I'm LL
Since 12 I done had a mill' sittin in my garage
Lil' Brazilian girls comin givin me a massage
Before I was, people was treat me like a big {ass} star
It's a test if you wanna be in my entourage, uhh

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow]
I keep catchin all my lil' comp in a slumber
Comin with that heat that keep me hotter than a summer
Call it what you want, I'm the king of Columbus
And if you wanna act up, D got the dumper (how you ride)
'Round here I'm ridin 30's on a Hummer
Tag on the back of it say "Boy Wonder"
Fo' 15's beats sound like thunder
The baddest girl up in here, I better get her number
When I was younger, momma said I was a dreamer
Moved to Atlanta, stayed with J.D. and Teena
Never ever though, I'd be sellin out arenas
Drivin e'rythang from a Phantom to a Beemer
Baby is you hearin what I'm sayin, I'm the real deal
{Nigga} that you wit, he a snack I'm a full meal
I see you got it in the back like Jessica Beale
But you talkin baby all I wanna know if it's trill
Now let me see

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow]
Groove with it (groove with it) do it (do it)
Girl turn around and show me how you move it, I said
Groove with it (groove with it) do it (do it)
Girl turn around and show me how you move it
Rollin with the B it's like when you fly first class
E'rything free, much different than them dirtbags
I'm an entertainer keep you focused like a circus
God put me here to get it poppin, that's my purpose
{Niggas} say they know me cause they gettin overpowered
See I make it storm and the {bitch} make it shower
20 minutes all he got, I last four hours
So when I come around, he outta business like Tower
Baby it ain't trickin if you got it, that's the motto
Hitmakers ballin like we just hit the lotto
Front and back, y'all feel with e'ry kind of auto
Take your pick and you can bring it back tomorrow long as you let me see it

[Chorus][Hook: Trey Songz]
I see you looking at me exactly like you know what it do
When I leave where I'm at, make my way over to you
'Cuz I ain't playin with you girl (just want you to know) I ain't playin
If I whisper in your ear wats goin through in my, in my head baby
I bet you turn around and tell me baby let's le-eave

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Any girl JD used to bring around I had a crush on
Wishing I cud take 'em to my room and get my touch on
If you was just a lil older is what they used to say
Kissing me huggin callin me baby how dey use to play
But now that I am twenty-one if you go to kissing and hugging me
Lil mommy I'm trying to cop something, I'm in the club now tearing up
Tank top, standing on the couch screaming "who bet I can't stop"
Album number 7, started at 11, steady youngest nigga killing it
Shawty you better tell 'em uh, used to be your lil sister that I was concerned about
Now I want you I see you lookin now I'm a thug it out
Don't slip look again girl if you do I'm goin in tell 'em lil mama wat you waitin for I just want you to know
I ain't playin I ain't playin girl you already kno

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
If you a fly young chick I'm a fly young nigga
Plenty dudes make fake us but nobody got a swag like mine
Feelin horny girl I know you want me girl
I'm 'bout to tell you what I'm thinking baby close your eyes
I'm right here baby I'm in your ear baby
Let's make a movie need to get that ass in here baby
I like to drink a lot let's take it to my spot
Soon as we hit the doooor were gonna drink some more
And I'm a kiss you here and I'm a kiss you there and I'm a kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya
Kiss ya everywhere (bow wow) said I'm a kiss you der and I'm a kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya
Kiss ya everywhere

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
They say rockstars live tha life, but I beg to differ
Tommy Lee and Nikki somethin' ain't got shit on this nigga
From some playboy bunnies girls with their own money
Got 'em so backed up in my sidekick it ain't funny
Got 'em high enough in parties sometimes keep the red carpet
'Cuz I don't know how to stop it once I get it started
I go hard, go hard when I'm in the paint quick to let you know I'm everything that your nigga ain't
If he ain't got a mil ticket, a mansion, and a condo fleet full of cars than you need to let your man go
This ain't bout the money baby, this about a good time and I ain't trying to replace your man I'm just talking bout this one time
And your mind saying no but your body saying yes, how you droppin in that dress and your eyes tell the rest
So don't slip (jecho) look again (jecho) girl if you do I'm goin in[Hook: Trey Songz]
This is the last time, I know I'm 'bout to drive you crazy
Last time but I gotta see my baby
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more
Try to walk but I just can't leave her alone, girl
She keep callin' me, callin' me, I try to leave her alone but
She keep callin' me, callin' me and I gotta go

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Damn, here we go again, I just came back
Girl, don't make me go again, she say you been in the streets
You was with that ho again, money wrapped in rubber bands
What you sellin' blow again?
How she got you holdin' guns but you call that ho your friend?
You ain't 'posed to bring her home, what do you show her in?
I was like show her in, never that, oh no
Anybody in the streets know that that's a no, no
So know I would never ever, ever, ever
Baby, I'm a G, yeah, that's right the seventh letter
See one thing about the streets, I know where the heffer at
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her at
But you know we had a bond, no ring, no paper
And I don't hear this shit when I bring home paper
My ears to the streets, what you gonna tell us?
You keep talkin' down, girl, you sound like you jealous

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Hi honey, I'm home
She looked at me and said it's five somethin' in the morn
You smell like you been drinkin', the vibe from me this strong
I said, baby, that's cologne, she said, nigga, that's patron
If you wanna keep with them bad habits, that's fine
You think I'm with it then you out your rabid ass mind
They'll say tricks are for kids, most chicks woulda slid
But who ain't miss a visit through the six that you did
I'll be damned if I do another six with some kids
Who only see they daddy in them flicks on the fridge
Them niggas that you think are inna mix with ya shit
They the same reason Michael Vick's doin' bids
I say hold up, I met you, I was thuggin' back then
And you was ridin' with me holdin' on a Mack 10
But that was back when you ain't give a what
Now you standin' here tellin' me to give her up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Hold on, baby please
You can't leave now, no, John baby, please
We gonna get you to a hospital, as quickly as possible
Life is full of obstacles, we gon' get you through this one
You looked me in my eye when you told me you was done
I played her for a fool but I guess I was the foolish one
'Member when she told me that she know how this dream ends
Late night phone call from one of my close friends
Tellin' you that we are, rushin' to the ER
By this time tomorrow we was posed to be in DR
Me blowin' a cigar, you sippin' a 'tini
I told her pack her bags and don't forget her bikini
Then just like Houdini, it all disappeared
The escape to paradise, didn't end like this I swear
Sorry baby girl, I tried the best I could
If I can't be in the streets I guess Heaven's just as good

[Hook][Verse 1: Daz]
I got trees in a Jar 23's on a car
You can bleed if I star we on the bulevaurd
Got straps simple as dat hand on the trigger
Need 30 mo' Ohhhhh's to add to these figures
See my necks so heavy gotta shine up the Chevy
See ya betta stay wit it or ya gon' get wet
Stay in the fresh shit new fly kicks
Hundred thousand dolla whip nigga dose dat triiiiiip
Get cha walk on, throw up ya set
Yea get it how you livin' nigga rep musik
Diamonds on my neck diamonds on my wrists

You know the clubs so packed, girls so stacked
Me and my niggas smokin chronic in the back
Got ass so fat, I like it like that
When she get up all on it I'll beat it from the back....

[Hook]
On some real shit
I gotta be the best
I gotta stay fresh

On some real shit
I got mo' bounce than an ounce
I'll do it to you bad for a large amount

[Rick Ross]
It had to be a dope chain
Started wit the dope game

Tired of bein poor mayne
Cracks in a niggas roof
Buckets just to catch the rain
Sellin crack on the roof buckin just to get a name
Now I'm crack in a roof open up the bentley brains
No flaws in the stones, iced out urrrthang
Three colors on a wrist, watch cost anotha fifty
So So Def D-P-G fuckin on some real shit
West coast got the best smoke Miami hoes well known for the best throat
Miami well known for the best dope
Hit the cell phone now for the best quotes (quotes)
You see the pretty paint, you see I'm sitting high

On the turn fo' payed like the boss that I work for
Fatty Mazerati and Ferrari and the Lambo, strapped like Rambo
Clip after clip, yeah, I love the set trip and love the sured up shit, but

[Hook x2][Intro]
Oooooh, Damn!
I mean I just keep thinkin about you (awww baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh, oh, oh, ooooh)
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know, but I'm a go ahead and talk about it, Listen

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
I'm sittin lookin out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You still runnin through my mind - when I'm knowin that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowin that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even apalled
I still got alot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been runnin 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they lovin it
I'm likin it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm tryna let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm tryna let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm workin at it and it ain't gettin no better
Just tryna be like "yeah, forget it, whatever"
Instead of starrin out this glass - lookin at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...

[Hook - T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick, out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me) - you don't even understand
Damn - you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doin?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin'me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm tryin man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leavin with the hot shots
Knowin they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not poppin, and my brain ain't stoppin
Thinkin who she with?, or where she goin?, is she club hoppin?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealin with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and everytime you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause

[Hook]

[Bow Wow - Repeat 2x]
Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been runnin thru my mind all day - can you feel me
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

[Hook]

[Bow Wow]
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But I guess I gotta move on right?
Still hard, and I still love until this day.. Peace![Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Uhh... (ooooooh)
Uhh, ha ha (uh, uh, listen)
Y'all know what this is! (let's go)

[Verse 1: Nelly (J.D.)]
We used to ditch school and head straight up to the mall (mall)
Just so we could be the first ones with 'em on (c'mon)
Returned to school by lunchtime like, "Nigga what now?"
And today we in the club like, "Nigga what now?"
You better look down cause uhh, I know you see 'em (say what?)
I know you see 'em (say what?) I know you see 'em
I paid - a thousand for the jeans, I paid 200 for the shoes
And uhh, fuck a shirt, I'mma rock these tattoos (and uh)
You see my fitted mayne, I represent the crib
Cause even at the crib, I represent the crib
I, might pop my grill in - and I, might let my chain hang
And I, might wrap my wrist dang (go on derrty do the damn thang)
I get 'em free (say what) but I pay
And if I want I rock a different year of J's e'ry day (uhh)
A different style, different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like

[Hook: Nelly] {w/ J.D. ad libs}
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
These just came out! He done stepped on my J's (uhh)
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
I can't believe this shit! He done stepped on my J's

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
Uhh, I-I-I got 'em all (got 'em all) but they don't get no run
Like them 13's, 7's, number fo' and the 1's
I like, how they look with Dickies, how do Levi lay on 'em?
If you ain't got 'em when you see me you definitely gon' want 'em
If they knew I gotta get 'em first, old as a copper box
Hook 'em with a shirt, and the matchin color socks
I think the coldest was the black on black with leathers with the red bottom
Or the number 9's, you shoulda seen me when I got 'em
I was in my house (in my house) dancin in the mirror
Straight thinkin 'bout gettin out and how I'm 'bout to kill 'em
When you know you got a pair that ain't nobody got (body got)
You can't hold 'em back homie, you gotta rock (you gotta rock)
I'm a addict, a Jordan fanatic, little Mars Blackmon
I know when they comin, number, color, e'rything that's happenin
You know, a different style, a different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ciara]
I-I-I, I see you lil' daddy you look sexy with them J's on
I pull up in the drop, and step out, with them things on
I got me the black and pink - patent leather with the grey
Matchin with the skinny jeans - off with the shades
I know you see me (I know you see me) my jeans be never slippin (slippin)
The paparazzi, I might stop and take a picture in 'em
Yeahhhhh, we be fresh every day
And if you lookin for me lil' daddy you can find me in the A! A! A! A!

[Verse 4: Nelly (J.D.)]
I got the Retro 1's, uhh
(Then I bought the) 2's (and the) 3's (and the) 4's (uhh)
I had to order these, you can't find them in the store (nope)
Called up my stylist like, "Shorty send more"
And if you would please send 'em to me out on tour
(Uh-uh, uh-uh) They be here in a minute mayne
See I got that connect where I can damn near get like anythang
Plus all my hoes on 'em, then I'mma stroll on 'em
I call my hook-up at the store like "Put a hold on 'em"
Them Carolina number 9's matchin patent leather wristbands
Patent leather number 11's, we call 'em Space Jams
You in my space man, I'mma make you jump man
I'll make you jump, the jump, the jump jump man
See on my weekends, my J's play a part
I'm rockin these to the club and these to the park
I'm puttin these on now and these here tomorrow
A spare off in my car, just in case I catch a scar

[Hook][Hook: Johnta Austin]
Tell your friends, to get with my friends
And we can be friends, and do it all weekend
Smoke blunts, get drunk, do it all weekend
From Thursday to Friday to Saturday to Sunday

[Daz]
Well I was chillin' sittin', smokin' in my Escalade
Cadillac pimpin', lookin' for a escapade
I saw some bad body with a beautiful face
What it is ho, you ain't from around the way
You got everybody lookin' and ya know that
Hair right, outfit, ass so phat
On top of that baby girl know just how to throw that
Too fine for me to fight and try to hold back
I had to immediately hit her with some West Coast game
Cause uh, all these niggas screamin' what's yo' name
And uh, buyin' roses and the best champagne
She can see through the glass that yo' ass is lame
She cool, she ain't trippin' off no cash flow
Cause she went to school and still puff-puff-pass though
Right in my alley, as we sat there shootin' the shit
I broke it down, broke it down to the shorty like this

[Hook: Johnta Austin]
Tell your friends, to get with my friends
And we can be friends, and do it all weekend
Smoke blunts, get drunk, do it all weekend
From Thursday to Friday to Saturday to Sunday

[Daz]
I told the ho "You ain't had it 'til you had mine"
I'mma make you forget the nigga name of the last time
I'mma have you in my bed beggin' me for halftime
And after that we smoke-smoke and have some red wine
I can see it in her eye, she got the program
And plus she know she ain't dealin' with a poor man
I'm in the mood for some candles and some slow jams
A lot of niggas smooth but nigga I'm so down, and
(Girl I ain't playin' no games
I hope you're ready, for sure
I got the bubbly and a pound of that weed
And a pocket full of fetti, let's go
See all I want is some head and some pussy
And I'll tell ya, for sure
Girl I ain't playin' no games, I hope your ready)
{Is you ready?} (Let's go)

[Hook: Johnta Austin]

Like I know its just sex you want (you want)
I can't lie the sex is truly incredible (incredible)
And every part of your body is so edible (edible)
I get tears from just thinking bout it
But that ain't the reason why im stuck and can't let you go (let you go)
We got a serious serious bond (bond)
And when we kick it we have nothin but fun (but fun)
I feel a whole lot of L-O-V-E between you and me

None of them have ever made me say

You bad than a motherfucker, motherfucker
You bad than a motherfucker
What's it gonna take for me to get you?

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
She was bad than a motherfucker, sexy with a triple-X
Type of girl that need something nasty to keep the pillow wet
And I feel her stripping naked in the silhouette
Come a little closer baby girl cause I'm feeling it
She the hottest, super bad and exotic
(She got a gang of ass and god damn she got it)
Never seen her before, but I seen her when she walked in the door
God damn, I got to have it for sure
(The DJ playing my song and it won't be long
I put the macking in effect, try to get in her thong)
You gain some you lose some, me I'm one to choose from
I got game (baby girl, and I want some)
She the shit, and she know it
Pop a couple of bottles, let Diggy Daz overflow it
My emotions I'm showing, take time with the cutie
Tax it and watch me do my thing with the booty

[Hook]

[Bridge: Avery Storm]
There's some hoes in this house
When you seem them point them out
Get 'em on the dance floor, turn 'em out
Cause there's some hoes in this house

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
This is for them super bad bitches looking good in the club
Wanna smoke with a player, wanna drink on some bubb'
She looking like a lawyer, looking like a actress
Super bad model cause she's looking so attractive
(We got weed in the air, middle fingers up
Bitch on my side, drink in my cup
Niggas starting to sound like bitches, they need to quit
I'm on the corner posted with a bad ass bitch)
She looking good in them jeans, hat to match
She all up on the ballsack, how ill is that?
She a bad mamma jamma from New York to Savannah
From Miami to L.A., to the Bay to Atlanta

[Hook x2][Intro]
Yo, you ever be out and see somebody

You never would leave, you'd wanna stay, why?
'Coz I'm known for doin' my damn thing

Pump no gas liquid in this young fly mister

Shorty, if I ride wit you, that would be a nice picture
If somebody say cheese, they talkin' 'bout me like hey

No holla back, though I got a lotta that
I could have you in some True Religious, Louis this, Gucci that
Shake what she gave you, your momma would be proud of that
Once I get you back some, you ain't gon' know how to act

You on fire, oh I think I, oh I think I like ya
Boy, I think I, boy, I think I might just
Let you hold the Lambo, let you ride the Coupe
Spin rubberband banks, girl, tell me, tell me

I promise Bow won't bite, Bow will behave

Stays in the sweet tryina find somthin new
Custom ipods with the rhinestones
Nextel camara phones with all the hot ringtones
Light skin til black little PYT's
Boricua mami's that like to eat Mickey D's
Always into sumthin like NWA gota little bittie frame but home she dont play
You know a gyrl is the reason that a nigga wanna stunt
And im weak for em homie I ain't even gon front
See most young nigga's like em older not me spot they spot me like in the summer I run up hit them with

(Come and get it boy)Ha, ha, listen, you know I do it for the ladies
Lambourghini Moss and uh see
I done had my share with the right but um
Look there's something about you, baby
Got me going crazy and that's my lady, yeah, ha, ha

Look, it's like this girl got me going all out
I got a few sick days, yeah, I'ma call out
Scoop shorty, hit the mall then we ball out
Catch a movie, grab a bite then fall out

I got her spoiled wrotten
She keep her jaws droppin'
The latest wear she rockin'
Gotta couture poppin'
(Fresh)

And what's more shockin'
Them whores at the door knocking
Ain't worth a second in my G-shock when
She in them pumps, not them Reeboks kid

The only time we fight is on the wii boxin'
I don't even keep up with how many g's I spend
Usually I keep a safe with the key locked in
But she a new type, maybe a new wife

Maybe the one I settle with in a new life
I gotta see, it's moving fast right now
I needa have a conversation with Shad and Bow Wow
Cause ahh

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down
But you made me proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
Cause I never had no one love me like this

Like wha? Like this
Like wha? Like da,da,da,da, like this girl

I guess, I'm kinda open just sitting here hoping
That what we shared is more than a joke and
We can last like the great ones do
As long as our love for each other stays true

Look, I see the growth, we done both came a long way
Arguments here and there,fuss and fightin'
Just showing that we care can't nobody else compare
Start it over with another, neither one of us would dare

All she gotta do is holla and her baby will be there
Ain't a doubt about it in my mind that we a perfect pair
Can't think of anyone, that's how I wanna spend my years
Try my hardest not to hurt her

Hate to bring her to them tears
And I know just how it feel when I whisper in her ear
No, I let her drive a stick, she know how to work dem gears
Ain't gotta worry 'bout the chicks I meet during my career
Me going somewhere should be the last of her fears

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down
But you made me proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
Cause I never had no one love me like this

She's my L.O.V.E
Used to be scared of relationships but this one I can't deny
You my L.O.V.E, yeah, and when you see her
You see me for her, I ride or die like Ruff Ryders

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down
But you made me proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
Cause I never had no one love me like this[Bridge:]
