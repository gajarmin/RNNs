[Verse 1]
I wasn't brought up with a silver spoon in my pocket
Mama didn't raise no fool
They're telling em that I'm hot, I say "cool"
Get your facts straight, I am a Gomez, but no I don't know Selena
Not a rich kid, but I'm a boss bitch, drive my Toyota like it's a Bimmer
Carpool on that 405, two brothers and I got one sister
Right next to my dad with his head turned back, shotgun, never touched no trigger
When they see this cover girl, the place get nuts, mother's squirrel
I'ma let that line sink in for a minute while I'm visitin' another world
Blast off, I got a little bit of fuel in my jetpack
Travellin' to the moon when I get back
I'ma give it everything, tell em whenever they ring
That I mean it every time that they said that
Who they think they're talking to?
This my town they're walking through

[Pre-Hook]
Yes I might get down with a little red lipstick
But I bleed Dodger blue
Yes I might get down with a little red lipstick
But I bleed Dodger blue

[Hook]
Dodger blue, Dod-Dod, Dodger blue
Yes I might get down with a little red lipstick
But I bleed Dodger blue
Dodger blue, Dod-Dod, Dodger blue
Yes I might get down, down, Dod-Dod-Dod, Dodger blue

[Verse 2]
LA's all on my back, but the weight won't hurt me
New Jay's, doin' 2 a day, got Yasiel on my jersey
And I'm thick skinned, I wanna big win, I don't play the game to get bases
Was the first rapper on Kemosabe, I don't mean to pick favorites
Let me go right now, I don't wanna slow down, cause I put my soul in this mixtape
And when I get that crown, I'ma never put it down
So I'm gonna get a little bit of shit straight
Don't let the pretty face fool ya, I know I'm new to this game
I don't buy beats, I just run em, thank you 2 Chainz

[Hook (x2)][Hook: Becky G]
This must be some kinda joke
If you think you're my type (not my type)
Poof you're gone in a cloud of smoke
I just left swipe
Bye bye
I just left swipe

[Chorus:Fifth Harmony]
Left swipe dat!
Gotta gotta gotta swipe it left
Yeah!
Gotta Gotta Gotta swipe it left!
Left swipe dat!
Gotta gotta gotta swipe it left
That's that stuff I don't like so I gotta
Left swipe dat!

[Verse 1:Becky G]
Look at you, with your shirt off
Flexin'
You're buff but you puff
Hashtag perplexing
Yeah, you work out- you're in shape
Okay
I like the six pack abs, but not the six
Packs a day

[Verse 2:Harley Morenstein]
Came across this photo of this green-
Eyed hottie
Whole nine- pretty face, tight waist
Nice body
But I couldn't overlook one small fact:
She smokes like an old man at a race
Track

[Hook]
[Chorus]

[Verse 3:Grace Helbig]
Mr World Traveler, your trips look
Expensive
Sittin' on a mountain top lookin' all
Pensive
I was just about to ask, how's the air
Up there?
But based on this pic, guess you don't
Really care

[Verse 4:AlphaCat]
Lots a chicks in the pic not sure
Which one's you
Them cigarettes take y'all from 10s
To 2s
And one thing's true 'bout your whole
Crew-
None of you cigarellas gonna be my
Boo

[Bridge:Harley Morenstein, Grace Helbig, AlphaCat & KingBach]
Smoking with a tiger?
Left swipe dat!
While you're on a hang-glider?
Left swipe dat!
Smoking while acting healthy?
Left swipe dat!
Smoking all stealthy?
Left swipe dat!
Smoking with a duckface?
Left swipe dat!
At a monster truck race?
Left swipe dat
Smoking at the prom?
Left swipe dat!
Even in a photobomb?
Left swipe dat![Verse 1]
You're the one I wanna talk about, talk about
Had a few but you knock em out, knock em out
Might just let you meet my mama now, mama now
Might just let you lock it, lock it down

Cause I've been loving how you are with me, are with me
Ain't no fussing ain't no arguing, arguing
Every plane needs a pilot, pilot
Tell me baby who you're flying with?

Like ooh ah
Wanna, wanna be around you
Got me breaking breaking  all of my rules, oh
It's all the little things that you do
They got me like ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be loving so hard
When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be loving so hard

[Chorus]
We be loving, we be loving so hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
Ain't nobody love him like I love him
Ain't nobody steal him
Damn we be loving hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
I miss him when I'm holding him
Miss him when I'm kissing him
Damn we be loving hard

[Verse 2]
Tryna find, find the words to say, words to say
To describe what you mean to me, mean to me
Side by side like a yin and yang, yin and yang
Like to stay up to my Lil' Wayne

And it be hard, it be hard at times
But in the dark boy you are my light, are my light
The boom boom to my dynamite, dynamite
Baby you, you my ride or die

Like ooh ah, wanna, wanna be around you
Got me breaking, breaking all of my rules, oh
It's all the little things that you do
They got me like ooh

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus x2][Verse 1]
I don't know,  it's something about ya
Got me feelin' like I can't be without ya
Anytime someone mention your name
I be feelin' as if I'm around ya
Ain't no words to describe you baby
All I know is that you take me high
Can you tell that you drive me crazy
Cause I can't get you out my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up, think of you again
You're my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why

[Chorus]
You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror
Singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
Singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
Singing in the shower

[Verse 2]
All I want, all I need is your lovin'
Baby you make me hot like an oven
Since you came, you know I discovered
Baby I don't need no other
No, no, all I know
Only you got me feeling so
And you know that I got to have ya
And I don't plan to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
There ain't no guarantee
But I'll take chance on we
Baby let's take our time
(Singing in the shower)
And when the times get rough
There ain't no givin' up
Cause it just feel so right
(Singing in the shower)
Don't care what others say
If I got you, I'm straight
You'll bring my heart to life
Yeah

[Chorus][Intro: Becky G]
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 1: Becky G]
Yo, I run this, I smash it
Like my bass real hard, boom-bastic
Speed race baby, I'm a lot faster
Cause trouble, never listen to my master
New Benz all black, from Malaysia
Can't drive, but my mama don't care yup
To the top, I'm a take it to the ceiling
I'm on the moon but I feel the sun beaming
I'm so dope like ooh la la
So so fly like a helicopter
Sup to the hood and the homies on the block
Doin' it big, ya you know, what's up

Some come and try to say I'm a problem
So crazy, gotta put 'em in an asylum
Some come and try to say I'm a problem
Ha, solve it

[Hook: Becky G]

Don't have to tell me, I already know
They all want me

[Verse 2: Will.I.Am]
Yo, yo, yo

I can see the future, no optics
More androids, robotics

Beam up hot chicks like I'm Spock
They be chillin' in my cockpit, my spaceship got exotic
One be trippin', come n' whip, hypnotic, they be talking 'bout ooh la la
Let's go far, way past them stars
We don't give a -, let's go to Mars

Ay, yo
I'm just tryna get it poppin'
I wanna be the first dude to love a martian
She love a man, cut the swag that I'm droppin'
I kill the game til it's chillin' in the coffin
When I start, there ain't no stoppin'

Yo, yo
Yo, yo
Yo, yo
Yo, yo

Don't be actin' like

I'm one of a kind, got everybody in love
And I don't have to try, I just do what I does

Everybody know Juicy always turnt up
Tour bus smoked out, everybody purped up
9 to 5 grind and got the whole hood worked up
Ain't getting money then you better get your work up
Pull up in a Porsche drunk, back seat chauffeur
Taylor Gang in here, everybody know us
Hundred bottles, and there's more coming
Same shit tomorrow night, all I know is stunting
20 shot of Jager, I don't do chasers
White boy wasted, smoking out the vaper
Party with your girl, sweating out my pores
Becky so good, I had to thank the Lord
She won my heart, in the club she go hard
Shake her ass and titties, I threw my card
Love California girls like David Lee Roth
You tell em that you love em
I say, 'Take it off'

[Hook: Ke$ha]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms

Ball so hard, it's not a game to us
Pull up in the club throwing Taylor's up
Spending cause money ain't a thing to us
But for the famous stuff, I wasn't the one to play with
Party all night, getting drunk and raging
Ball so hard, I think I'm gonna be sick
Wake up, roll a joint and do it all again
Yeah, I like to party
Got a cute face and I like your body
You leave sober and you might be sorry
Pour another shot then light the Marley
And what goes down, don't bring it up
Tell them broke niggas they can hang it up
Take six shots, feels like we're dying
Hit this once, feels like you're flying

[Hook: Ke$ha]

You tryna take my shine, shine?
Step back, bye bye

Every time that I jump on the stage
Oh, you like it when I'm in your face?
And if you don't, man, whatcha gonna say?

[Hook: Ke$ha]
Looking for some trouble tonight (yeah)

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

[Verse 1: Becky G]
Yo, first grade, Oak street elementary
A few blocks from the Inglewood cemetery
I lived through hard times, according to my memory
Then I learned to rhyme like I’m reading off the dictionary
I still walk to the Kelso Market
Even though I get to walk them red carpets
My family lived in my grandpa’s garage
So I started working just to help out my pops
It all started when my grandpa crossed over
Now one day I'mma be a crossover
Right now it’s just who is that girl?
But one day I'mma be all around the world
I still get grounded, always stay grounded
Still do chores even when I’m on tour
One thing’s for sure, I'mma always be me
That West Side Becky, Becky G

I won’t stop till I get to the top

Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

[Verse 2: Becky G]
Yo what you know about the in and out lines
And what you know about that 4×5 drive
My life is changing quickly right before my eyes
It hits me every time that I’m on Hollywood divine
If you wanna date me, you gotta ask my Daddy
And my 30 uncles, you can meet them in an alley!
And one day I'mma bring home a Grammy
But no matter what I’ll be bringing home randies
Donuts, so what, holler when you see me
I’m still the same B, even when I’m on TV
Still rocking Js with my diamonds and pearls
You can take me out the hood, but not the hood out of the girl
Yes I love sushi, love my calamari
But ain't no better chef than my very own mommy
If you can’t catch me warming in my barrio
I’m with my abuelitas praying the Rosario
Inglewood, Inglewood, Inglewood

[Hook:]
I won’t stop till I get to the top

Que tu boca me ha loca
Que quiero tenerte y robarte un beso
Que te miro y suspiro
Y que en cada latido voy sintiéndote un poco más
Ya no puedo dar marcha atrás

Cuando quieras me pego y tú pide y me dejo
No puedo con esto
Quiero entrar en el juego sin reglas ni peros
Y en tus brazos enloquecer
Hasta ver el amanecer-eh-er

[Pre-Chorus: Thalía]
Si como tú no hay dos
Que prenda el fuego dentro de mí
Just wanna feel you tonight

Me gusta como erizas mi piel

Stop all the talking
Let your actions speak (ah ha)
En este mundo no hay para mi someone like you
Make my heart skip a beat

And I think about you a lot
Solo tú y yo is what I dream about
I'm so caught up
Got my head in the clouds
Baby, I can't stop

What's good? What's up? Oh, baby, tell me the truth
You feeling me; oh, boy, and I'm feeling you
Don't deny it; don't fight it
Dame tu amor, I want it
You need to know you got me stuck like glue, boy

And I'm thick skinned, I wanna big win, I don't play the game to get bases
Was the first rapper on Kemosabe, I don't mean to pick favorites
Let me go right now, I don't wanna slow down, cause I put my soul in this mixtape
And when I get that crown, I'ma never put it down
So I'm gonna get a little bit of shit straight
Don't let the pretty face fool ya, I know I'm new to this game
I don't buy beats, I just run em, thank you 2 Chainz

[Hook (x2)][Verse 1]
Me-me-me-me-me
That's all you ever talk about
Me-me-me-me-me
Sick of when you scream and shout
Me-me-me-me-me
So baby go and run your mouth
R-r-run your mouth
R-r-run your mouth
I-I-I-I-I
I try and show you that I'm there
I-I-I-I-I
I end up ripping out my hair
Why-I-I-I-I
Do I even wanna care?
W-w-wanna care
Wanna, care, care

[Chorus]
I can't believe
That this is what it's come to
I've held it in
But it's time you know the truth
Excuse my rude
But I really [...] hate you
I never thought I'd be the one
To fall for it
And let you in
To mess it up, once again
I'm over it, so here it is
Excuse my rude
But I really [...] hate you

[Verse 2]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
This isn't how it was before
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Now I'm the girl you can't ignore
Now-wow-wow-wow-wow
I'm brave enough to say no more
No more, no more, n-n-n-n-nor more, more
Do-woe-woe-woe-woe
You even want to understand
Do-woe-woe-woe-woe
You think you're still in command
Do-woe-woe-woe-won't
You see I got the upper hand
Oh-oh-oh-oh...

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Becky G]
They say hate is a strong word
But I got that urge
Treat me like a waiter
So you better get served
With that Becky G special
I'm shaking your credentials
Acting like a Benz
But to me you just a rental
Keep it simple
It's not about the cars acting hard
It's too easy
Boy, you gotta please me
Believe me
So I hit you on the telly when I'm in your areay next Nevuary

[Chorus][Hook: Becky G]
This must be some kinda joke
If you think you're my type (not my type)
Poof you're gone in a cloud of smoke
I just left swipe
Bye bye
I just left swipe

[Chorus:Fifth Harmony]
Left swipe dat!
Gotta gotta gotta swipe it left
Yeah!
Gotta Gotta Gotta swipe it left!
Left swipe dat!
Gotta gotta gotta swipe it left
That's that stuff I don't like so I gotta
Left swipe dat!

[Verse 1:Becky G]
Look at you, with your shirt off
Flexin'
You're buff but you puff
Hashtag perplexing
Yeah, you work out- you're in shape
Okay
I like the six pack abs, but not the six
Packs a day

[Verse 2:Harley Morenstein]
Came across this photo of this green-
Eyed hottie
Whole nine- pretty face, tight waist
Nice body
But I couldn't overlook one small fact:
She smokes like an old man at a race
Track

[Hook]
[Chorus]

[Verse 3:Grace Helbig]
Mr World Traveler, your trips look
Expensive
Sittin' on a mountain top lookin' all
Pensive
I was just about to ask, how's the air
Up there?
But based on this pic, guess you don't
Really care

[Verse 4:AlphaCat]
Lots a chicks in the pic not sure
Which one's you
Them cigarettes take y'all from 10s
To 2s
And one thing's true 'bout your whole
Crew-
None of you cigarellas gonna be my
Boo

[Bridge:Harley Morenstein, Grace Helbig, AlphaCat & KingBach]
Smoking with a tiger?
Left swipe dat!
While you're on a hang-glider?
Left swipe dat!
Smoking while acting healthy?
Left swipe dat!
Smoking all stealthy?
Left swipe dat!
Smoking with a duckface?
Left swipe dat!
At a monster truck race?
Left swipe dat
Smoking at the prom?
Left swipe dat!
Even in a photobomb?
Left swipe dat![ Verse 1: ]
I've seen the inside of half a dozen studios
Live on the microphone
I know about half a dozen hoolio's
California girl, I'm feeling right at home
I've seen a person, lie with a smile on
I'm on an uphill battle, a mile long
But I respect everyone who laid bricks down
For me to stomp my converse kicks round
I see you Left Eye, I feel you right now
I know you, wouldn't never put this mic down
You left to soon but everybody gotta fall
I hope you hear me every time I'm singing waterfalls
You know that I'm an mc right?
Never would have been without mc light
And Lauren Hill sang and played the guitar
I used to listen and dream one day I'd get far
I'm too young to be a queen but I respect Latifah
And if you're listening I hope one day I get to meet ya
Cause I act too, I write screenplays
And rock loud when I'm listening to Green Day
I love Michael, I still can't believe it
And when I act dead, mamma tells me beat it
And Christina taught me how to belt the notes out
And Lil mama win hard what you know about
Everybody I was influenced by
Every star was a fan just like you and I
So put you're hands up like you about to fight the sky
I wanna see the whole word put your lighters high

[ Hook: ]
Sky's filled with lighters
Ooooh oooh
The sky's filled with lighters
Ooooh oooh [x2]

[ Verse 2: ]
I see the night time sky glowing right now
Just take it in
And I respect everyone that's going right now
That's what it takes to win
I see you Ke$ha, I can't even lie
When you and Luke make a track, I turn my speakers high
Nicki remind the females it's okay to rap
And I'm a low key fan, I'm just waiting back
And Karmin show everyone what you do
If you post the right video's on youtube
Rebecca Black got a hundred million hits
And I don't curse but damn that's the shi...
And it's Saturday, so no school
Katy Perry made teenage dream so cool
I don't understand this game, that's why I never hate
It only hurts people, I like to celebrate
And I would say thank you if I knew Bruno Mars
Cause I'm borrowing his hook again and 2 more bars
Slim, I'm a fan, you made history
Now put your lighters in the air
And sing with me

[ Hook: ]
The sky's filled with lighters
Oooooh ooooh
Sky's filled with lighters
Ooooooh oooooh [x5][Verse 1]
You're the one I wanna talk about, talk about
Had a few but you knock em out, knock em out
Might just let you meet my mama now, mama now
Might just let you lock it, lock it down

Cause I've been loving how you are with me, are with me
Ain't no fussing ain't no arguing, arguing
Every plane needs a pilot, pilot
Tell me baby who you're flying with?

Like ooh ah
Wanna, wanna be around you
Got me breaking breaking  all of my rules, oh
It's all the little things that you do
They got me like ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be loving so hard
When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be loving so hard

[Chorus]
We be loving, we be loving so hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
Ain't nobody love him like I love him
Ain't nobody steal him
Damn we be loving hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
I miss him when I'm holding him
Miss him when I'm kissing him
Damn we be loving hard

[Verse 2]
Tryna find, find the words to say, words to say
To describe what you mean to me, mean to me
Side by side like a yin and yang, yin and yang
Like to stay up to my Lil' Wayne

And it be hard, it be hard at times
But in the dark boy you are my light, are my light
The boom boom to my dynamite, dynamite
Baby you, you my ride or die

Like ooh ah, wanna, wanna be around you
Got me breaking, breaking all of my rules, oh
It's all the little things that you do
They got me like ooh

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus x2][Hook:]
Oh oh oh lovin' lovin' what you do
Oh oh oh lovin' lovin' what you do
Oh oh oh lovin' lovin' what you do
Oh oh oh lovin' lovin' what you do

[Verse 1:]
I could do this all day
Long as you by my side
We don't care what they say
Everything will be alright
Always up never down
Every time you around
Whenever you say my name
Oh I love the way it sound
I've been knowing you so long
And I never question you
You ain't never did me wrong
Always know what to do
Pick me up when I'm down
All I need is you around
Don't you love the way that that sounds baby?

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Call me when you're parked outside
I'll come running up to you
Open the door to your ride
Doing things the gentleman do
Suit and tie maybe blue
No one do what my baby do
A dozen roses just for me
Ow I'm lucky as can be
He notice all little things
Checking up every day
Ow I'm loving that you care
When you look at me that way
Pulling up valet
Court side Laker Game
It's like every day is my birthday yeah

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Two peas in a pod
Got the key to my lock
You're the beat to my heart
You're the road on my rock
All I have to say
Is that I'm loving I'm loving
I'm loving, I'm loving you

[Hook]

Close your eyes and count to three
Open, voila, so spectacular
I even got magic to make the haters disappear

They’re like my special potion
So when I start to rap them
The whole track starts turning golden
And now I’m through
It’s the end of verse two
Like bipadee bopidee doo

[Hook: Austin Mahone]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic baby)

Watch me take it up, then I break it down
I don’t play sports, but it’s a touchdown
I don’t blend in, I-I’m a black sheep
And even then, ha, they still follow me
I rock the race stripes, go, go and check my closet
Never share the guap, go, go and check my wallet
I’m a comet heading this planet
Sitting on the throne, and these haters can’t stand it

[ Hook: ]
DJ, play my song on the radio
Lift me up when I’m feeling low
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah
DJ, spin it back
If you feeling me
The 808 track is all I need
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah

[ Verse 2: ]
Now watch me do my thing, do my thing out on the stage
I become an animal, go and put me in a cage
I’m a beast, I’m a beast
Why they let me off my leash
No you can’t tame me, in this jungle of concrete
I’m a creature, I ain’t lying
Not a cheater, I’m a lioness
They saying that I’m the best
And I ain’t drop an album yet
I got them waiting
Anticipating
They losing patience
My music is vaccination for all my loyal patients

( Chorus )

Mic check one two baby!
Fresh off the blizzy, New Adidas track suit
White, green, and red stripes
I might get a tattoo
I’m so Mejico, No pavement
Dirt roads I walked those and I finally made it
This is for my grandfather who came
Without a penny now I’m rapin ‘bout my shoe game
Let me check myself, everybody need that
Grandma listen to my records but she doesn’t speak that
I’ve seen poverty, I know how it feels
To change the life of a kid with some big wheels
Just like Santa Claus, In Jalisco
Givin presents to these kid-no tree though
I do it for my roots, and I ain’t talkin hair
Can’t drive into the USA so we walkin there
I love my heritage, I’m so irrelevant
New Vicente Fernandez I’m blarin it
Estephan Lopez, George and Jenifer
I’m so focused
I speak it fluently, I might rap in it
Until then, Ha
It’s a wrap ain’t it

[ Hook: ]
Owww, Yeah
It just feels good
Turn that music up
It just feels good
Turn that music up baby
It just feels good
Asi, Asi – C’mon Hahahaa

[ Verse 2: ]
And now my family live in Inglewood, there’s a whole block of us
I signed my deal and took the doc to a taco truck
That’s just who I am, Viva Vismo
I’m on TV now, Telemundo!
See my dad’s daddy work his finger to the bone
For less than I made and so I’m bringin that home
Never goin broke again, we lived that
Dollar menu dinners for my family won’t miss that
And when I touch down, to the motherland
If I can’t cry cuz I’m happy that my mother can
So I pay my respect to the fallen ones
Selena was a star, Can’t believe they call me one
Channel Pancho Villa Wen, I'm tryna conquer
I know we saw the white light, you is blanca
I’d rather die on my feet in this battle ground
Then live one day on my knees, How that sound?
I’m bringin everything I know to the masses
Tequila shots, Raise your glasses
Not for me, though, a bag full of Fanta
Light a candle on the window sill for the Hanta

[ Hook: ]
Owwww, Yeah, C’mon
It just feels good
Turn that music up
It just feels good
Turn that music up baby
It just feels good
Asi, Asi, C’mon, C’mon

Latinos stand up![ Verse 1: Cody Simpson ]
Lately I got this feeling
I don't know what's the meaning
But I know it's strong
And it's over you
All I want is to be home with you
Oh ooh oh
I'm coming right back
Ho-ome
Livin' without you is a
Noo Noo
I'm coming right back
Ho-ome

[ Hook: Cody Simpson ]
I wish you were here
Yeah, I wish you were here
Music is better
And lights are brighter when you are near
Am I making it clear?
The music is better
And right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here

[ Verse 2: Cody Simpson ]
Every night
A different city
Bright lights, should be pretty
But they can't compare, no
To the light from you
All I want right now is to be home with you
Oh ooh oh
I'm coming right back
Ho-ome
Livin' without you is a
Noo Noo
I'm coming right back
Ho-ome

[ Repeat Hook ]

Right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here

[ Verse 3: Becky G ]
I can't wait 'til you come back home
I know it's late, hoped you were by the phone
It so hard gettin' by all alone
So call me back, leave a message at the tone
I know, you know, I know we can make it by
It's been too long since I've looked into your eyes
And I'm waitin', so hurry back
Bring the shine boy
You better follow the path
Car, bus, train, go and get a cab
Or just fly here- Jet pack
Roger that, do you copy?
I was a puzzle piece but you solved me
Our future, I see it so clear
And right now...

[ Repeat Hook ]

Right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here
