[Verse 1]
I hate those filthy fuckin' monkeys
And the features that they share with simians
Disgusting junkies, welfare recipients
They're livin' off of someone's money who pays tax and has a life
While these black bitches' stomachs stay fat with parasites
And they have to have a pipe to relax on average nights
So their bastard bratty tykes all act like savage types
It's the legacy of black and Spanish guys
Vagrancy and general complacency of dads who have no wives
Police should beat their fuckin' skulls in with magnum lights
Illegitimate illiterate blacks should have no rights
Cause they go from having lives to having life
And I pay to feed their appetites and give them TVs with satellites
Those theivin' stealin' dirty fuckin' heathens dealing dope need to steal a boat
Sail their monkey asses back to Africa
And seal the coast with giant gates made of steel and bolts
So we can try and save the decent white god-fearing folk

[Hook]
And I got strangers moving in in my own backyard
Hometown battlefield, times is hard
Crime is risin' on my horizon
And it's gettin' mighty hard for folks to find a job
A lot of folks say that the times is changing
But the more things change the more they stay the same
And I don't know where I'm gonna go, I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Don't hand me your ethics, discredit this as rude hard speech
Cause I'm not anti-Semitic, Jews are cheap
With every breath they're breathing through large beaks
They're telling more fibs and squeezing four kids into two car seats
What a waste of white skin, heartbeats, and faces like men
Nigger lovers who treat the beast as if the ape was like them
They killed the savior Christ and denied that he was God's seed
It doesn't come as a surprise they'd meet the Nazis
I'd live to see the day that Rabbis decree their cocks be clipped at birth
'Til there ain't a Jewish dick that works
We should take care of the rich half first on Hanukkah
And smother out their breath and words with yarmulkes
'Til they turn to vomiters choking on their Manischewitz
Menorahs to the foreheads would make some handy weapons
Cause there's no room for clandestine Goldblooms, Blatts, and Bergs
We'll just wipe em off the map of earth

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know who probably hurts us most
Those sneaky guys with chinky eyes and the turban folks
Dot-heads who settle on our urban coast
I wish that they would drop dead, buying up convenience stores and restaurants
Either or they're sneaking in, I'm tired of the lenient laws
Treatin' them like real Americans when after all
These rice eating heathens even eat their cats and dogs
And that's because they're misers, fuckin' cabbies in a hurry
Covered in the stench of curry, and they're awful drivers
The law provides us with no means of protection
Not even a weapon to stop the evil conception
And my people are threatened by the rate at which they multiply
Alarming enough to make the true patriots' pulses high
Cultist like worship, Hindu and Buddhist rituals
Our lord Christ would turn in his grave due to his principles
The way they're taking bread from the truly blessed sons
I'd have to say the only good brown and yellow folks are dead ones

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I'd like to add lastly, AIDS ain't a disease
We should take tainted IVs and jam up the pillow-bitin' fags' ass cheeks
And dykes are twice as bad what kinda woman doesn't like to shag
No dick for those chicks, what kinda life is that?
We got marches fightin' for the rights of drag queens and queers
Whose sperm's armed like germ farms breeding fear
The fucking fairies need brassieres, high heels, and dick
The stuff's so scary to even hear it I'm feeling sick
Your body parts got a right, feel, and fit, silly fairy
Nobody wants fags and dykes to join the military
We'd be better off killing every bitchy lesbian
And wimpy feminine man, than to let them in
Then again I know it seems like I'm the devil's rotten henchman
But no one on this earth loves all of God's inventions
Not to mention, I got a date to try and talk with Satan
And lots of tension, cause I'm late for my inauguration

[Beat stops]

[Man talking]
Right this way, Governor Bush[Verse 1: L-Fudge]
I metamorph phrases to glaciers
Have 'em come together in liquid stages
Then turn down the temperature and have 'em frozen into a solid foundation
Now added to that this well produced amazement
The crash is enough, to have the world tipped off it's axis a notch
It'll take the likes of, Jedi Minds to construct new longitude lines
In order to get around but now, you're askin' for too much
When mines put together
I'm like an alternative source of energy like, electricity generators
Separators of the wack rap, to the world reknownst individuals
Played in deuce parts life's nara-rators
Rhyme gladiators, is what we're referred as
Food for thoughts tooken offa ya plate instead you're served trash
Ikon and Logic serve as my accomplices
And bring our own form of trinity to show y'all onto this
Rhyme patterns come across as astonishing
So I have all right to feel myself to the point of genetalial fondlin'

[Hook]
We the three emcees that rock that shit
Pick your 12 inch up and knock that shit
"Louis Logic, L-L-Fudge, Ikon the verbal hologram"

[Verse 2: Louis Logic]
I spread around me a viral infectious faculties
Applied chiropractically so rappers cannot come back to me
Simply outta respect, or suffer the consequence
The effect of which is that of absent father neglect
Wreakin' havoc, on egos speakin' magic
Castin' the curse on fashion emcees for region fabric
Send 'em wandering through the labyrinth
As far as cuttin' careers short on mics
I'm what the NYPD is to entrapment
The epitome of half-bent, yet schooled
Engineers peep the structure of my mind
Now they wonder how the math went
L was made to ascend, which is evident by my descent
Spreadin' east to west like European settlements
Sequence, but even, I'm captured
Self destructive explosive devices react before my mind is ever mastered
Which makes me a Trojan horse of sorts
Draining your plasma until your rhythm section hardly contorts
My stats in the orators sport
Draw more foolish queries, than the Warren Report
And the single bullet theory

Hook (x2)

[Verse 3: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
You fuck with me and won't survive
Ikon been live since eighty five
Monosyllabic havoc that's tragic will crystallize
Hit them guys, in they eyes with fuckin' shrapnel
Bomb they castle, set fire unto they chapel
Wrap my lasso, 'round rappers who wanna battle
Hologram with two bare hands crush you to gravel
Evil raps'll, reverse time and bring diseases
Christians will worship Allah and Muslims will worship Jesus
Kill all ya leaders, with my savage lyrical thesis
Rip out my fuckin' heart and eat it before I'm defeated
The one who's seated, on the throne within a forcefield
Ya'll get tossed and feel lost like Holden Caulfield
Raw deal, rappers decipher that schism
Followed Solomon and prodded him at ya baptism

[Hook]"And then 4 months down the road the idiot gear kicks in
And I ask about the ex-boyfriend which
As we all know is a really dumb move but you know how it is --
You don't want to know, but you just have to know, right?
You know, stupid guy bullshit."

[Louis Logic]
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls:
In this corner quivering in the white trunks
We have the unsuspecting boyfriend facing up to the champion
His well-seasoned girlfriend
The three knockdown rule is in full effect

[Verse 1]
Ding Ding
That's the sound of curiousity peaking like cops that pat you down
Boyfriends probably seeking the dirt on the skirt as if he's deep in the earth
Like who had reached in the shirt and who was sleeping with her, but hey --
She's only human and probably only doing the dude who she loves most
So you know who she's screwing
But while you're lying there spooning assuming life is just all good
You indavertently missed the size of the falsehood
Living life in a small hood you probably collide
With lots of the guys who used to climb on top of your wife
So it's not a surprise you're asking the stupidest questions:
'Who was the best in the sack?' and 'How many dudes have you slept with?'
But the chance is, you didn't want them answers
And can't live with it she used to be just a dancer
Making the fast tips you would stuff her pants with
And fast as mass transit she thought you were romantic

[Hook]
I'm so glad we met (hey shorty)
Come on girl try to be patient, I know I'm a pain in the ass
But your ex-boyfriend has me stressed (back off dude)
And all of the sex stuff should just remain in the past
But we can't get married yet, (no we can't get married yet)
It isn't just that its greener, its also the length of the grass
But somehow you keep on running to me -- and we keep living in fear of the idiot gear

[Verse 2]
Right about this time, most of y'all are just wishin that this was fiction
And itchin to ask your chick if your dick isn't a depiction
Of fitting inside a stitching when you're sewing it up
And to think that most of this stuff is just over a fuck
I know what you're thinking, we've all grown up with women
And living without em seems like its harder than living with em
But if you hit em, you'll probably end up living in prison fellas
Then you'll be someone's bitch -- I hope your girlfriend isn't jealous
This cinderella shit is totally irrelevant
You'll never get a girl older than 7 thats been celibate
Cause every chick has been around the block with a guy or ten
And guys are sensitive, its better that you lie to them
Even the violent men who's dressed up in street clothes
With stilettos and heat knows they got delicate egos
If she chose to tell you all persons with whom
She put in work in the room, it would burst your balloon

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Looking at your sweetest snapshot, that's when you start to wonder
About the backdrop of her other lovers
When you discover another flick of her hidden up under there
Dressed in summer wear, with her ex giving her bunny ears
And no one wants to share their chick with last guy
To get rid of the bad vibes you figured you ask why
Her past life is still chilling in the picture frame
She'd probably forget his name if the dick's the same
Which is lame, but for some dumb reason
The last bum seeps into your dreams and you become unseasoned
Then one evening, you build up the heart to ask her
Disaster -- with your lungs breathin hard as asthma
And after she breaks down and tells you the truth
It leads to a fight and she's yelling at you
And I'm convinced of this: being your queen's only king
Yo man see Louis right -- ignorance is bliss

[Hook]

Oh what's a guy to do

Now listen to me papi
You're all fucking idiots
How do you like them apples?

"You know what I don't think we need to do the thing
Where we tell each other everything ..."Yeah, Vinnie Paz baby
2 G baby
Army of the Pharoahs
All that good shit

[Ikon the Hologram]
Yo, yo
The lawnmower man smashes
Through your skull with battle axes
We whip asses, with adjante daggers
That slashes
Crushing opposition like we was fascists
Stigmata and four gashes
We bashes, the faggots who can't attack it right
Take they sternum and then turn them into my acolytes
That's the sight of blood that make a child stop
That's the rights of thugs that keep it wild hot
I hate you, say to pray to a heavenly father
It's fatal, like a NATO military armada
We hotter, warriors from Atlantis
Couldn't understand how raw the Hologram is
The mantis who use the flame rod
Cause y'all couldn't physically bruise the name God

[Diamondback]
Yo the technique, detrimental to your immune
Leave you in the dust, let y'all niggas choke on fumes
It's the tight mikes, aerodynamic, gigantic
The shadow I cast is dominant, royal highness
North Philly's own home-grown cham-pion
Purposely remainin' unknown until shown
Cold as stone, the stage, my home away from home
I, prefer to leave these cloned niggas alone
Buildin' a home for lost MC's gone wrong
Feel the pressure when my team come on strong, it's QD

[Hook repeat 2x]
*Stoupe scratches*
Never try to duplicate the skills executed
But can't the skill execute this right
Listen up y'all suckas to what I say
Breakin out an unstoppable...

[Jus Allah]
Megatraum is fucking monstrous
Hoppin' out of Lake Loch Ness
Every motherfucker in range is left top-less
Quell my metropolis, like shit's cop-less
Y'all cock-less, we stuff y'all in boxes
For stuffed pockets, yo my thugs is thick
Thug'll diss em, when we gotta put a slug in your bitch
Splatter your dame, Pharoahs we shatter your brain
'Till a nigga's salary change to lateral game
Like Calgary Flames, puttin' fire on ice
Put me in hell, for puttin' four nails in Christ

[Louis Logic]
I'm like Billy Goat Gruff under the bridge at Governor Ridge
Waitin' to knock heads off, I'm a mean son-of-a-bitch
With an itch to misbehave and wave a switchblade
In front of your face so close to leave your whiskers shaved
To disengage, or rip the pages from your notepad
And shove 'em up the hole between your lower back and gonads
The only way your rhymes would be the shit
You need to read a script on playin' gay cause you cats could eat a dick
Servin' sucka MC's a fifth of the drunken stylin'
Rippin' M-I-C's like a pub in Dublin, Ireland

[Hook]

[B.A. Barakus]
Hey yo I got a fetish, to see flesh rip
When my Tek spits, breaking the bone where ya'll chest is
I dare a nigga to try and battle
I'll put the sweat in your palms when you swallow your adam's apple
Eat MC's like Chupacabra was eating cattle
Defeat disease with palabras, frequently battle
I make the hardest man fall back and start to squeal
Haul a fifth to his face, taste the steel
This why I got pro deep and stay ruthless
You useless, fuck with us and leave toothless
We're often known as psycho-drama dispensors
Paralyze niggas then put 'em in trauma centers[Verse 1:Celph Titled]
Straight out the red depths of Hell bringin' them plagues and diseases
I walk on water with my own two feet nigga, FUCK JESUS!
Celph Titled's a God with many followers
Who's sick enough to choke a pitbull with his own dog collar
I rep the NYC, fuck bitches and sip Remy
Pack more toast than Denny's and conduct symphonies
You fuckin' with me, you won't live to see tomorrow, faggot!
I keep it gangsta, storin' bodies in a dusty attic
You can't talk 'cuz of the duct tape you fuck face
The Demigodz from Chrome Depot blazin' with .38's
My clique is famous for the way we spit and rock flows
Leave the spot blown and send bitch-niggas to casa carajo

[Verse 2:One Two]
Beware! Emcees out there, drop ya mics
Your talkin might result in the loss of life
And also might, known to crush blocks of ice
The spot it bright, 'til the point you lost ya sight
Cuz I'm startin fights, like that bully in class
Sayin, "When the bell rings bitch, I'm kickin your ass!!"
I spit at stage shows where herbs and weirdos
Screamin "Oh No" like Nate, Mos Def, and Pharoahe
It's a rare flow, put your cameras on zoom
Cuz it's tight like all the Klumps crammed in a small room

[Verse 3:L-Fudge]
Fudge is the shit, been busy puttin cups to my lips
Gettin it outta me, gave the weed a couple of hits
Mary Jane lately, grew some succulent tits
But everybody's hittin it, ended up dumpin that bitch
Mastered the art of reverse physcology
Gimme a minute with a chick and she'll exchange a suck for a lick
Broke nigga - give bartenders a buck for a tip
Take a sip and give it back say, "spruce it up a tidbit"

[Verse 4:Spin 4th]
Who in the fuck?! Rappers hidin under they trucks
Jumpin through windows, actin like lightning just struck
Holdin the do', cuttin they 'fros, wearin disguises
Exercising, puttin on weight, increasing sizes
Packin they tools and rollin in schools learnin dialect
Ebonics, that ain't workin no more, we need some bias shit
Yaggfu, Demigodz alliance
We colossal like Paul Bunyan and Jolly Green Giant

[Verse 5:Metropolis]
Yo I'm that fly gringo that chicks love to deep throat
With tracks so hot, you'll pass out from heat strokes
I beat foes on both west and east coasts
The freak hoes are rhymin on Luke's Peep Show
I'll crush ya ego, embarass you in ya home town
So forget the fame, you won't wanna be known now
I throw down with you half-ass rappers
And stuff your garbage rhymes inside trash compactors

[Verse 6:Louis Logic]
I'm a Demigod, what'd you expect? From a man
Who met Mother Nature, looked under her dress and wasn't impressed
The same stupid son of a bitch who doesn't respect
The Angel of Death's request when he comes to collect
Run in and check, my cassette - it's a slight chance
You might see, demons escapin from in the deck, and now that I...
[Sweet Jesus, please see us through this]
[I ain't tryna die over a beef with Lewis!]
But when I increase the rudeness of my evil music
It leaves the stupid, people skewered and leaks ya fluids
Into the streets and sewers, if by chance God sees me do it
Should shoot a big hole down to Hell and lead me to it

[Verse 7:Open Mic]
My microphone of omens dismantles opponents components
In moments leaving you and your cipher with my condolence
When I'm heated to max, you'll be sufferin' from repeated attacks
Defeated you cats with fatter tracks, faggots collapse
When they be hearin' collabs over the wax
Like subway rats we walk on underground tracks
I've come to an overstandin' that you lack in what I'm excellin' in
Professional at propellin' adrenaline
In fact, Open Mic attacks in stereo sound
Pull out my dick and I'll piss all on your burial ground
You better not clown or ever try to fuck with my committee
Cuz the Demigodz are comin' like a storm to your city

[Verse 8:Rise]
Yo we could go to war right now, go call ya brethren
Man the fight's on, I'll see you in Hell - from Heaven
Reppin everything I write tight, said it for a long time
I'm great in my eyes, I'm a legend in my own mind
Applause after your set? That wasn't respect
The crowd ain't happy you wreck, they happy you left
They mad upset, pissed that they came for you rhymin
They barely survived your set, families huggin and cryin
Don't come back, the rap competition's gettin hurt up
Beat within an inch of ya life, and then an inch further
Been heard of, this crew takin over this art
Ahead of you in skill, flow, and popularity charts

[Verse 9:Motive]
Mo'; known to flip plus the skill be sick
The type of cat that show his dick before he spit
I'll rush ya crew, but nigga fuck the rules
With trust ya lose, anything I touch I bruise
Now with Demigodz, I battle with any squad
I spit plenty bars, plus ball like Penny Har'
So if you thinkin of stick this man for the dividends
Catch a quick two bullet blaze in ya abdomen

[Verse 10:Esoteric]
Yo, lemme show these cats what rockin a mic's about
I'll put ya life in doubt like the biker scout, wipin' out
You're a bitch, the reason why your strikin out's
Cuz, girls who get with you think they're dykin out
You backpackers home typin out, a verse for ya title bout
While I'm in a Lambroghini with James Gandolfini
Rappers try to be me but they can't get my look down
My bumpy knuckles leave this industry shook down
When I rhyme, I'm so ahead of my time
That if we battled at 10, get there by 20 at 9
I'm as heavy as Spawn, Esoteric savage B
I'll spit bars at rappers like a chocolate factory

[Vese 11:Jabber Jaw]
Yo whatchu known for? Killin rappers off like a famine
The Last Standing, like Bruce Lee's daughter Shannon
It took some time plannin but I'm finally here
Just droppin knowledge on ya brain, and puttin flavor in ya ear
At the start of my career, people said they wasn't feelin me
But now everybody think's I'm Keith Murray's 'Mini-Me'
A critically acclaimed harsh heartbreaker
Got into a slugfest and broke out the salt shaker

[Verse 12:Apathy]
Can't you see my mental is creating verbal force fields?
Elevating spiritual, my physical is more real
Reality is 99% perception mostly
Mag-NIFICENT, my MISSILES SENT
Heat-seeking bombs DETONATING, I'm invading-VADING
The space station, face me, A-P A-T H-E-T-I-C (I-C)
Now that the light has come to meeee!!
Owww, the tornado, natural disaster, lacerating rappers
Known as Apathetic magnetic power attracting masses
Masked with gastric acids, turnin ya flesh to ashes
2002 Demigodz'll crush you wack asses!Every time I leave my house, pork patrol wanna seek me out
Did I see it, did I do it? C'mon down to the station house
Chase me down, "Hey, how's that high?"
Shine the flashlight around my eyes
Every time some coward cries
They doubt that I have an alibi

[Verse 1]

It's bizarre how I got a disregard for prison bars
But it isn't hard to see why I hate the mainstream
And daydream of beating Dave Matthews with his guitar
I live to scar you with a lit cigar
If I miss the charts, I'll put a mailbomb in your Christmas card
Cause you're jealous of the fact that I'm blowing up and you're envious at heart
My true intentions are cruel intentions, new ways to hurt you with new inventions
You figure you're a star, I'll hit you with a car and flatten you down to 2 dimensions
You want me to be non-violent? It's only gonna happen on a day that I'm silent
Which isn't too often, cause I can't be sober til' you're standing over Lou's coffin
Any other time I got a beer in my hand and mysterious plans to put fear in your fam'
And so degenerates cheer for the champ of born losers, hero to weirdos and porn users
My three last shows, were fiascoes
This dude came up like, "Yo, you see that Ho?" "I dare you to grab her ass"
So I grabbed her snatch and had a fight with these three assholes
Now I'm mad at that and there's an APB
The cops kicked my ass when they came for me, like they hold a grudge
So I stood up in the courtroom and told the judge I got A.D.D

[Chorus]

I'm mischievous, I make people want to slit their wrists
A whole lot of parents and critics is all pissed at this
But they missed the gist, it's just fictitious
I'm mischievous, my songs make kids wanna slit their wrists
And now a lot of critics and parents is all mad at this
I need clearances to make appearances

Warning, take caution, keep out of children's reach
Cause I spill a speech of bad will to teach
And let the psychos fill the streets
A lot of criminals wanna kill police, steal the keys and set the villains free
You better listen kids cause I'm mischievous, so keep out of children's reach


[Verse 2]

(Oh no!) I'ma ruin your whole show, stumble on the stage drunk moving in slow-mo
Cause you wouldn't know dope, even if you would've sold coke or tried to steal Louis' whole flow
Folks now better than to try and diss
I'll put you in a choke-hold, I'm childish
I'll poke holes in your car tires with my bare hands and sharpened appliances
Cause I'm a product of my environment, so I can't be blamed if my rhymes are violent
Cause every time I'm in silence, asleep, sick thoughts creep in behind my eyelids
Rhymes aside skip the dissin' nonsense, we about to have a real pissin' contest
You think I wouldn't let my pee soak your every seam till you weigh as much as Heavy D?
It's a fact misery loves company, and lung disease would work wonderfully
So I teach little kids to smoke, shit it's just a joke and it sounds like fun to me
It's as easy as 1,2,3
Come on up to the roof and then jump with me
And when they scrape you up from the street, instead of doing dirt, you'll be buried underneath
From the kids in the projects robbing stores, to the burbs where they steal from the shopping malls
It ain't a MC who don't respect me, so don't get testy
Y'all haven't got the balls

[Chorus]

I'm mischievous, I make people want to slit their wrists
A whole lot of parents and critics is all pissed at this
But they missed the gist, it's just fictitious
I'm mischievous, my songs make kids wanna slit their wrists
And now a lot of critics and parents is all mad at this
I need clearances to make appearances

Warning, take caution, keep out of children's reach
Cause I spill a speech of bad will to teach
And let the psychos fill the streets
A lot of criminals wanna kill police, steal the keys and set the villains free
You better listen kids cause I'm mischievous, so keep out of children's reach

[Verse 3]

When you're slumping guys till ya lump they eyes
Up to a pumpkin's size they're like, "Oh no!"
A whole lot of husbands would give me a snuffing if they knew who I'm fucking like, "Oh no!"
If you drank so much that you don't react to an oak-wood bat across your bony back
And wake up, looking in your wallet and you don't see jack it's like, "Oh no!"

Every time I leave my house, pork patrol want to seek me out
Did I see it, did I do it? Come on down to the station house
Chase me down, "Hey, how's that high?"
Shine the flashlight around my eyes
Every time some coward cries
They doubt that I have an alibi(uh, ah)
Together again for the first time (yeah)
R-Son, the voice of reason (check it out)
Louis Logic, J.J. Brown
Back up in this motherfucker (yo, yo)
Before you even knew

[R-Son]
Be prepared when the clock strikes, we ignite these hot mics
To heat up the spot like bauxite
Snatchin' the spotlight from those who don't deserve it
When you want the set wrecked, my bros is at your service
Be careful what you ask for, the chaos'll be extreme enough
To warrant a FEMA task force
For a damage assessment, batten down the blast doors
You had your chance to study up, these here is the crash course
Down to the last straw, we take cats that were passed off as emcees
And strip their masks off, the black Isaac Asimov
My sci-fi imagination is so sick you'll need vaccination
Causin' exasperation (Damn!) and scientists tryin' to find a cure
Failin', cause the toxin's so pure and I'm so sure
Of the venom Randy's droppin'
That each record comes with a vial of anti-toxin

[Hook]
R-Son...in your sector...Louis Logic...cocaine with words
Verified...the question is this...you wanna battle?
Jay scratch the wax...R-Son, in your sector
Louis Logic, cocaine with words...verified
Yeah, real logic and reason...like this, yo, yo

[Louis Logic]
Back in part one, R-Son left you far from stardom
Now it's bar-none, I'm tryna leave you locked up in a car trunk
With large lumps on your dome like the Epcot Center
Many a venomous snake skates once the despot enters (Here ye, here ye)
The ruler in charge, cooler than Arctic snowstorms
Louis is artistic, this is bully your squad with no horns
Clothes torn like you're in a schoolyard grudge match
With two hard thug brats who aim to take your lunch bag
And once back on Memory Lane, you'll get chased
By the dude in the dunce cap who never gets blamed
So save the judge act for Mills Lane, I never arraign
Though I'm more able than the man who killed Cain to spill shame
I will maim your respect, will place you in check
I will strangle your neck, and you'll still bang my cassette
And I ain't threatenin', that's just how it is
You need to be more like Mrs. Markie and get the fuck out the Biz

[Hook]

Uh, yo yo check it out, yo
[Louis Logic]
When I'm comin' down the home stretch, sudden death rules in effect
With no rep', that's the type of fight that you can expect
Cause I'm flier than stupid insects, ya'll bang on the ground
So if you're still hangin' around it's with a noose on your neck
[R-Son]
If the prospect of lynchin' causes tension on the surface
The purpose of this word is to make you nervous
And when the paranoia sets in, it'll make your head spin
Clairvoyantly reading your thoughts like Kreskin
[Louis Logic]
And I got a plan for your dissection and a fresh blade scissor
To remove your breastplate quicker
Understand I could kill y'all with a rhyme
So you best wait, mister
I'm still strong in the mind like an ex-weight lifter
[R-Son]
The best shape shifter can't mimic this
The power of logic and reason combined is limitless
That's why we left behind witnesses, to remind innocents
In our presence, the ones who survived are the penitent

[Hook]

Yeah, yeah yeah, so if you didn't know, now you know
(Now y'all motherfuckers know)
Motherfuckin' Louis Logic up in this bitch
(The original Shadow Cabinet)
You're man R-Son, aight, takin' this motherfucker over
I been tellin' y'all niggas, it's time to take this game a little more serious
Yo, J.J. Brown on the motherfuckin' boards
(Comin' through in your sleep, comin' through in your memory, it's like that, what?)I fell asleep with the lights on last night
A dream helped me see my wrongs under black light
I let my self esteem splash like cum on the walls
And fled the scene from another sad crash site
I probably shoulda gave more effort
To make more records than stray dog sessions
What came first the tour date or erection?
One more place checked off for your collection

Pats on the back, stud
Rockstar cool crashed out on the mat in the bathtub
Like you got harpooned
Gettin' fat on the rap love, drugs, Pabst and the bad blood
Sad but true, you pissed in your pants
This was your chance to give to your fans
A little more than the dick in your pants
Bet you wish that your parents didn't see the whole charade
They watched you throw away the dough you made at shows you played
You coulda been a rap star with his own parade
I never meant the first black car in the motorcade

I fell asleep with the lights on
And they shined on all of my wrongs that I never got to better into bygones
A little bit less all night and a little more effort into my songs
I coulda been around when I break on through
And that haunts me so I haunt you
I never dreamed I would die young
Lie to me and you choke my chain
If I didn't die, people wouldn't know my name

I never shoulda been so thick
Or played the tough guy schtick if the pen don't fit
By the time I learned to trust my gift and be brave
The beat changed on and the end closed in
Such is fate now that I love my skin
They dug my grave and I jumped right in

This is a mistake I'm not the next Nick Drake
If kids wait, I was gettin' close to my big break
Fans said if I'd just make one more great tape with J.J
I would have seen my first big payday
But I'm a day late, and a dollar short
Being away makes the fans just want it more
Whether you're a martyr or you were gone before greatness
You become a connoisseurs favorite
And I don't say it to express regret
For tardy payments and creditors I left with debt
How can I expect to rest
An artist anguished I haven't made my best just yet

I fell asleep with the lights on

I fell asleep with the lights on
And they shined on all of my wrongs that I never got to better into bygones
A little bit less all night and a little more effort into my songs
I coulda been around when I break on through
And that haunts me so I haunt you
I never dreamed I would die young
Lie to me and you choke my chain
If I didn't die, people wouldn't know my name

I fell asleep with the lights on
And they shined on all of my wrongs that I never got to better into bygones
A little bit less all night and a little more effort into my songs
I coulda been around when I break on through
And that haunts me so I haunt you
I never dreamed I would die young
Lie to me and you choke my chain
If I didn't die, people wouldn't know my name

I fell asleep with the lights on
I never dreamed I would die young

I fell asleep with the lights on
I never dreamed I would die young[Sample]
"When Pope Benedict asked Giotto for a drawing to prove his worth as an artist, Giotto drew a perfect circle - freehand ... perfection is a powerful message"

[Verse 1]
I'm a single white male thirty-two years old
And I've never been too great with the women
Well if the truth's being told I'm not much good with people
I've been alone in all the places I lived in
But fate had forgiven my shortcomings and brought something Forth from inside me that guides me when a call comes in
It's as if I'm blessed with a gift to talk someone into a spell unknown
When I'm lecturin' with the telephone
But forced run-ins: face to face are hella hard
I'm afraid to date, but somehow make a great telemarketer
Cause I can sell Antarctica ice in wintertime
With twenty-nine inches that won't melt and mark up the price
Might be the fact I'm alone
But most of the human contact I've known I've always had through the phone
So when I get back to the home where I live now
I sit down and dial my own map to see who answers though
Half the old ones I get the message:
"The number you have reached has been disconnected"
With ten digits entered from another past number
The ringing interrupts a man's slumber (Hello?)
And that was just from last summer (Hello?)
The change is enormous
And keepin' up to speed is a real game of endurance
I always get some lame little office specializing in claims for insurance
Or maybe the occasional florist

[Spoken]
Corner Florist
Hello?
Hello?
I'm sorry, what'd you say?
Corner Florist
Is this a flower shop?
Yes
Oh, I'm sorry I think I have the wrong number
OK, bye
Bye

[Verse 2]
Why am I still searching, and for what I don't know
Perhaps a real person or some version of love on the phone
It's like these ten little buttons have grown
So significant, my will's worthless fighting off the gluttonous jones
So I chose a different number to try
And I was thinkin' I'd end up ringing another old guy
But when I reached the third line what a surprise
It was the first time in my whole life
On the telephone my tongue was so tied

[Spoken]
Hello?
*Breathing*
Hello?
Uh- uh...
Is there somebody there?
*Sigh*
I can hear you

[Verse 3]
It must've been something we shared in the weird few moments of where
Silence when I was quiet like no one was there
So unprepared to ever get your voice
I fell in love though I was scared like I was left no choice
But you can expect most boys who get a first taste of love in their thirties
To revert to their seventh birthday
That's probably why I went the worst way
And devised a plan to get to know her with my voice disguised and invented surveys:
"Hello?"  "Hi, I'm calling from the Census Department
I was hoping you could answer a few questions of ours, ma'am"
"Yeah, sure" "How many people live in your apartment?
What are their ages? And by chance is anyone partners?"
"Well, it's just me. I'm 30 and I'm not married"
"Alrighty, do you move often, and have your jobs varied?"
"No, I've been here for the last 3 years
And, my jobs did you say?" "Yes ma'am, how many past careers?"
"Well, I'm not really a people person, I've always worked in a lab"
"Ma'am I don't blame you with all the jerks that we have
I take it you don't get out much to flirt with the lads?"
"Are you kidding? It's just as well, men are perfectly crass"
Workin' the plans I had sown to build a rapport
I realized to have her by phone wouldn't fulfill me no more
So using the skills I was born with
I got her address at home, killin' the calls
So I could see the best mess that I'd known
Perhaps it was only a sad attempt to find the nerve it would take
To say goodbye to the phone and tell the girl to her face
"Well, I won't put your day further to waste
Thanks for your time ma'am, sorry to disturb you, ok? ...bye"
"Ok... bye"

[Verse 4]
Desperate times call for closer measures
So I left behind the telephone and bought some telephoto lenses
Parked in a car, like those old detectives I watched from afar
And saw that she lived by herself alone and friendless
Then what I noticed next would leave me livid
Her only guest was a handsome guy whose weekly visits
Had her cry, by the time he would leave
I'd bet the guy was an ex or current flame unless my eyes were deceived
I tried to believe she cried to relieve heartache
But this guy wouldn't leave, it seemed she was liable to be in harms way
If I could just sneak in her place I'd find it would lead to a trace
Of why she would keep lettin' this creep within arms length
Gettin' the piece was the easy part
Cause if by chance I met him when I crept in through the window I would need the arms
I was breathin' hard when I stepped in
Broke the glass into shards with the weapon and tore the bedroom where she sleeps apart
That's when a creaking part of the floor and a twisting knob on the door
Startled me - I turned with the gun and shot it before
I realized I killed my own love
I dropped on all fours sobbin' and coughin' 'til I spilled my own guts
I came to still on the rug in the same room
Filled with the stuff I had tossed around and then I found in plain view
What seemed to be a diary sittin' beside my knee
I couldn't make my mind believe the words that I would finally read:
Page one: "Thursday: five o' three
I was trying to sleep before the night shift when this guy woke me
He had a voice that had a vibe so sweet
It was caught on my thoughts & just wouldn't let my mind go free"
I skipped to page seventy-four and read a bit more
"The only thing that I look forward to is gettin' his calls
If only I could get up the gall
I would tell him I loved him" I had to skip right to the end of it all
As for the last passage it began: "Why me?
Where's my mystery man, God? How could you let this guy leave
Will all the bad times and depression I've seen
This just has to be the last life's lesson I need
In fact this week's visit with my little brother
He said if the cancer keeps gettin' worse it'll kill our mother
He said the doc' said I should just accept that she's dying
And from the second he left, I spent the rest of the week crying"

[Outro]
Let down, left out
Sad songs, poems, and lies
Don't get your hopes up cause it gets the best of you
You get stepped on, let down, left out to dry, and you die[Louis Logic]
Ap I'm glad I caught you
You know I'm 'bout to leave the pad on tour soon
And I thought you'd watch my lady while I'm gone dude

[Apathy]
Yo c'mon Lou, of course that's cool, you're my fuckin' man
My fam, I mean damn, I don't got no other plans
We can rent some Blockbuster, catch a movie or two
But I'mma have to leave her home if there's some hoochie to screw

[Louis Logic]
Oh shit yeah, if there's some booty for you, handle yours, hit the bed
I ain't tryna cock block if you're gettin' head
Lick and spread that chick instead, but if not, you gotta watch my baby then
Cause most of my lady's friends are chickenheads

[Apathy]
Yeah that's understandable, broads can be real influential
And keepin' a clean slate is instrumental in relationships potential
I'll run into the store for the doe if shes low
And try to keep her from runnin with clubbin hoes

[Louis Logic]
Word, I new there was a reason you're my brother yo

[Apathy]
Of course Lou, your blood from another mother, no other bro

[Apathy]
Hello

[Louis Logic]
Aiiyo Ap, wassup its Lou
My bus is stuck in ?, I'm glad I trust you to watch my lovely boo
Aiiyo, y'all found some stuff to do

[Apathy]
Oh word up, we just buggin dude
Tryna watch this flick, wanna talk to your chick?
Oh, hold up, she just went into the bathroom sick
See we was drinkin and shit and now we chillin on the couch
We was thinking of goin out but decided to lounge in the house

[Louis Logic]
Yo, lounge in the house? Bounce and be out?
What you mean shes sick, yo who the fuck you think you drinkin with
Your supposed to be over seeing shit
It sounds like all hell's breakin loose

[Apathy]
Yo, your breakin up Lou and your trippin like I'm trickin with your chick
Stop bein a dick actin like we fiendin to stick -phone hanging up-

[Apathy]
Yo fuck it, don't pick it up, Lou's just bein' a jerk
His goin berserk, his probably just stressed from all the work
Let's relax, sure we can cuddle, there's nothin' wrong with that
You can lay across the couch and put your head on my lap

[Apathy]
Oh, what up b

[Louis Logic]
Don't what up me you fuckin asshole
I dropped outta my tour and had to duck my last show
Whats goin' on with you and my girl, slutty asshole
You fuckin' her, what you tryna ruin my world

[Apathy]
Yo first of all kid, take that fuckin' tone out your voice
We boys but what you girl does is really her choice
Now she's sittin' lonely at home while your doin' your shows
Besides son, I thought it was bros before hoes

[Louis Logic]
So if your clothes come off while your chillin' with my sweet thing
I'm supposed to let her share her g-string
I'mma take that anniversary ring right back to Zales
Ask the sales girl to take back the pearls
Smack the curls off my ladies head and kill you for your treachery
You said you were my best friend, instead you got the best of me

[Apathy]
Yo Lou, this shit is hectic B, I'm really not the enemy
It takes two to tango and we share the same energy
One night over some Hennessey we started messin sexually
And well, now we dealin with an unexpected pregnancyYeah, Vinnie Paz baby
2 G baby
Army of the Pharoahs
All that good shit

[Ikon the Hologram]
Yo, yo
The lawnmower man smashes
Through your skull with battle axes
We whip asses, with adjante daggers
That slashes
Crushing opposition like we was fascists
Stigmata and four gashes
We bashes, the faggots who can't attack it right
Take they sternum and then turn them into my acolytes
That's the sight of blood that make a child stop
That's the rights of thugs that keep it wild hot
I hate you, say to pray to a heavenly father
It's fatal, like a NATO military armada
We hotter, warriors from Atlantis
Couldn't understand how raw the Hologram is
The mantis who use the flame rod
Cause y'all couldn't physically bruise the name God

[Diamondback]
Yo the technique, detrimental to your immune
Leave you in the dust, let y'all niggas choke on fumes
It's the tight mikes, aerodynamic, gigantic
The shadow I cast is dominant, royal highness
North Philly's own home-grown cham-pion
Purposely remainin' unknown until shown
Cold as stone, the stage, my home away from home
I, prefer to leave these cloned niggas alone
Buildin' a home for lost MC's gone wrong
Feel the pressure when my team come on strong, it's QD

[Hook repeat 2x]
*Stoupe scratches*
Never try to duplicate the skills executed
But can't the skill execute this right
Listen up y'all suckas to what I say
Breakin out an unstoppable...

[Jus Allah]
Megatraum is fucking monstrous
Hoppin' out of Lake Loch Ness
Every motherfucker in range is left top-less
Quell my metropolis, like shit's cop-less
Y'all cock-less, we stuff y'all in boxes
For stuffed pockets, yo my thugs is thick
Thug'll diss em, when we gotta put a slug in your bitch
Splatter your dame, Pharoahs we shatter your brain
'Till a nigga's salary change to lateral game
Like Calgary Flames, puttin' fire on ice
Put me in hell, for puttin' four nails in Christ

[Louis Logic]
I'm like Billy Goat Gruff under the bridge at Governor Ridge
Waitin' to knock heads off, I'm a mean son-of-a-bitch
With an itch to misbehave and wave a switchblade
In front of your face so close to leave your whiskers shaved
To disengage, or rip the pages from your notepad
And shove 'em up the hole between your lower back and gonads
The only way your rhymes would be the shit
You need to read a script on playin' gay cause you cats could eat a dick
Servin' sucka MC's a fifth of the drunken stylin'
Rippin' M-I-C's like a pub in Dublin, Ireland

[Hook]

[B.A. Barakus]
Hey yo I got a fetish, to see flesh rip
When my Tek spits, breaking the bone where ya'll chest is
I dare a nigga to try and battle
I'll put the sweat in your palms when you swallow your adam's apple
Eat MC's like Chupacabra was eating cattle
Defeat disease with palabras, frequently battle
I make the hardest man fall back and start to squeal
Haul a fifth to his face, taste the steel
This why I got pro deep and stay ruthless
You useless, fuck with us and leave toothless
We're often known as psycho-drama dispensors
Paralyze niggas then put 'em in trauma centersIt's Louis Logic and Magic
Molesting fat chick with contraptions and gadgets
Smacking those asses
We tapping and passing
Sit back while your girl grabbing my package like a UPS savage
I'm going postal
Stamp my logo on the cabbage
I need a bad bitch down with my urine fetish
You never forget this
Girl I'll have you doing back flips
And landing on my dick
Now women try to run game
I'm to fresh kid
You'll get molested
Not Luke but I'm rude getting banned from stores
Even fishing with my grandpa luring in whores
And I keeps a young lady with an ass so fat
That her pants could burst off
At any second black
So stand back and see how real pimps handle that
I fuck a little ass with a big sandal strap

[Hook]
Chicks don't seem to mind when they're doing Magic
A little loving from us once a day will keep the stress away
And it's one of those things the little moms got to tell her girls
But she don't say a word to daddy
That she don't have to live without it

Yo, nine out of ten vaginas prefer Magic
It's automatic
Got a fat ass and I'mma smack it
Pack it on up girl I'm eating that tonight
Sex with a minor?
You god damn right
And a miner hat on with that little flash light
Exploring you slut your little girls whoring it up
I'll flip her from behind and put my finger in her uhhhhh
When I was you I was a real smut peddler
Used to ride my bike in my local porn shop
Watch flicks like Ram-Bone and Robo-Cock
So when I shoot my first video
I plan to make it hot
With your wife in it
And 29 crotch shots
All you do is cock block
Cock please stop
You know I'm from Florida so I make the coochie pop
And since I got my own theme I drove a speed boat
With shirt off through your girls wet dream

[Hook]

I'm most obnoxious when I'm out of closing boxers
I make chicks feel Italian when they holding sausage
I'm only over cautious when it comes to making sure
I never spend a day or more without a naked whore
Waging war in the sack I pull the rocket out
Hold them hostage when the cock spits
And it's full it knocks 'em down
They shooting I made you look
Watch this I'm like a naked crook
I steal a box quick escape the hook
The Cat burgular
And stabbed the pussy so many times it's mass murder
That's worth a peta in a lady's socket
Cause I love hug the beaver like I'm Davy Crockett
Ladies lock lips on my tasty hot dick
Then I douche them on the mountains if the babies got tits
I met a Spanish chick in a crazy blond wig
Told her 'damelo mami'
She gave me jock itch

[Hook]{Intro from Red Foxx, stand-up comedian}
"I swear to God and three other white men, I'm good
I talk about sex and being a negro
And you're not supposed to talk about sex
But hell, negroes have sex!
Didn't nobody draw us!"

[Verse 1: Louis Logic]
Yo, I'm best described as the father of sex and lies
I specialize in undressing wives, but I recognize
When it's time to pull my cock out the hot house
Cause I don't want no seeds left inside
So instead I'll catch a rise
With a wet surprise, from the yogurt slinger
And poke a finger up her ass until the motion stings her
Depending on how close it brings her to the point of climax
That's when I get romantic with her face adjoined to my lap (sluuuut)
How would you like to get fucked in the butt
I know you probably love to get covered with nut
And I can cover your mug with enough of this stuff
Whenever my muscle will bust
That if you breath in it would smother your lungs
Eww, what you mean? You ain't had ya fill?
I splash ya grill, like lighter fluid at a family meal
Or a lesbian's face with Vagisil when she bites into it (BITES what?)
Into coochie you dyke-slut you know you like to do it

{Hook}
Coocoo-chie coocoo-chie coocoo-chie
"Bitches!"
"Drop to your knees"
Coo-cooooooooochie
"I do more stickin' in chicken than Stove Top Stuffing"
Coocoo-chie coocoo-chie coocoo-chie
"Bitches get wet then I inspect 'em like Deck"
Coo-cooooooooochie
"I wanna get into it man, you know"
"What?"
"Vagina"

[Verse 2: Louis Logic]
Always aim for the torso that's what I learned from playing in pornos
While I'm stuffing tube steak in her  cornhole
If I'm late for one more show cause I spend my label's paper on more hoes
They'll probably would take me straight to a court show
But instead of gettin' screwed on TV I rather fuck cuties
Unless ofcourse Judge Judy's in the mood to eat me
I usually use my CD to abuse the treaty
Of sex between me and my ex and feed her spooge in 3D (ohhh)
You should see me when the semen's flowin' spewin' freely
I squeeze a load in the throat till the chicken's cheeks are swollen
Cause if a beep is showin then she gets the worm
Catchin' cock in every turn with extra sperm till the lesson's learned
I'm less concerned with closed nails and a precious perm
As long as I avoid of infectious germs and her breasts are firm
And when I'm tryin to fuck your chick and call a ho a slut a bitch
It's for kicks so it's not a sexist term

"Now what start's with the letter 'C'?"

{Hook}

[Verse 3: Louis Logic]
Chicks say I'm old fashioned, I don't want a bitch stuck in the kitchen
I wanna stuff a dick in her ass while she's touchin' her kitten
I like to fuck and forget 'em and try a dozen positions
Then serve the mic a sermon like rightin' smunks of religion
I pay homage to bondage and good will with a feel
And stay up in a prime just for stacks like Wilt the Stilt
And in the process I like to turn women to objects
Penthouse to hen house of birds livin' in projects
I don't discriminate on the basis of race or the place that you stay
That's hardly a chick I won't inseminate
I spread the legs of college chicks featherweights and solid chicks
I make 'em face the snake but I never taste the bottomlips
I poke 'em with the Obelisk and flee from the scene
Let me explain then you'll see what I mean
Cause as much as I love pussy you can't feed it to me
You know why?
I don't eat anything that bleeds for a week and don't die

{Hook}[Louis Logic]
If this was a live show I'd probably get dragged from the stage
Handcuffed & caged for cursin' and spittin' at 5-0
I'm on a mission to find folks to victimize
Sadomasochists wishin' to die slow listen to my flows
The torturous, I'll see to it you're finished
Leave your unfortunate seeds in an orphanage
Even if your image dictates, you love the way a dick tastes
You'll get tossed from a big stage
Put your hands down dickface, I didn't tell you to raise them
I started underground and then I fell through the basement
Misplaced soul like I had to sell it to Satan
And amidst the hellish arrangement tried to tell him to change it
So make irrelevant statements, say that you sell your tape
And say that your 12" played on your favorite well listened station
I'm waitin' for celebratin' your folded career over a beer
I know where you live, wake up and smell the fragrance

Yo, yo
Bustin' the one to the two, three, four
Proud to be poor, you're about to see me more
Beware, detour, for the war
My reputation is drenched in folklore, but it's all true
All due respect to the king, don't question a thing
We can take it to the Octagon or take it to the ring
You ain't recoupin' or movin' the prophet, ruin your knowledge
We recoupin' by doin' this project, with Louis Logic
When I walk the concrete splits
I pimp heavy metal biker bitches down to rich R&B chicks
The golden era won't quit, I'm legendary, it's a classic if I wrote it
My flow you can't fix it, I ain't never broke it
You a corporate puppet on a Muppet Caper
Put you in a funeral parlor with the undertaker
See I'm smoother than Don Cornelius on Soul Train
And Slicker than Ricky or Mr. T's gold chain

... Fresh from a court runnin from a bar tab
Drivin drunk with car lag in need of a barf bag
I left my smart half on the hard path to recovery
With hangover hovering I took a bath in the bubbly
I woke up in the trash, cold clutchin a flask
With a wino askin for some from me, but there's no stuff in my stash
I'm so stuck in a glass but insist on throwin Rollin Rocks
Shades drawn, doors closed and locked, hopin no one knocks
I'm in a lonely spot
Nowhere, and I want some some Stoli shots
Like I don't care if my AA sponsor knows or not
I'll spend a week soaked in scotch on Venice Beach with the vagrants
Then I'm... leavin for Vegas
But I'm penny free, and owe a lot of dough
To spot my landlord and old lady liks
It's like I said, she likes to collect, she don't babysit

"When I get bent, I must represent, no question" {*scratched*}
I'm the lush president of the wino section
Since you find no lessons in this lonely life, it's like... "Shorty let me
Tell you 'bout my only vice" {*scratched*}
"When I get bent, I must represent, no question" {*scratched*}
I been at war with lady liks and can't find no weapons
Or find protection on my coldest nights, it's like... "Shorty let me tell
You 'bout my only vice" {*scratched*}

So basically, my drinkin schedule's 8 to 3
But wait and see I bet you I can make the rate increase
Until I start sprayin my vomit on my Old Navy fleece
So sayeth the logic, so say the sheep
My next commandment, to drink a case a piece at least
To set the standard, a buncha drunks that's dead from cancer
Leave your 12 steps abandoned on the way to the bar
A convoy that's on joy juice racin their cars
Drinkin grain from a jar, that's moonshine to the laymen in bars
And soon I'm hearin angels with harps
Perhaps it's beepin horns and I'm crossin lanes in my car
And sleepin on the job but made it so far, I'm thinkin ain't this bizarre
It's kinda freezin', tryna find the reason
When I realized my gates were ajar
I took the Nestea plunge straight to the tar, but never jumped
Then I awoke in a pool of my puke where I had left my lunch

I was born of beer kegs in college dorms and molotov mixtures
Fists up, breakin bottles off niggas
Make escape doin the hundred yard dash, comin from a car crash
That's what I call a runnin bar tab, back to the lab
When an undercover car passed after my ass
Dropped to my knees and my hands in the grass
A straight shot to the trees beside my door, but I'd forgotten my keys
Plus I had too much brandy to last, so I hopped to my feet
My hands were both clasped stoppin the stream
If I puked the cop would probably see
But he was watchin me flee on wobbily feet, at least that's what I'm thinkin
That's when he tackled me stagnant and stinkin
I said, "No way occifer, I haven't been drinkin"
Then he said, "You're under arrest kid, and we're goin back to the precinct"

A tenament resemblin' a 5th ward shit hole
A tortured soul type agoraphobe
Who sported robes and made sure his door was closed
Ever since his brief intro to this freak nympho
He had his first time with in a lime green pinto
He kept the cheap bimbo
But he was unaware that any cat who come prepared
Got up in her underwear
He was an unsure kid, somewhat scared in the first place
Before his 20th birthday, he married his first lay
A careless, young airhead, who shared sex in her bed spread
Anywhere she found a spare bed
Who would dare wed such a slut?
Savage and sultry
To the last days of their marriage, she practiced adultry
When she finally bounced on the boy, he drank by the gallon and quart
And shout at the lord til he went out of his gourd
Instead of crazy, he had thoughts of going Kevin Spacey in Se7en, maybe
He wanted to behead his lady
And any shady kid who laid his mitts on his baby's tits
His faith was stripped like an atheist
Maybe it's that God lies, he was tortured by the thought of
How many odd guys probably knew his wife's bra size
His thought process was counter-clockwise
Envisionin' guns and bloody butcher shop knives

[Sample from movie]:
Man #1: What the fuck are you doing??
Woman: What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?
Man #2: Can you close the door?
Man #1: Will I close the door? Will I close the door?! That's my wife, you

ASSHOLE!

*gun shot*

*sirens*

The super opened the tenant's door and found a corpse instead
A rookie cop was like "Are you sure he's dead?"
Then the coroner said, "You mean aside from how his forehead's spread?
The empty quarter-keg and the skipping record by Portishead?
I would say it's a safe bet he took the 38-spesh taste test and ate lead
He's more or less dead
Tag him and bag him, then ziplock the smokin' magnum
Round up the neighbors from the ground up and ask 'em
'Who, what, where, when and why?'
Anything that would make such a friendly guy wanna end his life
It's all probably, to be revealed in the autopsy
The semi-warm body rolled through the first floor lobby
Growing cold and lifeless, journey on the gurney to the meat wagon
Packed in with the medical devices
Firmly wrapped tight in a sheet of white
While the preacher type prays for heaven's blessing beggin' "Jesus Christ"
The DT was like, "See his right hand? it's a wedding band
Has anybody seen his wife?"
"Well, sir, I heard she was the cheating type who would sleep with any man
According to the neighbors if I'm readin' right"
"Son, let me help you see the light, and put two and two together
She got sick of the kid, and ran off with who ever
The guy couldn't take it, he blew open his cake hole
A modern day face lift, suicide, case closed"Louis Logic, Super Regular Recordings, 5g's Platinum, J.J. Brown

[Verse 1: Louis Logic]
Yo, before setting' it off know that the predator draws
More blood than an open wound against the leading competitor's gauze
Leaving sores on bleeding jaws on the path
You should keep your eyes on Louis Logic & the drunken pies on icon
Misconstruing optical illusions when boozing as bottles ooze and
Love songs of us getting our drunk on
Tippin' tequila 'til my tongue's warm, then fall off the stage
Pass out while writing a rhyme and scroll off the page
Wake up in a rage with the shakes, where's my love gone?
I'm un-calm, a bottle of Jack at my lips
And a Guinness I.V. in one arm, Bass Ale in the other
Makes tonight's Black & Tan, but I still fail to recover
I hit step six and my train of thought derails from the others
Daydreaming of a damsel with grain-alcohol wet lips
So it's a Beck's fifth for breakfast
I'll count it as the juice from that food group and mark it off the checklist

[Scratched Samples]
"When I get bent, I must represent"
"It's the truth, like vodk' one-eighty proof"
"Shorty let me tell you 'bout my only vice"
I gotta...
"Drink a beer
"Now gimme that
"When I get bent I must represent, no question
"I drink a Guinness Stout
"I take a small swig" (x2)
"Tap it and then crack it...

[Verse 2]
I was born to beer kegs at college dorms and pop's liquor cabinet
My drunken slur is like a British accent
Cause when I'm taking a flask to my face 'til I lay in the grass
And erase every trace of my past
I'm reborn a secret agent whose feet beat the pavement to the bar stool
At a bar full of drunken drivers called the carpool
With a preacher at my right side, a cop at my left
Double-fisting a bottle of Beck's and a vodka and Schweppes
I spit a sad life story with a Scotch intellect
And nod off in the middle, that's the possum effect
I'm still alive though, even after the shit close, I'm outside
Sharing sips of Cisco while I chill with a wino
Who suffers from bottle neglect
He need a pint of self esteem, plus a shot of respect
With such a delicate habit, it's a lot to protect
Cause Lady Liks is like a landlord, she got to collect

[Scratched Samples]

[Verse 3]
The drunken dragon's emerged from hibernation in a musky dungeon cavern
With an unparralled thirst that's unimagined
Swerving an old suburban with the front end crashed in
Signs of a hard night previous, start a devious bar fight
And escape with a six pack of Miller Lite and a cape
Draped over my shoulders with a mask hiding my face
I erase my own identity, and I'm not even speaking governmentally
First name is surname, scene from a memory in a black out
I was found with my back out, naked assed
It's like my friends are proposing cause they afraid to ask
Is Logic's doin' the shit that made 'em late to class?
The fool is back in the china shop, I got to break the glass
After toastin' with Icon, we raise the magic potion
And the drunken addits notion last devotion
Now that my bladder's soakin' with metaphors in it
I retreat to my suite at the Betty Ford clinic

[Scratched Sample: Black Sheep - "Pass The 40"]

"Pass the forty, pass the forty"
"Pass the forty, pass me the forty, pass it if you may"
"Pass the forty cause my mothers not lookin'"[LOUIS LOGIC]
Message post: 6-10-90 never subject louis logic

You said it folks this guys clever
He got extra dope rhymes and punch lines forever
His stuff will catch in no time if his production guy was better
And theres nothing I like better then new battle lyrics
My favorite jam is "Secret Agent" man you have to here it
I heard he got a phat review in a mag or two
And now the majors want him that would suck if that was true
There ain't a cat half as fat as lou and that's the truth who's stayin Indie
Or dudes with punchlines on major lables sayin any
He even answers all his emails if he's got a chance at all
He told me icons real name is vinny
Maybe when he's getting chased by a bunch of sweaty face record snakes
With chansaws and machete blades in pursuit like leather face and jason
He'll be the first kid who dont forget his place and sustains the basement
Anyways hit me up on my email if you disagree or wanna spit a free
Later dmx63

I said pray for the sunshine warmth today

But the cold rain cloud gon wash the sun away

You know this guy cries child but dont you weap

Cause mother son even goes to sleep

I said pray for the sunshine warmth today

You know this guy cries child but dont you weap

[LOUIS LOGIC]
Well isnt this poetic faithfully
Theres another emcee with major label fever next thing we know
He'll make a disco record
Louis Logic the next thing to grow into a classic?
Its probably more likely Roy Jones will get his ass kicked
He has made some impressive plastic but thats it
He never crafted a classic with an extended track list
Who tries to make tremendous rap hits on 12 inches anyways?
He doesnt understand that this is hells business
All the labels care about is sales figures and your whereabouts on the charts
And rappers livin at there parents house
For tryin to invent a daring sound
Which obviously isnt lous intent to save you the suspense
His newest attempts a dissapointment and a clear case
A great unlistened enjoyment for career stakes
So here's the answer and the ointment, show em no love
Your favorite dick eating critic also known as O'Dub

**CHORUS**

[LOUIS LOGIC]
So this is what you've all been asking for
I never let your small talk make me mad before
Cause after all when its said and done
Its as if these cats wish my only bread was crumbs
So let em front
Everyones a critic theese days, not to complain
These little djs dis wax of the popular phrase
But the topics the same, money sex and guns
Is that less expressive from how indie snobs expect it done
When underground records come with three choices
They can't spit
You can't understand it
Or its punks with weak voices
And you rejoice at three joints of the 20 tracks only some were fat
Then you wish you had your money back
Therell be none of that in my wax or stage show
I make extra sure to stay dope im spittin for your pesos
And kick them on the same flow to show you that im anti wack
Wether indie or major and their ain't to many fans like that

**CHROUS 2**
I said pray for the sunshine warmth today
But the cold rain cloud gon wash the sun away
You know this guy cries child but dont you weap
Cause mother son even goes to sleep
Blue skies and the sunshine come today
To the rain clouds gone washed the sun away
I know that things arent the way that they supposed to be
So I keep my umbrella so close to me

[LOUIS LOGIC]
Younge Fella you wouldn't know a dope emcee if the lord made them grow from trees
So some fellas wouldn't know a dope emcee if the lord made them grow from trees
They used to love my shit before the suburb chicks
Wanted to suck my dick
Now the rain done came
It's like they hate the flow, cause the radio increased the ratio
Its the same dumb thing

They might say my name, to the sound that creates migraines
Which means I dont go counterfit to change my game
I got a plan to be fresh, and even if the first families stressed
God damn the regret I can't be supressedI diznitavitches for these biznitavitches, you know what I'm sayin'?
You better take a piznitavicture of mother fuckin' Logic
When I'm spittin' scripture, nigga

I'm the sickest Sigman Froyd, boy, who sees his profession
As an evil means of aggression that'll leave you kids destroyed
I love to feed 'em a question that deceives their perception
And leads to depression by the time they leave from the session
You easily threatened with a lack of self-esteem?
It's cause you always see me on the M.I.C. like Kelly Green
Now these jealous fiends tellin' me I'm racist and I hate the Irish
Wait til I spit on a track right next to Seamus Ryan
You can take the privates out my pants and try and deepthroat
So far you wrap your lips around my nuts until you eat both
Cause y'all chippin' like you slippin' down a ski slope
In a grease soaked fleece coat butted by a mean goat
Each quote by hip-hop's favorite freak show
Creep goes in the 'what not to do' section of police code
Please don't try to fight with me like beans and cornbread
I would like to see to it that your dead
And I ain't gonna rain your parade, I'll piss right on your doorstep
Til the boards' spread on the door frame and the floors wet
Come back to your front porch steps for one more threat
And some poor schlep will get a lumped forehead

[Hook]
Come on Lou, this type of talk should be against the law
Just gimme more, y'all sissy's are just insecure
But isn't your pops an ex-cop from in the force?
Man, it doesn't change the fact that I'm immature
I'm in war in y'all basements, plus cellars
Kickin' in your door like what's up fellas
So I doesn't have to trust selfish critics if the fans says its dope
You're just jealous, fuck 'em if they can't take a joke

I'm like a swami, they way I'm memorizin' mami's
But instead of underneath, I rather have them restin' on my palm tree
I'm an advocate of master resistance
Bastard stepson of Gandhi who's out to kick the ass of this business
First up on the list is, the pacifist bitches
That crap in their britches when they get served up with a fist
Pull the skirt up on a bitch rapper a bit faster
Than a perverted Catholic pastor
Well, what do you know? Look who's mad again
Scribblin' raps with a Viagra pen
That doesn't write just to spite the Vatican
I'm an antonym for weak, I can't begin to speak
On my phantom life as anti-Christ of the industry
I'm out in the streets causin' confusion and mayhem
And usually stay bent, PM through to the AM
I got loose in my playpen and started breakin' shit
I'm your favorite kid no one wants to babysit
I built a career on makin' atheists pray then hit the church pews
Christians commit sins and say that it's a virtue
Does that disturb you? You spaz, I'm supposed to?
I'm the naughty little devil talkin' trash on your shoulder

[Hook]

Ahhh, cocksucker mother fucker two ball bitch
You probably spank your monkey to a RuPaul flick
You sick freaks, probably let your shit squeeze in your trunks
Stick your hands up in your pants and start eatin' the lumps
You probably have sex with a dead cow, spread the legs out
With a wide open pie-hole and dive ya head down
You're as gross as spreadin' menstrual blood on toast
And dumb enough to fuck a fat chick in the butt and then boast
You cretins, fucking cretins
Indecent heathens don't deserve to be breathin'
Fuck you and everything you stand for
Fuck you I hope you get spanked by your landlord
Bitch, you know what I'm sayin'?
This is Lenard Logic aka Larry Lethargic
You know what I'm sayin'? Niggas know
And if they don't they get fucked quicker than gigolos dickin' hoes
Pick your nose you bitchy flowed motherfucking pussies
Yeah, suck a dick[Celph Titled]
The time has now come. When the Godz from all four corners of the Earth have combined
To form an entity unparalleled. Under gray skies where the sun is ashamed to shine
Shower their names from Hell's breath, with speech made of fire
Be those who shall strike their wrath

[Verse 1:Celph Titled]
Motherfuckers better shut they mouth when the Godz spit rapid fire wisdom
Guns and grenades, my brigade consists of killin' henchmen
There ain't a nigga that's liver
I'm a Gun & Ammo subscriber
That's quick to burn numerous holes through your Averex fibers
I'm on some rob shit, Cuban mafia conglomerates
Tommy nozzle spittin' hollows tips, lauchin' like rocket ships
I got Glocks and clips and they're damn near ready to chase you
A bullet with your name on it, eager to kill and erase you
My Demigodz swordsmen are trained to slice precisely
You should question wifey, why your children look just like me
Come out the closet cause I know your whole crews fag
I saw 'em on the corner, rockin' rainbow colored doo rags
I rhyme fast and you just a bunch of slow herbs
You gettin' cuts and bruises trippin' over your own words
You better worship the barrel
Nigga my Glock is holy
We fry your ass and serve you on a plate with guacamole
The mac don
My teeth cut through Teflon
I was raised draggin' bodies through the door sayin' "What's up mom?"
Niggas think I'm a vampire
I ain't seen the sun since it was set on fire
I'm the fuckin' second comin' of Messiah
My promo manager didn't know what he was in for
Come to your town, rob the cash register at my in-store
I know Muslims that would rather piss on the Koran in front of Farrakan
Then try to fuck with me when I get my battle on

[Verse 2:Esoteric]
This is mic mastery
I massacre men automatically
Rapidly bringin' tragedy to shatter Gray's Anatomy
Rhymin' like it's '89
I'm slashin' through your cavalry
With or without Apathy, I got the Demigodz in back of me
So cross me
You're get stabbed like Jesus's wrists
Cease and desist
Even sober cats be pleadin' the 5th
You bitches know who it is
I'm back from the dead
Your facts be off base like recovery crack heads
The heat speaker
With Celph Titled the beat freaker
My [freak ??] defy Silver Bullets like Bob Seger
To all God seekers
It's the end of the road
My sentence is gold
The venom in my pen will explode
Penance is old
I'll rhyme till I'm sick and disgusted
You'll go out with a bang like a chick in a snuff flick
I flow with the slang
Esoteric commands shit
Responsible for more head bustin'/bussin' then public transit

[Verse 3:Louis Logic]
Have you ever had a nightmare?
And you were at an open mic where
Your friends and family were watchin' through the bright lights glare
And I dare you to flow but
You woke up screamin' in pain
And quite scared
Only to find me standin' right there
A demon over your head
Leanin' over your bed
To lead you closer to death while you're dreamin' you overslept
I leisurely stole your breath like that kitten in Cat's Eye
I'm that sly
The Klan will start wishin' they're black guys
Tell your girl she should be slimmer then fat thighs
I slipped a disc in my back while I was hittin' it last night
And last I checked
The main theme of livin' the rap life is to snatch mics like I don't have mine yet
I want 1 for my man
2 Live on the stage
3 in the lab
4 is a surplus
And 5 on the page
I want my face on the TV in every home in the country
Till mom's so sick of seeing me she don't even want me

[Verse 4:Apathy]
You wanna battle for money
Well, I can spit it accapella
And probably make you drop Amil/a million like Rocafella
Cause tryin' to take away a mic from Ap when I'm spittin'
Is like Mya tryin' to wrestle Missy for a piece of chicken
My verses reverse Earth spinnin' on it's axis
Till wack rap acts wax stars spin it backwards
I-am-the-illest-rap-cat-out
Now play the record forward and try to figure it out
Yo, I'll snatch profits and chips until my pocket rips
While y'all race in space in fake rocket ships
If I stay on my computer then I'll start up the apocalypse
Simulating a nuclear war like Matthew Broderick
Ap
Used to be known for complex rap
Now I diss chicken heads like I'm Project Pat
Ladies I hypnotize till they let me lick their thighs
You can see those little heart shapes in those bitches eyes
I'm Don Juan, Es Caliente, Rico Suave
The Lone Ranger
Y'all are like Tonto, Kimosabe
Tryin' to diss the champ but you missed your chance
You got so shook on stage that you pissed your pants
My hand grips till my fists gets pistol cramps
You couldn't relax if your raps were mystic chants
Like "Oooommmm"
Tryin' to meditate or levitate
But make sure you standin' 50 feet back to detonate"And then 4 months down the road the idiot gear kicks in
And I ask about the ex-boyfriend which
As we all know is a really dumb move but you know how it is --
You don't want to know, but you just have to know, right?
You know, stupid guy bullshit."

[Louis Logic]
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls:
In this corner quivering in the white trunks
We have the unsuspecting boyfriend facing up to the champion
His well-seasoned girlfriend
The three knockdown rule is in full effect

[Verse 1]
Ding Ding
That's the sound of curiousity peaking like cops that pat you down
Boyfriends probably seeking the dirt on the skirt as if he's deep in the earth
Like who had reached in the shirt and who was sleeping with her, but hey --
She's only human and probably only doing the dude who she loves most
So you know who she's screwing
But while you're lying there spooning assuming life is just all good
You indavertently missed the size of the falsehood
Living life in a small hood you probably collide
With lots of the guys who used to climb on top of your wife
So it's not a surprise you're asking the stupidest questions:
'Who was the best in the sack?' and 'How many dudes have you slept with?'
But the chance is, you didn't want them answers
And can't live with it she used to be just a dancer
Making the fast tips you would stuff her pants with
And fast as mass transit she thought you were romantic

[Hook]
I'm so glad we met (hey shorty)
Come on girl try to be patient, I know I'm a pain in the ass
But your ex-boyfriend has me stressed (back off dude)
And all of the sex stuff should just remain in the past
But we can't get married yet, (no we can't get married yet)
It isn't just that its greener, its also the length of the grass
But somehow you keep on running to me -- and we keep living in fear of the idiot gear

[Verse 2]
Right about this time, most of y'all are just wishin that this was fiction
And itchin to ask your chick if your dick isn't a depiction
Of fitting inside a stitching when you're sewing it up
And to think that most of this stuff is just over a fuck
I know what you're thinking, we've all grown up with women
And living without em seems like its harder than living with em
But if you hit em, you'll probably end up living in prison fellas
Then you'll be someone's bitch -- I hope your girlfriend isn't jealous
This cinderella shit is totally irrelevant
You'll never get a girl older than 7 thats been celibate
Cause every chick has been around the block with a guy or ten
And guys are sensitive, its better that you lie to them
Even the violent men who's dressed up in street clothes
With stilettos and heat knows they got delicate egos
If she chose to tell you all persons with whom
She put in work in the room, it would burst your balloon

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Looking at your sweetest snapshot, that's when you start to wonder
About the backdrop of her other lovers
When you discover another flick of her hidden up under there
Dressed in summer wear, with her ex giving her bunny ears
And no one wants to share their chick with last guy
To get rid of the bad vibes you figured you ask why
Her past life is still chilling in the picture frame
She'd probably forget his name if the dick's the same
Which is lame, but for some dumb reason
The last bum seeps into your dreams and you become unseasoned
Then one evening, you build up the heart to ask her
Disaster -- with your lungs breathin hard as asthma
And after she breaks down and tells you the truth
It leads to a fight and she's yelling at you
And I'm convinced of this: being your queen's only king
Yo man see Louis right -- ignorance is bliss

[Hook]

Oh what's a guy to do

Now listen to me papi
You're all fucking idiots
How do you like them apples?

"You know what I don't think we need to do the thing
Where we tell each other everything ..."[Louis Logic]
Uh, yeah, yeah, come on, come on, yeah, yeah
Now when the I-Jonez kids rang on my phone with
A request for me to craft a suicide poem quick
I told 'em I don't spit without an ice cold six
But fuck the yellow suds cause I don't like no piss
I need a dark brew like Jeff Gordon need a car crew
One lap in the sack and I can see your part two (too)
It's hard to imagine a drunk, smart Lou
Who doesn't want brew and says he's givin' up hard booze
This new philosophy sticks to the prophesy
Six stupid mockeries give you lobotomies
He's gotta be an inhuman oddity to get the kind of chedda you
Would win through the lottery
And spend it on liquor and sex so give 'em respect
For settin' records when his liver is wet
Cause if it isn't a check than give 'em a set of
Slippery breasts he can suckle like an infant again
I'm a baby, because I always get my way
And I seem crazy, cause I always forget my place
I'm in the women's rest room with a test tube
Standin' right next to one of the stalls
For her sample when she gets through
And I'm gonna wet you with a flask of piss
After this, simply so you catch the gist
And you can tell me how one of them bashful chicks
Felt when R. Kelly sprayed 'em with his splash of wizz
I got [Skills] only if you mean that I'm ill
As patients in the psychiatric ward missin' they pills
[Skills] Put piss in your grill from AIDS patients
Cause it gives me a thrill to ask 'em how the waste tasted
Some of you may hate this, others who will chill
It still doesn't stop me from givin' 'em ill [Skills] Yeah!
This is Louis Logic, the Drunken Dragon baby
And I'm chillin' with my peoples from I-Jonez
You know what I'm sayin?
If you ain't gettin' the news, then you ain't in the know
I got my man J.J. Brown on the boards
Puttin' them sounds into my ears
And we about to lace you up somethin' nice
Like a fresh pair of sneaks, son, boom(uh, ah)
Together again for the first time (yeah)
R-Son, the voice of reason (check it out)
Louis Logic, J.J. Brown
Back up in this motherfucker (yo, yo)
Before you even knew

[R-Son]
Be prepared when the clock strikes, we ignite these hot mics
To heat up the spot like bauxite
Snatchin' the spotlight from those who don't deserve it
When you want the set wrecked, my bros is at your service
Be careful what you ask for, the chaos'll be extreme enough
To warrant a FEMA task force
For a damage assessment, batten down the blast doors
You had your chance to study up, these here is the crash course
Down to the last straw, we take cats that were passed off as emcees
And strip their masks off, the black Isaac Asimov
My sci-fi imagination is so sick you'll need vaccination
Causin' exasperation (Damn!) and scientists tryin' to find a cure
Failin', cause the toxin's so pure and I'm so sure
Of the venom Randy's droppin'
That each record comes with a vial of anti-toxin

[Hook]
R-Son...in your sector...Louis Logic...cocaine with words
Verified...the question is this...you wanna battle?
Jay scratch the wax...R-Son, in your sector
Louis Logic, cocaine with words...verified
Yeah, real logic and reason...like this, yo, yo

[Louis Logic]
Back in part one, R-Son left you far from stardom
Now it's bar-none, I'm tryna leave you locked up in a car trunk
With large lumps on your dome like the Epcot Center
Many a venomous snake skates once the despot enters (Here ye, here ye)
The ruler in charge, cooler than Arctic snowstorms
Louis is artistic, this is bully your squad with no horns
Clothes torn like you're in a schoolyard grudge match
With two hard thug brats who aim to take your lunch bag
And once back on Memory Lane, you'll get chased
By the dude in the dunce cap who never gets blamed
So save the judge act for Mills Lane, I never arraign
Though I'm more able than the man who killed Cain to spill shame
I will maim your respect, will place you in check
I will strangle your neck, and you'll still bang my cassette
And I ain't threatenin', that's just how it is
You need to be more like Mrs. Markie and get the fuck out the Biz

[Hook]

Uh, yo yo check it out, yo
[Louis Logic]
When I'm comin' down the home stretch, sudden death rules in effect
With no rep', that's the type of fight that you can expect
Cause I'm flier than stupid insects, ya'll bang on the ground
So if you're still hangin' around it's with a noose on your neck
[R-Son]
If the prospect of lynchin' causes tension on the surface
The purpose of this word is to make you nervous
And when the paranoia sets in, it'll make your head spin
Clairvoyantly reading your thoughts like Kreskin
[Louis Logic]
And I got a plan for your dissection and a fresh blade scissor
To remove your breastplate quicker
Understand I could kill y'all with a rhyme
So you best wait, mister
I'm still strong in the mind like an ex-weight lifter
[R-Son]
The best shape shifter can't mimic this
The power of logic and reason combined is limitless
That's why we left behind witnesses, to remind innocents
In our presence, the ones who survived are the penitent

[Hook]

Yeah, yeah yeah, so if you didn't know, now you know
(Now y'all motherfuckers know)
Motherfuckin' Louis Logic up in this bitch
(The original Shadow Cabinet)
You're man R-Son, aight, takin' this motherfucker over
I been tellin' y'all niggas, it's time to take this game a little more serious
Yo, J.J. Brown on the motherfuckin' boards
(Comin' through in your sleep, comin' through in your memory, it's like that, what?)Every time I leave my house, pork patrol wanna seek me out
Did I see it, did I do it? C'mon down to the station house
Chase me down, "Hey, how's that high?"
Shine the flashlight around my eyes
Every time some coward cries
They doubt that I have an alibi

[Verse 1]

It's bizarre how I got a disregard for prison bars
But it isn't hard to see why I hate the mainstream
And daydream of beating Dave Matthews with his guitar
I live to scar you with a lit cigar
If I miss the charts, I'll put a mailbomb in your Christmas card
Cause you're jealous of the fact that I'm blowing up and you're envious at heart
My true intentions are cruel intentions, new ways to hurt you with new inventions
You figure you're a star, I'll hit you with a car and flatten you down to 2 dimensions
You want me to be non-violent? It's only gonna happen on a day that I'm silent
Which isn't too often, cause I can't be sober til' you're standing over Lou's coffin
Any other time I got a beer in my hand and mysterious plans to put fear in your fam'
And so degenerates cheer for the champ of born losers, hero to weirdos and porn users
My three last shows, were fiascoes
This dude came up like, "Yo, you see that Ho?" "I dare you to grab her ass"
So I grabbed her snatch and had a fight with these three assholes
Now I'm mad at that and there's an APB
The cops kicked my ass when they came for me, like they hold a grudge
So I stood up in the courtroom and told the judge I got A.D.D

[Chorus]

I'm mischievous, I make people want to slit their wrists
A whole lot of parents and critics is all pissed at this
But they missed the gist, it's just fictitious
I'm mischievous, my songs make kids wanna slit their wrists
And now a lot of critics and parents is all mad at this
I need clearances to make appearances

Warning, take caution, keep out of children's reach
Cause I spill a speech of bad will to teach
And let the psychos fill the streets
A lot of criminals wanna kill police, steal the keys and set the villains free
You better listen kids cause I'm mischievous, so keep out of children's reach


[Verse 2]

(Oh no!) I'ma ruin your whole show, stumble on the stage drunk moving in slow-mo
Cause you wouldn't know dope, even if you would've sold coke or tried to steal Louis' whole flow
Folks now better than to try and diss
I'll put you in a choke-hold, I'm childish
I'll poke holes in your car tires with my bare hands and sharpened appliances
Cause I'm a product of my environment, so I can't be blamed if my rhymes are violent
Cause every time I'm in silence, asleep, sick thoughts creep in behind my eyelids
Rhymes aside skip the dissin' nonsense, we about to have a real pissin' contest
You think I wouldn't let my pee soak your every seam till you weigh as much as Heavy D?
It's a fact misery loves company, and lung disease would work wonderfully
So I teach little kids to smoke, shit it's just a joke and it sounds like fun to me
It's as easy as 1,2,3
Come on up to the roof and then jump with me
And when they scrape you up from the street, instead of doing dirt, you'll be buried underneath
From the kids in the projects robbing stores, to the burbs where they steal from the shopping malls
It ain't a MC who don't respect me, so don't get testy
Y'all haven't got the balls

[Chorus]

I'm mischievous, I make people want to slit their wrists
A whole lot of parents and critics is all pissed at this
But they missed the gist, it's just fictitious
I'm mischievous, my songs make kids wanna slit their wrists
And now a lot of critics and parents is all mad at this
I need clearances to make appearances

Warning, take caution, keep out of children's reach
Cause I spill a speech of bad will to teach
And let the psychos fill the streets
A lot of criminals wanna kill police, steal the keys and set the villains free
You better listen kids cause I'm mischievous, so keep out of children's reach

[Verse 3]

When you're slumping guys till ya lump they eyes
Up to a pumpkin's size they're like, "Oh no!"
A whole lot of husbands would give me a snuffing if they knew who I'm fucking like, "Oh no!"
If you drank so much that you don't react to an oak-wood bat across your bony back
And wake up, looking in your wallet and you don't see jack it's like, "Oh no!"

Every time I leave my house, pork patrol want to seek me out
Did I see it, did I do it? Come on down to the station house
Chase me down, "Hey, how's that high?"
Shine the flashlight around my eyes
Every time some coward cries
They doubt that I have an alibiVerse 1:

I awoke unaware in a fog of whiskey
Wrapped inside a coat from the hair of
The dog that bit me
I was lost and dizzy
And still feeling awfully pissy
When I noticed my alarm had missed me
God forgive me or at least my boss
With all this nausea in me I just need time off
In a big way, which sucks
Because much to my dismay
I just used up all my sick days
Oh I wish they made a quicker fix
To deal with the way the liquor sticks
When it hits your lips
Which isn't a bit as quick
As the wise-cracks, oohs and grunts
Hit the lips of your homies
When you lose your lunch
Or you kiss a chick
Whose size of skirt and intimate undergarments
Indicate that she likes dessert
I'm sick of it
I only wish the guys at Merck
Would find a cure
To keep me sipping fine liqueur
For every time I had to drive to work late
Let 'em line 'em up like every night's my birthday
The first taste is great
Twice the same
The third makes lightning rain and the earth shakes

Chorus:

Tonight's a game while tomorrow is harassment
Say goodbye to shame
Sayonara embarrassment
It's nice to drain a bottle with arrogance
And never think twice again when you wanna
Wallow in merriment
I wish they made a morning after pill
So I wouldn't have to feel like such an a*shole still
When I swig from every booze on the shelf
Until I've had my fill to the gills and make a
Fool of myself
You wouldn't smell like a liquor distillery
Relief would be as easy and quick as a pill in me
One dash of aspirin, a lick of senility
And you'd slip from the grip of humility

Verse 2:

Three cheers for beer and forever
Steering clear of the car crash that
Always seems to come with your bar tab
Cause cognac should come with a hard hat
Just for when your flight nosedives and you
Run into tarmac
You gotta be a sharp tack to stick around
Sitting on a stool sipping stout til your lips are brown
First knock the Guinness out and switch to Murphey's
Beer gut stuffed like we're twisted turkeys
It's a hurt piece to kick your work week
Off by feeling lost with a wish for mercy
Search me while you find a kid that's thirsty
Who didn't know his woe was prescription worthy
Kids from Jersey who cross the bridge and New York
Is boozed like abused foster kids
And we all could use a cure for this
So get in line for a better life at your doctor's offices
For every time I made a scene in public
Let 'em line the bar with Jim Beam and club mix
And never mind the life of pain that
You might sustain should you
Forget to buy your miracle drug fix

Chorus:

Tonight's a game while tomorrow is harassment
Say goodbye to shame
Sayonara embarrassment
It's nice to drain a bottle with arrogance
And never ever think twice again when you
Wallow in merriment
I wish they made a morning after pill
So I wouldn't have to feel like such an asshole still
When I swig from every booze on the shelf
Until I've had my fill to the gills and make a
Fool of myself
You never smell like a liquor distillery
Relief would be as easy and quick as a pill in me
One dash of aspirin, a lick of senility
And you'd never have to live with humility

Outro:

I wish they made a morning after pill
So I wouldn't have to feel like such an asshole still
When I swig from every booze on the shelf
Until I've had my fill to the gills and make a
Fool of myself
You wouldn't smell like a liquor distillery
Relief would be as easy and quick as a pill in me
One dash of aspirin, a lick of senility
And you'd never have to live with humility*footsteps*

When I rock the style got the hottest style
Come off the head and blast like lead projectiles
Ya not safe in ya neighborhood like I'm a pedophile
With a van of a man, I - kill all of my fans cuz I'm paranoid
And think that they might turn into a Stan
(Jesus Christ!!) shut up, your makin my ears hurt
You'd probably sell your little sister for an Apathy T-shirt (it's true!)

Body-slam, crack ya back like Wrestlemania (ohh!)
You're just poor white trash with a Charles Bronson mustache (haa!)
I'll beat your ass and take your bus-pass
I'm that bully at lunch that'll snatch ya cash
To avoid my wrath you probably cut class (yeah)
Your the type to fuck an ugly bitch and bust fast
I'll leave you gaspin like you ate Anthrax and mustard gas (ahh!)
Word up son, I'm battlin forces
I'm "made from the best stuff on Earth", a rapper Snapple endorses
And even for little weird kids
I still find time to throw a +Root Beer+ in they +Fridge+

And I leave you on the run from the cops, and the feds
For tryin to fuck around with any rhyme that I said (ahh!)
Your a biter, I'll strike you with a brand new lighter
And slash ya fuckin face with the claws of a tiger
I'd outwrite ya, and outshine ya (kick it!!)
And take ya wife out and wine and dine her (oh-hoo!)
But I don't need to do that to get the pussy
Cuz I know her legs are bushy, and I ain't tryna fuck her (ohh!)
I'll stuff a fuckin trucker in a duffel bag
Then I'll snuff his ass, fuckin fag! You should know better (ooh!)
Cuz Louis Logical, put you in a nightclub sweater
I would fuck you up, but I like hoes better (ah-ha!)
You better escape before I'm settin the date
To desicrate your face and leave you in a resting place (ah-ha!)
So let's just say, that I'm the man of the hour
With an unbelievable power to put a golden shower
Right over ya dome -- and have every motherfucker I don't like
Pissed off, while I'm soakin ya clothes (I LOVE YOU!)

Wrap your dead body up in a Cardigan coat (oh my God!)

Molest your mom while you off in a gay prom wearin a cumberbund!!

You couldn't kick verses if you played soccer, with a Bible
I'm so vital I'll play your vital organs at church
This is the last time I let 'em come off the dome, so search
On the internet and find 800 different records with my name on it!
