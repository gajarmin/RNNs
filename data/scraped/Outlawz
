[Intro: 2Pac]
I ain't got no motherfucking friends
That's why I fucked your bitch you fat motherfucker
West Side, Bad Boy killers
You know who the realest is
We bring it too
Take money, take money

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Lil' Cesar go ask you homie how I'll leave you
Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces
Now be deceased
Little Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
So fuck peace
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride the night
Bad Boys murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get your caps peeled
You know

[Hook: 2Pac]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Who shot me, but your punks didn't finish
Now you about to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga I hit em up

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Check this out
You motherfuckers know what time it is
I don't know why I'm even on this track
You all niggas ain't even on my level
I'm going to let my little homies
Ride on you bitch-made ass Bad Boys bitches

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Get out the way, yo, get out the way, yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Moo' pass the Mac
And let me hit em in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right
For setting traps
Little accident-murderer
And I ain't never heard of you
Poisonous gats attack when I'm serving you
Spank you, shank your whole style when I gank
Guard your rank, cause I'm a slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm running through, nigga
And I'm smoking Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready-power tucked in my Guess
Under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour
I push packages every hour, I hit em up

[Hook: 2Pac]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Peep how we do it
Keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas getting killed with your mouths open
Trying to come up off of me, you in the clouds hoping
Smoking dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talking about you getting money
But it's funny to me
All you niggas living bummy
Why you fucking with me?
I'm a self-made millionaire!
Thug livin', out of prison
Pistols in the air
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
5 shots couldn't drop me: I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker I'll hit em up

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
I'm from N-E-W Jers'
Where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees
Copping pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click looting, shooting and polluting your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique moving up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
And all your fake ass East coast props
Brainstormed and locked

[Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]
You's a beat biter
A Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke. We ain't no motherfucking joke
Thug Life, niggas better be known
Be approaching in the wide open, gun smoking
No need for hoping, it's a battle lost
I got em crossed as soon as the funk is bopping off
Nigga, I hit em up!

[Outro: 2Pac]
Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressing up trying to be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob when we always on our job?
We millionaires, killing ain't fair but somebody got to do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep: you wanna fuck with us
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or something
You're fucking with me, nigga
You fuck around and catch a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that want to bring it, bring it
But we ain't singing, we bringing drama
Fuck you and your motherfucking mama
We're gonna kill all you motherfuckers
Now when I came out, I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth with a motherfucking opinion
Well this is how we gonna do this
Fuck Mobb Deep, fuck Biggie
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label and as a motherfucking crew
And if you want to be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too
Chino XL: fuck you too
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too (Take money, take money)
All of y'all mother fuckers, fuck you, die slow, motherfucker
My .44 make sure all y'all kids don't grow
You motherfuckers can't be us or see us
We motherfuckin' Thug Life-riders
Westside til we die
Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya
We'll bomb on you motherfuckers. We do our job
You think you mob? Nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob
Ain't nothing but killers and the real niggas
All you motherfuckers feel us
Our shit goes triple and 4-quadruple
You niggas laugh cause our staff got guns under they motherfuckin' belts
You know how it is, when we drop records they felt
You niggas can't feel it, we the realest
Fuck em, we Bad Boy-killers[Intro]
Makaveli in this, Killuminati all through your body
Blows like a 12-gauge shotty, feel me
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh

[Hook]
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-lalala

[Verse 1]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggas coming for me, through my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention: bless me please Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams, in the dark, evil lurks
Enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip; never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wasting
Instutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble: we ballin'
Catch me father please, cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy I hear ya callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live but I got nothing to lose
Just me and you on a one way trip to prison
Selling drugs, we all wrapped up in this living life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doing their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thugging eternal through my heart: now Hail Mary nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kastro]
They got a APB out on my thug family
Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me: thug-living, getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs

[Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever and that mothafucka
Nasty new street slugger, my heat seeks suckers
On the regular, mashing in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, 60 seconds til the draw that's when I'm deadin' ya feet first
You've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preaching church, I gave you love, now you eating dirt
Needing work and I ain't the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond: when I was broke I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up to all my niggas: get your pay and weight up

[Bridge: Kadafi]
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate

[Hook]

[Prince Ital Joe]
We've been traveling on this weary road
Sometimes life can take a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet, Hail Mary
We won't worry, everything well curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything well curry
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty, Hail Mary

[Outro]
Westside. Outlawz. Makaveli the Don. Solo. Killuminati. The 7 Days{Crowd noise and unintelligible muttering that many falsely believe is "Suge shot me"}

[Intro: Press Release]
In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur
Has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli"
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist's
Street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well
Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac -
Excuse me - Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep
Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release
The question everybody wants to know is:
Why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac - rather Makaveli
Was not available for comment, but released this statement:

[2Pac]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches, power and money. riders and punks Which side are you on?
*gunshots*, *followed by several encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fucking talking?
You niggas still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for you cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz)
Solo Shit, Bring it!

[Verse 1: 2Pac/Makaveli]
Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes cause they breed freely, see me ride!
Located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Colder than a dope fiend's titty
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, know what I mean?
I hit the scene, niggas ducking from my guillotine stare
Right there, my every word, a fucking nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs: down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in them
Cut them down, to hell is where we send them
My whole team: trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me: a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep: nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay
West coast rider, coming right behind you
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog is free, bomb first

[Hook: 2Pac / Makaveli]
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider before you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'mma bomb first
WE!!! Bomb first when we ride
PLEASE!!! Reconsider before you die
We ain't even come here to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'mma bomb first

[Verse 2: E.D.I. Mean]
For so many days, in so many ways, we've been ducking strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nothing to lose, I got nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause
Yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'mma leave this bitch
Yo, I'm dying with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a motherfucking Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made "Paparazzi"
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfucking cash, mane
Then what is your motherfucking purpose? None can serve us
E.D.I. Mean born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, bitch

[Pac]:
BIATCH!
(whispering)
Shoot....first...then we ride[x2]
(talking)
Hey get that nigga

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Your style wack as ever like you was rocking patent leather
Causing massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin
You're telling fairy tales, dunn
"King of New York" like you the motherfucking one?
But I'm from Jers' and we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks, all my niggas flipping chips
Getting rich even though it's hard
Trying to creep through these halls and brawls
Without scarred by a revolve
With no warning signs, cause yo, my man took 5
Now I'm the young one with the 9 ready to put in my time

[Outro: 2Pac/Makaveli]
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider before you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first

(Start of "Hail Mary")
Let us pray my niggas
For we have definitely sinned[2Pac]
A military mind, nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind, nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know

[Hook: 2Pac - repeat 2X]
We tradin war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

[2Pac]
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday
And fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Moms sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Hits fall, we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of niggas strapped sippin on 'nac (Cognac)
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin till I die, these streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin'
Fat as that ass that honey shakin

[Hook] w/ Outlawz

[Kastro]
I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga;
Gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all these
Playa hatin niggas position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat people I'm tryin to tell you

[Edi Amin]
Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin greenery
Considered a B.G., but I'm off in this game somethin D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And why I do it - the ridin and smokin
Collidin with foes - in the worst place;
Y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us, in the first place
Y'all real O.G.'s, droppin game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk cause
Y'all be the next in the long line of war stories

[Hook]

[C-Bo]
I breaks them off with this gangsta war story tale
Stacking loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumping insane
Call me Bo-wl of Major Pain, gun-slang and moving 'caine
I be the nigga that's pulling the trigger and dumping the hollow points in your brain
More bigger balls than RuPaul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
Never been no sign for men call
How we bucks them down on the way to the ground
Ain't nothing but the hog in me
Bust off his dildo, killin up hoes and keep mobbin G
It ain't no calling the funk off
Don't be funking with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
And had them bitch niggas hauled off

[Hook]

[Napoleon]
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscing, and catchin flashbacks when niggas ran up
In my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
Thugging Immortal, got some war stories for you

[Storm]
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawing from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure
Cause the murderous tendencies of my mind can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would you try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got you on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin to God as your life goes back and forth
We tradin war stories

[Hook]

[2Pac talking]
War stories nigga; hahaha, what players do
Thug Life, Outlaw Immortalz
Motherfucking 2Pac a.k.a. Makaveli
Can you feel me?
Just so you know, it's on Death Row
My niggas love that shit
Dramacydal in this motherfucker, heheheh
Yea nigga! Shout out to my niggas Fatal and Felony
C-Bo, the bald head nut, what?
You know what time it is[2Pac]
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin?
Tell me nigga.. tell me
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin?

[Hook: 2Pac]
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin
Bustin, my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin, now I'm the last motherfucker breathin

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Woke up with fifty enemies plottin my death
All fifty seein visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest, nah nigga I was stressed
Had me creepin 'round corners, homie sleepin in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block, call the cops
A thug nigga screamin west side, bustin double Glocks
Hittin corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got me drivin up on the curb, hand on the steerin wheel swervin
Bless me Father I'mma sinner, I'm livin in hell
Just let me live on the streets, cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin world-wide exposure
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a FUCK, ridin as my soldiers
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside Outlaw; Bad Boy killer, huh
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin
I murdered all them bustas now I'm the last motherfucker breathin

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
For all my soldiers gone, we burnin the earth
Outlawz WORLDWIDE, we pack the block
Shootin rocks at the kid, I'll bust back for 'Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here
Stale down here, too many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me?
Young Noble, Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me
I'm still breathin

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
Now we was raised, "Fuck this life," I rose my right
Holdin on a tight grip with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleepwalkin as a true
Walk around town with a pound full of, bitter food
Came a long way from my born day, dead away where there's war play
Fuck friends I'll say, rather die for my A-K
With these fag-ass niggas, see-through glass ass niggas
Only ride my dick and the skin of my mash-ass niggas
Breathin!

[Hook: 2Pac]

[Verse 4: Kastro]
Uhh, I walk around with a knife in my back
Talkin bout a bad day, I live a life like that
It's severe, and I'm losin my hair, blastin hooligans
Catch me, I'm fallin out flat, yo I'm ruined and
Breathin in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me
I learned to like it like that, when I was still in mommy
The side of seedy that the devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still I'm breathin!

[Verse 5: E.D.I.]
And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest na'r one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one motherfucker bout to do it again
Shit, 'Pac still doin it, you hoes can't ruin it
Two million everytime he drop I know you fuckers losin it
We movin in - for the kill, for a meal, holdin steel
Hold the wheel I'm bout to give these niggas somethin they can feel
Fakin real, but we the raw and uncut
Style-bitin thug lyin niggas, give it up!
We hit 'em up (and we still breathin.. and we still breathin..)

[Hook]

[Outro: 2Pac]
Tell 'em nigga.. tell 'em
(and we still breathin..)
Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin?Y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured
And just looked at the whole situation
Cause once you look at it
You know
(really do)

They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us

Thuggin' till the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
And when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

[2Pac]
Some say niggas is hard headed cause we love to trick
Equipped with game so we bang with this thuggish shit
I see you trying to hide
Hoping that nobody don't notice
You must always remember you're still a member of the hopeless
See you're black like me
So you snap like me
When these devils try to plot
Trap our young black seeds
Look it
Cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin'
Lookin' for role models
Our father figures is basers
Some say they expect Illuminati take my body to sleep
Niggas at the party with they shotties
Just as rowdy as me
Before I fear computer chips
I gotta deal with brothers flippin'
I don't see no devils bleedin'
Only black blood drippin'
We can change
Whatcha mouth say?
I'm watchin' niggas work their lives out without pay (huh)
Whatever it takes to switch places with the busters on top
I'm bustin' shots make the world stop
They don't give a fuck about us

[Hook]

[EDI]
It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did cause they saying you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons dawg
I don't doubt you
See the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed (uh-huh)
Not including yourself
All you want is what they perceiving as greed
So as you loaded up that mack and continue to buck 'em
I was on paper
Thinking they don't give a fuck about us

[2Pac]
I'm seeing it clearer
Hating the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior
So why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watching my nation die genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath
The aftermath is y'alls
I told ya last album, we need help cause we dying
Give us a chance, help us advance cause we trying
Ignore my whole plea, watching us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They don't give a fuck about us

[Hook x2]

[Kastro]
Now all my homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply
Now that's love
Shit
Nobody else could give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down
Six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong
How long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song
Ain't gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame 'em?
Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck
I don't
Feel what I'm saying?

[Kadafi]
Now thug niggas die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic
Or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times
We busted like bubbles
With the police
This nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Man I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain
So I spent your time in poor and working
I see no reason
So I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinking that they give a fuck?

[Napolean]
You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga you're lying
Cause half of my niggas, long gone, buried in the dirt just for trying
Sometimes I think my block is dying
And that it's awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't change that all fool
I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
While I'm layin' in the coffin
The shit comes around so often
So tell me something
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
Nigga I been so through pain go through the struggle
Doin' the same thing you did at my age and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin'
Well since you don't give a fuck
I be frontin'
And I'mma drink my Hennessey like it ain't nothin'

[Outro (variation of the hook) x2]

They wanna see us die, they kick us every time we try
They don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm getting high, I'm watching as the world goes by
Cause they don't give a fuck about us[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Sometimes it's hard, to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
Cause they seein' destruction before they see a human bein'
So they start smokin', we will never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cuz they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, somebody else should try
Cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen a change unfold
I'll keep hopin' please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need, of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

[Verse 2: Eminem]
We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate
Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes
You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes
But we ain't, its grain to go against
With every artist comes the image he portrays and the picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you heard me say
I'm a gangster and I ain't hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day, the game, will never be the same
No matter how much fame and success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive

[2Pac]
And we continue growin', one day at a time

[Verse 3: Outlawz]
Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and lights
Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest
There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'
And the kids think beef, is they only option
Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories took a dive, my Machiavelli lives on
You think the industry is fun, and no pity with guns
And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died, and came back, would he try to save rap
We needin' a change, the drama remains the same
I spend my whole life, fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
And hey now then, I take rights and no lefts
I'm still, just like a kid, lookin for stripes on my belt
Yeah, that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself
No matter how much I try, stay alive, I'ma die a man
Still standin' and in love with my pride
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income comin' in and collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realize that we're not in the same game
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them .45's will pop killas, yes I'm still with it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind

[2Pac]
And we continue growin', one day at a time, damnBOOK 1

[Kastro & Napoleon]
We goin all out (aiiiite)
We goin all out (aiiiite)
We goin all out, watch ya motherfuckin mouth niggas
(That's right, fuck these fag niggas)
Do it, do it, do it

[2Pac]
Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brand as my strap
Back like a cobra, I stay drunk, cause I'm a mad man
Whenever sober, on a one man mission
My ambition's to hold up the rap game
While I pluck holes in niggas like donuts
And still down to die for all my souljas
Like hillbillies, they don't fear me
So refuse bringin' war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of dirty niggas, who all got me
While bitches wonderin' who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin' sluggs like Muammar Gadaffi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper, bustin caps to Jay-Z
(buck buck buck buck buck buck)
And still avoid capture, while y'all caught up in the rapture
Still after me, I'm in Jamaica sippin' daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin' nothin', then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug-nigga, that my old man wasn't
I came to a field, catchin' cases, litigation
Niggas playa-hatin', got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin DEATH ROW, throw my WESTSIDE, ain't no thang
We was raised off drive-by's, brought up to bang
We claim mob, M.O.B. if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this, I'm hard to kill, when I peel with this live spot
Father, how the hell did I survive, these five shots?
Live it up, or give it up, and my demons
Late night, hear them screamin; we goin' all out!

[Hook: EDI]
We goin all out, bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle ya own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga go all out
Bustas playin with ya peeps, betta go all out
Try'na see the next day, nigga go all out
Obstacles in ya way, you better go all out

[Napoleon]
I'm on my land sled, walkin through the belly of the beast
Feelin like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, that we mobb niggas hidin' in bushes
Claimin that they ride rough, but they soft as they cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers, I'd die for these thuggs
Say hi to this slug, it's a shame how some niggas on the west coast
Was ridin with Pac, but when he died, they went pop
I'm on the Jers to the fullest, like some west coast love
But after Pac stopped rappin, it ain't no west coast thug
Just westcoast what? To my real niggas stuck in the street game
Cause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin Kool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what I'm sayin? Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo-fo put peek holes through your door
I ride or die, but these other fag niggas be bitin this
It's all from my heart when I was writin this
All out

[Hook]

[Kastro]
Now, we all ride, and down to die who wit us
Speak up, or get treated like you comin to kill us
Ain't nothin but squealers, in this rap game, swearin they rough
Tattooed up, and now them niggas swearin they Pac
Stop that, and watch ya back, we ain't forgot bout cha
These Glocks hot, and when shot, it'll bring the bitch up out cha
It's me, Kastro with the goattee
Walkin' like a OG, cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
I pray to the thug lord, like that motherfuckers holy
Frontline soulja, till the heavens call me
I go all out, and if you real, you real
Feel what I'm talkin' bout, cause this game is ill
I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'till they feel it
Livin' proof, Pac breed niggas, they can't deal wit'
Holla back, right back, and watch ya mouth
Or get blood in it, WHAT, we goin' all out
Nigga

[Hook] - 2X

Fool, you better go all out
Keep goin' all out
All my niggas goin' all out
Without a muthafuckin' doubt

[EDI talking]
Ey, you niggas just gon think that you gon be uhh
Talkin and slippin on all of these motherfuckin records
And we ain't gon say shit, now it's 1999
It's a different grind, don't disrespect the Don
It's still war motherfuckers
So let's see you act like you know[2Pac]
I feel you {uhh} (baby don't)
But you can't, you can't give up
{Hey, 2Pac what?}

[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {Outlawz}
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {Keep ya head up}

[2Pac]
Now here's a story bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
"What would you do if it was you?"
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain, Lord come and take me
Four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
Cause they win when your soul dies

[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby please don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {never give up}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {never give up}
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry

[Edi Amin]
Uhh
Forget him girl (forget him girl) he ain't gon' never change
I ain't no hater but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
Everyday, his mind on gettin' mo' (gettin mo')
And never your feelings, he's chasin' millions fo' sho'
Uh oh (uh oh), now you bout to have his baby? (dayamn)
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much, mo', livin' to do - I'm spittin' this to you
Cause you deserve more than what he givin' to you (that's right)
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she
Got em all stuck standin' still when she come through
Baby take a little mo' time, love'll find you
And sho' as the sky's blue somebody other than me
Gon' give you everything you need, feel me?
{Don't cry-ahhhhh..}

[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {you'll be alright}
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {you'll be alright}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {keep your head up}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {never give up}
Even when the road is hard, never give up {no no.. ohhhh}
Baby don't cry

[Young Noble]
I'm tryin' to do all that I can, from jump
Now you losin', you was choosin' the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you? (Damn)
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homey roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her, Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those, ain't my seeds, nuttin really I could do (nah)
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Shoulda chose me, she bout to O.D. from the pressure
Hell nah I won't let her {BABY DON'T CRY}

[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {you'll be alright}
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {baby don't cry}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {baby baby baby}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {no..}
Even when the road is hard, never give up {no-ohhhh}
Baby don't cry, I gotta keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {ooooh baby}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {keep your head up}
{keep your head up, never give up}
Even when the road is hard, never give up, baby don't cry

[Young Noble]
Uhh, uhh, yeah, don't give up {you'll be alright}
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up, baby don't cry

[Edi Amin]
For all the ladies {Soulshock, Karlin}
Baby don't cry
Got to keep your head up {keep your head up}
Makaveli lives on {head up} aight?[Intro]
Sup lil' homie
Hold your head up man
Ball or fall
You know what it is
See it amongst us..
That's right
Walk strong

[Verse 1: Stic.Man]
Homie hold your head up, no matter what be strong
No sleep, Keep it G, cause' it's always on
It be hard everyday comin' up in the street
Feelin' stuck, that's why niggas don't give a fuck
But you can't let the struggle eat away at your soul
There's an end to the tunnel, there's a way out the hole
Gotta stay in control for your role and be thankful
Vow for the pleasures of life and when it's painful
The pressure and stress, don't let it break you
The blessings that come, don't let em' change you
Stay on top of your gangsta
Without struggle there is no progress
Be conscious and never lose faith in the process
Even when we jobless and homeless we full of potential
If nothin' else have hope
The struggle continues[x2]

[Hook:  X2]
It may be difficult
But it's not impossible
There's only two ways to go
Ball or Fall
Though it be difficult
I know that it's possible
There's only two ways to go
Ball or Fall

[Verse 2: ?]
Suffer me this opportunity
To try to bring the people unity
Can't you see the life of you and me is bout' to come up
Self preservation and my family
Role model is daddy, slack back caddy
Goin all out
God bless the child that hold his own
Operatin under thug lawz renown
Its on hustle fo' your paper
Soldier ball never fall
Keep your focus in your faith
And it's all the war

[Verse 3: ?]
Look here
All you gotta do dawg is hold your head
Keep your mind focused, move forward instead
Instead of lettin' all that little shit get in the way
All that bitchin' and complainin' ain't gon' get you paid
Yeah it might seem hard at first
Put your faith in him and he gon' put you through the worst of times
And just when it seem like it ain't gon' get better
He gon' be there with you through the stormiest weather

[Hook]

[Verse 4: M-1]
Life
Hell of a struggle, it's a spiral not a cycle (lyff?)
You know what's good, don't let the man get by
You better keep score, there's a low and there's a higher role
You in the red, put your life on the wire
Gotta hang tight, keep your pimp game tight
You could lose it all, and get it back the same night
But if you ain't in the game, there's no way you can win the game
That's on my African name, it ain't gon' end the same

[Verse 5: Young Noble]
Look Pac' been gone for twelve years now
The Lawz still here, we never slowed down
No matter how rough it got
There never was a option for a nigga to stop
Please God, just give me a little sign
Try not to lose faith, but I'm down to my last dime
And my son keep cryin' like he missin' the paps
He too young to understand that the bills don't stop
And I'll be damned if a lil' man struggle like we did
Free lunches at the church, cause there's nothin' in the fridge
Can a nigga just live? Naw you gotta hustle mang
Tryin' to bundle in this never ending struggle mang
I know God gon' get me through it
Got me feelin' like FUCK the music
It's hell for hustlers, they'd rather see me jailed and cuffed
But I'd rather stay focused, than not have enough

[Hook][2Pac]
Searching for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin jewels and shit, yaknahmean?
(Black Jesus; you can be Christian
Baptist, Jehovah Witness)
Straight tatted up, no doubt, no doubt
(Islamic, won't matter to me
I'm a thug; thugs, we praise Black Jesus, all day)
Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off nigga..
What?

[Kadafi]
I do my shootin's on a knob, prayin to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
Like I'm jailin, shots hittin up my spot like midnight rains hailin
Got me bailin to stacks more green; Gods ain't tryin to be trapped
On no block slangin no rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
Gods words all cursed like crack
Shai-tan's way of gettin us back
Or just another one of my Black JesuS traps

[Storm]
Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin up in silence
Dark prayer, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
Cause I swear, they tryin to break my well
I'm on the edge lookin down at this volatile pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus

[Hook: 2Pac]
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus

[Young Noble]
Outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
Rebellin against the system, commence to lynchin
The President ain't even listenin to the pain of the youth
We make music for eternity, forever the truth
Political prisoner, the two choices that they givin us
Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin new
In school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true
Black Jesus

[2Pac]
To this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggas pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggas play together
We die clutchin' glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wishes niggas smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin', hopin' for possibilities
I'll mob on, while they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hatin' the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin' to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast 'til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin Black Jesus

[Hook]

[Kastro]
Some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
Trapped, black, scarred and barred
Searching for truth, where it's hard to find God
I play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer
Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties
Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums
This ain't livin... Jesus

{*singers repeat in background 3X*}
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!

Searchin for Black Jesus
It's hard, it's hard
We need help out here
So we searchins for Black Jesus
It's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect, you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt
Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we coming from
That's who we pray to
We need help y'all{Crowd noise and unintelligible muttering that many falsely believe is "Suge shot me"}

[Intro: Press Release]
In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur
Has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli"
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist's
Street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well
Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac -
Excuse me - Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep
Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release
The question everybody wants to know is:
Why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac - rather Makaveli
Was not available for comment, but released this statement:

[2Pac]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches, power and money. riders and punks Which side are you on?
*gunshots*, *followed by several encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fucking talking?
You niggas still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for you cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz)
Solo Shit, Bring it!

[Verse 1: 2Pac/Makaveli]
Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes cause they breed freely, see me ride!
Located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Colder than a dope fiend's titty
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, know what I mean?
I hit the scene, niggas ducking from my guillotine stare
Right there, my every word, a fucking nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs: down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in them
Cut them down, to hell is where we send them
My whole team: trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me: a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep: nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay
West coast rider, coming right behind you
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog is free, bomb first

[Hook: 2Pac / Makaveli]
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider before you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'mma bomb first
WE!!! Bomb first when we ride
PLEASE!!! Reconsider before you die
We ain't even come here to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'mma bomb first

[Verse 2: E.D.I. Mean]
For so many days, in so many ways, we've been ducking strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nothing to lose, I got nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause
Yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'mma leave this bitch
Yo, I'm dying with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a motherfucking Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made "Paparazzi"
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfucking cash, mane
Then what is your motherfucking purpose? None can serve us
E.D.I. Mean born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, bitch

[Pac]:
BIATCH!
(whispering)
Shoot....first...then we ride[x2]
(talking)
Hey get that nigga

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Your style wack as ever like you was rocking patent leather
Causing massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin
You're telling fairy tales, dunn
"King of New York" like you the motherfucking one?
But I'm from Jers' and we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks, all my niggas flipping chips
Getting rich even though it's hard
Trying to creep through these halls and brawls
Without scarred by a revolve
With no warning signs, cause yo, my man took 5
Now I'm the young one with the 9 ready to put in my time

[Outro: 2Pac/Makaveli]
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider before you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first

(Start of "Hail Mary")
Let us pray my niggas
For we have definitely sinned[2Pac]
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin?
Tell me nigga.. tell me
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin?

[Hook: 2Pac]
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin
Bustin, my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin, now I'm the last motherfucker breathin

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Woke up with fifty enemies plottin my death
All fifty seein visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest, nah nigga I was stressed
Had me creepin 'round corners, homie sleepin in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block, call the cops
A thug nigga screamin west side, bustin double Glocks
Hittin corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got me drivin up on the curb, hand on the steerin wheel swervin
Bless me Father I'mma sinner, I'm livin in hell
Just let me live on the streets, cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin world-wide exposure
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a FUCK, ridin as my soldiers
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside Outlaw; Bad Boy killer, huh
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin
I murdered all them bustas now I'm the last motherfucker breathin

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
For all my soldiers gone, we burnin the earth
Outlawz WORLDWIDE, we pack the block
Shootin rocks at the kid, I'll bust back for 'Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here
Stale down here, too many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me?
Young Noble, Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me
I'm still breathin

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
Now we was raised, "Fuck this life," I rose my right
Holdin on a tight grip with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleepwalkin as a true
Walk around town with a pound full of, bitter food
Came a long way from my born day, dead away where there's war play
Fuck friends I'll say, rather die for my A-K
With these fag-ass niggas, see-through glass ass niggas
Only ride my dick and the skin of my mash-ass niggas
Breathin!

[Hook: 2Pac]

[Verse 4: Kastro]
Uhh, I walk around with a knife in my back
Talkin bout a bad day, I live a life like that
It's severe, and I'm losin my hair, blastin hooligans
Catch me, I'm fallin out flat, yo I'm ruined and
Breathin in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me
I learned to like it like that, when I was still in mommy
The side of seedy that the devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still I'm breathin!

[Verse 5: E.D.I.]
And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest na'r one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one motherfucker bout to do it again
Shit, 'Pac still doin it, you hoes can't ruin it
Two million everytime he drop I know you fuckers losin it
We movin in - for the kill, for a meal, holdin steel
Hold the wheel I'm bout to give these niggas somethin they can feel
Fakin real, but we the raw and uncut
Style-bitin thug lyin niggas, give it up!
We hit 'em up (and we still breathin.. and we still breathin..)

[Hook]

[Outro: 2Pac]
Tell 'em nigga.. tell 'em
(and we still breathin..)
Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin?[Intro]
My home boys might squabble but we don't fall down (x3)
(Westside, westside)
Part two of the war

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Cross this nigga here, now Biggie tell me who do you fear?
Ain't a living soul breathing shall I pump no fear here
My last four flashed then I mashed his ass
Bastard, fuck with me, bet I blast your ass
So many follow but can't reach me, caught in a maze
Catch them, mimicking my style trying to walk this way
Impossible my posse dropping you, we Death Row riders
No need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us
Feeling blessed, the richer I get, the more I stress
Smoking lye watching time fly, waiting for death
Dear God I been feeling like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my pistols close, smoking trees
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me
Watching niggas catch strays, shake, choke and bleed
Me, a mercenary for the streets, check my pedigree
Busting motherfuckers it's the thug in me
Now niggas talk a lotta Bad Boy shit, then get to squealing
Bitch made catching feelins

[Hook x2]
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screaming bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catching feelins

[Verse 2: Kadafi]
Picture me sipping on 1-5-1
Drunk then a motherfucker dropping my gun
Or high as a kite hitting hoes for fun
But that ain't me, dog, my mind's now clear
And that ain't fair, dog, your heart pump fear
In the state I ? you better hide nigga ? is near
And you know just as well I do
You ain't no killer, so kill that, you wouldn't kill if you had to
We might wobble, but we don't fall down
We take the gospel from Makaveli, pass it around
? shit, we gonna taste the power
We started the thug trend, the game is ours
Now we coast together, put our thoughts together
Won't question when we die together
Cause the hour is soon to come
Kadafi trained soldier, I show you how to use your gun
Bring it

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: ?]
We Yelling "M-A-D-E- N-I- Double G-As
Motherfuckas, and we here to stay
From curb surfing, we working the industry, you kidding me
It's really nothing to me and my king, you see
We in the big things, eat a dick man, if you're hating
We're gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off, pay attention
Screaming "Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound"
Ride or die niggas, and we hunting you down
Representing all the real niggas stuck in the trap
Banging out with the po-po, trying to get to some more
Street life, young strugglers racing the clock
Ain't no telling when it all can end, roll a rock
That's the world with feelings, this a man's world young'un
The bitches in business, so learn a little something
Hey, stop running your mouth, you're on the verge of squealing
Bitch made catching feelins

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4]
Everybody's a gangsta, but don't put in work
Instead of putting on the armor, niggas put on skirts
These drugs ain't helping, it only making it worse
And the streets ain't got nothing for me but herbs
I can't trust the church or the mobs, I can only trust God
And to tell you the truth I gotta ride
I only roll with the real
Cause rolling with the fake got my loved ones killed

[Hook x3]And my niggas say
We want the FAAAAME
C'mon c'mon

[Hook]
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to g's
Stress is half the battle with success comes greed (echo)
They got me hot When they shot me
Plotted my revenge
To increase my ends
Enemies gettin' dropped
Win or lose
Red or blue
We must all stay true
Play the game nigga
Never let the game play you
And for the fame
Niggas change fast
That's a shame
What's the game
Lost souls
Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame?
The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane
I'm hoping we can change with time
I'm living blinded
Searching for refinement
Curse, I know death follows me
But I murder him first
And worse yet
With each breathe
Steps I take
Breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes
Coaster
Crystal glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards
With my ski mask
I'm the first one to warn them
Blast it
Wrapped in plastic
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws)
Ain't nothing left now
Treated like a stepchild
Was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck em all)
Be rocking beats
Fake in fame

[Verse 2: Kadafi]
Block run and shoot slugs
We throw them back like hardballs
Without the gloves
No love for these fake desperados
And thugs I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts
Sipping Henney
Drunk nights
And hot days
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways
A wife on the run
Full of common blunts
Unconditionally married
To my gun
Fulfillin' my destiny
On knees
And ones desires
Be pulling all my cabbage like priors
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher
Fortune and fame

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Searching for fortune and fame
Lost in the rain
A lose of the game
With life the cost of the game
We forcing the change
Mother fuck flossing the chain (echo)
All the blame
Belongs to the part of the brain (echo)
That we never use nigga
Plus my heart is in pain (echo)
And if I ever lose homey
Bet I'm at it again (echo)
Outlaws don't die
So united we stand (echo)
And if family come before
All the fortune and fame
(Fortune and fame)

[Verse 4: Napoleon]
As I walk up in the crib
Laid to rest me head
Say salaam to the angels
Hope they bless my bed
Hope they bless me the righteous way
Got a homie locked down
Outta town
I sent him a kite today
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dawg
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog
I was passed down the street fame
Like Glocks clocked and keep aim
Was raised up with a clock box
And I ran with the local street gang
They say the light is faded
But still shine in the dark
You can easy been a man
But you is a boy in your heart
And that's some game that I got
From generation of game
In the road of life dog
We need to switch up lanes
Think about it

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Bad Azz]
I can't complain
I've seen my fair share of the fame
It won't change me
Now I've got this piece of change
I feel strange I got so use to the hood
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me
Ghetto ain't made me I made myself
Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help
I pray for my health my mind and my family too
State of myself my grind and my family crew
Where one hand washes the other
No we ain't blood
But we still real brothers
The struggle is real
Nothing can steal
What we build
And that remains the same
'Till that day we killed
And that's real
Life that I was aimed to be
Love by my family tree
That's fame to me
How about it

[Hook][Stormey]
Every day in life, we're presented with different roads to travel, you know?
Choices to make
At the end of the day, well, you'll figure it out

[Hook: Malachi]
How do I get by with blocks in the road?
And how did I get here at the fork in the road?
The choices I'm going by, the world is so cold
Will I be here to ever see my baby ___ grow yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Stormey]
Time tickin'
It's my ambition as a soldier
And my intention
When the ghetto ghospels you to the masses so pay attention
Young and younger for the better things in life, it's a fight
It's a struggle just to live in life, and what's right
But I'm a hustler motherfucker, ten toes in the dirt
And i'm'a grind for what it's worth, until i'm layin' in the dirt
Put in work, to get my ___ ___ ___ ___ ___
So I keep my eyes open, keep my focus and my gun up
I got too much to lose, to much of you
To be concerned about you haters, niggas leave that to you
Niggas ain't got a clue so I ask what I ask for
God got my back, and that's all that I ask for
Raised by the block, and the folks are old
They allways told me at a time, i'd come to forks in the road
I was raised by the block, and the folks are old
They allways told me at a time, i'd come to forks in the road

[Hook: Malachi]
How do I get by with blocks in the road?
And how did I get here at the fork in the road?
The choices I'm going by, the world is so cold
Will I be here to ever see my baby ___ grow?

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
I live my life as an outlaw, niggas I'm ___ ___
From the looks of me, you wouldn't know what i've been through
I done seen it all, if I ain't do it, I was steelin' ball
Knowing i'm'a answer for that, when the lord call
Tryin' to see them all, while I polish my gun
My baby's mama's new boyfriend raising my son
These young niggas comin' up, now they're worse than we was
If ain't no money splittin' up, tell 'em to ease up
Let's get rich and be kick it, I'll be in it
Matter fact scratch that, nigga i'm still in it
So don't consider this a rhyme, consider it life
To live with the verdict, the sentence is life
Me and my niggas tryin' to finish the fight, must complete the mission
We try to given them with the streets is lisenin'
That real talk so the streets will listen
Ask Malachi
I'd rather die than lose hope my nigga, we hopeless nigga

[Hook: Malachi]
How do I get by with blocks in the road?
And how did I get here at the fork in the road?
The choices I'm going by, the world is so cold
Will I be here to ever see my baby ___ grow?

[Verse 3: Kastro]
I was only 16, young nigga wantin' creamy things
28 now just to see things change
But I'm a player and I'm playin' my part
Knowin' this movie ain't mine, it's gods and he's a star
And it's a wonder how I made it this far
A million miles over in the speed of a fast car
So many choices, Why, so many choices
It's hell up in my head, I hear the devil and his voices
I'm stunm, I'm a bum I'm nothin', suicide get a gun, pull the button
Nah, that ain't me, nah, I'm god's baby
But times are kinda hard, livin' gettin' to my lately
I belive even though I ain't (better?)
My days are gettin' better, but only if I let 'em
So here I stand at this fork in the road
Gotta decide wich way I'm'a go

[Hook: Malachi]
How do I get by with blocks in the road?
And how did I get here at the fork in the road?
The choices I'm going, by the world is so cold
Will I be here to ever see my baby ... grow

[Hook: Malachi]
How do I get by with blocks in the road?
And how did I get here at the fork in the road?
The choices I'm going by, the world is so cold
Will I be here to ever see my baby ... grow?

[Stormey]

But you got to stay focussedYou a what? Bad Boy Killaz

Hahaha yeah nigga, fuck 'em all
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
Fuck all you muthafuckers

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now I can make it happen
My rappin' is similar to muthafuckers when they scrappin'
Blast and watch em' back up
Notorious biggie killer, affiliation with death row
Niggas get their caps pealed back, fool this the west coast
Bitch you misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks, that thought I quit
Then got a drop top Jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip, cause bitch I love to scrap
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga, with love niggas
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines, writing raps and movies
I went from trustin' these tricks now they all want to sue me
So fuck em' all

[Hook]
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
YOUNG NOBLE: Come put your hands up in the air
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)

[Verse 2: Kadafi]
Now could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak
Even the baddest be gettin murdered in they seats
I'm addicted to these streets
Like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison
Wake up screamin' in my sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell
Ah possibility of livin' well
But if they killin' me
I get my stripes and whose to tell
Choosing to sell
I'd rather die and be deceased
World mob figga addicted to these fucking streets

[EDI]
Now put your muthafucking hands up
If you'se a rider (Ride)
Niggas ain't killers so they hidin' (Why?)
Fuck em' all, touch em' all
That's the way that we do it
Ride up, hop the fuck out watch that bitch nigga lose it
Man I'm as strong as this game
Ya'll be knowing my name (Edi)
A young high strung thug nigga created by pain
Livin' my life in the fast lane
Gettin' fucked by the past
Got my mind on my cash and my next piece of ass
So fuck em' all

[Hook]
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
YOUNG NOBLE: Come put your hands up in the air
It's a middle finger affair, yeah

(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
YOUNG NOBLE: Nigga, we Outlaw ridah'z

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I got glad bags with enemies
Cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessey
So they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar, I'll dick em' and holla
Ridin' these hoochies like they some heavy ass, Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
For the profit pick my Glock up
I'm bustin' in self defense ya see
Poppin' nobody got em' Holla
Outlaw riders, mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene, count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers, the S.W.A.T. team and the helicopters
Them crackers is crazy (Why?)
Cause they'll never stop us
I watch Arnold Swarchzenegger bust somebody in the movie
Now I want to do it too
Ohh, ohh niggas is too through
True to the game
I claim Outlaw riders
We give a fuck what they try
I'm..

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggas for they watch and chain
Kick back lil nigga, and watch the game
Get your mobb rocked and what-not
We keep it poppin' like a drug spot
The streets know what's hot
Trust me

[Napoleon]
Even my hood call me baby Malcolm X
With the TEC's
Shower some slugs on em'
I've got a brother don't rest, and he keep some drugs on him
Always in grind mood, hustle to find food
Ever seen faces of death? That's what my nine do

[Kastro]
I keep my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
With my back against the wall
Like I'm runnin' outta time
Even rap with a gat
I must be goin' out my mind
Like I'm up against the world
This guerilla team of mine
Screamin'
Thug Life bitch, fuck 'em all
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)

Fuck With Me!

[Napolean - Verse 1]
Baby-girl, you know you put it on me
Shakin your ass in the quarter for me
It's like de-ja-vu the way I met you
You told me you and your nephew
Blow Makaveli too, but smash that boo
Cause that's a bootleg
And it was hard to take my eyes off your legs
Listen can I buy you a drink?
Let your home girl hold your mink
The dead thought made for you and me
Can you walk with me, talk with me
Or one-night stand with me, probably
The answer I can hear tonight
Hips, dick-lick the lips, bitch you goin home tonight
I'm a money-maker, just shakin that thing your momma gave you
Creamin that black heritage, I can't wait to taste ya
You got one life to live, with much to give
Don't play yourself short, Miss Thang, give it here
And what's this I hear, about you top class
That down-south ass will make me spend some cash
Now did you listen to the words I was spittin at ya?
You so much you gonna make g-star rival at ya

[Young Noble - Verse 2]
I give it to you good girl, in the heat of the night
Even when I'm rollin, cream you right
And I ain't even tryin to sleep on old girl
Millennium dime-piece she movin her own world
N-O-B-L-E, brag on his dick
I ain't tryin to lock you down, hear the slap on the wrist
And I'm the type that talks flicks, when I'm up in it
She ain't the type to throw fits when I bust in it
So what's fuckin with that
She like to lay on her stomach so I bust on her back
And I don't care if she a groupie or not
I'm gettin head on the block and the hooptie'll drop
Root-Crew been hot since back in the day
And since I knew Pac, I'm havin my way
And now you wish you would have stuck with me
Cause all your honeys wanna fuck with me
Where they at? Where they at?

[Chorus - EDI Mean]
Because I'm headin somewhere
And them other (niggas baby) (rappers gone) gonna be dead in a year
Plus, I know you tired of them fake thugs
All-be gangstaz in they video with make-up
Uh, I don't think so nigga, I'm an outlaw nigga
Hear the heat blow nigga?
Uh, then have the time of your life
One night, next day you tell them people you're my wife
Cause can't nobody do it like this
A lot of mother fuckers talkin but we true to this shit

[EDI Mean - Verse 3]
Come on, straight off the straights of hard time and no luck
Some wonderin niggas that ankled this game and came up
They ain't wanna fuck with us power to this
But we said 'fuck that' and set fire to this bitch nigga
Outlaw, just some ridahs on our own mission
The trite and true, we un-fuck-with-a-ble
It's critical, the game change, we stay the same
A lot of shit y'all doin now, I did when I was seventeen
And that's the truth if I ever heard it
Hard time, sometime, but I know it's gonna be worth this shit
We done got it together, we gonna party together
They try to stop what we doin, we give em 'Hell man whatever'
Shit this how a live nigga do it, ride or die nigga blew it
We don't try nigga, lose it
And let em know not to fuck with you
And touch your boo, bust your tooth, hush them fools

Chorus

[Kastro - Verse 4]
Uh, a big dick to stroke
I ain't braggin, I'm just lettin you know
Uh, and ever sicne you bounced on me, baby I've been ready to go
Uh, and we can keep this between us
Nut with nothin much to discuss
Uh, or we can let it out to the world
Make a boy or a girl, it's on us
Baby, I like it when you show me your tongue
Lick on my balls until I cum and yell 'stop, stop'
Uh, and when I blow on your clit
Stick my thumb where you shit, you get hot
Damn, nasty, plus you got a big old ass
That pop like a gun, go 'blast, blast'
And you think your girl was fucked
Always talkin all that jazz
So don't fuck with me
I'm not the nigga you love
I'm just the nigga you fuck
I ain't the nigga to her

Chorus[Verse 1: Outlawz]
September 13th 1996, On the Vegas strip he laid to rest
Ever since I had a hole in my chest
And it happened the one day you ain't rock your vest
Only 25 you ain't even reach your full potential
Going through your struggle with the whole world watching you
Sat by you in the hospital for 6 days straight
I'm thinking damn how much can one man take
My thug angel I won't stray you
You saved us and raised us
Homie this corner's like cages
Graced the world with your presence Ima rep it till the death of me
O-U-T-L-A-W-Z, the recipe
I'm the voice of the slum, the hope for the young
I'm the last outlaw man I know I'm the truth
I was trained by the best to carry on tradition
To carry the torch complete the mission, streets is listening
They keep axing is Pac alive
I tell em hell yea nigga you can see him in my eyes
All you gotta do is look it's a page out the book
We starting a new chapter
This a cash bill massacre
It's more than music
Homie its a movement
Only Makaveli know what we doing because he approved it
It's all God's plan you ain't go nothing to do with
Young Niggas understand me, they know just why I do this

[Verse 2: Outlawz]
Homie this ain't love
I was sent to you niggas from Pac
Him and Khadafi was hot
They thought ya'll was gon' stop
This is God's plan, I am God's best friend
I feel like I'm in the same car Pac got shot in
But it's bulletproof
Fuck Talking you can see the truth
If your past is a hypocrite what the hell he teaching you
Take the Farrakhan route and try to reach the youth
My people dying before we get a chance to reproduce
The government keep lying, god bless the fucking troops
While the bullets flying Bush sipping Grey Goose
My little cousin doing life he only 22
Telling me he aite for something he didn't do
We here for a reason, do you niggas understand?
Ja, theres no man who can stop God's plan

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Real Niggas be saying, if your boy was living
Rappers now a days, they wouldn't be getting
I've been in the game real heavy since before '9-5
Knew BIG when his timbs used to lean to the side
I'm a outlaw nigga, blood sweat and the tears
Some of the realist from the row, yeah you heard me clear
Yea they owe us some change because we done paid our dues
I'm still hungry as hell, these rap niggas is food
Looking for cash money so we heading to Cashville
That nigga Buck real fuck how you niggas feel
Heater tucked still close to my flesh
Kadafi on my mind, nothing but murder left[Intro]
Makaveli in this, Killuminati all through your body
Blows like a 12-gauge shotty, feel me
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh

[Hook]
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-lalala

[Verse 1]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggas coming for me, through my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention: bless me please Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams, in the dark, evil lurks
Enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip; never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wasting
Instutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble: we ballin'
Catch me father please, cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy I hear ya callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live but I got nothing to lose
Just me and you on a one way trip to prison
Selling drugs, we all wrapped up in this living life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doing their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thugging eternal through my heart: now Hail Mary nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kastro]
They got a APB out on my thug family
Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me: thug-living, getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs

[Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever and that mothafucka
Nasty new street slugger, my heat seeks suckers
On the regular, mashing in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, 60 seconds til the draw that's when I'm deadin' ya feet first
You've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preaching church, I gave you love, now you eating dirt
Needing work and I ain't the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond: when I was broke I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up to all my niggas: get your pay and weight up

[Bridge: Kadafi]
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate

[Hook]

[Prince Ital Joe]
We've been traveling on this weary road
Sometimes life can take a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet, Hail Mary
We won't worry, everything well curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything well curry
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty, Hail Mary

[Outro]
Westside. Outlawz. Makaveli the Don. Solo. Killuminati. The 7 DaysGet on yo knees nigga, get on yo knees and pray

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Increase the doses, bust on whoever closest
Thug livin', hell of prison, never losin' my focus
I'm makin' money moves mandatory, end of discussion
My past records tell a story, picture niggas with rushin'
And steel bust in, till the cops come runnin', duck in abandon buildings
Ditchin' my gun, oh what a motherfucking feeling
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now [?]
So I laugh til I'm cryin', when the Lord come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga missed me
Why plant seeds in a dirty bitch waitin' to trick me
Not the life for me, livin' carefree till I'm buried
And if they dare me, I'll bust on them niggas, and until they scurry
I'm clearly a man of military means, to my artillery
Watchin' over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Sellin' dope to all the fiends, sometimes I wanna cry
And still, we try to change the past in vain
Never knowin' if this game will last, feelin' the shame
Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin' my soul
Got tired of smalltime livin' nigga tellin' me no
I got mine, fuck them other suckas
That's the mentality, jealous ass bustas makin' hell for a hustler

[Hook: 2Pac & Yaki Kadafi]
Oh Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgement day
It ain't me, I was rasied this way
Never let 'em play me for a busta
Makin' hell for a hustler

[Verse 2: EDI]
How do these cowards be concieved
They born into this world, allowed to breathe
While so many real G's they die secret
But Outlawz, we ride so rightously
Control the destiny, we mobbin' with a sight
To see, all together, never separately

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
It's it a criminal hobby
That got me here thinkin' robbery
Call Oz up the ave uptown back in Cabust
And not a lot of poverty, weather you white like dark
Or brown like Bobby, while dime bitches give me body til
They open

[Verse 4: Kastro]
Now that's the good of all evil, so tell me what's the worse
Me deep in my hurst, stuck in crime like time fly over here
First, waitin' for credit, contemplatin' my fate
And is the Lord comin', to take me on Judgement Day

[Verse 5: Young Noble]
They got the feens using up beens with dirty blood on a eagle
Stranded, blunted in his van, don't give a damn if you see 'em
Most likey I'm a real nigga, so while the 2 Loc
Five shots will leave yall to live or die

[Verse 6: Napoleon]
Well I been hustlin' off the same block since a little shorty wap
Taped up notts so my sock, duckin' the muthafuckin' cops
Watch me shop up, and locked up, come back and blow the block up
Preoccupied with gettin' my cheese and fuck the process

[Hook]

[Verse 7: 2Pac]
No insanity plea from me, I ride the beef till I burn
Censor me and bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile, guess you can could me antisocial
Niggas shakin' like they caught the Holy Ghost when I approach
Try to politic before I smoke 'em, like Sun Tzu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they coming for my dogs in the morning
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me, gettin' blowed out
High watch me murder the bird before he testify
Strikes walking close to my third, I live a troubled life
And if you dream, be a part of my team from Long Beach to Queens
Drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustas
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell for a hustler...

[Hook]

[Outro: 2Pac]
Jay-Z die slow, Biggie, Piggy, Puffy die slow
Nigga it ain't stoppin me
War, war nigga, All my niggas with they name on they neck
Give us respect or die and get chin checked, Westsiiide...
Outlaw... (Word up!)Get on yo' knees nigga, get on yo' knees and pray

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Increase the doses, bustin' on whoever closes
Thug livin', hell in prison, never loosen my focus
I'm makin' money, moves mandatory, end of discussion
My past records tell the story, picture niggas be rushin'
Still bustin', til the cops come runnin', duckin' abandon buildings
Picture my gun, open over the fuckin' ceiling
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now they get me
So I laugh til I'm cry, when the Lord come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga missed me
Why plant seeds to a dirty bitch waitin' to trick me
Not a life for me, livin' carefree til I'm buried
And if they dare me, I'll bust on them niggas, and will they scurry
I'm clearly, a man of military means, to my artilary
Watchin' over me thru every murder scene
From adolecence, to early teens, tho' we was gonna die
Sellin' dope to all the feens, sometimes I wanna cry
Still, we try to change the past in vein
Never knowin' if this game will last, feelin' the shame
Cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin' my soul
Got a small time livin' nigga tellin' me no
I got mine, fuck them other suckas
That's the mentality, jealous ass bustas makin' hell for a hustler

Chorus: [2Pac & Yaki Kadafi]
Oh Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgement day
It ain't me, I was rasied this way
Never let 'em play me for a busta
Makin' hell for a hustler

[Verse 2: E.D.I]
Now in this last days and times
I take mines so serious
Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If i fail, then i suffer, bein' broke is hell 4 a hustler
So i stay strugglin' and jugglin' with all the might i can muster
Since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in one's five's and ten's
Was funny money, So i set my sights bigger four figures or mo'
Real nigga fo' sho', out in the cold for dough
What you thought? lost homies in plenty battles
Last two years shed, plenty tears, and i'll send plenty at you
Let me catch you slippin', you soft niggas is outta here
In case you forgot, we in the same shit that got us here

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Yo, to every step I take, every foul I make
Every jail I break, every mill' I ate
Head to head, whoever hustle hardest
On the block duckin' charges, nigga fuckk the sergeant
He got a job, all my bottles got a pinch of coke
Listen tho' I'm missin' dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell naw, dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words
For all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as fuckk son
Dyin' luck none supply us with much guns
I buck one, just to let you know that I can touch ya
Slangin' cracks or raps, still hell 4 a hustler

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef till I burn
Sensor me and bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social
Niggas shakin' like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em'
Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin' for my dogs in the mornin'
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me? Gettin' blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walkin' close to my third, I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustaz'
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell 4 a hustler

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
This is how we ride
Not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin' guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild till they all die
This is how we ride
Not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin' guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild
Until they all die, Outlaw
Yes (change my ways) yes
The Black Jesuz guide us through this
Weary weary weary weary

Only God can save us
Nuttin' but boss players
Outlawz and thugs[Intro]
Major! Hell motherfuckin yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Coolin, hell yeah

[Verse 1]
Mama raised a hellrazor... born thuggin
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned
Not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons
A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin
I was ganked for sexin
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin class
And I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
Mobbin through the overpass laughin
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger on the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
And mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'mma spark til I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin major, unhh

[Hook]
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unnh (4X)
Mama raised a hellrazor

[2Pac]
Dear Lord can ya feel me
Stress gettin major, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major

[Verse 2]
Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin
Mama raised a hellrazor, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggas
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies restin in the early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggas burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin blunts
Gettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin
Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin pen
Mama raised a hellrazor, uhh, yeah
C'mon, uhh, mama raised a hellrazor
Uhh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin major
(Lord be my savior, unnh)

[Hook]
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unhh (2X)
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major

[Verse 3]
Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, I cause shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin high til the bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin 'Tasha
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, Thug nigga
Stressin like a motherfuckin drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die[E.D.I Amin]
High Speed
For all my niggas livin' in the rush
Slow it down just a notch baby
It's goin' be alright, it's goin' be alright

[2Pac + E.D.I Amin]
Life at High Speed
Fuck the punishment, Thai weed
I gonna buy me a gun
Fuck doin' time

[2Pac]
I live life High Speed
Slightly disillusioned by weed
I breed thug muthafuckas even worse than me
When I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly
Harm me, My army
Niggas decease swiftly
Look at you now, why you wanna act out?
I pull the hammer back
Strike wit' a cannon that'll blow yo muthafuckin' back out
They blast but I'm still standin'
Slightly scarred deep
Questions for the lord, "why he don't like me, god??"
So, though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb all lessons, provide protection for the boss
Rollin' in my double R, raw, rugged, and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
And my crew, we crooked, be mistaken for Jews
We all about our cash, blast if you break the rules
Fools turned snitch for the D.A., be heaven-sent
Switched like a stone-bitch, turned state's evidence, why?
Then they wonder why niggas die
Put your family in danger just to get high
Now, what the hell can we get from jail?
More tricks for the crime trade, this is hell
Bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jailhouse
Open your safe count and take all the mail out
Whatever happens happens
Whoever falls dies
We fresh out of time, livin' blind, so we all ride
In times like these, chronic or Thai weed
Puffin' through this High Speed
And people say...

[Hook: 2Pac]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

[Yaki Kadafi]
Verbal assassin, I hit the corner fast, blastin'
Hot plastic stretch your chest plate back like elastic
No need to push me to split ya
I love beef, like pussy and pistols
For all you pussies that's softer than tissue
I ride by like the fall guy out the roof
Bustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof
Gettin' your neck joints low to verdict wit' mine
Get that ass attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind
Pepper shots pourin'
Catchin' niggas while they snorin'
Kickin' his door in
I'll leave your whole fuckin' family in mourning
Bust me, you itchy-bitchy types can't touch me
Frontin' like you're hard
I'll play your fuckin' yard like a trussel

[Hook: 2Pac]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

[E.D.I Amin]
At times, I look through times wit' so much anger
Wonderin' why it keeps on passin', pushin' me into danger
No stranger to hard times or the good ones
At times I'm amazed
At what the motherfuckin' hood done
What we do to get paid
All day, for the almighty, dollar
Don't even bother to holla
We all destined to be swallowed
By the same thing we lust for
Threw away our morals in bags of dust, more
Niggas is dying tommorrow
We, bet on all time
Nigga the clocks tickin'
Approachin' is the day you gonna need money or Glocks spittin'
Cops sittin', politicians passin' laws you ain't know what
Soon that money gon' be illegal when you die to
Keep your dough up
But I ain't goin' tell you, what?, to stop chasin' paper
Man, I'm just like ya'll, I worry 'bout that shit later
Put the metal to the pedal, slash up nigga, blaze
Lets get blowed out High Speed til the end of my dayz
Now my people say

[Hook: 2Pac - repeat 5X]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

[E.D.I Amin]
Learn about it
Pac you goin' rap?[Intro: 2Pac]
I ain't got no motherfucking friends
That's why I fucked your bitch you fat motherfucker
West Side, Bad Boy killers
You know who the realest is
We bring it too
Take money, take money

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Lil' Cesar go ask you homie how I'll leave you
Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces
Now be deceased
Little Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
So fuck peace
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride the night
Bad Boys murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get your caps peeled
You know

[Hook: 2Pac]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Who shot me, but your punks didn't finish
Now you about to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga I hit em up

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Check this out
You motherfuckers know what time it is
I don't know why I'm even on this track
You all niggas ain't even on my level
I'm going to let my little homies
Ride on you bitch-made ass Bad Boys bitches

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Get out the way, yo, get out the way, yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Moo' pass the Mac
And let me hit em in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right
For setting traps
Little accident-murderer
And I ain't never heard of you
Poisonous gats attack when I'm serving you
Spank you, shank your whole style when I gank
Guard your rank, cause I'm a slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm running through, nigga
And I'm smoking Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready-power tucked in my Guess
Under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour
I push packages every hour, I hit em up

[Hook: 2Pac]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Peep how we do it
Keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas getting killed with your mouths open
Trying to come up off of me, you in the clouds hoping
Smoking dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talking about you getting money
But it's funny to me
All you niggas living bummy
Why you fucking with me?
I'm a self-made millionaire!
Thug livin', out of prison
Pistols in the air
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
5 shots couldn't drop me: I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker I'll hit em up

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
I'm from N-E-W Jers'
Where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees
Copping pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click looting, shooting and polluting your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique moving up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
And all your fake ass East coast props
Brainstormed and locked

[Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]
You's a beat biter
A Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke. We ain't no motherfucking joke
Thug Life, niggas better be known
Be approaching in the wide open, gun smoking
No need for hoping, it's a battle lost
I got em crossed as soon as the funk is bopping off
Nigga, I hit em up!

[Outro: 2Pac]
Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressing up trying to be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob when we always on our job?
We millionaires, killing ain't fair but somebody got to do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep: you wanna fuck with us
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or something
You're fucking with me, nigga
You fuck around and catch a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that want to bring it, bring it
But we ain't singing, we bringing drama
Fuck you and your motherfucking mama
We're gonna kill all you motherfuckers
Now when I came out, I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth with a motherfucking opinion
Well this is how we gonna do this
Fuck Mobb Deep, fuck Biggie
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label and as a motherfucking crew
And if you want to be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too
Chino XL: fuck you too
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too (Take money, take money)
All of y'all mother fuckers, fuck you, die slow, motherfucker
My .44 make sure all y'all kids don't grow
You motherfuckers can't be us or see us
We motherfuckin' Thug Life-riders
Westside til we die
Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya
We'll bomb on you motherfuckers. We do our job
You think you mob? Nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob
Ain't nothing but killers and the real niggas
All you motherfuckers feel us
Our shit goes triple and 4-quadruple
You niggas laugh cause our staff got guns under they motherfuckin' belts
You know how it is, when we drop records they felt
You niggas can't feel it, we the realest
Fuck em, we Bad Boy-killers[Intro: 2Pac]
I ain't got no motherfucking friends
What y'all niggas talking about?
Hell yeah I'ma do this motherfucking track
And they know exactly who they talking about

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Cause uh, niggas talk plenty shit, so many tricks
I fucked your bitch cause I'm true to this, witness the hit
You talk bad about a nigga when I got blasted
Hope you made a little money while the funk lasted
Heard they call you Big Poppa nigga, how you figure?
Cause to me you'll always be a phoney fat nigga
I can't be copied even wearing Versace, nigga you run or ruck
Scared as fuck, if the guns would bust, now niggas talk
I got a list of player haters and fakes
You bitch niggas getting blown away
You cross-eyed Down syndrome crack baby
So you and Puffy are tough? Now that's crazy
I got your ass in my sight, niggas dying tonight
We screaming, "West Side for life"
And I can't wait to see you niggas in traffic cause we gonna get 'em up
When you see me, you better bust cause I'm a hit 'em up

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga we hit 'em up

[Napolean]
It's hard to explain, this wasn't my thang when I was younger
Before my shit, I swear to God, I'll make you stick just to make a come up
Niggas run up cause more murder for the money
Got caught up tryna make a harder record, should have been on checked
Cause I bet you and it's for life
You'll never gonna see a nigga like me wanting a battle up on T.V
I'd rather release some of these
And put a slug to you buster ass niggas that continue to squeeze
I got some niggas back in Jersey that would rather be jacking cars
And robbing bitch niggas like y'all for emergency
Let's take it back to the West Side
Them niggas sure gonna be riders and plus we Thug Life niggas, so call us multiply
Finger on the trigger, bitches stand and rise
But we don't trust 'em and they might be the first that we gonna bust up
Just label me a Bad Boy Killer
You Mobb Deep bitches gonna feel us when we turn into killers
Hit 'em up

[E.D.I Amin]
Now this is me, BBK all day, ain’t no blunt, ain’t no creeping
Strictly Bad Boy killing, shoot that ass like a squealer
Now let this motherfucking top down, I'm fitting to drop rounds
Letting these sounds, pop and then I'm hot bound
Seeing them shatter, shooting my shit to work a lease go
What's up to the riders in L.A, don't preach on up to the East O
Shooting that so, C-Lo, circle, that shit don't hurt you
___________ made to turn you purple
Wanna take a plane, but we enemies to the game
Well get that ass tamed, simple and plain, y'all know the name
Drama, riders, through the whole night
Niggas get taught, then we bobbin' through, they hits slow
No need for running cause we don't give a fuck
Beside the funky man, we got to hit they ass on up

[Hussein Fatal]
Get out the way, yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got shot
And I'm a true eagle storming, nigga don't need your fat ass in California
I catch you on any East Coast corner and you's a goner
Puffy weaker than fucking block, I'm running through nigga
And I'm smoking Junior M.A.F.I.A in front of you nigga
With the ready power, tucking my gats under my Eddie Bauer
You clothes petty sour, I push packages every hour
My sons past when slapping nickels on glass forties
So hand me cash, you made on that F without your ass shorty
I got a team of simple boutable souls
With my ears like Yoda quick as a cobra and never sober


[Khadafi]
I'm on a 12 O' Clock cruise to Brooklyn and I'm looking
For the thirl in your barrel ready to get his life tooken
So where your killers at you fake trick
E.D.I. will leave your coward ass stripped and a full clip in your stomach
You been all year nigga running
Popping every coward and every nigga behind you
I made it about impossible
For you niggas to escape another 'mergency visit to the hospital
I can't wait meet up with all you bitches in the streets
So I can leave all you cowards leaking in your fucking seats
When we hit 'em up

[Storm]
If you a big bad mothafucker come step to this
I got points in the clip and ???? for the click
Who wanna test this to the 1 2 3 bound to get they ass put under
Cause the Storm is bringing nothing but thunder
Who's the bomb nigga quick to feel that ichy finger
Situation of my nine who's the bigger trigger
I approached a true G you though I was easy
Now you begging on your knees pleasey
