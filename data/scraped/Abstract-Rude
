[Intro]
Personnel Officer: Let me see your chauffeur's license. How's your driving record?
Travis: It's clean. It's real clean, like my conscience
Personnel Officer: You gonna break my chops? I have trouble with guys like you coming in to break my chops all the time. If you're gonna break my chops, you can take it on the arches right now, you understand?
Travis: Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
I did a record before you
And sure of course it was a tour de force
Now you can afford a Porsche, go to the Source awards
Get some tour support, do all sorts of warped things
Get a smorgasbord with a horde of whores
Snort some more, leave a horrid corpse
You're so corporate endorsed that when I record a chorus
You said you co-writ the grand corpus
With no if's, and's, or but's
To listen to derivative works of this art-fag
I need to be in arms reach of a barf bag
Using a bland sci-fi lab kit
No fan's hands will go sky-high for that shit
It's too anti-climactic, I'll put my bad reviews on your happy shoes

[Ellay Khule]
Well, it's the Busdriver and y'all back in school
And I'm Ellay Khule and now Ab Rude, ripping it

[Verse 2: Abstract Rude]
Derivative of creative initiative
Uninhibited in no particular fashion
Indicative of an atypical mic-smashing
Considered the title class of the fiercest survivalist
Paralyzing psychoanalyst, magnetizing soul catalyst
Out of a cocoon a platoon would form and how did it happen
Sprouting like alfalfa poison mushrooms out of the grass
Boys to men of this vast network of allies
That were sent to the rally point for the joint venture
Henchmen with a long-standing friendship
Based on both surviving a lynching from those striving against them
Rise to any length spread through every width, area, and circumference
It's a heavy load to lift but I was never known to quit nothing
I use a dolly, pulley, lever, conveyor belt
On the assembly line where all of the steel melts
I'd weld them a chopper, tap on a chakra to get 'em back in order
And mail them a document to tell 'em retreat back over the border
For his aura's sake to make more, innovate, and record a great album
For our styling cipher out for the Driver
I'm a clocker, as much of an actor as Mekhi Phifer's a rhymer
He's the Busdriver and y'all back in school
And I'm Ab-Rude and with Ellay Khule, rippin' it

[Bridge]
Yeah, Project Blowed Collective holds MC's of the future
I read the grandkid, I did every column
We have you mapped out

[Hook: Budriver and Abstract Rude]
We've mapped your psyche
We know what you do before you do
Packaged it nicely
And sold it to who feeds off the style

[Verse 3: Ellay Khule]
You couldn't break my chops with an axe
Take you time, make it fat, talking shit, take it back
Mad when you kick that crap
Weak wack raps, where the real writers at?
Over here, over there, everywhere that I peek
Follow the elite, every style that I freak
Beat a nigga down when I'm bound to a beat
Microphone parts what they found in the street
Pick 'em up, dust, kick it up, time to rip it up
Having fun with my tongue, when I'm done give it up
Time to demonstrate how I penetrate
Hot incinerate, biting like a dinner date
It's a twist that I missed, what part of the game is this?
Where the losers go and the winners wait
To take the beginner's place
Keep my face placed on how to win the race
If they'd run, I would never chase
Hit 'em with the boom because they set up base
This ain't Texas but this is the west's Chainsaw Leather Face
Keep the golden mic in a leather case
And when it's battle time, I'ma set a pace
Every line that you find already been mine
When you rhyme, man, what a waste
You would think I'd busted a nut in every hip-hop slut
Because there's too many Mini-Me's
And some of y'all cats is finicky
So y'all quickly change to enemies
Blowing up in the industry so they remember me
In their memory for original chops
So you better give spiritual props to your lyrical pops
Speed seeds, I delivered a flock
Busdriver, Ellay Khule, and Ab Rude
A few Goodlife emcees on the prowl
They get beat up every time they want to eat up
And try to feed up on my style
Got your little puny mind
Your little minuscule thoughts mapped out

[Hook]It's all, it's all becoming to clear to me
There appears to be something that you do not know about
Something about this music
Somn', something about this music

(x2)

Still young but I'm old
Pursuing the truth in goal
Trying to produce from the soul
Backing me is a force, my greatest resource
So when you ride this rhyme you be the rhyme horse
This rhyme is a compass
Designating the direction of your mind as you want this
The dope beats don't cease
Not for player haters
But the appreciators of what we release
Heavyweights will take a stand and show your flow is nice
They'll pass the mic like Montana would throw to Rice
A prime from the mind to the wickedness
They ride on the dance floor like the Nicholas
Brothers, Tribe Unique discovers
Different ways, visually stimulating displays of movement
Groovy groovy slide, watch me do this step
Let's see if you can vibe to how deep does it get

(chorus)

Emcees flowing deep and wide, deep and wide
Cali earthquake impact when me and the beat collide
Smack dab, dropping like a Reggie Miller clutch three
Leaving emcees saying "Fuck me"
Ooh, but don't get vulgar just cause I provoked ya
You're all vultures, our music is the prey
We do this every day
You swoop down in your six-four
Bumping ATU through alpines
But please, time's down, dogs up
The Project Blowedians be the first to battle, that's what you call guts
Caps peeled back by verbal weapon
You hear them tracks, feel back, you heard us flexin'
Manifestation, switch the station
To de-program the robots
The ones who Acey calls Knownots
Tell your whole block cause it's the sure shot

(chorus)(speaking)
Uh! Watch your step! It's no joke out here, watch your rep!

Ain't no joke to provoke a top seed
For those who smoke and they got they own weed
Ain't no walk in the park where I'm from
Dogs that bark, but they talk with they guns
Wasn't no unlocked doors where I stayed
Too much trust in the cops, you got played
I'm that spade in the deck to cut loose
Be that blade in your neck, give respect due
You didn't expect me to get this far
Now they caught the vapors, thought they learned from Bismark
This dark track could eclipse the sunrays
Hit hard raps, we should quit the gun-play
'Cuz ain't no fun to relay the bad news
Our sons and nephews know that cash rules
For it I'll never sell the soul of Ab Rude
A poet of ever'one to tell the sad truth like

(chorus)
The Undi-Sputed, Heavyweight, Rudest
Pa-rum-pa-pom! No jargon, could ever dead, this yard mon! (Yard mon!)
Inside, outside, all sides
Seal the perimeter! I'm a lion of the pride
His tribe, my tribe, your tribe
I put it into ya! Warlords of the Flies

Only 9-1-1's a joke here
Cops don't come till machine gun smoke clears
Show no fear in your heart to get tested
Go nowhere in the dark unprotected
As if I gotta remind you how hectic it is
We all have homies that set-trip
They'll call for medics when the gats unleashed
You'll regret it if you don't make it back in one piece
That's how they do it no resolving the beef
Why Battle Axe Crew stays armed to the teeth
Comin' at you with them tattood physiques
So if you rap weak, better take a back seat
This is a beat that's haunting in sleep
It could bump in your jeep, what they want from the street
You could never be measured as this rude
Meet me up at the session to get schooled by

The Undi-Sputed, Heavyweight, Rudest
Pa-rum-pa-pom! No jargon, could ever dead, this yard mon! (Yard mon!)
Inside, outside, all sides
Seal the perimeter! I'm a lion of the pride
His tribe, my tribe, your tribe
I put it into ya! Warlords of the Flies[Abstract Rude telephone message]

"Yo Grouch, what's up? It's Ab
Uh, I'm out here man, hit me up, hit me up at the office
I got this idea for this song I want to do with you
Um, hopefully we can do that shit
Um, I don't know what I'mma call it
But the hook is like
'Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
Friends should last longer but it gets ugly
Push me to the point of no return
Fools they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn
Blood's thicker than water...'
I can hear me and you fucking up some shit on that
Anyway..."

[Aceyalone]
Does a woman make a man feel like a man
Because she's giving him the pussy hole?
Does a man make a woman feel like a woman
Cause he said she was sweeter than a Tootsie Roll?
Yeah, with self-control she'll be first on the scroll
But it's all about the scrotum and the pole
And that feeling that just takes a hold of most people
The pussy and the dick are equal, both deceitful
Some niggas ain't got control of they ding-a-ling
Forget about everything when they start tingling
And some gals can't stop mingling
Need someone to scratch the itch, bitch keep jingling
But mother nature's more powerful than you think
After a couple drinks, you'll hit it if it stinks
Cause ain't nobody perfect and plus
Babies have to be born and nuts have to be bust
Adjust, don't fuck over somebody you trust
Going head over heels over lust, but life is real

[Hook: Abstract Rude]
Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
Friends should last longer, but it gets ugly
Push me like a button, nothing earned
Fools, they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn
Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
Friends should have honor, but it gets ugly
Push me like a button, nothing earned
Fools, they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn

[The Grouch]
Now if you had the opportunity to fuck off things with you and me
Over a breezy, then you probably would
Hopefully I wouldn't trip, but naturally I should
And actually if we were close, it would be to the good
Cause if you was using judgement and wasn't on no love shit
An example of how blood's thick is me being cool
Rule of thumbs, you've heard them like M.O.B. and friends too
I've got too much game and business to attend to to cry
And though I'd be the first to ask you why
And I'd definitely be upset to catch you in a lie
Wouldn't be the first time that sharing was caring
Ask Eligh how it goes down, tempers aren't always flaring
Staring at the situation open-minded
The only way to go cause time can't be rewinded
Find it in your interest not to fool with my wife though
Cause what would happen then is something that you wouldn't like to know

[Hook: Aceyalone]

[Abstract Rude]
What's up baby? I see you making moves
You've got a point to prove, and issues with Rude
I showed you love, fed you food, hooked you up with my troops
Around you place sipping blues, didn't even make you pay dues
Even when I had pick and choose for you, I was in the mood
And see I, I'm a hardcore stuck in the war
Can't take many more first night scores out on tour
The pure thought whispers settle down, don't mess around
The young mind, yeah wants to find what's new in town
But I can't blame ya, call you out then name ya (biatch!)
Hell I'm an entertainer, L.A. underground rap star
Who ain't got that far, it'll be our little secret
For sure something you'll regret and sleep with
I swallow pride, plus the envious and jealous love
Slow to anger, not a glutton, comes with high cost
Of blood loss that's worse than having no water
And dick and pussy is weak, and that'll get you caught up
Look at you tryna run through my whole crew
You hitting speed bumps, it's a rocky road boo
It's a rocky road boo

Some people eat mice, all covered with lice
While I watch Poltergeist, some people of Christ
Crumb roaches and night fall, call it to height
If you will still believe in shadows and thrills
Walk the tight line of light that divides the gilds
Where the masons build up on Haunted Hill
No lights on the grill, black Coupe De Ville
About twelve o'clock midnight, window sill
Where the winds don't will, fingerprints won't set
To think we might reach Mars but haven't figured it yet
The deeper it gets, the more minds must inquire
Streets are ablaze, no jobs and slashed tires
You can't walk by us, we still hold the buyers
Ab, Mok, and P-1's for choir of lions
Fire and iron, everything that melts and bends
It's credible, criminal stakes cut you a friend
Lost lake in the end, high voltage revenge
Cold status with a pen
Will battles till the end

[Abstract Rude]
The petrie dish is placed onto the microscope
Scientists examine what will provoke
A whole nation of humans resulted in ruins
The land by man, disrespected, disease infected
Some communities go unprotected
And every year welcomes a pledge for new beginning
But do we come out winning, lives are ending
Surrendering and being hindered
When do we remember, how do we forget
Our true gender without regret
Science commits homicide, crack new born baby dies
From the desire of intoxication while impregnated, eyes
Are way bigger than that fat tummy
Needed exchange explains the reign of money
The funny, the fickle and the wishy-washy are a little silly
Posse of people, their philosophy is evil
Can you possibly see through
The beaurecracy, the big troop to the X of this revolution

Within the depths of this wood panneled room
This council sits with charts and graphs and prepares the news
Monthly reports fanned a fresco for you enthusiasts
My blues is the moodiest, truly is an uncommon understanding
One twelfth of the Zodiac with eratic planning
Solo yet unified, and so low you drill and drill
But can't reach the bottom of my soul, although you have tried
And some of you just want to know how it all takes
Taking apart to inspect, but don't know how to fix
Some things should just be left a mystery
History repeats itself frequently and causes misery
The people in the middle just dribble away
The eyes on the tower know exactly where you stay
This man in the mirror doesn't know what to do
Except repeat the little pieces that I've learned and given to you
Download it for you, you give it to them
See, there's more than one way to uproot than pull another stem
Crime can dissapear, but at what price
Where the ten lock you in for the night and turn out the lights

Cmon

It goes
One for the money
Two for the show
Three for my minions who got in the back door
Four for the honey dips
Five for my bros
And death as my breath kept in and no flow
And it's so slow
You see my life don't grow
And my raps only collect daft so-so
It feels every word that I write steals my fate
Losin every single one of my friends today
And its the weight in my mind
A continual war chyme in my head yellin that the past ain't dead
But it's alive to well with many stories to tell
Exiting one cell only to a new jail
Destined to fail it seems
And my positivity is trapped in dreams
But I gotta let it shine to affect my team
I can't go back, gotta press on back
Yo

[Hook]
Life goes on
No matter if your life is tattered
And you can't fix what went wrong
Life goes on
Your battered and your life is scattered
You're a hook in your own theme song
Life goes on
You're a fighter but the grip is tighter
And you know that you can't stand long
Life goes on
Boy it's gonna get brighter
Life goes on
Girl it's gonna get brighter
Life goes on

[Verse 2: Abstract Rude]
If ever you're hungry, (you) should never feel lonely
If god is with you
If I go know that I will make a return
Give me frankincense myrrh, his ashes in the urn
But learn life goes on
Chant the psalm, sing solomon songs
All of them troubles be gone
We life on with this
I'm sick as rhyme kickin consciousness
And time's slippin, that's why I'm takin risks
It's us prosecuted without cause
The long arm always chases an outlaw
Who did nothing to noone
They just don't understand who he is (is) where he comes from
But I know
When you're playin their game
Stuck on this airplane
You'll always be fair game
Survival
You're liable to go nuts, but still gotta hold up
I know it gets though, believe

Humming to fade outIntro:
Change style (like what?) You know. Change it. Ummhum
I just get in these moods man. Make it happen
They brought you the mood, within the music
Now the music within the moodÂ Â 

Hook:
We're torn between the new ways of the present
Between the old ways of the pastÂ Â 
What will be the ways of the future?
How long will the new world last?Â Â 

Verse 1:
The masses are innocent to the magnificent
Atmos ? and shit my raps are significantÂ Â 
So I have to benefit wouldn't you?
If you had skill that other people couldn't do?Â Â 
I'm putting new thought inside your mindÂ 
Fat Jacks makes the music I write the rhymes
Tribe Unique combines to put the vision in the rhythm
It is written certain things are forbiddenÂ 
I remember when a simple rhyme was a jewel
Now you gotta freestyle and act a foolÂ 
The blacker you are the better for being cool
And gettin' screwed
And plus somebody takin' food out your baby's mouthÂ 
You make me doubt the system
When you make a world issue out of O.J. Simpson?

Hook (x2)

Verse 2:
But things are better than they were right?
They industry is flooded with rappers that were tight
But what they are now is something new
And everybody race around for what they gonna do
This year a new sound in the atmosphere to pick and choose
But which is whose and whose is which?
Half the people liked ya better way before ya switched
At last the task becomes a masquerade
Cause when you pay you don't bother
It becomes harder to stay hungary
Because you eatin', ain't keepin' the same company
You don't want any static you think it's copastetic
But that's not livin' better
If you ain't all together (homie)
Don't let your urge go on to live right
Or get your creativity while rippin' on the mic

Hook

Verse 3:
Survin' in the land of juveniles
I'm strivin' while I'm risin' with the brand newest style
Uh my eyes and ears are open
I'm peepin' what they actin' like
The public eats it up, they got big appetite
First page for the rage of a nation
Second page for that nation to awaken
Third page for the old ways
Computers takin' over man but they man made
Fourth page hooray
As told by the God Soundwave
We shall prevail again (prevail again)
Fifth page for the alien (the aliens)
Five years till when?...

Yeah
Ah, this one's out of respect
To you and yours
Ah

I'm a b-boy, I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy

What's up party people in the place to be
Gather round for a minute and check the MC
I really don't know what you expectin from me
But I was born and raised to rock over the beat
See, me and my homies got some tight-ass raps
It is time we put the hometeam back on the map
All you radio stations play a whole lotta crap
It's like I'm hungry at the table and you feedin me scrap
So this one's for the people who can ride the wave
And go into the battle and come out unscathed
See, my only regret is that I probably never gave
Enough back to hip-hop for the life it saved
So ride along with us as we lick this shot
For anybody who put it down, we never forgot
See, we give it all we got, cause it's how we was taught
And it only takes a second just to blow up the spot

I'm a b-boy, I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy (5X)

[ Abstract Rude ]
We keep it lit like weed, indeed the rare breed
They barely did enough of us for their needs
Our fans, some r&b, most hip-hop and rave
I'm dark-skinned, baby, and I get you sun-bathed
Once the track's laid that Jissm made
I become a slave to the beat, don't know how to behave
We kept it true, what else did you expect us to do?
Now I'm beggin you to come and spin a record or two
I'm on the prowl in the here and now I'll be cold
To you so-called MC's who wanna get bold
You'll be showed in the worst ways
I'm seasoned for battle cause of Project Blowed Thursdays
I'm a wordsmith, now that we've settled into two thou
(Two thou) we gotta represent somehow (somehow)
It's talent in the ghetto that we'll have to employ
With melanin in em they'll seek to destroy

I'm a rudeboy, I'm the real mccoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy (5X)

[ both ]
You wanna make noise, make noise

[ Aceyalone (& Abstract Rude) ]
B-boys make some noise (b-boys)
B-girls make some noise
(It's workin)
Work it out
Work it out
(It's workin)
Like that

[ Aceyalone ]
Cause we was at the party when the jam was live
And it really wasn't poppin until we arrived
We was hangin out at the club before we can drive
With big afros like the Jackson Five
Comin out the house late, makin it home safe
B-boys in the place, just had to show my face
Soon after that I discovered my instrument
As soon as I picked her up we got intimate
Big up to my homeboys who know this tune
Microphone Mike and my man T-Spoon (Heavyweight)
Aceyalone just stepped in the room
Now we know the flavor's in here the party resumes

Cause I'm a b-boy, I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy (2X)
I'm a b-boy...

Respect to the fallen soldiers in hip-hop
And all the fallen soldiers across the world in the struggle

Blast off into infinity, i stay vivid and you love it
Flips up rearrange up change up my rhythm and you love it
Whose illiterate to this?
Huh? i dunno, well that
I don't care
Strap got yo back
Word, come here
Step, spin, slide, up and around, to the visual
"ooohhh" To the audio sound it's a miracle
Ill spiritual vibe, is alive
Why, this? It'll get much clearer, check it out, check it out
Journey in this hell, when you're trying to learn well
Babylons a jail, that i rebel
Ain't no water for a fire that's already burned
You got to earn what you keep be you need to learn
Give thanks

Blast off into infinity, i stay vivid and you love it
Flips up rearrange up change up my rhythm and you love it
Blast off into infinity, i stay vivid and you love it
Flips up rearrange up change up my rhythm and you love it
Blast off, blast off

[Verse 2: Abstract Rude]
Break through by the millions
Way way needed, much easier said than done
Nah man they don't wanna hear that
*zoom zoom* What was that? Its a Zulu flying
A ?? , What will become of the future
Word to the year two thousand
Five hundred and eight years it'll be
Slaves keep on housing,
Don't seem to me like we that free
Poison in the water,
I think Columbus spiked the punch
Poison ain't a bother
See my frustration light the blunt
*woo* feel that, now
When you have lost your true identity
You must throw up, from the blow up
Throw up you're hood, instead of good intentions
Some cats strapped you know about that
Goin to the party with the go-in with a gat
Mmm blast off into infinity
Little villain niggas got energy
Therefore they get locked up in facilities
Breaking and entering, highway robbery
Two eleven, one eighty seven
All products of poverty
Obviously, this happens periodically
It's not me, it's the god in me
Gotta be twist turned jumped, leaned, dipped, split
Come back up and begin to rip, flip
I and I by and by I have become
With a lit fuse blast
Off

[Outro: Abstract rude]
While you stay here, you know where I'm going
Where are you going? You just hanging around
Into infinity, he hay, all the way live from the 215

Cause he said she was sweeter than a Tootsie Roll?
Yeah, with self-control she'll be first on the scroll
But it's all about the scrotum and the pole
And that feeling that just takes a hold of most people
The pussy and the dick are equal, both deceitful
Some niggas ain't got control of they ding-a-ling
Forget about everything when they start tingling
And some gals can't stop mingling
Need someone to scratch the itch, bitch keep jingling
But mother nature's more powerful than you think
After a couple drinks, you'll hit it if it stinks
Cause ain't nobody perfect and plus
Babies have to be born and nuts have to be bust
Adjust, don't fuck over somebody you trust
Going head over heels over lust, but life is real

[Hook: Abstract Rude]
Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
Friends should last longer, but it gets ugly
Push me like a button, nothing earned
Fools, they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn
Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
Friends should have honor, but it gets ugly
Push me like a button, nothing earned
Fools, they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn

[The Grouch]
Now if you had the opportunity to fuck off things with you and me
Over a breezy, then you probably would
Hopefully I wouldn't trip, but naturally I should
And actually if we were close, it would be to the good
Cause if you was using judgement and wasn't on no love shit
An example of how blood's thick is me being cool
Rule of thumbs, you've heard them like M.O.B. and friends too
I've got too much game and business to attend to to cry
And though I'd be the first to ask you why
And I'd definitely be upset to catch you in a lie
Wouldn't be the first time that sharing was caring
Ask Eligh how it goes down, tempers aren't always flaring
Staring at the situation open-minded
The only way to go cause time can't be rewinded
Find it in your interest not to fool with my wife though
Cause what would happen then is something that you wouldn't like to know

[Hook: Aceyalone]

[Abstract Rude]
What's up baby? I see you making moves
You've got a point to prove, and issues with Rude
I showed you love, fed you food, hooked you up with my troops
Around you place sipping blues, didn't even make you pay dues
Even when I had pick and choose for you, I was in the mood
And see I, I'm a hardcore stuck in the war
Can't take many more first night scores out on tour
The pure thought whispers settle down, don't mess around
The young mind, yeah wants to find what's new in town
But I can't blame ya, call you out then name ya (biatch!)
Hell I'm an entertainer, L.A. underground rap star
Who ain't got that far, it'll be our little secret
For sure something you'll regret and sleep with
I swallow pride, plus the envious and jealous love
Slow to anger, not a glutton, comes with high cost
Of blood loss that's worse than having no water
And dick and pussy is weak, and that'll get you caught up
Look at you tryna run through my whole crew
You hitting speed bumps, it's a rocky road boo
It's a rocky road boo

[Hook: The Grouch]Breath out breath in breath out

There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
Rhymes I got plenty keep 'em right by my side
Come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride
There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide

Now everybody up odd man in
Fit to play a game of russian roulette and God's fit to win
I hope you're equip for the adventure men to the front
And the women and children to the back of the boat
Fit to be afloat in about fifty seconds
Better believe we brought enough free chicken for the picnic
And while the time is tickin'
Automated belt drive felt tip scribe I'm your guide
To the innermost outtermost post to the other side
Now my body is my temple and my temple is my prize
And my mind shine like the sun do
And here's a little word from the wise
You go up the river down the creek cross the lake
And over the stream tryin' to escape this MC

There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
- what is it

MC's flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
Rhymes we got plenty keep 'em right by our sides
Come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride
There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
- what is it

Obviously this happens periodically
It's not me it's the god in me I'm rappin' so melodically
Aeronautically Aaron is I, Aaron is high, Aaron is flying
Why in me means the glare in your eye
They're in the lyin' down postion
The music's a masseuse
Goin' through your body makin' all the tension loose
Audio boost their reaction means satisfaction
Seems to happen when I'm rappin' and they hear me clearly
And cheering even teary-eyed in the b-boy kingdom
We some rude stylish scattin rappin world twists
But that's just for audio analysis
The dopest you diagnose this
But still don't get too close this
May have a ferocious side
There's and MC flowin' by deep and open wide
- what is it

MC's flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
Rhymes we got plenty keep 'em right by our sides
Come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride
There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
- what is it

Breath out breath in breath out
- yo Ab feel the wind blowin'
Breath in breath out
Breath in breath out

I am a universal soldierStaring at the truth can be like staring at the sunlight. You get blinded

[Abstract Rude:]
Feel an eclipse
That energy shifts
The wind is so brisk
It'll push a man over the cliff

Beginning with this
The word that was born with the fist
Absorbing the lands and
Flesh torn with the death wish

We ain't gotta get violent to communicate
We ain't gotta see eye to eye to mobilize and motivate

Death before dishonor
Envy or betrayal
Never gon' be stronger than we were
The day that we were all together
Spike the nail in the coffin
'cuz they say you better off and
On the other side when you ain't got no problems

I ain't sayin' heavens gate is callin'
It don't take death to dodge 'em
'Cuz you're alive
You may as well think of a better option

Let's get you rounded with a spiritual base
So you can look in the mirror and be proud of your face
A real image don't know how to be fake
Make it by any means or behind the scenes view of the outtakes

I lived in a time of raising hell
I lived in a time of LL
At Def Jam
I lived in a time
Of champions of rhyme
Like Myka motha' fuckin' 9
And X Clan
I lived in a time of Kool Moe
I lived in a time of Native Tongues
And Hiero
And who could forget the Wu though
And who rep the west?
My crew Project Blowed

A thousand nations
Even our own
Descend upon us

No man is prophet
Not a single break
Or chink in armor

Our wounded and dead
Got fox and vultures feedin' on 'em
Our movement is lead
Protect the culture
Keep it goin'

En garde
For every push
When they come hard
It's shields up
From the arrow barrage
That builds up
From one bar to the next
For every bar you take a text
I got another thought to digest

I Rock Dis Funky Joint
'cuz Funky Town's the livest
And you missin' the point
You digress I guess

But I got something going
With my little KTF
My crew
Is right on the brink
Of being The Dark Knight Rises

A terror in the air
A bearer of bad news
Your era is in jeopardy
So be scared of Ab Rude

Can't get me out your head
My nightmare has you
But you'll never be aware
'cuz to you only cash rules

I lived in a time of raising hell
I lived in a time of LL
At Def Jam
I lived in a time
Of champions of rhyme
Like Myka motha' fuckin' 9
And X Clan
I lived in a time of Kool Moe
I lived in a time of Native Tongues
And Hiero
And who could forget the Wu though
And who rep the west?
My crew Project BlowedYou know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we
Keep it true
You know we keep it true - we got to keep it true we got to keep
It true
We got to keep it true - you know what we do you know what
We do
We got to keep it true
Relax your mind w/the music - you know what we do you know what we do
Sit back and vibe w/this true shit

This isn't really what you think it is
That is if you're even thinkin' in the first place
The first place isn't always the winner
And winnin' isn't everything
And this is not a race
I am not a android I am not a mongoloid
I am not annoyed by the void in your brain
This is not a trick son you are not a victim
You are just a man b-boyed out the game
Let me explain
Abstract are you fresh?
Ain't nobody fresher
But it's hard to get around w/out some clown tryin' to test ya
Acey are you dope? Dopest in the world
I give it to the moms and pops I give it to the boys and girls
Oh so you a family man? Aren't we all aren't we all
Yes we are, Trying to make jams man and expand my repertoire

We got to keep it true we got to keep it true - relax your mind w/the music
You know what we do you know what we do - sit back and vibe w/this true shit

Well I be arrangin' thoughts in my brain cell family
[?rapidly?] embarking on incredible creative routes
Understanding me is truth shining like a lie
When I say break wide I mean take trips not just in your ride
In your mind
Cause when you left you're right on time
The sun'll come out tomorrow and it'll set in the west
So I don't sweat the rest
Who wanna inhale stress
Keep it true

You know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we
Keep it true
You know we keep it true - you know what we do you know what we
Do
We got to keep it true - the W the W the W
We got to keep it true
Relax your mind w/the music - and keep it true and keep it true
Sit back and vibe w/this true shit

The world is full of bullshitters
Liars and triers and quitters
Could-a-beens wanna be's thought-i-was isn't-i-is's
And everybody in your business
Damn
Now what is really your main aim
When you are just a blotch and a stain on the planetary plane
Just another name in the phone book of fame
Bustin' out the seams it seems you haven't gained enough
To be seen in the right scene
Your thoughts they seem so convincing hmmm
But your actions don't follow through
Remember
Never say never because it never comes true
Your thoughts they seem so convincing for instance
You told me that you're a level higher
Liar
Element of desire earth and the wind and the fire
Not
You ain't even halfway hot
Not lukewarm you don't got no form
You (...?...)
All caught up in bein' waterproof
When you shoulda been tryin' to catch up w/the truth
For all intent and purposes your life on earth ain't worth it's weight in
Gold
That's probably why you get blowed
Cause people tell people things and people sell people things
That are useless and irrelevant
And it stifles my intelligence
I stay true

You know we keep it true - and we keep on and keep on and keep on
You know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true

You can mumble jumble if you got somethin' to say
But I doubt it's gonna affect me I row my boat steady
Everready is my battery description
Meaning I'm equipped to take long trips
And my brain cells overload when I get blowed
Gotta bring it down there's a point where the joint stops
Being passed through the fingers of a rhyme (?singers?)
The smoke from my last hit still lingers
Bring us your tired and your weary and your poor
I'm a take you higher while you're hearing metaphors
And similes
Assimilation of new creation
Mind emancipation
Rhymes command the nation
And so on and therefor and such and such
Dust to dust I thrust from the ground
W/no where else to go but up L.A. is where I'm found
Throwin' up sets and blowin' up sets and goin' up Stepney
About to get a heavy track
(?or jimmy in the spot?)
Or plenty of hip hop goin' round three
Heavyweights it's your time so register
Foundate your legacy we serve all them replicas
True style true style?
True style new style

You know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we keep it true
You know we keep it true - the W and every crew we keep it true
We got to keep it true - from me to you do what you do just keep it
True
We got to keep it true - relax your mind w/the music

Now I'm gonna take my last verse on a good note
You better prepare your footnotes
Hold your wigs tight
Open up the middle
(?center me in the more?)
Words are the foundation action is the building and unity
And the concept to result in logic and the use of logic
Now the object to be neutral partial to a judgement
And the subject's concentration here is the pop quiz
What hip hop is

You know we keep it true - relax your mind w/the music
We got to keep it true - sit back and vibe to this true shit

The wrong thing to do is stopThis goes out to everybody in the whole wide world
Fresh coast gettin' rowdy
We don't represent out west we signifyin'
We showin' out
And we about to tell y'all what it's all about
So as I ease back from this microphone
I'm a let it go to Aceyalone
Little somethin' like this

Chorus:

Check it out people whoever you are
Whoever you with where ever you at
Wherever you from where ever you goin
I'm 'on' put you up on this here cause youse not knowin

Verse One:

Let me take a little time out to holler at ya
You go get your partners cause I'm fit to drop a bug in your ear
See what we have here is uh ruh yeah
The helluva ill type shit you fear
That's cause we knowin but you don't really know
Cause every nigga that call hisself rappin don't really flow
Really though
I'll open up my mind and take you places you can't go
I woulda been a catcher behind the plate but you can't throw
Cause you don't know but you don't hear me though
Yo check this out
My body collapse in the raps
And snaps like a wild mongoose in a trap
Better watch your table manners boy and give me room
I'm servin' shit constantly tune
And laughin' like a ticklish babboon
On the way to the moon w/a stick and a broom
And the cream of the crop hip hop cause we be
Crackin' the whip on the poppin' be pimpin' the whole punk block
At the junk shop
Fellowship shop shape sha-bob-a-lob-a
Sloppin' the side of a pig pen with the grape ape baboon
Wanna see this jack o'lantern panted planted ball that don't bounce
Against the wall like you think
Well thanks but no thanks
Pranks or no pranks
I'm a let 'em know they can't rank bank or no bank
I would if I could but I can't so I ain't gon' stop flowin'
But I'll put you up on this here cause you's not knowin'

Damn Acey flay me he kinda hittin' I ain't bullshittin'
Written into the Fellowship you know freestyle
Meanwhile back at the hall of justice
Abstract bust this this track ain't for suckers

Verse Two: Abstract Rude

Immediately exceeding the reality of normality
By radically and automatically startin' off rapidly
Rap w/me
Come on perk a little work a little
In the middle nuclei we are responding
Stimuli dim the lights
I gotta really grab you
Cause you just not knowin' about flowin' I can climax to
You rap too short too long too slow too fast
You lacks on point you wrong you won't last
I'm up on a good foot you're out on a bad note
I'm dope
Ice
Fresh
Automatic oh yes
Creatively talkin' about how I'm fadin' you vocally
Your mouth's not openin' man you just not knowin' damn

These niggas got me fucked up aw what up Abstract Rude
Rap dude ain't nobody fade the fresh coast
You know them Heavyweights you know what I'm sayin'
That Ganja K you know what I'm sayin'
That Dolla Holla comin' w/that Watts up you know what I'm sayin'
It's like I ain't even tryin' to understand why people comin' at me
W/that nonsense
They ain't knowin'

Verse Three: Aceyalone

See I engineered it I geared it I steered it
I took it to the whole world and everybody cheered it
I hauled it I yes y'all'ed it and they feared it
I called it I outlawed it and they cleared it
Now I am I and it is it and that's that
But ain't that a bitch
It ain't shit
Think it ain't all that that they say
Forever and a day
To live and die in L.A
California u.s.a
But I am a universal soldier
Ok
Walkin' through the party tryin' to find my way
Bumped into my main man Ganjah K
I gave a nigga a pound and he lit up a j
I took a hit and a half and got high and a hey
My coconut was mellow but my vision was gray
Looked on the dance floor and I seen my DJ
Cool hands Kiilu Grand he knows what to play
So we headed for the booth to get the party on the way
Walkin' through the crowd I heard somebody say hey
It was Mikah 9 he said what up double A
Tryin' to make my pay tryin' not to stray
But you know my forte I let a sleepin' dog lay

We on that old missin' link
In between the baboon and the common man
They don't understand tho
They ain't even tryin' to know
Check this out

Verse Four: Mikah 9

I and I echo with old sentiments
Rudimentary tenements
House reverberates
Richochets to small invertebrates
Even all these spineless jellyfish
Rhyme-less bass with no taste jazz
Enthusiastic spastic hemophiliacs
Memorabilia or acting siliac sense(less)milia
Minature expenditures
Spine tingling adventures
Keenly architechtures
Of a lecture
That blockade and bust dental caps and dentures
Hey! let's start a new business venture
No you're not dreaming i'll be the Pincher
The millimeter by millimeter Doberman Bull Mastiff mix
Where Rottweiler while a rhyme of
Graffiti traffic autobiographic
Ethnic cleansing benzing lacing
Culture oscars inch by inch Deans and Costners
Who foster my rhythmic memories
Collectible sacks of my Mossberg and telebeam
Scope enemies with enemas
I'm leaving them helpless and hopeless like the
Running victim that falls in the scary cinema

Huh huh it was like three black guys and they like had skills
Yeah skills
They were like kinda kinda funky and fresh and stuff

Yeah nigga you just not knowin'[Verse 1: Pigeon John]
Yea
Yea
Haha
Uh hah
Ripmatic
Cmon
Uh
It goes
One for the money
Two for the show
Three for my minions who got in the back door
Four for the honey dips
Five for my bros
And death as my breath kept in and no flow
And it's so slow
You see my life don't grow
And my raps only collect daft so-so
It feels every word that I write steals my fate
Losin every single one of my friends today
And its the weight in my mind
A continual war chyme in my head yellin that the past ain't dead
But it's alive to well with many stories to tell
Exiting one cell only to a new jail
Destined to fail it seems
And my positivity is trapped in dreams
But I gotta let it shine to affect my team
I can't go back, gotta press on back
Yo

[Hook]
Life goes on
No matter if your life is tattered
And you can't fix what went wrong
Life goes on
Your battered and your life is scattered
You're a hook in your own theme song
Life goes on
You're a fighter but the grip is tighter
And you know that you can't stand long
Life goes on
Boy it's gonna get brighter
Life goes on
Girl it's gonna get brighter
Life goes on

[Verse 2: Abstract Rude]
If ever you're hungry, (you) should never feel lonely
If god is with you
If I go know that I will make a return
Give me frankincense myrrh, his ashes in the urn
But learn life goes on
Chant the psalm, sing solomon songs
All of them troubles be gone
We life on with this
I'm sick as rhyme kickin consciousness
And time's slippin, that's why I'm takin risks
It's us prosecuted without cause
The long arm always chases an outlaw
Who did nothing to noone
They just don't understand who he is (is) where he comes from
But I know
When you're playin their game
Stuck on this airplane
You'll always be fair game
Survival
You're liable to go nuts, but still gotta hold up
I know it gets though, believe

[Hook]

Scratching
*The truth is told, the youth can grow*
*Live for life and love livin for kicks*
*The truth is told, the youth can grow*
*break bread at the table of life and live truthfully*
*the truth is told, the youth can grow*
*Live for lifeand love livin for kicks*
*the truth is told, the youth can grow*

[Hook]

Humming to fade out[Intro]
Personnel Officer: Let me see your chauffeur's license. How's your driving record?
Travis: It's clean. It's real clean, like my conscience
Personnel Officer: You gonna break my chops? I have trouble with guys like you coming in to break my chops all the time. If you're gonna break my chops, you can take it on the arches right now, you understand?
Travis: Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
I did a record before you
And sure of course it was a tour de force
Now you can afford a Porsche, go to the Source awards
Get some tour support, do all sorts of warped things
Get a smorgasbord with a horde of whores
Snort some more, leave a horrid corpse
You're so corporate endorsed that when I record a chorus
You said you co-writ the grand corpus
With no if's, and's, or but's
To listen to derivative works of this art-fag
I need to be in arms reach of a barf bag
Using a bland sci-fi lab kit
No fan's hands will go sky-high for that shit
It's too anti-climactic, I'll put my bad reviews on your happy shoes

[Ellay Khule]
Well, it's the Busdriver and y'all back in school
And I'm Ellay Khule and now Ab Rude, ripping it

[Verse 2: Abstract Rude]
Derivative of creative initiative
Uninhibited in no particular fashion
Indicative of an atypical mic-smashing
Considered the title class of the fiercest survivalist
Paralyzing psychoanalyst, magnetizing soul catalyst
Out of a cocoon a platoon would form and how did it happen
Sprouting like alfalfa poison mushrooms out of the grass
Boys to men of this vast network of allies
That were sent to the rally point for the joint venture
Henchmen with a long-standing friendship
Based on both surviving a lynching from those striving against them
Rise to any length spread through every width, area, and circumference
It's a heavy load to lift but I was never known to quit nothing
I use a dolly, pulley, lever, conveyor belt
On the assembly line where all of the steel melts
I'd weld them a chopper, tap on a chakra to get 'em back in order
And mail them a document to tell 'em retreat back over the border
For his aura's sake to make more, innovate, and record a great album
For our styling cipher out for the Driver
I'm a clocker, as much of an actor as Mekhi Phifer's a rhymer
He's the Busdriver and y'all back in school
And I'm Ab-Rude and with Ellay Khule, rippin' it

[Bridge]
Yeah, Project Blowed Collective holds MC's of the future
I read the grandkid, I did every column
We have you mapped out

[Hook: Budriver and Abstract Rude]
We've mapped your psyche
We know what you do before you do
Packaged it nicely
And sold it to who feeds off the style

[Verse 3: Ellay Khule]
You couldn't break my chops with an axe
Take you time, make it fat, talking shit, take it back
Mad when you kick that crap
Weak wack raps, where the real writers at?
Over here, over there, everywhere that I peek
Follow the elite, every style that I freak
Beat a nigga down when I'm bound to a beat
Microphone parts what they found in the street
Pick 'em up, dust, kick it up, time to rip it up
Having fun with my tongue, when I'm done give it up
Time to demonstrate how I penetrate
Hot incinerate, biting like a dinner date
It's a twist that I missed, what part of the game is this?
Where the losers go and the winners wait
To take the beginner's place
Keep my face placed on how to win the race
If they'd run, I would never chase
Hit 'em with the boom because they set up base
This ain't Texas but this is the west's Chainsaw Leather Face
Keep the golden mic in a leather case
And when it's battle time, I'ma set a pace
Every line that you find already been mine
When you rhyme, man, what a waste
You would think I'd busted a nut in every hip-hop slut
Because there's too many Mini-Me's
And some of y'all cats is finicky
So y'all quickly change to enemies
Blowing up in the industry so they remember me
In their memory for original chops
So you better give spiritual props to your lyrical pops
Speed seeds, I delivered a flock
Busdriver, Ellay Khule, and Ab Rude
A few Goodlife emcees on the prowl
They get beat up every time they want to eat up
And try to feed up on my style
Got your little puny mind
Your little minuscule thoughts mapped out

[Hook][Moka Only]
Against the granular surface, I make my purpose known globally
You purchase this anomolys product
Grass roots, merchant, operate soulfully
Common trades is not that
Watch me wave the wand, I've got a top hat
Pull the magic out of it, pop that pot of rocks out of it
If you are all the salt, I'm the ground temper
If you are all the cult, I'm the leader, hypnotize with minor effort
And made your pressure to pay for pleasure
I find a meadow, relax the mind and measure time in the hour glass
This industry ain't industrious
I dust them off, bust them in action
Hollering in the library, this century's on some hustle shit
Muscular husky work, cardio-vascular passwords
Trust me jerk, us we're parked and ready to swerve
Deserve confetti and took your tape from riperets
Snap a Ritz, rapper, drown them in some soup and split
Found me out the loop, I'm in
Vancou ambassador, upper Eshilon, Arabic to Ecuador
Apitimy, a bigger anatomy, finality
Finiclly earned the salary, big fatalities

[Abstract Rude]
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here, we're smoking in here
It's Ab and Prev and Moka in here, we're open
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here and nobody cares
It's Codename Scorpion in here, we're chosen

[Abstract Rude]
We're smoking in here with both engineers in a studio rear
Just open your ear, we're working in here
The type, that Moka says he's growing his hair
Well give him a year, It will damn near look just like us
And this is for my homies in the cypher
Puffing chaza, we can pull all nighters
Park my car in the rear of the club
Get in the show without a ticket stub, I'm getting love
It reads no smoking on the sign
But I ignore it every single time
Though I don't park in handicaps, that's bad karma
Plus more than a little fine
It's warmer in the summer when the sun shines
I'm a bomber with a marker when I don't see the one time
I need a sponser, I want my own clothing line
None of the brand names, give me one of a kind
Stick to the game plan and it's gonna be fine
We smoke basil, oregano kind

[Abstract Rude]
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here, we're smoking in here
It's Ab and Prev and Moka in here, we're open
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here and nobody cares
It's Codename Scorpion in here, we're chosen

[Prevail]
We're smoking in here, my vocals are clear
Smoking in the language of a mirror
Hexagonal, pentogonal, we're here today and gone tomorrow
Broken armor, eagle talon, crushing spirals
Chest I scalp and fess the signs of Seth
Everyday, intake of a broken crest
I hope for rest but smoking less, makes it harder to deal with stress
So I take the toke in steps
The social sense is old and deaf
They sold the specs to interenets, avenge the debts, reverse the ocean depths
Ain't nothing but molten left
The colt in my breath that's forty-five millilitres fresh
A murder of rest, pressure in text, in hex the next
The destiny of complex Planet X

[Abstract Rude]
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here, we're smoking in here
It's Ab and Prev and Moka in here, we're open
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here and nobody cares
It's Codename Scorpion in here, we're chosenI catch little sleep at night, wake up the next and keep it moving
Context, don't take me out, this raw fusion
Is climaxed, high friction on vestax
And techniques, making my money with less tax
And prestige, as long as I'm cracking my kraft cheese
Calling the cops and I have to leave
I'm either very smart, or incredibly stupid
Ahead of my time, I'm locked in a room with a view of the walls
Iron clap, my rhyme is a firing squad
Watching them fall and grabbing my bowling balls
Holding them all acountable with the mountain of evidence
You're under the table dead presidents
Wouldn't let you walk from the case with a hung jury
A lifetime ban from the mic if you come near me
The upright in odacity and gull
If you feel certain, you'll never get past the steel curtain

Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Or we'll be like fighting.... Mike Tyson
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
You ain't saying nothing, I keep head butting... Mike Tyson
[Mike Tyson] My style is impeduous
My defence is impregnible
Ima eat your style, eat your style kid
[Abstract Rude] Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Clash of the titans... Mike Tyson

Arjures, shoot off arrows like we're gladiator
Even if we get past the piles of knights with armor satire
Hate or die, haters don't you even try
Retreat from your sneak attack leave from us or you won't be back
Or the bishop will chop, will covert diagonals
In a hail of ammo, we'll give you your halo
Stay low in a bunker, resort with the thunder
Or we'll be hotile like german sheppard
And the viking manuever, we're taking Vancouver
To new heights with the viking like, no other producer
With a spiked ball and chain I'm Braveheart, Maximus
With an axe in his hand, slicing up these abstract Pakistans
Never stop, let you not be want again
Me and the Wolverine are the two of the hardest X-Men
Eighteen on the abaracus, hey to you in a happy room
No one comes to the accalade where all the Massmen are made
Clash of the titans in a street for fighting
We meet with the mic and my reach I'm deadly at best
Fuck Elliot Ness I'm a style Al Capone my styles my own
Stop biting... Mike Tyson

Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Or we'll be like fighting.... Mike Tyson
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
You ain't saying nothing, I keep head butting... Mike Tyson
[Mike Tyson] My style is impeduous

Ima eat your style, eat your style kid
[Abstract Rude] Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Clash of the titans... Mike Tyson

Know how to pause you to switch your game plan
While you hearing this you change styles
Can't even tell we're listning to the same man
That we heard when we came out, shang-how
You keep biting off this rhyme writing
Style taking them without liscense, now crowd hypen
I'm navy seal on you foot soldiers
It's kill at will till that shit's over
I'm conceptuable, they just over, incomplete if it's lackluster
They bite like a frustrated boxer
I'm coming down like a paratrooper, hard on ya
If you're not I'm moving and shaking, no creature in you bakers
Bled out, too fragile for Shaq and the Lakers
Abstract's the major, minor, eighty-eight keys solo
With frequency, modulation and foot pedals
All out battle till beef settles
It's inticing, scorpion is in rising
All dead wait get shedded, we're downsizing
Independant, definately enterprising
We get offended when you're blating with the senseless biting

Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Or we'll be like fighting.... Mike Tyson
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
You ain't saying nothing, I keep head butting... Mike Tyson
[Mike Tyson] Everbody always talk about Mike Tyson
Is biting Holyfield
He bit somebody too man, you know what I'm saying
[Abstract Rude] Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Clash of the titans, Ab and Rob the Viking

[Mad Child]
Stop biting, no doubt
Yo Ab, I'm glad you're getting this off your chest
Cause you and Freestyle Fellowship, Project Blowed
You guys are true originators of styles
And it's a compliment when these kids get inspired by what you did
And continue to do. But it's an insult when they get all gassed up
And forget where they got these styles from in the first place
You know? Battle Axe

[Abstract Rude]
That's right[Intro]

[Hook: Luckyiam]x2
Ever wonder why we’re never truly satisfied with life
Under the knife in the microscope hope grows larger
As the day runs marathon length
This is Yo Life
Tell me what you think

[Verse 1: The Grouch]
Everyone came the same no name
To stain the train trail
We bail like bondsmen on em words
Like turds all fun
Spunk speech reach to peak I'm no punk
The crunk I'm all drunk
Sunk like bait you're bite I can't wait
Straight fate friction eviction from this
You're sick, I'm like leverage ahead of this time
Better kids die like eta-piss
I'm like Rederick used to fuse
The unknown in the zone
Foos better get going
I'm knowing who's owing, not me
I got free speech like that's the jackpot
See Yahtzee, don't roll like my whole life seven
Swoll keep peddling, meddling my way
Settling high stay low with the know
Slow with the stroll I'm swoll in the whole with soul
When I roll over flowing the bowl
Knowing the goal I'm whole...
Knowing
I said I'm knowing the goal I'm whole...

[Hook]x1
Ever wonder why we’re never truly satisfied with life
Under the knife in the microscope hope grows larger

Tell me what you think

[Verse 2: Eligh]
In the blink of an eye
You can catch your life passing by
Like traffic on a map
In a wrapper
On the few ways of life
In a cipher of many
Catch a bag full of pennies
Or match a flag to the finish line
How I plan to finish mine?
Man I came to win at this
No one can diminish this is testing my existing
Is an everlasting presence
In the game of life on the central
Medium with a pencil
Etching out my full credentials
Mental packed with an atom bomb
Cause I can have em calm or in a frenzy
That's the way I function
Crunching like my teeth
I believe I can see the future
Feel like a rain drop plummeting
Iridescent nature wasn't built to hate another human being
My rapture
Capturing the purity dubbed when the crow
I bring minds back from the dead
Mission to uphold wisdom
That's the newest
Bringing them from the colder truths
Who is Gandalf? (Ahhhh...)
Legs crossed like a Buddhist
Unarmed when I'm in the standoff
Only when I keep my hands offthe sack
Decorated with math
That you could never contemplate
Less you calculated my beats
Evaporated my beasts
Dilapidated my cleats
You can't walk the path of taken
Man you're life's been forsaken
Taken back to the essence
Legendary accomplishments still
Trying to fill my cup
Trying to fill it up to the heavens
I live by the number seven
Give what I have forever
Never selfish in my learning
Share what I'm earning
But I'm not concerned with your burning
Cause a new leaf I'm turning
I keep living, I keep moving
I keep turning, I keep living, I'm revolving...

[Hook]x1
Ever wonder why we’re never truly satisfied with life
Under the knife in the microscope hope grows larger
As the day runs marathon length
This is Yo Life
Tell me what you think

[Verse 3: Luckyiam]
A blank stare into the wall
Watch his mind start to shift in
Hard to believe that all things
We say, "make em listen"
Believe it though even those
True triple hero's come hard to find
Because they barely swallow pride
No matter what you think
My thoughts sink on surge
Wishing to find others who feel this way
And listen this answer but
Causes chaos in the klutz
So I keep that in mind
When my pen feels to touch a stroke
No lip though my life known its ropes
For beginners to learn as new poets
Take they turn and earn
But life is a bundle of weak
Its free drinks and freeze
With a hell of a beat
You need...

[Verse 4: Aceyalone]
This is yo life tell
Me what you think
What you thought
Tell me what you've been taught
Spin the wheel and
You might just burn for real
Go ahead spin the wheel
You could fight the man of steel
Be all that you can be
Be free even though life costs an arm and a leg on me
I count every minute existing
And I suggest you do the same
Cause life just ain't a game
Momentum is gain it intensifies the pain
But I'm healthy, I'm alive, and I can't complain
I sleep good some nights
Some nights I toss and turn
What happened to all your time
You must have got lots of burns
And you lost your turn
Missed your turn
Now you're heading on a dead end road
What did you learn
Tell me what you think
Then put it on ink
We're on the brink of something new
The missing link

[Hook]x1
Ever wonder why we’re never truly satisfied with life
Under the knife in the microscope hope grows larger
As the day runs marathon length
This is Yo Life
Tell me what you think

[Verse 5: Abstract Rude]
Only pacify when you satisfy
I had the pride of the seven deadly
But my brethren wouldn't let me go astray
So many fall by the way side
Know on any day we could all die
And who's to be the fall guy
For the lost tribe the thoughts
Hired vibes should be locked in archives
The pop is our lives
The bright lights and prize flights
Rep on the line step through the minefield
Break through the time barrier shield
To peel caps back somebody gotta do it
Abstract put the future on the map
Now who could exactly put it down like that
And who could adapt to this many laps around a track
The long winded you felt just long after the song ended
I'mma rap i strongly recommended even through the tinted windows
Or my every now and then limos
They speak on me like they my kin folks
And we been close for years
But that microscope is not welcome around here
Little man difficult, simple man cool
Its typical you might have to fist fight a fool
Gotta crew there and write a few off
Kept what I earned I pay the high cost
This is yo life, are you the boss?

[Outro]Intro:
Change style (like what?) You know. Change it. Ummhum
I just get in these moods man. Make it happen
They brought you the mood, within the music
Now the music within the moodÂ Â 

Hook:
We're torn between the new ways of the present
Between the old ways of the pastÂ Â 
What will be the ways of the future?
How long will the new world last?Â Â 

Verse 1:
The masses are innocent to the magnificent
Atmos ? and shit my raps are significantÂ Â 
So I have to benefit wouldn't you?
If you had skill that other people couldn't do?Â Â 
I'm putting new thought inside your mindÂ 
Fat Jacks makes the music I write the rhymes
Tribe Unique combines to put the vision in the rhythm
It is written certain things are forbiddenÂ 
I remember when a simple rhyme was a jewel
Now you gotta freestyle and act a foolÂ 
The blacker you are the better for being cool
And gettin' screwed
And plus somebody takin' food out your baby's mouthÂ 
You make me doubt the system
When you make a world issue out of O.J. Simpson?

Hook (x2)

Verse 2:
But things are better than they were right?
They industry is flooded with rappers that were tight
But what they are now is something new
And everybody race around for what they gonna do
This year a new sound in the atmosphere to pick and choose
But which is whose and whose is which?
Half the people liked ya better way before ya switched
At last the task becomes a masquerade
Cause when you pay you don't bother
It becomes harder to stay hungary
Because you eatin', ain't keepin' the same company
You don't want any static you think it's copastetic
But that's not livin' better
If you ain't all together (homie)
Don't let your urge go on to live right
Or get your creativity while rippin' on the mic

Hook

Verse 3:
Survin' in the land of juveniles
I'm strivin' while I'm risin' with the brand newest style
Uh my eyes and ears are open
I'm peepin' what they actin' like
The public eats it up, they got big appetite
First page for the rage of a nation
Second page for that nation to awaken
Third page for the old ways
Computers takin' over man but they man made
Fourth page hooray
As told by the God Soundwave
We shall prevail again (prevail again)
Fifth page for the alien (the aliens)
Five years till when?...

A certified family affair of fooling around freely
Phase two of the alpha style freed and Free Willy
We're G's really
God/Gangsta/Griot we are
Covert on a co-op from a Mohawk to dreadlocks
Your simpleton threats have no effects on me and Templeton Peck
We blow you back before we finish the set
I ain't scared I ain't scared
Just because you run your mouth
We ain't running off just because your guns is out
(What fool!)
When in doubt I don't punk out
I bug out like Murdock
And it don't take Sherlock
Elementary dear Watson
It's not rocket science, mic rocking
Every land we go, I ain't getting on crop dusting plane Hannibal
Rap commando
Hand in hand, no "I" in "team"
These other rappers tell you lies, sell you dreams

[Verse Two: Aceyalone]
A.B. Baracus

Don't even have to practice and he still got special tactics
They try to track us down and jack us but the fact is
We mack this so well
It's attractive, magnetic
Miraculous, kinetic
Energetic
Poetic
Always ready to set it and don't you ever forget it
Shit yeah
The proof is in the pudding
But just don't be putting yo' fingers all in pudding when you know you shouldn't
Tapioca
This is poker with no jokers
Don't make my folk us, have to put you in a choker
I got the nerve gas
And I'ma serve that ass
When I swerve past I'll give you the bird bath
I can't be dealt with when I'm on this felt tip
I've walk the world and make sure that it's felt...shit

I like to walk the sky, look 'em in the eye, give it my best try

And when it's overthrown in the back field, I'm grabbing it
We got the oatmeal sticking to ya bone flow

I was raised off musical intuition
My poetical gift is too much to mention
Classified, S is repping from the sky
Who talk that crazy talk off the fly
I've been in my laboratory dissecting specimen
Making beats and rewriting the testiment
I took an estimate, meaning that I estimated
On how many styles I've investigated
With the scorpion, Ab' Rude radical
It's emphatically mathematical and so magical
So let me holla at ya face to face man
From he promise land to the Wasteland
A bomb is two man band with mics in their hand ready to lace man
I rock the microphone gallantly
And roll till I'm over the hump, yeah
Then we jump in the arms of the two turntables and bump
Never will we fake the funk

Do we say the same thang?
We in the same gang?
Access granted now we in the mainframe
Going through the new age
On a crusade
If you ain't with this business get out the Kool-Aid
For my two G plea
We be on point living plush
And the way they do it ain't us
Must of what you heard not enough to quench
We're the starters, you ride the bench

[Aceyalone]
You getting served

[Abstract Rude]
You couldn't hang if I gave you the rope
Yet you claim that you so damn dope
When you know that you can come tighter
You're here and gone like the clouds of a skywriter
As far style, you're just a biter
Vibe sucker
Not a crowd rocker
Faker, in this city of Dodgers and Lakers
Kings
Project Blowedians

Before it all floats away, and you all go astray

The coming of the age and I speak it like a sage
Rappers
Are indentured servants
It's so urgent that we cause some disturbance
Ring the alarm and break out the pistola
Another sound bwoy dies by the hands of the soul controller
Like trying to escape Ebola
But there's no vaccine for your wack scene
Word to Maxine, say the water ain't clean
They're asking for the A-Team ain't no waiting
We'll be there in the nick of time
Yeah and prepare to kick a rhyme
It's the story of my life
Do what cha like
Drink Bacardi at the party but don't touch the mic
Thinking back to the corporation stockade
Rapper slave trade
Masquerade
I walk the outskirts of the big parade
It's lights in the distance
Light the incense
Without any resistance to fire up the pistons
Smash on the gas and knock down the tents
Stop the floats and I represent
Gaffle up the band and make 'em play this
By the powers vested in me they can't resist
Who?!

It's been so long since life felt new
A change of place might help your view
The smoggy grey that hides the blue
But oh what a ray of light might do
It cuts through clouds and grows the trees
It never rains in southern Cali
Just kidding it does sometimes
But not for long before sunshine
Encourage you to exercise your mind
Deep as you can go and high as you can climb
Cause somebody's got to save the art
It's unsafe schools and unsafe parks
It's shanty towns and project homes
Inside the family, loves still strong
Cause even in my hood, light shines through
But oh what a coat of paint might do
What's there for the ghetto youth?
If there's no means to express you
They are and what they go through
Right past [?] from far to [?]
Know what we think we know is true
The older we grow we know the [?]
From donuts to full of life improve
And oh what a coat of paint might do
We've been here before it's deja vu
Nature is a source of great Haiku
Believe in God and He'll stand by you
Do unto others as the golden rule

[Verse Two]
Throughout this journey, many lost souls
Sound made 'em all at they crossroads
If we're brothers or [?]
Just cause I got mine and you got yours
End world hunger can't be hard
Must so many people starve?
Just what will this harvest yield?
Bless our crop of food for real
If I'm deeply low and up above
A species with and without love
Some don't care and some have heart
Art speaks against what tears us apart
Like police brutality
Raise the teacher's salary
Why not? They teach your kids
Are they so small and you so big?
Hell nah, you're just that cold
You don't give a damn to reap what's sowed
True indeed you're three four gold
It's not worth travelling that tough road
It might lead you to your grave
Will one day see mistakes we've made
Through the haze with few sunrays
Respect the old ways and go unscathed
The walls [?] by the train tracks
Graffiti ain't a crime, a way to pay back
Enjoy it while it lasts, it might give us
A rusty train a colorful touch
It must mean much if they're try hard
To stay up all night and paint a whole car
It once looked old they made it like new
Cause oh what a coat of paint might do
We've been here before it's deja vu
Nature is a source of great Haiku
Believe in God and He'll stand by you
Do unto others as the golden rule

Oh what a coat of paint might do {x4}[Abstract Rude]

While I watch Poltergeist, some people of Christ
Crumb roaches and night fall, call it to height
If you will still believe in shadows and thrills
Walk the tight line of light that divides the gilds
Where the masons build up on Haunted Hill
No lights on the grill, black Coupe De Ville
About twelve o'clock midnight, window sill
Where the winds don't will, fingerprints won't set
To think we might reach Mars but haven't figured it yet
The deeper it gets, the more minds must inquire
Streets are ablaze, no jobs and slashed tires
You can't walk by us, we still hold the buyers
Ab, Mok, and P-1's for choir of lions
Fire and iron, everything that melts and bends

Lost lake in the end, high voltage revenge

The petrie dish is placed onto the microscope
Scientists examine what will provoke
A whole nation of humans resulted in ruins
The land by man, disrespected, disease infected
Some communities go unprotected
And every year welcomes a pledge for new beginning
But do we come out winning, lives are ending
Surrendering and being hindered
When do we remember, how do we forget
Our true gender without regret
Science commits homicide, crack new born baby dies
From the desire of intoxication while impregnated, eyes
Are way bigger than that fat tummy
Needed exchange explains the reign of money
The funny, the fickle and the wishy-washy are a little silly
Posse of people, their philosophy is evil

Within the depths of this wood panneled room
This council sits with charts and graphs and prepares the news
Monthly reports fanned a fresco for you enthusiasts
My blues is the moodiest, truly is an uncommon understanding
One twelfth of the Zodiac with eratic planning
Solo yet unified, and so low you drill and drill
But can't reach the bottom of my soul, although you have tried
And some of you just want to know how it all takes
Taking apart to inspect, but don't know how to fix
Some things should just be left a mystery
History repeats itself frequently and causes misery
The people in the middle just dribble away
The eyes on the tower know exactly where you stay
This man in the mirror doesn't know what to do
Except repeat the little pieces that I've learned and given to you
Download it for you, you give it to them
See, there's more than one way to uproot than pull another stem
Crime can dissapear, but at what price
Where the ten lock you in for the night and turn out the lights

You just don't see it
Get off that drug

Don't get me wrong
Even I get weeded
I wouldn't sing this song

[Verse One: Abstract Rude]
Peep the catalogue, what's the song count? Can't count
Break the bong out, blaze ounce
Roll the blunts up, oh how we pump the crowd up
That's one tough life be proud of
Follow the street buzz
City of L.A. to the east Bay
On tour Filmore to the Elray
We hella way out on this journey man turning thirty
Man
We through The Black Sandz Ov Eternia
I never hurry up
Better late than never, greatness can't be rushed earlier
Don't worry yourself just take this advice
The world is not enough and we only live twice
Stress, bottled up you can feel it inside
The potential is infinite and meant to be realized
Together it's strength in you and I
No matter what you do don't commit suicide
Because...

I'm the motherfucker always getting high and shit
I'm the motherfucker always running off the lip
You know why I'm lit
Life's opposite
Then a plan I situated all I get
Frustration hitting me taking me to bitch
Sometimes I hit the world and I want to switch
With my granny up in Heaven who just passed away
Who finally got away from the hell that plagues her
Everyday life, I almost had a wife
Until I fucked it up, back to lonely nights
If your girl cheated first but you stuck it out
Now you made it better, now you made a house
And time went by memories never die
And the trust never dried on the sidewalk of lies
So now you cheat, trying to even the score
But who's really right when it's all out war?
So now you're L.A. snorting coke all day
And you smoke away your problems but they don't go away
Street fighting, bar fighting, not respecting my life
Cause you're living in the dark, never seeing the light
Beeyotch

[Outro: Sunspot Jonz talking]
Yeah that's right. Hey Ab I feel you. Motherfuckers is on all types of drugs. Whether it be love, whether it be control, whether it be hate man, you just don't even know. Motherfuckers is stuck in a paradox of what? Figure out what the fuck that is and get back to me

Go {x30}

"Tell everyone that I am sorry, truly sorry
For all the wrongs I done
I never meant to hurt nobody, noooo
Lord I never wanna do no wrong"Greetings
Ok I'll make this short
We in the house
We got Mikah 9 Abstract Rude Peace
Vic Hop Fat Jack and myself Aceyalone

We come for the glory of the b-boy kingdom
Bring them laughter after which bring them tears

I seen it comin' and knew it was a plot
Legislation had a plan to kill hip hop
I got wind from a snitch I kept in contact w/this
Bitch ass judge who was paid off
Soon after that he got laid off
I'm lettin' niggas know you tryin' to stop a muthafucka's flow
Hold your black stallions and your black sheeps
Black clan aided a nigga and got heat
We met up on Stepney and Market sparked it
Mapped out the target
We gon' take out their number one sergeant
Young and strong we bailed up on their front lawn
To kill the enemy
Remember me
Well if you remember me you'll remember
I'm the one who broke into the pentagon took fouls planted bombs
Now I possess the blueprint
I counter the message you sent
No longer will you slander and tamper w/our music
Copies of the document we're xeroxed
The ghetto took offense in defense of hip hop
Shot down rolled 'em up loc'ed up bailed out
Saved the day
Then into thin air I fade away
Scorpion

We come for the glory of the b-boy kingdom
Bring them laughter after which bring them tears

The story had never been told until now
As the glory of the kingdom come comes down
Disguised as a janitor the washman
I swept and mopped the floors
Better yet I was a spook behind the door
W/a perfect view from the bannister
Feeling like Lee Harvey
'cept I got a hundred million years in me
First thing I did was aim
Lock him in my scope
Squeeze
Bust his melon open now I'm pleased
In the name of MC's
Already passed the time that they allotted me
The housekeeper spotted me
It was either her or me
Click clack
She says I will not say what I see
But I never could have trusted her so I busted her in her chest
Then laughed
Then headed for the elevator shaft
But it was too late the jig was up
There was pigs all in the building
So I tried to escape to the fire escape from homicide
Yeah I killed him
Hangin' from the third story ladder
I dropped and I felt my ankle shatter
No time to lose juice from my bladder
My mission was completed and that was all that mattered
The van was parked a hundred yards from the scene of the crime
But it was hard to run w/a broken foot
Just like I thought they blasted
I took one to the gut
I was laying there thinkin' about death
Just watchin' my blood spill out
Just then the van pulls up and I jump in
And then we pull out (?lickin'?) shouts for the glory

We come for the glory of the b-boy kingdom
Bring them laughter after which bring them tears

I walk in like a normal black
Gun peckin' jaw snatching
Slide
They like the way I glide
To the back break out my backpack and stack my shit up
Ah it's bulging now
Looked around heard a gun shot
Pow
I looked down I whipped out my shit
Unloaded my clip
Jetting by the count I slipped
Tripped out
Landed on my hip crawled out
I hit a tuck and roll up and out
Into a flip and boned out now I'm zonin'
I'm nine Glocks and seven 380's richer
I'm fit to blow the foundation off this beyotch up
Synchronized for the race
I push the button
Nuke the place
Timed myself dashin to the ride
I hops inside
Keys already in the ignition
I cranks it slaps it in drive
Fizorty-fizive seconds til dizamage
Ride b-boy
Kingdom

We come for the glory of the b-boy kingdom
Bring them laughter after which bring them tears

We come for the glory of the b-boy kingdom
Bring them laughter after which bring them tears
