[Hook:]
I had it all
And then I look in your eyes and I watch it all, crash over, again
And oh
I take a look at the tears that I shed and now I know
I'll never change again

[Verse 1:]
Rolled a blunt now I'm staring at the thick smoke
Say i didn't work hard is that a sick joke?
I've lost everything from Rap but never quit though
The hardest working rapper ask Jay or my big bro
You think this shit just fucking fell in my lap?
Too many sleepless nights had me bring hell into Rap
I will never be the same guess they right
Yeah I changed but everything is strange in this fucking rap game
Rappers pissed off cause they can't get a pay cheque
They need to blame someone, so I'm getting the blame yep'
Reporter's on my back yeah they waiting on a slip up
Live TV still came off like a sick cunt
Nothing on a mic that I struggle to do
My fans are watching me grow up so they loving me too
Man its been a crazy ride
My life is like a fucking movie bro
I'm still popping with Nebs in the studio, shit

[Hook:]

Verse 2:]
Try listening to section I bet your kicking your head in
Cause you just realised I'm the best at it
The shit that you spreading
The stress free day ain't apart of my life
But if the stress ever stop then its harder to write
So it's a lose win scenario make life a party bro every single day
It's like my life is getting harder though
And the music with the stress, yeah, it brings plenty
I know a lot for a person in their mid 20's
I met a cunt who had a shiv in his dacks
That's a flash-back, thank fuck I ain't living like that
Don't consider me a preacher i'm just giving you the real world
The hardest thing you have to do in life is find a real girl
Speak the truth loyal mates are a handful
Fake friends are only there when you got your hands full
If people talking and they giving you hate
Make sure you make your dream true
And rub your shit in their face, it's what I done

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Never 'gonna stop with the shit that I do
I seen one to many fake friends dissing me too
Shit you haven't seen, I'm busy
Yeah I barely get a day off
You got my back all night its like I'm trying till my day stop
I ain't chase props I get it when I spray plots on how to run this hip-hop
Still my mother fucking grave spot
It's filled up with beers and purple sprite bottles
Now who the fuck said Kerser is a role-model?
All day I hear all these rumours fly
But when you at the top they try make your movement die
Even rappers acting nice saying my raps are phat
And the jealousy hits i got 'em stabbing my back
But it's part of the game, got no heart you're lame
Sometimes i wanna rewind and just start it again
I'm at the top and its burning them brah
Caught the fame motherfucker yeah kerser's a star!
We out

[Hook:][Verse 1]
I got that special something
I take your pain away
It feels like you been walking on a plank of razorblades
I know that feeling brah
Cause i been there too
You keep that head up
Turn the shit up 'till they turn on you
My mate rang up from lockup
Told me hes doing fine
Last he heard for all he knows
He could be doing 9s
What the fuck i meant to say
Yeah im doing right
And dont you ask me one more time
Why he was doing crimes
I got an email from a fan
He said that i saved his life
But some-how mentioned
Im the reason he blazed the pipe
So how i save him if i made him in the first place
I wonder everyday if i will make my birthday
Im trying to save my fans
From walking thru this fucking life
Im trying to bring them something
But they they be missing something nice
You can fucking cry
Just let that pain away
If your my fan ill be that
Sun to you on them rainy days!

[verse 2]

To tell the truth
To go in public need a couple tabs
Anxiety im a wreck
Its getting fucking bad
I met a fan and he had tears in his eyes
He told me that my music
Saved him and its clearing his mind
How the fuck you think i felt
When he told me that im heaps real
For staying clean behind the scenes
I just popped like 3 pills
But if i didn't pop em
Then we wouldn't of met
I mean i cannot go in public
With out popping them
Damm!

So all i ask if you being a fan
Be fan but dont look up to me
Im fucked in the head
But your the same
So you relate
And if you not then its okay
Cause you can tell that its not fake
Without music i would break
Without the fans i dont have music
So i owe you my life

Cause you know what im like
And its weird these days my mates

They dont bother ringing up
Cause my life on the rap trapped!

Your parents hate me but i made your kids
Stop smashing the pipe
Im from the streets and all the boys carry guns
To get funds up
Now they in a cell
Was it karma or there lucked up
Haters shut the fuck up
You ain't live my life and mind
Untll you have then you talk
And otherwise its quite time
And people talk

They watch a change like the fame
Likes what you wanted shit
Jealousy is everywhere

But if they hating

Can you feel my pain?
Ohhh
I'll be on my way

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Fuck just happened there?
Did i cross the line?
Thought i had it worked out
Till i lost my mind
And i'm just standing in the middle of the traffic
With my finger in the air
Cause i see the world is classic and
All this shit is havoc
Everyone causing commotion
And they point the finger at me
Tryna say that i'm promoting all the wrong shit why?
I'm honest i won't lie
My mind is scrambled eggs
I was looking for a high man
Should be happy when i'm chasing my dream
If i forget to take my tablets then i'm making a scene
You ever felt so fucked up
That you nearly chucked
Everything inside wanna die
Like your luck's up
What the fuck's up
Need another new day
Hold my shit together
But i wonder if it's too late
Plus i just got a call from my doctor
She said the progress comin' to a stop fuck

[Hook: ?]
Underneath a sky so grey
And all i see is pain and hate
Look in my face
Tell me that it's all okay
The sun is gonna shine
It's a brand new day
Talking like you on my page
Tell me do you feel my pain?
But still i Pray
Everything will be okay
The sun is gonna shine
I'll be on my way

[Verse 2: Kerser]
This my last drop of purple
Spinning in a circle
Just for the fuck of it
Xannies with the Serical [?]
Blaze a joint
Now i think i'm on the right path
Light that up
Instant change in my eyes Brah
5 star to 5 star
Flight after flight I
Never stop with rap
Till i die or retire
I'm higher and higher
But low at the same time
I can't explain it
You would have to be in the brain of mine
To understand the upper hand
I've never ever fuckin' ran
From any problems
Gotta stand
And face 'em like a fucking man
And able sense
Got you falling asleep
At the wheel, Jesus Christ
Is this the warning for me
I didn't take it if it was
And now i'm fucking famous
All eyes on me
So it makes it more dangerous
I'ma mess I'ma wreck
But the rap shit
I run that
I need a bit of space
Ain't ever had to come back

[Hook: ?]

[Verse 3: Kerser]
Rappers won't admit
I'ma major role and inspiration
Instead they type on keyboards
And start with all the hatin'
No debating, I'm slaying these tracks
Till i'm laid on my back
Or i'm sprayed with a Gat
You can't say it like that
You can't stay with my raps
Till the day i collapse
Fans know i got their back's
ABK 225
They my bro's man
14 Smoking weed trough a coke can
Now i'm on a program
Don't it all make sense?
If you a hater
I can change your mind in 8 seconds
Fuck you if you didn't get
Scrap that, you're not a fan
You fucking idiot
You hating on me
And i'll bring you to the pit of it
Take you to the industry
And make you smell the shit of it
Where my brain at?
Did the fame effect it?
It's the Kers
On my way to the death bitch

[Hook: ?][Chorus] x2
Say all the things that you wanna say
And you can't take back, what have you taken away
Cos I feel you, I feel you

[Verse 1]
This shit right here is for the kid on the street
Headphone, zone alone as he spits to the beat
And his mum is in the next room, crying out tears
In a battle with poverty, been fighting for years
But he raps at the lifeline
Feeling like the right time
Labels keep ignoring and he can't afford a mic why?
His big brothers out hustling packs
Makes it red dot on the house but he's got trust in the rap
But he's going to the shows
No-one's listening to his flows
But he knows that his dope
Copping kisses on the throat
Off a girl that he loves, but she don't love him back
Guaranteed she'd have his back, if he made it in rap
And it's fucked up
Cos everyday is getting harder
Surrounded by the street, it's kinda hard to play it smarter
What the plan when his man got a gun pulled?
In his face, on the street there's only one rule
Payback, revenge at fucking all cost
Lets shots fly through his house without a door knock
Running out of time and the crime getting red hot
He needs face in a maze gonna get lost
Why rap? Feeling like he getting no-where
So much shit to say, but he just feeling like they don't care
He keeps writing, smoking up in his bedroom
A few cunts out and they looking for his head too
He gets new he gotta to move; he ignores that
His house got sprayed, he sees his mum on the floor - flat
Fuck no, he breaks down 'No more please'
Puts his ear to her mouth, bet she won't breath
No it won't be all good in the end
And fuck rap now he won't even look at a pen
And years later he's a mess, drug fucked, berserk
Still the only thing he visions everyday is her - his mum

[Chorus] x2
Say all the things that you wanna say
And you can't take back, what have you taken away
Cos I feel you, I feel you

[Verse 2]
Young chick, 18 with a bus pass
Heaps smart, hides the fact that she puffs glass
Hot as, tight jeans with some air max
Over life and she staring at the train tracks
Hates catching busses and the trains but she broke as
Lives at home with her mum, she don't know Dad
Cos he split, but she never thinks of that shit
Gotta couple guys on the side, it's getting bad quick
She hates life and despise all the sleaze bags
She only talk to 'em so she can get a weed bag
What's love? Nah she never got none
She had one real friend, but she dead from a gun
So the story begun
She started slanging the drugs
That means the same time, she was hanging with thugs
But know she flirts little bit
But it never legit
Enough to make a fucker think that she keen for the dick
Till one night she be out in the shortest dress
So she can get a bigger size when she scored, I guess
It wasn't in the plan but she rocking to the party
Stashed spot bud, they left tick for the money
Bourbon catching up so she off to the restroom
She gets followed by a dude to the next room
I ain't in the mood but she got some shit to do
But he ain't even listen, tell me what's it leading to?
And he push her to the bed, she bump her head
And it leaks out red, she nearly dead
But the piece is he fucked her, comes in and up her
But she wakes up in the hospital and hides it with the laughter
She pregnant, and she ain't even know the father
But she getting real confused cos she wants to have it after
Everything that happened is the way that she lived
Her daughter got no daddy now she grew like she did - on the street

[Chorus] x3
Say all the things that you wanna say
And you can't take back, what have you taken away
Cos I feel you, I feel youI ain't going nowhere i ain't ever leaving get used to me im the host for this evening host of you screaming i can see your demons see me in real life got you thinking that your dreaming (x2)

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Fucks happening
Yeah it's been a minute
Dick inside the box
I think I left my semen in it
Aye lad
It's that time of the year
On stage, new watch and the shiniest ears
I'm rocking Melbourne first
This time around
In the CBD, just drivin' 'round
When I hit that stage in Melbourne man
There ain't many that compete with Melbourne fans
They pumped as fuck, they jumping up
They know the king, gon' fuck shit up
V.I.P in the V.I.C
Melbourne go hard, I might D.I.E
It's the Kers, I could make a nun pop her dress
If I put it in her bum, am I holy blessed ?
Next up is Sydney man
My hometown shit, I got the sickest plan
You should spit it loud, while I'm spitting it proud
Rates and Jay on stage throwing pingas to the crowd
Uh, hold up, we might get banned
That big jet plane, just might not land
Before we crash more, please let me end my joint
King Kong shit, swinging off centrepoint
So dope I'm the colder, open the whole bar
While I'm kicking back having coke with that cola
Then I'm off from Syd to Bris
Big signs when I land like the sickest is, here
Ask shit
The Q.L.D, gonna go so nuts from the new LP
And I bet mother fucking, ready steady raise the roof bruh
Fucking am I dreaming ? Cause I'm beaming in a new car
In a new state, with a few mates, on stage in Bris, with the new pay
Punchline, fuck that ima rack one
Can't afford my album, go to stores and fucking dack one
That ain't the end yet, I got some great shit
I got some bitches throwing bras on the stage, shit
I'm up here with Rates and Jay, and state to state, it's still A.B.K
Uh
Bring me back down to earth, they said I'm lost, fucked up and I'm down in Perth, shit
Where to go, cause I'm late to the show, in Perth, swear mums it's the craziest bro and I left my mind there, like a couple of times
If you find it let me know, what the fuck can I rhyme
Now I'm in Fremantle, west of Aus
Where the pills are popped and the energy hot
Party from the sun up, party when the sun down
Then I'm meeting Adelaide with another comedown
But it's all good, cause the bud here
When I land, have the dealer with the truck here
Screaming "fuck yeah", this the life brah
So smooth, so fresh, looking nice huh
See me live bruh, it's the best shit
Throwing ice at the crowd, going hectic
Cunts getting cut up in the moshpit
Only joking get your tickets from Oz Tix
They blame me, saying I'm a bad guy
I'm just looking for some head, like a magpie
More dates on the way, hitting Tas to
Don't ask why, I'm just feeling like I have to
Newcastle love the king
When I hit that stage with a hundred spliff's
And just throw to the crowd, when they get kicked out
Then I rock it in the street, that's how they knew we getting down
Say you gonna shoot, you aim for me
I gotta a pound underground, in da A.C.T
I'll share mother fucker, I'll pass it around
As I leave, drive by's on the Parliament House, huh
King dropped, and it topped the charts
But it happens every year, we told em from the start
Get your tix now, you can call it promo
I should have a dollar sign as my logo
King dropped and they saying it's the best yet, cop your tickets, see ya there, DEADSET !

I'm feeling on the of the world again
And yo Nebs, we've done it again
Go cop that album King
See why it went number 1
And so, you know the go
I'll see ya's at the show
It's time to party
Kerser, Nebs - we out[Hook]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
Bet this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope
Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the frontlines with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1]
I'm the last hope, do it cause I can't cope
Fuckin' weird obsession gonna leave me with my heart broke
Plus last night there's three cars at my house
Dont know what they planning sittin with the lights out
Im inside, with a weapon by the front door
I could start a war and get em killed now with one call
I can't be fucked though, drama at another plan
And for all I know these people parked could be a bunch of fans
Does my fucking head in, give me fucking space
Explain it to my girl, yo we gotta get another place
Take a big breath, thats for certain
This your dream Scott, now was it worth it?
Im stressed out I got an album to make
I got a tour to do, now the hours won't wait
And I swear to god I pictured it so different if I made it
You think I really give a fuck if people there are hatin?
Bruzz

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Call it what you will, rumours fly round
All these stories make me laugh as I fly down
Im a target for these people damage my name
He's a crack-head flippin' out with a fried brain
Haha, you gotta be kiddin
If the rock was my addiction would I be in this position?
I didn't think so, I'm success
I do it properly but I struggle with the fucking stress
I ain't touched a pipe in a fucking long time
Never will again, go and listen to some songs of mine
You think you know me right, the flow is tightened
Overnight, they think happend Jesus Christ this rappin' took like half my life
So take a seat back, let me roll this big spliff
On a beach with a cup of something mixed shit
Feelin' faded as, and maybe thats what makes me rap
The way I do I'm living off the fact that people play my tracks man

[Hook][Verse 1]
A young lad and hes searching for that cash right
Cause he ain't really had much growing up and thats why
He got his eyes on the stars he got big dreams
He started writing raps around the age of sixteen
His friends would trip man, they telling him he got skill
And if he didn't rap he'd be known just to pop pills
He keeps beefing with cops, man his rappings are shit
A young cunt catch a charge, cop a slap on the wrist
He moves along, meets his misses at eighteen
He buggin out he just wishes he'd stay clean
They joke about it 'magine if he bought a wedding ring
He didn't know it but she stays with him through everything
He got a cool brothers trying to discover
Why youd never trust a snake, man they'd die for each other
So his lifes still kicking it, I swear the kid lives rap
Taking every opportunity, no time to sit back
No money in the bank so he gets to the breaks
No doing it to rap, its to get off his face
Whats more important man his visions distorted
And there isnt a warning he just leaves without caution
He drops a tape now he kinda got a local buzz
A couple heads in the scene check he knows whats up
Some enemies changed, they wanna be mates
But his eyes on the dream, he ain't dealing with fakes nah
He meets the scene and gathers most the cunts are fake as
Makes his own path while his older brother makes tracks
He steps to battles man hes serving em up
And he ain't even fucking notice cause hes swerving on drugs
But his buzz getting bigger, labels turn and ignore
But that ain't gonna keep him down cause hes burning for sure
At a show hes selling tapes gives out one for free
The best choice he ever made cause the cunt got beats
And at the time he didn't know it but his chances of failure
Dropped cause hes with one of the best in Australia
When it comes to making beats so the lad is excited
Fan base on the rise and the rappings are tightest
He got his sound and the album was lethal
Got a different reaction out of some of his people
From fans to mates, say hes not the same
But the last 7 years feel like a couple of days
Go get fucked that hes changed
Man he knows who he is
A couple beats flipped now you gonna say hes a bitch
But he doesnt really
Care
Cause the fans are screaming yeah
And the lights in his eyes feels like a dream there
The main plan is officially in motion
Any second now he sees his dream and hes approaching
And they say they know him, well I double please
If you fucking knew me you would know this is about me

[Outro]
Every cunt saying they know everything
Had to break it down for yas, now talk the shit
Kerser, we outI see these bright lights
These people hunt for cash
I can’t adapt, how you sell your soul for hundred stacks?
My life is worth more, my pride is Kers raw
I’m in the city bout to start a fucking turf war
Cos I’m so proud, my bottle watch it go down
I ain't seen no King, so I'm gonna make my own crown
I coped a call, Stracy's sitting in a prison cell
I'm spinning out, like where's my boys, cos Shoei's in as well
Is this the life we chose? Something for the nicest clothes
Sit back with the ice and doe, watch my brothers fight for hope
Fuck rhyming, if it does than it's a bonus
I say what's on my mind, and if it rhymes I didn't notice!
Hairs up on your arms stand, realness in my palm man
I hold the Earth then curl it round, no wonder people can't stand!
Safe promises, I made the snakes obvious
Sometimes I don't know who to trust, even my mates I gotta to give
Up on paranoia, burnt too many bridges
Just realised it rhymes - Kerser is the sickest!
Fuck rhyming, if it does than it's a bonus
What happened to that line man, my brain is gone it's hopeless
But I still be the realised
That's why they feel this, from the deals that the real missed
That's the bad thing bout grabbing the mic
The best rapper that you find probably hasn't been signed
And it'll stay that way, but me I'm gonna make that change
You weighing up those [?] you be getting fed, I'm gonna take your plate
Yeah you lads cry, strong - I've got my Dads pride
Never giving up. You holding beef it turns to mash pie
I think I'm built different, you can see the skill in it
I did this shit myself, I never ever got a mill ticket
Since the 'Highest Man', shit I've been the highest man
Promoters call my manager, you best to be supplying grams
Where I go from here? Confused, not knowing what to do
Got no other option to, make a change - I'm opted to
You can dislike, shit ice, spit fire
Imagine what I'd be, if kid never hit pipes
I sware on something you won't witness again
You won't experience I vibe like what I've writ with my pen
Because I'm sicker than them - this is the finishing slam
Fucking ill, you know the deal because I did it again - UH![Verse 1]
Me and Rates found a magnum .44
It was my dads we was asking him what thats for
He said he had some enemies and we were too young
He said mum had left him, he can't tell us too much
We went back home to mums now we broke as
She always crying, she depressed I
Need to go back and work out what the fuck was up
It's been buried, block it out now we fucked on drugs
And mum can't work out why cops cuffin' us
Slapped Rates in the face cause he puffed and buzzed
And my dad used to ring when he was drunk as fuck
I hear him fightin' with mum, I think he loves her but
I'm only 10 years old now I hug my little brother
Love my mother and my father but theres gotta be another
Way for us, I watched it fall apart
I'm 11 years old with a broken heart
It's kinda funny cause the shit that teared my family apart
Is the same reason why my girls leaving, gotta laugh
Life that I know, live in pain, gotta go
Cause my brain doesn't know why I play in the zone
On the streets doin' breaks where my fate would lay
Felt so locked in, couldn't break away
Don't feel the same today, cause rap saved my life
And when Rates hears this will he play it twice
Or are the memories too much, remember it true bruzz
Come along the road, don't forget what I do cuzz
You doin it too, make moves and march on
Take my life now this could be my last song, I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Life just ticks, I might just quit
In a life like this,s is my life just shit?
I got a feeling that for me it's kinda on its way
I had to tell you why I'm here I'm being honest aye
I picture gun blasts, two cunts, one mask
My thin blood marks walls, fuck I must laugh
That's a dream that I had on my birthday
Just luck that I fit it in with word play
Now if that happens I am right I was a genius
If it doesn't I am paranoid I mean this
Theres my life hate I'm used to it
Last 10 years mate got me movin' quick
And I fight with my girl like a movie flick
Cause she listening to rumours by a groupie bitch
I can't take this shit, I'mma break to bits
I got my taste of fame and it tastes like shit
Everyone talk shit and they takin' shots
They don't know who I am but they breakin' Scott
Is there anyone there that could make it stop
I don't need no ho tryin' to take it off
I just need my road when I'm takin' off
And I hit that stage while I'm blazing pot
This the life of a rock star stuck in the past
Thats the 2-2-5 yeah I'm chuckin it up
Need space today, I need to take my brain
Reconstruct that shit before its sprayed away today
Yeah, let it roll, yeah

[Verse 3]
Tell me do you hear this, write a review
They say I can't rap deep what you like me to do?
You wanna hear about a blade tucked since I hit 17
Paranoid, fucked up, like I think they gettin' me
You wanna hear about smoking till your chest claps
Or 16, doing breaks I need to get that
Or bills piling up on top of the fridge
Mum yelling at the paper, how she gonna pay this
How we got a place to live but its slipping quick
She has to split, need my own place I'm spinning out shit
But I moved out young, turned boy to man
I got my dad pride now, come and join the clan
Now I don't give a fuck and I'm ready for war
I'll take your head from your neck leave your head at your door
Fuck everyone dissin', you dont know what I am
I'm a motherfuckin soldier and I'm goin at them
That's why I'm sellin' CD's on the verge of greatness
Once this drops I'll be referred to as the greatest
So sit back theres no reason to hate
And if you still hate me now, best believe that your fake aye

[Outro] x2
No way will I end it now
I gotta take these thoughts and send em out
I am lost so lost but I need a buzz
Cause it helps me knowin' fans need me cuz[Intro: Fortay]
Come smoke with me
Come smoke with me, ay

[Verse 1: Fortay]
Pass the bong, pass the juice in the bar
And watch a cunt punch on like a blue at the pub
See these dumb fucks wrong, they can't do what I does
Smoking blunts fucking longer than Cuban cigars, who hah
Want to puff with the best? Then come smoke with me
Nothing but the esh in the sesh, the way its supposed to be
Something like the best in the west, but it ain't locally
Grown esh, blown by F, known for potency
Blowing when there's no spinning like Shane Warne
I'm smoking 'til I'm finished, and beginning to blaze more
Won't diminish, going with it, I stay in form
Up in the clouds getting lifted, I raise a storm
Bitch, my day long, so take schlong to your mouth
Like you're blazing bong, suck the babies from
My nutsack, I blow loads and clutch stacks
Known 'round my postcode for just that

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Good weed, bag packed with the fat stack
I'm spending this today and I am looking for that mad
Bud with the smells that can linger for days
If I was sitting on a pound, still won't give you a blaze
Greedy motherfucker when it comes to that green shit
Hundred dollar note as the paper, and weed lit
I made the weed anthem for the country to blaze to
What Fort? Who you call when you looking the way, ooh
I ain't even mention that I'm off of my guts
And I'm high from the morning to when I'm rocking the clubs
Its the Kers, with the Fortay, weed? That's for ureshay
Two of Sydney's best, got it fresh, rep the raw way
That's why you're hanging for the shit that we drop
These fuckers always watching me, someone give 'em a clock
I'm signing out with a fuck you, get fucked and thank you
We just made another fucking hit for you to blaze to

[Verse 3: Redbak]
I'm still chopping up plants, like Edward Scissorhands
And I bet you could picture that, with that Instagram
I'm amazing, my gift and [?], and all of my wits intact
After years of punching cones, bigger than witches hats
And its a fact, I write my best lyrics when I'm smashed
Then go over them like, "Fuck yeah, this is mad!"
And I still don't know who went through my hidden stash
Did I have one to begin with? Is what has me tripping bad
Fucking memory loss, I should eventually stop
But will I ever? And forever? Potentially not
Red pops out of the blue, when someone's mentioning pot
Hey boys, pack us a cone, are you sharing or what?
Honest to God, I got so much resin in my lungs
That sniffer dogs start to bark, when I'm walking past
I swear that if I ever decided to donate blood
The patient receiving it, would get an instant buzz
With some heavy waiters, wave middle finger to any haters
See us blazing j's, maybe grape flavoured blunt papers
I'm feeling weightless, in orbit, floating inside of a spaceship
That's the death tape, bitch, dock it as part of your playlist

[Outro: Kerser]
Kerser, Fortay, Redbak
South West Sydney, West Sydney
Some shit for you to blaze to

Ain't nothing better than the present
Smoking right here baby, on that bomb

[Verse 1 - Kurupt (Tha Dogg Pound)]
I'm a mystery, nigga

Ask forever to be known as one of the greatest emcees, nigga
Start baking and frying suckers; Rotisserie, nigga
In the club with your bitch, and your bitches best friend!
And the best friend of the sister, of your bitches ex-man!
Nigga Gotti Xavier, Magneto, Texan, Mafioso, 40 Nickels, motherfucking X-Men
Nigga smoking for eons, only those kush grown trees
Smokin' and rollin', I'm on Fortay, Kerser and SQZ
Super fly and Snoop LT and DAZ

Now come smoke with me

[Chorus] x2
We just wanna, wanna, wanna smoke up all your weed
We just love it, love it when that bitch is on me

La, la, la, la, la, la x4

[Verse 2 - Daz Dillenger (Tha Dogg Pound)]

Nigga you know the game

[?]
You know I lit 'em up and let you know it's just dust
You know we rollin' 'round, we crowding all you fools
Nigga's your hottest sound? That shit ain't really cool
You know I smoke heavy, overload blow out your motor
It's 93 Octane, I run that ass over
With them 3 Aussies, with them 2 Doggies
You know we pop and get it crackin', yeah they all up on us
You know I can't call it, but then I see it now
See I'm the [?] went from yelling out Bow Wow!

Fortay, Kerser, SQZ, DAZ
Kurupt, yeah we do it we the DPG
Fortay, Kers n Crew, SQZ, DAZ
Kurupt, DPG, that how it s'possed to be

[Verse 3 - SQZ]
We tearing pages out the Bible and we rollin' them up
The type of motherfuckers blazin' out the back of the bus
We get of tap with you cunts
Rock up with DAZ and Kurupt
Come smoke with us
Motherfucking straight damage your lungs
Buds big as David Banner we he crackin' the shits
South West Motherfucker dropping classical hits
Middle finger in the air, straight grabbing my dick
And feel my fist up on your chin if you ain't having my dick

One hit and it's a coughing fit
Doctor, Doctor need some oxygen
Avoiding officers, we off again
Any intersection, throwing off, throw imposter shit
Mobbing in this take, what I hit? Wobble a bit
Type of fly cunt to put a knob in your bitch
It's that anonymous kid, to get you off of your tits
Have you bush dancing around to co-robbery shit
I co-operate and man I'm off my face and
Crew always know I be often spaced
Back 'em up, that's an occupation
Smoke a lot with the foreign nation
Smoking a ghost but I'm rappin' to save, maintain day to day with the maddest of strange
Switch flows like you're racking your brain
What you think that the habits have changed?!

La, la, la, la, la, la x4

[Verse 4 - Kerser]
Woke up 'bout 10am
Fucked a bad bitch in a camper van
Weed zipped up in sadie bags
Top of the charts yeah I have to brag
Get a cunt keen to stab you up
Leave with your weed and Maxis brah
What they gonna do when we rollin' up?
Come smoke with me, got a bowl of buds
If you ain't got weed, don't roll with me
If you ain't got a bag, don't talk to me
Should I admit that here? Yo probably not!
Why'd they get mad when I dropped the S.C.O.T
Album, how come me on valium, popped another 100 000
Wait, chop it up 'cos I got the bud
Eyes so red when I rocked the club
Sparking up weed on the fucking Qantas
And I promise, never to stop this!
Drop sick everytime I spit
If you see me out, high as shit!
Fact with rap; got a baggie dacked
Try to spit this shit but your lagging lad
And they all talk shit, us cunts are best
We're sick, Kers One yeah the cunt is fresh

Yeah I'm back for more
Bitch stressed out now I have to score
Hydro, Sticky, Orange Hairs
I knows I be off my head
Roll it up and light that shit
Tell that slut to ride the dick
When I rap they know it's me
King Kers come and smoke with me - We out!

[Chorus] x2
We just wanna, wanna, wanna smoke up all your weed
We just love it, love it when that bitch is on me

La, la, la, la, la, la x4

[Verse 5 - Fortay]
Don't drink and drive
Smoke and cruise
Don't think that I'm high, better smoke me 2!
Tell them bitches hold the line
I ain't high rollin' but I'm rollin' high
You can suck the dick, but don't touch the blunt
Never loved a bitch, so fuck a cunt
You wanna puff on this you can suck bud
She said "Just one hit?" so I cuffed the slut
I'm only joking, I'm only smoking
That ho ok - No bones are broken!
Remo got a sack of that
This weed ain't for no cataracts
Ain't brought in shops, see Fort as got
Much option when it's bud choppin'
Running out of weed the only time I've got a drug problem!
These undercovers, these motherfuckers, approaching me like "Do you sell bro?"
Dancing in the clubs the only time, you'll catch me moving elbows
Light a chronic, hydroponic
Hit it, than my boys will get it
Sort of like a gang of sluts, I call this song a joint effort
I'm rollin' weed, come smoke with me
These broke bitches wanna smoke for free
They blowin' O's, I'm blowin' P's, wanna toke than she better blow the D
Forgive me father it it's wrong, I'm hittin' bongs - The Weed Sparker
Stay in love with Mary Jane but bitch I ain't no Peter Parker!

[Chorus] x2
We just wanna, wanna, wanna smoke up all your weed
We just love it, love it when that bitch is on me

La, la, la, la, la, la x4[Intro]
You tired again cunt?
*Kerser and Nebs muttering*
Ayo look, I'm gonna say some shit yeah?

[Verse 1]
A bad bitch tryna catch me with an eye wink
I tell her "Fuck off, go and pour my drink"
King Kers, Nebs One at the fresh shit
Your dream girl treating us like she desperate
And she ain't even wanna speak to you
So we throw her to the crew like sweet [?]
She away, eshay
Everything is esh-freight
My mission is to get paid
Blew a stack at the mall for the fuck of it
Out of everything I brought I only wore half of it
Got 'em jealous, Aussie Hip-Hop has a new face
That's why my posters hanging in your girlies room mate
What's a pawn to a king?
Bitches use my film clips for a porno, it's sick
I'm still flipping cash, Nebs still on the payroll
He gets his cash then he looks at me like 'HEY YO!"

[Chorus]
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
Sipping lean at the spot is where I be found
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
I got my weed with a bottle with a mean sound

[Verse 2]
In the studio with Nebs and we sipping on some rich shit
Bitches screaming at the door for some real dick
Money on our mind, Gucci on the shirt
Do the Kers bitch, do it, do it 'til it hurts
Why you angry at your sales, you can't move nah?
My whole crew move units, that's the truth brah
Took my missus to the snow for a month
Came back, new pay fans are loading me up
It's all the same, I'm a hustler I came from the streets
The same ones that play this saying "Fuck the police"
In the hood, drive through in my new car
See the boys, call the shots, then I cruise brah
I'm a Rap God, no Shady tho
More drugs, more liquor, more crazy bro
Next promoter that is shifty with the bread swap
I'm leave it at this *click* headshot

[Chorus]
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
Sipping lean at the spot is where I be found
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
I got my weed with a bottle with a mean sound

[Bridge]
*Kers and Nebs muttering*

[Chorus]
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
Sipping lean at the spot is where I be found
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
I got my weed with a bottle with a mean soundFucks happenin, yeah its been a minute

On stage, new watch and the shiniest ears

They pumped as fuck, they jumping up
They know the king, gon' fuck shit up

Next up is Sydney man
My hometown shit, I got the sickest plan
You should spit it loud, while I'm spitting it proud
Rates and Jay on stage throwing pingas to the crowd
Uh, hold up, we might get banned
That big jet plane, just might not land
Before we crash more, please let me end my joint
King Kong shit, swinging off centrepoint
So dope I'm the colder, open the whole bar
While I'm kicking back having coke with that cola
Then I'm off from Syd to Bris
Big signs when I land like the sickest is, here
Ask shit
The Q.L.D, gonna go so nuts from the new LP
And I bet mother fucking, ready steady raise the roof bruh
Fucking am I dreaming ? Cause I'm beaming in a new car
In a new state, with a few mates, on stage in Bris, with the new pay
Punchline, fuck that ima rack one

Where to go, cause I'm late to the show, in Perth, swear mums it's the craziest bro and I left my mind there, like a couple of times
If you find it let me know, what the fuck can I rhyme
Now I'm in Fremantle, west of Aus
Where the pills are popped and the energy hot
Party from the sun up, party when the sun down
Then I'm meeting Adelaide with another comedown
But it's all good, cause the bud here
When I land, have the dealer with the truck here
Screaming "fuck yeah", this the life brah
So smooth, so fresh, looking nice huh
See me live bruh, it's the best shit
Throwing ice at the crowd, going hectic
Cunts getting cut up in the moshpit
Only joking get your tickets from Oz Tix
They blame me, saying I'm a bad guy
I'm just looking for some head, like a magpie
More dates on the way, hitting Tas to
Don't ask why, I'm just feeling like I have to
Newcastle love the king
When I hit that stage with a hundred spliff's
And just throw to the crowd, when they get kicked out
Then I rock it in the street, that's how they knew we getting down
Say you gonna shoot, you aim for me
I gotta a pound underground, in da A.C.T
I'll share mother fucker, I'll pass it around
As I leave, drive by's on the Parliament House, huh
King dropped, and it topped the charts
But it happens every year, we told em from the start

They talking about skill, let me drop it on the head
They talking about pills, let me pop em till im dead
I'm the curse of the shit that means words that i writ, now take you back in time to my earliest shit
When i drop my mixtape yeah they try to ignore
When they cop the shit it's great now they try to applause
I ain't here for you to dick ride, cos I spit the sick rhymes
See my in my clique light up getting rich
I won't stop till I'm claiming it all
I've be warned its gonna hurt, will I remain in this form?
Stand in the depths not a chance of it yet not yet man or ever imma dance till the death
I'm the man with the shit but im loosing my brain
10 years strong only the truest remain
Oh you need a couple facts? Check the charts when my shit drops!
I'm doing this for us, thats a trust - FUCK HIP-HOP!

[Hook] x2
Cos I'm up till the early morning
Writing these rhymes same day I record them
Need a brake that's what they keep telling me
Still the same Kers looking for a felony

[Verse 2]
You say I changed like way to much
I haven't changed once so wait you cunt
I mean I got a lot fresher when I got a fucking cash flow
That's no joke, blow smoke watch the ash, though
This is my whip yeah I bought it out-right
They used to say I was broke yeah now try!
Mother fucker I can hustle my shit
Snowy mountains if I cum on your tits
Let me get into the shit no-one do it like me
That's why you so damn attached it's the truth when I speak
An you watch me rise up, climb up and ride up
Thanking my fans every track I'm your life brah
Cos I'm here I ain't ever going no where
But if they get me killing me back man you better swear
I ain't scared I'm prepared for the future
So many haters, lets see if they shoot brah

[Hook] x2
Cos I'm up till the early morning
Writing these rhymes same day I record them
Need a brake that's what they keep telling me
Still the same Kers looking for a felony

[Verse 3]
We ain't ever gonna leave, we ain't leaving
This is spare time crush your chest you breathing
I ain't wanna hear all the shit they talk 'bout
Room full of rappers? Then fuck it man I'm walking out
I ain't wanna hear about your next CD
Unless I'm riding with you, otherwise leave me
I'm in my own zone standing on the top of shit
Once a month for 4 years I've been dropping hits
That includes albums every year too
Fuck a hater I can see shit with a clear view
An they told me chill why you always angry man
Cos you hated now you back here as a fucking fan
What am I meant to do welcome you back
You doubted at first I should belt you for that
Only joking man a fan is a fucking fan
Support me I got you I'm the fucking man (im the fucking man x4)

[Hook] x4
Cos I'm up till the early morning
Writing these rhymes same day I record them
Need a brake that's what they keep telling me
Still the same Kers looking for a felony[Intro]
Seem my dreams won't go away
So it's more like a nightmare
Keeping me up all night
Like a nightmare
It's taking over my mind
My desire
Burns inside, like a flame
And it can't and it won't be contained
'Cos I gotta be... famous

[Chorus]
You don't really want the fame though
You don't really want the fame no!

[Verse 1]
They heard a shot fired
Another shot fired
You driving in a race, spinning with a popped tire
And you've been pushed by the radios element
I'm the first fucking rapper to make the radio irrelevant
Fuck the mainstream, I don't need a handout
There's something about the aura of the Kers because I stand out
4 cunts cruising high in a range rover
Yelling ABK, tell these rappers game over!
I've been working, probably find me in the studio
At the top, and my whole fucking crew can flow
The proof is there, we the team at the top
I'm a sniper with the raps so you [?] to pop
I've been killing shit for years
You know spitting insane raps
From a town where cunts are on the rocks like the train tracks
If time moves quick, shouldn't life try to keep up
Instead of being slaves to the system you in deep fuck

[Chorus]
You don't really want the fame though
You don't really want the fame no!

[Verse 2]
And here's a picture with words look
He at high school, he started year 10
Things a little different this year, he don't fear them
Peer pressure play a part, started seshin' in the park
Girls undressing him to fuck, introduce him to the glass
And shit he going down hill
Last night he had a puff and some brown pills
Everything in life has gottin' him feelin' irrelevant
It's fucking with his mind and yet his brain is not developed yet
This the story of the victim
Of the suburb, and it's sad 'cos I can pick from them
Meet 'em all the time, kinda crazy with the crime
Got them play with my mind, 'cos they keep saying my rhymes (It's King Kerser)
But it's not want it's is
Like a shoulda started different with a positive twist
And they say I'm saving lives, I'm just giving you mine
And in the process, hopin' somehow you can live through my rhymes - The King

[Chorus]
You don't really want the fame though
You don't really want the fame no!

[Verse 3]
And if I ever get knocked, there'll be riots the next day
The Nebulizer caused commotions as soon as they pressed play
Buds in the sadie, got some raps for the next night
With a fucking xani so I'm sleeping on the next flight
It's fucking crazy, I'm your everyday cunt
But there's something special 'bout me
I'm a legend, what's up? Shit
There's that arrogance they tell me they hate that
The rawest rapper on my level, cannot debate that
Somebody said I fluked it, I'm fluking what?
The 10 year of blood and sweat? I never choose to stop
I was rocking gigs with my mates in the crowd
Broke as fuck, on the train. I had to make it, but how?
'Cos these labels didn't want it, I'm too raw for the air
I made it to the top, now they scratching their heads
Wait.. How'd it happen? I'm a weapon in my own right
You can be inspired, do your thing but don't bite
It's Kers 1

[Chorus]
You don't really want the fame though
You don't really want the fame no!

[Outro]
Me and Nebs have that new album cooking
Ready November 7th
Ready to fucking shit up again
Taking over the game
And um... we out[Verse 1]
Life's a road that you follow til its closed off
Pick a turn make a break before the roads blocked
Many follow they dont really pick their own paths
Me I'm different see they welcome me with closed arms
I just shrug 'em off, tell 'em they can have it back
It changes everything, let me tell you tragic facts
Mates treat you different, swear to god they think your changing
In your brain you stay the same and now you can't put up with fame
And once that paranoia settles in, your barely going public
Just to leave your fucking suburb need to rally up an army I mean
Hold my head high, now I got them red eyes
State to state forget about a decent sleep or bet time
I'm on my girls nerves, always on the fucking move
She thinks I changed I tell her girl you gotta trust me too
Otherwise, right in front of her eyes
She's gonna watch me fall apart got people judging my life
But fuck em

[Hook]
Tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Verse 2]
It's funny back in class, teachers said I'm hopeless
They said they seen potential but I lack the focus
Funny twist, I was dreaming of this
I hope they see me now compare our fucking payments and shit
Man I swear in the back of my mind, I knew it'd happen in time
And now its actually mine, so
Does that mean what I seen was another sign?
Or am I crazy and I'm searching for another rhyme
Its like theres two of me, rapping what it do to me
All I've done was keep it real, and now you see the truth in me
I ain't never mean to glorify drugs
I just told you bout my road and now the story's blown up
But I'mma ride it out, fucking oath I'm riding proud
We can go together all you gotta do is find the sound
I'm not depressed, nah that wouldn't be the right word
In the studio I leave my mark and the mic's burn

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Am I ever on your mind? Do you listen when I rhyme?
So far up, never missing a design
Cause I'm the blueprint, time yeah it moves quick
Try and fit my shoes kid, rumours never true shit
Jesus had his haters, haters let me know I made it
Crazy crazy I invade it, maybe ABK be blazing
Blazing up a dream batch, me I got the weed dacked
Trying to be a man about it, shit I gotta fiend cash
I ain't used to it, thats probably why I spend it quick
Rappin' is my life I put that shit on everything
I look you in the eye if you admit that this is mine
They like to backstab like a shiv hitting my spine
I just pull it out, sharpen it and throw it back
Bullseye, hit the marker, got a flow thats fat
You could stop the beat I need to know its sinking in
My life is crazy god reminds me that I wished for this

[Hook][Chorus]
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life, go away with you
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life, run away with you
Forever in my...

[Verse 1]
They all the same they just lame with their bullshit
It's kinda sad cause you trust 'em but they drool shit
Enough to make me wanna fucking turn my mic off
And go back to being poor at 16 and never write songs
Cause back then I ain't have all these eyes judging
I was hanging on the street, getting searched for nothing
And they spin out cause I'm on a track like "Fuck 'em"
Like I will forget my past and what they did? Nah ain't like none of 'em
Fuck the 5-0, I'm lighting hydro
You can tell me about the bisso but what I know
Cause on the street there ain't none of this industry
Until I brang it to the industry like this is me
Respect me for that, it's all I really ask for
And we be getting raided by a fucking task force
For years now they went and locked my mates up
My money clean but they still won't go away fuck!

[Chorus]
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life, go away with you
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life, run away with you
Forever in my...

[Verse 2]
Nothing changed but my attitude man
Make cash when I had a new plan
Kids looking up to me, what the fuck am I meant to say?
Its not as hard as it was for me
They shut the door but I kicked it in, I come for more
They knock you down you won't get help
Rise to the top tell 'em fuck yourself
Cause they gonna hate you when you poor as shit
They look, they laugh, ignore your shit
And you gonna feel down you'll wanna quit
But you gotta fucking fight if you want the shit
And you're at the top its not as sick as you pictured it what's wrong with This
Why people turn my mates have changed
Why you thinking shit would stay the same
Stupid man I'm trying to guide the next Kerser
But Imma tryna hide from all the shit that comes with rap
Back on the street with a baggy dacked
Cause the fame ain't sunk in yet (the fame ain't sunk in yet)
In a brand new car I think the fame has fucked my head
But gotta keep control and run this shit
100k another 100 flip
Ever doubt me you can suck my dick
I ain't even know what a budget is
Fuck the scene, have your hip-hop
Skitsing out you got me pissed off
Ain't no love my heart is switched off
Got my back well fuck I guess not

[Chorus]
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life, go away with you
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life, run away with you
Forever in my...How we fucking got here yeah they see it as a miracle
They tried to stop the movement
But my hands stayed on the steering wheel
I’m too strong and the message that my raps sing
Can stop your mate from suicide
And hold your world from collpasing
Good mates can turn against you on the fucking streets
Specially once you get shine for rhyming over fucking beats
Most the scenes are just fake others are a bunch of geeks
Controlled by what their told to do
On strings like they some puppet shit

Then you come to me you found a breathe of fresh air
In a fresh pair bunch of haters tryna get square
They can get got probably gonna get shot
If they make it personal and say they gonna get Scott
Got stabbed for acting hard over a blood size
From then in life I realized there’s no point in being up tight
We was young then think we just hit puberty
If you think I’m dumb you blaming me I blame the truancy
So what a true emcee talking bout the rainbows
How they writing really dope they softer then some play dough

That’s why I watch you rap till my crew is a laughing stock
You think this shit is fake I fucking beg your pardon gronk
What happenede to the love I guess is slowly changed to hate
While i made it out the rut now, it’s time to grab my mates
Will we live to see a better day I suppose you never know
My worst mistake was letting people know that I be getting dough
I just had to brag cause I fucking proved them wrong
You feel the goose bumps rising you ain't never heard a truer song
You want a piece of pudding but i sat in the cake
You see real when you look at me like the stats on my face
And then everyones sketching over metal detectors
Got em dacked its my show so they let em in get ya

Back to the facts that we living it raw
Middle fingers to the haters this the beggining of more
More raps more shows more tracks more dough
More cash more flows more has more smoke
I’m sticking to the music you just me do my thing
If its win or loose you fucking had to knew I win
Now I’m moving in to grounds I said id never touch
They ask me how to make I just say its effort bruhz
There’s something real about me seperates me from the others
Half our shows on stage I swear to god we spot the under covers
I throw my finger up then pump unwritten letter
Kinda crazy every song that I be getting better
The new albums coming so so phat
Picture that shit if this was just a promo track its kerse one[Intro]
Punch your breakky bongs for this (Haha)
Way to start it, good morning!
Look and uhm...

[Kerser]
All of them the same, their lame we what you look for
Crawling in my veins cocaine has got me cooked more

[Rates]
My brain gets you amazed I'm writing till my books worn
Watch me break this gate, crack the safe in the hood floor

[Kerser]
Definitely expecting me, like to be the death of me
Writing leaving legacies, the history its left to me

[Rates]
Now when you see the melody is getting severed heavily
This the sort of shit that have you jetting to your remedy

[Kerser]
So jet, jet it off, you won't move cause your soft
And my crew at the top, who are you? Your a flop

[Rates]
So keep it moving along, and its true cause the songs
That we're doing have a flame and I prove that its strong

[Kerser]
Light a flame and quick I came to kick the industry it makes me sick
You listening to crazy shit, admit that this is greatness bitch

[Rates]
Now wait a minute hit it with the style made to make them think
Place this shit and take it to a level, watch us make the mix

[Kerser]
Dangerous, famous, life is what you make it
And I've turned life into something thats amazing
I'm living my dream, you sit and you scheme
Thinking how the fuck the movement its ridiculous bleed to death
Yes, fuck a death threat, deadset, not dead yet
Im taking out the next threat
Theres no threat, so get slept

[Rates]
Deadset they're dead wrong, decapitated head gone
Dead gone and rotten in the ashes of their dead songs
Seen enough and been around, you beefing, gonna hit the ground
Your competing with some brothers positive and leaving proud
Why these other rappers whinging like they fucking gave us help
Jealous cause they know we got it, just the cards that they were dealt

[Kerser]
And I see through a poker face so go escape your bullshit
Just come and talk it over mate I know you hate the cool kids
Too fresh, too swag, crew rep, move back
I shack her/ur till she troublesome like 2Pac (Get it?)

[Rates]
So move back with your new track and throw it out
Were all yes yes, and you? They dont know about
They say you go around and stick your fucking nose around
And flow to promotors at shows but no ones going out

[Kerser]
Cut grass, pour it up, cuff us, ignore the cunts
Court has got my mates doing stretches like they warming up
So free 'em all, and let my crew represent
Movin' to get, all the loot and respect, till the death

[Rates]
This rapping gets me fuelled up, next second kill stuff
Living for a thrill I open minds just like a pill does
Heaps of beats that we destroy, this the key to free the boys
History we make in raps, not fake and you just heaps of toys

[Kerser]
Heaps of toys, and they thinkin that their rap is real
They're so toy, boy, put them in a happy meal
We blood brothers and (?) all day
You can't touch us, you dumb fuck, just walk away
So what you think bro?
Off tap like the sink broke
What they gonna do, when they witnessing the king flow

[Rates]
So what they thinking bro, these faggots lack a rhythmic flow
Rappin but were packing .45's so fucking let em go

[Kerser]
Trained to kill, 80 pills, popped in Mercedes still
Watch how the haters feel, not for the lame its real
Crazy gifted with the 80s blade inflicted on your ladies face
Your misses we the AB wait they get it

[Rates]
Wait, wait, they get it your with there ain't a substitute
The best, what you reckon, you got something that you love to do
Spent a lot of time to get here, yeah man it took quite a while
Doesn't happen overnight go get your rhyming style

[Kerser]
Your rhyme styles more weeks than a calendar

[Rates]
You gay rappers are just reeking of lavender

[Kerser]
They wanna battle, I won't compete with an amateur

[Rates]
Defeat, what you speak, have you fiending for stamina

[Kerser]
Sydney street rap, South West where the street at
Your saying that your street, but the streets hate your speak back

[Rates]
You need a street map, define where the streets at
We're where the streets at, and beats make the streets clap

[Kerser]
So talk your shit, cause you rappers are broke
Got punchlines like I'm swinging at a saddy of coke

[Rates]
Just know they're, packing a quote, with maximum dope
Stab your hag in the back of the throat till you collapse and ya choke (What!)

[Bridge: Kerser] x2
We got the feeling and the feeling is good
We never changed, thats the deal we keep it real with the hood
Kerser, Rates, NEBS is bass, you know it really is good
We got you laced off your face we know your fiending your hood

[Outro]

Your hood
Tell me that didn't start you day with a bang
Suns out, (good morning)
Its quarter past 7 you've already had like, 3 spliffs, (Theres no rest for the sickest)
Its one of them days
Kerser, Rates, NEBS, whatup!I've been around, I seen the streets, I seen a lot of shit
I seen my old enemies the cunts are on my dick
The world changed I ain't just better on mics
If we comparing me and you i'm just better at life
I got time for my friends, fam and my fucking fans man
Cutting both your arms off asking you to do a handstand
I'm the man damn blood spot I'm van dan in the dam bam pass you house it goes bam bam
Try me man I'm higher than the highest higher man i'm higher then the highest of the highest highest i'll stand
Understand I stacking notes with a rubber band
Is enough to turn the K-r-s to an ugly man
You ain't wanna meet me when i'm freaking, peaking tweaking about to sneak into your parents house a lesson i'mma teach em
You ask around you ask em now I ain't afraid you bitches
Kerser is the sickest Ker, Ker Kerser is the sickest
Who the man, I'm the man and they know this
If they say they didn't they just act like they ain't notice
Bro quick they on the edge of their seat
They can't handle when the Kerser comes to rep on the beat
I'm at the end of your street
Cause you pretending to be
A bad cunt cause you went and sold a tenna of weed?
At the center is me
I'm the e-lectricity what you need it when you have it
Maggot come try testing me
I'm the LMNOP
I'm the ABC to D
I'm the EF to the G
Scrap that
I'm A to Z
I'm everything you know and need the haters probably blowing
Me the freshest with the poetry the flow with beat you know its me
I'm the super cala fragalistic expialidoshus
You stupid faggots battle me you know I be the dopest
You mother fuckers go and talk about it be the closest
You'll never find the same until one day they try to clone this..   
 Yeah

[Verse 1]
Be the one to say it but they left it to me
Like ain't no one gonna speak up on the edge of your seat
And you wanna see me fail, see me fall, throw it all
But I spit so legit, under skin I make 'em crawl
Like I never knew right from wrong; fighting on
Headspace, they tell me keep on writing songs
I picked a vibe like a move wonder why it can move
Try to hide from the truth my eyes looking bruised
Cos I'm so smashed, triple what I wrote lad
Sitting 'round a bowl, big buds watching smoke grab anything in sight
I'm your medicine you died
Kerser only thing that make you ever feel alive
They look at me like "Man you at the top, there's no stress"
I'm just cheering that my boys are on there home stretch
Always stayed loyal you can check on that
I respect the fucking crew, they respect me back
Dissing's gonna have you all depressed and bashed
And I won't give you fame I won't mention that
Loyal cunts on my team they will delete you from the scene
Ain't gonna dwell further cause you know what I mean
Rates got these rappers fucking shittin' their pants
They should thank me I tell Rates to give 'em a chance
I tell the crew "Just chill" and I'm only being real
They don't like most you rappers, they wanna make your blood spill
That's competitive mix with how we grow up
That's why my attitude's never giving no fucks
Rappers actin' different when in front of the mics
Kinda like fucking haters when they starting to type
Repeat what you rapped about 'Now you got no beef'
They drop their nuts and cry and you thinking 'They so street'
Everyday thoughts I'm just airing them out
You made me arrogant, here you can stare at the ground
The 225 has split out left divers
Bitch out you find the sick sound I might just
Drop another album to restore your fate
Like I didn't pay my dues when you saw me wait
Waiting' 'round the same time as the highest man
It set something off like I had the tightest plan
Execute perfect, top charts I worked it, pop stars got murdered, drop bars like Kerser
I made a blueprint, the greediest shit that Kers does
I designed it, so it's only gonna work once
Laughing in your face now I'm one of a kind
You backstabbed me, get a real one in your spine
Attitude's troublesome, same as my brothers damn
Crawl into your mind and take our brain to another land
We out here, this is real as it gets
What you think we gonna fold if we dealing with threats?
FUCK THAT![Verse 1: Kerser]

I'm from the hood on man I block it out
Swear the worlds gone crazy I gotta shout
At the top of my voice but I feel alone
Stepping on a plane to go kill a show
They said I'd never do it but I'm doing it true
And the biggest risk take is I do it for you
Haters get mad cause they see me shine
No attention to you, this here is mine
I fear the life that'll come when this stops
Rockstar shit cocaine in ziplocks
Wish not make moves and rise
Didn't work first time and im doin it twice
Hot headed, carve on the sentence
Marvellous efforts, half of them left this
But im here and im standing tall
They can all get fucked im demandin more
Party time and your free to come
Bitch to guy ratio is 3 to 1
We can get down we can do it right?
My gift can make you fly
Lift up, we ain't here for long
Gotta do this shit before we gone
Once your gone shit you ain't never come back
We just want this life, but im way too smashed
And I may just crash and fall from high
But I made it back im forced to write
Whats on my mind, nothin else
Two in your face go fuck yourself
There it is I ain't leave it too soon
Do what you do but with who and you knew
It can't be done like I can do
I hit ya hard write life for you

[Hook] x2
Time to party
We ain't stoppin till the sun is rising
Options never running hiding
Them problems equals rums and lines
And anything that you gonn' do
I promise we gonn' do it better
Only live this life out once
And we gonn' make it last forever

Make your mind up kerser gotta go
Another day we on the road
Never meant to ride through life
On a 9 to 5 need brighter lights
And I made that clear, I made them hear
Then I made them cheer
Came back with a name thats raised packs
No that means at the scene just laid back
Took it all and im takin more
Im the one that takes you to that place for sure
We can leave now are you ready or not
Gotta go before the energy stops
And when it does then whose to blame
Left or right you can choose your fate
I'mma leave ill be back in time
And I won't remember shit, yeah thats a lie

[Hook] x2
Time to party
We ain't stoppin till the sun is rising
Options never running hiding
Them problems equals rums and lines
And anything that you gonn' do
I promise we gonn' do it better
Only live this life out once
And we gonn' make it last forever[Intro]
*turntable scratching*
Let me explain something
Kerser *scratching*
Kerser *scratching*
Kerser is sick!

[Verse 1]
What it is, it's the man of the moment
And any other moment that they claimin' I own it
Kerser flavour, yeah I sprinkle on top
They hangin' like a junkie needs a hit, I'll sprinkle a lot
So good with rap, no lookin' back
Shit there beef gets wrapped like cooked kebabs
I'mma light this spliff, you can ride this dick
I get the flu, people hang around to try and get sick
It ain't likely kid, I was born with this
This is bad for your brain, there's your warning bitch
As I pour a mix and chop fourteen sticks
That's a half oz here like my family mix, ya dig?
If not, fuck off, you must stop
I'll take you to the top, fuckin' oath so you can jump off
No more games, shit you know me by now
And if ya haven't heard ya best to know I'm ownin' the town, bitch

[Hook x2]
Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I
Will never stop 'till they murder me, shit
You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick

[Verse 2]
I walked in, kicked the door like "hold up, nah wait wait"
"I used that last time, let me set it straight mate"
The sickest is back, ridiculous rap
Hold the fingers like that and hurt ya misses's flaps
They askin' 'bout me, where's he going, is he singed, no
You giving me a contract and you think I'm gonna sign, no
I did it myself, I wanna keep it that way
Pile up the ashcay and waste it on a mad day
The way I'm livin' man they pay me to bounce
While my fans sing my shit, they gotta say it out loud
You can find me at the club, rubber band around the notes
Who said I never made shit? I gotta jam it down their throats
Certainly the sickest, got me hurtin' all you bitches
Then they turn on me for instance cause I'm burnin' all their lyrics
Hit me back, come and see me on my death bed
With a zombie bitch gettin' head, dead set

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
*scratching*
Come and cruise with me and you will see lad
I'm the man and that's why I don't listen to their feedback
Hear that, feedback, lyrics here, read that
You's all make me sick, gonna make me bring my feed back (vomiting)
Come close, you can witness a man, talk tough
Now you're here, you got shit in your pants
I'm the freshest motherfucker that you've seen for days
Now I'm paid, eshay, now the green is blazed
Dark red eyes, yeah that's normal for me
And the rest of the boys, ain't it awful to see?
Do you think we give a fuck, you know the answer to that
I'm so sick motherfucker yeah the cancer is rap
I live fast probably die young, celebrate my life cunts
Make sure when they bury me they puttin' in some nice buds
Rise up and fight for a better way
Always off my guts and I can not remember yesterday

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Now, Kerser, we gon' get high, fucking killed it again Nebs
You already know what it is, Kerser is sick
Sickest, Sickest (Kerser ain't no joke)
*scratching* (ain't gon' tell these motherfuckers again, man)
Kerser is sick! *scratching* (ain't gon' tell these motherfuckers again, man)
Kerser is sick! *scratching* (blast ya face and kick ya teeth in)
*scratching* (remember that) (I told you man! I told you!)
(K-K-K-K-Kerser is sick!) (No but you wouldn't listen)
(Why? You stupid fuck, look at you now)
*scratching*
