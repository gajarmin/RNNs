[Intro: Lea, (Lil' Flip)]

[Lea] Uhhhhhhh
[Lil' Flip] Yeeah
[Lea] Ohh, ohh, ohh, oh baby
[Lil' Flip] Lil' Flipper (Lil' Flipper)
[Lea] Ooh baby
[Lil' Flip] My girl Lea (my girl Lea) hit it

[Hook: Lea]
Sunshine
I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time (some time)
I can be your sunshine!
I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time (some time)
I can be your sunshine!

[Verse 1: Lil' Flip]
Look, I know you wanna chill wit a player
But all you got to do is keep it real wit a player
Just answer your phone whenever I call
Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball
I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile
I need a lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook cause a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

[Hook: Lea]

[Verse 2: Lil' Flip]
I know your friends wanna holla cause I got them dollars
Push the Maybach Monday, tuesday Impala
I switch whips like kicks I'm a balla (I'm a balla)
And if I get your phone number I'm a call ya (I'm a call ya)
And we can meet up the next day and chill
But I'm always on the road baby girl, that's how I live
I got bills to pay, I got moves to make
But when my plane touch down, pick me up at 8:00, don't be late

[Hook: Lea]

[Verse 3: Lea]
We don't have to be in love (love)
We can just be friends!
I will be right there, beginning to the end!
I can bring my girls (girls), you can bring your friends (friends)
We can both have fun, don't want this stuff to end!

[Verse 4: Lil' Flip]
They say love is pain and pain is love
I know ya Momma mad cause you talk to a thug
You think you know my type but you ain't got no clue
About - what a nigga like me do
I like to stack my bread and flip my chips
And I can change ya life if ya get wit Flip
I take private jets to Vegas, man
It's twenty bread each pick cause I'm major man
We can cruise the world in a Bently Azure
But don't worry, the chauffer open the door
You couldn't ask for more cause we got it all (we got it all)
Cause you my baby girl right?, right?

[Hook: Lea]

[Outro: Lea]
We don't have to be in love (love)
We don't have to be in love (love)[Hook]
Real thugs get down on the floor
Real girls get down on the floor
Like a pimp!

[Verse 1 - Lil Flip]
By the time I hit the door
I saw hoes on the floor
Niggas dressed in suits
Tricking all they dough
Me? I'm a pimp
I ain't paying for no sex
Man I'd rather buy a car
Or a new Rolex
Cause I got street fame
So hoes flock like birds
I got one ho in the range
And one ho in the burbs
When I hit the club
I'mma be with David Banner
A thug ass nigga
With bad table manners
We act bad; my nigga what is y'all saying?
Like when we walk inside clubs
Niggas hold they gal's hand
Cause they know we run trains (choo! choo!) all night
How could your gal leave me
And be with you all night?
But it's all right
Cause you know we don't kiss
Like Too Short said:
"Bitches ain't shit"
I tried to told ya
That most girls really freaks
And this is how they got to
Make their money every week

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - David Banner]
Step into club looking just like a pimp
We got cash, so we screaming out "shake something bitch!"
This is the song, tell the DJ put it on
Micheal Tyler made you shake
Sisqo made you show your thong
Bitch I'm dead wrong!
The playa from the crib
So get out on the floor
And girl, get it how you live
And since you so hot
Fuck it, show your pussy lips
You go to Tougaloo, but I know you still flip
Bitch, don't trip! Ain't a damn thing changed
I still love my queen
But bitches keep me to the game
So if you gotta ho, shake em up and let em go
And let them girls get down on the floor
Like a pimp!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lil Flip]
Now don't you hate them old
Lying ass hoes?
Smiling in your face
Wearing her best friend's clothes
I suppose they like the way me and Banner pimp
You can catch us at Pappadeaux
Eating steak and shrimp

[David Banner]
Or you can catch us at E&J's pouring it up
Flip whipping Cali trucks
Girls licking my nuts

And we ain't giving a fuck
Poke your girl up in the throat
And make her swallow the nut

[Lil' Flip]
We make em swallow the nut, so
Follow the truck: Lil Flip and David Banner
We got all of the bucks, and
All of they sluts and all of the hoes
So drop it like it's hot, girl
Touch your fucking toes

[David Banner]

[Verse 1 - Lil Flip]
Ah shit, y'all done fucked up

I'm just your average hood nigga
With dreams of gettin' rich (But you don't hear me)
My crib big like a football field
You might fuck around and think
I signed a football deal (But you don't hear me)
I take 15 minutes to drop a track (yeah)
I take half a minute to load my gats (But you don't hear me)
I make em bounce all across the globe
I'm a pimp, I got your ho
Takin' off her clothes (But you don't hear me)
A franchise like a Houston Rocket (Houston Rocket)
Every eight months is
When I usually drop it (But you don't hear me)
I got the streets on lock, I like my beats with knock
You know my heat stay cocked, niggaaaaa

[Hook]
(Now who they want?)
Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip
(game over) Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip

[Verse Two - Lil Flip]
Look, I'm a Cristal nigga and you a red-winer
You just an opening act
But I'm the headliner (But you don't hear me)
I'm about to ship 3 mil off top
You got your deal off your man
I got my deal off props (But you don't hear me)
I'm "Connected" like Dub and Mack 10
With Ice Cubes in my watch
And Dubs on the black Benz (But you don't hear me)
I'm getting paid cause I do all the work
It's rainy days if we don't move
All our work, we go berzerk (But you don't hear me)
I'm on the block fam, in the cream drop Lam
Most of y'all cats with deals, y'all ain't hot man (But you don't hear me)
I'm 'bout to do it again, you 'bout to lose it again
It's show and tell motherfucker, I'm a prove it again

[Hook]

The game over, cause shit about to change over
It's 'bout time cause hip-hop
Need a make over (But you don't hear me)
If most producers want to charge too much
But around my way that's how
You get fucked up (But you don't hear me)
You might think we all beats and rhymes
But way before this rap shit, nigga
The streets was mine (But you don't hear me)
I got that hot shit, that "Thug Life" 'Pac shit
That get hot shit, that B.I.G. "Ready to Die" shit

[Hook][Chamillionaire]
Yeah, it's the name they say is running the game
Chamillitary Mayne, yeah so go ahead and hand over the torch
Super producer Scott Storch, and of course...

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
I'mma show you how to get your shine on (get your shine on)
Turn it up, the DJ playing my song (my song)
Everybody keep on calling my phone (my phone)
Which one of y'all am I gone take home? (take home)
I'mma show 'em how to get the club crunk (get the club crunk)
Give 'em something that's gon' rattle their trunk (rattle that trunk)
Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk (get drunk)
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up

[Chamillionaire]
Give me that million-dollar beat and let me show you what to do with it
Who that is? That's the illest rapper chopped and screwed on it
Couldn't snatch the game that's what they told me so I'm provin it
Put the truth in Texas with Scott Storch and you got you a hit
Hit and never miss, rep your click and throw 'em high
Because Chamillionaire's the answer to the game like Allen I
Middle fingers to the sky if they don't like that reply
Cause any DJ that deny is a motherfucking liar
So give the ladies what that want, got 'em racing to the front
Of the stage to feel the bass and tell the DJ turn it up (turn it up)
Yeah, Sound of Revenge, send Universal to get my plaques
Rap is dead so I'mma bring it back like DJ's do when they hear my tracks
Check out my track record, they'll say I'mma track wrecker
Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigga (he's back!)
You can't get mad if you feel that shoe and cap fit ya
Drop the biggest stats ever so don't let that blat hit ya

[Hook: Chamillionaire]

[Lil' Flip]
Ay, ay, when it's time to hit the club I let my chain hang
If they got clovers on they neck we in the same gang
I'm twenty deep in V.I.P. puffing Mary Jane
Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain
I got homies on the West who like to gangbang
And I got homies on the East who do the same thang
I told Johnny put fifty in my pinky rang
Five karat diamond chain, VVS is in it mayne
You know I rep the Dirty Dirty where they move 'caine
You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank
Hypnotic, big bodies with blue paint
We got Big Oomp Spray, but it still stank
You a lame so your dame playing mind games
I'm a pimp so I stay in that mind frame
Niggas talk shit until I let the nine bang
Me and Duke in that Maybach switching lanes

[Hook: Chamillionaire]

[Chamillionaire]
I'm headed to the bar (I'm headed to the bar)
You know I'm V.I.P. (you know I'm V.I.P.)
And since you rolling with a star (your rolling with a star)
Your V.I.P. with me (Chamillitary)

Chamillitary the biggest threat to any of these rappers that think they doing it
Who that is? That's them boys from Texas that always do it big
Multi-colored diamonds got us shining, they say our jewellery sick
Houston got a problem and you don't want nothing to do with it
Do you kid? I ain't think, I'm tipping slow
When my trunk is lifting up look at the neons as they glow
Groupies never giving up, they be everywhere I go
When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo' sho'
Told me that she didn't care about my money, wasn't hearing it
Looks can be deceiving as Chamillion paint appearances
You know how we do it at home of Screw and purple syrup is
She got turned out quicker than my power steering did

[Hook: Chamillionaire][DJ Paul]
This for all my players out there ridin'... spinners
I don't care where you at, the club parking lot
The express way, whatever
What I want you to do right now is just STOP
And let em' keep spinnin' man

[Hook 2X]
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners
They don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners
They don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners
They don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners
I'm rolin'

[DJ Paul]
Pedal to the metal then STOP, [*Brakes*]
Take another sip from the syrup then STOP [*Brakes*]
Let my seat back, drop the top then STOP [*Brakes*]
See me something sexy, spot that ass I gotta STOP [*Brakes*]
My rims so shiny they clear like flat-screen plasma
Gals break when they see em' it's hard to breathe like they got asthma
Older people trippin' cause they think they seein' thangs
My car sittin' still but my rims still rolin' man, they off the chain

[Juicy J]
Everybody let ya spinwheels spin like a spinmill
Juicy J on certain pills, cruisin' down to Knoxville
See them thangs shinin' sparkin' like a diamond
Bumpin' the Alpi-ne, why you's a lyin'
Eyes like a Chinese, I'm drinkin' on the Heiny
I'm ridin' on the strip, any party you can find me
You rollin' with the finest, the North Memphis highness
You ball till ya fall, till a player aged ninety

[Hook 2X]

[Lil' Flip]
I got twenty inch spinners on my drop [*Brakes*]
Nothin' but white and yellow rocks in my watch [*Brakes*]
I'm doin' one-fifty so I'm watchin' for the cops [*Brakes*]
Since I'm in the Lamborghini I ain't gon' stop [*Brakes*]
I'm packin' a Glock believe it or not I'm ready to bust
And down here we drink purple (And we drink that Tuss)
So grab a cup Juice so I can pour ir up
And if you represent yo hood, go on throw it up
It's the L-I-L F-L-I-P
If I ain't smokin' trees, I'm pokin' freaks
So throw the row of keys and let me roll
Cause this the way we ball, I'm just lettin' you know
We like our music slow but our cars go faster
I'm in the V-12 with my cousin Big Shasta
I'm Lil' Flipper and I'm a top ten seller
Everybody slowin' down cause my drop is yellow

[Hook 2X]

[Lord Infamous]
I saw my dog with the center circles so I [*Brakes*]
They spinnin' like a saw so don't touch em' when I [*Brakes*]
I saw a shanky broad that owe me money so I [*Brakes*]
See me choke the hell up out my broad when I [*Brakes*]
When ya stand by the blades you can feel a slight breeze
Stop by House of Dubs just to keep em' on clean
Fell up in the Peabody, the most expensive suite
Them thangs still spinnin' when I filled out the receipt

[Crunchy Black]
I used to be clean in my Expedition
A girl see me and she'll be wishin'
That I'd stop and spit some pimpin'
It's mackin' in me baby, I just thought I would mention
She got hot like in the kitchen
You see my kin folks, cars, and glisten
Ain't nothin' like Sprewells cause they spinnin'
It's CB baby I'm just in it to win it

[Hook 2X][Intro: Lil' Keke]
Big terrible Texas
It's where legends are born
I'm Lil' Keke The Don
Original Screwed Up Click
It's a dedication to DJ Screw
Fat Pat, Big Mello, Big Steve
Feel it?

[Hook: Lil Keke]
Draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking about (x4)

[Verse 1: Lil' Keke]
I'm draped up and dripped out, the truth has just slipped out
84's, red doors, candy apple flip-flop
Got them boppers dripped out cause my drop tip top
Purple cup, screw us up, that's what keep the streets hot
Don P, Bun B, please free Pimp C
Hydro, Super Flow, know these boys feeling me
Come to Houston, Texas and see swangaz and 'lacs
And don't forget to tell the people that the legends are back
Yeah

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
It's Slim Thug showing H-Town love
Used to hit the club on dubs, acting bad on scrubs
Mad spokes and leather, 24's or better
Boys say they riding candy but my load is wetter
The roads for competitors when they see the two letters
They'll never ever ever ever ever get on my level
Me and Bun together caked up with clout
Staying draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking about?

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
The city is back, just look at the map
Thought we wouldn't get in the game
I'm sticking my dick up in the game and bustin' in that like a train
I'm hitting that mayne
Look at this grain I'm grippin', I'm fixing to swang
My bumper doing the body rock and my trunk is doing the crane
Now who in the hell was able to tell the world it wasn't my bang
I turn up the beat and I'm cracking the street
The city we started to train
The world is looking like Texas mayne
Just watch how they pick up the slang
Just show 'em your grill
And pick up some drank and watch how they do the same
Hold up mayne

[Verse 4: Paul Wall]
What it do baby? It's Paul Wall
Players rise while haters fall
Got fo's crawling in the 54
On the service road, I'm obeying the laws
I stay shining like headlights
And I stay crawling like head lice
Just like a boy but I play the dice
Them twos and threes ain't nuttin' nice
Them threes and fours I'mma roll fo' sho
Fo's and vogues, we call 'em swang
My partner Bun B bring the pain
Wanna know what I rep? Just check the chain
In the hood is where I hang, on South Lee, that 5-9
He dippin' oil, he drippin' candy
From P-A to H-Town, it goes down

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mike Jones]
Ice Age, Mike Jones
I stay draped up, dripped out, drop the top when I'm flipping out
Candy low on 84 (how you know they fo's?) They poking out
Ice Age and Rap-A-Lot, pimping hoes in the parking lot
Diamonds shining in my grill, you can see 'em if its dark or not
When I'm out in the limelight
I make sure I shine bright
I'm in the drop with the Glock cocked
You know I keep that iron tight
I'm getting brain from a tight dame
On North Maine in the turning lane
I'm young and rich talking a lot of shit
I guess its because I'm having thangs

[Verse 6: Aztek]
I'm still draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking bout
Fighting over parking spots, bustin' in the parking lot
Tu sabes, vatos, ves no fakos, parse
Te mato sin ningun contrato vamos
Now put your blocks up, now put your sets up
Fuck that nigga over there cause I think he said something
Have to take 'em with a clip out with the click out
Don't give a shit bout
'Till he gets out, free Pimp C, we draped up and dripped out

[Verse 7: Lil' Flip]
I told Bun when you need a verse, just holla
You know how we do it, you ain't gotta spend no dollars
I'm puffin dro, bangin' screw, and riding fo's
Middle fingers in the air, you know how it goes
Stash spot with weight in it, Candy paint with flakes in it
Trunk got the bass in it, One liter with eights in it
Swisha sweet with haze in it, you know I'm blowed
Four row diamond chain, you know I'm pro
Johnny got me right huh? 80 carats, bright huh?
Hit the button, pop the trunk, watch the neon light jump
I'mma keep folding bread 'till Pimp hold his head
We miss you DJ Screw, man I hate you dead

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
Down to ride red but I'mma ride blue
In the turning lane looking just like Screw
300 Crissy, don't think they doors
Everybody know Z-Ro's flow is ferocious
I keep a Robert Davis in the deck
Might be deep 22 drank in the whip
You can keep the sherm but you can pass the cup
My Cadillac rolling on glass and wood
Would I knock a jacka down when his ass get up?
Hell naw, this is playa from the chest to the nut
Screw was here he said I would come up
Now the radio requesting my stuff
Gotta keep a Smith-n-Wesson in buss
Cause the better life keep me stressing enough
Is this rap for real, is it a blessing or what?
Screw I hope I see you when they wet me up

[Verse 9: Bun B]
This is H-Town, Texas, tell me how does it look?
Taking over the rap kitchen and we ready to cook
You can hear us whipping the beakers coming out of the speakers
Chef-ing up some fresh hard for you out of town geekers
We got 3rd Ward, 4th Ward, and Southside G's
Plus Southwest and Bloody Nickels rollin' 83's
It's Houston, Texas motherfucker, you know the name
We'll see you in February for the All-Star Game

[Hook](187, 187, 187)
(Who's next?)

[Intro - Chopped and Screwed Voice - talking behind Hook] - w/ ad libs
Screwed Up Click
You know what this means, right?
Clover G! Let's go
Yeah, I'm too real to be an actor
Ya dig?
You know who you are
You be home, you behind the mic
Not me though

[Hook]
"Nigga's a threat, too real to be an actor" - 8X

[Verse 1 - Lil' Flip]
This ain't a movie, this more like a screenplay
Cause on the real I went to the block each day (for real)
The G way, so hit me on my three way
Look if you want to live, you better take it easy
You jump, fly with me, I clip your wings off
You violate me again, I infa beam y'all
This H-Town, the home of the trunk poppers
Oh and I'm on that kush nigga, I'm a funk doctor
I make hits in the streets and in the booth
So keep playin I'll put one on you (YOU)
I'm tatted up, cause I love takin pain
I give my artist's a cheat and tell 'em "keep the change"
I ain't petty player, I buy the whole thang
My work pure since you want to talk blow man
I got that shit that made Len Bias overdose
Yours truly, the King of the Third Coast

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
Yo, it's Koopa baby, uh
Jackers pay attention and don't get the script confused
Cause I promise Black & Decker ain't gon' miss you with the tools
Better duck before you lose, like McDuck or Mr. Scrooge
I ain't givin away a golden cent or nothin to you fools
Clownin on the camera, tryin to get you on the news
Sometimes the cloest ones, the ones who tryin to see you lose
They say that family matters, tell Urkel that I'm the truth
Because I'm a be a Family Guy until Stewie gets it misconstrued
Scratchin off the serial, materials get thrown away
For jackers, I got that serial, I'm pouring out the Special K
Don't get blown away, plot and you will bowl away
From no one just with a Cheerio size hole to stay
Homie it ain't no debate, some Pirelli's known to hate
So I had to motivate a set of O's to hold my swangs
Tippin on my rollerblades, head to toe way on them thangs
Tickets just get thrown away like I was supposed to pay

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lil' Flip]
Look, aye it's way too late to try to make peace
Just be glad they didn't find your ass on the streets
First they said H-Town wasn't gonna blow
But we proved 'em wrong, even Bun B went gold
I'm Michael Phelps, the way I swim up in your wife
Look I'm the reason her juice box ain't tight
(Who the King of Houston?), y'all better say me
Cause Def Jam Vendetta is the only way you'll play me

[Verse 4 - Chamillionaire]
NBA Live 2006, only way that they'll play me
I was born to be a boss and you just a trainee
In money that we trust, so you can trust in me
Cause I am money, you should see how much I clutched this week
They say that money talks, so you can trust this speech
It's Barack O'Balla baby, let's do lunch, let's feast
Landlord of the H, let's discuss this lease
If you in Texas and you leanin, then adjust your seat, for Pimp C

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Lil' Flip - talking]
Hey, we too real man
For real, yeah
Too real to be an actor, man
(187, 187, who's next?) 187, who's next?
Hahaha
Hey Cham man
It feel good to be amongst the platinum elite club baby
Hey let 'em know
The grind don't stop, Flipgates, Chamillionaire
It's Volume 4, right?
Hey Cham man, let these niggas know man
I'm fuckin with these beats now
682-561-8900(Ronnie Spencer)
La-da-da-da-da-da-da, oh-ooooh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da, I know you so real
You so real, Screw you yeah

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer]
Screw is so real, it's hard to stay strong
Cause one day you here, then the next day you gone
Living in the dark, now Screw is in the light
Trying to focus our life, everyday and night

[Lil' Flip]
I represent H-Town, down for my block
I started off the game, with the Botany Big Shots
Did diamonds in your face, got a lot of game
Start fucking with Screw, now I got underground fame
Fucked with E.S.G., and I had to buy the house
Did a lot of shows, represented for the South
Made a little group, called H.S.E
Dropped a tape, and we sold bout 23
Thousand fucking units, now we doing better
Dropped The Leprechaun, and I got a lot of cheddar
Sold a hundred thousand, made about a million
Now I got a Jag, with DVD's in the ceiling
Just got a deal, with Scarface
Now everybody hating, but they smiling in my face
They call me Lil' Flip, I'mma stay true
Got a mic with a crown, say R.I.P. Screw

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
I wish, I wish, I wish
I didn't have to write to this, recite to this
Blow a square flight to this, but Screw you missed
All I can do is sit back, and reminisce
It was all good times, at the crib spitting rhymes
Put it on our mind, that we were destined to shine
From scratching on turn tables, to running a record label
Mixing 2Pac and Biggie, with some Kane & Abel
We formed a click, that couldn't be fucked with
You ran the Hardest Pit, with the Dead End Click
It was E.S.G., Lil Keke, Big Pokey, G-R-A-C-E
Your Boy Al-D, P-A-T
C-Note and Willean, and them boys from Botany
You brought in Big Moe, my nigga Z-Ro
Mike D and Clay-Do, Lil' Flip and Lil' O
Them boys from the Fo', them boys from the Tre
And last but not least, there was H-A-W-K
I having nothing else to say, but you were so real
And that's the way you make me feel

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]

[Grace]
Screw was my DJ, and that boy was so real
Introduced me to the mic, put me on dubs showing skills
Went from block bleeder, pimping pens staying paid
Baptized in the click, writing rhymes living leid
Had to pay my dues, wreck 25 screws
Put it down with the best, label me one of the trues
V.T. from S.U.C., and I still stand tall
G-R-A-C-E, gon represent it till I fall
Still do it with the click, staying thoed in the mix
Got it by my DJ, fa sho to turning crumbs to bricks
Escape from the dark, now let the light shine through
Although he up above, the Don still come through
Push my pen keep it real, esperbertion sharpened skills
Motivation, determination to get that house on the hill
Ever since the day we met, with me and Los kept it rue
So for that until we gone, stay acting bad jamming Screw

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]

Lil' Flip
Represent
7-1-3

Now when you see me in the Lamborghini speeding, bumpin Screw
I know you see my license plate, "Lil' Flip #2"
I use to skip summer school, hit the block and move work
That was enough to buy some shoes, pants, and a new shirt
Now I'm shinin like Puff, wearin diamonds like Puff
We got everybody else music sounding like US
So hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been bumpin Screw down here for a while!
And when you see me at the mall, Just me and my dawg
I'm shoppin with them, Cause I ain't trickin for a broad
I do shows and rock crowds, And then I get paid
Summer time, I'm on dubs, Winter time, I'm on blades
My whole click livin laid, man we all got Vets
My crib so big, I ain't even see my room yet
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been buyin six-figure homes for a while!
Now when you see me in the Vibe, Murder Dog and The Source
And the XXL, standing next to a Porsche
I get paid with my voice, so I pimp these beats
I hate commercial rap, so I pimp these streets
You don't work you don't eat, that's a known fact
I just don't rap, nigga I know how to act
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been fuckin with magazines for a while!

[Chourus x1]
Because we represent the 7-1-3!
The type of Rappers y'all never goin be!
We makin money y'all never goin see!
Because we represent the 7-1-3!
Houston, Texas nigga!

Now when you see me with Tigga, On BET
Or 106 and Park, with AJ and Free
Or MTV, come take a look at my house
And after that, come take a look at my mouth
Yea I represent the South, like Pastor Troy
And I'm still Fresh and Clean, like Andre and Big Boi
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been talkin shit on TV for a while!
Now when you see me with a sweet, blowing smoke out my nose
9 times outta 10, I'm probably blowin Hydro
So don't blow my high, just leave me alone!
Cause I get high like Cheech and Chong
Call me 'Afroman' when my hair ain't braided
I got 20 tatoo's but I'm still educated
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been smokin high-time weed for a while!
And when you see my at the club, I gotta get my floss on
Techno, my ring shinnin, and I got my cross on
I gotta brand new phone, Cause I'mma rich nigga
And when people call, you can see they picture
I'm still Lil'Flipper, but my money got taller
And my Benz got wider, and your hundred got smaller
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been acting bad, drivin cars for a while!
When you see me Big Pimpin, like UGK
I'm choppin on blades, candy-paint, Jog Grey
I'm sittin on Twenty's, but I'm twenty-one
I'm ridin with an AK, you still got a B-B Gun
So you need to Back, Back, and gimme 50 feet
Cause you ain't sellin records like Sucka-Free
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been ridin around with straps for a while!

[Chourus x2]
Because we represent the 7-1-3!
The type of Rappers y'all never goin be!
We makin money y'all never goin see!
Because we represent the 7-1-3!

[Hook - 2x]
Balling is a habit, if I want it I grab it
A new whip I slab it, I just can't stand factory
I got split personalities, dumb play shit don't matter to me
The baddest bitches are after me, but place take over is my strategy

[50/50 Twin]
Ranger Rover, 4.6
Never sober,door don't stick
When the wedding is over, hide your chick
My hoes overflow, like sto's that got wick
Twisting fast, 22 inch glass
Screen in the dash, when you see me pass
Only get one chance, I never look back
Everybody in the car, be likeooohhhwhat's that
Louis Vatone,pardon me son
What time, will my car be done
Don't bother me none, need to squab a gun
One phone call, and the mob will come
Body guard is the Rock, get shot with the people's Glock
I'ma ball like Hardaway, catch a flat get a car away

[Hook - 2x]
You know, that balling is a habit
And I know, that balling is a habit
And you know, that balling is a habit
And I know, that balling is a habit

[Lil' Mario]
Play stuck up is my strategy, the baddest bitches are after me
Got purple drank and dackory, guards see the boys in back of me
I ball terrific when I ride, candy blue sitting on buck hide
With a fo' piece screen falling out the sky, everytime you see Lil' Yo I'm
High
Weed and drank drank and weed, and a bad yellow bitch on top of me
Forever representer of the G.C.P., keep balling G's surrounding me
Balling hard state to state, Lil' Mario on a paper chase
Little nigga that can hold his weight, hit the boulevard and scrape the plates

[Lil' Flip]
I got a watch with thirty karats, it cost so much I barely wear it
I got a date with Hale Berry (nigga you lying, ain't she married)
Yeah but I'm still a pimp, I walk with a limp while I'm eating shrimp
I got my name on a candy blimp, I got a drop top six on chrome rims
I got cash like Baby and Slim, but I'm a juvenile with a lot of gems
And I'm still a baby gangsta, with a AK and a nine double M
I'm Lil' Flip and I'm living lavish, I got a lot of homeboys that live in Dallas
I got partnas in Kansas City, I got partnas that gangbang down in Cali
I got hoes that be tossing salad, I got hoes that steal out shopping malls
I got a ho to give me head, my niggas call her Lock Jaw
You know what, I sold a hundred thousand independent
That mean before I got a deal, I been had a million

[Hook]
You know, that balling is a habit
And I know, that balling is a habit
And you know, that balling is a habit
And I know, that balling is a habit[Intro Lil Flip]

You was a nobody, but now you famous now

You betta

[Hook]

[Lil' Flip Talkin']

Full Effeck is the muthafuckin' future
Cross them niggas, I shoot you nigga
Any nigga, who got a gun and a chain nigga
And that dough, that's a true d-boy
Can't be a dope boy without a gun and a chain
Make sure you got them extra clips nigga
But on the real nigga, don't hate on a nigga when you see me pull up on that Maserati
I'm done wit the muthafuckin' Maybach
Fuck that shit nigga, I'm on some drop top flashy "Flash Gordon" type shit
Biatch, BUSTACLIP![Pimp C]
Hold up (Hold Up), we jammin

[Hook]
I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)
Cause I'm comin down, playin surround and livin these ho's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin maids and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)
Deep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
I'm comin up (choppin on dubs and showin 'em love)
2000-Fizive and you are not fly enough (young bitch)
Uhhh Hold up young bitch-bitch I just don't wanna stop comin'up

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uhhh it's never too much the paper I make
These other pussy niggas ain't real them ho's fake
I'm Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch
I treat you good because you know I'm rich
I was in the ghetto-had nothin'
Sold alot of records and grabbed somethin
Now I'm goin through movies in L.A
Playin the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm tryna get my mothafuckin paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they record sound shitty
When I see you in the town I'm a hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up

[Hook]
I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)
Cause I'm comin down, playa surroundin-livin these ho's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin'blades and playin maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'-Comin Up

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is too valuable for me to play with life now
Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guilty just because now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can vividly remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin in wad's like blocks
Let's go half on a Yacht-I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I can't even hear you haters you've been muted by my paper chase

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Flip]
Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fifty-thousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now I'm smokin high dro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now I'm rockin clubs
After "Diamonds N Yo Face" I was coppin dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand
Rappers talk alot of shit but you ain't stoppin us
Look you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia (Huh)
Look you don't know shit about UGK
Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch I'm wearin
I'm the first cat in Houston with a black McLaren
Lil' Flipper tote pistols for them non believers
Cause down here we poppin trunks on Cadillacs and Regals (Oh boy)

[Hook]

[Pimp C]
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'

Clover G's don't take no shit we bake them bitches to come up
Keep runnin you lip my gun on my hip so don't run up
Creepin on a come up

Old cars with new wheels
Yellow rocks in blue steal
You know Lil Flip got skills
You know Lil Flip got mills
You can ask B.E.T how the fuck I live
They know Im rich as fuck
So nuck if you buck
Cause down in Houston Texas
We jammit screwed up
We riddin 84's and we also poppin trunk[Intro: DJ Paul]

You know we got to do one for all these niggas
Out here sideline hating, you know what I'm saying?
Don't get mad cause a nigga straight up
Out the paint shop or the car lot or what not
Feeling mean on the scene with a pocket full of green
You know what I'm saying? And any one of y'all hoes think
A nigga gonna give them something, I can't give you shit
But this dick in your motherfucking mouth and in your motherfucking hole
And you got to reach me something for that, ho'
Cause I ain't for free, bitch
Pay what you motherfucking weigh

[Verse 1: Crunchy Black]

I pull up clean in my black fucking truck
My rims still spinning so you know I'm cutting up
I'm riding down the street, bumping nothing but us
I spotted me a freak, she was about to catch a buzz
I asked her what's her name, baby, it could be love
But you know you boy don't fuck with nothing but sluts
The ones that make money and stack them bucks
A bank for that cap and a bank for that butt

[Verse 1 Continued: Juicy J]

Nigga, I'll tell your girl she can suck on this big ol' dick
And won't be fucked up 'bout it if she pay her rent to a pimp
And in the public's eyes she can be legit, be my bitch
Cause at the shake junt she got to work a trick, get the grip
And never no back talking cause I call her jack, backhand slap
She come up short with money, baby, then I snap with a strap
She gotta let these hoes know who the shit running this
And you just might have to throw some blows
Take a hit wit the fist

[Hook: Mr. Bigg and DJ Paul]x2

Don't you, don't you get mad when I swerve and I twist
Riding, riding down your block, I got my charm out the window
Don't you get mad when I swerve and I twist
I ain't bragging on myself but I deserve this, miss

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]

I'm swerving, I'm twisting from side to side
I got that iron right on my side
Them 20 inch vogues with the yellow stripes
A 'rillo rolled up with some of that light
The 360 turn on the fold down screens
Turn it all the way around and watch it from the front seat
The knock in the back, get the trunk on rattle
Them hoes flocking to my whip thick like cattle

[Verse 2 Continued: Lil Flip]

Hey, you better put that money in my hand
I was born to be a mack, not your motherfucking man
You mad cause I hit your ho, me and her split your dough
Why you acting surprised, I know you heard this shit before?
Me and Quint, pushing 'Vettes, smoking 'dro, no stress
One tech, two Glocks, infra red, no vests
I clock dollars and pop collars for a living
I'm at Pressure World every time I hit Memphis
[Hook: Mr. Bigg and DJ Paul]x2

Don't you, don't you get mad when I swerve and I twist
Riding, riding down your block, I got my charm out the window
Don't you get mad when I swerve and I twist
I ain't bragging on myself but I deserve this, miss[Intro: Lil' Keke]
Big terrible Texas
It's where legends are born
I'm Lil' Keke The Don
Original Screwed Up Click
It's a dedication to DJ Screw
Fat Pat, Big Mello, Big Steve
Feel it?

[Hook: Lil Keke]
Draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking about (x4)

[Verse 1: Lil' Keke]
I'm draped up and dripped out, the truth has just slipped out
84's, red doors, candy apple flip-flop
Got them boppers dripped out cause my drop tip top
Purple cup, screw us up, that's what keep the streets hot
Don P, Bun B, please free Pimp C
Hydro, Super Flow, know these boys feeling me
Come to Houston, Texas and see swangaz and 'lacs
And don't forget to tell the people that the legends are back
Yeah

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
It's Slim Thug showing H-Town love
Used to hit the club on dubs, acting bad on scrubs
Mad spokes and leather, 24's or better
Boys say they riding candy but my load is wetter
The roads for competitors when they see the two letters
They'll never ever ever ever ever get on my level
Me and Bun together caked up with clout
Staying draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking about?

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
The city is back, just look at the map
Thought we wouldn't get in the game
I'm sticking my dick up in the game and bustin' in that like a train
I'm hitting that mayne
Look at this grain I'm grippin', I'm fixing to swang
My bumper doing the body rock and my trunk is doing the crane
Now who in the hell was able to tell the world it wasn't my bang
I turn up the beat and I'm cracking the street
The city we started to train
The world is looking like Texas mayne
Just watch how they pick up the slang
Just show 'em your grill
And pick up some drank and watch how they do the same
Hold up mayne

[Verse 4: Paul Wall]
What it do baby? It's Paul Wall
Players rise while haters fall
Got fo's crawling in the 54
On the service road, I'm obeying the laws
I stay shining like headlights
And I stay crawling like head lice
Just like a boy but I play the dice
Them twos and threes ain't nuttin' nice
Them threes and fours I'mma roll fo' sho
Fo's and vogues, we call 'em swang
My partner Bun B bring the pain
Wanna know what I rep? Just check the chain
In the hood is where I hang, on South Lee, that 5-9
He dippin' oil, he drippin' candy
From P-A to H-Town, it goes down

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mike Jones]
Ice Age, Mike Jones
I stay draped up, dripped out, drop the top when I'm flipping out
Candy low on 84 (how you know they fo's?) They poking out
Ice Age and Rap-A-Lot, pimping hoes in the parking lot
Diamonds shining in my grill, you can see 'em if its dark or not
When I'm out in the limelight
I make sure I shine bright
I'm in the drop with the Glock cocked
You know I keep that iron tight
I'm getting brain from a tight dame
On North Maine in the turning lane
I'm young and rich talking a lot of shit
I guess its because I'm having thangs

[Verse 6: Aztek]
I'm still draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking bout
Fighting over parking spots, bustin' in the parking lot
Tu sabes, vatos, ves no fakos, parse
Te mato sin ningun contrato vamos
Now put your blocks up, now put your sets up
Fuck that nigga over there cause I think he said something
Have to take 'em with a clip out with the click out
Don't give a shit bout
'Till he gets out, free Pimp C, we draped up and dripped out

[Verse 7: Lil' Flip]
I told Bun when you need a verse, just holla
You know how we do it, you ain't gotta spend no dollars
I'm puffin dro, bangin' screw, and riding fo's
Middle fingers in the air, you know how it goes
Stash spot with weight in it, Candy paint with flakes in it
Trunk got the bass in it, One liter with eights in it
Swisha sweet with haze in it, you know I'm blowed
Four row diamond chain, you know I'm pro
Johnny got me right huh? 80 carats, bright huh?
Hit the button, pop the trunk, watch the neon light jump
I'mma keep folding bread 'till Pimp hold his head
We miss you DJ Screw, man I hate you dead

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
Down to ride red but I'mma ride blue
In the turning lane looking just like Screw
300 Crissy, don't think they doors
Everybody know Z-Ro's flow is ferocious
I keep a Robert Davis in the deck
Might be deep 22 drank in the whip
You can keep the sherm but you can pass the cup
My Cadillac rolling on glass and wood
Would I knock a jacka down when his ass get up?
Hell naw, this is playa from the chest to the nut
Screw was here he said I would come up
Now the radio requesting my stuff
Gotta keep a Smith-n-Wesson in buss
Cause the better life keep me stressing enough
Is this rap for real, is it a blessing or what?
Screw I hope I see you when they wet me up

[Verse 9: Bun B]
This is H-Town, Texas, tell me how does it look?
Taking over the rap kitchen and we ready to cook
You can hear us whipping the beakers coming out of the speakers
Chef-ing up some fresh hard for you out of town geekers
We got 3rd Ward, 4th Ward, and Southside G's
Plus Southwest and Bloody Nickels rollin' 83's
It's Houston, Texas motherfucker, you know the name
We'll see you in February for the All-Star Game

[Hook](Talking)
Yeah, Play & Skillz, just let it bang
Na'm sayin'? Hah-Hah, feelin' this one
Yeah I'm feelin' this one
We talkin' bout music
Pay attention listen up cuz I..

[Hook - Lil' Flip]
I Rock & Roll, this is how a Glock explode
My music is like crack, cuz I rock the shows
You got to know, that can't nobody stop my flow
My concerts like drugz, got fans got to go
(repeat)

I'm like crack, whenever I perform on a track
Cuz if you from outta town you about to get taxed
And that's that..I ain't changin' my price for nobody
You can keep them points cuz you ain't gon' sell four cotties
Cuz ya style to sloppy, ya beats ain't knockin'
And when you in public, them freaks ain't boppin'
My 6-4 hoppin' when I'm ridin' down the street
I still feel like I'm hustlin' (why?) cuz I'm raw with these beats
You could put me on a plane, or put me on a train
Cuz no matter where I perform, they understand my slang
They understand my pain and how I took over the game
From this day on, rap 'll never be the same

[Hook]
I Rock & Roll, this is how a Glock explode
My music is like crack, cuz I rock the shows
You got to know, that can't nobody stop my flow
My concerts like drugz, got fans got to go
(repeat)

I need 25 a show, I need 30 for a verse
(Them video's on BET) yeah I know how much I'm worth
(How much?)..I'm worth alot, cuz I really work alot
And since Will Lean my nigga, I gotta help him out
So I'mma put him out (so nigga kick ya feet up)
And when the stores sell-out (then it's time to re-up)
So keep yo D-up, cuz we comin' with the heat man
And if you get a deal make sure yo niggas eat man
And to my fans, I appreciate the love
So holla at ya boy when I'm at the club
Cuz I ain't Hollywood, I'm from the Hollyhood
The difference between me and them my music good

[Hook]
I Rock & Roll, this is how a Glock explode

[Verse 1]
The first day we met, I was in my vet
I just left Warner Brothers pickin' up my check (hahaaa)
I pulled up in Wing Stop just to get me a bike
Rubber cush on my blunt so I'm high as a kite
Red monkeys wit a crist twelve hundred to pop
And when you walk by I couldn't do nothin' but watch
Cause I know you wit a cat who ain't treatin' you right
And if you wanna be happy you should leave him right now
I got a ten o'clock flight on my G-5 girl
Let me upgrade you, no more Levi's girl
I'mma show you finer thangs you can cruise the world
And when we come back you gon' have bluest purse
Yessir

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I ain't a pimp no more, that was '99 (99)
Cause when it came to the bread I had to get mine
Top down when I'm roll up the Vegas Strip
Four pound on my hip in case a nigga trip
A hundred dollar chips, let's gamble ma (let's go)
And if the crowd get thick let's scramble ma (let's go)
No gal can cook shrimp better than ma (haha)
I had a gal ain't know what berretta or nine
After this, I'mma drop "Ahead of My Time"
The true thangs that I love is my bread and my dyme
They be like "Flip man you got a lazy flow"
That's when I say "oh wellll, I make crazy dough"
Chuchhh Chuchhh

[Hook] w/ Mya singing
You always say the things to make me staaaayyyyy

Good girls like thug niggas
Po' nigga, I dare any one of y'all to try me
Even when I take a shit that pistol right by me (which side?)

Screens in my whip, bigger than the ones that's in your living room (yeah)
Candy paint shined up, twenty cars lined up (ooohh-weeee)
And they all cost bra (how much?) triple your house dawg (haha)
Call me Flip or 'Flipperachi' call me anythin' but broke
All I need is V12 nigga I can cook coke (yeah)

I'm at the strip club, makin' hundreds rain cause

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 3]
Yo my Chevy ridin' high boy
Twelve hundred dollar shades on my eyes boy
Twelve thousand dollar blades on my ride boy
Four 18's got me soundin' like a quire boy, haha
I slow the car down and speed it up
Hey chump, I slowed your broad down and beat it up, haha
So don't be playin' wit a G shawty
Cause I can make you disappear for a G shawty
They always talk about the kid in the street shawty
The kid got more beef than the meat market, let me park it
Cause I don't trust valet wit my keys
Let's make a bet for 50 large, who flyer than me? nobody

[Hook](Lil' Flip)
I come from a hood where everybody standing on the corner
What you need? some weed, speed, or some marijuana?
You can get it right here or get it down there
But when the laws pull up get away from 'round there
Now niggas think a nigga started changin
Just cause a nigga gotta platinum chain hanging
I still got the same niggas that I'm down with
If a nigga owe me money we gon'shoot down shit
I use to sell work I use to sell pints
But now I'm doing shit I got three million in the bank
I done made alot of moves and payed alot of dues
And if you fuck with me, you might make tonight news
Now niggas get on TV and forget they partnas
The ones who keep it real come to yo shows with the choppas
The one who bring that drank, bring that weed to yo house
Them the niggas down wit me that represent the South, uh

(Chorus)
I want the money
I don't give a fuck about the fame
No matter how rich I get Lil' Flip will never change
I want the money
I don't give a fuck about the fame
I do this shit so my patnas don't have to slang cain

(Lil' Flip)
Now everytime I get back somebody went to jail
But they taught us don't go to school and you will fail
I didn't go to college but its money in my wallet
And I just bought a Jag with zero mileage
Now people like "Flip, you know I'm tryin to rap"
But you was hatin on me, nigga you might get slapped
Your telephone tapped, you got the hood hot
Matter of fact it don't look good for you to be standin on the block
Nigga what about the cops? They rollin and lookin
And everybody know what you sellin and cookin
So get yo mind right nigga stay out the streets
You see what I did, now I play with these beats

(Chorus)

(Lil' Flip)
I'm like a hundred-dollar bill I'm hard change
And now its funny everybody ain't acting the same
Rule one never let niggas learn your business
Rule two never ever ever burn yo bridges
I had niggas that was hatin smilin in my face
Way before "Buy the Car, Buy the House", and "DiamondsNyaface"
Now they see me in the streets like "I wanna do a song"
Nigga yous a ho cry babies go home!
Cause you ain't selling records don't get mad
Cause you see me ballin hard in a drop top Jag
When you see me at The Source just chunk up a deuce
Cause I represent Cloverland jumpin out my Coupe
I'm still gon' be the same nigga on the scene
I'm still gon' be the only freestyle king......

[Hook: Trick Daddy - 2x]
I'm doing this one for the thugs
And them boys down South, much love for the thugs yes sir
For the thugs, and them boys in the city
Much love for the thugs, yes sir

[Lil Flip]
From city to city, state to state
Me and my niggas on the road, trying to make this cake
Cause if you don't work, you don't eat
So right now I'm in the studio, bringing the heat
And I've been doing this rap thang, for a long time
I went from flipping them dimes, to kicking them rhymes
From one tat, to twenty five tats
I went from one sling shot, to twenty five gats
And all I want, is twenty five placks
And if you want a show, I need twenty five stacks
Fuck a dat, I got a playback machine
One mic one stage, and a ounce of green
And I'mma show you, how we do it down here
And if you ain't from round here, get the hell from down here
And just kick off your shoes, and relax your feet
It's Lil Flip, Trick Daddy and my boy Greg Street

[Hook: Trick Daddy - 2x]

[Lil Flip]
When I'm thugging like Pac, when I'm hugging my block
If you run to the cops, I'mma come with my Glock
If you play with my do', I'mma spray at your ho
So if the shit ever happen, don't act like you ain't know
Cause I got niggas on my team, that'll pop the steal
And make your body disappear, like David Copperfield
And I got family in Miami, that'll ride for me
I got some homies in Atlanta, that'll die for me
And I'm a pimp, so my hoes never lie to me
They get taped with my cane, and go fly for me
So bring daddy his cash, so I can re-up quick
Then supply my customers, when I flood the strip
Fuck a drought I got that work, like a booking agent
I got bricks in the attic, and pounds in the basement
And that's how we hustle, around my way
We living like Denzel, on Training Day, cause I'm a thug

[Hook: Trick Daddy - 4x]

[Lil Flip]
I'm doing this for Houston, Dallas, College Station
To all my young thugs, who still on probation
For my niggas locked up, with no parole
And to whoever bought my tape, cause my shit went gold
And we thugging, rolling on Dubs and
We valet, when we come to the club and
I stay strapped up, cause I got shot this year
And I'm about to go quadruple, like Pac this year
That's one million, two million, three million, fo'
And after that, I'mma put red in the do'
So just kick off your shoes, and relax your feet
And watch me put these hoes, on the ecstasy

Yeah nigga...[Yung-Ro]
When I come down, you might see me Chuck Taylors on feet
A new unit from the mile, with my nobody piece
On buck-highs when I ride, and slide so gently
Lookin' fly like the guy that I was meant to be
I put up in a Bentley, just like you think I wouldn't
Leather seats with extra cushion, I'm at eaze when I'm pushin'
I'm older, I'mma roller, flippin' chiefin' that dolja
Hit the gas, fuck the brakes, it ain't a scratch on my rover
I buy a sack and then roll up, just to get back in composure
I take this rappin' way more then, just makin' cash and exposion
Peep the stats on my quarter, I'm up to bat and I'm holdin'
My balls, and my word and I don't crack em' for no one
Matter fact I'm the chosen, what, flippin' my tongue
Asalakem-Asalum, Chamillionaire.com
I'm logged in in a fog benz, playin' with my lap-top
Screens drop, trunk pop, destination IHOP
So jump down with ya boy, if you feelin' that fluid
I stay high and act a fool, because I gots to do it, G'Yeah!
-UH.HUH, Yung-Ro, G'Yea-

[50/50 Lil' Twin]
-Man, 50/50
I'm still draped up and dripped down, screw tape jammin'
Trunk rumblin' and tremblin', Color Changin' and blendin'
Forest side mirrors blinkin', while I'm turnin' and tippin'
Hit my brakes at 9:00 at 10, them rims stop spinnin'
Channels set, rim grinnin', tatted up on my skin and
9 fiancee's, I ain't trippin', fuck a 3 some I'm ten-in
Program pimpin', lean sippin', hoes suckin' 5 lickin'
Invicible set, diamonds hittin', while the minute hand tickin'
I hold chickens, steerin' whippin', '72 is my mission
I can't front unless you spendin', pitch like Roger Clemens
I throw work, fiends hit it out the park like Dillon
Now they geekin' and flitchin', feelin' bad cuz they sinnin'
My twin got shot in his head and his leg now he limpin'
So don't make him swing that aggie, and may place he fix it
600 Horses in my engine, sittin' still fish finnin'
My grand-prix on non-stoppers, H2 3 on pippen's
If you wonderin' it's 50, turn me up just listen
I make grown-man decisions, so at life you can't miss me, what?
-Boy's gonna feel this Color Changin' Click mayne
-We tippin' down, popped up wide open

[Chamillionaire] (Yung-Ro)
-Fa'real, Yeah
Windows down cuz they tinted, so niggas can see me up in it
Wait for my spinners to stop spinnin', after 5 minutes re-spin it
Emblem on the hood, lookin' about the size of a grammy
Chrome Lady doin' the Statue Of Liberty pose on my candy
Used to be candy over silver, now it's wine berry over gold
Now it's Color Changin' on the doors, while I'm swangin' thinkin' 24's
No police out on Dalem, hollows we got em' no problem
Spot em' and push a wig back farther then Hatter did my album
I ain't got to promote it, nope no radio play
Pull out that K, right-away and ya drop-date 'll be today
I hope ya doin' killer crunches, ain't gotta vest when it lunges
Patch ya stomach, so (NOBODY!) ain't got to see what ya lunch is (Haha)
I don't like niggas grumpin', gossipin' in my circumference
And Sucka-Free is flippin' humped's we gettin' bills by the bunches
Hold up, plot on them thangs, belt-buckles and bang
He pull out that thang from behind the belt-buckle than bang
Hit ya face with that handle, make ya braces dismantle
Then they'll erase the Soprano's and put my face on that channel
Jumped down, fun lift the trunk let it dangle
Geometric rims spinnin' at a obtuse angle
Braud act like she don't see me, bet she get broke in
Throwin' gin down her chin, til' her dome spin like my chrome rims
Rap-game it was throw'd in, but I'm still gon' win
Hell yeah nigga, Koopa freestyle with no pen

[Lil' Flip]
I'm from the streets, I know yall niggas peep game
My nigga Note, just dropped his shit Street Fame
Will Lean comin' next, I'm bout to drop again
Yall niggas #1, but I'mma take ya spot again
I'm off the lot again, rollin' in a drop again
I'm sippin' sizzerp, you drinkin' on a Heineken
I got the cheddar now I'm on another level now
You wearin' white-rocks, it's yellow in my bezel now
I gotta bigger car, cuz I'mma bigger star
I'm fuckin' Dolly Pardon, she wear a bigger bra
You know where I'm from and you know what the fuck we be packin'
These niggas be hatin' I'm vested up in-case they jackin'
Bitches come and they go, Flip is runnin' the show
And if you don't know, now you muthafuckas know
I'm the hottest around, niggas know how I get down
When I come to your town, hook me up with a pound
And we gon' smoke a blunt, and I'm gon' rock the show
I know this yo baby-momma but I'mma fuck ya ho
Get the brain, get the change, peep the rangs, peep the rocks
You know where the fuck I'm from, I represent my block
Yall niggas braggin' and boastin', I'll leave you gaggin' and chokin'
Jump out the Jag and approachin'..Bitch Nigga!
