(Ol' switcheroo-ass, bitch made motherfuckers..)
Outlaw nigga, Westside, throw it up
Hahaha.. had love for 'em, but why you turnin on me?
Why me? Westside, how you do it boy?

[2Pac]
I went from, nothin' to somethin' now they all wanna see me fall
And the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ball
And they say we hate the East coast, but that's funny
Got a lot of love for, any niggas gettin' money
I made a song about my enemies and niggas tripped
It was hip-hop until 2Pac fucked Biggie bitch
Y'all niggas hypocrites and bitch made
Now either love me or hate me but real thug niggas get paid
Have me catchin' cases all across the nation
I went from jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facin' three strikes, and we might
Just blast God bless the child that can get cash
But all these niggas turnin' and never learn
Got a long line of niggas player hatin' me but gettin burned
Talk a lot of shit but youse a trick in drag
Like the Mack make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back stab

[Hook: singers + 2Pac]
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin on me?)
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggas see me you flee
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G

{*add to line seven of Chorus first time: "Yeah nigga!"*}

[2Pac]
It, started so innocent, but ended in the fifth precinct
Approach the juvenile delinquent, we still decent
Playin' catch and kiss, used to diss the herbs
Fuck school we was skippin' drink a fifth on the curb
Me and you, no closer two, while drinkin' brew
What you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?
I never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Said I got raped in jail, picture that? {*laughter*}
Revenge is a payback bitch, get your gat
Fuck {Wendy Williams} and I pray you choke
On the next dick down your throat, for turnin' on me

[Hook]

[2Pac]
I put Jenny Craig on your fat ass, you fat troll
Anybody ever seen {Wendy Williams} fat ass?
Why you always wearin Spandex you fat bitch?
I know your pussy stinks, you fat ho
I'm puttin Jenny Craig on you bitch
I'm about to put a twenty-thousand dollar, hit
Through Jenny Craig to come find yo' ass
And put you in a fat farm, you fat bitch!
Thug Life, Outlaw, Westside bitch
It's 2Pac so you know who said it
And for everybody who didn't like what I said about that other trick
And Mobb Deep, fuck you too nigga!
If a nigga didn't want to get talked about
He shouldn'ta stepped in the fuckin ring
If Tyson don't want to get knocked out
He don't step in the fuckin ring, that's how the shit go
When Tyson get in the ring, he knock motherfuckers out!
Well that's what 2Pac gon' do
When niggas come against me, I'mma knock they punk ass out!
One way or the motherfuckin other
This old motherfuckin nigga in the South told me nigga
It's more than one way to skin a cat
It's more than one way to shoot a gat
It's more than one way to die nigga
When I'm through, everybody cry nigga
This is how we do it

[Hook]

[2Pac]
Fuck you too nigga![Intro]
Music affects your brain
Whether people will admit it or not
And you don't have to be weak minded for it to do so

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
All I wanna do is, go harder and harder
Get smarter than Harvard, go hard with the Slaughter
To keep it one hundred, I think the industry
Wanna see a nigga like me depart as a martyr
Walking on water, the flow is immaculate
Reading off the Dead Sea Scrolls as I'm rapping it
The track I'm crashing it
Making it look like a Cadillac had a bad accident
Cuz y'all ain't passionate, catch a jab to your abdomen
Then I'mma tap your chin, I'm a boss, you an applicant
Y'all cats pretend (never ever ever rap again)
Crooked I kick it in the hood
Pistol to protect me cuz I'm figuring it could
Homie, Iâ€™m living like a genie in a lamp
Rub me wrong, I wish a nigga would
Killers ready to get dirty
Some niggas who dress nerdy who ain't even touch 30
They quiet and ain't wordy, their firing ain't sturdy
I've been a couple of light years from any nigga that wanna discern me
So callate puto, Breaking Bad and I'm Tuco
Got the Hublot hanging out the bulletproof coupe though
If you didn't, now you do know!

[Hook: Crooked I]
Yo, light that up, pour that up
Middle finger music, throw that up
Act like this cuz we don't give a fuck
(We don't give a fuck)
Cuz we don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Why should I, man, with my good eye
I can see all y'all snakes so I put my
Foot up your ass, kill em with success
Look how I pass em up, I'm like "Goodbye!"
Million dollar bitches get bucked in the face
If he ain't about money then your husband a waste
I'mma switch the scenery up to a bank
That's how a real nigga cut to the Chase
Pour a little vodka, load the Glock up
Then roll some bomb up that'll blow Sadam up
Pull up in the drop with Snow Tha Product
We don't give a fuck is our code of conduct

[Verse 3: Snow Tha Product]
I've been at the shit through past due rents
Man I've been broke, I've been homeless, shit packed in bins
I've been at this since back when tax bracket shit
Was way past any practical math I did
Now I'm halfway past half to a capitalist
Three-fourths day of the year i rap top of the list
Now I'm really getting my dividends and stackin' up big
Gotta go back to where I'm from to mentally handle this shit
Cuz I've been a nobody so long, gonna readjust
Get a North Hollywood home
Still close enough to deal with bullshit deals
But yet far enough to be where Latin folks roam
All originality with a capital O
So the game wanna see a bitch broke with no soul
So I grasp it tight because a chick like me know
That I would rob these bitches because old habits die slow
Look I never been a punk and I never been a bitch
So you bitches better run, we all know the benefits
Cuz your 15's done when my 16's hit
Heard games are for fun but this game's bullshit
Bitch, no I did not come this far to quit
This argument is not even real
Went from not having a pot to piss to coppin' whips
And stocks and casas in hills
All these new bitches talking but chill
Watch when they get out of pocket, I'll kill
Any of them, got plenty of friends, in any event
I'll finish em off, no question, no squeal
Yes I am tired of all you sluts
That been coming in the game cause you bought your butts
Now you wanna claim fame cuz some guy you fucked
Is giving you a hood pass, should've passed you up
But yup, of course you lie, sit there and organize
Try to be more than just hoes, umm
Thinking you sort of tight cause someone wrote your lines
Thinking you whores have got flow, no
You can record the lies, gimme some more so I
Finally listen and hear dough
Cuz I've been trying to hear competition for a god damn year
But don't hear shit but ripoffs and hoes
Get off the blow, get up and get y'all a show
I have been hitting the road, building my own
Little by little but no, I do it all on my own
Yes I got dough, I don't split shit but to roll
Bitch I can show y'all the ropes
All of you hoes that got cosigns, clothesline dry ass
Stale ass bitches need those, I don't!

[Hook: Crooked I]

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
In the underground they put me on the throne
In the mainstream they say I don't belong
Talk about a nigga only good for a freestyle
Fuck that, we can go song-for-song
Word, I'm killing the best of men
Get rid of they next of kin, get rid of the pestilence
I give em a testament, I'm rebuilding the West
And I'm pissing off in the coffin that you resting in
Skinny jeans and leggings, you're anything but legend
I really bring the weapons, the semi beam behead ya
The guillotine'll sever my killing team and catch all my enemies
I bet you the ten of these will break you apart, yeah
Leaking in a puddle, whole hospital staff meeting in a huddle
Trying to figure out how to put your body parts back together
Just like the pieces of a puzzle
And I'm gone in the wind, yeah, I'm gone in the wind
I was fucked up, broke, really
Resting my Achilles, I'm balling again
Never going broke, say fuck that shit (fuck that shit)
Yeah fuck that shit
She don't fuck with Snow, fuck that bitch (fuck that bitch)
Fuck that bitch
Like imagination during masturbation
Fuck what you think, what the fuck did you think?
The day your opinions can cut me a check
That'll be the day I give a fuck what you think
You weak minded![Bell Rings]

[Intro - Chopped and Screwed Voice -Talking]
Hey, now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up!
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit - get the fuck out!
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit - get the fuck out!
For those who love raw shit - welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is: Tech N9ne!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
This is style, I use pitch to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick, mellow tone is what you spit
Switchin' the pattern, bust out that quick Midwest chatterin'
Some people hate but it ain't matterin', but the people gather, it's flatterin'
Switchin' the pitch, mixin', there's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin' full clips on a mission for bliss when I be rippin' this shit
Make it exciting, got to be inviting when you're writing your piece
Never be dick riding, if you're going to be biting, you're igniting the beast
This is melodic, melodies if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales, you singin' off-key, it's garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, you need to stop it
Have confidence, speak with conviction
Don't put 'em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony, Nina's taking you through it
Make it buttery, utterly beautiful, make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin' motherfuckers in music, that's how we do it!

[Hook]
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat [x3]
Such an oddity with it, this is Sickology
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat [x3]

From our West Coast instructor: Crooked I

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
My killer Cadence can keep me crushin' the competition
Comin' correct when creatin' the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier, got a crooked copper missin''
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty - if I'm thirst-ay!
I change the pronunciation of words, per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap, this is how (this is how)
Right now I'm puttin' swag in my style (in my style)
It's an emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (and a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, this song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire

[Hook]

From our East Coast instructor: Chino XL

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
Everybody start lockin' their windows and doors, Chino might get in
It's like light-ning, how I'm strikin' a triflin' rifleman
Bullets flyin' up and I'm numbin' the bum, like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine, he could get rich from the recycling!
Chino be curdlin' blood, don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction, like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, industry hate me yo
I'd rather hear Hannah Montana than half of you rappers on the radio!
Startin' drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, that's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
With a sick delivery, like I drive a coroner van
I'm demented, spittin' writtens as sick as I can
Grenade grippin', fittin' to detonate Disneyland
I am teachin' Sickology, try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna

[Hook]

Yes I got to be vicious, this is Sickology

For those who don't know what the fuck's goin' on
This is Sickology 101, you punk motherfuckers!
Hahaha, let's kill these niggas[Hook: Kaydence]
I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I look over my shoulder not knowing where it's coming from
But knowing that its coming, I was bugging as a youngin'
Now I'm runnin from, something that'll even out my dumb decisions
The night I shot and had him bleeding out his lungs and spitting
Do any sins go unforgiven? I hope not
Cause most of mine were hunger driven, nothing in my mother's kitchen
Stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and the thunder hitting
So the well-screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missing
So not a chef but now the cocaine forever cooking
I love kids but now I'm selling to a pregnant woman
Stumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand
Gun on my waist and, "I don't give a fuck" is my plan
You'll never understand my palm sweat
Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I ain't find a calm yet
Go on let shorty sing
Cause ain't no way in hell this ain't Joell, that's brave enough to tell you everything

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Fuck all that rapping, I'mma let the conversation rock
I got skeletons in my closet
The living dead live in a nigga head, behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop and make it a vacant lot
The black mamba when I crack vodka, I'mma take a shot
And hope them stowaways go away before the anchor drop
Yeah thanks a lot, I'm a bottle-drinking nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em, I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleaning these demons out
In order to clean them out, you gotta scream and shout
All of your secrets out loud
It started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Ain't nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
And living in an abandoned station wagon because you was piss poor
So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
Thatâ€™s when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked Iâ€™s youth
I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
For real, bro

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I thought I had it all locked away till forever
But no memories fade away, They seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all then whys the pain still with me?

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
See the problem is, I know it all
Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really thereâ€™s no remorse
Maybe the Lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed I'm much too important to focus on
We could talk about pain 24/7 dog, thatâ€™s my department
Inter city blues cruise and Iâ€™m blasting that Marvin
Skeletons ainâ€™t in my closet, thatâ€™s my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
It's all bleak to me
Tell my Pop I ainâ€™t bothered when he don't speak to me
I love you but itâ€™s weak to me
On one hand life is short and thereâ€™s no excuse to do it
But you was missing half my life dog, Iâ€™m kind of used to it
Modern day Son of Sam, judge but you donâ€™t understand
Me against the world, I plan on winning, know Iâ€™m undermanned
Want to see through the eyes of a monster? Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here, just take care of half the rent

[Hook][Produced by Darknight & 8Bars]

[Bridge: Novel]
Last night I heard a voice say I'll be getting it my own way
I think I'm falling of the deep end so I haven't been sleepin'
Last night I heard a voice in my head
Said it's an emergency, said he had some work for me

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
He said fuck the world or maybe he said it in jest
I told him that I already did multiple times
Truthfully I wasn't never impressed
But to contradict that matter again
To the point where nothing matters again
More money, more problems, more cases, more lawyers involved
And more fame just means more paranoia involved
I done made friends, lost friends, same hour
Tried to use my troops as a means to gain power
Uh, same tricks, same cowards
Why I be like fuck any nigga that ain't ours
Never slipping, never threatened
I think they forgetting for a second non-fiction ain't a weapon
Thoughts could be hypnotic, nah, just neurotic
Called oft psychotic, flawed by off logic, but I got this

[Hook: Joe Budden]
Last night I saw the devil sitting in my room
And we greeted with a smile
Said that he had been there for a while
Last night I heard the devil talking in my head
Said this is an emergency, said he had some work for me
He said

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
He said one day your friends gon' be your demise
Said a few of 'em is me in disguise
Deceit in his eyes, said I like the teaching me wise
But the leeches I don't need in my life, please be advised
Real coy, listening, still annoyed
Said these hoes fill a void, all hoes, you still a boy
Said you searching, you don't know what to do
You thinking you fucking 'em when really they fucking you
Look, said they see you on feats
Said you give the love to the ones that need it the least
But wait, you can't put me on trial for my errors
I learned, trial and error, the how I couldn't tell ya
You talking to the realest, nah, just a realist
Nah, you just a nigga don't recognize what the real is
Thoughts could be hypnotic, thoughts get out of pocket
You'll be powerless, get lost, you try to stop it, I got this

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
He said what you doing this music for, I got news for ya
If you don't sell your soul to me
Then you just gon' ruin your future, bruh
See, I just cracked open this Goose
And I mixed that elixir with juice
Then I was introduced to Lucifer
In a dark room, his tongue as sharp as a harpoon
We started discussing things
He told me about his minions and his underlings
Told me that he was Gepetto of the ghetto
Had snake niggas on his puppet strings
Taught him betrayal and other schemes
He ain't new to this, he true to this, said he been doing this
Since Jesus was crossed for thirty pieces of silver
And he sealed the deal with a Judas kiss
When Ceasar was stabbed in the back
He was the one who placed the knife in Brutus fist
Now he got his hands in our music biz
Told me to ignore the war and the poor
Aim my music more towards the whores and drug lords
And the fans are pourin' through the doors
Sell out my tours, get awards galore
I told him I just wanted to be the modern day Marvin Gaye
He said you might wanna rethink that
Cause I know where your father stay
I'll possess him to pick up the chrome
Pop you in the dome for trying to tell the people for what's going on
He said that's where you're going wrong
It's more demons than angels in this biz, you're on your own
Wanna hit the big screens switch your sixteens
Get some slim jeans, get your big dreams
Or make your wrist gleam, get your big cream, hope you're listening
I just had to switch to his team, uh, it was tempting
The contract was in blood
He said I know you sick of trafficking drugs - sign it
Nah, I got this

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
I think the weed started fucking with a nigga[Intro]
Monsters in my head
Monsters in my head

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
What if I told you I wake up screaminâ€™ and swinginâ€™
Dreaminâ€™ that Iâ€™m fighting demons
Dreaminâ€™ Iâ€™m swinginâ€™ on heathens
Competinâ€™ and scheminâ€™ to eat every piece of my peace when Iâ€™m sleepinâ€™
Need a priest and a deacon
When Iâ€™m speakinâ€™ to preachers tell â€˜em Iâ€™m only at peace when Iâ€™m drinkinâ€™
Iâ€™m sinking deep into hell, thinkinâ€™ Iâ€™m fiendinâ€™ for freedom
â€˜Cause being in a well isnâ€™t good for my well being
A walkinâ€™ zombie I be comatose, nobody loves a nobody
Who probably overdosed in the lobby of the omni hotel
Probably find me with an empty bottle of oxy
Shakinâ€™ like an earthquakes inside me or I caught the Holy Ghost
Wonder if therapy can take care of these monsters
Before I kill more innocent people than Jared Lee Loughner
They spit on me, shit on me
Society kicked on me, hit on me til I was sick and exhausted
Flipped and I lost it off hallucinogenics
They using a clinic, I saw Luciferâ€™s image
The elephant in the room are my skeletons in the closet

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
Wake me up before Iâ€™m dead
Donâ€™t bury me with monsters in my head
Monsters in my head
With monsters in my head
And underneath the bed
Underneath the bed

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
I always see â€˜em out the corner of my eye
Scared to death to fully see â€˜em but I try
I just wanna ask â€˜em why they follow me around
And they reply when I hear a sound
Or they walk by and give me a chill I canâ€™t explain
It feels so strange is that a high
My anxietyâ€™s at an all time high
One second Iâ€™m good then I flip a switch
Then Iâ€™m thinkinâ€™ I might die
These dizzy spells are so annoying
From the outside looking in
Yâ€™all thinkinâ€™ Iâ€™m enjoying myself
I need help man, Iâ€™m destroying every positive force
With all these negative thoughts
How can I find happiness when I canâ€™t remember it's lost
I do so many temporary things
To smile for just a minute
Hat low but not for style Iâ€™m tryna hide under my fitted dog
Itâ€™s wild you wouldnâ€™t get it
Try my best to make everybody laugh
But thatâ€™s just a disguise, Iâ€™m really timid
Somebody make these feelings go away
Forget it, thatâ€™s my problem, yâ€™all go â€˜head
I hate these monsters in my head

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Itâ€™s lights out like where the Amish stay
PAC, you canâ€™t tax me
Iâ€™m like Wesley Snipes in a sovereign state
Iâ€™m a surviving walkinâ€™ oxymoron
Obviously I can say that I am alive
And Iâ€™m tryna die this way
Yaâ€™ll on your faggot shit
Iâ€™m on my "dragging my magnum clip"
With monsters in my head like Earvin "Magic" dick
Niggas dessert me like eating after the entrÃ©e
But Iâ€™ma keep it 3000 like after the Andre
Iâ€™ve adapted to a private life
Yeah right, you saying that is like sayinâ€™
Iâ€™m shooting dice on a floor made out of dykes
I made out alive, this chaotic life
I just figured just quit giving dick to trick bitches and stay out of fights
But Iâ€™m on my high snortinâ€™
You see this monster ball is like seeing Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton
Itâ€™s fucking classic
As far as rap, I wish I could wrap it in plastic
And stick it up your fucking asses
Iâ€™m a MONSTER

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Take heed to what Iâ€™m giving you
Beefinâ€™ is habitual
He just ridicules wants me in critical
Will appease and get rid of you
Maybe the only thing I seek is biblical
The scars are internal and the bleeding is invisible
Got a friend named depression, a pill I take to relax him
But when he regurgitates the aches you couldnâ€™t fathom
Got a few talents but looking for a new challenge
Iâ€™ll let you walk in my shoes once I find a New Balance
With faith I stay in peace, for I know every manâ€™s equal
So Iâ€™m playing with the monsters like a Space Jam sequel
Give â€˜em two choices
Since they wanna do the least, tell â€˜em get off my dick or renew the lease
Persevere though my bed is corrupt
Expect I give up when left to destruct
But I give less than a fuck
Sit back comfortably, react to what they want with me
The bright side is that they keeping an insomniac company

[Hook][Intro: Joe Budden - talking]
High on life, ta ha (Joey!)
J. Cardim, what up?
Parks, what up?
Dolla, what up? ... (ta ha)
I think we got one with this one baby
Not really, I hate when niggas say shit like that (Joey!)
Ta ha, quick question though
Y'all in that mood yet?
Ta ha, naw, naw they ain't hear me
(I said), y'all in that mood yet?

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Check, I broke down a while ago, finally pickin up the pieces
Memoirs on how the undefeated, can feel depleted
I don't talk to God as a matter of fact I plead with
At times I hate my reflection and others I'm conceited
Half the time I'm arrogant, other times I'm vengeful
At times it's to convince me, at times it's to convince you
Done a lot of wrong but I ain't never felt resentful
It's been so many times, I lost track of who to repent to
Half the time I'm in the cut, don't want you to notice me
Grow with me and you'll see that I'm only awkward socially
Half the time I'm spiteful, double barrel rifle
I owe so many payback, I feel like I got a right to
So if you need a case in point, you can refer to Budden
And it'll prove the painkillers never murdered nothin
All it did was make me succumb, put ice in me, make me numb
When I revisit the places it takes me from, I'm sprung

[Hook: Joe Budden]
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride
(I don't wanna sober up)
See with me the rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Tell me if you wanna ride or die
La la la la la la la la

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Listen up as a sinner reports, my inner thoughts like an inner war
Headaches act as a tremblin force on my mental ward
Mental's distraught, every word from this sinister boss
Is brought to you by the people like your minister's Porsche
Tight ropin on dental floss, before the haters begin to get lost
Coke and weed got my temperament off
But why would my temper get lost, when as soon as the temperature frost
I'm probably havin intercourse in a resort
Criminal report, pricey condos at a minimal cost
My train of thought ain't as simple as yours
So if our paths happen to incidentally cross
I pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws (ta ha)
Until then let's let the bass kick
Take a shot straight, I don't see a need to chase it
Tryin to fight the urge 'til there's somethin to replace it
I welcome y'all to be my co-pilots on this spaceship

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Yo, me and the gang would get so blunted
We'd order take out from the Chinese stores
Say make sure you bring change for a hundred, rob him, safety on the metal's off
Figured if we beat the brakes off him
Then how the fuck was he gonna pedal off?
Some live and die by the high, I was born by it
Since Pop gave my mom the needle like go on, try it
Got me feeling like ain't a nigga could harm me
So I go and scoop a mami that wanna come join the army
She was so militant, disciplined, diligent
So I whispered to her "bet you wouldn't mind chillin" and
I got to know her on my sofa
I gave her my honorable discharge and she took it like a soldier
See she the type you gotta watch when she come around
Really she only get high, so she can come down
Lost her when I said she ain't gotta settle
Once you start ahead in life, you'll be on the same level, I bet you

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
When I was five, this what my father said
"I should have pulled you out and left you on your mama's water bed"
You ask me, my papa's dead
Alcoholic genes from him since a toddler bottle fed
Put me in your stainless, I'm brainless, I'm a hollow head
(My life was the craziest), surprised I'm even walkin
Can you blame me if I'm (atheist)? But I ain't Stephen Hawkins
I know God is in my (radius), I can see him often
In the face of an innocent baby but not when preacher's talkin (come on)
My people sleep in coffins, I miss 'em, I'm breakin down
In the face of a bad bitch that I'm 'posed to be takin down
(Baby ridin while I'm cryin, I'm dyin inside
Cause my pain is Poseidon or a giant Leviathan that I'm hidin from the world)
They hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
How ironic, same place I vomit when I liquor drink
Apparently I need to get a shrink
How can therapy take care of me when I don't give a fuck what niggas think?
(Pull em off from me Joey)

[Hook][Intro: Crooked I]
Hip Hop Weekly, C.O.B
Circle of Bosses, Crooked I, thanks for fucking with me
You know what it is, hip hop is my mother
Gangsta rap is my father, C.O.B. is my religion
I am the president of ghetto America, yes
I am the poster boy for section 8
I am the leader of the I came from nothing campaign
Let's start off slow

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
When your album dropping? That's what they all say
Check the pulse on the streets, they saying it everyday
Niggas getting mad, say I'm losing fans
As if going through bullshit was part of my plans
They know I'm street money, they say a nigga's paid
They see the diamonds in the chain, they think I got it made
You one of the hottest with the flow as far as artists go
My penitentiary niggas say I got the hardest flow
I got a heart of gold, but now my heart is cold
Because these mean streets'll eat right through your heart and soul
What do you know about sleeping in an abandoned house? (nothing)
What do you know about beefing with them hammers out? (nothing)
Here's whats the man's about
I shot the belly of the beast with hollow tips
Until he spit me out of his savage mouth
From watching my mouth move to death they know I sound tight
My words paint pictures, that's how my blind listeners found sight
When this reciter's around mics
This profound writer mystifies cyphers
Just like lightning striking the ground twice
I'm on some other shit like attacking Henny for the fuck of it
Stacking pennies up to buy my mother whips
Greatest rapper alive, words from my mother's lips
You don't believe her then her son'll tell you suck a dick
There go that dropout nigga, he in a Bentley coupe
There go that welfare kid in that Armani suit
The first time they rode on me, yeah I was afraid to shoot
The second time I let my pistol whistle like a flute
Out west they wondering who's the hottest rapper, right
Here's some ammunition for niggas who defending my side
With skills I'm overdosing even with no promotion
I stand on my own two, Bobbito locomotion
You niggas over boasting, I see you just like view over ocean
Nigga my flow is frozen
You can ice skate on my 16s, nigga wait
Subtract half of that, it don't matter, it's still a figure 8

Yeah, I'm done with you niggas
You know the figure 8 joint they do on the motherfucking...
Fuck it

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
As a baby I sent lyrical signals through the umbilical
Ghostwrote my mother's poetry, even she knew that I'd grow to be
A dope MC, with lyrics in the womb
Meaning your doom, engineered in a cocoon with my fearlessness in bloom
When I spit even the dead hear it in a tomb
So when I'm spilling lyrics, I'm feeling spirits in the room
What up Pac? What up B.I.G.? What up my nigga Pun?
Eazy E, what up loc? Big L, what up son?
Yeah, I met Freaky Tah, yo what up dunn?
Left Eye was my homegirl, what up hun?
Everyone of 'em will tell you Crooked goes hard
Stay tuned, coming soon my rap report card

[Ad libs]
Double up on 'em
C.O.B. or nothing
Yeah
Hip Hop motherfucking Weekly, the double up
I see people like Oprah and Al Sharpton
Look like you all setting booby traps for rap
I'm so gangsta, ha ha
Yeah, hip hop won't die
Gangsta rap is breathing, ya heard me, yeah

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
This that motherfucking slow flow like it or not
I'll put my stage on the corner, put my mic on the block
If it's for this rap shit, give my life on the spot
If it's for the revolution man I'll sniper a cop
Mafia, got a Gotti agenda
Do you think I give a fuck about Oprah's audience members?
Hip hop is in my blood, nigga you probably remember
They attacked us before, didn't nobody surrender
Art imitates life haters, this is the deal
Dying of thirst in the desert, I wouldn't piss in your grill
Ain't a rap song on Earth that makes a listener kill
I'm just here to tell you how us ghetto prisoners feel
Ain't it funny how society's trying to bang on us
When there's schools that's named after some fucking slave owners
They historical heroes had the noose to hang on us
Now they mad at what I'm playing while my Chevy swing corners
What about violent movies?
Say I'm disrespecting women when rock n' roll invented the groupie
Better save that shit for Gucci
When I was in Milan I saw one of the models damn-near showing her coochie
Don't put prostitutes in my lyrical flows
But there was hookers in the bible, there was biblical hoes
My recital strictly based on what a criminal knows
Take a walk through my hood, watch you shit in your clothes
Try to blame us young niggas for this cocaine
FBI, CIA those are your planes
Junkies fucking with the shit to heal their own pain
You fund wars but me I'm just buying gold chains
And how am I a misogynist, nigga if I call a bitch a bitch
Believe that the bitch is a bitch
Yeah, some niggas killed my homie, I'm trying to find the suckers
All started with this bitch, he was trying to fuck her, he was dying to fuck her
Then he died when them niggas came inside with them nines going blucka blucka
They killed him for his money, just wanted to sex her
Stupid bitch set him up and I'm supposed to respect her
Fuck it, call a bitch a bitch when I spit on the record
If it's spotted with a long tail it must be a leopard
Don Imus called some women some hoes
That he didn't even know so they snatched his show
But if I call a woman a ho, best believe a nigga know
She selling pussy in exchange for that dough
Now let's talk about Virginia Tech
And the media's blatant disrespect for the family of the victims for a bigger check
Ban gangsta rap from MTV but you're showing Choon Seung-Hui on NBC
Whoever ran the footage we should body that nigga
Cause he probably gave birth to some copycat killers
Probably just spawned some young cocky cap peelers
Blood is on your hands when them body bags fill up
And you trying to shift the blame to hip hop
I say hip hop hooray just like back in the day
When they censor Public Enemy and N.W.A
Tipper Gore wanted to censor every record we play
I'm a motherfucking gangsta on your radio channel
Hypocrites want to ban me but they love the Sopranos
Better pull that Constitution out, read 'em and weep
Let's look at the first ammendment man, it say freedom of speech
Next week[Intro: Crooked I]
Turn the lights out
I'm with from the motherfuckin top
I'm with 2Pac in this Bitch

Capitol R shit, nigga aw shit
It's the Row Mixx bitch
Let 'em know, nigga

[Verse 1: 2Pac ]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision
My intensions' to get richer
With the S-N- Double O-P, Dogg my motherfuckin' homie
Youse a cold ass nigga on them hoes

[Crooked I]
And it goes
I got both heaters cocked
And I'm ready to ride
Whoever's ready for beef
Better be ready to hide
75 shots for whoever survives
Yeah, niggas leave the scene, but never alive
I'm in a cut-up-drop with a slut up top
I got a come up plot, don't come up shot
What up Pac?

[2Pac]
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down
This shit's about to go down
Aw, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

[Crooked I]
Yeah, we livin' lavish y'all
Getting' cabbage is our habit y'all
Before it's over, Ima have it all
Have your broad in a camisole
With the cameras on
Countin' money while I ram it dog
They been hating since they ran with the blue
Let my enemies witness me in a new blue infinity coupe
Sipping Coke mixed with Hennessy too
Whoever ain't a friend of me in this Industry
Is finna be brew, yeah you

[2Pac]
Now follow as we ride
Motherfucker the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how can they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these, motherfuckin' G's
If you got it better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of Amerikaz most wanted

[Hook: Crooked I]
Westcoast, Tha Row mix nigga
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party
Nuthin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery and suffering is greef
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flea, these niggas must crazy what
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fake the thugs
You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a Boss Playa

[Crooked I]
Boss Playa
Get the money and floss later
We all paid us, scratch 'em out like a cross fader
I'm Darth Vader, strapped like a violator
Them Southern Cal Streets is wild as Al Qaeda
Better watch it if you comin' to bang
Ride first class here, leave under the plane
You mislead, you better of tryin' to spread love
Brand New West, I'm the head Thug

[2Pac]
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw away
Floatin' in a black Benz
Tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg and me, eternally the most wanted

[Hook: Crooked I]
Westcoast, Tha Row mix nigga
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party
Nuthin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party

Yeah, D. Vegas, Crooked I, Makaveli
Without them weak ass niggas
Capitol R niggas
Yeah Row In Peace[Verse One] [Saigon]:
If I cock the biscuit, somebody gettin' a doctor visit
Listen to 2Pacalysm, flippin' how 'Pac predicted
A young death but still optimistic
My survival instinct will make me go rob the district
Spit an ox get a grip, rip you from your eyelid to lip with the bitter tip
Your shit will drip a lot more than a little bit
Your scar pa?
Uh huh, you will never get rid of it
Not even laser surgery will conceal your disfigurement
Stupid head, my niggas will mark you for dead
Pop lead, watch the hollow head slug particle spread
Sorry savage I'll introduce you to body baggage
Have the new body maggots eat you like crab ?
Y'all rappers is average my status miraculous
From Paris to where ever my dad is
I embarrass the bad
He pathetic, he inherited weak genetics
P alphabetics, fill it to speed at 1,120 feet per second
Makes a part of my fate to scar the Tri-State
Y'all niggas get ate, broke down to a carbohydrate
Saigon, Scram Jones
He violate, I ain't gon' make no damn poem
I'mma break that man bone

[Verse Two] [Nino Bless]:
Look I'm nice when I spit
I don't care if you got hype and you rich
I got the illest MC's rewritin' they shit
You and me?
It's like comparing a four star to a deli
Belly to Goodfellas or Hoodfellas to Biggie
B.I.G.'s flow to Diddy's
Or comparin' the 'burbs crime rate to the south side of any city
Or Yayo to 50's
Lil' Wayne's wordplay to Pun's dead-in-the-middle-of-Little-Italy scheme
Lyrically you ain't fit for the game
You ain't shit, I mean literally, you a walkin' shit stain
Talkin' like you did things
You not the gangsta, you just tell they story like Ving Rhames
And now we ain't the same, you and I sonny
Since I've been on, who took the light from me?
You nice? Get it right dunny
I've been dope since 'Pac was sportin' a Gumby dancin' behind Humpty
So this rap shit is light money
I hustle whatever the weather, whether it's night, sunny
I'm here movin' anything that brings dough
You can tell I hustle, I cop everything with singles
And I done been so broke totin' a fifth, locin' for chips
No angle, no hope to get rich
So lay low nigga, watch how you approachin' a spic
I'll clip the halo off the angel watchin' over you bitch
You niggas don't want it, don't even try
Get your weight up homie, you under size
Nino Bless, Scram Jones and Sai
Throw Crooked I in the mix and this alliance is sick

[Verse Three] [Scram Jones]:
I'm sick as scarlet fever, spittin' bars with ether
For the none believers, I'mma put it down like some carpet cleaner
In my Nature, gettin' pussy with my father's features
I'm not a player but get brains like a Harvard teacher
While these rappers are just cartoons like Bart and Lisa
All they do is bubble a little like Orangina
I've been doin' this since Mistadoblina
Way before the beef between Fif' and Don Cartagena
Before the haterade never used to taste the shade
Now dudes will cut you like they play Spades with razorblades
I'm at the airport changing clocks like Flava Flav
Still I love New York more than Tailor Made
Give NY power cause dudes is type coward
So I'mma put a cape on my back like Dwight Howard
Too busy shoppin' the tracks I couldn't take the time out
Watchin' dudes cop more crack than Amy Winehouse
Now I'm in the stoop, cookin' somethin' awful
And I ain't gonna stop till we pop and we all full
So we cuttin' up the pizza make the dough fast
Keep the money in the freezer, all we want is cold cash
The beat peddler in the street sector
Known to speak clever and rip like cheap leather
They say he a movie, more like the director
On the mic I O.D. like Heath Ledger

[Crooked I talking]:
It's your boy Crooked
C.O.B

[Verse Four] [Crooked I]:
Idiot W's up with my thumb cuffed
Must I stick my dick in a dumb slut
Just to illustrate you a dumb fuck?
A young buck
Me and my guns love struck
Get hit with the Magnum like Enter The Dragon nun chucks
Noon chucks, soon as the moon's up
Me and my platoon movin', assume that it's boom's up
With the .45's I carry, I bury my adversaries
Like lies buried in the library
See I'm sick as a witchdoctor
Pickin' which Glock to click pop ya
Sick as script written by Hitchcock
Or lyrics gettin' spit by Big Poppa
Leave a vic hoffa, stick me, I drip Vodka
Fo' fif' cocker
I'm a clique shocker/Chaka
Zulu, stickin' my chest out like a chick's knockers
Bitch, I spit lava
And I rock enough ice to entice a slick robber
But nigga you gets nada
All you get is murdered then dressed in a silly disguise
Since you a clown, it's a fitting demise
Yeah Crooked calls shots man, wigs can goosh
I don't know how fiction looks, just the licks, the jooks
The accountant to fix the books
The foot soldiers to push prescription kush
We just like the system; crooks
So fuck the cops and the warden
I spit for my niggas to make history like when Iverson crossed over Jordan[Crooked I]
Yo Iceman, watch how I come in this bitch off note
And bang for my team
If Mozart a genius, Iâ€™m the same fucking thing
Compare me the Pavarotti, I just canâ€™t fucking sing
If life is a fight Iâ€™mma aim duck and swing
I donâ€™t have to write â€™cause these lyrics came from a dream
Ssut ssut COB blame the regime
It's like green screen
The way we changed up the scene
Chain with the cross on it
Lamb shank with the cabernet sauce on it
And act a beat with the boss on it, slaughter
All upon it itâ€™s the God of
The west coast water
I canâ€™t walk on it yâ€™all want it
Nah, thatâ€™s a reason and die swallowing math equations
Tryin' to eat my piece of the pie
See I set my goal, so extremely high
I canâ€™t see 'em from my first class seat in the sky
And before my plane departed
I walk in security they say a chain retarded
Are you a famous artist, no
But fuck yeah my name regarded
As an underground beast Iâ€™m just trying to change the target
Meet Ras Kass & Kurupt this a holiday
Niggas better move like pedestrians right away
I give you the blue print to thug life
Like Iâ€™m reciting Pac and Jay
The modern day Marvin Gaye
â€™Cause my pops wanna pop me
I would drop him before he drop me
Didnâ€™t raise me and before cops can knock me
I would throw the Glock away when they stop me
And tell 'em my name is Scott free
Oh, Iâ€™m from the wicked west
Do I have a limit yes ,my limit is limitless
Fuck a cabby I packy
I blast from the back seat of his taxi
Then pass it to Ras Kass

[Ras Kass]
Fat pole in a slimy track
Grown up folk with a shiny gat
For more ex pills than tiny had
Sat where my crime is set
Never been a whiny rat
Stegosaurus rap reptilian with a spiny back
My East side bitch got hit with a shiny bat
In the wheelchair but her vagina ainâ€™t handicaped
Uh, her vagina ainâ€™t handicapped
Mensa member, big dick, good lookin' nigga, Annie rap
What you think all the guns is for
Iâ€™m going on tour in Mordor
With an elf queen for more whores
Throw us a Mexican drug warlord before poor
The skull of Abe Lincoln, seven years and four score
Want more call Crooked I, you could be Chinese
With the side ways face youâ€™re not Crooked I
Cali donâ€™t give a fuck gotta get through us
Lost lyricist trust now I pass to Kurupt

[Kurupt]
Heavenâ€™s got a gape in hole the souls are mischief, mischievous souls
Hellâ€™s frozen over pola I arose
Corrosion erosion temples are stealing stone
Crumble to the tone of the voice of vigilance
Violence in a judge,by the black a gap clap smoked then vaporized
Berserk a hydra, Cerberus
Wrap the titans connected to bend in both sides
Simultaneously at the same time he is eye
Double jeopardy, Gemini
Walk on the red carpet and turned it blue
Stand like a statue mind yourself
Reverse the camera lights and blind yourself
Iâ€™m the unseen sentinel sentinel
Oh, sent to your dough step to make buildings fall
I donâ€™t wear ice my nigga Iâ€™m cold already and diamonds canâ€™t freeze my wrist
Iâ€™m froze already, the future was already been wrote and cold already
The coded exposed we wrote and code already
Its the end of the end and beginning to begin
When it ends it all and it starts over again nigga
Heavenâ€™s got a gapin' hole the souls are mischief
Escaped the road on the road to redemption Arctic
And art the archangel when hence means
Soaking these rodent rappers
Drenching in the instinct firing golf to body
Send in, in an instinct god he ate off the body
Send in every into 'em ,Hitler
Bitter bitter turn them to cat litter
Infrastructure are crumbled, infra-red spitter
Got 'em like an eye grass crooked eye cash bringing these niggas
Corruption world wide
Money ainâ€™t a thing. bitches ain't shit
And neither are you nigga eat a fat dick
Hoes give me money niggas get shot
Every day in LA every way and every night
Every night, Every night
West coast murder[Intro: Crooked I]

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Yeah, Crooked keep a German Luger, a bazooka and three vests
He's not from Cash Money, but man he's fresh
Ever since I was a baby I was about them millions
All about my paper like my name was Slim Williams
We kill like we primitive, warn women and children
Them wig-pealing henchman have just entered the building
Toatin' things with 'em
See I've been packing heaters since niggas was wearin' Adidas with no strings in 'em
Crooked' flow bring venom
I'm hungry as if my pockets had no cheese in 'em
Unload: heat hit 'em
The strap spark it, you collapse on a shag carpet
The gat's heartless: watch it hit the exact target
Act hard bitch: we love it when cats start shit
Kill 'em and sell they vital organs on the black market
How many songs must I fucking record?
Get a thug in the door, 'til he's runnin' the board
Fuck a couple awards; I want the cover of Forbes
Nigga try to stop that he's gettin' stuck with a sword
You don't need nicotine to put a hole in your lungs like emphysema
Cause I can do it quick with this trigger finger
Attitude on the mic like Ike when he was sick of Tina
Switch the demeanor, when I'm in the 360 Modena
Fuck a subpoena, a felony or a misdemeanor
Nigga wanna snitch on me, watch how quickly I click the Nina
Yeah, rappers think they hot enough to do me
I'm way ahead of you nigga, you need binoculars to view me
I sock you up and if you think I'm popular then sue me
Your body's poppin' up in two weeks
That don't rhyme, this insane cat don't mind, to add on line
I spit game like Pat O'Brien, big thangs, I don't plan on dyin'
My nick name is Spit Flame, quick aim, I keep my hand on iron
And I don't really wanna have to point this pistol at your throat
And send you to somebody who took the Hippocratic Oath
Switch it up, each rhyme is vivid, each line: I live it
It's a movie, nigga, these are some cinematic quotes
Your verse sound plastic, just another Hearse-bound bastard
In a dirt ground casket, Crooked is a first-round draft pick
In the first round get your ass kicked
And die when the first round blast you
{Gunfire}I'm about that life, my G
My gun'll load
I live by another code
My desire -- run the globe
While you thinking you was born to be the shit
Because you fell out of your mother's other hole
Hell motherfucking no
You don't think Crooked I's hot?
Why not? Is it cause my Maybach's in your blind spot?
I sleep with one eye open like a insomnia-stricken Cyclops
Cause I could rest in a pine box
I'm on; so many tricks, can't even count 'em
So high I probably fall up my stairs 'stead of down 'em
So high, call that American Airlines
Slaughterhouse, niggas rip shit e'ery time
You not a legend like John
Move back, like his embarrassing hairline
Let the heir to this chair shine
Throughout ugliness, them Slaughters there with me
It's all Lovie Smith, my team bear with me
Still I'm feeling like a organ donor
Niggas dying to get a part of me
Like I was born with a rare kidney
But come and get me
I'll leave you down under somewhere in Sydney
Different type of chopper, still airlifting
See, my mama named me Dominick
That's anonymous with ominous
I'm in this game to show you what drama is
I'm in this game to conquer it
Like Genghis Khan and his monstrous entourage
What challenger can dodge my barrage?
Look at the duPont Registry, that's my garage
Convertible Beamer, paint blacker than Amistad
Hear the engine noise I'm blowing with different toys
Still I rap like Kool G. when he was spitting "Poison"
My pen game is sick, call it penicillin
Sky's the limit, this is the flow that can kill a ceiling
You guys are gimmicks, so hide your women
Crooked's into Virginia, drilling the realest women
Feel a villain, I fill em with big pimping
Even the virgins
I lose a leg, I throw a shoe on my third one
Look how easy the words come
I'm the West Coast savior
Why you think they yelling, "Church" when my verse done
Speaking of church, I'm from the city where sinners dwell
Said it's the L-B-C, we came to give 'em hell
It's judgement day, I'm judging these infidels
Sipping Zinfandel, my liquor be off the Richter scale
And on this t-h-r-o-n-e I will sit a spell
Yeah, that line's sicker than sickle-cell
Now niggas know what it is
We the Chuck Taylor crew, all bars
I mean the Chuck Taylor crew because we all stars
You add Eminem, and the hits are the hardest
We turn djs to MMA fighters when they mix Marshall artists
West Coast, we ain't fucking with the garbage
You ain't fucking with that Dodger hat, unless your name Mr. Marcus
I lift your carcass
If you listen to this ill spit in your whip
The shit'll get you carsick
This Long Beach every day, y'all
I say free Tray Dee, I say R.I.P. Nate Dogg
I'm just a Slaughter rider
Waiting for you in the same basement
That Biggie Smalls had your daughter tied up
Waiting on this snitch's car to ride up
He come inside and die
I hop in his whip, turn the car to five
I mean the car to four
I paint any town red, that's the art of war
I bust you in any city; this is not a tour
I tax you; I'm not an auditor either or
But I'm at you -- it ain't no better mobsters
We a mix between Tyra Banks and energy drinks
Four-headed monster[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Adrenaline
Open up the vein get a bit insane better train
Jane to be shelling me in sentimental cellophane
Wrek is aimed higher than the heavens on a weather vane
Better stay ready man if you sleeping get a lane
(Wake up) Time to get a better brain
Fly over rooftops i don't need to shed a thang
Lighter than a feather when I fly cause I'm clever
But I still drop bombs like a military aero plane
This'll be epitome of energy get up
And get it physically or bleed for the remedy
I think it's gonna be a murder of the gimmicky
Silliest motherfuckers who been acting like they getting g's
Let the conquest go critics and cynics in it to bomb Wrek's flow
Millions of minutes we get them all left low
I been on that show with a Comcast soul
I'll connect you get your extra decks to lecture necks snapping the best of
People in Miami out over into the rest of the world wide sector

[Hook: Wrekonize]
I never felt this free before in all my freaking life
These inhibitions clearly need to cease to be denied
Cause you and I will ride until the sun is in our sights
I don't know how else to describe it but it's nice
When it's all up in my bloodstream (Bloodstream)
Deep inside my bloodstream (Bloodstream)
I can feel it in my bloodstream (Bloodstream)
It's been released into the bloodstream
Let's hope this kind of feeling never dies

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
(You can feel it in your veins, adrenaline)
Shake shack vibe with a payback line
Tell 'em to leave him be in the cave that's fine
Reclusive dude with loosey tunes a nuisance
All up in the business with an 8 track grind
I sat up with a boombox and threw thoughts
In Hollywood Miamis little version of the boondocks
We beat up on the trash cans and who thought
I'd take it the level we all know only a few rock
Better than the beef ends
Tell 'em to get packing with the backing of the defense
I wanna just see a sequence decent
These motherfuckers coming up to challenge us in sequins
I came to change the lame brains
Refrain the same game and stake the name claim
Let's see if they can get it with no credit overzealous
And they bet it all down on the fake estate fame

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
So many niggas wanna come at the Crooked and let a couple of shots
Spin me around like Iâ€™m a featherweight, not knowing that Iâ€™m heavyweight
Smith & Wesson weapon will make you elevate and levitate
When I regulate, I hit the streets like I never ate
I click heat and I never wait, I wouldnâ€™t hesitate
To strap a time bomb to myself and hug you until it detonate
Youâ€™re 6 feet, Iâ€™m 11'8'â€˜
And if I told you once, I told you twice
I hold the guns, Iâ€™m so precise, so run, nigga, run
When the soldier come, Iâ€™m cold as ice
So hold your tongue or roll the dice, youâ€™re done when I come
Iâ€™m a poltergeist, Iâ€™m givinâ€™ â€˜em rhythm quick as a cobra strikes
Kill 'em and kill 'em again
The shots slow your life, you shouldâ€™ve known the price
Killer that holds the knife to your throat and slice
And when Iâ€™m creepinâ€™ by, I'm dippin' the â€˜Lac
Homie the reason Iâ€™m, rippinâ€™ the gat is to go "BRRAT, BRRAT"
Then your people die, nigga, blink your eye
I'll put you on your back quicker than that, uh[Intro]
There's a million motherfuckers out there that support this raw shit
This Slaughterhouse shit
All the time I'm thinking...

[Hook]
Hoping my true motherfuckers know
That the House Gang will never fold
Against all odds
I'm in my studio getting blowed
Watching rap niggas sell their soul

[Verse 1]
How did we end up here, got the Blueprint from Biggie and Nas
Ghetto niggas going platinum like the 50's and Ja's
It's against all odds
Should it be against yall broads
New niggas out here dressing like Nicki Minaj
Selling their soul to make it wealthy
Wearing women shirts and denim skirts on Instagram taking selfies
I celebrate the minute you die
And I'll be here after the firework, 5th of July
Here lies a fictional writer considered a liar
Always rapping about trapping and what actors did on The Wire
Then they ask me why I'm rapping like a killer for hire
Some niggas locked my homie in a truck and lit it on fire
You can I hear my life's pain in the way I spit
Think I give a fuck if a DJ play my shit?
Or like my shit, put it in a club, hype my shit
I write my shit Real niggas recite my shit
And your label they own you, that ain't no lease agreement
Please believe it, got you on your knees and screaming
Looking like you in the navy with a cold
Cause they dicks so far up your asshole you're sneezing semen
Then they put you on a single with the same niggas
On them other singles man ya'll just a bunch of lame niggas
You're hot now but how long will the shit last
If I don't feel your music I ain't rapping with your bitch ass (no)
And I bet I still won't come around broke
Rifles spitting hollow tips right out of his hundred round throat
When I'm buried six feet deep, counting eternal sheep
It'll all make sense, I'll be the underground GOAT nigga
Syllable king, lyrical dream, niggas be like typical memes
I'm killing your dreams, pop you in your bed dozing
My shooters come out the closet quick as Frank Ocean (Got ya)
I'm the illest lyricist of them all
I'm taking you niggas through lyrical training you ain't in my lane and
I'm giving a fuck if you think you a star
The bigger they are the harder they fall
I slip in a clip and I set the apocalypse off
Shots can lick off, your life'll get lost
And it'll be your own fault, remember your own role
Like a bitch with a dildo, you're digging your own hole
West Coast, my kingdom is there
I've been underground for years, you think I would care
Cause mainstream artists with bars you can count 'em with one hand
Still have a middle finger to spare, fuck 'em
I ain't hating I'm just telling the truth
When I see a real MC, I tell 'em salute
Against all odds...

[Hook][Hook]
Ain't worried bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'

DJ Skee ain't worried bout nothin'

[Problem]
Go there with that work, went out for them people
And them ho niggas looking thirsty, please get them Aquafina
Money gone faster than cheetahs, old hoes miss this king like Cleveland
I ride through the hood, sucka niggas be hatin'
Say they sure gon' get at me, I been anxiously waitin'
Sippin' Pina Coladas, smoking flower with asians
Bitches, can't worry bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'
Nigga wanna fight, we can trunk em
Reebok pump lumps in the young punk, ya feel?

[Hook]

[Crooked I]
I'm in the strip club, Secret Sunday, nigga got a 50 Band necklace on
I'm by myself, I'm turnin' up, haters out here better respect the throne
It's C.O.B. until they bury a nigga, Sut two times, what up my COB
This street money, I ain't worried nigga, I don't work, but see I love my job (Nigga work)
See me rollin' up the block, while I'm throwin' up a knot, and I'm going to the spot
Bad shorty on my jock, bad shorty on my jock
Open up her box on the Coconut Ciroc
This Eastside, L.B. City boy, rock 2 chains like Tity Boi
Crooked I live like a model with ass, that mean a nigga sit pretty boy

[Hook]

[Dizzy Wright]
East side, Las Vegas, young player comin' out of nowhere
Now I'm rappin' with the Big Seans, you like Woah Dere
Lil nigga, don't go there, so rare
I'm prepared for the lifestyle
Spit it how I live it when the mic's out
Got a housewife in a nightgown
Before rap, the one L, but let me put the pipe down
Comin' from the city of the Fight Night
Bringin' entertainment to the limelight
All the city really needed was an artist
And guess who the hottest, I guess I got the green light
Skee life, what it be like
Dizzy Wright be like what the tree like?
Kushed out in the function
Can't kill my vibe, fuck nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'

[Hook]

[Game]
Got a million on my neck, lil fuck nigga, I ain't worried bout much
Y'all worried bout us, 16 out the clip till his watermelon bust
Got a bitch ridin' shotgun, with a .45 and a Louis Vuitton clutch
Where I been in the cut? Now I'm back, it's a rap, whole world on my nuts
And your girl on my nuts, consequences when these niggas be cuffin'
I'mma hit her raw, them I'm pulling out, nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'
I ain't worried bout nothin', red styrofoam cup, sippin' on that gas
I can slow it down like French, or I can go Twista on that ass
My nigga turn it up, never turn down, while I'm sippin' the Don
My niggas gettin' it on, we got yo bitch in a thong
Flippin' her dome, one sip and she gone
We turn it on, give her the long bone, and then she go home
Make a nigga pull a grip out the cut, call a bitch I could fuck
Have her howlin' at the moonlight, AK 47 in your bitch
Put the pussy on Instagram, show you what the goon like
These LA hoes don't like me cause I fucked em all
I wear Louis, I wear Gucci, nigga fuck the mall
Niggas kill the club, so they kill fraud
I'm bout to kill me a nigga, and beat the charge

[Hook]

[French Montana]
Ridin' round with that work, strapped up with that Nina
Got two bad bitches with me, Molly and Aquafina
Money don't mean nothing, niggas don't feel you when they see you
My whole 'hood love me, but now a nigga wanna touch me

[Hook][Intro]
Fuck man. Damn man, I was fucking a lot of bitches on Death Row
But god damn man, I'm fucking way more bitches on this Shady shit
Man this shit ain't even cool man like these bitches falling in love
Man I need to come clean, not even bitches man, like women man
I need to come clean with this shit, damn Dominick

[Verse 1]
Dear women in my life
Past, present, and future I'm giving you the right
To judge me now, bringing my sinning to the light
Even the women I might be swimming in tonight
Even the women that wanna kill me with the knife
Cause they heard about other women I'm givin' em the pipe
I'm knowing the way that a nigga living isn't right
But my angels and demons they keep getting in a fight
Half of me wants to be happily married with a family, just like plenty of dudes
But the other half wanna keep fucking these bad ass bitches out here who keep sendin' me nudes
I know a lot of men been in my shoes
Crooked so confused, when he winning he lose
He winning in the fuck a bad bitch category
But he losing with the shallow ass women he choose
I mean, god almighty, look at the body
On little mommy, fo sho, you a hotty
Knew where I was stayin' so she waited in the lobby
She a predator, I'm her prey and she shot me
Now we in the room man, working the sheets
We going half on some twins, that's a person a piece
She kept coming on strong but my woman back home gon' be hurting for weeks
Got the dirt in the streets, cause

[Hook]
This temptation is a real situation
And my chick been patient for all my of fornication
Hop in your panties, I'm risking it all
Cheating so how can my family evolve
Real good girl in a fucked up world
A lady fell in love with a god damned dog
Once upon a time in the LBC, a lady fell in love with a god damned dog
Once upon a time in the LBC, a lady fell in love with a god damned me
Hop in your panties, I'm risking it all
Cheating so how can my family evolve
Real good girl in a fucked up world
A lady fell in love with a god damned dog

[Verse 2]
You there? You ask if I care? The answer is yeah
You ask me to swear, I know it ain't fair, I know I'm a player
You where? Why are you there?
How can I be mad if she flipped the script
Tired of lies and decide to hop dick-to-dick
Crying her eyes out in my house
Decide to find out how I feel if another nigga lick the uh
Some niggas won't admit it but I'm telling you that we don't give a fuck if we've been cheating
We don't want you getting even
We don't even want you leaving even though we been creeping and meeting people in the mother fucking hotel
We be like "oh well", wax that ho tail, then I make a song about it
I give the bitch some bars like no bail, Peace Prize Nobel
Feeling fucked up when it's all over the real shit begin
A guilt trip again, and she sick of going through thick and thin

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Can anybody feel me? Can anybody feel me?
I'm talking bout the real me
And the real me is guilty of putting many women in the eye of the storm
Is it truth serum Crooked I is on
Every song ain't gon' have a happy ending, the old lady said I would die alone
If I don't change all of my ways, I'mma live all of my days
In a daze under the haze of a cloud full of darkness
Can't swallow the pain and the pain's all in my brain
And I can't follow the maze, man I'm lost, I ain't heartless
I looked in the crystal ball and the only thing I saw
Was me standing all alone, me standing on my own
I looked in the crystal ball and the only thing I saw
Was me standing all alone, how did I end up all alone

[Hook][Hook: Crooked I]
All I know, is for sure
Hip-hop ain't dead
Yeah that's what I said
It lives through me

[Verse: Crooked I]
Growing up as a kid, what did hip-hop mean?
Mama bought me a boombox before I was a teen
But unfortunately she had a welfare salary
So they cut off our electric, and I ran out of batteries
Aw naw, no music; I'm ready to brawl
Freestyling in the dark, words bouncing off the wall
I used to hate that shit, growing up poor
But now I realize it made my rhymes hotter than yours
Waiting on the day that my metaphors would open better doors
Battling for cheddar shitting on competitors
Pistol ready for whatever wars
My .22 stayed open just like the legs of eleven whores
The Cali mentality, ruthless in behavior
This is why I'm hot: nigga music is my savior
In the booth, yeah the truth is in my flavor
In the coupe, yeah the roof is in the air
How you gon' tell me that this kid's not crazy?
Made seven songs a day and it did not faze me
Don't make me change the shit to hip-hop daily
Record so much you wondering if 'Pac raised me
I'm just not lazy, am I a genius?
Did Prince rock Paisley? I did my Jay-Z --
Rendition, no pencil, no paper
Never heard a pin drop baby, tip-top shape G
Flow been on morphine; sick since fourteen
Watching rappers belly-flop minus the chlorine
I'm snoring; the game is boring
Like I got a scoring -- title and four rings
Plus a scorching jump shot that torch teams
And I'm forcing myself to play with you poor things
I've foreseen it all before it happened
A lot of niggas go platinum, they 'yes man' start clapping
For they captain, right after them niggas finish rapping
But everything they was rapping was wack that's what's happening
That's why a lot of mainstream niggas stink
Between hip-hop and gangsta rap I'm the missing link
The streets hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
When my enemies was coming to get me I didn't blink
If there's any rapper that should be your favorite, it's me!
I got my own category: Gangsta Emcee!
I manipulate break beats thanks to MPs
And I still break a bitch like my name was Pimp C
Pimp C, Pimp C, like my name was Pimp C
Still break a bitch like my name was Bun B!

[Hook] (2x)[Intro: Will.I.Am]
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh, haha, oh!
Oh, haha, oh!

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
East side, wild city; got my block with me
Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
Death around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
Bring the word like a preacher
Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa
When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like a [warner?]
Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Not  just because you [?] guns
Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
But I was built in [?], in the ghetto (stop)
Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock
I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)
Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)
Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows
Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)
Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods
Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
In full, like ace till momma's straight
And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight
Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
Cause you might need it, more than I
All My Life Remix, brought to you by:

[Hook]

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
This what you doing for town, huh Rock
Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
[?], make the pain get lost
Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
Scream "New West" had everybody pounding
Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
Go to hell, i got records to sell
Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese
You can ask my homie Adolf, he wrecked them niggas in [?]
I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees

[Verse 8: Nipsey Hussle]
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on a block, blue collar wasn't me
My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"
We [?] pick you up and drop you off down the street
And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
But they all ever seem to hear is all red [?]

[Verse 9: Sinful]
Vamos, todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
Long Beach California vecinos de Watts
Mira como abrazo el [?]
Y ahora mira lo que toque, yo
No mÃ¡s pistolas y rosas, no
No mÃ¡s [?] con fÃ¡cil copas, no
AprendÃ­ si no hay [?] nadie avanza
El barrio nos [?] [chansas] y [los] [planchas]
Amor a las calles, que me criaron a mi
A ese que muriÃ³ porque me brincaron a mi
Fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocÃ­
Mucha sangre, mucha lÃ¡grimas yo lo vi
El esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
El mejor secreto guardado por cierto
Descanso con un ojo despierto
Silencio soy el Ã¡guila del [?]

[Verse 10: Ya Boy]
I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
I was right there at that corner store
I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
I even had cream, like Rocky Road
I thought getting out the hood was impossible
That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note
If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!

[Verse 11: Roccett]
Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
Got the black bandana with the strap to match
Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
As I rock throwback like the huxtables
Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine

[Verse 12: T.K.]
I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
My whip lean, my shoes clean
Diamond watch, low-key
All sip, mint green
Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas [?] don't fronting me
I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it

[Verse 13: Problem]
(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?
I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all
Look like new waves but I' stuck them home
Niggas want to creep when they think you on
So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!

[Hook]

[Verse 14: Young Keno]
(I feel you Jay)
I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
And even though I moved a little  work
I still suited up for a Sunday at Church
Then back to the block, to diss a few [packs?]
Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
This day and night though, I know it ain't right
But down in the hood, man, this is our life

[Verse 15: Spider Loc]
I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water
Both feet [?] hard on the angle
Hood on the back [?], stars on the ankle

[Hook]

[Verse 16: 211]
Product of the block, young rider from the block
Used to run on 'em niggas, [?] rob them with the Glock
In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
Got my enemies hot, cause I made a [?]
We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
I heard the [?] want me, they gon' have to come and catch it

[Verse 17: Bangloose]
Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping
What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?
I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
I'm so cocky, you wish you could be [Bane?]
You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
Banging you so tight, like a [bike chain?]
You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
Yeah, [?] socks, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 18: Mistah F.A.B.]
Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope
My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!

[Verse 19: Roscoe Umali]
Came from nothing, rose from slums
Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
Half these wack rappers is some good actors
Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta
But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit

[Hook][Verse 1: Crooked I]
And she don't even know the business
Here I go again man cheating on my mistress
And she don't even know the business
Here I go again man cheating on my mistress
And she don't even know the business
Here I go again man cheating on my mistress
My team go beta, resource cost secrets
Kind of ironic I'm here on some creep shit
Freak shit, Chardonnay and a back brown
Knocking it down romantic G shit
We don't even smoke both got the leaflet
The few on the balcony is sea sick
She said her body is my property
So the both pair pink lips
I got the pink slip
But these lips are sealed
Cause I do know I sink ships
As I drink sips
Oh the pizza arrived, sitting on the rocks
Different kind of ice sitting on the watch
Licking on her box like the well payed killer
Pussy assassinated by a self made nigga

[Hook: Kobe]
Body like a porn star
In a head game killer, killer, killer, killer, killer
Somebody must've taught you well
Shorty sure is a keeper
I ain't never gonna trip on who you see
Just make sure you bust it down for me

[Verse 2: Soopafly]
See you don't even know what the time is
Girl you go again nosy, sinus
Yea bitches gon' be on me promise
I never love 'em always fuck a bitch highness
But never this talking
I'm rough but it's not
When it's time to get to lovin'
Deepen that muffin, blue berry kush
Got enough bottom weed for the whole month
My bitch still in fly as nothing
Craving so much ice and gold
When I pipe it slow
I'm like king Minos fucking
Baby lookin' like time well
Spend on top of this bad ass 9 inch dick
The future of flying sick
Lavish like a bow tie event
Grab this microphone while we drift off
Into a dimension of a life we missed
Bullet twice be a bliss

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
And she don't know what going on
Wife here all alone while I'm getting my mogul on
Pick up the wine crackers in the cove alone
Driving a car with a house calling it my mobile home
Top floor the rich my bitch there waiting
Voices in my head I hear a pimp narrating my life
You wanna know the way I truly do it then
Put a max jewely in movie in beauty and the beast
Juicy ass, booty in the Louie V panties
I remove 'em then I stick the bazooka in
She started out Nubian as Estelle
'Til I fuck her pearl as Adele
She bent over hands on the rail
Cause she lost the coin toss
She called heads I called tail
On my way home, I'm smelling like my new chick
Wife be there horny, she got me working two shifts

[Hook]Ã—2[Verse 1 - Sir Aah]
And the beat rocks on
She ain't had a feeling like this
In so long. She never had a love
So strong. Other dudes came, but
They did her so wrong. But they gone
I'm finna get on, and when I get on
I'mma give her my all. "Sir Aah!"
I wonder what she moan for
Don't swim, but I can do the breast crawl
Let's go, I'm thinking about Carribbean
And my money long like hair that's Indian
Slum dog, about to make a Bentley and
The beats rock on, I know you be feeling it
Come hit me and she got a big wardrobe
Suitcases, she got em by the boatload
Bootleg, she got em on the low and the
Beats rock on in the home of the go-go

[Hook]
And the beat rocks on
Get fucked with your Reeboks on
And the beat rocks on
She ain't had a feeling like this in so long
The beat rocks on
Cause she never had a man that's so strong

[Verse 2 - Royce da 5'9'']
And the beat rocks on
You couldn't walk in my shoes
With 3 socks on. Ha!
Sitting on grain, getting my treetop on
Fully-loading pistol whistling like a teapot
Uh! No T's on it if ?
I'm giving orders like I'm hanging
In the drive-thru, you know how I do
I'm like a Moonwalking Mike Jackson
I'm entertaining when I slide through
I keep the iron where my waist at
I keep my eye ? on the face tag
Trying to fine rhymes is like trying
To find hair from the top of the head of
A giant in a haystack. Shallow grave
Body placemat. You draw that, I'll erase that
It's called "My Bach" not "Maybach"
A lot of niggas be wyling, but mama they wack

[Hook]
And the beat rocks on
Get fucked with your Reeboks on
And the beat rocks on
She ain't had a feeling like this in so long
The beat rocks on
Cause she never had a man that's so strong

[Verse 3 - Crooked I]
Short hair, don't care. Platinum Patron
The cologne I'm gonna wear
And I'm walking on air, oh
There she go over there, so rare
Oh yeah, a dude gonna stare. No she
Can't hide under that high hat
Her face fine, and her waistline
Is the bassline. She'll be gone
In 3 1/2 minutes when I finish
So I won't waste time, give her
16 straight lines. Comments? I got em
I'll write her poetry if she let me
Feel that 808 bottom
Bending it over, now getting it on
Is that a snare? Or is her bed hitting the wall?
Go live and her nigga's gonna call
Surround sound speakers? Yeah, I'm blaming y'all
Baby don't scream when I'm deep up in it
Her heart beating at 113 beats per minute

[Hook]
And the beat rocks on
Get fucked with your Reeboks on
And the beat rocks on
She ain't had a feeling like this in so long
The beat rocks on
Cause she never had a man that's so strong[Verse 1]
C.O.B in this bitch, wave the black flag
Different kind of gang member, house nigga, back back
I tell my bitch pussy pop on a handstand
While the world going to hell in her Louis handbag
It ain't the end of the world, but it's like the end is starting
Adam Lanza killing 20 children in a kindergarten
Wade Michael Page shooting up a Sikh Temple
George Zimmerman the reason I'mma keep pistols
Even though I don't fuck with the NRA
Cause the CEO Wayne LaPierre, yo what he say
Man he try to blame violence on rap music and video games
Like we out here killing for any old thing
If I was reckless I would tell you rappers give me your chain
A million views on Vimeo
I creep low through the Savannah, I'm hunting you, gazelle and deer
What's that? I can smell your fear
I'm a apex predator

[Hook]
Ridin' in the Coupe, man
Real niggas, we the top of the food chain
Don't make me turn the whole club into a shootin' range
King of the jungle, fuck with me my gun go bang
My gun go bang, my gun go bang, and my gun go
Fuck with me my gun go bang, my gun go bang, and my gun go bang
My gun go bang!

[Verse 2]
I'm a apex predator, pineal gland in forefront
On your third eye, graduated to my fourth one
You cross us in the street nigga, you're done
Like a child support judge, we hold court son
Glen Beck want us all to die
And Ted Nugent want us all to die
But real niggas don't die
We like that shopping center bag full of tissue, we multiply
I know I reached for that one
No serial numbers, you know I reach for that gun
I call on Bonnie, she my right hand girl
I can't even turn my music up in this white man's world
If I do, I get shot by a psycho's favorite gun
Sorta like Jordan David was my Michael David Dunn
We need help, won't nobody listen to them hollow tips that's hittin' politicians
I'm a apex predator

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bang, hit em up, perfect execution
I'm in the underground training for the revolution, you niggas scared of shootin'
You ain't gotta agree with Darwin to stand your monkey ass up, this is evolution
I knew that rebel G shit would be back soon
For you thousand dollar house, niggas call you rap coons
I hang with foreign mobsters and black goons
Type of people that'll strike fear into a packed room
They ain't afraid of my nine though
They in fear of what my mind know
They know I ain't walkin' with my eyes closed
My entourage is camouflaged by nice clothes
Blood in our veins is ice cold cause we apex predators!

[Hook][Intro: Crooked I]

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
COBâ€™s my religion and I put it on the Bible
G.O.D is my Shepard and I got my own disciples
Challenge us in these Last Days, and I flip you
As quick as a diesel hitting a motorcycle with my loaded rifle
No more vitals, I ain't talking to Ellen or Perez Hilton when I'm tellinâ€™ gay rappers that I'm homo-cidal
Leave 'em dead on arrival
The most resilient and brilliant rapper, I own the title, plus I'm a local idol
Leeches make songs about me, then they backfire
Try to suck the blood out my buzzâ€”-fucking vampires
Screwing wit ya career is just like fucking vampires
Itâ€™s already dead, itâ€™s that whack shit you ran by us
Maybe I am biased, I think I'm the best
Maybe my compass is broken and I just think Iâ€™m the West
Maybe for every verse I spit Iâ€™ll put that ink in my flesh
And be a testament for everything that I think when I rest (Yes)
May I fade â€˜em, my songs be superb
Hit the ghetto and suburbs, and cross over like A.I. made â€˜em
I'm so ahead of my time that I gotta turn my clock back when I rock so everyday is Daylight Savings
I cast a humongous shadow, rappers are livinâ€™ in it
I kill you in 60 seconds, Why? Cuz itâ€™s been a minute
Since I slayed a major or independent lyricist
You wanted it: here it is. You get offended: splendid
When did Crooked give a fuck? Homie, I'm outspoken
But I don't shit on everybody dawg: I'm house broken
That mean you gotta be worth it, I beg you niggas' pardon
You only rhymingâ€™ words, we did that shit in kindergarten
I'm breathing fire, my lungs look like I lit a carton of Camels, took consecutive breaths, and started spittin' carbon
You couldn't be more vagina if you was in a womb
Itâ€™s space in the booth, but my skills need a bigger room
And I know cops want the scoop on a killer goon
Couldn't get the scoop if they brought Reese with her spoon
Either I'm the best or a damn liar
Haters plan to stop me, but they plans backfire! [echo]

[Outro: Crooked I][Intro: Crooked I speaking]]
Yeah, yeah, live from L.B.C, or as we like to call it, Live Bossy City
East side

[Hook: Dr. Dre and Crooked I]

Get my drink on and my smoke on
Then go home with somethin' to poke on
Back to the L.B.C
Back to the L.B.C, follow me, uh
Back to the L.B.C
Back to the L.B.C

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Shown up, Crooked is so thug
White T-shirt it's gotta be broke club
E.V., some jeans your boys no scrub
Whip on dubs so these chicks they show love
I let 'em know a hood stars in the house
Cremmie and watch Cuban cigars in his mouth
Here to get paid in the largest amounts
Stacks a couple R&B stars then I'm out
This goes out to the homies on the block
Trying to get that paper can you feel me?
Money every day, money every night
We gon' get that dough
Follow me as I take my clique to the T.O.P
Circle of Bosses yeah we the C.O.B
Baby girl love young Crooked yeah he O.G
So in the L.B.C. that's where she gon' be

[Hook: K-Young and Crooked I]

Back to the L.B.C, (Oh-ohh)

If your down to ride for me
Back to the L.B.C
Back to the L.B.C, follow me, uh
Back to the L.B.C
Back to the L.B.C

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
You make me want to leave the one I'm with
And start a new relationship, with you (Real talk)
I think you outta leave that dude you with
And come holler at me for a minute or two (Boss up baby)
What's your number, bustas wonder how I rock ice like I done usher numbers (Hey!)
They undercover, hating on a number one stunna, but they can't keep a hustler under (K!)

[K-Young:]
Every other city I go to, I got a thick pretty chick that's ready to roll through
Spit a little game, get in they brain, my boy Crooked the boss we treat them the same

[End of verse: Crooked I]
Females be givin' us TLC, we sell keys is what freaks tell me
Baby I get big dollars each LP, that's how I push the broad bitch through each LB

[Hook: K-Young, Crooked I, and Dr. Dre]

[Bridge: Crooked I]
When you see us in the club it's gangstas in this party
We gon' sip that 'yac, that Patron, that Crystal and that Bicardi
Shorties on the dance floor I love when them girls get naughty
Guarantee before it's over we're leaving here with somebody

[Hook: K-Young, Crooked I, and Dr. Dre][Verse 1: Crooked I]
What do you do if you a rebel
When the whole world around you ain't thinking on your level
Like a stone to a pebble I'm looking at my bezel
I ain't got time to verbally wrestle with you devils
Talking shit and freeze my mind
Till I become a walking stick to lead the blind, yeah
Do you believe my grind?
I spit polished, that's the reason I perceive to shine
Should've knew from "Session One" leave them guys alone
Feel my work is never done, my life's a song
Even though I kept a gun I knew right from wrong
I got wisdom like Reverend Run, I could wise your dome
I put on for my city, got my hood on smash
Riding through Long Beach, foot on gas
TMZ with the pistols, looking for guns to put on blast
Leave me alone and they staying in my good old stash
The hood mess with my scruples
I looked death in the face so closely I saw myself in his pupils
Everybody got a coffin they gone get in time
I'm walking, not running trying to get in mine
My young homies, they'll thug with a cause
My old homies living life behind government walls
Fell victim to Republican laws
Barbara Boxer, Arnold Schwarzenegger, naw I ain't fucking with y'all
The conspiracy theorist that y'all say I be
Thinking a free clinic giving out H-I-V, ugh
Murder the ghetto with A-I-D-S
Preach to the choir, may I please? Chuch
I know you lyric critics wanna give me hell
Just to harming them flow going deeper than any well
Thinking optimistic, 2013 Coupe on reserve
My ward ain't ending in 2012
I'm the best, hating on me's what you better do
Have to talk behind my back cause I'm ahead of you
Hip Hop Weekly new beat killing 'em
Trying to be a synonym to Kool G
And ill as Eminem with the loose leaf
Crazy as Kool Keith, giving them groupies a two drink minimum
When they suck me off, they be working so hard
Like an employee I must be boss, ugh
My little nigga Manny 15 keep a M16
Love to hear that bitch scream
I can tell him to kill you if I wanted to
But why would I tell him to do something I wanna do

Turn on the TV, rappers all sagging
Tell you ain't never had shit, how y'all bragging? Yeah
Nigga 44 Magnum, point it at you industry niggas who false flagging
You false flagging homie, you false flagging
You false flagging homie, you false flagging
You ain't a Crip, Piru or a Blood
And I hope some real bangers kill you, nigga what?[Intro]
So what's the moral to the million dollar story?
It ain't about money. It's more about making something out of nothing. And if you can draw inspiration of that. That shit million dollars. Shit! That's even more than a million dollars

[Hook]
(Still led a thug life
I'm still an outlaw
Me and God cool
While you prayin' on my downfall (X3))
Did the shit without y'all
Come to your crib
Give your shots and draw blood
Like a doctor making house calls

[Verse]
Boss, boss, boss, bitch
Every cross frost bit
Ross bit, every bar sit ,this is dog shit
In your yard bitch
This is so disrespectful
Bitches know 'bout the gliss and glow
This a neck for Loop a time Lotus
Do it large, pulling up at the nudy bars
In stupid cars, and supercharge Rovers
We superstar Novas, we shinin'
We super ballin' do it all over
We grinding, Who are y'all?
We're the ones who get the harsh words from critics
See my mind might forgive it
But my heart won't forget it man
I'm hard work committed, my lyrics paint pictures
And my artwork is vivid
Just a hard working nigga
See I'm the ace, I'mma take your man's place
Jack a king for his queen then it's the house rules
In the 90's it was cut off khakis and house shoes
Now it's panamera Porches
With the panoramic view
Down Atlantic avenue
That's Long Beach nigga
Home of the LBC crew
Dynamics and dog pound
If you say you COB
That bitch pulling her drawers down
A wet clit with a piercing
My bitch pussy rock a five carat earring
Dive in to that crotch quick
Treat it like a motherfucking
Slaughterhouse, mosh pit
In this pacific division
I got an eye future, don't make the guy shoot you
That's when your karma screw you
I call karma sutra, I beg your pardon screw ya
Ye I'm brongo brol go west into and
Make you pussy strict man
I Uncle Luke you
My crew too live for you motherfuckers
We independent July 4th you motherfuckers
Crooked got the word play of a Lupe Fiasco
And the gun play, will souffle, your toupee, you assholes!
It's a new day, look at my life path
Even though it's melamine in my pigment
I grew up living equivalent to white trash
Why ask, the reason I buy jags
Without blinking the eyelash at the price tags
My past is so fucked up, it's quite sad
But I went from homeless to property on the white sand
Pussy, pot, and promethazine I sold every drug
While you sucked a dick of a petty thug
You ain't ready love
Crooked's part of the spaghetti club
He's giving bitches meat and balls
He's everything he said he was
Chrome 38 45 9's a metamorphosise my grind
This is organized crime
All I see is COB it's like I'm borderline blind
And I'll die for it now
Since we was born to die fine
No nuts, no glory
Until they close the book on my million dollar story

[Hook]

[Outro: Tena Jones]
Still led the thug life
I'm still an outlaw
Still led the thug life
I'm still an outlaw[Intro]
What's up Hip Hop?
It's ya boy, Crooked I
Iâ€™ve just been like
Iâ€™ve been thinking about this music shit
A whole lot
All this fake-ass niggas man
They always talk about the money, cars and clothes
But they will never talk about you know being broke
If he was born rich how you so hood nigga? you ain't hood nigga
Fake ass mothafucka
In None We Trust EP â€“ The Prelude December 13
Y'all know what it is hah, C.O.B. nigga
Yo, shouts out to Mack Maine from YMCMB
Hell niggas down and live in Miami

[Verse 1]
Iâ€™m off that match box 20, I need to hit the jackpot
Iâ€™m broke so Iâ€™m low enough to black block semi
Taking back shots of Henny, cause thatâ€™s my remedy
Iâ€™m wondering how much money we robbing a crack spot give me
If they only [?] and cues, kicking the door and they start squeezing tools
Next time youâ€™ll see me on TV will be the news
Rapper found slain for the past people choose
Mom seem to blues and nobody wouldnâ€™t give a fuck
Excess wait for the word to nip and tuck
Man I start thinking crazy when Iâ€™m the rut
I know I come from seamen and Iâ€™m still a nut
Welcome to the inferno, when a gun start touching you kids like Sandusky
Look the other way like Paterno
Ainâ€™t writing rhymes but Iâ€™m writing in my journal
Letters to god but I donâ€™t know if he concern them
They say hell waiting on the sinner
All my life feel like Satan hating on a nigga
No paddle travel up a defecating river
Shits creek, shitâ€™s weak, ..praying on my level
Tracking the vicious cycle, this is life
But my life is my biggest rival
Shit is try but I canâ€™t pick a different life
So grip a mic, tell you what go a nigga psycho
Tell the world, it ainâ€™t nothing you can do with me
I call you no class-ass niggas truancy
I came out of ugly situations beautifully
I built a house out of bricks, haters through with me
Iâ€™m from the beach city bitch

[Hook]
Beach-Beach City bitch, Beach City bitch
Beach-Beach City bitch, Beach City bitch
Beach-Beach City bitch, Beach City bitch
Beach-Beach City bitch, Beach City bitch

[Bridge]
Now work the pole
Strip to some real shit, you shoe model
Ya naked, modelling shoes
Got that one from my nigga, Jazzy [?]
BITCH! Sssutt Sssutt and all that
Ok, bye!

[Hook]
