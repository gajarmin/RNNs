[Verse 1]
She say she really loves me, but I know that she don't
That's what she told her nigga, with kids in her throat
She stays chasing ballers, cold shoulder if you broke
But if you make a pussy payment, you could be the next joke
Niggas steady laughing at you, bitches steady laughing at you
Got your mama even laughing at you, better stay away from the chapel
No magic needed for a trick, how you gonna' kiss a nigga dick
Don't be blind to the real, cause' in time, true colors will reveal

[Hook]
True colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Talking bout true colors!
True colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
True Colors (Colors!)

[Verse 2]
You actin' like you gangsta, but I know that you not
Cause' you ran for your life, when your homie got rocked
Your pockets on swole, huh, but you always borrow clothes
Living with your mama, almost thirty years old
Buster ass niggas always looking for you, po-po always looking for you
Your mama even looking for you
You got curfew when it's time to clean your room
Boy, now tell me what's going to happen when all the front street talk
Leads to some action, best friend will probably be nine-one-one
We know you wear heels, true colors get revealed

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If you see a fake nigga, point 'em out, point 'em out
Point 'em out, point 'em out, point 'em out, point 'em out
You see a fake bitch, point her out, point her out
Point her out, point her out, point her out, point her out

[Verse 3]
(Uh) One hundred how I keep it, and you should do the same (One!)
The same way I leave, is damn near the same way I came
Real does recognize it, not to be cliche
Your motive, can never be revealed
Cause in due time, true colors get revealed

[Shortened Hook]
True colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Talkin' bout true colors!
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Is that really you?"Hi, hahahahaha, the first thing I have to tell you is this
This city was made from the original music
It is not a counterfeit, this is the real one
This one is true, this one is real"

[Phil the Agony]
Yeah, William Cosby sweaters
There's only one thing better than cheddar
If life is a puzzle, I put it together
I'm like DMC, my Run Tougher Than Leather
I come from an era of golf hats
Ball caps, pimp hats with feathers
Plaid slacks with the button-up jackets to match
I blast at any knucklehead fucking with rap
I got to chuckle at that, rap black belt
Motherfucker but the buckle is back
Pro-rap, what you wanna do? Nothing with that
You suck like a ho on figaro and you wack
Niggas know it and they talk to your back
Behind closed doors and get a good laugh
Like that factory that niggas in rap
Your name ain't Seinfield if you black
My clientele sell more than the crack that Reagan let in
Fuck your Meagan Good friend at the Holiday Inn
She look like her twin

[Hook: Phonte]
One thing's for certain, two things for sure
No where to work and, no way to grow
A crazy place, we all praying for the best of times
Ohh yeah, yea-yeah-eaah

[Krondon]
My mind is like a piecebook
I can't get no peace wherever I look
My own worst enemy, even the evil get shook
For the violence, the fans turn finicky
Silly of me to think that I
Could untie that ribbon in the sky
Senior citizens in line
The end sure isn't as pure to require that same sugar high
Rely on religion if your heart's missing
It won't work, certain it's all written
Emerge, make 'em all listen
Some rehearse them devilish words and put the hurt in 'em
I mean put the hurting on 'em, with or without warning
Been a whole year, shed a tear for him
A year since I heard from him
I don't care, I know where I'm going

[Hook]

[Phonte]
Yo, everybody got the blues and it's evident
Got workers losing they jobs and they residence
And overseas niggas filing out
Straight wilding out, tossing they shoes at the president
It make me think about the loot that I shell out
If times get tight will the show still sell out?
Po' folk need help, they call it welfare
When rich folk need it, then y'all call it a bail out
It make me wanna yell out, but I just chill
Because the love for my fam is priceless
Long as I got them we'll be able to fight this
Cause nigga I'm black, I was born in a financial crisis, shit!
So no eulogies, and no two-to-threes
I'll survive cause being broke ain't new to me
New opportunities and ways to grind
Respect your mind and celebrate the best of times
Now let's ride

[Hook]

[Phonte] - {repeat to end}
Good times, good timesYeah, Stong Arm Steady
One gang, four guns, how the West was won, let's go

[Hook: Xzibit]
Jump if you really want it (jump)
You'll catch one in yo' stomach (yeah!)

But my dogs ain't only barkin (woof!)
Y'all better bewaaaaaaare of us

[Hook]

[S.A.S. - Krondon]
I'm eatin chicken wings, mm, it's like chicken feed
Mm, I'm at the feedhouse smokin all this chicken's weed
Huh, you're hardly hard, this sucker's soft as volleyball
Cold Chillin' like my name was +Big Daddy+ +Marley Marl+
You're not a star at all, no, you're just a sidekick, yeh
Runnin the outside lickin shit and ridin dicks
Real niggas start cliques, start shit we spark clips
The mac'll make your door lift and leave me with a sore wrist
You should be impressed, yeh, it's like my first impression
I pull representer, exposition in a session
I'm in the Expedition, expose a dark dimension
Your girl used to suck dick du-ring detention
You got dumped, she came up by spittin
Out nuts of every homey comin home from prison
Yeah the fake chicks get dick the Ferragamo fake fits
I keep they drawers drenched, no drawers, fake tits

[Hook]

[S.A.S. - Phil Da Agony]
This the last call, total recall, my pimpin flowin like Niagara Falls
So you can Phil Da Agony y'all
Yeah you get beat to the punch, rap monsters eat you for lunch
And feed you to the beat that you want
Fear keep knockin fake fans sent to no one
Fuck them niggas run from me I don't owe 'em
Why do things for free, you don't know 'em
These niggas'll load up the heat, they don't throw 'em
Hooks stay floatin in my mind, I design 'em like
Architects workin online, I'm on the incline
Lamp like the heavyweight champ, it took 3 months of trainin
While it's rainin take your brain through boot camp
Fair facts, Nike Air Max, I'm back blunted
Yeah that them niggas hear that and don't want it
Triple trick niggas get sick to they stomach
Strong Arm Steady ready act like you want it - BITCH!

[Hook]

[Xzibit]
Every day above ground is a good day
My wordplay only contain what the hood say
Clack the black off a nigga make him see the light
My overhand right'll violate your civil rights
We get bars, big cars, cigars
12 gauge salute to your face to face God
Icon, marathon mack, where the bitches at?
Raise it back, steady game, came with a gang of gats
I hit your pressure points, we jack the motherlode
Expose your motives like a CSI episode
Output maximum level, dig deep down in the dirt
With diligence and dance with the devil, yeah
Cause you don't know me homey, I keep the banger on me
It wasn't my aim, it came with the territory
Feet planted firm in the turf, plant you six feet deep in the earth
Gettin slumped while the ammo dump, fucker

[Hook]

Bewaaaaaaare of us {*BLAM*}[Hook: Mitchy Slick]
No talkin don't pay the rent
And sittin won't let you style like this
But money don't make you rich
But hatin won't let you smile

[Phil Da Agony]
Yeah, the Teknology is too advanced
Attach dynomite to opportunity, blow your chance
Enhance the vision, Kweli tell 'em to listen
Before I probably get a hundred niggas to diss 'em
Yeah, and I can't wait, sit up straight
Hungry niggas eatin your plate, compete in a race
Full of rats, the homie's torso is full of tats
I'mma put the rest on my back, it's best if I, bless 'em with that
Specify the facts from the fiction
I gotta draw the line with the diction
And I ain't whistlin, Dixie; this is Hi-Teknology wit me
You couldn't find a finer designer to tailor fit me
To be, yay a nigga Tone, Cincinnati's own
Hometown favorite like the Bearcats win the zone
Strong Arm keep it runnin on like a sentence
They wouldn't know the difference when I hit 'em from a distance

[Hook]

[Mitchy Slick]
Clack, conventional (bullshit) nothin identical
The West has evolved and Steady's, at the pinnacle (yeah dat)
Still saggin in my crispy Dickies
But my gangsta's fly, I make sho' the wrist is extra crystal-y
Cock it on the side for the next telly is
Ghetto nigga on Lambo's mailin list
Money don't make you rich
But it's funny how it'll make a snow bunny suck your dick
I have a hater in the shrubs where you park your shit
I had a homie blowin you up when he hit the fence
To the Steady, Slick bring the gangsta shit
Like the hankerchief, once you add on the Paisley print
On the rights where I dang a lick
But since I learned red and blue make green it's Tek hits

[Hook]

[Krondon]
It's the premier kids cast to build the pyramids
A '08 Escalade's in prepaid appearances
It's hard to even entertain a few, an invalid
Lame in the brain can't talk or remember shit
I don't blame him - the daddy ain't around
Left him lonely in the hood without good home trainin
Frustrated, pissed cause probation
Got him pissin in a cup without proper occupation
So they - get up, get out, and get it like Goodie Mob
Niggas must be crazy thinkin we won't do the job
Dookie colored droptops sob, with the feet tall
Hi-Tek beats bump from Lynn Street to Crenshaw
Steady means stupid stand up, start elevatin
Violate and come to your final destination
Mouth{?} pacin - Pacific Ocean main land
Chasin retail, re-up in rotation

[Hook] - 2X[Xzibit]
Strong Arm Steady, we ready, it's time to ball out
When vocal chords spit cold shit they never thaw out
Industry tried to pigeonhole, I had to crawl out
Hear my name bein called out, nuclear fallout
Full body armor with bangers, we goin all out
Garbage bags in trunk of the car, it won't stall out
Hit you where you stay, hogtied, you gettin hauled out
Crush the whole car, it's well planned and thought out
Try to attain fame from beef, you went the wrong route
Scrape a 38 on your teeth, I knock 'em all out
I know you ain't fuckin with me dawg (c'mon NOW)
Underestimate, run up on, it's on now
Have your niggas plottin revenge and puttin songs out
Demise by design, blueprints is drawn out
Flood crack back in the hood, it's been a long drought
Show you what this gangster killa Cali is all about

[Hook]
KLACK - for the niggas that bang in the inner city and
KLACK - for the enemies creepin to come and get me
Be thankful, if you get away alive
You wouldn't kill or won't let nothin die, so keep it movin
(Repeat x2)

[Xzibit]
Yo! You don't like how I'm livin well fuck you
Nastradamus style, make every line come true
Don't make me spit predict your last action
Last man standin (yeah) last man laughin (yeah)
Assassin, crosshairs, smile for the birdie (CLICK!)
Hit you long range, high powered, 30-30 shit
If you never heard of a heavy assault rifle
Hit targets a mile away from the top of the Eiffel (woo!)
Knock the soul out of your body, stay plottin like Bin Laden
To swoop down and crash your party
All bark no bite (SHIIIT!) we don't bark nigga
We bite to the white then shake 'til the afterlife
Hard work and sacrifice, who's your daddy?
Make you wanna drop e'rything and move to Cali
We classic, go 'head, speak my name
And I'mma lay your ass down like the All Star game, c'mon

[Hook]

[Krondon]
Sawed-off shotgun, shoot through your shoulderblade
Bitch-made niggas get, hit with a hand grenade
Blow up your Escalade, then I hit the road
And I'm back in the hood lookin for somethin to smoke
Everytime, I use the element of surprise
With a gun that's big enough to make an elephant hide
I elevate my rhythm by hustlin crack addicts
Get locked but, when I'm released I'm back at it
See, Mitch know the time, in front of me the birdie and
Phil got the customers comin to get it early we
Came a long way from po-lice chasin us
For dope in our socks and angel dust
Yeah klack for the strippers in clubs shakin they titties
This, mac'll have you bitch niggas runnin like P. Diddy
I'll bang you, comin out the side of your mouth
We the reason why you stay in the house, Stizzle, Gang

[Hook]First Verse [Krondon of Strong Arm Steady]

Recognize realize and visualize
This miracle mind which is mine
Son of a chainsmoker and crack pusher
My family ties lines of cane cookers
From the slums to the streets, the suites of South Beach
The belt's not far in my reach, rather unique
Yeah my physique comes naturally, and actually
Had a way with words since '83
Maybe it's me, or maybe it's the surgery performed when I speak over beats
It's a emergency, yeah the young boy got his head bust
Nowadays the gun talk, fuck going head-up
I get fed up and furious
But get relief from relief I receive from the Jewish chick
She stupid rich, buy me boucoup gifts
Like matzah bread, on some bar mitzvah shit
I admit the gang mentality I represent
Serves as a reality check for the intelligent
Some real nigga shit, come follow it

Second Verse [Phil da Agony of Strong Arm Steady]

Living in a mansion flossed out
Chillin at the boss house
Dont fuck around and get tossed out
Like Jazzy Jeff outta Fresh house
Niggas wanna press play, hey we the best out
Niggas always leave the west out
Actin like I can't buy a house out in down south
Or somewhere on the east coast
Get a grill smile on my mouth like cheese toast
Who the fuck gon' beast most
Set it up like oscar de la hoya out in East Slopes (?)
Or somewhere on the west side
Where the best born, best die, Bedstuy
Brooklyn, Canada back to the USA
Black hats like NWA
Black gats bringing trouble your way
You know the strong arm steady don't play
I shift crack like pounds of the yay
Smoke weed like I'm from the bay
Still the most dangerous group coming outta CA
It's the strong arm steady
Battle Axe Records y'all, y'all not ready, let's go

Third Verse [Mad Child of Swollen Members]

We ride like violent horses
I leave a pile of corpses
Warlock inside my fortress
I lost a fucking fortune
Yeah, visionary verse developer
Celebrate? I get enough pills to kill a elephant
And that's relevant
I'm hiding in a dark tent
Pyromaniacs tongue-kissing on a park bench
Utterly I mutter manslaughter with the meat cleaver
Please believe it I breathe heat with deep reverb
Dogtown, Z Boys, Rocksteady b-boys
Redline Levis, plans being revised
Quite tired, I bite tires, a white liar
A drive-byer with five priors, a livewire
Ey, I am some kinda hybrid
Dopest rapper out, but I'm white like rye bread
I'll get a mohawk, go hard like Clubber Lang
You in trouble mang, like a vampire with rubber fangs
It's time to get some retribution
Forget a fucking trial we go straight to execution

Fourth Verse [Opio of Hieroglyphics/Souls of Mischief]

Yeah, like you was gambling with the chief head honcho
Not Gandolfini or Tonto
We rock like Weather Report at the Montreax
Casino Jazz Festival caught in different time zones
We know like conventional thought, the triple line though
They infinitesimaly small next to Hiero
Adam to a ant, a wooden match to a canon that I had
When they ran into my pad. Grabbed it from my dad
He said "Respect the power that it wields
Cause a coward will reveal hisself
Strength and character should supersede wealth
And keep your mind clear, you won't squeal for help."
I'm out for delph preservation
The elder statesman
Cracking all chastity belts with innovation
Fuck 'em deep, non-virginal
Terminally ill, personally kill mics
Bust the verbal voodoo hex
Murdering sets like the Colonel
Flew out the cuckoo's nest with two new Teks
Check-nine-milli, I'm really bout my scrilli
I'm droppin these club bombs til they give me mine, what

Fifth Verse [A-Plus of Swollen Members & Hieroglyphics]

It go, Me broke in this economy? Hell no
Even the recession ain't affecting them elbows
So we sell those. People be cheefing when they struggle
I'm a beast when I hustle but I keep it on the humble
Try to lay a finger on me, your people are in trouble
I got Usalama(?), my peeps'll be there on the double
Bipolar so I could flip it any time
And I don't waste time spending my chips on any dime, I'm
From Oakland, it's cold there, maybe you known, player
Baby could leave at any moment and I won't hate 'er
I'm warm though, and I won't scorn those
I know she's coming back like '70s pornos
So I tag graffiti on her lower back tat
Kick back, relax up at the cul de sac flat
These rappers is eunuchs, they acting, they cooning (?)
My reaction after I slap 'em, they ruined, had to do it, yeah yeah...[Intro]
Them say no, and you come
That’s why you kill da king
King that he will fade away
But refresh everyday man
Now when it come to sum bizness
Its we that run the scene
Cause we fresh and green, come

[Ab-Soul]
Yeah, graveyard shift, meet the grim reaper
Sickle to your features, balance that like a Libra
Scale yeah I’m off that
Derailing all your thoughts on this track
All this wax I should make a candle fac-tory better
Glory all facts his-tory in the making, I am that
(Chea,Chea,Chea,Chea)
Victory is sweet enough to eat, bon appetite
Pull up a chair and eat
You buffoons couldn't walk in my shoes
If we were sharing feet

[Krondon]
Mind too cool, dominion can’t compare they just some glarin geeks
In real life, perpetrate like mike only a pair of sneaks
Level 3, skeeter tried to squack I didn't care to speak
Burgundy, polo went public I can’t prepare to teach
Smoking like Santonio Holmes
When the camera go flash, I get the feeling at home
Under the avalanche
Guess that’s how ghetto survival, syndrome fuck the system
A nigga woke up to get on screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh,(yo,yo,yo) ah, yeah, yeah, let me get my shit off
Dome piece a nigga his shit was gonna before I slid off
Yeah, yeah, let me get my shit off
Grab me a bag of work now watch how fast that fucker get off
Yeah, have the money flipping in oz, go get up
Throw somethin hot in yo oven dawgs
Nigga, we motherfucking bout it bout it
Get rowdy, rowdy, I’m a ghetto dog
Go head inside it

[Phil da Agony]
Yo, my niggas cry freedom like Nelson Mandela
Played by Morgan Freeman
I be walking with the giants like the G men
Hit the pussy like semen
Hood angels I be fighting demons I’m excited
At the chance just to get even
So I play the odds, pray to god
Poker face chips like I’m playing cards
My chick like Felicia Rashad in the face
Hale Berry waist with the grace of sade
I take her out just to party, everybody say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Mitchy Slick]
Understood by those that blossom by MLK
Cocooned in a one bedroom, interjects, all in yay
Brainstorm philosophies on getting k’s and getting away
On gang injunction with the jail for nathen yesterday
Fuck the swines all they want is a cheaper nigga broke
Contradicting tycoons and the candy crips and cigarette
Porky gotta eat his heart When he see my super sport
What they done to my folks
I charge it to her pink toes

[Jay Rock]
They done fucked up and let this watts nigga get on
It’s my time to eat so I’m bout to get my grill on
George former ho, storm on the flow
Steady getting fetti, either rap guns will blow
Step inside this bitch they looking like wanna go toe to toe
These hands like pitbulls and now I let these fuckers go
So I think you need to let them motherfuckers know
These choppers leave they fucking heads spinning like some stop and go’s
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Bewaaaaaaare of us {*BLAM*}(And a 6-pack of Pepsi Cola that always go good with the chitlins, baby)

[Phil Da Agony]
Shit...
But I ain't fucking with them chitlins
The most I'm a do is chicken, bad food'll have your breath kicking
Try a diet like Russell Simmons
Dating vegetarian vegan women drinking water with lemons
Low sodium salt, no pork on your fork
After meals you take a long walk
And stay away from the ballpark franks, you pulling all that rank
At Whole Foods putting fuel in your tank
That's more muscle for the machine
Brussel sprouts, broccoli and string beans
You get your choice of three greens plus a starch to go with it
Committed to the gym keeping your waistline trim
That put a grin all over my face, when you walk in the place
We had ketchup on Sunset, tomato paste
Chicago Summertime at the taste, no time to waste
We don't waste food on our plate, let the haters hate
Twelve-ounce steak, asparagus tips delicious, got me licking my lips
On some LL Cool J shit
No rib-tips, we take tips from the best chefs like Raekwon
Now pass the Grey Poupon, no MSG, no butter on my popcorn
This ain't a pop song, tell 'em

[Planet Asia]
These type of women I sees often, the Trader Joe
All natural juice drinking breezes be at the flea market
Berkeley Bowl, free range chicken and rosemary
Avocado California Rolls fresh jalopy
Yoga girl part agave
Green salad pita supporter, vegan au gratin
High on the calcium, cashews, callaloo and curry
Raw veggies, one hundred percent alkaline
Backrubs while I smoke my berries
You and your chick at Mickey D's ordering Frost McFlurrys
And one thing's for sure you got that (good thing)
That's why I got you pregnant cause your pussy was fertile
I can give it to you tough or take it slow like turtles
So soulful my tofu Whole Foods girl
Butternut squash, maple syrup, semi-succulent
You the one I'm fucking with
My organic supplement, always something healthy in the tupperware
I'm eating from the ground as long as we have an atmosphere
Day to day business, water, lime, maple syrup
Cayenne pepper fast, a ten-day cleansing
And if you eat swine that might fuck up our friendship
You know the God gotta have a Queen in the kitchen

[Krondon]
Missus microwave three day refrigerated meat loaf, tastes homemade
Daily grill diner, potato parmesan and no lactose
Doze in the massage chair reclining
Thousand Island ruffage, turkey stuffing with brown biscuits
Blonde Barbie dolls call 'em muffins
My honey loves mustard, chicken sub Quiznos munching
Veggie dog sauteed onions
Mouth full of Funyuns on the ferris wheel turning
Having so much fun, tummy burning
Hard, a masala make a hungry man follow ya
Right off the edge of the terrace, asparagus marriage
Bad vision fill my belly up with carrots, malnutrition
Cupcake cholesterol, lifting weights
In between the mocha milkshakes and the succulent Salisbury Steak, wait
She got a porcelain plate, cornish and crab cornbread, kosher
Feeling my foreskin, this Corsican's horse butt girlfriend
Gets full of forcing it in
In the end she skips din goes straight to dessert
And tries to feed me what's under that skirt
I leave screaming[Verse 1]
She say she really loves me, but I know that she don't
That's what she told her nigga, with kids in her throat
She stays chasing ballers, cold shoulder if you broke
But if you make a pussy payment, you could be the next joke
Niggas steady laughing at you, bitches steady laughing at you
Got your mama even laughing at you, better stay away from the chapel
No magic needed for a trick, how you gonna' kiss a nigga dick
Don't be blind to the real, cause' in time, true colors will reveal

[Hook]
True colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Talking bout true colors!
True colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
True Colors (Colors!)

[Verse 2]
You actin' like you gangsta, but I know that you not
Cause' you ran for your life, when your homie got rocked
Your pockets on swole, huh, but you always borrow clothes
Living with your mama, almost thirty years old
Buster ass niggas always looking for you, po-po always looking for you
Your mama even looking for you
You got curfew when it's time to clean your room
Boy, now tell me what's going to happen when all the front street talk
Leads to some action, best friend will probably be nine-one-one
We know you wear heels, true colors get revealed

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If you see a fake nigga, point 'em out, point 'em out
Point 'em out, point 'em out, point 'em out, point 'em out
You see a fake bitch, point her out, point her out
Point her out, point her out, point her out, point her out

[Verse 3]
(Uh) One hundred how I keep it, and you should do the same (One!)
The same way I leave, is damn near the same way I came
Real does recognize it, not to be cliche
Your motive, can never be revealed
Cause in due time, true colors get revealed

[Shortened Hook]
True colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Talkin' bout true colors!
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Colors (Colors!)
Is that really you?[Hook]
Dead men tell no stories, liars can’t live in the street
Whatever plans God has for me, I’ll cooperate instead of compete
We coming for ‘em nigga, (Yeah!)
Ain’t no looking back (Yeah)
Forward motion nigga
Just remember that
We gon’ get ‘em, get ‘em, we gon’ hit ‘em, hit ‘em. (No...No...No)
We gon’ get ‘em get ‘em, we gon’ hit ‘em, hit ‘em

[Evidence]
(It’s that CA all day...)
Evidence, Taylor Made, it’s custom
I heard if they smile too much don’t trust ‘em
I heard the phone’s no place for discussion
Just heard a click, either I’m bugged or bugging. (Look out!)
Some call it living in fear
Believe most of what you see, some of what you hear
Don’t believe in ghosts?
The Lost Angel’s here
Don’t think your friends will set you up?
It’s your year - it’s going down
And when it does, shed no tears
Sleep with both eyes open, and one of my ears
Ready, always scoping one of my peers
I can sense the fake energy behind your cheers
I can slow the flow down, just to make it clear
Shift my gears, my enemies close in line
If you can’t trust none of your crew, how you supposed to climb
I guess keep your guard up, they fade out in due time

[Hook]

[Mitchy Slick]
Why when a nigga from the West where Dickies it’s too bangin
But when out-of-towners do it, it’s a fashion statement (Fuck that!)
Why most DJs out here say they support the West
Bump us on Hump Day, but chump us out the rest
How to blow under those conditions?
I’m only known where the project chicks is living
Where the Ninety-Six Caprice’s on the spinners is driven
When Slick spitting better know the hitmen is listening
That’s who I kick it for - not the radio
My niggas is stuck with California Level Fours
To use hip-hop to motivate in other days
With the urban survival even if it causes decay
Stretching yay, having to put a bitch they kinda like, out on the blade
Steady Gang feel the killers and the dealers pain
Some of us still got hard flame for slang

[Hook]

[Rakaa]
(We gon’ get ‘em...)
Watch you colors homie, watch your slang
Watch how you make your fingers twist and change
A lot of brothers out here still ain’t playing
A lot of blocks out here still gang bang
Dilated wrong kind, SD to LA
To the Bay, gotta say ‘Rest in Peace’ to Mac Dre (R.I.P!)
Boyz in the Hood shit, Menance to Society flow
Now the beats bang like Colors on your radio
Crazy since the Eighties, now Kobe’s dropping eighty-one
On these rap tours, nightclubs to the stadium
Sick Angelino squad, savage ammunition strike
Strong Arm Steady Gang, sedatives and stimuli
Back with a bong, man we just killed a quarter
I’m a DJ advocate, toasting firewater
With Krondon and Phil Da Agony chopping up the orders
Moving big work with Mitchy Slick, down by the border

[Outro - Mitchy Slick]
Yeah...nigga, Strong Arm Steady, nigga
Yeah, West Coast is cracking, don’t get it fucked up
And Dilated, don’t get them fucked up neither, yeah datFirst Verse [Krondon of Strong Arm Steady]

Recognize realize and visualize
This miracle mind which is mine
Son of a chainsmoker and crack pusher
My family ties lines of cane cookers
From the slums to the streets, the suites of South Beach
The belt's not far in my reach, rather unique
Yeah my physique comes naturally, and actually
Had a way with words since '83
Maybe it's me, or maybe it's the surgery performed when I speak over beats
It's a emergency, yeah the young boy got his head bust
Nowadays the gun talk, fuck going head-up
I get fed up and furious
But get relief from relief I receive from the Jewish chick
She stupid rich, buy me boucoup gifts
Like matzah bread, on some bar mitzvah shit
I admit the gang mentality I represent
Serves as a reality check for the intelligent
Some real nigga shit, come follow it

Second Verse [Phil da Agony of Strong Arm Steady]

Living in a mansion flossed out
Chillin at the boss house
Dont fuck around and get tossed out
Like Jazzy Jeff outta Fresh house
Niggas wanna press play, hey we the best out
Niggas always leave the west out
Actin like I can't buy a house out in down south
Or somewhere on the east coast
Get a grill smile on my mouth like cheese toast
Who the fuck gon' beast most
Set it up like oscar de la hoya out in East Slopes (?)
Or somewhere on the west side
Where the best born, best die, Bedstuy
Brooklyn, Canada back to the USA
Black hats like NWA
Black gats bringing trouble your way
You know the strong arm steady don't play
I shift crack like pounds of the yay
Smoke weed like I'm from the bay
Still the most dangerous group coming outta CA
It's the strong arm steady
Battle Axe Records y'all, y'all not ready, let's go

Third Verse [Mad Child of Swollen Members]

We ride like violent horses
I leave a pile of corpses
Warlock inside my fortress
I lost a fucking fortune
Yeah, visionary verse developer
Celebrate? I get enough pills to kill a elephant
And that's relevant
I'm hiding in a dark tent
Pyromaniacs tongue-kissing on a park bench
Utterly I mutter manslaughter with the meat cleaver
Please believe it I breathe heat with deep reverb
Dogtown, Z Boys, Rocksteady b-boys
Redline Levis, plans being revised
Quite tired, I bite tires, a white liar
A drive-byer with five priors, a livewire
Ey, I am some kinda hybrid
Dopest rapper out, but I'm white like rye bread
I'll get a mohawk, go hard like Clubber Lang
You in trouble mang, like a vampire with rubber fangs
It's time to get some retribution
Forget a fucking trial we go straight to execution

Fourth Verse [Opio of Hieroglyphics/Souls of Mischief]

Yeah, like you was gambling with the chief head honcho
Not Gandolfini or Tonto
We rock like Weather Report at the Montreax
Casino Jazz Festival caught in different time zones
We know like conventional thought, the triple line though
They infinitesimaly small next to Hiero
Adam to a ant, a wooden match to a canon that I had
When they ran into my pad. Grabbed it from my dad
He said "Respect the power that it wields
Cause a coward will reveal hisself
Strength and character should supersede wealth
And keep your mind clear, you won't squeal for help."
I'm out for delph preservation
The elder statesman
Cracking all chastity belts with innovation
Fuck 'em deep, non-virginal
Terminally ill, personally kill mics
Bust the verbal voodoo hex
Murdering sets like the Colonel
Flew out the cuckoo's nest with two new Teks
Check-nine-milli, I'm really bout my scrilli
I'm droppin these club bombs til they give me mine, what

Fifth Verse [A-Plus of Swollen Members & Hieroglyphics]

It go, Me broke in this economy? Hell no
Even the recession ain't affecting them elbows
So we sell those. People be cheefing when they struggle
I'm a beast when I hustle but I keep it on the humble
Try to lay a finger on me, your people are in trouble
I got Usalama(?), my peeps'll be there on the double
Bipolar so I could flip it any time
And I don't waste time spending my chips on any dime, I'm
From Oakland, it's cold there, maybe you known, player
Baby could leave at any moment and I won't hate 'er
I'm warm though, and I won't scorn those
I know she's coming back like '70s pornos
So I tag graffiti on her lower back tat
Kick back, relax up at the cul de sac flat
These rappers is eunuchs, they acting, they cooning (?)
My reaction after I slap 'em, they ruined, had to do it, yeah yeah...[Intro]
Them say no, and you come
That’s why you kill da king
King that he will fade away
But refresh everyday man
Now when it come to sum bizness
Its we that run the scene
Cause we fresh and green, come

[Ab-Soul]
Yeah, graveyard shift, meet the grim reaper
Sickle to your features, balance that like a Libra
Scale yeah I’m off that
Derailing all your thoughts on this track
All this wax I should make a candle fac-tory better
Glory all facts his-tory in the making, I am that
(Chea,Chea,Chea,Chea)
Victory is sweet enough to eat, bon appetite
Pull up a chair and eat
You buffoons couldn't walk in my shoes
If we were sharing feet

[Krondon]
Mind too cool, dominion can’t compare they just some glarin geeks
In real life, perpetrate like mike only a pair of sneaks
Level 3, skeeter tried to squack I didn't care to speak
Burgundy, polo went public I can’t prepare to teach
Smoking like Santonio Holmes
When the camera go flash, I get the feeling at home
Under the avalanche
Guess that’s how ghetto survival, syndrome fuck the system
A nigga woke up to get on screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Schoolboy Q]
Uh,(yo,yo,yo) ah, yeah, yeah, let me get my shit off
Dome piece a nigga his shit was gonna before I slid off
Yeah, yeah, let me get my shit off
Grab me a bag of work now watch how fast that fucker get off
Yeah, have the money flipping in oz, go get up
Throw somethin hot in yo oven dawgs
Nigga, we motherfucking bout it bout it
Get rowdy, rowdy, I’m a ghetto dog
Go head inside it

[Phil da Agony]
Yo, my niggas cry freedom like Nelson Mandela
Played by Morgan Freeman
I be walking with the giants like the G men
Hit the pussy like semen
Hood angels I be fighting demons I’m excited
At the chance just to get even
So I play the odds, pray to god
Poker face chips like I’m playing cards
My chick like Felicia Rashad in the face
Hale Berry waist with the grace of sade
I take her out just to party, everybody say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Mitchy Slick]
Understood by those that blossom by MLK
Cocooned in a one bedroom, interjects, all in yay
Brainstorm philosophies on getting k’s and getting away
On gang injunction with the jail for nathen yesterday
Fuck the swines all they want is a cheaper nigga broke
Contradicting tycoons and the candy crips and cigarette
Porky gotta eat his heart When he see my super sport
What they done to my folks
I charge it to her pink toes

[Jay Rock]
They done fucked up and let this watts nigga get on
It’s my time to eat so I’m bout to get my grill on
George former ho, storm on the flow
Steady getting fetti, either rap guns will blow
Step inside this bitch they looking like wanna go toe to toe
These hands like pitbulls and now I let these fuckers go
So I think you need to let them motherfuckers know
These choppers leave they fucking heads spinning like some stop and go’s
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah[Talib Kweli]
In your eardrum so furious
It ain't a game, it ain't a joke, it's so serious
The best flow period, let's go!
(Klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack)
Yo, the year of the Blacksmith
It ain't defined by any calender
Just thought I'd remind all you challengers, uhh
(Klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack)
C'mon, Talib Kweli, Strong Arm Steady (Blacksmith)

Yeah, when I jump in the stu' with beautiful rap staff
You could bump in yo' hoopty, bump in yo' Cadillac
Blacksmith, S.A.S., real rap that
People just be seein the surface, they can't get past that
Phil Da Ag' smoke in your stash, Mitchy like klack-klack
Krondon got crack rap, I got your back back
Homie swing you better +duck+ like Aflac
Lames just, stay in your lane, the flow is HazMat

[Phil Da Agony]
Yeah, we back for the '07, say goodbye to this '06 shit
Yeah we here for the championship
And that's exactly what we came to get
You know the name of this, organization that made you famous
It's the Strong Arm, with the long arm to throw the bomb on
The drop of the dime; we at the top of the line
Plus we on the incline, the rhymes be finer than wine
Design them in the mind, they shine like diamonds
Fresh out the coal mine, young soul, old mind
I'ma hold mine, Steady spittin cold lines
Sharpen it up, backwoods sparkin it up
These niggas act like, what I rap like in the clutch
I mastered the dutch, Dizzle tell 'em to duck
Hitman for hire, Blacksmith put it up
Courtesy of Kweli, you got a problem with me
Phil Da Agony, Strong Arm Steady!

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
We 'bout to open up, we 'bout to sew it up
We so focused bruh, go on and throw it up
The joint is broken up, we 'bout to roll it up
We 'bout to smoke it up, that's why they wanna go with us
Who wanna go with us? She wanna go with us
She wanna go with us, they wana go with us
So let's gooo!

[Krondon]
From L.A. to B.K., Brooklyn that is
On the black hand side, Strong Arm Steady

[Mitchy Slick]
Blacksmith and we hear somethin
Next thing you know, we was on the road dime humpin
Earrings full of O'Shea's
Big ass chain all in the way like Ghostface
Of course all the hoes wanna go
Baby like Mitchy, hella ghetto but he heavy peddles Lambo's
And gettin snow cheap
Had a nigga out missin studio sessions, haulin from the police
But now I'm focused, and where my folks is
And when we together we mob like locusts
Crooks that hit licks that got crooks who work in big ass granny kitchens
That we use to cook chickens
And not the ones that's finger lickin
The ones that'll have a Cali nigga ticklin switches
My guns'll make a Northern Cali run
How you think the little homie got kush zips for four hun'?

[Chorus]

[Krondon]
Ay don't think we changed our style
We just got more change for our style
Strong Arm Steady!

Chronic, country as cornbread, this L.A. life could be
Funky as George Clinton's colorful dreads, prestigious
I'm bred from a different cloth
The walk and talk soft could cost your head
The difference you the minor we the major
No long life to be lived for the hater or the traitor
Eight out of nine of my niggas doin time for advancin
Handlin illegal finances
This the family reunion, mixed with the holy communion
You'll never win, you're too busy consumin
Kweli, let's start up a union
Protect the real niggas from the fakes so we ain't gotta do 'em
Yeah, this the church right across from the liquor sto'
Been on that hip-hop shit since Biz Mark' picked his nose
Under the mattress stack big as a fat chick
Steady is the gang and the label is Blacksmith, bitch!

[Chorus]

"Ohh!" [echoes][Xzibit]
Strong Arm Steady, we ready, it's time to ball out
When vocal chords spit cold shit they never thaw out
Industry tried to pigeonhole, I had to crawl out
Hear my name bein called out, nuclear fallout
Full body armor with bangers, we goin all out
Garbage bags in trunk of the car, it won't stall out
Hit you where you stay, hogtied, you gettin hauled out
Crush the whole car, it's well planned and thought out
Try to attain fame from beef, you went the wrong route
Scrape a 38 on your teeth, I knock 'em all out
I know you ain't fuckin with me dawg (c'mon NOW)
Underestimate, run up on, it's on now
Have your niggas plottin revenge and puttin songs out
Demise by design, blueprints is drawn out
Flood crack back in the hood, it's been a long drought
Show you what this gangster killa Cali is all about

[Hook]
KLACK - for the niggas that bang in the inner city and
KLACK - for the enemies creepin to come and get me
Be thankful, if you get away alive
You wouldn't kill or won't let nothin die, so keep it movin
(Repeat x2)

[Xzibit]
Yo! You don't like how I'm livin well fuck you
Nastradamus style, make every line come true
Don't make me spit predict your last action
Last man standin (yeah) last man laughin (yeah)
Assassin, crosshairs, smile for the birdie (CLICK!)
Hit you long range, high powered, 30-30 shit
If you never heard of a heavy assault rifle
Hit targets a mile away from the top of the Eiffel (woo!)
Knock the soul out of your body, stay plottin like Bin Laden
To swoop down and crash your party
All bark no bite (SHIIIT!) we don't bark nigga
We bite to the white then shake 'til the afterlife
Hard work and sacrifice, who's your daddy?
Make you wanna drop e'rything and move to Cali
We classic, go 'head, speak my name
And I'mma lay your ass down like the All Star game, c'mon

[Hook]

[Krondon]
Sawed-off shotgun, shoot through your shoulderblade
Bitch-made niggas get, hit with a hand grenade
Blow up your Escalade, then I hit the road
And I'm back in the hood lookin for somethin to smoke
Everytime, I use the element of surprise
With a gun that's big enough to make an elephant hide
I elevate my rhythm by hustlin crack addicts
Get locked but, when I'm released I'm back at it
See, Mitch know the time, in front of me the birdie and
Phil got the customers comin to get it early we
Came a long way from po-lice chasin us
For dope in our socks and angel dust
Yeah klack for the strippers in clubs shakin they titties
This, mac'll have you bitch niggas runnin like P. Diddy
I'll bang you, comin out the side of your mouth
We the reason why you stay in the house, Stizzle, Gang

[Hook][Hook]
Downtown from the hood
(Better) klack or get klacked on, (either) klack or get klacked on, (better) klack or get klacked on, (either) klack or get klacked on

[Verse 1: Phil Da Agony]
Black man, shoot your friendly neighborhood local policemen
Cause they'll say you got a gun, it's just cell in your hand
Police will shoot without proof or evidence or the truth
My nigger reached for registration, blew his brains through the roof
Which lead me to the conclusion that we should do the shooting
My itchy trigger finger niggers is a new resolution
What about Sean Bell and all the niggers in jail
That didn't really do the crime it just remind me of hell
To get locked like Mandela get respected
Or you can get rich like Roc-A-Fella off of records
Or you could shoot it out with the cops, make a body block
Take them on a high speed chase, hit the body shot
Change of place, when you shoot the pigs, aim for the stomach, hit the face
Rob a bank, hit the safe, get the cake, clack first
Youtube Micheal Moor fast words, studies show, cops see blacks and let the gats burst
Yeah, that's right motherfucker, you could Youtube that shit yourself
Build the agony Strong Arm Steady and I'm

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mitchy Slick]
You hear that guitar but this ain't no rock band
I spit this because, because I'm a rock man
In my homeland it's hard to withstand
That's the beat (?) south east is contraband
Fire armed car, alarm in the back drop, yellow tape a fellow got scraped while his rats watched
We RS fellows mandatory down to a pistols but if you ain't toting a nigger will yank your chrystals
And I'm King Tuting just call me a ice flooding, Morgiado top flopping at the tap of a push button
More revenue than most niggers are still on the block
Maybe cause I got something to lose, they ask won't be shot
But once a real factor, always a klack klacker
Make carnage out of niggers that think they a change snatcher
City full of brain blasters, San Diego's filled with dead homies that some little nigger's named after
Don't get it fucked up nigger, just cause a nigger hopping out this V cord,
Don't mean a nigger won't splat you nigger

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krodon]
Baptized with an appetite for warfare, stay in here you lift the 10 feet in the air, yeah
Homie see electric chair, cell block filled to the rim with
You keep letting the small things slide, you won't win, die or survive
Do your time, take it in stride
(?) niggers on the yard when it's fun time
The hood's evil know better than the Chinos what it's impact the ground zero
See heroes getting cut and ate like supiro
Leave them bleeding, guess I be needing David Chapiro
Be the reason they got wanted wetting the wierdo
(?)
I mean we like to preach whether blue make green, black and brown make green
But it's always gonna end up that way, so ya be prepared for everything

[Hook]Strong Arm Steady - Bark Like a Dog

[Phats Bossalini]

I'm not your normal your rap artist beg your pardon
Turn you to a target cause you fucking with the Seargant
You gotta feel me dog I'm more than starvin
Plus my hustle's sick and the flow's retarded
Couple mixtapes and the flow's on the market
Now my shit bangin from the burbs the projects
My pants saggin and I'm boasting and bragging
Shots of patron yeah we go for the gallon
Think of this picture me in the phantom
The G-5 make a easier landing
We can't stand him
Thats what the haters say
But I'm good money like a Michael Jordan fadeaway
Pray for the day I get this money on the straight away
I'm trying to feed my family for God sakes
But these are the brakes and the streets filled with snakes
And thats why I keep time with the cartier


[Hook: Krondon]
This lion’s missing his heart

So number five must be Rakim or Eminem
Ice and Scareface
Snoop Dogg or 50 cent

Was touring with Redd and Meth
Now those are some of the best niggas on the east coast like
Rae and Ghost

Common sense and Lil Wayne, LL Cool J
The best hooks got to Nate Dogg and T Pain

[Montage One]


We track beaters, with 8 channel heat-seekers
16 bars combined with guitar riffs
MP programmed to swing on every 4/5th
Timing is everything, king of the first verse
Master of the last one
Usually never have one
Written, but fully automatic with the spittin
Black alley-cat with no kittens
Dolo on my night walk
Pun told killas carry chalk and erasers
And stay on you niggas like tracers
You pull a hamstring
I pull your whole card
We tend to bogard
Later give your mic back
And tell you Imma need it tomorrow
Cause it's like that
Matter of fact, what you got on my 40 sack
Phil got the purple pack
Kron with the honey wrap
Backwood ???????
Kief makes the lungs collapse
Nigga we jock when we smoke this shit
And bitches at the front the of my stage

Brain in the green room
Everybody get out
The only nigga you know, you never put a hit out
But still pick up a mic and blow your fucking shit out

[Krondon talking]
You already know what it is. Nigga, Krondon
Yellowface, Revolution, Strong Arm Steady Gang. Heard dat

[Verse One] [Krondon]
You got a millionaire mouth piece
Broke nigga bank account
Let's see him eat without teeth
Swallowin' a porterhouse
Niggas get your order out
Servin' hot two for one gunshots
The legend that the little niggas heard about
In and out of luxury
Auto mobility
Luckily I keep the fully auto tucked on me
Niggas that I don't trust approach me humbly
Really ain't much to discuss, I'm no dummy
The root of evil is the love of money
Not money
The things people do when hungry
Niggas rather chase the honey and act all out monkey
Ape shit, fuckin' up the country
Steady make the hits till the tires fall off the Hummy
Play the cards till I'm drunk
Gin Rummy
Revolution make the beat to bang like Cash Money
And he knows who's the hardest artist nigga

[Hook]
Strong Arm Steady blowin' up the spot

But I'mma be gettin' off scott free
X to the Z? That's the homie so stop askin' me
My whole objective is to sell records like Master P
Askin' me about Kweli
While I was performin' in Raleigh, Durham
You was on the block hittin' sherm
With a perm like Big Worm
If you ain't pimpin' like Suga Free
Send in that ho, holla at Mitchy
Pop my collar right here, itchy
Very +Superstitious+ like Stevie
+It's Tricky+ like Run-DMC
To grab the mic, dizzy, you right

Red and blue make green so get your bars up or get broke off ya bitch ass nigga
I've been ready. Yeah

[Verse Three] [Mitchy Slick]
Uh, San Diego
Tatted on my forearm
I'm a tecanina bringa and I clack for the Strong Arm
No harm
Intended, that's just how we mash
See us comin', don't bleed on the sidewalk
But cut your ass
Cause if the ? son tension buildin'
I'm stealin'
We rearded niggas worth millions but still with the killin'
Third eye completely on G shit
Cross the gang and you're gonna need your check and your teeth fixed
Cause we hit like Jeep and red boy mixed
Bred to be dead game
Don't scratch, won't quit
All them extras, boats
Harley bikes
Got everything pimp like diamond studded gauntlet
On my aunt's sis
I'm with the bizness
In the same profession as my nigga J. Diggs is
For the S.A.S. trib is a way of livin'
That's why a S.A.S. sits in whatever driven

[Hook]
Ayo
Strong Arm Steady blowin' up the spot

Blao!
Put your hands up, everybody come to the front

"Blow the spot" - Redman 'Funkorama'
"Every spot we blow it up"
"Blowin' up spots like I was sendin' out mailbombs" - Madd Skillz 'Nod Factor'[Intro]:
Now this is the real thing. We found a groove. Ha. We move each other

[Verse One: Saukrates]:
I don't wanna leave you on the sidelines dude
The clock is ticking get your mind right dude
Rememberin' the days when I was like you
Why I ain't end up in the pine box? True
What goes up, must come down
So when you sittin' at the top, you won one round
Now here comes one generation that's so profound
You ain't never heard the word "assassination" so pronounced
Like ?? through the repercussion of winnin' while you sinnin'
The nation stay huntin' for you

[Hook: Saukrates]
And I don't mean to break the news to you niggas
But the crabs in the buckets are true
As true as a bullet, easy as a trigger pull it
I'm sure you'll do what's best for you
So clean up, don't ease up
I know you'll do what's best for you

[Verse Two: Black Thought]
The conflict is crucial
The drama is just futile
Hush
Kinda make you wanna wonder what to do you know it must
Get a little easier on some ooh child trust
People cut throat this is the new style
I know you're man just passed but this too shall
Just keep those crabs out of where you lay your roots down
They in the bucket tryin' to make they splash
And take more each figure, fuck it they gon' take they cash
Cause it's like, I gotta get it, gots gots to get it
Especially in a city where cops not permitted
So box lock your digits
I hate to be the one to break the news to you but shit's hot
Watch them niggas
A few is gonna flat out, walk up and say "fuck you"
Others is gonna play it like, "Aye, what you been up to?"
Knowing they want to get somebody to touch you
I know regardless you gon' do what you must do
For you

[Hook]

[Outro]
Me? I ain't high. You know why? Cause I can't truly be high unless all my motherfuckin' friends is high. I look around. I see my friends. Do you know what I feel like doing? (What you feel like doing?) I feel like sharing my shit[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me, cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho

[Suga Free]
Comin from a cat, that uhh
Believe that if wasn't nobody else in the world to pimp
He'll probably pimp hisself, that's me, Suga Free
Dig that, yeah, again? Uhh X, man, y'know
If I don't slop her man she feel like I don't love her, youknowhatI'mtalkinabout?
This thing takes all kinds of turns and switches and changes, y'know
It's called the P - Steady!

[Chorus]

[Strong Arm Steady - 1]
Woman out the wilderness - bitch!
The homies say you got a wildabeast piece
But she a dimepiece, her mind lost, thrown off course
She been divorced twice, overwhelmed by - bad advice
From a past life, she crazy though
Call my telephone a hundred times in a row
I don't know how to let her go
I'm stuck with this ho - pardon me
But she ain't nuttin but the worst part of me
She even threatened to slice her artery
I gotta watch my God Degree
She tried to voodoo the peas and throw her eyelashes in the recipe
Please, it's more than she's spittin in my lemonade
And R. Kelly ain't got the right to sing the hook, like Butch
Yeah, c'mon, spit it

[Chorus]

[Strong Arm Steady - 2]
Now since chickens of a feather be cluckin together
And I met her through Aiesha, I shoulda known better
She a pro-fessional charger Laker chaser
The kind that'll lie and say one of 'em raped her (trick)
But she in love with a gangsta
And it's been all trivial since the day that I janked her
Swore she wasn't ghetto but I met her at Fairmont
Shoulda knew she was a gangsta when she said that it wasn't her man's car
- but now she crazy over me
Tryin to OD, cause she can't be with me
She'll, fuck with different sets just to bring you beef
Fake a pregnancy just to get you fo' a G, crazy

[Butch Cassidy]
How much can one man take?
Worried if I leave it's her life she'll take
So I'm stuck here livin life in fear
Situation so severe
I need to change my ways
Pay more attention to her ho-pefully
Thinkin with my dick every night and day
The bitch won't go away

[Strong Arm Steady - 3]
Girl stop screamin
All in front of my house, tellin everybody you not leavin
And just beat it - you're insane
Crazy and deranged and I don't need you
Look, don't make me repeat it
I'ma say it one time, kick rocks or I'ma call the one-time
I shoulda hollered at your sister (aiy)
We went to the same high school, and plus she finer than you
Hey - baby this one's on you
You know it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none too
You dug my man out, your hand's out, askin for help
Hey - go 'head trick, kill yourself, {?}

[Chorus]

[Suga Free]
That means you ain't doin it for free
And that's what I'm talkin 'bout, Suga Free
Up in here with Xzibit y'knamhsayin, West coast big style
We really doin this out here f'real homey
Y'knahmsayin, y'all get to know, y'knahmsayin
You'll get to know yo' folks a little bit better too
If you just uhh, recognize this P, y'knahmean?
Y'knahmsayin we respect the hip-hop, we respect the whole 9
Y'knahmtalkinabout pimpin, the bud is greener and the grass is greener
Y'knahmtalkinabout, the pimpin is cleaner and mackin is meaner
Y'knamsayin, DIG THAT
You can be a stand-up ho or a fall-down bitch
And we mean this out here on the West[Intro]
S.M., S.A.S., you already know what it is
Tell 'em baby

[Krondon]
You ain't got the right to be talkin' out the side of your mouth
You ain't tight, you shouldn't utter a word
Your art's absolutely absurd; I'm precise
You can't compare to me, your shine ain't that bright
Yeah, think I better turn you into food for the fishes and
Leave behind upset cryin' senior citizens
Cryin' on that shit again, shotgun Charlemagne
The bar's still open so drink with the Steady gang
It's all free, no need for membership
Premium businessmen believe me it's Blacksmith
Talk smack and I'll castrate you with a Battle Axe
Swell up your membrane, then kick a battle rap

[Talib Kweli]
Hey~! Get off your high horse come down to where the battle at
That ain't real rap you +Brokeback+, where your saddle at?
S.A.S. klack-klack-klack, your body's in the black bag
Thinkin' on some punk rock shit like Black Flag
Operation Ivy with the poison in the ink well
Punchline screw your face up like a stank smell
Kweli so funky, got your nose runny like a blow junkie
Blacksmith, my people never go hungry
You rappers flow so crummy; I get the sisters and the snowbunnies
Buyin' up the tickets, gettin' show money
Oh fo' sho' Money, it's the gentlemen charmed
Rappers rot in pieces like the tat on Eminem's arm

[Phil Da Agony]
Strong Arm Steady the brand, the classic
Light up a Backwood and then ash it before you pass it
You know how the hash get, on the side where the greener grass is
Gotta throw on your stunna shade glasses
Niggas get blasted, I'm handin out cashes
And caskets, gotta break bread like a basket
You bastards! Rappers can't outlast the masters
Press it up on wax and spin the needle on the plastic
Blacksmith, roll another blunt for these actors
Cause I'mma put the +Fear+ in the +Factor+ and clack ya
Agony! Niggas gotta pay for the ecstasy
Especially, when I'm cookin up another recipe

[Tre Nyce]
Battle Axe heavy, we stack fetty off rapid
So much coke on my track remind me of Aspen
Two white bitches they Alka Seltzer and aspirin
Blunt roll swell the room, boom's outlastin'
K.C. niggas slash just to murder every track
Not a rap Democrat, more like Trap-publican
Rap trap, count a stack, money keep comin' in
Only cock the hammer back for those who got no love for that
You ain't got no love for him; you ain't got no love for him?
I'm runnin' up and dumpin' 'em, poppin' 'em and trunkin' 'em
Only gets us mad, I'm young and I'm Donald Trumpin 'em
Business sense ridiculous I'm literally stompin' 'em
Van City to L.A., we kick game like Pele
Do a show, grab some hoes, and take her to the telly
Young Tre Nyce, I'm the youngest in charge
Nigga, violate our squad, you'll be needin' the law

[Prevail]
+Protect Ya Neck+ my Battle Axe is like a Wu-Tang sword
I run the blade against your throat like you was Harrison Ford
Your girl got 'em worldwide I've been to Paris on tour
From the Eiffel Tower my rifle power make you contort
This is a contact sport, no coaches or referees
I'm hotter than Cali's Death Valley vultures and fleas
A posse cut, I chop it up like I was butcherin beef
A Boondocks saved my boombox beats like a priest
{*explosion*}[Hook: Mitchy Slick]
No talkin don't pay the rent
And sittin won't let you style like this
But money don't make you rich
But hatin won't let you smile

[Phil Da Agony]
Yeah, the Teknology is too advanced
Attach dynomite to opportunity, blow your chance
Enhance the vision, Kweli tell 'em to listen
Before I probably get a hundred niggas to diss 'em
Yeah, and I can't wait, sit up straight
Hungry niggas eatin your plate, compete in a race
Full of rats, the homie's torso is full of tats
I'mma put the rest on my back, it's best if I, bless 'em with that
Specify the facts from the fiction
I gotta draw the line with the diction
And I ain't whistlin, Dixie; this is Hi-Teknology wit me
You couldn't find a finer designer to tailor fit me
To be, yay a nigga Tone, Cincinnati's own
Hometown favorite like the Bearcats win the zone
Strong Arm keep it runnin on like a sentence
They wouldn't know the difference when I hit 'em from a distance

[Hook]

[Mitchy Slick]
Clack, conventional (bullshit) nothin identical
The West has evolved and Steady's, at the pinnacle (yeah dat)
Still saggin in my crispy Dickies
But my gangsta's fly, I make sho' the wrist is extra crystal-y
Cock it on the side for the next telly is
Ghetto nigga on Lambo's mailin list
Money don't make you rich
But it's funny how it'll make a snow bunny suck your dick
I have a hater in the shrubs where you park your shit
I had a homie blowin you up when he hit the fence
To the Steady, Slick bring the gangsta shit
Like the hankerchief, once you add on the Paisley print
On the rights where I dang a lick
But since I learned red and blue make green it's Tek hits

[Hook]

[Krondon]
It's the premier kids cast to build the pyramids
A '08 Escalade's in prepaid appearances
It's hard to even entertain a few, an invalid
Lame in the brain can't talk or remember shit
I don't blame him - the daddy ain't around
Left him lonely in the hood without good home trainin
Frustrated, pissed cause probation
Got him pissin in a cup without proper occupation
So they - get up, get out, and get it like Goodie Mob
Niggas must be crazy thinkin we won't do the job
Dookie colored droptops sob, with the feet tall
Hi-Tek beats bump from Lynn Street to Crenshaw
Steady means stupid stand up, start elevatin
Violate and come to your final destination
Mouth{?} pacin - Pacific Ocean main land
Chasin retail, re-up in rotation

[Hook] - 2X[Talib Kweli]
One, two, three and the place to be
You got the almighty Talib Kweli, BK emcee
It's the international rockin' with Madlib
We got the Strong Arm Steady gang and the place to be
We got Chace Infinite, Self Scientific and the place to be, word

[Hook]
Blacksmith is running through your function
No need for interruptions or discussions, no
Welcome to a Madlib production
We listenin; but y'all really sayin' nothin,' no

[Talib Kweli]
I try to say the most just to say the least
I try to stay the coast while I slay the beast
I'm bout to say my piece, you listenin' to Rita's voice
Speakin' is the people's choice, Blacksmith is
The return of the black fist, that's quiet
That's it, it's the black star shout out to black
Bonte give me a call the next time you watch the VMA's
I'll be right there with the whole rock steady gang
Or making a fucking logistical nightmare
My nigga's is right here at the speed of light yea
Soon as I send the signal out after the night air
The sound that we makin' got them quakin' in they Nik' airs
We don't fight fair I'll make your shit crash
Quit yellin' whiplash you bitch ass (nigga)
Mad cause I'm faster and I hit the gas quicker
My squad cut like a glass of liquor, pass that

[Phil the Agony]
No matter the cost, we back at it, gat at your boss
Shoot to kill, splatter with force
Air force bubblin' blitz this shit
Fire like two sticks rubbing like this
No tricks nothing is fake I'mma ride
What you want thin ice where you skate? When them niggas hate
I'mma say beat break shake it off
Focus on what's important, but take a loss
Force the hand this is Strong Arm feeding you
We're beating you, cut a nigga short like an interlude
Bars anonymous, I promise you this
One line will make you famous like Travis and shit
It's the S.A.S, you are now rocking with the best
All them other rappers lied to you (nigga)
Yes, yes, it's still west, west
With my east coast, polly, Kweli, you got a problem with me

[Chace Infinite]
Steady Gang running the game, it won't change
Back to the days with Jordan's and gold chains
Fistful of dollars fucking future top models
Through the knowledge but we still poppin' bottles
Pushing like full throttle on the Interstate trunk full
Of product just to make a nigga's dinner plate
Gotta get this money for my daughter's sake, and I
Smoke a lot of weed and plus a nigga gotta say (what)
Fresher than a motherfuckin' mannequin, you get
The point like we was playing pickle with a couple javelins
Gimme a reason to stop speaking and
Start niggas bleedin' in the mid Los Angeles region
We the niggas that believe in lacerations and lesions
Niggas wanna dick and get it this evenin'
Earn a song James Lionel grain greedy geniuses
Y'all niggas is mysteries nothin' but phantom menaces
And we the niggas y'all love to hate
But see the homies from the east just raise the stakes
And we gonna get it in a major way
Blacksmith is the label strong arm is the game

[Krondon]
Shawshank charmaleon six pack benatall (??)
Weeping in the bank watching Robin Hood withdraw
Young orangutan gettin' niggas knocked off
You hall ass and get a trip to see Lou Rawls
I pour Henny from jewelry in my jacket like linen
You don't think I got the hustle in me
Roll with the real resis' you retarded
And winky is not the shit he just farted
One trip you motionless you understand the kid got close
And we can get rich, the rice stay broke
King Tut chrome in the cut like macuricone
Take off your head like the N.O. Superdome
The blacker the better, the greener the cheddar
We the new Dream Team smoking more green (nigga)
Jihad jinkins liberating like Abe Lincoln
Dizzling dumbing out minkin

[Hook] 2x[The Game]
Y'all niggas see me when I'm come through; and ain't no denyin
That them big motherfuckers is twenty-five
Swayin in and out of white line, six double-oh
Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin like the streets is mine
Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman/Ali combined
If there's beef, I'm releasin mine
And I won't stop bustin 'til them Escalade seats recline
The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein sorry, it ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him
And the Game ain't tryin to win, fuck the awards
So keep that little-ass horn, and that Neil Armstrong nigga

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Trust me dog, ain't shit you can put in your rap
That'll make you a gangsta, you a bitch and that's that
Niggas thinkin I retired my Chuck, put the gun back in the holsters
Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster
But that don't stop the heater from bangin, or me comin through
Droppin all y'all niggas with three in the chamber
Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin, one in the changer
One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder
Dog we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game
Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains
And the coroner's real good with that pickup
A1 good with the carpet cleaning, they can get the rest of that shit up
Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time
Put you niggas next to each other how I do 'em in line

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home
If beef cook then I'm bringin the chrome
If I die then I'm leavin a clone; but if I live
Through the drama one mo' time then them boys gotta dig
When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big
When I'm rhymin on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin on the block
And when I'm loadin up them clips, I listen to 'Pac
A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
Than F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey
And ain't nuttin to do a driveby in the hood
We ain't even got survival, but I'ma still take that ride
Bet my drink on it, bet my main squeeze mink on it
Think this shit a joke? Bet the S-5 pink on it[Hook: Mitchy Slick]

You gon’ need more than one gun if you gon’ eat around here
My gangstas do more than stand around and drink beer
Niggas don’t squab no more it’s all gunplay
???? you gon’ see him one day
Every OG got a youngster that’ll whack for him
And if he gets pissed he’ll dust off a old mac for him
Last couple niggas smoked got they whole wigs riddled
These niggas got some big ass guns that’s why I ride with two pistols


[Phil Da Agony]

Yeah
Blast for your stash
I’m like fat Albert’s younger brother dumb donald with the mask
Drunker than lil Rass Kass of the flask
My eyes start getting all wide once I see cash
Lemon pepper sea bass
Sprinkling that Lawry’s seasoning
With a pinch of Mr’s Dash
Ashen’n my backwood packaging
While I break every letter down in my rap
Like an acronym
Whatever happened to that?
That nigga shit
Like em blacker than black
Pull out the mac from the back of the lac
Thats my nigga I’ll clap for him
The first rapper ever took me on tour
I’ll go to war for him
Go to the drawer for him
Pull out a couple of stacks
Either that or just dust of the gat
Yeah dat

[Hook]


I aris hit me knees and pray
And pull the Henny out
For my bredren in heaven I pour the Remy out
??? Without doubt
Too many pennies
A little’s better than not any
Take it from me
Willy Hutch and the ??? off blunts and clear Belvederes
Nevada nights off white huntin for Brittany Spears
Hear the boom blast
Fast as the words up out a DOOM mask
No school or class could the fool pass
Rescue please ??? President Hussein
Don’t let em shame your name and wish the truth came
Free the lame, art of war ,armageddon for the future
Can’t tell the Saint from the shooter
Codeine supplement
Never seen such a crime scene like outsourced torture for the government


[Hook]


[Phil Da Agony]


Yeah dat, you ain’t never lied
You qualified to be the south-east ghetto tour guide
Let’s slow ride and take a closer look inside
Trigger side, homicide
It’s like Amistad, swallow your pride
Like a super big gulp
Knocked out like the great white hope
Socked out, before you hit the floor
You hit the ropes hard
Bullet proof booth like the Pope Car
Vacation with your bitch send a post card
Corny like Carson Daly this your last call
Put a gun straight to your head, hate to blast yall
So imma just stall yall out
The little homey’s gonna air you out
When they see you with the bitch out
No doubt[Hook]:
You don't
Can't stay away
I know
You don't
Can't stay away
Ehhh
You don't
Can't stay away
I know
You don't
Can't stay away

[Verse One] [Phil Da Agony]:
Check out how I handle my flow
It got power steerin'
If I ain't pioneerin'
If I ain't tryin' to save the Earth from bio hazardous engineerin'
Clearin' the lane from Greenhouse Effects
Or birth effects that fuck up your brain
It's like a level 5
Center for Disease Control, Ebola
Microchips in Michael Vics pitts by Motorola
Rapper with a colder shoulder, warmer heart
School a nigga just like a performing arts academy
Strong Arm Steady
Mitchy Slick, Krondon and Phil Da Agony
Assault and battery flow
Fed Ex delivery
That's how fast the rhymes blast out
Automatic versatile, I cash out
Outlasting the rest
Strong Arm Steady we the best
Take a trip to the west
We put the shit to the test

[Hook]:
I know
You don't
Can't stay away
Ehhh
You don't
Can't stay away
I know
You don't
Can't stay away

[Verse Two] [Krondon]:
Moons over Miami
Hey it don't rain in Cali
Except for the technical kind
Rest of the time it's shinin'
Nine out of ten time the lining
In your new leather coats too warm for the climate
Obsessed with rockin' the boat
Contest, no result
Nothin' to win, know when to vote
When the jackpots still in the ?
Crack rock still killin' my folks
These past bills keepin' me broke
I'm chief of the doe
Growin' up north by white hillbillies
With pick up trucks, full of that green sticky
Ride through in hood with me
Try my city
Flyin' with a green guy that don't smoke Phillies
Know they don't smoke swishers
But I will pull a trigger on a bully tryin' to think he bigger
Krondon, crack sellin' rapper with a sawed off shotgun
Holdin' a pump
Let's get drunk

[Hook]:
Can't stay away
I know
You don't
Can't stay away
Ehhh
You don't
Can't stay away
I know
You don't
Can't stay away
