[Intro]
You were never ready for the flow

[Verse 1]
When the rain don't fall so hard no more
And the bank won't take my card no more
But they ain't gon' pull my card neither
And they ain't gon' pull my squads either
Niggas spit shit, I hock ether
Stephen Hawking, no need for talking
Got a hawk's eye but I can hardly see you
Talk's fly, pray you're not Aaliyah
I ain't trying to rock the boat
But the flow crazy, I paint pictures but they're not baroque
More Scorsese, niggas made scores out of instrumentals
Nigga type a script with a pen and pencil
Use words from Scripps National Spelling Bee, fuck is you telling me that didn't sound better spitting it simple?
Fuck with me, famo
Ginger ale for your hoes
Not shit else, not even my dick
Man I got way too much on my mind
Got a little light bout as bright as my Bic
And y'all got way too much on the shine
Y'all niggas don't tell enough of the truth in the booth
And it's proof you ain't fucking with mine, sip

[Hook]
Water more important than the gold
People for the gold
Everybody do it for the gold
People save your souls
Water more important than the gold
People for the gold
Everybody do it for the gold
People save your souls
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God

[Verse 2]
Started from the bottom of the map
Roll Tide at the end of the wave
In this bitch ballpoint strapped
Get back, this nigga got a pen to the page
Permanent marks, I'm a marksman, I never miss
Talk shit, that's a hint at your age
Big chain, that's a hint that it cage
They're saying you're sane, but I'm gone in 60 seconds on a verse; that's Mickalas Cage
Fuck with a black young man, I'm everything that it denotes
Shit comes straight from the heart, not a record exec in the back with a remote
Niggas gon' play their parts
Save face on a face on the back of a C-note
Everybody wanna be the back of a D-Rose
But I can't go, Van Gogh how I handle
Paintbrush when I paint flows
Niggas in the club throwing pesos
Niggas on the block throwing pitch forks
And not from Barbados, I don't give a fuck how you rep your flag
Catch him in the cut when he roll his truth, and I don't give a fuck how you stuff your bags
Touch the sky, it's much more than trees, what can you tell me about your roots?
Spitting that truth like a cold white rapper, niggas gon' always need some Proof
Niggas gon' always need some water, niggas gon' always speak the truth
Niggas gon' always want the messenger dead and they always need the proof
My God...

[Breakdown]
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God
Niggas gon' always need some water, niggas gon' always speak the truth
Niggas gon' always want the messenger dead and they always want the proof
Niggas gon' always need the proof
Niggas gon' always need the proof

[Hook] (x2)SYeah I'm so cool that I go swimming in a pool
My brothers so ugly that he makes me wanna study
Yeah yeah
He bangs on door that just wants me to go to every ugly store
Because I'm so cool, I get too go swimming I'm my baby pool
I'm a better rapper but he's a better hacker
I wear so cool clothes that just wants him to go to koles
My friend is Steve but guess what all he has is little stupid sleeve
Ha now that were done he just became a bumAsFootball is my favorite but my friend just has too hate it why it just a lie
I maby should just die.
Football is all about making touchdowns
But my friend thinks its all about smackdown
Naw that's wrong but
You are very strongI'm sick an twisted with flows so deep
Lilwayne ringing for a new laric every week
I'm like Travis barker playing with an instrument in power like bush in whashingtonP Xain

If you dont know by now then Ill doubt you'll ever know
So let me try and educate you with my Lyrical flow
On the Mic at this time, in the place to be
People hanging out just coz they wanna be next to me
Its a special place let me try to explain
Its not a record shop or a fast food chain
When my cupbpards are bare and Im not Hip Hopping
You'll see me down there, doing my shopping

Chorus
Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
Its like a mini Mart you get more for less
Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
The range of Soft drinks and Crisps is the best

Eggsy
If you dont know where it is go to microcare computing
Just round the corner from Acorn Recruiting
Sanitary prtotection, Magazines or a twix
Theres some bloke on the door who looks like Neo from the matrix

Balls
Homemade sandwiches and homemade pies
You get served after hours if you give them the eyes

P.Xain
Well dont try shoplifting and dont go nicking
The last person that did got a proper fucking kicking

Eggsy
Loads of wicked people utilise the store
One bloke did try to start a fight before
But he wasn't affiliated with the friendly staff
Coz he was rough the sort of person who would shit in the bath

Adam Hussain
Pasties, Sarnies and Polish meats
Extra strength Lager to drink on the street
I even hang round outside when its closed
Take my Mrs down there when Im gonna propose

Baneswell Express Baneswell Express
Do they sell booze? YES!
They got porno mags to give you an erection
And spotted dick in the frozen section
They got lager cider, cherry coke
See me outside in Pauls car having a smoke
They sell sex lube, Scratch Cards and Choc Ices
All that and more at reasonable prices

Maggot
Its a local shop but its so much more
Ilove going down there when I smoke the draw

GTB
Three bottles for a tenner Red, Pink or White
Will keep your mrs's legs ope all night

Maggot
If you need tampons and you've got a heavy flow
Then Baneswell Express is the only place to go

GTB
I took some ecstacy and went there shopping
Loved it so much next week I'm double droppping

Mysty
Sometimes I just hang out on the street
Because you never ever know who your gonna meet
Sometimes I just browse and hang around
Coz you never ever know what will be found at the

[Hook] (x2)AsI knew a girl wants to die
Just fade away into the beautiful blue sky
Her name's Anne so Anne be true
Die Anne, die Anne
Die as quick as you can
Die Anne, die Anne
I didn't know I was a sailor
'Til I found myself aboard of a ship
I didn't know I was a surgeon
Till I removed a woman's hip
I didn't know I was a dentist
Till I took out my teeth
To the cold execution
Of an innocent teeth
Die Anne, die Anne
Die, oh Anne
Die Anne, die Anne
Oh Love , die Anne
An owl from Dallas
Will never know you see the therapist
I love that wound in your lips
He's still wants it but maybe he's dying
Die Anne, die Anne
Cry if you can
Die Anne, die Anne
Cry in blue
Die AnneISA
