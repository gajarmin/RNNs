[Verse 1: 2-low]
Cover your dome or feel a motherfucking Glock
The rugged child is in the house, I'm letting off shots
Biggity bang biggity bang, hit the motherfucking deck
I'm down on this track and I'm abouts to get wreck
I'm coming like a hustler, never coming buster
Blasting on you hoes screaming, "Die, motherfucker!"
Never showing mercy cause that shit is for the weak
I rhyme with my Glock and knock a nigga off his feet
A young nigga, shorts as I figure
Step up with that bullshit, I'm a greet you with this trigger
Blasting on you hoes and let you know how it feels
Bucking with the 5th ward will get your motherfucking dome peeled
Motherfucker bring it on

It's the Seagster, the major leagster
Bitch deceiver, nigga life-reliever!
Oakland hustler, never been a busta

Straight from the 6-9, the final line village
Doing more damage than a Exxon spillage!
Uh, coward, and that's that
I'm known to pack a gat and put heads on flat
No rehabilitatin' my trigga'
Take a nigga out the ghetto
But you can't take the ghetto out the nigga
Ain't nothing changed since the 70s
I'm hellbound nigga, my life ain't never been heavenly
Never slippin punk no, a nigga don't lag
Game tight replace a nigga's Nikes with a toe tag
His zoom, his ass, his zigga I'm the founder
Stacking up bodies like Jeffery Dahmer
Oh, here comes the flow, watch me as I tip toe
To a nigga's window, with my M 6-0
Putting motherfuckers out their misery
And watching the murders reenacted on Unsolved Mysteries
Trick, coward lame pussy ass faggot
Six feet deep is where you sleep with the worms and the maggots
Nigga's can't harm me, Rap-A-Lot army
Coming like Desert Storm, you've been warned
But if you still want some, nigga, bring it on!

[Verse 3: Too Much Trouble]
Too Much Trouble done sewed up the tracks
Bitches not playing like they win or get smacked
By some young niggas that's down to break a bitch
The Nickel Nut and the Band-Aid Bandit

Yes the Nickel Nut pimping ten different sluts
You've encountered slavery bitch I don't give a fuck
That better turn some tricks, a suck a lotta dicks
And come with my money or they get their ass kicked

Geto got hoes on the stroll making my bank roll
But when we tangle bitch, I run with foes
Cause all about the pen, ain't talking about the pussy
I'm talking about the paper, so bitch shake your money maker

It's the pimp pimp pimpin, you're simp simp simpin
Your bitch chose me now you're wimp wimp wimpin

5th Ward Boys coming hard for the nine trey
I'm down with them Geto Boys so make my motherfucking day

The 5th Ward Boys on the motherfucking set
Putting a slug off in your chest

Nigga, ratta tat tat to your temple
Shit is real simple, busting up domes like a pimple

Jump if you want, nigga, and I'm a have to hurt ya

[Verse : Odd Squad]
I can't see your ass bitch, so you'd better watch your bust or
Take that from a blind handicapped motherfucker
Smoking weed and steadily downing that Schlitz Malt Liquor
If you wanna step and get done, cause I'm that nigga

Well it's me that nigga D (Who?)
That fat square twister, the one who fucked your sister
I made her pussy blister, got a dick in the side of my pearl white Lac
Keep my weed in the front and my brew in the back
And my heat up under my seat ready to put the lead on ya
So punk motherfuckers try to test me if you wanna

Smoking that weed, feeling fine

[Verse 5:Ganksta N-I-P]
A weed-smoking motherfucker, plus I kick doobies
I'm the one that told that nigga to go insane in that Luby's
Ganksta NIP is fucking your daughter, G
I wake up every morning screaming, "Somebody slaughter me!"
Step in my path, your ass is void
Cause I'm an aerodynamic, satanic, schizophrenic android
Your mind ain't deep enough, cars can't creep enough
Dead bodies complaining we too loud, they can't sleep enough
Attempted murder, I didn't mean to hurt her
I hadn't ate in two years, I just wanted a cheeseburger!
A bulletproof vest won't protect your chest
A whole body is hard to digest
Once I flex, count the next
The hardest I won like recreation of Malcolm X
So bring it on, I'm ready to slaughter
Sitting in church, drinking a 40 of holy water

Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah! (Repeat 2x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!

DMG bring it on

[Verse 6: DMG]
I've been a victim of society
They got me fucked in this whole shit
Niggas running up with M-11's and some mo shit
It seems to me they wanna start something
But I'm a let this motherfucking 9 break em off something
My homie panicked cause he never thought it'd come to that
Miggity Mike serving em soft from these niggas gats
I guess it's like guerilla warfare
Now grab your gat and load your clip and go for deaf until you make it there
And if you don't then grab your nuts, duke
Cause that's the only way these niggas living in the 9-deuce
More murder by killings and slayings, some shit
You fake on your tool and find your homie dead in a ditch
Now the fucking water's getting hot
Homie after homie after homie's getting shot
And niggas are overlookin the joys of life
.357 with them hollow point shells in the midnight
Check it: first I walk up on him like I know him;
Then, I let me conversation start to ho him
Yo, I never debates the way I handle my business
Cause niggas always be fucking shit up well it's time to handle they
Business
He's peeping out my missile as I stand straight
So now it's time to make his ass like a crushed grape
Come check a nigga gun for his get sound get click
Yo, you shoulda brought it on

[Verse 7: Mr. 3-2]
3-2 comin at ya, comin at ya
Don't make me pull my shit and have to cap ya

So a nigga gon drop, a nigga gon drop

Uh, where your nuts at nigga? You'd better let em hang

So bring on your motherfucking crew bitch, we can get it on

[Verse 8: Big Mello]
Strapped assassin, ghetto gladiator
Leaving a path of destruction like the motherfucking Terminator
Lurking the streets of hardcore, stalking like a predator
17 shots to the chest made his clothes wetter than mine
Cause the nine'll hit your ass every time
Got my motherfucking b-mo, going straight for the dome
Wig-splitting nigga with the finger on the trigger
Sinister, symptoms of a motherfucking killer
B-I-G to the motherfucking M-E
Double L-O's not a motherfucking ho
But a cutthroat, smiggity smoking niggas like dope
Now bitch don't choke, cause the dick's down your throat
Getting my blast on, nigga get your ass on
Riggy run your ass home cause I'm a bring it on, homes!

[Verse 9: Scarface]
It's the return of the motherfucking dreadlock
Putting fools in headlocks, giving niggas headshots
You don't wanna fuck with me, I ain't that motherfucka
I mean that average, run-of-the-mill ass nigga
You hoes better recognize this nigga that you up against;
Mista mista Scarface ain't that nigga to be fucking with
So lay it down niggas, bump it down or feel the pressure
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's known for taking drastic measures
Quick to rip shit and leave a motherfucker twitching
So niggas make a run once my rifle starts spittin'
Round after round after motherfuckin round
So bitches lay it down, I shut em down, I shut em down!
Screaming for vengeance I swear that I meant this descended
Surrender suspended cause, niggas, I meant it
Calm like an Islamic brother from the Nation
Still got the mind of a motherfuckin mental patient!
I got the chrome to my own dome
But I'm a give you one before I take it home, motherfucka, so, uh

Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah (Repeat 3x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!(*talking*)
Uh yeah, just reminiscing a lil' bit
You know I'm tal'n bout, this goes out to my homeboy
Sheldon, know I'm tal'n bout

[Big Mello]
We use to talk and walk and stalk the halls, of J-Y High
Spitting game to these shoppers, smoking fry getting high
Leave the school house, making noise all over the city
I'm in the Regal with Bell, you in the Cutlass with Smitty
Two young lil' playas, all the G's cutted fo'
Down for whatever, and loved by hoes
Showing up at the club, getting nothing but love
Posted up straight thugging, nigga fly as a dub
Shell shocked I sho miss ya, nigga why you leave me
All you had to do was holla homie, if you needed me
I never thought, that you would take your life
When I was stressed and down and out, you kept me tight
But damn nigga, it ain't too many more real niggas
It's like I'm trapped in a zone, around these fake ass niggas
But I'ma keep it real, keep striving for the mill
Don't worry bout these playa hating niggas, out here
Yeah fool I'm still laughing, reminiscing on the fun times
Playing in the sunshine, flipping out of town
But I'ma hold it down, keep it real stay true
It's Southside for life, and nigga riding for you

[Hook - 4x]
My niggas (my niggas), my niggas (my niggas)
Man, man I sure miss my niggas

[Big Mello]
I remember all the stunts, that had me laughing for months
And all the times that we wrecked the concerts, getting crunk
Blowing blunts on the hunt, for the hoes in the crowd
A nigga tripping on stage, and had em screaming real loud
Kept a pistol in your pocket, yeah my nigga stayed strapped
Sucker free, and when it's time to scrap we had eachother back
Showing up at the Carro, leaning on drank
Ask Pac before the bank, huh smoking killer dank
Shit me and you Dre huh, Trent and B.T
Huh K.B., Melvin, Doug and N.V
Shit and that O.D., conversating with hoes
Lifting weights Big Rob, a nigga stuck on swoll
Damn dog, I know you was a G no lie
I remember you hit the church, and sang in the choir
Now, I know you in a better place
And man I'd give anything, to see your smiling face

[Hook - 4x]

[Big Mello]
Now we live so fast, and die so young
And so many cats, done lost they life to a gun
Cause yo we under pressure, but keep it together
Get your chips and have fun, cause it don't last forever
I thank the Lord everyday, I got a chance to strive
For the prize it's a blessing man, just to be alive
Jesus gone, and true playas and ballers
Kinda hard to swallow, sometime it make me wanna holla
But shit I'm like damn, not my man
Young brother young brother, man you just don't undertsand
Now you control your destiny, and take it from me
I'm so glad I ain't back, where I use to be
I keep moving on, and blow a sweet or two
I keep banging my Screw, and wear the red or blue
And take a chill recognize, it's a beautiful life
Now keep your game tight, and try to live right

[Hook - 4x]

(*talking*)
Uh know I'm saying, all my homeboys out there
You know I'm tal'n bout, man y'all keep y'all head up
You know I'm tal'n bout man, a nigga don't wanna lose no mo' real niggas man
You know I'm tal'n bout, all my partnas man
All my dead homies man I miss all y'all, you know I'm tal'n bout
Try to hold it down man keep living, you know I'm tal'n bout all my niggas[Big Mello]
You know it's crazy sometimes, so much drama all around
Make me wanna get the nine, to lay em all down
But I catch myself, put the pistol on the shelf
Take a breath exhale, thank God for my health
Cause shit, somebody out there didn't wake up
Somebody last night, got locked up now
It's the little things, that we take for granted
Just take a wrong move, will get you took out the planet
Slow down lil' homie, it's real in the field
All that bumping bout nothing, will get your cap peeled
See cats ain't boxing, they pulling them straps
And uh niggas don't give a damn, because we rap
See I got muscle, on the strength of my hustle
Cats know Mello bout it, ain't a studio buster
Put it down in these H-Town streets, got stripes in these streets
From the concrete, to marble flo' suites now

[Hook - 2x]
It's those crazy, games we playing
Some of us, out here playing ain't gon make it naw

[Big Mello]
It took a little time, for me to figure out
Exactly, what this game was all about
Hey yeah I was young once, we all go through it
See now I'm so focused, I see right through it
Rule one stack paper, stay away from haters
And you shake these fakers, like dice in Vegas
Now you mind your own business, stay out they face
And uh put some'ing up, because it costs to fight a case
Now you got a camouflage, when you on the grind
Get caught don't snitch playa, do your own time
And never hate the one, who put you down
Cause he'll be the same one, to bail you out
No doubt you can't burn bridges, you might cross again
Never turn your back, on your true friends
See me and my dogs, we play to win
And when the smoke clears, we still standing cause

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
Now these new wave cats, disrespecting the game
Now you know who you are, I mention no names
Naw even in the rain, I contain the stang
While they run around and say, cheat sand in the brain
I sit back puff Jane, hop on the plane
Hit a lick out of town, come back and cop thangs what
Playas know, when it's time to rearrange
And take a new journey, through a new terrain
See I switch patterns, and I stay up and at em
Attack em the first minute, that I spot that it's raggedy
Apply new strategy, avoid the tragedy
Keep it real with the family, haters they mad at me
I'm glad to be, the playa that they love to hate
Now it makes it more easy, to shake the snakes
And I'll watch em fall, just like snow flakes
Now that's the breaks huh, that's the breaks man

[Hook - 3x](*talking*)
Remind me to whoop your ass good, next time I see you

[Hook - 2x]
I make it niggy-niggy-knock y'all
Up and down, the biggy-block y'all
And now you know, it don't stop y'all
And now you know I got ya, all y'all

[Big Mello]
I stick my finger in the ground, and turn the whole world round
I make all these little playa hating punks, bow down
Move around right about now, I got this locked
My Southside body rock, keep trunks on knock
I rock spots keep it hot, and it's me yo mi caliente
What que paso ese, me el presidente
Don Dada, I set it off like Osama
Blow the spot like uni-bombers, see I bring the drama
My raps attack tracks, emcees back-back
Step to me on that mic, I'm like lyrical anthrax
Deadly track assassin, known for smashing and crashing
Egotistical rappers, I drop em all like Cassius
Burn they asses to ashes, shatter em like glasses
Whether flipping my tongue, or flowing slow as molasses
I'm classic like Coke, my flows hook em like dope
And when it's all said and done, it was murder I wrote

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
It's the return of the body rocker, trunk knocker
Hip hopper, making woofers sing like an opera
When I creep I beat the block up, with my gangsta boogie
Working wood like a vet, now watch me swang on these rookies
Lil' cats move around, when my slab come down
I pop a trunk lighting up, Southside H-Town
I'm a 84 swanger, gator backbone crawler
I-10 eighteen wheel, heavyweight hauler
Big boss giving orders, Hiram-Clarke night stalker
Bout it bout it like them boys, way down in New Orleans
See I make the trunk beat huh, break the concrete
My amps overheat, when I peep

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
I come down chunk the deuce, out the damn Hollywood
Sideways on Rick's, working wood looking good
I swang through the Southside, fuck a god damn vine
I put them swangas in your life, and all you jackers gon mind
Run up on me I'm dumping, I bar none fade all
I'ma crawl through the South, West, East and the Nawf
Tal'n bout what it do, don't like it nigga fuck you
Swang on me, you get your ass ran through
Already cocked and ready, strap lay by my belly
Coming down knocking Nelly, on biscuit and jelly
Represent the damn South, out of town I act bad
Down here we don't rent, we pay our shit straight cash
All you video cappers, with them borrowed ass Bentleys
Fuck your motherfucking 20's, what you do don't offend me

With them low pro fo's, Southside gon hold

[Hook - 4x][Big Mello]
Look out dog, we got a hater in the mix
Niggas mad, cause we trying to get richer
Don't wanna see a nigga, having paper mayn

[Tony Montana]

Old bitch ass, living in the past niggas

And when they fuck with you nigga, they fuck with me
Hold that J and Gene, see we family
KMJ street mafia, power team
I don't give a fuck, I bury cock-a-roaches
Exterminate all insects, and pesky rodents
These niggas, gon recognize
If they get too fly, kiss that ass goodbye

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
I could recall a couple of cats out here, who be hating knowing they shady
But if they come inside of my range, they ain't gon be breathing baby
Lately it seems these niggas be bumping, stronger than ever
Not clever cause I will hurt em, and spray em like rainy weather
And stop em where I drop em, red dot em and then I got em
And block em and then I sock em, till niggas wanna call the cops in
To lock me up, but I ain't going back
Half of these cats be knowing that, as soon as they start to chit-chat
Day I be turning blue black you get that, I'm telling y'all to get back
'Fore I get irritated, and slapping your ass on contact
I mean that believe that, you test that I'll stress that
And make it complicated, for people to get they life back

[Hook - 2x][Big Mello]
H-Town, you know it go down
Southside body rock, make em wanna show surround
I know they hate it, but we bout that cash
We be on slow boogie, boys moving too fast
I break it down, flip flop it and lock it
Keep the cash in my pocket, still shocking and rocking
Hit the club, tal'n bout what it do
I can show up, this slab or hoo-doo
Come down, don't crush your leather
I break boys off, and type of weather
If it flodd, I could hop on the road
Call Jimmy J, be like Mello let's go
Po'd up, stay dro'd up
Got the little mama, now it's time to power up
Y'all haters, gon recognize
The El Cap-i-tan, starship enterprise

[Hook - 2x]
Party on the dance floor, party people want more
Time to hear some'ing, from the Southside G
Big Mello, coming through the backdo'
Still representing, these H-Town streets

[Big Mello]
In Vegas, with the gangsta strut
Headline next day, H-Town showed up
Been wrecking, these boys for years
Piece and chain hard start, big rock in one ear
Some cats, be fly as broads
These pretty boy flaws, can't fade Bone Hard
Southside, come down all the time
Body rock and put it down, all across state line
Y'all know, where the real ballers be
From the Homestead, to the Mo City
Can't stop the grind, can't stop the shine
Even though they talk down, on this dirty H-Town
I don't bump, in the magazines
I drop these jewels, make you haters feel me
Bone Hard, from the heart of H.C
'Member me 'member me, still sucker free

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
H-Town, keep on body rocking
Keep on trunk knocking, keep on top dropping
Hey if you don't know, down here we playa made
True renegades, down here we staying paid
Paint stay wet, Screw in deck
Broads in check, playas still wreck
Haters hit the deck, when we show up on the set
Polo on chest, hard starched Guess

What's up South Park, man you know we go live
What's up Yellowstone, what's up Tre-Ward
What's up Northside, now you know we bone hard

Run up on this H, see we quick to pull your card

[Hook - 4x][Big Mello]
I'm trying to stay on feet now, hustling in these streets now
Got to feed my family, if I don't work we don't eat
No time for all that capping, showing off and acting
Brothers with that flashing, just don't know what's happening
Now it ain't what you do it's how you do, keep your bidness on the cool
Stack that paper the golden rule, don't let no one stop you

[Hook - 2x]
Haters they talk down now, playas put it down now
Don't worry how it's going down, what goes around comes around

[Big Mello]
So many haters doubted me, salted me in the industry
Folks and peeps stayed down with me, see I got love in these streets
My so called partnas doing Hollywood, turn they back on the neighborhood
Some cats be up to no good, I pray for them and it's understood
Now everybody got they issues, some smoke their's and some too
Whatever you do do what you do, see I can not judge you

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
Why all that finger pointing, counting people money
High capping and fronting, now you must don't have nothing
Empty wagons make a bunch of noise, men are men and boys are boys
Real is real and fraud is fraud, me I be bone hard now
Stack your paper mayn and maintain, do your thang stay out the rain
Don't let nothing bust your brain, don't worry bout a thang

[Hook - 4x][Verse 1: 2-low]

I'm the one that told that nigga to go insane in that Luby's
Ganksta NIP is fucking your daughter, G
I wake up every morning screaming, "Somebody slaughter me!"
Step in my path, your ass is void
Cause I'm an aerodynamic, satanic, schizophrenic android
Your mind ain't deep enough, cars can't creep enough
Dead bodies complaining we too loud, they can't sleep enough
Attempted murder, I didn't mean to hurt her
I hadn't ate in two years, I just wanted a cheeseburger!
A bulletproof vest won't protect your chest
A whole body is hard to digest
Once I flex, count the next
The hardest I won like recreation of Malcolm X
So bring it on, I'm ready to slaughter
Sitting in church, drinking a 40 of holy water

Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah! (Repeat 2x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!

DMG bring it on

[Verse 6: DMG]
I've been a victim of society
They got me fucked in this whole shit
Niggas running up with M-11's and some mo shit
It seems to me they wanna start something
But I'm a let this motherfucking 9 break em off something
My homie panicked cause he never thought it'd come to that
Miggity Mike serving em soft from these niggas gats
I guess it's like guerilla warfare
Now grab your gat and load your clip and go for deaf until you make it there
And if you don't then grab your nuts, duke
Cause that's the only way these niggas living in the 9-deuce
More murder by killings and slayings, some shit
You fake on your tool and find your homie dead in a ditch
Now the fucking water's getting hot
Homie after homie after homie's getting shot
And niggas are overlookin the joys of life
.357 with them hollow point shells in the midnight
Check it: first I walk up on him like I know him;
Then, I let me conversation start to ho him
Yo, I never debates the way I handle my business
Cause niggas always be fucking shit up well it's time to handle they
Business
He's peeping out my missile as I stand straight
So now it's time to make his ass like a crushed grape
Come check a nigga gun for his get sound get click
Yo, you shoulda brought it on

[Verse 7: Mr. 3-2]
3-2 comin at ya, comin at ya
Don't make me pull my shit and have to cap ya
With my Glock, I make it go "pop," it's a 17 shot
So a nigga gon drop, a nigga gon drop
You heard me roll a fatty
Now I'm at the window of your cocksucking caddy
So what you wanna do? It's about that time
Pop pop pop goes the weasel in my nine
Uh, where your nuts at nigga? You'd better let em hang
Cause we can get it on, ho, it ain't no thang, uh
Mo murder mo motherfucking merrier
Cause I be one of the roughest niggas from the hardcore area
So quit running your mouth, bitch, you know you can't fade this
Rap-A-Lot south shit
It's the 3-motherfucking-2
So bring on your motherfucking crew bitch, we can get it on

[Verse 8: Big Mello]
Strapped assassin, ghetto gladiator
Leaving a path of destruction like the motherfucking Terminator
Lurking the streets of hardcore, stalking like a predator
17 shots to the chest made his clothes wetter than mine
Cause the nine'll hit your ass every time
Got my motherfucking b-mo, going straight for the dome
Wig-splitting nigga with the finger on the trigger
Sinister, symptoms of a motherfucking killer
B-I-G to the motherfucking M-E
Double L-O's not a motherfucking ho
But a cutthroat, smiggity smoking niggas like dope
Now bitch don't choke, cause the dick's down your throat
Getting my blast on, nigga get your ass on
Riggy run your ass home cause I'm a bring it on, homes!

[Verse 9: Scarface]
It's the return of the motherfucking dreadlock
Putting fools in headlocks, giving niggas headshots
You don't wanna fuck with me, I ain't that motherfucka
I mean that average, run-of-the-mill ass nigga
You hoes better recognize this nigga that you up against;
Mista mista Scarface ain't that nigga to be fucking with
So lay it down niggas, bump it down or feel the pressure
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's known for taking drastic measures
Quick to rip shit and leave a motherfucker twitching
So niggas make a run once my rifle starts spittin'
Round after round after motherfuckin round
So bitches lay it down, I shut em down, I shut em down!
Screaming for vengeance I swear that I meant this descended
Surrender suspended cause, niggas, I meant it
Calm like an Islamic brother from the Nation
Still got the mind of a motherfuckin mental patient!
I got the chrome to my own dome
But I'm a give you one before I take it home, motherfucka, so, uh

Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah (Repeat 3x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon![Big Mello]
You know it's crazy sometimes, so much drama all around
Make me wanna get the nine, to lay em all down
But I catch myself, put the pistol on the shelf
Take a breath exhale, thank God for my health
Cause shit, somebody out there didn't wake up
Somebody last night, got locked up now
It's the little things, that we take for granted
Just take a wrong move, will get you took out the planet
Slow down lil' homie, it's real in the field
All that bumping bout nothing, will get your cap peeled
See cats ain't boxing, they pulling them straps
And uh niggas don't give a damn, because we rap
See I got muscle, on the strength of my hustle
Cats know Mello bout it, ain't a studio buster
Put it down in these H-Town streets, got stripes in these streets
From the concrete, to marble flo' suites now

[Hook - 2x]
It's those crazy, games we playing
Some of us, out here playing ain't gon make it naw

[Big Mello]
It took a little time, for me to figure out
Exactly, what this game was all about
Hey yeah I was young once, we all go through it
See now I'm so focused, I see right through it
Rule one stack paper, stay away from haters
And you shake these fakers, like dice in Vegas
Now you mind your own business, stay out they face
And uh put some'ing up, because it costs to fight a case
Now you got a camouflage, when you on the grind
Get caught don't snitch playa, do your own time
And never hate the one, who put you down
Cause he'll be the same one, to bail you out
No doubt you can't burn bridges, you might cross again
Never turn your back, on your true friends
See me and my dogs, we play to win
And when the smoke clears, we still standing cause

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
Now these new wave cats, disrespecting the game
Now you know who you are, I mention no names
Naw even in the rain, I contain the stang
While they run around and say, cheat sand in the brain
I sit back puff Jane, hop on the plane
Hit a lick out of town, come back and cop thangs what
Playas know, when it's time to rearrange
And take a new journey, through a new terrain
See I switch patterns, and I stay up and at em
Attack em the first minute, that I spot that it's raggedy
Apply new strategy, avoid the tragedy
Keep it real with the family, haters they mad at me
I'm glad to be, the playa that they love to hate
Now it makes it more easy, to shake the snakes
And I'll watch em fall, just like snow flakes
Now that's the breaks huh, that's the breaks man

[Hook - 3x](*talking*)
Uh uh, it's going down mayn whoo
Man uh, going down mayn

[Big Mello]
Uh, I got it bad like Usher

Shine like clusters, wreck off busters
Huh no doubt, I bring heat call me
The alarm, spit fire like dragon
Oof, come through deuce out the roof
Sitting on ricks, screens show flicks
D's got nicks, and the damn paint wet
Glass 84's, see I'm gold like a vet
Hit licks out of town, first class on jet
Touch down, stretch limo and Moet
Get the do', for the show you know

As far as you scary ass Hollywood niggas, I give's a fuck bout what ya got

But get friendly, when you in a nigga sight iight
Now speak the truth and see who who, and what it do
And who the realest that escaped the shit, and who the damn fool
Check my rap sheet, pull me up check my case
I survived prison riots, without a scar on my face
I did mine never switched, never snitched like a bitch
I beat niggas with clutched fists, you can't fuck with this
I'm the meaning of drama, ran away from my mama
Stood alone broke bones, for the cash rocked domes
Forever H-Town, body rocker slab trunk knocker
On dro, I come through your damn screen like a shocker

[Hook - 2x]

You can't fuck with the infamous, notorious
Bone hard ass nigga, yeah I gotta say this

[Big Mello]
I don't piggy back niggas, I rat-a-tat niggas
I'm known to roam the streets, in a houpe full of killas
We gorillas, still swinging through the South on 3's
The pride of Hiram-Clarke, Sunnyside, Mo City
Ghetto gladiating, I'm beating Satan all the time
On the grind put it down, see Big Mello gon shine
You bitch made I'm homicidal, you suicidal
You paranoid, scary ass nigga I'm right behind you
Cause niggas who talk about it, but see I be about it
I live that phsyco shit, you ho ass niggas rap about it
I been in high speed chases, way before Cops
Nigga what you sold rocks, I moved birds by the flock
Stacked grands before rapping, see the booth and never acting
See real hip-hop, ain't bout fashion or flashing
Or riding niggz dick, yeah to hit the top
I done heard niggas flip flop, to get to a certain spot

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
Southside hall of famer, made a mark in this city
Got game from Ice, K.B., Dre Dolla and Smitty
R.I.P. to fallen soldiers, but the kid still remains
One of the coldest in my era, ask my nigga Lil' James
Yeah fool I stepped out, wanted to get out the red
And I did what I had to do, to keep my family fed
No secret brain was cloudy, but a nigga still rowdy
Went hard in the paint, you ho ass niggas had to foul me
Can't stop me, sloppy carbon copies
I run circles round you feeble minded label ass, wanna be Gotti's
You watching too many movies, I'm a living horror flick
My life my life, Steven King will write about my shit
Beat the odds with God, still living to tell it
Bet a nigga won't pimp me, to sell no records
Gives a fuck about platinum, gives a fuck about gold
Ask these niggas in the streets, they know Mello stone cold what

[Hook - 2x][Big Mello]
I'm trying to stay on feet now, hustling in these streets now
Got to feed my family, if I don't work we don't eat
No time for all that capping, showing off and acting
Brothers with that flashing, just don't know what's happening
Now it ain't what you do it's how you do, keep your bidness on the cool
Stack that paper the golden rule, don't let no one stop you

[Hook - 2x]
Haters they talk down now, playas put it down now
Don't worry how it's going down, what goes around comes around

[Big Mello]
So many haters doubted me, salted me in the industry
Folks and peeps stayed down with me, see I got love in these streets
My so called partnas doing Hollywood, turn they back on the neighborhood
Some cats be up to no good, I pray for them and it's understood
Now everybody got they issues, some smoke their's and some too
Whatever you do do what you do, see I can not judge you

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
Why all that finger pointing, counting people money
High capping and fronting, now you must don't have nothing
Empty wagons make a bunch of noise, men are men and boys are boys
Real is real and fraud is fraud, me I be bone hard now
Stack your paper mayn and maintain, do your thang stay out the rain
Don't let nothing bust your brain, don't worry bout a thang

[Hook - 4x][Hook]

Piss off my niggas, and get a out for that
Deliver niggas to rivers, like UPS
So keep your fucking mouth shut, cause that would be best

And we gon cover for eachother, like umbrellas and vests
From your head to your chest, aiming bout to end it all
You can't game on these niggas, we gon win it all
Check my mack track record, I'm the fastest one
Plus the jack of a lot of trades, and a master son
So if I kill a motherfucker, I'ma trash the gun

Brain buster, jaw fucker feddy doubler
Flake bubbler, known to keep the block cracking
Chicken wrapping, chopper packing thug assassin
Like a corpse, I got no feelings at all
All I got is God, family, artillery and balls
I let em hang blow flames, and fry brains of haters
Deep in this game untamed, focused on power and paper
Over scrill, I'll make your head spill
When I aim this heavy steel it's above your grill, I shoot to kill
Since birth, I been paying dues
Cross my chips slip, and your bitch ass ooze
I keep hundred round tools, ready for the war
Still ducking state troops, with dog proof raw
Fuck the law, (D-Man) Mello and Scoopa-Star
Bone Hard, move too fast and end up toe tagged dead in the morgue

[Hook - 4x][Big Mello]
Look out dog, we got a hater in the mix

And when they fuck with you nigga, they fuck with me
Hold that J and Gene, see we family

Exterminate all insects, and pesky rodents
These niggas, gon recognize
If they get too fly, kiss that ass goodbye

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
I could recall a couple of cats out here, who be hating knowing they shady
But if they come inside of my range, they ain't gon be breathing baby
Lately it seems these niggas be bumping, stronger than ever
Not clever cause I will hurt em, and spray em like rainy weather
And stop em where I drop em, red dot em and then I got em
And block em and then I sock em, till niggas wanna call the cops in
To lock me up, but I ain't going back
Half of these cats be knowing that, as soon as they start to chit-chat
Day I be turning blue black you get that, I'm telling y'all to get back
'Fore I get irritated, and slapping your ass on contact
I mean that believe that, you test that I'll stress that
And make it complicated, for people to get they life back

[Hook - 2x][Hook - 2x]
Motherfucker, do you know me

[C-Note]
I'm that same young nigga, beating down your block
I'm that same young nigga, running up in your spot
I'm that same young nigga, slanging ki's and rocks

Bitches in the beauty shop, screaming we fuck
But the only way we fuck, if I get my dick sucked
Playgirl I ain't coming down, hard in you boo
But some of these niggas, is bitches too
I seen him last week, with his fake Versacci
Lying to these hoes, saying he down with Botany
He said he booked shows, for that Puff and that Mase
And then he wrote the hit song, "Diamonds Up N' Yo Face"
Word on the street, is that I owed him money
And I ain't never even seen him, now ain't that funny
Spreading rumors, that the diamonds in my mouth was fake
That I ain't never freestyled, on a Screwed Up tape
When I catch you in the streets, I won't be squashing the beef
I'll be trying to be putting slugs, all up in your teeth
One shot with a Glock, take him off his feet
Playboy, I'ma put that on my Clover leaf

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
Empty wagons, make a bunch of noise
Off balance ass niggas, drugs stoked y'all boys

Stick dick to your bitch, and she won't say shit
You ho ass niggas don't know, Big Mello or C-Note
Cause fool we connected, you's a stain with toast
Turning foes to ghosts, sipping fo's on the low
Late night frank those, fucking hoes fa sho
Shutting do's on lows, that'll pose the stilo

Steady moving them thangs, you shooting shots on the plane
When the work touch down, putting Jane to the brain

See I'm on it, nobody gonna do for me
What I'ma do for me, gotta feed my family
See I hit the streets, and connect with G's
Hitting stangs po'ing trees, getting love from fiends
I ain't selling no dreams, I get the cream for the team
Making moves, all my hustlers I know you feel me
While they dropping them screens, I'm out here dropping them things
I got no time to bling bling, I'm in it to ching ching
Could say I'm bout the paper mayn, the cash the feddy
All feddy in this game, but I'm so so heavy
Can't trip I can't slip, and if you snooze you lose
In the dope or the liquor, baby need my shoes
Now be nice dykes, backdo' that thang
Point understood, while I'm picking up my change

[Hook - 2x]

I can't look back, I must move on
I keep on pushing, keep on grooving
Ain't no stopping, keep on doing it

[Big Mello]
I'm out here on the block, still pumping and grinding
I gotta get it, if I gotta get dirty and grimey
By any means I'ma do it, stay true to it
See nothing could stop me, I keep it flowing like fluid
I pursue it see I grab it, and I snatch it and stack it
Keep my eyes on these jackers, cause they itching to grab me
I'm bar none, if they coming then they better come with it
I ain't tripping no mo', these haters gonna have to kill me
See I work too hard, to let a hater come and take mine
I don't give a damn bout time, and cross the line fa sho
It go down playa, God as my witness
Cross me or my family, now I'ma take care my bidness
It's survival of the fittest, down in the Clutch City
No pity down here, we get down to the gritty
Come through like Vecard, nation of Smitty
Make em feel me from New York, to that Mo City

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
You see the hustle don't stop, the crime don't quit
I flip the script, and had to get the legit
Don't get it twisted, it's another way gotta stay paid
I still live the good life, thanks to Gene and J
Every way is my way, see I ball with the team
Now we mash for cream, so we can have things
Maintain my focus, and I evade the traps
And many wanna see me relapse, I never collapse
Already they be hating, so I'm cocked and ready
While I'm flipping through this saint john, biscuit and jelly
All my homies in the streets, keep on doing your thang
See game peep game, you got to maintain
It feel good to be free, now you can take it from me
You see life ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seems
Stay alert my niggas, don't let em see you sweat

Bitch look can't fuck with a team, that's straight from the streets and all about cream
Garunteed to make motherfuckers bleed, by any means we going hard for the green
Uh-huh said that represent that feel that, like the grow wind beat that rip rap
Snap a ledge just to kill all the chit-chat, flipping rounds ain't no way around that
Cross the line and you ain't gon come back, if I said that lil' bitch I meant that
And I think just to knock your hair back, and for the click I get down with that

[Hook - 2x](*talking*)
Remind me to whoop your ass good, next time I see you

[Hook - 2x]
I make it niggy-niggy-knock y'all
Up and down, the biggy-block y'all
And now you know, it don't stop y'all
And now you know I got ya, all y'all

[Big Mello]
I stick my finger in the ground, and turn the whole world round
I make all these little playa hating punks, bow down
Move around right about now, I got this locked
My Southside body rock, keep trunks on knock
I rock spots keep it hot, and it's me yo mi caliente
What que paso ese, me el presidente
Don Dada, I set it off like Osama
Blow the spot like uni-bombers, see I bring the drama
My raps attack tracks, emcees back-back
Step to me on that mic, I'm like lyrical anthrax
Deadly track assassin, known for smashing and crashing
Egotistical rappers, I drop em all like Cassius
Burn they asses to ashes, shatter em like glasses
Whether flipping my tongue, or flowing slow as molasses
I'm classic like Coke, my flows hook em like dope
And when it's all said and done, it was murder I wrote

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
It's the return of the body rocker, trunk knocker
Hip hopper, making woofers sing like an opera
When I creep I beat the block up, with my gangsta boogie
Working wood like a vet, now watch me swang on these rookies
Lil' cats move around, when my slab come down
I pop a trunk lighting up, Southside H-Town
I'm a 84 swanger, gator backbone crawler
I-10 eighteen wheel, heavyweight hauler
Big boss giving orders, Hiram-Clarke night stalker
Bout it bout it like them boys, way down in New Orleans
See I make the trunk beat huh, break the concrete
My amps overheat, when I peep

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
I come down chunk the deuce, out the damn Hollywood
Sideways on Rick's, working wood looking good
I swang through the Southside, fuck a god damn vine
I put them swangas in your life, and all you jackers gon mind
Run up on me I'm dumping, I bar none fade all
I'ma crawl through the South, West, East and the Nawf
Tal'n bout what it do, don't like it nigga fuck you
Swang on me, you get your ass ran through
Already cocked and ready, strap lay by my belly
Coming down knocking Nelly, on biscuit and jelly
Represent the damn South, out of town I act bad
Down here we don't rent, we pay our shit straight cash
All you video cappers, with them borrowed ass Bentleys
Fuck your motherfucking 20's, what you do don't offend me
I ain't barring that foreign, I hit the slab on 4's
With them low pro fo's, Southside gon hold

[Hook - 4x](*talking*)
Uh yeah, just reminiscing a lil' bit
You know I'm tal'n bout, this goes out to my homeboy
Sheldon, know I'm tal'n bout

[Big Mello]
We use to talk and walk and stalk the halls, of J-Y High
Spitting game to these shoppers, smoking fry getting high
Leave the school house, making noise all over the city
I'm in the Regal with Bell, you in the Cutlass with Smitty
Two young lil' playas, all the G's cutted fo'
Down for whatever, and loved by hoes
Showing up at the club, getting nothing but love
Posted up straight thugging, nigga fly as a dub
Shell shocked I sho miss ya, nigga why you leave me
All you had to do was holla homie, if you needed me
I never thought, that you would take your life
When I was stressed and down and out, you kept me tight
But damn nigga, it ain't too many more real niggas
It's like I'm trapped in a zone, around these fake ass niggas
But I'ma keep it real, keep striving for the mill
Don't worry bout these playa hating niggas, out here
Yeah fool I'm still laughing, reminiscing on the fun times
Playing in the sunshine, flipping out of town
But I'ma hold it down, keep it real stay true
It's Southside for life, and nigga riding for you

[Hook - 4x]
My niggas (my niggas), my niggas (my niggas)
Man, man I sure miss my niggas

[Big Mello]
I remember all the stunts, that had me laughing for months
And all the times that we wrecked the concerts, getting crunk
Blowing blunts on the hunt, for the hoes in the crowd
A nigga tripping on stage, and had em screaming real loud
Kept a pistol in your pocket, yeah my nigga stayed strapped
Sucker free, and when it's time to scrap we had eachother back
Showing up at the Carro, leaning on drank
Ask Pac before the bank, huh smoking killer dank
Shit me and you Dre huh, Trent and B.T
Huh K.B., Melvin, Doug and N.V
Shit and that O.D., conversating with hoes
Lifting weights Big Rob, a nigga stuck on swoll
Damn dog, I know you was a G no lie
I remember you hit the church, and sang in the choir
Now, I know you in a better place
And man I'd give anything, to see your smiling face

[Hook - 4x]

[Big Mello]
Now we live so fast, and die so young
And so many cats, done lost they life to a gun
Cause yo we under pressure, but keep it together
Get your chips and have fun, cause it don't last forever
I thank the Lord everyday, I got a chance to strive
For the prize it's a blessing man, just to be alive
Jesus gone, and true playas and ballers
Kinda hard to swallow, sometime it make me wanna holla
But shit I'm like damn, not my man
Young brother young brother, man you just don't undertsand
Now you control your destiny, and take it from me
I'm so glad I ain't back, where I use to be
I keep moving on, and blow a sweet or two
I keep banging my Screw, and wear the red or blue
And take a chill recognize, it's a beautiful life
Now keep your game tight, and try to live right

[Hook - 4x]

(*talking*)
Uh know I'm saying, all my homeboys out there
You know I'm tal'n bout, man y'all keep y'all head up
You know I'm tal'n bout man, a nigga don't wanna lose no mo' real niggas man
You know I'm tal'n bout, all my partnas man
All my dead homies man I miss all y'all, you know I'm tal'n bout
Try to hold it down man keep living, you know I'm tal'n bout all my niggas[Big Mello]
H-Town, you know it go down
Southside body rock, make em wanna show surround
I know they hate it, but we bout that cash
We be on slow boogie, boys moving too fast
I break it down, flip flop it and lock it
Keep the cash in my pocket, still shocking and rocking
Hit the club, tal'n bout what it do
I can show up, this slab or hoo-doo
Come down, don't crush your leather
I break boys off, and type of weather
If it flodd, I could hop on the road
Call Jimmy J, be like Mello let's go
Po'd up, stay dro'd up
Got the little mama, now it's time to power up
Y'all haters, gon recognize
The El Cap-i-tan, starship enterprise

[Hook - 2x]
Party on the dance floor, party people want more
Time to hear some'ing, from the Southside G
Big Mello, coming through the backdo'
Still representing, these H-Town streets

[Big Mello]
In Vegas, with the gangsta strut
Headline next day, H-Town showed up
Been wrecking, these boys for years
Piece and chain hard start, big rock in one ear
Some cats, be fly as broads
These pretty boy flaws, can't fade Bone Hard
Southside, come down all the time
Body rock and put it down, all across state line
Y'all know, where the real ballers be
From the Homestead, to the Mo City
Can't stop the grind, can't stop the shine
Even though they talk down, on this dirty H-Town
I don't bump, in the magazines
I drop these jewels, make you haters feel me
Bone Hard, from the heart of H.C
'Member me 'member me, still sucker free

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]

Keep on trunk knocking, keep on top dropping

See I'm a freak, but I play by the rules hey

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]

[Hook - 2x](*talking*)

[Big Mello]
Watch me come through, tal'n bout what it do
Hop out who-do, trunk knock with that Screw
Ain't nothing changed, see I'm still true blue
Hit my licks, but I keep em on the cool huh
I'm a damn fool huh, KMJ the crew
Already heavy like a Cheve, bout the feddy
On scrill break limits, shred rappers like confeddi
Grip the damn grain, pinky ring keep it steady
I'm the body rocker, represent the Southside
Even when I'm high, keep that money on my mind
So I grind, T on my side we gotta shine
Hoes gon mind, cause they know the ice blind
All the time, see I gotta wreck
Cash a damn check, keep my shit up in your deck
The architect designer, hustler slash rhymer
Candy paint niggas, I'm the base like primer
What big timer, Big Mello
Big thang nigga, stack big pesos
Me and Z-Ro, J and Geno
On the Q track, keep the flow so thoed
I'ma body rock ya, from your head to your toe
Boys can't see, Mello and Z-Ro
Only at the show, late night video
Hiram-Clarke/Mo City, what Mafioso

[Z-Ro]
Ridgemont 4 representer, niggas wonder where I went
Bending corners in a Intrepid, fo' do' behind tint
Making stacks upon stacks upon stacks, of B. Franklin
Anybody running up on KMJ, will be stanking
I might be shermed out, I might be smoking on that drizzo
Anyway it go, I'm still gon put a tag on your big toe
Ask Eugene, we killers with automatic machine
Knocking over walls when we crawl, keeping our mug on mean
If you got a sensitive side, get up out my ride
Cause it's sho to be some pistol play, probably homicide
If you's a snitch nigga bitch nigga, I'm digging your ditch
Giving out dome calls, leaving everybody wigless
I'm gonna, give a nigga a headstone
Cause I'm after my paper, mama say go get it even though she dead and gone
Smoke and dranking with alphabets, to tighten my lip
With a dirty gar beam for busters, hitting em right in they hip
I'm a guerilla, do anything it take to make scrilla
Even if one of my own gotta fall, fuck y'all niggas
I'm one of a kind, and ain't no bitch got my mind
I don't need a relationship, as long as I got my nine

[Trae]
Tell me the truth, why do these cats be thinking that they could be fucking with us
Really though I don't know, but they don't wanna be running with us
I'm out that Southsi' for li', for li' until I die
KMJ coming up out of the storm, for real that ain't no lie
With Dougie D and Z-Ro, we making a pay to break bread
If somebody fucking with Big Mello, my slug hit em in they head
Ain't no disrespecting my team, or my team'll get aggravated
All you mark ass motherfuckers better duck, or you infiltrated

[Ghetto]
See I'm a Dirty South talker, philly blunt sparker
Telling hoes to come on down, like Bob Barker
Never been a stalker, man fuck a bitch
All a bitch can do for a pimp, is make me rich
Hit the switch in a mothership, with bump in the trunk
I ain't tripping on no haters, I got that pump in the trunk
And I'm ready to dump, up on a bitch ass nigga
Cause ain't no Blood'n or Crip'n, cause we from Texas nigga
Shit we all about, our cash flow
Don't play no games, or you'll end up with a tag up on your big toe
It's that nigga Mello, and that nigga Ghetto
Coming through your backdo', bitch what they hitting fo'
Some playas, down here
Don't bring your girl, cause we hot pussy slayers down here
Done hooked up with my nigga Daz Dili', from the motherfucking West
Burning holes in you niggas chest, like you was smoking on some stress
Or that bomb-bomb, nigga from Vietnam
Nigga ring the motherfucking alarm, cause it's on
I got my nigga JJ, in a zone
Nigga motherfucker, tell that bitch to bring it on
I don't know why, niggas wanna try but try
But the only think I know, that your niggas'll die
If they fucking, with the KMJ click
If you don't like it, get up off the Southside dick bitch

[Cl'Che]
If you wonder where I'm at, this guerilla at
I'm shining in your face, if you haven't seen me yet
I'm a Southsi' for li', hot girl
Rocking with the Big Mello, and the Crooked Z-Ro
Quick to break the hoes, off
While we dropping tops, we got you dropping your mouth
Cl'Che representing for the South, the Dirty South
Ask that Q, these haters put em in line
Big Mello above the Cl', Z-Ro on the side of Cl'
So I'm telling you, ain't none of that getting close to Cl'
I play with big boys, that move them big thangs
C.D.'s and LP's, so we can get a bigger name
KMJ, we gon stick to your brain like cement
Glass get em Monroe, we flyer than bird shit
It's me, now tell me what you see
A list mouth motherfucker, with a cold mouthpiece
R.I.P. to my G's and chicks, we still swanging them do's
Candy riding on 4's, and niggas polishing they golds
Down here, Southsi' for li'
Houston Texas, just to make it all clear[Z-Ro talking]
Yes indeed, H-Town, it go down Lil' Flex, Z-Ro, Big Mello
Know what I'm saying, you boys can't stop us man
Unstopable, feel me, yeah
They got to feel us till they kill us, this for the radio

[Lil' Flex]
Ain't nothing but a g thang baby
Turnel sets dried yellow bones crazy
Can't fade me, died lately
Pulling out the escallade or a mercedes
Trunk popper, show stopper, drank sipper
Rule number one is to never tip a stripper
And I know a lot of y'all want to wish me trouble
Went from swanging hoo-doos to a bentley bubble
Image is everything, diamonds in every ring
Piece and chains that hang down low to my dang-a-lang
Stop that, cop that, I'm a baller baby
Got the rims that poke out on the prowler baby
I'm the same young cat that dropped the jewels on them
Next year I'm about to drop 22's on them
From the Mo to the Fo, back to airport landing
Diamonds speak for theyself, Flex so outstanding

[Chorus]
Still standing, and you know we represent the south
And ya know ya know we represent the south
Still standing, we in the door and these haters can't keep us out

[Big Mello]
I represent that S-O-U-T-H to the S-I-D-E
Drop screens you can see me completely
Off the heezy, fa sheezy I'm breezy
Cause my diamonds they be known to blind hoes like Stevie
Believe me, outstanding with my family
From me and Z-Ro and Lil' Flex at the grammy
Boss player from Texas, you could tell by the necklace
We gone break these hoes on four's now we frozen the Lexus
My protected, move around, get around
Come through show some round when we hit your town
It go down, whoa now, school slow down
Watch these fours roll down crawl down your block
Top drop, trunk knock, Glock cocked
And these shops gone bop, it don't stop
Won't stop, how it go down
Harm clock, Mo City, south west still shine, wooo

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Screwed up representer these fellas don't want none
From the land of the trunk poppers where ballers blow tons
We stacking funds, and living our life out on the run
In search of a platinum plack trying to get stacks it just begun
If you talking down move around we ain't having that
East and West took it before but see we came to grab it back
Can't see us like cataracts, off in our natural habitat
That's the studio and bro you know ain't no more selling crack
Ain't nothing but rocking trash talking on down to the ain't that
Cause I'm a veteran to this here ever since the days of the Wave Band
When I was knee high to a grass hopper but now we roll on chppers
Me and Gene hovering over the ground in candy helicopters
Now we platinum status without driving a dodge stratus
Keeping it gangsta energy instinct with a heater to protect us
Man it's third coast, to me our music mean the most
Big Mello and Lil' Flex and Z-Ro the crooked as your folks and we

[Chorus - 2x](*talking*)
Uh, know I'm tal'n bout
Look out, already

[Big Mello]
Hey baby, can I take a minute of your sweet time
To express these thoughts, they are heavy on my mind
Don't mean to be aggressive, but I got to do it
I see something that I like, and I gotta pursue it
I know you probably got a gang of cats, shooting they shot
Talking bout what they got, you know like mansions and yachts
And how they love to run up in you, to me I'm kinda different
See I wanna get to know you, can we start with dinner
What you like Maggianos, maybe Papa Deauxx
We can do the Tex-Mex baby, listen to Tejano
I'm cool cause about now, it's all about you
And baby girl give me a chance, and I can show you what it do
For real see it's your presence, that got me mesmerized
Excuse me, if I come off a little too fly
And mama now I can see it in your eyes, you feel me
Think about it here's my number, call me the realest and I

[Hook (Big Mello) - 2x]
Tell me what you want, girl it's all on you
I ain't tripping baby girl, tell me what it do
Tell me what you want, now it's all on you
I ain't tripping baby girl, tell me what it do

[Cl'Che]
Hold up let me think about it, boy you so real
Ain't nobody ever came to me like that, what's the deal
Now I feel very flattered, see I'm peeping your stees'
I can tell you might be the one, to put me at ease
Some guys they come too fly, I pass on by
I say hi but that's far as it goes, no lie
I like movies dinner's cool, but see I play by the rules
If it's meant then it can happen, and that's when I choose
You know brothers be with, I can buy you this I can buy you that
But with me, I wanna see where your heart is at
We can hook up, I'm digging your style
You so fly, you can put that what thug in my life come on

[Hook (Cl'Che) - 4x]
Now tell me what you want, boy it's all on you
I ain't tripping baby boy, tell me what it do

[Big Mello]
I been in and out relationships, with all kind of chicks
And gold diggers and cheating tricks, and scandalous nit-wits
I like em independent, strong and physically fit
One that can hold a conversation, plus open minded
You see you got me addicted, see me and you we could kick it
Take me away from the wicked, elevate me and lift me
To another level next plateau, I'm so fa sho
Me and you we can do things, we never did befo' let's go
Now I don't wanna waste my lifetime, running round
All I wanna know, baby will you be mine I'm for real
See I'm coming from, my heart and my soul
And it's the only way I know, and if you down we can roll now let's go

[Hook (both) - 4x]
