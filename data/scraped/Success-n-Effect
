“Blueprint” b/w “Rhymes That Thrill Ya”

Umoja/WRAP/Ichiban Records
Production: Artist, Eddy “Dope” Irons
Rating: 3

Sporting the Black Panthers’ “10 Point Program For Freedom Of The Original Man” on the record jacket, Success-N-Effect project a powerful image of Black nationalism and positivity. “Blueprint” loops portions of Chuck Brown’s classic “Bustin’ Loose” to create a funky hook. Science is dropped regarding Black on Black crime, male/female relations in the Black community, and the need for unity. This is not the first Afrocentric consciousness-raising jam, but the positive message rings true and the hook is in there.

     The flip-side is a bit of a letdown as SNE come at you with a Miami-bass freestyle track that totally contrasts with “Blueprint.” The music is way too fast for my taste and the rhyme delivery is a little flat, but definitely check out the A-side“Blueprint” b/w “Rhymes That Thrill Ya”
