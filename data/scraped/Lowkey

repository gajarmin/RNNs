I make them see a-n-d. let you know the c-a-s-e
From LDN not NYC, on the m-i-c I'm M.I.B.,
Like BIG the MVP, VIP to the e-n-d
E.g., my CD, is way to d-e-e-p
That goes for your TV screen, DVD or BBC
ITN or ITV, C-O-Ps say "ID please"
S-t-o-p like IC3, wanna see me hooked to an IV, g
In the ICU but Im n-o-t, they went OT with the m-o-b
Can't see me through the f-o-g
Don't cuss mothers of S.O.B's
These MC's are OAPs
Wanna hype up I'm like "okay, g."
You think you're b-a-d
Get a p-e-n and a p-a-d
If the CIA and the FBI, the MI6 and the MI5
Jump on the A3 then I drive, turn up the A/C, FYI
MJ like P.Y.T,, lol I never T.Y.P
I e-a-t on E.I.D, twist the C.I.D like Levi Jeans
D-i-e like BNP; EDL just BFG's.
Youths don't want no GCSE's they want C.O.D. on the PS3
I'm like DP, or PE, or KRS from BDP
Download this on your MP3
Send it to your MP & MTV
You're not on this thing like A.D.D
Your CD I rate PG
Like KKK's with AK's
My A.K.A is AA
Take you off the road ASAP
DDT these JLS MC's
What you just saw basically
Is how to murder the ABC's
Cause I'm back in the booth
Rappers wanna chat about the strap they got stashed in the back of their boot
But I chat to the youths
Abstract or backpack my attributes and stack to the roof
I capture the truth
Pour it on tracks with my views, and I'll sell it out the back of the boot
I'm positive you're negative, you're whack and confused
I'm back and the fact is your dad's in the room
Ain't a track that you rappers can battle with
Every track that I spat is immaculate
Any track that I smash, I'm attacking it
Heard you rap fam, your tracks are inadequate
Your CD was kak, it was crap, I'm dashing it
You follow fashion with rap, I'm passionate
Blood start splashing you, whip you're dashing it
Said you were packing a mac in the back of it
Kizzy, I'm busy, I'm really a brilliant guy
It's gritty and shitty but really the city is mine
If you dis me, pity the silly billy to try
From bricky to Piccadilly to Mississippi I'm live
Getting rid of you Milli Vanilli's, gimme the vibe
Get jiggy like Willy spitting the wittiest rhymes
Uncivilised, ignorant, diligent type
And I victimize an idiot a million times
Hey hey, we ray rays and sway flames
Take snakes of the road like AA
So waste brays, vacate, and make space
You bait fakes ain't straight, you stay fake
We chase papes, you chase days like day way
On a late day you date fakes and save face
In the same place, we maintain and ain't changed
We make tapes that rape pace like Keslane
Don't diss this or miss this we live this from Lisbon to Ipswich
For instance the dick's got your sister addicted
Oh look, big tits came for a quick fix
You're limper than Bizkit you nitwits
A monster, a beast, when I stomp on the beat
If the nonsense you speak is not gonna cease
Unconscious belief, some conscious MCs
Don't respond to the beef if your nonsense is meep
Get ill up on the rhythm when I kill 'em on a lyrical
Finish up my dinner then I drill 'em with a syllable
Don't really care what you did and what you didn't do
Little fools are minuscule, spitting isn't difficult
You find your mind cause I'm out of mine
Fuck a pound sign, came for the crown of grime
I told you once, I told you a thousand times
I'm a fountain of acid, you're alkaline
You alcoholics are out of line
Got a mountain to climb if your mouth is lying
Bow to his highness, I'm bound to shine
Let me coach you on vocals and how to rhyme
Think I'm vexed with your in-directs
If I spit rhymes next I will slit five necks
I'm a big time threat, to your piss sly vects
This guy lives life inside stress
I'm the best in the game, not impressed with the fame
I'm testing my aim if I send for your name
The successful are lame, they kept it the same
But whatever the weather, it's destined to change
Couldn't give a fuck for your creps and your chains
You slobber on the mic like a sket giving brain
I'm mental, deranged, crush temples and frames
My pencil will end you like perpetual flames
Burn like syphilis, you nerds are privileged
When I die you can say that you heard the sickest spit
My verse it limitless, the earth is spinning quick
Pure words of wickedness that I merk the rhythm with
Heard you were good, It's a shame that you're not
Don't care about your chain or the fame that you got
Keep my name on your brain cause I came for your spot
What you're making is pot, they say it's a lot
You're whack bro with your kak flow
But you're whack though put ya cap low
Prat go back home
This monster is stronger than Castro's backbone
I attack those little Fapo Caso's
Don't ever get arrogant
Don't start panicking, phone your management
Mumbling, mannering that man are getting mad again
Don't care about your swagger, mandem, or medallion
What's the matter then, magger where's your magnum?
When there's beef, mandem are missing like Madeleine
I've been badder than you and your bag of men
What's happening when I kill 'em with a pad and pen
Ain't got the bars in your pad to match me
Me I'm so fast, you should catch a taxi
Have you got the picture like Paparazzi?
You lack the facts that go back-to-back, b
When I watch you rappers, It's like crazy comedy
I got a 'don't rate this fake g' policy
Fuck ya rewards, I don't rate these nominees
Just little fickle Jay-Z wannabes
You hobos are old and It's oh so true
No promo, logo, or photo-shoot
Fuck your postcode, mobile, and polo suit
My opponents are hoping I won't go true
I'm certainly burning these burglars verbally
Merking these merkers 'til mercenaries murder me
Burstin' and turnin' your burberry burgundy
Guernsey to Germany, Jersey to Bermondsey
True rhymes, ain't got a pen? You can use mine
Ain't stayin' underground like a tube line
I'mma come through and shine, in due time
Which one of you pricks said I can't do grime?
Jungle crosser, nonsense stopper
Continent stomper, the conscious monster
The freedom fighter, deepest writer
Beat up cyphers, the peoples' rhymer
I'm bond to get iller, the sound effects killer
The Malcolm X spitter, the alphabet killer
Not a player hater, lady dater
Maybe later a baby maker
I get slept on like old pajamas
Will I blow up like boats in the harbor?
You spit fire, I'm molten lava
Flow so cold I scold Jafada
Sold your soul for gold and Prada
Who do you know who's flow goes harder?
It's over partner, you know the answer
Drop bombs on the rhythm, no Obama
Baseline murderer, fake guy hurter, race line herder
Face flying all over the place like furniture
I'm back so hard might break my vertebrate
Beat breaker, heat taker, sheet of paper cremater, since a teenager
DJs can't be BKRs cause if they do they'll get PAR'd
I'm back so let me see, the facts are very deep
You prats will never see, I rap to any beat
Pack the pen and plea, practice every week
Attack the melody, and smash my enemies
Not a cenbro, But you're getting dough
With a bent flow jacking off Jay-Z like a little klepto
And the tempo went slow
Done a lot in my lifetime, I was retro
Everybody bow to the kind cause he's back
Whether or not radio was in his track
Forget Nas and his dad, I'm bridging the gap
You think it's just rap, but it's bigger than that
If it's tit for tat, I got the gift of the gat
What you spit is just shit, blood, stick to the facts
You itch like a cat that's addicted to crack
I'm sick of you Prats, cause you shitheads is whack
I'm a g, any beat, I will damage
Very deep, whether it be grime or garage
Enemies better flee, I won't have it
You'll never be ahead of me you blind old maggot
If you really really live crime, don't chat it
If you really really got a 9, go grab it
Then, if you're live, don't hide, don't panic
Just ride like a psycho that might go manic
Don't settle with the rest, cause I'm better than the best
Not just clever, yes I'm intelligent and best you
Better invest in some weapons and a vest
You veterans are vexed, irrelevant and stressed
Keep telling us your rep, but you never get respect
You fed up cause seven of your regiments are messed
You could get a bit of press for that ice on your neck
It's not credit, it's a debt
I'm here for the beat, just save all the nonsense
Murk it whether a rave or a concert
When I'm on stage, make way for the monster
Key to the Game: I came, toured, and conquered
Spit on your bars, I spray more for longer
You spit boring, chainsaw's are stronger
You're a boxer, wait, you're a mobster
Ain't got time for fake Ford impostors
I'm a champ, deep MC and it's blatant
But tramps wanna sleep on me like a pavement
When I speak, I leave them chiefs in amazement
Meanest genius, I'm free like a mason
But I don't sleep with police at the station
I'm writing my rhymes, you're completing your statement
Running from the swine while you're eating your bacon
Don't rip beats, I beat them and break 'em
Most MCs don't believe them or rate 'em
It's no secret, these nincs are just hating
Keep on saying that my team is inflaming
Light fire like them trees that you're blazing
Double P, trouble we, there'll be an invasion
Test us? Get left deep in the basement
Don't care whether you're from Ealing or Leyton
Middle Eastern or Asian...
Little man never did exams
Got a particular bigger plan flippin' grams
'Til a bigger man in his gang gave him a stick to bang
Or maybe just hold cause no one thought he would kill a man
'Till he caught a silly billy villain, chillin' in a jam
Sippin' champs, spliff in his hand, trigger ready to jam...
Bang bang biddy bang biddy biddy bang
Now he's in a camp thinkin' "Damn, what a pity fam."
Rappers are yapping and flapping their lips
'Bout how they're packing and clapping their sticks
Has to be big, the impact it has on the kids
Tell me where the factory is
When the government kill, they're just stacking their chips
You wonder why the youths are strapped and they're pissed
If not a nine, it's a knife getting jabbed in your ribs
People die for the petrol, the gas in the whip
In London, you can get shanked in the heart
Still the government put more tanks in Iraq
Ignorant little spitters are talking greasy
Cause they bitten bitties that they saw on TV
If all you rap about is the hoes and the dough
It's already too late, you sold 'em your soul
You jokers act like you know but you don't
Cause there's little kids dying all over the globe
Many say they know what revolution could be
But many don't know what revolution would mean
It would mean blood, it would mean pain
But it could be us to bring that change
Little hypocrites are spittin' typical nonsense
I'm a black bull because of political content
Laugh at my people while you criminals bomb them
Militant on the rhythm, I'm killing you on the song then
History you won't read in a textbook
Kunta Kinte, I bleed from my left foot
Never see me on the TV with Jedwards
Tell the BBC they need me on Westwood[Intro]
So, we must ask ourselves
What is the dictionary definition of "Terrorism"?
The systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion
But what is terror?

According to the dictionary I hold in my hand, Terror, is violent or destructive acts
Such as bombing committed by groups in order to intimidate a population
Or government into granting their demands

So what's a terrorist?

[Hook]
They're calling me a terrorist
Like they don't know who the terror is
When they put it on me, I tell them this
I'm all about peace and love
They calling me a terrorist
Like they don't know who the terror is
Insulting my intelligence
Oh how these people judge

[Verse 1]
It seems like the Rag-heads and Paki's are worrying your Dad
But your dad's favourite food is curry and kebab
It's funny but it's sad how they make your mummy hurry with her bags
Rather read The Sun than study all the facts
Tell me, what's the bigger threat to human society
BAE Systems or home made IED's
Remote controlled drones killing off human lives
Or man with home made bomb committing suicide
I know you were terrified when you saw the towers fall
It's all terror but some forms are more powerful
It seems nuts how could there be such agony
When more Israeli's die from peanut allergies
It's like the definition didn't ever exist
I guess it's all just dependent on who your nemesis is
Irrelevant how eloquent the rhetoric peddler is
They're telling us fibs, now tell us who the real terrorist is

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Lumumba was democracy - Mosadegh was democracy
Allende was democracy - Hypocrisy it bothers me
Call you terrorists if you don't wanna be a colony
Refuse to bow down to a policy of robberies
Is terrorism my lyrics?
When more Vietnam vets kill themselves after the war than die in it?
This is very basic
One nation in the world has over a thousand military bases
They say it's religion, when clearly it isn't
It's not just Muslims that oppose your imperialism
Is Hugo Chavez a Muslim? Nah.. I didn't think so
Is Castro a Muslim? Nah.. I didn't think so
It's like the definition didn't ever exist
I guess it's all just depending who your nemesis is
Irrelevant how eloquent the rhetoric peddler is
They're telling us fibs, now tell us who the terrorist is

[Hook]

[Outro]
You think that I don’t know
But I know, I know, I know
You think that we don’t know
But we know

You think that I don’t know
But I know, I know, I know
You think that we don’t know
But we DO

[Outro]
Was Building 7 terrorism?
Was nano-thermite terrorism?
Diego Garcia was terrorism
I am conscious the Contras was terrorism
Phosphorous that burns hands – that is terrorism
Irgun and Stern Gang that was terrorism
What they did in Hiroshima was terrorism
What they did in Fallujah was terrorism
Mandela ANC – they called terrorism
Gerry Adams IRA – they called terrorism
Erik Prince Blackwater – it was terrorism
Oklahoma, McVeigh – that was terrorism
Everyday USA – that is terrorism
Everyday UK – that is terrorism

From West End to the West Bank
I write righteous rhymes with my right and wrestle the devil with my left hand
Never work for a Zionist, never been a yes man
My art is like Rembrandt painting pictures of death camps
The average person is allergic to the words of wisdom
This is for everyone of Saddam's Kurdish murder victims
And all the pure souls that never had the chance to speak
Truth pumps in my arteries and causes my heart to beat
For soldiers haunted and tortured by guilty memories
Who realised too late to reveal their real enemy
It's all dead wrong
For every victim of racist persecution from Auschwitz to Hebron
My words may sting cowards
For people that were atomised by the Thermite in the Twin Towers
Those living through the wars
Ask me what I do this for
Put the world in its place before it put you in yours

[Hook]

What happens under darkness shall come to light
Can't silence us even though you try

Keep my third eye hidden under my New York fitted
A crazy unmarried man that deserves to be committed
The future is encrypted in my troubled lyrics
Dream that I've been somewhere for weeks, then wake up in a couple minutes
Sweat dripping with visions of population control
Thoughts overflowing my world like the melting of the North Pole
My people are targeted by military crack committees
So I'm bucking at the feds like natives in Rapid City
Reality savage, my words are like a riot in Paris
The voice of the voiceless, that voice is social imbalance
So stand strong or sit harder in your mental palace
Blinded inside a Kingdom united to its old habits
But now, Middle Passage coming, War Chant, African drumming
Gatling gun humming
Rapid fire mechanism, reckless living
That checks the rhythm of perfectionism
Slave condition
While you're singing God save the system

Detain my body, but you can't imprison my mind
If it's my time I'll probably die with my fist in the sky
These are the thoughts of a man who can't escape from his coma
Cries of a young virgin girl who got raped by them soldiers

[Immortal Technique]
Birthing a screaming bastard, post colonial nation
Subject to childhood diseases, famine, war and inflation
Education molded you into your masters image
And you forgot who the fuck you were before the war was finished

[Lowkey]
You're hearing the ghosts of Nagasaki, You're hearing Hiroshima
Beautiful babies being born with the weirdest features
You might never see me in the charts
But Inshallah my seed can see peace in Iraq

[Immortal Technique]
But peace and freedom can never be given
That's historically forbidden, Cos only collision is the recipe
Changing the course of destiny
So I'm strapped with weaponry

[Lowkey & Immortal Technique]
Cause the government don't give a fuck about protecting me

If my mother got angry or frustrated with me, she'd say..."oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya"
...and the basic translation of that is "Oh,how beautiful is freedom"
But where is freedom
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Where is our freedom?

[Hook]
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya

[Verse 1]
This is for Baghdad, the place of my mothers birth
The cradle of civilization, for what it’s worth
The land I’ve never seen, culture I’ve never known
Iraq is in my heart, my blood, my flesh and bones
The air I’ve never breathed, fragrance I’ve never smelt
The pride I never had, the nationality that I never felt
Saddam was bad, are the American’s even more so?
They made me groan like I was missing part of my torso
But I never picked up a grenade in my garden
I never saw people I love die starving
I never saw my family die through many years of sanctions
While the ruler’s family lived in palaces and mansions
Never had a family member kidnapped for a ransom
Never lost a friend to violence that was random
Bombings, occupation, torture, intimidation
A million dead people doesn’t equal liberation
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Listen!
Where is our freedom?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Forget division based on ethnicity or religion
Whether you Sunni, Shia, Kurdish or Christian
Pain is still pain if you’re a person that’s missing
We all deserve a life in this earth that we live in
Is there enough words that can say
How deeply Baghdad is burnin' today
And it’s not about pity, hands out or sympathy
It’s about pride, respect, honour and dignity
Babies being born with deformities from uranium
Those babies aren’t just Iraqi, they’re Mesopotamian
What I view on the news is making me shiver
Cause I look at the victims and see the same face in the mirror
This system of division makes it harder for you and me
Peace is a question, the only answer is unity
So many dreams about this place that I’ve never seen
The place my family had to leave in the 70’s
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Where is our freedom?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

It rains white phosphorus in Fallujah
This is for those that won’t live to see the future
Sorry that I wasn’t there, Sorry that I couldn’t help
I’m sorry for every tear, Sorry you’ve been put through hell
Still I feel like an immigrant, Englishman amongst Arabs and an Arab amongst Englishmen
Like I said they never gave me the culture
But they did give me Kubdad Haleb,Hakaka and Dolma
Ana isme Kareem
Wa ohmre thalatha wa-’ishrun
Umi min Baghdad, wa abuya min Dover
And that’s the combination that I carry on my shoulders
Still I rep, till my death, till they kill and steal my flesh
From now all the way back to Gilgamesh
Such a villianized and criticized nation
You will always be the cradle of civilization
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Where is our freedom?

[Hook]
In my sleep, in my dreams Motherland I can still feel you calling me
In my sleep, in my dreams Motherland I can still feel you calling me
In my sleep, in my dreams Motherland I can still feel you calling me
I can still feel you calling me
I can still feel you calling me[Intro: Lowkey]

This is for Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
This is for the child that is searching for the answer
I wish I could take your tears and replace them with laughter
Long live Palestine, Long live Gaza!!

Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
This is for the child that is searching for an answer
I wish I could take your tears and replace them with laughter
Long live Palestine, Long live Gaza!!

[Verse 1: Lowkey]

While we listen to tunes, made by ignorant fools
Israel blocked the UN from delivering food
They'll bring in the troops and you won't even glimpse at the news
They make money of the products that we are quick to consume
It's not simply a question of differing views
Forget emotions, this is fact, what I spit is the truth
Makes no difference if you're a Christian or if you're a Jew
They are just people living in different conditions to you
They still die when you bomb their schools, mosques and hospitals
It is not because of rockets, please god can you stop it all
I'm not related to the strangers on the TV
But I relate because those strangers could have been me
Words can never ever explain the raw tragedy
It's not a war they're just murdering more rapidly
We are automatically supporting pure savagery
Imagine how you'd feel if this was your family

[Hook A]
Free my people, long live Palestine
We will never let you go

[Hook B: Lowkey]

Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine

[Verse 2: Lowkey]

Palestine remains in my heart forever
We stand for peace, in times of war we shan't surrender
Remember, it didn't start in that dark December
Every coin is a bullet, if you're Mark's and Spencer
And when you're sipping Coca-Cola
That's another pistol in the holster of the soulless soldiers
You say you know about the Zionist lobby
But you put money in their pocket when you're buying their coffee
Talking about revolution, sitting in Starbucks
The fact is that's the type of thinking I can't trust
Let alone even start to respect
Before you talk learn the meaning of that scarf on your neck
Forget Nestlé
Obama promised Israel 30 billion over the next decade
They're trigger happy and they're crazy
Think about that when you're putting Huggies nappies on your baby

[Hook A]
Free my people, long live Palestine
We will never let you go

[Hook B: Lowkey]

Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine

[Verse 3: Lowkey]

This is not just a war over stolen land
Why do you think little boys are throwing stones at tanks?
We will never really know how many people are dead
They drop bombs on innocent girls while they sleep in their beds
Don't get offended by facts, just try and listen
Nothing is more anti-Semitic than Zionism
So please don't bring bad vibes when you speak to me
I know there's plenty of Rabbi's that agree with me
It's your choice what you do with this message
Don't get it confused; I view this from a truly human perspective
How many more resolutions have to be violated
How many more children have to be annihilated
Israel is a terror state, there terrorists that terrorize
I testify, my television televised them telling lies
This is not a war, it is systematic genocide
But whatever they try, Palestine will never die

[Hook A]
Free my people, long live Palestine
We will never let you go

[Hook B: Lowkey]

Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine

[Outro: Lowkey]

Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
This is for the child that is searching for an answer
I wish I could take your tears and replace them with laughter
Long live Palestine, Long live Gaza

Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
This is for the child that is searching for an answer
I wish I could take your tears and replace them with laughter
Long live Palestine, Long live Gaza[Intro: Lowkey]
It's been a long time coming
Too long, too long
It's been in the making a quarter century
But it's here now, it's here now
If by time you hear this album, I'm not here you know why

[Hook: Mavado]
Tell ya
So mi say
Too many suffering too many tears
To see a youth die I’m a know him for years
When me look around nobody care
The people dem a live inna fear
The system need to change right now
To much you do could a inna grieve right now
I know si the bigger is a give right now
After ghetto people A no steep right now (Woo ooh! oi!)

The system need to change right now
To much you do could a inna grieve right now
I know si the bigger is a give right now
After ghetto people A no steep right now (yeah yeah!)

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
My music Is my natural resource, now I want it back
Til I sever every single chain I will not relax
Just constant attack, til my world looks like Monserrat
Contact my comrades, for combat, what's concious rap
When you say the truth, they attack like a Sabertooth
Thinking clear they make you disappear like you hate the fruit
We don't need more Boeings, we don't need more Rebors, weed or Lyor Cohens
They tell us about terrorism and tell us about terrorists
Look up the definition and tell us what terror is
Only know the definition if the television tells us it
Public Enemy #1 they treat me like Professor Griff
This album has been in the making a quarter century
Born to bless the beat and rap over recorded melody
I knew the truth since I was a small little boy
I am a product of the system I was born to destroy

[Hook: Mavado]
Mi can’t believe a suh dem treat people
Dem deh ya fi protect and dem a beat people
And mi nuh see nuh system fi de street people
Can’t believe dem a de lead people

The system need fi change right now
Too much youth a go down inna grave right now
[Verse 2: Lowkey]
On the news, they glorify their own henchmen
Support the troops, but won't mention Joe Glenton
It's funny 'cos the rappers are posing as the gangsters
While the government taking money as bonuses for bankers
In life you learn, to close your eyes and hold your tongue
But together we will overcome, there's never been a chosen one
Still tryina understand, the land I stand on
I'll probably die from cancerous anger like Franz Fanon
I will never give up, I will never just quit
I will never give in, I will never submit
The reason that I came, Is bleeding from the veins
Of the people cus we equal, only Freedom is the aim
This album has been in the making a quarter century
Born to bless the beat and rap over recorded melody
I knew the truth since I was a small little boy
I am a product of the system I was born to destroy

[Hook: Mavado]

[Verse 3: Lowkey]
If you're subordinate to corporate guys supplying you orders
You're fighting fire with fire, I'm fighting fire with water
When they kill me, I know I'll die with a focused mind
Plus there will be millions of me, ready to multiply
Dont just mention, acknowledge me, remember to honour me
My pen and this honesty, defending equality
Declared a republic, and ended your monarchy
Your corporate dictatorship, pretends it's democracy
I hold your bloodline, accountable for every crime
Adam Smith to Rothschild, It's all been a clever lie
Two choices now, revolution or genocide
But thanks to Rupert Murdoch neither one will be televised
This album has been in the making a quarter century
Born to bless the beat and rap over recorded melody
I knew the truth since I was a small little boy
I am a product of the system I was born to destroy

[Hook: Mavado]A
I'm an anarchist and an angry academic activist
Axe and assassinate the alphabet in an ambulance
Ahki I'm aggy and I'm actually anti arrogant
Artists that ask in american accents by accident

B
Batter babbling battlers with a bag of batteries
Ban these bias blaggers because they're badly backwards b
Batty bible bashers get badded Basra to Brackenbury
Baffle backpackers with bars bad as a big of b

C
Catty crackheads get cancelled Canada to Canterbury
Cussing my click catch a cavalry crashed into casualty
A cunning culprit that covers conversation candidly
Cool calculated cannibal that causes carnage casually

D
Diddy didn't do diddly, dead it, did it with dignity
You dilly dally and diss from distance dig it I disagree
You did it for digits, dickhead dummy I do it differently
I define deliberately diligent delivery

E
Coz everything is everything its evidence, my essence is every element
Effortlessly edit your enterprise with eloquence
Elevate with the energy of Eminem
Every entity that's ever been a enemy I'm ending them

F
The fact is I fracture factors to fragments fantastically
Fibbers fabricate fallacies and find fantasy
I flip faithless fellas from fakers to flippin fans of me
Flippantly famish and finish these fanatics factually

G
Give gangsters gangrene and gain green gradually
Grapple and gatecrash your gathering with a gang of Gs
Gallivanting geezers get guided to the galaxy
Or gallows for gambling with a generals geniality

H
Happily hack hackers that happen to have a hack with me
Like Hatton I'm habitually hazardous how it has to be
Hospitalise haters from Holland, Holloway or Hackney
Hate hagglers and I hang 'em with a handkerchief

I
Illustrious illustrator
Illest in the industry
Illicitly cause illiterate idiots injury
Impatient cause Illuminati impede my innovations
While ignorant imbeciles idolise my imitations

J
I jack a jackal for his jacket and just jam
Got jittery jockeys jabbering, Jamaica to Japan
Got jealous junkie jokers jabbing, January-to-January
My journal is a journey just don't jinx my jiggy jamboree

K
I'm the key, the king, the Kaiser, reminding my kin of karma
I'm a kangaroo keep in your kennel you curb koala
Kidnapping kleptomaniacs since kindergarten, killer
Kitties will give their kidney for a kit kat or a kipper

L
I'm the lyricist's lyricist, livid with little listeners
Listen I'm loving living cause life is literally limited
My live lyrics lift lyricism levels luckily
Til I leave the labyrinth of London and live in luxury

M
Meanwhile my motives to motivate and mobilise my monster men
My missions to minimise misdemeanours
Mere monuments of these midgets make me milli for minutes
I may be a mad Mongrel and a manic Mesopotamian maniac

N
No my narratives, not for narcoleptic narcissists
Naive native nitwits natter negative nastiness
Numerous naughty nymphos niggle up to my navel, no
I neglect the negligee and navigate to Naples

O
When I operate, obsolete opposition get obliterated
Often obese officers ogle as their occupation
Obviously offing other obstacles is my obligation
Originality over Oscar ovations

P
Poisonous Poets, poised at the pulpit
Pulverise poachers and pointless posers
With potently poignant poems, practically panic
Paparazzi passive passengers planning to pack P's and prang patchy pampering pansies

Q
Quality over quantity, qualify quantum physics
I question quarrelly quacks and I quickly quadruple quizzes
A quarter get queasy and query with queer quotes though
These quirky quibblers get crippled like Quasimodo

R
Righteous revolution ragamuffin repping reality
Really rebelling, recruiting ready regiments rapidly
Remorseless renegade, riddims and records ripping radio
Rapping rattlers really rally rating my ratio

S
I separately severed several stupid students for steppin
And still slewing sacrilegious super sadists in seconds
Speak to Styz and savagely smack up studio sessions
Suave swingers spitting sickest similes in seven

T
Topped the talent and tenacious tendencies of Tyson
Tipped as a terrifying terrorist tackling titans
Tokyo to Tennessee, taxing timid tourists
Through turbulent times I tangle with total torment

U
Understand I'm unbelievable, that's an understatement
Uglifier, giving ultimatums to undertakers
Unanimous, undisputed, unfuckwithable
Unforgiving to ugglesome uncles they're unoriginal

V
Verbally violent and victims validate my visions
Vaporising, vanish various vigilant villains
Vividly victorious over a variety of vixens
Venomous viper vanquishes vampires with vengeance

W
These wobbling wackos are just waiting to work for wages
My words are weapons willing to wage war on you wimpy wasters

X
See thru you xenophobic x-men with an x-ray
XL xmas with an x-rated sex tape

Y
Yuppies are yapping
I'm yawning, yearning for yesterday
Years when youngers played with yo-yo's
Not yet with yay

Z
I'm as zealous as Zeppelin and Zappa in my zones
I zoom like Zorro I zap these zonking zebras, my zone's a zoo

How many letters left?

Zero[Intro: Lowkey]
Yeah. It's Lowkey
For all my people that wanna make a million pound. yeah
A million
Blud trust me, this time next year
We will be millionaires
I believe it bruv

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
There's a million ways to make a million chips
Just ask William Gates or William Smith
Does the Freshest Prince to the thrown, really exist?
The king's filling the Kingdom with silliness and hate
Listen mate, let me illustrate this rap shit is here to stay
Still many imitate, you couldn't take me out
With a chopper and army missiles
I see myself as a shopper at Harvey Nichols
With lots of dough but not from chatting to garage
Just to pop across the road and buy a jacket from Harrods
Too many MCs and rappers are average
I'm one in a mill, blessed with nothing but skill
I'm talkin' doe, like Homer Simpson picture me
Rolling in a chauffeur driven limousine
Owning boats from the coast of Britain to the Philippines
In a versacci suit only stopped to strap a huge Bob Marley zoot
Rum made by malibu, plus bacardi too
Still the type to rock shows still with microsoft doe
Surfed the net and invest in stocks
With enough money and power to arrest all the bent feds and cops
So when I walk in stores and try shit on
They never mention cost
No one said London city was fair
I aim to be a fuckin millionaire
Fuck these idiot brehs
I aim to start companies and employ my peoples
Satan can't fuck with me I'm here to destroy the evils
Fire arms, crack and the poison needles
And the street's unthinkable tortures
Don't spit a bar, relaxin' at home cinema
Sippin mineral water, money stacks counting and analyzing
But the fact is right now I'm fantasizing[Verse 1:lowkey]

I hope you're somewhere listening to this
I wish I knew why you did what you did
Cause I still haven't really come to terms with the truth
There must have been something you were determined to do
The lessons you taught me, I can't forget
But there's so many unanswered questions
Now everything seems meaningless
You lived fast and died young
But my brother you were a genius
How could you ever believe that you'll survive
I don't care what they say, that shit is suicide
I won't lie, there was much distance between you and I
I should've told you not to do it, don't be stupid
You've got looks, got brains and your future's bright
Now you're gone I feel like I'm gon' lose my mind
I never thought you'd get yourself organised
I wish we saw the signs, the shock left us all traumatised
These are awful times, and I need more than rhymes
Cause this was more than a tragedy
You can't just cheat the forces of gravity
You left me here to hold a brave face supporting the family

[Verse 2: Lowkey]

In a way you were dying to live
It's fucked up man, I'm crying while I'm writing this shit
Water from my eyes is stopping me from lighting my spliff
Why didn't you realise that your life is a gift
Mum and Dad don't understand why they've outlived their son
Every single CD, Mix Tape and Album to come
Is dedicated to no other than my blood brother
But I hate you, for the way you made my Mum suffer
Words can't explain, how a certain part of my heart hurts with the harshest pain
Last time we spoke, we said we weren't brothers and we aren't the same
I told myself you were too far past insane
How could we not take your death badly
I just asked mum and she said your name meant happy

[Verse 3: Lowkey

But my soul is too cold to laugh
My heart bleeds when I'm looking at your old school photograph
I wish that I could touch your beautiful flesh
I'm writing but we ain't even had the funeral yet
Now death is something, that I'm staying ever ready for
You had plenty more to give, you weren't even 24
I don't understand why you had to die
In a lot of rappers rhymes, death is glamorised
Not me, I'll always stay remembering you
I should've known this was something you'd eventually do
When you got shift, we should've known it was bad
The next day I was sitting here consoling my Dad
It's like a nightmare, it still doesn't seem real

[Verse 4: Lowkey]

But this is my life, not some fucking deep film
It's the strange feeling I felt in the late night
Witnesses said that you fell from a great height
Can't be my brother man, tell me it ain't right
Right now I'd rather blaze, we could face life
Shit what a waste, what a shame
I just gotta make sure your life wasn't lost in vain
This is my brother, not just a departed friend
So hard for my |?| to start again
From now on our lives will never be the same
We holding on too tight for the memories to fade
24 years was hardly a life
On the day you passed, it's like a part of me died
I've been scarred many times but this pain is so much worse
And it's so much harder to describe
You will still be missed
I'm sorry we didn't support you, we thought we did
I wish I broke your leg so you couldn't jump
Now all I can do...is rep your fuckin name like I should've done
Cause it's only right
I'm still not sleeping, but now I'm seeing your ghost at night
We all wish we could've stopped you
I know I can't go back in time now, but I want to
It's like a tightened knot that I can't undo
Why did I have to lose you to realise I loved you
Be careful what you wish for, in case it comes true
Right now I'm confused, feeling so subdued
When they arrested you, they wanted to sanction you
The only thing we did wrong was going and getting you
Next morning you was up, not doing what you was meant to do
That wasn't the life that you were meant to have
That wasn't the way that it was meant to be
You were sick, not physically but mentally
I still ain't got a fraction of this shit off of my chest

All that goes through my mind is the constant regret
Why why why did you die for no reason
All of a sudden the weathers cold its so freezin
Have you ever head the saying, when it rains it pours
Don't ever try to tell me my pain is the same as yours
Cause it's not, and everything isn't what it seems
I'm pinching myself but I know that this is not a dream
Why did you have to do that, this isn't fair
Listen my brother, never think that I didn't care
There's no words to describe the way that this feels
Now I can clearly separate the fake from the real
Why did everyone else have to be bro
I still can't quiet believe that you're actually gone
Just 5 days, 5 days and it feels like the same day
Weed ain't helpin but I need it just to maintain
Cause the bleak reality is terrible
And last night mom was practically hysterical
People I thought would care, couldn't care less
I need a lot of support cause I'm feeling bare stressed
And everyone else seems immature
I'm being tested, thinking what is there left that I'm living for
I need to clear my thoughts, stop thinking and try n breathe
Just a week ago I was so innocent and naive
Now my insides are burning like hells flames
I've realised up until now I've never felt pain
It's so evident that everything I cared about before was so irrelevant
There's certain people that call when they see that this shit is hurtin
But I see them for what they are now cause I'm a different person

R.I.P
In fact fuck R.I.P
I want you to live through me
Live through me...
Live through me...
Live...through...me...[Verse 1: Akala]
Behind my painted smile when all the revolutionary noise is nothing but a lost little boy
Confused and insecure, arrogant and oversure
An egotistical prick so come on please praise me more
It's great that my music bettered you but I contemplate murder every day so don't put me on a pedestal
Plus truly, just the vehicle the music just runs through me
In my better moments I could let the universe use me

[Lowkey]
Behind my smile there's generations of pain, self-hatred, ingrained miseducated my brain
Decimated the place where my dead relations were slain
Not just physically but mentally penetrated our veins
What you got inside hasn't gotta die once it can die a lot of times, that I promise my son
Analyse every song that I've done - tryna fight colonialism with a colonised tongue

[Hook]
Here I stand again
Living in sin
Caught up, in the dream
Behind the painted smile

[Akala Verse:2]
Behind my painted smile is the most painful grimace
This mental prison I live in cause I am so conditioned
By my privilege, what a strange contradiction
To grow up brown in Britain and know that your living
Was paid for by a carcass that resembles yours
Born in the heart of the empire
You're worth more than I was just like you
But less then the native ones, raised by my mum but in this world I am a father's son

[Lowkey]
Behind my painted smile, a very flawed human being
Done many things that I regret and never knew the reason
What do you believe in, truth or freedom or are you deceiving?
I don't wanna die in prostration to European's
They say the answer is within you and nowhere else
Understand the vision man on a mission to know himself
This is for my co-defendants no retreat and no surrender
You probably think that we don't remember Ota Benga

[Hook]

[Akala verse:3]
The smile is painted on my face is tainted by a frown
Picture in the pocket's of blood that decorate the town
Trigger jum bullets sung and guns hum
Then everyone that's dead was somebody's someone

[Lowkey]
Behind my painted smile I feel like a naked child
Maybe rapping ain't for now cos my passion is fading out
Up early though I search and roam along this dirty road
Just another traveller taking a long journey home

[Akala]
All this talk of intervention to protect on what is the intention
Same as it ever was the colonial past and present
And more respect for most of the right wingers
Than the paternalistic patronising liberal bigot

[Lowkey]
Our way of life is so divine, we should intervene
Select war and export the British dream
Behind cinema screens there's much that isn't seen
George Clooney war movies never bring our children peace

[Akala]
Yo fam, you ever wake up and just feel like fucking off,and never coming back to this place and just cutting off?

[Lowkey]
All the time, almost did last year the trouble was the bloody cops had me running in and out the bloody dock

[Akala]
I been there brother, though I don't promote it in this rap shit, I ain't a stranger to having my back on their blue plastic

[Lowkey]
Can't keep us captive

[Akala]
We see the tactics

[Lowkey]
To keep us passive

[Akala]
We beat the fascists

[Lowkey]
Release the classics

[Akala & Lowkey]
And reach the masses!

[Hook]x2[Verse 1: Klashnekoff]
As lightning strikes and thunder pounds
Over the grey skies of East London town
Prophecy K returns from the underground
Signified by the peoples crying, trumpet sounds
Yeah the system it tried to shut me down
But I been on my ting before Onyx was flinging guns around
Blood, sweat, and tears for years
It feels like my careers been in the dumping ground
Yeah, this is how hunger sounds
And I'm the hunter now, 'Lash the lion heart
A.K.A. the man behind the iron mask
For ten years straight, I've been raising the iron bar
Tryna breathe the life back into this dyin' art
So why try and par? When you'll meet the same fate as that lion Scar
This game is fake; full of two-faced lying ras
Who would sell their soul and arse just to climb the charts
Yea, but me, I put in too much time in the graft
Refinin' my craft for labels to sign me for a minor advance
Picture K'Lash, mimin' on Trance
Now picture Dr. Dre beats/'Lash rhymin' with Stars
It's all fate and I got mine in my grasp
They're all snakes, let 'em die in the past
But who knows what the future holds?
These N.W.O. soldiers will probably shoot me cold
All because the truth was told
You should know I did it from the heart

[Hook: Lowkey]
I’m still here, pushing after several years
I’m still here, standing strong, never in fear
I’ll be still here after the dust settles and clears
I’ll be still here after the blood, sweat and the tears

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
I don't do this for the happy ravers or the aggy haters
I do this for the warriors and the gladiators
Do this for those whose lives you never cared about
Can't pronounce their names, their origins or their whereabouts
Those brought up around tragedy and sadness
Who adjusted and found normality in the madness
Fight the power 'til I'm out of breath like Malcolm X
You empower the powerful, I empower the powerless
They'll play you on the radio if you rap about a Gucci belt
But rap about the government; you might as well shoot yourself
Industry fairies say I rap about conspiracy theories
Just to hide the fact that they lyrically fear me
Got that eye of a tiger, the heart of a lion
The mind of a lifer, my stance is defiant
I rise like a phoenix, immediate from the ashes
My existence is inconvenient for the masses
Though we are equal, I despise an imitation
I live for my people and die for liberation
I stand as a visionary; some have got plans of killin' me
To literally vanish me physically like Aborigines
Hannibal with the mask, an animal with the bars
I'm grappling with my shackles, I channel it through my art
Feel it in the ambience, champion, heavyweight
My life is nothing but my pride is somethin' that you can never take
They think I'm elusive or think I'm a nuisance
I swear these major labels must think that I'm stupid
Keep your 360's you're convincing these dudes with
Like I'll give you the blueprint for pimping my music
I say that like K’Lash, he’s another lion
Every hardship from getting scarred to my brother dying
Spit all of it with or without a big audience
Through the Blood, Sweat & Tears I stand victorious!In the darkest hours, when the world has turn away
And no-one's watching when the sky has turned to grey and
You have no option, when your voice is illegal
Only choice for the people
Is to stand up proudly in the face of death
And it ain't waste of breath when you speak on loudly
On behalf of the kids in the street with no pot to piss in
Living on the young cos' their papas missing
Don't know if his dead or he's locked in prison
Disappeared and considered him the opposition
And now have a vision of dreams I shouldn't see
And could it be this close? nah It couldn't be
But if the people in Egypt and Tunis can do this
To decide their fate why wouldn't we
More than forty years we done rocked the nation
And the occupation we can not be waiting
We gonn' stop debating, when one of us dies
Ten jump in line ready to box the satan

You can't take our freedom or take our soul
Take our Freedom or take our soul
You are not the one that's in control
You are not the one that's in control
La Ilaha Il-Allah, no power greater than God
Go ahead and divide your plans, at the end of the day
You are just a man

[Lowkey]
The movement is building
When the fathers past the scars through to the children
They shooting to kill them
But the question I'm asking is who's gonna heal them
Look up to the clear skies and down to the brown
Where the blood, sweat & the tears dry
We are questioning their lives
And realize that is not a threat when the fear dies
So we are not afraid anymore
And you can't play God with our lives
You attempted to cage every thought
But resistance is locked in our minds
From Millbank Tower to Tahrir Square
Nobody can deny its a fact we are there
We are not leaving until we got freedom
We are willing to bleed and even stop breathing
You must have known from the rust on your throne
That you couldn't maintain by cuttin the phones
Justice alone will sustain our presence
Tunisia to Libia, Bahrain to Yemen

[Khaled]
I don't taste the blood
I don't taste the sweat
I don't taste the tears
I ain't taste regret

Now I'm a grown man, and never seen my homeland
And because master jack phone plan
Dad escaped jail and he dedicated, his life
To the cause but he never made it
This ain't about my father getting' retribution
Or my uncle is getting tortured with electrocution
Other uncles getting hung in public executions
Just simply coming out with the best solution
And I don't know why it seems this sky regime
Keeps pushing to the silence scream
It will take you half an hour, to figure that this coward
Can only get his powers for violent means
Killing all the doctors in hospitals
When the regime just seems unstoppable
When freedom feels impossible
The People rise and overcome every obstacle

[Lowkey]
Dictators are nervous, take from the people
Give straight to the serpents
The sick place that this earth is
Will only ever change, if change for a purpose
By the people, for the people
None are supreme, all are equal
There's mountains to touch, The power is us
Devour these cowards with the sound as we rush
I am not a leader, a teacher or preacher
If my people aren't free, than I am not either
I refuse to be silenced And we will not stop short of
Removing these tyrants There comes a time where summarize
Events gone Look up to the sky and wonder why you're next
You could call this the Butterfly Effect
I despise the rats that disguise the facts
When they know the population is fighting back
Inside of crack, this time I bad, like the second Bouazizi
Did light that match[Intro]
If my mother got angry or frustrated with me, she'd say..."oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya"
...and the basic translation of that is "Oh,how beautiful is freedom"
But where is freedom
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Where is our freedom?

[Hook]
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya

[Verse 1]
This is for Baghdad, the place of my mothers birth
The cradle of civilization, for what it’s worth
The land I’ve never seen, culture I’ve never known
Iraq is in my heart, my blood, my flesh and bones
The air I’ve never breathed, fragrance I’ve never smelt
The pride I never had, the nationality that I never felt
Saddam was bad, are the American’s even more so?
They made me groan like I was missing part of my torso
But I never picked up a grenade in my garden
I never saw people I love die starving
I never saw my family die through many years of sanctions
While the ruler’s family lived in palaces and mansions
Never had a family member kidnapped for a ransom
Never lost a friend to violence that was random
Bombings, occupation, torture, intimidation
A million dead people doesn’t equal liberation
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Listen!
Where is our freedom?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Forget division based on ethnicity or religion
Whether you Sunni, Shia, Kurdish or Christian
Pain is still pain if you’re a person that’s missing
We all deserve a life in this earth that we live in
Is there enough words that can say
How deeply Baghdad is burnin' today
And it’s not about pity, hands out or sympathy
It’s about pride, respect, honour and dignity
Babies being born with deformities from uranium
Those babies aren’t just Iraqi, they’re Mesopotamian
What I view on the news is making me shiver
Cause I look at the victims and see the same face in the mirror
This system of division makes it harder for you and me
Peace is a question, the only answer is unity
So many dreams about this place that I’ve never seen
The place my family had to leave in the 70’s
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Where is our freedom?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

It rains white phosphorus in Fallujah
This is for those that won’t live to see the future
Sorry that I wasn’t there, Sorry that I couldn’t help
I’m sorry for every tear, Sorry you’ve been put through hell
Still I feel like an immigrant, Englishman amongst Arabs and an Arab amongst Englishmen
Like I said they never gave me the culture
But they did give me Kubdad Haleb,Hakaka and Dolma
Ana isme Kareem
Wa ohmre thalatha wa-’ishrun
Umi min Baghdad, wa abuya min Dover
And that’s the combination that I carry on my shoulders
Still I rep, till my death, till they kill and steal my flesh
From now all the way back to Gilgamesh
Such a villianized and criticized nation
You will always be the cradle of civilization
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Where is our freedom?

[Hook]
In my sleep, in my dreams Motherland I can still feel you calling me
In my sleep, in my dreams Motherland I can still feel you calling me
In my sleep, in my dreams Motherland I can still feel you calling me
I can still feel you calling me
I can still feel you calling me[Hook: Mai Khalil]
Whoa, give me the words, give me the words
That tell me nothing
Dear England
Whoa, give me the words, give me the words
That tell me nothing

[Verse 1]
They say God save the queen, Britannia rules the waves
Britannia's in my genes, but Britannia called us slaves
Britannia made the borders, cause Britannia's forces came
Britannia lit the match, but Britannia fears the flame
Where blood stains the pavement, tears stain a cheek
And privilege is threatened, the fear reigns supreme
Where bankers are earning, from burning and looting
The nervous are shooting, search for solutions
I shed a tear for the father in Birmingham
Quick swerve of the car and it murdered them
In Tottenham the apartments were burning
And nobody came just arson is circling
All wanna be down till TVs get robbed like jewels on the queens crown
They say now no cause for a rebound
See now they call me a fool cause I speak out
People are humans, not mindless animals
This violent tyrannical system is fallable
Hand in a looter the minute you see 'em
But the biggest looters are the British museum
This happened here and you think its a accident
Just relax as we slip into fascism
And the fear gets drilled into your hearts
But remember these children are all ours

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If a policeman can kill a black man where he found him
A soldier can kill an Afghan in the mountains
A petty thief can get ransacked from his housing
While the bankers are lounging
That's my surroundings
Took land, no one in your family has heard of
Before you sleep, whisper the mantra you learnt cause
Never will there be a day that cameras are turned off
Who runs this country, Cameron or Murdoch?
Who's the government, a government that can't govern
Can't you figure it's ways bigger than Mark Duggan
Bigger than Smiley, bigger than Jean Charles
Hundreds are dead not one killer is on trial
Just a familiar sound of hysteria
Bombs over Libya but not this area
Downing Street I can find villains
Cut education, privatise prisons
Surprised by theft when it's organised
But mass immorality is normalised
Assumptions surrounding the looting of London
But this is a system consumed by consumption
Yea it happened here and you think its a accident
Just relax as we slip into fascism
And the fear gets drilled into your hearts
But remember these children are all ours

[Hook][Verse 1]
This is for my people that miss me, I know you needed this
Every single stroke of the pen is a stroke of genius
Other than my cd, you ain’t heard a flow as deep as this
Every verse should be treated like the mona lisa is
And yeah you might have the upper hand, if we’re speaking dough
And yeah I understand that you get a G for shows
But all you’ve ever done is boast, with your feeble flow
My music’s touch more peoples souls than I could even know
My whole heart, that’s what I give to my fans
A listener’s tear is worth more than a mil in my hand
All you talk about is flipping grams and triggers that bang
Me, I consider lyricism, a privilege fam
When it comes to putting words together its certain that I’m better
Every verse you heard is like a personal letter
So when I die, my fans can say they all knew me
Lowkey, Double P, Yours Truly

(i feel, so hear)

[Verse 2]
This is for those praying through hell, till they’re in paradise
I cry blood for the children of palestine
My life’s left me so emotionally paralyzed
I couldn’t even cry in a funeral where my nana died
My words are swords, have served their cause like a samurai
Cameras spy on the average guy weaving through traffic lights
These are savage times, expand your mind and analyze
Don’t glamorize the gangster life, like these other rappers might
Haters stay around me like, satellites orbit
You don’t want to see the pair of guys I strategize war with
Peoples army work it, you batty guys forfeit
Not jamaican but I’m eating with my akhi like swordfish
When it comes to putting words together its certain that I’m better
Every verse you heard is like a personal letter
So when I die, my fans can say they all knew me
Lowkey, people’s army, yours truly

(I feel, So hear)

[Verse 3]
I told the world about my issues and the things I went through
In this game its undeniable I’m influential
The strength of my mental, is making other spitters tremble
All I needs a piece of paper, a pencil, and instrumental
I didn’t settle till I took it to a different level
Gripping metal and flipping pebbles, you sided with the devil
I see you flossing in your video that looks a rental
That little bezel around your neck don’t make you flippin’ special
I’m quite high when I am writing my rhymes
Like I am mike tyson on a fight night in his prime
I’m like einstein, got it all precise in my mind
With the mic im like Ike in his most violent times
When it comes to putting words together its certain that I’m better
Every verse you heard is like a personal letter
So when I die, my fans can say they all knew me

Lowkey, Mongrel, Yours Truly[Refrain 1: Gary Jules]
All around me are familiar faces
Warn out places, warn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

[Verse 1: Doc Brown]
Doc Brown, it's a disgrace, this place is like a whore house
The crooked systems the pimp that got us workin' 'til me worn out
Storm clouds so it's dark when I wake up
Same street, same run for the same bus
Same tramp with his change cup
But many pennies and tens and twenty's ain't gonna change his day up
This train sucks blood, you look familiar
Why do I know them tired eyes from somewhere in particular
Wait, nah it was yesterday
You shoved me in the chest just to race to the top of the escalator
We rats comin' back for more
Happy to carry the wait 'til our backs are sore
Trapped in the system of capitalism
That got us thinkin' that we have to take a shit job just to get a quick buck
Why not live the life that you want?
When your dreams too big to fit in that Burger King uniform
Forgot what humanity showed us
Now we walk around like robots, 'til we go nuts
Whats strange is, we all creative
'Til age six, then we start hearin' the same shit
From police, parents, teachers, television
Take them first steps towards a mental prison
Then at the end of ya life you like "Raahs!"
"I was doin' time but I weren't even behind bars"
Know what blood, it's a very very (mad world)
Maintain feel the weight on my brain (mad world)
It's still the same my brains achin' with pain (mad world)
This ain't life it just doesn't feel right (mad world)
My dreams ain't nice, can't sleep at night

[Refrain 2: Gary Jules]
Went to school and was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teachers tell me what's my lesson
Looked right through me, looked right through me

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
From the time I was a toddler, tiny and small
I grew into a little monster in primary school
Just another name on the list at registration
The teacher never listens so I lived in desperation
By Year 6, I was sick of education
Not to mention wantin' attention but I'd sit in hesitation
Scared to ask teachers questions
Cuz I was quick to test their patience
Soon as I reached secondary, different heads were hatin'
To teachers I was already dead and buried, a product of the street's devastation
Aggy and fassies and fools and carryin' tools
Why, it's a weak explanation
But I was never happy in school, sufferin' from sleep deprivation
Teachers new my type, they saw it in me, never used eyesight
Most pretend they're blind when the older youths and new guys fight
Got sent around to the deputy heads
When the fat kid that grassed went back to sit in class
And dreamt about leavin' all my enemies dead
Many tears where eventually shed
Up 'til now I didn't know what my memories meant
Many messed with me then, all the fights left my energy spent
Teachers need to fix up, this message is for everyone but especially them
Intelligent kids don't grow unless they mentally fed in this (mad world)

[Outro: Lowkey & Doc Brown]
Life is cruel blood, I'm tired of school (mad world)
Your mind's a tool, don't play by the rules (mad world)
That's the truth I've been trapped since youth (mad world)
My heart's bruised but I still won't lose (mad world)[Verse 1: Logic]

My names little Jake
My mum calls me the big mistake
Birthdays come and go, I’ve never seen a cake
Most days I’m locked in my room, at least then I’m safe
Without her
Other times I gotta do housework
Mum and dad fight, mum loses so she hits me
Even put me in hospital
They had to fix me
My mum and my aunty get lit cigarettes and stab me
Oi mum, why did you have me?
To treat me bad?
You left my dad
He used to save me
He used to ask you why do you hate me
And lately
My mum makes me fight my brothers a lot
My mum and my aunty watch laughing
I’m hungry I’m starving
Cold beans and bread
My future aint’t good I’ve seen ahead
I ain’t got friends
I’m 9 years old but will I live to see 10……..
I don’t know

[Hook]
Don't hide it(x4)

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
My names Chelsea, you could swim in the ocean of tears I have cried
When I was three years old my dad died
When I was six my mum got married to some guy
Three years later my mum died, but why
Did her husband have to custody of me?
Since I was 9 he’s been doing stuff with my body
And I need to be rescued
Coz this strange man is touching me in places that I know he isn’t meant to
I wish life could be the way it was before
Now he comes in my room, turns off the light, and locks the door
Now I can’t sleep waiting up for another day
One time I got the courage to run away
But that was very dumb
Coz he found me and told me he’d kill me if I ever told anyone
I gotta go, yours truly Chelsea
P.s… please help me

[Hook]
Don’t hide it (x8)

[Outro-->Lowkey]
This one is for all the children suffering abuse as we speak
All over the world
This one is for you; if you relate to this song
This one is for you
NWO- New World Order
Lowkey, Logic
Children are the future
We reap what we sow[Intro:]
This one is dedicated to the dreamers
Most people see things that are there and ask why
Dreamers, see things that aren't there and ask why not
I'm dreamin' with you

[Verse 1:]
I once knew a girl who on the surface was as solid as a rock
Future full of promise and mind seemed stronger than an ox
Face of beauty and a tongue was as honest as it got
That wasn't what is was, problem rock bottom she was lost
I couldn't see this sweet genius was full of secrets
Full of demons that pulled her deeper in this pool of leeches
Confused by the news, I was bruised when they told me
It concludes to the truth, was she consumed by the loneliness?
She was a true queen, nothing like Elizabeth
Often caught her starin' into space with a distant look
Considerate but detached from others even when intimate
Now I'm searchin' for answers I'd never find in a book
Last time I saw her, before the day she took her life
I wish I fixed her pain, I shoulda, coulda, woulda tried
But I took it personally and turned to leave
And to this day I'm still haunted by the words she screamed...

[Hook:]
Sometimes I really really hate myself
Sometimes I wish that I could change myself
Sometimes I don't wanna give no more
And sometimes I just don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I don't know where to call for help
Sometimes I don't really know myself
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away
And find away to a brighter day

[Verse 2:]
They say that life is a question and death is the answer
But Niko lost his brother and Rewds lost his father
God bless your souls please know that I love you both
They say time heals but the pain still doesn't go
I've seen my brother die and seen my mother cry
Seen the wind change in the flutter of a butterfly
Seen people get sectioned for life, I think and wonder
A small twist of fate, that could've been my brother
25 years a life could say thus far
I always have wondered who the sane ones are
Though I live by the words "fear not", I'm afraid
When I wrote this so many tears dropped on the page
It's mad how death always manifests in the weirdest ways
Won't go near the grave but in my dreams he appears the same
Then I get closer and see his face, it's clear as day
He looks me deep in the eyes and I hear him say...

[Hook:]
Sometimes I really really hate myself
Sometimes I wish that I could change myself
Sometimes I don't wanna give no more
And sometimes I just don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I don't know where to go for help
Sometimes I don't really know myself
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away
And find away to a brighter day[Hook]
Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me
Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me
Oh don't we ever get beyond this wall

[Verse 1]
I am no role model, I am not Mr. Perfect
Been bitten a couple of times and I did deserve it
Everyday livin' and learnin' through these written verses
My life is a sacrifice, I wonder is it worth it?
People can change, I'm living physical proof
I'm not important, or special or different from you
To other people, I may seem like a good adviser
But to myself I feel like a dirty womanizer
I am just a man, I will never be a celebrity
That is a mantra I will cling to the death of me
Don't wanna feed my kids the very treachery they fed to me
Preferably the aim is equality eventually
Don't relegate me below, or elevate me above to you
Needless to say, in either place I'm uncomfortable
I treat you as an equal, I'm simply a man
Your brother in humanity is everything that I am

[Hook]
Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me

Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me
Oh don't we ever get beyond this wall

[Verse 2]
Listen close to the words that were sang in the chorus
There's a big difference between fans and supporters
Never asked to be scrutinized or consumerized
Or treated differently to any other human life
Most don't, but some do and it saddens me
Force fed celebrity to subdue our humanity
See the false image depicted and think it's purity
When beneath that image they hold more insecurities
Than you do, but sometimes it's hard to tell who's who
There's more to life than Twitter followers and YouTube views
And if I came across like I was cocky I am sorry
You were born original so please don't die a copy
Don't relegate me below, or elevate me above to you
Needless to say, in either place I'm uncomfortable
I treat you as an equal, I'm simply a man
Your brother in humanity is everything that I am

[Hook]
Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me
Everything I am, and everything I want to be
I put it in your hands, you could open up to me
Oh don't we ever get beyond this wallEverything must change...

I'm not some kinda superman
I'm just tryna find who I am
And get my future plan
Don't know where I'm from
Don't know what my aim is
Don't know where I'm going
Don't wanna be famous
Don't wanna be that guy
I need privacy but can't be low-key cause it isn't me
Get pulled both ways and it tears me apart
Seems for years I've been wearing this mask
One to myself, another to the multitude
Now I'm confused with which one of those is true
In bed alone lyin myself
I realize I was lying to myself
Now I'm here, finding myself
The truth's out there I'm a find it myself
Forget going on a holiday bruv
I just wanna change

Everything...

I wish that I could make a happy song
But I'm depressed and I don't wanna carry on
I don't know what you've been told G
But no one alive truly knows me
Forget rapping I should find a job
I need direction, maybe a sign from God
I'm tortured, the pain's tormenting my soul
Got friends but I just can't pretend, I'm alone
I'm haunted, by regrets and mistakes
And everyday I'm just testing my fate
Like a boxer that loves throwing rights at them
But doctors warned him, he'll die if he fights again
Sometimes it feels like the weight of the world is on my shoulders
But that's just the way of the world
It's getting colder, it's too cold
Don't know much but I do know

Everything must change...
Must change...
Must change...
Must change...

So I've made music that made my mum cry
Bruv told me what happens when a loved dies
Don't even recognize my own face sometimes
Don't wanna stay around now, but I must try
Someone, somewhere might understand
I just don't wanna give my life to the fans
I'm tryna do more than just be real
In order to rebuild

Everything must change...

I'm just tryna survive today
And live my life in a righteous way
So I gotta watch what I decide to say
My pride's at stake
Don't wanna be described as fake
My mind states, I rate
And I'm wide awake
But I need sleep and it's kind of late
Don't wanna give them a reason to despise and hate
So I'm tryna change

Everything...

All around me, my people's dying
All being controlled by evil tyrants
Lives lost due to needless violence
Look to the sky, cause I need some guidance
But it feels like nothing helps
Gotta watch for my sister and my mum as well
Everyday it feels like I'm stuck in hell
I guess this is sort of how my brother felt...

See... just gotta hold on
Hope for the best...
Prepare for the worst...
Cause nothing is promised...
All I know is...

Everything must change...Ay yo it's Poisonous, we're poised to bust
So boisterous that boydem are avoiding us
Hard to reach like Toys 'R' Us
Starting beef is pointless, cuz
Represent crooks like a lawyer does
About to flood the underground like somebody's boiler's bust
Killers lyrically with ill ability
Village idiots grilling me
We envision the bigger picture differently
Written history
The sickest lyricist killing it in the industry
In the streets we're ripping it particularly
Double P, any trouble
Get left as rubble under me
Suffered a couple fuckery
Luckily it must've toughened me
On the hunt but we hustle to double our bundle subtly
It's lovely jubbly even though the struggle's stuck in me
There's a great abundance of haters in London
Layton to Sutton
Making the assumption you're raking the funds in
And they're patiently pacing and hunting
Waiting for something so they can raid your drum
Take your mum and whack her face with a gun
And that's the way that they function
It ain't safe in the dungeon
You could get blazed like a Bunsen
Plus there's Jakes with their truncheons
And racists at customs
Ready to break your face if you punch them
It's basically fucked
You better watch who you're placing your trust in
Can't even blaze with your cousin
Braids get brave when it's blatant your bud's in
Change your fate with a razor blade over nothing
Bare frustration and fussing, no debates or discussion
There's dangerous strangers aiming flamers and busting
Plus watch what lady you're nutting in
Cause the dame that you're crushing
Could have..... bacon in the oven
There's snakes making names, laying claims
Chasing paper and fronting
Praying about playing the game Satan is running
Whenever I rhyme on the beat
I bless it right properly
I recognize honesty
You're telling lies probably
Never try stopping me
When I'm in the hood like meals on wheels and ethnic minorities
Forget buying designer attire
I'm writing this fire 'til these liers resign and retire
Got the type of mind Einstein would admire
Tighter than a Mayan's vagina
But I'm here if you biters need a writer to hire
Iron mic, spits the dynamite you'd like to acquire
Need firefighters' saliva just to survive in this cypher
Recite the messiah
Time to fight with the tiger
Likely to find me flying to China
I recently had beef with some demons that dreamed of eating me
Like pizza or a piece of meat, I deleted them easily
Please believe me, G
There's a deeper meaning to being free
Legally, read and see the freedom that we can reach
I'm teaching teachers teaching me
Preaching to people peacefully
Don't smoke needlessly, cause weed weakens me
And being mean just feeds the beast, mean machine
They don't feed the needy
But they're eager and keen to keep the greedy queen
I told my sister reach her dreams
Be everything that she can be
They want us as feeble fiends
Reason being they keep the cream
It's an evil scheme
Police on the beat peeping me
Life is deep
But we need a leader to lead the weak
You're own people will leave you deceased like Caesar
See, it seems to me
That they don't wanna see our seeds succeed
Ends need to meet, so I'm on the streets seeking P's
Cause this is what I breathe and eat
Look deep, can you see the pain in my eyes?
Do you think you can relate to the state of my mind?
I need to lay it all out, cause I'm aching inside
But I know this pain will stay 'til the day that I die
I take a deep breath and step outside
It could be me next
Whatever comes, I stay ever ready to meet death
So stressed, waking up in cold sweats
I need rest
It's messed up, how dark and disturbing my dreams get
Little kids that died, covered in flies, with ribs touching
Corporations that saw them nations, but did nothing
Governments are puppets for billon dollar companies
Sooner or later, the killers are gonna come for me
When I think about the truth, I feel so sick
Even if you're egnorant, fam, there's still no bliss
The roads are brainwashed and you will note this
They put fiberglass in the weed and brothers still smoked it
You think you're hard, but they're laughing at us
You think you know, but it's larger than parliament, cause
We're not even free when our hits are sitting on the shelf
The lyrics that you're spitting in your songs, you're just snitching on yourself
You think what you do is making it better?
I'm not trying to open your mind
I'm trying to change it forever
But probably above all, I embody the struggle
Of everybody that hustles and I ain't sorry for fuck all
I refuse to be a product of the place that I live in
Never playing the villain with what I say on the rhythm
They molded us from day, how didn't we know?
Demons are starting at my soul and they're killing me slow
Will I make it to tomorrow? I can't tell
But I know I've gotta free all of my brothers from this dark hell
Everything I spit is heartfelt
The ink that I'm using to write is what I get when my heart melts
You need more than a 64 to outflow me
Tell me, what's this whole scene without Lowkey?
That's like football without Pele
That's like chess without checkmate
Or L.A. without eses
That's like crack and coke without addicts
Or like Ladbroke Grove without Arabs
That's like the fresh beats without an MC
That's like this scene without Grime Daily or SB
Don't be greedy boys
And stop acting hard if you're really moist
I'm like the industry hater without the mask and the neeky voice
Ya done know, big up SBWhether you're in HMV or KFC, HMP or A&E
I make them see a-n-d. let you know the c-a-s-e
From LDN not NYC, on the m-i-c I'm M.I.B.,
Like BIG the MVP, VIP to the e-n-d
E.g., my CD, is way to d-e-e-p
That goes for your TV screen, DVD or BBC
ITN or ITV, C-O-Ps say "ID please"
S-t-o-p like IC3, wanna see me hooked to an IV, g
In the ICU but Im n-o-t, they went OT with the m-o-b
Can't see me through the f-o-g
Don't cuss mothers of S.O.B's
These MC's are OAPs
Wanna hype up I'm like "okay, g."
You think you're b-a-d
Get a p-e-n and a p-a-d
If the CIA and the FBI, the MI6 and the MI5
Jump on the A3 then I drive, turn up the A/C, FYI
MJ like P.Y.T,, lol I never T.Y.P
I e-a-t on E.I.D, twist the C.I.D like Levi Jeans
D-i-e like BNP; EDL just BFG's.
Youths don't want no GCSE's they want C.O.D. on the PS3
I'm like DP, or PE, or KRS from BDP
Download this on your MP3
Send it to your MP & MTV
You're not on this thing like A.D.D
Your CD I rate PG
Like KKK's with AK's
My A.K.A is AA
Take you off the road ASAP
DDT these JLS MC's
What you just saw basically
Is how to murder the ABC's
Cause I'm back in the booth
Rappers wanna chat about the strap they got stashed in the back of their boot
But I chat to the youths
Abstract or backpack my attributes and stack to the roof
I capture the truth
Pour it on tracks with my views, and I'll sell it out the back of the boot
I'm positive you're negative, you're whack and confused
I'm back and the fact is your dad's in the room
Ain't a track that you rappers can battle with
Every track that I spat is immaculate
Any track that I smash, I'm attacking it
Heard you rap fam, your tracks are inadequate
Your CD was kak, it was crap, I'm dashing it
You follow fashion with rap, I'm passionate
Blood start splashing you, whip you're dashing it
Said you were packing a mac in the back of it
Kizzy, I'm busy, I'm really a brilliant guy
It's gritty and shitty but really the city is mine
If you dis me, pity the silly billy to try
From bricky to Piccadilly to Mississippi I'm live
Getting rid of you Milli Vanilli's, gimme the vibe
Get jiggy like Willy spitting the wittiest rhymes
Uncivilised, ignorant, diligent type
And I victimize an idiot a million times
Hey hey, we ray rays and sway flames
Take snakes of the road like AA
So waste brays, vacate, and make space
You bait fakes ain't straight, you stay fake
We chase papes, you chase days like day way
On a late day you date fakes and save face
In the same place, we maintain and ain't changed
We make tapes that rape pace like Keslane
Don't diss this or miss this we live this from Lisbon to Ipswich
For instance the dick's got your sister addicted
Oh look, big tits came for a quick fix
You're limper than Bizkit you nitwits
A monster, a beast, when I stomp on the beat
If the nonsense you speak is not gonna cease
Unconscious belief, some conscious MCs
Don't respond to the beef if your nonsense is meep
Get ill up on the rhythm when I kill 'em on a lyrical
Finish up my dinner then I drill 'em with a syllable
Don't really care what you did and what you didn't do
Little fools are minuscule, spitting isn't difficult
You find your mind cause I'm out of mine
Fuck a pound sign, came for the crown of grime
I told you once, I told you a thousand times
I'm a fountain of acid, you're alkaline
You alcoholics are out of line
Got a mountain to climb if your mouth is lying
Bow to his highness, I'm bound to shine
Let me coach you on vocals and how to rhyme
Think I'm vexed with your in-directs
If I spit rhymes next I will slit five necks
I'm a big time threat, to your piss sly vects
This guy lives life inside stress
I'm the best in the game, not impressed with the fame
I'm testing my aim if I send for your name
The successful are lame, they kept it the same
But whatever the weather, it's destined to change
Couldn't give a fuck for your creps and your chains
You slobber on the mic like a sket giving brain
I'm mental, deranged, crush temples and frames
My pencil will end you like perpetual flames
Burn like syphilis, you nerds are privileged
When I die you can say that you heard the sickest spit
My verse it limitless, the earth is spinning quick
Pure words of wickedness that I merk the rhythm with
Heard you were good, It's a shame that you're not
Don't care about your chain or the fame that you got
Keep my name on your brain cause I came for your spot
What you're making is pot, they say it's a lot
You're whack bro with your kak flow
But you're whack though put ya cap low
Prat go back home
This monster is stronger than Castro's backbone
I attack those little Fapo Caso's
Don't ever get arrogant
Don't start panicking, phone your management
Mumbling, mannering that man are getting mad again
Don't care about your swagger, mandem, or medallion
What's the matter then, magger where's your magnum?
When there's beef, mandem are missing like Madeleine
I've been badder than you and your bag of men
What's happening when I kill 'em with a pad and pen
Ain't got the bars in your pad to match me
Me I'm so fast, you should catch a taxi
Have you got the picture like Paparazzi?
You lack the facts that go back-to-back, b
When I watch you rappers, It's like crazy comedy
I got a 'don't rate this fake g' policy
Fuck ya rewards, I don't rate these nominees
Just little fickle Jay-Z wannabes
You hobos are old and It's oh so true
No promo, logo, or photo-shoot
Fuck your postcode, mobile, and polo suit
My opponents are hoping I won't go true
I'm certainly burning these burglars verbally
Merking these merkers 'til mercenaries murder me
Burstin' and turnin' your burberry burgundy
Guernsey to Germany, Jersey to Bermondsey
True rhymes, ain't got a pen? You can use mine
Ain't stayin' underground like a tube line
I'mma come through and shine, in due time
Which one of you pricks said I can't do grime?
Jungle crosser, nonsense stopper
Continent stomper, the conscious monster
The freedom fighter, deepest writer
Beat up cyphers, the peoples' rhymer
I'm bond to get iller, the sound effects killer
The Malcolm X spitter, the alphabet killer
Not a player hater, lady dater
Maybe later a baby maker
I get slept on like old pajamas
Will I blow up like boats in the harbor?
You spit fire, I'm molten lava
Flow so cold I scold Jafada
Sold your soul for gold and Prada
Who do you know who's flow goes harder?
It's over partner, you know the answer
Drop bombs on the rhythm, no Obama
Baseline murderer, fake guy hurter, race line herder
Face flying all over the place like furniture
I'm back so hard might break my vertebrate
Beat breaker, heat taker, sheet of paper cremater, since a teenager
DJs can't be BKRs cause if they do they'll get PAR'd
I'm back so let me see, the facts are very deep
You prats will never see, I rap to any beat
Pack the pen and plea, practice every week
Attack the melody, and smash my enemies
Not a cenbro, But you're getting dough
With a bent flow jacking off Jay-Z like a little klepto
And the tempo went slow
Done a lot in my lifetime, I was retro
Everybody bow to the kind cause he's back
Whether or not radio was in his track
Forget Nas and his dad, I'm bridging the gap
You think it's just rap, but it's bigger than that
If it's tit for tat, I got the gift of the gat
What you spit is just shit, blood, stick to the facts
You itch like a cat that's addicted to crack
I'm sick of you Prats, cause you shitheads is whack
I'm a g, any beat, I will damage
Very deep, whether it be grime or garage
Enemies better flee, I won't have it
You'll never be ahead of me you blind old maggot
If you really really live crime, don't chat it
If you really really got a 9, go grab it
Then, if you're live, don't hide, don't panic
Just ride like a psycho that might go manic
Don't settle with the rest, cause I'm better than the best
Not just clever, yes I'm intelligent and best you
Better invest in some weapons and a vest
You veterans are vexed, irrelevant and stressed
Keep telling us your rep, but you never get respect
You fed up cause seven of your regiments are messed
You could get a bit of press for that ice on your neck
It's not credit, it's a debt
I'm here for the beat, just save all the nonsense
Murk it whether a rave or a concert
When I'm on stage, make way for the monster
Key to the Game: I came, toured, and conquered
Spit on your bars, I spray more for longer
You spit boring, chainsaw's are stronger
You're a boxer, wait, you're a mobster
Ain't got time for fake Ford impostors
I'm a champ, deep MC and it's blatant
But tramps wanna sleep on me like a pavement
When I speak, I leave them chiefs in amazement
Meanest genius, I'm free like a mason
But I don't sleep with police at the station
I'm writing my rhymes, you're completing your statement
Running from the swine while you're eating your bacon
Don't rip beats, I beat them and break 'em
Most MCs don't believe them or rate 'em
It's no secret, these nincs are just hating
Keep on saying that my team is inflaming
Light fire like them trees that you're blazing
Double P, trouble we, there'll be an invasion
Test us? Get left deep in the basement
Don't care whether you're from Ealing or Leyton
Middle Eastern or Asian...
Little man never did exams
Got a particular bigger plan flippin' grams
'Til a bigger man in his gang gave him a stick to bang
Or maybe just hold cause no one thought he would kill a man
'Till he caught a silly billy villain, chillin' in a jam
Sippin' champs, spliff in his hand, trigger ready to jam...
Bang bang biddy bang biddy biddy bang
Now he's in a camp thinkin' "Damn, what a pity fam."
Rappers are yapping and flapping their lips
'Bout how they're packing and clapping their sticks
Has to be big, the impact it has on the kids
Tell me where the factory is
When the government kill, they're just stacking their chips
You wonder why the youths are strapped and they're pissed
If not a nine, it's a knife getting jabbed in your ribs
People die for the petrol, the gas in the whip
In London, you can get shanked in the heart
Still the government put more tanks in Iraq
Ignorant little spitters are talking greasy
Cause they bitten bitties that they saw on TV
If all you rap about is the hoes and the dough
It's already too late, you sold 'em your soul
You jokers act like you know but you don't
Cause there's little kids dying all over the globe
Many say they know what revolution could be
But many don't know what revolution would mean
It would mean blood, it would mean pain
But it could be us to bring that change
Little hypocrites are spittin' typical nonsense
I'm a black bull because of political content
Laugh at my people while you criminals bomb them
Militant on the rhythm, I'm killing you on the song then
History you won't read in a textbook
Kunta Kinte, I bleed from my left foot
Never see me on the TV with Jedwards
Tell the BBC they need me on WestwoodListen yeah! Lowkey, Double P, Mongrel, check out ww.myspace.com/lowkeyuk
The album, coming out November, Dear Listener
The Mongrel album coming out January, Better Than Heavy, cheez

Listen, this is what we say to them Channel U youths, listen, them little Channel U kiddies, listen…

OK!

[Verse 1: Lowkey]

So what you’re on the telly
What you know about putting out three CDs before you were twenty?
You know that you heard of me
What you know about being eighteen and doing shows in Germany?
What you know about four stars in a magazine?
What you know about the game, waste man I have the key?
What you know about hundred bars on the radio?
Nothing, you weren’t making dough you were lazy bro
You’re following, before you were bothering I was on this ting
Songs filled my pockets with profit, I’m being honest king
Said it’s all politics before anybody hollered it
Turned down chances cos I knew what they were offering
Called out a couple names, had the game gossiping
Never hear Kizzy on the track with Lady Sovereign
Might see me in your girl’s favourite magazine modelling
Pulling up in a tinted whip with a model in
Shot my first CD myself it was astonishing
Stockers wouldn’t stock us now we tell ‘em stop grovelling
Our shottas shot to shoppers and shottas we got a lot of them
Coppers can’t cop it, were coppers so stop copying
Now we’re topping the toppers from Tottenham to Nottingham
All your favourite rappers want us to do a song with ‘em
Me, I ain’t bothered with all of the fake politics
Me, I just live my life and stay positive
Epitome of verse-killing, lyrically I’m hearse-fillin’
Been out for a minute G… surfacing
Your whole trilogy still didn’t beat my worst rhythm
What you figured B, you’re as ill as me, I heard different
See your favourite MC, I nurtured him
And see all your favourite beats, I murdered ‘em
Face it your click is wasted, I won’t work with ‘em
They certainly heard of me from Guernsey to Birmingham
(Woo!) Cos the name holds weight, still I wake up to the same old hate
And pray for a day my face ain’t so bait
I’m a rapper other rappers act like they don’t rate
Cos when DJs get my tunes they play it eight shows straight
Rewind it and drop bigger bombs than NATO make
To be real it ain’t all about the radio play
Cos we all wanna bust, there just ain’t no space
And the games dying, nobody’s getting record sales
Channel U’s full of sweet boys try’n’a impress the girls
The only rappers a lot of bredders have ever felt
Are dead or depressed in jail and never getting mail
When alive they hate, when gone, you’re the best ever
This ain’t a comeback f*ck that, I’m a trendsetter
People talk and get me differently twisted cos
This rap sh*t is the m*otherf*cking business
So what you peddle pebbles, you’re dead whenever my pencil moves
On every level I rep with rebels, you never lose
You resemble devils with terrible tales you sell the youths
You need to fix up yourself and tell the truth
You’ve been rich for ten plus years, still sellin’ crack
Saying that you’re still bustin’ guns, why tell em that?
Knowing that these kids emulate every rhyme you’ve ever spat
You need to get your role models from somewhere else instead of rap
You shouldn’t really need me to explain
You know that you imitate with what you speak and what you say
You’ve got more power than their parents but you’re leading them astray
You don’t tell them that these illegal ways will lead ‘em to the cage
I’m p*ssed. Why? I got d*ck-riding bredders hating
While you spit rhymes that misguided my generation
You’re not real, cos what you’re saying ain’t the truth
You’re try’n’a kill the kids, me, I’m try’n’a save the youths
The future’s removal of humans, computers, pursued revolution
Hell is hot we burn like chips in a pan
At your kid’s birth they’ll insert a chip in its hand
I spent so many sleepless nights pondering reasons why
Most of the good people in my life seem to die
See my eyes take a look, deep inside seek to find
The bottom of my soul, find the hole where my demons hide
All I want’s a peaceful life, but I can’t see it like
Every morning Mum weeps and cries so I don’t even try
Still she teaches me right, stay humble and be polite
But she never saw what I saw on the streets at night
I just wanna see the light, raise a yout’, feed my wife
But they’re try’n’a take away my freedom so I need to fight
Redesign your feeble mind and read the signs, be advised
Either I get it or I’m taking what I feel is mine
My life is like the best book you ever read
Spent nights listening to Westwood and getting vexed
My pen writes when I’m depressed cos I never slept
Bredders step, let’s do it man to man like Red and Meth
You can freestyle all day, I make the best songs
I’m like an insomniac’s bed, rarely slept on
The open mics, you know that’s where I got my rep from
Shady bredders thought they were big but they were dead wrong
Rap with the spitter’s spitters and spit for the rapper’s rappers
I rip the rhythm to ribbons from Britain to Madagascar
Listen to lyricists and I diss all the backwards actors
Dismiss all the killing sh*t cos none of that crap should matter
You know I’m right, go and find a rapper that’s as real as this
He couldn’t battle, the flipping demons that I’m dealing with
I know my life ain’t the hardest but even if you envy what I got
And you wanna swap, we can switch
The artist, slash terrorist, slash Double P representative
Slash the worst rapper could ever diss
Slash activist, slash kidnapper of the president
Slash his wrists and leave a flippin’ slash where his temple is

(Yeah! Cheez, let’s keep going man. I do this all day
MK, Kiss 100 www dot MySpace dot com forward slash lowkeyuk
Dear Listener LP November)

[Verse 1: Lowkey]

Listen, this is for all the hungry rappers out there yeah?

Listen, listen…

Since the day you left I’ve been stuck in place
They say that time heals, but still nothing changed
Every time I close my eyes I see you stubborn face
And every morning I’m home I see my mother’s pain
The day you died, I had a dream where I said sorry
I threw the second piece of dirt on your dead body
When I don’t see Mum for a while I get worried
Cos if she died then that would take the rest of me
Sitting in the hearse, driving to the cemetery
I kept wishing it was me that was getting buried
In a lot of ways, I feel like I’m dead already
Cos it’s October and I ain’t cracked a smile since February
I can feel it in the air, coming I’m just getting ready
I just wanted to hang about but you would never let me
After you passed, advice I was getting plenty
I made you famous because ‘Bars For My Brother’ was legendary
People all over the globe shared in the pain
But how could you leave our parents this way?
What’s worse than losing a son? I compared in my brain
Nothing! While I just sit back and stare at this page
I know you know that I didn’t really hate you
But if you were still here would I appreciate you?
I don’t know, harsh reality is so cold
Dad visits your grave every week but I won’t go
A crossroads not knowing what way I wanna choose
Like I’m cursed to an eternity of solitude
MPs talking ‘bout their bollocks views
I’m having arguments with the telly when I watch the news
You know that feeling you get when the whole world’s on top of you?
Your demons seem to follow you
People say they’re there but don’t bother to holler you
Can’t trust yourself so trusting them is impossible
No one said life was supposed to be fair
Can’t tell people what you’re going through, they won’t even care
You’re not the only one feeling trapped, lonely and scared
Waking up in cold sweats but nobody’s there
You’re in a dark place, running from issues that you can’t face
Conversations make your heart race at a fast pace
Can’t relate to anyone, that’s something that you can’t face
Never ever act like we are, but we aren’t mates
You just ate but you’re still hungry though fam
Walk like I’m young but talk like a grumpy old man
I hate thinking ‘bout the future, why? Cos it hurts me
Imagining myself still living with my Mum at thirty
Really not sure if I’m stable mentally
Cos I always focus on my painful memories
I pray for my family, pray for enemies
Pray for my friends and myself cos I never sleep
Pray for the day I break from this cage and they let me free
Pray that I’m sent to a place that is heavenly
Pray for my present, pray for my legacy
And pray it’s in a positive way, they remember me

Yes, MK, peace and love yeah[Hook]
I know you got a man, I know he treat you right
I know you need excitement, wanna live your life
I know the things you want, you don’t gotta lie
And you don’t gotta leave girl, you can spend the night
Yeah, good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah
I said good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
Damn, come and stand with a real man
The one you with a fucking bitch and I can feel that
You want a man who gon’ respect you and protect you
And don’t see your independence as neglectful
I let you do your thing girl, I know my place
I love the way my shirt is hanging off your shoulder blade
Panty line below your waist, I know he hurt you
But baby, I’ll be your Novocain
Way your thighs shaking around my head girl, I know you came
I know you stressing and wondering why I jetted
‘Cause you trying to be my girl and yet I can’t commit to friendship
You say I hurt the ones I love and don’t respect ‘em
If I hurt the ones I love, it’s just to test ‘em but everything a test
Now everybody passes, all my exes bad so a bad bitch is average
Playing hard to get, it’s better with a challenge
I promise if I want it, I could have it

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
Yeah, you hit him up when I’m with ya
Like “babe, I miss ya” and talk to him while I strip ya
And send him texts while I kiss ya, huh?
You playing both sides, it’s cool with me
‘Cause you ain’t my girl, I know your ass ain’t made a fool of me
You could see that you and me done had our share of women
You and me be sharing women, you be kissing on her
Girl, you tearing in it, you ain’t comparing him to me
We after different things, I just wanna give you orgasms
He tryna give you rings, my favorite thought of you
Is sitting in that loft with you, you show up in my crib
In Louboutins and shit he bought for you
I’m in the car when he call you and you just texting back
Begging me to fuck you raw just to disrespect his ass
Ain’t no commitment, you my temporary chick, right?
‘Cause I got problems, you my temporary fix, right?
No expectations baby, you know what it is
The night belongs to us but mama, you belong to him

[Outro]
I know you got a man, I know he treat you right
I know you need excitement, wanna live your life
I know the things you want, you don’t gotta lie
And you don’t gotta leave girl, you can spend the night
Yeah, good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah
I said good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah
I know you got a man, I know he treat you right
I know you need excitement, wanna live your life
I know the things you want, you don’t gotta lie
And you don’t gotta leave girl, you can spend the night
Yeah, good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah
I said good morning mean good bye, good bye, good bye
Good morning mean good bye, yeah

[Lowkey]

Whether you’re in HMV or KFC, H.M.P. or A&E
I make them see A-N-D let you know the C-A-S-E
From LDN not NYC, on the M-I-C I’m M.I.B
Like BIG, the MVP, VIP to the E-N-D
E.G. my CD is way too D-E-E-P
That goes for your TV screen, DVD or BBC
ITN or ITV, C-O-Ps say ID please
S-T-O-P like IC3, wanna see me hooked to an I.V. G
In a ICU but I’m N-O-T
They went OT with the M.O.B
Can’t see me through the F-O-G
Don’t cuss mothers of S.O.B.s
These MCs are O.A.P.s
Wanna hype up I’m like ‘OK G’
You think your B-A-D get a P-E-N and a P-A-D
If the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. the MI6 and the MI5
Get on the A3 then I drive, turn up the A.C. FYI
MJ like P-Y-Ts, LOL another T-Y-P
I E-A-T on E-I-D, twist CID like Levi Jeans
D-I-E like BNP, EDL just BFGs
Youths don’t want no GCSEs
They want COD on the PS3
I’m like DP or PE or KRS from BDP
Download this on your MP3
Send it to your MP and MTV
Not on this ting like A.D.D
Your CD I rate PG
Like KKKs with AKs my AKA is AA
Take you off the road ASAP
DDT these JLS MCs
What you just saw basically…
Is how to murder the ABCs

Cos I’m back in the booth
Rappers wanna chat about the strap they stashed in the back of the boot
But I chat to the youths, abstract or backpacked
My attributes are stacked to the roof
I capture the truth, pour it on tracks with my views
Then I sell it out the back of the boot
I’m positive you’re negative, you’re whack and confused
I’m back and the fact is your Dad’s in the room
Ain’t a chap that you rappers can battle with
Every chat that I spat is immaculate
Any track that I smash I’m attacking it
Heard you rap fam, your tracks are inadequate
Your CD was cack, it was crap, I’m dashing it
You follow fashion, with rap I’m passionate
Blood starts splashing, your whip you dash in it
Said you were packing a Mac in the back of it
Kizzy, I’m busy, I’m really a brilliant guy
It’s gritty and sh*tty but really the city is mine
If you diss me, pity the silly billy that try
From Bricky to Piccadilly to Mississippi I’m live
Get Milli if you Milli Vanilli’s gimme the vibe
Get Jiggy like Willy spitting the wittiest rhymes
Uncivilised, ignorant, diligent type
And I victimise an idiot a million times
Hey hey we ray-rays will spray flames
Take snakes off the road like AA
So waste brays, vacate and make space
You bait fakes, ain't straight you stay fake
Chase papes, you chase dames like ‘babes wait’
On a lay-lay you date rape to save face
In the same place we maintain and ain't changed
We make tapes that rake papes like Kay Slay
Don’t dismiss or diss this, we live this
From Lisbon to Ipswich
For instance the dick’s got your sister addicted
Oh look! Big tits came for a quick fix
You’re limper than Bizkit, you nitwits
A monster, a beast when I stomp on the beat
If the nonsense you speak is not gonna cease
I’m conscious but leave unconscious emcees
Don’t respond to the beef if you're nonces or NEETS
Get ill upon the rhythm when I kill ‘em with the lyrical
Finish up my dinner then I drill ‘em with the syllable
Don’t really care what you did or what you didn’t do
Little fools are miniscule, spitting isn’t difficult
You found your mind cos I’m outta mine
Fuck a pound sign, came for the crown in grime
I told you once, I told you a thousand times
I’m a fountain of acid you’re alkaline
You alcoholics are out of time
Got a mountain to climb if your mouth is lying
Bow to his highness I’m bound to shine
Let me coach you on vocals and how to rhyme
Think I’m vexed with your indirects
If I spit rhymes next I slit five necks
I’m a big time threat to you pissed sly vets
This guy lives life inside stress
I’m the best in the game, not impressed with the fame
I’m testing my aim if I send for your name
Successful or lame, they kept it the same
But whatever the weather it’s destined to change
Couldn’t give a f*ck for your creps and your chain
You slobber on the mic like a sket giving brain
I’m mental, deranged, crush temples and frames
My pencil will end you like petrol and flames
Burns like syphilis, you nerds are privileged
When I die you can say that you heard the sickest spit
My verse is limitless, the earth is spinning quick
Pure words of wickedness that I murk the rhythm with
Heard you were good, it’s a shame that you’re not
Don’t care about your chain or the fame that you got
Keep my name on your brain cos I came for your spot
What you’re making is pop, they say it’s a lot
You’re whack bro with your cat flow, but your whack though
Put your cap low, prat go back home
This monster is stronger than Castro’s backbone
I attack those little fat bowcats so
Don’t ever get arrogant, don’t start panicking
Phone your management, mumbling
Man are in the manor getting’ mad again
Don’t care ‘bout your swagger, mandem or your medallion
What’s the matter then maggot? Where’s your magnum
When there’s beef mandem are missing like Madeline
I been badder than you and your bag of men
What’s happening when I kill ‘em with a pad and pen
Ain’t got the bars in your pad to match me
Me, I’m so fast I should catch a taxi
Have you got the picture like paparazzi?
You like the facts to go back to back B
When I watch you rap it’s like crazy comedy
I’ve got a ‘don’t rate fake G’ policy
F*ck your awards I don’t rate these nominees
Just little fickle Jay-Z wannabes
You hobos are old though, it’s oh so true
No promo, logo or photo-shoot
F*ck your postcode, MOBO and Polo suit
My opponents are hoping I won’t go through
I’m certainly burning these burglars verbally
Murking these murkers ‘til mercenaries murder me
Burst in and turning your Burberry Burgundy
Guernsey to Germany, Jersey to Bermondsey
True rhyme, ain’t got a pen, you can use mine
Ain’t staying underground like a tubeline
Im’ma come through with shine in due time
Which one of you pr*cks said I can’t do grime?
Which one of you pr*cks said I can’t do grime?
Which one of you pr*cks said I can’t do grime?[Intro: Lowkey]
This one is dedicated to the suit-wearing arms dealers
To the champagne-sipping depleted uranium droppers

[Hook]
Keep your hand on your gun
Don't you trust anyone
Keep your hand on your gun
Don't you trust anyone

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
First in my scope is BAE Systems
Specialize in killing people from a distance
Power is a drug and they feed the addiction
Immediate deletion of people's existence
Who says what is and what isn't legitimate resistance
To push the buttons you don't need a brave heart
State of the art darts leave more than your face scarred
You might impress an A&R with your fake bars
Cause you probably think Rolls Royce only make cars
This is for the colonizers turned bomb-providers
Take this beef all the way back to Oppenheimer
They call it warfare but your wars aren't fair
If they were there'd be suicide bombers in Arms Fairs
Scam for the funds, they will mangle your son
If you try to speak out they will stamp on your tongue
To your land they will come till you stand up as one
It's begun

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
Next in my scope is Lockheed Martin
They will tell you when the bombs need blastin'
Don't think, just listen to the songs, keep dancin'
Do they really want us to have our own brains
Who do you think is really running Guantanamo Bay
And it might be sensitive but I'll mention it
Who do you think has got us filling out the censuses
Who do you think is handing out the sentences
This ain't the BBC so there's no censorship
Heard of many mercenaries gettin' with the clever pimp
Not a gun seller but none's better than Erik Prince
Make money off many things, mainly it's crime
This one is dedicated to the Raytheon 9
Scam for the funds, they will mangle your son
If you try to speak out they will stamp on your tongue
To your land they will come till you stand up as one
It's begun

[Hook]
