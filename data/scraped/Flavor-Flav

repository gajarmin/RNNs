[Verse 1: Flavor Flav]
Well two peas in a bucket
Mother motherfuck it
You either Flavor Flav it
Or you Chuck Chuck Chuck it
Kiss my ass and suck the D.I.C.-
K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me
I fucked that lady in the bed
I missed that pussy and the butt was spread
I tried it again in a thumping wagon
The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging
Tried it again in a field of grass
I missed that pussy and I bust my ass
Then I fucked this lady in the tree
The baby came out and said "Run-DMC"

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
I knew this girl who looked just like you
Light brown and a fly hairdo
I wanted to do her, screw her
So I stepped to her on key
Bitch had more ass than a donkey
I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over
Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over
Just call me the plumber at the end of the night
Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe
She didn't get offended it was splendid to me
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be
I guess I'll just wine her and dine her
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her
Waxing that ass like Raindance
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her
Took her to the Comfort Inn
Tucked her in
Pulled out the third leg pumped it in
She said 'Will you call me?'
Yeah, I'll call you a bitch or a ho after I ball ya
Naw I'm just playin' but it's still the same
Cause a nigga like Ice Cube is only out for one thang[Flavor Flav]
Ha ha
They ain't gon' understand this, Flavor Flav
PAYBACK~! R.G., yo we gon' slam 'em with this one here

Kill that mumbo jumbo, time to rumble in the jungle
Shootin shotguns at the leopards, even lions is the shepherds
Now I ain't got time to tell her, but I'm chillin with Magilla
And I don't mean at the pet shop, but up in Harlem at the wet shop
Eatin on this side of wetson's, spendin all my loot, with the Jetsons
Even the robot drank some oils, so she can lubricate her coils
Tarzan did his best, to bust a nut and beat his chest
He was lookin me up, so I hunted him down
Then I told everybody in the town I said

[Hook]
Unga bunga bunga G! (Unga bunga bunga G!)
Say unga bunga binga bunga! (Unga bunga binga bunga!)
Say unga bunga bunga G! (Unga bunga bunga G!)
Say unga bunga binga bunga! (Unga bunga binga bunga!)

[Flavor Flav]
Think you said rabbit had to have it, broke all his fingers at the lab an'
No hand to shoot his gun-a, so he couldn't catch my runner
So he called out to Speed Racer, but he had no gas to chase her
Then they started doin flips, to Gladys Knight and the Pips
Ring ding dong, ring-a-ding-ding-ding-doooooooong
Ring ding dong, ring-a-ding-ding-ding-doooooooong
Flaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaav, stop this crazy thing!
Flaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaav, drop this song you sing! Say

[Hook] minus last line

[Flavor Flav]
SAY UNGA, BUNGA, BINGA, BUNGA, BINGA, BANGA, BUNGA!!
{*instrumental only until 2:50*}

[Hook]

[Flavor Flav]
SAY UNGA, BUNGA, BINGA, BUNGA, BINGA, BANGA, BUNGA!!

[Hook] - 1/2[Rim'K]
J'dégoupille plus que le protocole
C'est Rim'Dog, la découpe
Quand on parle de tunes
A partir d'un certain chiffre
Tout le monde écoute
Ma liasse qui veut la prendre
J'booste la B.A.C, après je vide les galeries marchandes
Je suis un diamant, je suis le parfait talent
Je suis un subutec, je suis ton médicament
Comme Malcom je surveille la fenêtre
Je suis strict, je suis select
Je suis un fêlé, je suis un fennec
Je tourne au Red Bull
J'allume les niar niar, j'mets la, mets la boule
Je suis un loup blanc dans le poulailler
Un Big Panthers chez les grands joailliers
Garçons au grand cœur, on prend de l'ampleur
On à la folie des grandeurs

[Refrain : Flavor Flav']
We be hot, we be hot
We be burning it up
We be hot, we be hot
We be burning it up
On est hots, c'est la folie, fo-fo-folie, on est hots
We be hot, we be hot
We be burning it up

[Mokobé]
Ça sonne hot, ça bouscule, c'est les playoffs
Ce son a de la gueule comme les frères Bogdanov
Je suis une fusée sur le départ, personne me plante
Je fais pas la queue, VIP, mon pote c'est Jean Roch
Ambiance chaude comme à Ibiza
Notre musique traverse le monde sans visa
Ouais ouais come, faut pas que tu dormes
On vient chauffer des fesses, je provoque des saltos dans tes tympans Tout le monde a bord, ça y est on décolle
Dégouté de la life, tire lui la langue à la Andy Warhol
T'es déréglé comme le nouvel an chinois
T'as le coup de hanches de Shakira
Et parti sa ga na

[Refrain]

[AP]
On cours après la gagne, entouré de V.I.P
A la bouche un Cohiba, pour déguster
C'est l'heure de trinquer, de s'évader
Les potos parlent aux petits paquets
Toujours un faible pour l'liquide
Le son est wicked
Je suis chaud comme les West Indies
Je t'ambiance comme à Nothing Hill
Laisse faire, je maitrise, je t'épuise
Fiesta humm  qu'est ce que t'as?
Je suis arrogant, élégant
Sur la piste des que je lève mon verre
Salut l'artiste

[Refrain][Flavor Flav]
Yeah that's right, we gon' do it like this and like that
Y'knahmsayin, straight from the top
Ha ha ha, that's right it's your man Flavor Flav boy
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH snap, yeah like that, like that
Yeah, like that, what nigga what
We want all the money!
That's right we gon' do it like this once again
2005, comin live with no jive
That's right, KNOCK KNOCK, KNOCK KNOCK, word
Yo check one two

Check out the jookz, neighborhood crooks that plot
Schemin on a comfortable spot that's got new locks
The L train, Friday night 11 PM
2 trucks pulls up, a Caddy, and a BM
First nigga, has the Caddy, he was a lookout
Second on the passenger side, he pulls a oowop
The kid in the backseat, was smokin on a stog'
Beemer was parked at the rock, ready to roll
11 o'clock, on point, waitin and schemin now
Waitin for Flavor to come out, so we can stick him
Move up the stairs slow, don't look suspicious
Only thing you wanna do is just {?} bitches
Did that weak clown, waitin for {?} time
Once set that ain't shit, {?} slash the tires
Cover your face just in case somebody see us
If somebody move, send they ass straight to...
Nigga what, saw the joker jump the turnstile
Snucked up behind him, yo {?} you're alone now
Grabbed the bag real quick, picked up the cheese
{?} was blowin the horn, here come the D's
Flashbacks, it's all about last doin a bid
Violators paroled from some asshole's crib
That was then, this is now, this is a different story
That's right black, cold slapped the employer
Gagged his mouth, tied his hands, he's helpless
Lucky cause we seemed pretty selfish
Cocked the hammer, but they caught the whole jookz on camera
DAMN!!~!!

That 2005 fire right here
They can't front on this
It's that real shit son you know it

Aiyyo, aiyyo the gates of hell, call it a jail cell blizzard
Waitin and hesitatin and waitin for a visit now
The felons is crazy, look at the Timberlands
Your name is John, they'll be callin you Quinton
Seven six, lights out, fights break out
Do you understand what I'm talkin about
Ass be caught in the system, you're hoardin the cigarettes
Givin out nigga threats, givin out bitch threats
You can't escape, you can't face the nightmare
Tell the Joe hell no cause they don't fight fair
Handcuffs, don't make a man tough
They call it justice, but there's just one us - damn!

I didn't even want to say it
They don't want no labels on us
Stay in class, don't get kicked out of class
That's right Flavor boy, back in your face
That's right DeVante they can't front on this
They can't front on this DeVante, they can't front on this right?
Yo they can't front on this, aiyyo
Yo Fido, whassup Fido, they can't front on this?
They can't front on this, that's right
Holla at your boy, holla at your boy, holla at your boy[Flavor Flav]
I'm wit'chu Spider; aiyyo check one two
His cut goes out to all my brothers locked up
In the penal systems all over the world y'knahmsayin
I wrote this cut about a bridge, that takes you to Riker's Island
I was locked up on Riker's Island, C-73, C-76
This is my story about when I was in the mix

[Verse One]
WHEN IT RAINS IT POURS - that's what they all say
Ridin on the big bus down the highway
Thinkin of the next move, ridin in the rain
Headin up the road to the bridge of pain
Only if I woulda, only if I coulda
Maybe I just shoulda, nah that ain't gon' work
I'm fucked up in the game, they got me by the balls
To cross the bridge of pain your ass is right behind the walls
'Fore you at that bridge a lot of shit goes through yo' mind
You stressed the fuck up, ready to spaz
Goin back behind the gate, walk around without a pass
The bridge of pain makes you think of all of that
Doin magic ain't blankin out none of that
Because it's all about reality, your {fucked} up mentality
SO just sit back and face uh, the technicality
This shit is real son, keepin it gully
Cause even after jail when you could be sleepin at your telly
Too late now is the name of the game
Cause right around the corner is the bridge of pain

[Hook]
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain

[Verse Two]
Here we go again, back to this shit
Same old shit, just a different toilet bowl
Hangin in there like a sweater in the closet
Slow motion, is better than no motion
Gotta beat the game tag, gettin caught up in the broom
Police sweep the streets to make room
They don't give a fuck, all they want is rank
Not givin a fuck about what your family think
You get Flavor Flav in the papers
Headline news about all of my capers
Everything that Flavor Flav gotta do hit the news
Front bage to back page, from the jail to the stage
Make crowds outraged all over the world
Around the world 8 times and I'm goin for more
Had it goin real good 'til the judge stopped me
Locked me up and tried to make the world drop me
Simple and plain, Judge Goodman's insane~!
After I saw his face I crossed the bridge of pain

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Mind done ran down the drain, can't make no moves
Loosin all my shippin cause of state boots
I guess they need me, the C.O.'s lead me
Some niggas greet me until they freed me
To cross the bridge of happiness, which do exist
Within the same bridge that you see in the mist
But too late now is the name of the game
Cause right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain

[Hook][Flavor Flav]
I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
And I hope our love never ends
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you it's white ones again

I told you that I would not leave you (wee-hah)
You thought that I was playin games (pow pow pow pow)
So behind my back, you kissed another man
When I found out I said it's, a shaaaaame

I told you I would call the po-lice
She kicked this man out of my house
I heard somethin squeakin way in the back room
And I know that it wasn't a mouse

I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
I hope our love will never end
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you it's white ones again

I only went out to get pizza
And when I came back you, was gone
That was pretty cold, it was colder than ice
My whole world turned to yellow snow

You know I just went plum from crazy
Ass kickin me in the butt with a boot
I pulled out my gun and I aimed it at my head
When I thought about you I did not shoot

I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
And I hope our love ne-verrr ends
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you, it's white ones again HEYYYY

Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee-ha~! Wee-ha!
Go little doggies, ha hee hee

I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
And I hope our love never ends
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you, it's white ones againnnnnnn

I'm hotter, than ice for ya baby
And I hope, our lover will never end
Without you, my world, is like yellow snow
With you it's white, ones againnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn...[Intro]
Yeah, that's right, one more time from the top
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yeahhh yeahhh
Ohhhhhhhh oahhhhhhhhhh yeahhh

[Flavor Flav - singing]
Sometimes you feel like you got no one
And your back is up against the wall
And your legs get real weak
And you feel like you want to fall (want to fall)
All your strength is gone, there's no hope to live
Then you say to yourself - I gave all that I got to give
But I can't give up the fight, I gotta keep it movin
God gave me the power to keep it strong, not losin
God is here with me right now, sure as I rip these flows
Sure as the trees and the grass and the flowers grow
He's the reason why I'm gonna let it show

[Chorus: Flavor Flav]
If you feel like showin some love toniiiiight
Let it show, let it show
If you're happy and you know it and not afraid to show it
Then - let it show, let it show
If you feel right cause you finally got to see the light
Let it show, let it show
Take it from Flav because I'm not afraid to let it show
Let it show, let it show
Let it showwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Showwwwwwwwwwww-owwwwwwwwww-owwwww

[Flavor Flav - singing]
This one goes out to all the people, that sleeps on the street
Who ain't got no money in they pocket, and can't get nuttin to eat
This goes out to all my boys, locked up in jail
That's right we got your back, don't you know we know you didn't fail
This one goes out to our parents, the ones that had us
And don't you know theys got our back, no matter what else happens
Momma I love you, this your son on the radio
Don't you know, that God gave me this power and I let it flowwwwww

[Chorus] with ad libs

[Interlude]
Praise God ha ha
HA HEY! Let it show (let it show) let it show (wah hey)
(Ha hey, ha hey, ha hey)
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Aiyyo check this out
This one goes out to all the people right now that's sleepin in the graveyard
You know what I'm sayin
Old grandmothers and grandfathers, y'know the ones we miss dearmost y'knahmsayin
The ones that's, was very close to us, that just passed away, y'knahmsayin
But that's just their body gone
But their spirit is gonna always be here forever
And y'all need to know that, y'knamsayin
So take it from Flav, because God gave me the power, to let it show
Y'knahmsayin, toe to toe, Flav, let it show

{*ad libs to end*}[Hook - Flavor Flav:]
1,2,3...from New York to Germany
Do you wanna come party with me
Come join the family yo
So let's flow yo
[2x]

[Part I - Afrob:]
Alle war'n bereit dafür und schrieben dieses Stück
DJ Tomekk rief mich an, ich sagte zu und machte mit
Hey, 1,2,3 von New York nach Germany
Das war doch Flava Flav, der Typ von Public Enemy
Und auch Grandmaster Flash und Jazzy Jeff
Mit denen mal 'n Song zu machen, ey das fänd' ich Chef
Das wird was großes voll die Dosis ich sag' was los is'
Wie schlecht dein Reim oder wie gut deine Show is'
Der unglaubliche vertrauliche Ost-Afrikanische, manchmal auch Germanische
Angst mach' ich Dir panische
Als ich kam, hat ich 'n Plan, aber kein' Namen
Wollte alle MCs burnen, scheißegal wie groß sie war'n
Heute rapp' ich meine Takte, natürlich nur Kompakte
Biste cool, rauchste Weed, denn ich kenn die Kontakte
Da findet eine Menge statt, das kein Ende hat
Wir laufen Ränge ab, weil der Rest doch nur noch Scheiß- Gesänge hat

[Hook]

[Part II - Flavor Flav:]
Yo Flash, yo Jazzy Jeff, yo Tomekk
Put the needle on the record
Spin that shit back
Make the party people go crazy on the floor
This cut is world- wide boy we're goin' on tour
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiich liebe dich
I love U G go catch your fish
White meat please that's what I want on my sandwich
I ain't got no burger meat so I ain't makin' no manwich
Flavor Flav back from the grave
Let me be your own I'm on the microphone
Ther's a lot 'o people tryin' to be a Flava clone
But they got bad breath so they stand alone
If you wanna dance you got to play the band
My man my man my man my land
Stay your ass up Ku Klux Klan
I make you fuck your hand
Caught up in the [......]

[Hook]

[Part III - MC Rene:]
Sein erster Reim gab ihm den Kick
Der Groschen fiel es machte *klick*
Ja in diesem Augenblick war klar wo seine Zukunft liegt
Er musste auf die Bretter die die Welt bedeuten
Wollte rocken wie die andern Rapper vor ganz vielen Leuten
Jahre ist es her der Anfang der ist immer schwer
Wie Schönheitschirurgie und Cher, das Mic und er, es wurden mehr
Immer immer mehr die zu seinen Shows kam'n
Immer immer mehr die danach geflasht warn
Er kriegt heute noch ne Gänsehaut
Wenn er in die Menge schaut mit Funkeln in den Augen
Ich hab immer dran geglaubt
Flavor Flav un' Afrob
Mc Reen am Mic
Flash und Tomekk sind am cutten
Don't believe the hype

[Hook x3][Flavor Flav]

[Hook][Verse 1: Chuck D]
Now what, sound of my DJ cuts
Terminator's back on some old fool's track
Takes a nation of sellouts to keep us back
Flippin' disco raps used to be whack
Now what you hear is what you lack
Take a lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Who dropped the bomb on hip-hop
Who got Biggie, and who shot 2Pac
What's forgot? Ain't no Eazy, no Scott La Rock
Now what's rap gotta do with what you got
For whom the bell tolls, is that the way the story goes
85% believing all the videos
God knows who controls the radios
Some people chose the road to be hoes
And so I rose in the middle of all the woes
And Def Jam negroes turnin' up their nose
There's one way in, no way out
No doubt the body count
Gettin' headz checkin' out

[Hook: Flavor Flav]
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down (x4)

[Flavor Flav]
Time to make life shine again like glass
You know I'm sayin'?
Gotta make it shine like glass

[Verse 2]
Outraged against the scene
Proofread the script
Flipped it back so I'm back in gang green
We interrupt this routine, I had a dream
The clean protein smacked the gangsta lean
Between the triple team, wiped 'em out like a drought
Damn, the rap's tetracycline
Them lips foretold these apocalypse
Everything had a shot and got hit with bullshit
Twisted politics tricks I couldn't get with
As one quits another nitwit hits
All the way crazy, shady
World turned upside down, I put it down
Why destroy what you love, look around
Surrounded by chalk marks on the ground
Where the lost got found
Why it all come tumblin' down
Why he and she gotta die
Now how that sound?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
On and on to the break of dawn
Some the 100 meter dash, I'm the marathon
Been around a long time, but the rhyme the same
Sound remains insane, exchange the reign
Ain't that somethin'
Figure I smashed the pumpkin
So I parallel the brains of Cobain
Show no shame like the pain of Kane
Gettin' madd opposition, hip to the game
It's that gran' old PE ammo
Different time, different channel, funky piano
Here to witness get on up with a quickness
S1's in the house with the thickness that get this
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, attackin' they frat
Griff is back, got 5 on it Black
The track got X on the decks
Terminator's back cause a that is whack
On the 1 and 2, yeah, go Flavor
PE hit the road, gettin' set to explode
Fight the power for peace
Can't forget the war mode
Overload, there she blows
Here we go, now you know
Damn another Alamo

[Hook][Intro: Male Interviewer]
Aiyyo, Ice Cube man
Since you went solo, what's up with the rest of the crew?

I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang
See, I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out!
Said, I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang

[Girl] Daddy, where did he go?
[Pop] I'll tell you where he went, goddamn it

[Ice Cube]
Give me that beat fool, it's a full time jack move
Chilly Chill, yo, homie make the track move
And I'll jack any Tom, Dick and Hank
That's the name of the suckers I done ganked
I get away from a copper
Drop a dime, I'll break you off somethin' proper
With the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B, T-Bone and that's J.D
And here's how we'll greet you
Stop!!!
Here we go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Drop an Old School beat

[Ice Cube]
Goddamn, I'm glad, goddamn, I'm glad
Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now, you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the A.K
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Lookin' like straight bozos
I saw it comin, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
When y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Damn, you're wicked, man!!

[Hook: Sir Jinx Scratching quotes below]
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people... on it
No vaseline

[Ice Cube]
Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-C-E
And let me tell you a story or two
About a punk-Ass-Nigga I knew
Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin' up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin' her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red Ridin' Hood, and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence? - y'all I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go

[Interlude: Little Russ]
Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit

Once upon a time in the projects y'all
Yo, I damn near had to wreck a whore
I knocked on the door (*Knock knock*) who is it?
It's Ice cube came to pay a little visit to you
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
Yo, I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Fucked up my night

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Stay off his dick..
(*Flavor Flav sprays Shots all around the place*)Got to get away
Got to get away from yourself - escapism
Uh get away c'mon
Uh Got to get away from your self
Got to get out uh get out

[verse1]
Is the groove good to you
Like when you lose your thing
Forgetting grits is grocery
And eggs is poultry
Making a living against those making a killing
Super black man got your back
And is back in the building
If the prison is that skin you in
And your cell is sitting up inside your skull
They say you can't get away
From your damn self
When your earth is heaven
And your world be hell
Check your head because
Armageddon's at the foot of your bed
You ain't heard a word I said
Forget them slacks
I'm that throwback that
Threw that throwback
Back on the racks
To get my mind back

Oh say can you see
I get back its still black and white uh like an old TV
In lying color brother
Gots to getaway to the other side uh
Talk about escapism

Got to c'mon now
Escapism
Gotta get away
Uh talk about ?
Got to get out of myself baby
There must be some kind of way up out of here

[verse 2]
[Flavor Flav]
You see I never was too good
Off the top of my head
Cause i want y'all to know
Exactly what i said
This so-called war in Iraq
Over a thousand dead
Thats 10 a week
Even as i speak
[Chuck D]
Now 33% of black males in jail
That's 55% of black students will fail
They say 85% of black folks forgot
We were slaves once
Up inside this box
[Flavor Flav]
America got folks brains on lock
Forget the connects
Some wanna buy what's next
[Chuck D]
Wear it like some sign up in that chest
Y'all should know papa don't take no mess
If you think your past is irrelevant
Don't you know old soul pays the goddamn damn rent
That messiah ain't never
Gonna come as long as
You thinking freedom is free to being dumb (boyee)

Chorus x 2
C'mon escapism
Got to c'mon now
Escapism
Gotta get away
Uh talk about ?
Got to get out of myself
There must be some kind of way up out of here

[verse 3]
[Flavor Flav]
You say that Soul is back
So flip them hits back
[Chuck D]
Damn the fashion
I wanna know where's the passion
Thinking we came a long way baby
Saying poor Michael's psycho
And Prince he's crazy
But what has Bob Mick Sir Paul
Done for you lately?
[Flavor Flav]
How they maintain on your brain
Seems to escape me
[Chuck D]
Heard some ghetto cats
Don't like metal rap
[Flavor Flav]
Hear it and fear it
And they think its all wack
[Chuck D]
They don't even know
[Flavor Flav]
That the blues is black
[Chuck D]
And when i rap I go back to the roots Where I be at
Not some 30 year old who don't know facts
[Flavor Flav]
Who's wild saying things like some juvenile
[Flavor Flav & Chuck D]
Remember 2 million black folks in the penile
Got a world of white folks
Thinking its style
Think I'm hating cause you lack the information
Cause we the FBI still got on file

Escapism c'mon now
Gotta get away
Gotta get out of myself uh
C'mon nowHa ha ha hee hee hee, OH SNAP, ha ha ha

When I'm the road I keep my dick in a raincoat
Flip with a rainbow
'Pon ton, wonton soup and a eggroll
And I get my petrol from Mexico
And my weed come from Texaco, that's just to let you know
They locked me up and you see they wouldn't let me go
I asked myself "Yo Flav how the hell we get here yo?"

And I see the beginnin for me
That's when, I got
Caught with, the gun
And then they locked me up
And they broke the key, you see
I had to do my time like everybody else
Then they took Jam Master Jay off the shelf

Came around, the nigga would be ground round
So here we go
Just like K-I-M, keep it movin
Nigga what, nigga what
Up on your face with a cigarette

[Hook][Verse 1]
You say that you'll want me, you'll hug me, you'll hold me
You'll squeeze me, you'll feel me, you'll please me
Deep in your heart you'll know I'll never let you go

You say that you'll go anywhere and do what we do best at
We'll leave it up to the rest
Deep in your hart you'll know I'll never let you go

[Hook]
Did I ever tell you I would not be your best friend?
Didn't I tell you that I love you to the end?
Deep in your hart you'll know I'll never let you go
Didn't I tell you true love was hard to find?
Cause what we have is one of a kind
Deep in your hart you'll know I'll never let you go

[Verse 2]
You think when I go to the club with my boys I get girls
But I would never do that to you
Deep in your hart you'll know I'll never let you go

I promise to death do us part, for better, for worse
Till one of us at the pen that hurts
Deep in your hart you'll know I'll never let you go

I think that you're cheating on me
You think that I'm cheating on you, so what we gonna do?
Deep in your hart you'll know I'll never let you go

You're banging on me, I'm banging on you
Babygirl, you know what we gotta do

*Laughing*[Verse 1: Flavor Flav]
Well two peas in a bucket
Mother motherfuck it
You either Flavor Flav it
Or you Chuck Chuck Chuck it
Kiss my ass and suck the D.I.C.-
K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me
I fucked that lady in the bed
I missed that pussy and the butt was spread
I tried it again in a thumping wagon
The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging
Tried it again in a field of grass
I missed that pussy and I bust my ass
Then I fucked this lady in the tree
The baby came out and said "Run-DMC"

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
I knew this girl who looked just like you
Light brown and a fly hairdo
I wanted to do her, screw her
So I stepped to her on key
Bitch had more ass than a donkey
I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over
Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over
Just call me the plumber at the end of the night
Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe
She didn't get offended it was splendid to me
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be
I guess I'll just wine her and dine her
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her
Waxing that ass like Raindance
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her
Took her to the Comfort Inn
Tucked her in
Pulled out the third leg pumped it in
She said 'Will you call me?'
Yeah, I'll call you a bitch or a ho after I ball ya
Naw I'm just playin' but it's still the same
Cause a nigga like Ice Cube is only out for one thangInterviewer: We begin this morning with our exclusive interview with Conrad Murray the doctor convicted in the death of Michael Jackson
Conrad Murray: I don't feel guilty, because I did not do anything wrong,I am very very sorry for the loss of Michael, Michael is a personal friend, I.. It is heartfelt, this has been painful

[Payback Music]

What is wrong with you son

That's right four years

He didn't really have your back
All he wanted was your money everybody knew that [Word]
He didn't even have your best interest
All he wanted was your money to build up his interest [Dr. Murray]
A careless doctor [Go on]
A doctor who could care less when your body is lifeless [Word]
No matter how big or small
Ended by [?] and Propofol [Four years]
Now the King of Pop is gone [Word]
Because he ended up in hands that was wrong
Dr. Murray I hope your time is long

[Michael Jackson]
Yo Mike we miss you G
[Michael Jackson]
It all stopped when your heart stopped
[Michael Jackson]
Yo Mike we miss you G
[Michael Jackson]
It all stopped when your heart stopped

I don't know where you got your license kid [word]
Did you get it on the back of the box [I think so]
I wonder how it feels Dr. Murray listening to them jail locks [Dingeling]
Who gave you permission to practice
The mistakes you made adds up to [?]
Michael Jackson was a flower [word]
Came in to full bloom and came into power [[?]]
He became bigger than The Beatles [That is right]
Then Conrad comes poking him with needles [Dumb Motherfucker]
Knowing that the man was weak
Michael Jackson didn't know he was getting a geek [Word]
As a motherfucking doctor
All this guy had was needles and a knife
So Conrad Murray I just want to know how is your life
Now motherfucker

In grimy hallways, slingin nicks and treys
When it's on then it's on and poppin, shots lickin
I'm spittin this shit for the hood, Glock clickin
Tension in the street, we stressed, still wanna eat
I walk through the valley of death, the hotstepper
Holdin red pepper, everybody on reach

Pen stroke, excellent quotes of literature
Nights over Egypt, black as Arabia

Aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo I got the whip smellin like lemon
Roger Clemens jerseys the man blew seven cold coolies in the Worthy and
I crush those rappers, keep the toast near the rad-iator
We like our guns warm, it's easier to make the papers
Stayed off, the cape came off, Ghost G'd off
The track's like doin six months and I'mma beat off
At the airport attention always flow in my direction like
You let the best then sparkle his perfection and
Bitches be askin them, Ghost you got so much shit
You need to cash in, bracelets matchin 'em

[U-God]
Yo, yo
Line Cadillacs to blocks, Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx
Jukebox records, flatfooted cops
Get automatic systematic jumpin in your socks
Mama's apple pie in the park hopscotch
Reunited on the radio, Wu-Tang superb
In the sprinklers girls double-dutchin on the curb
Sinatra, the pop the Jackson 5 recordings
Uptown Saturday, "Cotton Came to Harlem"
Ringmaster circus was, Bailey and Barnum
Crack a Coca-Cola, summer heat was my boredom
Dr. J before Jordan, Al Green on the organ
When Rerun did the dance, the whole world saw him
The blackout fears, Foxxy Brown, Pam Grier
Ford motor gear, your life and times queer
"Smokey the Bear", Burt Reynolds gray hair
Throw 'em some gems, throw up your fists and say yeah, it's

Two wrongs don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT - don't make it right
Two wroooooooooooongs, RIGHT

When we first started off as bein friends
Havin good times over and over again
And then we fell in love, our feelings were so strong
After four years long, what went wrong?
You didn't believe me so I didn't trust in you
You gotta watch out for your feelings cause they ain't all true
Feelings can be right and feelings can be wrong
Without trust it won't be strong, it won't be right

Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it ALRIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT - don't make it right
Two wroooooooooooongs, RIGHT

You'll do things to me, I do it back to youuuuu (RIGHT)
What goes around come back around, this is true
We gotta put the past behind us, move forward like we should
Just like K-I-M, keep it movin it's all good
God gave me power to have strength to forgive (RIGHT)
Livin right within yourself is how I want to live (RIGHT)
God knows how I miss my first three kids (RIGHT)
But there's this foul shit that their mother did
It wasn't RIGHT

Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT - it don't make it right
Two wroooooooooooongs, RIGHT

Two thousand and five, Flavor Flav

Ha ha
They ain't gon' understand this, Flavor Flav
PAYBACK~! R.G., yo we gon' slam 'em with this one here

Kill that mumbo jumbo, time to rumble in the jungle
Shootin shotguns at the leopards, even lions is the shepherds
Now I ain't got time to tell her, but I'm chillin with Magilla
And I don't mean at the pet shop, but up in Harlem at the wet shop
Eatin on this side of wetson's, spendin all my loot, with the Jetsons
Even the robot drank some oils, so she can lubricate her coils
Tarzan did his best, to bust a nut and beat his chest
He was lookin me up, so I hunted him down
Then I told everybody in the town I said

[Hook]
Unga bunga bunga G! (Unga bunga bunga G!)
Say unga bunga binga bunga! (Unga bunga binga bunga!)
Say unga bunga bunga G! (Unga bunga bunga G!)
Say unga bunga binga bunga! (Unga bunga binga bunga!)

[Flavor Flav]
Think you said rabbit had to have it, broke all his fingers at the lab an'
No hand to shoot his gun-a, so he couldn't catch my runner
So he called out to Speed Racer, but he had no gas to chase her
Then they started doin flips, to Gladys Knight and the Pips
Ring ding dong, ring-a-ding-ding-ding-doooooooong
Ring ding dong, ring-a-ding-ding-ding-doooooooong
Flaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaav, stop this crazy thing!

[Hook] - 1/2[Rim'K]
J'dégoupille plus que le protocole
C'est Rim'Dog, la découpe
Quand on parle de tunes
A partir d'un certain chiffre
Tout le monde écoute
Ma liasse qui veut la prendre
J'booste la B.A.C, après je vide les galeries marchandes
Je suis un diamant, je suis le parfait talent
Je suis un subutec, je suis ton médicament
Comme Malcom je surveille la fenêtre
Je suis strict, je suis select
Je suis un fêlé, je suis un fennec
Je tourne au Red Bull
J'allume les niar niar, j'mets la, mets la boule
Je suis un loup blanc dans le poulailler
Un Big Panthers chez les grands joailliers
Garçons au grand cœur, on prend de l'ampleur
On à la folie des grandeurs

[Refrain : Flavor Flav']
We be hot, we be hot
We be burning it up
We be hot, we be hot
We be burning it up
On est hots, c'est la folie, fo-fo-folie, on est hots
We be hot, we be hot
We be burning it up

[Mokobé]
Ça sonne hot, ça bouscule, c'est les playoffs
Ce son a de la gueule comme les frères Bogdanov
Je suis une fusée sur le départ, personne me plante
Je fais pas la queue, VIP, mon pote c'est Jean Roch
Ambiance chaude comme à Ibiza
Notre musique traverse le monde sans visa
Ouais ouais come, faut pas que tu dormes
On vient chauffer des fesses, je provoque des saltos dans tes tympans Tout le monde a bord, ça y est on décolle
Dégouté de la life, tire lui la langue à la Andy Warhol
T'es déréglé comme le nouvel an chinois
T'as le coup de hanches de Shakira
Et parti sa ga na

[Refrain]

[AP]
On cours après la gagne, entouré de V.I.P
A la bouche un Cohiba, pour déguster
C'est l'heure de trinquer, de s'évader
Les potos parlent aux petits paquets
Toujours un faible pour l'liquide
Le son est wicked
Je suis chaud comme les West Indies
Je t'ambiance comme à Nothing Hill
Laisse faire, je maitrise, je t'épuise
Fiesta humm  qu'est ce que t'as?
Je suis arrogant, élégant
Sur la piste des que je lève mon verre
Salut l'artiste

[Flavor Flav]
I'm fakin no moves and fakin no jax
Flavor Flav is back on the dome relax
I push all the buttons around this bitch
I'ma go get money from Bill Gates, get rich
So I can build me a psycho-loft
So I can go psycho with my Micro-soft
Flavor Windows is the new invention
Colorful windows to get the attention
(Knock knock) Flavor Flav is eatin with Bill Gates
Bill, had to have a certain flavor
To have the highest, bank rates in the world
(Word up) But he don't stand alone
Joey Fatone, is in my bones
Jackie Hamilton, dollar bill
Sittin real high on Capitol Hill

Givin you more of what you bargained for
Flavor Flav - back in your face
Mess with my kids and I'll catch a case
Y'knahmsayin, I ain't playin
It's all in the message I'm relayin
Right here in DeVante's studio
That's where I'm sayin, that's right
All the way to Penn Station, Jackson Station and the nation
Feature your generation, yo Flavor Flav is out
Two steps automatic and I'm out kid[Flavor Flav]
I can't hear nuttin though
Alright, where you want me to start at?
Aiyyo you can kill the music then
Yo, check one two, check one two in the place to be
From the bottom to the T-O-P
That's right, Flavor Flav, Public Enemy
From Bronx to L.A., we don't fail
Kickin right here for 7th Veil
My man Kool Keith, H-Bomb, no jive
Yo, H-Bomb, hit 'em in the head son

[H-Bomb]
No blazes, tennis shoes and denim
Pimp I got the gators, leathers I kill 'em
Your bullshit events, don't play right
No tribute awards for Mr. Barry White
It's Guantanamo Bay, industry's gay
Hard to get rich, I don't swing that way
That switch to funny make record in Kingston
Jesus is black, tell Mel Gibson
Who wears a skirt, Sting and Dave Navarro
My strap, my money, don't lend, don't borrow
The Sunset Strip is Gaza Strip
Your clothin line is shit, H is fuckin sick!
The rap game industry too quiet
Hehehehehe hah hah Atkins Diet
No backpackers pro-athlete actors
I rep for pimps, pushers, jackers
The P on the fitted I'm all for pimps
I throw ropes down for my niggas in the clink (yeahhhh boy!)
First and foremost, the industry don't want it
Fuck it, I take what I want and flaunt it
I'm not vexed, they spend for sex
Who's next after Michael, fuck Funkmaster Flex

[Flavor Flav]
Yeahhhh boyee, kickin it for 7th Veil
That's right, H-Bomb (fuck the industry, fuck it)
Kool Keith (fuck the industry nigga fuck it)

[Kool Keith]
No game here, I shit on you ill son
Fuck Hollywood's best guest list
Maximum dead-ass parties with flat-ass Paris Hilton
My shit shine bright with Von Dutch wipe
Jockin my gators, bitches with fake titties act like
They don't suck dick, can you see me under the standard light
Fuck the red carpet, I'm in here with standard hype
You just at the crib on Sycamore
Your blonde cocker spaniel, my rings shine in your face
Youse a asswipe, you basketball player nut and scrotum jocker
You the givin ass type, with the Minnesota Timberwolves
Garnett's clockin your ass pipe
Ugly monster-face bitch, you think you dressed tight
Evil bastard, you make your grandmother upset
Don't flush the toilet motherfucker, you tryin to start a fight
Release the shit off my chest, get rid of the gripe
I shit inside your grey and white Nikes
Exercise your fat stomachs, no hamburgers at Chevies
You ride them fuckin bikes
Corny-ass 42 year old player's club bitch
The funky face motherfuckin Wanda Sykes
That baldheaded motherfucker just put a weave in, on UPN
Whack-ass tattoos above your titties
Your hard faced bitch, you'll see me again
Like Faith Evans is the only one that sniffs
All you cocaine motherfuckers in the hills
Even Vivica Fox is a ugly bitch, chasin Curtis for his chips
Engineer, just put me in that mixNo, I'm not gonna rob you
No, I'm not gonna beat you (Beat you)
No, I'm not gonna rape you, so why you want to give me that funny vibe
(Funny, funny vibe, funny, funny vibe, funny, funny vibe, funny, funny vibe)
No, I'm not gonna hurt you
No, I'm not gonna harm you (Harm you)
And I try not to hate you, so why you want to give me that funny vibe

[Flavor Flav]

[Verse One]
Y'all don't wanna make me war
What the hell is we fightin for?
I wanna make peace
In the South, in the North, in the West and the East
Everybody wanna listen to the President
Even though we ain't nothin but residents
Instead of goin for war
I'll get up on the dance floor
Get up on the dance floor
Everybody move your feet to the beat
Get up on the dance floor
If you wanna dance battle let's compete
Get up on the dance floor
DJ put that record on
Get up on the dance floor
Get up on the dance floor!

[Chorus]
(Get up on the dance, flooooor, c'mon)

[Verse Two]

I'm ready to go and hit the town (that's right baby)
My boss just gave me my check (hoooo)
I got crazy loot it's goin down (chop chop)
I'm goin to hit the first club (yeah)
Step to the bar, break out some dubs
Champagne, girls beats galore
I'll take it all to the dance floor
Everybody talk about how stupid Flavor Flav is
Spendin his money in the club
But I'll rock, everybody in the party
This is my money, it belong to nobody!
Get up on the dance floor
Everybody move your feet to the beat
Get up on the dance floor
Get up on the dance floor!

[Chorus][Flavor Flav]
I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
And I hope our love never ends
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you it's white ones again

I told you that I would not leave you (wee-hah)
You thought that I was playin games (pow pow pow pow)
So behind my back, you kissed another man
When I found out I said it's, a shaaaaame

I told you I would call the po-lice
She kicked this man out of my house
I heard somethin squeakin way in the back room
And I know that it wasn't a mouse

I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
I hope our love will never end
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you it's white ones again

I only went out to get pizza
And when I came back you, was gone
That was pretty cold, it was colder than ice
My whole world turned to yellow snow

You know I just went plum from crazy
Ass kickin me in the butt with a boot
I pulled out my gun and I aimed it at my head
When I thought about you I did not shoot

I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
And I hope our love ne-verrr ends
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you, it's white ones again HEYYYY

Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee-ha~! Wee-ha!
Go little doggies, ha hee hee

I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
And I hope our love never ends
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you, it's white ones againnnnnnn

I'm hotter, than ice for ya baby
And I hope, our lover will never end
Without you, my world, is like yellow snow
With you it's white, ones againnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
