We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not bout' that life man, catch him in traffic

[Hook: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not 'bout that life man, catch him in traffic
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action
I lost so many niggas, turned into a savage
And real life, no movie shit, bitch we clap
Where I'm from? This Chiraq, you get left as a tragic
Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic
And where I'm from that's 300, normal spelled backwards

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Letting a nigga goon me, I can't imagine
But I'm out here in these streets, catch me in traffic
My niggas shoot for free, they'll let you have it
My niggas do it for me, ain't no way around it
Blood hound for that money, bitch I gotta have it
Going crazy, 20's, 50's, 100's, bitch I'm cashing
And I ain't really with the talking, bitch I'm money stacking
And he ain't really bout' that life, cause he don't love that action
And they don't come from where I come from, they wasn't born a savage
Late night shit, catch him in traffic
I ain't really gotta talk, bitch catch me in traffic
And you know I got it on me, so I'm never lackin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
We don't really play, homie we about gun action

Chief Keef bitch I'm savage, I'm paper stackin'
Pistols get to clappin', niggas get to lappin'
Bad bitches packed up inside a Maxima
That bitch gon' give me neck, neck like a Dracula
Fuck nigga talk shit, delete him, no schedule
That bitch want some ransom, she say I'm handsome
I need me a dancer to come and dance up
On me while I'm wildin' and I'm throwing sets up
I need me a dancer to come and dance up
On me while I'm wildin' and throwing sets up

Michael Jackson got them fiends just like Thrilla

You a stranger talking and I don’t feel it
If I don’t know your momma, I'mma make him feel it
Heavy Armor-All, you know I wanna shine
Bitch, I need it all, each and every dime
Photos taken, four-door Maybach, I know you hating
Staying with women from Staten Island, my flows so flagrant
We the realest, pistol concealed, my percentage
Higher than yours, Cash Money, I see no limits
Port of Miami, then I drop Trilla
Ex-dope dealer worth eight figures

[Hook: Lil Reese]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just got back from Turks and Caicos, hoes all at the villa
Only nigga making albums with no fucking filla
New deal on the table, look like 'bout like ten milla
Shout my lawyer, man, he a contract killa
You know 305, Ricky, that's my fucking nigga
Did this shit right here for Baka, Preme, Styles, and Gilla
Did this shit right here for Reese, Sosa, Fredo, Durk
You let Drizzy get a verse, you gon' get this work

Them other boys well known for letting niggas starve
We eating good, not my fault, it's Wingstop's
My new home look like it's Al Capone
My new bitch look like she in them folds
My new watch look like I had it stole
Barry Weiss told me I'm gold, God forgives, I don't
Me and Drizzy like The Beatles, nigga

We let 'em stare, but we don't see them niggas
We don't see them niggas

[Hook: Lil Reese][Hook: Lil Herb]
On my soul
Lost too many of my niggas out here in that field (On my soul)

War time niggas ain't on non', my niggas gon' drill (On my soul)
Young nigga all I know is get money give a fuck how they feel (On my soul)

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
On my soul in the field, 'member plain nights
Totin' pipes, trappin' sellin' white trynna get it right
Came straight from the block now I'm on the mic
Cockroaches all in the trap, used too spend the night
Yeah nigga I need the money, fuck fame
Ima' stay the same, never change
I be with the gang, sippin' purple lean, switchin' lanes
30's in they hands, so don't run up on this Range, jewels run up in yo' brain boy
Real nigga everybody should clap for me
But in the field everybody don't clap for me
My niggas real guaranteed they gon' clap for me so when I get them bills Ima' pay for they accuracy
Now everybody juss' be plottin' on everybody , the feds prolly' puttin' dead bodies on there bodies
And these niggas snakes , I ain't rockin' wit' everybody
If any nigga play, we got choppas' for everybody
A couple niggas might've said they my mans prolly'
But understand, I'm that nigga to everybody
He ain't from the land then he ain't my mans prolly
We got a song then he payed me the bands obviously
Bitch can't ask me for my money man, bitch over my dead body
And I promise that my money won't stop Ima' stack 'till I get too the top, put it...

[Hook: Lil Herb]

[Bridge: Lil Reese]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Man I can't do shit for no nigga, niggas never did shit for me (On my soul)

R.I.P. Lil' Roc, Vito, Fazo and real Pistol P (On my soul)
Smoke a blunt now I'm back at it
Smoke a blunt now I'm back at it
Smoke a blunt now I'm back at it
I'm workin' hard 'cuz my tape shoulda' been dropped
And bro's shit goin' nuts for the crack addicts
Meanwhile bitch I'm focused on my mathematics
All this money in the world, yeah I gotta have it
I ain't trickin' on a bitch, that's a bad habit
I'm juss' whippin' at my wrist for a black Aston
I'm ridin' 'round through the city blowin' loud by the fifty run up on me and we black maskin'
I don't ride wit' the mask but I ride wit' the Mag, I juss' drive and the Macs blastin'

[Hook + Bridge]

Lil' nigga get the top, push back on my block everyday nigga I'm good

[Hook + Bridge][Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Karate kid bitch, I got a lot of kick
Smoking on that president, no politic
Some niggas getting rich, ain’t got no common sense
I woke up this morning I might buy your biz
If she look, look, look she get took, took
Two cups, two blunts longer than your foot
Hair long, money long, everything long
I’m a rapper so I fucked her with my chains on
James Bond swag, check my watch and swerve
Need a clock on my rims so they could watch the curve
I am high, so high I need a skyrocket
And it look like a phonebook in my pocket

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Two cups, two blunts
I am high, so high I need a skyrocket

[Ree$e]
Yeah, it's 2 A.M. and I'm swishing through like two lanes
Got two dames and they only in a two things
Got drugs and sex, and yeah, they want it in like two ways
Enough to go around, they on that head like toupee
Young nigga, but I’m O.G
Like broke chain in two ways
You acting, I’m flexing
Get lost bitch, like loose change
Brought the son of a bitch that rock two chains
Got diamonds all on my tooth, hey
It's axed out, you assed out, for fashions I cast out
I hit the runway, tell the cameraman to pose me up
A couple bands every time a blogger post me up
(bandz a make her dance)
She wanna day when I go and eat that girl for lunch
Get two of this, cop two of those and doubles, that’s my blunt

[Hook: 2 Chainz]

[Boy Wonder]
Man, we loose, lock the door
Kick it like I’m wearing soccer clothes
Flex, nigga, stop and pose
I don’t rap, I do rock’n’roll
If she loud then she got to go
Hoover Dam can’t stop the flow
Yeah, I'm popping, ho
Just put it in your mouthlike a popsicle
Colder than an icicle, I ride on this beat like a bicycle
Chase ‘em in a mouse hole
Fuck you wearing, nigga, South Pole?
Take two shots of this Patron
And take two hits of this bomb dro
I'll leave you John Doe or drop you off in the Congo
Last of the Mohicans, shout out to my Puerto Ricans
Trinidad Jame$ flow ‘cause right now nigga I’m geekin'
Sweeping you shall find a hope, you find wherever you seeking
Two cups, two blunts, two mollys and it’s turnt up all the way season
Flex

[2 Chainz]
I fly so high I need a skyrocket[Intro]

[Verse 1: Reese]

Early stages of addiction, my mind still attached
Still able to keep this paper with this monkey on by back
My friends don't really notice cause they all high too
Hit a lick for a brick, and its all mines too
Greedy like a motherfucka, nobody could stop me
Sweets for weeks and every single day we shopping
Cases of that rozay, pounds of that kush
Keep the circle small, its hard line we gon push
Ain't no man greater than the team that he's on
Some people fallin' off when their dreams is all gone
Folks washed up, their self-esteem is all gone
Told 'em, talk to Allah there can be no wrong
So it's one for the money, two to keep me blowed
Three to keep us [?] when there nowhere left to go
And [?] take effort, best effort's not enough
And the love you have to lose, it keeps slippin' through the clutch. (Mob!)


[Verse 2: Casey Stacks]

Have you ever had a feeling that something wasn't right?
Imagine living with that feeling everyday your life
And this shit is so strong its burning on the inside
I really want to right my wrongs but I can't quit getting high
And I can't quit ridin' round with that 30 on my side
Cause I'm still in the streets where some of my peers died
Then they say they hold me down but I just wanna fly
Probably never make it to the top but I just wanna try


[Verse 3: the Jacka]

They locked my nigga Kaz(?), now he he doin' life
He said that the time was the smallest price
Can't be with his kids is the suicide
But now he see the plan they have for you and I
The pig getta [?] all day they cruisin' by
They look us up and down, they plan to raid to move us out
Of our communities, gangstas establishing unity
I won't sell out to this system so they try to ruin me
They hope this shit just blow over so they won't lose to me
Everyday a new listener is asking, "Who is he?"
A nigga tempted by whispers to do some evil things
So I try establish prayer and I illegal(?) game
Gimme the paper ma nigga cuz I don't need the fame
I call [?] with the creator, its what I need the game
Still I'm trying to make a switch so we won't need the game
I'm tired of breaking the promise that I won't leave again
I chop it up with old timers, they told me just to stay
I'm seeing zeros and commas same time I catch a dream
I'm seeing niggas had it harder so I can't complain
I'm seeing life as that a barber's who once was a king
In the streets where a strong man weeps
When he thinks of his mistakes
So on we can't sleep till the sun rise
In search of a fun time
Lost love, hope she thinks of me sometime[hook: Bosstop]
Flexing, you was young and flexing
All the time reckless, I was young and reckless
All the time neckling, she gon give me neckling
All the time rapping, boy I keep that weapon
All the time, All the time, All the time
All the time, all the time, nigga all the time
Nigga all the time, nigga all the time

[verse: Lil Reese]
Weapon, that FN is my weapon boy you better not test
It I  got foe'nem yeah they wack shit some say we reckless

If you hold cash I need it
Then fuck that bitch I could've hit but guess im too conceited
If you owe me I need it
Make that bitch get on her knees and to [?]jesus
We catch a opp right now man that boy gon' need jesus
KuKu gang they with me too man and all they do is squeeze shit
All the time
And if you get snatched you better do the time
All the time, all the time
And if you get snatched you bett' not drop a dime

[hook][Verse 1 – Gucci Mane]
Turn me onto a big enough lick and Imma learn to love you
Put that chopper in your name so I got to fuck you
If you fuck my homeboy then I can never trust you
Give a shoutout to my new bitch, she a fucking hustler
I got a new bitch, I got a new bitch
Yeah I’m riding round the city with my new bitch
Got my old ho mad, she a broke bitch
And plus I got the kind of money that we both rich
Jump out the yacht bitch, we going shopping

I fuck with Hollywood court but ain’t no Hollywood nigga

[Verse 2 – Fredo Santana]
Riding round LA with my new bitch
Counting blue face hundreds, count a few licks
Hit the trap, bounce, whip a few bricks
Baby fall back, you know I does this
Think it’s all fun and games, just music
Till a nigga pull up, get to shooting
Fredo ain’t getting money, man that’s nonsense
On Front Street, got the trap jumping

And we keep them tools around so please don't get near
Ok, hold on I'm broke, I guess I'll take what's there

Any day and we come outside, got 30 on us we ain't tooless
And 300 that be my squad, we gone show you how we do this
I came up from shit, I look around now like who this
No new faces, we shoot shit
From 300 to O block, boy all my niggas ruthless
We catch an Op, we shoot shit
Them broke boys ain't got shit
Stunt on them, make them sick
Damn phantom eli had to do this shit
Pull up on them in a new whip
Damn boy how the fuck you do that shit
Every day it's a new bitch, I hit her then I pass the bitch
Can't stop me, it ain't going down
Might let off thirty shots up in this bitch
Smoke so much kush, by the pound
Try to play them games get man down
Why you talk, ambulance pick em up now
Try to play them games get man down

[Hook][Intro: Lil Reese]
Gangway shit man, Lil Herbie, what up?

[Hook: Lil Herb]
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
Catch a body and bond from the station in the same day
Money out the way, but our location in the same place
I remember days when we stayed by that gangway
Young niggas, but we never played by that gangway
Cold hearted killers get you blazed by that gangway
They like "y'all gone get enough of hanging by that gangway"
We trappin' hard, but we still bangin' by that gangway

[Bridge: Lil Herb]
Them niggas from that gangway'll put in work
No problem only your conscious could get you hurt
If you try to hit us up, we gone come and hit you first
Team full of solvers and problems come with a shirt

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
Catch a body it's nothing, I bond out then I beat the case
And I be in that gangway, where my gang stay
Getting money and fucking bitches at the same time, that's how I play
And I be in that gangway, fuck nigga coolin' where it ain't safe
Out here in this gangway, my niggas wildin', boy, we don't play
That's how we rock in that gangway
I'm getting money while they gangbang
300 shit we not the same thang
I'm falling back while she give me brain
Get jammed up, just don't mention names
Keep my circle tight cause I don't fuck with lames
Got my circle tight now they say I change
I wouldn't change for a lil' change
And I be in that gangway, where them gangs stay
Catch a body it's nothing, I bond out then I beat the case

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
In that gangway again with the Macs
Everybody strapped, red beam for his back
The opps ridin' past, let them opps ride past
50 shots from the Mac on the scene where they left
Gotta stain on some pounds and some keys where they at?
My team gotta eat, anything for the stacks
I gotta have money like fiends to the crack
I keep the iron on me, ion reach for the Gat
Wake up gotta hit the streets with the Gat
I can never lack, go to sleep with the Gat
If ion got it on me you should reach for the strap
Gotta lotta heat from the beef that we got
Niggas hatin' on the squad cause we beasts in the trap
Lil Herb takin off, put the East on my back
We be really in the field, just riding through the block
If you ever wanna see where the street niggas at
Me and Lil Reese going wild in the city
Off the loud and the Remy, .45 in the semi
Kush smoke car ride blowin' loud in the Hemi
Catch a nigga outside, give him 5 to the kidney
Get ghost, in that gangway where I be at
Lotta drugs on me if you need that
Gotta lotta niggas wit a lotta triggas
We'll drop a nigga, where the weed at?

[Hook][Intro: Fredo]
Bitches say im handsome kidnap yo ass for ransom
Finna be a killa season let me call up Cam'ron

[Hook: Fredo]
If it's a problem let me know lil' nigga
We can go to war
In the kitchen stretching work my nigga
Whipping with the fork
Say it short got it all my nigga
But we can work it out
Turn a two into a fo' my nigga
It ain't hard at all

[Verse 1: Fredo]
The way I tote my gun, you would think im james bond
Come to my trap its at least 'bout thirty guns
Come to the trap she giving head im in the bathroom
Nigga dissrespect leave em wet bloodied in a tampon
Bitches say im handsome kidnap your ass for ransom
Its finna be a killa season let me call up Cam'ron
Just flew from over seas nigga just to meet my damn plug
My shooters shoot for no reason you dont wanna wit them boy

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lil Reese]
If its a problem let me know my nigga we gon' solve em all
We got thirtys we got choppers we got handguns we got revolvers and all (the foes and all)
You want no problems over here nigga, and we don't go by the law (nah)
All them problems are getting solved nigga, and it ain't hard at all (nah)

[Hook]Bitch we grinding
Want it?
Come and take it from us nigga

[Hook: Lil Reese & Lil Herb]

Young niggas grinding
Killers stay behind me
Shit, ain't hard to find us, cause we always shining
Look at all these diamonds
Forgiato riding
Horny model smashing
Semi-auto sidekick
But we just out here grinding, grinding, grinding
We be out here grinding, grinding, grinding
Scared money not making money; you know we got it
Got that shit, then come take it from us
See we grinding

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]

Take a look up in my circle, new niggas can't find it
Pull up on your bitch so fast, just watch how fast she climb in
Whenever I'm out in traffic, that .30 be my sidekick
If we catch an opp in traffic, we gon' let him have it
Young living savage, all my niggas savage
Take a nigga down for whatever, just to have it
And I heard he got it
I be in the hood a lot
I ain't hard to find, bitch
I be on my grind, bitch
I be on my grind, bitch
I be toting 9 shit, Extendo with the rubber grip
That is hard to find, bitch
Extendo with the 30 clips, you can not just find it (Naw)
Turn up on a fuck nigga, call it perfect timing

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb].

You can see me grinding
Or in the GT smashing (Errk)
Me and Reesy spazzing
A million, easy access
Smoking weed relaxing (*Inhales*)
What you mean we taxing? (Taxing?)
Double G designer (What?), Louis V pajamas (What?)
Tempurpedic mattress, the nina sleep beside it
Don't need a bitch, I'm savage (Naw)
Think all these bitches average (Yup)
I'm busy stacking cabbage
You know what that mean
Got a lot of green
50 hundreds in my Robin's jeans
I'm a Prada fiend (Damn)
Pull up on them and I start the scene (What?)
Bitches see me, they just start to scream
No it's not a dream
Wanna suck and fuck me, gotta knock the team (Yup)
Get a night of fame (Yup)
Later shorty, I forgot her name
Now I'm posted trying to knock a block of 'caine (I got it)
If you run up on me, then I'm popping things (Bow!)
It is not a game (Bow!), now you mopping brains (Bow!)

[Hook]
