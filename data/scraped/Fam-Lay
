[Intro: Billy Blue]
And now Ladies & Gentlemen, Lupe Fiasco
Know you gotta sit there and remember this one, Lupe
Had to get Blue on this track, you feel me?
HOLLA AT 'EM, WHOA
That's all I appreciate right there man
I live for this shit, nigga, you know what I mean
TALK TO 'EM

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Car cosigned by my mama
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Car cosigned by my mama
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Background check for a chopper
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper

[Verse 1: Billy Blue]
I got my chopper full and my black tee, slide
My baby mama done fucked up on her food stamps
That’s three muscles recertified
I’m riddin', niggas be watching, they don’t want these problems
When them bills due, niggas get ready cause no bullshit I’m plottin'
I’m a government baby, let me get my cheese, let me get my cheese
Got a Seven Tray in my mama yard, sittin' on D's
I’m bout this fee, I’m bout this fee, just know what’s free
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth so don’t critique
Look at me nigga, just a young hood nigga tryna get this cake
I don’t need to be givin’ out how school gon’ educate
Filet mignon for my food stamps I know mama credit quite good
So I’m out here with this dope money got a big body in my hood
Nigga you see it, better believe it, this what I’m bout
Got a trap house I be boomin’ in, fiends in and out
Cut the check anyway it come nigga, section 8
See we straight, see this money I make, this block can stay, ha

[Verse 2: Buk of Psychodrama]
(Yeah bitch) Filet mignon with my food stamps
Would tell you I don’t but it wouldn't be the truth
Let me hit you back on my government phone
Still a hood nigga, whatcha want me to do?
We get a blunt and a joint out of sawbuck of loud
Where I’m from we be actually hoopin’ in Jordans
Five dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes
Ain’t nobody finna do shit important
People really don’t give no fuck about nothing
Although they may smile and be cordial
Dealin’ around with the wrong damn crowd
Then bring a frown to my friend up in an alley, we warned you
Background check for the chopper, the barrel
Breathin' back down the neck of imposters
The murder rate ain’t back down yet
Cause they ain't wrote that down yet to the nigga that was tryna say somethin’
Some people, listen, you could be predisposed or be preconditioned
Or speak with the preacher, been preaching be the person
To be some process in your progress or be the prevention
I just live my life and I don’t stop grindin’ until God tell me to
I get money, I ain’t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?
They say my kind ain’t welcome everywhere, well I can deal with that
But those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them it's still a fact
So mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine
You’ll solve you'll find that this is best for everyone involved
All in all, the Lord my witness

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trouble]
Permit, don’t need permission from a doctor
I been smokin’ since a pre-teen toddler
I been servin’ since a jit tryna dodge all the obstacles
My teachers all told me that were probable
Probable cause, no cracka never really had it
I was just a nigga in a high price whip
Yea, I’m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto
Well you better have extension on the clip
Well beef comes around in the town more often than these bitches emotions
I got a yapper, five dollars, off the streets (Yeah I'm totin')
For protection more than anything though.. (You gon' test my devotion)
My first amendment right, they violate it anytime we outspoken
Chicago violence boostin’ up but we just focussin’ on other environments
Cause the country is taking notice
More fiends are risin', Molly the new dope and I
Apologize cause it was something I was promotin’
Chopper in my bitch name in case I light somebody up
You just tell them it was stolen
Rich gunplay, shit that’s all they see that’s all they know
Without it kinda hopeless
Said this is in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said out their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me Trouble you gotta put the mack down
Felonies all in your background
Said this is in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said out their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me Trouble you gotta put the mack down
Felonies all in your background

[Verse 4: Trae tha Truth]
I used to run up in your crib with shit that go ‘blaka
Nigga tryna brick my squad like I’m Waka
I don’t want a single chain I can’t rocka
Heard em' tell me life is a bitch, can’t stop her
Even if I could, I tell ‘em I wouldn’t knock her
Til I get that section 8 and then swap her
Baby mama tax return, new dropper
I might wanna go silk that bitch like I’m Shocker
All of my whips wetter than a water house
Food stamps getting flipped, what that water cost?
Yea I’m actin like a nigga that ain’t never had shit
Filet Mignon, porterhouse
My little brother on his medical shit from that block street
Nigga health care insured by that guap
Doorways ain't hiding me, no stop
Jackers playin’ overseas with they yacht
Shit I probably be the same I find drama
Law’s out lookin’ for me like Osama
I don’t wanna do no bid, yo honor
Still waitin’ on my one phone call from Obama
Tell ‘em I need the chopper, they tellin’ me I'm a felon
I'm tellin' 'em they got it wrong, I beat the case in '97
And I'm well acquainted with Hell but I’m tryna make it to Heaven
But they don’t want me to make it, that’s why the niggas be tellin’ me
If I don’t get the chopper I’mma probably run up inside them
They better gimme a answer, I’m tryna be cool
If I don’t get it then everybody gon’ fear it
Every week I’m finna make ‘em repeat it like they in school
Bed blues, everybody open up somethin’
You can move all you want just not sudden
It ain’t no thinkin’ I was playin’ I am not frontin'
The mentality of a goon, I am not stuntin'

[Hook]

[Verse 5:  Fam-Lay]
Storm is gone now it’s all clear
The road was long but we all here
Now go and tell, I don’t care
2014 is our year
Big shout out to the whole streets
This goes out to all that knows me
All y’all pussy niggas, holies
Y’all play tough guys but call the police
Look I don’t care, I don’t share
I keep me a bad bitch with long hair
I send them choppers around there
When I’m somewhere sittin’ in a lounge chair
Overseas, blowin’ tree, blowin’ green, throwin’ B's
Livin’ like life is supposed to be
And if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me
To the top, couldn’t stop, had a major deal but it wouldn’t pop
Nigas hated on me but I wouldn’t stop
And now life sweeter than a puddin’ pop
Think so slick, come and get me dog
None of y’all niggas fuckin’ with me dog
Some of y’all niggas comin’ with me dog
None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dog
You think an echo was y’all
You need to think tactical dog
We laughin’ at y’all
While you thinking me and Lu radical, naw
Seein’ this shit that keep goin’ on
Then pick a different zone for your mobile homes
Store fingerprints on your mobile phone
When you sippin’ that shit we keep blowin’ on

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
I’m bout that, I’m bout that
That Bentley out in that driveway
Cost more than my house did
Fuck land, I’m fly today
First class if I fly
Credit card ain’t mine
Don’t know how I’m gettin’ back
But in luxury I arrive (TURN UP)
IPhone in my baby name
Long way from that chirp
Strip pole in my bedroom
But I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
Miley Cyrus on that bullshit
But a real nigga can’t judge
That for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college
Missed out but no pyrex
My Harley got low milage
This white carpet in my project
30 guns in my section, none of the homies got aim
My side bitch said she pregnant
But I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
And this one is mine, I don’t trust his mama
So he don’t got my name
Cheap rims on  my ride
Mirrors loose as my beat pound
I ain’t addicted to shit
My weed man on my speed dial

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lupe Fiasco]
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
AR-15 with collapsible stock
Picatinny rail with a three-point harness
With 150 round magazine and a dot
Ay, FMJ’s by the box, nigga
Got the same setup as the SWATs, nigga
Shouldn’t find that surprising
Cause I bought the muthafucka from a cop
Ay, seen a lot of brown money as a shorty
Welfare baby can’t afford me
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Excuse me, as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete myself
My opposition is not pretending
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself
Fuck being a hip hop purist
When I'm  spendin’ 50 thousand on Securus
Embrace the contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It’s why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen can’t fill us, Medicare can’t heal us
And the mamas can’t stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride
With an L up sayin’ "free da guys" like I’m Durk
With a clean record but I’m cursed
To make a half a million off a verse
Nigga, chop

[Outro][Intro: BIA]
Uh...ya know...usually
Normally I wouldn't be this arrogant or cocky but you know I'm feeling like new money lately cause this is a lot of new things goin' on, takin a new turn in my life

[Verse 1: BIA]
Uh, yo
New money, callin' me new money
On my way, BoA, I'm laughing like who funny
Primadonna, this beauty before my honor
I could keep it wet for you baby I'm like a signer
Oh, you nasty? Oh, she wally wally
Oh, she trashy? Oh, she prolly prolly
I do this effortless, nothing goes off the check-it list
Movin' on up in this bitch I feel like The Jeffersons, huh
Let's get deeper, don't let the devil defeat ya
Lost my laptop last night whoever found it can keep it
I just motivated me to sit and write it little deeper
Come and penetrate ya speakers and I never use the penis
I be hearin' other rappers like "I never wanna be this, Lord"
"This shit too hard" (Oh yeah)
This that type of shit that had Augustus fighting Caesar
And I'm more simplistic, nina
And I would lyrically defeat ya, God

[Hook: BIA]
I got my money up baby I chain swang [x3]
I chain swang, ch-ch-chang swang
I got my money up baby I chain swang [x3]
I chain swang, ch-ch-chang swang

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Ay cuz I hang out with guns
Sometimes I wear Uggs, Kanye shrugs
I wear jackets the same color as bugs (Woo!)
My niggas puff buds, a hundreds dollars a puff (Woo!)
Sometimes I fly the same planes as Puff
Sometimes them planes ain't enough
I rock Céline like I'm a queen
But I'm not a drag, Hermès rag, Hermès rag
I had the biggest fuckin' size that...uh Hermès had
They be like
Is he that or is he this
Is he really riding in Rolls Royce like Richie Rich, click it bitch
It's on the internet
I got a 'Rari souped and that bitch fresh to death
I would keep talkin' about it except
I only drove it once that's the last time I left

[Hook: BIA]

[Verse 3: Fam-Lay]
Look, there's a lot of motherfuckers I don't speak to
Cause there's a lot of motherfuckers gettin' seen through
Actin' different when they get 'round certain people
So I act like I don't see 'em when I breeze through
Look, look, look
Fam-Lay was never 'bout that phony shit
Speak one week, next you don't know me shit
Don't get me wrong don't erry nigga owe me shit
If it's a problem I'd respect it if you'd told me shit
Man, these bustas tryna find nice things to say over your body
I'm in the back seat sippin' Bacardi
Demon spits sparks from the shotty
I guarantee if you wake up it won't be a Bugatti
Vroom, [?]
You say my name, lights flick, I'm in the mirror
Pair of angel wings, dressed in all white
I hang ya angel wings for this long flight

[Hook: BIA]

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Pack up, nigga
That's right
And I ain't takin' none of my ad-libs out, neither![Verse 1: Fam-Lay]
Hmmm...yes sirrrrrr
Rock and roll, man roll and rock
I got tens, got twentys, got fifty blocks
I got smoke to buy, coke for sale
Sold much coke, got coke in jail
In the white Rolls Royce with my man Pharrell
This lil' nigga got beats too fresh to be stale
But I'mma take you back to the early eighties
When my cousin Stacey had the pearl Mercedes
My aunt cousin Wack had the black on black
Ac' coupe Legend with the gold in the back
I was just a lil' young'n runnin' wild as hell
Runnin' round wild trynta get that mail
Lil' shorty dudes trynta learn the grooves
I was twelve years old brought it to the school
Cause I was quick to flip, quick to sell that shit
You ain't from the hood, y'all don't know bout this

[Hook]
But if you feel me, throw your bows up (Star Track)
Try to set up shop get glowed up
Hey, I'm the candyman, I got mo' than frozen cups
I got your chop top sour diesel roll-ups
Fam! we can roll up (Star Track)
But Fam! don't try to roll up (Star Track)
Don't make me pull these motherfuckin' fo's up
Cause it's like that

[Verse 2: Fam-Lay]
The fiends is dyin', things is lyin'
Missin' on the streets, so the fiends is still buyin'
Right on time and money on the mind and
On them twenty-fo's, them bit-ches straight shinin'
But y'all niggas don't know bout this
Fresh new kicks with the new outfit
Got the all black top with the black on black
You ever see me creepin, just back on back
Cause I got that pump and it is gon' spit
I ain't no punk and I ain't no snitch
From a place on Earth called Huntersville
Where people out there got love for real
Got love for all who got love for me
If a coward ever ran then it wasn't me
I'll be on the curb movin' dubs and d's
And if you ever bought a dub then it was for me
I ever get caught then it was to be
I'mma just make bail by my cousin E
Back on the Porsche with the mobile phone
Like eleven in the mornin' them hoes to go home
Trynta score and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the hood, y'all don't know bout this

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Aww shit, this is the part when the fight just start
When the fists get to swingin' and the four-fifths spark
And then the bitches get to runnin' and the bitch just scream
And we spin off in Rolls and it's so damn clean

[Verse 3: Fam-Lay]
I stand on my block, the cam on the spot
My hands in my pocket, both hammers is cocked
Waitin' for a nigga to just act up
My right hand big six, got my bait back up
Niggas lookin' all jealous, lookin' mad as hell
Actin' like lil' girls, like tattle-tales
Mad cause my right hand bad as hell
I would've kept shootin', but I had a sale
See, I'm a crime boss three sixty-five
Lookin' for a Nina Ross, she just can ride
Picked up my cash and slide all sweet
Nigga tried to snatch ass, knocked his heart off beat
Nigga talk trash like the shit all sweet
Won't'cha all take the cash dogg, not off me
Hustlin's in my veins - you cannot stop it
Walkin' on the block with life in my pocket
I'm trynta score and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the ghetto, y'all don't know bout this[Pharrell] OWW!! Getting!!

[Hook - Fam-Lay]
When the car roll up and windows roll down
And you see the sawed off, nigga better hit the ground
We getting busy!! You better haul ass dawg!
You better haul ass! You better haul ass dawg!
You better haul ass! (OWW!! getting!!.. OWW!!)

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
I'm blasting, nigga laying in the street cause
Talked shit, so I hit 'em wit the heat
Runts moving, keys like oz's
Like a cliental, errbody know me
Running! running from the 5-0
Drug life, and it's all about survival
Hustla, known worldwide dawg
I'm in the game and I'm bout to drive by y'all
Gambler, 4 - 5 - 6ing it
10 grand in the bank and I'm sticking it
Bitches, got 'em by the dozens
From their mammy, to their sisters to their couzins
Star Trak, is the crew that I run with
Nigga don't get murdered over dumb shit
Fuck you! it's how I'm caring if
Nigga try to start beef and we burn it

[Hook]

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Hey look I'm sick of niggas saying what they gon do when they see me
Soon as they see they don't do shit
The nigga Fam-Lay too slick
I got a handful of guns and a few clips stupid
You keep sending death threats, uh! and I ain't seen death yet
Nigga I can't help that I ain't been murdered in my life, look
Look I been stopped giving a fuck about living
Ever since I got beat up by them faggot ass cops
But now I just stand on my block and drink liquor
Wit my niggas and my bitches and we keep them gats cocked
Uh! won't hesistate to blast you niggas
Spray your corner, bodies falls in the Ac my nigga
Uh! I'm pulling out the dagger nigga
Cause when I finish wit these shells I'm a stab a nigga

[Hook]

[Bridge - Pharrell Williams] (Fam-Lay)
Let me tell ya boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (Fam-Lay!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (Norfolk!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (Huntersville!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin but let me tell ya
Boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (with the Clipse!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (Coldchain!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (Star Trak!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Nigga fuck all that punchline shit, that young rhyme shit
That shit that might blow only one time shit
Cause when I rhyme bitch, my rhymes fit
The mind of a gangsta is all time, bitch!
Kill who you riding wit
I got some niggas from Virginia riding wit me
And them niggas trying to buy this shit
So fuck who you party wit!
Cause we get high as the Karate Kid, now let's go!
Pop junk, I pop trunks; Got a 10 shot Glock pump
That'll stop trucks, ya cocksucker!
Shoot a lead trying to get a rep
I shoot the lead at his head now his man tryin to get 'em help
Fam don't play wit chirin [children]
Act stupid, act dumb, act foolish, act deaf like you ain't hear em
Bring it to the forefront, I got a lotta niggas that tote guns
Now let's do it!

[Hook] (w/ bridge in background)[Hook]
I got your bitch skrung owt, she keep callin'
She see that four wheel, she see that on me
Fresh Caesar, no fitted
I'm all about my digits she's so on my di-dick
Fam-Lay keep it poppin' in the streets
Yellow juice take a sip have a seat
And I'ma bang her, 'til her tongue out
I got you singin', now say it with me
Got your bitch skrung owt
I got your bitch skrung owt
I got your bitch skrung owt
I got your bitch skrung owt
You better get her mane

[Verse 1]
Oh shit, they done did it mane
Fam-Lay came through in that kitty thing
And your girl tryna get it mane
If you in love with ya girl better get her mane
I'm a pimp nigga peep how I play
Ain't got a limp nigga I ain't gotta say it
But I'm the coolest you can put your soul on it
New jewels old money with the mould on it
Hang in the beach house ass cheeks out
You know what I be about 'bout to freak out
Uh, and I'ma put it on her like I own her
The sad part about it I don't even wanna

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It ain't much y'all can do with me, got the crew with me
New sneaks and my shorts cost two fifty
Ain't such thing as too picky
Got an eigth of that dro and an ounce of that blue with me
Try to tell me that she ain't kinky
Got my new wrist watch with a mean pinky
And my pocket full of green Twinkies
She either lying or she blind as Ray Charles claims she ain't seen me
She said she doesn't lay with just any nigga
But she wanna lay with this Virginia nigga
Got your bitch gone while you sit home
When she in the shower you tryna switch phones

[Hook][FamLay]
It ain't nothin' y'all can teach me
I been locked up more times than Sweet Pea
See I'm from Norfolk here's a coffin if ya slee-py
Turn ya children into orphans tryna sneak me
Or tryna creep me, the realest shit I ever spoke
So I'ma spit it when I finish, I'mma slit my throat
This shit is like 211 mixed wit coke
Leave you spinning like the tennis balls in ya spoke, nigga
Dark secrets, man I won't lie
They came to the light a man is gon' die
All hope is lost and FamLay's gon' fry
Cause I did shit the average man just won't try
Like what? War against an army wit a hand gun
I'm FamLay, and when my fucking chance come
I'm running wit it, on e'ry song I'm coming wit' it
See some you think you can take from me, then come and get it
See I'm from Huntersville, e'ry thang we done is real
My niggas come in here, my niggas come to kill
And I dare y'all to try to dis us
See you in the streets it ain't nothing discuss
Maaan, we gon' stomp yo ass dead in the ground
FEW WEEKS, couple bodies wit no head'll be found, nigga
Cut off ya wrists, and they feet no prints (Gangsta)
Now I'm in the Six, (Gangsta) wit the heat no tints, you see me boy

(Pharrell)
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang

[Pre-Hook - Fam-Lay]
If you hear a shot nigga, think of me!
Cause if there's a stressin there's no question I'm a ride
Just conceal my identity!
I'll fulfill my requests if you heard that I die
A thousand niggas jumping, a thousand niggas bowing
Niggas making money, a thousand niggas throwing
Thousand niggas slanging, a thousand niggas banging
Selling that H nigga, selling that caine

[Hook - Pharrell Williams] (8x)
Here come the amalance! (woo! woo! woo! woo! woo!)

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Uh! Fam-Lay uhh! I bet you heard of me
But there's some cowards out there who tried to murder me
Now they got em in ICU Surgery
Cause I burnt their ass up to the 3rd degree
I got that H, I got that D
And if you need it homie you can get a pack from me
Word on the street is that them people after me
But I'm a scrambler, won't let em capture me
I got my bag, a case of gin
Pocket full of, tattoos all in my skin
We got gold teeth (uh) ducking them police
On the corner all night getting no sleep
This how we do, how real is this
I'm from Shark City, big fish eat little fish (Norfolk!)
This is my hood, and I'm a represent
I've been riding round wit shotguns ever since

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Chicks is braiding hair, fellas out clocking
Chil'rin everywhere, old folks is out watching
Gotta be Traintogo in this harsh world
Full of nothing but hood niggas and park girls
We all down to ride, for that homicide
We prepared to go long as the drama ride
Run up on your roads, open your suicide door
Take the umbrella and treat it like a 2 by 4
We are ignorant, we don't give a shit
Fuck who started it long as we finish it
Come up to your club, got a thousand deep
All the six of us waking you out your sleep
I don't give a fuck, let the cor'ner pick em up
From what I did to em, left his corner spitting up
We could go to war, till the death of me
If you want beef, WE got the recipe

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Pharrell put me here, to put these streets on lock
Now that I'm in here, we can't be stopped (Star Trak!)
I'm a carry it raw, till the day I die
And keep it street, as days go by
I'm in erry spot, the rawest clubs
I'm on erry block, wit all the thugs
My family locked up, know what this about
Got enough couzins wit me to get you out

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook][Hook]
We be rockin' with the beach cruiser
Beach cruiser, stacking on the handlebars
You could ride wid me

[Verse 1 - Famlay]
Look, I'mma be 100 with you
If I can't get no money with you
I ain't running with you, I ain't even come and get you
I ain't being funny with you
Can't do nothing with you
Let your other cousins come and get you
Cause behind my nickle, look, I'mma find my pistols
And shoot my way up out the courtroom like I'm Brian Nicols
Look, it's a blessing from the Heavens if I ain't twist you
Normally, the passenger seat'll be dying with you
Look at you: bullets is the issue
Bullets rip through tissue, bullets rip through gristle
Let a physician fix you
Look, I'm a missile, inside a silo
Cause I know that my flow is like white folk's assault rifles
Sometimes I'm might go Psycho
Sometimes I'm might go  Michael
I'm not no psycho, no this not no fucking typo
I type on iPhones: you vs me is a no-no
White string long, Yo-Yo

[Hook]
We be rockin' with the beach cruiser
Beach cruiser, stacking on the handlebars
You could ride wid me

[Verse 2 - Famlay]
See all that mess they talkin bout?
They never block him out, they never NARC him out
Singles keep on poppin out
See what people talkin bout?
See what he's talkin bout, see what she talkin bout
T.Y.B.O. poppin out
They mic on the right song my right palm
Like lightning. My right palm is napalm
My icon ?, skate or your bike on
Your fuck on, you fight on
Then bygones be bygones
C'mon: you can ride, you can go, you can slide
You can roll, you can fly, you can float
Hypnotized by the spokes, it's alright if you smoke
We can ride to the store
Meet up: time to re-up, break a lead up
Heat up, light the weed up, beat the beat up
Feet up, put your seat up, put your Vs up
A down, this is a teaser

[Hook]
We be rockin' with the beach cruiser
Beach cruiser, stacking on the handlebars
You could ride wid me[Verse 1: No Malice]
I go against the grain, see I’m in my own lane
They only seem first ‘cus I’m in reverse
It’s like I moonwalk on em
Ain’t nothing like having said yes to your calling
I get better with age while time’s evolving
I’m a vintage wine, I’m a retro Jordan
So mature, Mr. Thornton
If I turned my back you’d be left orphaned
I caution against sun belief
I guess that make me old school like a dungaree
But my britches don’t sag, bout riches I don’t brag
But somehow I can’t help but to show my ass
Class is in session
Chain heavy like opression
The new me got em dancing
So I tell em if they got any questions read them

[Hook: Famlay] (2x)
It’s a ______ shame, you stayed in the game
It’s a _______ shame, the things people to say to make some _______change
When you dropped your top you lost your _______ brains
Hah, let me think about it

[Verse 2: No Malice]
Within every lyric, you can tell when you hear it
The KRS-One, black cop in my spirit
Twilight saga, the flow cannot be mirrored
Only by its grace we escape judge and juror
One thing I’m sure of, Lord as my witness
Show me 10 kingpins, I’ll show you 10 snitches
They said I lost my mind but I got all my senses
Nothing but the truth in all my sentences
Always gave me truth
Even in my offences the feds came knockin
Turned all my niggas Christians
We was in the kitchen, watering the pot
Playin Top Chef til Tony got shot
Wake up call, it was like time stopped
But you gotta love Tony cuz the dime never dropped
Yes, the check is in the mail
Commissary baby and your kids are eating well

[Hook: Famlay] (2x)[Intro: BIA]
Uh...ya know...usually
Normally I wouldn't be this arrogant or cocky but you know I'm feeling like new money lately cause this is a lot of new things goin' on, takin a new turn in my life

[Verse 1: BIA]
Uh, yo
New money, callin' me new money
On my way, BoA, I'm laughing like who funny
Primadonna, this beauty before my honor
I could keep it wet for you baby I'm like a signer
Oh, you nasty? Oh, she wally wally
Oh, she trashy? Oh, she prolly prolly
I do this effortless, nothing goes off the check-it list
Movin' on up in this bitch I feel like The Jeffersons, huh
Let's get deeper, don't let the devil defeat ya
Lost my laptop last night whoever found it can keep it
I just motivated me to sit and write it little deeper
Come and penetrate ya speakers and I never use the penis
I be hearin' other rappers like "I never wanna be this, Lord"
"This shit too hard" (Oh yeah)
This that type of shit that had Augustus fighting Caesar
And I'm more simplistic, nina
And I would lyrically defeat ya, God

[Hook: BIA]
I got my money up baby I chain swang [x3]
I chain swang, ch-ch-chang swang
I got my money up baby I chain swang [x3]
I chain swang, ch-ch-chang swang

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Ay cuz I hang out with guns
Sometimes I wear Uggs, Kanye shrugs
I wear jackets the same color as bugs (Woo!)
My niggas puff buds, a hundreds dollars a puff (Woo!)
Sometimes I fly the same planes as Puff
Sometimes them planes ain't enough
I rock Céline like I'm a queen
But I'm not a drag, Hermès rag, Hermès rag
I had the biggest fuckin' size that...uh Hermès had
They be like
Is he that or is he this
Is he really riding in Rolls Royce like Richie Rich, click it bitch
It's on the internet
I got a 'Rari souped and that bitch fresh to death
I would keep talkin' about it except
I only drove it once that's the last time I left

[Hook: BIA]

[Verse 3: Fam-Lay]
Look, there's a lot of motherfuckers I don't speak to
Cause there's a lot of motherfuckers gettin' seen through
Actin' different when they get 'round certain people
So I act like I don't see 'em when I breeze through
Look, look, look
Fam-Lay was never 'bout that phony shit
Speak one week, next you don't know me shit
Don't get me wrong don't erry nigga owe me shit
If it's a problem I'd respect it if you'd told me shit
Man, these bustas tryna find nice things to say over your body
I'm in the back seat sippin' Bacardi
Demon spits sparks from the shotty
I guarantee if you wake up it won't be a Bugatti
Vroom, [?]
You say my name, lights flick, I'm in the mirror
Pair of angel wings, dressed in all white
I hang ya angel wings for this long flight

[Hook: BIA]

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Pack up, nigga
That's right
And I ain't takin' none of my ad-libs out, neither![Produced by DJ Dahi]

[Intro: Billy Blue]
And now Ladies & Gentlemen, Lupe Fiasco
Know you gotta sit there and remember this one, Lupe
Had to get Blue on this track, you feel me?
HOLLA AT 'EM, WHOA
That's all I appreciate right there man
I live for this shit, nigga, you know what I mean
TALK TO 'EM

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Car cosigned by my mama
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Car cosigned by my mama
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Background check for a chopper
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper

[Verse 1: Billy Blue]
I got my chopper full and my black tee, slide
My baby mama done fucked up on her food stamps
That’s three muscles recertified
I’m riddin', niggas be watching, they don’t want these problems
When them bills due, niggas get ready cause no bullshit I’m plottin'
I’m a government baby, let me get my cheese, let me get my cheese
Got a Seven Tray in my mama yard, sittin' on D's
I’m bout this fee, I’m bout this fee, just know what’s free
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth so don’t critique
Look at me nigga, just a young hood nigga tryna get this cake
I don’t need to be givin’ out how school gon’ educate
Filet mignon for my food stamps I know mama credit quite good
So I’m out here with this dope money got a big body in my hood
Nigga you see it, better believe it, this what I’m bout
Got a trap house I be boomin’ in, fiends in and out
Cut the check anyway it come nigga, section 8
See we straight, see this money I make, this block can stay, ha

[Verse 2: Buk of Psychodrama]
(Yeah bitch) Filet mignon with my food stamps
Would tell you I don’t but it wouldn't be the truth
Let me hit you back on my government phone
Still a hood nigga, whatcha want me to do?
We get a blunt and a joint out of sawbuck of loud
Where I’m from we be actually hoopin’ in Jordans
Five dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes
Ain’t nobody finna do shit important
People really don’t give no fuck about nothing
Although they may smile and be cordial
Dealin’ around with the wrong damn crowd
Then bring a frown to my friend up in an alley, we warned you
Background check for the chopper, the barrel
Breathin' back down the neck of imposters
The murder rate ain’t back down yet
Cause they ain't wrote that down yet to the nigga that was tryna say somethin’
Some people, listen, you could be predisposed or be preconditioned
Or speak with the preacher, been preaching be the person
To be some process in your progress or be the prevention
I just live my life and I don’t stop grindin’ until God tell me to
I get money, I ain’t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?
They say my kind ain’t welcome everywhere, well I can deal with that
But those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them it's still a fact
So mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine
You’ll solve you'll find that this is best for everyone involved
All in all, the Lord my witness

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trouble]
Permit, don’t need permission from a doctor
I been smokin’ since a pre-teen toddler
I been servin’ since a jit tryna dodge all the obstacles
My teachers all told me that were probable
Probable cause, no cracka never really had it
I was just a nigga in a high price whip
Yea, I’m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto
Well you better have extension on the clip
Well beef comes around in the town more often than these bitches emotions
I got a yapper, five dollars, off the streets (Yeah I'm totin')
For protection more than anything though.. (You gon' test my devotion)
My first amendment right, they violate it anytime we outspoken
Chicago violence boostin’ up but we just focussin’ on other environments
Cause the country is taking notice
More fiends are risin', Molly the new dope and I
Apologize cause it was something I was promotin’
Chopper in my bitch name in case I light somebody up
You just tell them it was stolen
Rich gunplay, shit that’s all they see that’s all they know
Without it kinda hopeless
Said this is in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said out their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me Trouble you gotta put the mack down
Felonies all in your background
Said this is in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said out their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me Trouble you gotta put the mack down
Felonies all in your background

[Verse 4: Trae tha Truth]
I used to run up in your crib with shit that go ‘blaka
Nigga tryna brick my squad like I’m Waka
I don’t want a single chain I can’t rocka
Heard em' tell me life is a bitch, can’t stop her
Even if I could, I tell ‘em I wouldn’t knock her
Til I get that section 8 and then swap her
Baby mama tax return, new dropper
I might wanna go silk that bitch like I’m Shocker
All of my whips wetter than a water house
Food stamps getting flipped, what that water cost?
Yea I’m actin like a nigga that ain’t never had shit
Filet Mignon, porterhouse
My little brother on his medical shit from that block street
Nigga health care insured by that guap
Doorways ain't hiding me, no stop
Jackers playin’ overseas with they yacht
Shit I probably be the same I find drama
Law’s out lookin’ for me like Osama
I don’t wanna do no bid, yo honor
Still waitin’ on my one phone call from Obama
Tell ‘em I need the chopper, they tellin’ me I'm a felon
I'm tellin' 'em they got it wrong, I beat the case in '97
And I'm well acquainted with Hell but I’m tryna make it to Heaven
But they don’t want me to make it, that’s why the niggas be tellin’ me
If I don’t get the chopper I’mma probably run up inside them
They better gimme a answer, I’m tryna be cool
If I don’t get it then everybody gon’ fear it
Every week I’m finna make ‘em repeat it like they in school
Bed blues, everybody open up somethin’
You can move all you want just not sudden
It ain’t no thinkin’ I was playin’ I am not frontin'
The mentality of a goon, I am not stuntin'

[Hook]

[Verse 5:  Fam-Lay]
Storm is gone now it’s all clear
The road was long but we all here
Now go and tell, I don’t care
2014 is our year
Big shout out to the whole streets
This goes out to all that knows me
All y’all pussy niggas, holies
Y’all play tough guys but call the police
Look I don’t care, I don’t share
I keep me a bad bitch with long hair
I send them choppers around there
When I’m somewhere sittin’ in a lounge chair
Overseas, blowin’ tree, blowin’ green, throwin’ B's
Livin’ like life is supposed to be
And if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me
To the top, couldn’t stop, had a major deal but it wouldn’t pop
Nigas hated on me but I wouldn’t stop
And now life sweeter than a puddin’ pop
Think so slick, come and get me dog
None of y’all niggas fuckin’ with me dog
Some of y’all niggas comin’ with me dog
None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dog
You think an echo was y’all
You need to think tactical dog
We laughin’ at y’all
While you thinking me and Lu radical, naw
Seein’ this shit that keep goin’ on
Then pick a different zone for your mobile homes
Store fingerprints on your mobile phone
When you sippin’ that shit we keep blowin’ on

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
I’m bout that, I’m bout that
That Bentley out in that driveway
Cost more than my house did
Fuck land, I’m fly today
First class if I fly
Credit card ain’t mine
Don’t know how I’m gettin’ back
But in luxury I arrive (TURN UP)
IPhone in my baby name
Long way from that chirp
Strip pole in my bedroom
But I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
Miley Cyrus on that bullshit
But a real nigga can’t judge
That for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college
Missed out but no pyrex
My Harley got low milage
This white carpet in my project
30 guns in my section, none of the homies got aim
My side bitch said she pregnant
But I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
And this one is mine, I don’t trust his mama
So he don’t got my name
Cheap rims on  my ride
Mirrors loose as my beat pound
I ain’t addicted to shit
My weed man on my speed dial

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lupe Fiasco]
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
AR-15 with collapsible stock
Picatinny rail with a three-point harness
With 150 round magazine and a dot
Ay, FMJ’s by the box, nigga
Got the same setup as the SWATs, nigga
Shouldn’t find that surprising
Cause I bought the muthafucka from a cop
Ay, seen a lot of brown money as a shorty
Welfare baby can’t afford me
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Excuse me, as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete myself
My opposition is not pretending
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself
Fuck being a hip hop purist
When I'm  spendin’ 50 thousand on Securus
Embrace the contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It’s why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen can’t fill us, Medicare can’t heal us
And the mamas can’t stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride
With an L up sayin’ "free da guys" like I’m Durk
With a clean record but I’m cursed
To make a half a million off a verse
Nigga, chop

Hit me on my beeper

You want it I got it you need it
Own it you got it come see it
Hate that they got to compete with
Prices I doubt that they beat it
Narcotics you got to come get it
Straight money got to come with it
Telling you not that my shit is
Bigger than knuckles on midgets
I carry that forty, nigga, I carry that cake cous'
With smokers on me, killer, I get that paper
I got exotic, homie
I pump that purple, homie
(Walking down the block with life in my pocket)
That's how I got it, homie
I ducked them turtles, homie
Catch me on the night shift like the Commodores
You was 'bout that bullshit, what you call me for
Watching my cash stack, I got the metal handle
I keep a knapsack, full of the devil's candy
Long as I keep it it's selling
Act like you keep it you welling
Sick of that bullshit you yelling
Hurt cause your people keep telling
Know that you broke cause it's showing
'Sposed to have coke and you blowing
Before I know niggas you owing

Talking 'bout kicking your door in

[Verse 2: Fam-Lay]
For one you get two of them on Tuesdays
Or that then your workers is useless
Think that I'm just doing music
It's just to keep deputies clueless
Niggas is wopping and popping
China white moving, no stopping
Put a nice groove in my pocket
Nobody's rude as my Glock is
Walk in the club and they on us
Not that they love us, they want us
One of them want to just know us
The other one want to just bone us
But i don't fuck anything, it's got to be something that's banging
[?] I'm on my way to be slanging
One time if the shit don't be there
Cause them niggas come quick like an e-mail
They coming up the block, two ladies buck naked
They picking out a spot, to let the mutt chase it
Guaranteed the police in their holler
Chevy Caprice and them Dodges
Niggas is creeping and dodging
Cause niggas ain't beating them charges
Don't let them stop you, you dirty
Dirty, don't stop it, keep swerving
(Walking down the block with life in my pocket)
Put the shit out on the curb or
You won't get out 'til you thirty

See I'm from Norfolk here's a coffin if ya slee-py
Turn ya children into orphans tryna sneak me
Or tryna creep me, the realest shit I ever spoke
So I'ma spit it when I finish, I'mma slit my throat
This shit is like 211 mixed wit coke
Leave you spinning like the tennis balls in ya spoke, nigga
Dark secrets, man I won't lie
They came to the light a man is gon' die
All hope is lost and FamLay's gon' fry
Cause I did shit the average man just won't try
Like what? War against an army wit a hand gun
I'm FamLay, and when my fucking chance come
I'm running wit it, on e'ry song I'm coming wit' it
See some you think you can take from me, then come and get it
See I'm from Huntersville, e'ry thang we done is real
My niggas come in here, my niggas come to kill
And I dare y'all to try to dis us
See you in the streets it ain't nothing discuss
Maaan, we gon' stomp yo ass dead in the ground
FEW WEEKS, couple bodies wit no head'll be found, nigga
Cut off ya wrists, and they feet no prints (Gangsta)
Now I'm in the Six, (Gangsta) wit the heat no tints, you see me boy

Fam-Lay, c'mon
A nigga like me, I'm fresh n drivin ma
A nigga like me, I'm fresh n drivin ma
Why be frustrated, stressed, and jiving for?
A nigga like me, I'm fresh n drivin ma

[Hook - Pharrell Williams] (Fam-Lay)
Fresh! OWW! and driving!
Whoa whoa! (happy as a bitch, nevermind how y'all feel)
Give you fresh!! and driving! Whoa whoa!
(Blowing sweet Indonesia out my nostrils)

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Now my plane just landed, I'm down in Miami
Listen up close cause ya gotta understand me
I'm seeing womens' faces sweeter than candy
Me and Pharrell talking bout a clean sweep at the Grammy's (uh huh)
That was cool, but this year much sweeter
Then I bumped into the world's baddest bitch named Trina (whoa!)
Let me know cuz you ever seen her
Fatter ass on a woman, cause I gotta meet her (word?!)
Then I saw my home girl Misdemeanor
Flying by in a drop top Ferrari Modena
Right now I'm in a rented Beemer
When I get my Modena I'm a keep mines cleaner
I'm Mamosa toasting, playing wit these women's emotions
Coast to coasting, paying for these women to bullshish
Smoking hocus pocus, toast in holsters
Try to play us close, and I'm spraying the toast cause I'm so

[Hook]

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
I stay fresh while the rest stay frustrated
I'm the best I guess that's why the rest hate it
Looking at those breasts thinking x-rated
Last call in the spot, and I just made it, cool
Everythings by according to plan
A lil less than a god but I'm more than a man (uh huh)
Can you help me? sure that you can
Cause I came down here for a lil more than a tan
Doing - a buck 50, like six quarters
Cause Fam-Lay is fresh as dish water
You can't shift them gears in disorder
Easy on the tiptronic baby! I just bought her
Hop out the S Type, dressed like a criminal
Pinkie to the thumb numb, neckalace invisible
Y'all niggas pitiful, leave y'all critical
Rims so sick that my car need a physical

[Hook]

[Bridge - Fam-Lay] (2x)
Ma, you going my way? what up! what up!
Fellas, you getting right today, what up! what up!
Trying to get in some today, just cut up
Haters get in my way and get gun butt up

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Ain't no nigga live as me!
Sunshining bright wit a dime in the driver seat
I'm what them assholes try to be
Yeah! Me and babygirl took a stroll on the beach for some privacy
Long as you kiss and don't tell
I paid for ya hair, ya feet and yo nails
Just cause I'm fresh and don't care
Right after that we hitting the hotel, I'm

[Hook - to fade][Verse 1: Fam-Lay]
Hmmm...yes sirrrrrr
Rock and roll, man roll and rock
I got tens, got twentys, got fifty blocks
I got smoke to buy, coke for sale
Sold much coke, got coke in jail
In the white Rolls Royce with my man Pharrell
This lil' nigga got beats too fresh to be stale
But I'mma take you back to the early eighties
When my cousin Stacey had the pearl Mercedes
My aunt cousin Wack had the black on black
Ac' coupe Legend with the gold in the back
I was just a lil' young'n runnin' wild as hell
Runnin' round wild trynta get that mail
Lil' shorty dudes trynta learn the grooves
I was twelve years old brought it to the school
Cause I was quick to flip, quick to sell that shit
You ain't from the hood, y'all don't know bout this

[Hook]
But if you feel me, throw your bows up (Star Track)
Try to set up shop get glowed up
Hey, I'm the candyman, I got mo' than frozen cups
I got your chop top sour diesel roll-ups
Fam! we can roll up (Star Track)
But Fam! don't try to roll up (Star Track)
Don't make me pull these motherfuckin' fo's up
Cause it's like that

[Verse 2: Fam-Lay]
The fiends is dyin', things is lyin'
Missin' on the streets, so the fiends is still buyin'
Right on time and money on the mind and
On them twenty-fo's, them bit-ches straight shinin'
But y'all niggas don't know bout this
Fresh new kicks with the new outfit
Got the all black top with the black on black
You ever see me creepin, just back on back
Cause I got that pump and it is gon' spit
I ain't no punk and I ain't no snitch
From a place on Earth called Huntersville
Where people out there got love for real
Got love for all who got love for me
If a coward ever ran then it wasn't me
I'll be on the curb movin' dubs and d's
And if you ever bought a dub then it was for me
I ever get caught then it was to be
I'mma just make bail by my cousin E
Back on the Porsche with the mobile phone
Like eleven in the mornin' them hoes to go home
Trynta score and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the hood, y'all don't know bout this

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Aww shit, this is the part when the fight just start
When the fists get to swingin' and the four-fifths spark
And then the bitches get to runnin' and the bitch just scream
And we spin off in Rolls and it's so damn clean

[Verse 3: Fam-Lay]
I stand on my block, the cam on the spot
My hands in my pocket, both hammers is cocked
Waitin' for a nigga to just act up
My right hand big six, got my bait back up
Niggas lookin' all jealous, lookin' mad as hell
Actin' like lil' girls, like tattle-tales
Mad cause my right hand bad as hell
I would've kept shootin', but I had a sale
See, I'm a crime boss three sixty-five
Lookin' for a Nina Ross, she just can ride
Picked up my cash and slide all sweet
Nigga tried to snatch ass, knocked his heart off beat
Nigga talk trash like the shit all sweet
Won't'cha all take the cash dogg, not off me
Hustlin's in my veins - you cannot stop it
Walkin' on the block with life in my pocket
I'm trynta score and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the ghetto, y'all don't know bout this[Verse 1: Fam-Lay]
Hmmm...yes sirrrrrr
Rock and roll, man roll and rock
I got tens, got twentys, got fifty blocks
I got smoke to buy, coke for sale
Sold much coke, got coke in jail
In the white Rolls Royce with my man Pharrell
This lil' nigga got beats too fresh to be stale
But I'mma take you back to the early eighties
When my cousin Stacey had the pearl Mercedes
My aunt cousin Wack had the black on black
Ac' coupe Legend with the gold in the back
I was just a lil' young'n runnin' wild as hell
Runnin' round wild trynta get that mail
Lil' shorty dudes trynta learn the grooves
I was twelve years old brought it to the school
Cause I was quick to flip, quick to sell that shit
You ain't from the hood, y'all don't know bout this

[Hook 1]
But if you feel me, throw your bows up (Star Track)
Try to set up shop get glowed up
Hey, I'm the candyman, I got mo' than frozen cups
I got your chop top sour diesel roll-ups
Fam! we can roll up (Star Track)
But Fam! don't try to roll up (Star Track)
Don't make me pull these motherfuckin' fo's up
Cause it's like that

[Verse 2: Fam-Lay]
The fiends is dyin', things is lyin'
Missin' on the streets, so the fiends is still buyin'
Right on time and money on the mind and
On them twenty-fo's, them bit-ches straight shinin'
But y'all niggas don't know bout this
Fresh new kicks with the new outfit
Got the all black top with the black on black
You ever see me creepin, just back on back
Cause I got that pump and it is gon' spit
I ain't no punk and I ain't no snitch
From a place on Earth called Huntersville
Where people out there got love for real
Got love for all who got love for me
If a coward ever ran then it wasn't me
I'll be on the curb movin' dubs and d's
And if you ever bought a dub then it was for me
I ever get caught then it was to be
I'mma just make bail by my cousin E
Back on the Porsche with the mobile phone
Like eleven in the mornin' them hoes to go home
Trynta score and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the hood, y'all don't know bout this

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]
Aww shit, this is the part when the fight just start
When the fists get to swingin' and the four-fifths spark
And then the bitches get to runnin' and the bitch just scream
And we spin off in Rolls and it's so damn clean

[Verse 3: Fam-Lay]
I stand on my block, the cam on the spot
My hands in my pocket, both hammers is cocked
Waitin' for a nigga to just act up
My right hand big six, got my bait back up
Niggas lookin' all jealous, lookin' mad as hell
Actin' like lil' girls, like tattle-tales
Mad cause my right hand bad as hell
I would've kept shootin', but I had a sale
See, I'm a crime boss three sixty-five
Lookin' for a Nina Ross, she just can ride
Picked up my cash and slide all sweet
Nigga tried to snatch ass, knocked his heart off beat
Nigga talk trash like the shit all sweet
Won't'cha all take the cash dogg, not off me
Hustlin's in my veins - you cannot stop it
Walkin' on the block with life in my pocket
I'm trynta score and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the ghetto, y'all don't know bout this

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2][Pharrell Williams]
Hmmm yess sirrrrr..

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Rock and roll and roll and rock
I got 10's, got 20's, got fifty blocks
I got smoke in back, coke for sale
So much coke got coke in jail
In the white Rolls Royce wit my man Pharrell
This lil' nigga got beats too fresh to be stale
But I'm a take it back to the early 80's
Where my couzin Stacey had the pearl Mecerdes
My aunt-couzin Wamp had the black on black
Ac' Coupe Legend wit the gold in the back
I was just a lil' youngin running wild as hell
Running 'round wild trying to get that mail
Lil' shorty whose trying to learn the rules
I was twelve years old brought the tool to school
Cause I was quick to flip, quick to sell that shit
You ain't from the hood y'all don't know bout this

[Hook - Fam-Lay & (Pharrell)]
But if you feel me, throw your bows up (Star Trak)
Try to set up shop get clothed up (Star Trak)
Hey I'm the Candy Man I got more than frozen cups
I got ya chopped, tossed, sour, diesel roll ups
(Fam!) We could roll up (Star Trak)
(Fam!) Don't try to roll up (Star Trak)
Don't make me pull these motherfucking fo's up
Cause it's like that!

[Verse - Lil' Flip]
Uh! Well here's a little story I'd like to tell
About a H-Town Pimp and I ain't got his mail
It started way back in 1999
When I got my first dime and I started to grind
Now we can Rock N' Roll, I got a roll of rocks
And when you hear {*sirens*} there go the cops
When the block get hot, homie we gon chill
And bid like 22 mill, we could plan a deal
My light too real for me to act like you
I'm playing wit too much paper to put slacks like you
You could call me Betty Crocker cause I'm baking them cakes
And when I cross the interstate, I'm switching up plates
I'm watching the Feds, they're watching my moves
I'm paying my dues, I'm spraying my tools
We never play by the rules
You might hate to lose if you play wit us
You ain't heard? Me and my homies keep them K's wit us
You'll stop - drop, roll, we'll shoot ya in the head
And when I'm chasing my bread, I'm shaking the Feds
And I'm - packing my lead, y'all ain't ready for me
The only time you saw a Bird was on Sesame Street
I got street birds, and I keep 'em in my pouch
Play wit my money and I turn into Oscar the Grouch!

[Hook]

[Bridge - Kelis]
Aww shit, this is part when the fight just start
When the fists get to swinging and the .45th spark
And then the bitches get to running and the bitch just scream and
We speed off in the Rolls and it's so damn clean

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
I stand on my block, the gamblest spot
My hands in my pocket both hammers is cocked
Waiting for a nigga to just act up
My right hand big six got my big back up
Lookers lookin all jealous lookin mad as hell
Acting like little girls like tattle tales
Mad cause my right hand bad as hell
I woulda kept shooting but I had to sell
See I'm a Crime Boss 365
Lookin for a nina raw, she just to ride
Picked up my cash and slide off sweet
Nigga tried to snatch ass knocked his heart off beat
Nigga talked trash like the shit all sweet
Won't ya all take the cash dog, not off me
Hustlers in my veins, you cannot stop it
Walking on the block wit life in my pocket
I'm tryin' to sco' and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the ghetto y'all don't know bout this

[Hook]

[Bridge][Intro - Lil Jon]

[Verse - Fam-Lay] (Lil Jon)
Fam-Lay don't give a flying fuck
When I see him, time is up
Next time his family see him, his eyes are shut
Uh! Fuck a heads up, whachu scared for?
You'll be a dead duck riding in that flat bed truck
Uh! Let em go? (NO WAY!!) Lil Jon let em know (OOOKAAYYY!!)
Soon as you say it I'm a said it
He getting scared when I spray it in this dead end
He gon be dead in a second, uh
Let em run cause my legs in the Jetta so
Run nigga run, you'll only die tired
Them dum dums come, you're done and I'm not lying
Tec nines rain like a shower head
Then put your whole crew remains on the flower bed
Distribute pain, gun power spray
Uh! Leave your blocks in flames then we outta there

[Hook]

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Stand and clock, while I supply planted rock
My hand is hot, but hotter when them cannons pop
The gamblest spot, I breaks em, grab dice and shake em
Let em go, 4 - 5 - 6, dead em go
S-T-A-R Trak, dot com (Star Trak)
Got guns, got bombs, that make ya act calm
Leave ya whole neighborhood like 'Nam
Bring the thunder and the rain when I strike like light-ning
Got a Puerto Rican chick wit a white mom
Chick trifling, chick like cum
And I'm often asked, I'm out for cash
Motherfuckers kill, we playing hard
While y'all soft as ass
Chew you up, screw you up, do you up
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK nigga! who the fuck?!
Want beef wit the F-A-M, L-A-Y?
I keep shit burning like the LA riots, tell his guy

[Lil Jon] I told y'all niggas to step the fuck back!
Niggas ain't listening in this motherfucker!
So we gon show y'all how niggas set this shit off for real!

[Fam-Lay]
Fam-Lay'll leave you wit a holy temple
Now you rest in peace in a Holy Temple
Nigga didn't know what he was in for
All my bullets hit everyone they was meant for
Man it's time to notify all his kin folk
Mailing out letters that you had to write in pencil
My condolences, East Side on the side of me
And I'm a ride till them niggas get tired of me

[Hook]

STEP THE FUCK BACK!![Pharrell in background]

[Pharrell]
Yo, hah huh, yo tell em

[Verse - Pusha T]
Kard' in me, I flow too angry for some
Introduce myself I waving a gun
Cocked the banger, filled the barrell, pop minus one
Pop again, lay his men flee now it's down
Known for popping four and putting cock in whore
Love expensive homes of stones with pocket doors
I fuck white whives, that drive white fives
Go to court, testify for me and tell white lies
When I pull up, the people say "HOT them boys!"
22 but childish how we cop them toys
Sorry contradict myself, kinda hard to stop it
Glock and my ski nose, piece out of the pocket

[Verse - Boobonic]
Hey yo it's Boobonic, tightest nigga around here
I'm next level, motherfuckers is downstairs
Niggas call me a square, when I clock
Cause I'm eating from four corners in one block, get it?
Bottom line I'm the shit at all times
Come through in the five, grippin all dimes
Let's weigh mine to yours
I went to Vegas in '94, mind you I'm only 20
Ain't wit a whole lotta shit, just money
I'm so paid, that's why you niggas so funny
X ya name, cause I'm next in the game to shine
Y'all faggot rappers can't fuck wit mine

[Chorus - Rosco P. Coldchain] (2x)
Y'all niggas walk wit no belief
Y'all niggas talk wit no relief
When you see me wit that .44 know it's me
Give up that cash, or that pack, or that cocoa leaf

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Fam-Lay ain't scared y'all
Look, I swear I ain't scared
Six shots at his mink cap, watch our shit
Look the nigga bout to die and he don't even know it
I fucked wit a lotta chicks that I don't even go at
Have a suit from the coppers, the dope won't even throw it
And y'all never knew I'm mad cause I won't even show it
Calm demeanor, flips when I palm the nina
I'm gifted, get shit straight from Argentina
Three vicious pimps but they moms is meaner
Got big tit chicks, Lord y'all should see 'em
The boss is heavy, let off cross and steady
Or even straight through the middle like Dorsey Levy

[Verse - Mr. Man]
In the ML 430, block crack and twist em
Bruce'll fall back bitch see the solar system
Hoes - never kiss em, fuck get a dick sucked
You better than what? More hoes than who?
Can't na nigga ball like Mr. Man and Boo
Gucci from the suit, shirt belt to the suit
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?
When my block getting money, everything is fine
Cop two bricks, stole ride roun' nine
Now I'm the shit, the clique is cool
And we boost six hours shift, fuck school
Fuck ice, I got heat that'll blow your cool

[Chorus]

[Verse - Rosco P. Coldchain]
Playas think they can stand infront of me? Wit that ice on
Like as if Rosco wouldn't make their brains all crispy
I'm far from patient, it take something minor to push me
I thought my name was self explanatory, y'all niggas be asking for it
Rosco's slang term for gun, P's for Porter
Coldchain nigga I'll take yours and sport it
And if you pussies got something to say about that
You can chit chat wit me and my gat, that day about that
On the spot, that moment, that second about that
I'll pull the Heckling, cock, and commense to pop
Heat from the stove, oven stuffing baking your top
And while you're on the pavement bleeding to death
I'll proceed to inspect - your pockets
Fingers, wrists, and your neck
I want the platinum rings, watches, including baguettes

[Verse - Malice]
When I come it's wit 10 friends and a cross beam
Red dot pulsating on his offspring
Far from fiction what I kick in these flows
I'm the proud pop of them twin fo fo's
Mac and nine milly, ice quite chilly
I chase that paper, being broke? that's silly
What's worse than a group a niggas wit no say?
We skip to the front of the line and don't pay
His stash at the foot of the bed, you don't say
Fill his Dolce wit more holes than crochet
No deal go down wit out a gun involved
Cause I'm raw like a Harley wit monkey bars

[Chorus - to fade][Pharrell] OWW!! Getting!!

[Hook - Fam-Lay]
When the car roll up and windows roll down
And you see the sawed off, nigga better hit the ground
We getting busy!! You better haul ass dawg!
You better haul ass! You better haul ass dawg!
You better haul ass! (OWW!! getting!!.. OWW!!)

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
I'm blasting, nigga laying in the street cause
Talked shit, so I hit 'em wit the heat
Runts moving, keys like oz's
Like a cliental, errbody know me
Running! running from the 5-0
Drug life, and it's all about survival
Hustla, known worldwide dawg
I'm in the game and I'm bout to drive by y'all
Gambler, 4 - 5 - 6ing it
10 grand in the bank and I'm sticking it
Bitches, got 'em by the dozens
From their mammy, to their sisters to their couzins
Star Trak, is the crew that I run with
Nigga don't get murdered over dumb shit
Fuck you! it's how I'm caring if
Nigga try to start beef and we burn it

[Hook]

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Hey look I'm sick of niggas saying what they gon do when they see me
Soon as they see they don't do shit
The nigga Fam-Lay too slick
I got a handful of guns and a few clips stupid
You keep sending death threats, uh! and I ain't seen death yet
Nigga I can't help that I ain't been murdered in my life, look
Look I been stopped giving a fuck about living
Ever since I got beat up by them faggot ass cops
But now I just stand on my block and drink liquor
Wit my niggas and my bitches and we keep them gats cocked
Uh! won't hesistate to blast you niggas
Spray your corner, bodies falls in the Ac my nigga
Uh! I'm pulling out the dagger nigga
Cause when I finish wit these shells I'm a stab a nigga

[Hook]

[Bridge - Pharrell Williams] (Fam-Lay)
Let me tell ya boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (Fam-Lay!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (Norfolk!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (Huntersville!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin but let me tell ya
Boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (with the Clipse!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (Coldchain!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin (Star Trak!)
I'm boss ballin, I'm boss ballin

[Verse - Fam-Lay]
Nigga fuck all that punchline shit, that young rhyme shit
That shit that might blow only one time shit
Cause when I rhyme bitch, my rhymes fit
The mind of a gangsta is all time, bitch!
Kill who you riding wit
I got some niggas from Virginia riding wit me
And them niggas trying to buy this shit
So fuck who you party wit!
Cause we get high as the Karate Kid, now let's go!
Pop junk, I pop trunks; Got a 10 shot Glock pump
That'll stop trucks, ya cocksucker!
Shoot a lead trying to get a rep
I shoot the lead at his head now his man tryin to get 'em help
Fam don't play wit chirin [children]
Act stupid, act dumb, act foolish, act deaf like you ain't hear em
Bring it to the forefront, I got a lotta niggas that tote guns
Now let's do it!

[Hook] (w/ bridge in background)[Pharrell Williams]
Hmmm yess sirrrrr..

[Verse: Fam-Lay]
I rock and roll and roll and rock
I got 10's, got 20's, got fifty blocks
I got smoke in back, coke for sale
So much coke got coke in jail
In the white Rolls Royce wit my man Pharrell
This lil' nigga got beats too fresh to be stale
But I'm a take it back to the early 80's
Where my couzin Stacey had the pearl Mecerdes
My aunt-couzin Wamp had the black on black
Ac' Coupe Legend wit the gold in the back
I was just a lil' youngin running wild as hell
Running 'round wild trying to get that mail
Lil' shorty whose trying to learn the rules
I was twelve years old brought the tool to school
Cause I was quick to flip, quick to sell that shit
You ain't from the hood y'all don't know bout this

[Chorus: Fam-Lay + (Pharrell)]
But if you feel me, throw your bows up (Star Trak)
Try to set up shop get glo'd up (Star Trak)
Hey I'm the cannon man I got more than frozen cups
I got ya chopped, tossed, sour, diesel roll ups
(Fam!) We could roll up (Star Trak)
(Fam!) Don't try to roll up (Star Trak)
Don't make me pull these motherfucking fo's up
Cause it's like that!

[Verse: Fam-Lay]
The fiends is dying, fiends is lying
Missle on the streets of the fiends is still buying
Right on time and - money on the mind and
On them 24's them bitches stay shining
But y'all niggas don't know bout this
Fresh new kicks wit the new outfit
Got the all black top wit the black on black
You ever seen me creeping just back on back
Cause I got that pump and it is gon' spit
I ain't no punk and I ain't no snitch
From a place on Earth called Huntersville
Where people out there got love for real
Got love for all who got love for me
If a coward ever ran then it wasn't me
I'll be on the curb moving dubs and D's
So if you ever bought a dub then it was from me
I ever get caught then it was the B
I'm a just make bail by my couzin E
Back on the porch wit the mobile phone
Like eleven in the morning them hoes don't go home
Tried to sco' and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the hood y'all don't know bout this

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Kelis]
Aww shit, this is part when the fight just start
When the fists get to swinging and the 4-5th spark
And then the bitches get to running and the bitch just scream and
We speed off in the Rolls and it's so damn clean

[Verse: Fam-Lay]
I stand on my block, the gamblest spot
My hands in my pocket both hammers is cocked
Waiting for a nigga to just act up
My right hand big six got my big back up
Lookers lookin all jealous lookin mad as hell
Acting like little girls like tattle tales
Mad cause my right hand bad as hell
I woulda kept shooting but I had to sell
See I'm a Crown Boss 365
Lookin for a nina raw sheet just to ride
Picked up my cash and slide off sweet
Nigga tried to snatch ass knocked his heart of beat
Nigga talked trash like the shit all sweet
Won't ya all take the cash dog, not off me
Hustlers in my veins, you cannot stop it
Walking on the block wit life in my pocket
I'm tryin' to sco' and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the ghetto y'all don't know bout this

[Chorus]

[Bridge][Hook]
I got your bitch skrung owt, she keep callin'
She see that four wheel, she see that on me
Fresh Caesar, no fitted
I'm all about my digits she's so on my di-dick
Fam-Lay keep it poppin' in the streets
Yellow juice take a sip have a seat
And I'ma bang her, 'til her tongue out
I got you singin', now say it with me
Got your bitch skrung owt
I got your bitch skrung owt
I got your bitch skrung owt
I got your bitch skrung owt
You better get her mane

[Verse 1]
Oh shit, they done did it mane
Fam-Lay came through in that kitty thing
And your girl tryna get it mane
If you in love with ya girl better get her mane
I'm a pimp nigga peep how I play
Ain't got a limp nigga I ain't gotta say it
But I'm the coolest you can put your soul on it
New jewels old money with the mould on it
Hang in the beach house ass cheeks out
You know what I be about 'bout to freak out
Uh, and I'ma put it on her like I own her
The sad part about it I don't even wanna

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It ain't much y'all can do with me, got the crew with me
New sneaks and my shorts cost two fifty
Ain't such thing as too picky
Got an eigth of that dro and an ounce of that blue with me
Try to tell me that she ain't kinky
Got my new wrist watch with a mean pinky
And my pocket full of green Twinkies
She either lying or she blind as Ray Charles claims she ain't seen me
She said she doesn't lay with just any nigga
But she wanna lay with this Virginia nigga
Got your bitch gone while you sit home
When she in the shower you tryna switch phones

[Hook]
