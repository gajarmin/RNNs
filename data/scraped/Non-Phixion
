[ILL Bill]
Had the time of his life, a capitalist with a communist wife
Started to fight and did to cats what God did to Christ
Hardly the type to give garbage advice, he was larger than life
He'd penetrate the roof of your car with a spike
Trained by an insane ex-marine
CIA trained a renegade assassin android
Passport pilot to black helicopter choppers over Bosnia
Sniffed so much coke nose was fucked up and bled a lot
For all y'all bystanders baggy ass jeans to hide ya banga wranglers
Thugged the fuck out hang with bash-in-ya-face-gat-gangsta governments
These other kids is like the drunken bitch
That sucked a hundred dicks at your party and cried rape
Plus the hooker lies great, sniff another line to get ya mind straight
Pull out the nine and start shooting people
Money ain't the root of evil it be much more than that
America taught me how to kidnap and torture cats

Ill bill: Hook
Exit the stargate, initial perception quickens my heart rate
This dark place planet Earth orbits one star
Come from afar far away state of mind
Open up your 3rd eye Black Helicopters in the sky

[Goretex]
I need G's so I can jet easier, my crib's tapped
I suspect Ether, that's why I'm out of touch with the media
Undercovers like Pete Seiger, I couldn't tell neither
Watchin' the projects with a van of speakers
Peepin' how my kids rest, bangin' my wiz for hours
Surveillance tapes pissin' in King's Plaza even got us after hours
Drug parties, golden showers on the poor shiksa
Work for the FBI so anytime I might whisper
My scary team be like barely clean, rockin' Israeli jeans
That's why I mostly heard and rarely seen
Realization soaked in urgency
Can't escape history's pen I be the worst of me

Ill bill: Hook

[Sabac Red]
This cop bring the city hoppa like a rocka with binoculars
Took me and these 2 Rastas and a mobster cat for hostage
Said that we were imposters and impetuous government agent
From another nation and said we had the proper information
About the aliens, vegetarians, devils, and Aryans
These are civilized Barbarians, we'll fuckin' bury them
The rasta said you pussy blood clot got you shot
I'm like fuck this I'm blowin' up spots cause shit is hot
We know about the plan from the projects and contraband
Drop bombs on Brazil so you can kill and conquer land
Your drug trafficking, your new creation for disease
To control the population and in the states and overseas
Put poison in the weed and the milk we feed our seeds
You looked shocked that Sabac could know the plots to all of these
Took his Glock licked a shot when the bastard wasn't lookin'
Threw him out then the mobster flew the chopper back to Brooklyn

[Ill bill: Hook][Ill Bill]
Non-Phixion be the real hip hop
We make you wanna kill cops
Cats hate me, cause they know I fingered their girls' twat
They feel helpless, real jealous, we killed Elvis
I shot Reagan with the help of the secret service
Super double agent, shoot your mother with my brother's favorite
12 gauge waving, aiming at your brain, strange universe, I'm too famous
Leaving the murder scene blameless, drug entertainment
Thugs that'll blaze with laser guns
Saying what I wrote, they feel what I feel
They see the same picture
We make the biscuit do the talking and became richer
Nobody gets a record deal, you gotta take that shit
Treat the record label like a slut, and rape that bitch
I keep it simple for these stupid cats
Claiming you knew the facts, but in reality, you were trapped
Jesus Christ was a gangsta rapper
They killed him then he came back and made a platinum album
The path I travel's like the dragon shadow
Invisible to CIA camera angles
They got a file on every rap group
They killed the last man who had proof
They're after me for information that I have too

[Hook x2]
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I might have to blast you
The CIA's trying to kill me, we bad news
Get the fuck up out my way when I pass through

[Sabac Red]
Symbolism, socialism, live life lead, learn
Struggle war whole drug fiends, the white house burn
Sex, pain, fear, freedom love, young guns be shootin'
Genocide, revolution, lost souls prostituting
Military confrontation, safe sex, and masturbation
Peace to all the homeless people livin in the train station
Project wars, building one vs four
Lock the door, burn the disc now everybody hit the motherfuckin floor
They bust and I'm a glutton for this shit
I'm number six on they list next to Kiss and Marley's kids
Cause I run wit Asians, Latinos and Black fists
5 percenters, Caucasians, thugs who live communist
They broke in my house, planted bugs in all my lamps and my couch
They after me (what) let me find out
I'm not havin it, My rap attract the service like a magnet
The bastards get nothing like private parties with no laminates
If I'ma die, I'ma die bustin and strugglin
I'm hustling for the people, fuck them devils and corruptions
Nuttin' for nuttin', ain't it something how they do?
They ID me due to my tattoo

[Hook x2]

[Goretex]
Projects for straight jackets, electroshock states
A rock could fall out, traded for royalty rates
Get ya drink on, we building bombs, spit in ya face
Smart to change cars like cruise the block I do it for chase
Nice spite work, the fancy knife work
Hit to Chirst Non-Phixion striking prison Ice shirts
I paid dues, nothing to loose, Steady bustin off weapons In 2's
When I come home I be smellin shit and furniture's moved
Eat a slug, take some weight off, I live this for real
I do this for the dead, rest in peace I'm holdin you near
Makin up time, 12 years we on tour we blow your back off
Support cats that jack the car seats and tear ya scalp off
Soldiers of merits, inherited from way back
Cyanide dipped bullets, so I should follow my stats
We too futuristic, thugs to robots, experiments
Four point restraint and my hyper cube on medicines
Pain veterans, crippling souls
It's gettin bigger now the information runnin the globe
It's just my mechanics, either with a gat or zanax
Why spread panic until the sabbath?

[Hook x2]Yo.. three-hundred and sixty-five days a year
We preoccupy self to find life's true meaning
We indulge irrelevant contradiction
Contradiction which steps up growth
Live life each day like it could be your last

[Verse 1: Sabac Red]
Yo.. I'm from a place where some mothers sell they babies for crack
Where young cats buy gats, shoot and never look back
Where the whites sit with the whites, and the blacks sit with the blacks
But somehow we unite, through the culture of rap
I'm from Brooklyn, word to the Dodgers, Russian massages
Where thugs bust guns, and sons are raised without they fathers
We do away with has-beens, rock the latest fashion
The rule's never rat - what you want to know, or who's askin
Just some habits of highly effective MC's
Y'all is pussy rap, my speech made you weak in the knees
But talk's cheap, I'm straight from the streets
I'm action-oriented when I'm screamin KILL CORRUPT POLICE
I read books, reap intelligence to compromise my bad looks
I roam with godbodies and crooks
But when I rest my head at night, I'm just happy that I made it
Cause someone could take your life, be it my friends or my neighbors
Whether, you police or a thug on the streets
Whether, you look for beef or you livin in peace
Whether, you back down or you stand strong bold
Yo we never know what tomorrow gon' hold

[Hook: *sung*]
We can live today, but we're not promised tomorrow
We can pass away, say goodbye to yesterday
We can live today, but we're not promised tomorrow
We can pass away, say goodbye to yesterday

[Verse 2: Goretex]
It's either me or you in this world cause I be tryin to cope
I'm lookin for answers, but still I'm comin up broke
They supply the fed tops, smack, the guns and the coke
Who shot Lennon and Malcolm X, one in his throat
I'm an old soul that hold but probably young as the Pope
Reincarnated as a prophet through a symbol of hope
I move through the projects, lights, rhythm and smoke
Idiom quotes, somebody said religion's a joke
Buried my man at 18, the cancer took him in months
He died before he lived, but once gone I felt touched
My old earth followed in '91, 6 months apart
Project stress, blackouts, and walks in the park
People change, cause when I look back I feel strange
Goin through old flicks, our days numbered, turnin the page
I can't go back, we learn to live with hate and respect
A tale from the heart prevail through the pain and regret
Whether, you police or a thug on the streets
Whether, you look for beef or you livin in peace
Whether, you back down or you stand strong bold
Yo we never know what tomorrow gon' hold

[Hook]

{*singer ad libs to fade*}[Hook x4]
It's the N-O-N, P, H, I, X, I-O-N

[Ill Bill]
What does that spell? It spell Non Phixion my friend
The Future Is Now, nuclear shower y'all powerball
I devour all, buildings collapse, towers fall
Killers with gats, millions of carnivores start the war
I shoot rocket launchers riding on dinosaurs
Flying saucers meet the Bible's author
Reveal alien tribal culture
Who designed our DNA structure?
Genetic functions will be made in a laboratory of God's construction
Now bust the combustion Big Bang
Gangbangers that spit slang
Be the truth, not that King James version they teach in schools
Jesus knew, he was thugged out too
A bugged out dude, a loose cannon
In my future we use Magnums, bombs and explosions
I spit like Muhammed to Moses
Ganja smokin', thoughts in constant motion, my mind is ferocious
I spit for gangstas and maniacs that defy prognosis
It's Ill Bill, my reality's my psychosis

[Hook x4]

[Goretex]
What does that spell? It spells Non Phixion my friend
A brave new world, that's safe for all gods and men
Bars of phlegm so therapeutic it's part of the end
The way I spit pain it's hard to pretend, hardly depends
Sticking up delis for quick chips and starving again
Our marketing plans guarantee I'll be parking a Benz
My words are like carcinogens, we be starting the trends
I sharpen the edge with sixteen bars to defend
The arm, leg, leg, arm, head God is haShem
Non Phixion extra-terrestrials, Martians with Tims
Smart as the dead, we at war with the Narcs and the Feds
Uncle Howie sparkin' the stem with the positive grin
Napalm shots, Israeli camo, ammo with the car bomb
I don't exist, close the garage and leave the car on
Amen, suicide watch, and state pen
Street trilogy, one love, I'll see you again

[Hook x4]

[Sabac Red]
What does that spell? It spells Non Phixion my friend
These predicaments got me thinking of spitting again
Lived a thousand lives, died a thousand deaths
Been on house arrest
Lost control, tortured soul depressed
Watch how foul it gets
Suicidal thoughts, wrists slit, it's overdose
Wigs split, mixed with coke, fix the rope, I'm comatose
Eyes bulging, mind swollen, my spirit left the physical
Burning skin, return again, redeem the breath of miracles
We're born suspects, we love porn sex
The drug Ex make the thugs get wild and bust sets
Like a gangsta, our music stimulates your brain
Make you wanna bang, some start to create change
I'm hard to breathe, just before the gods and the thieves
If we want peace then why is it so hard to achieve?
I believe in us, while you faggots sleep on the gods
Uncle Howie, Non Phixion bitch, we beating the odds

[Hook x4][Verse 1: Ill Bill]
They got AIDS infectin' the globe, laser weapons and clones
Conquerors, presidents, death, artificial intelligence
Frozen organs, post mortem, Alien Malachi York
And Five Percenters, drug trials forever
Get your mind together
Who decides truth? guys in ties and suits?
Violent coups, or private schools?
Keep-out rules are taught, duels are fought, using thoughts like swords
Pay for groceries with the DNA codes in your vocal cords
The order of the world has already been bought
Robocops is programmed to kill and ready for war
Drink your cocaine cuz drugs is legal
Androids rule the streets of New York, screamin' fuck the people
Even a priest can fall in love with evil
If a bitch that's suckin his dick will swallow nut and gulp his semen
Election day, young Americans will vote for demons, overachieving
Yo we sniff blow or blow up precincts

[Hook: Ill Bill & Goretex]
Welcome to Futurama, where the cyborgs will shoot ya mama
A cross between Terminator 3 and Tutankhamen
This is Ill Bill reporting for a new assignment
Ready to rock with the Ruger nine shinin'
This is Futurama, where the cyborgs will shoot ya mama
A cross between Terminator 3 and Tutankhamun
This is Ill Bill reporting for a new assignment
Ready to rock with the Ruger nine shinin'

[Verse 2: Goretex]
The noose is tight, the news is sightings, the truth's frightening
Kabbalah studies in 51 produced by the titans
Follow the sergeant, the one handling largest events
Made the top of department fire bombing projects and temps
Video farewell's off to majesty, it's all for salary
I never hold a grudge, takin' judges to Applebee's
My teams fast, the IRS be thuggin' with masks
On the run for war games, bugs, and funnelling cash
I'll rob anyone, a lawyer with a gun in his stash
Beneath the remains of human ash, the gun in the bag
Gangsta, cherry Ketamine, the medicine, Pirelli spin, the new order
(Speakin' through television like Benny Hinn)
We rock blades and pop collars like hockey rings
'Pac was framed, they cloned him in the spot near the caves
To vegetate, claimin' credit to detonate
Human bombs, nuclear arms, super market cancer and farms

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
At the fight club, fists, knives, and guns
Tribes of C.H.U.D: Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Drugs
Rainin' blood sorta like Slayer did in '86
Communicate with aliens, there he is
I made Run DMC sell me the devil's soul
Make your head explode with implantable chips by remote control
I told them all what to expect
Fuck love and respect
When you're on your knees with a gun to your head
See Masonic temples, lies, truth, god, devils, science, proof
Nickel plated 9's shoot, crimes loot
I recruit the true mystics
I turn goons futuristic
We too sadistic, comin' at you with 2 biscuits

[Hook][Intro]
"And now it's time bring out the headliner for the evening..."
"Very Special... Please welcome to the stage..."

[Goretex]
Escape from New York, but I be on some Brooklyn bullshit
I pull clips as fast as I dose chicks with dope tits
Tommy Lee called, said the coke's arrivin' at six
Got my name all in your mouth like your liable to brick
Click me on the tube, chain swinging down to my shoes
Light up the room, african boom, spark it and zoom
Disciple of rock, the type who'll range rifles at cops
I'm spiteful, fakes get left shaking like Michael J. Fox

[Ill Bill]
I deliver AIDS-infected needle accupuncture
Gangster and hustler murderer and kidnap a suspect
Rapper and dusthead, from Blood red to Crip blue
My shit's too colorful, running through with a hundred goons and maniacs
If a bitch like to suck dick, she a brainiac
Bust up in they mouth piece, see how they react, take it back
Like a instant replay, live in the PJ's, watching my Uncle freebase
Analyzing the anguish on a fiend's face
I learned to love my trees laced, the way the PCP taste
The way it make me see things, old school dice spot bills and sheep skins
As I write this I'm rocking Iceberg jeans and Timbs
Thinking where I'm gon' be in 2007
Either a house in the Hamptons or a house in Heaven
I be chillin on the beach in the South of Venice
Or merking the President live on Channel 7

[Hook: DJ Premier scratches] - repeat 2X
"Coming through rocking"
"Wild like Rockstars who smash guitars" (Inspectah Deck)
"Non-Phixion"
"Unadulterated"
"Emcee's"

[Sabac Red]
I be Brooklyn till I die don't even question it twice
My crew nice, late night in them corners we shoot dice
Just like summertime in New York, jean-shorts, Timbs, Nubuck
Tanktops with kufis, groupies acting loosely
Who be in a black drop, with his hat cocked, that cat 'Bac
Puffin a stoge and spittin snapshots
I'm trying to live, feed the kids, drive some whips, handle biz
Own a crib, do my shit, in the streets, that's how it is

[Ill Bill]
If I say rock star, I'm talking about rocking the mic
My shit's hot like the rock a fiend drop in a pipe
These cats is idiots, with raps so pussy they catch periods
I'm serious, my life is like a drug experience
A porno movie with no plot and I'm the only guy in it
Like Vivid videos with Kobe Tai dime bitches
Ill Bill rap crusader, chilling in the black Navigator
Canarsie to Pennsylvania

"Wild..."
"Like..."
"Rock...Rockstars"
"Who...Who smash guitars"

[Hook]

[Goretex]
Break Mumia out, bang in with shells and heaters out
Blast off the terrorist, blow bombs and speakers out
Hookers and bricks, gutter cats, bitches and pimps
Cripples and Gimps, ex-cons, pushers and tricks
Street poet, speak the essence, what's realer than this
Up in the club smoked out coke, the feeling of Cris
You light in the wrist, Richard Simmons fro with a pick
Taking my record label hostage if they stoppin my shit

[Sabac Red]
I remember them cold nights and long lines for clubs
Now it's strictly V.I.P., free drinks and drugs
Pounds and hugs, getting back rubs, we them underground thugs
Who stay street but got new found love
Take a Continental, drive a rental, travel the globe
Non Phixion to the end worldwide we rock shows
Explode from out the projects, Glenwood to Throggs Neck
Hold your drink up, and make a toast to how the gods get

[Hook] - 2x(Ill Bill:)
Non Phixion's still the real hip hop, the CIA still wanna kill me
They want to drag me in a courtroom and find me guilty
Because I reign in blood, I’m the master of puppets
That’s pulling your strings and my brain is bugged
You chumps have ruled enough, I put you to death like Chuck Schuldiner
Among the living like Anthrax, my thugs deliver dog
Now who’s crying? Peace sells but who’s buying?
Crucified like a messiah in a fire dying
This song is K-Rock I stay hot like Gene Simmons
In ‘76 ? I’m on it
Started to write your Obituary, Slowly We Rot
Smoking pot, woke up this morning and spoke to God
He told me the world’s over, worldwide nuclear assault
Circle of tyrants bring the Celtic Frost
Gangster rappers and all types of guns
Religious fanatics and rifle nuts with platinum albums
The path I travel's like the dragon shadow, invisible to CIA camera angles
They got a file on every rap group, they killed the last man who had proof
They after me for information that I have too

[Hook]

I’m paranoid tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I might have to blast you
The CIA trying to kill me, we bad news
Get the fuck up out my way when I pass through

I’m paranoid tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I might have to blast you
The CIA trying to kill me, we bad news
Fuck around with Non Phixion? That’s a bad move

(Sabac:)
Symbolism, socialism, live life to the fullest
If they try to take mine then I’mma wave the nine and pull it
My patience is running thin, spy agents coming in
Trying to lock me down for now I have to hide the gun again
It’s punishment, the courts and prisons, the cross and Christians
I know the difference between reality and false religion
My thoughts envision freedom and peace
But the hood still breed beef and people bleed in the street
We got AIDS and cancer, teenagers crash into buildings with planes in Tampa
I can’t explain the answer, I can only stand for what I believe
Family, friends, health, wealth, good food, pussy, and trees
I be the one to make a fist and raise it, sober or wasted
The basics, overstand the bullshit that you’re faced with
The water’s laced with chemicals, you can taste it
Leaves you brainsick, angry and full of hatred
Like nobody likes you now you become spiteful
Self-hate is frightful, look at the face of Michael
I fight you for justice, freedom, and equality
These creeps keep following me

[Hook]

(Goretex:)
I’m a survivalist, they said I should’ve been dead over a year ago
With a barcode on my head God knows my intent
Thug hummers with thugs drunk with guns
Drunk on drugs, moshpits, popping collars keep it crunk in the club
Busting for fun, Canarsie to Spain, trunk with carcass parked in the rain
I see you faggots barking the name
Fake fame you get your wig sprayed, your image is played
Stop keeping it gully, cut the Sam Kinison braid
Keep your song sweet my life verses like tight virgins
Out in LA I’m up in hot tubs with night nurses
Exed out, sniff the white pony, ceremony open shit
See me through the smoke, nervous system full of opiates
The MDA shoot points like NBA blew the advance on firearms I got ten to play
Catch a facelift, your grave makeshift, face decay
Surveillance raped with broomsticks, they got tapes today
State of the world address, NY some killers for sport
Home of the shit talk, crack houses, prisons, and chalk
Blows against the system, Pentagon smashed
Windows inside a victim symptoms of the universe observed

[Hook][Verse One: Ill Bill]
Holy shit, they tried to torture me, three officers bleed nauseously
They eating pork and beans and involved in Pagan sorcery
Super vegan, heard your crew is beefing, now goons is creeping
Hebrews blacker than Zulus and guidos rocking wifebeaters
DT’s rocking Fubu up in the ninth precinct
Rusty pipes, no-bar types scheming through life cheating
Seen the pig get shot in the face for the right reasons
Find a way to civilize a trife heathen
The Ill Bill collector suicide king, my sounds are hard drugs
We God’s thug popping off guns, you lost blood
Like you lost your head
Talking to me is like having your fortune read
By a fourth-century sorcerer that tortures men
Then try to walk the subway platform with gats drawn
Like a postal worker coming home drunk and just lost his job
That’s what we dealing with in Roman times
I never liked schools, fucking devils always told me lies
And try to brainwash
But re-evaluate everybody fucking hates cops
And if you blasted one you gained props
Hyper shit, Roddy Piper shit, tiger type to sniper shit
Be selling my fly shit for five percent, fuck that
I be on top going for delf
Twelve thousand units then I sold another twelve
I Shot Reagan was the joint that sparked the tight chaos
Like stray shots that spray cops, break up the séance

[Verse Two: Jise One]
Eh yo white thugs is shot watch war minister’s spot
Niggas are clocked up cause the undergound explodes hot
Melting pot, the vandal four angle to stop your free fall
Before you get the sawed-off, welcome to get your timbs sawed
Lyric evangelist, I’ll never turn the cheek
I tore it off your face, it ain’t sweet, sour to hot piece
Speak to hear your half-ass multiplied by two
Goon niggas is anal, through the butt they learn to chew food
Spit it out, you talk shit Q, your rhymes are old too
So you see me split ways
Seven to give to high shroom
Zoom as your lady flashing sideways
Battle you for the saddle (i see you), lost the rhythm to foreplay
Nasty king interpret, delegate passion swimmer
Sinner to all religious sect, tremor to any bigger
Trigger to mental pistol power, shower your appearance
Clearance shatter the nearest foul play, who wanna feel this?

[Verse Three: Goretex]
This is camp site, take my advice, a game of life
Holy nights like Hanukkah lights amid your gun fights
Tel Aviv with laser sights, pluton shit
Eh yo we move shit
Left-wing cats straight out of goon flicks
So Uncle Howie gave them pigs a chase
We here to fit the states
Glenwood projects made trays into base
Y’all can’t emerge in a safe place
I turn energy into sensory data in high rates
W-H-T, your TV’s and CD’s
LSD flash, kill my landlord for seven G’s
Tangle with my clique, I’ll leave you shackled from your dick
Mexican magic (?) (peyote?) (owe me?) an extra clip
Yo I was bred with a tortured head
Connected with the dead, don’t bother with needles, we conquered then fled
Cashless society awaits us, don’t ever trace us
You caught me, sort of like Kiss without the makeup

[Verse Four: Q-Unique]
Incineration of your whole Generation X
Next context sounded similar to top ten
Must stop when I drop panic and see what I’m thinking
Iceberg your brain state got your mind sinking
Open like the fat beats I’m singing
Consider it illiterate, you can’t read between the lines
I’m ten times the pen rhymes you write on blue lines
Exaggerated existence of commercial sounds
Like pussy politicians got political prisoners locked down
Knock down and hit you with the impact
Of a penny tossed off the observation deck of a skyscraper
I spy my paper like a board or secret cult
The vital data that can shatter government bodies, rock parties
Like a boulder rolling through a nightclub
One might bug at the fact that fourteen years
Of rap only got me underground dap
I’m past that like I missed my stop on the A-Train
Here’s the weight gain from the great brain
Pass the spray paint(old man talkin)
Why haven't you learned anythin? Its all there!
Its all there in Toynbee, in those books on the shelf
Supression breeds violence
Your gonna raise the curfew an hour?
Whould you look outside! you see that kid?
Last week he just wanted to get laid
Now he wants to kill somebody

Chorus
Why? why you feel the need to hold me down?
Who? Who the hell is you to think you down?
Where? where you gonna be in two thousand and two?
Take these words home an think them through

Check the scary facts,look at where we at, terrorist
Pronoteriast,known to carry gats,yo we interact
Take it back,fourteen ninty-two
The devil send over the crew
In america the devil grew
To decure the time out,politician be the governments
Foreverance,bar-bar-ian heretence,forever sick
Inject a microchip into my dick
See these riminals in war on trout,pleading the fifth
An a mental slavery continuse,inforius food
It a be their favorite dish on the imperalist menu
We fight to liberate your mind state
But all I see is the fuckin crack rock,the body count
An the crime rate,notice the life of death cycle
About the wit or wit the rifle
Like malcom x and stokely carmichael
Jump on the stainles steel chair again
Anti-american,walking the west bank
Like a desert storm veteran

Chorus(repeat twice)

I wanna be the catalist for every street lyricist
I wanna see this movement like it was in eighty-six
I'd free every son from every crimes he ain't commit
I'd want purges on the gilityn with their next spliff
I'd sell the Brooklyn Bridge to a Saudi for an Audi
And i'd say, it was property of the Kings County
I'd reverse the effects of physical neglect
I'd want hoes in front of mirrors askin,wheres my self respect?
I'd want Ralph Lauren to get down with Karl Kani
No rode-o drive smack in the middle of south side
I really want the Latin Quarter back open
A pack of newport for fifty cent an a quarter for a token

Chorus(one time)

Sabac blow to stab a rap chemist,envioromentist
Feel the highlights of life through the roots of John Fuentes
Consequences,to move shapers in a quarter
Twenty heads just got slaughtered
From the stress of a new yorker,check the laws of orca
To holding tokens how we built it
Life filled with smoke and piss and drinking cho-co-filthy
Four and three sixty for non phixion be the obvious
We never jake,eliminate fake,stay alive in this,survivalist
Overcome reflections of my inner demons
My mind relate to crime like fertile eggs relate to seamans
I close my eyes like I was deciezed,invision peace
That refuel from the sun to east

Chorus(repeat twice)

This rap may shatter your fate or strengthen it
Or you will end a you
My tempaments foul like tenaments
I feel you sensing it
To get a horror deeper than prophecies
Planning you on the rest like jesus on the estapome
Jerusalim sun down on a hill
Three bodies suspended crookedly,they booking me
My backs against the wall with ones they pushin me
Its stated,like rightgeous kings in the line of David
Never mercedes all them others made that got me jated
Facing a agony,victorious,call me mak-a-beez,apocolyptic
Hexing my rivalries through chemistries
Its drama time,sudent size guys rocking econo-line
Sitting on pick and trying to catch gor slippin on punchlines

Chorus(repeat 3 times)[Verse 1: Sabac]
Sabac I let loose, claiming truths is consequential
Paranoid MCs diving in high speed like Yentl
Think I got a pencil, to blacklist devils moving the Rosewood
With Singleton, we stop a flow good
Whippleton killer top biller for G's, Non Phixion sleepers with jeans
Never fall asleep, lace Pall Mall, a final call like cattle disease
Rip mics, stab with wordplay
Dipped like sherm stay, my school clothes bloody from swordplay
If I had a nation, I'd be a Mason like Cosby
Rap odyssey don't stop cause I'm kamikaze
Gut a fuck Nazi, spill the beat son and take five
I can show you sides of humans of most bastard homicides
Killers walk free, juiced off Hennessy P
So Benet Ramsey {?} me on LSD
You dicks are stupid, consider humans chopped up on Euclid
You can't prove it, puppy dog eyes like Droopy

[Verse 2: Goretex]
An awful calamity, I have the FBI after me
They barely batter me, because I speak on how they data be
Corrupted, I use a disguise inside they eyes
See the day, 7/4, meaning jungle of the lies
Samurai sci-fi, Shanghai to C.I
Rabbis in God fill my pock' with dragonflys and Geminis
Brooklyn, home of the Dodgers, Russian massages
Where thugs be copping guns and kids are aged without they fathers

[Verse 3: ILL Bill]
My lyrics twist like bamboo sticks
And BBQ African headhunting cannibals, running down your avenue
Stabbing you, Goretex vexed, in Xanadu
Two thousand two we here to rock for food and praise and God and gratitude
Missile command latitudes, blasting dudes
Asking you's, over there yeah you, how can we tear through
Invisible prison cells, the projects where we dwell
Has, many traps, that we must avoid or we'll be destroyed
Sometimes people don't really take the time to think about
The consequences and so they wind up locked behind fences
And that's by far the worst case of all scenarios
Don't let the Devil get your soul[ILL Bill]
Had the time of his life, a capitalist with a communist wife
Started to fight and did to cats what God did to Christ
Hardly the type to give garbage advice, he was larger than life
He'd penetrate the roof of your car with a spike
Trained by an insane ex-marine
CIA trained a renegade assassin android
Passport pilot to black helicopter choppers over Bosnia
Sniffed so much coke nose was fucked up and bled a lot
For all y'all bystanders baggy ass jeans to hide ya banga wranglers
Thugged the fuck out hang with bash-in-ya-face-gat-gangsta governments
These other kids is like the drunken bitch
That sucked a hundred dicks at your party and cried rape
Plus the hooker lies great, sniff another line to get ya mind straight
Pull out the nine and start shooting people
Money ain't the root of evil it be much more than that
America taught me how to kidnap and torture cats

Ill bill: Hook
Exit the stargate, initial perception quickens my heart rate
This dark place planet Earth orbits one star
Come from afar far away state of mind
Open up your 3rd eye Black Helicopters in the sky

[Goretex]
I need G's so I can jet easier, my crib's tapped
I suspect Ether, that's why I'm out of touch with the media
Undercovers like Pete Seiger, I couldn't tell neither
Watchin' the projects with a van of speakers
Peepin' how my kids rest, bangin' my wiz for hours
Surveillance tapes pissin' in King's Plaza even got us after hours
Drug parties, golden showers on the poor shiksa
Work for the FBI so anytime I might whisper
My scary team be like barely clean, rockin' Israeli jeans
That's why I mostly heard and rarely seen
Realization soaked in urgency
Can't escape history's pen I be the worst of me

Ill bill: Hook

[Sabac Red]
This cop bring the city hoppa like a rocka with binoculars
Took me and these 2 Rastas and a mobster cat for hostage
Said that we were imposters and impetuous government agent
From another nation and said we had the proper information
About the aliens, vegetarians, devils, and Aryans
These are civilized Barbarians, we'll fuckin' bury them
The rasta said you pussy blood clot got you shot
I'm like fuck this I'm blowin' up spots cause shit is hot
We know about the plan from the projects and contraband
Drop bombs on Brazil so you can kill and conquer land
Your drug trafficking, your new creation for disease
To control the population and in the states and overseas
Put poison in the weed and the milk we feed our seeds
You looked shocked that Sabac could know the plots to all of these
Took his Glock licked a shot when the bastard wasn't lookin'
Threw him out then the mobster flew the chopper back to Brooklyn

[Ill bill: Hook][Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Ay yo I spit it at you, hit you up, Ill Bill, Brooklyn be the place where I rest at
The foundation, the truth, the death trap
My uncle Howie on the couch, high on dope
5714 Farrugut Road, the projects I grew up broke
Used to read Spiderman while my uncle burned holes in his clothes
Nodding out mid-sentence eyes closed when he spoke
Coughing and choking the weed that he smoked (What!)
Speaking in non fiction, yall listening
Ear to the streets, it's like they got the sidewalk wired
Underneath our feet
Young Bill, Young Vader, Bastard swordsman
My mind is like the script from an Italian gore flick
I'm caught between worlds
I've seen light inside the darkness but I still can't decide which way to turn
I can't decide which way to burn
So I'm a light it up a both ends and watch it unfurl

[Chorus]
Caught between worlds, non phixion
So many people understand the same pain that I feel
They feel the same way
They think the same thoughts, though the names change
Same love, same hate
Same truth, same fate

[Verse 2: Goretex]
Yo it started back in apartment buildings
Poverty stricken, Mom's was sick but I still smelled the love from the kitchen
Drugs in the hall, coalition, no pots to piss in
My pops never gave a fuck if I ate or if I die in prison
Survival's iffy, the city's gritty is in me
Turn ya soap into fifties, burning coke like gypsies
Frozen in time, a cold shoulder hope on the block
I told you to stop, I feel like I was chosen to rock
Grandpops he caught a heart attack watching the news
God forgive a motherfucker now for stopping my food
I'm watching these dudes spit it out obnoxious and rude
Hunt the green down, scarf it down, mafia food
It's all Pelles, veal paw feeding their bellies
Smoking wet blunts 'til we pass out and repeat the medley
Emotionless blade to the wrist I'ma cease to exist
For all my motherfuckers dead yall could breathe through this

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]
I felt pain as a youth growing up in the hood
On the train by the booth kids got stuck for they goods
Spray painted sneakers, we took their chains and beepers
A bad ass in math class I had to change teachers
Feeling ruthless, useless like bulletproof caskets
A loose bastard watching M.A.S.H and Dukes of Hazzard
Spastic like the son of Sam with a gun in hand
Ain't funny man, I got high and did the running man, wiggin' out
Never had to ? em out, I was the silent type
Living long days and violent nights
My hood was filled with murderers, drug dealers and burglars
Cold killers with burners kid, you ride up where the nurses live
If you ain't play your cards right or spar right
You got laid up in a bed seeing God's light
I lived the hard life, lootin' boostin' timbs and gear
Cause I didn't care, I ain't have food inside the Frigidaire

[Chorus][Hook]
They claim that I'm a criminal...
But they the ones that be sellin crack on the streets (on the streets)

They claim that I'm a criminal...
But they the ones that be bustin gats at my peeps (at my peeps)

They claim that I'm a criminal...
But they the ones committin crime around my way

They claim that I'm a criminal...
I should've been a cop then I'd be a criminal the right way

Verse 1 [ill bill]
The fuck is wrong with you money? dont you overstand, the police is the first and only legalized gang
FUCK the FBI, they ain't in my backyard with gats, its the cops that be all up in my business like that
You fuckin devil, you make me wanna kill you, blast you up, throw you in a garbage bag and seal you
But the real truth is I can't even do no shit like that, I'm not a murderer, thats your job. Thats where you get your cash out. Respect that? never. You devils think youre clever. but it won't last forever, cause we gonna get together, and when that happens yo its gonna be some wild shit. You think the riot in L.A. was fucked up? yo watch this. its like, terrorism multiplied by three hundred and sixty , look around now paw, we burnin down the whole city, fuck it, lets cause a civil war kill em all. we hit the precinct near the barber shop, right behind the mall

Verse 2 [goretex]
They claim their basic mission
Is to protect life and property
Enforce laws through capitalist policy
Stiffens economy
That's prophecy
Killin brothers with no apology
Ive tried to be fair, even with 10 of them there
I'm suspect
Complaints are useless to the PBA
Until you DOA the organized force like triple K
Satantic enemy
Evil attorney
Corrupt pay-offs
And job lay-offs
We're the badge-preferred clergy

[Hook][Verse One]
The cult leader, the war-monger, armed with four high-powered
Firearm barometers; I visited Andromeda
The human cloner, the donate to my fam organ donor
The morbid odor of corpses lowered, the coroner
The cult leader, result needer, the skull and bones bleeder
The chrome heater, the soul eater, the tome reader
The cloak and dagger magnum packer;
Convert star systems to active vacuum
The illest shit since Manson had goons
The great communicator; alien tomb raider
Consume data - cut from the same cloth that produced Vader
The cult leader, the ultimate fighting champion
The benificient, the lamb, the messiah, the religion
There's a thousand faces, more than the cross and the Star of David
I'm the combination of God and Satan
The humble shepherd, the son of lepers, the stuff of legends
The cult leader, I've indulged in the most disgusting of pleasures
Likeable and charismatic; my smilin face has been
Enough to make a mother leave her children in a violent place
I turn knees to noodles; I make my female followers
Want me until they pussy's drippin like fruit juice
The pervert, the pathological, the prophet
I'm the second coming, the Anti-Christ, the final conflict
Who got nuclear weapons and a suicidal doctrine?
The cult leader, and I'll never stop until I got you locked in

[Hook]
Cult leader! "And everywhere, his words are greated with enthusiasm."
Cult leader! "His listeners have found a personal revelation in what he has to say."
Cult leader! "You will obey your instincts, and try to dominate others."
I'm the motherfuckin cult leader! "Such power transforms, elevates; even purifies.."

[Verse Two]
The life taker, followers fly planes into skyscrapers
Send you a disease through the mail wrapped inside paper
The gospel preacher, the hostile teacher
The face of God with an impostor's features
This is the prophecy - the cult leader
The people's temple, the holy ground, the war compound
Four-pound to rifles, disciples, the holy idles
Supreme truth, the cult leader with the green tooth
The multi-millionaire with a stare that can freeze troops
I program people to kill
The motiviational speaker, my words cause people to feel
It's mind control, let the cult leader guide your soul
Open up your eyes to the lies he told
The general, the chief, I be the political pioneer
The cult leader, you can believe in me, I am here
Bless the children, take you under my wing, shelter
Helter Skelter, this is it, you can't kill me I'll exist forever

[Hook]
Cult leader! "The leader - a champion of the underdog."
Cult leader! "He tried to show the path of truth, to amaze all mankind."
Cult leader! "Scorned.. ridiculed.. and condemned.."
I'm the motherfuckin cult leader! "Words are inadequate..
.. to convey the majesty, of the" - Cult leader!
{*"The leader" scratched repeatedly*} I'm the cult leader!
{*"The leader" scratched repeatedly*} Cult leader!
{*"The leader" scratched repeatedly*} I'm the motherfuckin cult leader!
{*"The leader" scratched repeatedly*}[Verse One]
I got the, double-barreled microphone in my grips
And let alone chips, fallin down steps and breakin hips
We on some MC shit, we battle to the death
Ask KRS, how many suckers he dissed just to get respect
That's what it's all about, fuck the money
We snatchin thousand dollar chains offa throats, still dressin bummy
Whether you're intellectual or a fuckin dummy
We comin through, ain't nuttin sweet and ain't nuttin funny
My mindframe's like jumpin backwards out of planes
Fuck the fame, I'd rather keep a level head within this deadly game
Twistin the bliss on hot Non Phixion cataclysm
Shattered your vision like a gat blastin at your children

[Verse Two]
I had evil thoughts from ancient pain
They stabbed me, put a chip in my brain, and told me to pray
So I don't think the same
My body sings of extensions alien
The mic's my only weapon
Walkin the streets with sick Israelians
Abundant, a one-time Democratic consultant
Public housin gone and obvious strains of Satan's comin
Camou' and leaves, don't breathe, one in my head
I took a look around and smelled the defecation in red
Harry gorilla Hebrew DeLouise stee', runnin in fatso
Bloody vasco', hard to earn like Donnie Brasco
You brothers heard me, walkin on eggs like Bruno Kirby
Shittin on Feds, fine germ me on how they livin with scurvy
None of you rappers worthy, buried in crooks, I bury books
Apocalyptic Doo Wop when Non Phixion hit you with jooks

[Verse Three]
Doo Wop, tape master, massive attack
Counteract, set the door, be free to strike the playback
Non Phixion, five times mad, planet Uranus
Nameless MC can suck a dick to make him famous
Truth lies within the eyes of one spirited thought
Reach seven speeches of the thesis done by Melachi York
Our crucial day and time, beware the thin ice and short lines
Plus the trendy who be usin revolution in they rhymes
Phony bastards!  Make me fuckin SICK with all that shit!
If you really for the cause, then meditate through conflict
And if you not, then you not, FUCK YOU, but keep it true
And if you are, then you'd help to free Mumia Abu![Intro]
What is the most important thing in-in Uncle Howie's life?
Drugs... drugs and music

[Hook x4]
"My drug music, theraputic to the user" - Mobb Deep
{*scratches*} Non Phixion - slam dance to it

(Verse One)
Y'all valley of the dolls, married to the mob
Fuck carry at the proms sabotage your god with the chron
Call my Dusk wildin, the rap Dennis Hopper, Black Helicopters
Smash a teleprompter blast in front the Black Sabbath concert
First role hospital nurse blow
Life is good in the hood and when I skis it snows
Portable hard drugs autoshotguns we got thugs
Get my cock sucked by rock groupies and pop sluts
Weird chicks, with big titties and pierced clits
Exotic dancers in love with Bill the fuck you think
Catch me at the bar, tripping off the drugs and drink
Bloods and Crips, coke dealing thugs and pimps
Under the influence of things I bring to drug music
To shootin' you up, with dope beautifully composed narcoctics
Its diabolical, your like a crack head prostitute
Without the loot, witness the music that's responsible

[Hook x4]

(Verse Two)
I'm fighting a war inside my mind, the more I've lost, the more I find
The mortified towards the skies, open wide rain warm
You get ya brain torn, brain storm till the pain gone
We gon' unify the streets against the beast so get your gang on
Hang on for life, OD, relevant drugs
Herion buzz, my team some intelligent thugs
Y'all fear emotion, my crew pack the dance floor
Like dance more me and my man's whore snap y'all like ham haul
Its like a jungle sometimes we life in gangland
Brooklyn, criminals thieves thugs and hoodlums
Cats'll pull they gun out, take over ya drug route
Then blow off ya legs and feet and order you to run out
I'm in a three piece on the streets like peace peace
But got guns for you cats who wanna see a cease beef
I don't breathe right, my life don't seem right
I don't see nights, and won't until my whole family eats right

[Hook x4]

(Verse Three)
I cop this Buick with the seats pulled out in the back ways
I keep an ugly pack a villains like killers and crab gangs
Some are religious fastness, some are hype, some others blastin
Some are dead or in jail fathers or young bastards
I pump the drug music, abuse beats I been through it
S.P's and MPC's, OZ's and QP's
Coke rocks to M3's Get jerz to VP's
Work our way up, we dont give a fuck who gets stuck
Getcha ate up, we saw the world layin' the cut
I coulda went to college, stay in bed with drug scholars
Prayin for bricks, fancy whips plants n kicks
Exotic chicks...tongue pierced blow with the pussy flicks
Like click click, the paparazzi trippin' off six
Ripping off kids, the shorty cat who whips with the clip
Like I'm in Vegas with a trunk a coke
Up in ya projects and ya never know I'm sellin soap
Smellin the dope
Hold the pope in Brooklyn how we took his wallet plus his laptop
Jumped in the whip, skidded to the neighbor's crack spot

[Hook x4]* released in limited quantities to promote "The Future is Now"

[Verse 1]
Check the scary facts look at where we at
Terrorists pull the teary gas
Known to carry gats so we interact
Take ya back fourteen ninety two
The devil sent over of a crew in America the devil grew
To the current time now the politician be the devilish forever rich
Barbarian heretic, forever sick
Inject the microchip into my dick
See these criminals of war on trial pleadin' the fifth
And the mental slavery continues if it was food
If it was food it would be there favourite dish on the imperialist menu
We fight to liberate ya mind state
But all I see's the fuckin' crack rock
The body count and the crime rate
Notice the life and death cycle
Why they whip them with the rifle
Like Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael
Sharpen the stainless steel sherrigan and tie ya weaponry
Walkin' the West Bank like a desert storm vendorin'

Hook:
Why?, why you feel the need to hold me down
Who?!, who the hell is you to think you down
Where?!, where you gonna be in two thousand and two
What?!, *scratching* "Take these words home and think it through"
(2X)

[Verse 2]
I wanna be the catalyst for every street lyricist
I wanna see this movement like it was in eighty six
I free every son from crime he ain't commit
I want Persians on the guillotine, with they neck split
I sell the Brooklyn bridge to a Saudi for an Audi
And I say, it was proper-ty, of the kings county
I reverse the effect, of physical neglect
I want whores in front of mirrors askin' where's my self respect
I want Ralph Lauren to get down wid Karl Kani
Have rodeo drives smack in the middle of Southside
I really want the Latin quarterback open
A pack of Newports for fifty cent and a quarter for a token

Hook (1x)

[Sabac Red]
Sabac hold the style of rap chemist, environmentalist
Feel the highlights of life through the roots of John Flugen
Caught in clenches, the moon shape is in a quarter
Twenty heads just got slaughtered from the stress of a New Yorker
Check the laws of Orca, the holy token's how we built it
Life's filled wid smoke and piss and drinkin' sharp cold feeled it
Four and three sixty for Non-Phixion be the obvious
We handle jakes eliminate fake, stay alive in this
Survivalist overcome reflections of my inner demons
My mind relates to crime like fertile eggs relate to semens
I close my eyes like I was deceased
Envision peace then refuel from the sun in the east

Hook (2x)

[Verse 4]
This rap may shatter your faith or strengthen it or you will end-er you
My temperaments foul like tenements I feel you sensitive
The ghetto horror deep within prophecies
Plannin' your own arrest like Jesus tell me you stoppin' me
Jerusalem sun down on the hill three bodies suspended crookedly
They bookin' me, my backs' against the wall with words they pushin' me
It's stated, like righteous kings in the line of David
Never Mercedes all them others made they got me jaded
Facin' the agony victorious call me Maccabees
Apocalyptic, hexin' my rivalries through chemistry
Drama time, shootin' shy guys rockin' econolon
Shootin' no peekin' tryna catch Gore trippin' on punch lines[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
They got AIDS infectin' the globe, laser weapons and clones
Conquerors, presidents, death, artificial intelligence
Frozen organs, post mortem, Alien Malachi York
And Five Percenters, drug trials forever
Get your mind together
Who decides truth? guys in ties and suits?
Violent coups, or private schools?
Keep-out rules are taught, duels are fought, using thoughts like swords
Pay for groceries with the DNA codes in your vocal cords
The order of the world has already been bought
Robocops is programmed to kill and ready for war
Drink your cocaine cuz drugs is legal
Androids rule the streets of New York, screamin' fuck the people
Even a priest can fall in love with evil
If a bitch that's suckin his dick will swallow nut and gulp his semen
Election day, young Americans will vote for demons, overachieving
Yo we sniff blow or blow up precincts

[Hook: Ill Bill & Goretex]
Welcome to Futurama, where the cyborgs will shoot ya mama
A cross between Terminator 3 and Tutankhamen
This is Ill Bill reporting for a new assignment
Ready to rock with the Ruger nine shinin'
This is Futurama, where the cyborgs will shoot ya mama
A cross between Terminator 3 and Tutankhamun
This is Ill Bill reporting for a new assignment
Ready to rock with the Ruger nine shinin'

[Verse 2: Goretex]
The noose is tight, the news is sightings, the truth's frightening
Kabbalah studies in 51 produced by the titans
Follow the sergeant, the one handling largest events
Made the top of department fire bombing projects and temps
Video farewell's off to majesty, it's all for salary
I never hold a grudge, takin' judges to Applebee's
My teams fast, the IRS be thuggin' with masks
On the run for war games, bugs, and funnelling cash
I'll rob anyone, a lawyer with a gun in his stash
Beneath the remains of human ash, the gun in the bag
Gangsta, cherry Ketamine, the medicine, Pirelli spin, the new order
(Speakin' through television like Benny Hinn)
We rock blades and pop collars like hockey rings
'Pac was framed, they cloned him in the spot near the caves
To vegetate, claimin' credit to detonate
Human bombs, nuclear arms, super market cancer and farms

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
At the fight club, fists, knives, and guns
Tribes of C.H.U.D: Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Drugs
Rainin' blood sorta like Slayer did in '86
Communicate with aliens, there he is
I made Run DMC sell me the devil's soul
Make your head explode with implantable chips by remote control
I told them all what to expect
Fuck love and respect
When you're on your knees with a gun to your head
See Masonic temples, lies, truth, god, devils, science, proof
Nickel plated 9's shoot, crimes loot
I recruit the true mystics
I turn goons futuristic
We too sadistic, comin' at you with 2 biscuits

[Hook]* released in limited quantities to promote "The Future is Now"

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
When you enter my house of worship
Your crucifix, I doubt it
Only Christianity I recognize is my man Khrist's album
Flip the pages of Isis Papers killin' racist
Federal agents, roll up rockin' masks with they techs
Computer matrix classified access throw on ya gas mask
The devil's bash flash reflected off the lights gats blast
(Hopes to those) Leavin' ya inner deep with ya chromosomes blown
Roamin' the catacombs of the phantom zone
(Ask yourself) How can we obtain true equality
When the value and price of life is less than technology?
They tryna call this a civil-ization
But what the hell is civilized about buildin' weapons and space stations
Cease and just call it what it really is
A technologically barbaric society like the Ancient Romans
I see the writing on the wall
The devil killed the righteous man
But now the rest'll take the savage beast to war

[Verse 2: Goretex]
Remember rules of ancient, crusty like basements, study like spaceships
Ain't no probin' wid metal processors temperature placements
Teeth of a dragon, face of a lion
Children of Zion half bleeds who defacate iron
Burnt in flames we firin' robots and the bible insane
Unknown intelligence son to the sun we're astral residents
Bigger than rap let's make this album decadence
Turn mass to energy, medicine and telepathy, conspiracy, Tel Aviv
Buildin' the food pyramid type heart with the left plate
Confess stay, raw like stones on my breastplate
It seems to me they all had hands in Nazi thievery
It's ninety six brothers use brains at low frequencies
One time for sharp kids, killers do biblical
There's two ghettos, one in the mind, the other physical
Break through, I be on the search for other niggas
Race haters and prostitutes just as sinful as jail niggas

[Verse 3: MC Serch]
I step to Fat Beats, it's filled with ghetto philosophers
Beat lovers and derelicts plus urban stenographers
The way they take my words to their throat and dictate 'em
To they man, like they was in the lab and just made 'em
From scratch but we can catch you on that parade
Cause in the end you sound like wax
That ten other emcees made
I'm throwin' shade to the willow
When you weepin' on the pillow
We'll know when it's time for finger prints
To be rubbed out with Brillo skills
Go through changes includin' cats that rearrange 'em
So if you hold my skills for ransom better kill 'em fore I claim 'em
I don't see Jehovah tellin' you that it ain't over
My carb take the eye of the storm, through this soldier
Sworn to defend the faith rap monk in New Tibet
If you want the holy doctrine tell 'em we this crew to get
Now who's next, uh, it's Non-Phixion, Non-Phixion{*Pete Rock scratches various samples at the beginning*}

[Verse One]
I used to be a piece of shit 'til I dropped it, EDR convict
Straight projects, prophets, that's the object
Hunger pains spit the beef out, I kick the teeth out
We Non Phixion, up in the club with heaters out
No doubt, insanity the motive, I'm never broke
Body strapped with explosives, suicide bat ya team poseurs
Teenybops rock Tachini tops and arm holsters
Lookin like feds in posters, devils and brokers

I got a lot of love, but if you want hate, I got a lot of guns
You want crack? I got a lot of drugs, it's kinda bugged
The way the world can make a righteous man turn savage
I try to be peaceful but the world prefer madness
And I'm a business man, supply and demand
Make you feel like when your fam get in a shootout and your man die in your hands
Most dangerous rap group, any question that I ask you
Thug be the answer to the question that's the truth

[Hook]
If you got love for your mom - that's Non Phixion
If you got love for your dogs - that's Non Phixion
If you got love for the Gods - that's Non Phixion
What? That's Non Phixion - What? That's Non Phixion
If you got love for your peeps - that's Non Phixion
If you got love for your seeds - that's Non Phixion
If you got love for the streets - that's Non Phixion
What? That's Non Phixion - What? That's Non Phixion

[Verse Two]
BK to Mount Vernon, money-earnin non-stop
I lost a lot of people, I "Reminisce" with Pete Rock
Gunnin through public housing, some brothers never get out
I got love for my dawgs, now it's time to break the fuck out
We pealed out, that's when I dumb out, three on the hip
I don't kick bars, I spit scars, shit that I live
And all you platinum cats, I'm about to run in ya fridge
We all about food, belly up, two in ya ribs
Ain't doin a bid; nah I'd rather hang from a sheet
It's all love son, prove and let my man speak
Truth is, you never know when it's your time to go
We all famous and we got files, lettin you know

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Aiyyo I seen it all from what the truth should be to what the truth is
I think America been tryin to kill me for two years
But I'm still alive, arrive under heavy surveillance
Eyes be some ol' tel-lie-vision cameras, platinum gangster anthems
Make the world wanna grab the magnum and BUST
All we got is us, our family's the only one we trust
Chronic and coke, smoke spearmints, study pyramids
Dope in the heroin syringe when you hearin this
I'm like a near death experience
I open up your eyes and your minds to the lies they be givin us
If we don't kill them, they killin us
And I'm ready to die, but they still can't kill the love

[Hook]

{*Pete Rock scratches to end*}Ill Bill! (Yo) Mr. Ill Bill! (What?)
Bring the Non Phixion politicians witcha skill

[Ill Bill]
Yeah, yo bottles of liquor smashed
Confrontational a nation full of devilish fools
Follow the massive devil plantational
Patch is disaster, cash laced cripples your visuals
We bringin weapons, they put metal detectors in the schools
And the shoes, the bare-nickel student sparkin wools
Crown Heights militant, {?} rockin tools
Ayatollah, scholar of Torah, dutch master roller
Utilize the solar, to kill the treaty of Erona
Government documents effect the occupents of projects
We come together, buildin with Muslims durin soundchecks
Tradin methods of revolutionary thought
A bunch of terrorists since eighty-six and still we never been caught
Yo, I keep the Secret Service nervous
Federal agencies be suckin surveillance out of my phone circuits
I'm careful, keep my conversations encoded
They've been stressin me ever since that Federal buildin exlpoded
Molotov cocktail, tossin bringer of sorrow
We linger in the Brooklyn borough, where there's no tomorrow
Certified on rugged terrain, military
Shootin up your embassy, kidnappin your dignitaries, WHATI aviate like space pirates during race riots
Slay tyrants, pick up and inject 'em with AIDS virus
Display violence like tell-lie-vision pilots
Raise your eyelids, and wake the fuck up, and fire drug sirens
We buckin officers on cocaine assignments blastin fine alignments
They made to crucify and keep us timeless
Dip this image into liquified diamonds
Wrote the holy book and sold they souls to the scientists
Transponders, we split ya blood like anacondas
Computer monitors release heat, and burst thermometers
In cold weather, you try to hold your soul together
With rubber cement, fuck the President, and the government
You fuckin dick, I oughta make you eat your own shit
Kidnap you whack business cats that double dip
Don't have to search far to overstand the reason why you flipped
Money's the root of all that's evil and you slipped
Into the cracks, there's no turnin back, my turn to react
Rollin dairy cats, known to carry gats, so we interact
Take it back to 1492, you devils send over a crew
Now I know them cats that's down with you[Hook One: Non-Phixion]
Yeah yeah I shot Reagan
Fuckin' pagan ate falafel with Menachem Begin
Who the fuck is Carl Sagan?

[Hook Two: Non-Phixion]
I'm the space invader
Ill hieroglyphic translation navigator
Read your thoughts, make you think we chill
Then I blast you later

[Verse One: Sabac Red]
We burn the fuckin' flag
I shot the Devil down like we in Baghdad
His wife's the hostage
Her bodyparts up in a grab bag
Now watch the gun blast, holdin' your chest, marked for death
The President's been shot, somebody notify the press
It's all Reaganomics, welfare, weapons and drugs
The government is thugs, that's why the leader caught a slug
Handle your business, we're writin' Yiddish on your wishlist
My mind's the sickest, deknowledged devils on my shitlist

[Verse Two: Necro]
Necrodamus, hip-hop psychic, bring you the next shady election
Then infected your mind was unprotected
You think me approaching you with a knife looks bad
It'll be worse, when I slice up your flesh it look all plaid
Keep the muskets up in the bookbag, and when a crook stabs
You in the brain, verbally you feel like you dog tagged
The mental grave, which you buried under the dug plot
The walk-in drug spot, a nice picture for me the mug shot, what?

[Hook One] 2X

[Verse Three: Goretex]
Super secret surveillance assailants, Hebrews in Kansas
Wrap you up in bandage, mummified stitch weapons I brandish
Like trucks and bum, coffins airtight, mucus and bed sores
Russian Roulette with bloody headbands, Christopher Walken type
A Deer Hunter, parts unknown, rockin the jeweled throne
Like Solomon, I killed your congressman with two stones
Best in the fuckin country, Israeli camou' dressed bummy
Ghetto guerillas, religious cats be thinkin' Muncie
My solar sect stretch throughout rocks like Stan Goetz
And my vestibule bang on my chest from bad sess
Come and challenge or battle, get skull-fucked, but don't be sore
God ultimately saves those whose motive is pure

[Hook One] 2X

[Verse Four: Ill Bill]
We Elohim, alien brain in my cranium
They locked me in a sanitarium, behind walls of titanium
Fifty-One forbidden classified spy Area
Doctors from Nigeria, Lebanon interior
South Bronx, I walk through epochs and airlocks
Disengagin doorways into time, breakin' cellblock number 13
The Earth scene, reverse gleam, a life beyond, humanoid existence
From light-year distances
I navigate rip the fabric of space in this race against time
Transmit a message backwards through the phone lines
Control minds with fairly common alien technocracy
We laugh at your misguided principals and prophecies
My species shapeshift, take on the form of an Earthling
If I fail to return back home, alert the King
Bring the reinforcements, program the telport coordinates
My spatial origin's the starting point begin your voyage
Into mystery, strange universes, strange history
Yeah I shot your fuckin President, you know my steez!
Not Public Enemy, except we non-fiction, Non-Phixion
Positive and negative because the world's a contradiction

[Hook One]

[Hook One]

[Hook Two][Hook x4]
It's the N-O-N, P, H, I, X, I-O-N

[Ill Bill]
What does that spell? It spell Non Phixion my friend
The Future Is Now, nuclear shower y'all powerball
I devour all, buildings collapse, towers fall
Killers with gats, millions of carnivores start the war
I shoot rocket launchers riding on dinosaurs
Flying saucers meet the Bible's author
Reveal alien tribal culture
Who designed our DNA structure?
Genetic functions will be made in a laboratory of God's construction
Now bust the combustion Big Bang
Gangbangers that spit slang
Be the truth, not that King James version they teach in schools
Jesus knew, he was thugged out too
A bugged out dude, a loose cannon
In my future we use Magnums, bombs and explosions
I spit like Muhammed to Moses
Ganja smokin', thoughts in constant motion, my mind is ferocious
I spit for gangstas and maniacs that defy prognosis
It's Ill Bill, my reality's my psychosis

[Hook x4]

[Goretex]
What does that spell? It spells Non Phixion my friend
A brave new world, that's safe for all gods and men
Bars of phlegm so therapeutic it's part of the end
The way I spit pain it's hard to pretend, hardly depends
Sticking up delis for quick chips and starving again
Our marketing plans guarantee I'll be parking a Benz
My words are like carcinogens, we be starting the trends
I sharpen the edge with sixteen bars to defend
The arm, leg, leg, arm, head God is haShem
Non Phixion extra-terrestrials, Martians with Tims
Smart as the dead, we at war with the Narcs and the Feds
Uncle Howie sparkin' the stem with the positive grin
Napalm shots, Israeli camo, ammo with the car bomb
I don't exist, close the garage and leave the car on
Amen, suicide watch, and state pen
Street trilogy, one love, I'll see you again

[Hook x4]

[Sabac Red]
What does that spell? It spells Non Phixion my friend
These predicaments got me thinking of spitting again
Lived a thousand lives, died a thousand deaths
Been on house arrest
Lost control, tortured soul depressed
Watch how foul it gets
Suicidal thoughts, wrists slit, it's overdose
Wigs split, mixed with coke, fix the rope, I'm comatose
Eyes bulging, mind swollen, my spirit left the physical
Burning skin, return again, redeem the breath of miracles
We're born suspects, we love porn sex
The drug Ex make the thugs get wild and bust sets
Like a gangsta, our music stimulates your brain
Make you wanna bang, some start to create change
I'm hard to breathe, just before the gods and the thieves
If we want peace then why is it so hard to achieve?
I believe in us, while you faggots sleep on the gods
Uncle Howie, Non Phixion bitch, we beating the odds

[Talking]
Yo you dealin' wid militant goons ya know what I'm sayin?
Necro on the track, peace and love to BK
Far Rock, drop it

[Verse 1]
I stash concealables under my under roos, fuck them other crews
I got a hundred goons bustin' you wid puncture wounds
Nothin' but rage, nineteen ninety nine the world change
Now it seem, the devil leaves the righteous man slain
With the brain function, weak and callin'
Reproduction, revolution, assassination, execution, collision
It's best to find my religious credential politicians
Devil's decisions populate prisons
Resistin' arrest, officer investigate my place
Industrial strength flashlight, bash me in my face
These police they, motivate, drug market maneuvers
Gat shooters, visionary military computer operation specialist
My intelligence breeds benevolence
Subtract infested cam of the inheritence
No evidence, gunshots like three blast
Dippin' out the back wid the jet black ski mask
Can't indentify, who he?, you can't see
Jumble the visibility, we camouflage to crimes be
My mind be, venturin' into territories
Eighteen hundred and twenty five days end of story

Hook:
Everywhere I go 5-0 wanna follow
Everytime I flow it's like there's no tomorrow
I can bring happiness or I can bring sorrow
You don't wanna mess around there's no tomorrow
(2x)

*scratching of* "Nah kid" "It's only a matter of time"

[Verse 2]
It's Abraham baggin' grams on a beach in France
Militia dancer my Tony Sicero stance exaggerated
And overblow grimace like the technique of Sugar Ray's left hook
Born to menace, mahatma Christ, bootless bandits on the streets
Bless beats wid treats strictly prime meats, for all my peeps
Non-Phixion, incredible goons bringin' the legacy
Shit, realer than actresses rockin' double masectomies
I represent like Canarsie Artie
Quick to stick a party, intoxicated from Bacardi
Real shit, legit like pigs who carry biscuits
Intrinsic, like your collar mined he owed for brisket
Don't risk it, like Mumia before a caper
Upstate lats get buried, on two point five acres
A crook wid line plus my alibi designed to jerk
Housing officials and feds lookin' for tech nines
I been through more shit than Rocky Dennis
Or Craig Mack's blemish, emcees suck mine and then replenish
Back in Iceland we handy wid the gadgets
Crime ridden like jared extortin' karats on sabbath
Keep it rugged like Tommy
Waco will play ya devastation
And sixty X's for my nation

[Scratching of the words "Refuse to lose"]

[Verse 1]
Here's ya ticket, ain't nothing more sick than terror dome
I walk the path of righteous even when foul like joe peppitone
The clock awoke me, it was like a quarter past six
Got out of bed depressed home wid the kids talkin' bout real shit
Non-Phixion, if you ain't down wid us then you a victim
We stay tight like killers up north a new religion
The ghetto's hell filled wid bad luck and born thieves
Impossible greed throughout the projects mothers that blow weed
Dance like Sam Jackson for rocks, aim at the cops
Camouflage able to sensitise devils wid red dots
I take Ashem's orders keep my team closer to Mexican borders
With no pausin' full outstanders ghetto supporters

Hook:
I got so much trouble on my mind, "refuse to lose"
I got so much trouble on my mind, "refuse to lose"
(2x)

[Verse 2]
My baretta will serenade displays the worldly terror devils made
They spread the plague of AIDS through medicaid
And then they pray to idols made of gold
Drapes ya blood and mark the scroll cold
Broken skulls ontop of frozen totem poles
Although the world's deviled and redded I stay level headed
While these other cats are way too stupid so I doubt they'll ever get it
You can't change somebody ignorant that want to be like that
It's like detoxin' someone hooked on coke who won't stop smokin' crack
Jane what?, unimportant paranoia stricken caught squeakin'
Stickin' these normally peaceful people they clock tickin'
Situations we escape, police station interrogation
I stay a caucasoid mutation and destroy the nation
I got the sharper sound, I fuck you up like you had chicken pox
And got ya ass thrown in a piranha tank
Twistin' the blitz of hot Non-Phixion cataclysm
Shatter ya vision like a gat blastin' at ya children

Hook (2x)

[Verse 3]
I got the balls against order so many people snortin' smack
It's like I died and came back to take the presence of a rat
Cause the streets that I walk is filled with garbage and traps
Sure lack of funds ain't holdin' none
Throughout the mash for better cash
When I was ten I used to buy liquor wid no I.D
Thinkin' back subliminally the store clerk was tryna kill me
I was born in Puerto Rico raised in Brooklyn graz-ing
Forced to be a man before even men became men
Welfare and food stamps poor shit it made me sick
Watchin' dealers all I stood makin' loot holdin' they dick
I hated Eddie Murphy used to wish that he would quit it
All that you ain't got no ice cream shit son, I lived it
The bitter be the winter cold fours and street wars
Saw the cops raid my the block and put the gods in on force
Fifteen now I'm addicted to weed and nicotine
Hip hop, lots of pussy and ladies wid strife scenes
Robbin' gear from Chess King doin' my thing but got caught
Learn to crush ya lies within the whole structure of the thought
I got barred, a j.d. card was bizarre
Started buildin' with the force he put me on that I was God
Travel-ing from the place on the day I realised
That the window to the soul be directly in the eye
Art of war path, I study astrology and math
The equator symbolic to how they split us up in half
From bombs in outer space to violatin' our rights
To cops who shove sticks in asses in Crown Heights
To kids bein' raped to A&R's wid no taste
To classism to race to buck fifties on the face man

Hook (2x)
*scratching of "refuse to lose" until fade*[Intro]
"And now it's time bring out the headliner for the evening..."
"Very Special... Please welcome to the stage..."

[Goretex]
Escape from New York, but I be on some Brooklyn bullshit
I pull clips as fast as I dose chicks with dope tits
Tommy Lee called, said the coke's arrivin' at six
Got my name all in your mouth like your liable to brick
Click me on the tube, chain swinging down to my shoes
Light up the room, african boom, spark it and zoom
Disciple of rock, the type who'll range rifles at cops
I'm spiteful, fakes get left shaking like Michael J. Fox

[Ill Bill]
I deliver AIDS-infected needle accupuncture
Gangster and hustler murderer and kidnap a suspect
Rapper and dusthead, from Blood red to Crip blue
My shit's too colorful, running through with a hundred goons and maniacs
If a bitch like to suck dick, she a brainiac
Bust up in they mouth piece, see how they react, take it back
Like a instant replay, live in the PJ's, watching my Uncle freebase
Analyzing the anguish on a fiend's face
I learned to love my trees laced, the way the PCP taste
The way it make me see things, old school dice spot bills and sheep skins
As I write this I'm rocking Iceberg jeans and Timbs
Thinking where I'm gon' be in 2007
Either a house in the Hamptons or a house in Heaven
I be chillin on the beach in the South of Venice
Or merking the President live on Channel 7

I be Brooklyn till I die don't even question it twice
My crew nice, late night in them corners we shoot dice
Just like summertime in New York, jean-shorts, Timbs, Nubuck
Tanktops with kufis, groupies acting loosely
Who be in a black drop, with his hat cocked, that cat 'Bac
Puffin a stoge and spittin snapshots
I'm trying to live, feed the kids, drive some whips, handle biz
Own a crib, do my shit, in the streets, that's how it is

[Ill Bill]
If I say rock star, I'm talking about rocking the mic
My shit's hot like the rock a fiend drop in a pipe
These cats is idiots, with raps so pussy they catch periods
I'm serious, my life is like a drug experience
A porno movie with no plot and I'm the only guy in it
Like Vivid videos with Kobe Tai dime bitches
Ill Bill rap crusader, chilling in the black Navigator
Canarsie to Pennsylvania

"Wild..."
"Like..."
"Rock...Rockstars"
"Who...Who smash guitars"

[Hook]

[Goretex]
Break Mumia out, bang in with shells and heaters out
Blast off the terrorist, blow bombs and speakers out
Hookers and bricks, gutter cats, bitches and pimps
Cripples and Gimps, ex-cons, pushers and tricks
Street poet, speak the essence, what's realer than this
Up in the club smoked out coke, the feeling of Cris
You light in the wrist, Richard Simmons fro with a pick
Taking my record label hostage if they stoppin my shit

[Sabac Red]
I remember them cold nights and long lines for clubs
Now it's strictly V.I.P., free drinks and drugs
Pounds and hugs, getting back rubs, we them underground thugs
Who stay street but got new found love
Take a Continental, drive a rental, travel the globe
Non Phixion to the end worldwide we rock shows
Explode from out the projects, Glenwood to Throggs Neck
Hold your drink up, and make a toast to how the gods get

[Hook] - 2x
