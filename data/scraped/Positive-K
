[Girl] Uhh, uhh, uhh, I got a man
You got a WHAT?[Verse 1]
[P]Uhm, what's up baby? I been eyeing you
Time and time again, I been trying to
Get a little closer, but you won't let it
[L]Well if I see something I want, I just go out and get it
I'm like a fluzy I'm choosy and I don't fall for tricks
Cause guys be running games, like the New York Nicks
[P]But on the square dear, you know, your style really temps me
[L]Don't try to gas me up on a tank that is empty
[P]I'm Positive, and I'm kicking the facts
[L]Well I'm Lyte, and you got to kick it better than that
[P]But I'm all the way live, but I'm definitely not crabbing
[L]There are just certain things I'm just not having

[Hook]
[P]Excuse me miss
[L]No, I'm not havin' it
[P]Excuse me miss
[L]No, I'm not havin' it
[P]Excuse me miss
[L]No, I'm not havin' it
[P]Excuse me?

[Verse 2]
[P]You think you're all that [L]No you think you're all of this
With your baby, baby talk, and your "Excuse me miss"
[P]Well I smooth, and hey look, it's only right
I thought that we could get together, and maybe we can ...
[L]Yeah sounds good, but guys like you just wanna hit and run
Look, we're not the two, and I'm not the one
So if ya got some thought of taking me to bed
Kill that! And get a five dollar crack-head
[P]But I'm all the way live, but I'm definitely not crabbing
[L]There are just certain things I'm just not having

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
[P]I think you try to diss me or play me like I'm cooly
[L]No, matter of fact love, I think that you're a cuty
There's just certain things you don't understand baby:
Every woman wants to be treated like a lady
[P]So what? You want me to kick it as if I'm a doc?
[L]Listen to what I'm saying and shut ...
I'm just tryna put it, so I can make something happen
You just turned me off by the way that you was gabbling
[P]Look I'm all the way live and I'm definitely not crabbing
A bit of change for a woman, that's what I'm not having

[Bridge]
[L]I keep feelings inside, I know who I am
[P]Step to yourself, cause I don't wanna hear it
[L]I keep feelings inside, I know who I am
[P]You're not getting younger, you're just getting older

[Verse 4]
[L]What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lots of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
Friend. I'm never gonna fall in love again
But getting back to the topic of convo
In my book hone, you are a no-no
[P]C'mon I'm clean, cut, and dabber, you got to admit that
I don't sell drugs and I ain't with the wack track
I'm cool and calm, my phone is mine
You don't see me snatching taste, and acting wild
Excuse me miss, I think you better get with this
[L]Scan it damn, cause I'm simply not having it

[Hook]Uhh.. hey!
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers
Speak on it now
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers

Uhh, uhh!  I call girls carhoppers
Cause I make em hit notes like they was singin at the operas
May I say, on anyday, yeah they with it
They're in a Yugo, if you got the Yugo kitted (say what?)
Stand by your man, yes that's what they all claim
You don't have a car?  Then you're fucked up in the game
They'll walk by ya, and say hiya
Is he drivin cause he cute?  Oh no, his shit
Is tired (oh no)
And they'll turn like you got the virus
Cause you didn't have a car, or the one had there wasn't flyest
But for the record I'm not trickin
But you can call me Timex, cause I'll still take the lickin
So if you're hot and bothered, or in a frenzy
I'll pop _The Mack_ soundtrack in the Benzy
And you can tell me how you choose me baby
Baby, this no time for you, to act crazy
You can't play me, not like Play-Doh
Don't leave me for the kid honey, in the Laredo (speak on it)
But if you gots to go, you gotta go, I can't stop her
That's the lifestyles of the carhoppers

Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (uhh!)
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (uhh!)
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (yeah)
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers

Mmm, uhh!  A yeah baby, things is kinda swivey
Ever since my dad put me up on his Rivi-era
Now I see things much clearer
When I'm in my ride, women wanna be nearer to the
Showstopper, yeah the profiteerer
Uhh, excuse me honey, it's not nice to stare
Dare, if you wanna get with this here
Put on your best gear, and step to the rear
I'll be there, say about 10:30
And know that don't be late honey cause my beeper, is loaded
And, if you're not there, by the toot of the horn
*BEEP* (kick it) Uhh, I'm gone.. carhoppers!

Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (heyyy)
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (yeah)
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (heyyy)
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers

Uhh, now you think things is right; cause she's on
The next man's gooseneck and suckin his exhaust pipe
She's got him and he's got an erection
Just because of his fuel injection, system
All before yeah she used to diss him
Now she knows money on down to his pistons
And his engine, or let's say his chassis
Just blow your horn and she'd run like Lassie
Or better yet, she'd flip like Kujo
If you got a Jag, or a Porsche Turbo (once again, break it down)
They got more promises than Thomases
And I think they better go and call, Hoppers Anonymous
But I know, where to send em
Ah to the Hyundai dealer to gets the Benz emblem

Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers

Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers..Yeah.. uhh, check it right

[Positive K]
Now it's your friends you gotta worry about, to say the least
Cause man, they're stickin to ya kid without the grease
Runnin game in the name of fame
Or talkin about every nice little thing for ya that they've done
And they've done nuttin now too late you learn
Cause all they wanted was uhh, somethin in return
That's a flam and a scam, you can tell I ain't gas it
Bite a check on my rep, and then later, try to cash it
But I got more bounce to the ounce, what I'm sayin
Seven and a half ounces, braincells, on the way in
Cause momma ain't raised none, I ain't changed none
I got work in my work and it stays done
A man twenty-three years yes I've grown
And I've learned that I can do bad on my own
I don't need a friend cause, I've got a brand new car
All cause I'm a, hot new rap star
Maybe cause my bank account is so profound
And since you're my friend, I gotta put you down
Anyway I know clout, only respects clout
And it's your friends kid, you got to worry about

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
It's your friends, oh yea your friends, YOU GOTTA WORRY ABOUT

[Positive K]
A let me tell you let me tell you who your friends are
Your friends ride around, in your new car
They ask for dough when they know you just got dough
They call your house every minute on the hour yo
Talkin bout - let's hang - you don't wanna hang
You wanna go wild maybe do your own thang
But they get mad, and they sweat that
Cause what ya got man they know they can't get that
And they don't take no for an answer either
They wanna see you drivin round like you're Alex Rega
But you can't see, you're not a +Taxi+
That bring girls around when they know you got a main G
Cause that's the person that you spend time with
And spend the time with, it does not combine with
What they wanna do, and what they wanna do
Is hang and if you can't somethin gotta be wrong with you
So tell me why a woman takes a man hand
And tells him things, that makes him feel grand
Large and (?) you're my knight in shining armor
Known this woman, from a soap opera drama
Weak in wickedness I know how you kick it miss
I know you're gonna say who's gonna pay before he's stickin this
Now you're caught without a thought, no need to pretend
Who hooked you up with this girl huh, a friend
No one wants to be around when you're down and out
Cause it's your friends kid, you gotta worry about

[Chorus]

[Positive K]
A nevertheless I, don't like to stress abouts I
Likes to take it easy, do my job, dat's why
My so-called friends, I grew up with
Either fell off, smoked out, or just ain't shit
And the rest I just don't like
And if I see him again, I swear we're gonna fight
But I'm a cool brother, thanks to my mother
And a friend, I really don't need another
But I got peeps, peeps that's true
And on my record - I'm singin all praises due
Just for givin 'em each day, I'm livin on that
To the babies I got to put the Positive in 'em
Cause I'm a loner and known to entrepeneur
And I'm sure you see more..
Whoever made up, the word friendship?
They need to get beat, up with a slave whip
Because they never knew, of what a friend would do
Cause when you're down and out, they never helpin you
They always lead you on, and they sing a song
And when you need 'em somethin's always goin wrong
They said I'm broke yo, I'm on welfare
I didn't have dough, I couldn't get there
My mom is sick, my sis is pregnant
My father's drunk, my house is hectic
And then they flip the script and say I need a quick G
Or couldn't you spare a beat?  C'mon, this is me
You know you'll get it back, aiyyo yea that's a fact
I've already lost a job, and plus be smokin that
Off with you give the dough, cause youse a true friend
But what ya know now if you only knew then
He wouldn'ta got jacked, for the big smack
And it's only right, because it's like that

[Chorus] + ad libs

"That's when you find out who your REAL friends are!""You talkin just like a pimp!"

"You see pimpin's big business
And it's been goin on since the beginning of time
And it's gonna continue STRAIGHT AHEAD
Til somebody up there turns out the lights on this small planet."

[Positive K]
Allow me to propose a toast..

Allow me to propose a toast
From the Pos and not the ??
In this event I've come to swing
Bust a move, present a crown for the king
The true black mack with a knack to attract a stack
Girls attack, I spin dem out like crack
I say, "Cupid, draw back your bow, let your arrow flow
And yo.. hit the ho!"
So let me work my maneuver
There's none smoother, so you know that I'ma soothe her
And uhh, when I start to shoot the gift
The next day, I got you workin on the nightshift

I got you workin on the nightshift
I got you workin on the nightshift

[Big Daddy Kane]
That's right Pos baby
You gotta school these young macks comin up today y'know
I mean to be 'frank', they just hot dogs
The girls are relish, and they need to ketch-up on they pimpin

[Positive K]
Positive!  Oh yes, the fly pimp
I do my thing but I would never attempt
To brag or boast, to try to say that I'm the baddest
When it comes to this, [bitches] know my status
Ridin with Kane in a Mercedes
Flashin high-beams, amongst all the young ladies
They step up askin me to get in
But you know my motto: no skins, no Benz (heh)
I give the kiss of death, just like Blackula
Before you know it, I'm like a mack to her
One whiff of the gap shot swift
And quit your day job, cause now you're on the nightshift

I got you workin on the nightshift
I got you workin on the nightshift

[Big Daddy Kane]
Check it out, I go by the name of..
Well for the time being let's just call me 50 Grand
Because umm.. heheh
There's 50 states and I G'd in each one of them
Heh, kick it baby

[Positive K]
I'm what you'd call a smooth microphone controller
My lifestyle's like suave bola
Keep my hair in a cameo, gettin gas from Amoco
The only thing I'm sniffin is your girlfriend pantyhose
*inhales*  *exhales*  Another hit baby!
And if you find that kinky
Put some barbeque sauce on the tip of my pinky
Watch me get freaky like a nymphomaniac
And exotic, an erotic tour with the mack
No I'm no one to be played with
(Kane: Auditions at 12 baby) for the nightshift

I got you workin on the nightshift
I got you workin on the nightshift

I got you workin on the nightshift

[Big Daddy Kane]
Man, you got to work your women by the scale
I mean if she's skinny, make her bring you home a good penny
And if she fat, make her pay like she weigh
Hmm, come again now

[Positive K]
I'ma quote an old song, that's if I might
What they used to say?  "The Freaks Come Out at Night."
Yeah, believe it's true, in fact it's a reality
Some do it for the love and some do it for the salary
Women are true and women are deceiving
Women are also, ladies of the evening
Shakin them hips softly while she's steppin
Her lovin ain't a tool, her lovin is a weapon
Time keeps tickin and the world keeps turnin
Thought I knew it all, but I'm still learnin
So fellas watch your ladies cause it's women I'm pursuin
Takin em away, no matter what you're doin
I don't play games, cause games are for fools
And when your girl picks me - you know the rules!
And when she disappears, don't even wonder if
Cause I'm tellin you now - I got her on the nightshift!

I got her workin on the nightshift
I got em workin on the nightshift

Uhh..
I got em workin on the nightshift
Ah here we go
Uhh, yeah baby c'mon
Uhh, yeah, c'mon
Uhh, a yeah baby c'mon
Check it out
C'mon[Grand Puba] Two times for the drummer, 'fore I start it I say, "Hit me!"
Puba's kickin flavor, and I brought somebody with me
[Positive K] Positive, the gentlemen, the rapper
Suave blase, you know dapper
[Grand Puba] See this is not a song about friends
Because we make the ends, and then we spread the skins
[Positive K] This song becomes a well known tune
And my mic's gonna bloom like a flower in June
[Grand Puba] We kick much flavor and you know that
As smooth as the head on a Fed named Kojak
[Positive K] Grip the mic til my hand get calloused
And I'll tell you like Ralph Kramden told Alice
"Bang zoom!"
[Grand Puba] It's up up and away
[Positive K] Grand Puba
[Grand Puba] and Positive K
[Positive K] Lyrics real sweet like candy
[Grand Puba] It's just like a condom
[Pos & Puba] WE KEEP ONE HANDY!

Go Puba, go Positive (4X)

[Positive K]
To my adversaries, I'm not ordinary
Not the Godfather, or the Tooth Fairy
Not Jack Spade or Engelbert Humperdink
Listen to this rhyme and tell us what you think

[Grand Puba]
One, two, three. Grand Puba's on the count
Rhyming gets me papes in very large amount
Brother you're wrong, if you think crime pays
Don't like gays, and take vacations off of holidays

[Positive K]
Practice safe sex to prevent strange diseases
Wear my hat, on one night skeezers
I roll dice, but don't bet on the horses
Punks take losses and I don't reveal my sources

[Grand Puba]
So umm, take the fifth if you're planning to riff
The rhymes spread like Jif to make your loose knot stiff
Kick up your feet if you're feeling kinda queasy..
Relax.. (ha ha) take it easy!

[Positive K]
You're in good hands, Positive is a survivor
I make rhymes of anything, I'm like MacGyver
If I were a computer rap would be my program
Since I'm a righteous man, I don't eat ham
I wish more people was alive like me

[Grand Puba] But Positive..
[Positive K] Whattup Max?

[Grand Puba]
See the vocab is lovely, girls be thinkin of me
Other rappers try to be me, competition can't see me
So hey, whaddya say, I got the flow y'all
If you don't know the time then you better check the Seiko
Or Timex, I suplex, get biz on the co-sex
Put em in a line then I ask, "Who's next?"
Grand Puba, guaranteed to make a big hit
Doin much damage on this two man skit
Trying to hold me back won't harm me
And when the gear gets too small it's for the Salvation Army
So mami, or mida, a way I say, "No one's sweeter!"
(Now that's funky!)
You see the style I kick is rugged, I shine like a nugget
Present tense mean you dig it, past tense mean you dug it!
So dance, to a light tune, my lit-tle doll
Da-nah-nah, da-nah-nah, da-nah-nah, dah
Rock me wit, vi-bra-tion
Give me a deep med-i-ta-tion
There is none betta than Grand Pu-ba
Baby be get it all togetha
You see the second time around I hope the label don't flake
And if they do I go to Drake and say, "Give me a break"
Like Toyota say, I say (Oh what a feeling!)
I bust the foots of Lionel Richie
I caught him dancing on MY ceiling!

[Positive K]
Pass me the mic, cause I wants to blitz
I'm the best thing that came since grits
The Prince of Rap, lookin for Cinderella
If you see her...why don't you tell her
I got the shoe, in the car out back
And if she makes the fit, she's IN, LIKE, THAT
And as a matter of fact
I'm not an actor, but the main factor
Pinpointing his rhymes like a protractor
I'm intricated, complicated
Definitely musically related
Rhymes so fly never been outdated
Gots to be fly by the way I state it
Now of myself, I say I'm a big fan
Got more rhymes, than words by the Letterman
Positive K, you can say he's low key
You might know my name but now look you don't know me
I can be nice and flip like the Son of Sam
Nobody knows exactly how I am
I'm the next and everybody knows it
Open tours this year, next year I'mma close it
I've got the skills that pays the bills, now
Here's a quote from Stephanie Mills
Don't put a rush on me cause my tempo's slow
And if I don't tell you, then how would you know?[ Positive K ]
Hey yo, who gonna start this off?
[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Positive, man, you start off, man
[ Positive K ]
Yo Lyte, won't you start it off
[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Lyte, you start it
[ MC Lyte ]
Na come on
Yo Positive, won't you start up, come on

[ all ]
Start it up y'all, start it up y'all
Sta-sta-start it up y'all
Start it up y'all, start it up y'all
Sta-sta-start it up y'all

[ Positive K ]
Well, I'm Positive
[ Milk Dee ]
Yo, and I am Milk Dee
[ Pos K & Milk Dee ]

[ MC Lyte ]
They call me Lyte Thee MC
[ Pos K & Milk Dee ]
Well, two plus one
[ Milk Dee ]
That equals three
Positive K, rip the m-i-c

[ VERSE 1: Positive K ]
Yo, here I go, there I go, where I go
I don't know, but I'ma go with the flow
You sow what you reap and you reap what you sow
(And if you don't cut your hair you get a afro)
Ah to the beat y'all (beat y'all) beat-beat y'all (beat-beat y'all)
To the funk-funky beat y'all (beat y'all)
Peace peace y'all (peace y'all) the way we greet y'all (greet y'all)
And when you undress I hope that you're neat y'all (neat y'all)
Well, I'ma start this off here simple and plain
With the title I hold, my style and my name
The title I hold is pimp slash rapper
My style (Yo, we got to say dapper)
Positive's my name, the K's in quotation
When you spell it don't forget the exclamation
Pep's in my step and my rep's beginning
Base is loaded, the bottom of the 9th inning
(Will you make a grand slam? (Yo, will it be a base hit?)
Yo, whatever you do, you gonna have to face it
I'm short and stocky, I hit like Rocky
Don't you call me Rocky cause no one can rock me
Yes, I'm single, I love to mingle
(Rappers bite you) just like a Pringle
Or maybe a Manwich, maybe a Snicker
(Cause you kick a rhyme doesn't make you a kicker)
Well, if I was DJ would I play
Someone's records strictly for the pay?
Like that y'all (that y'all) like that y'all (like y'all)
Positive K don't smoke no crack y'all (crack y'all)
That's how it is y'all (is y'all) that's how it is y'all (is y'all)
You can ask my main man Giz y'all (Giz y'all)

[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Pos
[ Pos K ]
Yo Milk

Let me tell ya, let me tell ya
[ Pos K ]
I'm the Positive K (y'all)
[ MC Lyte ]
MC Lyte
[ Milk Dee ]
And I'm the Milk Dee y'all

[ VERSE 2: Milk Dee ]
Well, I'm the M (the M) the i (the i) the l (the l) the k (what you say?)
I said I came here to save the day
Take you up and down like a rollercoaster
Call me a bragger cause I'm a boaster
MC's say I'm an MC toaster
I paid my dues, I don't rap the blues
You pick and choose but I headline the news
A girl got knocked up and said I hit it
(You did it, you did it) (He did it) (You did it)
Yo, I mighta did it but I wouldn't admit it
(Ah come on Milk Dee, quit it)
Yo, I'll quit it but I won't stop it
I wanna drop it, here's another topic
Scores of hoes chillin on the ave
Jealous of the Milk cause of what I have
I keep pretty girls always by my side
Take em for a ride so they'll abide
But if I don't comb my hair I don't care
I grab my hat, yo believe it's like that
I ( ? ) she thought I was a capper
I slapped her (he slapped her) for bein dumb
You know Brooklyn, Brooklyn is where I'm from
But since I'm here I'm gonna drop a dime
(So what's up with Hammer?) Yo, Hammer can't rhyme
And .357 is a bunch of hoes
You can ask Giz (Gizmo knows)
Yo, I gets papers, that's my habit
Like Nola D in (_She's Gotta Have It_)
Yo, I'm so thick that I can't stand it
Let's get candid, I'm the love bandit
They say I'm swingin cause I'm a swinger
But yo, I don't sing cause I ain't no singer
Your girl is clingin cause she's a clinger
Clingin to my pocket because I rocked it
They all say how (how) how does he clock it?
All of the money, they think it's funny
I'm turnin cloudy days into sunny ones
It's all about the funds
Yes yes y'all (yes y'all) yes yes y'all (yes y'all)
Milk-Milk Dee use Crest y'all (Crest y'all)
Like that y'all (that y'all) like that y'all (like y'all)
So-so goddamn fat y'all (fat y'all)

[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Lyte
[ MC Lyte ]
Yo Milk
[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Pos
[ Pos K ]
Yo Lyte
[ all ]
Here's a story about the three
[ Milk Dee ]
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya
I'm M-i-l-l
[ Pos K ]
I'm the Positive K and
[ MC Lyte ]
And Lyte Thee MC

[ VERSE 3: MC Lyte ]
Like that y'all (that y'all) like that y'all (that y'all)
Positive and Milk they got my back y'all (back y'all)
No doubt y'all (doubt y'all) no doubt y'all (doubt y'all)
My lights will never go out y'all (out y'all)
Now it's time to kick this rhyme kinda freely
German, Russian, even Suaheli
You'll understand the rhyme translated
You know that the Lyte is never ever underestimated
I cast a spell like _I Dream of Jeannie_
Fellas wanna see me rock a bikini (oooh...)
Hit a note just like Aretha
I'm the female (female rhyme teacher)
Each and every time the rhyme gets doper
Lyte get a talk show just like Oprah
With my ability and my agility
Will only equal up (to versatility)
A tisket, a tasket, fuck a yellow basket
(Can you rock a mic, Lyte?) How can you ask it?
I flow like a river, just like a stream
I'm like the dope (the dope for a dopefiend)
I move like the pawn, better yet the queen
Stay check-mate, you know what I mean?
I go (boom-boom) like an Alpine speaker
I go (beep-beep) like a Motorola beeper
Talk about deep, well let's get deeper
Breakin it down to the very last compound
(That's how she's livin, that's how she's livin)
"Slave to the Rhythm", that's what I'm givin

LG rocks it on and
Trooper [Name] rocks it on and
Gizmo rocks it on and
King Of Chill rocks it on and
K-Rock rocks it on and
Master T rocks it on and
[Name] rocks it on
Tito rocks it on and
Aftershock rocks it on and
[Name] rocks it on and
Leg 1 rocks it on and
Leg 2 rocks it on and

[ Pos K ]
Yo and we don't stop, keepin it on
Where where to the break break
To the break break
Till crackheads are gone
We outta hereYes, this song, will serve as the proof
That in the midst of everything so negative
There's always something -- Positive

I said yeah, ah come on
I said yeah, uh, come on
I said yeah, uh, come on
I said yeah, ah come on

I got a Brooklyn honey and she don't want me for my money
Laughs at all my jokes, especially when it's not funny
And I confess that I'm her all true man
She got a fly hairdo, little trinkets on her hands
Her ears is pierced, and in them diamond chunks
My rhymes is fierce, so won't you back up off her punks
Junk in her trunk, so I know the brothers sweat her
But that's OK, cause I know she know better
More cakes than Drake's and more things than Ring Dings
It ain't no need to try to gas her to swing
She's not impressed, by your fancy car
She got a body so she's snotty and she don't care who you are
So don't get mad and diss her reputation
Callin her a floozy, any conversation
Mad grammar backstabber, girls they wanna be her
But like Stevie Wonder, none of y'all can see her!
So when your fellas turn, just learn to keep lookin
Cause I got me a flower, that grows in Brooklyn

That grows in Brooklyn

Walkin down the street, fellas go by watchin her sayin
"Hey baby.." -] Sadat X
"Hey baby.." -] Sadat X
"Boom, the bip, the boom bip.." -] Q-Tip
Here's a little quote, from Anita Baker
Give the best to God, so won't you move with the shaker
I come back like a boomerang-ah
Make women wind, like a zoom to zang-ah
You fellas wanna know if I can hang? Yeah, yeah
All you ladies wanna know if I can hang? Owwwwwww
I rips the show I gets the dough I licks you low I let you know
That times have passed that fast -- dere it go!
I see your girl, I know she right
I run that Johnny Gill line and say, "You sho' look good tonight"
But alas, that's the past, I'm not hookin
I got me a flower, that grows in Brooklyn

That grows in Brooklyn

Walkin down the street, fellas go by watchin her sayin
"Hey baby.." -] Sadat X
"Hey baby.." -] Sadat X
"ya, y'know, ya ya y'know.." -] ?
Brothers in the neighborhood don't like my style
They don't likes the way I walk, they don't like my smile
But when I go see her they don't try to play me though
They give me a pound and say, "We know you from the video
"And by the way, do you live on Canarsie?"
Nah, but much respect to the Brooklyn posse
I step to the rear, cause I don't want no beef baloney
They might know my name, but now look, they don't know me
Nots to worry, cause the kid is thorough
Prepared for riffin any town street or borough
Cause you know, there's a Brooklyn wherever you go
And every girl, there's a flower that's dyin to grow
So when I'm town, you know I'm at her hut
Loungin like a Band-Aid, in the cut
And when I get dat feelin, uhh!
Legs hit the air, footprints get left on the ceiling
She came a tight end, and she left a wide receiver
I make white girls a believer ever since the Jungle Fever
I came a long way to say she's taken tooken
And that's why she's my flower, that grows in Brooklyn

That grows in Brooklyn

Walkin down the street, fellas go by watchin her sayin
"Hey baby.." -] Sadat X
"Hey baby.." -] Sadat X

Oh yeah, come on
Uhh, I said yeah, ah come on
Uhh, I said yeah, ah come on
Uhh, I said yeah, ah come on
I said yeah, ah come on, uhh
I said yeah, ah come on, uhh

Swing it over here yo
Swing it over here yo
Swing it over here yo
Swing it over here yo
Swing it over here yo
Swing it over here yo (Uh)
Yeah swing it over here yo
Swing it over here yo

[Verse 1: Positive K]
Don’t tell me what I’m not
Just because I drops it like it’s hot
I get what I get, and I got what I got
For thinking fast, right here on the spot (Uh)
I’m spontaneous wit a ho in my radius (yeah)
You got a girl, buy my tape and play her this
Watch which way she’ll sway
And I bet she’s gonna say OWWW, Pos K
So don’t pause, panic, or get picky
I’ll make ya girlfriend’s panties sticky
And she’ll wanna get with the dapper
A rapper, I got no choice but to tap her
So let her know who the [?] the big barracuda
That’s like a Lexus to a scooter (Uh)
So ease off, come down [?]
I remain like a freckle, transform like Jekyll
I’m being bad yo, making mad dough, pulling off slow (Uh)
In a Volvo
Pos K’s imperial
Brothers wanna be smooth but can’t find my material (shhhh)
Understand I’m good with mine
And when you realize that, everything’ll be fine

[Hook: Positive K]
Ain’t no crime, on the way I’m gettin mine
It ain’t no crime, it ain’t no crime
It ain’t no crime, on the way I’m gettin mine
It ain’t no crime, it ain’t no crime

[Verse 2: Positive K]
On the nightshift, a lot of ladies was offended
But being offended wasn’t what I intended
Pos K raps on, what’s real, rappin on what’s real (yeah, yeah)
Gives me that street feel
A in a borough in a city near the city
I can’t have the Doo-Wop, without the ditty (what)
I got the skills to pay those
And if ya got beef, I suggest, you better raise those (Uh)
But tell me can you take it
Ya have better luck a bungie jumping butt naked (shhhh)
I’m gettin loot in 52 cities and hanging hard
See here, like your grandmom’s titties
Tell it like it is and like it isn’t
No girl is gonna lock me up as if I was in prison (Uh)
‘Cause I’m a batchelor, my doctor says I’m fertile
Running through girls like Carl Lewis does the hurdles (mm)
Ladies know my forté, plus I [?] foreplay
When I go too far they say, that’s okay
‘Cause I’m the Positive, but, girls, they call me Pozzy
We can go together just like Harriett and Ozzie
Eff matrimony! That’s B, baloney
Picture me settling down with a wife!
Nah that don’t even sound right (nah)
But my motto is, a pimp or die
Come on now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Positive K]
Honeys in my face just like a booger (like a booger)
I say slow down, low down, and don’t you play yourself, sugar (Uh)
I don’t like girls who act like such
Talking about take me out to dinner (but what)
Nah we’re goin’ Dutch
Uh, then I think and realize that it sums up (Uh-huh)
‘Cause when I bust off, I clog honeys gums up (Uh-huh)
That’s why she calls me Sir Spermalot
Cause when I make love, I make her squeal, and she squirms a lot
So don’t ask, is he nasty or has he
Uh baby, don’t put none a that past me
Cause I’m the man with the power
If being fly was a minute, well I’m a motherfucking hour (shit)
Now don’t do like I say so (Uh-huh)
And you’ll get eaten like a dish called Rapper Alfredo
In the quickness you’re getting sparked
You do so much as [?] blink
And you can die in the dark
I hear dem talking, but I don’t know what dem tinkin’
I hear dem talking, but I don’t know what dem tin kin’
This ain’t a song about me being fly
It’s a song about me, myself, and I
You know this I
Persist, and refuse to get jammed
People try to [?] flam, but every song that I make slam
Like Abe Lincoln, they wanna see me dead, stinkin'
I’m not sinkin', so [?] how ya thinkin'
I’m rising, rising at a rapid rate
And at my weight, I’m gonna wax the whole damn state
And every step I take
It’s a step in the struggle
And everything I got, ay yo I got it on the juggle
Nobody gave me nothing see I fought my way
That’s why I’m proud to say that I’m the Positive K (that’s right)
From Robin Givens down to Michael Bivins
What I’m saying is, everybody gotta make a living
Come on

[Hook]

Swing it over here yo
Swing it over here yo
Swing it over here yo
It ain’t no crime…Uhh.. hey!

And they'll turn like you got the virus
Cause you didn't have a car, or the one had there wasn't flyest
But for the record I'm not trickin
But you can call me Timex, cause I'll still take the lickin
So if you're hot and bothered, or in a frenzy
I'll pop _The Mack_ soundtrack in the Benzy
And you can tell me how you choose me baby
Baby, this no time for you, to act crazy
You can't play me, not like Play-Doh
Don't leave me for the kid honey, in the Laredo (speak on it)
But if you gots to go, you gotta go, I can't stop her
That's the lifestyles of the carhoppers

Showstopper, yeah the profiteerer

Dare, if you wanna get with this here
Put on your best gear, and step to the rear

The next man's gooseneck and suckin his exhaust pipe
She's got him and he's got an erection
Just because of his fuel injection, system
All before yeah she used to diss him
Now she knows money on down to his pistons
And his engine, or let's say his chassis
Just blow your horn and she'd run like Lassie
Or better yet, she'd flip like Kujo
If you got a Jag, or a Porsche Turbo (once again, break it down)
They got more promises than Thomases
And I think they better go and call, Hoppers Anonymous
But I know, where to send em
Ah to the Hyundai dealer to gets the Benz emblem

[Beav]	Yeah eh-hehe, and then he says "this"

[Positive K]
You gotta hug her tighter than a pair of Sassoons
And Butt-head then you be pullin in girls, like a vacumn
And you'll say I kiss you from your toes up to your cerebellum
(B: From your toes to your what?)
When you're alone, this is what you tell em

* {Positive K - singing}  (Butt-head - following along)

{All my life I've been} (Uhh.. all my life)

[L]Yeah sounds good, but guys like you just wanna hit and run
Look, we're not the two, and I'm not the one
So if ya got some thought of taking me to bed
Kill that! And get a five dollar crack-head
[P]But I'm all the way live, but I'm definitely not crabbing
[L]There are just certain things I'm just not having

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
[P]I think you try to diss me or play me like I'm cooly
[L]No, matter of fact love, I think that you're a cuty
There's just certain things you don't understand baby:
Every woman wants to be treated like a lady
[P]So what? You want me to kick it as if I'm a doc?
[L]Listen to what I'm saying and shut ...
I'm just tryna put it, so I can make something happen
You just turned me off by the way that you was gabbling
[P]Look I'm all the way live and I'm definitely not crabbing
A bit of change for a woman, that's what I'm not having

[Bridge]
[L]I keep feelings inside, I know who I am
[P]Step to yourself, cause I don't wanna hear it
[L]I keep feelings inside, I know who I am
[P]You're not getting younger, you're just getting older

[Verse 4]
[L]What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lots of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
Friend. I'm never gonna fall in love again
But getting back to the topic of convo
In my book hone, you are a no-no
[P]C'mon I'm clean, cut, and dabber, you got to admit that
I don't sell drugs and I ain't with the wack track
I'm cool and calm, my phone is mine
You don't see me snatching taste, and acting wild
Excuse me miss, I think you better get with this
[L]Scan it damn, cause I'm simply not having it

[Hook]Yeah, drop it like it's hot kid
Huh, so let's set this off
Uhh - c'mon (yeah baby c'mon)
Uhh, yeah baby c'mon (yeah baby c'mon)
Uhh, yeah baby c'mon (yeah baby c'mon)
Uhh, yeah baby c'mon (YEAH BABY C'MON, kick it)

[Verse One]
Minnie the Moocher, bad hoochie-coocher
Innocent sweet but the girl might shoot ya
In your back, because she moves like dat
So let me run it to your tapes, microphone yo contact
Minnie used to be a fly girl (fly girl)
By the way, she used to be my girl (my girl)
But now she's a floozie and got a, kid with an Uzi
And the question I asked her was why girl (why girl)
Now you can call this freak a good looker (yeah)
Or you can call the (ho) a good hooker
But a guy came by with a (dick) that was bigger than mine
And guess what he took her - come down!

[Hook]
Minnie de moocha, minnie de moocha
Minnie de moocha she a bad oochie coo-cha
Ya don't know 'er, I and I introduce ya
(?)sha pask(?) here come fling-da-ding, what I know

[Verse Two]
For this girl I was lost in the sauce and had to pay the cost
In order to be the boss
I was on it but knew how she was livin
And every time I seen her it seems that I was driven
Posess will posess you like +The Exorcist+
She was, so bad the devil's son-in-law he couldn't even resist
It was said in the bed she was wicked
Married men - they couldn't help but stop and kick it
Fellas passin her was harassin her
"You got a man," they was frequently askin her
And she loved that, stone to the bone
And wouldn't give it up, not even for a happy home
Not for a man and a family
But every Friday night, they was bettin that she was sure to be
At your local discotheque
Dancin dirty, uhh, and workin up a sweat
The neighborhood heart breaker
And once you made her yours, the next man would come and take her
Away to the Casbah
Because you didn't have it goin on, up to par
I'm a million dollar man but I'm not Steve Austin
You can take the cake but what's the cake without frostin
Success ain't nothin without someone to share it with
Except a girl with a Robin Givens starter kit
She did it hit it and quit it and now she's gone
See ya! But ya know I know

[Hook - *patois chat here may be wrong*]
Minnie de moocha, minnie de moocha
Minnie de moocha she a bad oochie coo-cha
This is a gyal who won't no keep one lover
She no care fi no guy (??) (??) and don't want no
(?) pocket man you haffi have sold a lot
Crisp Benz wha you drivin a Path-finder
You haffi, live de life of a big-timer (and what else)
Minnie de moocha not ga deal witcha, come down

[Verse Three]
She knew a guy named Smokey (Smokey)
She loved him a lot, because he used to buy her coke see {*sniff*}
Yeah gram after gram (mmm)
She kinda remind me of this girl named Pam
But Minnie looked much better
To top it off, she had a ninety-two Jetta
Now that's a girl who love to ball
She didn't want a lot of things cause hey, she wanted it all
Him, him and him
Yeah the guy with the Benz and the five-star rims
She had a million dollars in nickels and dimes
And sat around and counted 'em all a million times
She was tall, fly, and skinny
And if you don't know I'm talkin bout Minnie the Moocher

[Hook]
Minnie de moocha, minnie de moocha
Minnie de moocha she a bad oochie coo-cha
Minnie de moocha, minnie de moocha
Ya don't know 'er, I and I introduce ya

[*more patois that may be wrong*]
Listen me (?), and in me rasta
Long time dis ya gal I and I a check for
But when they, turn me back she run go with me brudda

Want me, fetch the ras me want fi go look for ya
An' lick a hole inna ya head a with me millimeter
She don't want no, (?) pocket man she want a big spenda

(Positive, Positive, oooooh, another hit baby)
(Positive, Positive, oooooh, another hit baby)"You talkin just like a pimp!"

"You see pimpin's big business
And it's been goin on since the beginning of time
And it's gonna continue STRAIGHT AHEAD
Til somebody up there turns out the lights on this small planet."

[Positive K]
Allow me to propose a toast..

Allow me to propose a toast
From the Pos and not the ??
In this event I've come to swing
Bust a move, present a crown for the king
The true black mack with a knack to attract a stack
Girls attack, I spin dem out like crack
I say, "Cupid, draw back your bow, let your arrow flow
And yo.. hit the ho!"
So let me work my maneuver
There's none smoother, so you know that I'ma soothe her
And uhh, when I start to shoot the gift
The next day, I got you workin on the nightshift

I got you workin on the nightshift
I got you workin on the nightshift

[Big Daddy Kane]
That's right Pos baby
You gotta school these young macks comin up today y'know
I mean to be 'frank', they just hot dogs
The girls are relish, and they need to ketch-up on they pimpin

[Positive K]
Positive!  Oh yes, the fly pimp
I do my thing but I would never attempt
To brag or boast, to try to say that I'm the baddest
When it comes to this, [bitches] know my status
Ridin with Kane in a Mercedes
Flashin high-beams, amongst all the young ladies
They step up askin me to get in
But you know my motto: no skins, no Benz (heh)
I give the kiss of death, just like Blackula
Before you know it, I'm like a mack to her
One whiff of the gap shot swift
And quit your day job, cause now you're on the nightshift

I got you workin on the nightshift
I got you workin on the nightshift

[Big Daddy Kane]
Check it out, I go by the name of..
Well for the time being let's just call me 50 Grand
Because umm.. heheh
There's 50 states and I G'd in each one of them
Heh, kick it baby

[Positive K]
I'm what you'd call a smooth microphone controller
My lifestyle's like suave bola
Keep my hair in a cameo, gettin gas from Amoco
The only thing I'm sniffin is your girlfriend pantyhose
*inhales*  *exhales*  Another hit baby!
And if you find that kinky
Put some barbeque sauce on the tip of my pinky
Watch me get freaky like a nymphomaniac
And exotic, an erotic tour with the mack
No I'm no one to be played with
(Kane: Auditions at 12 baby) for the nightshift

I got you workin on the nightshift
I got you workin on the nightshift

I got you workin on the nightshift

[Big Daddy Kane]
Man, you got to work your women by the scale
I mean if she's skinny, make her bring you home a good penny
And if she fat, make her pay like she weigh
Hmm, come again now

[Positive K]
I'ma quote an old song, that's if I might
What they used to say?  "The Freaks Come Out at Night."
Yeah, believe it's true, in fact it's a reality
Some do it for the love and some do it for the salary
Women are true and women are deceiving
Women are also, ladies of the evening
Shakin them hips softly while she's steppin
Her lovin ain't a tool, her lovin is a weapon
Time keeps tickin and the world keeps turnin
Thought I knew it all, but I'm still learnin
So fellas watch your ladies cause it's women I'm pursuin
Takin em away, no matter what you're doin
I don't play games, cause games are for fools
And when your girl picks me - you know the rules!
And when she disappears, don't even wonder if
Cause I'm tellin you now - I got her on the nightshift!

I got her workin on the nightshift
I got em workin on the nightshift

Uhh..
I got em workin on the nightshift
Ah here we go
Uhh, yeah baby c'mon
Uhh, yeah, c'mon
Uhh, a yeah baby c'mon
Check it out
C'mon"You're on the air"
"Positive and L.G."
"That's that you know that really sounds
That that sounds uhh provacative"

[Positive K]
Jump jump Jump Jump JUMP JUMP JUMP! JUMP!
Jump up and down and yo get excited (uh, yeah)
Positive K, L.G. reunited (step up)
Got a Phillie blunt, now don't ya dare light it (uh, c'mon)
This is my rhyme and I'm gonna recite it
First up to bat, Pos K the party wrecker
Got more moves than an effin game of checkers
Askin if I'm nice with mine, don't say sorta
I can sell an Eskimo a glass of cold water
It ain't no doubt you get knocked in ya mouth
Be the eighth MC, that Rakim didn't talk about
All types of Positive, that's what the girls say
Grown damn man, got no time for child's play
Scoop your daughter, be scared you oughta
I'm so bad, that I can rob a drip of water
I'm a new breed far from a young seed
Like a Boy Scout daily do my good deed
The rhyme was speed but like a turtle be movin
I'm slow and funky in other words - I be groovin!
Cause I'm the master, quenchin your thirst just like a Shasta
Because he wanna - no, say because he HAS ta
I satisfy, get 'em high just like a spanish fly
Once and for all, let me tell you who the eff am I
Cause I'm the man, from here to Afghanistan
Cambodia, even Iran
But I never ran, and matter of fact I never tried it
In a contest me fess, man you just the next man, got it?
Good, he didn't know I coulda woulda shoulda meant
And if he coulda, I think I he woulda shoulda went
If I didn't tell ya, then how would you know?
Positive K's not your ordinary Joe
I slay the dragon and freak the evil king;
Scoop the princess, put her under my wing
Make her sing a song sayin, "What a relief it is"
If that ain't flavor - pssh - what is?

{*"In comes the one"*} One to the head y'all
{*"In comes the one"*} One to the head y'all
{*"In comes the one"*} Uhh one to the head y'all yeah c'mon
{*"In comes the one"*} Uhh one to the head y'all
{*"In comes the one"*} Uhh one to the head y'all
{*"In comes the one"*} One to the head y'all
{*"In comes the one"*} One to the head y'all
{*"In comes the one, the one"*}

Ladies look at me as a man of leisure
Cause I can do the things that can definitely please her
Brothers like to scramble, hustle, gamble
Women take the skin when I got a hell of a handle
A chip off the block cause my daddy was a player
Other words, hon, that means you don't have a prayer
I gots the gift of tongue, the thing's from a cobra;
If I kick it to ya baby, it's all over
Been around the world and my style nobody's fazin' it
Cause I'm sweet, sweeter than a Raisinette
But on the other hand I'm hotter than Tabasco
You rhyme first and I'll be the last to go
I might win, lose or even draw
But it ain't nuttin that I ain't never seen before
The only thing is yo, I never lost it
All I did was reinforce it
Now I'm sturdy, sturdy as a girder
Versatile with capabilities of murder
Protectin my honor as if I was a samurai
"Oh my back!" is the sounds when I slam a guy
I'm not above comedy and playin
That's just my simple way, of sayin

Uhh, a-like that y'all one to the head
Uhh, like that y'all one to the head
Uhh, like that y'all one to the head yup
A-like that y'all one to the head y'all
Uh like that, uh like that
Uh to the head y'all one to the head y'all
A-like that y'all, one to the head y'all
A-like that y'all

I'm gonna drop this rhyme! (3x)
I hope it does skyrocket
If it does I'll be paid in my pockets
With fly things like Rolex watches and
Fur minks and diamond links
You see I got over the hump, bumped a lot of chumps
Just like the mumps my pockets got lumps
On the contrary, as a kid I was seein every
Santa Claus didn't bring me things I wanted him to carry
Like a, mansion and yacht, a big fat knot
A girl with a Benz who love me a lot
Nevertheless there's things about me that you probably would never know
Datin back, to when I was just an embryo
But that's a theory matter of fact a hypothesis
Coming from the abdomen directly to the esophagus
Protect myself against mishaps and tragedies
Against backstabbers, faggot MC's I didn't leave
So welcome me back, as if I'm Kotter
For starters I'm gettin more points than the Harlem Globetrotters
Not flexin or vexin, I'm a man who's modest
And when I speak, I just likes to be honest
Some say how I got famous this quick:
Cause I'm original like Kentucky Fried Chicken and the biscuit
Loop your beats and save it on the diskette
For girls in the mini-skirts and the fishnets
High heel pumps and their hair all done up
I see 'em like that, I can't help but run up
Kick the gab and throw 'em in the limo
Take 'em to the crib just to make a little demo

Uhh, one to the head, one to the head
One to the head, one to the head
One to the head, one to the head
One to the head, one to the head y'allYeah.. uhh, check it right

[Positive K]
Now it's your friends you gotta worry about, to say the least
Cause man, they're stickin to ya kid without the grease
Runnin game in the name of fame
Or talkin about every nice little thing for ya that they've done
And they've done nuttin now too late you learn
Cause all they wanted was uhh, somethin in return
That's a flam and a scam, you can tell I ain't gas it
Bite a check on my rep, and then later, try to cash it
But I got more bounce to the ounce, what I'm sayin
Seven and a half ounces, braincells, on the way in
Cause momma ain't raised none, I ain't changed none
I got work in my work and it stays done
A man twenty-three years yes I've grown
And I've learned that I can do bad on my own
I don't need a friend cause, I've got a brand new car
All cause I'm a, hot new rap star
Maybe cause my bank account is so profound
And since you're my friend, I gotta put you down
Anyway I know clout, only respects clout
And it's your friends kid, you got to worry about

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
It's your friends, oh yea your friends, YOU GOTTA WORRY ABOUT

[Positive K]
A let me tell you let me tell you who your friends are
Your friends ride around, in your new car
They ask for dough when they know you just got dough
They call your house every minute on the hour yo
Talkin bout - let's hang - you don't wanna hang
You wanna go wild maybe do your own thang
But they get mad, and they sweat that
Cause what ya got man they know they can't get that
And they don't take no for an answer either
They wanna see you drivin round like you're Alex Rega
But you can't see, you're not a +Taxi+
That bring girls around when they know you got a main G
Cause that's the person that you spend time with
And spend the time with, it does not combine with
What they wanna do, and what they wanna do
Is hang and if you can't somethin gotta be wrong with you
So tell me why a woman takes a man hand
And tells him things, that makes him feel grand
Large and (?) you're my knight in shining armor
Known this woman, from a soap opera drama
Weak in wickedness I know how you kick it miss
I know you're gonna say who's gonna pay before he's stickin this
Now you're caught without a thought, no need to pretend
Who hooked you up with this girl huh, a friend
No one wants to be around when you're down and out
Cause it's your friends kid, you gotta worry about

[Chorus]

[Positive K]
A nevertheless I, don't like to stress abouts I
Likes to take it easy, do my job, dat's why
My so-called friends, I grew up with
Either fell off, smoked out, or just ain't shit
And the rest I just don't like
And if I see him again, I swear we're gonna fight
But I'm a cool brother, thanks to my mother
And a friend, I really don't need another
But I got peeps, peeps that's true
And on my record - I'm singin all praises due
Just for givin 'em each day, I'm livin on that
To the babies I got to put the Positive in 'em
Cause I'm a loner and known to entrepeneur
And I'm sure you see more..
Whoever made up, the word friendship?
They need to get beat, up with a slave whip
Because they never knew, of what a friend would do
Cause when you're down and out, they never helpin you
They always lead you on, and they sing a song
And when you need 'em somethin's always goin wrong
They said I'm broke yo, I'm on welfare
I didn't have dough, I couldn't get there
My mom is sick, my sis is pregnant
My father's drunk, my house is hectic
And then they flip the script and say I need a quick G
Or couldn't you spare a beat?  C'mon, this is me
You know you'll get it back, aiyyo yea that's a fact
I've already lost a job, and plus be smokin that
Off with you give the dough, cause youse a true friend
But what ya know now if you only knew then
He wouldn'ta got jacked, for the big smack
And it's only right, because it's like that

[Chorus] + ad libs

"That's when you find out who your REAL friends are!"Peace, to a man name Heavy D

As a person, he's one of the coolest..
People you'd even wanna get to know
Youknowmsayin, every time Heavy D comes out
It's a whole different level, he never stays on one side
He's one of the most unpredictable emcees, in hip-hop history

The hardcore rappers that's out there right now
We love you from Naughty, Heavy, and we out

Hoping that this album, is as fat, as yourself
No pun intended
So... let's go![Grand Puba] Two times for the drummer, 'fore I start it I say, "Hit me!"
Puba's kickin flavor, and I brought somebody with me
[Positive K] Positive, the gentlemen, the rapper
Suave blase, you know dapper
[Grand Puba] See this is not a song about friends
Because we make the ends, and then we spread the skins
[Positive K] This song becomes a well known tune
And my mic's gonna bloom like a flower in June
[Grand Puba] We kick much flavor and you know that
As smooth as the head on a Fed named Kojak
[Positive K] Grip the mic til my hand get calloused
And I'll tell you like Ralph Kramden told Alice
"Bang zoom!"
[Grand Puba] It's up up and away
[Positive K] Grand Puba
[Grand Puba] and Positive K
[Positive K] Lyrics real sweet like candy
[Grand Puba] It's just like a condom
[Pos & Puba] WE KEEP ONE HANDY!

Go Puba, go Positive (4X)

[Positive K]
To my adversaries, I'm not ordinary
Not the Godfather, or the Tooth Fairy
Not Jack Spade or Engelbert Humperdink
Listen to this rhyme and tell us what you think

[Grand Puba]
One, two, three. Grand Puba's on the count
Rhyming gets me papes in very large amount
Brother you're wrong, if you think crime pays
Don't like gays, and take vacations off of holidays

[Positive K]
Practice safe sex to prevent strange diseases
Wear my hat, on one night skeezers
I roll dice, but don't bet on the horses
Punks take losses and I don't reveal my sources

[Grand Puba]
So umm, take the fifth if you're planning to riff
The rhymes spread like Jif to make your loose knot stiff
Kick up your feet if you're feeling kinda queasy..
Relax.. (ha ha) take it easy!

[Positive K]
You're in good hands, Positive is a survivor
I make rhymes of anything, I'm like MacGyver
If I were a computer rap would be my program
Since I'm a righteous man, I don't eat ham
I wish more people was alive like me

[Grand Puba] But Positive..
[Positive K] Whattup Max?

[Grand Puba]
See the vocab is lovely, girls be thinkin of me
Other rappers try to be me, competition can't see me
So hey, whaddya say, I got the flow y'all
If you don't know the time then you better check the Seiko
Or Timex, I suplex, get biz on the co-sex
Put em in a line then I ask, "Who's next?"
Grand Puba, guaranteed to make a big hit
Doin much damage on this two man skit
Trying to hold me back won't harm me
And when the gear gets too small it's for the Salvation Army
So mami, or mida, a way I say, "No one's sweeter!"
(Now that's funky!)
You see the style I kick is rugged, I shine like a nugget
Present tense mean you dig it, past tense mean you dug it!
So dance, to a light tune, my lit-tle doll
Da-nah-nah, da-nah-nah, da-nah-nah, dah
Rock me wit, vi-bra-tion
Give me a deep med-i-ta-tion
There is none betta than Grand Pu-ba
Baby be get it all togetha
You see the second time around I hope the label don't flake
And if they do I go to Drake and say, "Give me a break"
Like Toyota say, I say (Oh what a feeling!)
I bust the foots of Lionel Richie
I caught him dancing on MY ceiling!

[Positive K]
Pass me the mic, cause I wants to blitz
I'm the best thing that came since grits
The Prince of Rap, lookin for Cinderella
If you see her...why don't you tell her
I got the shoe, in the car out back
And if she makes the fit, she's IN, LIKE, THAT
And as a matter of fact
I'm not an actor, but the main factor
Pinpointing his rhymes like a protractor
I'm intricated, complicated
Definitely musically related
Rhymes so fly never been outdated
Gots to be fly by the way I state it
Now of myself, I say I'm a big fan
Got more rhymes, than words by the Letterman
Positive K, you can say he's low key
You might know my name but now look you don't know me
I can be nice and flip like the Son of Sam
Nobody knows exactly how I am
I'm the next and everybody knows it
Open tours this year, next year I'mma close it
I've got the skills that pays the bills, now
Here's a quote from Stephanie Mills
Don't put a rush on me cause my tempo's slow
And if I don't tell you, then how would you know?[ Positive K ]
Hey yo, who gonna start this off?
[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Positive, man, you start off, man
[ Positive K ]
Yo Lyte, won't you start it off
[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Lyte, you start it
[ MC Lyte ]
Na come on
Yo Positive, won't you start up, come on

[ all ]
Start it up y'all, start it up y'all
Sta-sta-start it up y'all
Start it up y'all, start it up y'all
Sta-sta-start it up y'all

[ Positive K ]
Well, I'm Positive
[ Milk Dee ]
Yo, and I am Milk Dee
[ Pos K & Milk Dee ]
What's your name, girl?
[ MC Lyte ]
They call me Lyte Thee MC
[ Pos K & Milk Dee ]
Well, two plus one
[ Milk Dee ]
That equals three
Positive K, rip the m-i-c

[ VERSE 1: Positive K ]
Yo, here I go, there I go, where I go
I don't know, but I'ma go with the flow
You sow what you reap and you reap what you sow
(And if you don't cut your hair you get a afro)
Ah to the beat y'all (beat y'all) beat-beat y'all (beat-beat y'all)
To the funk-funky beat y'all (beat y'all)
Peace peace y'all (peace y'all) the way we greet y'all (greet y'all)
And when you undress I hope that you're neat y'all (neat y'all)
Well, I'ma start this off here simple and plain
With the title I hold, my style and my name
The title I hold is pimp slash rapper
My style (Yo, we got to say dapper)
Positive's my name, the K's in quotation
When you spell it don't forget the exclamation
Pep's in my step and my rep's beginning
Base is loaded, the bottom of the 9th inning
(Will you make a grand slam? (Yo, will it be a base hit?)
Yo, whatever you do, you gonna have to face it
I'm short and stocky, I hit like Rocky
Don't you call me Rocky cause no one can rock me
Yes, I'm single, I love to mingle
(Rappers bite you) just like a Pringle
Or maybe a Manwich, maybe a Snicker
(Cause you kick a rhyme doesn't make you a kicker)
Well, if I was DJ would I play
Someone's records strictly for the pay?
Like that y'all (that y'all) like that y'all (like y'all)
Positive K don't smoke no crack y'all (crack y'all)
That's how it is y'all (is y'all) that's how it is y'all (is y'all)
You can ask my main man Giz y'all (Giz y'all)

[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Pos
[ Pos K ]
Yo Milk
[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Lyte
[ MC Lyte ]

Here's a story about the three
[ Milk Dee ]
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya
[ Pos K ]
I'm the Positive K (y'all)
[ MC Lyte ]
MC Lyte
[ Milk Dee ]
And I'm the Milk Dee y'all

[ VERSE 2: Milk Dee ]
Well, I'm the M (the M) the i (the i) the l (the l) the k (what you say?)
I said I came here to save the day
Take you up and down like a rollercoaster
Call me a bragger cause I'm a boaster
MC's say I'm an MC toaster
I paid my dues, I don't rap the blues
You pick and choose but I headline the news
A girl got knocked up and said I hit it
(You did it, you did it) (He did it) (You did it)
Yo, I mighta did it but I wouldn't admit it
(Ah come on Milk Dee, quit it)
Yo, I'll quit it but I won't stop it
I wanna drop it, here's another topic
Scores of hoes chillin on the ave
Jealous of the Milk cause of what I have
I keep pretty girls always by my side
Take em for a ride so they'll abide
But if I don't comb my hair I don't care
I grab my hat, yo believe it's like that
I ( ? ) she thought I was a capper
I slapped her (he slapped her) for bein dumb
You know Brooklyn, Brooklyn is where I'm from
But since I'm here I'm gonna drop a dime
(So what's up with Hammer?) Yo, Hammer can't rhyme
And .357 is a bunch of hoes
You can ask Giz (Gizmo knows)
Yo, I gets papers, that's my habit
Like Nola D in (_She's Gotta Have It_)
Yo, I'm so thick that I can't stand it
Let's get candid, I'm the love bandit
They say I'm swingin cause I'm a swinger
But yo, I don't sing cause I ain't no singer
Your girl is clingin cause she's a clinger
Clingin to my pocket because I rocked it
They all say how (how) how does he clock it?
All of the money, they think it's funny
I'm turnin cloudy days into sunny ones
It's all about the funds
Yes yes y'all (yes y'all) yes yes y'all (yes y'all)
Milk-Milk Dee use Crest y'all (Crest y'all)
Like that y'all (that y'all) like that y'all (like y'all)
So-so goddamn fat y'all (fat y'all)

[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Lyte
[ MC Lyte ]
Yo Milk
[ Milk Dee ]
Yo Pos
[ Pos K ]
Yo Lyte
[ all ]
Here's a story about the three
[ Milk Dee ]
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya
I'm M-i-l-l
[ Pos K ]
I'm the Positive K and
[ MC Lyte ]
And Lyte Thee MC

[ VERSE 3: MC Lyte ]
Like that y'all (that y'all) like that y'all (that y'all)
Positive and Milk they got my back y'all (back y'all)
No doubt y'all (doubt y'all) no doubt y'all (doubt y'all)
My lights will never go out y'all (out y'all)
Now it's time to kick this rhyme kinda freely
German, Russian, even Suaheli
You'll understand the rhyme translated
You know that the Lyte is never ever underestimated
I cast a spell like _I Dream of Jeannie_
Fellas wanna see me rock a bikini (oooh...)
Hit a note just like Aretha
I'm the female (female rhyme teacher)
Each and every time the rhyme gets doper
Lyte get a talk show just like Oprah
With my ability and my agility
Will only equal up (to versatility)
A tisket, a tasket, fuck a yellow basket
(Can you rock a mic, Lyte?) How can you ask it?
I flow like a river, just like a stream
I'm like the dope (the dope for a dopefiend)
I move like the pawn, better yet the queen
Stay check-mate, you know what I mean?
I go (boom-boom) like an Alpine speaker
I go (beep-beep) like a Motorola beeper
Talk about deep, well let's get deeper
Breakin it down to the very last compound
(That's how she's livin, that's how she's livin)
"Slave to the Rhythm", that's what I'm givin

LG rocks it on and
Trooper [Name] rocks it on and
Gizmo rocks it on and
King Of Chill rocks it on and
K-Rock rocks it on and
Master T rocks it on and
[Name] rocks it on
Tito rocks it on and
Aftershock rocks it on and
[Name] rocks it on and
Leg 1 rocks it on and
Leg 2 rocks it on and

[ Pos K ]
Yo and we don't stop, keepin it on
Where where to the break break
To the break break
Till crackheads are gone
We outta here..* Ego Trip's "Book of Rap Lists"; p. 114 *..

Music first..
Grand Puba - "Step up front!"
Ahh, Milk Dee - "Step up front!"
A Priority Posse - "Step up front!"
To my mom and my dad - "Step up front!"
Uhh, c'mon.. yeah, c'mon..
Yeah baby c'mon.. uh, c'mon..

[Verse One]
Let's discuss this - listen while I bust this
It's from the K, so hey you can trust this
Rhyme ritual rap my rap spiritual
Pumpin and jumpin, from the max to the minimum
I don't moan and groan, I take it on
For floozies I bone I just leave 'em alone
I need a clear head in order for me to win it
So baby, "Hold up - hey! Wait a minute!"

Uhh, yeah.. uhh, c'mon..
Yeah baby c'mon now.. uhh, c'mon..

[Verse Two]
On the square - I'm not riffin like Andy Griffith
Just fed up, goin head up, with competition
Don't excluse or place no restriction
Gotta qualify to be in my jurisdiction
Razzle, dazzle, burn you to a frazzle
Soon you say you don't need the hassle
I'm too hard to be soft, too loud to be a duck
And if you are well then look tough luck
It's not your world so don't work at no resentment
Tryin to front on a three-hour rap segment
I'm the one so FUCK your attitude
I got a chip on my shoulder, plus I'm in a bad mood
You're huffin, puffin, bluffin for nothin
Come out your face, word is bond I hurt somethin
Rockin your knot, puttin a wop in your bop
Hittin the spot, just like an insulin shot
So whassup Hobbes?  I'm all in it
"Hold up - hey! Wait a minute!"

Yeah.. uhh, yeah baby c'mon..
Uh, c'mon..

[Verse Three]
Well uhh, boom batter, sissies don't matter
Sorry homeboy my pockets is gettin fatter
The chain gets thicker, the records come quicker
Your girl keeps comin around I'm gonna stick her
So plan your prevention I'm the best in your dimension
Don't cause static and I don't like tension
Cellophone sissies - I see through ya
Every rhyme you say I'll outdo ya
I'm an MC please I'm not a microphone teaser
Got more rhymes than meat in your freezer
So don't debate it, or complicate it
Appreciate the fact new jacks, I made it
Yeahhhh boy, believe it's true
What I've done many wants to do
My rhymes are sufficient, also suffice
No matter how you put it they're plain just nice
Takes time to be written, pull fully intact
I never had to front I got too much back
Well I said things changed ever since I got in it
So, "Hold up - hey! Wait a minute!"

Uhh, if it ain't rough it ain't right
If it ain't loose it's tight
And if it ain't black it's white
So c'mon, maintain your aggression
And use some discretion
And I'ma get wreck in just about onnnnnnnne second

[Verse Four]
Positive, the gentleman, the rapper
Intelligent, clean cut, dapper
Blowin out scales on the rhyme barometer
Raisin temperatures upon the hip-hop thermometer
Commercial - controversial's not my image
I'm roughin up rappers just like a, football scrimmage
Put 'em to a test, see what they can commit
And if they can't take an order like my dog - sit!
Girls I want - yeah I can get 'em
Shakespeare?  Couldn't shoot a rap better
Got a way with words, that could seduce you
When you find out honey, you just got loose
Word to the mother, mother to the word
It's not absurd by what you just heard
I rock 'em, wrote 'em, long like a totem pole
Baby God bless your soul
I choose 'em, flooze 'em, bang 'em, bruise 'em
Send 'em to the next man then I excuse 'em
I'm the Positive, not the interrogative
With a lot to take and a hell of a lot to give
But umm, people changed ever since I got in it so
"Hold up - hey! Wait a minute!"

Uhh, yo I wanna say whassup to the crew
To Audio Two, and MC Lyte
Also the Alliance
And to the Hillside Posse, yo we outta here!
But c'mon on.. yeah, c'mon now..
Yeah baby c'mon.. uhh, c'mon..
Yeah..Hit niggas off like Pepper Johnson
Oh, uh-oh, you ready L?  Aight, let's go
Uhh, uhh, uhh..

Ladies shout my name cause I'm sweet like sugar water
Some call me daddy cause I treat 'em like my daughter
They'll rush out my name and refer to me as Posi'
When I make love I come with like a kamikaze
I don't return 'til the mission is completed
And that's a treat when you're properly treated
Now don't - say I'm conceited, say I'm convinced
My momma called me nasty and I was ever since
At school they voted me the one most likely who would
But never realized that I'd be so damn good
Swift and interchangable, yet remaindable
Rhymes intoxicate ya when it spins on the turntable
And get you high, higher than a skyscraper
When I gets rough, it's rougher than sandpaper
The brother's still frontin, still front to flex
Wouldn't squeeze the trigger, on a bottle, of Windex
Uhh, and ya don't stop
Uhh, a yea yea you don't stop
Uhh, nah nah you don't stop
Uhh, yea yea you don't stop
