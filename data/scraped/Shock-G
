[Intro: 2Pac]
Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground when we come around
Stronger than ever

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps paging me!
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me...lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayyo bust it, baby got a problem saying "bye-bye"
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask "why?" Don't matter! My pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me,
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

[Hook]
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know

[Verse 2: Shock G]
Now you can tell from my everday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G: the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around

[Money B]
What's up love, how you doing?
Well I've been hanging, sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging?
Your home girl you went to school with? That's cool
But did she tell you about her sister? - and your cousin thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know that I get around

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone: why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get aroundI shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me
I'm not living in the past, you wanna last?
Be the first to blast Remember Kato
No longer with us; he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions
Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well
I know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lost and I'm weary So many tears
I'm suicidal so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons trying to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come

[Refrain]

[Verse 4]
Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door -- Shed so many tears

[Refrain][Verse 1]
(Haha, what you say?)
Who you callin' rapist?
Ain't that a bitch
You devils are so two faced
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
And getting stalked by these crooked cops again
Fucking with the young Black male, tryin' to stack bail
And um, stay away from the packed jails
I told the judge I'm in danger
And that's why I had that four-five with one in the chamber
Fuck the World!

[Refrain: 2Pac and Shock G]
They tryna say that I don't care
I woke up screaming "Fuck the World!"
They tryna say that I don't care
Just woke up and screamed "Fuck the World!"
They tryna say that I don't care
Uhh, I woke up and screamed "Fuck the World!"
They're tryna say that I don't care
Just got up and screamed "Fuck the World!"

[Verse 2]
When I was comin' up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin' threats to me, comin' from my enemies
And in their dreams it's hell where their sendin' me
Have I lost control or just another soul?
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin' on yak as I sit back (Penis!)
Life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say "you did that?"
Never take your eyes off the prize and even if you gettin' high
Don't ever hesitate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin', niggas we all in
And them my motherfuckers callin'
Fuck the World!

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
(Man, Fuck the World)
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
Cause I'm sittin' here sippin' on Guinness
Weighin' 165 and these tricks should die
For being jealous of a brother when he rise
I can see it in your eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin'
They hate to see a nigga ballin'
Some of you suckers is rotten, plottin' on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (Booyeah)
Stop givin' game for free, you wanna hang with me
Like being a thug is the thang to be
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, Fuck the World!

[Refrain]

Haha, Fuck the World!
Fuck it
I hear my niggas screamin' Fuck the World

[Verse 4]
They wanna know if I claim the clique that I'm hangin' with
And if I'm down with this bangin' shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or Cuz
Long as you got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
I been through hell and back and if I fail, black
Then it's back to the corner where we sell crack
Some of you niggas is bustas, you runnin' round
With these tramp-ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
Fuck the World!

[Refrain][Intro]
Haha, the remix - 5 on it!
We creepin' in too, baby
We got 5 on ery'thang mane!
We got Dru Down; we got the Luniz! Shock G, wassup?
Numskull and Yukmouth! Richie Rich, E-40, Spice 1

[Verse 1 - Dru Down]
You say you got 5 on my tender, you can bend her over the table
But be sure that you bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, brah? No elementary school-ground playing
Not a 5-dollar bill, but 5-double-zero on the real, feel?
I'm on the level, staying mellow
No criticism from the fellows, hello
Being keyed during a high-speed but still don't tap the B.B.'s
I'm D.D., Dru Down, baby

[Numskull]
Like Nyquil, I drop fevers; so either put your 5 up
Or you gots to "Leave It" like "Beaver"
Cause see, a nigga perkin' broke'll smoke your spliff all day
Go home and buy big drinky with his briddy then parlay
I got 5 on the Hennessey, Seagram's, or 40's
Cause "This is How We Do It" like Montell Jordan
I'm from the Oakland City, Frank Nitti is a goner
Num' blowing it up like Oklahoma

[Richie Rich]
Put your feev' with my fin, best believe we'll bend
More corners than you thought till something right is bought
More z-sacks? Believe that: tokin!
Where you from? Oakland! Smokin'
In attempts to crack the chest plate
The zips be so fluffy the whole town loves me
At every event I'm sacked up
So if you need me, scream "Double R!" when you see me

[Hook - Michael Marshall]
I got five on it ("got it good!")
Grab your 4, let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Messing with that indo weed!
I got 5 on it; it's got me stuck, cannot go back
I got 5 on it: partna let's go half on a sack!

[Verse 2 - E-40]
"E-40, why you treat me so bad?" 40 makes it happen
Fosgate slappin' and revenue grows
From just a little bit of lightweight flamboastin'
Potent fumes, lingering mighty clouds and Northern Lights
You disrespect Vic da Baron
And you'll be violating my civil rights
I'm starting to feel my scrilla
But perhaps today my scrilla ain't feeling me
For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools, B
Pockets empty, pitching 5, man I'm dusted
Took off my hat, passed it around, man sprinkle me

[Yukmouth]
Me and E-40 to the head, comin' fed plus, you let the lead bust
Ready to do a murda, mayn; perved off the Hurricane
Slurred again, witness what bein' off two-fifths equal
Me killin' people like Jason, facin' death every sequel
(Insane in the membrane!) "Bring the Pain" like Method
Neglected, smokin kryptonite to the brain for breakfast
Guzzle the Hen-do, finsta do the evil that men do
Give me feev', I shall proceed to continue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shock G]
Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town
Mess around and heard Yuk' and Num', said I gotta be down
Cause new styles is going down: look around you
Tunes from the Lunz spreading round and round you

[Shock G as Humpty Hump]
Back to get my O on, they let me flow on
The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still bringing satin for them drawers
Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the cause

[Spice 1]
Rolling up cannabis sativa, hitting the Mary Jane
Smoking the 5 before it's 12 o'clock, sipping on Hurricane
Ready to smoke on the indoe; rolling up my window, finna to go to the land
With a handful of broccoli
When it comes to the sticky I'm the man
Crush nasty, I be hitting the J so hard I hurl
Fall on the floor fittin' to have a stroke
T-H-C ain't no joke
I got 5 on ery'thing, let's get loaded and smoke
S-P-I-C-E about to hit it and croak

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, wassup baby?
It's me, your boy with the cape that's always tight
You a little short on some ends?
Don't worry, I'll take care of that, I got 5 on that
I got you* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists

Today is filled with anger
Fueled with hidden hate (fueled with hidden hate)
Scared of bein outcast (scared of bein outcast, scared of being an outcast)
Afraid of karma fate (afraid of karma fate)

But tomorrow, I see change (heh)
A chance to build anew
Tomorrow, I see change (chaaaaaaange)
A chance to build anew
Today is filled with rage, violence fills the air
Children bred with foolishness, cause no one cares
Today I lay my head down, but the pressure never stops
Gnawin at my sanity, content when I am dropped
But tomorrow, I see change...

Tomorrow, I see change (but tomorrow, I see change)

[Voices all overlap]
But tomorrow, I see change
A chance to build anew
Built on spirit, content of heart
And ideals based on truth
And tomorrow's the same way
I'm strong, because of my pride
To know I fought with all my heart
To keep my dreams alive

And tomorrow (heyyyyyyyyyyyyyeahhhheyy)
Tomorrow...

And tomorrow {*to fade*}*(Shock G talking)*

Welcome to a world where Rhythm is life
And life is Green
Yeah
All you need in this life is Rhythm & Green
And as a people we was born with Rhythm
Now let's get the green, know what I mean?
Comin out the Yay Area we present to you.... Rhythm & Green

Verse 1 *(Rame Royal)*

I'm zonin off lime and Hennessy
Jones and I got that remedy
In a ball cap
To camoflauge the identity
My entourage relentlessly
Sells ya'll crack
In big or small sacks
To all cats
Even enemies get served with a deposit
That's hustla logic
I'm fully drunk
I burn hemp plants
Of skunk in my closet
Matchin a composite
Facin maximum penalties
But to avoid it, I blast 'em an make 'em memory
Can't infiltrate my infantry
Infamous for takin street
Rap to new dimensions we
Intiventaly pimpin beats
Mack freaks
Back to Atlanta and D.C
Niggas bubblin like phantoms
So give us three feet
Hatas grin and bear it
While I keep ridin them Stallions
In gold links
Wit 5 karat
Diamond medallions
Roll out the red carpet slow
We lyrically remarkable
Representin the Rhythm & Green's half arsenal

Chorus *(Shock G)* 2x

We givin it to the people
People doin what they want (repeat x2)
The Rhythm we give 'em is 100% pure
We give it to 'em
Do What Ya Want. Uh!


Verse 2 *(Crown Jul)*

Race out the cribo
Ride a stretch limo
Rollin up the windows
Blowin up indo
We serve purp jumbos
But don't stumble
Pick up my young ho
In my one 'doe
I keep a trunk load
Cuz I was born in the city at war
Like Desert Storm
To give it to you hardcore
And raw like porn
Forced to swarm
To cop dope in the purest of forms
Buds greener than the forest
And fully matured
Cultivatin in the closet of the dope house
Throwin weight juss for the profit in the courts to smoke out
My folks is locced out
A fiend wil get his eye poked out
Wit the Port
Manuverin coast to coast
On home court
Now hut 1,2,3,4
What the fuck we hustle for?
Juss to see mo dope
We bustin 4-4's
Cuz heavy metal settles vendettas
Niggas is rebels
Do whatever for chedder
Until they bury us wit shovels


*(Chorus)* 2x

Verse 3 *(Rame Royal)*

Feel free
To feel me
When I bust a Philly
Down to fill it wit LG
It's nathin you can tell me
Ain't a dream you can sell me
Cause real G's do what they please
Let's feel the breeze
Til the year 2G
My eyes will only see green
But my women come in distored colors
I'm livin better than some
An worse than others
Tryin not to get smothered
Home grown in the Town my zone
Sit on the throne
An place the crown on my dome

Verse 4 *(Crown Jul)*

If y'all wonder
I been through it
Flow like fluid
And ball under the influence
But uninfluenced
By all the negatives hurt me
And flirtin wit danger
I'd rather live
Still workin wit one in the chamber
Got this gat that's enormus
Rats tryin to pull the curtian on my stellar performance
But protected by a certian umbrella insurance
You couldn't wet this if you wanted to
In the flesh
We Royal right in front of you

*(Chorus)* 2x

*(Shock G talking)*

So there you have it
Where life is Rhythm
And Rhythm is Green, know what I mean?

Roll what ya want uh!

Uh

Peep game

Tell 'em bout that shit you know

All our people
Rhythm & Green puttin it down the right way
Do What You Want!
R&G click once again(Chorus: 1x)
You gotta have a j-o-b
If you wanna be with me
Cause broke ho's is a no-no
Broke ho's is a n-o-, n-o- fa sho

*Girl Talking*
I'm tired of these motherfuckers
Talkin bout broke ass ho's
You motherfuckin right I'mma broke ass ho
Breakin yo motherfuckin ass off every time I see you
I needs my cash man
I gotta have it, gon have it, gon get it

(Yukmouth)
Who's the mack, I'm the mack, you's the mack
Kickin a gangsta limpin pimpin like Pretty cone
Now it's your herringbone I'm wearin home

(Numskull)
Dearly beloved, I'm so low-budget no gold nugget's
Chillin in the two do' cutlass same ol' bucket

(Yukmouth)
I love it when them bitches call me J.J
Cause I'm the bebe, them bitches come visit on pay day

(Numskull)
To get checks to buy leather coats, that's why I'm solo
Cause broke bitches is a no no

(Chorus: 1x)

*Girls talking*
Bitch that's just like when that nigga
Took me to Vegas, his fat ass fell asleep
I got him for his Rolex, and his car keys(whaat)
When I initialed back to the town
Sold his triple gold for a playa's price(HAHA!)

(Yukmouth)
My balls spin off the wall mic goes, psycho's
Therapy to carry me, and felt me
A bitch can't help less that bitch wealthy
Cause they ain't shit but ho's and tricks
So I goes and gives the bitch the stolen grip
That left on my nigga's clothes and shit
Vogues and shit, for my hooptie, gucci link
Me don't wanna no broke ass hoochie cause they coochie stink
Think, while your fa sho sho, bitch is a no no
Nigga's kick down you do' at the kick, she got your ass licked at the mo mo
Don't no why ya trustin the bitch
Cause she suckin ya dick but he fuckin ya bitch in the mix
But don't get it twisted, these bitches be broke as fuck
Knowin the under they be posted up, sellin but on Novero
Make dinero cash, or get the eight and half up yo narrow ass
I lay my pimpin down like Ron O'Neal
Chill in the village, deal wit more
Clean dope fiend like Willis, broke bitches kill me

(Chorus: 2x)

*Girls talking*
Oohhh, bitch ain't that Num from the Luniz
Yeah, I heard that motherfucker got hella scrilla
You ain't knowin, I'mma set the motherfucker up
Get him high wit this sunshine pussy
And Nummy all mine, ohh yeah

(Numskull)
I wanna fuck and that's it, after that split
I didn't kiss ya cause ya breath smelled like shit
I only stayed cause you was lickin me
But then I got fed up because ya dookie braid's was stickin me
Ya lookin like ya from the blue lagoon
But I ain't trippin cause I know that you'll be leavin soon
Bitch, you only with me cause you think dat I'm rich
You fuck twenty mo' nigga's, then come to me sayin you got the itch
But I ain't got it punk, I use to jimmy
"Uh-uh, remember that day we was fuckin to humpty hump"
The rubber broke, and I jumped, hit my head on the lamp
Cause I was amped, off of drank and the hamps

(Chorus: 3x)(Chorus: 4x)
"Always trying to blame a god damn nigga
900 blame a nigga"

(Verse 1 - Numskull)
How can I get blamed for shit
That a nigga really didn't even do
One nigga did the dirt, but the blames on the whole crew
I feel like O.J. and Rodney
A little mayo, but still don't be having no happy days like Potsy
Nigga's get blamed for every thang
From robbin you house, to ho stroll's
And the tropicana cocaine
And if the sun turned black
{"Yup a nigger did it Jim"} OR
{"get him over here so I blame it on him"}
Nigga's getttin (??) like the oldies
Played the fuck out, we only known for stealin cars and drinkin 40's
Or showin your whole ass crack on cops
They quick to do a nigga on the routine stop
Chopped rock's, in a nigga possesion, a whole zip
Blame me cause I'm one of fo' grips
Now you can have mayo and a gang of triggers
But that ain't shit, cause they still going to blame a nigga

(Chorus plays over REDNECK talking)
Boy I tell ya Jim, one of those black niggers took
The battery outta my car last night
I didn't see it, but I know those niggers ways

(Numskull)
Driving down the block, and what did I see
A police man trying to gaffle me
Threw down my rocks, so I wouldn't get caught
A high-speed CHASE for fourty-eight blocks

(Verse 2 - Yukmouth)
I heard some shit was goin down though
It might be scanda-lous, on the down low
Plus I get around ho, like Shock and Mon'
Walking to the lot, forgot I got the gun
In the bushes, more mayo then the rest of the pushers
Tonight a nigga might be readin my Nike's like Bushwick
Chronic smoke like chimney, to lit a doobie
They knew me, let me in free cause I be that Luni
Higher then the police sky waves off the blue
I partied two or three hours now I'm sideways in the sukra
To the hoopsta's, survival is the be-under
But I was in it, now five-oh's on my bumper
Ready to dump the forty outie, and weed baggies
They had me searchin through my car, for what we have we here
A queer tryna frame a nigga, but shame on a nigga
That try to put the blame on a nigga

(Chorus plays over REDNECK talking)
Uh, hello, this is 900 blame a nigger?
Uh, my daughter's raped, and comin back from
A Ku Klux Clan meetin, and I know a nigger did it

(Yukmouth)
Last night was the night before
Twenty-four robber's came knocking at my door
I ran out, they ran in, trying to blast for my cash
With ski-masks on they're chin

(Verse 3 - Luniz)
Take a puff from my hamp then bounce
I'm on a mission for scrilla, vanilla slugs by my zipper
Playa haters trippin off ho's it seems that they plot
Snitch to the cops, and swear that I chopped O's of cream
WHO STOLE THE COOKIE OUT THE COOKIE JAR!
That's what they mumble
Now knowin about THE POWER OF NUMSKULL!
Now I done had it wit all that static
I'm thinkin I should load my automatic
And let all these faggots have it

(Yukmouth)
One love, it's cocked backed, and then I bust slugs
Roastin a motherfucker, so busta always suffer
Blood in the ghetto, other niggas try to run up
Wit they gun, and get done from sun down to sun up, punk
Dead bodies in the trunk, they kept on tellin me
Oh I was sellin P.D. I was sellin D, I caught a felony
As soon as I got it, had to pop out a nigga brains
I was the wrong nigga to frame

(REDNECK talking while Chorus plays)
Boy I wish I could get a job
But them damn niggers take all the jobs nowadays
They got affirmative action stuff
I tell you that guy up in puff, he agreed to that stuff bad
Them, them niggas are gonna know where it's, hey...

(Yukmouth talking)
Wassup man, you all on my tape and shit
Talkin that weak shit, get the fuck up outta hear

(REDNECK)
Who are you, who are you!
You nigger's are tryna kill me!

(Yukmouth)
Get yo punk ass up outta here, peckerwood motherfucker
Jive ass turkey, that's right
I stole yo motherfuckin car
But aye, it's yo fault
Yo ass brought us from Africa, bitch
Aye get yo ass up outta here, you peckerwood motherfucker {*gunshots*}
Blast that fool man, blast that fool, get him, get him
He tryna run, blast that fool, yeah, talkin all that shit
Pointin the finger and shit, I'm tired of y'all
Pointin the fingers at motherfuckers mayne
Y'all done got O.J., Tyson, my potnah 2Pac, Gov
Man fuck blamin me, I didn't do it, WHY, fuck that you did it* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists

Run concurrent with currency

If you don't believe me, take a sample
You can freak me
Take your time, critique me
I wanna feel every nook and cranny in your fanny
Right after your annual
Man, me I'm manual
I leap freaks like a frog
Don't rewind it
So much space behind my face
Can you find it?
I'm broad minded

Chorus: Shock G

I'm major deep, deeper than deep
But when it comes to bumpin freaks
(I'm broad minded) I'm broad minded
I'm real nasty, see if you can outlast me
When I bump a freak
(I'm broad minded) I'm broad minded

In my younger summers
My moods used to spook me
I used to wonder the smell of Janet Jackson's booty
Ooooo weeee
On good times, but I took what I could find
Like the time I was in first grade, in class with Kool-Aid
I got bored and explored this young female
We'll sprung on the details
We fell in the closet
Down came my pants
Up like a clown in my stance
When I hit the stickiness
I fell into a trance
It was bent
I've been a fool every since
In pools and garages, on the roof, behind the fence
I'll be a freak apostle
After I take my middle fingers to my nostrils
Whatever the case is to the facial
Cause in my mind, I belong in my files
So mental pictures, when I sit and split ya doggystyle
You tell me "take it easy"
Baby it's been a while
Here I come touching down in your vertical smile
Hers is wild
Hot but mild like crystal hot sauce
You make me trickle
Nickels got tossed, on both sides was a winner
Heads and tails for dinner
Forgive this sinner
I got a jones for them bones
It wasn't planned
Though God timed it
You can ask D'Angelo
I'm broad minded

Chorus (2X)

You got me ready to touch the moon, here's my mushroom
I'm reading your body language
I'm ready to publish the puttin of...
Stroke of genius from a penis
That's touched everything chocolate to tapioca
I wanna watch you choke up and giggle
And wipe the spittle from your nipples a little
Uh-huh just a little
And drool a jewel until I hit a mental wreckage
The only way to identify you when I'm done
Dental records
Like this one
Fear me not
Got everything from Miracle Whip to spiritual dick
Drippin wet
Let me bite your hands on my chinny chin chin
Win a trip to buy a fit to tie your loose ends
Stay a while child
I got toys
But you got to wind it
I'm broad minded

Chorus (2X)

Yeah, big shout out to Shock G for these broad minded tracks
No doubt
Hobo Junction soldier
Bumpin these freaks in a broad minded state
Lettin you know for the nine six straight
Sideways[Intro]

Greg: Hello Career Finders, Greg speaking, may I help you?
T: Oh, I'm T-Nut
T: I'm T-Dog, T-Nut Penitentiary
Greg: Um, ok
T: T-Dog Nut, Killer T
Greg: What are your special areas of interest?

[Verse 1 - Mr. Lif] (Akrobatik) {Mighty Dollar}
(Yo, I pump crack), you fill cracks? (No, I pump 'em)
Whoa, I think you got too personal or somethin
So, you're livin an alternative lifestyle
(Nah nigga, I sell crack in little vials)
Hmm, I think I got the perfect job for you
Go home and raise your kids and stay the fuck out the booth
(Hey yo, fuck you) (next!) Why you lookin all vexed?
What's your skill? (Everyday I blast niggas with tecs)
Can you use an AK? (Hell yeah!) Is that a fact?
Ak, pull up the plan and get this kid to Iraq
State your name {Mighty Dollar} (*laughing*) {What's so funny?}
Nothin {son, I'm known to get money}
Yeah, it says right here you rhyme excessively
About cash as if everyday's a fuckin spendin spree
Maybe consider Accounting or Banking
Or maybe it's time to start doin the glam thing
It's played out, oh my God, he hasn't noticed yet
Leave the mic alone and pass the rhymin to the vets, next
Fuck that, matter fact close the office
These lost black zombie niggas makin me nauseous

[Hook - Akrobatik] - 2X
(Career Finders)
Leave that life of rap behind yo
We got somethin to suit you finer (We're Career Finders)
Put them pipe dreams on the shelf
And let us put you on the right path to wealth

[Verse 2 - Shock G as Humpty Hump]
(Hello Career Finders"), yeah, I'm lookin for a position
Special talent, I'm really good at dissin
I bug it to on a pen and ten mission
Kindness and discipline is all that I'm missin
(But I) I want to get paid
I got these flows, the record that I made, help me get laid
Okay, let's see Mr. Disser
Mr. nine millimeter pump fixer
You're interested in being richer
Without no work, I'll put you down as a wisher
Wait, did I mention I can roll weed in a swisher?
Hmm, I'll put you down as a wisher (dreams)
So, this is what we got
Your good at pointin out who's a bitch and who's not
You ain't scared, down to shoot up the spot
Have you thought about the military, or a cop?
You make a good bank robber, you like to be the star ship man?
Well what about a hitman?
Gotta give it to you, when it comes to hard, you the hardest
We're just not sure if your an artist

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Akrobatik]
Uh, yo, instead of makin records, havin everybody nervous
Maybe we can get you somethin with the Secret Service
Many applicants frown when they first heard this
But what's bein an artist got to do with doin murders?
You want to bust guns, here's some fly shit
A war's goin on, be a front line private
Yeah, you could be a hero in Iraq
Or be the cat that stop the next plane from bein hijacked (damn)
But you want to party hard
Instead of bein a rapper, maybe you could be a bodyguard
Or maybe work a detail at Mardi Gras
A chaperon at the night bar, where the hotties are
You a typical applicant
With everything you say you do, it make me wonder why you want to rap and shit
I'm a put your resume back in the cabinet
Find another path, Career Finders ain't havin it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Greg: What are your special areas of interest?
T: Nigga I pimp them hoes, What?
Greg: Um, ok
T: Nigga
T: I'm real nigga though
T: You know why? Cause niggas don't know
T: I'm real nigga, nigga, NIGGA
(*laughing*)
T: Shiat[Verse 1]
(Haha, what you say?)
Who you callin' rapist?
Ain't that a bitch
You devils are so two faced
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
And getting stalked by these crooked cops again
Fucking with the young Black male, tryin' to stack bail
And um, stay away from the packed jails
I told the judge I'm in danger
And that's why I had that four-five with one in the chamber
Fuck the World!

[Refrain: 2Pac and Shock G]
They tryna say that I don't care
I woke up screaming "Fuck the World!"
They tryna say that I don't care
Just woke up and screamed "Fuck the World!"
They tryna say that I don't care
Uhh, I woke up and screamed "Fuck the World!"
They're tryna say that I don't care
Just got up and screamed "Fuck the World!"

[Verse 2]
When I was comin' up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin' threats to me, comin' from my enemies
And in their dreams it's hell where their sendin' me
Have I lost control or just another soul?
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin' on yak as I sit back (Penis!)
Life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say "you did that?"
Never take your eyes off the prize and even if you gettin' high
Don't ever hesitate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin', niggas we all in
And them my motherfuckers callin'
Fuck the World!

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
(Man, Fuck the World)
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
Cause I'm sittin' here sippin' on Guinness
Weighin' 165 and these tricks should die
For being jealous of a brother when he rise
I can see it in your eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin'
They hate to see a nigga ballin'
Some of you suckers is rotten, plottin' on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (Booyeah)
Stop givin' game for free, you wanna hang with me
Like being a thug is the thang to be
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, Fuck the World!

[Refrain]

Haha, Fuck the World!
Fuck it
I hear my niggas screamin' Fuck the World

[Verse 4]
They wanna know if I claim the clique that I'm hangin' with
And if I'm down with this bangin' shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or Cuz
Long as you got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
I been through hell and back and if I fail, black
Then it's back to the corner where we sell crack
Some of you niggas is bustas, you runnin' round
With these tramp-ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
Fuck the World!

[Refrain]Impressions of Other People or Characters

Sometimes MCs do impressions of other MCs or other famous people or characters. This is almost always done for entertaining or humorous effect, as they usually aren’t actually trying to convince listeners that they are that person; they’re doing it because it’ll sound interesting or funny.

Eminem has a number of tracks in which he does impressions of other people or characters. These include an impression of Snoop Dogg on the track “Bitch Please II” (02:32) (the lines beginning, “Oh no, big Slim Dogg . . .”); Triumph the Insult Comic Dog on the track “Ass Like That” (01:10) (throughout the song, for example in the lines “For I am Triumph, the puppet dog, I am a mere puppet, I can get away with anything I say, and you will love it”); and characters from the television show South Park on the track “The Kids” (00:01).

Del the Funky Homosapien: Everything helps. I grew up doing impressions and stuff, like “Heavens to Murgatroyd!” [said in the voice of the cartoon character Snagglepuss]—I grew up watching a lot of cartoons. It helps making it entertaining, like that voice, Snagglepuss, I just did it on a song I did [recently]. Gave it to my girl, she was, like, dying laughing. So anything you could throw into the pot adds more to your personality. I would say you better try to get every bit you can, every little bit and nook and cranny inside you, and try to throw that in the pot, because anything you throw in there is just going to make it more likely that you will succeed.

Other cartoon characters are impersonated by Funkdoobiest, imitating Sylvester the Cat’s catchphrase, “Sufferin’ succotash” on their track “Super Hoes” (02:38) and Fu-Schnickens performing an Elmer Fudd–styled line of “Come back here, bunny wabbit” on their track “Sum Dum Munkey” (01:31). Shock G’s alter-ego voice (looked at further on p. 93) is based on a cartoon character.

Shock G, Digital Underground: “Hip Hop Doll” (00:11) was the first time I tested what later became the “Humpty” voice, and I was actually imitating the Warner Bros frog [Michigan J. Frog, singing “Hello My Baby”], who himself was imitating the oldies pop singer Bing Crosby.

Doing these types of impressions often requires a sense of humor and a willingness to let go and not care how you may be judged for it.

Shock G, Digital Underground: I think my predominant essence is like that of a comedian, because my natural at-rest mental state is more giggly-goofy-jokey than it is “need people to take me serious” [or] “[I] need to fit in” minded. But most rappers want to be taken seriously, and it’s the pursuit of that serious respect that doesn’t allow for any “silly” impressions or any visible break in their serious “true” self—that concern that it could make them appear weak to the fans and therefore jeopardize the mission!

Del the Funky Homosapien: Some people is, like, too good for that, they don’t wanna do that, but I feel like if you let loose and you’re just loose sometimes, it engages people more. It allows people to feel kinda comfortable, and like, “OK, it’s not that serious.” I try to keep the mood of it [like], “OK, I got something to say, but it ain’t that fucking deep.” It’s not that serious—I’m just trying to have some fun with you for a minute and then you can go back to whatever you were doing. You don’t [always] want somebody to listen to your [music] and they feel like it’s a drag—like, man, this is like the doom of the world. And don’t get me wrong, I’ve done songs, I’m sure, where the feel was like that, but naturally I just got a sense of humor, so that’s the way I come about it. You gotta be loose and open and free enough, because if you’re not, them ideas won’t come out. You’ll be too scared to do it.

Sometimes this is done in homage to another MC or person, such as on A Tribe Called Quest’s “If the Papes Come” (00:24) when Q-Tip quotes and mimics the beginning of Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story.” This is also done at the beginning of Wyclef Jean’s “Bubblegoose” (00:11) mimicking the same Slick Rick song (“Hey kids, gather around, I got a story to tell, here we go”).

Akil the MC, Jurassic 5: If you have a knowledge of different types of MCs, then that helps you be able to pick your lane, or helps you create your own lane, as opposed to just driving recklessly over lanes that are already there.[Intro: 2Pac]
Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground when we come around
Stronger than ever

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps paging me!
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me...lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayyo bust it, baby got a problem saying "bye-bye"
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask "why?" Don't matter! My pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me,
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

[Hook]
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know

[Verse 2: Shock G]
Now you can tell from my everday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G: the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around

[Money B]
What's up love, how you doing?
Well I've been hanging, sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging?
Your home girl you went to school with? That's cool
But did she tell you about her sister? - and your cousin thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know that I get around

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone: why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get around[Intro]
Haha, the remix - 5 on it!
We creepin' in too, baby
We got 5 on ery'thang mane!
We got Dru Down; we got the Luniz! Shock G, wassup?
Numskull and Yukmouth! Richie Rich, E-40, Spice 1

[Verse 1 - Dru Down]
You say you got 5 on my tender, you can bend her over the table
But be sure that you bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, brah? No elementary school-ground playing
Not a 5-dollar bill, but 5-double-zero on the real, feel?
I'm on the level, staying mellow
No criticism from the fellows, hello
Being keyed during a high-speed but still don't tap the B.B.'s
I'm D.D., Dru Down, baby

[Numskull]
Like Nyquil, I drop fevers; so either put your 5 up
Or you gots to "Leave It" like "Beaver"
Cause see, a nigga perkin' broke'll smoke your spliff all day
Go home and buy big drinky with his briddy then parlay
I got 5 on the Hennessey, Seagram's, or 40's
Cause "This is How We Do It" like Montell Jordan
I'm from the Oakland City, Frank Nitti is a goner
Num' blowing it up like Oklahoma

[Richie Rich]
Put your feev' with my fin, best believe we'll bend
More corners than you thought till something right is bought
More z-sacks? Believe that: tokin!
Where you from? Oakland! Smokin'
In attempts to crack the chest plate
The zips be so fluffy the whole town loves me
At every event I'm sacked up
So if you need me, scream "Double R!" when you see me

[Hook - Michael Marshall]
I got five on it ("got it good!")
Grab your 4, let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Messing with that indo weed!
I got 5 on it; it's got me stuck, cannot go back
I got 5 on it: partna let's go half on a sack!

[Verse 2 - E-40]
"E-40, why you treat me so bad?" 40 makes it happen
Fosgate slappin' and revenue grows
From just a little bit of lightweight flamboastin'
Potent fumes, lingering mighty clouds and Northern Lights
You disrespect Vic da Baron
And you'll be violating my civil rights
I'm starting to feel my scrilla
But perhaps today my scrilla ain't feeling me
For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools, B
Pockets empty, pitching 5, man I'm dusted
Took off my hat, passed it around, man sprinkle me

[Yukmouth]
Me and E-40 to the head, comin' fed plus, you let the lead bust
Ready to do a murda, mayn; perved off the Hurricane
Slurred again, witness what bein' off two-fifths equal
Me killin' people like Jason, facin' death every sequel
(Insane in the membrane!) "Bring the Pain" like Method
Neglected, smokin kryptonite to the brain for breakfast
Guzzle the Hen-do, finsta do the evil that men do
Give me feev', I shall proceed to continue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shock G]
Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town
Mess around and heard Yuk' and Num', said I gotta be down
Cause new styles is going down: look around you
Tunes from the Lunz spreading round and round you

[Shock G as Humpty Hump]
Back to get my O on, they let me flow on
The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still bringing satin for them drawers
Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the cause

[Spice 1]
Rolling up cannabis sativa, hitting the Mary Jane
Smoking the 5 before it's 12 o'clock, sipping on Hurricane
Ready to smoke on the indoe; rolling up my window, finna to go to the land
With a handful of broccoli
When it comes to the sticky I'm the man
Crush nasty, I be hitting the J so hard I hurl
Fall on the floor fittin' to have a stroke
T-H-C ain't no joke
I got 5 on ery'thing, let's get loaded and smoke
S-P-I-C-E about to hit it and croak

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, wassup baby?
It's me, your boy with the cape that's always tight
You a little short on some ends?
Don't worry, I'll take care of that, I got 5 on that
I got you[MURS]
See, had the place to myself, my parents went outta town
So I had the music up and was runnin' around
Singing to the beat of my favorite underground
Song at the time, let's just say it was MURS
I was rappin' in the mirror, I was knowin' every verse
I was doin' my thang until the doorbell rang
It was my homeboy Shock, a mellow type of fellow
That I knew from up the block, he walked in and said:

[Shock G]
Yo, what's the deal MURS? First things first, you couldn'ta hit me
At a better time, them four cars behind me, they with me
All women, all dimes, the redhead she's mine
She wanna hump me, yo that's my brother Humpty

[Shock G as Humpty Hump]
What's up yo? Pardon me, but I gots to go, where the bathroom at?
Y'all got liquor? Come on, Trina! Yo this house is fat
'Ey cat, you wanna hit this? Oops I shouldn'ta did that
I'll clean it up before your folks come home, yo where they at?

[MURS]
Man I don't believe you brought this nigga man I heard about his ass
The only fool dumb enough to flunk his P.E. Class
It's not that he's dumb, he's just wild and he's ignorant
Known for gettin' mad drunk and gettin' all belligerent
Man I'm sick of this I shouldn'ta told nobody
I mean three's company, but four cars makes a party
Mental note: lock the garage, hide the keys to dad's Rolls
Cause it's outta control, this bitch is taking off her clothes

[Shock G]
Is your dad's Rolls blue? Cause I got bad news
Humpty took a cruise, and barbeque pit went in the pool
Turned the water grey, I would stay and help you clean up
But the neighbors say police are comin', I'm bout to G up

[Humpty Hump]
Beep, beep, beep! Yo, I'm back MURS, where should I park it?
I brought the whole strip club with me, we bout to spark it
My girl urled in your backseat, but yo it's cool
We got weed and some shrooms, is it cool to use your dad's room?

[Hook 2X]

It's risky business, man what is this?
I'm caught up in a twist, and I'm tryin' to fix shit
It's risky business, man what is this?
I'm caught up in a twist, now I'm tryin' to fix it

[MURS]
What you mean my dad's room? Nigga is you crazy?
And what's up with them glasses, what'cha eye kinda lazy?
Anyways we gotta clean that shit up out the backseat
But first what's up with that blonde, you think she
Likes black meat?

[Shock G]
She said she was a virgin to the brown, never splurged in the town
But she's down, cause you got her all moist, like the Rolls Royce backseat
'Least I can do is help you clean it up cousin
What time is mom and dad comin'?

[Humpty Hump]
Yo, why y'all bein' responsible and shit? We gotta hook up
We tryin' to get these chicks upstairs, see what we can cook up
One of them got their toes blue, coochie shaved, so cool
My nose tryin' to be with those when the doors close fool

[MURS]
Exactly. Fuck the backseat I'm tryin' to smack cheeks
Until they turn reddish, and satisfy my fetish
Lay back and get some lettuce (Humpty: Yo, what'chu mean, head?) (Yeah)
That's what I said, then call it a wrap (Shock: But what about your parents?)
Well, they never called me back, I guess their flight got delayed
So we got time to get laid, ayo Hump could you watch out for that white Escalade?
(Humpty: Did you even have to ask?) Well since you're on the task
I'mma head upstairs and get focused on some ass
And if I start to scream, do your best to ignore me
If my parents come in, just tell them the Burger King story
Just keep 'em entertained until I finish gettin' brained
(Humpty: Hello Ms. Carter, he's gettin' drained) And her name is Elaine

[Hook 2X]I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me
I'm not living in the past, you wanna last?
Be the first to blast Remember Kato
No longer with us; he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions
Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well
I know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lost and I'm weary So many tears
I'm suicidal so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons trying to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come

[Refrain]

[Verse 4]
Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door -- Shed so many tears

[Refrain][Intro: Too Short]
Send a shout out to the homie Pac
Know you out there somewhere right now writing rhymes man, laying tracks
Straight love, you know what I'm saying always man
We had never forgot about 2Pac, you know, that's our boy till the end

From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac
From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh, pimp game impecable
Work game incredible (how many songs did he do)
Nine songs a day, no less than four
A rap legend, an icon, a reptible
Last time I seen him was at my Rapper's Ball video
Pac you'll be proud of me pimpin', I'm doing my best
Not only the Bay, but I'm holding down the West
And I just wanna thank Afeni (why)
For birthing 2Pac Shakur, the greatest rapper in history

[Verse 2: MC Hammer]
I'm glad we had a chance, to say goodbye
I shed so many tears and you changed my life
California Love baby ride or die
I can hear you, right now, Pac yelling West Side
And West it is, we got the world going dumb
We gone make 'em understand Pac where we coming from
Don't you worry homie, rest in peace
We appreciate your love, let your soul run free

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Look into the hearts of men, every pumping valve
Man I wish we had 2Pacalypse now
Like you, I wanna make the whole world love me
You let me know, only God can judge me
I got tears in my eyes as I write this verse
The whole Bay know you were hyphy first
You've been gone, we gon stand strong
Immortalized, the legend lives on

[Chorus: Mike Marshall]
Do you hear the people sing, singing the songs that's in their veins
It's the music of a people who have smiled and found the pain
With the beating of your heart, there goes the beating of the drums
Know the song continues on when tomorrow comes

[Verse 4: Mistah Fab]
This is for the great Amaru
God knew, that you, would ride through the ghettos of the world and provide food
For hopeless youth, dope feinds with dope to use
The way that you spoke your views gave hope to dudes
2Pac, the legendary Shakur
Makaveli the Don, a prophet I'm sure
And '96 man it dont seem like it's been
I can picture you rolling up in your 500 Benz

[Verse 5: Mac Mall]
You gave me love on the ghetto scene
Put me on a million TV screens, with you
I remember drinking liqour at century clubs
Watching superstars sworn over Thug Life
You took a youngin from the Crest Side world wide
Real thizzness, I was family when you died
I'm a real outlaw and I'mma ride til the end of time
And when I see you on the other side
I crack the cap on the Henny
And Big Back, would I lie?

[Verse 6: Band-Aide of Dem Hoodstarz]
All eyes on me, dear mama, its me against the world
You know I get around like your brendas little girl
Blast me, no im not telling you the blasphemy
Pac was a [?], his death was a tragedy

[Verse 7: Scoot of Dem Hoodstarz]
Come with me, hail mary to the soldiers
Spit at the cameras, flipping off the rollers
I swear you made a nation full of thugs, put your W's up
And make the West Coast feel like one, rest in peace Pac

[Chorus: Jimmie Reign, Meilani]

[Verse 8: Turf Talk]
(Aye Pac wassup mayne)
Man I've been missing Makaveli since '96
Pac the games change, there are hella wimps
Picrture Me Rolling, one of my favorite songs
Satrin At The World Through My Rearview, Life Goes On
Had dreams of working with you, but it never happened
But I ain't trippin, we'll collaborate some day in heaven
All your albums classics, all of them slapping
Is there a heaven for a G, I know you got it cracking

[Verse 9: Lil Uno of The Pack]
Makaveli, 2Pac, he was a legend
But he in a better place, on earth we call it heaven
'96 is the year that we lost a gift
You gone, but not forgotten, and you always will be missed

[Verse 10: Lil B of The Pack]
Man, Pac, we love you, ain't nobody above you
You music touched us, and the people we buzzing
It's all about Pac, yeah the angel with the broken wings
Rose from concrete, he's still here is what it seems

[Verse 11: Young L of The Pack]
Stand troops, recognize the truth
Here lies the dude who lived rough and died for you
Took slugs and spilt his blood to lace the youth
And told young niggas to get up and face the blues
Cause it's a thugs life, everyday is what we do
Love life, believe and you'll see it through
So to my brother Pac make a place for me with you
I'mma represent you, till I reach the tool

[Chorus: Ray Luv, James "D-Train" Williams, Martha Wash]

[Verse 12: Baby Bash]
He used to clown around, when he came around with the underground
Hit the V-Town with Kyrie on some thunder pounds
Even directed the video (Mac Mall)
He was on some major shit way back then but we didn't know
How a genius get to work, on the herb and the purp
Probably looking down, smiling now on some purp
He had love for us Mexicans
Loves to see young playas stacking Benjamins

[Verse 13: Nump Trump]
I wake up and blaze one for Pac every morning
It's Mr. I Got Grapes, picture me rolling
Everybody knows this, or knew what it was
When we found out Pac passed, it was so messed up
We was crushed, couldn't beleive it, Gorilla-Pinos and all
But we still slap your album so the music lives on
When tomorrow comes, we still ride for Makaveli
From the low-lows to scrapers, you smell me

[Verse 14: Shock G]
Pac, he didn't mean to die, he got in over his head
Died for you but wasn't trying to be dead
He went round and round, cause there wasn't nothing better to do
What could be better than dying for you
Split the blunt, put the Hennessey in the cup
Let me see ya, let me see ya toss it up
We all feel 2Pac, now that he's gone
But recognize those alive who sing the same song, c'mon

[Chorus: Kimberlee Payton, Isa S. Chu, Laura Lane, Nancy Zumwalt][Intro: Money B, and 2Pac]
Yeah, its another classic cassette, Goin Way Back Show, exclusive you know what it is
What you won't do... do for Love...
Hey yo let me rock this, let me rock this, let me rock this, check it out, check it out
Let me tell you a story about my homie and his girl, you know what I'm saying
Some Love triangle type shit, we going rock this shit right here
So dope beat to you know what I'm saying
We about to run through this
So yo check it out
Smooth you drop the vocals, and I'll smoke his ass

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I lay awake tonight because I want to be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see her the feeling gets stronger
We sit a bit closer and stare a lot longer, huh
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Went to mutter I stuttered cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win
Cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, I'm falling for his girlfriend
It's like a trap that I'm sinking in to
I wake up sweating when I'm sleeping cause I'm thinking of you
Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
Trying to shake it but the feeling comes right back
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep calling me saying to come over
What do I do, you make it hard for me to chose .. what I won't do for Love

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit, and pray hoping the beatings will go away
It wasn't always a hit, and run relationship
It used to be Love happiness, and companionship
Way back when he treated you good
Moved you up to the hills out the ill's of the ghetto hood
You felt as though you owed him your life
It felt right so you said yes now your really his wife
He got you pregnant but the baby just wouldn't live
Something she couldn't give so things got negative
But that's when a stranger came through
And he's pestering you about the things you couldn't do
You say your happy at home right
But that's just a lie, as you cry through a long night
Until I came to rescue you, making you chose ... what you won't do for Love

[Outro: 2Pac]
And you don't stop, and you don't stop, in the house, what you won't do for Love
And you don't stop, and you don't stop, what you won't do
Yo Smooth, kick and laugh while we giving shout outs to my homes' you know what I'm saying noow
Shock-G is in the house, yeah
Schmoovy-Schmoov is in the house, yeah
Kush is in the house, yeah

Do for Love ..Artist: Luniz
Album: Operation Stackola
Song: 5150

Behold, your highness, the Luniz are here
Bring them in
Man where the fuck we at who the fuck are you??
It is I, Jesus, Shock Jesus
And what brings you brothers to such an early fate?
Man, no what the fuck man
Niggas just shot me man, what the fuck man
How dare you use such language in the face of the almighty
Fuck you
You shall perish (beitch!!)
It is my judgement that you shall burn in hell
Man, noo
For eternity
Nooo (the Luniz are here)
Ahhh

5150, feel me
Psycho disco just go Luni
5150, feel me
Psycho disco just go Luni

I wish I had cot (what?) I wish I had some cot (why?)
So I could sky and have a place to lay my head and plot
A broke nigga boney
Quick to lick but I could never steal shit from my homies
I play acts and make scratch from table scraps
And always end up fucked watchin other niggas backs
I broke hamps wit my folks and get pounds
But in the mist of funk
Would they really bust rounds?
I get woozie when I inhale all the badness
I swear to the Lord when I was young I never had this problem
I stressed the fuck out gotta doubt my own niggas
I try to solve my problems wit hamps and liquor
I used to swig a 22, graduated to a 64
And now I don't smoke weed no mo'
And I ain't knowin where I'm headin
Most likely it's the scene of creamery
I'm petrified of the whole scenery
The game is some shit ya either roll wit
Or give up because the game is quick to make a nigga stroke it
For less is what I was wishin for it never came true
So it came to plannin missions damn near shittin in my drawers
I gotta play my part though and take what I can
From the niggas I don't got Scarface nigga I feel ya
By any means nescescary
That's why they find scary niggas buried
Carried to a whole 'nother place
If youse a hard nigga die with a smirk on your face
So much drama, I put my best in it
Peace, I'd rather live than rather rest in it
Where I'm from or where I'm headed, it ain't no love
I give thanx that I'm alive to the man up above
I'm still takin shit day by day
Survin off a nifty, that's why I'm goin 5150

Ripley's won't believe I'm shot, limpin down the block
Tryin to scoot out, carry the bloody Glock
Cause niggas they plot, it was a shoot out
Tryin to take the loot out my pocket
But I'm quick to let the Glock spit at his 350 rocket
Then I split runnin down the block
No sense of dick made them bitch made niggas whip out a guage
Then blaze my ribcage, I'm dazed
On the ground hella bleeedin ass out
I remeber seein somebody put me in a glass house, I passed out
Then my spirit arose up out my flesh, I'm old
No more bullet holes in my chest
A gold vest when I awaken for Mista Go-Tec-9 is awaitin
The Lord has no love for playa hatin
I'm facin Shock Jesus cause I'm the G-ist nigga to do the job right
Because I'm trained up in that mob life
Come back tonite strapped tonite
He said if I suceed he'll bring my family and dead homies back to life
A big ass eagle scooped me up then we bails out
Flyin through the cuts goin the secret hill route
The whole scene was a disaster
Friday the 13th the final chapter
Lookin niggas wit casper the ghost
But I float until I smoked the big man
Slipped in quick sand
He's gonna kill me but my spirit slipped in my body
I yelled watch out he's gonna get me
They didn't get me, huh, they labelled my ass 5150

Chorus(Chorus: 1x)
You gotta have a j-o-b
If you wanna be with me
Cause broke ho's is a no-no
Broke ho's is a n-o-, n-o- fa sho

*Girl Talking*
I'm tired of these motherfuckers
Talkin bout broke ass ho's
You motherfuckin right I'mma broke ass ho
Breakin yo motherfuckin ass off every time I see you
I needs my cash man
I gotta have it, gon have it, gon get it

(Yukmouth)
Who's the mack, I'm the mack, you's the mack
Kickin a gangsta limpin pimpin like Pretty cone
Now it's your herringbone I'm wearin home

(Numskull)
Dearly beloved, I'm so low-budget no gold nugget's
Chillin in the two do' cutlass same ol' bucket

(Yukmouth)
I love it when them bitches call me J.J
Cause I'm the bebe, them bitches come visit on pay day

(Numskull)
To get checks to buy leather coats, that's why I'm solo
Cause broke bitches is a no no

(Chorus: 1x)

*Girls talking*
Bitch that's just like when that nigga
Took me to Vegas, his fat ass fell asleep
I got him for his Rolex, and his car keys(whaat)
When I initialed back to the town
Sold his triple gold for a playa's price(HAHA!)

(Yukmouth)
My balls spin off the wall mic goes, psycho's
Therapy to carry me, and felt me
A bitch can't help less that bitch wealthy
Cause they ain't shit but ho's and tricks
So I goes and gives the bitch the stolen grip
That left on my nigga's clothes and shit
Vogues and shit, for my hooptie, gucci link
Me don't wanna no broke ass hoochie cause they coochie stink
Think, while your fa sho sho, bitch is a no no
Nigga's kick down you do' at the kick, she got your ass licked at the mo mo
Don't no why ya trustin the bitch
Cause she suckin ya dick but he fuckin ya bitch in the mix
But don't get it twisted, these bitches be broke as fuck
Knowin the under they be posted up, sellin but on Novero
Make dinero cash, or get the eight and half up yo narrow ass
I lay my pimpin down like Ron O'Neal
Chill in the village, deal wit more
Clean dope fiend like Willis, broke bitches kill me

(Chorus: 2x)

*Girls talking*
Oohhh, bitch ain't that Num from the Luniz
Yeah, I heard that motherfucker got hella scrilla
You ain't knowin, I'mma set the motherfucker up
Get him high wit this sunshine pussy
And Nummy all mine, ohh yeah

(Numskull)
I wanna fuck and that's it, after that split
I didn't kiss ya cause ya breath smelled like shit
I only stayed cause you was lickin me
But then I got fed up because ya dookie braid's was stickin me
Ya lookin like ya from the blue lagoon
But I ain't trippin cause I know that you'll be leavin soon
Bitch, you only with me cause you think dat I'm rich
You fuck twenty mo' nigga's, then come to me sayin you got the itch
But I ain't got it punk, I use to jimmy
"Uh-uh, remember that day we was fuckin to humpty hump"
The rubber broke, and I jumped, hit my head on the lamp
Cause I was amped, off of drank and the hamps

(Chorus: 3x)Intro:
Yo Saafir what's goin' on playboy?
Saafir: What's really goin' on?

Huh, you tell me baby

Saafir:Hey, it's like this man
I gotta let these motherfuckers know how to crawl man

I know everybody tryin' to come up immediately

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance cause they
Ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man

Verse 1:
You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline'
And stackin' your scratch
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin'
Stickin' and movin' slidin'
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner
Dodgin' the coroner's office
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin'
Shot callin'
It's the murk one like that
Sit back but not in starship
So I don't tarnish or rust
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

Hook: (x2)
What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball

Verse 2:
All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin'
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
]From the trenches
The stench is unknown
I've been crawlin' like a two toed
Chameleon for so long
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick
Sickin' thinkin'
That we know it's on
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you
And you know they all with you
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes
Recognize
I'm crawlin'

Bridge: (x2)
Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

Verse 3:
You see gotta put in major work in at first
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin'
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys
The team then turn and brace God gave green
Going, going till I'm gone
I'm ballin'

Hook*(Shock G talking)*

Welcome to a world where Rhythm is life
And life is Green

And as a people we was born with Rhythm
Now let's get the green, know what I mean?
Comin out the Yay Area we present to you.... Rhythm & Green

Verse 1 *(Rame Royal)*

I'm zonin off lime and Hennessy
Jones and I got that remedy
In a ball cap
To camoflauge the identity
My entourage relentlessly
Sells ya'll crack
In big or small sacks
To all cats
Even enemies get served with a deposit
That's hustla logic
I'm fully drunk
I burn hemp plants
Of skunk in my closet
Matchin a composite
Facin maximum penalties
But to avoid it, I blast 'em an make 'em memory
Can't infiltrate my infantry
Infamous for takin street
Rap to new dimensions we
Intiventaly pimpin beats
Mack freaks
Back to Atlanta and D.C
Niggas bubblin like phantoms
So give us three feet
Hatas grin and bear it
While I keep ridin them Stallions
In gold links
Wit 5 karat
Diamond medallions
Roll out the red carpet slow
We lyrically remarkable
Representin the Rhythm & Green's half arsenal

Chorus *(Shock G)* 2x

We givin it to the people
People doin what they want (repeat x2)
The Rhythm we give 'em is 100% pure
We give it to 'em
Do What Ya Want. Uh!


Verse 2 *(Crown Jul)*

Race out the cribo
Ride a stretch limo
Rollin up the windows
Blowin up indo
We serve purp jumbos
But don't stumble
Pick up my young ho
In my one 'doe
I keep a trunk load
Cuz I was born in the city at war
Like Desert Storm
To give it to you hardcore
And raw like porn
Forced to swarm
To cop dope in the purest of forms
Buds greener than the forest
And fully matured
Cultivatin in the closet of the dope house
Throwin weight juss for the profit in the courts to smoke out
My folks is locced out
A fiend wil get his eye poked out
Wit the Port
Manuverin coast to coast
On home court
Now hut 1,2,3,4
What the fuck we hustle for?
Juss to see mo dope
We bustin 4-4's
Cuz heavy metal settles vendettas
Niggas is rebels
Do whatever for chedder
Until they bury us wit shovels


*(Chorus)* 2x

Verse 3 *(Rame Royal)*

Feel free
To feel me
When I bust a Philly
Down to fill it wit LG
It's nathin you can tell me
Ain't a dream you can sell me
Cause real G's do what they please
Let's feel the breeze
Til the year 2G
My eyes will only see green
But my women come in distored colors
I'm livin better than some
An worse than others
Tryin not to get smothered
Home grown in the Town my zone
Sit on the throne
An place the crown on my dome

Verse 4 *(Crown Jul)*

If y'all wonder
I been through it
Flow like fluid
And ball under the influence
But uninfluenced
By all the negatives hurt me
And flirtin wit danger
I'd rather live
Still workin wit one in the chamber
Got this gat that's enormus
Rats tryin to pull the curtian on my stellar performance
But protected by a certian umbrella insurance
You couldn't wet this if you wanted to
In the flesh
We Royal right in front of you

*(Chorus)* 2x

*(Shock G talking)*

The mother fucking funk seesion is about to begin
Crowd around, ladies and gentlemen crowd around
The funk session is about to begin
When I say funk session, i ain't talking about George Clinton
I love that nigger though
I ain't talking about James Brown and Sly Stone
I'm not talking about mother fucking the Time and Prince
(What you talking about?)
We talking about funk session 96 style
96 funk mean a different thing
That means you looked at my woman, and I'm stepping to you
And you about to pull out the gat and try to blow a nigger's brains out

Too Short:

You see we can't along cause we just don't want to
You cross the game and my crew will just stomp you
And sing the ripper, we just say oh well
And the white man keeps on building more jails
I know the system ain't nothing to fool with
Cause you locked up all my homies that I went to school with
And I know damn well you got my name on the list
Cause I'm the one that called your daughter a bitch
Just a black man doin good, you wanna do me
Before you ban rap you need to ban them violent movies
Gangsta rap causes crime, Mike Tyson wrecked the system
Larry Hoover ran a gang in Illinios can't forget
Malcom X taught us knowledge, Martin Luther preached for peace
And every day black men lying dead in the street
So where's the real education, in the hood
Peace to the muslims cause they're doing real good
They're never giving up, on the black folks
We need to buy our own land and try to stack dough
Get rich if you want to, I ain't trying to front you
If Robert Gold want some funk tell him come through
It's been a long night but we're still getting funky
Who opened up the cage and let out the monkey
I heard it when she said it, "You just a dogg Short
Like them G's out in South Side Chicago"
I said that's right ho, I'm from the East O
And I will never spend my money on a six-fo
High performance, is what I'm riding
I got the game from Oakland so I never stop siding
I'm getting money in this criminal's country
Ho's show me love because my pimping's so lovely
I'm not a role model, unless you trying to mack her
Cause first I am player and second I'm a rapper
Third I'm just a big ass baller
Top notch on my beeper but I still won't call her
Cause I got one with me, And I'm a pimp till I die
Don't be talking to them snitches, you'll get sent on a lie
Doing time in the pen for some backstabbing
I wonder what would happen if they catch em
You burn his balls with a big lighter, get the gasoline
And he'll be smoking like a mother fucking dope fiend
Nowaday's they like to kill your whole crew
For coming to the party and stepping on a shoe
He said excuse me, but it wasn't al-right
So now you want to take his punk ass outside
So you can hit him, and with him
Let his momma bury him in a suit that don't fit 'em
You don't give an F-U-C-K
So just fuck him
Didn't have to shoot him, just walked out and stuck him
Knife up and down all around in his gut
Standing in his blood looked down and said "What's up?"

What's up nigger, Shock G tell 'em like Treach

Shock G:

East coast niggers are the craziest
And West coast niggers are the craziest
And down south niggers are the craziest
It seems like all american niggers are the craziest

It done got out of hand
We don't drink that potion at the white mother fucking masses
Immediate and cooked up for us and now we killing each other
Remember me all, I want everybody to look back
Yo this is Shock G from Digital Underground
I want you to look back right now
We rolling with the Dangerous Crew
I want you to look back when I said
Y'all remember that shit when I said, I said ah
America, Get busy Humpty yeah
The red the white the blue and the blue and red for crips and bloods
The white for whose got you doing time
We busting caps on one another and it never stops
You know it never stops
But you know, that Shock's been searching for someone
Who can rise like Malcom and Farahkan
To straighten you niggers out

Shit they call me MC Blowfish
Back when Digital Underground first started
Say, I was running the whole thing, say
The call me MC Blowfish hey
Yeah, and I kick a little thing like this
I say, I say, I say, I say
Shorty check me out
I say, I say

Now follow as I slip into that butter melody
This is the part Shock takes your heart and leaves you vision blurry
So try to focus on my dope
I suggest that you invest in a telescope
As I come with hella rythem
Move closer to your television
Get your look just like that hooker catch Jay ism
Even with my vocals for your ears, you still couldn't see me though
As I flavor rub this vidy like oregano
I'm slanging them nouns and verbs
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I guess I'm just a little different cause I do love them hoes
Just maybe not the same way I love my niggeros
Cause I love it when they say something fly
The ill caps make me laugh till I cry
Some frys and some freaks and it's on
All night long
I love to see my homies living strong
But then that cook with that cloudy cookbook
Rains salts on another brother's sunny day
I'm wondering if we're really happy here with this lonely G game we play

I said I'm wondering if we're really happy here with this lonely G game we play
Cause it's hella fun here, I'm not going to front on that
Yeah, niggers have booming fun
Flossing and fucking with these hoes and capping niggers
But wheres we heading as a people
Where is we heading
This is the funk session y'all
Check me out
This is Shock G from D-Flow production Squad
Cooling right now with the Dangerous Crew
Yeah I got my man Breed in the house
Breed bought to roll a fatty while my man Shorty B get on the 6 string
And blow your mind, Yeah
I got Pee-Wee in the house
And you know what Pee-Wee said
He said, He said Shock, You know that...(fade out)[Verse 1]
A brother who I love says I show too much love to white chicks
But get this, that same cat? He treats sistas like shit
Take 'em, break 'em, throw 'em out, ho 'em out to other jerks
I said "She cute." He told me "Fuck that bitch, that's just my other work"
But still he freaks her. Did I say freak? my bad son
More like use, cause he wasn't sweating her orgasm
Me? I like women. Befriend'em when I sex 'em
Always scopin', hopin' that my soulmate's the next one
Hold up though, I'm dirty. Pimped hoes after grade school
Never because I needed to, I thought that game was way cool
But I earn them chips that I burn on these whips now
From a whore I need no more than her 4 lips now
All equations, Asians don't get past me, I'm colorblind, equal opportunity nasty
Feelin' like you're missin' a little Shocklett in your coffee?
Well come through, we'll fix that
Yo D, bring that mix back

[Hook]
Black kitty, place nothing above her, I love her
And white kitty, put nothing before ya, I adore her
And all the kitties in the middle Shock will never drop you
I gotchoo, I gotchoo, I gotchoo, I gotchoo

[Verse 2]
So let's see now..
You tricked her, dicked her, made her fuck the click and dissed her
Yeah Huey Newton, you're really taking care of sistas
The best thing that you could do for all women would be to eat a jackit
Or take a Sex Packet
Vegetarian or cannibal, human being or animal, I treat living things with respect
Stop bragging to me about your Nubian Queen cause u pimp her out, I wouldn't treat a goat like that
But I hate sistas, right? Yeah, they're all sluts
Especially my momma and your momma, now what?
C'mon cat, stop hating. I hit what I wanna hit bro
Whatchu regulating another nigga's dick for?
Shock do who shock wanna do, knock up who I wanna knock up. Got it?
Stop worrying about it
Everybody's mixing it up these days, that's what I know
This whole frigging world is about to be mulatto
Some brown sugar who I used to jug-up said t me
"How come you be kicking it with that white bitch instead of me?"
Well, you tend to suffocate me when you date me
Hated me just for being a man. Dangled sex to bait me
Rationed out that love. Had my future all mapped out
You wasn't winning me, boo, u was pinning me, so I tapped out
Why we wrestling? My house can't be like this
The right chick for me won't take advantage of my niceness
Can't let the King be King? Can't be the Queen
But can't stand to see Shock dipping in that cream
Can't stand how we got stuck in that rut
Bring that butt back, I'll scrap that
Yo D, bring that track back

[Hook]
