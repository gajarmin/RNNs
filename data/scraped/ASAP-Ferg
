[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
I gotta close the window before I record
Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
Stand up

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Coogi down to the socks like I'm Biggie poppa
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
Cause you know the Fergenstein getting plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shining in the Benzo
Balling! Got me feelin' like Jim Jones, I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the buildin', semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they getting on my nerves
I ain't lying, lay 'em on the curb
Riding on a killer who be coming at Ferg! (Damn)
Girl you twerk, twerk that kitty girl make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel he gon' put him in the earth
Trinidad maniac with a all gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work
Schoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth
Polo Ground, A$AP World

[Verse 2: French Montana]
(Haaan!) That ain't Kanye
That's Montana, loose cannon
He shot me so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in it first
I just sold a swammy with ten hommies on it
Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin' for your life
Baby don't pray for me pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies

[Hook]
Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Shout out that motherland, 12 years old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga, all they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica I'm your brother
I know a bitch from VI, yeah yeah yeah that's my partner
You got a problem with it, then, then, then, then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggas and I fuck with Migos

I said all I speak is real, y'all niggas might hate me but
That don't get no deal, I said no that don't get no deal
I just now got my deal, but I been gettin' this money
No green card in this struggle, immigration give you nothing but work
(Put it in work)

[Verse 4: Schoolboy Q]
YAWK-YAWK, YAWK-YAWK!
A lotta niggas died, should've been from Hoover Street
No I do not have a car, but I could buy one every week
Pimpin' like I'm 33, move keys like I'm 36
Ship O's like I'm 28, Tacoma know I'm pushin' weight
O-X-Y I'm in your state, eatin' off your dinner plate
My heart live where Santa stay, super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip, she say she never had a crip
Uh, put in work, all big booties make ya twerk
All big titties lift your shirt, show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front the Church
Deacon said I did my shit, the pastor said, "That nigga turnt"
Pop my collar on my shirt, make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units, Captain Kirk, takin' xannies poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb ya first, turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth, had to give Young Ferg a verse

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Out of line, pistols barkin' "Ar, ar" ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress, side bitch won a beauty pageant
Got a chick that worked at Magic
But I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
See my daddy in heaven, right next to Ferg's
You know what's up I'm throwin' bucks, Loaded Lux, put in work[Produced by Snugsworth & Additional production by Marvel Alexander]

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]

Probably bumping R. Kelly sipping Cristal
So you know the whole world getting pissed on
I don't really give a fuck if you pissed off

Flacko be mobbing all day

You stuck with a fat ho, and she wanna stuff her face
To all my Dominican girls dem, all my Caribbean girls dem
All my West Indian girls dem, I done fucked a million girls, damn
With a little ting a ling ling school bell a ring
Hit her with my ding-a-ling-a-ling, maybe run a train
And tell her that my niggas wanna bang and a little brain
And she wanna hang with the gang what a nigga named (Shabba!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I was broke last week but today be a new day
Mothafuckas like cavities, cause them niggas be too fake
Walk in this bitch with the new Wang, looking like Liu Kang
With a blonde bitch that wanna snoop cane
Then she get the Batman like Bruce Wayne (Master Bruce)
I be mobbing with the A, 'til my whole body decay
I don't give a fuck what you say, my whole team like a parade
Twelvyy got bags of the haze, Illi be smoking all day
Me and Rock run trains on the ho, he be like "Bitch, don't touch my braids"
Ty Beats in VA putting producers in graves
Yams got a bottle of Henny, going straight to the face
Ty Nast got a bad ho, but she's tryna come my way

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I'm like Madoff but I made off, scheming on niggas' payoff

You should lay off on the gangsta talk cause you're fake, dog
You never pushed no yay, dawg, ain't see no keys like Ray Charles
Me and Meek in the Maybach, we get Wale and take off

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
One night I was in Santos, it was lit like a candle

With a cutie espanol, she had a booty like J-Lo
She had on leggings and sandals, you've been trapped in the bando
She has to trap in the bando, ‘cause her momma got cancer
She can’t work in the states because her green papers ain’t legal
Fuck Obama un peso, she be like grande un peso
Push the molly un peso, so she can feed her abuelo
She refuse to just settle on them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that depot
She can’t lose she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Nepo
Meanwhile I could be ruler, and ride the streets on my Benzo
So, can she get molly, so bicurious off her friends though
Cause I'm feeling birdy like nerdy but he be after the bando
She pop 30's for Birdy, now Birdy's up to her head tho'
Hold on I think I see Birdy, and Birdy killed my Cuban ho...[Intro: A$AP Nast]

See them flowers gone grow and the power gon' raise
And we came through the door, here we got us a race

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
All these diamonds in my teeth
I'm gone off a gallon of Hennessy
Better let your bitch go cause she's feeling me
And besides she a ho, she fucked him and me
And I gave her the beast like I'm Timothy
Moonwalk in that pussy like Billie Jean
And I open your chest like you Janet Jackson
And I blam-blam like you Timberlake
I put him in a lake and I penetrate
Let it sit in your face like a dinner date
Then bust open your grill, let it ventilate
And my niggas is killers, what can I say?
With a crew of gorillas like 50 Cent
And they peelin' bananas, no dinner plate
And I'm only gone ride with my syndicate

[Verse 3 : Jeremih]
Uh, lights up and I’m feeling hella cocky
I’m from the bottom tryna get some topy
Diamonds got a mami screaming “Hello papi”
Said she put in work and need it hella obvi
Bust it, bust it, she get hella sloppy
I just hate it in the moments I can’t put on IG
I noticed that your man is trippin’ but really that is not me
But if I wasn’t me then who the hell would I be?
Cameras rolling we should make a scene or two
Slip and sliding got me thinking “What would Trina do?”
She seen you staring at me, got me feeling
Like Ray Allen we get them hoes in 3’s
How we in the thug Cabana at La Paz in LV
Swimming your ocean all night, might as well go overseas
Is you rolling? Know I really roll, row with me
SpinKing go get all them hoes they comin’ home with me


[Hook][Hook: Imogen Heap]
Do just what I tell you
Don't come in any closer
And no one will get hurt
Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andre
Beef is on my entree, gin and juice that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday, business on a Monday
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway
Come be my fiancee, she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge, just a sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days
Finally got it today, swear to god my mood changed
Top off like toupees, drop off, touche
Yeah, my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy
Bounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holla at a nigga, G
Riding on my enemies, this my Ghetto Symphony

[Hook: Imogen Heap]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Whipping whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and locking up my swishas
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive forget it, war ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
'til my cardiacs arrested and my 40 ounces is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires only I
Rolling down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still touring
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain, in its purest form
Don't complain I came to reign from here forward, still noid
So crib got clear doors
Burning planes in my Air Force and all I can see is clear ports

[Hook: Imogen Heap]

[Verse 3: ASAP Ferg]
Since Rocky spit like André, I'm gonna kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée, eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Eat enjoy, when I get annoyed, know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid, body get found by a lil' fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenigga, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
Thats for talkin' how fast you could grip a nine
Damn, look how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit the crime
These niggas got the sidewalk sipping wine
Guess that’s why the ground sip the wine
Pourin liq so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died? Never!
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better nigga(La Flame)!

4 model bitches stay poppin' E
On that Booger Sugar rollin' up the trees
Spit hella game at her skinny frame
Versace frame and her dirty bean
She fuck her friends then fuck my friends
This story go, it'll never end
And if I die before I wake I pray that A$AP will be great
My momma good and my girl be late
So there'll be another me and the world be straight
Damn that nigga did his thing, he took over and changed the game
His silk shirts, Versace frames
His fly ass bitches, his tight ass jeans
His dirty Benz, his Cuban links
His big ass smile, his eyes was chinked
His brown ass skin, he was lookin' gold
He really loved, God bless his soul

Yes a nigga street, just like a curb
Young Bari high, fuckin' with the herb
Rest in peace to Selena
I listen to you sing when I'm rollin' the weed up
Mix the Cristal with Tequila
Might fuck your bitch but I don't wanna keep her
I beats that bitch, flash back to Tina
I feel like Ike when I'm on the mic
(check check, when I'm on the mic, 2 blonde dykes for the motherfucking night)
And my guys are butchers, Vera Wang, Vera Wang
Slang bitches for the brain
And 40oz bounce thug bitches with the fangs

I’m about to throw a hundred thou, I ain’t braggin’
I wanna murder the pussy and toe tag it
She lookin’ like “Ferg, you so ratchet”
I met your ass here so you know ratchet
Let’s do it on the stage, fuck a matress
Rub in it your face like ProActiv
I’m about to stick you up like a polar cactus
Keep makin’ it clap, bag know your status
Weave all in my lap, brain not so average
Her weed the best like DJ Khaled
But she out for the green like a bowl of salad
20’s, 50’s, 100’s
I’mma head to the ATM girl
Now, tell me how you want it

[Verse 2: King Avriel]
Somethin’ like a scene from “Set It Off”
Four chicks packed deep in a van with a mind to crack a vault
Screamin’ money over everything, addicted to adrenaline
Stay chasin’ the thrill until the day we’re caught
All black in July for the love the heist
Willingly pullin' wool over my eyes
Fuck it, I need to survive (fuck it I need to survive)
Strapped up to make sure they get the point across
Grab the teller tie her down, tell her not to make a sound
Fill the duffles, do it now, [feel the devil's doing now]
Before the clock comes back around
Promise to leave quietly if you give me what I need
Not really tryna catch a body, just love the feel of paper on me
And all I want is

[Hook: King Avriel]
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s

Celebratin’, bottles poppin’, panties droppin’
Are you ready? It’s going down
Pour it up, let the dances begin
They fall from the ceiling so fuck it, I’m making it rain
(fuck it I'm making it rain)
Cash to Diamond like a currency exchange
Watch the money as it falls, wonderin’ why I risked it all
Was it worth it, I don’t know
Is guilt better than goin’ broke?
I could leave this quietly, treat this life like history
But first I gotta spend this money
So come here girl and take it from me
Cause all I want is...

[Hook]

[Outro]
Pass it up, pass it up (hey we gotta get this money)
Pass it up, pass it up 20’s, 50’s, 100’s, yea ()
Pass it up, pass it up 20’s, 50’s, 100’s, yea ()
Started off this way, you got potential
A whole lot of potential
I see you[Intro]
Damn who knocking on the fucking door like that? Shit. I think that's our little friend. Hold on man, let me get that. Damn. Took for ever, step on in, let me holla, yeah. Put your coat right there. Little mama say what's up to my baby, get acquainted. Here's your new best friend. Damn, lay down right there. Chocolate and caramel, best of both worlds. She got nice lips. She got a body on her right there. My children, baby, touch me right there
– Right there? You like that?
– Oh shit. Now mama, let's see what mama taste like. Tell me what she taste like. Damn

[Verse 1]
Sipping on that Henny got me going crazy with two ladies
Looking so good, don't you want to be my baby
You lay it down ,don't play around, don't make a sound
Let me see that ass bounce, yeah
And I want you to kiss her, and I want you to kiss her back
Ooh, girl just move girl, and I want you to move it just like that
Damn baby, you can move it so good
I like the way you talk, I like the way you move
I like the way you scream, I like the way you do what yo do
The way you talk to me, the way you talk
The way you talk to me, the way you talk

[Outro]
– Hello
– Bitch, where you at?
– Minding my mothafuckin' business
– Where your broke ass at?
– Fuck does it sound like you crying? Is that bitch nigga 'bout it?
– Bitch, you better not be with that nigga Ferg
– Shut the fuck up! Nigga, stop crying like a little bitch!

– I'm fucking you bitch. And she with my bitch. I'm fucking both of them bitches
– Hello? Hello?
– Fuck you, bitch![Hook]
It's cold in the winter, baby
And I don't know when I'm coming home
The moon is shine, under the sun
Let me walk, you can run
Something tells me you're not the one
Maybe you just don't understand
So why you wonder where I keep my gun
It's in my 40 Below's

[Verse 1]
I like chicks in spandex and lumberjacks
No hat to match, razorblade in the doobie rack
Just in case a bitch act, she get her wig pushed back
Catch a fucking bullet like Warren Sapp
Cause she stay with the mac, and fuck a backpack
She rather roll up on 5-6 and headcrack
And her mom always catching fucking heart attacks
Talking 'bout, "Fuck D Ferg, he ain't worth splat!"
Cause I dropped out of school and I drop slack
Missed work, gotta get up and hear my moms yap
Just 7.15 ain't doing it
Seeing niggas chrome-out 6, and they doing it
You see the street got corners and they using it
Momma told me not to be a fool and don't loose the shit
It's cold, 40 below, gun in the boot and shit
Ready start shooting shit, like I'm Bishop Juice'n it
And you don't want to end up like Steve
With steel to your grill because you didn't wanna fucking peel
Shit is real that I kick, I'm dead broke
Can't afford to smoke so I get high off of lead choke

[Verse 2]
Have you met Mr. Lee, oh, you gotsa meet her
Back shots off the meter and the hair adds to her features
She don't wear sneakers and she don't like reefer
Classy-ass bitch and she know when I kiss her
Love when I pull her hair low when I beat her
Hit it from the back and she sing like Aretha
First black nigga that she ever pursue
She loved my dick game, and chilling with the crew
It's true, we met back in junior high school
But didn't pursue to knocking boots, but she the truth
So I respect her, Beretta in the lever
Just in case a bitch is getting clever, however
She do what I tell her, make me a grilled cheese
She ask, "Babe, swiss or mozzarella?" She 'bout tell her
Versace hottie mami grimy with the body
But won't hesitate to drop a body for her papi

[Hook][Intro: ASAP Rocky]
Yo, ASAP here
We 'bout to kill a fucking game
You know who the fuck we are
You know my motherfucking name
I fucked your dame
And she bought me a chain
And a range
And a pinky ring, bling, bling
And all my niggas here, they about to kill this shit
What you say Nast?

[Verse 1: ASAP Nast]
Hold up dog, Nast in this bitch again
Sipping Hen, staring at that white girl from Michigan
She was with a friend, fat ass fly ho
I went in for the kill, ASAP, pronto
So wait boo, 'fore we hit your condo
Got another friend with me named Whitney from Chicago
Whitney love ta model? I'm thinkin' ménage
The truck parked out from, the Chevy get Ta-hoes
Haters all in my face, can't see, blindfold
? on my feet, blew right by folks
Stuntin' on sucker niggas is what I was designed for
Dead fresh, fresh to death, I should have designed clothes
But I'm blessing these tracks, sick flow, swine flu
Y'all ain't fucking with Nast, I been nice, y'all knew
Haha, nigga that shit times two
I'm who your bitches wanna kick it with, kung-fu
But what, dog? What is you saying?
Nast in this bitch, ho, why is you playing?
Like I won't slay this stage on some gang shit?
Turn into a mayhem, beat hard, flow hurtin
Cali swag bitch, snapback, no jerkin'
Fuck work, fuck money in hands, hoes know this
Fast forward, past focus, I'm that on it
One of the best to do, I think not, you bet on it
Giant ass you be lumberjack Paul Bunyon
Hoes love it, lover never put none above it
Wanna hug me tighter than jeans ass sportin'
Carry corpses to cemeteries, that's very often
Sport fortune, Matchboxes, that awesome

[Verse 2: SPACEGHOSTPURRP]
So what I say, motherfucker
Already know I never been a sucker
See I lust ya, I want ya
Baby come home, babygirl, what's your name, Wanda?
Do you wanna get up on me?
Do you wanna bend over?
Do you feel horny?
Do you wanna feel the stroke?
It's kind of like Facebook when you feel a poke
ASAP, no joke
Raider Klan, all back and we aiming at your throat

[Verse 3: ASAP Rocky]
I wanna rock but the bitches want me, though
D&G briefs fit a nigga like a Speedo
Skinny nudie jeans, though
Boots be 40 below
He flow, 100 degrees, the jewels zero
Rockstar rap, he reps Guitar Hero
Leopard Louboutins like Speedo on Steve-O
Charge me on the game, couldn't pause me on Tivo
Beyonce, the Kanye, I got a big ego
On to that next shit, you looking at the bestest
Married to the game, treat you niggas like my stepkids
Pull up in a Porsche, niggas get nausea
Didn't write the rules but my status like the author
Just crashed the range, so I pulled the Bent out
Probably getting brains, chilling in the penthouse
Swagging on you maggot and I'm about to lay the pimp down
Christian Louboutin red bottoms come in mens now
On to the next ones, skinny jeans fit in
Pull up to the shows and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
Little do she know, I got a big ego
Automatic weapon need an order of protection
Killin Feelin all these records so my charges is molesting
Assault with deadly weapons, got these rappers feeling threatened
A hip-hop veteran, I'm a hip-hop felon

[Verse 4: ASAP Twelvy]
It's a war going on outside and we started it
Believe that or die, nigga, on some martyr shit
All my niggas on the scene like some Sparta shit
And we came to double up on that Harlem shit
We all eating, this is how it's supposed to go
Stop speaking, this is how you supposed to flow
The ins and out, never a winner's route
I never lose again, it's like every day I lose a friend
To some dumb shit, whore and dumb bitch
So a hating nigga, whore cuff wrists
I know a lot of niggas sitting in a cell now
For the shit I've done, I'm probably even hell-bound
But it's cool with me, jacking niggas' jewelry
I don't give a fuck about your foolery
Nigga keep a tool with me just to blast at you bitches
Marvelous at the top and our rags to the riches
ASAP, nigga

[Verse 5: ASAP Ferg]
On my Pokemon shit, you already know...
I said, I said, I said
I swear to God I want it all
He gon' give it to me back
And get on top (?)
Purple label sweats, I swear to god I'm rich
And once I get these many bitches, swear to God I'm in
I be on my fucking shit, toast to the Gods, tell me what God sipping now
Henny, and I'm out here and my dad was in bed
So I down a whole bottle on that bitch with the mink
I go haaaaaaaard
I'm sorry, Mama Ferg, for all of these curse words
But I'm so fucking serious
Shit I'm street, like a curb
And I'm tweaked, like a nerve
And I'm smart, like a nerd
Guess that's why my last name Ferg
Okay I'm glidin' like a fucking bird
Yeah my name is Ferg but I'm a fucking terror, ya heard?
Now I'm on some rider shit
You done got yourself in beef
Now you on some Gaga shit
Red line on some Prada shit
Now you want to know the deadline on some Project shit
Black bitch an actor, put em in some toddler shit
Pu-ray you buried then hair dyed like that Robyn bitch
This ain't no bullshit, I ain't letting no fools in
See my bitch ride that big thing, you on that little shit
Trying to make noise, you squeaking like a little pit
Put her into that dog, my attitude's a little Vick

[Verse 6: ASAP Rocky]
Next time my niggas fall back
ASAP Raider Clan and we all blacked out
Tell that bitch get it mapped out
And I fucked a bitch, now she flat out
Chest out, on the fucking floor, never hit it raw
Got a condom and I got a towel by the door
Just in case the smoke go into the hallways
Cause I be smoking weed and fucking all day
This is off the top of the dome, let me introduce my niggas before a nigga go home
We got Ty Beats, the illest producer in the streets
You know he come through with that motherfucking heat
Got Twelvy, motherfucking Twelvy, got a bad bitch, Jewish named Shelby
Got my nigga Nast in the back
Got a snapback to the back, he don't even know how to act
Got my nigga named Purrp, Spaceghostpurrp, do your bitch real dirt
That's dirty, little flirty, fucked a bitch named Purdy, did her dirty
Got my nigga named Ferg, what's the word
And you know he fucking know these verbs, give them to the curb
Got nerve in the bitch, got served, better get mine nigga, bitches got nerve
Wait your turn
[Peace out, or kiss my ass!

Walk in the strip club so unannounced
With a  brick of money hit her with a thou (owwww)

Hit it so hard bitch threw in the towel
Twerk it now to my style

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Jeremih]
Uh, lights up and I’m feeling hella cocky

Diamonds got a mami screaming “Hello papi”
Said she put in work and need it hella obvi
Bust it, bust it, she get hella sloppy
I just hate it in the moments I can’t put on IG
I noticed that your man is trippin’ but really that is not me
But if I wasn’t me then who the hell would I be?
Cameras rolling we should make a scene or two
Slip and sliding got me thinking “What would Trina do?”
She seen you staring at me, got me feeling
Like Ray Allen we get them hoes in 3’s
How we in the thug Cabana at La Paz in LV
Swimming your ocean all night, might as well go overseas
Is you rolling? Know I really roll, row with me
SpinKing go get all them hoes they comin’ home with me


[Hook][Hook]
When I die bring a hundred million roses
Pretty bad bitches making love to my posters

[Verse 1]
In my cardigans, two lugged teeth
Threw ice in it, so I feel the breeze
Two thug bitches, thinkin about them G's
Who love the hood, they'll never leave
Four model bitches stay popping E
On that buga suga, rolling up the trees
Spit hella game in her skinny frame
Versace frames, and her dirty beans
She fuck her friends, then fuck my friends
This story go, it will never end
And if I die before I wake, I pray that ASAP will be great
My mama good and my girl be late
So there will be another me and the world be straight
Damn that nigga did his thang, he took over and changed the game
His silk shirt, versace frames, his fly ass bitches
His tight ass jeans, his dirty benz, his cuban links
His big ass smile, his eyes is chinked
His brown ass skin, he was looking gold
He really lived, god bless his soul

[Hook]
When I die bring a hundred million roses
Pretty bad bitches making love to my posters
Roses, bring a hundred million roses
Roses, bring a hundred million roses

[Verse 2]
Tell that bitch that I'm Fergie Ferg
Remind her I'm rich but never flip a bird
Yes a nigga street, just like the curb
Young Bari high, fucking with the herd
Rest in peace to Selena
Listen to you sing when I'm rolling the weed up
Mix the Cristal with tequila
Might fuck your bitch but I don't want to kill her
I beat that bitch, flash backs to Tina
I feel like Ike when I'm on the mic
And my dyer butcher, vera wang
Vera wang slang bitches for their brain
And 40 ounce bounce, thug bitches with the fangs
Who fill the block up with cocaine

[Hook]
When I die bring a hundred million roses
Pretty bad bitches making love to my posters
Roses, bring a hundred million roses
Roses, bring a hundred million roses[Produced by Key Wane]

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
Up all night, I'ma do it
Yeah I made some mistakes that a nigga wouldn't change, I'ma do it again
So I hit once, hit twice, so high, had to do it again
And I'ma live my mothafuckin' life like I might not do it again
Do it again

[Hook: Big Sean]
Yeah late night texts from my ex, I'ma do it again!
Got rich like a bitch one time, I'ma fuck around and do it again
I know I ain't doin' what I'm s'posed to do, but fuck it I'ma do it again
How you feel? How I feel?
Like I made this shit real and I'm lovin' how I feel
I'ma mothafuckin' do it again, do-do it again

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
You should've motivated, but you mad I made it
Aggravated 'til I'm like, "let's get collaborated"
Now you all faced with a fake congratulations
You and your girl still together, oh I'm glad y'all made it
Yeah y'all together but when I walk in
It's funny how y'all get decapitated
And the holy matrimony's out the window when she's on my mattress naked
My MasterCard got her masturbatin'
Goddamn I made it
I'm in the MGM Grand like I own that shit
So much paper I could loan that shit
Fuck that though, I'd rather just alone my shit
Jesus piece on, I had to stone that shit
Gettin' stoned, never stuck, every day I do
My old bitch is prayin' that I never ever say, "I do"
Got success, on déjà vu
Sean Michael Anderson is who you make the pay out to
You , you be on the internet straight cyberhatin'
While I'm up in fur like I'm fucking hibernatin'
In the cold cold city, where you just gotta make it
Where the people violated then their pupils dilated
Looking like a black eye pea
I swear life's harder with a black ID
So I'ma get that mothafuckin' white money
Everytime I black out on beats

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: Earlly Mac]
I guess once wasn't enough so let's do it again
Yeah, run it back again and again
Got damn, man, I should've been on ESPN
Yeah, hit it so many times that I had her thinkin' 'bout myself just fuckin' her friend
Yeah, arm out the window with the blocka blocka
That is when the duckin' begin
I do it whatever to win
Get me money out your pockets, you don't need it, then I'm out
I ain't gotta give a reason cause I know
Never seen a nigga fix a problem if he broke
If I take a L then that be the day I smoke
Lookin' at them bitches, I'll take anyone I want
Give me what I need, but please don't give me what I don't
A lot of sex, no stress, not a lot of dates
If she ain't got no ass on it then she out of shape
I love it when I hit it from the back (that's right)
I love it when the liars want her back (that's right)
I love it when they give me money back
It's funny how these funny niggas act
Gettin' money where these funny niggas at
From the front and in the back, where these funny niggas at
From the front and in the back
Now these bitches call me God put 'em on the map
She was fallin' out with you but steady making out with Mac

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
A nigga put in work then I hit him with a little Shabba
That's just how I do it
For my niggas in the dirt, put that purp in the baby bottle
That's just how I do it
Sippin' on the purp, make a nigga's words slur
Pop a bottle in the club cause I gotta do it
Cause a couple niggas hurtin' behind bars
Never go to the mall (to them all?) screaming young Fergy Ferg gotta do it
So I'ma do it, I'ma do it
I'ma do it right now, got damn, I'ma do it
Young Fergy Ferg, I'ma do it for my mama, daddy
I'ma do it for my mama, make my grandpoppa happy
I'ma do it for Pretty Flacko, [?]
I'ma do it for [?]
That's my uncle, he was in the penitentiary
Get a bid, put a nigga in the cemetery
Used to cook the work just like culinary
Run up on his ass with the mask like Jim Carrey
Give him that clip, make a movie, Tyler Perry
Used to have the hammer on the hip like a handyman
Got y'all niggas sleepin' while y'all dreamin' like [?]
Come from the gutter
Man, I don't think you understand
Know you flyin' to Japan
My show's about a hundred grand
Now I gotta stack a band
I should do the money dance[Produced by IamSu!]

[Hook: IamSu!]
Aye, bet the money make her do a backflip
Do it for the team, homie that's it
Use to put money in a mattress
We do it all the time, no practice
I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip
I bet the money make her do it
I bet the money make her do it, make her do a backflip
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)
Ahhh ahh, ahhh ahhhh (make her do a backflip)

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I bet that money make her do a backflip
A hunnid' grand, I had to do gymnastics
But I ain't got no cash up on my plastic
They tell me I'm a real legend in this rap shit
But lets get back to this whack shit
This backflip got them girls gettin' rachet
She brought two hoes with her, that's a hat trick
I'm runnin' circles, run them hoes like a track bitch
I had to pick her up in my newest ride
The newest guy, out L.A, I stay super fly
The coupe in drive, dollar (?) on the west side
She bring that pussy straight to me, that's suicide
I'm still in the hood, I did this verse in Inglewood
With a model doing things she said she never would
I live the life these other niggas wish they could
But I gotta thank God cause I'm living good

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm pullin' up clean in a classic
I only smoke weed, nigga, that’s it
Just left a bad bitch for a badder bitch
A million dollars make it look average
Hold up, I got KK to roll up
My bank like a pay day, they go nuts
I pour up, we slow down, they go down like mayday
That's your girl she chose up, I hit it, her legs wide, she glo up
Bet the money make her do
Just seen another 20 mill, I'm tryna make it to it
I ain't even runnin' game, told her roll a plane
Girl that basic training for the game, hope you make it through it
I'mma go hard on a bitch, I'mma do my thing do my job
I'mma hit from the window, to the wall
I'mma make you go Dominic Dawes on the dick
You know I'm talkin' 'bout?

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I was in the (?) with your boy (?)
Got a couple girls, won't you hit it with that Fergie style?

Now it's time to play, 'bout to meet a couple cuties at Earth Cafe
I'm bout to have some cappuccino with some bitches, you know
I swear to God this bitch is lying, say her cousin's Cee-Lo
She talkin' 'bout how she be singing with these different people
And how Breezy wanna see her but keep it on the le-low
And I'm like, uh-huh, bitch you're lying just hop up on this fat dick
Baby you like it raw like I'm a dirty boss (?)
Take them panties off and I'mma make that pussy pop bitch

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
Bet the money make her do a backflip
It's (?) season, it's a wrap for all that whack shit
Out of state women like my accent
I need a R&B single like a Mac-10
You know the homies got it, never lackin'
Made a million of this independent rappin'
We gon' sell it all, we gon' get it back then
HB game gang, team captain
Faded off Patron, she won't leave me alone
The money make her backflip, she never going home
She dippin' in the dust and make that body rush
Girl, you know what's up

[Hook][Sample]
She love me, I'm a thug

I style in my Stussy, hoes wanna do he
Like him in a Ksubi, come get at this coochie, I'm smelling like "ooo wee"
Rubbing your booty while I'm smoking a loosie in my jacuzzi
I told that bitch, if you feel it, might be woozie, come and see me
I can hit it in a, in a movie, then I'm leaving
Out to my city, where I be breezing, I come through sneezing
Up on that track just how I do it, I'm speaking the fluent
You talking that shit, I’m one of the new kids, just spitting up fluid, bitch[Produced by Sap]

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
All that ass, Lord have mercy
All that champagne, these bitches thirsty
Verserchy, no hold up, I meant Versace

Puffin' on Cali, prolly out in the valley
Sippin' on something drowsy, bitches twerkin' like Miley
Twerk, twerk for a real nigga sellin' work
Promise I won't tell a word

North Philly nigga, but I'm laid back
Get shot in your head drivin' your Maybach
Homey D Clown know I don't play that
Sippin' dirty, riding dirty, I say hi to thirty
Call your dog,  I call my dawg and he'll buy a birdy
Try to school me, I'm getting out here early
Dope dealer, Puma life, back of this soccer jersey
Mink draggin', tell PETA I'm swaggin
All these karats like I'm tryna lure in a rabbit
Just to put it, on my jacket
What you doin? Doin' fashion

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, I walk with a limp and I talk with a slur
I might wear every single chain and mix it up with my fur
I might get every single drink and mix it up til I blur
I tell the bitch get on my lap, but don't you get on my nerves
I need that bag full of green like I lawnmow it
John Doe and all Sean Doe it
And I keep it G, yeah, I ground floor it

Yeah, and she tryna fuck me raw, unprotect
But if I don't have that rubber on it I feel under dressed
Yeah, and I got money bags under my eyes, ho, cause I ain't sleep
They all Goyard too cause I ain't cheap
Finally Famous Aura Gold is my I-N-C
And I put everything in motion like I-N-G
And when we flyin' private you could bring the gun on with us
I got this freak to 3rd base, she tryna run home with us
And I got comma on comma on comma on comma... on comma
And I ain't talking about no run on sentence
Yeah, nigga hot headed so I need that Chings Chili
Put my P up on her head like that bitch is reppin' Philly
And I wheelie in that pussy like my nigga Meek Milly
On my way to meet millis
Lawyer drafting up the deep deep dealies
I got rich decided that ain't rich enough
When I did it big, bitch, I decided that ain't big enough
Dead Pres, who you diggin up?
Who that nigga that you hating on, but just  can't get enough?
Fuck, the jig is up, little bitch

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I'm like Madoff but I made off, scheming on niggas' payoff
I never take a day off, your stash is short like Adolf, Hitler
You should lay off on the gangsta talk cause you're fake, dog
You never pushed no yay, dawg, ain't see no keys like Ray Charles
Me and Meek in the Maybach, we get Wale and take off
We got your bitch in a big house, she walk in hype like "Hey, Ross, how you doing?"
Get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors
I'm at your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor
You thinkin' Khloe don't know me, I'm in the car dashin' haters
I'm in the Kardashian, get it? I'm lyin', can't I pretend?
They say fake it 'til you make it, well, let the fakin' begin
I got a bitch with fake titties, fake ass, she all in the Benz
Them titties'll prolly fall like a ball when she bend
My niggas from Harlem and Philly all get it in
Your bitch come around then we fuckin' her and her friends
Come get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors
Come get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers

[Outro: Meek Mill]
What she do?
She, just, put, heart eyes under my pic nigga
That's my bitch nigga
Bought her a first class ticket to put the dick in her[Hook 2x]
My yute, dem boys, dem a flex
Clap with the nine, better aim for your chest (Lawd)

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
It ah ring? It ah ring
A little Fergenstein with a little Shabba Ranks
A train of Jamaican girls that love the Cuban links
Got 'em wining like Lil Kim in bikini minks
No Limit soldier with a bunch of little tanks
Hit 'em where it hurts, make them dudes feel the pain
Blood stain on what remains for two gold chains
White gold on my gums like cocaine
'Rari and Jaguar switching four lanes
Top down screaming out, "Money ain't a thang"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
I bet the lord never worries, couple niggas buried
See the good die young, gun shots then it's bury
So I'm off in a hurry, I ain't forcing no jury
To convince me, trill shit, I'm trying to stay big free
Got a budget for the lawyer, risk my freedom on the corner
It ain't worth it, making history is more important
My thoughts are soaring, smoking power, Mighty Morphin
Trip to Fiji in the morning, getting jiggy with a foreign
Look I just finished touring, Worldwide residential
It all started with a pencil, now my suite presidential
Laid up with a bad chick, that never had shit
Hold diamonds and guns, you think I'm mad rich

[Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
From a crack hole down in hells gate
To a new breath of air and a brighter day
It's a lighter way, I feel good enough
To buy a bunch of real estate, move my mother out her space
Why? Cause it's the new power anthem
And nigga, we the new black panthers
Get your hands up, we in it for the ransom
Money, power, respect: LOX gave us the answer
New World Order say Always Strive and Prosper
I know God is watching over me, wash away my sins
Now I'm in this bitch a longer stay, A$AP nigga
Tell my cousin that I'm on my way, in a hurry
Fuck a hater, I just gotta tie my waist

[Hook]

[Verse 4: A$AP Ant]
City on my back like I run a campaign
Baltimore USA, that's my domain
Used to sip mad dog, now it's champagne
Used to rock the bus, now I catch a damn plane
Got a white chick who love cocaine
Chill with filled with a young boys pain
Rob anybody that got a gold chain
From Baltimore where you here the shots rang
Peanut butter insides be the wood grain
Pull up in an all white paints #Balmain
'bout to blow like nitro, propane already

[Hook]

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
I wrote this shit in business class, give me jet lag
This for years of oppressions and the set backs
This for chinks, niggas, jews and the wet backs
Crackers towel heads and I can't forget the les, drags
This is Huey Newton with the uzi shooting
The trill Martin Luther fin to spark the ruger
Malcolm X's muslim army marching to ya block
Bring the chopper to your preacher's screaming hallejuehah!
Dear Mr. President, I'm the shit
Hello, White America, suck my dick
They say Lords Never Worry, no hope for the kids
Young blood was a thug caught slugs from a crip
My father, our father, God father
Glocks in the air, HiiiPower
This is Kendrick off a visit Jimi's watch tower
A longer, seems like Martin dreaming for the longest

[Hook][Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Talkin' big money, boy it come in thousands

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Cul-de-sac money, I got nosey neighbors
A couple packs comin', I’m at the store waitin'
Kill the fat onion, got some more paper
I keep the strap gunnin', I'm makin' dope wages
Your folks hatin', I got more paper
Your clothes basic, you see my ho tailored
All that makeup make your ho look made up
Cul-de-sac shoe strings got the hood laced up
I'm at the corner shootin' like a Pacer
“Reggie Miller I shoot a nigga face up”
And I like getting head cause I’m aimin' waist up
And if you owe me, better pay up

[Hook:  Rich Homie Quan]

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
I’m gettin' all this paper, A$AP money

They was callin me ugly, now all of these bitches they wanna just fuck me
All of my niggas they hustlin’ and killin the game, this shit is a shame
I don’t mind niggas from Harlem, I did it, and you can do the same
I took money from out the hood he good now he dont have to gangbang
All of my niggas who figured they’re bigger but left
Are left feeling the pain (No Love)
He was a rider, ridin' in that Porsche
I’m the Messiah, I’ll be the young Trap Lord
Sippin' on the Henney, tryna get a penny, wigglin' a dime, nigga I take off
Pretty Flacko did well, now watch how Ferg go off, oh Lord

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan][Verse 1: Wale]
New York get the blood money

Still counting my math, La Marina
Summertime I be in the spot
On the hood shit, smell me niggas, it’s all
DC got love for me
Young niggas sippin’ all that lean (try slowin’ them down)
Real live at the town, they be go-go’d out
I play the let out, smell me, nigga, still flat out, uh
Chilly weather, Balmain with many zipper
I’m ballin’, see my closet a dollar of Penny's in them
And ain’t talkin’ about no problems
Cause problems get finished quick with ‘em
Niggas ch-ch-chopper brat-tat-tat any nigga
Know that the city vicious
Drug dealing right here appealing
Like they some villains or something they at the hero in again, uh
Now here I come and who carries Maryland with ‘em?
The crabs in the bucket?
Fuck it I’ve been aquarium clearin’, uh
Coming through with some young Surulere goons
Rest in peace to Boo
Used to rock them Melo number two's
That was ’02, maybe ’03, oh, please
Stop it, you’re Origami, I’m finna fold crews
Uh, overseas to the back block
Uh, straight G’s where I’m at Bob
Uh, and we done seen it growing up
When the fiends get they look
They always jukin’ like it’s black rock
Spin it, you know let’s get it
Take this money, I’ma take your bitches
And no I’m not a gangsta, but I stay authentic
That’s why I go up to any place and remain unblemished
8 for the tennis, I’m great with the lyrics
The niggas upstate saying "'Le niggas tellin'" like “'Le niggas tell it"
Say the niggas tell ‘em
I swear a nigga heard I ain’t e’er been a weller
Redbone redbone, well put together
Put it in my cell, I can put it in your belly
Kentland. what’s up? Landover. what’s up?
Roll pass Ardmore, feeling local as fuck
Audemar keep it on, niggas won’t even touch
When you home and you humble you get a lot of respect
And niggas trappin’ trying to get at all the bread
Get up out of the jungle, get his daughter a bed
Get his son some gear, find a pot he can piss in
So quarters moving back and forth like it's a lottery ticket
And to be honest who gon' want McDonalds position?
No time for chicken nuggets but somehow they find all the dippers
They slipping

[Clip from Elaine]
Hey. I just spent a lot of time and I have eaten a lot of crap to get where I am today. And I am not throwing it all away now

Blood money (yeah yeah)

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Ah (blood blood)
Daddy, daddy was a legend
Harlem born, money gettin'
'til he pull an armageddon
Trigger brrrr cerebellum
Mellow at the 7/11
Mama had to call the reverend
Daddy teach your hood a lesson from the seven Mac-11
8:30 eight mack ten crack ones
Putting genocide on my Black friends
Richard Porter seen the slaughter
Alpo kinda sorta was a ho
Cause he left the whole hood in heated water, damn
Shit niggas still glorify
He had all the rides
He had all the bitches fucking all the thots
He the man, rocking Dapper Dan
With a gun in hand, Pakistan
I don’t understand how you kill your man (damn)
I don’t understand how you kill your man
Goddamn, how you kill your man over money when
Two Harlem kids in a gang do the devil’s dance
Cause the greed of money had them caught up all up in a trance

[Verse 3: Wale]
Fuck niggas taking nothing from me
Sun going down in a town, ain’t nothing funny
Little buddy on a corner with a quarter
On 'em, father with the law and the the mom trippin' off the water
Talking to herself in public
I’m looking out South Florida Avenue
Haven’t you heard of the dealers and loiterers
The trappers and murderers
I could see Sursum Corda from the Mandarin Orien
Tal, you see the glory in this?
I don't see it nigga
They keep it G, you can't see it, nigga
They see you on tees and see you on the scene slipping
You being hot, you see I’m Pac
Don’t be in public
We ain’t seen peace in these parts
Since Teen Summit, blood money[Produced by Big KRIT]

[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah

All them music festivals and shit
I can't believe MTV crowned me King Bonnaroo
Haha, shit was a party on stage, yeah

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Just got back from Bonnaroo, that shit was amazing
Girls crowdsurf to the stage for the booty shaking
Express Yourself set the tone, by Diplo
Today was blazing so they taking off their shit slow
Show them titties, show them titties, me and Marty screaming
TJ on the 1 and 2s, he got the party heating
My DJ making it far, just hope his daddy see him
Jam Master Jay Junior, I know that he can't believe it
He could be the next A-Trak, just keep dreaming
God got me on a mission, nigga, I'mma keep preaching
Lords Never Worry, point blank period
We divine and then shine through these dark demons
Flying vultures, bra leeches
Moment you want some pussy, they act like they can't believe it
They got a rap nigga like "well, at least can I see it?"
Claiming you got a man, you was outside my trailer just fiending
Giving me celibate speeches, I got a hell of a penis
Give you that crack pipe, girl, who the hell is your dealer?
She laughing now, you acting mad cause I ain't let you beat it
I play myself anyway cause you the weakest
Now I'm straight off the stage into the tour bus
Had enough of these hoes, it's time to get focused
I couldn't figure what to write
Until I mumbled some words and started on the chorus

[Hook: Wynter Gordon]
All of my life and all of my days
I never thought I would be here, I never thought I would be here
All of my life and all of my days
I never thought I would be here, and I feel it now, and my bones and my body wanna lift off

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
I spoke to Lauryn last night, man, she still got it
She performed Ready Or Not, the whole set was rocking
Skrillex brought me out before her set, I did Shabba
She said "I watched the whole thing, Ferg, your shit was proper"
Damn, Lauryn was watching my show?
Plus I came out to Juicy and I fucked that Biggie flow
But it was cool cause the crowd caught the words for me
And when I did Work, they sung the whole shit for me
Coogi down to the socks, then the crowd applaud
I'm getting rich so I gotta stop the stage dive
Ain't smoked in a minute, but I sorta get a stage high
Especially when I'm done and the whole crowd stay live
I'm tired as hell, still come out for the encore
Looking fatigued, I'm out of breath, I need to run more
Then I hit my DJ like "we got one more"
And we nod, yeah, then I go for it, like

[Hook: Wynter Gordon][Intro]
Okay, bossin' up

Up late nights pass Carson, drinkin' large proportions
Of that turn up, juice
Got your girlfriend, loose
Shakin' that ass listening to Luke
Give a nigga all hole, no loops
Give a nigga all brain, no lip
I be at the ball hanging, no grip
Pants saggin' on four fifth
My security bullets like 4 inches
Kick that shit like four ninjas
Did that shit for my niggas who
Made it out the hood to the good side
B-bossin' up with no tie
You heard it through the grapevine and I was actually there
Yeah, It's clear who's been gettin' to the bread like Panera, ugh

Wanna mingle no words to exchange
Money make her cum so it's Benjamin Frank-

And you're probably in the club gettin' played
No bitches, you gets no play
And my bitch K.O. your bitch O.K

Young Trap Lord, dime of the purp
Ride or die boy, nigga get murk
Pull a nine boy, he'll sleep in the dirt
Makin' the hoes sleep in the earth
She feel on my clothes, lifting her skirt
Say she love coke, sniffin' the work
Semi-auto Tec, guns gon' flirt
Bang, bang, let a one squirt
Givenchy my body, Ksubi my colleagues
Versace, my eyelids, Yves Saint-Laurent me
Twelvyy in huaraches, and Margiela on Rocky
Yohji Yamamoto for Ty Nast and Ty Beats
Fuck bitches that's on me, wack bitches move kindly
Last niggas of a dying breed, yeah me, myself, and Irene
Nigga hear them sirens when that four-fif' and that nine squeeze
China bitch sip sake, while I chop that ass with that Tommy

[Hook]
Ridin' in the streets, uh
So I'm ridin' in the streets
On the block, them killas ridin' with the heat
My niggas ride for the streets
And I'll be ridin' with my team, yeah
Always drivin' prosper A.S.A.P
Know it's me, F.E.R.G
T.A., bitch
