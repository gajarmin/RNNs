[Hook]

As soon as I came out the womb, my momma knew a star was born
Now I'm on the golf course, trippin wit the Osbournes

Bitches wanna marry me, they see me they just might panic

Big house on Connie V's (okay)
Get two broads, a dime a piece
Them white girls sniff a line apiece
Do it like Ozzy
Blue Mazi
On Patron like I was on kamikazes (go crazy)
Keep a whip and a biscuit
Rockstar eatin' kizzle and biscuit (and what)
Keep the waves swim
New pair of kicks
So you can "Walk This Way" like Aerosmith
And you can Run DMC in a flair eclipse

[Hook]

[Sheed]

Ay well apparently, you the only girl that can handle me
Take care of me, for various shit i can see that you cherish me
You selfishly get mad when them other bitches stare at me
Im glad to see that you can hold me down like gravity
I have to be stupid just to ever ever cheat on you
I lean on you, and in the bed the only time i beat on you
What we go through is different we fight and then get intimate
This shit here gettin' serious and marriage now i'm sensin it
I need some time just to get my thoughts, to get a piece of mind
I know that i broke your heart, so you can get a piece of mine
We been fine cuz we done made it through the decent time
They wanna know why i wanna make you my wife

You were down for me girl when noone was
When i was down and i was out you gave me kisses and hugs
I paid you little attention you always showed me love
Not knowing you were an angel from the heavens above
And when i'm down to my leg you say i got what you need
And when try to offer somethin it's hard for me to receive
Always said when i'm in need you'd be down for me
Spend a life time with me, you love and care for me
And when we out and about you show me love and affection
And when i needed some advice you answer all of my questions
I'm kind of confused right now and my mind got me guessin
I see you know what i want and to my heart you a blessin
She knows what I want
She knows what I like
She knows when i'm wrong
She knows when i'm right

I got, a few friends but one know how to get next to me
The same one thats stressin me, the one who got the best of me
I know i shouldn't mess with her cuz now she always mess with me
Why she always buck on me and try and see whats up with me
And now she gettin worse ever since i started rappin
( )
Got me goin all slappy, baby we ain't got no ties
Ain't got the nerve to say what happened to us i guess it died
I don't need no drama don't call my phone now the money comin in
And you tryna get you some, had a n**** that was good but your the one who
Choose to doubt it and she know me like a book but the sad thing about it
She knows what I want
She knows what I like
She knows when i'm wrong
She knows when i'm right
She knows what it takes to get next to me
(She knows what it takes to get next to me)

I like the flash, watch them burn, that's part of the tab
They turnin' into ashes
We got the whole industry mad
It was the swag that the cock suckers was hatin' on
That's the same swag that them Shop Boyz done made it on
You gone from having nothing to having everything you desire
And that's how you know you set the world on fire

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
We puttin' work in, hard, stayed on the grind
Set the world on fire, yep, it's Shop Boyz time
Stay stuntin' gettin' money, boy it's our time to shine
Yo, we took off like a rocket, leavin' nigga's ass behind
Heard I get money, #1 hood song
Straight from Bowen Homes, nigga, oh we can't go wrong
Eveytime we in the club, all the people go bizzare
Cuz they know we party hard like some fuckin' rock stars

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Another song is set (youuuua) it sparked the world like a lighter
Ay man we came hard
Set the world on fire
Started in Atlanta, ran all through the south
Got on deck in every city, it's Shop Boyz in every house
Put my team on my back, and i got my swag right
I look good for the camera, and i give them what they like
I got my mind right, and bitch i got bread
Grab the world by the feet, and throwed it's ass on the head
Hey

And when try to offer somethin it's hard for me to receive
Always said when i'm in need you'd be down for me
Spend a life time with me, you love and care for me
