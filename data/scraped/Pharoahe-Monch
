[Produced by Pharoahe Monch]

[Hook 1]
Get the fuck up
Simon says get the fuck up
Throw your hands in the sky
(Bo bo bo bo bo)
Queens is in the back sipping 'gnac y'all what's up
Girls, rub on your titties
Yeah I said it, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

[Verse 1]
Y'all know the name
Pharoahe fucking Monch, ain't a damn thang changed
You all up in the Range and shit, inebriated
Strayed from your original plan, you deviated
I alleviated the pain with long-term goals
Took my underground loot, without the gold
You sold platinum round the world, I sold wood in the hood
But when I'm in the street and shit it's all good
I'm soon to motivate the room, control the game like Tomb Raider
Rock, clock dollars, flip tips like a waiter
Block shots, styles greater, let my lyrics anoint
If you holding up the wall, then you missing the point

[Hook 2]
Get the fuck up
Simon Says get the fuck up
Put your hands to the sky
(Bo bo bo bo bo)
Brooklyn in the back shooting craps now what's up
Girlies, rub on your titties
Fuck it, I said it, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

[Verse 2]
Yo, where you at, uptown let me see 'em
Notorious for the six-fives and the BM's
Heads give you beef, you put em in the mausoleum
And shit don't start pumping till after 12 pm
Uh, ignorant minds, I free 'em
If you tired of the same old everyday you will agree I'm
The most obligated, hard and R-Rated
Slated to be the best, I must confess the star made it
Some might even say this song is sexist-es
Cause I asked the girls to rub on their breast-eses
Whether you're riding the train or a Lexus-es
This is for either or Rolies or Timex-eses
Wicked like Exorcist, this is the joint
You holding up the wall then you missing the point

[Hook 3]
Get the fuck up
Simon Says get the fuck up
Throw your hands in the sky
(Bo bo bo bo bo)
The Bronx is in the back shooting craps now what's up
Girls rub on your titties
I said, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

[Outro]
New Jeru, get the fuck up
Shaolin, get the fuck up
Long Isle, get the fuck up
Worldwide, get the fuck up[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip Hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars driving slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned, styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is coming look around your town is crumbling
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leaving MCs listless
On the Wake Up Show, make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher, partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9ne's vilde!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house through the front window
And heard this guy shout, "Hey that's my couch"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm ripping this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flipping vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breaking so many freaking needles, I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake Up
The X-Man, catch me doing drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting from high noon till the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was, when I cut ya neck
Leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon and spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinning like lead from out the  Heck and K
Tearing your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate
Until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to but what you gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you but what you gon' do
Rev can give it to you but what you gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fucking up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style foul file sexual harassment like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fucking murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show repping with Sway and Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One coming with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willing to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willing to bet, on a Sway and a Tec, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gaining respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just seckle
Ha-ha-ha, fresh for 1999 you suckers[Intro: Mos Def]
One for the treble, two for the bass
Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace

[Hook 1: Nate Dogg]
Oh No!
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been 7 days, the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim, I independently lay it down
And played my game, my own two raise my flame
Cause dickriding ain't my thang
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm getting it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad cause I'm getting caked out from my bookings
When y'all was asking permission I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
Cause after this year the price ain't coming down
And if you got a joint bubbling then get money now
Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble coming out
Just a warning, as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard-headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame the jealous gaze is too short to see it
But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent, or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evenin
You keep on scheming, man give me some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screaming "Lord Jesus!"
Harder than y'all cause I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down it's got to be bothering y'all
Pay attention, watch Flaco get larger than y'all
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do or die stay rumbling and bumbling hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all
East coast on your neck and you ain't shrugging it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumbling off
I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggas are the sons of New York
Getting spanked when there's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

[Hook 2: Nate Dogg]
Oh No!
Look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn, they know
We rock from the east to west coast
Queens, salute to Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages of wackness, Pharoahe's raps are blazin
And it amazes - me how you claim thug
But go two-ways without Skytel pagers
I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East L.A
More beef then deli's, thus what I vent is just
What you lust to vent, it's irrele'
Huh, hallelujah, Pharoahe Monch'll do ya
Maintain the same frame of mind - screw ya!
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, preacher with scriptures
I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leaving you mentally unfocused here
MC's just come on 'round!
You're the next contestants on "Catch-A-Beat-Down"
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment
It's evident we medicine for your whole town
Sky's the limit, game's infinite when I'm in it
All windows is tinted
How you seeing me when I'm in it?
Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that
Pharoahe's flows blows shows like afros
We hate y'all though, that's why Nate Dogg goes

[Hook 1] ×2 + [Hook 2][Sample]
Memories, like the corners of my mind
Misty watered colored memories
Of the way...

[Intro]
The good old days
Reflect with me
You know what I'm sayin'
We just sittin' on the porch
In Watts
Helicopter flyin' overhead
Lil niggas in the street throwin' dirt rocks
Feel me


[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Archaeological logic, discovered Van Gogh's fossils
To paint a perfect picture
Twelve years a slave, twenty years a spitter
Thirty seven years a nigga
Hopin' to see ninety bein' a strong black figure
As I stand and deliver
Breathe fire in Japan, Godzilla
By popular demand till the fans see that God got iller
I'm like Cornel West with scales on my chest
You superman thugs, caught Kryptonite to the flesh
See the hood got me stressed, takin fists to the neck
Multiple arrest then I discovered KRS
Let us begin, what, where, how or why
Will all be explained and if not, fam we die
Losin' granny was the hardest
Good women I fucked and left broken hearted
Turned up being retarded
Transformation to activist from an artist
Like young Mellala who the Taliban would target
Shot in the head just cause she wanted to read
Till every person sex trafficed is free, we gotta bleed
(Turned down for what?)
Cause niggas tell on themselves nowadays
Film it on Vine then wonder why crime don't pay
Candid outlandish, the dirty pistol I brandishe
Glad they didn't have camera phones when I was young doin' bad shit
Yeah, I just dated myself
I'm no spring chicken but why you hate on yourself?
For five minutes of fame
Find yourself like Kat Stacks, knocked out the frame
Locked in a cage
And ? it's true, you backwards hustlin' homie, you snitchin' on you
I'm on my Descartes, Diop, Be-Bop, Aristotle
Prehistoric talons twist the top off the bottle
My era is classic Tyrannosaurus Rex in the lab shit
Leimert Park so I pass it Jurassic

[Hook: Rakaa Iriscience]
I can think back but life goes on so keep livin'
Can't take a thing back but life goes on so keep livin'
There are couple things, that maybe I would if I could
Forgive myself for, I'm unforgiving
Yeah, I throw this drink back but life goes on so keep livin'

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
In order to recollect exceptional memories
I developed a way to transform brainwaves into binary code from energy
Translate algorithms, converted the information to digital
Uploaded compiled files of wisdom
Then projected them on a screen, vivid beautiful scenes
Extract orchestrated symphonies and heavenly dreams
The alchemist
In kindergarten when kids was asking about alphabets
I was immaculate with astronomy, mastering calculus
Seized from my parents during a scene when I was seven
They experimented on my brain up until I was age eleven
And at age thirteen I learned to literally stream
Molecules and teleport molecular structures with the beam
These are my memories, soak them in with a notion
To fast forward the bad and play the good in slow motion
Now I astral project
Analyze Guam
Study Agent Orange bring back secrets from 'Nam
The government asked me to track the locals on Islam
They asked me the whereabouts of Boko Haram
And cracked my brain for catastrophic chatter that's insane
To extract data from satellites on missin' Malaysian planes
My memories, my memories, my memories
Although from only just a week ago
My memories, my memories, my memories

[Hook][Hook: Pharoahe Monch]
Get the fuck up!
Simon says get the fuck up!
Throw ya hands in the sky (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)
Queens is in the back sipping 'gnac, y'all wassup?
Girls, rub on your titties (yeah)
Yeah fuck it I said it rub on ya titties
New York City gritty committee, pity the fool that act shitty
In the midst of the calm, the witty

[Verse 1: Lady Luck]
Yo shut the fuck up!
Luck said shut the fuck up!
Bitches in the back, like crack get it cut up
I speak on behalf of them broads you call stuck up
Act like a man and get cocked, smacked or fucked up
Pull the truck up, Luck you know the name
Ass out in the bleachers stay shittin' on the game
I suppose what you're spittin' is flames, cowards
Knew your crew was vaginal, I could smell the dooch powder
Summer's Eve, I drop degrees chill
Come four by four, lose one like Dru Hill
Stay fly till you air sick, now that's ill
Two choices, either squeeze or peel, now that's real

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
What the fuck's goin' on here, just a minute now, hold up
Sinister wit hit the time I diminish him finish him, roll up
When I'm - in a, cinematography state of mind
My rap trip, rip, flip, clip, say the rhyme
Shit, I spectacular run hit spit bitches vernacular
Miraculous rhyme flow, back track to the Immaculate
Binaca blast nigga that's fast, son I'll out-box ya
Ladies rub the ta-ta's, bras, titties and knockers on the floor
Owww! Fellas pull ya cock out
On the verge to splurge verbs for third round knock out
Uh I bust a rhyme that dust frustrated rappers
Dust crush competition, lights out like the Clapper
The mic ripper, whip a nigga like a slave
Separate him from him from his fam, he don't know how to behave
Now, drag his ass, bag dun for his loot
Figure me to give a nigger-y twenty-one gun salute
That's seven shots for 2pac
Seven for Biggie Smalls
Seven for Freaky Tah up in your neighborhood malls
How's that, fat action packed rap remain tame
Pharoahe fuckin' Monch, ain't a damn thing changed

[Verse 3: Redman]
Yo yo get the fuck up!
Funk Doctor Spock said get the fuck up!
I got a bitch named Nina and I tuck her
I leave a nigga hangin' like ya mom's muffler
Snuff her, then my boys follow up
Respect like The Fonz, you see the collar up
I spit out a bullet, load the barrel up
I kamikaze ya town off a Arab bus
Karat cut, yeah mami pull over
I bend ya pussy like for years I knew yoga
I'm too smoked up, I can't remember me
Off Hennesy, that's why I carry Mini-Me
I need fifty feet when my performance starts
I push a armored car wit (?)
Nineteen inches, I'm not on the charts
Doc turnin' dark off a warning shot
Drive off and pop, six in ya hood
[Monche]Fuck the limelight, we rhyme tight, plus snatch the goods
Yea-yeah my nigga, one rhyme and you fold over
I'm hot-headed cause I walk with cold shoulders

[Hook: Pharoahe Monch and Redman]
Yeah get the fuck up!
Simon Says get the fuck up!
Throw ya hands in the sky (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)
Jersey in the back, jackin' cars, now wassup?
Girls, rub on ya titties
(Yeah) That's right I said it, rub on ya titties
Brick City, gritty committee, pity the fool that act shitty
In the midst of the calm, the witty

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Yo yo get the fuck up!
Yo yeah I said it, get the fuck up!
Walk through Shaolin after dark, you get stuck up
Seek and destroy, baddest boy when I'm puffed up
Ya know my name, and Pharoahe Monch, why we came what?
We off the chain, plus we plottin on the game, what?
Know ya role, by the way tuck ya gold
And you and your mic can ease on down the road
Assholes are like opinions, everybody got to have one
Shootin' in the sky tryin' to blast sun
Zero to sixty in a second, pull a fast one
Fifty cent flashin' they hate us with a passion
Mashin', still fresh in three-day old fashion
Your plaid, I'm stripes, together we be clashin'
Here's a Tunnel banger
Wu-Tang death penalty, the gas chamber
This gon' hurt me more than it hurts you
Slap ya like the doctor the day your momma birthed you
Just so you can feel me
The same way I'mma feel this world when it kill me
Even if time stands still, I'mma still be
Underground and filthy, gotta have our Way like the Milky
Innocent until I'm proven guilty
Never got caught in the game of tag
Momma never kept a boyfriend with kids this bad
No justice, raider ruckus
Underground till we under ground
But y'all first motherfuckers

[Verse 5: Shabaam Sahdeeq]
My thugs, throw up ya set
And shorties rub on ya breasts
Get the fuck up, outta that dress, I palm tits
You herbs get flipped like jeeps on mountain cliffs
I'll rip through your chest, hollow-point talon tips
Double-S, double the threat, double your bet
Double up on that cash if you decide to invest
You sound like Big, you sound like Jay, you sound like D
And I bet, when I go plat, you'll sound like me
Shabaam Sahdeeq, injure your fleet into delete
Y'all crabs are weak, frail like a fiend's physique
I stay on the street, stay on the beat, stay with the heat
Stay stickin' fools like you for the rocks that gleam
So toss that link, dummy, shoulda insured that link
Straight to Canal I'll praise that link, then pawn that link
You froze up, Sahdeeq says shut the fuck up
Punk niggas get gun-butt up and tied up

[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]
Busta Rhymes is like Hacksaw Jim Duggan, been thuggin'
Lovin' the way we flood jewels for nothin'
Lay it over, another ambush we take over
Yo we don't only get money, we cut the coke and cook the shake over
You better guard your head right, especially if it's late at night
Or find your picture of your autoposy up on the web site
Yo if you ever violate my space
Fuck a fat lip, I'll leave you with a fuckin' fat face
Nigga, Busta Rhymes the handsome, I'll hold you for ransom and some
Like the ghost in a haunted house, I'll forever live in a mansion
Bitches, snitches comin' out and you know who's showin' it
Like when British civil servants pass secrets to the Soviets
Y'all niggas is seemless blends of seemless friends
Live on about (?) on a bunch of seamless ends
Collosal, me and my nigga Pharoahe Moncho
The head honcho, gettin' this money like Leonardo (Do-Do-Do-Do...)
Enough substance in the roughness
Now watch it come around in an amazing large abundance
Now let me clear the smoke screen you blow fiend
Live nigga shit that'll rebuild your whole self-esteem
Pledge allegiance to the flag of united live niggas of America
Let us control and own the fuckin area
Wildin' in your whip until you crash the whole truck up
And if you know what's good for you nigga you better get the fuck up!

Hehehe[Hook]
It's not latin, or white, or black music
It's that cooked up coke, crack music
Black Thought and Pharoahe, the rap duet
It's that lucid rapid eye movement

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure
Mega, reality, tera, giga
Grand Theft Auto, modern day Mickey and Mallory Small
But I'm sick enough to walk into an art gallery and piss on a Picasso
Crack statues, rub my balls on a Banksy shit on it and throw it at you
So when the beat intensifies
I become emotionally desensitized
Like, once I slapped a rapper with mace
Then I spit acid in his face, after he rinsed his eyes, no wait
I actually grew five times my size grabbed Ma$e by the thigh and slapped a rapper with him
Now that's practicing sacrilegious activism
Attack is for battle, and practical rap with wisdom
Actually, it's pragmatic capitalism for actors that crack under pressure and collapse when I get 'em
Monch is medicinal man made medical marijuana
With a phase plasma rifle like I'm searchin' for Sarah Conner
And shorty's got brains, shorty not playin'
From 40 blocks I'm a killa with 40 watt range
With an arrangement of bullets that I've arranged
Encrypted in scriptures specific individual names
That shall remain anonymous
Me and the ammunition's in a relationship that's monogamous
It's like I'm married to the silencer
Until I file for divorce and release my ex-calibers
Do art with your arteries, place that for my adversaries
Push your snap back cap back, cap your capillaries like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Vocally twice as magnifying as ever hearing Chewbacca scream
Through a megaphone with the significance of Dr. King
Philanthropic
Cause I'm trying to see man united without referencing UK soccer teams
My philosophy prophecy
The opposite of Mephistopheles' eye inside an isosceles
Sent to Earth to warn of environmental atrocities, and nobody can copy me
Stop, it's not possible but probable that it's only philosophical mockery, strange
Change copper to gold, switch properties, bang!
Stay on top of the globe, flip monopolies, aim
Take stock in the soul, spit properly

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Take stock in the soul, spit properly
That extended clip on my hip sits awkwardly
I'm diabolical, follicle triggers that I cock and squeeze
Sending shots to ancient Greece to pop Socrates
I bear arms like button-downs without the sleeves
Manic depressive and possessive like apostrophes
My psychiatrist waive the doctor fees
When I wave the pistol and say listen, quit watchin' me so I can breathe
National Association for the Advancement
Of drugs for performance enhancement
And it's tough taking so many chances
But I've been a bad seed from the womb, they call me ovary cancer
And I got an ugly heart, although I'm totally handsome
And I take the love of your life and hold her for ransom
And my tactical cam that never stood for any national anthems
Whats hood, I am the actual answer
And I'll prove it
Black attire, rapid fire, rapid eye movement
I'm from a species that is higher, I am not human
Extraterrestrial alien, a monster killer of conscience chillin'
In a barrel of lobster
Ex-Slave, sadomasochist, I that gave the massa of my ass to kiss
A dyin' breed, I'm the last of this
Black is as miraculous as Jesus of Nazareth
When I vocalize the crowd rise like Lazarus
It's the Rhode Scholar, my coat collar piss off PETA
Your hoes holla, he's on top of the bars
Meet a Mr. Globe Trotter in my Adidas
Pure cheetah, hoppin' out of this exotic European 4 seater
Hollerin' cheeba cheeba like I'm Parkside
Killin' is the dark side
Villain, I'm God, I'm Godzilla
Sometimes I'm Bob Dylan put blood on these tracks, for real
So, God-willin' you'll feel what I'm spillin'
Yeah, I never quit, I'm still syndicatin' up
Me and Pharoahe Monch, did it for the benefit of us
This is straight razor behavior, I never get enough
Get the picture, my militia gettin' ignorant as fuck

[Scratches by DJ Revolution]
Yea, it's suicide murder
Straight from the underground through the fiber optics
Pharoahe, Black Thought, complete the cypher
The movement outlandish

[Hook][Hook]
Gotta move on
Gotta let go
Would've opened my eyes, if I would've known
After all of this time
Took my heart to mend
That I'd turn around, and be broken again
(2x)

[Verse 1]
They told me to see the glass half full cause some see it as half empty
I chose to see the glass twice the size it needed to be
Smashed it against the wall in the kitchen
On the floor going through withdrawals I was itchin'
She rescued me, my heroine to the end
But then she morphed into heroin in a syringe
Around my bicep, I would tie a shoestring
Tap! five times to find a vein in there

Squeeze 7cc's so I could see the seven seas
And CC all my friends so they could see what I was seeing
But what they saw was a despicable human being
So, I guess they just wasn't seeing what I was seeing
Convert two into one, an indivisible plan
To discover what dreams may come for this invisible man
Sentimental education, beautiful weather
Dam was constantly catching fire
Richard Pryor
Her skin deteriorated
Family infuriated by the myriad of tracks but my train never came
So humiliated, started begging for change
Failed rehabilitation so the scars still remain
Nice clothes became frayed
So isolated and afraid
I smell like an animal my teeth enamel decayed and
I'm relocated in Alabama now
That Maalox and Mylanta now
And it won't stop the burn
Constantly searching for the answers how
I could kiss the sky without enhancing
But, it's so hard to learn

[Hook][Hook 1]
Please lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Please lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Damn you that lost the will to live

[Verse 1]
Pissed on the motherfucking White House lawn
I threw a rock, then I ran
Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the grip of the man
Y'all wanna ask me who's sane
These biological gasses are eating my brain
Its a political grab bag to rape mother earth
Thirty seconds after they bagged dad for what he's worth
Thousands will die now so millions can smile later
This ain't the Rockford Files nigga
They stockpile data for satellites
Where you discuss who's style is greater
In this killing pool you playing it cool like Cal Tjader
When ya'll ready to rock like Led Zep and Al Qaeda
With weapons of mass destruction an hour later
What's your identity today?
You on some John F. Kennedy or Timothy McVeigh?
This Henessy done left me with a remedy to spray
For my identity your life is the penalty to pay
Motherfucker

[Monch] {Crowd
[Y'all ready to rock?]
{We ready to rock
[Y'all ready to roll?]
{We ready to roll

[Hook 2]
My life is all I have to give
Please lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Damn you that lost the will to live
Trapped in the game
Just tryin to win (3x)

[Verse 2]
Its not a Vietnam song
I know women from desert storm who came back deformed
Missin limbs and disease and they legs is numb
Chemicals twice as strong as agent orange
Its messages in the bass drum
War goin off in your mind
No man is safe from
Its not a Game Boy, X-Box or PlayStation
Its Resident Evil when every President's a mason
Robbin y'all fools like Dick Grayson
And y'all inherited roots and don't know how to retrace them
Place them back
Face them facts
Disgraceful, faceless, tasteless acts
Pharoahe takes the authorities to court
Peep crime before it happens like Minority Report
And I will never be mentally defenseless
Catch me on the block, in the hood in the trenches sayin[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
The system, can never stop what's been set into motion
Like volcanic eruptions on the floor of the ocean
My purpose is to burst to the surface
Immersed in the smoldering lava from verses
Surrounded by, murder mamis not bitches that's worthless
I cut chicken heads off, like hexes and curses, weapons I purchase
Make Homeland Security nervous; I run, pockets and purses
Like subway searchers robbin masonic temples disguised as churches
I'm busy so I'll leave that one for you to interpret
Three serpents of merchants from military industry murder
The beef is eatin up, like the mad cow in your burger
Fathom the cause of cattle cannibalism
Factory farms, are like a fuckin animal prison
The microcosm of, Adam Smith's capitalism
America's pagan religion given as the mark of the beast to the Christians
A destruction of, Babylon, that's my mission!

[Refrain: Immortal Technique]
Everywhere Tech and them go, the Feds watchin us
Clockin the world through satellites like binoculars
We fight for the release of political hostages
Motherfuckin right soldier, this is the apocalypse!
Everywhere Tech and them go, the Feds watchin us
Clockin the world through satellites like binoculars
We fight for the release of political hostages
Waitin for 2012's burning apocalypse

[Verse 2: Akir]
Sex, drugs, and murder, webcams and burgers
Check scams and lurkers, test scans to purpose
Sect crams to further, death plans and workers
Get canned you nervous as you step, plan that hurts us
It's demand to be purchased, we can care if you serve us
We programmed to be perfect, frequent handed the serpents
An amazement on purpose, see I'm amazin my earners
But now the tables is turnin, got my hand right on that curtain
Hit the stages and burn it, with these pages I earn this
Can't take it, I'm nervous while fake enemies perp'in
Foul energies worth and, crowds' ears'll be perkin'
Take it somethin disturbin and it's hurtin for certain
Yearnin to get my turn in, workin to get a word in
Been in the scene observin while I'm learnin how the system's worked and
Capitalistic merchants tryin to make a million urgent
Constructive revolution confusin how the world's burnin'

[Refrain x2: Akir]
Everywhere I get 'em go, the beast watchin us
Know we got the spot in control, they got binoculars
When we be, out on the road they try to follow us
You never gon' silence this, this is the apocalypse

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
You have now acquired an old cyrus hybrid, work 'til my third iris
Chip inside my brain projects scriptures onto my eyelids
Celibacy, virtual sex, avoid the virus
Secretive shit that I did will put the city at high risk
The mentalist, the temple that houses the wisdom
It's like, Malcolm X calculus amalgamated algorithms
They say "Pharoahe, teach me about the system"
Nigga boot me in your computer I'll give you acute astigmatism
See through Windows, Word, Pharoahe's the Mac Intel
Bit off the Apple, plant seeds, spit crack Excel
Lyrical FireFox, the verbal Explorer
Who metaphors the industry to Sodom and Gomorrah for ya
They profit from water, they'll profit from oxygen
Pharoahe the prophet says that this is the apocalypse
We livin in these last days, use your optics what the topic is
The coppers got binoculars, they'll probably try to knock us cause

[Refrain: Pharoahe Monch, Immortal Technique]
[PM] Everywhere Pharoahe goes, the Feds watchin me
[IT] Satellites observin the fulfillment of the prophecy
[PM] Middle fingers up to the sky with no apologies
[IT] Cause none of you got an apocalypse insurance policy
[PM] Everywhere Pharoahe goes, the Feds watchin me
[IT] Fascism breakin out of the cocoon of democracy
[PM] Middle fingers up to the sky with no apologies
[IT] Iraq was just practice for the urban war philosophy

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Ha ha ha, AH-hahahahaha
It's burnin in here, call the Fyre Dept
Akir, aiyyo Pharoahe
They ain't never gon' find this shit man
Ha ha ha ha, like the weapons of mass destruction[Intro: Pharoahe Monch & Jean Grae]
In 2013, the World Government placed sanctions against freethinking individuals in order to force people to adhere to one way of life
An independently funded organization called poh pih evas nac ew dna eerf rof cisum gnidaolnwod gnikcuf pots hired one hundred assassins to infiltrate the headquarters where files were kept
Of these one hundred, ninety-seven were captured, tortured, and executed
Only three remained
The third of which was said to own an arsenal that would rival an entire city's police force
The second was rumored was to be able to move throughout space and time And the first... (One)

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
Fasten your seat belts for the last of the three assassins on earth
The first flashing her purse where a heat stealth
They call me Jean McCoy, beast in me employed, deploy deplorable
Through audible destructive actions, attractive decoy
Then pass it to Troy after I'm passing your life over
He'll deliver it through river Styx, Hades, I'm cold, deliberate, ladies
My foes limited, pray me some praise (whispering)
Stay on your toes villains, it's Grae and your day's whittling
Blistering lines packed in six, stick to spine
Wracked with a sick mind, trapped in thick bitch frame
Drug you with strychnine in nine drinks, you drunk, and it's my
Kidney, you dickbrain, I'm just itching to slit veins
Stitch lines, Rick James, fuck yo lives, sip brains, bitches
Niggas, kick rocks, or kick rhymes, it's to the pain
Liquor riddled liver, sieve in it, sipping it like Capri Sun
Ignint as ever, she's clever, equivalent be none
A ball breaker, call fakers out with passion
You got the gall, bastard, to brawl with the broad brashest
The ball's in your court, pass it - but warning - fall faster
Than asses with age slack on the back of a Kardashian
The walls crash in, you all on the floor gasping
The gas pour in the corridor, racking your jaws, blacking out
Catch Grae backing out the back door, cackling
Still make it back to the bar for last call

(Two)

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
They ask me why I'm highly regarded, this God body probably
Monch is a mixture of Marcus Garvey, Miles Davis and Bob Marley (radical)
Never skateboard slang like gnarly, more like:
Weed in my whip on the way to get top like Charles Barkley
You are hardly prepared to spar with a marksman - spark me
I'm Gambit with the ace of spades, a master in archery
Vehicular, particularly the vernacular
Specifically the fit so when I spit it it's spectacular and accurate
When I attack I'm more legend than Acura
Flip Bloomberg the bird, bitch, more blood than Blacula
More Crip than cryptic scriptures encrypted with backwards vernacular
Plus sicker than most like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction
I am that nigga for real
Per capita smacking the next rapper that uses the term swag or thereafter
These three assassins get to ass whipping
Prepare to for a professional ass that can
Shape shift, spit, hollow tip clips mainly
Sick, ain't he - mind control
Make you shoot your best friend in the face, Dick Cheney
My life is like a documentary film depicted in black and white
Flick's grainy (geronimo)
I'm on Guantanamo Bay taking pics in a Captain Morgan pose
With my left foot on a pile of detainees screaming
"We are renegades!" Fuck you. Pay me

[Skit: Pharoahe Monch & Jean Grae]
(Jean Grae) Two. Where the fuck...no. Where the fuck is Three?
(Pharoahe Monch) I know. I know. He's gonna be here. He gave me his word, trust me
(JG) Yeah, but he does this every time
(PM) He's gonna be here, trust me
(JG) He's gonna ruin this mission for us again
(PM) Look, here he comes now
[Car crash]

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
I be riding round with a stripper-slash-burlesque model
I make it pop like my cock in a Durex condom
I'm a opposite artist I find irony in going
From being like a stone in the grass to rocking the Garden
The same irony as going from fully automatic in the backyard
To having the whole machine behind me
I take my Australian bitches and show her some other thangs
She know my stroke is deadly so she gave me bloody brain
Don't try to get familiar, if I don't feel you in person
I'll flip the script and I'll accidentally kill you on purpose
The bad is what I'm flailing, I got so many furs
PETA gonna paint splash me when they see me no matter what I'm wearing
Your bitch about to open up, sniff some blow off of my dick
Guess you could say she on my coconuts
I'm on point like Chris Paul
You on point like an Atlantic City hooker that licks balls
I'm about to flip in this bitch like Dominique Dawes
And shut shit down like a car when it stalls
I am the deadliest rapper, you claiming that you flow like water
But really y'all niggas Evian backwards
Marshall hit the jackpot with this flow that I got
I know when I'm hot, it's my show to stop, holding my crotch
My whip cleaner than Amish men in honest ends
Two dimes with me like I'm a twin cause I'm a ten

[Pharoahe Monch]
Okay... I'm in[Verse 1]
Totally intoxicated when he drove across the state line
Rapper gone insane, story on Dateline
Lost his wits, didn't take his meds
When they pulled him over, this is what he said
I'm a Bad MotherFucker man (shut your mouth)
Well we talking about Pharoahe
Mashing in that Aston Martin on the Verrazano Narrows
Greatest of all time in the latest apparel
80's baby, ladies crave me on some Mercedes shit
Go tell your favorite rapper eat a bag of baby dicks
They keep singing the same ol' song
I'm a bring 'em the pain for saying the name wrong
Got me going insane I'ma ask you again

[Bridge]
Who put these pussies on top
Putting out that pussy music, call it pussy pop
Playing them pussy games, sucker shit
Fucking around but they don't know just who they fucking wit

[Hook] (x2)
I'm a Bad Motherfucker man
Universal, worldwide, you know my circle
Renegade, on the mic I might just murk you
Putting in that work, cause I do work, every verse is a virtue

[Verse 2]
The best liar told a lie inside a room full of liars
The lie was so exciting that all of the liars admired
When the truth walked in the building every liar retired
Deception was defeated and deceit became deleted
Uh, they mad cause they can't stop me
Cause I said fuck swag I got moxie
Lyrically ecstasy I got that oxy-contin poppin
They can't carbon copy or mock me
Reign, independent off the books
Off the chain off the hinge off the hooks
It's not a game, I'm not a rook
"Y'all Know The Name", you love the look, listen

[Bridge] + [Hook]They don't dig the urgency

Okay, so boom like
I'm at the bar right, I'm at the club
I'm chillin' at the bar
I got my drink, you know I drink my Grey Goose
So I turn around with my drink in my hand
Shorty all over me, you know what I'm sayin?
Everybody lookin at my face like "Yo what you gonna do?" you know what I'm sayin?
So I'm like, yeah I'm lookin at her and like...

Wooo let me adjust myself
She making it hard, I don't trust myself
But you throwin it back, I might bust right here
You dancing like you're really tryin to f*ck right here
If you don't feel that roll of quarters, move that bubble back whole at boarder
And if you turn around and bend, I will show you one and again

She said "who you know how you get a nine in the club?"
I said "that's not a nine ma, that's merely a eight, but if I buy you drink could we go out on a date, cause you sound like you wasn't born inside the empire state"
She said "I'm not from here, it's hot in here, but you're popular, so I'm not secure"
Everywhere she was walking dudes was stoppin her
The smoke was irritating to her occular
I said "your contacts"
She said "huh?"
Give me your contact
I'm going to the bathroom, can you buy me a cognac?
Okay, okay...

Ooh ooh, you sexy (sexy)
Baby won't you let me (let me)
Baby, oohh
Show some secret thangs to you
Ooh ooh, you sexy (sexy)
Baby, won't you let me (let me)
Baby, oohh
All the things you want me to

I got you hennessy n coke, but shoulda got a diet cause if you watching your calories, now where's my hospitality?
And if I got it straight... shiet, what if it's straight?
Cause after a couple of those you start to relate
She dancin' better than savion, workin' her lady charm
Battin' her eyelashes, finaglin' her baby arm
And all up in my space, next day I'm on her myspace, top eight
We contemplatin a hot date
Got poolside flicks for the cool fly blogs, with the rules I kicked about the yuletide logs
She like low cut jeans with the real high clogs and dig music so much she got two iPods
I'm tryin' to make it to third base like A-rod
Throw a couple of guinness stout back just to stay ? now let's just say, I'm tryin' to get horizontal like yesterday, she say..

Ooh ooh, you sexy (sexy)
Baby, won't you let me (let me)
Baby, oohh
Show some secret thangs to you
Ooh ooh, you sexy (sexy)
Baby, won't you let me (let me)
Baby, oohh
All the things you want me to

All the things you want me to[Hook: Pharaohe Monch]
Nigga, when they see him they say that's that nigga
His last name should be that's that nigga
Sound kinda nice, that's that nigga
Never catch him with them plastic half-ass niggas
When you hear it you should hashtag niggas
Since birth, a little bastard-ass nigga
White people do not recite the chorus
If you do we'll wash your mouth with Lavoris nigga

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Listen, and the boy better
I do it for real, you acting Andrew Lloyd Webber
Real McCoy leather from the back of the cow ass
The culture power will kill you, fuck it the four blast
I said the same thing twice
Telephone gun, my nigga the thing ring twice
You a cock diesel, nigga extra ginseng type
I'm a pop eagle, nigga when the thing ring Price
Sean is the first name
Fifth fire first, motherfucker, the first flame
Earthlings leave their face in the street
You pick up your face and wait for police
But the father do floss
I make your mom suck my dick with barbecue sauce

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Bafa shiki
Four fifth knocking you, rocking you, Dahved Levy
Pop your beanie for rocking a hot bikini
Transgender, blam-blam leaving your man injured
You perpetrating a fraud, penetrating a Floyd
Wild dance moves, you be demonstrating on boys
Two slaps and I'm deadin' you
Give a nigga a lesson on how to catch a predator
Nigga, I'm a wild on every
Nigga crossdressing, the essence of Tyler Perry
Fucking can-can dancing, blam blam and son
Shucking and jiving, man-tan advancing
I show no love
Bozo thugs when you throw those duds
I ain't believing in y'all
Make your mom suck my dick with blue cheese on my balls, P

[Hook][Hook]
Behind closed doors we go to war, all out
Heroes turn bitch and have to crawl out rich
To fall out snitch to switch to out of bounds shit
Flip, knock the wall out
Danger, niggas is prone to clear the mall out
(Repeat x2)

What is a scorpion? A animal that stings
I'm like a bat with blood coming out the wings
You should never in your wildest dreams
Shit on a nigga who resides in the borough of Queens
Strong wicked, in the Lex on the celly
Now you getting fucked without the K-Y Jelly
How I made it you salivated over my calibrated
Raps that validated my ghetto credibility
Still I be packing agilities unseen
F'realla my killing abilities unclean facilities
For more inter-military tactics obscene extreme confidential
My exterior serene with the potential of a killing machine
Ex-Marine you drag queen, we tag team
Queens finest the alliance defiant we bag fiends
The fuck you looking in my face for nigga?
I mace mics and then lace the bass with figures

[Hook]

Decapitate his ass, smack him, slap him in the back of the truck
Exasperate the life of his man and then pack it up
Cut off his hands and send his girl multiple finger sandwiches
If she manages to do damages, put her in bandages
The amateurs, bananas is the unanimous
Way we choose to live, scandalous
Even with doorknobs you couldn't handle us
Pharoahe's the host, the audience, and the motherfucking panelist
My mic's equipped with laser sights so that command'll miss
Never you Devils, my level's that of a high evolutionary rebel
Third rock from the sun to me is only a pebble
You coming with the corn shit that get forwarded
Like bitches licking clitoris in a porn flick

[Hook][Refrain: Phonte]
I say open the door, let me in
Teach us all, preach ya sins
Turn the cheek, let it slide
Give me five on the black hand side
The black hand side, oh
Oh, oh the black hand side
The black hand side, oh

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Give me five on the black hand side
I’ll tell you what I see through the black men’s eyes
Fly chick, in the Cadillac a black man rides
But every different day a different black man dies
Shawty momma tripping off a crack, mad high
Now you’re watching TV, loving the bad guys
Piss-poor with the Welfare check, you know we’re African
Cause we ain't get help here yet, no help
Now he puts down his knapscak, Got a crack pack
You don’t overstand if your vision ain’t abstract
Me and the projects, a lot of us is lab rats
Voted for Obama, hoping he wouldn't have that; don't have that brotha
Now I can tell you that I felt that, I felt it
I still remember how the cell smells
I still remember how the pigs at
Family crime up on the B.I. couldn't dig that
Open the door and teach your soul
Passin' the blunt around, and hoping to reach his soul
Now give me five on the black hand side
Ghost to Pharoahe Monch watch the black man ride

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Pharoahe's a Navajo chief, the way I'm making it rain
But never for a stripper with emotional pain
You wouldn't despite system nourishment for the brain
Cause rain plus soil equal fruits and grains
My hood told a nigga: keep it simple and plain
Let me explain the game, break it down a couple levels like Tetris
These young'ns kill they own blood for a necklace
Leave slumped over the wheel of your Lexus
Smoke kush, wake up and eat breakfast
What the fuck he expect
A generation overly obsessed with mobsters
Our revolutionaries won Grammys and Oscars
Impostors, fake auras and weak chakras
Makin' a mockery of the music to be pop stars
And they say I'm insane because I see the remains of the whips and chains
In my hood where it ain't all good
Peep the pain of a single mother, she struggling
Young child slain
Give me five on the black hand side
Let’s maintain like it’s Soul Train keep and move it together
I’m saying

[Refrain][Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, Ayo, these duffle bag niggas is lame hoes, I flame those
Your papa should have left you as stain on clothes
I rock heavy metal, eighteen carats or better
Blue Steel or Beretta, I'mma stack that feta
Guacamole, my shit is fat, I call it Roly Poly
Niggas is screamin' like, Damn Ghost holy moly
The baddest bitch is walkin' two steps behind me
Cause the god's robes flaring out, shit I don't care about
One false move on the kid, I'm airing out
Dumpin', pellets be hop skip an' a jumpin'
With the automatic shotgun, hand on the pumpin'
Dum, dum, watch your whole body flop
And wild the fuck out, I'm like a bull in the china shop
Beasty, I can walk on cut glass, I bust ass
Niggas better cover they face or get slashed
Or see me an' ya granny in the yard gettin' trashed

[Hook: M.O.P.]
Ayo back out, give em the whole thing, Black out
Squeeze until it spring break nigga, Black out
You run out of bullets then swing nigga, Black out
Don't give a fuck about a thing nigga, Black out

[Verse 2: M.O.P.]
[Lil Fame]
I chant warrior songs for all my warriors gone
Spit the blood, sweat, and tears, y’all just call it a song
Yes I’m highly explosive, Yes I’m something ferocious
Niggas fuckin’ with my nerves like multiple sclerosis
Watch out, you’ll get your food ate
Give em a buck and a half across the face and scrape the plate
I lift your motherfuckin hood up like a mechanic
And leave you layin for life in your hammock, god dammit
This is marksmen

[Billy Danze]
My niggas is prone to black out
Double-handed out the Chevrolet until it max out
Mo Ps is Gs, these niggas tap out
Buck-a-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck, push your back out
If you don't know what that's bout, pack up and stab out
Make a decision or deal with conditions when I spaz out
Unload, reload, unload, reload
Hand 'em a couple more, and keep a couple for the road

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
Pull out the ratchet, this is not rappity rap shit
It's, liver then Super Fly saliva when the MAC spit
That, raat, tip-tip-tip-tip-tip tap shit
That you cannot stick to landing like Gabby Douglas when you backflip
My Hammer Dance'll make y'all niggas do The Running Man
'77 blackout, Berkowitz, Son of Sam
Understand what you working with is WordPerfect
The earth surface is most prolific circuit breaker break your circuits
Enter your information, we blacks out
Spontaneous combustion, instantaneous gentrification
Pop your melon like Gallagher, you won't survive
Psychopath with a silencer, my caliber is forty five
Tumultuous tragedy, infamous, infamy
These egregious statistics will increase exponentially
Potentially, my brain is probably twisted
This auto shotty lifted your body and dropped it like a molly
Kid shitOh!
Oh!

I've got just what you want
You've got just what I need
You want my body baby, so let me plant the seed

You are my heart's delight
You set my soul a fire
I wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot

Pharoahe's that nigga and the other thinking it's wishful
Sick wit it with a ridiculous flow
Take over, make over, move over
Show's over, flows over, who Told ya?

It's a down, except I flipped the script tho
From the window to the wall just get low
Rock and roll, hip-hop music, and disco
T dot O to Atlanta to Frisco

Rufis, oh yeah, with a new twist oh
So y'all can get a gist of the rhyme that I do not miss. I will not fail
Please take a glimpse at the time at your own risk. I will not bail

Fuck da boys, grab the flock. The planet rock
The fiends and the fan on the block
Team's scheme on the knock
My hand, you want, dreams of your man

Oh!
Oh!

I've got just what you want. (What I want)
You've got just what I need. (What I need)
You want my body baby (Body baby) So let me plant the seed. (Plant the seed)

You are my heart's desire. (Heart's Desire)
You set my soul a fire. (Soul on fire)
I wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot

Grab the master's plans with ease
Those seeds can't see past me
No patch in the plan, the raps are not flash
Free at last- We never recycle the same songs from last week

Thank God almighty , we are free at last
We went back to ash, before raps harassed me
No relax. Do not pass. Do not ask me
But you can get backstage where you can see ass free

Elope- The Goat
Nigga vote for ya boy
I hope ya lied to the rope and the board
Smokin the dope
Relate to the gate
To the words you wrote, with the moving the scales ya say:

I've got just what you want. (What I want)
You've got just what I need. (What I need)
You want my body baby (Body baby) So let me plant the seed. (Plant the seed)

You are my heart's delight. (Heart's Desire)
You set my soul  . (Soul on fire)
I wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot

I've got just what you want. (What I want)
You've got just what I need. (What I need)
You want my body baby (Body baby) So let me plant the seed. (Plant the seed)

You are my heart's delight. (Heart's Desire)
You set my soul a fire. (Soul on fire)
I wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot

How's everybody feeling out there?
You want my body baby?
I'll give you my body baby
You want it
I'll give it to ya
(mumbling)
You want my body baby?

Thank you very much. Goodnight[Verse 1]
America the ugly raped my mother
Deceived my sister separated my brother
Murdered my children hung my father
Now they want me to rock the vote the fucks why bother
Seen the commercials for they army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn I said never
My mind's too sharp my brains too clever
My spine is too strong every line pulls your lever
Limitless rhymes for the indigenous the remedy
PLOT! Gettin' my money like the Kennedys
FLIP IT! Put em' in stocks collect anemities
ROCK! roll behold my epiphanies and
Read em' and weep, heat em, I beat em' to sleep
Mislead em' til we even-Steven defeat em' with freedom of speech
And let em' know that I'm the motherfuckin' fire-starter
Piss on the constitution then burn the Magna Carta

[Hook]
All I know is what I feel
Deceive my eyes and distort what's real
Only truth will set you free
I'd rather die on my feet than to live on my knees

[Verse 2]
We dying over black gold they harvesting the sand
Presidents living marvelous they starving in Sudan
It's obvious you walk a blind bath to oblivion
The book of judges read the scriptures unlike Gideon
Light my fire, start my engine
When Pharoahe becomes Moses it's medicine for who listens
A veteran with a mic bringing prophecies to fruition
Motivational verses under adverse conditions
You're, caught in the mainframe I've seen the maze man
They watch you from the streetlights you and your main man
The bar code around your neck same as your name brand
You're lost in a strange land no thoughts of a game plan

[Hook]

[Outro]
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta, Carta, Carta (Fading out)[Hook]
Gotta move on
Gotta let go
Would've opened my eyes, if I would've known
After all of this time
Took my heart to mend
That I'd turn around, and be broken again
(2x)

[Verse 1]
They told me to see the glass half full cause some see it as half empty
I chose to see the glass twice the size it needed to be
Smashed it against the wall in the kitchen
On the floor going through withdrawals I was itchin'
She rescued me, my heroine to the end
But then she morphed into heroin in a syringe
Around my bicep, I would tie a shoestring
Tap! five times to find a vein in there

Squeeze 7cc's so I could see the seven seas
And CC all my friends so they could see what I was seeing
But what they saw was a despicable human being
So, I guess they just wasn't seeing what I was seeing
Convert two into one, an indivisible plan
To discover what dreams may come for this invisible man
Sentimental education, beautiful weather
Dam was constantly catching fire
Richard Pryor
Her skin deteriorated
Family infuriated by the myriad of tracks but my train never came
So humiliated, started begging for change
Failed rehabilitation so the scars still remain
Nice clothes became frayed
So isolated and afraid
I smell like an animal my teeth enamel decayed and
I'm relocated in Alabama now
That Maalox and Mylanta now
And it won't stop the burn
Constantly searching for the answers how
I could kiss the sky without enhancing
But, it's so hard to learn

[Hook]"A broken heart"

Her apartment was wallpapered in 2Pac posters
She used playing cards as coasters
Rusted pipe cockroaches
Voted most likely to succeed
They was right all she do now is suck-seeds
Clutch-clit, suck-dick while she puff weed
In the bathroom, bandaids for her scuffed knees
With her hand chop a mountain down, you know where her nose at
Running where them hookers and them hoes at
Before the Paxil and the Prozac
She used to beg a nigger for the bozac
Now all I ever hear is where the doughs at?
The prada bags, Clothes at
Took my heart, froze that
Promised that if I opened it up it would never close back
It was a love so solid
Plans to deliver the ring like Frodo the Hobbit
But you cut me off like Lorena Bobbit
On some bullshit, when we was just getting started
And I can see it inside your face I'm in your space
Right people just need to move at they're on pace
But my advantage is, Seven spiritual laws and anger management
Seven spiritual laws and anger management
Seven spiritual laws and
"A broken heart"

I saw you at the knicks game
Damn you look good now
Your new man is a bitch though
Shoulda seen the way he switch-yo
From my head I might remove this gun
Live my life to the fullest have fun
Some Dr. Atkin shit no fun's cause
99 problems and a bitch ain't one
Streets of new york walk into the sun
On some Martin-luther King we shall overcome
Dismantling biz, he's back on his grizz
Dismantling stress, he's handling his
Plans for summer tours and for various projects
I'm so focused now I can see through objects
Show how I can make some positive progress
Time is now, Oh so obvious

"A broken heart"[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]

I was determined as damaged, psychologically
But still managed to gain a new perspective on the term
"Surround yourself with greatness"
Found myself standing in a room full of mirrors
But even my reflections disrespect you like a freshman during hazing
(What an amazing assessment)
The police booked me for Booksmart but who the promoters book now?
Raised the bar so high that the bar's afraid to look down
Spent nights in a casket, at dawn/Don I'm a King
Play pawn to a queen, put her throat in the tabernacle
So actually you should build a statue of my likeness in the center of the city
(Your women riddled it with rose petals)
No justice, no peace, no settle
We are renegades, fuck your gold medal
The people are the majority
You can't survive without us, you need us
Attitude, never defeatist
Rebels, so please believe it's
War on the streets of Egypt
My vocals a total eclipse of totalitarianism
You seek to mistreat us
So this is calculated amalgamation
One shot fired inspired by hope to arouse a nation
(I), I am the renegade[Hook: Jill Scott]
You always answer calls, when I call, you come
You always answer my calls, when I call, you always come
You always answer calls, when I call, you come
You always answer my calls, when I call you always come

[Verse 1: Jill Scott]
I don't even have to question if it's real or not
You're right there, all times
Even when my car broke down in the parking lot
You were there, you didn't stutter or hesitate
You come to my rescue once again like that

Hook: Jill Scott

[Verse 2: Jill Scott]
Look up, cause there's a beautiful man with a kind heart
And a multiple degree in leaves we took a ride to the nearest open air
Didn't have a spear and now we're here talking
About the last bottle of Chard' of a longest good night

Hook: Jill Scott

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
Hello? Of course I do, I come when you call even before
The call is audible
Foul, then I'm swimmin' all the cool [?]
Intrinsically before you pick up the phone and dial
It's intimate connection, something triggers the smile
I'm here for you, and next to you, essential, telepathy
In the center of Times Square I feel like I'm in isolation
Tune out a billion sounds and I can signal all your vibration
Your lips, your tongue; my eyes are closed
But I can see them calling me to come
Faith without fear creates resistance from blemishes
Half way around the hemisphere, the distance diminishes
When you c-c-c-call, I c-c-c-come
My toes c-c-c-curl, s-s-s-so I can run
Like I'm the Flash, or Ironman, the U.S. mail, or fireman
The wrong times, the right time, the day time, the night time[Talk Styles P & Pharoahe Monche] (amid Police sounds)
These Lil Niggas is crazy, what the F..., this our future..
It's about the children man, damn, a yo P, I prey to God for them kids man.. no doubt man for real where ever they at, real talk, it's real out here, come on

[Verse 1 Stlyes P]
CHILDREN in the hood seem to die at a young age
Wakes and funerals 'ill make it feel like a Sunday
All they talk about is money and gun play, (that's all)
Only light they getting is the one from the sun ray, CHILDREN (no light)
No light bulb bright idea, shame to kill that (shame) nigga was the right idea
Like a nigga lose his life every night out here, (every night)
Kind of hot but they talk about ice out here. (It's hot out here)
CHILDREN all on some ill shit (ill shit) twelve and nineteen already done kill shit. (soldiers)
All of them is numb don't none of them feel shit, (don't feel shit)
It's just like a war zone, that's on some real shit (It's real homey) CHILDREN
Homey this is O.G. talk, blow O.G. (O.G.) oats, kick O.G. (O.G.) quotes
In a low ? shake the police off, (Shake 'em off) only engage with the enemy, you know he soft. (What up) CHILDREN
All missing the roof off, (missing) lil niggas is hard they don't know how a school look, (They hard)
They know how a sucker or a herb{spelled wrong} or a fool look
(they seen that) they know how a crack pack, dope or the tool look, (they seen that)
Yeah, shit is real out here,(It's real) blood is like oil how it spills out here, (spilling)
If you ain't from out here then don't chill out here, (don't chill out here) nine-mill might pop a grill out here. (it might)

[Hook by Pharoahe Monche]
Some days and night I thank God I don't have no CHILDREN
Struggling hard and it's a hassle CHILDREN
Gotta teach them how to survive and win, the whole future of the world depends on CHILDREN
So I talk wise and speak clearly, but still sometimes they don't here me  CHILDREN
When I open my heart I catch feeling, cause the kids need hope they need healing CHILDREN

[2nd verse Styles P]

In the burbs play video games, (games) imitate wack rappers in the video ? (brainwashed)
Playstation, Xbox, Laptops, Desktops, (damn)
I be asking myself when will this mess stop, CHILDREN (when will it stop)
Snotty little niggas is too rude,  (too rude)
All I know is Google and YouTube is making it easy. (shit's easy)
Nothing realistic you can see on the T.V. (nothing)
But they call this reality show (yeah) CHILDREN
? make them gradually grow (stunt their growth) CHILDREN
Make them lazy, so crazy,(so crazy) nest stay hazy
Always keep a dutch steamed cause they ain't even make it no fun
Shit is touch screen, CHILDREN (damn)
And they don't talk they text: (huh)  LOL, WTF. And I be like damn what the fuck is next
Cause Mr. Illuminati seem to cut them checks.  (yeah)

[Hook]

Followed by the word CHILDREN repeated by ?[Verse 1]
You should never in your wildest dreams shit on a nigga
Police eat a dick, straight up, you know why? Clap!
Clap on, clap off
Clap at them and I do not mean applause
Rap nicer than Santa with no Claus
Track twice as bananas with no chorus
Uh, yeah, it's suicide murder
In the hood like catalytic converters
On the block like Lego
In the streets like street light
Three Little Pigs is what I be on these beats like
In other words the police, say it, say it like Pac: "the Po-Lice"
Fuck' em, and that's straight from the underground
Where little kids got it bad cause we brown
Now who am I? P-Monch, from Do or Die, South Suicide, Queens, where I get down
I peep surveillance in the street every summer
You may not play lotto, but you know these numbers
The 105th, the 103rd
My peoples in Queens doing 13 if we get the urge to get on some Todd Scott shit
My brains a Glock clip
My lames be on some 1-800-COPSHOT shit

[Hook]
Say we were gonna, say we were gonna get it together, yeah, yeah, yeah
One day, one day, one day, one day, one day I said the people gon' clap!
Watch me clap to this!

[Verse 2]
We went from niggas to porch monkeys, to negroes, to blacks, back to niggas again
Yet niggas is still hungry
Abolish the N-word, the plan's so corny
While homeland security cams are all on me
They watch through the fiber optics
It dawned on me that cops can just run in your spot quick without warning
They educate the masses to follow, it's so boring
I sat in the back of class, asleep, snoring
And they ask me why I'm vocal and adamant
Cause I lost my focus like governor Patterson
And the ghetto is impossible to escape
And the first obstacle is this tapeworm in my abdomen
Spear-chucker, fuck that, I toss javelins and $5,000 bills in the face of James Madison
This is an American post mortem, to focus on you bogus, Novus Ordo Seclorum, clap!

[Hook]
Say we were gonna, say we were gonna get it together, yeah, yeah, yeah
One day, one day, one day, one day, one day I said the people gon' clap!
Watch me clap to this!
Now everybody watch me clap! clap!
Now everybody just-

*clapping*

[Verse 3]
No respect, no manners, it's Mad Max with multiple macs
Mad banana clips, and a black hammer that hits the back of a black talon
A slew of hollow tips through the wall of your blue silence
And selective theatrics, collective dramatics
I'm systematically pissed, clap automatic for Mumia Abu Jamal
Maybe I’m Crispus Attucks, P’s a fanatic for peace, but you angered a pacifist
The Gospel, I spit it like Jesus of Nazareth and then emphatically clap
At any obstacle, an impossible feat, the fathom is not logical
But chronicle the thought of the people cause on day we gon' clap![Scratches by DJ Debris]
"Classic example of..." - Q-Tip

[Pharoahe Monch]
Now, we bring danger to strangers who claim "to defame the crew!"
Pharoahe, Hilltop Hoods, never singing the blues
Slinging these new singles for you to mingle to
Australian Hip Hop but not kangaroos
Change the game a little, rearrange the rules
Your whole frame is brittle man, you came to lose
We drop classics you bastards
My final four defeats sweet sixteens like March Madness
It's not passive, it's so ravenous
This collaborative effort is not average
It's magnanimous, thus, my little crew got loose screws
These dudes will put two in your cabbage
One in your laminate, three in your manager's Phantom
Don't be a candidate for Animal Planet
Lyrical savages and CD anger management classes
Look how we handle 'em, we leave 'em in bandages damn it

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Debris] + {Pharoahe Monch}
{Classic example!} "I do my thing for real"
{Pharoahe!} "While I cooked up classics" - Common
"The bottom line, my sound system ready to shine"
"While I cooked up classics" - Common

[Suffa]
No stopping us now, Hilltop in this, we locking it down
Apocalypse now, we're not with this monotonous sound
It's innocuous Hip Hop and we're on top of a cloud
Rocking a crowd, dropping this like "Who's not with us now, huh?"
They're all feeling our movement, it's
Got DJs scratching up my shit like removalists
Who is this ludicrous, furious, humorous
Dude that just threw us off the back of a tour bus?
Two of us, "bringing that shit that got your hands clapping!"
Luminous, "swinging my dick like Dr. Manhattan!"
... I had to stop for breath
Cause our shit's like Joan of Arc, man it's hot to death
We blowing up the spot, not once but twice like P-Monch
Blowing up some Reebok pumps when I beatbox
"Come to life!" We'll try get this drunk out of here
My shit's a classic, man get the FUCK out of here

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Debris] + {Suffa}
"I do my thing for real"

[Pressure] + {Pharoahe Monch}
This ain't so-so promo, believe me it's pro
Dope flow that don't know the meaning of no
Me and my co., {Pharoahe!} won't be leaving the show
Till the speakers blow from the heat of my flow
"We write classics!" for back alley theatrics
Playing with fire living in a house built with matchsticks
Haters wanna roll with me now, showing love
Guess I'm just too busy holding it down to hold a grudge
Your average amateurs panic and choke
They ain't actually dope, they're high on cannabis smoke
I'm still the man if I don't blow a grand on a rope
Cause fortune favours the brave, that's why these rappers are broke... huh
Props to Nu-Mark for jacking the sample
Debris could lay a scratch with his arms full
Keeping heads packed like a carpool
Back for the masses to marvel, here's another classic example

Ooh, listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage, damage, damage, damage

[Verse 1]
They cock them hammers, wave them llamas
But that's that in front of the camera drama
So when the cameras are attached to dollys, I call them dali lama's
Mold me, loathe, hold me in the palm of your hand, load me
You know exactly what I am, murderer
When I'm inserted on to the top of fifteen family members
It's the curse of the proverbial anarchy starter, the martyr
This is what I have been converted to do what I do is insanity
Pro-fo-fo-fanity when they manually hammer me annually
You dont figitty faze me yo
I won't tigitty tase you bro
Figgity fucking cut you in half like it's nothing minus the laser scope
Then I will ring your bell like Avon
Before displaying some of my various tattoos (Trayvon)
The (Oscar) award winning (Aiyana Jones) hey (Sean)
Sworn to be cannon fodder for your father slaughter daughters
Armor piercing tumblers more deadlier than napalm
Fuck a stray bullet, I take aim when the gun draws
For ever lasting fame I will maim those who change the gun laws
Cause post traumatic stress disorder, ask any vet I've worked with
My purpose catching bodies like safety nets at the circus

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Nigga I will twist your liver like Oliver (TWIST)
Scratch your name off my calendar
See that was me thru a silencer
What you just heard was a .44 caliber
Now you can fill in the blanks
I will pillage your town
Killing them with Dillinger rounds
Nigga fill in the clip cause I'm willing to flip
See I'm sort of certified, I'm fortified live
You would be mortified if I would put on screen what I've seen
Horrified holy Bibles, rivals, vital organs
Little bitty baby bodies, bridal gowns coffins
Morphine, gang bang, gangrene, slauson, swap meet
Meet greet, pop I don't sleep, I don't stop
I love hate, hate cops
That's why I laugh when you pull it
I'm motivated and crass
I'm so elated when I see them on the news (you fuckin' pigs!)
They flying the flag half mass
See there's no need for conversation
When we're discussing the bullet's point of view

[Hook][Intro: Bernz]
Uh huh
What we have here is a failure to communicate
Come on!

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
(Singing)
Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Them: flashing lights and fast cars
Us: gas masks, flash mobs
Riots in Times Square
See, when the educated is unemployed it's unfair
With no visa, I'll devise an escape
Young Caesar, rise of the apes
On top of a police car, pose like the Heisman
Throwing fire bombs at an Exxon advertisement
We are on that check-to-check shit
They are socially disconnected
From the youth who get thoroughly disrespected
See, monkeys receive minimal information
So this, that subliminal renegade shit
For the criminal minded who are tired of slave shit
That Martin Luther King slang sling free speech
Shit you need to learn: no texts, retweet

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
The agony of defeat
Walking across the beat
Writing my pen on a leaf
Smoking a leaf, seeking retreat
In the nose-bleed seats
The game seem out of reach
But if I dive towards my suicide
The whole game goin' cease
What the fuck wrong wit' him?
Is he on that Whitney or Mike wit' 'em?
Fame will drive you crazy
No license just nights when
You're partying lines on the table
Pills in every color
You're feeling unstable
Screaming out for your mother
Drowning in that puddle
Still waters run deep
Aretha, in the background
Singing fairy-tales, you can't sleep
No logo peak can sow what you reap
From crawling in the deep
And the reaper creep
And barely eat, it eats
At you, it makes you weak
Amongst the meat
Color that's drowning in bleach
Did you find what you see
Covered in a sheet?
Oh my god, it's Sesame Street
Open the gates and let me free
My brain is sayin' to let you be
Can't you see the total fee
To take a life ain't worth the key
To break them lies so it's best that we

[Hook: ¡MAYDAY!]
Death march
Walking towards our demise
I see the cliff, they see my eyes
This ain't a time for goodbyes on a
Death march
Walking towards our demise
I see the cliff, they see my eyes
Nose dive!

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Tie an army to your boot straps
Coffee in your blood
Wallet full of food stamps
Pocket full of drugs
Blue prints to move this city from the mud
You get a discount at the morgue, if you're digging yourself up
Yeah, you go ham, I go back bacon
Taking steps towards death and the method is quite back breaking
Show up for dinner like a lab patient
Better yet, a masked Jason
You're pointing at me like "Is that Satan?"
Not in the slightest, lieutenant
Treat my organ like my rifle
I'm a spiteful Lou Bennett
I'm a menace to all ministers
Evident star winners
As vivid as all Genesis
Give me a call, religion engaged
I sip a soda can full of rage
And welcome Death's doorbell ringing on me any day
Modern warfare best believe that many play
I'd rather die amongst the tribe than be alive as any slave

[Verse 4: Bernz]
Counting sheep, not for sleep
Counting them cause so many surrounding me
They walk the streets, they're watching me
Lately I look over my shoulder constantly
Walk in a haze, foggy daze for days
So foggy I can hardly see the nuclear waste
So resorting to drastic measures
Propelling from roofs, cement boots and tarred feathers
La-la-la-lately feel sedated to
Slipping me poison, when I drink your wine and eat your food
Is it enough for you to change my mood?
How does it taste? I think I'd like a se-se-second scoop
How come this whiskey make 'em shifty?
Black-magic addicts signing up early just to get tipsy
My family told me be careful, they know this life's to risky
I told them pay 'em no mind, while we marched in the line

[Hook: ¡MAYDAY!]
