[Hook]
Damn damn damn James

[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
Dickie shorts and Lincoln's clean
Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, blizzes lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out here come the folks (Damn - oh lord)

[Verse 2: André 3000]
As the plot thickens it gives me the dickens
Reminiscent of Charles a lil' discotheque
Nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia a lil' spot where
Young men and young women go to experience
They first li'l taste of the night life
Me? Well I've never been there; well perhaps once
But I was so engulfed in the Olde E
I never made it to the door you speak of, hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems
And the troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "Set it Off," in the right
But it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it
"Hey hey look baby they playin' our song"
And the crowd goes wild as if
Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M
And three niggas just don' got hauled
Off in the ambulance (sliced up)
Two niggas don' start bustin' (wham wham)
And one nigga don' took his shirt off talkin' 'bout
"Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Courts?"
It's just my interpretation of the situation

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on, ya know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig)
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and
The next four years you & somebody's daughter
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations (that is)
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the
United Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office
Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap just that, trapped
Go on and marinate on that for a minute[Hook]
Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "y"
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I - Aquemini

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on like Spike Lee said, "Get on the Bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin' it's a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch, familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman, how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat man
I'm strapped man and ready to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain steering wheel
For real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack
Instead of going into overkill pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Twice upon a time there was a boy who died
And lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors and baby bottles and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts
You know, how to work bread, cheese and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what you bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge now meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'
More than a hobby, when my turntables get wobbly they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all, I often drift, I'm talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed so what have you
Now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's Outkast's Aquemini, another black experience

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Saxxx
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
Cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that, some say we pro-black, boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme we bust back
Get get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear dat can't come near dat maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea yea yea yea

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben, welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it, that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
Andre, this is Andre, y'all are just gon' have to make amends

[Hook][Hook]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Sir Luscious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados; I'm wakin up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print?
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, ath-letes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make
Cause...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga - Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' - dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'mma show you how to - wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on yo' zipper, lick you like a - lizard when I'm slizzerd
Or sober; six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass round eight-ish I know you'll be there for me girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin off at they mouth
And tellin me everything that's on yo' nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, love who you ain't; you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk
In double time the boy next do's a freak, ha ha!

[Hook]

[Outro: André 3000]
(And we are...)
The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
(And my my...)
The sky is fallin ain't no need to panic
(But ooh ooh...)
I got a stick and want yo' automatic
(Ooh ooh ooh...)
Compatible created in the attic[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya player, I'm dicking the ho down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too"
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it's like that now

[Hook]
It's like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Llac now
We just, shoot, game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawning dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above (aww man)
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said what you wanna be, she said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper

[Hook][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
I move with the elegance of an African elephant
I presented the evidence eloquent as the president
Evident is the emphasis, I deserve me a championship
But before I banana clip I'mma chill so my man can rip

[Verse 2: El-P]
Little man against Hellion with the heart of an orphan
I got the words of a murderer and an eye for distortion
You take a slice of my portion, I'll take a piece of your profit
I drive at illegal speeds, Keep an O.Z in my pocket

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
We run the jewels in your town, a quarter pound on my person
I'm known for pounding the stage, I'm talking burning and cursing
Producer gave me a beat, said it's the beat of the year
I said "El-P didn't do it so get the fuck outta here!"

[Verse 4: El-P]
You wanna hang, bring your throat, I got stools and a rope
I'mma slang pope, haranguing the land with a man's flow
A new edition to the art of the old code
That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome

[Verse 5: Killer Mike]
Ay El
We the villains, we antagonist bad guys
Mercy me, merciless me putting pain in they sad eyes
It's time for Skywalker talk cause meet the true Darth Vader
I hit your mom in '03, but a G ain't ate her
So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect
Before I Melvin on you Jody, put my arm on your neck
Or worse yet be the reason your girl want a divorce
Be at your crib with your kids saying "fuck your fort
Lil' nigga!"

[Verse 6: El-P]
The style is radiation leak at Mile Island
Also known as Chernobyl talk, listen for the sirens
For the green I'm a hoarder, you're the poor distorter
Sorta morbid sonnin' these fuckin' whoredome explorers, I'm bored
Enough of your bummy shit, it's numb to the core, sure
You suck a good dick for the fame and couldn't resist getting played
I fuck like I'm headed to war, I'm really not playing no games
But tag me god damn it I'll kill the carrier mentions my name

[Verse 7: Killer Mike]
Hey, I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat
I'm merciless, I'll torture emcees, tie up both of they feet
If they refuse to run the jewels we beat the bottoms of feet
I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of your teeth
Hey me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap
Is where we staying when they corpses resting under our feet
I sent they mom a little cash and a sympathy letter
Told her she raised a bunch a fuck boys, next time do better
Bitch

[Verse 8: Big Boi]
We the old Atlanta, new Atlanta, future of the city
Daddy Fat Saxx don't give a damn cause can't nann new niggas get with me
Now it's true, niggas are simply simple minded simple Simons
Being dumbed down by the local radio stations by designing
But what I be rhyming, no payola is required
My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet
Nigga your lease is up, you're fired
Quiet, that's how the boss talk
Retain ownership on everything, every car bought
And paid for, no neighbors cause I'm sitting on acres
Went to Vegas, jumped the broom cause I wasn't trippin' on papers
Or no prenuptual agreement for mama
If we broke up and she took half I'd still be sitting on commas
Eight figures nigga[Pre-Hook x2]
When that liquor get po’ up
And that green get roll up
When them sets get throwed up
I’m like nah man, hol’ up
Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff
Better hope they don’t call my bluff
Cause my mind is going crazy
This shit is never enough

[Hook x2]
Never enough, never enough, never enough
This shit is never enough

[Post-Hook: Woman]
Not even, not even, not even, not enough [x4]

[Verse 1]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
At the party with my homies, walk up and they play my shit
On the road, kick a song, didn’t have to sell my soul
Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal
Where you stay, every day, just got my crib in LA
Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ
Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh
Bitches on my dick, don’t give a fuck, y’all must not know what’s up
In the cut, we don’t give a fuck, we just trying to cut
Line em up, if they say they bout it then we’ll sign em up
Rattpack, that’s a fact, basic bitch can’t fuck with that
Where you at? That’s what they be asking, I say on the map

[Bridge x2]
Who we are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
Drop that new shit just cause they demand it
Living like we got it cause we get it
Do it just to say we fucking did it

[Pre-Hook + Hook + Post-Hook]

[Outro: Thalia]
This album was created over the span of one year. However, the majority of the album was recorded in only two weeks[Hook]
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us
We the type of people make the club get crunk

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin' another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbing every city then we headed to that Bat cave
ATL, Georgia, what do we do for ya
Bulldoggin' hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy you sounding silly, thank my Brougham ain't sittin pretty
Doing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties
Damn we the committee gon' burn it down
But us gon' bust you in the mouth with the chorus now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said baby boy you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past your ass'll be a has what
That's one to live by or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure
Andre, got to her station here's my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group ain't comin with it
But I'm witchya cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin' but examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she wrote
And I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek "it's weak" is the last quote
That I want to hear when I'm goin' down when all's said and done
And we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin and slowin down
All y'all can say is them niggas earned that crown but until then

[Solo]

Chorus: repeat 2X (sung)

I know you're waitin for daddy, it won't be long shawty
Be patient cause I'm comin to you
Ridin dirty on 85, slow, takin it easy
I don't want nothin to keep me from you

[J-Bo]
Now the wind blows as I'm on 85, and chiefin good
With a six-pack a that Colt 45 just like I should
And if I could, I will, I might, get blowed tonight
If thangs go right, I'm gon' cut this ho tonight
So I'mma get a call, from this broad
Run the game like she ain't ready
But still indeed, she on her knees, keepin thangs steady
Like Betty Crocker, the face doctor
Just as she swallows with passion
So now she braggin, laggin behind
What questions she now be askin, so time is passin
Now I'm mashin on, I'm gone, livin in the world of hoes
So I suppose, it's goin down deep in yo' city
Cause in these parts, ain't nuthin bad hard times
Now shawty, please, really

Chorus

[Verse 1:Big Boi]
Sheeeit
I'm lookin for anythang, gonna cut'em up
Like everythang, in my stable
Sir Lucius, with the left foot, is ready willing and able
But these hoes will get on your nerves
Fuck all that kickin 'em to the curb
You lackin that tolerance;
You let the ho swallow it, get off in yo' parlor an'
Stab out to the cajun crab house
Or the Jamaican cat house
Or the college, frat house
For the gul you just, mad house that rat house
And get you some scrub, she ain't ya girl
Skeet-skeet one off and dip boi
I'm slick as a curl, smooth as a pearl
Don't, don't be givin no gifts boi
On the first date or the worst date
I'm goin all the way on the first play
Like Hail Mary's to field goals
I think I was put here to drill hoes
For real doe; and while you blowin up my
Bar I'm off in your purse
To get my gas money then I'm back on the 'spressway
And I'm out this verse, geyeah!

Chorus

[Sean Paul]
Man this shit gettin crazy, this girl wants to face me
Met her jes last week, told me that her name was Stacy
Bad lil' bitch, add her straight to my collection
Jump in my 'llac, in my pocket got protection
For thangs to go down, see I ain't playin around
Got a half a tank of gas, I'm 85 Southbound
It's a long ass way, I'm from the 20 side of thangs
She said it's dead serious, hot like some lighter flames
Oh you know how it go, I'm the nigga, she the ho
She told me some mo', I shut my Cadillac do'
My hands on the grain, my pedal down to the ground
Ain't got my license, back so I need to slow down
Now I'm scrapin the flo', shawty ain't got on no drawers
Man I'm breakin the law, tryna' get me this broad
I don't know what it is, but shawty fine as hell
Slum-type that I like, straight from A-T-L
Shawty yeah!

Chorus (to fade)[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jacking off cause you ain't there

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
'65 Chevrolet Impala peachy cream
Cruising down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talking bout meeting at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em a good game, juju pimping
Give em to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra

Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I don't need that A.I.D.S
A D. and an A. missin' out my Adidas
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumping brooms

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, boom

[Hook][Produced by Organized Noize]

[Intro: André 3000]
Niggas in the point ain't changed (x2)
Yeah...

[Beat switch]

[Verse 1: André 3000]
A nigga ready from the get go, blow, blow, blow
Y'all hear my shit go, it's Andre
Can yo punk ass come out to play
Stay in your little hole, then coward duck your head
You don't know who you be fucking with you'se better off, dead
Is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp
Make yourself exempt
Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck, bullets fly, niggas die
By getting blasted, how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
But naw, I take that back, that's my problem
Turning and walking away, this ain't gon work when they be robbing
As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome
Step up nigga, if you want some

[Hook] (x2)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo chest (it's the joint)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well nigga, you softer than silicone, used to pump up tits
It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50
Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope, but in 1994
I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives cause I was steadily in the mix
Yeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Just an international playa, coming through your stereo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: André 3000]
3-5-7 to your forehead
There'll be mo' dead cause I'm a pro, kid
But Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me
My nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me off my street
But in my hood hood, they hollering ghetto
Don't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew
On the concrete, remember when we ran deep
Remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy
They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
Tripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me
One is in the air and one is the chamber
Y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger
Quick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day
At a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch
Just let you know, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling
Do more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac
I got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun
And got my pump under my seat
In case these youngsters wanna have some fun
I'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this a heater
Load it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it
The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
See I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you
You 'posed to be quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster
1-2-3, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fucking slave, you better try another way
To take me out, is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me, unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets letting loose my last clip
I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped
You know that's how I do, you know that's how I do

[Hook]

[Outro : Big Boi]
Yeah and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking
Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas
Around the East Point way
College Park is really on the map
We coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped
With the mothafucking guns and the motherfucking Glocks
The heaters, the gats nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop[Intro: Future]
Ain't no way around it [x6]

[Hook: Future]
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer - that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Verse 1: Future]
I had a young, hot thang fucked my bro and gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame
I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame
We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
See I ain't gonna hold it against ya, I'mma keep it pimping with ya
Don't you come at me with issues, ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya, you can meet me somewhere on Peach street
At the W on the Fourteenth, ain't tryna fuck no ho tryna know me
And they wanna fuck my woodie, already smashed the homie
Half of these bitches phony, singing love songs like Toni
Ms. Braxton you the action, stop acting
Just another sad love song waiting to happen

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
A killer gonna' be a killer, that's regardless of the fact that I'm Tin Man heartless
No love for ya' baby unless you walkin' through my living room braless
With your nipples pokin' through ya wife beater, you the mic eater
She doing Daddy Fat Stacks soon as I meet her
Get it meet her, cut to the chase like a cheetah cause she want that Peta
Pipe her down, gon' wipe her clown when so many niggas un-wiped her down
You hopin' that she gon' turn her life around, about face, a full one-eighty
A ho into a housewife, that's your lady and me, I never give another but a dope baby
With a good time and a dope dick, she love the way I talk and my flow slick
Ain't no way around it
Yo-yo-yo-yo-your bitch in love with my dick
But big don't love her at all, let a monkey nigga pay the bills while I scrub them jaws
Like a test for DNA, TNA, we the A

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Ball so had I need ace of spades, livin' life through these ray bans
Drop four, whipped up eight man
How you do that, got great hands
I ain't seen you niggas like Ray Charles, figure I'll drive these eight car
Trynna' figure how I'ma fuck these eight hoes, same time increase my bank roll
Broke shit had my vision blurred, so I went and copped me a quarter bird
Got me a job got work to do, need a job nig got work for you
Hood lil' niggas die by respect, niggas bleeding what they readin' on the internet
Where ya' from? nigga where ya' plug?
Just like I thought, niggas silent thugs
That is a job fuck niggas hate, why you think I'm carrying this seven-eight
Twenty-two rounds that'll keep me straight, if I ain't got that then I make and bake
Been gettin' money since baby Nate, red monkey, I'mma watch junkie
Ain't no way really 'round that, made them young niggas screaming, "where the pounds at?"
What

[Hook][Missy]
Don't explain, you never change
Same old thing, same old game
Say ya want to be wit' me
But show me my ring
Baby, let me think
I been in the cold
The story untold, about to unfold
How do you expect me
To ever believe you want be wit' me

[Missy] (Nicole)
Why you all in my grill (Why you all in)
Can you pay my bills (Can you pay my bills)
Let me know if you will (Let me know, know)
Cuz a chick gotta live (A chick like me, I got to live)

[Missy]
Talk is talk, and talk is cheap
Tell it to her, don't say it to me
Cuz I know I'm in control
See Trix are for kids, and boo I'm too old
Go 'head, with your games
Don't ever come back to me again
Where you go, remember me
I'm the best thing in history

[Missy] (Nicole)
Why you all in my grill (Why, why, why)
Can you pay my bills (Can you pay my bills)
Let me know if you will (Let me know boy, boy)
Cuz a chick gotta live (A chick got to live, ooh yeah)

[Missy] (Nicole)
Third time (Third time)
I moved you in, took you back
In my life (I was a fool)
I don't know what's wrong with me
Third time (Third time)
I moved you in, took you back in my life (oh yeah, yeah)

[Missy] (Nicole)
Why you all in my grill (All in my grill)
Can you pay my bills (Can you pay my bills, yeah)
Let me know if you will (Let me know if you will)
Cuz a chick gotta live (oh, yeah)

Why you all in my grill
Can you pay my bills (Ooh, pay my bills)
Let me know if you will (Let me know, let me know baby, baby)
Cuz a chick gotta live (A chick like me, I got to live)

[Missy]
If you want me, where's my dough?
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough
Where's my money? Where's my clothes?

If you want me, where's my dough?
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough?
Where's my money? Where's my clothes?

[Big Boi]
Aight, uh
Why you all in my grill?
I'm thinkin' it's time to chill
Yeah, but you on a drill, though
I couldn't even step out the baby blue Bonneville
Cuz you be tryin' to kill my ho, my girlfriend
And people around me is tellin' me that you's a stalker
Like Darth Vader takes a Skywalker
I told you I was the street talker
It ain't my fault you dirty your Victoria's Secret's
And your Frederick's
You wanted the Waldorf Astoria
But instead I took you to Cedric's, to entertain you
To give you to the "G", and never claim you
Me and Missy, we get it straight pissin'
Oh yeah, we puffin' on one of them thangs too
You blamin' who? You namin' who?
I know you ain't bringin' that lame crew
Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax
She pretty D, all they same, boo
But I'm backed by the Dungeon Family
So you can go 'head wit' all that stabbin' me
Cuz I will jab thee, and slam thee
And Bobby Boochet yo' ass, G
Yeah, yeah[Verse 1 - Rich Boy]
I remember when I met'cha I was only sixteen
Who would ever thought that me and you would get this cream?
We took a lot of trips together, you stayed down
Remember when we start hoppin' on that Greyhound?
She say she like to play hide and seek in the ride
And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside
She say she think I'm cheatin' wit' a girl named Jane
You ain't just my babay, bitch, you my everythang
I was broke but you maintained better
As long as me and you together we can get this cheddar
Whatever, her name white Sally
I met her through my homeboy Rico out in Cali
I thank Reagan for the haters when ya got hard
Ya bought me jewels, gator shoes and some big cars
Yeah you took me out the hood gave me good thangs
Now we on a private plane eatin' chicken wangs

[Hook]
(And I love you) You the reason why I ride good
You the reason why I shop good, drink good, smoke good
(And I love you) You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed candy on my old school
(And I love you) You the reason why I quarterback
Took a nigga out the projects, put me in a cul-de-sac
That's why I get it how I live boy
Cause you took me from a young broke nigga to a rich boy

[Verse 2 - Pastor Troy]
And I love you babay, mwah, hugs and kisses
Fuck them niggas and fuck them bitches
Been in this game since 1998
Nigga take the safety and shit but I'm great
Maybe it's fate destiny, you tell me
Damn near ten and that shit been free
But I'm P.T. so I gots to cruise nigga
Really ain't shit to prove to y'all niggas
All the cars, all the clothes
Wit' all the stars, and all the hoes
First class flights a nigga live in the lights
But see you in the dark, this stuff is kinda hard
See where I park, valet costs a note
Drop another fifty just to check my coat
Probably leave wit' yo' chick, know how I do
It's Pastor Disaster baby, I love you

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Big Boi]
Took me from a gun totin' nigga to a Big Boi
Too legit to slip now I got papers on my shit boi
And not just my weapons I'm talkin' 'bout titles and deeds
You payin' rent you can't afford and can't break out of ya lease
I'm out of ya league, I might as well be Ivy
All over ya ass like injections in a stripper's hiney
Rhyming is a skill that requires timing
Like dual ejaculation while my lady's riding
I'm 'bout to cum (I'm 'bout to cum) at the same time
You satisfied? (I'm satisfied) that's how I slang mine
A generation came up under my style
From penetration of the nation when I was just a child
Now, who's really in the critics talk 'bout me
Andre 3000 and three mo' niggas that's really fie
Let me break it down, I get fly at that mouth
I, stay fresh to the hosiery we 'posed to be
Them niggas from the south so
One to the two the three the fo'
Satisfied? (I'm satisfied) Then I'mma hit 'cha some mo'

[Hook][Hook: Jake]
Gimme one reason why
Gimme one reason why
Why, you're the apple of my eye

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
In the beginning they say Eve bit it
They're still sinning
Cause they letting every Tom Dick and Steve hit it
Therefore I'm quick to not believe in it
Like the weed with the seeds in it
Now proceed like a G pimping
And some of the things you've probably seen in your life
Made you think a certain kinda way about finding your wife
Or your better half, it's better to love and to hold
Than to never have it at all and ball on these hoes
Make your stock go up, my Apple stock split
Took a gamble caught it at forty and now it's over six
I'm rich trick and that's in hundos
So overseas you might catch us eating Nando's

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Some say the preacher's daughters are some of the freakiest ones
They been deprived of fun and now they just wanna cut loose
Like everybody else they wilding try to find theyself
And by the time they do they barely have nobody left over
Feeling empty and alone, cause the youth is gone
The thrill has been killed so let the truth be told
Look in the mirror my dear, and it appears
That the eyes are the window to the soul, oh

[Hook: Jake]

[Bridge: Jake]
I, I need a big bite baby, a big bite baby
Of your sweet red delicious love

[Hook]

[Outro: Jake]
You're the apple of my eye[Hook]
Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "y"
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I - Aquemini

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on like Spike Lee said, "Get on the Bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin' it's a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch, familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman, how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat man
I'm strapped man and ready to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain steering wheel
For real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack
Instead of going into overkill pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Twice upon a time there was a boy who died
And lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors and baby bottles and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts
You know, how to work bread, cheese and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what you bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge now meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'
More than a hobby, when my turntables get wobbly they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all, I often drift, I'm talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed so what have you
Now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's Outkast's Aquemini, another black experience

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Saxxx
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
Cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that, some say we pro-black, boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme we bust back
Get get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear dat can't come near dat maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea yea yea yea

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben, welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it, that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
Andre, this is Andre, y'all are just gon' have to make amends

[Hook]If y'all don’t know me by now
Y'all ain’t gon' never know me
I go by the name of the B-I-G, the B-O-I
One half of the mighty Outkast
Yeah one whole of me, the whole thing
Welcome to Vicious Lies And Dangerous Rumors, yeah[Intro]
Put that bitch in smash mode!
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan
(And one and two, now you know what to do)
Motherfucker let's go
Yeah-yeah, let's go
Put your back into it like your grandma do it, let's go
A-Town!
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan

[Hook]
I knew I was wrong, for thinking that she cared
I knew all along, that's why I stay prepared
(And one and two, now you know what to do)
My nigga what was I to do, but find somebody else
(Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan)

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
This is how it all starts
Momma fell heels over head and says you was the one
Big Boi, but she calls me Antwan
So just for fun, I went along with hon
I was young, full of cum, down for the skeet skeet, not dumb
We would meet undiscretely discrete
She in heat like beitch on a leash
No disrespect, but metaphorically she's a beast
No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding till we got slimey
Yeah, from that sweet stick thang, can't complain
I was hooked on that box like the hot Krispy Cremes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well it didn't even take long for me to game peep
It was week after week, I was seeing the same freak
I be damned if we posing for pictures and throwing rice
Maybe throwing up in Vegas while Daddy is on the dice
I might (might) just put you on the chopping block tonight
Act right and you can get my second string spotlight
But if you freaking, I'm speaking clean as a whistle
This'll be the last offical offer before dismissal
No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding til we got slimey
Yeah, got the latex gloves for the fit
Because she trying to trick Daddy, Slip-N-Slide on this dick!

[Hook]

[Bridge: Big Boi w/ back up singers]
You are not the one, you are not the one
You can be my two, you can be my two
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
(And one and two, now you know what to do)

[Hook]

[Outro]
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
Now two, now two, I'mma give her back to you
I'm through, nigga
I done had enough of the nasty stuff
One, two...yeah![Verse 1: Killer Mike]
I move with the elegance of an African elephant
I presented the evidence eloquent as the president
Evident is the emphasis, I deserve me a championship
But before I banana clip I'mma chill so my man can rip

[Verse 2: El-P]
Little man against Hellion with the heart of an orphan
I got the words of a murderer and an eye for distortion
You take a slice of my portion, I'll take a piece of your profit
I drive at illegal speeds, Keep an O.Z in my pocket

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
We run the jewels in your town, a quarter pound on my person
I'm known for pounding the stage, I'm talking burning and cursing
Producer gave me a beat, said it's the beat of the year
I said "El-P didn't do it so get the fuck outta here!"

[Verse 4: El-P]
You wanna hang, bring your throat, I got stools and a rope
I'mma slang pope, haranguing the land with a man's flow
A new edition to the art of the old code
That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome

[Verse 5: Killer Mike]
Ay El
We the villains, we antagonist bad guys
Mercy me, merciless me putting pain in they sad eyes
It's time for Skywalker talk cause meet the true Darth Vader
I hit your mom in '03, but a G ain't ate her
So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect
Before I Melvin on you Jody, put my arm on your neck
Or worse yet be the reason your girl want a divorce
Be at your crib with your kids saying "fuck your fort
Lil' nigga!"

[Verse 6: El-P]
The style is radiation leak at Mile Island
Also known as Chernobyl talk, listen for the sirens
For the green I'm a hoarder, you're the poor distorter
Sorta morbid sonnin' these fuckin' whoredome explorers, I'm bored
Enough of your bummy shit, it's numb to the core, sure
You suck a good dick for the fame and couldn't resist getting played
I fuck like I'm headed to war, I'm really not playing no games
But tag me god damn it I'll kill the carrier mentions my name

[Verse 7: Killer Mike]
Hey, I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat
I'm merciless, I'll torture emcees, tie up both of they feet
If they refuse to run the jewels we beat the bottoms of feet
I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of your teeth
Hey me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap
Is where we staying when they corpses resting under our feet
I sent they mom a little cash and a sympathy letter
Told her she raised a bunch a fuck boys, next time do better
Bitch

[Verse 8: Big Boi]
We the old Atlanta, new Atlanta, future of the city
Daddy Fat Saxx don't give a damn cause can't nann new niggas get with me
Now it's true, niggas are simply simple minded simple Simons
Being dumbed down by the local radio stations by designing
But what I be rhyming, no payola is required
My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet
Nigga your lease is up, you're fired
Quiet, that's how the boss talk
Retain ownership on everything, every car bought
And paid for, no neighbors cause I'm sitting on acres
Went to Vegas, jumped the broom cause I wasn't trippin' on papers
Or no prenuptual agreement for mama
If we broke up and she took half I'd still be sitting on commas
Eight figures nigga[Intro]
When was the last time you went t-bagging?
Must be tea time

[Hook: Janelle Monae]
Be still young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be still young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be wise my dear you must, learn to just be still
Until you really really know
Show me you're right, shine your light
I wonder when will I know

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
To hell if I don't pray
Like a mannequin in the window I don't say
A, word - I like to sit back, observe
My heart says do not disturb, and yours
Is like a doorknob, everybody get a turn (yeah)
Now that's a turnoff, girl, I'm not concerned
More like the early bird tryin to get the worm worm
But not on those terms, you got on my nerves
Say I don't deserve you, you're gonna learn
Treat it like a perm, leave it be or let it burn (burn)
Eat 'em like an urr-ange, orange
So when they on the verge of leavin it don't get borin
Foreign trips are taken just to see your smiley faces
Time's a-wastin and I don't like to waste no time
You can be down or.. yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Janelle Monae]
I love being in love (being in love)
Then you let me down, turned my heart around
Givin up on love, makes my ocean drown
You lived in my heart
Secret melodies haunt me at night
Maybe lies and lullabies
This is my last farewell
You let me down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yeah, from behind the Cadillac do'
Grip this wood, slide around real slow
Just thinkin, mind blown
As I glare through the smoke tinted windows
And be still

[Hook][Intro]
Classic, Young Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 1]
Look, swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the Ruler's apologize you ain't ruling the shit
I'm Rick Rubin in 85 with the beard thick
Dick bitch tight the movie and slanted eyes that squinch
I tell you that I'm one up, sun down then sun up
Son, I son niggas I probably fucked up your mama
No condom, it's good pussy
Pussy, tell it to your honor that this trauma is Jeffrey Dahmer
Took me too many moons set up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kicked, pushed with push broom
Man look, your man, look like sweet water
Corn bread to break under pressure if he's caught up
Big homie said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a  young boss with a bat cave
Back against the wall closer my back came back with them back pains, whoa
Tell em put my name on the blimp
Ball like I'm Derrick Rose you should know my gym
You playa's not allowed I'm sparking your game towels
And spikn' your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not this basket but rather the good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas I make you wait shake in
Blank tapes in your deck, niggas still break their neck
They hear it you need plans with the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to win
Club accounts go 15 racks when you wet like that shit
It's gotta be a sin. Hm. so Lord forgive me I'm a sinner
Hm. These hoes squeeze me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner, I coat food and the..tools make my agenda
I show fools I'm nasty like tofu I wish a
Motherfucker would get your whole career injured
This assault what a deadly weapon
Guilt your favourite rapper, favourite rapper last record
We fucked your baby actress on the map just what a blessing
Make that pussy ante up she call my dick anti-depressive
I'm really not depressed with, none of you niggas stressing
That's some of you niggas bless with the gift to carry the presence
A big in Pac and pop with..and with investments
15 minutes come up with 60 seconds
Last month I've been six hours inside of session
Came up with shit writers block niggas up in this stressing
Like who the fuck cares? who the fuck cares? Even if you get drunk up
Still be a millionaire
You could play a Santa Claus and make sure you're the whole dear
Every verse I put that bitch in the hearse, while boy stear
Uh Church to your p**sy and push me get pack..
Verse that you cookie I read it my foot is here big boy

Alright
And you don't stop, and it don't stop
And you don't stop
And it don't stop
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
This be that shit that make real niggas grab they dick
And bitches rubbin' on they tits as if they think this monkeys rich
Monkey see what monkey do, you monkeys never make no tips
Climbup the tree shit on you
Paranoid the shit and bricks that can build the castle
Hastle and breaking your picket fence
I know pterodactyls that still exist
Clappin if you resist to cooperate, go home and see their daughters go..
You at risk if you wear bracelet, we want your wrist
We can taste it from planet pluto
Dog Gonnit you panic just like a poodle rip out your culo then kudos
Two door Regals, El Caminos, and two more
Sevilles with the whitewalls, wipe it off with my shoe ho
I feel you just menthol, meant to get smoked and sent off to your maker
Trace your..with no the ..coach
Mean ain't no hood high up in California and G watches snoops
Ladies press down I bet you dog watchin, west coast what's up?

Gngsta, gagngsta you don't stop

And you don't, and you don't and you don't
And you don't, and you don't and you don't

Yeah, ah

I shout out the whole westside because I got it like that
And if we had it once then we got it right back
And if you ever had it you won't have it no more
And if we see the back though we to the front door
Taking your bread, crucifying everybody off with their head
This is freestyle of the top of the dome
And you know Big Boi that's my home
What's up?

And you do stop, and you do stop, and you do stop
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do

And you do, and you do, and you do stop[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
1, 2.. 1, 2, 3; yeah!
Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground
Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans
You can't stop a train
Who want some? Don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9, Anno Domini, anything goes, be what you wanna be
Long as you know consequences are given for livin' - the fence is
Too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell - HOT!
Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell, look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm and Hammer, soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of question with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousands miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always mo', OWWWW!

[Hook] (2x)
[Dre] Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
[Choir] Bombs over Baghdad!
[Dre] Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
[Choir] Bombs over Baghdad!

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend, dyin' to geek
Outkast bumping up and down the street
Slantback, Cadillac, 'bout 5 niggas deep
75 MC's freestyling to the beat
Cause we get krunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should have bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Should have held back, but you throwed a punch
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan
Never turn my back on my kids for them
Should have hit it, quit it, rag top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control"
Like Janet, plan it, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, coming straight to Florida
Lock all your windows then block the corridors
Pulling off a belt cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece just 'fore I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pitty pat rappers trying to get to 5
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL boy you betta not hide
Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, hah!

[Outro]
Bob your head, rag top x16
Power music, electric revival x15[Intro: Sleepy Brown (Big Boi)]
Girl you cut up (Lucius Left Foot)
Girl you know you cut up

[Hook 2x: Sleepy Brown & Jazze Pha]
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac yeah

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Nasty Noompsy Knightingale
Fresh in that tuxedo
Cummerbund with no suspenders
My torpedo, you libido
Need to chat (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
I'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys
To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this
Smack on smack on some of this dick tracy
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
Whatcha mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where i's...

[Hook 2x: Sleepy Brown]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Oh, lord! How can it be so hard??
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perserverance and experience to get that cat!
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack!
As we strut skip the line through the glass window glance
We look fine, right on time
As we step in the place the nursery's crunk we've come to play

[Verse 3 : Sleepy Brown]
Everybody's watching cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me!! Throw your hands up if you feel me!!
Cause we well designed, like the finest wine
Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why
I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny
So raise your hands to the sky cause we super fly

[Hook 2x: Sleepy Brown][Intro]
Ghosts and goblins run amuck
In the caverns of rhine
Slinging petty corruption
The seventh sign!

[Hook]
Yeah!!!!!!!
Give to you and I do what it takes!
To give it to you!
Wars, wars!

[Verse 1 : Big Boi]
Step into the realms of space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose!
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we cared!
No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared
But my hunger is the thought that no wonder it can't be smothered
Or buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce
You a Chucky Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer than soft
And I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?
Your predicaments flaw
Flaw means fucked up and serving out the oven not fried, slow roast
No coast, tuck your tail and hide!
You scared?

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Killer Mike]
I officially do it with duns on tour
We lock down traps, push caps galore
My wiz cook work 'til it scale like fish
My old earth even known to handle biz
I serve whipped, out of whips, whip out cash
Usually keep a G-pack on the dash
Try to test my gangsta, I bring harm
I'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes
My Uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar
My waistline hold a 4-pound Baretta
I'll shoelace your face just to learn you better
My ock so sharp it cut through leather
My rap name Killer, my street name Skunk
I mastered the music that was born in the Bronx!
I switch my slang spit from my mouth
I'm still all coast my coast the South!!!

[Hook][Verse 1: André 3000]
I'll be coming around the ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm picking em up and throwing em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cause I slam the sons of bitches
I ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode
Then cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question "Should we take that bullshit from them people?"
I'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of suckas tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me (x4)

[Verse 2: T-Mo]
As I step up, the stage is empty
No words cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' mane
Smoking that dang dang, making mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block
Just like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts
Damn, I'd probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam
To bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B
Don't flex, I'm next, I break necks too
Rolling with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas
Not ducking 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kicking it
Coming around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Khujo]
Khujo, coming in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into capping
Throw in a few more logs, so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked
But you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass
I could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go no holds barred
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Uncaged, Parkay
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...
Dope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chappell Forest, it's gettin horrid
The hunted child is on the prowl, yahhh!!!!!
I let out a call to da wild
I let out a call to da wild[Big Boi]
Zora and Rooster under peachtree
They K-I-SS-I-N-G
Wow first came he love
Now then comes the marriage
1-1-1 baby 2 baby 3 baby carriage baby

[Janelle Monae]
Welcome to my world oceans vs. mountains
(welcome to her world oceans versus mountains)
Call me the poor girl cause I love to fight them
(call her the poor girl cause she loves to fight them)
I'm quite sweet
If you take the time to get to know me
Deep down my heart riles around
Like a bone lost deep inside
See I'd like to fall in love but
Not that type of guy

Oohwee you got my clouds on fire
We're tight rope walking and the world's the wire
Remember kissin on Broadway you die
I was bein your baby and tickin your tock and yo clock
[See we done jumped the broom and now you know I'm good](pending)
And I was dreamin bout children Emily and
Oh darling baby with the daddy's eyes
And it meant so much to me (it meant so much to me)
And I needed your good love
Baby how could you just go and
Change it all you turned my spring to fall
I needed you you know
But when the love is gone it's time to go

[Chrous - Janelle Monae]
If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
I'm up til 3 o'clock in the morning
While you party up til the dawning
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
Darlin' ain't no feelin left it's just the killin
Oh... just grab my gun and lets go out
Just grab my gun and let's go out
It ain't no room for love it's just this burnin
Got me reelin
Call the law and hold the applause
Call the law and hold the applause

[Big Boi]
Oh baby its mo baby its workin on the 6
We was only in our teens our dreams were simplistic
Jumped the broom but it seems I tripped I must have slipped
After exchanging of the rings these things you give me lip
But not the kissing of the bride the dipping of the groom
The shit that make a nigga up and leave up out a room
More like "boohoo" then "boo" "fuck you" and "fuck you too"
(Fuckin bitch) Kids cover them ears
It appears that ya mama want drama we need a comma
Or some space between words for better or for worse
This is not what I deserve the worse that I can take
Actually I want the cake and eat it too and plus yo plate
But wait now.. Don't you get the house kids cars
Everything we built together was ours now it's all yours
Thats hard... It's all yours... Good God!

[Hook - Janelle Monae]

[Janelle Monae & (Big Boi)]
You comin home (Zora)
But the birds are gone (Zora is that a pistol?)
With they sad songs (What you fin' to do wit that?)
They showin off (C'mon baby put the gun down)
But they might be wrong (Shittin me!)
I really wish you could change baby (well if my best ain't good enough
I don't know what to tell ya)
Reclaim your throne (I'm the king of this castle)
Down here in the darkness (c'mon baby hold up!)

[Hook - Janelle Monae]Intro:

Uno, get down, dos, get down (x3)

Uno, get down, uno, dos, tres

College park (stay with us), East Point, Decatur, Downtown Atlanta


[Jagged Edge: Verse 1]

Rollup at the spot, I seen her had to meet her

I was at the bar, sippin' and I'm leanin'

I just, had to get attention, but didn't wanna mention

How, she just wasn't lookin'

And this ain't what I'm feelin'

Now, movin' on, to bout to have you later

And now, she's my girl, I knew that I wasn't playin' and its

Better than my friendship, it's kinda like my pension cause I'm savin' all

My funds up

And I'm gonna spend it long long long...


[Hook: repeat 2X]
She keep me spinnin' like the blades on my rims and

She keep me with it so I can't trade her in and

She keep me bumpin' up and down like a 6 - 4

She keep my engine runnin' hot like a car show


[Verse 2]

She's my movie star and I'm her director

Sweat, in the car, driving as fast as we can go

She could be all on me, kissin' me touching me

I don't wanna stop right now, she don't wanna stop neither
She's a sexy girl, shaped like a coke bottle

Or a fancy car the prototype model

She got cars in all around spots, keep my engine runnin' hot

I don't wanna slow it down, I'mma let her go...


[Hook]


[Big Boi from OutKast]

Now get my damn trophy

The way she movin' like chest and checker

Black white any color gotta respect her

Double decker flat yea body gotta protect her

Together weather the storm to things get better, never

Fall to the waist, I grace, I cry

Lifeless, lemme add some color to that shine

I like this, bittin', fuckin', all of this for nothing

Shoulda gotten an old shit or somethin'

Some old fools bubblin' and that's what we becomin'

See, you used to be comin', when the engine was runnin'

Now ??? and you ain't that woman

Mmm, damn, I hate that frontin'

I hate just bumpin' in just case you was wondering

Most wantin' a million and how you wantin' a hundred

I done done it, I done done it, I done done it, ho, I done done it


[Jagged Edge: Hook 2X]

Up and down like a 6 - 4, party bumpin' hot dro

Droppin' tops and way more, hot like car show

Y'all know how we do, keep it true no see through

Now I gotta roll it and and we bout to roll (out out out)


She keep me spinnin' like them blades on my rims man

She keep me with it so I can't trade her in man

She keep it bumpin up and down like a 6 - 4

She keep my engine runnin' hot like a car show


[Hook]


Ride ride ride...

Feel so good...
