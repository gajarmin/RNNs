Let's begin Now

[Intro:]
You know today I just woke up and I said
You know instead of waitin' on a good day
Waitin' around through up's and down's waitin
On something to happen I just say

[Hook:]
We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

[Verse:]
Hairline fresh, new cologne on
Feelin' so good changed the color to my phone
Orange kool-aid go good with patron
A naw hell naw boy still my ring tones
Free car wash had to clean up the dodge
Get back when I can just playin' my part
Church folk had a fish fry
Mustard, hot sauce, light bread, and french fries
Love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bops
Last night I hit the pick tree bought some Air Force Ones
4 tall tees man I love the Begees

[Hook:]
We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

[Verse:]
We're gonna have a good day
And I fin to worry bout what noboy say
I'm still above ground that's the reason I pray
Got my car cleaned up now I'm ready to play
Make call to the sticks say I'm headin' dat way
Heard my cousin cookin out I gotta get me a plate
Got new outfit ain't even out in the states
So if they ain't speakin' to soon but this is a hell of a day
And these dickies got me sitin' in a hell of a place
Got my stunna shades on and grin on my face
My grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm a okay

[Hook:]
We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

[Verse:]
We might as well do what the children sayin'
Take a day off hit park and just hang
Barbque roll a few and put up your dukes
If it's beef put down the peace up and put down your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good break out your click and grip your wood
And if you ridin' dirty just light your swift and blow yor sss...
But dot real big exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24's do your thang and rep your hood
The world is all yours
But still we all bound forever
In a day the choice you make is relly all fine

[Hook:]
We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good dayYeah, haha Nappy Roots

[Hook]
Awnaw! Hell naw! Man

Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Ah, y'all done up and done it
Man y'all done up and done it

[Fish Scales]
My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hook
You hear me flippin thru my pages out my favorite notebook
The microphone was in the closet (What?) No headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler, (Heeeyy man!)
Always flirtin with all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin I got everything a country boy could ask for

[Big V]
Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!!)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (Say dat boy!!)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin, but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard - stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared of, but what was we afraid for?
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us
Being here is alright, but MUST believe we want more!

Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!
Peep them vertical grills on the ride!
And aw-awww-awww-awwwww!

{Repeat Hook over this part}
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And awwwwwwww!

[Saan/Skinny DeVille]
My yegga, we hogwild, bet that from that roota to that toota-file
Hell naw, them country boys ain't headed south for six miles
Kentucky mud, them kinfolk, twankies with them hundred-spokes
Skullied on that front po'ch, plus you know they got 'dro
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille vertical Caddy grill
Interstate 65 headin down to Cashville
Glass filled, to the tippy-top, back-seat Benz
Spent my last cent on the rent, left with pocket lints
A damn shame, gotta grind anythang and everythang
Jimmy Crack Corn, cross the county line with Mary Jane
A long time, a gravel road, to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back, and back and forth, with same jeans and nappy 'fro

[R Prophit]
I might, hop off the Harley, smoke mine like Bob Marley
Block parties with shawties, wallin like they swallowin Bacardi
Them butter-skin, Prophit gutter like kin
Understand you 'bout to lose ya life fuckin with THEEEMM!

Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!
Peep the vertical grills on the ride!
And aw-awww-awww-awwwww!

{Repeat Hook over this part}

[Hook]
All my life been po'
But it really don't matter no mo'
And they wonder why we act this way
Nappy Boys gon' be okay
All my life been po'
But it really don't matter no mo'
And they wonder why we act this way
Nappy Roots gon' be okay, okay

[Big V]
We came in the game, plain ya see
Average man when the rest was ashamed to be
Nappy head and all, ain't no changin me
Ooooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh...
So rough it was, downright wrong I tell ya
Nobody never gave us nothin but tough time and made us somethin
Different stretch of road, new somethin to see
Every state on the map, a different somethin to eat
Daps and handshakes, it meant nuttin for real
Everybody makin a killin man, showin no feelins
Walkin off collectin pay, it's the way of the world
Can't change it, so I guess I'm gon' pray for the world
Sometimes I ask myself, was I made for the world?
I scream this to you, and I say it to the world
Nappy then, Nappy now - Nappy for a bit
Knee-deep, head over heels in this country shit!

[Hook]

[Skinny DeVille]
Even though I picture better days
I'm thankful for the chance I got to say amen
The Lord done blessed me with his grace, I wish this day would never end
We represent the slums, where we from, we feel they bump
Polish shot off on these presidents, and hardtimes they go and come
Some take up off, without the chance, to make it at all
Who woulda thought Skinny'd be the one that's, makin this call
Lord, help me out, tell me where I went wrong
I'm tryna find a righteous path, although it's, never been long
I gotta do it for my sons, they tellin me, "Daddy be strong"
We gon' make it through these hardtimes
Even though they go and they come
Ya absolutely right, for somethin happen to me on last Tuesday night
It's plain as day, man they... with this World Trade
Naw brave any order but confoldure
Better make it home when nothin seems to matter
That's when, see, everything can go - any which way
They got me fooled, see the Henny with the J
Front po'ch, chillin broke, country folk, I'm Nappy with my ways yo

[Hook]

[R. Prophit]
It's a blessin we woke up this mornin
All my colored folk stressin, come let's join hands
Got to cope with the pressures of bein po' man
Poppa taught me an order, survive for no man
Nappy blossomed from the Roots, course we gon' stand
Prophit grew from a juvenile to a grown man
Ya gotta take responsibility for ya own man
Zonin, two blunts a mo'nin, by sunrise sometimes
I love to hear my woman moanin, it's on again
Damn I hope you play this song again
The soul cleansin, the melody just rev my engine
Not a lot of things but usually just appendin, but lately
Been searchin for Benjamins, saw my folks locked in the tenaments
And it don't make no sense (what) children and sentencin
Broadcastin from the slums, that's why I'm writin these sentences
Just lower my income, (what) though we ain't finish it

[Hook][Verse 1]
Money means nothing
My people mean everything
Promise when I got little money that I will never change
Plus still the same
I kept my feet on earth
And I kept my promise
I kept my people first
My friends and my family help make a man of me
When I was down and out
Ya'll lent a helping hand to me
So I returning the favor
I passing forward
Adversity, don't run away from it run towards it
Face it and brace it
I promise that you could make it
Time spent with your family you should keep that sacred
It's worth more than any amount of money
So I never let the money snatch that from me

[Hook]
People get money and they start acting funny
Its the money that making they world you see
But see if I get some then we all getting something
'Cuz money ain't the world to me
I do it for the people, the people, the people
'Cuz money ain't the world to me
The people the people the people
'Cuz money ain't the world to me

[Verse 2]
Daddy was a garbage man
Mama worked real hard
Me, I'm a common man
And the pi on the lord
Smart smith admit it
You didn't have a million dollars
Only thing you said to me was don't kill you makes you stronger
Humble beginning makes a sweeter ending
Look at Oprah Winfrey, 2Pac, and John Lennon
It rolls it goes
What's your next move?
Now you have a good president what you gon' do
Be a better man
Lend a friend a hand
Grow spiritually
Help out your community
It's the love that mama was cooking
That makes it taste good
It's the people not the money
That makes the neighborhood

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You see I do it for the love
Sometimes I do it just because
But for some reason I can't explain
I didn't do for the bucks
See Nappy Roots is a movement
That hovers a class above
The average and the obvious
Sell the conscious like a lot of this
We struggle from time to time
Did the opposite of a lot of us
But the hard work pays off
I'm leaving proof and promise in this
Educate yourself so when you finally see some dollars and cents
You say you want but proof that soon you're gonna make it
But make it to your grandchildren's kids
Because they are the future
We are the ones that are damaging it
Abuse is an opportunity with revolution, and contaminants
Don't make any damn sense
His movie doesn't have a sequel
If you don't do for you and your kids
Then do it for the rest of the people

[Hook][Hook - Anthony Hamilton]
I'm sick and tired of bein criticized
I'm sick and tired of barely gettin by
I'm sick and tired of not livin right
I'm sick and tired of bein sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of bein pushed aside
I'm sick and tired of callin folks for rides
I'm sick and tired of this petty life
I'm sick and tired of bein sick and tired

[Big V]
What is life? What is makin it? For peace is there a price?
They tell me if you rich you only got to worry about more shit
The house, and the car notes, child support and kin people
Kick those, "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems" that's how the shit goes

[B. Stille]
Man, I'm gettin tired of runnin and duckin (quit runnin then)
Specially when I ain't did nothin (do somethin then)
Out here in these cold streets hustlin
Po', tryin to make this dough, before the police bustin in

[Scales]
And then it's what it coulda been, shoulda been
Find yourself outside lookin in, givin up, feelin stuck
Mad at the world cause you down and they gettin up
Mad at yourself cause you know you shouldn't be givin up

[Skinny Deville]
I'm tired and sick, of bummin rides, on top of that my nine to five
Sucks for a couple bucks and change, now what's the reason why?
My luck, don't amount to fuck, no matter how hard I try
I'm stuck in a 22, now +catch+ me when I'm sick and tired

[Hook]

[Ron Clutch]
Prophet, check this out
I'm gettin tired of mama breakin her neck for the paycheck
They makin her sweat, seem like everyday she stressed

[R. Prophet]
I've had up to here with pussy footers actin like we owe you somethin
Let's see you-know-who like I'm supposed to throw you somethin

[Ron Clutch]
I'm gettin tired of daddy puchin the clock, scarin his knuckles
He tired of the hustle, he feel the pain deep in his muscles

[R. Prophet]
Seems like the media portray us against bein rich
Like we shouldn't enjoy shrimp and occasional trips

[Ron Clutch]
While my baby brother scrappin with his baby mother
Deep down I know he love her but he shoulda worn a rubber

[R. Prophet]
I'm sick and tired of players down to do us bodily harm
Like them Country Boys ain't at the range firing arms

[Ron Clutch]
And my little sister think she grown, wanna make it on her own
I ain't bring you in this world, but you still my baby girl

[R. Prophet]
I'm fed up when I feel like this
My yeagas keep your heads up, we pray and kneel for this

[Hook]

[Big V]
Keep it real, remember God, don't change, sign this
Don't forget where you come from, you got some money gimme some
You different, fuck you, man I got your first tape
You always gon' be Vito to me, so get out my face

[Scales]
(I know what you mean dog)
Tired of people who complain, always 'bout the same thing
First you learn to maintain, after that create change
See we gettin up and gettin out
Playa what you jokin and you kiddin 'bout?
Change is what we gettin out

[Skinny Deville]
What they say? I ain't livin well
All day and night, I struggle hustle just to pay the dues
Now I gotta keep the lights on and ain't got no time for lay and snooze
Damn man, who made these rules? Wasn't thinking 'bout no William Hughes
I'm sick and tired but I can't stop, no matter if they say I lose

[B. Stille]
Yup, we still smoke weed, and my wife is curious
'bout how much she can get me on for life insurance
But still was bummin, no problem, that's when life was purist
"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems" - that's right Notorious

[Hook 2x](Lil Yuk)
Boy say to me, he say, "Ay Yuk! What's yo favorite city?"
And I say "West Virginia.  That's my home town."

Chorus:
Take me back to West V-A
Take me back to Charleston
It's them doggone busy city streets
That I'm ridin' to get far from
Ridin' to a small town
Ridin' to a small town
Take me back to Massachusetts
Take me back to Cape Cod
It's them doggone big ol' city buildings
I'm ridin' to escape from
Ridin' to a small town
Ridin' to a small town

(B. Stille)
Yo, uh, ridin' past beautiful cow fields
Top down see how the air feels
I see trees that was here before me
Seem like each one's telling a story
I just wanna go hit the local bar
Where the owner's fat and smoke cigars
Where country girls attracted me
Like everybody works in a factory
Where they ship they goods to bigger places
A city lights just could never replace this
Where high school sports is what we live for
Hit the lotto and next week you still poor
In a small town

Chorus:
Take me back to West V-A
Take me back to Charleston
It's them doggone busy city streets
That I'm ridin' to get far from
Ridin' to a small town
Ridin' to a small town
Take me back to Massachusetts
Take me back to Cape Cod
It's them doggone big ol' city buildings
I'm ridin' to escape from
Ridin' to a small town
Ridin' to a small town

(Ron Clutch)
They say the whole damn world is country
Small town livin', not a porch monkey
Dirt road and gravel, anywhere you travel
Mechanic is the sheriff is the judge with the gavel
Everybody cousin, cuz everybody kin
Piggly Wiggly one school everybody friends
From high school football to family reunions
Movin' at the speed of life drunk by noon and
That's my uncle, I know everybody got one
Freaky-ass white girl, daddy got a shotgun
Fly through the town, ya blink ya might miss it
City slicker in the country wish you come visit

Come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down

Lil' Yuk, what you think about that right there?

(Lil' Yuk)
Like, man, uh, I like North Carolina.  I like Kentucky, Tennessee, like...
I don't wanna, I wanna see something important and take a right and right there at it
I don't like all that traffic.  I like to get where I'm going
I like people with things on they man like, "Let's have a good time, let's sit on the porch."
That's what I was telling my homeboy Plump down in Duluth.  You know, in Georgia
We was gonna kick it and do it way big.  He always show us around at the office
And like why you go to the office?
I'm like "Man it's some real people comin' from a small town."
And that's where I'm from.  And that's where I do rappin'
That's Nappy Roots.  That's Fish Scales, and that's Clutch
An that's B. Stille and that's Skinny Deville, that's V
That's, that's history, man
You know when you from the country everything's cool, you know
Give us a front porch, give us a thing of Patron and give us
You know a few Corona, a Red Stripe.  You know, things like that
Budweiser if ya money's low.  But we gonna have a good time, man
We comin from a small town.  Bowling Green, Kentucky
Milledgeville, Georgia.  You know thangs like that
I like Keepwater(??) Mississippi, you know, Florida
All them places like that, small town
Still love for LA and Chicago, but when I wanna kick I wanna be in a small town

Chorus:
Take me back to West V-A
Take me back to Charleston
It's them doggone busy city streets
That I'm ridin' to get far from
Ridin' to a small town
Ridin' to a small town
Take me back to Massachusetts
Take me back to Cape Cod
It's them doggone big ol' city buildings
I'm ridin' to escape from
Ridin' to a small town
Ridin' to a small townNow ain't nothing gonna stop me
And I'mma stand on my own
And throw "L's" for my Ol' Kentucky Home
Yeah it's grimy down here but it's all hood
We keep a big block engine under our hood
Now if I make money then the city make money
It's all good they get nothing but love from me
Cus I was born here (born here!) raised here (Raised here!)
When I leave here, bury my grave here
Until then I'mma ride and drink liquor, blow Swishers
Sit back collect my thoughts by the river
I'm a bluegrass CEO cat
Trying to get my young homies out the projects
Show them a way they can turn they money legal
When the feds start to sweep I bob and weave on them people
Stay ahead of the game, quick to change it up on 'em
Set a level for the game quick to raise it up on 'em
Bluegrass, KD

Chorus
It's okay, hop in with your boys to the river and we taking the back way
We don't mind who you are just ride to the rhythm have a sip in the sunshine
Come on down where the bluegrass rolls, and the country cold wind blows
Where the city lights still glow
To My Ol' Kentucky Home, My Ol' Kentucky Home

Hi mayne, chillin' by the river, dawg
Old school shotgun fishin pole and liquor dawg
I ain't tryin to catch no kinda bass or catfish
Id rather sling rocks on ave of the back chick??
Scales this track is hot lets make it a smash hit
They hating on my mess and ya see I get mad chips
In kentucky smash whips
And kentucky blast crips
In kentucky it ain't lucky to get found in a casket
Ya im city living chillin but im country at heart
Old school no shoes when we roll threw the park
Old dudes no rules when we roll threw the park
Goodfella hood dwella reppin' Victory Park
And that chicken's finger lickin and the digits got me finger lickin'
Countin' scrilla from the chickens that I be pitchin' out the kitchen
Trying to make a 100 million out this business
Goodfella, KD, Villebillies, Nappy Roots chillin

Chorus

They say welcome to the 502
Taking Georgia boys show em how Kentucky do
Old caprice classics paint Kentucky blue
They say don't forget 270 we hittin' too
Some call it blue grass some call it purple
I'mma call it home, take a shot of p'trone
Lay back in the 'Lac and take two to the dome
Riding from Da Ville to B.G. in my zone

Let me here you say
High times sittin' by the river
Got my old shotgun fishin' pole and my liquor

Cus people always trying to tell me how to run my life
When they say I'm doing wrong and I swear I'm doing right

High times sittin' by the river
Got my old shotgun fishin' pole and my liquor

I say it's time to take our children where the grass is blue
And peep how the mid south do

Chorus[Hook]
Tell us no, but we ain't gon' stop saying yeah
Gotta keep on marching this road 'till we make it to the top
And we ain't gon' stop, no, we ain't gon' stop, no
No, we ain't gon' stop, no
No, we ain't gon' stop, no, 'till we make it to the top
And we ain't gon' stop, no, we ain't gon' stop, no

[Verse 1]
Yesterday we made it through, but what about tomorrow?
Everything we thought was wrong, we locked it in a bottle
The world we from, too many coming in the pain and sorrow
Dollar, can I borrow? Yup, yup, that is the motto
Follow your heart and you can never get the wrong direction
Listen to yourself before you ask someone what they suggesting
If any question, raise your hand and make it known
No, no, no, you're not alone, come on and sing right along
You have to master what's internal first then shout it out
We gotta help each other up and build without a doubt
Then it's still a sense of pride inside this greedy house
Rise above this petty shit and I where I sit it's a hit
Look how far we came, maintain the faith and keep a grip
Trust in hell will never fail, what he like is strong, black males
To teach the youth, that's why we need to speak the truth
Nappy's only a part of it, but we can't forget the roots

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sweet from my mama dukes, pops he can come too
I ain't scared of hatred, for snakes I got a mongoose
(?) got my back, (?) got my back
Big brother Ronny was with me before my (similac?)
A-town's where I live, KY where I grew
Milledgeville where I'm born, to this day I put it on
Plan to show the world to my people who ain't never flown
Hit the hood, scoop some kids, take 'em where they never gone
Find out my partner's on parole, help him get along
Grab me a single mother, take her out and get her home
Roxanne Adams be the angel that I'm leaning on
Even when I'm weak she be the reason I be seeming strong
Elevate your mind up, straighten up your spine cause
Heaven's up above and you can't know when your time come
Sweet potato pie, whipped cream, man, I'm killing it
Man, it be the simple things in life that be the realest shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Unstoppable forces, immovable objects
Circumstances forced us to move out the projects
It's a slow process, but there's no progress
Without struggle, Frederick Douglass
That's before the drugs hit
Banging 'Pac in my uncle's '87 Cutlass
Smotking out, thugging, screaming only God can judge us
If everybody does their parts like assembly lines
Would eat when it's dinner time, sprinting to the finish line
It feels better breaking bread with your brethren
Individually we hell, but together we heaven
Use the open door policy to exit whenever
That's the only way the family ties could ever be severed
It's Nappy forever in capital letters
Like birds with feather we flocking together
I ride for my fellas 'til closed shop
Taking odds off top, let's march on the hop
Can't stop 'til me make it to the top

[Hook]Yeah, haha Nappy Roots
Awwnaw!

[Hook]
Awnaw! Hell naw! Man
Y'all done up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy

Hated for for the cussin, but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard - stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared of, but what was we afraid for?
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us
Being here is alright, but MUST believe we want more!

Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Ah, y'all done up and done it
Man y'all done up and done it

[Fish Scales]
My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hooks
You hear me flippin thru my pages out my favorite notebooks
The microphone was in the closet, no headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler
Always flirtin with all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin I got everything a country boy could ask for

[Big V]
Now what we do to get here? (say that boy)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (say that boy)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin, but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard, stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared of, but what was we afraid for?
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us
Being here is alright, but must believe we want more!

[Jazze Pha]
Them country boys on the rise
With them big fat wheels on the side
Peep them vertical grills on the ride
And awww-aw-aww-aw
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And awwwww

[Skinny DeVille]
My yegga, we hogwild, bet that from that roota to that toota file
Hell naw, them country boys ain't headed south for six miles
Kentucky mud, them kinfolk, twankies with them hundred spokes
Skullied on that front porch, plus you know they got dro
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille vertical Caddy grill
Interstate 65 heading down to Cashville
Glass filled, to the tippy top, back seat Benz
Spent my last cent on the rent, left with pocket lints
A damn shame, gotta grind anything and everything
Jimmy Crack Corn, cross the county line with Mary Jane
A long time, a gravel road, to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back, and back and forth, with same jeans and nappy 'fro

[R. Prophit]
I might, hop off the Harley, smoke mine like Bob Marley
Block parties with shawties, wallin like they swallowin Bacardi
Them butter-skin, Prophit gutter like kin
Understand you 'bout to lose ya life fuckin with them

[Jazze Pha]
Them country boys on the rise
With them big fat wheels on the side
Peep them vertical grills on the ride

[Cam'Ron]
Killer, uh, when it come to New York
I'm the man around town, just trust me
Down in the buggy, I that cat down in Kentucky
Outta Bowling Green, heard ya holding cream
Mess with a city slicker, we could mould the team
We'll talk in code, smoker be the sandbox
Could be the ham hocks, or be the lamb chops
We'll make wild mills, how ill
I'll show you how that denial feel, trade in that cow grill

[Twista]
Finna head south, get up out the city
Smokin' on a fifty, feelin' pretty good
With a hood chick, gotta hit a little bit
Now she call me daddy in a caddy full of wood
Call me country, TV's on the headrest
Even if there ain't no seats in the back of me
I play the DVD's, for the cars on the streets
And the people in back of me
I'm trailin', a chevy with a grill or the black cadillac, got the option
If it ain't got rims when the drop on the block with no locks than it's not my concoction
Hurt 'em with the chrome, rollin' on chrome rims it's the twenties
This Nappy Roots and Twista, if it ain't dope then don't call it country

[Jazze Pha]
Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!
Peep the vertical grills on the ride!
And aw-awww-awww-awwwww!
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills

[Skinny DeVille]
Nigga hooked it up, like the waitress from the IHOP
Nothin but the grits, steak, and egg with that
Waitin for the five dollar pancake, front-back side to side
Impala, country boy, Cadillac, cat sick in the Monte Carlo
All clean (twenty inches) at the seam (plenty chickens)
Get the green (spit the swishers) at the Beam (shit done seem)
Craziest muh'fucker, what y'all niggas do for cream
Never knock the hustle scheme, only what the cheddar bring
Hate, fake-niggas, hoes, envy, greed, jealousy
Cain't take what a nigga make type of enemy
Smilin in my face but they really ain't no friend to me
Cain't wait, send em eight straight nine milli-mee
Aww hell naw, y'all niggas ain't feelin me!
Colt 45 e'rytime like Billy D
Ninety-five (?) leave through Tennessee
Quarter pound with the chron' fuckin wit my memory

[Fish Scales]

Blunts rolled so fat, put one in my back
Plus a buncha country boys wit gats, you don't want none-a that
Keep - my nine - right beside me, at all times
Cuz I be in the line, like somma these niggas you find
Don't want you to shine, right yea..

[R. Prophit]
From the side and nine-to-nine
Roll around here somethin tryna sell mine

[Fish Scales]

And if you ain't wit that, we can show you where the do' at

[Hook: All]

[Hook 2]

*music to fade*Chorus (repeat)
Gotta get a plan to get us out of here
You got a fast car
Managed to save just a little bit of money
You got a fast car

Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
Don't matter, long as my chest on every line I spit
Folk that want to know what makes rhyme plus tick ??
I tell them unconditional love for my click
What don't kill me only makes me tough
So much building up it's going make me bust
Cold cold world better not freeze up
Keep the pressure on can't afford to ease up
Move at the speed of light can't slow down
Chasing a dollar make the world go 'round
Jump in the truck in pursuit of some happiness
Got to get back to the roots of my Nappyness
Things ain't always what they supposed to be
Open my eyes see what I'm supposed to see
Ain't really sure what I'm supposed to be
My brother broke it down that's what he told to me

Chorus

I'm doing 90 in the slow lane but whats the rush
I gotta get my shit together cus I'm losing it, plus
You know that time waits for no man
We get it and grind
So maybe one day we'll be able to sit and recline
But right now let me plot, and scheme, and try to get mine
I'mma lay it on the line for my son or my daughter
Saved up a few dollars, couple nickels and quarters
Let's get out of here within a year we triple our quota
No 'buts...', no need to slow up just look in my eye
You'll see I'm no lie, everything I talk and I try
It's ride or die in my Cadi hoes walking up blind ??
We gonna make it to our destination always on time
And I ain't got too many seconds to be wasting on crying
If I rewind, that's the only reason I'm flying
I'm wide open on I-65 across the county line
And if you down like they say come on hop in, I'll drive

Chorus

I been here before...

No static got an automatic
Blowing weed as I weave through the traffic
Wonder how it ain't me in a casket
Trying to hustle selling D's for a Classic
I wanted more than just D's on a Classic
I wanted money where my people can have shit
And I ain't stopping 'til I have that
Tell my niggas locked up those some years we got to have back
Ma and Pa still living in the same house
We could make a million dollars and they don't change house
Population 30 thou and we all poor
The whole world think we slow and we all know
One high school 25 liquor store
Move to the city go and live with the rich folks
But I swear I'm coming back Ma
Shed tears as I jump in my fast car

ChorusLet's begin Now

[Intro:]
You know today I just woke up and I said
You know instead of waitin' on a good day
Waitin' around through up's and down's waitin
On something to happen I just say

[Hook:]
We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

[Verse:]
Hairline fresh, new cologne on
Feelin' so good changed the color to my phone
Orange kool-aid go good with patron
A naw hell naw boy still my ring tones
Free car wash had to clean up the dodge
Get back when I can just playin' my part
Church folk had a fish fry
Mustard, hot sauce, light bread, and french fries
Love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bops
Last night I hit the pick tree bought some Air Force Ones
4 tall tees man I love the Begees

[Hook:]
We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

[Verse:]
We're gonna have a good day
And I fin to worry bout what noboy say
I'm still above ground that's the reason I pray
Got my car cleaned up now I'm ready to play
Make call to the sticks say I'm headin' dat way
Heard my cousin cookin out I gotta get me a plate
Got new outfit ain't even out in the states
So if they ain't speakin' to soon but this is a hell of a day
And these dickies got me sitin' in a hell of a place
Got my stunna shades on and grin on my face
My grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm a okay

[Hook:]
We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

[Verse:]
We might as well do what the children sayin'
Take a day off hit park and just hang
Barbque roll a few and put up your dukes
If it's beef put down the peace up and put down your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good break out your click and grip your wood
And if you ridin' dirty just light your swift and blow yor sss...
But dot real big exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24's do your thang and rep your hood
The world is all yours
But still we all bound forever
In a day the choice you make is relly all fine

[Hook:]
We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good dayYo
Alright
It's that new Wooden Leather

[Skinny Deville]
Yo, well it's a new day, full off them grits
You cooked the Sunday meal at 6
Lets get it while this gettin good cause Granny ain't gon' live forever
Season changin, we like these dependin on the weather
Look what we doin, summer's ruined, fall y'all pack y'all sweater
Somebody told me war was comin, y'all just stack y'all cheddar, better
I checked my mail the other day and Sam done sent a letter
I opened it and line for line it said I was a sucka
The nerve of this motherfucker, claimin he's my uncle
Good God almighty, Lord have mercy, think that we's in trouble
Please send some help like quick, fast, do it on the double (9-1-1)
The line been busy for days, hell maybe weeks
I've been tossin and turnin, back and forth, ensurin my 40 winks

[Ron Clutch]
Yeah I feel you dude
I be watchin the tube, toastin the rude
Notice the news ain't nothin but scandals and murder
War and destruction, poor keep sufferin
Lord it's troublin, the more you be hustlin the more you strugglin

[Hook - Skinny DeVille] (R. Prophet)
Well good God almighty look at what we have here
(And it feels so good to be herrrrrre)
I said good God almighty look at what we have here
(Welcome, this is Wooden Leather)
Well good God almighty look at what we have here
(And it feels so good to be herrrrrre)
I said good God almighty look at what we have here
(This is now Wooden Leather)

[Big V]
Trouble in my life got me hollerin baby
We be at 'em poor so I'm goin crazy
Anthrax on letters, little daddy just paged me
War got me worried, I been prayin lately
How will I live? Listen here, "life is still a bitch"
Money don't change shit, stuck in the same shit
To get it all, gotta risk it all or forget it dawg
A winner ain't a quitter and a quitter ain't a winner

[R. Prophit]
I just be steppin around the block cause I was doin my thing
My crew been kickin off all them rocks, just let my cellular ring
V said he heard a couple of shots, word is that they copped them a sting
I burn shit once my lyric drop, one false move and you're stained
We're pushin 'em 10 dollars a pop and I got exact change
It's like investin in NASDAQ had me caught in the rain
I'm 'bout to pull the mask out and have 'em screamin in vain
And I be puttin them tracks out and it's all for the brain

[Hook]

[B. Stille] - *singing*
Well we done seen everything under the sun
And been done what shouldn'ta been done
Y'all never heard of the blacks still young
Now that's one bad son-of-a-gun

[B. Stille] - *rapping*
Steppin out in the cowboy banana brim
Once you rockin camel skin like damn a Timb
DJ make this record spin, let my family in
Management go get the checks so we can begin

[Scales]
Well if it's good never turn it down
Wood still burn it down
And learn how to handle them
Plans you can cancel them (cancel them)

[R. Prophit] - *singing*
What you know no good
And what you know no good
What you know no good
And what you know no good

[Hook]Use your head silly...

[Hook]
Where yo' head at?
Shawty, where yo' head at?
Show me where yo' head at
Shawty, where yo' head at? (that's all I know)

[B. Stille]
Y'all ain't never heard of B. Stille, the look that seals
Screwed up coupe DeVille, peep the vertical grill
Well Killa Cowboy pull the dirty cowbell
Hell anyway ya do the certified playa
The thickest, the thicker, the better, the pick of the litter
The sicker the chicken, the bigger the dick I deliver
The kidney, the liver, the shiver, the give in her BACK
Make the bigger the nigger deliver the miggity-MACK!

[R. Prophit]
Y'all so ridiculous, hoes all up in my businesses
Got 'em stuffin up my tennant biz
My friend is here, so come around actin shady
I warned ya like (Dick Tracy) like Warren Beatty
Prophit hit it, 2-3-4-5
Kicked it off, 6-7-8-9, from behind
10-11-12, I'm... a glad man slingin geni-til y'all

[Hook: Big V + (Prophit)] - 2X
Want that, get that - (here we come now)
Jump back, get back - (keep it goin now)

"She gon' lemme cut that's all I know" [-- B. Stille

[Hook] - 2X

[Ron Clutch]
I'm bout to leave ya juice joint
Drunk as a mug, drunk out his mind
Too damn drunk to drive, jump out the ride
Lookin for a chicken to pluck, with plumped up thighs
Gotta be thicker than Granny's gravy on the side
So when I get it, I can cut her, big ol' chunky slice
And if I love it, I'mma lick it like it's pumpkin pie
Now you guys don't really want it 'less it's country fried
Now tell me whatcha really know about the country side

[Skinny DeVille]
I been in the wild slums po'
Now won'chu tell me whattcha'll know about them country folk
With all the chicken wing and fish and the dirty spokes
My yeaga smoke, betta sell and twank, and blowin smoke
(That fool cool ain't a thang) Look how that Caddy roll
On them twenty-two like Muddy move the fuck and blow

"She gon' let me cut, that's all I know..."[Hook]
Askin me

How I do, getting money tryna break through the ground
How I do, look good in my suit and my crown
Got plans for the city and we laying them down

[Verse 1]
How I do, when I'm riding down 20
I never ride a charger unless I know I got a Henny
She never ride me unless she know I got a temmy
And I smoking [?], getting good by the plenty
And late night [?]
[?]
...driving like a Bentley

[Hook x2]Got a cheese sandwich on the hunnid spoke
Pork rinds and a soda pop
I told a cop I'd beat it, lost
At 3 a.m., they told up "stop"
We got it real real, to the top
A G like 30 feet away from the county line
The weed flyin, the golden smilin
Wip it nice an then they sign
Man, fuck
How denyin' my damn luck
This ain't no find if we get stuck I'm doin time
Don't get messy with the Prezzy
A quarter pound ain't worth the rizzy
Drunk as hell, then hurl the fifth
Back an forth we swerve and dip
Pumpkin pie
Bust a cop
I'll be damned, they took my crop
Shook 'em wit that lead foot an hit about a hunid fi (105)
Miles per hour
In the country wit the pudin, good an chunky

Got to be that early bird

Quick to burn an an can't mesquite it
Lord I need it fore the third
Serve anybody? Hell naw, got to be for sure
Standin on the standard curb
Days begin to bend an blurred

Homegrown bacon
Yeah, I'm havin the wage
Tendency of a 50 hit, when its about gettin payed
Came along with a ragin theif hidin under the shade
An momma won't quit buggin me about my heathenish ways
Now I've wasted more tears then my mouth cold beer
Gotta be a Man on these rolls, overcomin my fears
Body too quick to gaze, with they head on bob
Get dee, life is foul but the dirt is hard, yeah! (hustla)

Chorus:
If you play the cards you delt, then you stuggle, got to put in work (hustla)
And I got to be the early bird to grind and get what I deserve (hustla)
If you play the cards you delt, then you stuggle, got to put in work (hustla)

No scrill, no deal, fifth weel, big grill
Wood grain sturnweel, weigh it up, be still

Hustla. Carry many meanings..

Bootleg alcohol, or runnin the ball
You must get it in. You was born a hustla
An you a die a hustla. Prophit, hit 'em wit it

For life in a ballance, of it

You know how we be, on some country-fried kill
I'm from the south side of Da Ville, and we all about the real
Better keep ya eyes peeled, Clutch behind the wheel
Better pimp that space-ship with the verti-cal grilles
Got the big ol' shiny wheels, to tell me how I feel
I named her Miss Piggy and she stay in them high heels
We swervin through the galaxy in a alternate reality
You know how the Caddy be, defy the laws of gravity
We travel at a faster speed to charge up my battery
Bottle and a bag of weed, now ain't nobody catchin me
You know how Nappy be, you know how the boys do it
You know we get straight to it, then we run straight through it
A. Leon Craft just landed, you know he stay zooted (Cough-cough-cough)
Off this country-fried backwoods, outer-space music

(Hook)
When them country boys come out, at night
Space-ships go up, in flight
Nothing your eyes, have seen
What do you know, bout me
Yeah, what you know about me
Uhh, yeah, what you know about me
Uhh, yeah, what you know about me
With my top down blowin on top pedigree, yeah

(Outro)
This has been a Chops production*Cars revving*

[Hook 4x - Nappy Roots]
(Yes) Oh yes it's them Lac Dogs, Caddy Hogs and D.T.S.'s
(Oh yes) It's them Lac Dogs, Caddy Hogs and D.T.S.'s

[Verse 1 - Skinny Deville]
Skinny talkin bout that wood with that custom leather, bangin down I-65
Slaw and slum but dubs are better, who you think gon' keep it live?
It's Nappy bitch, what have to come
Pay attention, learn your lesson, yup
We them country folk with Caddy Hogs and D.T.S.'s, Lac Dogs
What you think that Nappy gon' be broke forever? Shit naw
Hit the bank and cashin in on old investments
What, you ain't know about them country fried sessions?
Does that Likwit hit in '97 +Answer+ all yo' +Questions+?
Kentucky's on the map now, who you think done gave directions?
From the top and back down, we rep the country to perfection
Don't it look so slum with 55 from New York down to Texas?
Hella poor straight from the South and haters must respect this

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ron Clutch]
(Let me tell you about it)
When I first got my baby she could barely start
A-hand-me-down from a real O.G., all day she stayed in park
Almost never did she drive
Born in 1979
And she weighed about a ton
Big ol' body built to run
First thing I done, hauled her over, had her hummin G notes
Underneath her hood, hundreds of horses powered her ego
Her government name was Coup Deville but I called her Miss Piggy
Top her with some (?) and fit her for some twenties (twenties)
Playas hate that I be trickin like she's all that I'm love with
So we took her to the edge and shoved it and still "Ball out on a Budget"
Dug in her guts, laced her up with leather and wood
Together it go good, us country boys forever stay hood

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - B. Stille]
You shove that shit that go bump bump bump bump
And ya, shake the lock off her muh'fucker trunk
When ya, hit the block make her muh'fucker jump
Roll your window down, stop, look like somethin like a pimp
Roll that window back up, and show 'em they reflection and their ultrafade
Then chop on that sucka like Wesley's +Blade+
Escalade D.T.S., switch it up, keep them haters on they toes
Red Rolls, Fleetwood hoes
Can't believe it, when they see them twenty fo's, believe it
My ham and cheese the freshest
Now what I'm talkin bout? I give you three guesses

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Big V]
You feel the wind, don't ya?
You hear the tires squallin
Kentucky, Colorado, Boston down to New Orleans
Big bodies get it done, Dodge Ram preferably
Cause they do run run, they do run run
Black magic, lookin better then Wesson fryin a pan of fish
Gangsta leanin like they do in Los Angeles (that's gangsta)
Adjective, describin what I'm rollin in
Them country fellas ain't gon' stop it, we on the road again

[R. Prophet]
God damn, yes I am, the thriller with the skrilla
Got plans, Pac fan +Strictly 4 my N.I.G.G.A.Z.+
Stop starin, we not playin
Armor color kryptonite
Rims nice but thank God our dreams came to life
Fast roller, cash swoll up
The mind mold up
The crowd hold us
Soldiers quick to throw they rags when I roll up
Dimes is quarters
Sell liquor, my rhymes is colder
Prophet never look this fine since I grinded Cola
Roll up(Intro, Fish Scales)
Uhh, that's right
Uhh, know what it is

(Verse 1, Fish Scales)
I remember mixtape exclusive, no name producers
You wasn't hot til' you sold by all boosters
Run up in the chicken coop, corner the rooster
We used to call that "jammin the chickens"
Them the old days, god damnit I miss 'em
We was rappin 'for we knew what it was
We was rappin for a reason to cuss
Now I just rap cause I'm fuckin in love with it
Kinda shy guy, so I had to go public with it
Hip-hop and Fish Scales and a blue-jean wedding
Had twins called Hell and Heaven
Nobody really knows when they watchin a legend, til' he gone
Til' y'all kingdome come, in God's name
Come back like Christ and demand for his throne
Rock oil, I don't fuck with cologne
That's why these neo-soul bitches can't leave me alone, I'm gone

(Hook, Skinny DeVille)
Yuh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Ha, uh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Ha, uh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Yuh, uh, I live and die for this shit
Damn straight, I'mma ride for my bitch, ha

(Verse 2, Skinny DeVille)
Yuh, and I do what I gotta
Live for this shit, and I prolly die bout it
Time to switch it up, the game done got too crowded
All you niggas shuckin and jivin, I doubt it
Dealin this and killin that, lame sound childish
The only trap is in ya brain, nigga snap outta it
Ain't nothin wrong, bein smart, black, and proud of it
We all came a long way, we got a thousand miles to get, shit
But ain't I allowed to vent?
We need more cuttin in, but still they sound a bit like whoever
Got a hit and probably out now
Welcome to the city of men, it's goin downtown
But I am from a part of the slum, where the hustle is brung
Where they think that success wouldn't come
I am hip-hop, and a student to some
Professor to most, I'm coming second-to-none, I'm hollin'

(Hook, Skinny DeVille)
Yuh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Ha, uh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Ha, uh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Yuh, uh, I live and die for this shit
Damn straight, I'mma ride for my bitch

(verse 3, Ron Clutch)
Yeah, they figured hip-hop's a fad, it would die out quick
But it spread like wild fires, got the whole world lit
Can't stop boppin they head, they bumpin our shit
B.G.'s to germany, got 'em pumpin they fists
Got soldiers all over, gettin crunk in this bitch
Shoot up the charts with number one hits
Shoot up the club, with a full clip
How you like us now? The whole world's on our dick, yeah
Hip-hop, the love of my life, my girl, my bitch
My wife, my soul-mate, without her I'm sick
Tie the knot, jump the broom, we a perfect fit
No pre-nup, she was with me before I was rich
We fell in love when we was just kids
And see no love lasts as long as this
Til' death do us part, God forbid we split
Let nothin break this relationshipNow ain't nothing gonna stop me
And I'mma stand on my own
And throw "L's" for my Ol' Kentucky Home
Yeah it's grimy down here but it's all hood
We keep a big block engine under our hood
Now if I make money then the city make money
It's all good they get nothing but love from me
Cus I was born here (born here!) raised here (Raised here!)
When I leave here, bury my grave here
Until then I'mma ride and drink liquor, blow Swishers
Sit back collect my thoughts by the river
I'm a bluegrass CEO cat
Trying to get my young homies out the projects
Show them a way they can turn they money legal
When the feds start to sweep I bob and weave on them people
Stay ahead of the game, quick to change it up on 'em
Set a level for the game quick to raise it up on 'em
Bluegrass, KD

Chorus
It's okay, hop in with your boys to the river and we taking the back way
We don't mind who you are just ride to the rhythm have a sip in the sunshine
Come on down where the bluegrass rolls, and the country cold wind blows
Where the city lights still glow
To My Ol' Kentucky Home, My Ol' Kentucky Home

Hi mayne, chillin' by the river, dawg
Old school shotgun fishin pole and liquor dawg
I ain't tryin to catch no kinda bass or catfish
Id rather sling rocks on ave of the back chick??
Scales this track is hot lets make it a smash hit
They hating on my mess and ya see I get mad chips
In kentucky smash whips
And kentucky blast crips
In kentucky it ain't lucky to get found in a casket
Ya im city living chillin but im country at heart
Old school no shoes when we roll threw the park
Old dudes no rules when we roll threw the park
Goodfella hood dwella reppin' Victory Park
And that chicken's finger lickin and the digits got me finger lickin'
Countin' scrilla from the chickens that I be pitchin' out the kitchen
Trying to make a 100 million out this business
Goodfella, KD, Villebillies, Nappy Roots chillin

Chorus

They say welcome to the 502
Taking Georgia boys show em how Kentucky do
Old caprice classics paint Kentucky blue
They say don't forget 270 we hittin' too
Some call it blue grass some call it purple
I'mma call it home, take a shot of p'trone
Lay back in the 'Lac and take two to the dome
Riding from Da Ville to B.G. in my zone

Let me here you say
High times sittin' by the river
Got my old shotgun fishin' pole and my liquor

Cus people always trying to tell me how to run my life
When they say I'm doing wrong and I swear I'm doing right

High times sittin' by the river
Got my old shotgun fishin' pole and my liquor

I say it's time to take our children where the grass is blue
And peep how the mid south do

Chorus[Big V]
Heyyyyyy!
One of em's fat and loud, second one's black and proud
Third one's drunk and wild, fourth one slim and sly
One of em's just shy, last one young and wise
Homegrown, battle tested, you gon' love these guys
Brotherhood all you got, the best story told yet
Bonded against all odds, ain't no tearin them apart
Swore, panic, vile, till death do 'em in
Even in reincarnation they would do it again

[Ron Clutch]
Who would ever thought six different strands would lock together, locked forever
Rockin +Leather and Wood+, told you +Chicken and Grits+ go good
With some +Watermelon+ albums sellin coast to coast, across the seas
Gave everything we could, our tears, our sweat, our blood, cause

[Hook - Nappy Roots]
I am because we are, we are because I am
Everbody say (We are a holiday)
Now throw your hands to the sky, turn up the music just right
We representin, why? (We are a holiday)
We are because I am, I am because we are
Hey, it's Nappy Roots Day! (We are a holiday)
Now throw your hands to the sky, bounce to the music we write
We represintin, why? (We are a holiday)

[B. Stille] (R. Prophet)
Now we stronger than wood, playa (we tougher than leather)
Us yeaga's hustle together (uh-uh, not just for the cheddar)
Look here we trustin each other (say, "um you fuck with my brother?")
You gotta suffer the repercussions, we come from the gutter
(White Kangol, white classics, striking suit with the matches)
Capitals came from the ostrich, blowin smoke out the nostrils
(Prolly trouble with student loans, we struggle for too long)
But now we can move on, put that on my tombstone
WE ARE BECAUSE I AM, AIN'T HARD TO UNDERSTAND IT
Far from a shootin star (rather play on my planet)
Power, respect (demand it) to us nothin was handed
PLAY IT AS LOUD AS YOU CAN AND, SAY IT JUST HOW WE PLANNED IT

[Hook]

[R. Prophet]
Bring out your kids and treat 'em, cotton candy plus freedom
Raise one for cows and feed 'em, sweet as Shirly Temple's singin
Clown on the carousel horse, spin on the ferris wheel
Its magic floatin, smokin, takin up a call from Fish Scales

[Scales]
Man, we livin straight, health plans and real estates
Weapons we put away, we reachin out with Nappy Day

[R. Prophet]
Sparklers light up the dark, fireworks in the park

[Scales]
We eatin - shrimp a la carte, red wine, holly tart
Like soldiers comin home, watchin after war's gone
Sky's rainin confetti, singin out the Nappy meddlies
Get rid of felonies, wash away with melodies
Irish to Ebonies, Haitians to the Lebonese

[Skinny Deville]
As I jot down in my notepad some days considered important to me
The birth of my son, the day I signed my first recordin agreement
It was sorta like my soul to the devil and I was kinda like allowin him to keep it
But the true essence of this art form can't be confined to temptation and evil
Lost some folks on the grind to this bullshit but my real yeagas stuck around
So this day's a tribute a celebration, I am because we all stay down
Shit, I'mma keep it Nappy 365 and 7 days a week
We fortunate to make it out that trap cause the forest roots stay runnin deep
Yup

[Hook]

[Outro - Scales] (Skinny Deville)
Today I'm feelin so alive, alive...
We ride, ride... (September 16th)
Today I'm feelin so alive, alive...
We ride, ride... (September 16th)
Today I'm feelin so alive, alive...[Verse 1: Nappy Roots]
Rozay, rozay, wide tops, rozay
Cîroc, bud light, wide tops then hoes say
'60's, bang it, I don't shoot, I slang it
'30's, pop it, no thanks, just hanging
Shrooms keep me up, shrooms keep me up
My blunt's catching on fire, damn it, I see red trucks
My eyes may be rolling but that don't mean I'm holy
I'm just outside my body and that's some shit I ain't controlling
Damn, I think I'm hit, man down, mayday
Damn, I'm drunk as hell, I could tell it must be payday
Bootleg, Billy Four, '93 octane
Smoking on that green crack, sipping liquid cocaine
Boom, that's a atomic, tomorrow I'm gonna vomit
Tonight I'm gonna talk shit then hit the streets and run it
My date look astonishing, all she pay is homage
Told her love me now cause when I come down I plummet

[Verse 2: Nappy Roots]
We mobbing, wopping, San Diego, we charging
90 all the way to Boston, fuck the laws, we dodging
Steve Austin, six milli', dead presidential, hood presidential
Hotter than fresh chili, we country, not hillbilly
Oh really, oh mighty, Lord have mercy, make this worth it
16 bars of flawless verses, ride the wave, don't fight it
Roll it up then light it, mean mug but I'm excited
Keep a bad bitch that go both ways, you know her partner's invited
Vacation, vacation, two bad broads in one location
One in the cut, one on deck, I keep 'em in rotation
Ovation, outstanding, high as a plane, I'm landing
These haters want to see us crash and burn
These motherfuckers can't stand me
In Vegas, Miami, Kentucky raised, I'm fucking paid
I bust a grape just like your head, spontaneous, no planning
Call the law, I dare you, we hit the bitch, you murder
Live ain't fair but don't blame us, it sucks, nobody ain't tell you

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
I'm so high I could skydive off the moon
Mister Benton here to fuck up your afternoon
I got a bag of shrooms and a ho to suck me like a vacuum
I'm so off I should rap inside a padded room
Fuck you and your faggot goons
Badabing, badaboom, pick the fucking scabs off the wound
I told that bitch I'm bringing hip hop back
That shit ain't dead, I just took the bitch out the tomb
Yeah nigga me and Lara Croft, on the Ukraine dope, call it Gorbachev
Any minute, bitch, we gonna orbit off
And if the pussy smell bad then my dick go soft
Word to my niggas Skinny and Scales
We put his body in the ocean where amphibians dwell
The grim reaper of rap, I'mma send him to hell
And you the type of nigga that'll stick his dick in a male
I am too cool for these lame niggas
Hangar 1 all day, never change liquor
Get dough, tryna stack my bread up
To the point that me and the 1 percent make the same figures
Adios when I'm out the bitch coochie
Fucking alcoholic like I'm Danny Bonaduce
Whoop a niggas ass like ?
Snuggle up with a nigga in the mall like Gucci
I put a hole in your kufi
Word to Minister Farrakhan and Bruce Lee
I write pain on the loose leaf
I'm the shit bitch, you ain't get the news brief
808 put my nigga named Blake
I talk to myself cause these niggas all fake
Reptilian, I bet these niggas all snakes
We gonna get cake
Fuck it, let these niggas all hateScratches "No static, got an automatic"

(Scales)
Too much of anything makes you an addict
Take a nigga back down Tobacco Road
I give my old soul what it's asking for
I'm trying to find where them angels sing at
Where X and King at
So listen for the knowledge I bring back
Cuz cigarette pack and a deuce bottle
Blue collar, ain't too much we can do, Father
Taketh me, I live life so anxiously
Tell me this is bout more than sex and buying weed
Maybe, but anyway we, burn daily
Sip Bailey's, early sex, unwanted babies
Scream push till I push daisies, Pops raised me
Through this blind crippled and crazy world
I'm just riding along, see where it takes me
Keep buying cars and rims until it breaks me
I fold like bread on a loose sandwich, too damaged
Still I gotta slow down and find a balance

Chorus:
No static, got an automatic
Too much of anything makes you an addict

(Skinny Deville)
We spend a lot of long nights trying to make it hot like an open flame
Smoking Jane posted on this porch I got this close to fame
Without the Leroy, but we live forever Wooden Leather
Slum is in my Village like them niggas up in Detroit (what up though)
And I'm going for the gusto, every day is cutthroat
But I don't give a fuck yo
Gutter bread, slice it different ways I got some shit to say
Split the Swisher, pack the hay, roll it up and hit the bitch
Addicted to this country living, givin' it my all dog
Raw till a fall y'all from here to California
Went back again, traffickin' like Raj' "What's Happenin?"
I'm traveling, looking for that Kill like I'm Bill ill
In my own right left without my soul tight
Roll through a cold night, swervin' on a country road
Six pack of Michelobs, a Ol' with some funky Dro
Too much of anything can make a playa lose control

Chorus:
No static, got an automatic
Too much of anything makes you an addict

(Scales)
See I love my reefer, love my Guinness
And I don't fit into society, I'm a menace
Slap my balls on your rack like tennis
And turn the Henny up and don't stop till I'm finished
I'm pissy drunk, one shot might get me crunk
Not to mention shorty rollin' up 50 blunts
We got Nappy in this bitch
Sticks to the bricks
I'm a cowboy, dog
It's to the fence

(Skinny)
We rollin 90 in the slow lane, with just enough to traffic
Cross the line bout forty times a week on the average
Forward and backwards, pack is like a sack lunch
Ridin' dirty, high as fuck, puffin on a fat blunt
What yo ass want, Nappy serve it all day
Always keep a Caddy Hog and dog it's all wood
Too much of anything can make you think it's all good
Got a automatic Skinny Deville and we all should

Chorus:
No static, got an automatic
Too much of anything makes you an addictAwwww....
Mmmmm, awww..

[Hook]
All my life been po'
But it really don't matter no mo'
And they wonder why we act this way
Nappy Boys gon' be okay
All my life been po'
But it really don't matter no mo'
And they wonder why we act this way
Nappy Roots gon' be okay, okay

[Big V]
We came in the game, plain ya see
Average man when the rest was ashamed to be
Nappy head and all, ain't no changin me
Ooooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh...
So rough it was, downright wrong I tell ya
Nobody never gave us nothin but tough time and made us somethin
Different stretch of road, new somethin to see
Every state on the map, a different somethin to eat
Daps and handshakes, it meant nuttin for real
Everybody makin a killin man, showin no feelins
Walkin off collectin pay, it's the way of the world
Can't change it, so I guess I'm gon' pray for the world
Sometimes I ask myself, was I made for the world?
I scream this to you, and I say it to the world
Nappy then, Nappy now - Nappy for a bit
Knee-deep, head over heels in this country shit!

[Hook]

[Skinny DeVille]
Even though I picture better days
I'm thankful for the chance I got to say amen
The Lord done blessed me with his grace, I wish this day would never end
We represent the slums, where we from, we feel they bump
Polish shot off on these presidents, and hardtimes they go and come
Some take up off, without the chance, to make it at all
Who woulda thought Skinny'd be the one that's, makin this call
Lord, help me out, tell me where I went wrong
I'm tryna find a righteous path, although it's, never been long
I gotta do it for my sons, they tellin me, "Daddy be strong"
We gon' make it through these hardtimes
Even though they go and they come
Ya absolutely right, for somethin happen to me on last Tuesday night
It's plain as day, man they... with this World Trade
Naw brave any order but confoldure
Better make it home when nothin seems to matter
That's when, see, everything can go - any which way
They got me fooled, see the Henny with the J
Front po'ch, chillin broke, country folk, I'm Nappy with my ways yo

[Hook]

[R. Prophit]
It's a blessin we woke up this mornin
All my colored folk stressin, come let's join hands
Got to cope with the pressures of bein po' man
Poppa taught me an order, survive for no man
Nappy blossomed from the Roots, course we gon' stand
Prophit grew from a juvenile to a grown man
Ya gotta take responsibility for ya own man
Zonin, two blunts a mo'nin, by sunrise sometimes
I love to hear my woman moanin, it's on again
Damn I hope you play this song again
The soul cleansin, the melody just rev my engine
Not a lot of things but usually just appendin, but lately
Been searchin for Benjamins, saw my folks locked in the tenaments
And it don't make no sense (what) children and sentencin
Broadcastin from the slums, that's why I'm writin these sentences
Just lower my income, (what) though we ain't finish it

[Hook][Skinny DeVille]
Classic 2000 and forever...

[Hook-Skinny DeVille]
At first you don't succeed, try it all again
I'd die 'fore I quit, so indeed I'mma win
'Til the fat lady sing the last note in the hymn
Don't worry 'bout me, I"ma grind 'til then
(repeat)

[Skinny DeVille]
They say fame is like cheers, where everybody knows your name
Success at any level has a feel I can't explain
You win some, you lose, it's on how you play the game
But you gotta know the rules and these dues are insane
If you make it to the top, congrats, good for you
You don't have to sell drugs, you can do it through school
You can make it by your damn self, it's better with yo' crew
But choose your team wisely, don't pick a bunch of fools
You gotta motivate, through ya hate infested lakes
Maneuver through the snakes and the sharks, white and great
They was with you from the start, is always what they say
Watchin' every step along the way that you take
Nobody's perfect, see we all gon' make mistakes
Ya live and ya learn, fast life, pump the brakes
Last night's not today, and right now's not tomorrow
Livin' for the moment, then you're time's already borrowed

[Hook]
At first you don't succeed, try it all again
I'd die 'fore I quit, so indeed I'mma win
'Til the fat lady sing the last note in the hymn
Don't worry 'bout me, I"ma grind 'til then
(repeat)

[Fishscale]
Yo, uh, my story
Fishscale bumpin, murderville jumpin
Must be a wrap cause I'm ballin' up somethin'
Packin' up my bags in the old Chevrolet
And if they ask where I'm goin' tell em
Bringin' it back to the A
State trooper got me, beat me like Rodney
Left the big city, turned a Saint like Shockey
Didn't have much but what the good Lord could spot me
Ask me where I'm goin, say
I'm bringin' it back to the A
Music stop sellin', friends start bailin'
I'm failin' everything, not to mention I'm a felon
My cousin doin' time and I don't know what I should tell him
'sides "Keep ya head up, cuz"
I'm bringin' it back to the A
Small town country boy, big city dreamer
Double-wide trailer, pickup truck and a Beamer
Tunnel vision driver, honk your horn if you see us
If you wonder where I'm goin bruh
I'm bringin' it back to the A!

[Hook]
At first you don't succeed, try it all again
I'd die 'fore I quit, so indeed I'mma win
'Til the fat lady sing the last note in the hymn
Don't worry 'bout me, I"ma grind 'til then
(repeat)(Intro, Fish Scales)
Yeah, sometimes you just gotta ride

(Verse 1, Fish Scales)
I'm headed to Savannah, the sun rise there
And somethin tellin me that I should be somewhere near
I met somebody daughter, played in her water
The lake was too salty and I'm not Kyle Korver
I was goin hard in the paint where the stars hang out
Just to find out that what they buy ain't bought
And then I found me startin to go the same route
I do this for the love, you can throw the fame out
A chair still a chair, even when it change house
And I am hip-hop, even when I claim south
What'chu think we all look the same, game is bad
Cause now we all fightin for the same damn spot
Go'on, do da "Stanky Leg"
It's better than talkin bout shootin people in the head
I'm headed out to Oakland, the sun lies there
And somethin tellin me that I should be somewhere near
Where we goin?

(Hook)
We got five on gas, gettin nowhere fast
Deep down in the sticks of Georgia (Where do you go)
Big trucks roll through, might blow they horns
They glad cause they goin to Florida (Where do you go)
My neighbors overseas, and they fightin like hell
I can smell it from across the water (From across the water)
(I waaalk, and where the world do you go)

(Verse 2, Skinny DeVille)
Ha
Just like you thought it wasn't gon bop
Yup, it's how I know it wasn't gon flop
Sometimes you got to give it all you got
Even though a few folk keep wishin that you stop
But after that, another classic we gon' drop
And I ain't talkin bout no fancy mansion or no yacht
Just a quarter pound of pot on my fourty acre lot
Wit my Caddy coupe and drop, and a Range Rover SPOT
I mean SPORT, sometimes I lose my train of thought
But I'm back again and promise that every track is hot
We gon' hit some traffic headed to the top
So we gon' take another route and simply creep right past the cops
And the haters man, they comin for my spot
But we don't have to talk, come on get it while it's hot
Fresh out the skillet, never feel it or you're not
We gon' verti-cal grille it, watch me sell it on the block

(Hook)
We got five on gas, gettin nowhere fast
Deep down in the sticks of Georgia (Where do you go)
Big trucks roll through, might blow they horns
They glad cause they goin to Florida (Where do you go)
My neighbors overseas, and they fightin like hell
I can smell it from across the water (From across the water)
(I waaalk, and where the world do you go)

(Verse 3, Fish Scales)
The sun don't move, the earth don't stop
The stars do drop, and they house forclose
Cars repoed, business get towed
Probably be a friend and sell the story out the bowl
Then they can't see theyself back in the hood
Can't let they friends know they not doin good
See you lay low, and focus on ya kids
Hope someobody remember somethin that'cha did

(Skinny DeVille)
Yah
And if they did, then you gon' trip
Grind for seven days a week, and then you watch it flip
Legit and squeaky clean, that's how it seems at the tip
Gotta dig a little deep, you wanna see about the grit
The grass gets mighty green by the fence
Which side is the question? I'm headed that direction
Knowledge is the weapon, and I use it for protection
If you think I'm really slippin, then run up and learn ya lesson

(Hook)
We got five on gas, gettin nowhere fast
Deep down in the sticks of Georgia (Where do you go)
Big trucks roll through, might blow they horns
They glad cause they goin to Florida (Where do you go)
My neighbors overseas, and they fightin like hell
I can smell it from across the water (From across the water)
(I waaalk, and where the world do you go)
