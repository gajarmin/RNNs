[Hook: John Cena]
Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now!

[Verse 1: John Cena]
In case you forgot or fell off I'm still hot, knock your shell off
My money stack fat plus I can't turn the swell off
The franchise, doing big business, I live this
It's automatic I win this oh you hear those horns, you finished
A soldier, and I stay under you fighting
Plus I'm storming on you chumps like I'm thunder and lightning
Ain't no way you breaking me kid, I'm harder than nails
Plus I keep it on lock, like I'm part of the jail
I'm slaughtering stale, competition, I got the whole block wishing
They could run with my division but they gone fishing
With no bait, kid your boy hold weight
I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate
In any weather I'm never better your boy's so hot
You'll never catch me in the next man's sweater
If they hate, let 'em hate, I drop ya whole clan
Lay yo' ass down for the three second tan

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trademarc]
It's gonna be what it's gon' be
Five pounds of courage buddy, bass tint pants with a gold T
Uh it's a war dance and victory step
A raw stance is a gift, when you insist it's my rep
John Cena, Trademarc, y'all are so-so and talk about
The bread you make but don't know the recipe for dough though
Aimin guns in all your photos, that's a no-no
When this pop, you'll lip lock, your big talk's a blatant no-show
See what happens when the ice age melt
You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps
I rock a timepiece by Benny if any
The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all condemn me
A man's measured by the way that he thinks
Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks
I spent 20 plus years seeking knowledge of self
So for now Marc Predka's living live for wealth

[Hook]I wanted to apologize to anybody that I might have let down last night.

This is… this is kind of hard to understand, but sometimes you can try so hard at something.

Sometimes you can be so prepared, and still fail. And every time you fail, it’s painful, it causes sadness, and especially as I saw last night, it causes disappointment.
I’ve often said a man’s character is not judged after he celebrates a victory, but by what he does when his back is against the wall. So no matter how great the setback, how severe the failure, you never give up.

You never give up, you pick yourself up, you brush yourself off, you get up and move on and overcome and that is what I believe!

So… there are those who were so offended by my actions last night that they might have lost faith in me.

I absolutely respect your decision to do so. But I’m not talking to them… I’m talking to those people who still believe!

Tonight, I speak to those who still proudly stand in my corner! You have not given up on me, and I will NOT give up on you![Intro: John Cena]
Uh, Wiz, I'mma help you re-educate the masses right now
(You know where I'm from x3)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Growin' up in that slum
Tatted all on my chest just to let y'all know where I'm from
Haters, I don't see none
Goin' hard everyday, Lord knows I want the best for my son
So I got Chuck Tays on my feet, and I got bitches smokin' my chief
And I got all my dogs with me, anyone starvin', man they gon' eat
And we don't do deceit
We do real big receipts
We do first class cabin seats
If you ain't gonna stand for nothin', have a seat

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Cause I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way
I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way
I don't know much about y'all but I've been hustlin' all day
I don't know much about y'all but I've been countin' all day

[Verse 2: John Cena]
Y'all 'bout to find God, make you an instant preacher
They should have never let Cena spit with Wiz Khalifa
We all day fam, hotter than a sauna
I'm not from Chi city but I'm common on the corner
We always hustle hard, you ballin' incidental
I'm 'bout to go on trial, murderin' instrumentals
I dumb it down for you, I keep it simple, son
I need four fingers, I'm givin' you the middle one

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I tried to tell these boys I ain't lyin'
Put it in their faces so they can get their cake like mine
But man they keep hatin' and I can't see the reason why
Why when I get a plate they keep tryna take it
Put 'em in their places

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa][Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They try to make me slow down, but I live with the brakes off
They tell me I should hold up, but I live with the brakes off
Brakes off, brakes off, brakes off
And we're going up, up, up, up
Brakes off, brakes off

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
First place in the race
Either first or you're last, my foot stays on the gas
Floatin', ain't take much from out the class
Open the Forbes see a young nigga 'bout his
Hear people talking 'bout their dreams, he really living out his
They hating just to hate, but they don't really doubt it
My eyes stay on the prize
Told EI realised that love built this
So I'll be damned if you be fake, kill it
Put my all in, make 'em feel it
Show me them people who think it's bosses
I'll make them look like children
Top floor of the building, ordering drinks, rolling up
Planes all in the same, goes without saying
Y'all know the slang, no pain, no gain, let's get it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: John Cena]
I'm making ground mine, you taking downtime
Every word is "hustle", the whole entire sound shine
Chasing the finer things, shining like diamond rings
Gemstone flow, that's the clarity my rhyming brings
King with the cold voice, I'm such a rogue choice
Tailored suit, pulling up in that Rolls Royce
Drop-head coupe, suicide doors
Arriving like Sinatra, Louis Vuitton floors
I'm talking 'bout my shoes, I'm chalking up your crews
I'mma give away the end, partner y'all about to lose
That's just the way it goes, don't take it to heart B
I say you're just a friend cause my biz is the marquee

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
They try to make me slow down, brakes off, brakes
They tell me I should hold up, brakes off, brakes off
They try to make me slow down, brakes off, brakes off
They tell me I should hold up, brakes off
But I live with the brakes off

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]Finally The Rock came back and everyone was getting with it
'Til he said I was talking trash, but he would never be specific
It's because I wasn't talking trash Rock, I was talking truth
You left us hanging high and dry to play a fairy with a tooth?
And then you walk into this ring and tell these people that I'm lame man?
He wore lipstick in Get Shorty and rocked a skirt for The game plan
This 'Fruitty Pebble' that you're dealing with;
I'm not your average jabroni
I'm like a big purple pinwheel Rock, so go ahead and blow me
And you're electrifying, yes, but hang with me that's just absurd
See now you got to tell your family you just got schooled by Barney's turd
Wait wait wait wait
That's your material
You can have your joke back
Just don't go racing to Witch Mountain Rock
Because your mountain is Brokeback
The Rock's new movie?
Well it's nothing like Walking Tall
He spends the movie in a bowling alley polishing my balls
The "People's Champ"? He's never with the people
Rock, your words are see-trough
You imitate me every time you leave; for 7 years we couldn't see you
And is it Rock or is it Dwayne?
Pick a side, come on son
If I was you, I'd stick with Rock because Dwayne ain't got a johnson
And you'll see me at WrestleMania?
Well then I'll make sure not to miss it
But you ain't going to whip my candy ass dude I'll make sure you kiss it
You're the WrestleMania host Rock, that's your role, know it
You tell these people that you love them
I'm here every week to show it
That's called a first round knock out
And now you know that I'm not playing
Run your mouth all you want dude
It doesn't matter what you're saying"So... you think you're untouchable?"

[Hook: John Cena]

[Verse One: John Cena]
Whether fightin, or spittin, my discipline is unforgiven
Got you backin up, in a defensive position
An ass-kickin anthem, heavyweight or bantam
Holdin camps for ransom, the microphone phantom
Teams hit the floor, this the new fight joint
Like a broken needle kid, you missin the point!
We dominate your conference with offense that's no nonsense
My theme song hits, get your reinforcements!
We strike quick with hard kicks, duckin night sticks
Bare-knuckle men through fight pits, beat you lifeless
Never survive this! Get forget like Alzheimer's
Two-face rappers, walk away with four shiners
The raw rhymer, turnin legends to old-timers
My incisor's like a viper, bitin through your one-liners!
New Deadman Inc. - and we about to make you famous
Takin over Earth and still kickin' in Uranus!

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Trademarc]
You ain't advanced enough to process potential phonetical concepts
The objects are foreign, like Loch Ness
Sponsored sex, a complex, regardless of your finesse
Or your fitness, it's the condition of business
Your lame vision of a underground, physical image
You're underneath to undermine your whole, typical image
With the precision of percentages, and the collision of sedatives
Poetry, beats, and mics - we untouchable
Like righteous sluts with no crevices
Streets unite, we rock right over dumber beats
Yo' cats couldn't come this hot if they {jerked off} in the summer heat
Forget two takes, kill y'all birds the first time
Yo' best {shit} ain't, worthy of my filler or worst rhymes
I'm better than nice, check the veteran stripes
Leave you beside yourself with fear, I kill you, and bury you twice
Despite the cover of night, trackin your flight
Like guerilla warfare, where the grass is dense
Approachin me is a quick way to get referred to in the past tense
Dead that! When the light to mic is on
The crowd is dead like the intermission when you on the Titantron

[Hook]What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do, what would you do?

(Verse 1: Tha Trademarc)
Uh, this is how it go down
I have the black-pound-silence so it don't make sound
I pile a 150 outta town, ain't nobody around
Im in the back seat breakin it down
My love has been a bad streak dawg lately I found
Our press made us turn the radio down
But God bless now they talkin bout layin me down
Now they on about shovels in the weight of the ground
What now?
Preachin on the way that they handle thing
Watin patiently to do the 6-foot Sand Thing
Now, so I take a second look at my life
I made too many mistakes that I just couldn't make right
Should've been more focused than I take things light
When I'm gone this is what y'all will say I was like
An arrogant fool, no not that baddest or cool
Just a big fish caught up in the shallowish pool
Not a big name playa, in fact its true
Never would have been shit without the kats he knew
He got lucky rode the coattails of everyones fame
In two weeks ain't nobody gon' rememba his name
Fuck It
I'm ready to go, I done made records
Made monetary off of the flow
More importantly though, I proved everyone wrong
Its all over regardless what you say when I'm gone
What now?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do, what would you do?

(Verse 2: John Cena)
I want y'all to feel the wound, its the truth in my words
I been quiet for too long, the truth should be heard
It was a while back, 10:20 in the morn'
Kat should up on my lawn in the rug-ed uniform
Unexpected, theres a knock on my door
I met this fool in the club, I don' see him before
Open to great him, but the second he sees me
His eyes buckle, his voice is uneasy
But it's cool, I didn't even catch it at first
I check his shoulder, homie's rockin a purse
Now I know something's tricky, but I'm already sittin down
Homie pipes up, you should hear what he's spittin out
Says I've been sleepin wit his wifey
And he ain't the type of kat to take that shit lightly
I made a move and he told me homie wait
Reached in his purse pulled a chrome 38
He asked me if I'm ready to die
Said he was gonna blow my brains all over the sky
Said he was leavin the country, and he was straight with the passports
Cocked the hammer, I'm thinkin my last thoughts
I'm in a bad way, nothin could save this
I close my eyes hopin it's painless
Just waitin for the sound, ready to swallow too
But homie havin trouble with his follow through
By a miracle, I avoid the chalk ground
Homie's confused, he just wanna be talked down
His wife is sleepin through town and he knew it
Picked me outta the crowd but couldn't do it
He Squashed it, and as he's walkin away
I realize life is short so I'm markin the day
Now it's full speed ahead, I'll rest when I'm dead
And I could give a Fuck what the next man said
I live how I wanna live
Buy what I wanna buy
Do what I wanna do
Try What I wanna try
Fear nothin, take chances
Not afraid to fail, always makin advances
So when I ride on the Grim Reaper Highway
No regrets bitch, I did it my way
Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow

What would you do, what would you do?[Intro: John Cena]
Uh, Wiz, I'mma help you re-educate the masses right now

Why when I get a plate they keep tryna take it
Put 'em in their places

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa][John Cena]
Aww, you done did it now
Chaos you shoulda put this one in the vault man!
They not ready - they don't know what's comin man!
Oh we gonna drop this on 'em right here
Y'all ain't ready for this, Y'ALL AIN'T READY FOR NONE OF THIS!

Your boy's a bad man, and we invadin the streets
Make unclever rappers scurred, they be droppin the heat
Shocked the world, now I'm standin alone
I flip fools like them clamshell cellular phones
You can't help but nod your head to the track
Fuck the watered down rap, we be takin it back
Give it to me straight - ain't no chasin it
Check yourself in the mirror - ain't no facin it
Cause you, playin the role and you plannin to fold
This the masterplan, we got the planet on hold
We all over the streets like your favorite sneaker
Breakin up your sound like a drive-through speaker
Everything that I be spittin is strong
After I rock, fast forward through the rest of the song
We the monkeywrench, that's gonna ruin your plan
And don't fuck with John Cena - I'm a BAD, BAD MAN

[Hook 2X: Bumpy Knuckles]
With the mic in my hands I'm a bad man
Even in a fight with the hands I'm a bad man
Livin in the streets all my life I'm a bad man
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

[Tha Trademarc]
We devils - rockin ambient levels
We set loose among hot tunes to instrumentals
And cats got one-liners, I drop several
And I think it's funny you choose, losin progress
Or runnin in place; we makin moves, and y'all settle
I rip rappers and take responsibility
For makin future hall-of-famers look third rate
Y'all are lost for words like conversation on your worst first date
And ride beats, creep through side streets
Looseleaf notepads that's where rhymes leak
Punchlines - man, don't even beg
I got knee-slappin tracks, y'all brusin your leg
You a rhyme writer - funny man, that's a joke
You ain't worthy of bein my secretary man that's a quote
I flood tracks like cracks in boats
And pussy rappers choked up with they own lines in they throat

[Hook]

[Bumpy Knuckles a.k.a. Freddie Foxxx]
TURN UP THE MICROPHONE and feed me I'm a beast
MC's and they beats is what I eat, 16 I'll leave you in the street
My rhymes are sicker than gangrene in both feet
It's spreadin up the leg, and headed for the head
Your rhymes are whack your style is proof that the brain corrosion
Is fuckin with your chosen flows, I'm nice with mics
My hands'll break your nose like Mikey Tyson
Fightin in his prime, one rhyme
And I shake up the room one time, BOOM! To the jaw
Your face is a coat type raw
And the blood and snot they mix, jelly on the floor
My love is coppin bricks, belly on the floor
I'll rob you, you soft and you really ain't a problem
I'll solve you, 357 long nose revolve you
Acid in your face, bad look, dissolve you
I'm a bad, bad man

Yeah, check it out
It's Bumpy Knuckles baby
And I want you to say hello to the BAD, BAD, MAN - C'MON!

Chi-Town, L.A., they all doin their thing
We got a lil' somethin bubblin in Beanpot over here y'know?
I got my crew right back gon' show you how it's done
Straight up, hittin one-two like Manny Ortiz ya heard?

[Verse 1: John Cena]
It's John Cena baby, and we heatin up the Beanpot
Big up Boston, you know the whole team hot
Yo we fresh, y'all a little bit stale
And we 'bout to make it ugly just like Kevin McHale
Cena taking over - I'm 'bout to make the scene mine
I got a tea party, baby meet me on the Green Line
Ain't too many kids that flow better than me
Roll thick like Yaz's sideburns in seventy-three
Like Tom Brady and the Pats, we rollin kids
Cross me and pay a toll like the Tobin Bridge
From the home of the curse, y'all know what I mean
We like the left field wall, we stackin Monster Green
Knock you out of the park, you land on Yawkey Way
My shit be butter, but around here we say Parkay/parquet
I rent my own team, we takin over the industry
Like the big dick, baby nobody can finish me

[Hook x4: scratched]
"Big up Boston!" "No one shows pity"

6-1-7, 9-7-8, 7-8-1, 5-0-8, and 4-1-3

[Verse 2: Trademarc]
And I don't mean to brag, but it's in the bag
And we alone on top like we goin stag
It's a dynasty, that's how I see things
In four years we countin three rings
I'm the MVP, baby gimme that key ring
And me, Brady and Branch'll own our sweet thing
Yeah, and we ain't gon' stop
We at the Eagle flap, cook 'em all as they flop
And T.O. takin on the B roll and that's the past
Beatin everybody and the salary cap
What now? You say titan's your rep
That's like Peyton winning big games out on Gillette
We don't forget y'all, we're keepin it grimy
Had the Steel Curtain lookin like venetian blinds
Yeah baby, that's how it go
That's why next year it's lookin like 3 in a row

[Hook x4]

[Esoteric]
Yeah, uhh
It's Esoteric, tuning in
Putting it down, for Boston, Mass

[Verse 3]
Yo, I rep the Bean, y'all see the way it be
Home of Source magazine, the Pats, and Edo. G
Steadily poetically I'm Bill Russell in command
Peace to Dorcester, Roxbury, Mattapan
Pack a man down quick like neanderthals
Standing tall after brawling up in Fanueil Hall
As a young buck moms said I disobey
All she heard was no-ma/Nomar like fans in Fenway
But they sent him to the dugs, I'm like Manny when he shrugs
And {?} bug to the {?} women wearin {?} in the club
A deadly combination like venom hit your blood
Jason Varitek with the glove, it's all love
I'm like Schilling with the red sock, when I get hot
My aim is dangerous, like the Larry Bird set shot
It's clear now, you living in fear now
Big up Boston, the champ is here now

[Hook][Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They try to make me slow down, but I live with the brakes off

Prepare for the worst we commin thunderin
Opposition wonderin how they get the drop on us
We set up and lock corners try to put a stop on us
We react so quick the 5o couldn't even call the cops on us
Steady put the rocks on us but my chain stay still
Still my name stay real spit the flame they feel
I know the game take skill that why the brains stay ill
We bout to change the deal keep the champagne chilled
We sippin clique(?) With a molly rose
Y'all belly meatin beef and nothing but bologna foes
Your phony flows we stopping your rise
We own the game y'all is leasing with the option to buy
Your flight been delayed kid you not gonna fly
We got the army throw your hands to the sky
This is chain gang bitch don't bother to check us
Y'all don't got to like us but you gon respect us motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tha Trademarc]
Listen baby im just tryin to eat
Just the same game that put the chain gang in the street
Got goons with a few hundred clips in the heat
It seems sex violence and money are dyin to meet
God damn I'm a fan this music moved me
I found writing rhymes all the time would soothe me
Don't lose me never let the truth allude me
The skills I respect are expected duelly
Some got gifts man but reflect it crudely
That why I keep it real like rejected movies
What now and no what was or would be
Only sing along if you understood me
The scene hip hop dawg ain't were it could be
Trademarc will take y'all right where it should be
You actors and that's where it stops
We stars on stage y'all are decorative props what now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: tha Trademarc]
Look man my voice christenin beats
Your vision see ripples on concrete from glistenin heat
Whenever I speak I walk streets
Calm when I creep
Trademarc John Cena Freddie Foxx and rup corrupt mob
The chain gang spittin the same slang
Let the iron go bang bang and came lame
Church bells ring ring to all y'all coppin the lock let it hang hang

[Verse 4: John Cena]
Yall think we lucky that ain't nothin new to me
Cause luck is preparation lockin heads with opportunity
So far I just had to listen and learn
Play my position and earn with the vision and burn
Now the shit is all turned and im reppin for pride
Where im from you either step up or step aside
Want some get some stop drop and peril
Chain gang run this bitch lock stock and barrel

[Hook]

We fight together we ride together right now we gonna get loud together

Now now fillin' 'em to live
Scream get uup to live[Verse 1: John Cena]
We keep it hoppin like the cars with the shocks
We spittin heat on your block
We new to the game, but runnin the spot
Numbin your knot, with basslines that'll make ya neck break
This rook'll take your queen and put ya king in checkmate
Open your mind without makin ya meditate
We real champs; y'all just featherweight
Time to get it straight, I push your wig back
Crew loaded up with extra bread like a Big Mac
Beefin with us? We're leavin you face down
Stompin bitch rappers like I'm straight outta A-Town
Runnin the playground like it was a track meet
Shoes on the whip that be bigger than Shaq's feet
We into big things, bank account's overgrown
All types of cheese - swiss, cheddar, provolone
Guaranteed to burn wax like candles
Track hittin hard to the head like shots of Jack Daniels

[Hook 2X: John Cena]
Y'all, bitch, crews, don't wanna fuck with us
Y'all bound, to, lose, another one bites the dust

[Verse 2: Tha Trademarc]
It's Trademarc the truth, laid back, aloof
I'm God, as if you needed some proof
You ain't hard I can see it on you, I need a roof
Fuck a droptop, crop if I'm creepin on you
Click-clack nickelback knickknacks if you got heaters on you
Spittin back live rounders, with five pounders
If we meetin on two, I put a beatin on you
Your sound's tired buddy, that's why I'm sleepin on you
We lean back in the ride, with cream stackin the rawhide
The sound of God slide with a raw vibe
Straight military camel clothes ash brown boots
So sick, I've been handlin flows, since enamel was gold tooth
And branded by low
You cold fuck like eskimo hoes at 7 below
You slow, you be the last to think
My hands seen more fuckin dirt than bathroom sinks

[Hook]

[Verse 3: John Cena]
I got punks, dumps and switches, dump chumpses bitches
We feed you to the sharks, you can sleep with the fishes
Clean you like dishes but I ain't no busboy
You ain't family, you ain't earnin my trust boy
Seen too many bitches that'll double cross ya
We bring more drama than the Laker roster
Get the click pissed, ain't nobody can save ya
Throw heat without lookin like Fernando Valenzuela

[Verse 4: Tha Trademarc]
Marc Predka's the name, the rest of you lame
I'm ego drivin, seen with different women, every size and frame
I refine my game by fuckin famous bitches
But it's all the same, it's just ex to the next
For sex or brain, misses or Mrs
Married or not, my game don't stop
It's cars bars bonds and stocks you ain't see my flow
Y'all are small-time suckers like a knee-high ho

[Hook]Finally The Rock came back and everyone was getting with it
'Til he said I was talking trash, but he would never be specific
It's because I wasn't talking trash Rock, I was talking truth
You left us hanging high and dry to play a fairy with a tooth?
And then you walk into this ring and tell these people that I'm lame man?
He wore lipstick in Get Shorty and rocked a skirt for The game plan
This 'Fruitty Pebble' that you're dealing with;
I'm not your average jabroni
I'm like a big purple pinwheel Rock, so go ahead and blow me
And you're electrifying, yes, but hang with me that's just absurd
See now you got to tell your family you just got schooled by Barney's turd
Wait wait wait wait
That's your material
You can have your joke back
Just don't go racing to Witch Mountain Rock
Because your mountain is Brokeback
The Rock's new movie?
Well it's nothing like Walking Tall
He spends the movie in a bowling alley polishing my balls
The "People's Champ"? He's never with the people
Rock, your words are see-trough
You imitate me every time you leave; for 7 years we couldn't see you
And is it Rock or is it Dwayne?
Pick a side, come on son
If I was you, I'd stick with Rock because Dwayne ain't got a johnson
And you'll see me at WrestleMania?
Well then I'll make sure not to miss it
But you ain't going to whip my candy ass dude I'll make sure you kiss it
You're the WrestleMania host Rock, that's your role, know it
You tell these people that you love them
I'm here every week to show it
That's called a first round knock out
And now you know that I'm not playing
Run your mouth all you want dude
It doesn't matter what you're saying[Bumpy Knuckles a.k.a. Freddie Foxxx]
First and foremost...
Flow easy, yo
Yo, yo, for the hood (for the hood)
Everybody flow easy, ha ha, so easy
Yo, listen
For the Krupt Mob, John Cena, Trademarc, listen

I embarass MC's who touch the mic with me
That's why they never holla when it's showtime - get me?
I spit poison like a black snake bit me
Guns up in the E-Class, D's can't get me
My foot is a 13, 12's don't fit me
My heart is cold and hard like Jack Frost bit me
So many new flows old flows start to panic
It's time they got built by the mic mechanic
Y'all heard, I stay in hood streets like curbs
And never forget, where I come from, word
I ain't goin broke, fuck you, I'll cop me a brick
And take it straight to the block, forget rap quick
Don't trip, Bump got a speed zone sign
For suckers who move too fast against mine
I'm pressed, pushin it full speed ahead
You left, bullet in chest, meet the dead, so

[Hook]
Flow easy, turn up the mic it's time
To flow easy, whenever I spit my rhyme
I flow easy, the underground pound and grime
Flow easy, but yours don't sound like mine
I flow easy, turn up the mic it's time
I flow easy, whenever I spit my rhyme
I flow easy, the underground pound and grime
Flow easy, so yours don't sound like mine I flow easy

[Tha Trademarc]
Philosopher first, rapper second
Manifest the message, lessons involved
It all but hits you, aviate your crew and lift you
So what's the issue? Trademarc has got it locked before he meet you
Greet your mind before we even greet you
Won't mislead you, I ain't trustin people, cause I defeat you
Take it down a notch, slow your roll
Cause we crush spirits, like we stole your soul
I set styles off dog, y'all are fuckin mimics
Man I talk more shit than pro-lifers in abortion clinics
Run my mouth off like high school rumors
Man and grab microphones like pedophiles gropin late bloomers
Flow easy like your first day with white sneakers
You just a face in the crowd like packed bleachers
Huh, you better rock a sleeveless
Freddie Foxxx, Trademarc, John Cena breeze through
Y'all are fuckin divas

[Hook]

[John Cena]
First and foremost I sure post potential like Carmelo
Turn a hard MC to jello
Make their skin yellow with fear while stayin mellow and clear
Man, we in for one hell of a year, yeah
Curse a fool like the Red Sox, we tighter than headlocks
I'm flowin easy with Freddie Foxxx
Known to hang it low like dreadlocks and y'all are too slow
Like wearing a weight vest and lead socks
I'm a fat kid, you feed me? I'm still hungry
Never let a bitch take a bill from me
Like Jordan in the 4th quarter, I'm still money
Best believe the flow water, we still runny
Make your stomach feel funny, I'm so sick
With 16 bars twice the value of gold brick
Make it known quick that I'm greedy, we got the rats and the cheese B
So believe me

[Hook]Seth Rollins is in the ring along with Big Show and J&J Security as guests on Edge and Christian's "Cutting Edge Peep Show" segment.

Edge to Christian:  He's trying to do what we did but failing miserably. Because he doesn't have any charisma.

Seth Rollins: I don't need to be you, because I am better than you.

Edge: Alright, you know what? You couldn't be better than me even if you had a live sex celebration with the big goiter here.

Seth Rollins: Alright, alright. Let me just lay it down right here. John, I'll be honest with you. I didn't want to bring you out here tonight to propose a toast to 2015. No John, I wanted you to come out here tonight because I want...something...from you. So get out here, John. GET OUT HERE, JOHN. John, I didn't want it to come to this. But if you're not going to come out here, then you are forcing...my hand. And in turn, John, you leave me no choice but to force yours.

Seth Rollins turns around, MITB briefcase in hand, and slams Christian in the stomach with it. Edge is beside himself and shoves Rollins. Big Show, J&J Security, and Rollins step up and surround Edge.

After a long pause, Big Show grabs him by the neck and forces him down to the ground. Edge lies face first on Seth's MITB briefcase, and Seth puts his foot on Edge neck.

Seth Rollins: COME ON JOHN! I THOUGHT THIS WAS SOMEBODY YOU RESPECTED! GET OUT HERE JOHN! IF YOU'VE GOT ANY GUTS, IF YOU'RE HALF THE MAN THAT YOU SAY YOU ARE, YOU'LL GET OUT HERE AND SAVE ME FROM PARALYZING HIM! I'LL DO IT JOHN! COME ON! COME ON JOHN!

You don't think I've got the guts, do you John?

John Cena runs down the entrance ramp with no entrance music and is intent on entering the ring, but is stopped a few feet away by Rollins speaking again.

Seth Rollins: STOP RIGHT THERE! YOU STOP RIGHT THERE! NOT ANOTHER MOVE, JOHN!

You know what it is I want from you. If you don't give it to me, I will BREAK HIS NECK.

Cena begins taking off his hat and shirt, signifying he's about to run in anyways.

Seth Rollins: Don't do it, John....don't do it, John. Don't even take the chance, John. If you care about this man as much as you say you do, you're gonna stay right there, John!

Cena runs up to the ring apron and is about to enter when Rollins raises his foot.

Seth Rollins: HEY, HEY, HEY! Come on, John, take a step back. TAKE A STEP BACK, DAMNIT!

You forget, John, this is a husband here. This is a father, John. He's got a little kid at home, and if you want him to ever be able to play with that child, and hold it in his hands ever again, you're gonna give me what I want, John. You're gonna give me what I want John. I SWEAR TO GOD, I WILL SNAP HIS NECK, RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ALL THESE PEOPLE.

No no no no no. Hey if you don't believe me, John, test the waters. I mean you're mister hustle, loyalty, and respect right? You grant wishes, year after year-round. Well guess what? I bet poor Edge here, he is wishing you would come save him right now. I bet he is wishing, praying to whatever God he believes in that you would save him from what I'm about to do to him.....John, who are you today? WHO ARE YOU REALLY, JOHN? ARE YOU THE PHONEY THAT I'VE BEEN CALLING OUT FOR MONTHS? OR ARE YOU THE REAL DEAL, JOHN? John....bring The Authority back. Bring them back, John, or I swear, I will paralyze this man, and it will be on your conscience for the rest of your life. So whatever that is worth to you, that's your decision. Come on John. Test me I dare you. Test me, I dare you.

Cena begins walking forward again.

Seth Rollins: DON'T TAKE ANOTHER STEP! BRING THE AUTHORITY BACK OR I'LL BREAK HIS NECK, I SWEAR TO GOD JOHN. I SWEAR TO GOD! YOU'VE MADE MY LIFE HELL SINCE SURVIVOR SERIES. I WILL TAKE NO SHAME, I WILL FIND NO GUILT IN DOING THIS. I WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE FILLED WITH REGRET FOR THE REST OF IT. ANY KID THAT YOU EVER HAVE WILL NOT BE PROUD OF THEIR FATHER...and this man won't be able to hold his kid in his hands ever again.

John Cena: Stop....stop....okay. I....

Seth Rollins: What did you say? What did you just say? What did you just say? Hey hey hey Jamie, get a mic, get a mic, take a mic out to him. I want the whole world to hear this. I want the whole world to hear this.

Jamie from J&J Security gets out of the ring and holds a mic up to Cena.

Seth Rollins: Say it again, John. Say it again. SAY IT AGAIN, JOHN!

John Cena: .....I bring back the authority.

Seth Rollins: Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah, what did you just say? What did you just say, huh?

John Cena: I SAID I BRING BACK THE AUTHORITY!

Seth Rollins: YEAH! WOO! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! THE AUTHORITY IS BACK BABY. WOO! WOO! What a way to end the year ladies and gentleman. Thank you John, thank you....

But damn you gotta know me better than that, I'm gonna kill him anyways.

Rollins bounces off the ropes and goes for a curb stomp on Edge. Cena runs in and spears him, Edge rolls out of the ring and everyone in the ring beats down Cena. The beat down culminates in a Curb Stomp on John Cena. Rollins, Show, and J&J exit the ring and pose at the top of the entrance stage. The Authority's music hits, Brock Lesnar comes out with Paul Heyman, along with Stephanie McMahon and Triple H. They all celebrate to close the show.[Murs]
9th, it's the remix right?
So what we gon' do is
Further define the term "hustling" cause
These fools on the radio got people thinkin
You gotta sell dope or, be a killer or somethin but
You could be in traffic right now
On your way to school or, on your way from work
You could be, flippin burgers, doin corporate mergers
You still a motherfuckin hustler let's go

A lot of people castin shade on the classic that we made but
Say what you say we just ask to get paid
And I might get laid if the remix gets played
So throw this on the radio like 50 times a day
I got my dude from the Yay, and my boy from H-Town
Goin hard in the paint, with my man from Smackdown
And you gotta back down, cause the grind don't cease
While dudes likes {*edit*} is hard to find in the streets
I hustle like the homey Fo-Five, rest in peace
While you bark a lot about your Glock, never had to walk the walk
You ain't a gangster homeboy, just a dude who likes to talk a lot
That's why you got your chain snatched in a Roscoe's parking lot
In the M-I-D C-I-T-Y
One verse'll melt the ice on your favorite rap guy
No Jacob on my wrist, cause that's not what I'm about
But I will find time to knock your favorite rapper out
And I'm a

[Hook 2X: Murs]
H-U-S-T-L-E hustler
You'll never find a dime that ain't mine motherfucker
Goal not to be broken have to stroll like a sucker
So pay me what you owe me and don't play with me homey

[E-40]
Huh, check it out
E-40-Water ain't gon' give it to you late (late)
E-40-Water gon' give it to you straight, way before 1988 (8)
I used to quarterback weight (weight)
Did whatever it had to take to put out my first tape (tape)
Tryin to outsmart the boys in blue
Never knew how much I made (made)
I used to throw 'em off with my glasses and my hi-top fade (fade)
But I never pedalled woofy just that A-1 yo-yo mayne (mayne)
That's off my cocoa leaf (leaf)
Stapler in my du-duh-du-duhs, hubbles between my booty cheeks
The same old clothes for weeks (weeks) gritty and sabalosa
A turfed out motherfucker, in a Granada smoker roper (roper)
Sippin on King Cobra (Cobra) bankroll full of huns (huns)
Fluffin that Public Enemy, "Miuzi Weighs a Ton"
(Ton) Oooh, and it was off to the hood (hood)
Local boy from Vallejo, that player done made it GOOD! (good)
And I wish a sucker would, try to knock my hustle (hustle)
Fuck these motherfuckers I was brought up in the struggle!

[Hook]

[Chingo Bling]
Chingo Bling the boss, I could never get a layoff
America would shutdown if Mexicans took the day off
Freeways construction, keys, and nines bustin
Playboy we hustlin, end of discussion
One tamale, dos tamales, tres tamales, four
When Chingo thinks of money he'll be kickin down your door
This is for my slangers and hustlers in wranglers and rustlers
We bangin on busters no justice just us
Definition of the hustle, is mind over muscle
Chingo Bling be "Tango & Cash" like Kurt Russell
Bootleggers lovin Chingo cause my shit really sells
If they was bootleggin you, they could barely pay the bills
Streets ask if you got heart, you dudes is pop tart
One good lick you get knocked out the pop charts
That's why I grind from the ground up
They see me nowadays I be bling blowed up, Chingo paid

[Hook]

[John Cena]
Yo Murs, this John Cena from the WWE
Fillin you in on a different struggle
The struggle that takes place in four corners y'know
And it go like this
You think it's all fun and games but this shit is no joke
The type of stage where the millionaires be cuttin ya throat
They move quick but I'm quicker, Cen' stiffer than straight liquor
You fall by the wayside I ain't gon' lay wit'cha
Born to keep movin, provin 'em wrong
A straight hustler, stay true to the song
In the street they pull heat to try to settle a beef
In the squared circle, you feel the metal to teeth
Why's everybody lovin you, when you feedin 'em steak?
You fall off you look around you'll be seein who fake
A true hustler, fall on his face and keep risin
So just when they counted me out, I surprised 'em
Fuck a dollar out of 15 cents, when I be clockin in
My punch card make money appear, out of oxygen
As long as I'm breathin, my pockets will swell
And John Cena's the kid, that go through hell for a cell, what?What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do, what would you do?

(Verse 1: Tha Trademarc)
Uh, this is how it go down
I have the black-pound-silence so it don't make sound
I pile a 150 outta town, ain't nobody around
Im in the back seat breakin it down
My love has been a bad streak dawg lately I found
Our press made us turn the radio down
But God bless now they talkin bout layin me down
Now they on about shovels in the weight of the ground
What now?
Preachin on the way that they handle thing
Watin patiently to do the 6-foot Sand Thing
Now, so I take a second look at my life
I made too many mistakes that I just couldn't make right
Should've been more focused than I take things light
When I'm gone this is what y'all will say I was like
An arrogant fool, no not that baddest or cool
Just a big fish caught up in the shallowish pool
Not a big name playa, in fact its true
Never would have been shit without the kats he knew
He got lucky rode the coattails of everyones fame
In two weeks ain't nobody gon' rememba his name
Fuck It
I'm ready to go, I done made records
Made monetary off of the flow
More importantly though, I proved everyone wrong
Its all over regardless what you say when I'm gone
What now?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do, what would you do?

(Verse 2: John Cena)
I want y'all to feel the wound, its the truth in my words
I been quiet for too long, the truth should be heard
It was a while back, 10:20 in the morn'
Kat should up on my lawn in the rug-ed uniform
Unexpected, theres a knock on my door
I met this fool in the club, I don' see him before
Open to great him, but the second he sees me
His eyes buckle, his voice is uneasy
But it's cool, I didn't even catch it at first
I check his shoulder, homie's rockin a purse
Now I know something's tricky, but I'm already sittin down
Homie pipes up, you should hear what he's spittin out
Says I've been sleepin wit his wifey
And he ain't the type of kat to take that shit lightly
I made a move and he told me homie wait
Reached in his purse pulled a chrome 38
He asked me if I'm ready to die
Said he was gonna blow my brains all over the sky
Said he was leavin the country, and he was straight with the passports
Cocked the hammer, I'm thinkin my last thoughts
I'm in a bad way, nothin could save this
I close my eyes hopin it's painless
Just waitin for the sound, ready to swallow too
But homie havin trouble with his follow through
By a miracle, I avoid the chalk ground
Homie's confused, he just wanna be talked down
His wife is sleepin through town and he knew it
Picked me outta the crowd but couldn't do it
He Squashed it, and as he's walkin away
I realize life is short so I'm markin the day
Now it's full speed ahead, I'll rest when I'm dead
And I could give a Fuck what the next man said
I live how I wanna live
Buy what I wanna buy
Do what I wanna do
Try What I wanna try
Fear nothin, take chances
Not afraid to fail, always makin advances
So when I ride on the Grim Reaper Highway
No regrets bitch, I did it my way
Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do, what would you do?[Hook: John Cena and Trademarc]
This is just another day in the life
Seven flight connectors - past due bill collectors
This is just another day in the life
Mo' money mo' problems - and I ain't got money to solve 'em
This is just another day in the life
Gettin mobbed by fans - man nobody even knows who I am
This is just another day in the life
This is just another day... in my life

[John Cena]
Everybody askin me - what you really like?
Is this really life? Do you really fight?
Do you fear the mic, when there's millions watchin?
Are you super rich now, how much grip you coppin?
You the new kid, now you gettin some shine
When every vet sayin that it's not yo' time
My hustle is non-stop and it's not yo' grind
Plus I hear very clear, I'm not so blind
Beef I don't sweat it, sleep I don't get it
I remember your face it's just your name I forget it
These days they melt together as one
I got some plans to do shit that ain't never been done
Take this game into battles that ain't never been won
I ain't gon' walk through life, I think it's better to run
And yeah I'm eatin right if you askin
But the size of my wallet that's reflection of passion

[Hook]

[Tha Trademarc]
Just another face in the crowd, so to speak
Huh, my electric was cut off last weak
No heat, no food, no money, no girls
And if life's my oyster then I ain't found pearls
Makin moves every day so the ends could meet
No gas money, so I use my legs and feet
Everybody I meet man, they likely saw
That I be in the same clothes from the night before
Shoes so old you can call 'em retros
Man I'm so damn broke, even my wallet echoes
I got a dollar and change; man, I'm under the gun
That buck's the only thing keepin me from bein a bum
That's why I'm writin these words man, so I can get on
So I can realize bein poor was makin me strong
And the only reason I can't rub pennies together
Is cause I carry big bills, in genuine leather

[Hook]

[Cena] Shakin hands with some fans by the thousands
[Marc] My place so poor, looks like public housin
[Cena] Gettin the Porsche when I shoulda got the CL6
[Marc] My ride broke down, I'mma kinda between whips
[Cena] Face on the X-Box, you played the game lately?
[Marc] Man I can't rent, I owe too much in late fees
[Cena] Do I, charter a jet, or fly first class?
[Marc] Do I take a cab? Bus seats hurt my ass
[Cena] Pay my jeweler in cash, he don't take a check
[Marc] The chain I rock, leaves a green mark on my neck
[Cena] Do I get the filet steak or the shrimp & crab mix?
[Marc] Do I get a number 3 or a number 6?
[Cena] Get in the club V.I.P. man they lettin me slide
[Marc] Man they bust me for dress code, I'm still outside
[Cena] Everybody wanna be down, but I ain't got no friends
[Marc] Man nobody's around, I ain't got no friends

[Hook][Intro/Hook: Big L sample]
I shoulda been out, I'm de-de-deadly
When I pu-pu-pull the pin out, keep frontin
I'mma try-try-try ya chin out
I knocked a lot-lot-lot-lot out of men out
Keep frontin, I'mma try-try-try ya chin out
I knocked a lot-lot
I knocked a lot-lot-lot out of men out
Keep frontin, keep frontin, keep frontin, keep frontin

[Bumpy Knuckles talking over sample]
Yo
Right now
I wanna teach all you MC's out there
How to be
Effective
Let's Rock

[Freddie Foxxx a.k.a. Bumpy Knuckles]
Y'all know what time it is when everybody game
Is everybody else's hustle and everybody's shame
Is somebody else's blame, whatever I became
I did it with hot rhymes and a lung full of flame
I never refrain, from loadin up and takin aim
Like chicks flows are different, I never cum/come the same
My mic will be the dame, written or off the brain
I show up with my chest pumpin hard like Notre Dame
I lose then I regain, hustle is in the vein
I'm drinkin protein shakes to muscle up the brain
In the black Chevy Suburban sippin champagne
With champagne, dick out doin the damn thang
We movin in the fast lane, with them black thangs
On the way to the Bronx, to do the ski-mask thang
I don't know what's so funny cause I ain't laughing
The part is for a dead body, guess who's casting

[Hook]

[John Cena talking over sample]
Alright bro, I'm hearin you
I'mma see what I can do
See how I can rip it
And be, effective
Follow this

[John Cena]
Cena spittin with the Bump Bump Bump for the Knux
Your whole crew gettin dumped dumped dumped with the chumps
We rollin like Donald Trump Trump Trump with the bucks
Your bitch-ass gettin jump jump jumped cause you suck
Follow me, you stick around round round when it's hot
You claimin that you down down down but you not
You try to offer me a pound pound pound you get got
I can't wait to hear the sound sound sound of you shot
You hearin me, it's time to show show show I got plans
That's all you brought you bettter go go go get your mans
A legal hustle, ain't no no fuckin with grams
Stash the heat cause I can throw throw throw with my hands
I'm tellin you, on screen screen screen with these flicks
Catch me on the scene scene scene with three chicks
I fuck like a fiend fiend fiend with three dicks
Fuck a sixteen teen teen I'm just sick

[Tha Trademarc over sample]
Yeah, what's good fellas
I'm feelin y'all man
Most these cats
Can't engineer, they career
Yeah, Trademarc, bout to
Bout to show y'all
How to be, effective

[Tha Trademarc]
My camou' colors dog they be beige and brown
That shit was all love 'til you cowards came around
With the same ol' sound that's why your payroll down
That's how the game go now that's why you ain't gain ground
Cause you stuck on then dog, you ain't on now
And that's how it's been baby cause you ain't know how
You move your pen lazy maybe or your beats don't pound
I move quicker than the word on the street go 'round
I write down every lesson that my peeps hold down
You let your heat go blaow if you ain't speak profound
I write sixteens down 'til I hit green now
Makin up slang, ain't know what shit mean now
Trademarc, Marc Predka, jot the real name down
You can catch it on every marquee in town
Sayin Trademarc, ain't nobody like you now
Probably sweatin this track dog, go wipe your brow

[Hook] - 2X

[Bumpy Knuckles]
You see, that's all it takes
Is for a man to make an effort to be, effective
And if you're not, effective... then you're defective
Hahahaha..[Freddie Foxxx a.k.a. Bumpy Knuckles]
Hahahaha...
Y'all know the rep, yeah, listen

My name is Bumpy Knuckles, I write that fuckin flame
And kill for the right price I got a buck in name
My forty caliber too fresh, stuck in aim
We roll like 18 wheelers in the truckin game
I'm nice with mics there's nothin more I like
Than to paralyze your left side and leave you all right
I be layin front of your crib with Tec-y all night
Tryin to get them 9 millimeters loaded up tight, listen
I'm like a Cadillac, I write a battle rap
So smooth contest you'll be out of that
Y'all know the beef is stewin, that Bumpy came to ruin
You may be signed but you don't know what the fuck you doin
I make aight hot, I make dope raw
And send you higher than a long Colt four-four
You know the only rap pimp that kept a ho poor
And slam a fool on his back and break the whole floor

[Hook: Bumpy Knuckles]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
We keep on, once the cops are gone
This is real street spit you best be warned
Tell your favorite MC the mic is on
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
We keep on, once the cops are gone

[John Cena]
Yeah, yeah
It's the J daddy, not Hov' or Jam Master
My mic is correct, but y'all know the hands faster
See you bitch rappers I'm attackin the pile
Y'all be cryin foul cause I'm hackin your style
I make sure you and your mans done
When I see y'all both drop, I'm the cat screamin And1
You see me on the team dog you know the game's over
Stones on my wrist, and a chip on my shoulder
Sixteens cashin in on another hot beat
Go cop me a drop with the butterscotch seats
And we better not meet, if we do you gon' see a change
Make sure you whole FACE gettin rearranged
We rollin up in the blacked out truck dog
It's Freddie Foxxx, now you deal with Krupt Mob
It's gas on the fire, any time a track blaze
Squad known to beef up the Heat, just like the Shaq trade

[Tha Trademarc]
This my 9 to 5, this ain't no hobby cat
Copycat killers bite styles, my rhyme piles is heavy
Give me a beat, man I'll body that
Spittin that heat street raps man they nod to that
What you smilin at? You R&B, man that's hardly rap
You lost the beat, man you bought a map
Matter fact, here's my next rap, borrow that
Been off the street too long, I want my corner back
You ain't a player, you a armchair quarterback
You ride the beat like side streets on a flat
Don't play dumb, I know where you came from
You only seen slugs buddy after the rain come
Keep it subtle, Trademarc got you bitch
Like babies suckin tits talkin 'bout mami let's cuddle
It's gon' be what it's gon' be, you duck down
A quiet cat with a violent rap, what now?

[Hook][John Cena at a live show]
It's the joint baby, GOTTA MAKE IT LOUD {*crowd cheers*}
SO LET ME HEAR SOME NOISE FROM THE CROWD {*more cheering*}

[Tazz] That's noise!

[Hook 2X: John Cena]
It's the joint baby, gotta make it loud
Get the point yo you gotat make it loud
Everybody in the club make it loud
SO LET ME HEAR SOME NOISE FROM THE CROWD

[Verse 1: John Cena]
Yeah, yeah
We came to kick the door down, it's time to hit the floor now
Yo... we got some shit in store now
So; clap your hands while we let the sax blow
Not quite crispy green, but we came to stack dough
We ain't maxed yo, we just try and get this money right
Bills made of Spandex, I still keep my money tight
Never stoppin, all I see is the money like
The kid on the mic is too +Raw+ for your Monday night
If you got in free, or your fuckin cover's paid
Bounce to this motherfucker like you was some Rubbermaid
This ain't that Cristal sippin type shit
It's that bottle breakin, startin riot type shit
So jump up and down 'til ya break the floor
Yo we keep it underground like a basement tour
East coast reppin, stretchin out to L.A
Not double oh seven but we +Die Another Day+, what

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tha Trademarc]
I tear up any track, front to back
Like Roy Jones takin on fifty year-old cats
Makin comebacks, where you at, cats spit soft shit
Like whispers and gloves, I'm not hearin that
It's all love maybe if you wanna rub baby
Anything but that, step back lady
Trademarc, John Cena, clubbin it up
We got Chaos on the one and two, cuttin it up
I'm all about laid back, don't jock, I hate that
I see through haters games, don't mistake that
I still got love if you buyin our shit
If you claim you hatin us, but you ridin our dicks
Everybody hear the name, Marc Predka
It's gonna ring like an echo for years, I never left ya
All y'all raise your glass to this shit
Cause Trademarc's the head of the class of misfits

[Hook]

[Verse 3: John Cena]
We steal your top spot, and you not gettin your number back
Chop down competition like I was a lumberjack
Clear out the club floor, we keep 'em comin back
Tough to bring down like an overweight runningback
Yeah - and we blaze 'em baby
Trademarc, John Cena, we amazin baby
Yo we tear up any crew, leave a motherfucker worn
Y'all are just soft like some Cinemax porn

[Verse 4: Tha Trademarc]
I move a crowd like a bomb scare
Grab the mic when we hittin it right, if you want fear
Some say Trademarc, he ain't all there
We old school like when Sonny, was on Cher
Take it back like a Richard Pyror 8-track
And grab a chunk of your change like a state tax
Man please, we want platinum plaques
I want cream, green, cheddar cheese, to grab in stacks

[Hook]

[Scratching Trademarc to fade]
"Chaos on the one and two, cuttin it up"
"That's that shit!"

{*crowd chanting "Ce-na, Ce-na, Ce-na" at the end*}I wanted to apologize to anybody that I might have let down last night.

This is… this is kind of hard to understand, but sometimes you can try so hard at something.

Sometimes you can be so prepared, and still fail. And every time you fail, it’s painful, it causes sadness, and especially as I saw last night, it causes disappointment.
I’ve often said a man’s character is not judged after he celebrates a victory, but by what he does when his back is against the wall. So no matter how great the setback, how severe the failure, you never give up.

You never give up, you pick yourself up, you brush yourself off, you get up and move on and overcome and that is what I believe!

So… there are those who were so offended by my actions last night that they might have lost faith in me.

I absolutely respect your decision to do so. But I’m not talking to them… I’m talking to those people who still believe!

Tonight, I speak to those who still proudly stand in my corner! You have not given up on me, and I will NOT give up on you!John Cena and Roman Reigns are standing in the ring with microphones.

John Cena: I wanna say thank you for what you did last week. I was in a pretty bad way and you bailed me out. So thanks for that. And uh...cute little stunt at the end of the Raw. I saw...your message was loud and clear, you are not to be ignored.

And this Sunday, it is every man for himself, and I understand that. But Roman, we have to make it to Sunday. And I understand you don't trust anybody but you have been screwed over by The Authority. And hell The Authority, they ain't said to m-

Roman Reigns: Get to the damn point, John.

John Cena: ....say what?

Roman Reigns: You heard me...

John Cena: Alright all I'm saying is this. We should handle The Authority tonight, and if you want, we get Kane and Orton out of the way 6 days at Battleground and well....we see if you're as good as you think you are.


Roman Reigns: I think you're right. We should get rid of Orton, and Kane. And then it's just me and you, John. And maybe we're gonna see if you're really as good as you think YOU are.


John Cena:  You know I see that look in your eye-

Dean Ambrose appears on the titantron, interrupting John Cena.

Dean Ambrose: Guys, guys, guys. Alright I understand the whole testosterone-driven competitiveness that's going on right now. But enough of this whole "prettiest girl at the dance" argument routine you got going on, okay? Cause' we ain't dancin' tonight boys. We're fightin'. We got a 6-man tag against Kane, Randy Orton, and Triple H's little bag boy, Seth Rollins.

Now The Authority always has a plan, but tonight I got a plan of my own that's called "Operation SCREW The Authority." And it starts when you two stop arguing. We get together, and we kick their asses!

Kane steps into the camera view behind Dean, and then Seth Rollins step into view. Ambrose looks at them both and begins hitting them. Randy Orton comes into view and they all beat down Ambrose, leaving him a crumpled mess on the ground by the end of it.[Intro: John Cena]
Yeah
You can't help but feel it
Can't help but feel this one
Uh-huh uh yeah

[Verse 1: John Cena]
Excuse me for a minute while I lighten the mood
Just clap with me like the lightning do, yeah
A bit of soul food that you be bitin into
And if you feel me then I'm writin for you, uh-huh
Right now put another coat of wax on the ride
For a minute put the beef and the gats to the side
Cause this track's got a vibe to chill to
Enjoy life for 5 minutes, man it's not gon' kill you
It's okay to be hard and stay true man
But at the end of the day, we all hu-man
This one's for you, the ones that you close to
Show some love, it's what you supposed to
Right now, forget the ends and the Benz
Pop a cold one, man toast it wit'cha real friends
Call your folks, tell 'em you tight now
Cause everything lookin pretty good right now

[Hook - sped up vocal sample]

[Verse 2: Tha Trademarc]
Right now baby, we all gon' ride
So place those things on your hips or side
The soul vibe gon' change, give way with fame
But sometimes the moral change or stay the same
Relax baby, right now you here
And sit back baby, with a round of beer
And cheer to those friends who crowded near
For those passed on in spirit they there
It's gon' be what it must, break bread wit'cha crew
If you got kids take the crust
It's all love baby, tell your girl she's strong
And whisper in her ear after dinner it's on
And take it slow baby, cause everything real
When you at family dinner y'all enjoy that meal
Thank God that you healthy and you keepin it tight
And keep your dreams lighthearted when you sleepin at night

[Hook - sped up vocal sample]

[Verse 3: John Cena]
Yeah - and right now I'm showin love to my brothers and my old man
To my girl, "Let's Get it On" like the slow jam
To everybody that I'm runnin down the road with
Y'all my family, I know that you know this
Fox, Rock, B's and Chaos
Y'all growin up with me man, true to life players
Grandma or grandpa watchin up above
Trademarc you my heart cousin, nothin but love

[Verse 4: Tha Trademarc]
Thanks momma, for all that you was
You a strongarm lady baby crazy with love
My sister raised me, those are the facts
And taught me how to rebuild when the order collapsed
And right now I'm blessed no stress no less
And thanks hip-hop for givin me back focus, huh
Yeah John, what can I say?
It's all love from day one, you showed me the way
