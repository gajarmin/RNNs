[Verse 1]
I done came down, hold up
Grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin' to control her
She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm G'd up, East up
Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Verse 2]
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mind bomb
Only if you got that zip tight
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

[Hook]

[Outro]
H-Town, oh yeah, I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup
I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up, fuck, 'chea[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
She drop that dang thing on me
I stand up throwing bands up
Girl, everything on me
Know I'm in this bitch with my niggas
Long thing in my jeans
It's getting late and these niggas rowdy
Don't leave without it on me
I got them stones all in my chain
Big dollar my bank
Said that she ain't cutting
I said "What the fuck did you came for?"
Is he yo nigga?
Is he yo bitch?
I'm heading to wherever
I'm gon' see your bitch
If niggas hating on me
Put the hammer all in my hands
When she see me up in that 3
She went magic all on her man
Cuz she know what's up
Oh yeah, she know what's up

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
You ain't got a man? Come fuck with me
Roll up in that Benz, that AMG
You know I got them bands, they all on me
I know you wanna roll. So, you can tell me no..
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up

Verse 2:Kirko Bangz]
Say you ain't got a man sure enough
I pull up in that Lamb' hold up
We both want it, we can't blame no one
And I ain't trying to play no one
But he can't make you famous like this
No, he don't got you fiending like this
Say, he might had your body but tonight I'm in your soul
Girl, just keep playing my shit
Lo-love the way I talk
I make you love the way I sing
Love the way I walk
I'll make you love the way I swang
Girl I make you love everything that
You don't love about these niggas
Girl, I love you naked

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
Cuz when you drop that thing on me
Like it's the end of the night
I swear if niggas hate you know I got that thing on me
No need for no fight

[Hook]

[Outtro: Tory Lanez]
Hop in. Oh, whats up
When I seen that body go down
And your friends at the club
Me I'm really tryna go now that I got you
It's going down
So,girl don't you run from me
Cuz what I like, you like. We gon like
Ima feel up, feel down. Feels alright
Might have to fly your ass to Toronto
(Kirko: "Hol' Up..why?")
Cause shawty got that ass like a model
And all these other women they got nothing on her
You know that ass stop me from leaving here tonight and tomorrow
I officially laid it down
Oh, I laid it down
Told you not to pull up with your shawty
Take care[Verse 1: August Alsina]
Am I wrong for wanting better?
Should I just settle forever?
Oooh, I swear it feels like
This is as good as it gets
Am I wrong for wanting cheddar?
Although they’ll tell you that I’ll never
Get out of here, I swear, I'm
Driven by a better life

[Hook: August Alsina]
I wanna be rich
Don’t see nothing wrong with wanting more
I wanna be rich
So tired of sleeping on the floor
I wanna be rich
There’s so much that I want
I want a house on the hill and a boat by the lake
And most of all I wanna get paid
I wanna be rich

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
I'm sick and tired of this bullshit
Got a full time job, but a nigga still can’t afford shit
Okay, I'm in the strip club, man, throwing all this dough, this dough
When I leave here I ain’t gon' have no more, god damn
I'm tired of fronting for these fake niggas
Need a diamond chain to be great, nigga
I got one, but I ain’t great, nigga
What it takes, oh yeah, for the rap game to notice me, oh yeah
I topped the charts for nine weeks, but they still ain’t notice me
Guess I gotta rob me a nigga, guess I gotta kill me a nigga
Guess I gotta get up on the block, sell rocks to a nigga
Guess I gotta slide me a nigga, but that ain’t me, yeah
I’m H-town ‘til I D-I-E
Young Kirko, you know it’s me
And I’m singing like, hold up
I came down
I was a young nigga when I rolled up
It came too fast, fucked my money up
All I did was smoke and drink, yeah
Now I’m back here, this ain't last year
And I’mma do it like it’s my last year
Man, I can’t lie, I wanna be rich

[Hook: August Alsina]

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
Man, I’m tired of feeling pain, tired of feeling rain
Tired of being ashamed, tired of second place
Tired of hiding my face, man, I’m tired of getting no love
Tired of hitting the club when I know I got work to do
How come I ain’t heard from you? God damn
Okay, I see how you doing when a nigga got money
Nigga rocking that fly shit
Popping bottles in the club
Everybody in the club straight sipping on my shit
Pushing that Range, diamonds and the chains
Everybody came when I had shit
But when the money get low everybody go talking that fly shit
But I can't knock how the game is
Ain’t the first nigga that’s famous
I can’t change shit, but I’mma be okay
Cause man I’ve been out here, I’ve been grinding
I’m tired of these niggas, man, I’ve been too silent
My momma she told me “you claim it, you got it” and I’m like okay
I’mma do it for my city, I’mma be on top, okay
I'mma shine on these ho ass niggas like all day
I'mma fuck any girl I want, drive every car you don't
Rock anything I want, man, I wanna be rich

[Hook][Hook: YG]
When I think about you, I think ho!
When I dream about you, I think ho!
It only took me some hours to hit, I think ho!
When I see you with my nigga Chris, I think ho!
When you pull up in your whip, I think ho!
Act different when you get your chips, I think ho!
Wouldn't do it for your homies, do it for your bitch, ho!
Ho!

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
These hoes only fucking with a nigga, with them figgas
You ain't got it, them bitches ain't fucking with you
Stop saving these hoes, fuck these bitches
Stop bringing them around a real nigga
Cause a ho gon' be a ho, and a bitch gon' be a bitch
Don't put your dick up in a ho that make you money
And these hoes fucking different niggas every night
But she still be up in church every Sunday
So bitch, tell the DJ play my shit
And tell your home girls to get with it
Don't be ashamed to be a ho, if you a ho, then let them know
You getting money and they need to fuck with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
When I wake up in the morning, I think dough
Bad bitch follow all the rap niggas, she a ho
Got a 100 thousand likes and a million something followers
I'm a street nigga, I'm just tryna get my dollars up
Kirko Bangz and my nigga YG
Yo Gotti, trill nigga, ask your ho about me
Real nigga shit, don't do that, get your feelings hurt
Want a red bitch in a mini skirt
Chanel boots, Celine purse
Shawty not a stripper but can make it twerk
When you think about me you think bread
When I think about you, I think head

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
These hoes gon' be hoes
You cuffin' and loving her, but she fucking on the low
And I'm like "damn", bitch, what you saying?
Ho, you know you got a man
But she gon' fuck all the niggas, that all the bitches is fucking
And she gon' post all them pictures that she don't look like in public
She gon' be in the club, bottles poppin', she boppin'
When the sparkles start coming, bitches start table hoppin'
They see me when I'm coming down riding slow
You ain't a ho, why you fucking on the floor?
You and your girlfriend wear each other clothes
Bitch we don't save these hoes

[Hook][Intro: Kirko Bangz]
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I'm living, shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
And shawty wanna roll, I’m like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I’m just living my life
I’m just young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes on my spare time
She don’t fuck on the first night, then she don’t meet my deadline
Niggas smokin that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like Yea Mon
I’m sipping on the whole eighth of the purp shit, bed time
I cop foreigns like Jordans, y'all niggas ain’t important
Shawty want that molly, and I’ma get what she order
Tats all on my body, strapped up like a war
Eat the pussy I prolly, if it smell like water
Her neck talk say fuck me, my wrist talk say suck me
The niggas claiming they balling, I take your bitch Kris Humphries
And make them buy me a whip nigga, nothing less than the 6 nigga
Yall ran your mouth like hoes, all you are some bitch niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Okay, your baby mama: I bought that, side chick: I bought that
Main chick: I bought that, and your dream girl just called back
I’m still repping that north side with that big P on my ballcap
These broke niggas don’t like me, cause they say I think I’m all that
Now Coon cop that ‘rarri, I don’t even feel salty
Niggas claimin my flows I should put these niggas on Maury
And I ain’t claming these hoes, have these haters looking all sorry
When I pulled up in that Rolls, swag was surfing on ‘em like gnarley
I’m with 3 hoes like Santa Claus, and I’m the boss, Diana Ross
Hit you girl by mistake nigga, wasn’t even in my plan at all
I told homie I hit it there, this nigga wanna be playing it off
Knowing that girl is main thang, that shit don’t like nigga, bang bang!

[Hook][Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl keep shitting on all these hoes
Won't let another nigga get too close
And can't nobody tell you nothing
Gettin' money is all we know
Just be yourself
She knows how stay in her lane
She knows how stay in her lane

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
She know about a couple bitches I'm fucking but never ask no questions
I'm like yeah girl that's how it gotta be
And she can come around me and my niggas even if we got bitches
She orderin' food and rollin' up the weed
Shawty like to keep it real low
She sip some drank, she chill, she smoke
Shawty keep it real G
And I don't need a lock up on my phone
If I'm talking to some bitches don't be on my shoulders let a nigga be
And that's how she do it
She don't be on my page looking for bitches I'm following
Pictures I'm liking nah she don't do it
And every time we fuck she'll never spend a night
When I fall asleep she hit the front door
And I ain't gon'  lie sometimes I get lonely and I wanna lay up a little bit
She like boy you better stay in your lane and save that simp shit for another bitch

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
Shawty keep it real low-key
She focused on the money she ain't trippin' bout me
She pay her own bills and she do her own thang
And her name ain't never in the streets
Her girlfriends gon' to the club every week
But she don't never go she got deadlines to meet
And she don't never bring up shit she heard about me
God damn this girl so thowed
I fuck with her when I got some free time
She never ask a nigga for some me time
Invention in that pussy body divine
She don't never take pictures, I don't meet moms
It's been a year since the last time she seen the club
To keep it trill, shit I only seen her three times
I met her through a friend I used to be down
She say it's cool shit y'all only fucked three times

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign][Verse 1]
Lil country ass nigga from the eastside street
Give a fuck what you think about me
I been gone for a minute now a young nigga back
Better get your girlfriend away from me
And come back so strong tho aye
She throw it back so strong tho aye
I miss playing in her walls
Miss fucking in the bathroom stalls on the low low
I ain't tryna expose you
But girl you know you ain't loyal
My bad if I ignored you

Cause a bitch don't want a broke nigga no no

That nigga broke yo fuckin heart, gotten that bitch pregnant
That’s why you used to fuck with girls, almost turned into a lesbian
Let me put this dick back in yo life and get you right
You say yo ex nigga never hit it right
We ain’t gotta play no games, you know I can’t
Put them pretty lips on me, says I want you and you want me

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Hair in a bun cause sometimes your hair just hides your beauty
Swear on my son, ain't too many things could hide your booty
Call me what you like, but bet I slide with cutie
Kenny name wasn't Bud, but he still ride with Rudy
And that's why we comfortable as a Huxtable
You been around since the Lunchables, girl I fucks with you
In the back of the truck with you, same fingers I chuck with two
I'm just playing with you, thinking bout staying with you
Not forever but at least until the A.M. with you
Still playing with it, but you like it raw
Might need a morning after, what we did the night before
Might go another round if you're trying to fight me more

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Chris Brown]

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Cake cake cake cake cake, I know you love it
Icing like Nuvo with a touch of red velvet
Look at you, you a star
I'm a G, Joe the Don
Super thief, I go hard
In these sheets, I'm a God
Lord, Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior
I wanna tear them shits off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy, Superfly Snuka
Have you coming back to back, more sex to cook up
But ask the girl will I hit advance
She pokes it out picture perfect, Instagram
I hit home runs and drain last shots
She tore her ACL from all the backshots

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Chris Bown]

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]

Cause her boyfriend listen to me

That nigga, if he trip, I got a whole clique of killers with me
See, I'm the man now
Rolling 24's through the hood, women checking for me

I sip codeine out the styrofoam, 27-10 is the kinda grind on
{I ain’t ever love a bitch, so I’m riding alone, prolly when them niggas ain’t on the kind of shine I’m on}
Big dully trucks with the big rims, and the Cadillac with the fifth wheel
(We from the hood and we keep steel, if you try to jack them you’re gonna get killed)
I don’t wear my britches tight, I wear them loose
Active Athlete for all my footwear, homie I got too many shoes
{I’m the man in my city, tell them niggas I won’t lose}
{Cross that path, and my nigga Hawk, we still gon’ chunk the deuce}

[Hook: Trae - chopped & screwed]

Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas

Gla-glass underneath, beatin’-beatin', my block
Pop-pop my trunk, chain-chain fulla rocks
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas

[Paul Wall]
You can find me in h-o-u-s-t-o-n, ridin' in

Trae the truth, ridin’ right behind, two cups full and I’m on my grind
Talkin’ dine, respect my mind, I'll show you boys how Texas get dine

Bangin’ screw and drankin’ Big Moe, basically get that dough, bro

[Slim Thug]
Northside, where the boss ride, e'ry day I got play outside (huh?)
Leavin’ them haters mouth wide, can't be denied when they see me slide
Through the hood like I live there, shit, I got a few cribs there
All my G’s still chill there, we barbecuin' them ribs there (huh? What?)
Smoke blunts and sip punch like its lunch, every day we do it
Listenin’ to nothin but Texas music, perfect match for that good fluid
Find me in the hood, in the city I claim, everybody dine in H-town know me mayne

[Hook]

[Kirko Bangz]
Uhh, I gotta bad ass bitch, parked outside

Pull a lil’ bitch then I catch ghost, just a lil’ kid from the ghetto
Never had shit but I got a lil’ bit, when I got a couple hits under this belt
Throw a H up, nigga, I ain’t tryna belch or nothin’, ain't got a whole lotta money but I'm wealthy money
I sip a whole lottta drank but I'm healthy mami, daddy was cool, but he couldn’t really tell me nothin'
Uhh~!... Everybody think a nigga lucked up
Young Kirko, he done blew up, from the H-town, nigga what’s up?

[Bun B]
I’m Port Author, Texas, let’s get that straight off the top
That’s where the hustlin’ and grindin’ and the hatin’ don’t stop
From the westside to east, we out here duckin’ them cops
And coming dine, candy paint, on them motherfuckin’ chops
It’s the land of the trill, that’s where the whole thang came from
And it just a word, or where a rapper get his name from
It’s a way of life, and we live to the fullest
For years, we represent it with blood sweat and bullets
Ho, I’m from Texas!

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Bitch, I hear ya talkin'
You about that shit, then take that off
Fake ass niggas gotta lay down
Reppin' H-Town, now a nigga can't play that off
Niggas came down to the city, stole from the city
Hoes from the city like "play that song"
These rap niggas know I'm the new nigga

Bitches know I'm 'bout it, man
Love the way that I swang that chrome

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
When I hold my cup up, it's just like lifting weights
Look like I'm chewin' instead of sippin' because this is an 8
I don't want no soda, homie, I'd rather sip it straight
I'm an OG out that screwed up clique
King of the Ghetto, this is my name
I be rollin' on swangers with candy black paint on 'em
If it rain, still ain't gon' get a stain on 'em
I'm from Texas, you can tell how I talk
I'm from Texas, you can tell how I walk
Six-piece wing dinner from Frenchy's
King of the ghetto, ain't never been friendly
Just put eleven more ounces in me
Whenever you see me, my cup ain't empty
So many fifteens, so many twelves, so many 6-5-9s
I'm bangin' so hard, everybody else bangin'
But I don't give a fuck if they park by mine
I've got a thunder trunk
I keep coughin' cause I smoke thunder skunk
I've got the lightning dick, I need thunder cunt
And I dare any one of y'all niggas to mess with Texas
Texas gon' fuck you up

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
First they steal your lighter, then they steal your style
Fat Pat is my idol, I've got twenty bands on my smile
Forgot to pay they homage, they just reuse and recycle
Man, they lie so much that they don't know the truth
But they'll swear to God on the Bible
I don't know where they do that at
But it damn sure ain't in Texas
Ridin' in the 'Lac down 45, I-10 is my exit
I do this shit for the city, swangin'
I've got wood grain in my Leffries
Pimp C is the greatest
Motherfucker, talkin' down is a death wish
Codeine is my fetish - pourin' up is a way of life
Legend stealer, Jerome Bettis
You punk sipper ain't drakin' it right
8 or all, that's a day in the life
Open trunk, and array of lights
They used to say this was local shit
Now everywhere drinkin' muddy Sprite
Pour up...

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
I rep for Texas, nigga
You gon' respect us, nigga
We got ya sippin' out them white cups like Texas niggas
Got ya shinin' diamond grills like them Texas niggas
Rappers screwed up and chopped like them Texas niggas
You get the message, nigga? So chop some checks up with us
Them broads be tryna get us, cause they know we them niggas
She love my Texas swag, and how I keep it G
Let her roll in the slab, she wanna be seen with me
I tell her pay that fee, it's pimpin' with me, mane
Ask any bitch in Texas, ain't no sippin' with me, mane
Still drippin' candy stains, got that drink by the pint
Cause I'm a Texas nigga, what we do Kurt Cobain

[Hook]Uh, Say this a letter to my pops mane
Not the one that's been free
The one behind the scenes I looked up to a lot mane
I got your letter hate to see that you on lock
But it's still grudge in my heart from how you took my brother's car
And you gave it to a broad
And she the whole reason that yo ass behind bars and now I hide behind bars
I got too much pride to let anyone inside
Don't let anybody ride cause any night I might fly
Any night I might die
But im still living for Josh and I'm only living for Corey
I love my mama a lot
And I still can't get the thought of you smackin' her in her mouth out my head
So I'm thinkin' about smacking you up a lot
I got a whole bunch of feelings in me nobody knows about
Sometimes I feel like I got a whole bunch of killers in me
And they say life is about forgivin' and forgettin'
And how the fuck I'm gone forgot when I'm holding my lil' sister
She cryin' over a nigga it's fine time will fix it
I been playin' ya role since nine while other children were happy just to be living
I never was playing wit em'
I'm sitting wit mama cryin' we behind on the rent
And since the fourth grade this shit never go away nigga
And now my lil' brother going both ways nigga
But I love him the same can't say I wasn't a shame when I heard it man I cried as I boarded my plane
Mix that with the fact people know I'm getting change
And I ain't want a gun cause I thought that would make me change
I just racked up on my change sacrifice some thangs
Moved my family out the hood cool house can't complain
But my mama still rollin' round in something less than range
But I brought it one morning when she had nothing left but pain
Just to see her mood change to sunshine from rain
Mean more than anything I could possibly gain from fame
And I know you know my oldest cousin
Well them people took her kids
Mama took them from em'
And we helpin' mama raise em' tyrna make em' stronger
She couldn't be a father but she one hell of a mother
I'm tryna think of any pain yes I gotta tell ya
But I guess I gotta save that for another letter
Oh, man you remember the time y'all use to love each other
Damn man now it's like y'all don't even know each other
And in ya letter you told me how you was jealous of me and my real father
When he came over to get me said you couldn't be selfish
Had to let me get to know my fam and get to know my siblings
And then you told me that you lost yo pops when you was six I'm realizing
It's starting to make sense
I'm reading over again tryna make it make sense
Man I fell sorry for you chillin' in that pin
All over again and I ain't tell you bout my deal
But you seen my videos so yeah you know the deal
And I know Bun B damn you know that's trill
And you know I keep some bitches wit me aha
You know I gotta make these niggas envy
And as for my car man I'm riding some black on black
Cause ya little boy got them racks on racks
I remember when he use to have that seventy-two Camaro
Now I'm running around looking for a seventy-two Camaro
Cause damn you was just too cool 22 and I still wanna be like you

[Outro]

Yeah, uh , you know, I usually don't like to open up on songs and shit ya know what im sayin'
After I'm done rapping or what ever
But shit, I'm sayin this shit mean a lot to me
Can you turn the music up for me and let it run
I was just reading your letter
And it was a point in the letter when you was like
As i, when I looked up to you it hurt
And the first time I read it I thought you was like
As I looked up to you like you was my hero and shit
And shit really since you was my hero and shit you know what I'm sayin
But the point when you was sayin I looked up to you it hurt
Was the first time I ever seen you put yo hands on my mom
As I was holding my lil' brother and my lil' sister in my armsYee... dear daddy's girl
You know that daddy loves you
But right now you still in heaven
So, no one's above you
Whenever times get cold
Your daddy's covers
I know it's crazy but
Daddy's yet to meet your mother
And if I have then I guess I've yet to love her
And in the past if I would've fucked some other
You will come into this world with an older brother
Not even knowing that I never loved his mother
But how can daddy tell 'em moma was a quick fuckin'
N his moma askin me to promise that I love him
He think his daddy wouldn't rather anything but him
But my heart ain't wid her so I can't stay
And his mom tryna throw it in yo daddy face
Like I ain't shit n she hope it's hunts me forever
Knowing her n your dad was never together
And that's the start of how black people killin' each other

I just wanna make it perfect for my baby girl
But ican't, it's such a shame we in a crazy world
I jst wish that I can talk to my baby girl
And give her a little head start so she could see the world [x2]

Yeee... baby, when it come to these niggas
Keep ya head in yo books, cause these niggas they'll kill ya
They'll try ya, cry ya, bribe ya out yo panties
N leave ya heart broken like 'why ya can't stand me? '
When you did everything he wanted you to do
But when the right thing is what a nigga wants fo' you
That wouldn't cross his mind he like 'whatchu wanna do? '
If it's a walk through the park he reply like 2 or 3 or 4 until his day be happy
I jst hope you meet the man tht make my baby happy
With our family, imight as well stop rappin'
But wid baby on my mind, I gotta make it happen man
N every late night, I'm wide awake arguin
With yo grandma, she workin like the Mexican
And my girlfriend, told me not to call again
Nights like this, I just wish I had my daughter man...

I just wanna make it perfect for my baby girl
But ican't, it's such a shame we in a crazy world
I just wish that I can talk to my baby girl
And give her a little head start so she could see the world [x2]

And I know you gon' hate the talks but, I'm a let chu know
Cause I'm a hate to see the day when daddy let chu go...
And for smooth sailing, daddy will buy you a boat
But daddy know, daddy gotta let his baby grow...
And don't you ever forget our lil conversations
Think about it on your birthday and graduation
And don't worry bout daddy baby, I'm a make it
I just gotta work hard and have patience
I will never forget our lil conversations
I'll think about it on your birthday n graduation
N don't worry bout daddy baby, I'm a make it
I just gotta work hard and have patience...

I just wanna make it perfect for my baby girl
But ican't, it's such a shame we in a crazy world
I just wish that I can talk to my baby girl
And give her a little head start so she could see the world...[Verse 1]
Look at me now, then look at me later
They tell me that they love me, but I know that they faking
They see I'm getting on, so they conversating
But I don't really care for your conversation, see
I pay attention to my mama's statements
She tell me that she tired, can't wait till I make it
She say she want a house that'll cost a lot
And she tell me that I'm the only real chance she got
So I'm thinking bout that when I'm passing out
Mixtapes for free , I ain't cashing out
And if somebody throw my shit down, I pick it back up
I ain't got shit to be embarrassed about
A nigga's name catching buzz, people saying I'm hot
But the way a nigga living you would think I'm a flop
For the past three summers I ain't really live with my mother
Shit, I been going house to house
How you think the shit feel when you ain't got a job
And you hoping that your cousin won't kick you out?
You take anything you can get
It's like the world wanna eat you, swallow you, and shit you out
And all you really want is somebody to talk to
Somebody that's real, somebody to heart you
Somebody to feel you, to help you get through
The shit that you go through and get to know the real you
Feeling like mildew, sitting in the same positions
Waiting and hoping they'll listen eventually
They asking who the realist, niggas knowing I'll kill it
Yeah you feel it, but you motherfuckers scared to mention me
They say he too young, but they loving his energy
Rarely in the lab, but you loving his chemistry
Niggas getting offended and they tryna get rid of me
While I'm tryna get in, and make it infinity
Literally, never take for granted your ability
It ain't about talent, it's all about your energy
Everything you go through,  take those emotions
Put 'em in a pot, on a plate, that's devotion
We all wanna blow, everybody want a mill
Nigga this is not dro, you can't blow and chill
Shit, you can't chill and blow
Nigga this is real life, and the more that you grow
The more that they gone hate you, I'm letting you know
And I ain't saying I'm the best, but I'm better than most
I'm not a rapper that's a nigga, I'm a nigga that raps
So when you compare me to them, consider the facts (like that )Intro:
Ay yo! I just got this text message right, she told me I better kill it. But uh, little do she know, that what we bout' to do. I'm bout' to take it there. Let's go!'s

Verse 1:
Shit, I told her in the beginning, please don't fall for a nigga. She didn't listen
I told her I'm a young ass nigga on my grind
She told me "you're the only nigga that been on my mind."
I'm thinking that it'll work as I'm pulling down her skirt
She only came over just to do some homework
But now she at the pad, doing everything but math
And when we got through she told me she had a man!
Shit, I'm like "cool." Now I know she understands
That I'm just trying to chill, I ain't tryna' be the man
I got some other plans, got some other shit to do
I got some other plans and they're not including you
She told me she'll chill at the crib till' I get back
Now she getting attached, lil' mama gotta to quit that
Got a nigga wishing that I never would've hit that
But when I get back to the crib ima' hit that!

Verse 2:
I get back to the crib. She all on my computer on skype with her friends. They're like "who's that?" she said, "thats my man." All I can do is laugh like shit she better be playing. She asked could I rap, said she was my biggest fan, she said GodDamn!
I told her I was tired, I'mma chill on the floor. Meanwhile I'm thinking how to get rid of this ho. Then her friend asked what happened with you and Nick?
She said he a trip homegirl we had to split. Now I'm like shit! I remember when I told her me and her should get together if her and her nigga quit. But I was just flirting and that was way before me and her did anything, I told her she was perfect. Now I see how I gotta watch what I'm spitting. You never want to come between a woman and her feelings
But I ain't really trippin' I told her she can stay the night. It was only right, I was trying to be polite. We got done sexing, she started asking questions
God can you please have this girl go on my breakfast? The next day she texted me, I ain't hit her back. The day after that, I ain't hit her back! The next day she texted me saying nigga Fuck You! I texted her back like I thought you knew...I heard about you baby
But I ain't worried about you baby
I know some niggas had you before I got you
But it's my time I got you baby
I heard about the shit you did with Slim Thug
I heard Propain could of hit you at the club
And I heard Doe Beezy had you on the southeast
But let me tell you about me
Girl I wouldn't give a damn if you was a prostitute
And you hit up every rapper that I ever knew
My nigga Killa told me last night that he smashed you too
I told them niggas that shit don't matter to me

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
That shit don't matter to me
No no it don't, no no it don't

Them tattoos on yo thighs killer
I ain't gon' bring up my niggas
And I heard you was a stripper baby
But I don't mind tippin'
Girl we good don't trip
I already know that shit
Why you gotta ask about that
Don't ask me about Mac bitch
Why you tryna tell me about her
Girl I know everything that she did
She called my phone talking about she rapping and recording me on some weak shit
These hoes sell they souls for reality shows
You could book a few parties cause a young nigga put you in the door
And the crazy thing about that shit
I don't never trip about that shit
My big cousin was behind that shit
It still don't matter to me
Boy you learned yo lesson
I hope you learned yo lesson
That shit don't matter to me
No no it don't, no no it don't

Say girl it's alright, girl it's alright
Ooh girl it's all right some shit you can't control
Say girl it's alright, girl it's alright
Ooh girl it's all right some shit you can't control[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy
I won't pay for no pussy
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it
I'm a motherfucking G
And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Hell naw man I'm too throwed
Niggas stay getting shows
Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes

[Verse 1: Wale]
Pay for that, not me, no hell
Y'all the one that bring the c-notes out
This is K.O.D., now they wait on me
Cause if I do not arrive, there wouldn't be no show
Wale, Wale
Hear you talking, but I cannot stay
Chicks involved, but I cannot stay
I spit the raw, I leave a gay bitch, late
Turn your date to a lake, turn your 8 to a great
Turn a nine to a damn! without paying for the date
No debate, ain't no John
You done broke the safe just to get those broads
You been playing the Uno but you getting no drawers
And I poke her face and let her hold no cards
I ain't even tripping, or paying these women
Got plenty fish in that ocean and my rod game is so vicious
And my ? is 450, can I used the whip to 550
Now I 62 cause I get the loot, and she's gon' kiss the ring but no wedding

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Clap that ass, bitch, turn up
Nigga kill the pussy, call it murder
Swerve in the Murcielago
Me without a foreign car, man that's unheard of
In the Maybach, king with my feet up
Curtains drawn, bitch scream when you see us
Hi, I'm your leader, word to Onika
2500 for the sneakers, dope ass nigga, no beeper
I was 16 with a Beamer
Glock with the watch on Aquafina
Niggas going, hyena
Getting pussy posted up at the Dinah
Now we pull up, post in Medinas
With light-skinned bitch like Gina
Aston, Martin
Man that motherfucker cold like Keyshia
Stop signs, Simon says
We don't give a fuck, we run them
Like Tommy Young, been barely men
Man broke niggas, we don't live with them
I don't fuck around, I just fuck her friends
Got eagle doors on that brand new Benz
And a threesome with two twenty twins
I'm rich, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
(Bitch I'm Mack Ma-i-i-i-ine)
Trick what? Lace who?
Baby girl, that ain't what Maine do
Before I chase you, I replace you
Before I break you off, I'mma break you
Matter of fact, fuck you
Got a hundred chicks on my tour bus
Asian chicks, they adore us
I'm feeling like the nigga on the chorus
(Got this drank in my cup
And I'm 'bout to roll up)
Man this bitch talking too much, dawg
(I done came down, hold up)
Heard a nigga say pimping was dead
I showed them my watch and corrected them quick like, "Nah, niggas you're scared"
Now go get you some bread
See it's...
(Money over bitches, and bread over bed
Tell a bitch that I know Khaled, and she take it to the head)
Shit
Shit, one go to store for me
Got another one that's trying to ho for me
Hopefully, she bring more hoes to me
And reverse the game and make em bring dough to me

[Hook][Verse 1]
We're from 2 different places
2 different worlds
Sometimes I feel like im talking to
2 different girls
Cuz' one day you cool we be texting and shit
The next day you text me you stressing and shit
You be listening to your girl
Got your friend in the mix
But that ho ain't ever right like a bad journalist
Let that ash burn a bit
Yeah I'm back up on that cliff
Hoping that that marijuana get me out of all of this
I don’t want no part of this
You got a nigga wondering would you still be calling me if I would had my own whip
I would never got in your car and you would of never said that shit
Out your ass had me thinking that you like my last chick
Girl you had me past whip
Had me goin to class, shit
Had me thinking I should go to church and meet the pastor
I just hope you understand
I ain't tryin' be your man
Well I am but
I just can't be the first to ask it
You told me write you a song
But I ain't imagine
You be gone when I did it
Dear ms Jackson ay

[Hook]
Baby don’t push me away
I was hopin' today I could rain all your troubles away
I say lately you’ve been on my mind baby all the time
And I just found the courage to say
Baby don’t push me away
I was hopin' today I could rain all your troubles away
I say lately you’ve been on my mind baby all the time
And I just found the courage to say ay

[Verse 2]
You got some issues that you need to deal with
I got mines but the issues that you got are in the areas I shine
And the issues that are mine are in the areas you glow
You got money all the time
Most of the time I be broke
You a achaedemic scholar I think school is a joke
If you ask me bring you water i'd probly bring you coke
I do the best that I could do
I'm me and you you
I got a dream I pursue and you got your dreams to
But I don’t think it would hurt if my life included you
And your life included me
In the future well see, ay

I say lately you’ve been on my mind baby all the time
And I just found the courage to say ayIntro:
Double cup and I'm leanin'

(Verse 1: Ace Hood)

Okay now, Purple stuff in my styrofoam
Sippin' slow while they blowin strong
All I need is my dirty sprite
All I need is her super-dome
Drank'd up and I'm dripped out
Caked up and my pistol out
Bad bitch and she thick as fuck
And I'm tryna see if what pussy bite
Bust it open for a real nigga
Bust it open for a trill nigga
Touchdown, whattup? H-Town
Long live the Pimp, this one's for you!
Bun B, my nigga Trae The Truth
Still in the coupe and I'm double dueced
Still in the hood on that purple, fool
Better know what I'm drinkin' ain't grape juice!
I be flowin' through the city, let my chain swing!
How you live, a young nigga tryna maintain
Get money, fuck lames, all my little niggas on the same page
Spend racks when I'm up in Neimans
Gimme head she gon' catch this semen
Hatin on me? Nigga, so what? Ya know what?
Hold up...

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Bun B)

Gangsta nigga, I'm bout it
I'm Trill as fuck so don't doubt it
Tell me what's the haps, cause you know I'm strapped
A nigga never leave home without it
I'm posted up in that Caddy
I'm twistin' up a big fatty
And it's full of dro, and I'mma mack your ho
And you know she callin' me daddy
I'm a trill OG and I earned it
That G code, nigga I learned it
So when I saw the dough they had for me bro
I just grabbed the knob and I turned it
I wanted bread so I chased it
And I got so close I could taste it
I played the deck and got my respect
So nigga I'm the king, now just face it
I'm in the house and I'm chillin'
My mind on cash and I'm willing
I'm on the paper chase, no time to waste
So I could give a fuck how you feelin'
I'm sideways on that buck
My seats is stitched and they tough
You ain't down with that?
Then I'm hide your head in your ass
And be outta luck, wassup?

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Kirko Bangz)

Well it's that young nigga from the Southside
Of that USA I need Calamine
Lotion cause a nigga used to bump
A nigga came from nothing to saying nevermind
To the pretty girls in the magazine
Your girlfriend look like Maxim
A phone book full of Billy Jeans
? Came out that limosine
I been a fan for that Codeine
Since Martin Luther was like 13
Fuckin' queens cause I'mma king
Put 5% on everything
I done threw tint on top of tint
Bumper kit, on bumper kit
Threw my last bitch on my new bitch
And threw ten on my fuckin' dick
I done came down, hold it down for that H-Town
I'mma take the crown
Sippin Hen, dont fuck with Crown
But I'mma just drop this 4th of 9
And free my cousin that doin' time
I'mma pay the lawyer
But I hope he dyin'
Hold it down for a real nigga
Young Kirko, young trill nigga
