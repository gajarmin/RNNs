Artist: Mack 10 & Road Dawgs
Album: Caught Up soundtrack
Song: You Don't Want None

Damn Dawg, sure look you ballin
I hit licks nigga
Yeah homey, with that one-oh piece hangin around yo' neck
Whassup?
I hit licks nigga
Eighteen carat on the wrist, double digit style
What's happenin witchu man?
I hit licks nigga
Pushin ?rar-ies?
I told you dog, I hit licks nigga

[Mack 10]
I Inglewood swing like a king, cause my pockets is the fattest
The young presidential nigga with the platinum status
Maniac Mack 10, and I'm callin all hogs
Now who wanna test the Chickenhawk and the Dawgs?
With the fo'-fo' knockin noodles leavin niggas like top ramen
And Dawg I'm dumpin everytime you're even thinkin about bombin
This a jack move blood, hit the deck and that's real
You need to give up your goods or get your punk ass killed

[Road Dawgs]
In this life I'm takin chances servin, slidin plastic
Got bitches walkin out of banks with cash advances
I came up watchin true ballers; no one can school us
I've seen fools go from mule-rs to U-Haul-ers
Stay strapped for the get back; plus I use it
To jack hustlers and kidnappers *woman screaming*
Every since my Dawg died, I put mo' licks in the mix
Another motherfucker hog tied

In the trunk of the Continental (how you do dat)
Trix are for kids, when I'm finished check his dental (check it)
Step up to spit slugs on him, fool stole from me
I had to plug on him (we know his whereabouts)
No more hesitatin, no more debatin no more waitin
We gotta take him, shake him for his Dayton's
Empty the clip and desecrate him, verbatim
(Kill that nigga yo) You hatin, we gotta fade em

Chorus: Road Dawgs

You don't want none (Westsiders we riders)
Licks, it's all about stacks and stocks
Max with Glocks
[Mack 10] as my lifetime is tickin
Comin up strong, lickin and flippin chickens

Chorus

[Road Dawgs]
Huh, it be the season for lickin (right)
Much love to my thug niggas and drug dealers
(Hell yeah (nigga) make way)
For the handler hawkin fingers, bell ringers, bringers
On the real, when I stick steel in your grill
With the intent to kill you bout to get your cap peeled
Glock in the hand of a mack, I'm a hundred and jack
Kill for the crack, sell it and steal it right back

Set your mindstate, into murders and po-po
California's ruthless... keep the fo'-fo'
Straight dumpin out a fo'-do'
In the city with the Damu rip, and cholo
G's wearin Polo, doin their 'do low
When I strike, you're stuck, I attack like Cujo
It's do or die for da meanest
In a gang like this nigga, fuck all freaks!

[Mack 10]
Since dope is the game, I guess I found my niche
Got everybody trippin how quick I got rich
First Mack used to struggle, but now it's mo' betta
I got to meet mo' niggas, so I made mo' chedda
Now my whole umbrella check doe like a teller
Went from a quota rock nigga, to a big bird seller
Got the spot straight vacant what's to be made a nigga make it
And what a nigga ain't makin, you best believe a nigga takin

Chorus

[Road Dawgs]
I'm a motherfuckin menace, mashin through Lennox
Up to Venice down in Henny's, chasin it with Guinness
All one, greed in my eyesite stay G'd
And make em bleed nigga what that I like
Gangsta love, slippin on my gloves
Turn into eleven showin they sevens and the dove
Who the Dawgs in your house? Comin through your doors
And your windows, layin niggas out

[Mack 10]
I can see clearly now, let the bullshit fade
Niggas can't paid caught up in the masquerade
So I mash and hoo-ride when it's time to collide
And keep a big fat heater cause it's cold outside
I flash like boo-ya, won't hesitate to DO ya
A nigga like me a straight junkie for MOO-la
One-Oh all about the doe the dividends and the funds
Makin hons pull they guns and fuckin two-one-one's (beyitch!)

[Road Dawgs]
I been exposed to this lavish life gangsta shit
And I suppose I'm 'posed to have a nice major grip
So give it up motherfucker! You got
One more time with that flip mouth then I'm buckin ya
Check it in homey, keys and cash
Don't make me act afool and blast your brains all over that dash
Another bloody situation (Bitch ass nigga!)
Blaowww, I ran out of patience

Chorus 4X

[Mack 10]
Yeahhh, the Road Dawgs, and Mack One-Oh

You don't want none
Nah nigga, you don't want none
(You don't want NONE!)(Treach)
Fuck the toughest I'm danger-ous its rowdy
Motherfuckers are up and outty the roughest sucker plucker since they found me
Openin' up a can of clash clicks six-packs of ass whips, pints
And fifths of asses, burnt to ashes
You've been spined, twisted, blistered and spun up in and lifted
Shit boy ya free paper bum it's called I got connections, like Poonanny to erections
I saw selected sets son for my selection stretchin' sections etchin' and sketchin'
To revive, reset and then set inspections
For the wet ones to the next ones, yes one, step son and get one
Comin' from behind is the line yours for a nine war
Walk nigga mind yours, of crime wars will find yours
The hot one will spot one, shock one and stop one
Crews will conquer as tough as Tonka now I got one

(Chorus)
I got connections, huh, huh, no question, huh
I got connections; I get that ass stuck like glue
I got connections, huh, huh, no question, huh
I got connections; I get that ass stuck like glue --] Method Man

(Road Dawgs)
State of shock, it's a greater plot that made us stop
The thunder from with under will make the whole of cradle rock, hah
Ken Boogie just hit me on the horn in California
Born in Fort July Fourth you're sworn to bangin' and warrin'
Road Dawgs you assume right first draft kick
Practic tactics of a great Western-type saloon fight
Caution - courage what I bring when I approach this
Punks stays focused notice devotions and commotion's of cruddy's corrosive
Top gun and explosive motion East Coastin' deep
Throughout notions of all the shops I'm closin'

(VinRock)
Aiyyo, I play emcees like this I look 'em in the eye I know he's tense
And I break him like a bitch so I know there's no defense
So at night when I creep, only want 'em, while he's awake not asleep
By the way all I seek all I keep, so don't sleep

(Cruddy Click)
Nigga what's the realest?
Rap pillars got the power to blow up spots from here to the Watts Tower
Niggas can feel us, do you wanna deal us?
It be the illest in Naughty it takes a fool to learn that love don't love nobody
My department be collections remember that
Love Child got connections ain't no motherfuckin' question

(Road Dawgs)
I'm deep with a vicious vendetta
Silence prospectors, objectors to my lectures constructed as architecture
Expressions of terror shakin' cold fingers of fear careers I spear
Prepare for a year full of nightmares

(VinRock)
Get 'em back and don't come near me
When appraochin' me come sincerely I don't fear the
Others that don't like that I stack papers, yearly
Merely mentioned men they don't come steppin' to Vin
Anywhere I go, everywhere I flow
I'm bringin' it back home to my twins and I got friends
And friends don't let their friends drive drunk
So I suggest you grab your friends before I go and pop my trunk
And best believe I come correct so yo, WHAT YOU WANNA DO?

(Chorus)
I got connections; I get that ass stuck like glue --] Method Man

Aiyyo what up nigga I here you the man now yo

Intoxication, a million copies in circulation
Just a small indication to let you know Kandi Kain

118, Cruddy Click, Naughty By Nature, the Rottin' Razkals, the Road Dawgs

And if I ain't punchin' and thumpin' I'm stompin'
And kickin'' in nigga take a step back
It ain't even all that nigga catch a cap
If ya don't wanna brawl jack

When me and my click searchin' for trouble to find

No he didn't but I'll you

Hook:

Watch us bring wreck quick
Road Dawgs the next kick
Pluggin' you jugular vein it pour like rain when ya neck whip

235 thick
Ingelwood Illtown click

Low hot off the bricks trot off or get shot off in the mix

Boobie and Luvchild staying trues paying dues

Madmen with ten millimeter heaters sprayin' fools
And slaying crews

Who wanna tangle get caught up and dangled yoked and strangle

In a fight straight soldiers swingin' pipes from every angle

Keep my hand on the nitty Glock fifty
Swift with my tool to lift any fool that wanna fuck with me

Don't sleep on Jersey nor California shit is grimmy trim ya limb
Blood and phlegm is all on him after we warn ya
It's curtains kids certain things we won't allow
Cause that how we stand with ours klickow klickow

Treach:
Word to the mother my mother was the only checkin' mines
So motherfuck your mother's father if he step like mines
Swift kicking cocks I hit spots and blocks
So listen pops then I'll miss you like I miss measles
Mumps plus fuckin' chicken pox
Givin' props to all the Old school that paved the way
Plus zero I fear no hero you think will up and save the day hey
Three letters describing that ass here's a clue
S-C-K the only thing missing is you
Excuse up's excuse um you've yet to lose one two ton
Crews son doing more then leaving bruised gums
Try it riot I'll roll quiet you'll never catch the trap
Cause I ain't the the the that to flap the yap
A black alley cats can catch my back
And to that and these scrap
Back to back wreck to wreck and wreck necks
Of macks fake macks break their necks to say I take that back
You see it used to be a time you rolled with shanks and friends
But nowadays we roll in fuckin' tanks with rims

Cause that's how I stand with mine klickow klickow

Flowin' with that music nigga WON'T YOU USE IT
To your advantage if you could manage the damage
I'm handing when ya get the fuckin' mic it leave ya hands branded

That's secondary I leave ya floatin' like a fuckin' ferry
Advancing my chances and ya retreatin'
From the beatin' ya seekin'
Fuckin' with me and feel your fluids leakin'

On time for too much tough talk
Nigga walk and keep walking
Fore I take ya tongue and make you stop talking

Ha ha ha fag couldn't fuck with a nigga with nine rounds

Nigga catcher as I blast a cop matter capsule shatter scatter midnight

Chorus:
Caps get peeled on the regular, on the regular, on the regular, on the regular
Caps get peeled on the regular, on the regular, on the regular, on the regular

(Verse 2 -Squeak Ru)
Caps get peeled on the regular

The creature that'll beat ya is down [to give em shell ?]

Chorus

(Verse 3 -Squeak Ru)
Niggas better watch they step
I might be the craziest muthafucker you ever met
I retaliate for respect, fuck a wreck
Step and I break yo neck
That's how the fuck I'm comin
Don't get mad if you catch me up in your woman
No love is how you treat a ho
And you bitch made niggas y'all gots to go
That's right, I can't stand it
Ain't enough room for me and you on the planet
Ain't no way for you to top my flow
Squeak Ru from the land of the hunnit spokes, muthafucker

I pledge allegiance to the rag of the United Westside Connection
And the W for which it stands, one neighborhood under god
Y'all know the rest...

Illtown's villian that's wanted for some niggas killin'
Keep my material similar to a serial killer
Peeling cats check my stats ain't no nigga iller

Now here I go with the klick klacks the Tatter rat ta ta tat tats patter
Pat
Pats to better brat packs
I'm airing shit out like DAT
Jack it's judgement day and I'm seenin' is human beings
Got cha fleein' word to me Mook Daddy and Little Steven

Comin' straight form the top notch of hip hop
Niggas gather round to the sound that nigga from the gutta not
Kick that slang talk explain why ya can't walk
It ain't my fault ya hit a flip and couldn't sommersault
I'm on a route with my nigga on some new shit
Flowin' with that music nigga WON'T YOU USE IT
To your advantage if you could manage the damage
I'm handing when ya get the fuckin' mic it leave ya hands branded

Ya backwards ass assborn assbackwards
Coming out feet first and getting drugged into this next verse
On the contrary I'm not ya ordinatry adversary
That's secondary I leave ya floatin' like a fuckin' ferry
Advancing my chances and ya retreatin'
From the beatin' ya seekin'
Fuckin' with me and feel your fluids leakin'

On time for too much tough talk
Nigga walk and keep walking
Fore I take ya tongue and make you stop talking

I'll meet ya at death's gate when a nigga took a step late
Jacked 'em for his place he set up shot in the next state

Yo zapping all the zip zags not that all the zig zag
Shot 'em in the stomach now he's living out a shit bag

Ha ha ha fag couldn't fuck with a nigga with nine rounds
A rugged Cruddy Click from the guttas of Illtown

This ain't a rap along clap along song son my shit is on
With more thong then Janet with her panties on
Ya best to get it out the way boy
The two slickest to ever kick it now klickow klickow

Hook(Verse 1 -Squeak Ru)
It go down, bam
How you like me now
Squeak from the Westside, quick to buck em down
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, here I come
The Fat Man cappin wit the double barrel gun
Niggas better run from the maniac (prisoner ?]
Or I'm gettin ya, folks is straight [???]
And fucked [outta ?] church, now I got ya [restin ?]
And ya best hittin switches in a hearse
Burstin from the brain, this it's insane
Hoo-bang, 45 reasons to make your flesh hang
Sketch ya up to wet ya up
And shoot ya up, what you gon do now, nigga
I got to casket ya
Hit the cut or get the you-know-what
Fool, I'm down to bust cuz I can't get enough
Squeak comin rough and I'm fuckin niggas up, nigga
(Fuckin niggas up, nigga)
Uh, don't you know that...

Chorus:
Caps get peeled on the regular, on the regular, on the regular, on the regular
Caps get peeled on the regular, on the regular, on the regular, on the regular

(Verse 2 -Squeak Ru)
Caps get peeled on the regular
When I fuck around and get hardcore
Nigga, you can't reach my level
I beat the shit out the devil
Witta [shovel ?], fuck a rebel
The suicidal muthafuckin menace
Leavin nuttin but bones and ya skull when I'm finished
You better hide when I hoo-ride
Bustas bringin drama, I'ma loosin off ya chestsize
Wit these hollow point tips
The shit that I'm totin is [???] wit the 50 clip
You can't fade me, nigga tryna daze me
Muthafucker, what's wrong wit you, is you crazy
Fuck wit Squeak that all [she wrote ?]
My family tree ain't shit but killas and cutthroats
That [???] outta the gates and [???]
Ready to bail
The creature that'll beat ya is down [to give em shell ?]

Chorus

(Verse 3 -Squeak Ru)
Niggas better watch they step
I might be the craziest muthafucker you ever met
I retaliate for respect, fuck a wreck
Step and I break yo neck
That's how the fuck I'm comin
Don't get mad if you catch me up in your woman
No love is how you treat a ho
And you bitch made niggas y'all gots to go
That's right, I can't stand it
Ain't enough room for me and you on the planet
Ain't no way for you to top my flow
Squeak Ru from the land of the hunnit spokes, muthafucker

I pledge allegiance to the rag of the United Westside Connection
And the W for which it stands, one neighborhood under god
Y'all know the rest...

ChorusArtist: Mack 10 & Road Dawgs
Album: Caught Up soundtrack
Song: You Don't Want None

Damn Dawg, sure look you ballin
I hit licks nigga
Yeah homey, with that one-oh piece hangin around yo' neck
Whassup?
I hit licks nigga
Eighteen carat on the wrist, double digit style
What's happenin witchu man?
I hit licks nigga
Pushin ?rar-ies?
I told you dog, I hit licks nigga

[Mack 10]
I Inglewood swing like a king, cause my pockets is the fattest
The young presidential nigga with the platinum status
Maniac Mack 10, and I'm callin all hogs
Now who wanna test the Chickenhawk and the Dawgs?
With the fo'-fo' knockin noodles leavin niggas like top ramen
And Dawg I'm dumpin everytime you're even thinkin about bombin
This a jack move blood, hit the deck and that's real
You need to give up your goods or get your punk ass killed

[Road Dawgs]
In this life I'm takin chances servin, slidin plastic
Got bitches walkin out of banks with cash advances
I came up watchin true ballers; no one can school us
I've seen fools go from mule-rs to U-Haul-ers
Stay strapped for the get back; plus I use it
To jack hustlers and kidnappers *woman screaming*
Every since my Dawg died, I put mo' licks in the mix
Another motherfucker hog tied

In the trunk of the Continental (how you do dat)
Trix are for kids, when I'm finished check his dental (check it)
Step up to spit slugs on him, fool stole from me
I had to plug on him (we know his whereabouts)
No more hesitatin, no more debatin no more waitin
We gotta take him, shake him for his Dayton's
Empty the clip and desecrate him, verbatim
(Kill that nigga yo) You hatin, we gotta fade em

Chorus: Road Dawgs

You don't want none (Westsiders we riders)
Licks, it's all about stacks and stocks
Max with Glocks
[Mack 10] as my lifetime is tickin
Comin up strong, lickin and flippin chickens

Chorus

[Road Dawgs]
Huh, it be the season for lickin (right)
Much love to my thug niggas and drug dealers
(Hell yeah (nigga) make way)
For the handler hawkin fingers, bell ringers, bringers
On the real, when I stick steel in your grill
With the intent to kill you bout to get your cap peeled
Glock in the hand of a mack, I'm a hundred and jack
Kill for the crack, sell it and steal it right back

Set your mindstate, into murders and po-po
California's ruthless... keep the fo'-fo'
Straight dumpin out a fo'-do'
In the city with the Damu rip, and cholo
G's wearin Polo, doin their 'do low
When I strike, you're stuck, I attack like Cujo
It's do or die for da meanest
In a gang like this nigga, fuck all freaks!

[Mack 10]
Since dope is the game, I guess I found my niche
Got everybody trippin how quick I got rich
First Mack used to struggle, but now it's mo' betta
I got to meet mo' niggas, so I made mo' chedda
Now my whole umbrella check doe like a teller
Went from a quota rock nigga, to a big bird seller
Got the spot straight vacant what's to be made a nigga make it
And what a nigga ain't makin, you best believe a nigga takin

Chorus

[Road Dawgs]
I'm a motherfuckin menace, mashin through Lennox
Up to Venice down in Henny's, chasin it with Guinness
All one, greed in my eyesite stay G'd
And make em bleed nigga what that I like
Gangsta love, slippin on my gloves
Turn into eleven showin they sevens and the dove
Who the Dawgs in your house? Comin through your doors
And your windows, layin niggas out

[Mack 10]
I can see clearly now, let the bullshit fade
Niggas can't paid caught up in the masquerade
So I mash and hoo-ride when it's time to collide
And keep a big fat heater cause it's cold outside
I flash like boo-ya, won't hesitate to DO ya
A nigga like me a straight junkie for MOO-la
One-Oh all about the doe the dividends and the funds
Makin hons pull they guns and fuckin two-one-one's (beyitch!)

[Road Dawgs]
I been exposed to this lavish life gangsta shit
And I suppose I'm 'posed to have a nice major grip
So give it up motherfucker! You got
One more time with that flip mouth then I'm buckin ya
Check it in homey, keys and cash
Don't make me act afool and blast your brains all over that dash
Another bloody situation (Bitch ass nigga!)
Blaowww, I ran out of patience

Chorus 4X

[Mack 10]
Yeahhh, the Road Dawgs, and Mack One-Oh
Straight up Westside Connect gangbangin to the fullest nigga!
(Tell em Dawg) hahaha
YOU KNOW FOOL! Unfadeable
Dub-S-C-G, you niggas don't want none
(WessSYDE!!)
You don't want none
Nah nigga, you don't want none
(You don't want NONE!)
