[Intro: Eastbound & Down (Kenny Powers)]
The only thing I'm seein' I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins. We gonna have so many fuckin' fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof. Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it
Nigga we made it, aye
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it

[Verse 1: Drake]
She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007 I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!"
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
Imma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"

[Interlude: Kenny Powers]
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show

[Hook: Soulja Boy]

[Verse 2: Drake]
If they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it
If I said it, I meant it, it's no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in yo' face and say "Nigga we made it!"
I swear that we made it, sell out that ting, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no favors
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it!"

[Hook: Soulja Boy]

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
I remember standing in the hood
Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good
Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!
Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, 2 times I crashed
Ha, nigga we made it!
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it
I look a nigga in his face and say "Nigga we made it!"
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters
And these days I don't need no favors
Nigga we made it![Intro:]
You gotta chase your dreams man
I'm above the clouds on a private jet
I got all this designer on me (?)

[Hook:]
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Got all these bricks, get it I'm stackin', I'm packin'
Lil Soulja's too rich
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
To get all these bricks, stack it and flip
Lil Soulja too rich

[Verse 1:]
I'm makin' it rain, yeah I changed the weather
I break it down, put it right back together
Got Louie, Gucci, it's all on my sweater
My niggas winnin' we don't see no contenders
My niggas go hard, my niggas stack millis
I'm swervin', ridin' and I'm drivin' in Bentleys
I'm over in Illi, I'm rockin' it silly
I'm rockin' Fendi and she lookin' like "really?"
Benjis on Benjis while swervin' in Bentleys
We watchin' for the cops, niggas be snitchin'
Got millis on millis, you niggas be silly
We stack it, pack it, stack it up to the ceilin'
I wrap it, package, then I ship it
All of my niggas we get it
All of my niggas we kill it
Catch the case then quit it
Niggas get acquitted, got money cause we got no limits
I'm trappin' and cappin', had to make it happen
All of my niggas we swervin' in Phantoms
My diamonds dancin' just like Tony Montana
I take a trip from Brazil to Atlanta
I come out the water, got bricks like a boulder
They comin' in, nigga tell me your order
My niggas get money, I swerve in a foreign
And the coupes with the paint and the spoiler
Valet park that Bugatti, I'm winnin'
My niggas stackin', they got millis on millis
I'm runnin' bands, I'm the man in my city
I'm gettin' money, niggas hatin' like really
I'm gettin' money, niggas ain't fuckin' with me
I'm gettin' mili, I got mili on mili
I stack it, pack it up to the ceilin'
I'm gettin' money, niggas know that I'm killin'
A mili, a mili, I did it, I did it
My niggas stackin', ya my niggas they with it
We stackin' money, we got milis on milis
We swervin', ridin', and we drivin' in Bentleys
My niggas talk and ya my niggas get it
All of you niggas you gotta get it
All of my niggas we got to get it
Used to trap out the bank with 20 pounds of midgets
20 pounds of midget, that's what I'm trappin'
No cappin' had to make my momma happy
I got Louie, Gucci, now they look at me funny
They say Soulja Boy you get all of this money
Them niggas hated cause I'm hot as the sun
Soulja strapped with the automatic gun
Fuckin' the 100s, I don't do the ones
Breakin' bricks down to cookies and crumbs

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
I'm the one that they see up
Ice all over me, yup
Hit the bank with some freeze up
You might see me on your street, yup
In the club and the VIP, yup

[Hook 4X][Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
I ain't lookin' back, nigga
I'mma douchebag to these pussy ass niggas
Hammer in my draws but I nail yo bitch
Blunts like fingers, I'm bout to make a fist
Everybody die, gon' bury me alive
Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
Pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'mma sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her yo ex
Better turn to God, 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea
Muthafucka it's on, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone
I'll have a broke muthafucka run in ya home
For a crumb and a bone and put one in ya dome

[Hook]
One in ya dome. [x8]
Empty stomach, full clip
I'm gon' get it Gon' get it [x2]
My trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin'

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
You ain't gon hurt nobody like Kid 'n Play
Ain't nun sweet but the codeine nigga
Eyes hella red like chlorine in 'em
I was gettin' that pussy, I was gettin' that money
Long hair, don't care, Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Too high to take a breath, too high to take a step
Two rights don't make a wrong, three rights, make a left
The cops on my dick, the feds on my nerves
I walk it like I talk it, got legs on my words
If she don't suck dick, I don't give her that dick
Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch
Money is the issue, full court pressure
I like my blunt, Nutty Professor
I'mma straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying hatorade by the twelve pack.
Like two stomachs
I'm laced up like two shoes, miss goody
Keep that ratchet nigga
Trigger finger itchin', I'll scratch you nigga
Blow yo fuckin' brains out in traffic nigga
Got green, New Orleans, St. Patrick nigga
One bitch on the whip, one on the phone
The one on the phone, is in front of ya home
She 'bout to run in ya home, and put one in ya dome

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Soulja Boy]
Rest in peace to the game cause I'm fresh to death
Rest in peace to the game, tell 'em kill theyself
Make your deathwish, cause I'm too fresh
Cuse I'm fresh to death, cause I'm fresh to death
You go broke tryna get fresh like this
Rest in peace to the game cause I killed it
I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death
What you talkin', I came out a coffin

[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne]
I just can't see myself, living in a house of mirrors
I bought me a double R, cuz I went from rags to riches
And these niggas nag like bitches
Actin' like little fags like Richard
And all of my bitches be bad as vision
You gotta problem I can fix it like a mathematician
I ammunition, call me ammo for short
Trukfit shirt, camo the shorts
Ya girl is a freak, ya man is a narc
Put your son in your arms or put one in your dome[Produced by Soulja Boy]

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Soulja Boy on the beat

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh, bitch!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lay on the bed, open that twat
I French kiss that pussy, like muah
Sit on my face, M-U-A-H
Before I eat that pussy, I say my grace
Girl I'm nastier than him, I don't know why you still with him
Beat that pussy, go to sleep, she got that Tylenol P.M
Fuck that bitch until she tired, 'til she tired like a rim
Give her head like a brim, it tastes good, M-M-M
Pussy monster in her closet, full of surprises
I give full body massages, I hope that pussy smell like a violet
I hope that pussy warmer than luke and sweet as Godiva
Suck this dick and swallow that nut and call it Penis colada
Lift up that mini-skirt, that's my dinner desert
She fell in love with the Martian, I said you too down to Earth
Man, these hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
Down here waiting for her to come like payday
Hoping this juice is sweeter than baked cake
She say it's for Tunechi, she lie with a straight face
But I'm trying to eat healthier, so I ate a veggie
Sucked on that pussy, I feel better already
She say "Tunechi go slower" and Tunechi went faster
My tongue is a motor, my dick is a NASCAR
Whipped cream on that pussy, dickhead like a bullet
If her hair real I'mma pull it, hope that ass feel like a cushion
I give her wood when we wouldn't? I hope that pussy tastes like pudding
And I get that ho the boot, hold up, let me put my foot in (Tunechi)
Got a sweet tooth, candy yam pussy
I'mma leave that ass smoking like a Amsterdam tourist man
These hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Trina]
Lay on that bed, open your mouth
This pussy so clean like soap in your mouth

If that dick like a tree watch me build a treehouse
Ok, the baddest bitch in this bitch, got the fattest clique in this bitch
You might drown, you better start doggy paddling in this bitch
I'm Trin, B nigga? Queen nigga, sleep in this pussy, dream nigga
I stay on that dick like a fucking balance beam nigga
Hair pull, neck grab, don't fuck with hoes that backstab
Don't fuck with niggas that ain't got shit, if I fucked a nigga then that's my dick
My mouth a jacuzzi, my pussy a safe place
Fuck me 'til daybreak, then you can go skate, TrinaBaby you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you tonight

We back, its prime time rapping
Let's get into it over here man
We got the champion, Mr. Legendary himself, he don't lose
The only thing he do is win
Give it up for Supa Hot Fire!
Now, over here, we got Soulja Boy
But let's get to my boy right here, alright

[Verse 1: Supa Hot Fire]
You beating me? Now that's a mistake
When I park my car, I pull up the e-brake
You hear that? I'm buzzin';
Big family, no cousins
I get money. It's nothin'

Twelve job applications, all blank: I'm lazy
Two baby sitters, no babies
I spit hot fire, but I'm not a rapper
I come with the Supa Hot
And then bring the fire right after!

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Supa Hot Fire, I don't know what the fuss about
I splash on you everyday, I bet that put your fire out
King of the internet; I been that
Winning streaks; I end that
Looking through your glasses
I can see that you been wack
SIKE! You ain't going to get these back!
You know my name? (Ya, it's Soulja Boy Tell 'em)
He's a liar
Tattoos, diamonds, swag
Call me Soulja Hot Fire
Don't you get mad, this is just the beginning
Swag to the right, now go tell them fans I'm winning
Soulja Boy Tell 'em came through for the top spot
Take this picture; hashtag Soulja just beat Supa Hot

It's hard to see, Supa Hot, he lost man
We got a new champion- this is
Crazy
I ain't coming back. It's all over
That's prime time rapping.   [Produced by Boi-1da, Frank Dukes, Nineteen85 & Noah "40" Shebib]

Walking through the hood, everybody notice me[Soulja Boy]
I did what I wanted, niggas did what they could
A lion wouldn’t cheat but a Tiger would
I only keep real niggas in my stable
A million dollar chain, I’m feeling like Gucci’s label
So icey I really don’t care
Haters green as a pool table and they twice as square
Had to cut a couple bitches, them niggas need stitches
I’m getting money out the tree y’all niggas getting switches
Similar to Nas, I need a mic though
Chop the bread up, Tae Kwon Do
They pass me the game like Tom Brady
These rappers chances looking slim just like shady

[Verse 2]
Niggas locked behind my bars Im taking out prisoners
Sit back relax recieving my residual
Think this song is dope sh–t wait til you see the visual
Please brace yourself this shit about to get critical
Let it be known I got rappers on my hit list
I got so many gifts you would swear I stole Christmas
Word to the Grinch bitch my style will switch quick
I knew this all along I was waiting just to hit the kill switch
Since day one man your boy been the truth
Broke so many records like I’m in the glass booth
Like I’m in the glass studio breaking out barriers
Back when crime mob was screaming Ellenwood Area
Nigga I ain't scared of ya, never ever will be
I’m screaming I’m the best till these rappers kill me
Make the people feel me like the blind men do
On your girl, head so much, like her favourite shampoo
I’m travelling where I want, soulja’s vacation
My mind is so free, emanicapation proclamation
Im so hot, haters evaporating
6 bitches on my dick I’m elimidating
Im high every friday just like smokey
Im spitting real shit, these niggas spitting Karaoke
Hit stick with the flow just like Madden
Im so high on my carpet feeling like Alladin
I spit hot flames bitch just like a dragon
And my pants saggin
Spell it backwards niggas
Niggas get heated when they see the coupe on
I dont give a fuck got my Pyrex suit on
I’ma keep rapping til the fans hear the best of me
Im cooking up the game bitch yeah I got the recipe
You ain't gotta like me just please respect it
Hip hop is dead nigga let me resurrect it
Microphone check it, uno, dos, tres
I’ma keep spitting til they crown me the best
The rap games a mess, let me clean it up
Its a pigsty they going ham give it up

[Verse 3]
Flying down the highway a million on the dashboard
You can't start my car up unless you got the password
I’m something like a prophecy spit so properly
When my album drops watch how many rappers copy me
Haters opinions are obsolete
Don’t make pop music so it ain’t no pop in me
And my brains a bitch where she at when I need her
Ya pack nines, I pack nine kilometers
Ya did’nt want beef why would ya start it
Cannons flashing like you walking down the red carpet
First you was nameless now I'mma make you famous
Hit you with the stainless and leave your ass brainless
Best rapper…
[End][Hook]
Thirty thousand, hundred million
All my niggas go so crazy in this fucking building

They wanna threesome, then some
Spend whatever come in, fucking income
Me and my niggas we're never going broke
And you, have to, do it all
Just to know where it get to
Living dreams we can never afford
Now we sitting in the backseat
Backseat [x17]

[Verse - Soulja Boy]
I got tattoos all over me, and she fuck with that
I pull up in foreign whips, and she fuck with that
A boss nigga, all the lame niggas copy cat
I pull up in that phantom, and she in that jag
Tattoos all up on my chest, on my neck and back
I'm getting money sipping lean, nothing but act
A million dollars, that's nothing but taxes
I ball out everyday, I don't know how to act
I'm dropping the top on my 'rari
They stare at me when I'm in the party
I said "baby we made it", she said "baby we did"
I'm stunting on these fuck niggas, they know what it is
Now we in the backseat, turning up
And she high off the kush, we burning up
She roll one and smoke it, and we rolling
You already know, you know how this shit go

[Outro - The Weeknd]
