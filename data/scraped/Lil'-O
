[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Got plenty cheese plenty carats, man we looking like some caterers
And its looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that trunk be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
I still represent H-Town, the city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars but they don't understand it
They say the never seen ya boy out here gettin his grind on
Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Yeh this the city thats slow, the city thats thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
And sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This Clutch City but we play what we delt
Reppin the H-Town

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Paul Wall]
Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north
I'm talking Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall wat it do baby

[Verse 6: Yung Redd]
(Heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)
Purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Stay blowin down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunny Side
I could walk these streets if I was blind, nahmtawkinbout?
Yung Reedd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate swear to God I was a jewler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute
MAYNE!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lil Keke]
H-O to the U-S, T-O to the N
God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunny Side and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rolling up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hiding
Don Ke' heart of the south, slab riding

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it cause there's not a product we dont push
We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touching it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Welcome to H-Town, this 3rd Ward talking
Coming down the slab line the fo's crip walking
Together we stand, divided we fall, yeah
North and the south together we ball
Fuck that, nigga its a H-Town thang
Lemme see ya touch the sky if ya feeling me mayne
Its Boss Hogg Corleone, nigga that Mike D
The drank man daddy, you know where to find me

[Verse 10: Big Pokey]
State to state dawg, I got em jockin the kid
6' backin out the driveway, dropping the wig
Yall know we do it big, like a freightliner rig
Got stashes full of cash where I keep the money hid
Fresh to death homie, how I came in the do'
Prada shades on, smelling like a swanger of dro
Put'cha H'es up, represent'cha city bro
Counting money, iced out, like I'm in a video

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Rob G]
(Talking) Southwest put'cha dubs up baby, let's go!
Now welcome to the place I love, place I was raised to be a G
It's straight hang with thugs, jam my music slow and hold my H's up
Southwest SWAT I know the real dudes that move birdies
I go to school early, baby blue Moon jersey
Riding around, southwest side of my towm
Still Reppin' My Block, How Ya Likin Me Now
Its from Sharpstown, Braeswood to Alief
Black and Latins stacking paper together we stay deep
It's Rob G!

[Verse 12: Trae]
Cheyah!
King of the Streets and I'm roll around Houston ridin 4's
Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin it like a platinum Rolls
Suicide make the door presidential when they decide to close (real talk)
They want the throne but tell the haters that I got it locked (got it locked)
I shoot em on the west so whatever all they way to the block (doors up)
I'm so hood it be the true definition of me
Ain't no way speak about the H, without mentioning me
Tha Truth, nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Lil O]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ay I'm from H-Town, southwest stop drop and roll

Braaeswood, Woolfair, Clull Creek, Spice Lane
West Bellville, Fondren Airport, Sandpiper, stack change
I'm so H-Town there's codeine in my blood
And I done shout it out at war with with the meanest of thugs
And you ain't never gotta ask if there's lean in my cup
I'm a triple O.G., S.U.C. nigga what
Its Lil O Homie

[Verse 14: Pimp C]
Now I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, 90 miles away
For the last 15 years, I been reppin my state
I knew the real DJ Screw sip grape by the case
Eight's over ice straight product of the H
Southside, I never was no big socializer
With Bun you can talk, I fuck with the boss
Like Thug and Prince Silvia Rome or Wrice
This game a pie I dont want it all I just need a slice

[Hook][Hook: Z-Ro & Lil O]
I can't leave drank alone
It got me feening
Feeling like a boss
While I'm flippin' through my hood
I can't leave drank alone
You got a nigga feening
(Ain't even goin to lie this drank gots me feeling
Like I'm walking on the sky)

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Yall would think that with 3 felony cases
I would leave drank alone
I'm still out on bond
And ima keep dranking till all the drank is gone
Damn right I'm high as the sky be
Over g4 and g5 that's where I be
And then it's back to reality
Cuz I could hear the sirens
Woot woot dam HPD right behind me
I got a little weed and a pint and a half
But thanks to don I got a stash spot
And since my doctor wrote me this prescription
Ain't no body got to bail my ass out
Still rolling in that three-double-o
With my name in my grille on top of 'fours
And I'm in love with mary jane and codeine
I don't love these hoes
I can remember my first cup, oh I was so in love
So when I wake up in the morning
Before I brush my teeth I'm pouring up
Lil momma you a dime piece
But I'll fuck you up if you touch my cup
Cuz it ain't cheap as it used to be
And this one cost 350 bucks
Me and dj screw poured up a pint
On my twenty second birthday
And that day was a monday
But a nigga didn't wake up until thursday
I handle my business
So I think I deserve to get throwed
So I'ma Barre Baby now just like my nigga Big Moe

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil O]
Sippin on the ski taste
Heading to the weed place
This boys think they ball baby
They should see what we waste
Some pints of that drank
Zips of the dro
Cup so muddy
Told your bitch to hit it slow
Top down on 59
You know I'm tippin slow
I could hear HAWK sayin
(Mayne your trippin o
Slow your ass down mayne)
But me I'm like fuck it
I got money in my pocket and
Tonight it's going down
Cuz you know I like sipping
On that purple stuff
Purple kush in my bong
Till the purple cross
And the babies in the city
Won't flirt with us
Five kilos ima take
To put in work for us
With some down side busters
We gon stay pouring up
Ask about O mayne
I stay showing up
If I see 2 litres
I gotta 4' it up
If you wanna ride with money
Then you better ride with us
Cuz we be sippin on big drank daily
Yelling to the haters fuck you baby
Lil o and ro we don't play G

[Hook]*Chorus* (Big Moe) 2x
Hey heeeeeyyy take it from a pro take it from a proooo

A pro

(Mr.3-2)
Now player never sweat these hoes
Spittin game at them while i'm riding on vouges
Had to kick the does like a broad a  talking
Broads love the way this big boss be flossing
Now see 99 I let a ho be a ho
They wan't leave me alone keep calling my prime co
See I like her and she see the drop
Just cause your baby daddy on lock
My game don't stop some of these broads be scraping
Running around saying she pregnant with my baby
Wanting to be my lady put her pack in my mercedes
For the year two tripple O mann these bopper can't fade me
And lately I been knocking them out by the dozen
Her her sister and her fine lil cousin
All in the same peep these broads are freaks
Better keep a condom on and leave these broads in the street

*Chorus* (Big Moe)2x

(Lil' O)
I don't trick to hoes it's Big Dick to hoes
Face down ass up with their kits exposed
Bust a nut wash my dick grab my shit then go
Then I tell them let the mother suckers get your clothes
Then I slide out the doe cause i'm raw like that
Scratch out in the lex cause I ball like that
But I ain't trippin cause I know the way I talk my back
That she can't wait for a playa just to call her back
Then I hit the club ballin with a bad attitude
Hoes like who you think you is i'm like bitch who is you

And baby all you broads beneath me like you under my shoe
Cause I know the playa rules and bite boppers ankles off with gator Shoes and

Da fat rat wit the cheese make me front the public crew you know what We gon

*Chorus* (Big Moe)2x

(Big Hawk)
Every thangs looking lovely champaine caviare sipping bubbley
And I can what you hoes thinking of me
Cause the girls the girls the girls they love me want to rub me
But yall ugly they just love a man
Take a second hoodrat and give her eye contact
After all that i'm in the kiddie kat
You knock FAT PAT whole up on all that
Drop the chit chat back back back back
Serve them like a mama give them baby semilac
These hoes just wanna get sexual
With this squad devernaire intellectual
After sexual on their chance to paper
And all my ex bitches yea they got that paper
Paper chaser bad thug heart breaker
Is it me you love or is it my navigator
Perpatrator I don't carry a wallet
After I break a bitch college why cry for knowlege
So you're just another caught up as ho
Trying to play pro as you got no doe fo shoe

*Chorus*  till fade(Big Moe)
Oooooh, yeeeeeah
Take it from a thug, take it from a thug

[Hook: Big Moe - 2x]
Thug niggas, never sweat these hoes
Cause playas, always get chose
So you don't gotta trick, your do'
If you real you gon hit playa, take it from a pro

[Mr. 3-2]
Now playas, still don't sweat these hoes
Spitting conversation, while I ride deuce-4's
You know's how I do, I get paid off a trick
Changed my name from Mr. 3-2, to Pimp Chris
I ain't ya suga daddy, like Willie Fu-Fu
2003, girls got on they choosing shoes
Keep my pockets paid, my Harley got sprayed
They breaking they toes, to keep daddy living laid
Playa made, from the bottom to the top
Making boys drop out, 'fore them panties drop
I hopped in this pimping, cause girls love a playa
Do anything I say, and come back with that thay-ar
With no problem, or harassment at all
That's why when I'm in the mall, we all gon ball
Gucci for them, and a mink for me
Baby playas get chose, it ain't hard to see

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
I don't grab they arms, I don't pinch they ass
These hoes know, when they see a young nigga with cash
Cleaner than a motherfucker, like I just took a bath
So when these hoes walk by, how the fuck can they pass
A nigga like me up, she know that it's real
Plus I'm from Big Ballin' Texas, she know that I'm trill
And she heard that I can fuck, she wanna know how it feel
I'ma take her to me bedroom, and show her my skills
Cause I'm a playa that get chose, it's my call of duty
And I wage war with cot, and I brawl with booty
And this message goes out to, all my cuties
That I done beat the pussy up, and put all them movies
Had the time of your life, girl your nigga's a G
And you always gon call me, cause your nigga's a flea
And everytime you go to sleep, boo you dreaming bout me
Cause deep down I'm everything, you want your nigga to be
A gangsta a gentleman, plus I talk with class
But I'll still bend you over, and walts that ass
Pull your perm acting out, once I'm talking trash
Like baby who pussy this, pop-pop that ass

[Hook - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
Everything's, still lovely
I'm on drank, I done chilled off the Bubbly
Niggas mad, cause they hoes wanna fuck me
But these boys, these boys they bet not touch me if you ugly
Boys wondering why, they hoes be fiending
Cause they done licked on my nuts, and swallowed my semen
Hoes be dreaming, of having sex with me
And these jealous ass niggas, got plex with me
See girls get full of that, extasy
And they all wanna fuck me, O and 3
Since I'm the H-A-W-K, I'm doing things my way
I fucked her and her, and your fiance
Your girl was bootylicious, just like Beyonce
And your niggas wanna be like me, someday
No how no way, can he do this
And how many hoes, out there suck dick

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Moe]
Take it from a pro, baby
3-2 and Lil' O, baby
H.A.W.K. and Big Moe, baby
Take it from a pro - 2x(*talking*)

Light it up, roll it up
Throwed as a dyke nigga, smoke it up
If you gonna drank nigga, po' it up
Man I'm feeling good, let's get fucked up

[Lil' O]
I'm fresh off, probation
So I bought me, some inhalation
To celebrate this, pimp occasion
It's going down, no time for waiting
Call the drank man, bring me a pint
And I don't even drink drink, but I'm drinking tonight
Went straight to the sto' and I bought me a Sprite
Told the chink ring me up, I need plenty of ice
It's time to get fucked up, and I ain't playing
Got my cigarillo white up, know I'm saying
No plex, we just straight parlaying
It's a gangsta party it's on me, so nobody's paying
So smoke and choke, drink what you want
But don't be no roach nigga, pass the blunt

Man you ain't got to front, enjoy yourself

[Hook]
Light it up, roll it up
Throwed as a dyke, nigga smoke it up

Man let's get fucked up, (fucked up)
Fucked up (fucked up), fucked up

[H.A.W.K.]
Man I'm feeling good, just left the hood
And smoked some good, now the point is understood
Light it up, roll it up
I'm getting fucked up, in my pick-up truck
Like the big bad wolf, I'll huff and puff
And huff and puff, till my lungs about to bust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I follow it up, with a cup of purple stuff
And ooh-wee, I'm on a P-I-N-T
L-E-A-N-I-N-G
The blunt is lit, I'm smoking like a barbecue pit
And aw shit, here come that roaching bitch
(how can I hit the weed), bitch please
This that good shit, that grow on trees
No sticks no seeds, so I had to trip
What you got on the weed, she said (my lips) I let her hit

[Hook]

[Big Pokey]
I'm feeling dizzy right now, my buzz just snuck up
I'm trying to get like the economy, fucked up
I stay doped up, like everyday
On this seedless weed, and the Grand Mane
I don't play, gotta do what the song say
Kick back, and grab my weed tray
Ay, I gotta twist some'ing up
This the City of Syrup, I gotta mix some'ing up
I stay fixed up, cause I love the feeling
Get high, like the cost of living when I'm chilling
Three wheeling, when I raise it up
Layed back parlaying, when I blaze it up
Don't make me, purple haze it up
I'm bout to leave the boat with a fo', and a cajun slut
It's really all gravy brah, on the real
Willo, let em know the deal

[Hook]

(*talking*)
Are y'all fucked up (yeah), well alright now
On the count of three, I want y'all to repeat after me
One, two, three...

[Dannie Marie]
Light it up, roll it up
Don't hesitate, nigga smoke it up
If you got the drank, nigga po' it up
Man I'm feeling good, let's get fucked up
Fucked up, fucked up
Man let's get fucked up, fucked up, fucked up(*talking*)
Boss Hogg Outlaws, street millionaires
You know we getting this street money, shit
Whether it's weed, ki's or c.d.s
Trying to get it with the M-O's
Now Slim hit em where it hurt (ha)

[Slim Thug]
The trunk open boppers scoping, but don't watch me
I'm shotgun with Sleepy, watching eight TV's
Right behind that Chi-Town, and we headed to Cali
Popping candy blue do's, on a thoed Denali
Riding like we in a rally, candy coats crawl spokes
Live like rich white folks, and float million dolla boats
I spend six hundred c-notes, to decorate my throat
And got a mansion house snow, with the dope to smoke
Whole lifetime from being broke, my grand kids gon ball
I bought a car by the bar, and still knock down the mall
A young Hogg is what I'm called, when I step in the place
Cause when I step up in the place, my diamonds up in your face
Staying on a paper chase, so I'm shaking the leaves
I proceed to block bleed, cause getting green is what I need
The Re-Rolex Times, and sip the moet wine
Boss Hogg boys blind, when it's time to shine ha

[Hook - 2x]
We read Rolex Times, and sip the moet wine
Not a Cash Money brother, but I know how to shine
Start up my rhymes, and now my diamonds glare
I'm a self made, full paid street millionaire

[Lil' O]
I ain't never been a roach, on a leash or side kick
Like these other bitch niggas that's broke, and ride dick
How the fuck you boys only sell dope, to buy kicks
No wonder how I glow, and hop out the fly six
I'm a street millionaire, cause I mash the gas
And watch you other boys flash, how I stash my cash
I'm known for wrecking boys face, mash they ass in half
When I pull up in the drop top, Jag on glass
I'm on my note, princess cuts on my throat
Plus you can tell by the soft mink, on my coat
And watch you boys on the block, I'm on the boat
Getting head from a red, that give the longest strokes
I keeps it real, I'm all about eating meals
I don't hang with nan nigga, that ain't seeking mills
Till he's on the pay roll, and they keep a steal
I make a call, boys getting hit with heat then chill, for real

[Hook]

[E.S.G.]
Now we balling in the Bentley, big bodies and Benzes
The way my twenties spin, they go clean to the dentist
'Fore my son turn one, I hang with 2001's
Eddie Bauer car seats, so me and him can have fun
Talking stocks and bonds, public seeing my dones
Super charged Impala, pop my collar like the Fonz'
Ten karats on my teeth, then the karats on my charm
Add the karats on my arm, that's more than a rabbit farm
I got Phat Farm, but I don't need a outfit
Talking bout the Texas rent, cost two point six
Street rich four point six, Range Rover for winter
In the summer catch me gunning, platinum leather on the list
Chrome on Bentley and the Benz, sick my light on the mirror
For the wife birthday, two thousand at the galleria
If my diamonds were more clear, I'd line the palaya
Now it's time to thank us, for buying Texas a stadium

[Hook - 2x][Chorus - 2x]
All, you fake ass hoes
Y'all need to leave, leave me alone

[Tiny-T]
You hoes out there still playin games
You niggas let'em do it so yo ass to blame
When it gets out of hand you want to kill a bitch
Long time ago should have stopped the shit
She give you some pussy and you let her slid
Run more game give her the keys to the ride
She picked a nigga up
Sucked a nigga nuts
I came in her mouth cause I don't give a fuck
A bitch like that can't mess with me
Peep game off the top it's the Tiny-T
Fake ass hoes, I spot them quick, break they ass, and feed them dick
Other than that they don't get shit
Man I can't stand no messy bitch
Fucking up my high when I'm in my zone
Fake ass hoes please leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone, fake ass hoes please leave me alone
Better leave me alone
Cock suckin bitches better leave me alone

[Chorus - 2x]

[H.A.W.K]
I make hoes, and break hoes, and take all they pecos
Fake hoes I hate those, I do my best to shake those
Hey trick, yea you bitch, shut-up and eat dick
No bra and fake tits and still waiting on W.I.C
Y'all, better leave me alone and listen to the words that I say in this song
Fake ass hoes get nothing from me
Not one red C-E-N-T
And if you think you gone get some cash
I got a trick for your ugly ass
And if you want a piece of H-A-W-K
Pull out your pocketbook you gots to pay
And all I want from you is a little head
Suck a nigga dry and get the hell out my bed
Cause fake hoes with fake hair, Coogie all on wellfair
Sit your ass down somewhere
Cause real playas don't care

[Chorus - 2x]

[Lil O]
Hey I see you over there baby lickin your lips
I'm diging your hips
Looking like chicken, watermelon,and grits
I want to hit but you still won't tell me shit
Cause you only wanna holla cause you know I got some chips
But guess what I ain't shit either
I'm just trying to find out if you a dick eater
I ain't even gonna lie try to mislead ya
Baby girl after Lil O nut I'm gone scratch like a swift cheater
I'll holla, you broke as hell
You don't cook, you don't clean, mama what the hell
No job, crib looking like a roach motel
Hey holla at me later I'm with my gal
Another words you get no green
I tell you that I'm broke, but everytime you see Lil O, I'm so clean
I'm a nice guy by no means
I got these broads talking bout, girl Lil O is so mean

[Chorus - 4x](*talking*)
These niggas gon bleed, pass me the weed
These niggas gon bleed

[Hook: Big Pokey]
These niggas gon bleed, I just hit em with that thang and it freeze
Good that I did my deed, so pass me the weed
So I could slay, another MC
These niggas, ain't fucking with me

[Lil' O]
I represent the born in killers, from the land of the trillest
Drug dealers thug niggas, who specialize in kidnapping squealers
Gat concealers, drillers for scrilla through outfed gorillas
We bust back with bazookas, just to make sure they feel us
Like Attila the Hun, killers with guns leaving you numb
Loving nothing, but bitches and funds
Give me your ones, for fun you'll get annihilated
Pull the nickle fine plated, both his eyes dilated
Yeah the Southside made it, how you love that
I know you niggas hate it, but you can't fuck with that
Lil' O, better known as Fat Rat with the cheese
Triggas squeeze, on all the South's enemies with ease

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
I hit your block like Jeffrey Dommer, eat a nigga ass up
And what click you claim, I could give a fat fuck
You touch my fast bucks, I'm at your front do'
Quicker than a fast nut, with that blast and that buck
Rob-rob murder-murder, killer cap peeler
Slug feeler hit list, dump a nigga in the ditch hit
You bitches it's bidness, you know I'm saying
So when you see me out the roof, cause you know what I'm spraying
And you know where I'm aiming, I proceed at your toes
And I make my foes fall, like wars at Jericho
Get greedy with calicoes, jaw breakers and body blows
Flying feet to the nose, multiple bullet holes
Like a heroin overdose, or too much cocaine in your nose
I got that heart stopper flow, the chart topper glow
So start with Lil' O, best believe I draw heat
A monster mind shit, bitch it's all about me

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
Ain't no discussing, we issue concussions for nothing
Redrumming like Russians, hitting boys like percussion for thinking that we bluffing
Cause it ain't nothing, to get these triggas crushing
Niggas rushing for they shit, but it's too late they got hit
Try the Glock greeders, certified block bleeders
Heavyweights from Texas state, smuggle top flight cheeba
In the drop top beamer, with a top notch diva
Thugged out diamonds shining, with my hand on my heater
These niggas act like senoritas, so I slap them all
And I know it breaks your heart, that I'm back to ball
But the fact of it all, is that I still won't stop
From this day forth, the rap game is now locked[Hook: Z-Ro & Lil O]
I can't leave drank alone
It got me feening
Feeling like a boss
While I'm flippin' through my hood
I can't leave drank alone
You got a nigga feening
(Ain't even goin to lie this drank gots me feeling
Like I'm walking on the sky)

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Yall would think that with 3 felony cases
I would leave drank alone
I'm still out on bond
And ima keep dranking till all the drank is gone
Damn right I'm high as the sky be
Over g4 and g5 that's where I be
And then it's back to reality
Cuz I could hear the sirens
Woot woot dam HPD right behind me
I got a little weed and a pint and a half
But thanks to don I got a stash spot
And since my doctor wrote me this prescription
Ain't no body got to bail my ass out
Still rolling in that three-double-o
With my name in my grille on top of 'fours
And I'm in love with mary jane and codeine
I don't love these hoes
I can remember my first cup, oh I was so in love
So when I wake up in the morning
Before I brush my teeth I'm pouring up
Lil momma you a dime piece
But I'll fuck you up if you touch my cup
Cuz it ain't cheap as it used to be
And this one cost 350 bucks
Me and dj screw poured up a pint
On my twenty second birthday
And that day was a monday
But a nigga didn't wake up until thursday
I handle my business
So I think I deserve to get throwed
So I'ma Barre Baby now just like my nigga Big Moe

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil O]
Sippin on the ski taste
Heading to the weed place
This boys think they ball baby
They should see what we waste
Some pints of that drank
Zips of the dro
Cup so muddy
Told your bitch to hit it slow
Top down on 59
You know I'm tippin slow
I could hear HAWK sayin
(Mayne your trippin o
Slow your ass down mayne)
But me I'm like fuck it
I got money in my pocket and
Tonight it's going down
Cuz you know I like sipping
On that purple stuff
Purple kush in my bong
Till the purple cross
And the babies in the city
Won't flirt with us
Five kilos ima take
To put in work for us
With some down side busters
We gon stay pouring up
Ask about O mayne
I stay showing up
If I see 2 litres
I gotta 4' it up
If you wanna ride with money
Then you better ride with us
Cuz we be sippin on big drank daily
Yelling to the haters fuck you baby
Lil o and ro we don't play G
For real

[Hook]Lil' O and [Big Moe] 2x each

And another one
[And another one]

Chorus [Big Moe] 2x
Get back Get back
All you haters trying to get my stash [trying to get my stash]
Step back Step back

Verse 1 [Lil' O]
Niggas want to x out O like tic tac toe
Cause I'm the type of cat that get that doe
Get them bricks
Hit the streets grind hard and get that six
Them broads try to fuck i'll get that bitch
I'll get her skirt
I'm not the big tymers but I got that work
And when I hop out in a bentley then its got to hurt
I drop the top on you boys until the dances shirt
I'm fat rat with da cheese main
What you know about going over seas main
Blowing trees and the bricks pushing v's main
Me and Moe we ain't tripping its a g thang
You got to love it Ipushed and shoved it just to get in the doe
Thats like I pushed and shoved just it just to get in your ho
To the boys talking bout you gon wet Lil' O
So I ain't playin games no moe
And thats for real

[Chorus]

Verse 2 [Big Moe]

As I sank back to the days of struggle
Life has been tussle but I always had a hussle
Sippin gallons of tussen Ain't no time for discussion
All theses hatas mad cause they gals be lusting
And my gator on buttons popped up blowing doz{doza}
Foe foe in my lap make her drop and hit the floor
B-i-g- M-o-e feel me
Heavyweighting and regulating all through South c
Boujer to concrete brang us the noochie
Everybody knew me as I wrecked on screw beats ohh wee
We came to far to set back
Get back I pull out my nine and wet back

[Chorus]

Verse 3 [H.A.W.K.]

Back Back playa raise up off me
Shit that a stick is hotter than a cup of coffee
Your mistakes a cost me when you messing with my stash
Sixteen[16] get crush if we're on the same track
How you feel about that it's not fiction or fact
When I add or subtract comes back plus tax
Your minor setback leads to major combat
Improper contact leads to mortal combat
Hole in your starter hat and your skull gets cracked
Now I walked all on you like you're a doormat
Two hataz I break half squash yall chit chat
If your patna is real he'll never turn his back
I know this for a format add needs to teachings
Mess with my stash and you gon be a quadrule preaching
You better belive it don't mess with my fade
Or you gon to feel the wrath of the H.A.W.K

[Chorus] 3x(*talking*)
Chow time, chow time
Everybody line up for chow, chow time
Line up for chow, line up for chow

[Hook: Z-Ro & (Lil' O) - 2x]
I got dreams, of being a king
(But right now, I'm living unhealthy
Since I'm balling, as I say to myself)
But everything ain't what it seems
(I'm praying, asking God for some help
When I get out, I'll be back for my wealth
It can't rain forever)

[Lil' O]
But dear Lord, change the weather
Cause these scars and these bars, make my pain make pleasure
And I'm a long far away, from everything that I treasure
All because, I was chasing this cheddar
But in my dream I was a king, but nothing ever comes to a dreamer
So I turned to a hustler, block bleeder and schemer
Daddy noticed something different, bout my gangsta demeanor
But he never, could just point the finger
But now he know, cause I'm locked up now
No more Benz with the roof, popped up now
I do my laundry in the toilet, and it's stopped up now
Boys think it's some pussy jacking off, when a female guard walk thru now
My life is a shame, but nigga doing time is the price of the game
And all this wasting time, doing nights in the bang
Got me realizing that my life gotta change, for real

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I use to have dreams, about having too much bread
But seem like whoever stacking me, down with who bust lead
Trying to take something from em, and I ain't having none of that
Artillery is close by, I'mma be grabbing some of that
If somebody was looking at me funny, I was about my money
Acting like the world was mine, and nobody could take it from me
Too much traffic, at my house now
No more twenties, I moved up to pounds and soft now
Got diamonds and gold in my mouth now, hustling hoping I can get rich
Risking mo' than my freedom, turning a continent to a brick
In the briefcase, nervous but tired of being a cheap skate
Running in and out of town on the regular, with no delay
Two hundred and seventeen thousand, dollar spot
35,000 dollar watch, you can hear it when my collar pop
I was a baller, balling in the mix
With seven cell phones, now all my people calling in this bitch

[Hook - 2]

[Bleeda]
And Lord knows, he got to lighten up on me
Sooner or later, it's bound to brighten up for me
But as of now black clouds, have been above me so I'm feeling like Pac
Trying to be calm and survive the storm, but I'm missing my block
Sick of niggas screaming throughout the night, wishing they'd stop
Bitching about, if they gon get a visit or not
When I get out it's back to the block, ain't got no time to keep
(it can't rain forever) not on a nigga, that's designed to get it
Only 23, with at least eighteen prior convictions
Guess I'mma doubt trying to get it, and over ride this visit
I've been through and through it again, troubles trials and trenches
On the edge of reserve, riding on benches sitting in back of the court
Reading breezing, through new bible scriptures
Ain't no reason for Bleeda lying and kick it, but for my niggas on lock
That's still, filling out their grocery list
I blaze tracks like a rapper real over a pit, when I'mma wake up

[Hook - 2x]

I know, I know
(it can't rain forever) - 4x[Verse 1: Macc Grace]
Being back, I reminisce with click in Greenstone
It was just a dream of me to wreck, the microphone
Freestyling over beats, all night no sleep
Another day, another dub acting bad for the streets
It was me, P.A.T, Big Hawk, and Lil Ke
L.O.S., Big Poke, E.S.G, and M.O.E
Can’t forget Al-D, Big Jut, and Papi
Randy, Rhino, Clay-Doe, and Mike D
Man who would ever thought hood stars from the block
Would be the ones on the stage making crowds body rock
3-2 was at the lot but then he came back home
That was about the same time Ro and O came along
Through the years we lost bills, we shedded a few tears
To this day we hit the stage and still receive cheers
It’s a brand new day, and though a lot of things change
Screwed Up Click still here acting bad on the game

[Chorus]
It’s a new day
Can’t none stop us from shining
No way
Its cause the Click is still grinding
Yeahhhh
Screwed Up Click is here to stay

[Verse 2: Mr. 3-2]
Remember back in the day? At Screw’s house
Making grey tapes, till we all passed out
In the wood room, gone off drugs
Nothing but true love for my G’s and thugs
Shorty Mac, Al-D, and the boy P.A.T
Real official members of the S.U.C
Now’s a new day and were all on a mission
Some in studios and some in the kitchen
Whipping up grams, trying to feed the fam
Do what you got to, but you got to be a man
Damn, its feels hard to survive in the game
In the, fast lane, trying to keep my sane
Fame don’t matter when you’re thinking about tomorrow
Looking in the mirror; got to hustle up harder
Tie your shoe lace and head to the sky
How are you going to make it, if you don’t even try?

[Chorus]
It’s a new day
Can’t none stop us from shining
No way
Its cause the Click is still grinding
Yeahhhh
Screwed Up Click is here to stay

[Verse 3: Lil’ O]
Aye I am some cat that jumped down over the years
I’m Fat Rat Wit Da Cheese, blood sweat and tears
I putting down for the H, with the rest of my peers
Southside, Screwed Up, y’all know what the deal
And I’m still hustling, still striving, still homping, still grinding
So don’t be surprise when you see O shining
But it’s more than the money, hoes, and the diamonds
It means even through the struggle, you’re going to stay climbing
And mash on anything in front of you
And pay back the haters for what they’ve done to you
It’s real in the field, so I pack a gun or two
And pray to the lord that they don’t take me under, foo
But I got angels, like Screwyou, Mafio, and Lil Gator
Fat Pat up in heaven, I can see them wearing halos
Watching over me, we gone get this pay roll
Believe it, nigga lets it(Big Moe)
Oooooh, yeeeeeah
Take it from a thug, take it from a thug

[Hook: Big Moe - 2x]
Thug niggas, never sweat these hoes
Cause playas, always get chose
So you don't gotta trick, your do'
If you real you gon hit playa, take it from a pro

[Mr. 3-2]
Now playas, still don't sweat these hoes
Spitting conversation, while I ride deuce-4's
You know's how I do, I get paid off a trick
Changed my name from Mr. 3-2, to Pimp Chris
I ain't ya suga daddy, like Willie Fu-Fu
2003, girls got on they choosing shoes
Keep my pockets paid, my Harley got sprayed
They breaking they toes, to keep daddy living laid
Playa made, from the bottom to the top
Making boys drop out, 'fore them panties drop
I hopped in this pimping, cause girls love a playa
Do anything I say, and come back with that thay-ar
With no problem, or harassment at all
That's why when I'm in the mall, we all gon ball
Gucci for them, and a mink for me
Baby playas get chose, it ain't hard to see

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
I don't grab they arms, I don't pinch they ass
These hoes know, when they see a young nigga with cash
Cleaner than a motherfucker, like I just took a bath
So when these hoes walk by, how the fuck can they pass
A nigga like me up, she know that it's real
Plus I'm from Big Ballin' Texas, she know that I'm trill
And she heard that I can fuck, she wanna know how it feel
I'ma take her to me bedroom, and show her my skills
Cause I'm a playa that get chose, it's my call of duty
And I wage war with cot, and I brawl with booty
And this message goes out to, all my cuties
That I done beat the pussy up, and put all them movies
Had the time of your life, girl your nigga's a G
And you always gon call me, cause your nigga's a flea
And everytime you go to sleep, boo you dreaming bout me
Cause deep down I'm everything, you want your nigga to be
A gangsta a gentleman, plus I talk with class
But I'll still bend you over, and walts that ass
Pull your perm acting out, once I'm talking trash
Like baby who pussy this, pop-pop that ass

[Hook - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
Everything's, still lovely
I'm on drank, I done chilled off the Bubbly
Niggas mad, cause they hoes wanna fuck me
But these boys, these boys they bet not touch me if you ugly
Boys wondering why, they hoes be fiending
Cause they done licked on my nuts, and swallowed my semen
Hoes be dreaming, of having sex with me
And these jealous ass niggas, got plex with me
See girls get full of that, extasy
And they all wanna fuck me, O and 3
Since I'm the H-A-W-K, I'm doing things my way
I fucked her and her, and your fiance
Your girl was bootylicious, just like Beyonce
And your niggas wanna be like me, someday
No how no way, can he do this
And how many hoes, out there suck dick

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Moe]
Take it from a pro, baby
3-2 and Lil' O, baby
H.A.W.K. and Big Moe, baby
Take it from a pro - 2x(*DJ Screw talking*)
Ha-ha, boys ain't gon like this know I'm saying

Bar None Click what's up Lil' O, Fat Pat
(Yungstar), know I'm saying we deep down here in the South
Putting it down know I'm saying, let y'all boys know the real

[Hook: Yungstar - 2x]
It's like rags to riches, Cadillacs and bitches
Champagne in the club, acting bad taking pictures
Strapped at all times, cause these haters wanna kill us
Hundred dollar billers, trying to stack seven figgas

[Lil' O]
I'm Gucci shaded up, big Benz plated up
Boppers looking like what, man this boy done came up
But my life still strenuous, the average hustler would faint
But even in my darkest hour, I shine like candy paint
I hit the freeway, sipping coedine
I'm out of drank, got's to go get some mo' lean
I'm starched and ironed, bald fade bitch I'm so clean
Deuce out the roof, Southside pocket full of green
Know what I'm saying, hit a lick bought a brick so I could make mo' scrilla
This for my certified thugs, in Hiram-Clarke to the Village
For my hustlers in Southwest, Woolfair and Clubkrey
To all my 8900, Braeswood block G's
For my niggas in the 3rd, Sunnyside and the 4
For my niggas in Mo City, Sugarland and South Park
It's Lil' O, bar none boys from the South to the North
I represent hustle city, had to break these boys off

[Fat Pat]
I'm talking rags to riches, mobbing for bitches
Sliding on my switches, Southside got riches
How'd you figga, we wouldn't make that cash
Mash up on the gas, now we passed up your ass
Climbing the ladder, squash the chatter watch the plexers
It's Houston Texas, nationwide watch me wreck it
Long and strong, riding with that playa Lil' O
So watch your girl, 'fore I take that motherfucking ho

[Hook - 2x]

(*DJ Screw talking*)
Know I'm saying, this how it's going down
Riding on you punk bitches and snitches
Out for our riches, know I'm saying
H-Town Texas, feel us, Screwed Up baby fo' life
Everyday and all day, Southsi' for li'[It's a Big E beat]

[Intro: Bun B]
This is dedicated, to the legendary
DJ Screw

[Verse: 1 Bun B]
Now once upon a time not long ago
Where they come down candy, and live life low
Where the fours stay chromey, and they grippin' on wood
And people all behave like it's all to the good
Then came a young player from the Southside streets
Who had dreams of making music, with slowed down beats
He jumped on the tables made it do what it do
And so begins the legend of DJ Screw

[Hook]
(Scratched) This is dedicated to the legendary DJ Screw

[Verse 2: ESG]
Jeah
Six in the morning, Feds at my door
Quarter mil' on the floor, the city where everything shows
Yeah, still bang Screw, we love it mayne
I know he gone, but nothing changed
Hawk, P.A.T., M.O.E. they all above us, mayne
Down here he grind and hustle, mayne
Can't forget Chad Butler mayne
Still swang on 84's, a mirror-glass like buzzers mayne
Grab the Louie duffle man, S.U.C. still in this thing

[Verse 3: C-Note]
See, I love this life

For Hawk, for Pat

But the trunk, be crack
C-Note reppin' S.U.C
R.I.P. to Jimmy T
Nigga, I'mma swang in the 'Lac
That's how it s'posed, to be

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Trae tha Truth]

Used to Texas Screwed up, quick
Yeah, the tracks, Screw'll bring it back
No one better that you can get
For my nigga Robert Davis
Chop it up, Screw my shit
Now the true representation, making sure the world knew this shit
Every time you think of double cups, or swangers peekin' out the boards
Freestylin' off top of dome, or grills covered in ice and gold
Dealers salute the General, point-black, no subliminal
Tell 'em we Screwed up Texas, we go fed like a criminal

[Verse 5: Lil' O]
Here's a little story about a nigga like me
Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze, nigga, S.U.C
South-west, H-Town, all of that's me
If a ho is cotton-mouth I wouldn't give a bitch P
I'm so Screwed up nigga say I talk slow
I say I listen fast when you niggas talk doe
And nah, I can't touch if the shit is not dro
If the drink is not purple, and the bitches no -whoa-

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Z-Ro]
Dark blue Regal, or a Screw Blue Impala
Helpin' everybody, that's what he used to with this dollars
No collars, just t-shirts and Dickies
Even though he had a lot to do
He was never too busy to come and get me
I'm really Screwed Up Click, Robert Earl Davis put me in
Not a friend of a friend of a friend, of a friend
I can see him spinnin' records in Heaven in all white
Like he used to do on 22-34 all night

[Verse 7: Big Hawk]
Niggas I feel that's talkin' shit
Niggas I feel that's ridin' dick
Talkin' down on the Screwed Up Click
They must don't know who they fuckin' wit'
5-Star General of the S.U.C
Want my clique, gotta go through me
Go through Key, and Mike. D
Then you gotta go through Big Pokey
Who you know a nigga hard as me?
Who you nigga know is smart as me?
Niggas wanna know how hard is he
I'm hard as the Baltimore Raven's D
Betcha ain't see, like a [?] real
Hardest nigga I feel, with no deal
Plowin' through niggas like a snowmobile
And I make beats that the real can feel

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Got plenty cheese plenty carats, man we looking like some caterers
And its looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that trunk be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
I still represent H-Town, the city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars but they don't understand it
They say the never seen ya boy out here gettin his grind on
Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Yeh this the city thats slow, the city thats thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
And sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This Clutch City but we play what we delt
Reppin the H-Town

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Paul Wall]
Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north
I'm talking Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall wat it do baby

[Verse 6: Yung Redd]
(Heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)
Purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Stay blowin down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunny Side
I could walk these streets if I was blind, nahmtawkinbout?
Yung Reedd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate swear to God I was a jewler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute
MAYNE!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lil Keke]
H-O to the U-S, T-O to the N
God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunny Side and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rolling up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hiding
Don Ke' heart of the south, slab riding

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it cause there's not a product we dont push
We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touching it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Welcome to H-Town, this 3rd Ward talking

[Verse 12: Trae]
Cheyah!

Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin it like a platinum Rolls
Suicide make the door presidential when they decide to close (real talk)
They want the throne but tell the haters that I got it locked (got it locked)
I shoot em on the west so whatever all they way to the block (doors up)

For the last 15 years, I been reppin my state
I knew the real DJ Screw sip grape by the case
Eight's over ice straight product of the H

It made that nigga sounding soft, flipped and land on his back
And we don't want none of that, mayn fuck that nigga
We wasn't close anyways, I had to bust that nigga
Quick to do a 1-8-7, on niggas tattle telling

We gon hang that snitch, straight bang that bitch

[Pimp C]
I'm gripping the grain, buying a sweets
Playing with candy toys, I'm staying strapped with the heat
The dime to the nickel, and the nickel to the dime
Boys is talking down, but I'm still busting for mine
He done got one, he back on the streets told em I was top gun
Now they planning the Sweet, and now the motherfucking FED's
They got, the phone tapped
But when them bitches get here, you gon be full of hot caps
And it ain't all about this rap, it's all about the snaps
The syrup and the sap, I left the shit off in his lap
I had to bust a cap, now give a nigga dap
Man fuck them niggas telling, all them bitches take a nap
The police in Port Arthur, they hate a nigga guts
But deep down in my soul, they could eat a nigga nuts
They try to set us up, but my mouth never budge
Dedicated to my niggas, doing forty behind drugs

[Hook]
Someone snitching to the laws, we gon hang that bitch
Straight bang that bitch, cause we trying to get rich
Ain't no time for no haters, being all in our mix
We gon hang that snitch, straight bang that bitch
Dog this boy I know too much, cause we got tagged quick
Let's hang that snitch, straight bang that bitch
Have him sleeping with the fish, for fucking over the click
We gon hang that snitch, straight bang that bitch

[Bun B]
Yes we are the jet setters, go-getters and chest wetters
The fo' head sweaters, with big black ass barettas
The Dr. Feel-Good's, with the real good connections
On political election, and cocaine importion
With the coast guard protection, and china white distribution
All through your section, fifteen woman selection
For whom, I got no affection
But help me keep my erection, with no plexing
I guess I'm just another clowning ass Texan, diamond teeth grilling
Pivet relaxing, texting hoes sexing
Jazzy belts flexing, next in line
In the book, to be the made men
Getting high in hotel rooms, Kapone stayed in
That Gotti played in, and Clinton got laid in Marion got high in
And Bun got paid in, so soon as the big broad sang
I pull this thang, and leave your ass bang

[Hook]

(*talking*)
Yeah fresh, (for 9-9) you hater ha-ha
Huh UGK and Lil' O, (Lil' motherfucking O)
We done wrecked it, promised we done wrecked this motherfucker
(hol' up) man hold up, (we gone) later[Dougie D]
You ain't never seen a nigga, that's thugging just like me
A nigga that could take you from a Timex, to a Rolley
And I ain't tricking baby, just the fact I can change your world
To diamonds and pearls, ?and lovers up out the world?
Now how you loving that, baby like Pac I'll make you famous
While caressing up on your tittes, and rubbing on your anus
Its the Dougie Daddy, many boppers they wanna have me
But we be too caught up in shopping, and fucking in the Caddy
Now just throw it at me, baby you know my playa status
A nigga that's shining and grinding, and get it trying to have it
We could ball out till we fall out, and bring it on right back
Pop the seal right off of the Eighty, we drinking all that
Can't get enough of this, living lavage with many karats
Up on our neck and our wrist, riding a candy coated carriage
And that did you raw, showing you shit you never saw
But taking you places, that you never ever thought of before

[Hook: Z-Ro]
I bet he don't hop out of sixes like me
Platinum Rolex, on both wrists just like me
Is he able to surrender a whole section, like me
And still have time, for you to sex me baby
I bet he won't be there when its hard, like me
Plus I know, he ain't a ghetto rap star like me
H-5 and rolling up in a Jordan, like me
I'm the best been, ain't nobody raw like me

[Lil' O]
Bitch shake that loser, run with the aces
Let me hit the pussy, on a regular basis
We could ball in the mall, spend big faces
Go see the world, take a trip to Vegas
Front row at the Lakers, its a fact I'm real
We so close to the court, you could slap Sequel
While these jealous hoes, checking out your fashion skills
I got you in the Prada skirt, with the matching heels
Now can your man do that, these seats cost money
Can he handle that, I don't think so
Your thinking that you cheating, but don't think ho
Just think about my life, and how my ice twinkle
And if you play your cards right, you could have the same
And all I want in return, is ass and some brain
No asking for change, I just give it to you
But you know I take it back, once I dig it in you

[Hook: Z-Ro]

[Trae]
What it do baby girl, I know you know about the Guerilla Maab type thugs
Staying down at the club, getting dubbed valet three deep and on dubs
I'm a Southside superstar, I ain't knocking that cat
But that pretty boy shit played out, baby that's a fact
You need a thug in your life, somebody to run up in you right
Or throw that X in your life, get ready for late night hype
You know we rough raw, and we keeping you turned on like night lights
Ain't no nigga like me, cross the line and whip on the scene
I can show show you better than I'll tell you, ain't no doing it like I does
Fuck thinking of what it was, throw the middle finger to that scrub
Wanna get away to come out with, for real I set it off
Make you think it be like the boss, have you hollin' Trae like you lost

[Hook: Z-Ro - 2x][Chorus]
Back Back Back Back gimme 50 feet
Or I'ma grab the gat and hit a nigga with the heat
Back Back Back Back gimme 50 feet
Don't try to gimme dap bitch you ain't no kin to me
Back Back Back Back gimme 50 feet
Cause you catch a slap if keep on grillin' me
Back Back Back Back gimme 50 feet
Gimme 50 feet Gimme 50 feet

[Verse 1]
Hey here's a little story 'bout a nigga like me
I fuck bad broads live large and drive V's
Some say I'm cocky and rude I might be
But nigga fuck you, you ain't got to like me
I'm at the bar taking sips of long island ice tea
Wrist looking' blue or icy I'm pricey
Bitch niggas mean mugging' and starin' all shiesty
Don't make me pepper spray your face have you lookin' all spicy
Cause I know you niggas hatin' and wanna fight me
Thinking I'm all Hollywood like Spike Lee
Thinking I'ma steal you and fuck up your white T
When I catch you in your jaw I'ma fuck up your white teeth
But nigga I be ready to scuffle like dice peat
And ya'll walkin' outta this tussle ain't likely
I hope you boys ready to rumble I'm quite deep
And I ain't friendly but I'ma tell you politely

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Say I'm the type of cat  when I pull up in the place
You hatas like a blow job put it in they face
I buy the goochie shoes matching belt lookin' great
Dubs sounding cool you can tell I'm pushin' weights
Courtier full of flakes snow storms in the peaks
Ho taming nigga keep my bitch on a leash
You the typa cat that'll chase a chick for weeks
Then try to box a nigga when you hear he hit your freak
But playa don't you know you outta line that shit is weak
And fightin' over broads will get you killed up in these streets
You running round here plexin' always thinking shit is sweet
Then have the nerve to wonder why them bullets hit ya cheek
Then wanna step to me talkin' but (Oh you foul!)
All up in my face talking bout (You hit my gal)!
I'm looking at him stupid like man this shit is wild
You better give me space asshole I ain't ya pal

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I keep my game on face when I'm riding on chops
Straight gorilla pimp don't even wave to the bops
Lookin' like a snail crawlin' slow through the lot
Fist full of grain other hand on the Glock
Cause when you want fee jackers want what you got
That's why I stay ready with the inferred dot
The first one to jump is the first getting shot
Put the beam on his head then I take off his block
You love to rob O like take off you rocks
Take off your shoes playa take off your socks
But I'm the type of cat before I take off my watch
Aim at your chest and try to take off you heart
You know how I do playa shake off tha marks
Hit him with the big guns that take off a part
Chest lookin' like he been ate by a shark
Bitch you better mind stay in line play it smart

[Chorus till end][Hook]
If you a hating ass nigga, back up (back up)
If you a broke ass nigga, back up (back up)
If you a fake ass nigga, back up (back up)
If you a do' popping nigga, back up (back up)
Now all my real ass niggas, what's up (what's up)
Now all my real ass bitches, what's up (what's up)
Now all my money making niggas, what's up (what's up)
Now all my money making bitches, what's up (what's up)

[Lil' O]
Know when to move orangatang, gorilla or ape
Could ever disrespect the Rat, and take food off my plate
I'm as official as a missile, hitting you in the face
That's from Texas fuck with O, to find you in a lake
So back up lil' daddy, you don't want no problems
Cause swisha sweet boys, don't revolve 'em evolve 'em
And any gangsta situation, guns'll solve 'em
So get your mind right, before you lose your noggin
See I ain't really going, for that ducking and dodging
That pushing and rassling, that weaving and bobbing
I just throw on a mask, like I'm Batman and Robin
And let the thang loose, and watch boys start jogging
You know how I do, man y'all see me mobbing
Broad on the right side, slurping and slobbing
Haters mean mugging, like we gotta rob 'em
I mean mug 'em right back, like is it a problem

[Hook]

[Bun B]
Now anyway Bun B can bring it, it's bout to be brought
Any way that you can catch it, fool it's bout to be caught
There's lessons to be taught, haters to be shot
Either by .50 Cal Mag, or that 30-30 out
You bought mo' than you can pay fo', now you got's to lay low
Kick do' to your mama house, pistol to your bay' bro
You think we came to play no, absolutely not
So tell me how to find your brother house, 'fore you get shot
You gave up all the game, and still got smacked with that pistol
The streets is screaming, the gangsta is back and official
They ask him what he love the most, bet he say a hater
Getting hit up with that heat, till he shake like a vibrator
And my state'd be the first, to lead the charge
That'll forward you bullets, off in your house and garage
Cause we them boys, that put the fire to the flame
Burn it down like Baghdad say fool, charge it to the game

[Hook]

[Benz]
Here them Queen boys come, and it's one for the record
It's one life one love, that got you lame's under pressure
I'll tell you to your face, you ain't gotta ask me no questions
Talking tough will get you lames, laid out on a stretcher
I don't fuck with the law, that got my dogs on lock
So this one for T-Bird, Mano, Baby and Brah
All that I got talk, I take what ya got
Since Mississippi Burning, see we play with that fire
True I stay with that fire, from the club to them streets
Boy I stay on my grind, from them drugs to them beats
Nigga stop lying, you ain't no thug boy you weak
When it come to that money, I'll wake you up out your sleep
Now all my Mississippi niggas blaze up, blaze up
Now all my Louisiana niggas boot up, boot up
Now all my T.S. niggas sick up, sick up
Now all my T.A. niggas get buck, get buck

[Hook]

Back up, what's up - 8x(Lil' O talking)
Street life, see I've been trying to tell these kids
If you ain't live in these streets, stay the fuck away from these streets
You know I'm saying cause these streets is nothing to play with, you feel me
It's some real bullshit mentality out there you know what I'm saying
Everybody trying to get everybody, don't care how they get it
Don't care what they do to get it, as long as they get it, know what I'm saying
It's gone be the death of us

[Lil' O]
Hey, niggas in these streets ain't the same no more
They rob, steal and cheat it ain't a game no more
Your own friend'd hit you with the flames from the four
Get you for your stash, leave your brains on the floor
And really I don't want to slang caine no more
Cause snitching like it really ain't a thang no more
The minute they get caught man they sing like a ho
Bring the feds to your house have them bang on your door
That's why I be alone I don't hang no more
See me one deep in a ten range ro'
Thinking through the years everthing changed loc
Cause now a little piece done fucked her for some change or some clothes
Street life mentality by any means get it
Even if a couple heads got it again split it
They don't even be ashamed they be like, yeah I did it
But did you feel bad, I was with it

[Chorus: Papa Reu - 2x]
Cause if I got to beg, steal and borrow to make it to tomorrow
I got to do what I got to, cause who is gonna feed me

[Lil' O]
It's every man for himself, everyone for the scrilla
Hunger turns monkeys to geurillas
Fear turn a coward to a killer
Paper turns ladies into whores
Coward just to dream to the poor
That's why they rob jinks in the stores
And make them lay down on the floor
That's why them boys kicked down your door
Looking for the safe and the raw
They shot you like it ain't against the law
What happened to the rules of the lord
Thou shall not kill, thou shall not rob
Thou shall not steal, but now they be like thou shall not chill
When thou gets his hands on about a couple mill
Man, it's real in these streets
You got to be a soldier to deal with these streets
Act like a chump you be a meal in these streets
They be like, yeah I'm wrong, but I still go to eat, for real cause

[Chorus - 2x]

[Lil' O]
We need to pray to christ, the devil got our soul
And we all pay the price
How many boys you know got slayed over dice
Cause praying in the streets for a chain full of ice
It's the end of the world
And I ain't got a quarter to lend to a girl
But they ain't even tripping, they selling they tail
By these other hoes boost suppose to get them some mail
But room out of freaks nigga tell them theyself
Cause I know everybody trying to get them some wealth
But the route that they going gone get them to hell
Niggas always got the plan, but the plan always fails
And we always end up dead or in jail
Imagine years for the rest of your life you got to live in a cell
That'll make you stop living for real
It's now niggas doing time on the throw when they get in the chair
I tried to warn them but they say they don'y care, cause

[Chorus - 2x]

(Lil' O talking)
Let me tell you something, all that about your my partners
They love me and give me a dollar
If they love me let me tell you something kids
You niggas don't give a fuck about me, you know what I'm saying
You don't go the streets to find love
Cause all you gonna find in the streets is hate
Know what I'm saying, your g's is loving you, your parents loving you
You feel what I'm saying, your family loving you
That's the people that love you man
These niggas in the streets will slit your throat boy
Get on your note I'm telling you something real, you hear what I'm saying
It's some beg, steal or borrow mentality it's every man for himself
If they feel they can come up on you and get away with it
Don't think that they won't do it boy, you know what I'm saying
People care for real, game, that's game[Lil' O]
Uh...
Get ready to dance...
Every girl grab a man...
Get ready to dance

And the way you shake your ass, I know it sexes me
That why them hatin ass hoes be mad at chu
Cause you shake yo thang with attitude

You ain't worried bout yo man

[Chorus]

[Lil' O]

Fuck a lolly-pop girl, you'd be licked
But playas get chose, now who ya wit
Cause you know that I want that
That's why you bendin over,shakin, and you taunt that
Plus you know you got a chest, so you flant that
Plus you know that I'm gone on the koniac

Now you met a baller tonight, you lucked up
The girl I came with, I told her, "tuff luck"
You act ? post and stuck up
I need a hot girl in my life, I want her
Met her at the bar wit her mouth wide open
Eyes blood-shot, red nose, in there smokin
Said,"why she lookin at me all heart broken?"
Forget her, I got your back
So just...

[Chorus]

[Lil' O]
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick
Now I know how yall say I'm wrong
But I couldn't help to think bout baby in a thong
I ain't gonna lie shorty got it goin on
????????????????
That shows right there how throwed she is
Thermistat couldn't tell her how cold she is
Then she did the splits like an olympicists
Started laughin at my date, she a bowler bitch
Don't do it like that girl
You gonna make her start shootin off her gat girl
Cause when she mad, she don't know how to act girl
But you my boy, so I have to give you dab girl
Do your thang just...

[Chorus]

[Lil' O]
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick

[Chorus](*talking*)
Yeah, West-West y'all
It's the Fat Rat with the Cheeze, Lil' O nigga
Did you miss me nigga, hey

[Lil' O]
It's been, a long-long time
But you waited patiently, like a long-long line
Now I'm back with the crack, and the stracks on the grind
Got the jugs from the drank, and a trunk full of nines
If you need it then I got it, cause believe a nigga bought it
Just to sell it back to you, trying to see a lil' profit
If you ask me if I ball, if I feel the need to cop it
And it cost a hundred thou', best believe that I can drive it
So you do the math, nigga do the analysis
I'll be in the kitchen whipping chickens, till my hand gets calises
This hand costs ten, when I'm done
Can you tell me what they value is, I bet you can't nigga
Lil' O certified, bet you ain't nigga
But these rocks, on my wrist'll make a nigga think nigga
Like man, I ain't hustling right
How the fuck that boy shine, like the sun in the night
I heard he just went to the jeweler, and he done him so right
That if you stare up at his chest, it'll fuck up your sight
But if you jack, thinking that you gone luck up tonight
You better know the P-89, ain't nothing nice
In fact, nigga I got choppers that can cut up your pints
I got goons that can rope your kids, and tuck in your wife
In other words lil' daddy, I can fuck up your life
You better stop playing with me nigga, I'm black Superman

(*talking*)
West-West y'all, yeah
This the Screwed Up Click underground nigga
It don't get no more gutter than this nigga

[Lil' O]
I'm the from the group, where the niggas hearts cold
But the block's on fire
Boys in the Penn or the jail, they do not retire
Nobody snitch where shots get fired, it is what it is
If you gotta go to war, then you handle your biz'
And I'd for my pride, you can't handle the kid
And I'd box for my pride, you can't handle the kid
Nigga win lose or draw mayn it is what it is, hey
Somebody better tell em
I got million dollar thoughts, all up in my cell-bellum
Anybody try to stop it, best believe they end up smelling
Found asleep in his car, with a hole in his melon nigga
This is mobster shit
Nigga S.U.C., we a mobster click
Some of us got the drank, others got them bricks
But we all got flow, nigga knock this shit
This is real, like Pac and shit
This is pull it out music, go on ahead and drop your top and shit
Man my flow will make a nigga, wanna cop a brick
Knock off a piece and chain, and go rock his wrist
Cause I'm gutter nigga

(*talking*)
S.U.Ceezy baby, Fat Rat with the Cheezy baby
It's Lil' O nigga, South West-West y'all whoa(*talking*)
Ain't no turning back now
A nigga too deep in nigga, I done tasted the fruit nigga
This the story this is it, this how it went down
The autobiography, of the Fat Rat with the cheese
Lil' O, based on a true story

[Lil' O]
I hit the block in fatigue, with these drugs sitting in my asshole
Straight crack cocaine, hundred dollar street value
And we slanging on this spot, if you don't know you bitch we down you
Surround you, seven in your head is how they found you
The dope game done changed us, derange us into demons
We money hungry hustling, from morning to the evening
Finna see things, these boys ain't seen like plenty G's
Trying to get things these boys ain't got, they diamonds rings
Switched it down, a piece and gold chain
And a big body Benz, sitting on thangs
Know what I'm saying, so I got's to let em hang when I hit these streets
Concentrate on holding weight, and work my way to a ki
Stay away from ho ass niggas, that's surrounding me G
Cause if you ain't talking balling, you can't be around me
And even though, I'm a young nigga
My nuts hang, like they weigh a fucking ton nigga you understand

[Hook - 2x]
See we never falling all in, young niggas balling
Got's to get my grind, and I'm stalling
See my money calling, stay paid yiggy-yes y'alling
Cause being a grown nigga, is a prowling

[Lil' O]
Now its two years later, everything is looking fine
Put up the seventeen, now a nigga scoring nine
Keep my bidness to myself, don't need these haters all in mine
You tell these boys your bidness, and they'll have you doing time
Hit the club starched and ironed, clutching on the bank
At the bar like a star, buying all my niggas dranks
You don't even got to think, you know I got some revenue
Cause I'm piece and chain, POLO Guess doing tennis shoes
Taking pictures for my dog, on lock paying dues
He got five, so he got the Penitentiary blues
And that ain't cool but fool, look at these photos and laugh
Cause I'm posing with bad bitches, with my hands on they ass
Yeah this lifestyle's fast, pray to God I make change
But I'm in it to the death, I can't settle for some change
And it's strange we still hustle, but we know it don't last
But I'm in it to the death, I can't live without the cash

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
My confessions as a changed man, a young adolescent
Now we thug niggas hustling, counting money and blessings
Learn lessons of the game, I study crooks like books
Boss taught me how to pimp hoes, and cocaine cook
I overlooked the thoughts, of living right
Be consequences, yes indeed I had to pay the price
The confiscation of my freedom, what a sacrifice
Not scared to die, but still I lust forever lasting life
But I ain't crying I'm grinding, can't stop young nigga striving
Planning hostile take overs, power moves and perfect timing
Now my roof's popped up, my bitch bopped up
My pockets overflow, like a toilet stalked up
Picking up niggas hoes, drop em off knocked up
And if they nigga plex, I leave his chest locked up
I'm coming up, so why these haters talking down on O
Man I bought you boys tampax, you niggas is hoes

[Hook - 2x]

Bleed the block, bleed the block
Bleed the block, nigga G's and knots
Bleed the block, bleed the block
Bleed the block, nigga we the cops - 2x*Chorus* (Lil' O)[Hawk]

Ever seen a broad get drunk off hennesy on the rocks
Then I pop me and ex(extasy) now i'm fiening for cops
Thats when I notice her sholder staring at the gleam on my watch
Licking her lips rubbing her tits ooh you making me hot
She had a waist like a boss and neck like a hoss
And by the twich in her walk I knew she love when I floss
I whispered in her ear baby let me hit but first
You down to leave with a player she replied [of course]
Took her to the room and baby I was ramming her
Had her hitting off the wall showing stamina
My dick was eating up her pussy like an canibus
She was like [ooh Lil O you a animal]
Thats when I rolled her on her stomacje and I worked her caboose
Deep shots like three corners made her nut me some juice
Then she made her pussy squeeze had it grippin my goose
Made me bust about a gallon had to go and produce
Mann!

*Chorus*

Girl i'm ready to rip I hear you love good sex
So I map out a plan like an artchitech

When I dig I dig deep and make you grit your teeth
I'm a natural freak in between the sheets
But what you got between your legs girl I ain't gon eat
But you can suck the meat til i'm about to cum

Every soldier on my team all about gettin' cake
And the ones get out of line, we do 'em to set 'em straight
Now it's the thugg ones [Yeah] who snatch your loved ones [Yeah]
And call you for the ransom we want it in all ones [For real]
(???) debatin', we all dunns [Get money]
Them niggas alright, but me, I'm awesome

[Chorus]
[Fat Rat!!!]
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
Tha boy that got the work, from half O's to Ki's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!]
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
I bleed niggas' blocks and stab O's and G's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!]
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
Tha little nigga, that push them big body V's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!]
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
There's stealers on my team that smash blows and freeze

[Lil' O]
I'm still a vida-loca [Yeah] slangin' coke-a [Yeah]
Block leadin', tryna get money like Op-rah [Whoa]
In the kitchen cookin' these chickens like ok-ra
I can get it raw, white, yellow, tan, or moca [for real]
Ain't no game is ov-ah, it's just a lot of new heads [uh-huh]
Now a niggas winnin' wars, giving game to the Feds [uh-huh]
That's the type that cats that get found with a brain full of lead [uh-huh]
In the living room, tied up and gagged, laying in red [uh-huh]
Laying and dead, cuz playa if you mention-my-name [uh]
I will break, every bone and every inch-of-your-frame [say whut]
When I throw you off the roof and have you wrenchin-in-pain
There's nuthin' in the world like the stench of remains
Cuz when I throw 'em I don't play no Elementary games
Not when he drunk, ice grill, catching a flame
He could bust, anything, tryna get at my change
I got the streets on lock like pennetentiaries, man,  I'm tha

[Chorus]
[Fat Rat!!!]
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
Tha boy that got the work, from half O's to Ki's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!]
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
I bleed niggas' blocks and stab O's and G's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!]
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
Tha little nigga, that push them big body V's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!]
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
There's stealers on my team that smash blows and freeze

(Lil' O talking til ending)(*H.A.W.K. talking*)
Big balling Texas, you are now about to witness
The sounds, of the Fat Rat with the Cheese
Lil' O, Screwed Up Click

[Hook]
Don't plex, cause I got the tool
(man you talking to me), yeah I'm talking to you
Well see you hating on a playa, cause I rock them jewels
But if it's fuck me nigga, then it's fuck you too

[Lil' O]
Ay yo, I just came to party
And I don't really wanna, kill nobody
Pulled out the thang, lick shots from the forty
And have your mama talking bout, Lordy Lordy
But boys, like to jump into some gangsta games
And never learn, till a playa shank they frame
All you hear is broads is yelling, then I smash and bang
When I pick up the pool stick, and spank his brain
I'm a gangsta gangsta, a hustler hustler
The Braeswood block boy, ain't no busta
And if he don't shoot you, then he bound to cut you
If he chunk up the West, then his boys gon rush up
So the best thing to do, daddy leave it alone
When I'm leaving my home, I'm always leaving with chrome
What makes you think you won't, catch three in your dome
And I ain't even tripping dog, you seen the wrong

[Hook]
Don't plex, cause I got the tool
(man you talking to me), yeah I'm talking to you
Well see you hating on a playa, cause I rock them jewels
But if it's fuck me nigga, then it's fuck you too
Don't plex, cause I got the tool
(man you talking to me), yeah I'm talking to you
Well see you hating on a playa, cause I fucked your boo
But if it's fuck me nigga, then it's fuck you too

[Lil' O]
Hey don't plex, dog it ain't even worth it
I'll have you in a coffin, looking picture perfect
Chest look a mess, body blue like smurfy
(La, la, la, la, la, la)
Nigga what you smoking, what you drinking
You gon run up on who, nigga what you thinking
Hey look me in my eyes, nigga I'm not blinking
These Southside playas, will leave you stinking
But look here daddy, I don't want no trouble
Cause if it go down playa, guns gon rumble
And boys gon drop like fumbles, so if you see
A sucka fall to his knees, man that cat ain't stumble
So what you need to do, is just stay in your place
Before I grab the Cristal bottle, Cris in your face
Have your mouthpiece missing a space, for talking out
The side of your neck, that hating gon get you erased

[Hook]

[Lil' O]
Hey don't plex, lil daddy what's the deal
What's all the plex for, relax and chill
Stop acting like a broad, you need mass and gill
This is Big Balling Texas, start acting trill
We don't fight over hoes, we don't do it like that
This the best way for you, to catch two in your back
Don't be mad when you see me, come through in a Lac
Cause if I'm sitting on 4's, I got two of my gats
And you one of them cats, that's making me feel uncomfortable
Don't make me snatch your life, right from under you
Cause if you hear (*gun shot*), that ain't thunder fool
It's too late, now you six feet under dude
My cars wonderful, my jewelry's shitty
And I ride on chrome, when I cruise the city
And that's where you be a fool, to get me
Cause I got something sitting on my lap, that'll chew your kidney

[Hook]

(*H.A.W.K. talking*)
You see, pretty much what my dog trying to say is
If you out here fighting over these females, you plexing
If you mad at a playa, cause he out here getting his cash, you plexing
And we don't do it like that down here, in these H-Town streets
This is Big H.A.W.K., S.U.C. five star general
Putting it down with my dog Lil' O, letting y'all know how it go
Cause real recognize real, you feel me
