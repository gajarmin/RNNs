[Intro]
You may fail, but you may conquer
See it through!
Black may be the clouds about you
And your future may seem grim
But don't let your nerves desert you
Keep yourself in fighting trim
If the worst is bound to happen
Spite of all that you can do
Running from it will not save you
See it through!
Even hope may seem but futile
When with troubles you're beset
But remember you are facing
Just what other men have met
You may fail, but fall still fighting
Don't give up, whatever you do
Eyes front, head high to the finish
See it through!

[Hook]
I set up a plan and then I seen it through
I gave you a chance cause I believe in you
No matter how hard it get see it through
My only award was just to see you grow
So see it through, see it through
No matter how hard it get see it through
See it through, See it through (Damn...Jack)
No matter how hard it get

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Moms gone, Pops is armed in the belt
Me in juvenile hall wonderin' why we hate ourselves
Drugs brought us all down, is it too late to save myself?
Grandma stressed, kicked outta school I can't behave myself
Hard time tryna be cool I made the bed I slept
Wonderin' is my little ones cool cause now I never check
Not right I owe you my life so now I do my best
Ill whip come through the night though I'm a piece of shit
Pray GOD till we get right then how soon we forget
How I have thousands of rap fans lovin' The Jack
(?) got me insane and I don't love em' back
These gems stem from real pain they don't deserve this shit
Dopest rap song in the game you've never heard of it
Should be the judge and the witness because I murdered it
In the past, thought for my listeners so I killed him with class
Young lads wanna be rappers so I give em' a chance

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kae-1]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ampichino]PART 1: Breathe[Hook: Berner]
Breathe, I can't see
It's cloudy in my whip, I've been rollin' up weed
It help me breathe
This cold street's got me goin' crazy, I can't sleep
I really need to breathe, this shit's deep
They got it on camera, told the police
I can't breathe, they kill him anyway
I guess that's how it is, and we just wanna live
I can't breathe

[Verse 1: Berner]
Jealousy and greed, lemon tree and lean
In a 7 series Bimm, feelin' like the king
Watchin' teens die, on my television screen
Riots in the streets, you hear the pain when she screams
In this life though, [?] right where I sleep
I'm on a mission, had a vision, nine flights in a week
Get your digits up, pistols hidden in the cut
Glass piece look like a sippy cup, half gram, 50 bucks
We push packs like crack in the '80s
And I slip packs, ridin' brand new Mercedes
The good smoke, few bitches give me money
Cause they love me, two Asians and a bunny
All this pressure got me stressin'
And I'm chainsmokin' in my section
Smith & Wesson, keep the weapon cause I'm flexin
And these broke boys keep on textin'
It makes it hard to breathe

[Hook: Berner]

[Verse 2: Berner]
Fuck rap, I'm a legend in the game
And I can't believe I ain't sittin' in the cage
Gucci frames, top down, screamin, "Money ain't a thing"
Coke rocks had us up all night in the rain
Look at now, barely smile, ain't slept in a while
Money wild, on my kitchen counter, haters in denial
Got a club in the city, they just tryna shut us down
Well I'm rich and still ride around with 20 pounds
Out of town, feds wanna hunt us down
Underground, blow a couple hundred thou
This the lifestyle, but damn, it catch up quick
Bet this pack gon' flip, Berner snatch your bitch
Dirty money, I'm just tryna make it clean
And I pray to God every day to stay free
On the interstate 5, in a Jeep with a ki
CHP right behind me, take a deep breath

[Hook: Berner]

[Verse 3: Ampachino]
I think I'm goin' insane
Searchin' for excuses but it's no one to blame
Fuck fame, in the game, movin' caine faster
But I got my last name from a slave master
What's wrong with this world? They're tryna blame rappers
I guess we're the reason for cocaine traffickin'
We go to jail, they toast, champagne blasters
They say happiness is just pain backwards
My homie asked me what's in the afterlife
After death, do you go to Heaven if you clap and shit?
I told him only Allah could answer it
He cocked his strap and said it's back to this trappin' shit
Spit dumb, my tongue be on some acra-shit
It's jewels in my music, you gotta cast the shit
Bar after bar, I'm so passionate
You can't breathe, my words deadly as cancer is

[Hook: Berner]
PART 2: Dreaming[Verse 1: Berner]
Hand full of cash, man these rap dudes broke
140 for the bands, on the highway flow
My eyes stay low off of high grade dope
So baby gotta pay me and I gotta go
I'm talkin' numbers on my phone and get you smacked
This rap money's cool but I'd rather sell packs
Washin' money with white men
Them suits give me checks for my loot
Stripper girls on my phone gettin' nude
(Man she kinda cute, but shit...)
If she ain't talkin' 'bout cash then I gotta pass
Your baby daddy really just want an autograph
Grow rooms, shows for a couple months
My club in Sacramento got the city goin' nuts
This is how I live, wake up in the morning with
Two girls by my side, 40 messages
On my phone, dirty pictures and kisses
I got 26 bitches and I love 'em the same, real talk

[Hook: Berner]
Am I dreaming, tell me am I dreaming?
I just bought a European
Am I dreaming, tell me am I dreaming?
Fly bitches, all this money that I bring in
Am I dreaming, tell me am I dreaming?
Weed lit, I just took about three Xans
Am I dreaming, tell me am I dreaming?

[Verse 2: Berner]
Keep the weed lit, what a mean flip
6 Ps, 12 Gs, [?] shit
I had this shit jumpin' in '09
Back when out of town workin' was gold mine
First [?], yeah I brought it
Me and Wiz smoked out, ask Snoop if Bern really got it
Burned pounds with B. Real
Me and B. Legit hand counted three mil', like really though
18, I had silly dough
31, sittin' on 12 milli though
Got your ex girlfriend in my video
She's drunk, she even let her titties show
Bern get money out these pretty hoes
Give me everything, baby I'll make it rain
I'll make 'em cry when they hear the song with your name
Dirty pictures and kisses
I got 26 bitches and they drive me insane, it's real talk

[Hook: Berner][Verse]
Money my mind frame
Spit dope, lyrically, supply 'caine
Time came, the rich and the famous
Rock five chains, you can say I was brainless
Human tornado, Dolemite stable
You either whip coke or you hold a mic fatal
Designer white labels cause the fiends at night pay you
You got to stay solid in case them suckers try and play you
Put the money on the table, my nigga, let's weigh this paper up
Hand me the duct tape, I'm a bundle this A-1 up
My rhymes dope like a roundhouse
A Peruvian, while you moving back in your mom's house
We was moving units and I ain't talking about music
We was booming pharmaceuticals, get the blow out your cuticles
Business as usual, this a beautiful funeral
Death come in threes, so we make this murder a musical
I got the mind of a Rothschild
Rock galoshes over crocodiles when it's raining out
Bangers flaming, money, sex, and entertainment
The world's most dangerous niggas is who you hanging with
Let me explain it, this how the picture is painted
Precise premonition what got the gifted acquainted
This world's so cold you can feel the pain in my language
I'm exhausted, I feel the pain in my pancreas
This the mania, zaniest, this the fastest
This money ever came in my life, I feel the rapture
I'm hungry, you niggas bologna, Oscar Meyer
I'm off the wire, I'll put a cops head in a dryer
You can smoke all you want, there's none flyer
More game than a crooked attorney, I'll tongue tie you
I'll cook the whole thing up, money can't change us
You can't fuck with me, even if we fuck the same sluts
Angel dust, I'm tangled up, I'll bang your slut
I'll strangle you, leave you pressed up under a mangled bus
Halo's over angels, I hope they pray for us
Cause even the deacons and preachers became afraid of us
Lust ends, fuck friends, family first
Guns burst, I'm starting to question my sanity
Amityville, my mother named me Anthony
Hand me the steel, I'm about to kill my vanity
On my knees, I ask God when I'm gon' die
You could look all you want but ain't no God in the sky
I try to run from this pain by buying jewelry
Fuck it, when I die, let my enemies do my eulogy
I try to run from this pain by buying jewelry
Fuck it, when I die, let my enemies do my eulogy[Hook: The Jacka]
We in the future all my niggas young
Talk about my chop like it's the only one
Over the paper look what we've become
When we gettin' rich while we still young
We in the future all my niggas young
Talk about my chop like it's the only one
Over the paper look what we've become
We gettin' rich out here while we still young

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I'm in the future all my niggas young
Talkin' bout my chop like it's the only one
(?)
Sippin' juice at a spot where if you snooze you gone
Sellin' (?) same spot where I shoot my arm
We gettin' dough but where we go we can't use a dime
But if you want we sendin' soldiers although you were kind
Drug dealin' no feelings when we out our mind
We not lookin' at Lebron if there's powder flyin'
The complications on the Day-Date'll have you traumatized
But a Yacht-Master had a plasma leakin' out your eye
Grand Complications is a grown man's conversation
Four hundred grand neva been on diamonds in the faces
I came up early pushin' tens when all they want was spaceships
My cousin Will, cousin Ray they wasn't only gangsters
Paper over patience when only tough guys ink they faces

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Berner]
I'm still young, got plenty of cash
Ash trays full of gas, broad day no need for a mask
I felt sick movin' money in the mail like that
But I bought 20 more and then I bounced right back
We take trips just to flex, 2 weeks in Qatar
Gold Glocks, big yachts, and beautiful cars
I got bitches on the East Coast catch me in Scores
I'm in a Mink Coat tellin' baby give me some more
Louie V gold frames, ima let the coke drain
Then call her by her whole name
Ten karat we can set it down in the tank
Cream soda with the drank, eyes red as the paint
When I'm gone will they live for me?
Will I see 40 or will I die young? Pray for me
Take some coke and rub it on my gums
I love my chop like it's the only one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ampichino]
All of this paper what have we become
You dealin' with a nigga that rarely see the sun
Young, dumb, full of cum plus I'm on the run
I love the sound of my gun like it's my only one
No love in my heart, the city where I'm from
Will tear you apart if you ain't really from the slums
I murder emcees to the sound of the drum
I bleed the block my Nina pop cause where I'm from
It's kill or be killed you down for the hunt
Put your murder gloves on and wrap 'em round the pump
You ready to eat, you tired of these crumbs
You so used to losin' you don't know when you won
I slide around with a honey-bun
Only time I don't feel pain is when the money come
My girl asked me, what I'm runnin' from
I said I'm runnin' from the world (?)

Yo the club packed what it do what it do
You could go in the parking lot pimp do what ya do
Sippin' on bottles of blue and bottles of gold
Blowin' purp in the V.I. wid some modelling hoes
Yo when the drinks come make sure the bottles is cold
Follow my lead mammy talkin' bout swallowin' me
I got my gun in the club but I'm ready to fight
And my watch and my chain look just like a strobe light
So Fed said he got four hoes that's gon' dyke
I got four to match it's gon' be a long night
We ballin' cuzzin' it look like I pitch for the White Sox
Put my chain in her Remy she wanted it on the rocks
She, wanted to dance she felt the gun in my pants
I'm holdin' her hands hold on ma' I ain't yo man

Fed pulled up in a Benz wid a set of twins what it do

Debiassi when I answer my cell phone corporate
Big business skyscraper stackin' large paper
Gotta get 'em we gotta get 'em we get them what

She rub me they wanna kiss on the god body
Ya whores wanna rape this, prince in a spaceship
So taste this white stuff on ya facelift

The trap spot all night, smoking and keep drinking
Black minks in the winter time, we're crime bosses
Designed portraits, vivid thoughts of flying saucers
Wally moccasins smashing on gas pedals
New SK, I had to throw away my last metal
The godfather, the street author, the sleek walkers
No peace offerings, spark heat cause the streets talking
Sergeants, lieutenants, the hardest niggas in it
If I walked it, I lived it, If I talked it, I did it
Cooking raw in the kitchen, balling since pole position
Part of the boat was missing, I sell work holding the pistols
Coke from Siberia, Louis V interior
If you ain't on, I ain't hearing you
Look in the mirror, tell me what you see
Is it a real motherfucker as you looking at me

The marksman, the target, the grand design
The struggle, the hustle, the process, the demand to shine
The hunger to be in front, the patience to stand in line
The vision of listening in hopes it will advance my grind
The movement, the blueprint, the street science
The weak dying, we keep iron, the street giants
The focus, the understanding
The greed, the need to supply what they're demanding
The harsh realities of life
The thought of reincarnation, I seen it all twice
On my third time around, touching down where them killers be
Display a couple of bananas, make sure the opposition see
I'm magnificent, I'm magnifi-cents
Niggas hollering, I won't even acknowledge it
Basking in the finer shit, you know, that designer shit
No stranger to hard work, I'm up early when it's time to grip

Breathe, I can't see
It's cloudy in my whip, I've been rollin' up weed
It help me breathe
This cold street's got me goin' crazy, I can't sleep
I really need to breathe, this shit's deep
They got it on camera, told the police
I can't breathe, they kill him anyway
I guess that's how it is, and we just wanna live
I can't breathe

[Verse 1: Berner]
Jealousy and greed, lemon tree and lean
In a 7 series Bimm, feelin' like the king
Watchin' teens die, on my television screen
Riots in the streets, you hear the pain when she screams
In this life though, [?] right where I sleep
I'm on a mission, had a vision, nine flights in a week
Get your digits up, pistols hidden in the cut
Glass piece look like a sippy cup, half gram, 50 bucks
We push packs like crack in the '80s
And I slip packs, ridin' brand new Mercedes
The good smoke, few bitches give me money
Cause they love me, two Asians and a bunny
All this pressure got me stressin'
And I'm chainsmokin' in my section
Smith & Wesson, keep the weapon cause I'm flexin
And these broke boys keep on textin'
It makes it hard to breathe

[Hook: Berner]

[Verse 2: Berner]
Fuck rap, I'm a legend in the game
And I can't believe I ain't sittin' in the cage
Gucci frames, top down, screamin, "Money ain't a thing"
Coke rocks had us up all night in the rain
Look at now, barely smile, ain't slept in a while
Money wild, on my kitchen counter, haters in denial
Got a club in the city, they just tryna shut us down
Well I'm rich and still ride around with 20 pounds
Out of town, feds wanna hunt us down
Underground, blow a couple hundred thou
This the lifestyle, but damn, it catch up quick
Bet this pack gon' flip, Berner snatch your bitch
Dirty money, I'm just tryna make it clean
And I pray to God every day to stay free
On the interstate 5, in a Jeep with a ki
CHP right behind me, take a deep breath

[Hook: Berner]

[Verse 3: Ampachino]
I think I'm goin' insane
Searchin' for excuses but it's no one to blame
Fuck fame, in the game, movin' caine faster
But I got my last name from a slave master
What's wrong with this world? They're tryna blame rappers
I guess we're the reason for cocaine traffickin'
We go to jail, they toast, champagne blasters
They say happiness is just pain backwards
My homie asked me what's in the afterlife
After death, do you go to Heaven if you clap and shit?
I told him only Allah could answer it
He cocked his strap and said it's back to this trappin' shit
Spit dumb, my tongue be on some acra-shit
It's jewels in my music, you gotta cast the shit
Bar after bar, I'm so passionate
You can't breathe, my words deadly as cancer is

[Hook: Berner]
PART 2: Dreaming[Verse 1: Berner]
Hand full of cash, man these rap dudes broke
140 for the bands, on the highway flow
My eyes stay low off of high grade dope
So baby gotta pay me and I gotta go
I'm talkin' numbers on my phone and get you smacked
This rap money's cool but I'd rather sell packs
Washin' money with white men
Them suits give me checks for my loot
Stripper girls on my phone gettin' nude
(Man she kinda cute, but shit...)
If she ain't talkin' 'bout cash then I gotta pass
Your baby daddy really just want an autograph
Grow rooms, shows for a couple months
My club in Sacramento got the city goin' nuts
This is how I live, wake up in the morning with
Two girls by my side, 40 messages
On my phone, dirty pictures and kisses
I got 26 bitches and I love 'em the same, real talk

[Hook: Berner]
Am I dreaming, tell me am I dreaming?
I just bought a European
Am I dreaming, tell me am I dreaming?
Fly bitches, all this money that I bring in
Am I dreaming, tell me am I dreaming?
Weed lit, I just took about three Xans
Am I dreaming, tell me am I dreaming?

[Verse 2: Berner]
Keep the weed lit, what a mean flip
6 Ps, 12 Gs, [?] shit
I had this shit jumpin' in '09
Back when out of town workin' was gold mine
First [?], yeah I brought it
Me and Wiz smoked out, ask Snoop if Bern really got it
Burned pounds with B. Real
Me and B. Legit hand counted three mil', like really though
18, I had silly dough
31, sittin' on 12 milli though
Got your ex girlfriend in my video
She's drunk, she even let her titties show
Bern get money out these pretty hoes
Give me everything, baby I'll make it rain
I'll make 'em cry when they hear the song with your name
Dirty pictures and kisses
I got 26 bitches and they drive me insane, it's real talk

[Hook: Berner][Verse 1: Ampachino]
Yo the club packed what it do what it do
You could go in the parking lot pimp do what ya do
Sippin' on bottles of blue and bottles of gold
Blowin' purp in the V.I. wid some modelling hoes
Yo when the drinks come make sure the bottles is cold
Follow my lead mammy talkin' bout swallowin' me
I got my gun in the club but I'm ready to fight
And my watch and my chain look just like a strobe light
So Fed said he got four hoes that's gon' dyke
I got four to match it's gon' be a long night
We ballin' cuzzin' it look like I pitch for the White Sox
Put my chain in her Remy she wanted it on the rocks
She, wanted to dance she felt the gun in my pants
I'm holdin' her hands hold on ma' I ain't yo man
By the way where ya friends, this shit about to end
Fed pulled up in a Benz wid a set of twins what it do

[HOOK: Sample looping]

[Verse 2: Fed-X]
It's the god I'm so high let's fly away on a G-4
It's fifty states I'm place to placee they want more
And praise the Lord they wanna bow to the king
I'm your honor the new dude mister Forbes magazine and still
Debiassi when I answer my cell phone corporate
Big business skyscraper stackin' large paper
Gotta get 'em we gotta get 'em we get them what
The ninety-one H-K'll make yo hood duck
I floss wid dimes you move wid a hood slut
My whips custom you waitin' on ya good luck
Yeh, it's real

HOOK

[Verse 3: Fed-X]
Come on, you know I'm just that dude
And I'm just so cool plus my mouth so rude
It's the don they say I'm godzilla and king kong
Gorilla wid a fifty cal in Cali they love me
Sewers or the streets you know the hoods they dug me
I put it in the air and now ya girl wanna trust me
She rub me they wanna kiss on the god body
Ya whores wanna rape this, prince in a spaceship
So taste this white stuff on ya facelift
The groupies wanna take over huggin' on a god's poster
I push off in a concept these bitches wet
The world is mine my watch is full of begets
The chain hang to my designers ya honors my name
Like half a mil I'm in the bizness not in the game

HOOK[Intro]
You may fail, but you may conquer
See it through!
Black may be the clouds about you
And your future may seem grim
But don't let your nerves desert you
Keep yourself in fighting trim
If the worst is bound to happen
Spite of all that you can do
Running from it will not save you
See it through!
Even hope may seem but futile
When with troubles you're beset
But remember you are facing
Just what other men have met
You may fail, but fall still fighting
Don't give up, whatever you do
Eyes front, head high to the finish
See it through!

[Hook]
I set up a plan and then I seen it through
I gave you a chance cause I believe in you
No matter how hard it get see it through
My only award was just to see you grow
So see it through, see it through
No matter how hard it get see it through
See it through, See it through (Damn...Jack)
No matter how hard it get

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Moms gone, Pops is armed in the belt
Me in juvenile hall wonderin' why we hate ourselves
Drugs brought us all down, is it too late to save myself?
Grandma stressed, kicked outta school I can't behave myself
Hard time tryna be cool I made the bed I slept
Wonderin' is my little ones cool cause now I never check
Not right I owe you my life so now I do my best
Ill whip come through the night though I'm a piece of shit
Pray GOD till we get right then how soon we forget
How I have thousands of rap fans lovin' The Jack
(?) got me insane and I don't love em' back
These gems stem from real pain they don't deserve this shit
Dopest rap song in the game you've never heard of it
Should be the judge and the witness because I murdered it
In the past, thought for my listeners so I killed him with class
Young lads wanna be rappers so I give em' a chance
