[Intro]
Love yourz
Love yourz
No such thing

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 1]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleeping on your level cause it's beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Outro]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive[Verse 1: Wale]
Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya
I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking about no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you whats better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or temporary forevers
Shorty get it together
Diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'till you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If its not it baby, hope its progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby, no more talking baby

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples damn my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh uhh
Sex all night, couple shots of Ciroc
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG them other niggas fell off
Baby girl I just wanna see you well off

[Hook: Drake]
Call me crazy -- shit, at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, thug passion
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated
Balmain, rich denim, out Vegas
French Riviera baby girl lets take a trip
I'mma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission hopefully you'll learn a lesson
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk
She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Wale]
Something about her probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on a fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won’t ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you, let me see, show me proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying eat, we don’t need a spoon

[Hook][Intro: Kanye West]
What you gon do? It’s G.O.O.D. Music and G-Unit
Ugh, Banks, Loso

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen
You know they mad cause cause cause I’m hood rich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good trick
You want a problem
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Big blue, hot and sandy shoe
Cotton candy coupe
Hard knock, orphan Annie loop
Off the stoop
Play with me, see what the swammy do
My canary shoe
High beams pointed right at you, peek-a-boo
Benji paper made me hater-proof
All your family dues
Menage a trois, purple haze and goose, got me loose
Kick my way in and now I got the juice, Gucci bubble goose
Thousand kicks couple hundred boots getting fucking loot
My top down, I’m flashing on em
I’m passing all them, pullover and hit the hazards on em
The ratchets on ‘em, pay my dues, now it’s back to ballin'
Your raps are boring dead men, I dip the casket for em
I’m back performing, I bag em
Break their back, don’t call em
Look down on em like Dikembe, Patrick, Mourning
Cash is pourin’
Stunt stormin, got these bitches soaked
Camera phones capture everything that pictures don't

[Hook: Swizz Beatz] x2

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
We keep these G’s in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I’mma be at least about a hour late
I’m so fresh bitch I should be arrested
New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said “hey ‘Ye”
I said “Yes, bitch”
"Damn I’m only asking you a question"
I met this milf at the allstar getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I’m a rockstar, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas don’t take shots at us that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic’d it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I Platonic’d it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes homie I’m pajama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't paying tonight I’m only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said “It’s free”, I said WOWZERS!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz] x2

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
Ninja Kawasaki, Ducati, my old Harley
Rock the party
Move your body
Wassup, wassup
Everybody
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Wait a minute

[Ryan Leslie]
Lets get it started, get it started, get it started yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate!
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait
Where’s the dinner plates?
BMW, 10 to 8, Interstate 95, passenger
Baddest bitch in the states, half Spanish half Trinidad
Complexion Henny straight
Y’all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can’t afford to be a minute late
It’s time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning round the bezel that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess her plate's my crotch
Y'all soft as tater tot, little niggas try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the Chinese spot
I hear ‘em talking it but ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes so who gives a shit

[Hook] x2[Fabolous]
Shawty so cold, pussy winter fresh
Reservations to eat and you’re my dinner guest
Shawty cleaned up nice, never been a mess
Could take a little pain, I see them tattoos in her flesh
But I ain’t try to hurt her, ‘cause i’ve always been the best
I’m making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest
Sex excellent, get a hundred when I test
I’m a fan of her talent, so i’ve always been impressed
Sex in the city on my black satin sheets
Wet as Hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets
Lid a few candles like my power hadn’t reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn’t reached
Bitch so bad know her parents went through hell
Smart mouth when we argue, you would swear she went to Yale
I wanna touch her, not using my hands
Make her dance without using the bands

[Chorus: Cassie]
Call me crazy, shit, at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
Know is easy to get caught up in the morning
When you say ‘cause you’re mad and you take it all back
Then we fuck all night till things get right
Then we fuck all night till things get right

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
The club popping but she ain’t trying go there
Her friends know where she going every time she tell them “nowhere”
I’m the only one that get up in the vip
My money grown, baby, ain’t no need to see id
Slide a some just to come through, host money
At least niggas know you’re getting through the most money
Club my place, you wear what you wanna wear
But you’re overdressed if you’re wearing underwear
I turn up, couple js to burn up
Couple spice to hide out, now let that playlist right out
Where I live on sunday, her place monday
Her hand in my pants, call that Al Bundy
Pull it out like a pistol, yo, kiss it on the balls like the dick the mistletoe
Tell her do the thing I like, best she listen, yo
Bad bitch good girl around the christmas, though

[Chorus: Cassie]

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Pussy sweeter than some fresh fruit
She gushing and I drink the best juice
I’m drinking till nothing left to
And she playing with herself, too
I be thinking about her all day
She perform like it’s Broadway
Yeah, we hop in the range, she off top wit' the brain
Got the windows down, broad day
Just look at her, spectacular
The one in stove, flip her like a spatula
Other niggas want her, but you see the niggas whack to her
Side bitch tripping ‘cause i’ll never get back to her
My bitch like bitches, but none of my bitches bad to her
She’s said "Trigga, why I never seen her with a bad bitch?"
Unless she’s meeting on these other bitches average
Hundred percent real while these bitches is plastic
Moroccan goddess, she walk like she need her ass kissed
Walk like she need her ass kissed
Diced pineapples, super fine at you
If she’s giving head, she’s throwing her mind at you
Fuck these other bitches, nigga, she don’t mind what you do
I just wanna watch, I ain’t taking time at you, dudes
Never faking, why they hella friend?
Keep it real with her, yeah, that’s what she ever wants
Somethin' 'bout to alchemy, she don't ever disappoint
London on the balcony, we’re about to smoke another joint
Miami on the yacht, she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock
Metaphoric bliss, shawty, you’re the shit
Couple days with her, man, that’s all I ever get
And she got a little sister, that’s what she ever with
Game like a nigga man, that’s all she ever speak
Montreal was our first time, swear pussy just like the first lines
Scars on my back, she left couple, spent a couple stacks, had her put a couple pair
Try to beg mine, my nigga out of bootie
Never retract statements, nigga, I’m never scared
Niggas be switching up, but nigga, I’m never weird
Back on another leer
I leave niggas here, all in another year
All in another lane, all in another gear
All of you niggas lame, all of your niggas here
Listen up, bitch niggas bitching up
I guess you’re doing what you’re supposed to
Let a real nigga hold you
Back to my baby girl though, I just need you in my world, yo

[Chorus: Cassie]Yeah, yeah
I remember...

[Verse 1]
I remember nights I used to sell rock, posted on the corner like a mailbox
First class ticket to a cell block, just to get some Polo and some shell tops
Cold world and they say hell's hot
But it ain't hotter than that choppa when them shells drop
Man I seen niggas play that block and get they bell rocked
Cops cleared the scene and I was back by twelve o'clock
Tryna get it, Dickies on and my fitted
Gun in my draws, ducking the law, I'm all with it
Money, cars and clothes, I wanted 'em all nigga
I never was good at hoopin', I wanted to ball nigga
Cause the OG's sold keys and I had no cheese
Coppers lock me, beat me down like I was Cochise
Old fiends coppin' work through their old dreams
They got shattered, it ain't matter cause we thirst cream
Niggas serving niggas moms just to make a flip
Homies murder other homies just to make a brick
Most my niggas done got busted tryna take a hit
The feds were lurking, we was serving, they was taking flicks

[Hook]
This how it goes down in the jungle
Where niggas learn to shoot before they could rumble
Cops rushing, they gon' kick in the front door
And if they chase you better hope you don't stumble
I wanted Polo with some shell tops
I just wanted Polo and some shell tops
And I was out there tryna sell rocks
Cause I wanted Polo and some shell tops

[Verse 2]
I done seen close neighbors lose hope
Fall victim to the streets and start to use dope
I used to load my gun before I went to school first
It's crazy niggas wanna kill me, we was cool first
And when it comes to friends you can't let 'em too close
That's why they call 'em close friends, you turn your back they move first
And I just bought a new Ghost, and a crib out on that new coast
And it all started from a dolla
Running from the law, scuffing up my Pradas
Crack all in my draws, tryna make a profit
All I wanted was some shells and some Polo for my closet, Awhhh
Drug money, turn to blood money
I only roll with niggas that'll take a slug for me
No matter what it is, I'mma pay that bail money
To get my niggas right, my niggas for life!

[Hook][Intro]
Some things you have to see for yourself
Francis Ford, fuckin' with them hoes
You niggas still can't afford

[Verse 1]
Made so many mistakes I know that my niggas relate
Just to rattle my cage, so much shit they sat on my plate
She know me through records, but she don't know me too well
All this game is for sale was priceless, I keep for myself
Shots fired, man expired in his Jordan 3's
Small talk, turn that page, that's all they ever read
You graduated, you still unemployed
Taken for granted, love is null and void
No longer one and few, young Langston Hughes
Jewish intuition, I'm followin' cues
Niggas own Versace, don't know Nikki Giovanni
Your paper chasin', can't see that it's runnin' from you
My homies from the block, they labeled me cunnin'
No excuse for my success, so they say I'm Masonic
I keep it one hundred, fuck her, I keep the car runnin'
How she fuck on the back, that's to keep food in the stomach

[Hook]
Look at me, look at me
Realest shit you niggas ever seen
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me

[Verse 2]
Playin' for keeps, and that's just to say at the least
Had a few seizures, nigga refused to get me some sleep
I let shit slide, I should see the sparks
Now I think about my moms when I jot these songs
I think of certain niggas when I mention guns
Heavy artillery, death to enemies number one
Francis Ford, flows you niggas can't ignore
Shoppin' with them hoes you niggas can't afford
Bellaire Rose, they thought I'd go gold, wouldn't sell anything more
They thought I'd fail, they thought I'd fold
Go to hell, any nigga wanna buy my soul
Double-M, extend my hand, I see you stumblin'
Francis Ford films budget, double-forty M's
Godfather money, filmin' part four again
Butterball, Magic City, so you know it's him, me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I blaze J's, fuck the Dutch slave trade
Fuck a net worth when I'm just trynna maintain
Tennessee, I felt like Mr. Wendal, nigga
When ain't nobody starin' out that window with you
Obligated, surrounded, when you are often hated
Left a bag of that dope when they flew off to Vegas
It was written, Mr. Jones, a different picture
Strong as bones like Corleones, the realest figures
Speakin' in native tongues, me, myself and I
Through Michael Rapaport eyes, it's just a lost trial
But I see the gems, I see the stars
Diabetes and all, your name will carry on
I pray this legacy is what is left of me
Corporate cannabis givin' me leprosy
Look at me, look at me
Double-M, fuckin' G

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, Philly in this bitch!
Loso waddup?

[Verse 1]
I'm from a city where the skinny niggas ride
With a Semi .45, make the biggest niggas fold up, roll up
I dunn seen the realest niggas froze up
When that Mac squeezing hollows leave your back, leaking that
Decent if you want to, everytime I come through
Everybody whispering, talking what they gon' do
Hundred grand in straight cash don't make me put it on you
And have your own homies trying to swarm you, I'm sworn to
Riding with this Glock .40 and I got it on, too
They tell me to put it down, but they don't know what I'm going through
Niggas playing checkers, and this is chess
So what's a pawn to a king that nigga got his money right
You niggas on a hunger strike
When I was dead-broke, man I used to grind a hundred a night
A hundred a days selling white, I tell you it ain't nothing nice
I be going so hard, I don't see my son at night
Baby mama bitching, I'm just trying to get my young'un right
Started with a dollar, to a half a ticket
And I just signed my deal today for all you rapping niggas
Money ain't a joke, you see me laughing niggas?
All my goonies they ain't talking, they just clapping niggas
You gonna think my dog a roofer, brought a ladder with him
My other homie a mechanic, got his ratchet with him
And they shootin' for real, they shooting to kill
I got some homies up state, they doing the wheel
I remember niggas shooting for dear life
30 years on us, cops pulling the red lights
We riding with them hammers
Know a couple young'uns that died before their grandma
Trying to play with hammers
A lot of niggas fronted back when I was in the slammer
But, now I got that paper in, and I be going bananas
Like Tony the Montana, Nino and the Carter
Got me leaning even harder with this Nina in my cargoes
I can't meet em any farther if the niggas want the work
Tell em meet me out North, 20- something and Berks
Used to be with 50 niggas, 20 of em got murked
20 of them turned pussy, the other 10 put in work
Yeah! I'm screaming "this is the life"
If you ain't hoopin' then you whipping the white
Or either hitting the white
I talked to em try to give them advice
Niggas get left, they wasn't living too right
Yeah! Uh, niggas get left, they wasn't living too right
Y'all don't really hear me tho[Refrain: Rick Ross]
600 Benz, house six hundred grand
That was six years ago, whips come from Japan
I get that work from my face
I get that work from my face

[Wale]
600 Benz, condo six hundred grand
I got twelve hundred kicks, them bitches straight from Japan
My ambition is wicked I put that shit on my hand

[Rick Ross]
I get that work from my face

[Wale]
I put that shit on my man

[Verse 1:Wale]
Wale, real nigga, where the totem, blowin' bomb haze
I just tell CJ keep on rollin’ that's my shorty
Tinted out, you ain't seeing through
All black everything, this shit like a HBCU
Maybach music, major moves
I’m saving major loot
I make my old bitch buy me all the latest shoes
One whip just ain't enough, I just seen 33
You only half a W without a second V
Gotta be dreamin, gotta be chosen
Shawty when I was 20 I had a Camry and tokens
But now I’m ok, bitch I got my shit together
Rozay told me keep on working, shawty you’ll be rich forever, ever
Forever my endeavours and I sever my opponents
I’m cold like its in Denver
The dilemma is, you think I got no conscience
You think I just here flossing and talking?

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Dependin' on how I feel, either the coupe or sedan
I’m only dealin' with you, nothin' to do with your man
Niggas ruin your plans, it’s best to do what you can
I’m up to six hundred bricks, started with two hundred grams
Hand to hand in the cold
Pockets on hella swole
I was breakin' ‘em down, now I’m sellin' ‘em whole
Work straight out the kitchen
Ain't no competition
You just shut up and listen and you can complete the mission
Know you want me to fall
I don’t do nothing but ball
You heard I was in jail, well I just came from the mall
I’m on my way to the jeweler bout to cop me a Muller
Keep the digital ruler at arm's length of the Ruger
Life’s a bitch and I feel her
Ain't nobody iller, perico Godzilla
Catch me blowing vanillas
Used to be blood money

Now it’s go hard scrilla
After I count it all up, I’ma go to the dealer and get a…

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Hope you heard that intro
This that I been grindin' cause I’ve been savin' for that Benz flow
To mash on assholes with petty badges
Tell em’ niggas we throwed, but they never gon catch us
If I am pulled over, I know they gon be on it
Cause it’s hot in here and I got no L like the ’72 Dolphins
Woooh, race my niggas, and I bet you never pass me like a free safety
I’m Polamalu, 600 the newest model
My newest motto to use a condom with newest models
Uhh, got a hundred on the dash, young
Ya ain't killers ya’ll got hundred yard dash guns
I’m a rare one, camo’s and some rare ones
Where I'm from is a circus hope you don’t expect a fair one
Dropping hundreds like it ain't nothin'
Really it was but you know I never sayin’ nothin'

[Hook][Intro]
I had that little bad bitch with me the other night
She gon ask me why I don't ever go to sleep cause I was up
You know what I told that ho

[Bridge]
I ain't going to sleep until I touch a hundred million
Bitches know its money when we step up in the building
Neck is saying cool but my wrist is saying chillin'
Stuntin' so hard I could hurt a hater feeling

[Verse 1]
Grind hard then you shine hard that's the motto
Shitting on these niggas like I fucking hit the lotto
Who you know fresh from out the hood to a Gallardo
House up on the hill stupid crazy dumb retardo
Y'all know, either going home or going hard doe
You only live once and I'm a ball until I fall ho
[?] all that hatting shit ain't even called for
We just pull up on you haters looking like a car show
Made a hundred grand and I blew it
Made another hundred grand and I ran through it
Every time I get it spend it like its nothing to it
If I see it and I like I'm like Nike I just do it
I just cop it I just drop it [?]
Gucci Louis Polo [?]
Breitling Rollie Audemar
Fuck it I want all of it
Kobe though I'm balling bitch
Competition calling quick
Addicted to the money I guess I'm a cake-a-holic then

[Bridge]

[Hook]
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich (you heard me ho)
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich (what did you tell that ho?)
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich
All them bitches know its money when we step up in this bitch

[Verse 2]
They say ain't nothing coming to a sleeper but a dream
And I ain't been to sleep since I was fucking seveteen
Money that you've never seen
Graveyard shifting it
Late night getting it
All about the Benjamins
Break the work down let the Pyrex heat up
Hit my youngins off to count the money with my feet up
Let them sleep we up, hating nigga D up
Hustlers hear this shit then bring it back like its the re-up
I ain't going to sleep until I touch a hundred million
They talking about no homicide I say that I'm a kill them
Talking about that blow paper money to the ceiling
Bitch I'm about my mula give a fuck about your feelings
Chill then, ain't no time for cuddling and kissing
Just hustling and [?]
You tired just like Michelin
I be up like all night counting my percentages
Trapping all day and serving fiends like this was tennis here

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich like porter
Stared with a dollar turned that to four quarters
I hustle like I got three sons and four daughters
Watching for the D's dipping in the Ford Taurus
I'm porridge, flaming hot
You hating if you say I'm not
I buy that shit you say you got
I hustle I don't play a lot
Dawg I let my swagger do the talking I don't say a lot
Hustle and make it five times back I never save a lot

[Bridge + Hook]

[Outro]
Word up
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich nigga
How do some of you niggas go to sleep dead broke
I don't understand them
Cause I ain't going to sleep until my bank account on muhfucking seven,eight digits nigga
You already know
Meek Milly Flamerz[Intro: Joe Budden]
Loose Quarter
Few questions I ask myself

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Maybe it started with Slaughterhouse
Or was it tour life
Maybe it wouldn’t had started at all
If I had your life
Maybe it was needed or I was thinking immorally
If I wasn’t myself could I say I gave the fans All of Me
Can’t decide if I’m more ashamed of what they saw of me
Than I am of ignoring all the lessons that was taught to me
Headed up field but couldn’t dodge the last tackler
How could a forward thinker move so ass-backwards
How could a dude with no regrets at all
Willing to bet it all, not realize that quicker demise
How could I neglect it all
I’m so seasonal, some of y'all knew I'd spring back
With a heart this cold
How'd y'all think I’d be receptive to fall
I’m plenty comfortable when danger’s around
And even more so when stranger's around
And the bigger picture is sicker
Don't know my triggers or know the alarm it forces
Don't know a nigga
Don't know my bouts with drugs and liquor or the harm it causes
Life or death, I tried to lynch myself
Thought I could keep it all a secret, I convinced myself
But really, the folk that loved me
They could tell I was locin'
I couldn’t see him
Cry me a river cause it fell in the ocean
Numb to my words now, maybe felt I was open
I cut so many people loose, do I need help with devotion
That’s just some of the things I ask my Lord and Savior
And when He calls for me, will He have done us all a favor

[Hook: Kobe]
How did I make it here
Who are y'all
I feel so lost
Now I’m not seeing it clear
Is it my fault
It’s all in my head

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
I’m looking around like this can’t be happening
Round of applause for the angry rappers
Lord, my girl cried me a flood then me a river
That’s love, depending on me when I’m independent on liquor
I’m up in the shoe store, she got no love to show
You ever look at a bitch you was fucking behind your bitch back
Like fuck I was fucking you for
I’m an artist so I’m intelligent
I would tell you to do some soul searching
But it’s hanging up in my closet with your skeleton
It’s gotta be a God's work
Even a diamond gotta be polished first
A quarter's on the loose
And I ain’t been out here getting my dollars worth
I had to remove the goggles first
To see through the sipping Patrón
And fifty phoners for I need to go get me a kidney donor
Guru, Nate Dogg, go ahead blink an eye
Your doctor told me you close, go head drink and die
Buried under the stone where the Patrón fifth sits by
That reads, here lies somebody who never wanted to be THIS guy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
They say knowledge is power
Great cause every day I learn
As of late been having revelations bout this hate term
Hate the way they judge me
Till I got the case adjourned
Hated the belly of the beast
Till I became its tapeworm
When I said I’d stop getting high
Tried to say it stern
Now, I’m the type to walk through the fire to check the way it burn
They say my brain is off
I say how can it be
If I’m out my mind, how can I be in-sanity
The people used to say that I was scared of progress
They don’t know how hard a nigga tried to advance
But I don’t know who’s more to blame
Is it them for really not knowin' me
Or is it me for never really giving them a chance
Get too close, be too big of a threat
Now it’s been little to no time
Thinking why I ain’t get rid of you yet
Gotta recognize my maturity
Gotta see I’m grown
Let all my skeletons out the closet
Just so I'd never be alone
Since I got trust issues I won’t discuss with you
Besides God tell me who the fuck’s supposed to save you
Pop won't have a man-to-man
Was gone half my life so
Somewhere in his head probably feel it ain't his place to
Plus more people will see me soon
I mean I’ll be on national TV soon
So when I ask if people I have around are a cancer for me
That’s four million more that might be able to answer for me

[Hook][Intro: Teedra Moses]
We get ghost, you already know what it is
Money stuffed in my bag
Maybach shit!
Cameras in the ceiling, Céline on my arm

[Verse 1]
Bright lights and dark corners as night embark on us
Refugees running wild, Wyclef with a SIG Sauer
Nothing to lose, I was starving from the start
Now the same cat driving Jaguars
Open fire when you see me yell out and make em whisper
The club that I'm a member, they'll be gone by November
Keys to the city got killers who slither with me
Lamborghini, middle of the ghetto, smoke a fat fifty
Billionaire bid, wrists on chill
Standing in the field of dreams, tryna see a hundred mil
These boys going blind they just happy being free
In a world of so many I just wanted me a key
Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece
Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all deceased
These boys snort lines, I'm fine just sipping wine
Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind

[Hook]
I'm Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

[Verse 2]
Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick
Always running late, quick to show up with your bitch
The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish
All stainless steel, quick to match it with my tool and
Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit
Red or blue, do you, as long as you're getting rich
Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange
Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change
These niggas acting like they want a war!
When it come to whacking niggas I done won awards
Nigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?
I'm riding in some shit only I can afford
Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a rapport
Amsterdam state of mind: I just gave you a tour
I'm laughing at the people who label me poor
Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm speaking on unwritten laws -- the code of the streets
I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into at a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him
And do what the fuck you want to do
Niggas like me, you gotta get permission homie!
And that could take a long time!
In that time, I'mma handle my muthafuckin business..
Ugh! Ugh!
It's the red light district, nigga this Amsterdam
Wherever the fuck I'm at
It's a no go
We greenlight you bitch niggas
Rozay![Verse 1] (Jay Young)
No lights, dark corners, my life just hasn't been the same
Since my dad left my momma and me to live through the pain
No money, mo problems, this ain't what Biggie said to me
When he told me more money equals the more problems we see
I'm in a sinkhole, but I'm not in Florida
I'm just a spectacled specter walking through life's corridors
I'm tryna bring down the roof of the booth
With rhymes and lines that will nurture and quench the fruit of the youth
I'm building libraries with these bars
The lil homie Chava with me, he a future star
Swaf Gang, kill them all, we don't give a fuck
We the alphas in the savannah, we don't deal with cubs
I ain't your typical, pitiful individual
Who's only out here making cheese off these digital syllables
So if I rob you, I don't lose no sleep
Grinding hard, getting deep as trenches in the Philippines 

[Hook] (Rick Ross)
I'm Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

[Verse 2] (Chava)
It's been a few years, but she gon ever forgot it
With this music, I applaudin' this fuckin' rap attack
Bitches tryna give me hugs, niggas tryna give me dap
Little nigga pastor, oh you can't tell me nothin'
All a sudden, I got [??] and cousins
Cuz they heard that I'm doing something with my life
So I rap and record it, then I put it on the mic
And I'm grinding every night, got a grip like Dolemite, DAMN!
Shit, Chava 'bout to spaz
The way that I spat, you should take me off the map
I'll pop your top, like a Snapple cap
I ain't with the battle rap
Yo, it's my ambition to make your division
For my ambition to make it a livin', I'm
Spittin the sickest, quickest, with the writtens
So quit the bitchin', say Jay and Chava did it

[Hook] (Rick Ross)
I'm Berry Gordy to the streets

Montana
That untouchable empire, baby, Coke Boy
(Bad Boy) They say careful what you ask for
Cause when you get it, you know what you gon' tell 'em right?
(We're baaa-aack)

[Hook: Jeremih]
What you say? I do this err'day, wh-what you say? I do this err'day
Do this err day, do this err day, do this err day, do this err day
What you say? I do this, wh-wh-what you say? I do this err'day
Do this err'day, do this err'day, do this err'day, do this err'day

[Interlude: Diddy] + (French Montana)
(Jeremih) French Montana!
(Hah... what they talkin 'bout, Puff?)
They ain't talkin 'bout, nothin
This the moment they feel ya, let's get back when I get there
They've seen what it is, so look it down
Bad Boy, Blood Line, get up, talk to 'em

[Jeremih]
I got tats all on my arm, racks on racks in the bank
Forgiato my rims, pepsi blue my paint
All these girls be choosy, can't find a bitch who ain't
Haters they are ballin' like fishes in a tank
Stuntin' with my whole crew, hangin' out the window when we roll up
You know when we come through, make it rain we don't give a fuck
Bout what you say, I do this every day; don't buy bottles, buy by the case
Seem like every night my birthday I can't help but get the cake

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Feel like I was born for ballin' out
Live it up and just for fallin' out

[Hook]

[French Montana]
MONTANA~!
Tattoos on my neck, half a mill in my car
Dream team I rep, just me and my dogs
Stray cash in that haircut, sea bass, no lamb chops
Met her at the bar, tryin' to get some head shots
62 that Maybach, fake jewels don't play that
Take off like Blake Griff, money tall like A6
Never hit that red zone, baby I was airborne
Hoppin' out that Ghost sippin' red dot with that red bone
Trunk up in the back, drop the population
And I'm never fakin' Jacks, you know I'm poppin' Aces
I'mma ball, illuminati bank rolls
Suicide Lambo Doors and two italian taned hoes

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Diddy]
Yeah, yeah, my mic sounds nice right now
1-2, ayo, pure Blood Line baby, check it out...
I'm flyin' around and I'm gettin' it like 90 Thou in my denim
Told a bitch I just met, write your problems down and I'll end 'em
I'm creepin' on a billi, got these niggas buyin' largely
Bout to take my LA crib and drop that bitch on Wall Street
Peep my watch and hand game, like Peach Ciroc and Champagne
You buyin' jets, I could buy the Jets, I ain't speakin' 'bout no damn planes
This passion and pain fashion, matchin' my things catchin'
Action from things mackin', then flashin' my rings captain
Twin V's, entire, envy my attire
Catalogue, but don't have the heart cause real kings build empires
Everything that I said nigga was everything that you saw
I did everything that I claim, you ain't like us cause we ball

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Outro: French Montana] + (Diddy)
(Ayo, this the way it lives, this what it is)
(You see it) I was born to ball, bitch! HAH~! (Bad Boy)
If you ain't heard you live under a motherfuckin' rock (Coke Boyz)

We was born to fly baby, still do the same thing nigga
Shit sound like I just sold nigga
Untouchable Empire, Bad Boy, Coke Boy
Diddy what up? Ya heard?[Hook]
I'm the Black Mozart
I lead these broads 2 by 2 like its Noah's ark
You know where I went to school, man, I'm so smart
Bra and panties on the stage that's where their clothes are

[Verse 1]
Deep tissue massages, 100 rack deposits
12 suits in my closet, fresh fruits in my pocket
LA to Miami
Nominated by Grammys
Lame dudes can't stand me, I only focus on family
My new chick is so hot thats why I like her
My ex-chick is so hot Diddy wifed her
When I pull up in that ghost I'm like a white blur
Your whole team wearing skirts Rowdy Piper

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look at me doing my thing - look at me getting it now
From the bottom I came, I made a milli somehow
4 apartments in Harlem man, I'm housing my team
Black millionaire you don't know how bout it I've been
Bought furs, bought homes
'93 I had a car phone
Sky page - call you back
Flatline Cardiak
'94, Ivy league
Fell in love with them ivory keys
Killed those, made tracks
No talent I hate that
Get with me

[Hook][Intro]

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Troy A-V-E, straight out of NYC
I rep that BSB and yeah the streets feel me
I touch their heart when I speak
I'm touching women [?]
I'm touching money off keys
I'm touching boys like a priest
With the heat, [?] I'm in tour [?]
[?]
Fighting cases in this court
Some lost, but they really won
Cause shit, what they really done could get them triple life
Or the chair or [?] all in one
365 I am free and alive
I'm too blessed to be stressed, thank the Lord in my eyes
Can't forget my cerebral, on point like a needle
I know some niggas be haters and bitter bitches are evil
You see the Devil's a liar, [?]
My homie Trae is same

Little Sister: Big Brother Wake Up I'm Hungry
HBRenzo: (Yawns)Alright Dayla I'm finna  make you something to eat
Little Sister: Ain't no more food in the house
HBRenzo: I'm finna go to the store for you
Sister: Mama said ain't no more food stamps either
Renzo: Damn. Alright Don't worry about it Dayla I'll get you something to eat
Sister: OK Big Brother, Don't let me down

[Verse 2: HBRenzo]
Off Top
And they wonder why we slangin like it's no tomorrow
No food in the crib the lights is off, I need some hope to borrow
Damn, when you wake up every morning with a hard life
I swear to God the first thing come to mind is flippin hard white
Especially when you got brothers and sisters
The government don't assist us
That's we tucking them pistols
Kuz everybody tryna get it in the streets
And if you work that 9 to 5 then Uncle Sam gone want a piece
But in my eyes
If you don't help me get it, you can't get a cut of my pie
And that's real shit, I just met the plug that's making pill flips
And I know if I get involved, my mama will trip
But at the same time seeing her face expression looking at that bill List
Just make me grind even harder
Had a conversation with God and he told me
(Gotta Think Smarter kuz it's all about survival
I got plans for you, what you think I'm keeping you alive for)
All the times I should have died
The devil laughed as I cried so


[Chorus:]
By Any Means I'ma get it while I'm existing
No more going hungry, my sister gone have food in the kitchen
By any means I'ma get it while I'm still living
Put yo hands up in the air if you feeling just like I'm feeling
And we gone rise up to the top and that's by any means
I'ma get my mama off the block and that's by any means
Said we gone rise above the top and that's by any means
I'ma grind until we living out all of our many dreams


[Verse 2: HBRenzo]
I'ma get my mama out the hood and put her in the islands
Kuz in the hood that I grew up in it ain't shit but violence
See n****s running up in cribs, sometimes you hear the sirens
Other times you hear them shots fired and then you hear the silence
And every day is like survival of the strapped and ready
Bullets flying, slicing n****s up, call em chef's machete's
And N****s campaigning for the dead presidents
Kuz when you from the slums I swear every dollar seem heaven sent
N****s barely teens, they 13 out here getting involved
And I don't blame em when all the money come form the law
Who cutting pay and raising taxes
It's no wonder why they juggin, hoodies on toting the ratchets
So if you eating good then everything is getting snatched
Especially if you eating and you ain't giving back off top
Now I'm not saying that I'm all for it
But shit, it's the truth and you just can't ignore it



[Chorus:]
By Any Means I'ma get it while I'm existing
No more going hungry, my sister gone have food in the kitchen
By any means I'ma get it while I'm still living
Put yo hands up in the air if you feeling just like I'm feeling
And we gone rise up to the top and that's by any means
I'ma get my mama off the block and that's by any means
Said we gone rise above the top and that's by any means
I'ma grind until we living out all of our many dreams[Hook]
You could try hard, but you can't ignore me
Shout out to the ones who did it way before me
They love and they hate and then they love you more

[Verse 1]
Yeah, uh
Different day, same old story
Got money on my mind, nothing more important
Mindset of a kid raised in apartments
Fuck forty and a mule, I need a bigger portion
Parked in front of a crib, looking for some dry
Dealing with the bullshit on the other side
Of the grass in the past, I would run and hide
But I can't kill any time, it's career homicide
Uh, gotta show 'em all who the best
In the motherfucking building like an architect
Doing the most, I could never give em' less
Now take a look around, I'll be here when no one left
Bitch, I promise

[Hook]
You could try hard, but you can't ignore me
Shout out to the ones who did it way before me
They love and they hate and then they love you more
That's the way it goes, that's the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it...

[Verse 2]
Goes, on the side where I came from
Live by the gun, die by 21
Thank God I'm alive and I made sum'
Out of nothing, niggas thought I was frontin'
Now they see me getting to it, doing what they said I wasn't
Gotta have a little patience, baby, why the hell you rushing?
I gotta play my cards, even when they think I'm bluffing
Heading to the top, can't see nobody above me
Can you feel the pressure, can you hear the message?
I'm trying to stay clean but the shit been getting messy
If you're looking for me I will be right where you left me
Put that on my city, that I'm bout' to bring it back
Bitch I promise

[Hook]
You could try hard, but you can't ignore me
Shout out to the ones who did it way before me
They love and they hate and then they love you more
That's the way it goes, that's the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it...[Hook]
I tell her, don’t stop, keep it going
So fly, no luggage, baby carry on

Keep doing what you doing

[Verse 1]
‘Cause ain’t nobody fly like you
Like what I see, got a birds eye view
You’re what I’ve been waiting for
2×2, got me all wrapped up like Erykah Badu,so
Drama free, got no luggage, go on carry on
Smile shine bright like a canary stone
Heels on, walking through this lobby like a runaway
Then I’m on to your game, can I come play
Just rolled up, going for the high score
Full attention girl you something that I can’t ignore
Live a life that these other lames can’t afford
There’s a target on your ass, and I'm aiming for it

[Hook]
I tell her, don’t stop, keep it going
So fly, no luggage, baby carry on
Carry on, go on carry on
Drop it down and take it to the moon
Don’t stop, keep it going
So fly, no luggage, baby carry on
Carry on, go on carry on
Keep doing what you doing
I can see you on now
You on that new shit
I see you on that new shit
I see you on that new shit
Just keep it true
And I’ll never confuse it

[Verse 2]
It’s more than the physical
Everything you do is so original
Make all these other bitches look invisible
Dressed up, every night is your fashion show
Got tens all around from the panel
Swear that you jump right out of the style channel
Can’t nobody in here see you like
Camo will never show it all off
Just a sample. Came through
Heels Giuseppe, carry on Louie
Go ahead show 'em how to ball, Paul Mooney
Team bougie, you ain’t gotta hide
First class fly, Welcome to the club Mile High

[Hook]
I tell her, don’t stop, keep it going
So fly, no luggage, baby carry on
Carry on, go on carry on
Drop it down and take it to the moon
Don’t stop, keep it going

Just keep it true

Only somebody you love could make you feel like this 
Take it from somebody who knows
Les

[Verse 1]
I'm having dreams, my vision is so elaborate
Cause we went from not having to really having it
Now we having it - I can't believe its happening
To think it all started from us talking and laughing and
I remember when we first met - what's your name?
Instagram snapshots in a picture frame
Now what's better than anything you can think of?
When we make love
Your Guiseppe high heels in a mink rug
Pinot noir in a glass as we slow dance
This is romance at its best I'm dressed in Brioni
You had a salad I had the rigatoni
And you told me I'm your one and only
Had me feeling like a real Don Corleone
Clark Gable at the dinner table
And you my Scarlett O'hara
In that dark mascara baby smile for the camera

[Hook]
Only someone you love
Could make you hurt so bad, feel like you died for a minute (2x)

[Vamp]
We hold hands then we slow dance
Thought we had a love affair but we broke plans
We wrote plans then we broke plans
Now your heart feel crushed like a Coke can 
Hold hands then we slow dance
Thought we had a fairy tale but we broke plans
We wrote plans then we broke plans
Now your heart feel crushed

[Verse 2]
So perfect in those Louboutins
Slow dancing with no music on
Please baby be my Newton-John
Cause it's Saturday night and I'm the new Travolta
You looking so right through that lens Minolta
Woman of style, class, grace, taste and culture
And blessed by genetics, I meant when I said it
Girl you can get it, feel good when you let it burn

[Hook]

[Vamp]One time for the one time
Yeah

Contemplatin this coalition
Nah - we coo nigga, need no addition
It's 3S, til my feet stretched
Get a XD to yo V-Neck
Like fuck that shit you talkin bout
Gon walk it out, Bitch we next

[Hook]

So you think you the man of the year huh?
Well that ain't what they sayin' over here bruh
Somebody tell em get the fuck from round me
You ain't with the gang, then you clowns can't get near us
Consolidate, we makin moves at a solid rate
You pussy niggas comin round, tryna find a way (No!)
Takin notes on how we operate
No room for new niggas, cause we shut em down right out the gate

[Verse]

I can't trust a fuckin soul, but shit - who really can in these days
I'm bussin rounds, you come around on bullshit with yo sneak ways
Man i tell ya, in KC, on mob shit like It-talia
Keep a 2 by 4 by 5, out here plankin niggas -
What the lick tell - yall done drove me insane
Was a slave in the north pole , now im outta my brain
Couple yo homies in caskets, and me? ain't even been to the range
Shame, Damn - yo dame? Dont mistake her for the "I Do" type
I got Coke Cock, and Crack lines - im everything that she do like
West Side, my division
Ridin round, politicin
Yo bitch push my campaign, so i'll throw her D like a politician
I run shit, no propostions
No love for the opposition
Burner ready in back, for them niggas playin them pot positions
Man this shit so second nature, my head on so damn tight i could build a legislature
Nigga, WILSON on my back til i meet my fuckin maker
Trip my moms around the globe til ain't nowhere else I can take her

[Hook][Intro: Ab-Soul]
Look at me king
Look at me king
Soul
Kaylin on the couch sleeping
She wake up she gonna be like damnnnn

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Come and spar with a titan
If you ain't knew it's true I'm Zeus and I marvel at lightning
What a marvelous sight, know the thought is enticing
Flow stupid like 50 Tyson don't trip with 50 Cent
I beat em all like Tyson, that's no coincidence
Ab-Soul, don't forget the hyphen, I might throw a fit
You think I lived in the Salvation Army but all it is
Is that we got a new 2Pacalypse Now
When? Before the apocalypse
Wow, how do you come up with this?
If you behind Ab, then maybe you can stomach this
Who could fuck with it?
I know you got a dick but use your head, bruh
They sleeping on me by a colony of bed bugs
Cut from a different cloth and no one knows my thread count
My mind is like a sword, you'd swore I'd have a hair cut
Soul and Budden, no discussion
Joe, you know it's nothing
Wrote the score, and then I scored, metaphor, and 1

[Hook]
I don't know about you, hey, I don't know about them
I just do what I do, they just do what they can
They be hating on the man, with a knife in their hand
Cut from a different cloth, cut from a different cloth
All these niggas on my dick, all these bitches on my balls
Cut from a different cloth, cut from a different cloth
Middle fingers to the fakers, middle fingers to em all

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Yall can hold the applause
I just did what these other niggas was scared to do
Tell me life is hard, I'll ask what the fuck do you compare it to?
Quarter on the loose, I'm blessed enough that I can spare a few
Told me I'd be dead, the fact I'm breathing is a miracle
Yall got Gollum, listening to all these dudes that yall call lyrical
Excluding under conclusion
That you young and you dumb if that's how they appear to you
I'd be lying if I said your words ain't bother me
Be lying I ain't think it was trickery or reverse psychology
I came in on Rakim, watch yall take the bar, yall lowered it
Won't stay in line like a battered wife, ain't too many spots yall can go with it
How long yall gonna febreeze manure and think the fans won't notice it?
Nah, I ain't get angrier, but the chip on my shoulder did
Not to gloat, if I ain't one of the GOATS
Ya'll probably missed my track record
Either that or yall just ain't been keeping track of records
I just been waiting till that sentiment passed
Yall ain't even gotta be drunk to feel this genuine draft
I'm letting Benjamins stack
Shouldn't be hard to tell if the boy is potent
I'm the only time you'll see a madman be void of emotion
Cause they fear me in any cypher the hear me in
Only rapping with Soul for the outer body experience
So hats off, y'all fit for this, but y'all the type we laugh at
I'm way ahead, and when I aim for yours, something tells me he won't snap back
All I ever been was a outcast, this time in the moment, I moved past that
But the burner name is Jackson and your alias is Baghdad
It's not a game, try to execute
2K'D my old bitch, know I keep a ex to shoot
If anyone tried to do the math they'd probably be mad as fuck
Said I'd never amount to shit, now they trying to add it up

[Hook][Verse 1: Wale]
Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya
I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking about no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you whats better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or temporary forevers
Shorty get it together
Diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'till you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If its not it baby, hope its progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby, no more talking baby

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples damn my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh uhh
Sex all night, couple shots of Ciroc
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG them other niggas fell off
Baby girl I just wanna see you well off

[Hook: Drake]
Call me crazy -- shit, at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, thug passion
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated
Balmain, rich denim, out Vegas
French Riviera baby girl lets take a trip
I'mma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission hopefully you'll learn a lesson
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk
She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Wale]
Something about her probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on a fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won’t ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you, let me see, show me proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying eat, we don’t need a spoon

[Hook][Fabolous]
Shawty so cold, pussy winter fresh
Reservations to eat and you’re my dinner guest
Shawty cleaned up nice, never been a mess
Could take a little pain, I see them tattoos in her flesh
But I ain’t try to hurt her, ‘cause i’ve always been the best
I’m making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest
Sex excellent, get a hundred when I test
I’m a fan of her talent, so i’ve always been impressed
Sex in the city on my black satin sheets
Wet as Hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets
Lid a few candles like my power hadn’t reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn’t reached
Bitch so bad know her parents went through hell
Smart mouth when we argue, you would swear she went to Yale
I wanna touch her, not using my hands
Make her dance without using the bands

[Chorus: Cassie]
Call me crazy, shit, at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
Know is easy to get caught up in the morning
When you say ‘cause you’re mad and you take it all back
Then we fuck all night till things get right
Then we fuck all night till things get right

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
The club popping but she ain’t trying go there
Her friends know where she going every time she tell them “nowhere”
I’m the only one that get up in the vip
My money grown, baby, ain’t no need to see id
Slide a some just to come through, host money
At least niggas know you’re getting through the most money
Club my place, you wear what you wanna wear
But you’re overdressed if you’re wearing underwear
I turn up, couple js to burn up
Couple spice to hide out, now let that playlist right out
Where I live on sunday, her place monday
Her hand in my pants, call that Al Bundy
Pull it out like a pistol, yo, kiss it on the balls like the dick the mistletoe
Tell her do the thing I like, best she listen, yo
Bad bitch good girl around the christmas, though

[Chorus: Cassie]

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Pussy sweeter than some fresh fruit
She gushing and I drink the best juice
I’m drinking till nothing left to
And she playing with herself, too
I be thinking about her all day
She perform like it’s Broadway
Yeah, we hop in the range, she off top wit' the brain
Got the windows down, broad day
Just look at her, spectacular
The one in stove, flip her like a spatula
Other niggas want her, but you see the niggas whack to her
Side bitch tripping ‘cause i’ll never get back to her
My bitch like bitches, but none of my bitches bad to her
She’s said "Trigga, why I never seen her with a bad bitch?"
Unless she’s meeting on these other bitches average
Hundred percent real while these bitches is plastic
Moroccan goddess, she walk like she need her ass kissed
Walk like she need her ass kissed
Diced pineapples, super fine at you
If she’s giving head, she’s throwing her mind at you
Fuck these other bitches, nigga, she don’t mind what you do
I just wanna watch, I ain’t taking time at you, dudes
Never faking, why they hella friend?
Keep it real with her, yeah, that’s what she ever wants
Somethin' 'bout to alchemy, she don't ever disappoint
London on the balcony, we’re about to smoke another joint
Miami on the yacht, she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock
Metaphoric bliss, shawty, you’re the shit
Couple days with her, man, that’s all I ever get
And she got a little sister, that’s what she ever with
Game like a nigga man, that’s all she ever speak
Montreal was our first time, swear pussy just like the first lines
Scars on my back, she left couple, spent a couple stacks, had her put a couple pair
Try to beg mine, my nigga out of bootie
Never retract statements, nigga, I’m never scared
Niggas be switching up, but nigga, I’m never weird
Back on another leer
I leave niggas here, all in another year
All in another lane, all in another gear
All of you niggas lame, all of your niggas here
Listen up, bitch niggas bitching up
I guess you’re doing what you’re supposed to
Let a real nigga hold you
Back to my baby girl though, I just need you in my world, yo

[Chorus: Cassie][Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm just doing me, doing my thing
Trying to be rich put on for my team
We some Wu-Tang niggas cash get the cream
I'm trying to turn my dreams into a reality
I keep a small circle cause these niggas ain't loyal
A young trill nigga living inside of the moment
Inside a lost mind, everything's quite fine
I got my whole team with me & they down to ride
Girls down to roll yeah they trying to go
Back to the crib just to get a glimpse of how we roll
She say she love a nigga really man i don't know
She probably telling other niggas that on that low
I don't like to fall deep in so we just play wicked games like The Weeknd
She want that old thing back
I tell her fall back and baby just relax but

[Hook:Drake]
Call me crazy shit at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right[Intro] Diceddddd!
Baby girl look at the course, We have taken
For me it's filled, With regrets and mistakes
I miss putting, That smile on your face
I still remember them times, I had my hands on your waist
Now you're gone, And everything's outta place
Half the time, I don't think about the shit
That I say, Them emotions
I coulda swayed a different way, Cause when I said what I said
It was like catchin' a case, I still remember
Biting on your flesh, Kissing on your neck
And making Nala Wet, We were fresh
And to be real, I want it back
Cause a nigga can't relax, I be thinking bout you
And can't breathe, Asthma attack
I know it was a lotta shit, That people had to say
But it was me and you, At the end of the day
You like a movie in my mind, You're always on play
I still love you, And just wanna hug you
I remember being on yo couch, I would always bug you
It wasn't all about the sex, But I wanna make 1 thing clear
You damn sure looked good, In your one love underwear
The way we made each other feel, No other can compare
The first time I met cha, I didn't sweat cha
But when we started talking, The conversations were a pleasure
You had on ya all blue, Uniform for ya health class
And I was just tryna sell herbal, Tryna make cash
You showed me a lotta shit, Like how to be patient and care
Its ironic we were so close, And now we're nowhere near
I started to call you my Lioness, Cause I finally found my Queen
And now everything confusing, It ain't all what it seem
Drinking on the regular, Just to make it go away
I still got that note, I look at it everyday
September 23rd, It made me a better man
I think about you, And I hope that you understand
I know that you the one, And baby girl
I want you back, New Year New Us
That could be the motto, Cause then I can put down the bottle
You always look beautiful, I asked for no makeup
Cause I loved the way you looked, True beauty when you wake up
I'm just playing the cards I was handed, I treat you like the joker
Cause I wanna hold you closer, And I never wanna play you
With you I wanna see the other side, Of the rainbow
The pot of gold, I still see myself with you
Truth be told, And how its been lately
Everything's been kinda cold, But every King
Need a Queen, And you fit the mold
Jump over them hurdles, I know you can
Cause baby girl, You the bomb Afghanistan
They say love hurts, But losing you kills
Was addicted to that love, No over the counter pills
I use to give you goosebumps, Give yo body the chills
And trust me baby girl, This king still will
We can use each other as shields, I loved swimming in yo ocean
Like a nigga got gills, But dis was something
That I had to say, I still see us at
The end of the day, To me its no other way[Verse: JP]
Uh, uh
Two weeks ago, shots in the ghetto
Wasted ammo for a fuckin' little dough
Had the yellow tape, caution written black
Three kids dead, but one survived, crap
Killer on crack, tackled by a pack
Rack city bitch leads to dead city bitch
Came up to the kids: "Gimme your bills"
Took out all they bills, shoot them up for thrills (bang bang)
A guy off his pills, run off to the hills, uh
Before the last angel was about to spit his will
Rammed to the floor, left them boys to rot
Fucked up, lesbian sister
No more parents they decided to ditch her
Got to make 'em dinner, play the babysitter
Every night she got a fever, uh
Every night she got a fever, uh
This some serious shit, now you good, brrah
Think you got problems livin' in the hood, hah
But you should think about these kids instead of your wood and your trees
And your shit and your smoke and bitch and your joke and you, shh
I ain't jokin' with you
I ain't jokin' with you
True story, real city, C.Crew bitch

[Verse 2: JP]
I don't mess around, but my heart is broke
Spittin' this shit and you boys still walk
Away you run away far, cause you are scared
But you ain't scarred, means you ain't prepared
For the things, that JP said: "I wanna be a friend
Let you know life's sick unless your a dick"
And you trick chicks, it's your trade
Get the hottest blonde, and then say, you're a made man
Ah
AV to the H, I gotta rep my fuckin' city
Kind of weird, own friends, always sayin' screw me
'Til they see me in a movie
And the girls wanna do me
They got boobies and boobies
But they want sex and rubies
Ah, life's a disease, life's a disease
I wanna move far away and become japanese
Eat sushi, read mangas painted with manganese
Vintage life, away from these problems I can't fix
All I can do is rant of stupid politics
I'm too young, I'm too fierce
Got sick kicks, and a sick wrist, fuck
There I go again
There I go again, you see
There I go again
Materialistic men, shit
No, no, girl
Don't pull the trigger on yourself
Please, no, shit[Verse 1]
Ughh, She got me fucking hypnotized
I can't believe I got a bad bitch on my mind
She rooting for the Lakers, I'm with the Cavaliers
I wana throw it back, And run my fingers through her hair
To my surprise, I really love her eyes
I love her everything, Legs, Hips, Shoulders, Thighs
No time for hesitation, Must get reacquainted
Never seen a chick like this one to my.. amazement
I thought I seen it all, Pretty bitch who kinda tall
At the mall,With Loon niggas who like to ball
Yeah, I think I got a shot, No whiskey, No alcohol
Stale Jokes, Crack em all as she relaxing & slacking off
I know you love the hero, Cheapus you ditch the zero
Talk to all ya' friend to be honest they ain't saying zero
Nemo, I wana be with you till the worlds finito
If anything happens, I will always wana be your hero

[Hook]
Call me crazy -- shit, at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we Talk all night til things get right
Then we Talk all night til things get right

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wana take ya on a date
I think I see that special red long string of fate
Its been a long chase, I still see my trace
Of other girls I fucked with, On the second date
No feelings right? Just straight dealings right?
IoA Ima take you on a fucking flight
Its not just for a night. I promise you, Its a promise I made from me to you
Ha,Don't worry I'm preserving it
Every smooth flight has a little bit of turbulence
Ugh, I can't believe I'm doing this
I don't write every pretty bitch a song, In case you wondering
But you're Special, When I look at you
I see a cup full of water, And its all for you
Don't need it boo, We only in the desert
I will give you my heart till forever and ever

[Hook]
