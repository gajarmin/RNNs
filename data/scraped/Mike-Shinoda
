[Hook]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Mike
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Makin' a story, makin' sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin it up, let's go

[Verse 2: Tak]
Who the hell is he anyway?
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' 'em star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin' raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin' for someone's help, to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

[Verse 3: Ryu]
This is twenty percent skill
Eighty percent fear
Be a hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, "Name Of The Game"
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
I like bleach man, why you have the stupidest verse?
This dude is the truth, now everybody givi'n him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin' with S. Dot!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ryu]
They call him Ryu The Sick
And he's spittin' fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
Been a fuckin' nihilist porcupine
He's a prick, he's a cock
The type woman want to be with, and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin', patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

[Verse 5: Tak]
Tak
He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep askin' him, "Was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?"
No, he's livin' proof, got him rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doin', give a hundred percent

[Verse 6: Mike Shinoda]
Forget Mike
Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

[Hook x2][Intro: Linkin Park & Jay-Z]
Yeah, Thank you thank you thank you, you're far too kind!
Whoo! Aha, uh, whoo, yeah! ready? whoo!
Whoo, Whoo

[Hook: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh uh uh uh
Now what the hell are you waitin foo-oor!!!
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

(Get 'em Jay)

[Verse One]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for THESE GENERATIONS!

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So motherfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

[Verse 3]
Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure, of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertoe, just caught in the undertoe
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertoe, just caught in the undertoe
And every second I waste is more than I can taaaakkee!!

[Hook 2]
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've, become so nuuuuummmbbb!
(Can I get a encore? Do you want more, more, more, more)
I've, become so nuuuummmmbb!
(So for one last time I need y'all to roar!
One last time I need y'all to roar!)[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said "Some days I feel like shit
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit,"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long
And, I find myself tryna stay by the phone
Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up I don't have much to say
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
You know the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Hallowe'en with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way
You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?"

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For while you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

[Hook]

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
When you made me that initial batch of songs, I was like, that's the shit right there
Holla![Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uhh.. yeah
He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes
Everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it
He mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box but he can't remember how to stop, it
Uhh, so he continues to watch it
Hoping that it'll give him somethin that he can box with
Or how the locksmith, see the box as, locked in the box
Ain't got the combination to unlock, it
That's why he watch-es, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might show him
What to take off the locks with
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it
As the doctors jot it all down, with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental, like that

[Hook: Jonah Matranga] + (Lupe)
And he never lies (he never lies, he never lies, uhh)
And he never lies (uhh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (he never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
He just sits, and listens to the people in the boxes
Everything he hears he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not comin out the box he blocks it
See he loves the box and hope they never stop it
Anything the box tell him to do, he does it
Anything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it in a box
When he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps
Cause he stays up to watch it, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might get stolen
And that's the last of the boxes
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it
As the doctors jot it all down, with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental, like that

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
(Anything at all..) He never lies
Uhh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start

[Hook]

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco]
(Anything at all.. anything at all..)
Uhh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
{*repeats and fades as Jonah ad libs*}[Verse 1]
Tearing me apart
With the words you wouldn't say
And suddenly tomorrow's
A moment washed away
Cause I don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting
For something we won't find

[Chorus]
The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over
The scars begin to fade
We said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade
The final masquerade

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted
The secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted
The truth I couldn't speak
Cause I can't see forgiveness
And you can't see the crime
But we both keep on waiting
For what we left behind

[Chorus]

Final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

[Chorus][Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can’t help the fact that everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe this is real
So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here cause you're all that I got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

[Chorus X2][Intro: Mike's father]
"My father, came from Japan, in 1905
He was fifteen when he, immigrated from Japan
He, he, he worked until he was able to buy
To actually build a store"

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Let me tell you a story in the form of a dream
I don't know why I have to tell it but I know what it means
Close your eyes, just picture the scene
As I paint it for you; it was World War II
When this man named Kenji woke up
Ken was not a soldier, he was just a man
With a family who owned a store in L.A
That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did
Bacon and eggs with wife and kids
He lived on the second floor of a little store he ran
He moved to L.A. from Japan
They called him immigrant, in Japanese
He'd say he was called "iisei"
That meant first generation
In the United States when
Everybody was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the Japs
But most of all afraid of a homeland attack
And that morning, when Ken went out on the doormat
His world went black, cause
Right there, front page news
Three weeks before 1942
Pearl Harbor's been bombed and "The Japs are Coming"
Pictures of soldiers dyin and runnin
Ken knew what it would lead to
And just like he guessed, the president said
"The evil Japanese in our home country would be locked away"
They gave Ken,a couple of days
To get his whole life packed in two bags
Just two bags, he couldn't even pack his clothes
And some folks didn't even have a suitcase
To pack anything in
So two trash bags, is all they gave them
And when the kids asked mom, "Where are we goin?"
Nobody even knew what to say to them
Ken didn't wanna lie
He said, "The U.S. is lookin for spies
So we have to live in a place called Manzanar
Where a lot of Japanese people are"
Stop it, don't look at the gunmen
You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin
If you're gonna run or not
Cause if you run then you might get shot
Other than that, try not to think about it
Try not to worry 'bout it bein so crowded
Cause someday we'll get out, someday, someday

[Sample: Mike's aunt]
"Yeah, soon as war broke out the FBI came and
They just come through the house and, you have to come
All the Japanese have to go
They took Mr. Ni, the people couldn't understand
Why they had to take him because he's an innocent laborer."

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So now they're in a town with soldiers surroundin them
Every day every night, looked down at them
From watchtowers up on the wall
Ken couldn't really hate them at all
They were just doin their job and
He wasn't gonna make any problems
He had a little garden
Vegetables and fruits that he gave to the troops
In a basket his wife made
But in the back of his mind he wanted his family's life saved
Prisoners of war in their own damn country - what for?
And time passed in the prison town
He wondered if he'd live it down
If and when they were free
The only way out was joinin the Army, and supposedly
Some men went out for the army, signed on
And ended up flyin to Japan with a bomb
That 15 kiloton blast
Put an end to the war pretty fast
Two cities were blown to bits
The end of the war came quick
And Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life
With his kids and his wife, but
Then they got back to the home and
What they saw made him feel so alone
These people had trashed every room
Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors
Written on the walls and the floor
"Japs not welcome anymore!"
And Kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides
And just stood outside
He - looked at his wife without words to say
She looked back at him wipin tears away
And, said someday we'll be okay, someday
Now the names have been changed but the story is true
My family was locked up back in '42
My family was there where it was dark and damp
And they called it an internment camp

[Outro: Mike's aunt]
"When we first got back from camp, uhh it was, pretty, pretty bad."
"I-I remember, my husband said, 'Ohh we're gonna stay 'til last.'
Then my husband died, before they closed the camp."[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they
They told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time
But little did we know

[Verse 1: Mike and Chester]
Today, I looked for a sign
With flames in my hands
A line in the sand
Between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall
But little did you know

[Chorus: Chester]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You’ll get what’s yours and face your crime
You'll tell them give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine

[Verse 2: Mike]
I had never been a coward
I had never seen blood
You had sold me an ocean
And I was lost in the flood
We were counting on a leader
We were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation
And we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper
We were waiting on a wire
So we never saw it coming
When you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation
And you can try to ignore
But when the time comes calling
Yeah, you are gonna get yours

[Chorus]

[Instrumental + Bridge]
And so today, your truth has come
You’re gonna pay for what you’ve, pay for what you've done
You’ll get what’s yours, you’re out of time
And you will give me back what’s mine
Give me back what’s mine
Give me, give me back what's mine (x2)
What's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine
What's mine, what's mine
Give me back what's mine

[Outro: Mike]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they
They told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time
But little did we know[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
So what'cha waiting for?
Anticipating more
While you debate
What it can take to instigate a war
Yeah, I've been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say
They didn't say before

But you could never see it
Your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe
But this is take a shot time
While you're waiting for a purpose
I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like
"One, two, three, four"

[Chorus: Page Hamilton]
And if I do what you demand
(You say) You’ll let me understand
(You say) You’re gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say) I’ll have no debt to pay
(You say) I’m gonna get what I deserve

[Hook: Chester Bennington]
Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing, all for nothing

[Verse 2: Mike]
Kick back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya'
I really don't know ya'
You talk but let me show ya'
Where to put your paranoia
You’re joking, I don’t have a half a sucker bone to throw ya
I’m disgusted, wonder what could’ve made ya tuck your tail below ya

And no, I'm not your soldier
I'm not taking any orders
I'm a five-star general; infantry controller
Need a lesson? Let me show ya'
Have you checking your composure
While I make you step to it like
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Page]
If I do what you demand
You'll let me understand

[Hook: Chester]

[Interlude]
[Mike] "We're too far"
[Brad] "I don't think we're too far"
[Brad] "What about the heavy shit there?"
[Mike] "The heavy shit right there?"[Apathy]
I'll break ya brain cells off at the stem your status is stupider
Ap' is a nuclear blast, heart blacker than Lucifer
I could sit and write a list of all the shit I would do to ya
Head so big, I rest my fitted cap on Jupiter
You ain't built like this, you a soft carbon copy
A care bear compared to a auto-box rotty
For raps like crack I supply to the blacks
Drop pipes, cop mics, say good-bye to your rocks
I'm a motherfuckin star, the status of John Lennon
Y'all are ordinary people, singin' to John Legend
Write a track dissin' Ap'? Better X that out
I don't play that, like rap in a redneck's house
I could have ya brain cells spinnin quicker than Sprewell's
Ya female e-mailing me all ya details
I don't dig up dirt, I shake the Earth
And I never say names, I wouldn't waste a verse
Off of the top I'm hot, and when they dare me to write
Prepare to carry a mic to a burial site
I'm a pioneer fuckin' up stereotypes
I snatch chains as a kid, made you carry ya bikes
I got an addiction to spitting shit is heroin-like
Story teller speak of hell and the American plight
Money blower, funny though it seems embarrassin' right?
Rock shows, blow the do' on a pair of Air Nike's
All Night!

[Tak]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yo
You know the rules, I cruise with a tough band
You in the fuckin closet with brooms and a dustpan
I clean sweep ya fleet, body softer than gelatin
Now you on the mic, yeah right my life in ya skeleton dummy
I'm in the place, you can tell when it's bloody
I freakin', pay for ya face grade and mail you the money
I'm ready I'm willin' to watch, spy on seven that flinch
Let's see if I don't kill 'em in five seconds or less
I keep comin' back like rashes on an infant
You don't wanna chance to clash with the magnificent
Seven of us, it's heaven but never enough
So I tighten the vice grip, so his head'll get crushed
Look, I'm out of sight now, deep in this music
Leavin' 'em upside-down, fiendin for new shit
Ribkat it's the roll power creep in the booth quick
Blow a hole in ya back, just to eat off a soup dish
You bitch

[Celph Titled]
Yo!
The Demigod stands for killa's
More specifically we Deadly Entertainers Maniac Ignorant GODzilla's
And we, never took the route them other crooks took
Cuz we kept recipes for human flesh in my mother's cookbook
Get souffled in more ways then ten
Celph Titled flow is chokin' the wind, my favorite pastime's soakin' in sin
The most accurate sharpshooter with no scope
Shoot with my left and watch you all die from secondhand smoke
I'm reppin' my fam SO, You better act cool
My soul will make a Ouija Board jump up and slap you dummy
You not thinkin' smart
I bust so many blamma's and blicka's that I should start a rock band called
"Blink & Spark"
Sinkin' sharks with no harpoons, my arsenal
Is sawblade carbon tools slidin' ya coffin through
Apathy's insane and I'm the same as my brother
I'm like a circus show sniper, I aim for the juggler
Catch a case and before the judge can slam down the gavel
The whole room duck and hide from grenade shrapnel
These rap verses I be breezin' through
Cuz I'm like a celebate, under oath, Un-Fuckin-Believable

(behind turntable scratchin) x2
Demigods, Fort Minor
"Ya Ya heard of us"
Styles of Beyond
"Ya Ya heard of us, the murderous"[Common]
Uhh, yeah, yo
We 'bout to take y'all to the tip, to the crib
Let's do it Mike (yeah)

[Hook: Mike Shinoda]
Back home (back home) everybody's searching for something
But all they can find's a whole lot of nothing
Back home (back home) ain't nobody hopin and prayin
Cause they feel like nothin can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact
That life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
Cause ain't a damn thing free back home (back home)

[Common]
Back home, they holla "disciple" and "blackstone"
Same block they freebase, yo we trapped on
Where our grandmothers marched, the guns clap on
There's liquor stores, beauty supplies and rap songs
I travel the world just to come back to it
The crib got a lot of soul like black music
I'm attached to it, in many ways this city raised me
And gave me the drama, honor and bravery
The streets seem hollow, when I go to Chicago
It's cheap wine and sorrow, times is hard to swallow
In search of God's tomorrow, I borrow
Words from the Bible, and use them for survival
Gangs rival, signs painted on walls like hiero-glyphics
I tell them that this is all tribal
Used to do dirt, shorty's goin through the same cycle
And trials like Michael, tryin not to stay idle - back home

[Hook]

[Ryu]
Back home, it's not Compton but close, the same problems exist
And the pain throbbin and folks are so common
It don't, really bother us much, we just swallow it
Uh, crack the bottle and smoke
Hope tomorrow somethin magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
But the chances of it actually happening's kinda slim
Back home, we get the good life at a glimpse
In the form of a rap star, drug dealers and pimps
I'm back, home

[Tak]
Back, home - I try my best to keep it together
It's cold, like the Windy City streets of December
I pace back and forth, lookin for the courage to shine
But can't tap the source, need somethin to nourish my mind
I know we all lose quite a bit in life, only to gain some
Life or the dark winding roads we came from
But I move with the night so I'm used to the shade
And never lose sight, bringin truth back to the game

[Mike Shinoda]
Back, home - we've got a lot of shit on our minds
We're always behind on somethin cause there's not enough time
And we're non-stop, bottom line, doin what we gotta do
To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
Back home there's people callin us hopeless
People tryin to tell us all we need is some focus
But, focus, focus is overrated
Cause you see every blemish and mistake and can't change it
Back home is Alvarado, K-Town and J-Town
Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know
Where figures shiver, livin right in the litter
Where kids write bigger, right inside the L.A. river
On the concrete, a symbol of our everyday way
It's that color and concentration over heavy and gray
And by the time the ink dries on this page
I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay (yeah)

[Hook]

[Outro: Common]
We takin it back home y'all
Yeah, it's Common Sense (yeah)
My guy Mike (what up Com'?)
S.O.B. (uh-huh) yeah
This time we rotate, it's good music (ha ha ha)
Hip-Hop (it don't stop) yeah, uhh
It's home for me baby, yeah[Hook]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

[Ryu]
I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like funny games, keep playing'em
I'm just saying, think back then, you was like one of the same
On the right track, but I was on the wrong train
Just like that, now you gotta face the pain
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play
And in your brain like a maze you can never escape the rain
Every damn day is the same shade of grey

[Mike]
Hey, I use to have a little bit of plan
Use to have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right out of my hand
Now I don't really even know who I am
Yo, what do I have to say, maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see but it's not gonna happen with me

[Hook]

[Mike]
Back then, I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But you proved to me unintentionally
That you would self destruct eventually
Now I'll be thinking like the mistake I made doesn't hurt
But it's not gonna work cause it's really much worse
Then I thought, I wished you were something you were not
And now this guilt is really all that I got

[Tak]
You turn your back and walk away in shame
All you got is a memory of pain
Nothing makes sense and you stare at the ground
And hear my voice in your head when no one else is around
So what do I have to say, maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see but it's not gonna happen to me

[Hook] x2

I'll do what I have to do
(You're on your own now believe me)
Whatever happens to you
(You're on your own now believe me)
What do I have to say
(You're on your own now believe me)
Is not gonna happen to me
(You're on your own now believe me)[Intro: Lupe (with Holly Brook and Tak of Style of Beyond)]
Uh!
MS, Lupe
You know I'm a fan man, I'm a real fan
(Gonna be somebody)
Feel real honoured to be up in here
(Gonna be someone)
You know what I'm sayin'
They had to bring out the expensive mics for this one
(Gonna be somebody)
You know what I'm sayin'
The....seven thousand dollar headphones for this one here
(Gonna be someone)
Know what I'm sayin'?
Come on
Talk to me!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is the story of them against us
Win or lose
Forcing your feet into someone else's shoes
Everybody's got something to say
That we ought to live their way
What we're doing's not okay
In this world everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of their neck
Got no respect, wait up a sec
You ever feel like the pressure's too much too take
Too much weight
Ladies, and, gentlemen
If anybody can hear me right now
Please shout back
We're not the only ones feeling so trapped
In a dream of somebody else, in fact
They got their heads full of some overblown scheme
Opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back

[Hook: Holly Brook and Tak of Styles of Beyond (Shinoda)]
Gonna be somebody
(For anybody telling me I can't)
Gonna be someone
(For anyone who told me I had no chance)
Gonna be somebody
(I'm telling you the time has come)
Gonna be someone
(And maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done)

[Verse 2: Shinoda]
We don't sleep to dream, we sleep to build stamina
Energy to do our thing, get your camera
Cause this ride is about to begin
Sit down, and buckle it in
Let me say it again
In this world
Everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck
Got no respect, wait up a sec
When I was young
They said the odds of making it were slim, to none
Ladies, and, fuck it
I'm tired of them saying the dream you have doesn't exist
Telling you you're worthless, saying you should quit
Basically telling you that you'll never be shit
Really they're pissed cause they'll never achieve
Some opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh
They gon' think you're crazy mumbling to yourself
In the basement all day uh-uh-uhin to yourself
My pops didn't dig it, was shoveling to myself
My boys used to get it, they dug it because they felt
My undertaking took me, I was making in my stealth
A wealth of rhymes of crazy, I would chuckle to myself
Then they went into the mental rolodex
See I'm know 'em by heart, like a brain in my chest
Then I took them to school where subjects was gettin' felt
Books under my seat, notebook laying on my desk
My teacher's like, "Mr. Jaco?" "Yes?"
"With all that knowledge, you ain't trynna go to college?
Be a lawyer or a doctor, get a whole lot of dollars?
Rather degrade women and glorify violence?"
"Well the work that works for me might not work for you
No homework, I got work to do."

[Hook]

[Outro: Mike]
And I'm finally done!
Yeah
This one goes out to those fantastic human beings that keep us down and hold us back
And give us fuel for what we do
Thanks[Verse 1: Chester]
I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and never say

[Chorus: Chester]
No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down, you push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down, you push it back down
No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down, you push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye

[Verse 2: Chester]
You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and take and take
Fuck it, are you listening

[Chorus ×2]

[Bridge: Mike]
Floating down as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
And floating up, you pass us in the night
A future gazing out, a past to overwrite
So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go[Green Lantern:]
...invasion!

[Mike:]
Hey Ap, why don’t you do the uh…the intro on this shit?
[Apathy:]
Yo Apathy, Fort Minor, Styles Of Beyond, Demigodz

[Mike:]
Here we go

[Verse 1 Apathy:]
Yo, rappers like heavy metal and ghettos
Guns, metals and ammos
I pistol whip Tony and fuck Meadow Soprano
A cat who sells them bugs but tell them thugs
They don’t know to carry more heat than welding gloves
I walk amongst the gods, keep my head in the clouds
Oh we show groupie love, getting head in the crowds
Put it in girls mouth blast off like NASA
The master of nastiness transform a classy bitch into
A little sheen freak sadomasochist
Dastardly bastard of rap so disastrous
Spitting, healed a cripple like Christ the miraculous
And fights my savageness, turns punks, pacifists
The police clock Ap like there he go
Always on the watch because I use to carry blow
Always lock her down but I never marry hoes
Bury foes when the flows comes through your stereo

[Verse 2 Mike:]
There we go flipping up a predictable verse
It’s a curse to burst words like Turrets on purpose
Put the verb like a backhand reject perverse as it is
I can't stop and its making me nervous, ok?
Get me on a track and I'm cracking
Packing up a backpack full of tracks on some CDs
Be me, fuck that not like me
To bite me you need to be you times ninety
I got schemes and a team so hyped we
Get on a scene make a scene on the nightly
Say what I mean, whether mean or politely
Living the dream in some clean white Nike's
Or DC's, I'm not giving a shit
Fuck the words that you heard and the lips that they hang from
I stay banging to bang, bang drums and hanging you lames
And the same no names gangs you came from
I don’t got an excuse, just talking the truth
I'm fucking awesome when I'm rocking the booth
And I stay ready with hot bloc rocking abuse
Y'all are really not stopping us dude, yeah Tak, get em'

[Verse 3 Tak:]
It started off get on over and hit the galaxy
Now we're moving them over they're crowing me as the Cali king
Anything tossed on my fuse getting chewed up
With a quota six and little good weight, too much
Going to get smacked in the face with aluminum bats
Your fucking raps as good as me, Boo-booin'
I said I was rude, step in the shoes, you don't believe me
You can ask Devin the dude how I strip down the bitch clown stand in my socks
Whip the mother fuckers ass like I'm Cannibal Ox
You want to be stoned? beat him with a basket of rocks
Get your shit flowing feeling for the casket to drop
You know them S.O.B.'s never get the record to stop
Breaking the habit is impossible what happened to Tak
He's unleashed, he's a beast so Sledge hand me a bloc
Party, whats your corpses posing for, the camera was shot, huh
Styles and Machine Shop, necklace fly
No wonder everyone is so petrified
I said, Styles and Machine Shop, necklace fly
No wonder everyone is so petrified
You hear that?[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I used the deadwood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea
And poured it out in an ocean of debris

[Chorus 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

[Verse 2: Mike]
We held our breath when the clouds began to form
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
And in the end we were made to be apart
In separate chambers of the human heart

[Chorus 2: Chester]
I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
It's in the blackened bones
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

[Chorus 3: Chester]
I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
The blame is mine alone
For bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve

[Outro: Mike]
I use the dead wood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies[B-Real:]
I was an outcast, outsider, trouble maker
A lost soul, outta control in danger
Didn't have a care in the world, my feeling were numb
Never showing emotion, it's easy for some
I don't know how it happened, how I got to this point
But I needed a way out, I was stuck in a ploy
I needed another path or I'd self destruct
I was down on my luck, my head was so fucked
A menace rollin' the streets is what I was
Holdin' my heat and rollin' with the serious thugs
You couldn't tell me a thing, I was like my brother
Words went in one ear and out the other
Slangin' and bangin' with a chip on my shoulder
An insane, hit the brain certified street soldier
So close to the grave, you at an early age
Can't tell you the price I've paid

[Hook: Mike Shinoda]
Oh the sky overhead, it's like a canvas of grey
I don't know how much time I'll be given to stay
From the first spring to light 'til the end of the day
I'm just livin' my life 'til they come carry me away

[Sen Dog]
I've been there in LA nights in the block where I came up
My pops used to hate when we hanged with them bangers
Guess he knew one day that we'll become us
That's just how it is when you live where we come from
"Fight, don't run!" is the motto we live by
Get 'em on the ground and stomp a mind about ten times
Sure we was just kids back then
I had no remorse for what we did back then
Six of us, one call, we'd all pack in
Hit the strip, and go and get the shit crackin'
Gun wars and drug deals, I seen 'em happen
When I started losin' homeboys, I wasn't laughin'
I looked all around and seen none of 'em there
That's when I figured out that nobody cared
If we lived or die, we'll just get high and ride
And I wasn't gonna let this happen one more time

[Hook]

[B-Real:]
My mother would stand for me every step of the way
She did not judge me, she told me I'd win some day
When I was at my lowest, when I had no focus
She pulled me out the gutter, said I wasn't hopeless
Every night she prayed for me I was out on the street
Chillin' on the corner with the hand on my heat
Eyes open wide for the pigs and foes
It's an every day hazard when you hustle for dough
So many nights I didn't come home, she thought the worst
Maybe somebody shot me down without any remorse
Maybe I hurt somebody and I was stuck in a cell
Well I regret all those times that I put her through hell
When I reflect back on those days, my heart aches and
Everybody I lost or let down, I wish I could take it
All back and make it better but I can't, so I try to make amends
And be there through thick and thin

[Hook]

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Come carry me away
Come carry me away
Come carry me away
Come carry me awayYeah, go ahead and uh cue the special effects (laugh)

Man I love this rap game, mainly cause it's cool
To add a little spice to the life you've been through
Everyone exaggerates a tiny little bit
Make that shit sound more gangsta then it really is
You can't appear weak man, we wanna hear street
We wanna hear you spit your thug over this here beat
Don't take it as sarcastic, I can't get enough
I'm telling you, you can call my bluff
If it's not rough, Then I really don't need it
I'm not even ashamed; I got too much reality that's filling up my brain
So sell me on that product, I'm addicted to the game
Suck it up like a cigarette, light it up man

[Hook]
It's just like a cigarette it's something that I do
Once in a while but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I just wanna feel fucking cool)

Let me tell you something that I realized tonight
My hip-hop radio'ss like Marlboro light
They both telling stories and they sound about the same
Cigarettes say they safe, rappers claim they really bang
We don't care if it's true when we just lay the money down
We don't believe the words, we just love the way they sound
They're acting like we're idiots they're lying to our face
Maybe we are idiots, we buy it anyway
I'm running out to get the next rappers CD
Just sucking up the guns, drugs and misogyny
The same way that I suck up all the stories when I breathe
That little bit of death supposedly cancer free
And everything they say's got the truth twisted up
And twisted up's what I want man, I can't get enough
Cause even though we know it's all just a big bluff
We just light another up, what we don't give a fuck!!!

[Hook]
(It's just like a cigarette something that I do
Once in a while but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I just wanna feel fucking cool)
It's just like a cigarette something that I do
Over and over but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I just wanna feel fucking cool)

Man listen to my words, listen for a while
Lip service radio don't touch the dial
If you're in the car turn up the track man
Give your whole neighborhood some second hand rap, hey
Matter of fact man, listen for a while
Lip service radio don't touch the dial
If your in the car man turn up the track man give your whole
Neighborhood some second hand rap

[Hook][Intro] [Mike Shinoda talking]
Gentlemen and ladies. Please put down your expensive champange
It's about to get ugly in here. (Yeah. Set it off motherfuckers!) Let's go!
My name is Mike Shinoda. And with some help from my man Celph Titled
(You goddamned right!)
I would like to introduce to you from Styles of Beyond: Takbir!

[Verse One] [Tak]
Yeah, I'm here, put a sock in your mouth
You now rockin' with Styles
That's how we knockin 'em down
No other option around
Cause I'm just cockin' and POW!
Me and my popular pals
Don't make me hop in the crowd, stop jockin' about
We taking over and stomping all of your sports spiders
Cover and duck, and we shootin' straight out of Fort Minor
Roll with a pack of fifty
So when they get they gettin' shifty
I put a stamp on it and slap 'em with a flask of whiskey
You got your holster blazin'
Buzzin' with no sedation
I got a (gun cocks) and a party cap for both occasions
With something terrible seepin' into your stadium
Never perform solo, I'm freakin' sick in the cranium
Packin' 'em in, yeah, the ruler gets back
We're quick to
Crackin' ya shins with aluminum bats
Got the place going bananas and they pumpin' they fists
I'm tilt my brim to Los Angeles and jump in the pit

[Mike Shinoda]
What the fuck are you doing, man? You spilled my Cristal all over me

[Hook] [Celph Titled]
So raw, so rugged, so rough
Like a runaway train we're tearing the track up
We're at it again, we're ready to act up
So cover and duck, show us you're rockin' with us
Let's see a fist if you're rockin' with this
Let me see your fist if you're rockin' with this

[Verse Two] [Mike Shinoda]
From the start 'til the end, night until the dawn
It's that fight music cause right when it comes on
You just lose control of your elbows and fists
Fuckin' other disregard for your body in the pit
People are swinging limbs, swinging bottles and chairs
Throwin' lime, backin' motherfuckers up in the air
So back up, we got you wearing that Fight Club glare
Steady, tearing down the club cause you just don't care
It's the realest way to feel it when the speakers pop poppin'
You with it if you get it when that beat starts knockin'
And we kill it when get up on that mic, start rockin'
And you feel it when you hear it cause we're on non stoppin'
So ask a buddy or a friend if they know, no
We do it daily, never maybe, every show, show
Y'all want to get down? I'm ready to roll
Right now, y'all ready? let's get it, let's go!

[Hook] [Celph Titled]
So raw, so rugged, so rough
Like a runaway train we're tearing the track up
We're at it again, we're ready to act up
So cover and duck, show us you're rockin' with us
Let's see a fist if you're rockin' with this
Let me see your fist if you're rockin' with this
Let's see a fist if you're rockin' with this
Let me see your fist if you're rockin' with this
Ryu!

[Verse Three] [Ryu]
Yo, so now they notice me, rockin' over Shinoda beats
Makin' it crack like the extract in coca leaves
Hopefully labels love it, if not then fuck 'em
I'm cuttin' the break cables, ain't stoppin' at nothing
My hype is comin', murder for the price of a muffin
You think twice with a steak knife stuck in your stomach
I'm like "Who ever wanted whistle? I'll let you bring a pistol"
I'll put a verse on both wings like a stinger missile
Provoking people to bring it, I keep the weapons stable
I'll blow a fucking hole through it like a western bagel
Yeah, I talk tough and I rap ignorant too
Sick of me kickin' knowledge, getting crap on my shoes
I'm off my rocker, a psycho stalker
The girl called me David Beckham, she thought I was going to sock her
Nah, I'm the one to get it crackin', the plan works
Before I rock a show you gotta fax in the fans first
Ready? Let's go!

[Hook] [Celph Titled]
So raw, so rugged, so rough
Like a runaway train we're tearing the track up
We're at it again, we're ready to act up
So cover and duck, show us you're rockin' with us
Let's see a fist if you're rocking with this
Let me see your fist if you're rocking with this
Come on, Celph Titled!

[Bridge] [Celph Titled]
If it ain't raw, it ain't right, so get it right
We at it again, now to act up and start a fight
So cover and duck cause we runnin' a muck
No, cover and duck cause we about to erupt
Throw your motherfuckin' hands to the sky, sky
And make a fist if you want to get live, live
Throw your motherfuckin' hands to the sky, sky
And make a fist if you want to get live, live

[Outro] [Celph Titled]
Come on y'all! Yeah! You like that shit?
We had to get real Godzilla on 'em this time
Tak and Ryu, S.O.B., Celph Titled. M. Shinoda the Cobra Holder, Demigodz
That's how my crew do, shut the fuck up when Fort Minor's talking!R2-D2
I can't see you
Do you know Twiggy?
Here goes beaty beaty

Beaty-beaty-beaty-beaty-(breaks down laughing)
Uhhh
I'm a robot, bot, bot
Robot, bot, bot, bot, bot
And I won't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Because I'm a robot, bot, bot, botIf anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back
I'll tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

Yo, I don't care if you're a woman or a child or man
When I'm done everybody's gonna understand
Some rappers get mad when you say they're in a band
But, not me
Cause I really am
It's LP for your fucking information pal
So you can stop staring back over your shoulder now
You can't stop me mugging with that twisted brow
Concentrating on mine
You're wasting your time buddy
Erase that face
Replace the frown
Look at the ground
Look down
Quit fucking around
Now jeez, everyone's been so tightly wound
From the minute that we became the new menace in town
Could it be that these cool, contagious
Phrases sprayed aimless
Are making ya'll hate us?
Shit, you can hate 'til your face turns blue
Everyone else
Let me cut up a question for you

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back
I'll tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

Oh, there goes another one
Better call all your people in
Bury the body quick stupid
Show you where I’m coming from
Open up the cellar
To the pelican's bliss
With delicatessenal sitting 'til your skeleton splits
He sets us off now
Don’t know which direction is which
We all fell
Little weapons with consecutive hits
But that’ll be that
So never mind your battery pack
Cause in reality nobody gives a crappity-crap
Move over, before you get your flattery snatched
You tiny caterpillars act like you don’t have any sex
Hopping over the gums drilling holes in cavity caps
They’re full of shit to the root now
Pass me that Jack
On the rocks is Tak
Back on the block what?
Tapping your vest like I just happen to pop up
Trapped in a circle
And now he’s itching to box
But no way I’m ‘a stop
Until I’m waiting your snot pus

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back
I'll tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

I just say what I feel I don’t care if I’m black balled
Walk up in the label start waving a hack-saw
Hit the bathroom strip naked and jack-off
This white boy’s getting more gangster than Mac Mall
I’m in the crowd I’m feeding your fans roofies
Nope, that ain't a coke it’s a Vicodin smoothie
Yeah, acting boozy a thug like fuck it
Got a champagne taste with a bud light budget
Got a little-ass dick with some [something backwards] on it
So sick I could make a fucking maggot vomit
No Shit
Get the mic’s out
Kick it in gear
It’s Ludacris
All I needed was some chicken and beer
You better, roll out while the coast is clear
We've been hit with thick bottles and a broken chair
Bitch please you can leave with a couple of cracked teeth
Don’t pump me for the fame
I ain't crapped for six weeks / so

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back / I'll
Tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine[Instrumental][Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can’t help the fact that everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe this is real
So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here cause you're all that I got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

[Chorus X2][Hook 2X - Mike Shinoda]
These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home

Verse 1 - Mike Shinoda
Standing on a bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath
Trying to make it home without freezing to death
And my Grandfather's face is stuck in my mind
And how seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time
I should've brought a jacket
Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill
I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
Thinking laying in that box people look so still
At times like these you start thinking
Your first breath in and the clock starts ticking
I'm not trying to bum anyone out
Not trying to be dramatic, just thinking out loud
I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind
Some defence from the cold that I'm feeling outside
And for a minute, escape with some rhythm and rhyme
And get away from the grey just a bit at a time

[Verse 2 - Ryu]
Yeah
Kind of funny how this world can treat you
Like a freak in a sideshow, a carnival creature
Climbing out of cans, I'm a diamond in the sand
But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones
My life's like trying to swallow a pine cone
It's tough when you live fast just to die slow
Talk to dial tones, my dreams are far fetched
It seems, so I sleep underneath this park bench
I know it don't make sense, and I don't expect for you to know what it's like
Smoke, drink, piss, sniffing everything in my site, push rocks in the pipe
Lift off, I keep puffing 'til my lips turn white, And my chest gets tight
But who the fuck really cares, when you're so far left that even death looks right
All I can do is hope for the best and pray
That it gets a little better than yesterday

[Hook 2X - Mike Shinoda]

[Verse 3 - Takbir]
Yo
Pardon me, I think I'm next to earl
Too many problems going on, that's why I left my girl
Pack my backs and I travel with a pen and my notepad
They said I was broke and things that I don't have
But still, I try to find a way to escape
From all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
But now I'm breaking the mold, See I was patient and calm
Many sleep in the rain, but now I'm awake in the storm
Written my life in the short film, the rise and the fall
How I managed to scorch hills and climb the wall
Pound pavement, Aimless in this cold existence
Even though things are changing, I'm going the distance
Overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
To put it all behind me cause life still goes on
Now I'm much stronger and know where I stand
While lost souls search over and over again

[Mike Shinoda]
These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everybody's trying not to cry
Trying to get by and trying not to feel outta control
And if you look hard enough, sometimes you'll find
A place that might just remind you of home
But if it doesn't feel like home, You can do what I do
Just pretend you don't feel so alone (so alone, so alone...)

(Scratching...)
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home[Verse 1]
Tearing me apart
With the words you wouldn't say
And suddenly tomorrow's
A moment washed away
Cause I don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting
For something we won't find

[Chorus]
The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over
The scars begin to fade
We said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade
The final masquerade

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted
The secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted
The truth I couldn't speak
Cause I can't see forgiveness
And you can't see the crime
But we both keep on waiting
For what we left behind

[Chorus]

Final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

[Chorus][Intro: Tak]
Yeah, Ryu and Tak
Yeah, Ryu and Tak (S.O.B.)
Yeah, Ryu and Tak, Demigodz
Green Lantern, Scoop DeVille
This kid is only 17, man
He's about to be a problem

[Hook]
So let's get right to it and groove
It ain't nothin but a thing to get ya people to move
Gotta lovin the way we swing when we step on the scene
You know we kill it, goin all out, we about to {"G-g-g-g-g-get it!"}

[Ryu]
Yo, it's in my blood, I was born to spit it
The coroner has kept me warm through the storms of winter
Ignored the pain and struggle when it's time for dinner
We huddle together and grind, rain or shine
Survive the weather, forget about changin spinners
Throw me a bone, I'm just tryin to raise my litter
It made me bitter, eventually made me sicker
So when the heat's on we don't get pre-game jitters, uh-uh
We go to work man, diggin in dirt
We took 'em to church, we're checkin in some teenage strippers
Livin life by the seat of my pants and three-peated
We champs, undefeated we can't, lose ever
Whoever want it with us better roll with a camp
You trust to cover your ass when your asses can't
Huh, so bottom's up, here's one for the crew
Put some liquor in your gut and tell me what you wanna do, sing it

[Interlude: Ryu (Tak)]
S - for every sucker left behind
O - what they were yellin when I bust a rhyme
B - best believe when it's time to get it
We grind and jet cause we ain't got time to kick it, no!
(S - for the drunk sexy women)
(O - sippin Jack with some Pepsi in it)
B - best believe when it's time to get it
We grind and jet cause we ain't got time to kick it, no!

[Hook]

[Tak]
Wow, look at 'em now, their mouths are closed
We done came a long way since 2004
Spilled "Bleach" got the whole entire crowd exposed
The fumes leakin in the street, throwin down them 'bows, whoa
We on the job, the run with the mob
The fake fa?ades to get it just to make new large
I roll a, seven to nine just to break the yards
And step in your mind and unfold the great bizarre
Hit the kill switch, yeah, found my hitch
I'm on the pitcher's mound for now, it's me and Will Smith
Finally overseas, I sneak in the mattress
Ain't nothin like a sweet club freak with an accent
We out gettin bent makin dollar amounts
So if you with me let me see you raise your bottomless shots, say it

[Interlude]

[Hook]

[Holly Brook (Mike Shinoda)]
Gonna be somebody (for anybody tellin me I can't)
Gonna be someone (for anyone who told me I had no chance)
Gonna be somebody (I'm tellin you the time has come - like that)
Gonna be someone (and maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done)[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
The dude, he said that, like
When we were making the first Linkin Park record
He was like:
"Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like, I don't know...
Maybe you should just be a rock band."
You know what I mean, like, trying to change us
Like they signed us as an act like what we sound like
And then he's like:
"Oh I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard"

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Before the first song that you heard me on
There were people already tryin' to get me gone
Tellin' me to quit rapping
"Just play the keys"
That my band had a singer
They didn't need me
But my band had my back
So we did the tracks
Put out the album and the talk went flat
It was funny at first but then the humour faded
When some magazines printed that our label made us
We were to be good to be true
Some were saying ghost writers were writin' all that we do
So we had to disprove it
We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we're making this music
After that I made it a rule
I only do e-mail responses to print interviews
Because these people love to put a twist to your words
To infer that you said something fucking absurd
Oh, did I lose you at infer?
Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words?
People used to infer that we were manufactured
Now I've got the interviews on file
Which people said what
Which number to dial
So now every enemy screaming insanity
All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me
Bitch

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Can you believe that?
Like it's crazy, it sounds crazy right?
Like at this point, at this point you're thinking, you hear it out and you're like
"That guy was out of his mind"
But honestly that's what he wrote
Besides the fact that he wanted me to just play keyboard or whatever
He didn't want me to rap
He was like "Maybe Joe Hahn should, um
Wear a lab coat and a cowboy hat" on, like when we play
I swear to God he was crazy
And later on he claimed he wrote all our songs so that was really bad."
