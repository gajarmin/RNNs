[Hook: Kevin Gates & August Alsina]
I was tryna  get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I wanna pull up, head spin
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Full time father, full time artist
Asked God, he said "grind harder"
Learn from every time you ever fail
If it never fail just grind smarter
Iron sharpens, you the dagger
On they hindquarters and they all acting
Rap game, I'm a pallbearer
Kill me and get a call after
First look, it was all laughter
Kevin Gates, no small matter
Made men believe what they didn't believe
Dive in the crowd, no safety harness
Got in the booth, no safety on it
Aim and I shoot for the stars
At the awards I ain't win no awards
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Me and the woman I love on an air mattress
We share a cot, my hair nappy
Couldn't afford flights, no air travel
Stale Rice Krispies like sand and gravel
Our testament to what can happen
The moment you follow your heart
Keeping the faith even when it get dark
They say give up as I tell them "get lost"
Six weeks ago I just purchased a foreign
Most likely the one that you cannot afford
Right foot on the gas
Balenciaga be accelerating, I'm doing the dash
Chick that I'm with, shorty be doing her shit
And it's okay to say that she bad
Look to the right and I give her a glance
Pray to God we don't, pray to God we don't crash

[Hook]

[Bridge: August Alsina]
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
Don't play with the hustle, you eat or you starve
Don't mimic pretenders, just be who you are
Ain't never change, been like this from the start
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
Don't play with the hustle, you eat or you starve
Don't mimic pretenders, just be who you are
(Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired)

[Hook]

[Outro: Kevin Gates & August Alsina]
And I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired[Intro]
Murder For Hire
Bread Winner Association
Comission guys are it
We got it for the next two summers, nigga
Take her backseat watch this
It's Holiday Season, bitch
Money count don't stop
Foreign cars, bad bitches
Suitcase full of money
(Holiday Season)
Nigga I don't get tired

[Hook]
Money really make me feel like I could be somebody
When I pull up in that Benz, beaucoup freaks surround me
I was born with a plug who am I to lie
You know I let them fly like Puerto Rican Johnny
Money comin' to me ridin' round with duffel bags
Stacks of dirty money wrapped in beaucoup rubber bands
I was born with a plug who am I to lie
You know I let them fly like Puerto Rican Johnny

[Verse 1]
My bitch is Tahoe, this whip came equipped with Moscato
My driver be drivin' me around
Gunner and Boobie, my clique full of shooters look stupid
They sendin' them rounds
While I'm in bounds, awkwardly I got an ounce
Groupies be followin' me around
Want me the take off the rubbers, you dummy it's nothin'
You fuck with a few of my rounds
Britches ain't baggy, but my pants are saggin'
This Five Panel hat and I just turned it backwards
Somewhat eclectic I don't fuck with rappers
I'm not into swaggin' but they love my swagger
Your bitch is an animal, fuck from the back
And it's somewhat degradin' the way I behave with her
Want me to stay with her, I could just play with her hard
On her feelings won't kiss her, won't lay with her

[Pre-Hook]
Bitch I got paper to get
If I'm broke then I'd probably end up unhappy
I'm a ceramic, pull up on carbon ceramics
My bitch didn't deliver a package
The neighbor was snoopin', he threatened to take me to court
And you know we look at it like rattin'
Nigga out in front of his home felt like aiming this long
But that shit wasn't even effective

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Where the bands at, rubber band that
Caught money givin' orders to a bitch, excuse me?
Fynna say orders to your bitch
I ain't really even really wanna argue this shit I got a condo and a crib
And the people that I own it check, now nigga come get it how you live
Put that on the RIP, Rest in Peace to my nigga Weep got a feelin' that I'm on a muthafuckin' wig
Carve a pussy not at all a pussy, would it bother you or can I call you pussy?
On the phone with a bitch I can call for pussy, I ain't feed her no dick Im'ma starve the pussy
Ball with the balls and my arms in the pause, run a nigga up with his arms in the car
In the car unalarm, in the car with a alarm I was talkin' bout the feds if your offed then your on

[Bridge]
I'm in love with the way the money come off of these drugs
My conversations addictive some people might catch 'em a buzz
While you was in jail this nigga was fuckin' your fiancé
That bitch gon' love and she gon' kik but she not Beyonce

[Hook]

[Outro]
Niggas playin' with my niggas when they not here
You know you owe some niggas money its gon' sound fair
Treat my nigga like he [living?] you a pussy nigga
And don't be rappin' on his name with all you pussy niggas
Ball,  welcome to Puerto Rico
Ball, ball, welcome to Puerto Rico
Ball, ball, welcome to Puerto Rico
Ball, ball, welcome to Puerto Rico
You got that in there?
Let me hear that nigga[Intro]
I wear my emotions on my sleeve you know what I'm saying
I've always been like that, my whole life, man
If I fuck with you, I'm all the way out there
If I don't fuck with you
I don't mind you knowing I don't fuck with you

[Verse 1]
Breaking down a key of coke, I ain't never seen a boat
Khaza got circumcised thinkin I'mma need a load
Boobie he a shooter hit the top of your medulla
From a scooter with a ruger I don't think he even need a scope
Attending college been a goal that I'm after
Evaded doin' life without parole wearin' shackles
I'm only fucking with what matters
A washed up rapper talking trash doesn't matter
Front windshield of the car when it shatters
My nigga brains blown out land in my lap
Told God take me, everybody blamed me
Praying till I'm prayed out won't bring him back

[Bridge]
They say my life is amazing
Funny been a question kinda wonder how I made it
Forest Gump and I got something in common
The world treat you different when brilliant

[Verse 2]
We ain't booted off a molly, we don't do shrooms
All we do is pass gas loud, excuse who?
Twin-turbo 911 make it vroom vroom
We in all black, my mechanic, make the tool move
Say you sip lean, yeah, I do too
I ain't tryna hit your cup, nigga, do you
I'm Michael Jackson, I'm reincarnated
I channel this spirit like Ali the greatest
Medicinal marijuana, am I medicated?
Aerosmith jaded
She looked like Nala when she got on top me
I gazed in her eyes and responded
Can we go half on a baby?
Broke another fingernail scratching on my back
Legs was to the ceiling when I'm pushing on her pelvis
See my tattoo of Elvis when I'm tearing up her cat
She tapped

[Hook]
I'm a perfect imperfection
My craft has been perfected
I just need affection
Emotionally, Imma introvert but it comes off as aggression
No one understand me and everybody can't be slow
It's refreshing to find someone who thinks like me so I can't be wrong
I'm a perfect imperfection and I don't find interest in the radio
So everytime I get high I watch the time pass by like away we go
Is it ok to cry when you're dying inside?
Seem like codeine is the one thing that help take my mind from the lies

[Verse 3]
Point the flame in my brain with the full clip
Drake said Gates do his thing he don't bullshit
All you other niggas rap about is bullshit
Hit the studio on drugs when you get all in your feelings
Look into your eyes nigga you ain't ever lived it
But always talking cooking dope nigga ever had heart ache
Ever lost money learned how to cook oil based
Ever grind hard tryna pay for your lawyer?
Get him paid off and you still go to jail
And that bitch that you love don't pick up when you call her
Fuckin' with your nigga when you get out and you dog her
Going with your mood with a nigga you don't argue
Came here to die in the game I'm retarded
Know its got a name I ain't knowing what to call it
Mama 3 way the call chopping game, me and 40
Freeman I look to you nigga and I love you
Know you lost your parents but with me you got a brother
Malaki and Chris [?] all same trap
Cousin Lil Quick telling me he wanna rap
Uptown Beezy and the white house administration
Get the paper had to see Tyrese [?] in the  scrap
When his seatbelt strap make it hard to lean back
Sittin' up straight in the car with the shades on
Young Seven with the jensen and my main man gone
I was doing time up in rivers when he came home
Now I'm waiting on a nigga for the get out of line
No drive by we jump out and dump where you grind
Excuse me I meant to say where you spend time
You too scared to hustle you're just wasting time
I used to spend nights with Khalil and Jaquincy
And his brother fucked with the ones who against me
Stop making threats cause I swear I hate living
You say you don't like me well shut up or kill me
Well shut up or kill me
You say you don't like me well shut up or kill me
Bitch shut up or kill me

[Hook][Verse 1]
Gates get the business cleared anywhere we at
Smilin' in my face, but itchin' to get me wacked
Name in his mouth bad when he kick it wit' other camps
Tellin' lies wit' the stamp and try to give me the wrap
I'm in the street wit' it, you really won't be exact
Not a good gang member, the members'll probably rat
I don't trust many proficient at livin' that
I don't love women, I hit, you could get her back
Hang up in his face, watch how quick he call back
Whip up at the Texaco, now, what you call that?
You in the paint, now I get in wit' you, I’m wit' all that
Shoulder strap wit' a suppressor, MAC-11, fall back
Speakers bumpin' Omelly 'Osama Twin Lammas'
Grew up seein' violence, pull up, what's the knowledge?
Got my GED, wish I would have made it to college
Wishin' you was free, I could picture you right on 'side me
If I love you, go to war over nothin' if it's a problem
Diamonds in the T-O-P, diamonds in the bottom
Gold mouth dog, self-made, I'm a grinder
Stack paper, hit your girl later, it's a Friday
You know I got a lot of record labels tryin' to sign me
They say if I'm a risk, it's detrimental to the profit
Beyoncé follow me on Instagram, Jigga, watch it
Younger sister, tell her, 'Not interested', she a bopper
Healthy kid, Kodak Black, smokin' that broccoli
Bread Winners administration, I'm Luca Brasi
Everybody sleepin' on me, finally got it poppin'
Wishin' I was wit' my children watchin' Mary Poppins
101 Dalmatians, smokin' grass while I'm on my island
Gettin' tattooed in my kitchen, (-) wit' the heater there
Ghetto, I be strollin' 'round wit' smokers, I ain't even there
Right around the corner, got it jumpin', you could meet me there
That bad news, they was talkin' 'bout already beat me there
Comin' home to my apartment, findin' my daughter dead
Then we put his kid in the oven, so now his daughter dead
Not a robbery, this a murder, woke the whole house
I don't go to funerals, believe me, gettin' pulled out
Group home in Lake Charles, turn up, turn up, wait, pause
Atlanta wit' the cartel microwave, boy
Breadwinner Gang, we is mafia material
What? I would be Tony, mafia material
Hand signal, shoutin' out the plug in the interview
My grandfather used to fuck wit' (-), I could get a few
Scratch the dealers, now we go and get 'em in the inner tube
Breakin' down, distribute, my fingers steady itchin'
Y'all shootin' videos where they 'posed want to kill me
I got 'em under the hood, the soft grade Civic
Balenciaga-rockin', but now it's Air Forces
Call me what you want, lately pullin' up in Porsches
I'm the real plug, but started out an enforcer
Failure to comply, most likely might have to force you
Blow your brains out, the body bag or the coffin
Me and the carnal in the Jag sippin' coffee
We don't get harassed by the badge where the warrant?
Never been a confidential witness, not informant
Trappin' out the shop, why you findin' this alarmin'?
I just got it in, watch how quick it disappear
You tall and you can't dress, really, you annoyin'
Lil' mama better get wit' me before I'm out of range
Right, they got him dumb, they kinda put me in the game
Me and Dreka dealin' wit' the green, that's the only play
Five hundred mil turned out in the safe
Call Coca-Cola, they'll tell you I don't plays
Street game legend in the game, I'm a stepper
Stayed at the Polish last time we was together
Mazi take care of my kids when it's up and then get messy
Cheeseburger hit, got the (-), bought the drop
The rap game fake, Kevin Gates, free the Wap (Gucci, nigga)[Intro]
I don't get tired

[Verse 1]
I woke up feelin' like I couldn't feel no better
I don' want no fuckin' alka seltzer
I woke up feelin' like I couldn't feel no better
Momma pray for me my friends fake I need a hundred steppers
They hate the flick of my wrist
Really be wheelin' the benz
Video vixen look here
Squealin' while I'm stickin' dick in her ribs
I told her I was a beautician whip out the scissors get rid of split ends
I'm full of myself bae I'm trippin'
Feel like I'm Brady whatever it is
I-I'm catchin' plays, I-I mean Kevin Gates
Millz I ain't got no chill, Breadwinner heavyweight ooh
Look who just sat at the table make yo ho go fetch him a plate
Then I pull up in the Porsche bet whoever willin' to race
Charges dismissed by the feds
Still gotta deal with the state
Whoop em I got plenty kush and you pussy
Pick 12 or somebody gon' lay in yo bushes
Two time convicted a stitch for the fully
Jump out I'm feeling no need for the hoodie
Streets love a nigga who really a gangsta
Go check my jacket you know I'ma pull it
Ar-Ab hit the line I'm like what's the business
Just find the lean I'ma sip it I don't trust no bitches
Look at the flick of that wrist
Video from the back how I'm killin' ya bitch
Lovin' my swag MC Hammer
Want to quit but I'm just 2 legit
Baltimore Oriole's hat Mr. Gates
Corner to corner they flooded with H
Hit the corner sto' backwoods and antropo
Money order 2 stamps and a envelope
Commissary in prison, they money low
Jumpin' and dodgin' the fence like I'm Mario
Camera belt buckle these rats catchin' audio
Runnin' the money up workin' no cardio
Left out of Boston and visited Denver
We had a threesome but we don't remember
Res from the grigy still stuck to my fingertips
Twistin' the stink stimulated my mental
Sls 550 matching interior while at the red light I stay lookin' serious
Want to question me I don't know nothing 'bout shit in kentucky I'm dealin' with Benjamin
Elephant whippin' the trunk in the front
But I still cannot figure out where the ignition is
While at the airport I'm being surrounded
I'm thinkin of flyin in private
All in the bathroom with my flight attendant
Ho why is yo hand in my privates?
On IG I talk I be lively
In public I'm movin' in silence
Penitentiary rules in effect
Give respect if I don't get it back I get violent
Cairo city straight drop got em wildin'
Me June and Boola and Poo out our body
Oughta see my new bitch she exotic
Wasn't talkin bout you ho be quiet
Silver shadow Jaber reversible stock my new girl
I keep her right on side of me
Back to jail while suspected of robbery
Jumpin' bond I won't sign out my property
You think Brasi got bodies well probably
Dive in the crowd he a gangsta so possibly
Watch the rappers few bitch niggas knockin' me cuz
They bird and they chickens want flock to me
All in New York be with Maino and Capo
I rode by myself and ain't nobody stoppin' me
Ain't no more real niggas
I'm who Jay-Z and Kanye like to listen to honestly
They probably won't tell you that honestly
Super polite got a record that follow me
Tommy Hilfiger vest with the Guess denim jeans
Kango cap on ya top with the wallabees
Johnny Blaze she can sing like Rihanna but ratted on dude
It took everything out of me
Amber Rose had messed up with my nigga
When I get the rip I expect her to lie to me
Sewed the sign in the middle of my forehead
A broke motherfucka who hatin don't bother me!


[Outro]
Aye look I don't know how to be you bitch ass niggas
All I know how to be is me Yah heard me?
You can't say man I fuck with Gates then say something negative in the same sentence
Man that don't even go together ol' bitch ass nigga
But you don't know that that ain't real
A nigga never taught you that ain't real
Look at all my interviews i never speak on no nigga yah heard me
Penitentiary rules in effect ol' pussy ass niggaI don't get tired

[Hook]
I’m either cooking dope or selling dope
Come and get it if you lookin, I ain’t stretching though
Snowing on the bluff, I’m tryna catch a slope
Up under your house, tryna listen with a stethoscope
That gangsta shit, that ain’t the shit you ready for
How I’m coming with the drum and you would never know
I dress up like a woman and then let it go
Narco trafficante, cocaina come from Mexico

[Verse 1]
Double cups of the syrup, back to back, bad move
Matter fact shawty say she like my tattoos
I don't smile, South side Baton Rouge, had it wild coming up
Didn't happen over night, took a while coming up
So and so? broke my jaw with the flash light
All because I ain't want make my pockets look like bunny ears
Killed a nigga, broke and ran, piss running down my leg
Went and hid the gun behind Ms Connie house
Out my business, learnt how to keep my partners out
Sip ya tea pussy don't know what you talkin bout
Fresh philly, with the line that rashad cut
Bought cars for my team now we all up
Get out of line with my team and we all bust
Cutting up bad, thumbin through the bands, Salmonella pants, hanging off my ass
9 milli 38 don't make me do the hammer dance

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bricks to the South, Bito and Bryan
South 14 let the house gettin off
Redid the nova, shawty took it and then got lost on my nigga damn
Now I'm wishin I could talk to my nigga
Feds snatch Eazy, he should've ran
I wasn't lucky I got picked up with the blam
Tell the Coroner if it wasn’t for they pussy ass boy from the start being loyal but they wasn’t fam
Cocaine when it's good it be jumping back
I'm getting 2 whole things tryna run a land
When its all out war, I don't understand
Look a nigga in the eye if he under hand
Dump a rack, get em snatched like a fucking man
Hard to move by yourself lot of killer ants
Wishing I could turn back set of different hands
Nothing bigger than the B, I got different plans

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I ain't running up a shift yard
30 shots out the tec before it jam
Fist fought, live raw, diving in my bitch car
Shoulder and my lip caught hell on the pitch fork
What they doing? Satin screaming "Kevin where you going?"
You don't see all of these bad bitches I got for you
Want you to get that pussy raw and don't have no abortion
Diggin in your pocket, court appointed, child support you
Spend all your money then go broke, you know I support you
Ride with that pistol police catch you, then gon adios you
Then I'ma laugh while you in jail and act like I don't know you
Go rob that nigga over there, know he ain't got it on em
Cars pulling up, supplying em while on the corner
Graduated to your own trap, somebody try you, fire, make them take a long nap
Aye, you graduated to your own trap? Open fire nigga try, you take a long nap

[Hook][Intro]
Sometimes I tell the bitch I'm with, "Shut up and pass the weed"
Sometimes I tell the bitch I'm with, "Shut up and pass the weed"
Sometimes I tell the bitch I'm with, "Shut up and pass the weed"
Free my niggas!
I been smoking griggity, wish I was with em
Free my niggas!

[Verse 1]
My cousin CJ tried to hit me with a brick of raw
In Alexandria  it’s nothing for to get it gone
With music, I ain’t won awards, but I kept it gangster
Gone be a God in New Orleans like that nigga Daymond
Landlord in the south like my nigga Luchie
Corvette in front of David Ways screeching free Lee Lucas
Fuck that nigga bitch, I got her saying free Lee Lucas
Beeto and Bryan bitch, I just got off the phone with em
My old friends hating, sending me the wrong signals
My dawg recorded conversations, man what’s wrong with him?
You got them college niggas fool,I be with stone killers
Doing bad ‘fore they switched on me
When you’re out of power it’s over
Everybody love you when you feed the streets
When you leave the streets, they don’t know you
Brook used to love me till another nigga with a bigger check approached her
Up in DCI, when I was calling home she was at the nigga house smoking
I was trying to go to church as a family, but her and him be going
Audi S7 was a surprise, I had went and bought that for her
Texting, saying someone that I love let her use his whip as a loaner
Praise be to God, everything done in the dark really come back on you
Cocaine flipper, got the same niggas I came with, and we rolling
In the studio with my nigga Hood, but them niggas round him, they pussy
Gangster shit, get to going platinum, they’ll sit around and be looking
I’m so depressed I’ll kill myself, wish somebody go head and cook me
Fuck!

[Hook]
Bet a lot pussy niggas want to murder Brasi
Boulevard, Murcirélago and a Maserati
Boobie Black, Gunna, and Menace still a catch a body
And if you fuck around with Rayzor, bitch I’m out my body
Sideways, coupe be out my body
Whole clique pull up in Vettes, bitch we out our body
And you ever disrespect it then it’s kamikaze
I just be with me a shooter like I’m John Gotti
I feel like John Gotti
John Gotti
Cause it ain’t shit to send a hit, I feel like John Gotti
It ain’t shit to send a hit, I feel like John Gotti

[Verse 2]
Praise to Allah, I was born a god, with the murder game I'm righteous
Cancel shows just for Rayzor wedding, I don't know another just like it
I love Bunker, but despite the love, I don't know what made him dislike it
But me and Gunna in the Porsche truck and we screeching off like lightning
Fast, doing the dash, your bitch on my ass, she want me to smash
Flip out and flash, I’d rather get cash
Dreka she bad and she into bags
Up in the Louis, Emilio Pucci
I tell em it’s Gucci when they want them bands
I got them racks and no longer wear jewelry
Cause I’m bout my business, and back selling sand
I don’t get tired
I’m bout my business, and back selling sand
I’m bout my business, and back selling sand
Packed up my bags and jumped back on the freeway
Say home's where the heart is, don’t know where I’m going
Actavis drinking, I’m leaning and pouring
Those who don’t get it say what are you on
My mother had sex with an angel
Born an immortal and ain’t even know it
Driving alone while inside of my Porsche
Beat the fuck out a bitch, ain’t no slamming my doors
I’m only excited by spiritual things and I swear I can’t wait to move on
All my niggas I lost know i miss you can’t wait to be with you
I’m on my way home
When they flip the script without warning
Talking bout shit you never did for em
God blessed you with breath in your body
Wish I would let you dig in my pockets
Lazy ass bitch, get up and start grinding
Not in the streets, you never been bout it
Finally got blessed and money started piling
Got my first mil, a nigga ain’t smiling, wylin'

[Hook][Intro]
I'm leanin' right now
Got to be a bitch with ass, BWA
How you know us, we don't even know your name
It's marijuana time
I'm leanin' right now
Nina on me now don't make me bring that .40 out
What you talking 'bout don't make me bring that yoppa out
I'm leanin' right now

[Hook]
A lot of niggas flexing, say they know 100it gang
But how you know us and we don't know your name
Light it up, it's marijuana time
Pour it up, I'm leanin right now
Shorty super fine and I just wanna dick her down
Bring me the pussy I'mma kill it from behind
Light it up, it's marijuana time
Pour it up, I'm leanin right now

[Verse 1]
Got a bad bitch in Lafayette, and like 50 grand on that fuck shit
B.G.'s and VSA's, give 'em the word they gon' bust quick
Niggas throwing water cause they know they watered down
Brookstown) With more bread than dough right now
Lingo, what up? (Yo) What up? (I go) dumb (and) retawdid' (What else?)
Know its got a name, (But what?) don't know what to call it
2 and a 16 ounce pint, I'm leaning right now
My phone be going dumb and that bitch ringing right now
Pull up in them ghosts (runny runny)
Me and Mozzy Floats
Half pound of loud running off at the mouth, shorty need some culture
Car full of killers, bout they business, tinted windows, in Toyota Corollas
Play with me or Nook goddam, Boobie ain't gon' stop unloading

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hey bro look, look over there (I see) She want, me
Her booty like a joystick, Nintendo... WII!
With Percy, a Lago, and a Maserati
Jet Life out his body, beat it, Brasi!
People get behind me I ain't slowing or going I'mma call your phone first before I even pull up
Video coming on MTV, I don't really give a fuck, long as every hood know it
Hashtag BMTP, bring me the pussy and bring ID
Not the average girl from the videos, bumping India Arie
If you pussy, change the subject, paparazzi
Caught me tongue kising one night while out in public, got me
Got to be a bitch with ass to be BWA
Can't fuck with bartender Cherry cause, that ho pussy stank

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm cryin' "shame", nigga main line wanna fuck with Luca Brasi
Every time we around each other I can feel her eyes watching
My Roley game time give a Colorado rocky
Met a freak from Denver called her freaky Colorado
Pussy ooh, juicier than sushi with no avocado
And I do, insecure and he don't want her for the motto
What it do, Bailey's Irish Cream, drinking out the bottle
She get loose, now she drinking chocolate martini moscatto
Pouring juice, lick it off her nipples in love what I got her
Told her crew, freaky things we do, now they wanna holler
Confused, but what's it to you? On twitter they follow
Stuck my tongue all in her ass, you should've seen the way she wobbled[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
My momma said I ain't got it all
To tell the truth I believe her, I ain't got it all
13 tucked the water gun in my drawers
Shot at the police because I thought I was in the movie Set It Off
Boy was I wrong now I gotta big choppa
And I stay in Versace Big Pappa
Played no games I don't duck duck goose
I just goose goose goose, that means you, you, you
Shooting won't stop I just don't get it
Cause I [?] more about it than a plane ticket
Hoes running a fam, look where the mom did
Niggas ain't loyal either look what Lebron did
New winning game [?] dough
Just hanging with shooters that be on lines, wet clothes
'Bout to catch a body, chill leader
In the Philly with a motherfucking cheerleader
Sleeping on me Red Beam
Hundred shots, everybody horny, wet dream
I'm on west side and I don't low ride
2 door Bentley coupe, I'm ready to fucking shoot
Light skin girls I had a hard time with
I was dark, so they used to treat me like dogshit
They called me midnight, shadow, oil stain
Ok enough is enough that's not my fucking name
So I turned up, bought me a couple packs
Turned one into two, oh how I love the trap
I'm the man now, no caption
All in they redskins, Desean Jackson

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
You know Gates stays stupid mane who am I to say
You gotta peep him when you see him
Check out how he do his thing
That dont match he got on louis with a gucci wallet chain
Bottom line, never had a mind who am I to think
It was times I had to grind, me and you are not the same
I be movin' in the coupe, you just pulled up in a daze
Playing ball on the ball courts to hoopin in the cage
I went from hoopin' on the ball courts to hoopin' in the cage
I don't know him but he better keep that metal when he walks
Be behaved I wanna break him off nail him to the cross
Look when he got his weapon off ain't no steppin' off
Different interests afflicted how he led us with his thoughts
Dedication mistaken, so what saw people crazy
Done meditated for days and then elevated to greatness
I listen bad with intentions of hearin half
Partner was the driver the cops were clearing path
Riding with us a chopper, shot through the steerin shaft
Baby mother blamed me for killing her childrens ass

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
With the all black attire on like somebody died
You heard I'm not a real one then somebody lied
Fuckboy's soft I know he's pink
I care less about the haters, I care more about what OGs think
Hit the store copped the OE drink
Just imagine meeting legends like I wonder what the old me'd think
Played a show cashed the check copped a rollie quick
Flip you off while I hold my dick
Why the bums wanna hate on Eazy?
Probably because I'm pretty and my smile looks great on TV
Surely he can't spit, surely he ain't shit
Surely you ain't paid enough attention to your bank slip
It's cheap if you sleep on G
See I run with the wolves of wall street
You wear the sheep all b
Whiskey, condoms, and tree what I keep on me
You can't climb as high as me like your Jeep's on E
Get used to me I'm leaving no time soon
Y'all are about to see some shit you can't imagine like you just did shrooms
So forget what you thought it was, I just finally caught a buzz
Son you all like a father does
I gets a lot of love, G

[Verse 4: Loaded Lux]
Lux on BET, you bet your luck
I draw more blacks than etch a sketch does
Protect your neck up, pray for the predators
Show 'em open arms so they don't open the register
I'm with the band we came to dance, baby James Brown
I see the circus ain't changed just the clowns
Hard luck, momma said not like shots out of Starbucks
Balled up punches that cars crush on these [?]
Gone what? that ain't what neither you or your mom's want
Fronting on the phone getting 50 dudes on your lawn front
Pops don't screw up, in the club with losers
Before I met y'all I thought scrubs were loofahs
And you was stable, saving for that cash
Now ok go get payed
You be lying I cut you [?]
[Wires in every speech?]
Why are you being discreet?
A rapper cover gets blown when this fire's being released[Verse 1]
Would go and get a job, but I'd rather stay and stack
Fronted some niggas work and they ain't ever pay it back
But I fuck with 'em
Get down, dirty, could go and touch 'em up
They momma like my momma so that'll kinda fuck her up
Low-key, them collared shirts got a button up
Say he got a lot of blow, he better button up
A hundred stacks, you owe this to the game
But you surprised? Man you know this never changed
And besides, you'd prolly blow this on a chain
Now take me to the safe 'fore I blow this on your brain
I tried to earn cash and they ask where I get it from
Nigga keep feedin' me that work then I'm a nigga's son
Z28's with 8 fuckin' cylinders
Furnished my apartment with Ashley Millennium
Bitches keep askin' but Gates ain't givin' 'em
Take 'em home, bend 'em, to the gate where I'm sendin' 'em
You gotta keep in mind, I'm a street nigga
If you get out of line, I'mma get street with you
I'm from a state, you stupid, you die from it
Buy a brick, I send it in Louis Vuitton luggage
Buy 10, I throw in a Louis Vuitton duffle
Mini MAK 90, Louis Vuitton muscle
On an island, like who want to be a millionaire?
My kingpin speak Spanish and got pretty hair[Intro - Rich Homie Quan]
I was in Houston for a little minute now I’m back in town
I said I was in Houston for a little minute now I’m back in town
Rich Homie Baby!

[Verse 1 – Propain]
I’m coming just wait for me baby
[?] on my cup, girl I’m faded
Pull up, I’m hoping you naked
I’m on it, I’m feeling impatient
She open the door, she got no clothes
I take it there
Straight to the floor, yeah the bed look good
But we probably won’t make it there
Young Propain, baby scream my name
And I love how you say that there
Going in, got her in the zone, feeling strong
I'mma make her moan till the neighbors hear
Shawty ride like a foreign with the missing brakes
[?] down, side to side, make a figure eight
She be down to do whatever young nigga say
When I hit it I'mma live up in it like it’s real estate
Black diamond, yellow diamond, look like kitty play
Bend her over one time, make it ricochet
Ass so fat, down in the pillowcase
Eyes rolling, got her legs doing the thriller shake
Trill, one round I ain’t never heard of that shit
Fucking with a G, I'mma put you straight to sleep
Get some money bands out the [?] murder that shit

[Hook - Rich Homie Quan]
I could tell she had her shit when she smiled
Shorty lil dramatic but it compliment her style
Late nights we get romantic
Need a babysitter for her child
If I whip her she like ooooh child
I'mma hit that pussy all night wake up another two rounds
Living room got like 8 pictures we done knocked another two down
Yeah, Yeah
I was in Houston for a little minute now I’m back in town [x2]

[Verse 2 – Kevin Gates]
Hold up, cut up, I don't get tired
(Get em Gates!)
I was in school for a semester now I'm back in town
I go to war with God behind you, ain’t no backing down
Hollering loud, you lay flat on your stomach
Both hands on your back when I'm knocking you down
Blowing loud while on the freeway, riding around
Denim be sagging, no mention
Unintentional, judging the book by the cover
Uncanny how we sharing similar interests
Just calling, you know that I'm loving your voice
Keep talking bae, I'mma just listen
Broke down a nugget of griggety
Rolling a spliff and I’m watching her twist it
Tattooed up everywhere, scratching my back
So I'm picking her back up, we shaking
Making love to a gangster on side of a banger
Her man run in here, I'mma blank him
Diamonds is sparkling, she know I'm retarded
My tongue is inside of her ear
Gently removing Victoria’s Secret
While up in her guts from the rear

[Hook]

[Outro - Rich Homie Quan]
I got this lil quiet bitch who never said shit
She thick as hell she stripping dreams and she from Texas
I'm well protected baby Jesus on my necklace
Big Flu my nigga Big Throw my nigga and DJ Everett (whoever)
Propain!
What it do[Intro]
(phone rings)
What the fuck!
Hello?
What up nig?
What up nigga?
Shit, chillin'

But look, I’m bout to get it in right fast, nigga I love you, let me do this I'mma call you later
Alright nigga
Alright love you boy
Love you too nigga
Alright
Keep all that

[Verse 1]
Gladiators on deck
Drug user, don’t drink sprite
And when I do, it ain't pink sprite, a lot of lean, it’s purple
Trust issue, don't trust really
No two point conversion
Won't run it after I touch down
My punter kicking, it's defense
(What you get into this weekend?)
Where was you when I was slumped over
Gums hurting from a old bullet, in front the toilet while hunched over
Puking all of my insides, stab wounds from a old friend
Well at that time we were close friends, they say I killed him in cold blood
We wrestled for the gun but the gun went off
He up’d the pistol, looked him dead in his eyes
I been ready to die so nigga do it
Gates mane, I'll really do it
I’m serious too nigga, really do it
Turned his head, closed his eyes, aimed the tool, started shooting, I didn’t die, my life a movie

[Hook]
4:30 am, never say when, it’s five in the morning, and your children are somewhere on the corner
6:00 a.,m water boiling, think I'm addicted to the strong aroma

[Verse 2]
When I was touching McKinley
Erin really my best friend, and I was loving her best friend
Bright Brittany with the long hair
You know Fabernard lil' sister
She stole a jag for to come and get me
I was buying dope
In and out the system
Brandy fucking my nigga Ray
At the same time, fuckin' coach Whitney
He the track coach, and a asshole
Know that didn't have shit to do with this, I was just stating the facts though
Jessica round me, talking sexual bout me
She bend over in front me, from the back while I'm pounding, now it's over
Bitch get up and get out
I mostly likely forgot to mention, but we was in my trap house
Just brainstorming, in the game forming
These thoughts into ideas
No regrets for the shit I did
That also mean for the niggas I killed

[Hook:]
4:30 am, never say when, it’s five in the morning, and your children are somewhere on the corner
6:00 a.m, water boiling, think I'm addicted to the strong aroma[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Forensic whipping in court, still considered a sport
On the phone. we ball here, I’m watching King of New York
Kendrick Sheamus, Tay Swimmer, the greatest I ever saw
All team turn sour, niggas trying to get off
Caught slipping, blicked the biscuit administered in the court
I’m a dog, worst place to get heaters while in the court
Pull it hold it my liquors, I’m itching, bank to the court
Bitch, I'm whipping, pitching a fig, yelling Kevin Bacon the court
You know how I spit em
Visits, I'm on the run trying to get to heaven
Baby mama problems, every night tryin to fix it
Flashing out, flipping tables, broke every dish in the kitchen
The devil living in me, I’m contemplating to end it
Spray face in 20 years, but that’s what they try to give em
D.R said that I don't, therefore charging caught with that dealing
Back when we was little, the one is a bigger dealer
Innocent making faces and they wonder why I ever did em'
Whoever think that we grow up and turn off to be killers
Barrel extensions, tool it down as it slithers
Compact in my jacket even flinch i'mma hit ya
Shot two hard in the heart, my emotions are ruined
Too hard to trust I don’t give a fuck, won't open up to no woman
Take my lick and keep pushing, don’t try playing me pussy
They all 15 with the ippy, laying down in the bushes
Won’t say no name but some saw me get a pound of them cookies
TTGATTG, L.I.F.E, I’m with it
If shawty bust a pussy hoping no commitment, I sinned it
Lord forgive me I’m sinnin’ I come to you as a sinner
Take all my scars, take my heart turn me into a Christian
Bright nigga, in the payment like my last name was Griffin
Popeye his chicken
I just want 4 legs and a biscuit
I always shoutout my kites, all my niggas, and forces
Stuck to the cold
Even when the pressure on, we ain't folding
Let’s get it allI've been abused by this cold, cold world

Everybody around you pretending that they your partner (Woah!)
Let you have a problem they won't even help you out (Woah!)
Smiling in your face, you turn your back they talk about you
I've been abused by this cold, cold world

Lord I'm going hard I'm stacking all my benjamins
Swear to God that I can't wait to shit on all my friends again
I'mma pull up bens again, p-p-pull up bens again
I'mma pull up bens again, p-p-pull up bens again

Long hair Dreka looking like she got ass shots (Ooh!)
Doing pole-a-robics sipping lean and soda I am not
Glock nine by the stop sign bout fifty thousand in the stash spot
Pray to God we don't crash in the whip through the dash
I could tap the gas and make that ass drop

Ever wonder why your bitch look funny when the music playing
Been a gangster safe to say that I live everything I'm saying
Bend her over pull her hair and eat her pussy, lick her ass
And when we be cutting up her feet be in the ceiling fan

Hold up, let me get my roll on
Think I need another pocket just to put my phone on
H-h-h-hold on, let me get my roll on
Think I need another pocket just to put my phone on (Who there?)
Long nose, better get your donk on
Speaking with the wrong tone, that'll get you dun dun
Thinking with my dick wasn't nothing like a thong song
Looking for a two piece boom chicka boom boom

Everybody around you pretending that they your partner (Woah!)
Let you have a problem they won't even help you out (Woah!)
Smiling in your face, you turn your back they talk about you
I've been abused by this cold, cold world

Lord I'm going hard I'm stacking all my benjamins
Swear to God that I can't wait to shit on all my friends again
I'mma pull up bens again, p-p-pull up bens again
I'mma pull up bens again, p-p-pull up bens again

Pants sagging bout gat blasting while rats snitching I am tatted
Lean bad got bad habits yellow bitch from Lafayette fantastic
Dead broke, got mad ad it, I'm back stacking I'm flap-jacking
Your flap rattling you fat faggot, I'm back at it in the trap trapping

I love the bens, I've been camping, I'm standing strong, you bandwagon
I'm concrete, you transparent, my dick out, your hand grabbin
No can blame us, who grab bammas, eat yo block, then rim shaggin
No hidden cameras, from the back smashing, her ass clapping, I am nasty

Road to riches, go and get it and Daytona charges
Took a dive from not following our first mind
I was getting in the mail through UPS
If I tell you I'mma stay away from Juliet
I'mma lying

Everybody around you pretending that they your partner (Woah!)
Let you have a problem they won't even help you out (Woah!)
Smiling in your face, you turn your back they talk about you
I've been abused by this cold, cold world

Lord I'm going hard I'm stacking all my benjamins
Swear to God that I can't wait to shit on all my friends again
I'mma pull up benz again, p-p-pull up benz again
I'mma pull up benz again, p-p-pull up benz again[Verse 1]
(Perfect)
I'm Mister Gates
Come to makin' this cake
Ask ya father, dope harder than paper mache
Bet maybe on the Lakers up ya tazer I'mma waste ya if you painin' seekin' trainin' with this game then I'mma lace ya
I been in and out the cater, Adidas with the laces
Front seat at the races, misplacing of my bracelet but I'm sayin'
I am not pickin' for different roles
I'm not kiddin', you kiddin'? I'm like a ten-year-old
I got my winter clothes
Couple track jackets, and the hats match it
Glock 40 this is black magic
Equipped with black talons, heavy metal this is black (?)
Just the devil, convicted felon, if you cats askin'
(?) kitchen dairy fisher me and Ron Chapman
Made em' miss, then I made assist, now we drawin' backwards
The percentage cost a bigger penny, very small fabric
I'm just givin' you the 411, with a tall mattress

[Hook]
Nigga grind all night till the daylight comin' up
All my life, they said he's not one of us
But he thinks nothin' when the cheese keeps doublin' and the weed I'm puffin' all the lean I'm guzzlin'

[Verse 2]
Brains hit
Watchin' the soaps
Got it like, iPhone got a camera she gon' ride the pipe
If not that then watch back, tell her kind to hike
Get ya clothes, hit the road, and they think I'm polite
G-Shock Spike Lee, diver's watch
Full throttle, same kind that MacGyver got
I drive a lot (Wait)
Hold up I'm hungry, chicken sandwich no honey mustard with onions on it
Won't get embarrassed come run upon it my youngins on you
Trip and head stand on ends, like Coolio
Tool a cut off front of your face, look like a booty-hole
Take for instance, you ain't makin' the right amount
Words on the bird you break in somebody house
Somebody say they was present when they was makin' the count
And you got a couple of minutes cause they out makin' they route
So you walk into a trap and they end up takin' you out

[Hook]x2

[Verse 3]
In the heart of the re-up, re-up
Feed up on the libra, you despise you could die
You get beat up with the evil
You got beat up in ya (?)
Ten two illegal
Let it pass, get ya cash or get beat up by the people
Diesel
You could hear me through ya speaker got me greedy when I'm eatin' gotta feed a lot of people
All on my shoulders, weight of the world
Death chose em, leg broken, so I wait on my girl
Drop my weight on my girl now we out cruisin' the cities
Stupid decision got me wounded and injured
I got, goons in the picture who end up losin' the city
Trying to do it with this music I'm like who is you kidding
Coops shingle losing, cause the roofing is missing
Ain't into screwin' with pigeons, seem a screw always missing
Seems in the street, the truth always missing
I be seen on the scene, nigga you always missing

[Hook]x2[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Could tell the most amazing stories, I grew eyes behind my head
My senorita speaking leaving I ain't even trippin
Think that every time I'm not around it's other women
Lanlord that rap I don't give a fuck about nun of this shit
Ate her good while pulling her hair
She throwing her pussy back on this dick
I'm armed and retawdid giving orders to my squadrin
BWA Bread Winners Association, check me out
When I kill her from the rear I dick her down
(?) I don't get tired
Feel that dick?
Like Julia Roberts on Pretty Woman, bitch on the lips I don't kiss
Got a 3 of Juice in my 20 ounce while I ride around, I sip
Been going hard, aiming for the stars, this foreign whip that I'm in
Say 'What up?' to you, won't smoke with you, me and bitch niggas ain't friends

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
You said you'd never leave
Now who's gonna comfort me at night when I'm alone, oh?
Actually, hustle hard while in the trap long nights we get it on though
I'm stacking cheese, If anything go wrong I know no one will ride for me
Garentee, could tell the most amazing stories I grew eyes behind my head

[Verse 2: Yung Mazi]
They left a nigga for days, shot in the back of my head
I see you, no one was on my bed
Fuck the feds, fuck the feds
In a high ride with Low, I read, show you how to play
I never talk, I ain't have to say it
I took it, I didn't have a way
Eye behind my head, stay in that real view
Stay in that big Coupe, money not an issue
Blow paper, tissue
A bitch can't ever miss you
On me, 1, 2, pistols
Shooters geek my lil crystals
Bitches freak molly crystals
Wrist lighting up Christmas
Try it, I flipped it, kill this

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
You said you'd never leave
Now who's gonna comfort me at night when I'm alone, oh?
Actually, hustle hard while in the trap long nights we get it on though
I'm stacking cheese, could tell the most amazing stories I got eyes behind my head
Could tell the most amazing stories I grew eyes behind my head

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Truth be told, I'm a gun slanger
My nuts hanging to the floor
Your friends talk with their eyes telling me we should fuck on the low
We could leave the bed made up punch dick in your stomach all on this floor
Lick all between your little toes, don't do this type of shit with no hoes
Rip out their weave, fuck them hard, she say 'Gates you hurt my insides'
Now you feelin' how I'm feelin' really hurtin' on the insides
Never let your pride get in the way of what you really love
Killing emotion with too many drugs
Kiss on it, then lick it while up in the tub
(Recession of knowledge that wasn't in lighting thats why on the phone I'm knocking up on my cup?)
Bitch get up, fuck I'm sorry, that was suppose to last until tomorrow
I'm a gangster never in her life has she been around anyone like I

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
You said you'd never leave
Now who's gonna comfort me at night when I'm alone, oh?
Actually, hustle hard while in the trap long nights we get it on though
I'm stacking cheese, If anything go wrong I know no one will ride for me
Garentee, could tell the most amazing stories I grew eyes behind my head[Hook x2 : Doe B]
Who the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?
Who the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?
I don't know that bitch, I don't know them either
Kinda look familiar, I done caught amnesia
X2

[Verse 1: Doe B]
I done fucked so many hoes I can't keep count no more
Will somebody tell Hugh Hefner he ain't got shit on Doe?
My neck on freeze, my wrist on glow
I'm high as fuck, I'm sitting low
Want your ho, come get your ho
I got her walking pigeon toed
America next top model, right here in my condo?
I don't even know her name, I just asked her for a condom
And she look like Rihanna, her ass is like humongous
She say she love my convo cause I kick shit like a punter
But I don't know her name, and she don't know me either
She just want the fame, I just want bomb no teeth
Love me long time, love me, love me long time
The reason all my dates be blind dates cause this charm of mine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Dear Lord, could you please have mercy?
Rock hard, bitch on me twerkin'
Bitch like, "You stupid jerk!"
Look, I ain't grab your ass on purpose
Don't remember nothing, guess I'm getting worse
BMTP, that's murder
Bring me the pussy, you ain't ever heard her?
Now we fucking in an old excursion
Getting head while I drive excursion
On the phone asking "Am I working?"
He must want me to hurt him
Instead of talking like its urgent
Where you know me from, I'm lost
Man you about to make me get off
It was hard, but it started soft
Fish scale, what the hell, that's raw
Hold shots, come get broke off
Two paws, oh God, that's the law
Shots fired, man down, what happened?
Envelope, beep phone, I stabbed him
Two shooters, you dummy, I'm coming, get the money
Got a bank roll in this bitch
Amnesia, I have that shit
Ask anything, I forget, quick

[Hook][Verse]
Where we go from here, If I leave the block
A little money fine but I need a lot
Take a preachers route but dont lie to people
I ain't never seen anything in the sky
Clean in the ride, what I mean that I'm fly
With a bitch super mean, bumpin' lean to the side
I was thinkin bout any means I could try
I believe in a high!
Being logical gave me a reason to doubt
Scheme for things I was dreaming
In a magazine article reading about
Face card, I ain't got to pay for drugs
It comes free with the artificial look
Could I just do me, Let me be me
I ain't arguin' for much
I'm with this bitch and I feel free
She don't demand of me for much
My sex drive been at an all time low
I can barely get it up!
Tryin' to keep another mother fucker happy
Swear I'm givin' up!
Drug usage is increasing since the last time
Been gone awhile and I'll be back just like the last time
Racks on me, stacks on me, Travel hard
One nation under God!
In the car alone, prayin' to the stars
Engine roaring, make a joyful noise
Praise be to Allah, come this far or not!
Cocaine, Foreign car, Look who takin' off!
Throwin' money at my nigga
Younger sister really wishin' he was with us
But look who takin' off!
Band for you to keep, love I'm finna leave
So I guess I'm taking off!
No one will love you like I do so never hesitate to call
Know I could always count on you to always have me there at all
Good hearted if you think wrong
How could you be right?
Four niggas fuckin' the same bitch
She pop up pregnant this can't be life
Get rid of the bitch, 'fore I get rid of you dicks
I'm sick of you bitch
No hands on ya, rubberbands on ya, I ain't talkin' like a stripper
Pay they do it, send razors through, spray the kay and make you flip
Only reason I ain't kill your mother
Strength of her daughter
And she cheats everyday on your daddy
Tryin' to give orders
Then they try to extort a gangsta, I'm someone important
Don't step in my office, I ain't about no talkin'
Be sippin' my coffee while bullets is sparkin'
Without any caution, now watch who I'm crossin'
Boobie is awesome, catch up if I lost ya
With this I went off
My grandpa a gangsta, he died I went off
Don't interrupt me while I am recordin'
Shit so depressing, I wish I could pause it
Misunderstand it, put that in a coffin'
Back to the margin, re-up and get off it
Label an orphan, Lane of my own
I got the hawkin, I am retarted
Know theres a name, don't know what to call it

[Hook]
No ones watchin' but the angels
My hearts been takin' by this angel
I, To many insecurities that won't allow me to trust
Why not protect us from love, If they’re angels?
My hearts been taking by an angel
No ones watchin' but this angel
I, To many insecurities that won't allow me to trust
Why not protect us from love, If they’re angels?[Hook]
Box of soda, red and gold (red and gold)
Arm and hammer (Arm and Hammer)
Do the microwave and stove arm and hammer
Trap girl on my phone
She be like, "What's the matter?" (What's the matter)
Going hard just ran out of Arm and Hammer
She like bae I'm at the store
What you want? You should know, sandwich bags and Arm and Hammer
With a scale I'm going hammer
Trap jumpin I got junkies watchin burglar bars and cameras

[Verse 1]
Phone charging in my Monte Carlo
Pull up to the trap while on the phone with Jamarlo
Percielago, new Camaro up in full throttle
Buying pints, check the seal, it's a full bottle
BWA, Bread Winners Association
In my trap on the couch like my leg's broke
Catching sells, ain't no way I could be dead broke
Let him in, shut the burglar, lock the deadbolt
Nigga try I got that iron,make your head smoke
Kitchen or whipping can't be like whatchamacallit
Work be fucking retawdid
That's what my customers call it
Grabbed two houses they jumped to like sixty eight by they self
Straight out the pot to the bag, they both weigh seventy wet

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Broke a block down to rocks
Slowly picking my weight up
In the drop selling ounces
If you want weight you can wait up
Ain't been asleep in 3 days
My nickname should be Stay Up
Fuck the club and the mall, right now I'm stacking my cake up
Fuck you hoes I could jack off, I don't play break up to make up
You other niggas had your turn you play your face then get ate up
(Don't wanna get killed)
Don't make us, send you straight to your maker
Bought my paper, my paper, might step out on occasion
Just heard Tyiesha getting married
Here's a congratulations
Invited me on vacation, reception out in Jamaica
Quarterback that play in Dallas (Set, Hut!), Troy Aikman
In a world of bad bitches, don't pass them by the car hating

[Hook][Hook]
My heart, my heart, callin' out to you
In the arms of a stranger, callin' out to you
And we don't even talk anymore
Never knew separation anxiety before
Every time the leaves are changing
It's the loneliest time of year

[Verse 1]
Wait hold on baby, you don't have to leave let's talk it out
If you say you're no longer happy, you can turn around
Burn all my belongings if you can't figure it out
I don't really need those things anyhow
But every time the lights go down in the room
... me and you
Never meant to say all those things causing so much pain
Now my thoughts on the floor so confused
Listen to .....

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My favorite book's The Notebook by author Nicholas Sparks
Built a staircase just to runaway, but she won't make it far
Every time the leaves start changing we're lonely just like before
And I don't really need those things anyhow
Her bein' the reason why I can smile
Settle down, think I know a real fly place
A coffee shop around the block from where I once stayed

[Hook][Hook]
While gambling the point we seen the money go
Touching me gently saying she never wanna let it go
While gambling the point we seen the money go
Touching me gently saying she never wanna let it go

[Verse 1]
Pressure while we sexting going ugh, feel that dick?
Now we bout to break all of the rules, sound off
I ain't had sex in a long while
After this she'll think about me for a long time
Falling off I'm coughing, no chiropractor in office
Need your back crack and leg work, bed work, I'm awesome
Parking garage in your office, fucking co-workers be talking, fuck them
Throwing dick in your guts, this P90X what's up
Pants sagging, blowing these blunts
All in public saying you love
Now we bout to break all of the rules, sound off
I ain't had sex in a long while
After this she'll think about me for a long time

[Bridge]
Conversations in the dark, emotions get exposed
Saying whatever's talked about no one should ever know
Body exotic like the models in the videos
Treating the dick just like a stripper when she on the pole

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Breakfast, brunch, checking up
Linen made when I mess it up
Mike Tyson fighting with a lot of biting
Got a lot of stripes, I'm like Mike the Tiger
Eating pussy up, yeah, appetizer
Looks appetizing, I like the sight
She like to ride, I showed the pipe
She got on top it like a motorcycle
I'm a street nigga, I pull hair
In the projects, I'm good there
I fuck with you, that's saying something
Many other bitches I could have
I suck toes, tongue in between
What we have nothing come between
In and out of this pressure (sexting)
Smoke detector no smoke detected
Jumping hard and I know she felt it
Naked faces I'm stroking, heaven
Jeremih song Waiter bumping loud on repeat
Seems the sex is always greater, hit the loud, sip the lean
Speaking with a soft tone that I know we all alone

[Bridge]

[Hook][Intro]
That’s it right there
Let me see something
Man you something serious ya heard me
Some might consider this a problem I easily fall in love
Excuse me if I touch, you the baddest in the club
I desire your body, exotic, I just can't get enough
You the baddest world

[Hook] x4
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like

[Verse 1]
Do it in the mirror, make your body jerk
Pressure when we sex'n so it gotta hurt
Got your hand on my head while I'm chewin' on your kitty
I'm the cutest in the city in a collar shirt
Got a million dollar swag pants hang off my ass
And the money commin' fast, sell a lot of work
Few festivities we can peep this evening
Thinking we can both leave we don't need a reason
Got the window top flight out to Puerto Pico
Butt-naked in the tub with the ? steamer
Put the weed up when you see the people
90 day tech for a misdemeanor
My chick's demeanor, might get pissed at me
If she catch me sneakin' with another skeezer
Wild out in the club, real street niggas hold ya bottles up
Other niggas women tend to follow us
I'm in the V.I.P. section don't bother us
You know you couldn't see me with binoculars
Paparazzi think's I'm popular
Luca Brasi get's on top of her
Make her holla like an opera
All these lights in the house, all the candles in the bathroom
Step out of ya bath robes and welcome to my classroom
Bubble gum, bubble bath, pro position
The life jury cited on some ? postions
Spread your booty cheeks I'mma lick all in between
While I hit you from the back in the slow position
Get it from the side, get on top and let you ride
Then after that you can do that bad position

[Hook] x4

[Verse 2]
I just spotted the baddest bitch in the building tonight
And I ain't leavin' 'less she leavin' with me
I overheard you told tell ya girl ya nigga wasn't fucking you right
I been drinking plus I done threw me back three
I'mma hit you with that ? I done came down
I ain't finna front you the flyest thing 'round
Head to the toes, shoes to the clothes
Ducks get played, bad bitches get choose
Bad bitches get they ears, neck, and wrist froze
Boss bitch swag, you be shittin' on them hoes
Love the way you pose when them niggas take flicks
Pull up to the club stuntin' hard in the six, six
Drop the top I pull out the knot
I make all them hoes bow down to you
Cause they ain't on ya level, I'mma change ya life
They ain't got no business hangin' 'round with you
I'm down to do anything you down to do
Go anywhere you down to go
You don't wanna make love I'mma beat it up
But when you 'bout to bust I'mma start grinding ?

[Hook – Starlito][x2]
I'm ballin ballin ballin bitch
Don't know what else to call this shit
All this gualas I brought with me, I fuck around and spend all this shit
I fuck around spend all this shit, I'm ballin ballin ballin bitch
I fuck around spend all this shit

[Verse 1 – Starlito]
I started off fucked up, finally got my weight up
Still trying to figure out what the fuck you hating for
When I come around it feel just like an appraisal
Independent nigga getting it in just like the majors
Thumbing through the checks feel like a nigga turning pages
If you was cool and ain't no more, you've done us both a favor
Eighties baby, grew up on a pistol and a pager
Got a free quarter ounce, I bet a hundred on the Lakers
I should say against them, you know I'm riding with the Heat
At the corner store with my box Chevy
Box of rubbers, box of swisher sweets
Still got a bitch that got a bitch that'll get your bitch to leave
Switch up freaks like I swap my whips, that shit ain't real as shit to me

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 – Juicy J]
I get to the money partner, you too broke to talk to me
I been counting up all this week, on top of my shit like a toilet seat
I’m rich just like I oughta be, and being real don’t cost a fee
Tell your girl come ride with me
Dick buffet, all she can eat
Loud pack in a mason jar, drive slow in a race car
This yellow bitch I’m in traffic with
She fine as shit and she paid for
Nah this ho can’t be my wife, just make sure you roll my weed up right
Made my eyes so low, it looks like I’m gonna cook me fried rice
I’m ballin, ballin, ballin, bitch
In a car that costs like 40 bricks
Bought a case of sprite and Imma pour codeine in all this shit
These niggas ain’t trill, these niggas policing on the low
Take a nigga’s bitch, and leave the club
But he can put an APP on that ho

[Verse 3 – Kevin Gates]
Screeching, no reason
Saved by the bell, this bitch to the right
Pretty face, tall, white, with a smile like Lisa
Big booty diva
Broke a brick down, need a band of zap
And three hundred for the O’s of reefer
Twenty five bags of the OG kush and the grandaddy purp come weekly
Xans and tabs in the air, no slab, but thank god for my people
On the road doing show after show after show and I still eat good off features
Clunking, gold, and tweaking if the streets ain't got no lean
Say they bought like nine 50 for the seal I say I need it
Took time, this crook’s fine, had bad karma, I shook mine
Jab good, slip excellent, uppercuts, my hook's fine
Refrigeration, illustration, ice on, got niggas hating
Foreign whip, foreign bitch, what that is, immigration
Overcooked dope bags cocaine
If it cook too long then they may complain
Dope game both lanes, won't say no names
Don’t make propane, won't make no change
From the ghetto [?] work that's why I'm ballin, I'm ballin
If you've got a problem with it I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry

[Hook][x2][Intro]
People are gifted in, different aspects of life and
Certain things that we choose to do as individuals
Hinder us from doing other things
Don't be mad at me for being the best at what I was created to be
I love you, you know what I'm sayin', ? real talk

[Verse 1]
As projected, I'm on the winning team, illest in the league
Seemingly hate to disagree, a tendency to leave
If it's me and it's something I hindered, enabled to breathe
You could leave and go make an adventure, get down on my knees
Tell you that I love you, but you not returning my call
Made an appointment, you no longer answer at all
I get around, but I can't forget about it
And tell that other lame that's enough to get his brains blown out
Body shape is amazing
Conversations relate to the place that I used to stay in
Sweet street talk, love the way that we talk
Edible pleasure, eat you then tease you with teeth marks

[Hook]
I'mma keep it street, 'bout as street as can be
It's illegal for to steal a niggas feelings then leave
I get around, but I can't forget about it
And tell that other lame that's enough to get his brains blown out

[Verse 2]
Situation made me take a vacation, I went to jail
Keep in touch, love letters, I'm touching you through the mail
Masturbation in my mind, like I'm fucking you in the cell
Even booked you on a visit (You're crazy) you know me well
Seems we a lot alike, I mean a lot alike
Lonely when alone at night, I'm promisin' I'm never lettin' go
Ship sinking, I'm clinging on, Leonardo decaprio

[Break]
Try I, nights cry, BWA, a way of life
Speaking with my ambition
God speed in the street
May he be with my nigga Menace

[Hook] x2Gates, Rock wieler
Gates, Gates

[Hook]
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward, bend em' backward, bend em' backward
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward
I wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, bend em' backward

I ain't use to this
They make it rain for you
Strip tease, drop change on the stage for you [x 2]

[Verse 1]
Hugh
Dead game, exhibition a paper
Brick a brick down then create a recreation
My situation perhaps
My innocent love affair
Manipulated emotion enable me not to care
Hmm
Flored killing
Everybody watching me
She asked me to buy her drink then danced on the top of me
Pause for a minute, push her ass to the ceiling
They tend to act bad when there's cash in the building
Gates
She was breaking her neck to look at us
Girl I touched the tattoo on this neck
Ridiculous
Not to mention I'm probably to inclined for your mind if you listen
You probably got aroused playing slippers in the kitchen
Before the blind fold, never knew as much attention
Truth to said a dare to afraid to show your [?]
A lot of dick in her deep tissue massage
Accompanied by a freak can only be a minaj

[Bridge]
I ain't use to this
They make it rain for you
Strip tease, drop change on the stage for you [x 2]

[Verse 2]
I like the way when she rock, her hips
Squeal under pressure
Do it in the mirror with your heals on the dresser
Nigga go to talking about money you ought to listen
Paper by the stack
Could back Georgia pacific
Sitting in the car, twisting my cigar
Sick of rad bitches, they don't listen in the car
Not to mention in the car
When the business get bizarre
Your nipples got erect when he was unzipping your bra
Aye

Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward, bend em' backward, bend em' backward

[Verse 3]
Mr Gates
He never pull his pants up
If they don't give me space
I'm leaving here hand cuffed
Northern light kush
Believe I'm a star
B bought the picture booth
And T bought the bar

[Hook]
I ain't use to this, she put her ass on me
If she do it, baby stick it
Do it fast for me
Say I might as well sag my pants everywhere I go
You know I'ma show my ass everywhere I go

I ain't use to this
They make it rain for you
Strip tease, drop change on the stage for you [x4]
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward, bend em' backward, bend em' backward
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward
I wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, bend em' backward
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward, bend em' backward, bend em' backward
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward
I wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, bend em' backward[Produced by Cardo]

[Hook: Kevin Gates (2 Chainz)]
Whip through the dash
Some thing on my wrist is blinging
Got a bad bitch in my ride
But the whole time I'm still thinking
(Bet I'm on it
Bet I'm on it
This ain't no motherfucking lease, I bet I own it)
Smoking green and I'm leaning out the ladle
I'm the flyest nigga living in the whip while I'm still thinking
(Bet I'm on it
Bet I'm on it
This ain't no motherfucking lease, I bet I own it)

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Respect none of your lies
Got a tampon on my line
PH levels on offset but pussy hater good try
Double sip, double cup, double parked it this time
Double taking, taking place on a double date, she got ass shots
Bartender she can have shots, take her home give her back shots
Hustle really hard never made it with a sport
Five hundred four grams and you never woulda thought
Eighteen ounces made it with a fork
Loved in the hood but I'm hated in the court
When the ball hit the rim that's a miss
Come to think about it wait, that's a brick
Three hundred eight balls coming, no assist
Aw here we go again, mind on dope again
Cuffs on my wrist tell the deets I don't know again
Insecure guy probly mad bout his ho again
Foreign on them inches take your bitch cause she was taking interest
Ladle licker naval kisser rear and rip her from the rear

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I ain't with all the arcades
Stalked her out like a shar-pay
Fucked your girl for an appetizer then fucked again for an entree
Southside where I came from, murder rate on the rise
Niggas will murk for food they might as well hold up a sign
I get minez, spell it with a "z"
Niggas sleeping on me: z, z, z
I wake them niggas up, take them niggas' cut, ate them niggas' lunch, EBT
See my movements is a movie, good head soothes me
And I love group sex, hell yea I'ma groupie
If sex is a weapon, hit her ass with that Uzi
Told her to wipe me down, hit her ass with that Boosie
Then we got trippy, hit her ass with that Juicy
Had sex with her raw, hit her ass with that sushi

[Hook][Intro: Lil Chuckee]
Phone bill, lights bills, gas bill, I got it
I, I got it, I, I got it
I, I, I, I got it

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
She need them bills to pay her bills
Money all in this floor
Co-coming out in her clothes
Going up and down on this pole
Need them bills to pay her bills
Gangsta shit do we really bound
Pence a second they hanging down
Diamonds blinging and they talking loud
She need the bills to pay her, bills to pay her, bills to pay her bills
She need the bills to pay her, bills to pay her, bills to pay her bills
She need the bills to pay her, bills to pay her, bills to pay her bills
She need the bills to pay her, bills to pay her, bills to pay her bills
She need them bills to pay her

[Verse 1: Lil Chuckee]
Got a phone bill, her light bill, her water bill in my pocket
The way she got all my money is like she stole my wallet
Raping my jeans how she all on me
She want that beat, that B E A T
To get her out of town, I got the money found
Is like she was just born and now she keeps her clothes on
Clap-clap on, clap on
She make it clap round of applaud
She whipping, she trapping
She ‘bout to take her drawers off
Like damn, my girl twerk it slow for me
Pop pop pop that, I'mma throw this money, shawty
Mula mula mula, her trunk set pranks
Spending all this money I'mma have to run to the bank

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Chuckee]
I told her do it with no hands
Look at her, showing off, doing it on a handstand
Bandz a’ make her dance, I love it when she dance
She shaking it so hard she got me hard up in the pants
All in the mirror, stiletto custom fifty
If he ain't trying to pay her bills, than she tryin’ to kick it
I made the party, I'm feeling good, so I'mma blow nine hundred
First of the month, it's bills time, so I'mma blow twelve hundred

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, get the trash back, I'm blowing cash
I-I-I'm looking for her; where she at?
You make a nigga fall in love, Goddamn, you're fine
Bring her back two times, let me get behind

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Chuckee]
They know I got it, got too much money
They can’t fit in my wallet
All in the mirror, 'round and 'round she go
Love the way she move when she drop it on the floor
Watch how she roll, moving slow
Fifties and hundreds is the only thing I throw
Don't stop, girl, I won’t move
Hop in my Ferrari and baby let's go

[Hook]
