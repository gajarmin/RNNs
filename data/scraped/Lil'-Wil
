[Talking]
It's a Big E beat, know what I'm sayin
I'm so mothafuckin fly right now
You know what I'm sayin (hundred grand right)
Well take a look at these two niggas on side of me
You know what I'm sayin
Introducin F.E.D, haha-You know

[Verse 1-Lil' Wil]
Walk up on the set (yup)-steppin with a swag
Clothes gotta dro odor, so you know I blow bats (blunts)
Fresher then a mothafucker-pocket got stacks
Hoes lookin over here, cause they like Skeet Jack (pussy poppin)
Chirper goin off like I got a dispatch
Say they lookin for that work and I ain't about to holla back (nope)
Post up on the whip and start lookin for somethin bad
Nice eyes, cute face, and gotta have a phat ass
Bust that pussy open then I tell her bring it back
I'mma beast up in these sheets, just like somethin you never had
Caught you at the club doin that sexy ass dance
Dropped it down to the flo, and brought it back up in a stance (goddamn)
I like the way she workin it
Ass sittin right, and it's like magic when she twurkin it
Baby don't you jerk me, I know this here for certain
Cause it's guaranteed, you let me beat-then I'll murk it

[Hook-Lil' Wil Repeat 2x]
My Dougie-My Dougie-My Dougie-My Dougie
My Dougie-My Dougie-My Dougie
She Say She Like My Dougie, I'm Fresh
My Dougie, I'm Fresh-My Dougie, I'm Fresh
Yep Flyer Then A Mothafucker

[Verse 2]
Officer I'm clean, why ya dog keep on sniffin me?
Ridin down the lane, stopped at Spain's and bought a three piece
I'm chillin with my bitch-I ordered her some fish
Fresh Girbaud tee and the J's to match my fit
Click tighter then a fist, pretty browns always flock
My team wrapped in Charmin, we the shit up out the trap
We out our mind mayne, smooth with it gangsta
Should've put us in a cage, cause we all off the chain
I'm a fool with it, catch me saggin my 'bauds
While I'm smellin like some Sherm, quarter ounce of that dope
Now I'm the nigga she chose, say she wanna leave with me
Middle of the flo'-with a drank, peepin the scenery
Fresh with a pistol, brought her ass with a triple beam
Blowin on some corn that clear my chest like antihistamine
Ridin through the D, on my side where the pistol be
One in the chamber, think a nigga tryna get at me
When it thump at ya, it hit harder then a Nitty beat
Tell them hoes to show me somethin, they startin doin that dougie
Bout 5 of e'm fine, and 2 of e'm ugly
1 kinda pudgy, she could still get my lovey
Say she from Ketucky-hollerin bout some distant lover shit
The whole time I'm thinkin bend over let me use this rubber bitch
My game on point so she had to fuckin love it
I think, I think, I think she like my dougie

[Hook-Lil' Wil]

[Verse 3-Lil' Wil]
Just gotta fade-dressed to impress
Bone with a shoe fetish, so you know I stay fresh
I ain't worried about that mess, a couple grand up on my chest
Plus Drew just brought a tech and I stay fresher then some zest
Don't want my shoes to get no specs, don't want no bitch to touch my neck
I'll tear this club up if I feel some disrespect
I just wanna find a chick, cause Lil' Wil just popped a X
And I don't wanna work hard cause I'm fiendin for some sex
Do my dougie fresh and watch them hoes get to choosin
Middle of the club, jammin hard to my music
Bet you can't do me like a Triple X movie
Pull the dick up out ya pussy, let it slap ya on the booty
Goin hard in the Jacuzzi, Oh my god I like her chewin it
Stars still persuin bout to give that thing a bruisin
Don't know what I'm doin better check me out fully
Mix that Dougie fresh with that Northside boogie

[Hook Till End]SHE WALK WITH A STRUT, WALK WALK WALK WALK
GO HARD GO HARD
SHE WALK WITH A STRUT, WALK WALK WALK WALK
GO HARD GO HARDGO HARD GO HARD
SHE A THOROUGHBRED SHE A THOROUGHBRED
SHE A THOROUGHBRED SHE A THOROUGHBRED
SHE A THOROUGHBRED SHE A THOROUGHBRED
SHE A THOROUGHBRED
SHE A STALLION, A SUPER BAD BITCH[Talking]
