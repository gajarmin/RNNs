[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boilin water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Mi casa su casa partna, mi casa so full of rahstas
More ganja then reefer farmers, you couldn't see me with binoculars
White girl with me; Cindy Lauper, multi deep like Frank Sinatra
Gave 10 birds to Waka Flocka, told him drop em at Moreland Plaza
Whoozy like the morning after, try me then yo skull get fractured
Ransom yo lil hansom son, so sad yo that first daughter captured
Gucci hot as boiling water, my pack just came cross the border
Your girlfriend's a major snorter, but that bitch ain't worth a quarter
Don't give that another thoughta, if you serve me and you shorta
Ounce a half a eigth a quarter, send my goons to do the slaughter
Hustle hard got from my father, take no shit got from my mother
Never snitched and never will, I put that on my baby brother

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Only one dude and I'mma smoke my reefer
Cruise through the city in my new two-seater
Stay low key and get doe wit my people
Maybe try to find me some blow a little cheaper
Only one dude and I'ma ride around town
Work got love bitch, drop a few pounds
Count a few checks deal them out
Shoot a lil dice, pour a lil out
Sell an Impala make a few thou'
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao
Mean mug everything about my team
Nigga say anything, folk will hit him in his mouth
Back in the day they said I wouldn’t be shit
Tell them fuck niggas "nigga look at me now!"
Mami on my dick, they worse than they bitch
It don’t make no sense we just laugh at them clowns
Pull up to the club everybody like "wow!"
Watch cost a car, car cost a house
Catch me in the club I’m stunting on the couch
Balling like a balla me and Gucci ballin' out
Shawty got it for the low who said it was a drought?
Swag run so hard man these hoes like “Ow"
Well known in the North, raised in the South
Connected out West get them in get them out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
In the kitchen with Patrick Swayze, me and the yay is dirty dancing
Drop a gold deuce and it white just like some Louie Glass
Stupid Brick Squad chickens in stankin' through the plastic
Gettin ‘em in and gettin’ em gone; definition of a trapper
I’m the hottest thing walkin' around in East Atlanta
So I’m like a baby, shittin' like a damn pamper
They hatin' my swag, cause these bars is Alaska
Hip-hop police got me workin' under the scanner
Coca cola where’s the water? Watch this doe I serve this order
One on the window, cause the police just might smell this odor
Barber shops and beauty parlors, just to cover dirty dollars
White girl was super dirty, so I put her in the shower

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
Soo Woo! To the B Gang, it’s a G thang, see me
I’m eyeballin' shorty, Gucci got the work and Flocka got the 40
Work the wheels, and hold the gun, smoke out my pistol, I wish you’d run
Nigga win some, like which one 100-round chopper or the handgun
Heard I ain’t never lost none, I got nicks and dimes you want some
I’m a legend in the hood like Big Pun, got bales of the mid you want some, I got them
Waka Flocka, Flocka Waka, midgrade bought me everything
I’m gudda gudda, gudda gudda, I put that shit on Gucci Mane
Brick Squad is what the fuck I claim, God y'all niggas off the chain (Loony)
Lookin' like he want my chain, I smoke him like some Mary Jane
And shorty that shit real talk
And shorty that shit real talk

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Shawty Lo]
Shawty Lo, call me Escobar
They try to retire me like the great Brett Favre
Still got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Even Nicki, fuckin' with my girlfriend
Yeah, we share that bitch
Got Waka Flocka, Gucci, Rocko in that bitch
Still in the kitchen, flickin' the wrist
And I’m still on the highway, takin' the risk
Back and forth, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20 with a bunch of them bricks
Ayy, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20, all white bricks

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Feds coming after us, niggas talkin bout jackin us
Married to that white girl so bitch I ain’t no bachelor
Brick Squad Re-up Gang, mothafuckin' yayo club
Lookin for another one cause I ran off on my last plug
Off white Jag, white truck, white Lambo
All white Porsche four door going ham ho
You know who I am ho (GOTTI!) You say I robbed yo brother
I don’t give a damn though; he must've had the yams low
He must've had them grams off weighing what I paid for
Too many of them bands now he laying on his man floor
I’m Yo Gotti nigga and I’m from North Memphis
In East Atlanta Zone 6 and I got the North with me

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Nicki Minaj]
I got that hard Gucc, you know these bitches easy
I got that cold flu, I got that itchy sneezy
You in that Mitsubishi, I'm in that Bentley GT
I'm takin' trips with Papi, you walkie-talkie copy
I got them pookie fiends, might rock some Juicy jeans
I mean some Juicy sweats; maybe some blue Giuseppes
I play foul; no free-throw
Bitch I ball, no free show, deadass; no peep-show
Bought our own condo, water-front condo
Daughter, son dundo; watchin' Telemundo
Flyer than a rocket, money in my polly-pocket
What'chu coppin'? Keep that work inside my Pippi Longstocking, bitch

[Hook][Intro - Juiceman]
Aye! Aye! Ok! Ok!
Juicy! Gucci!
Zaytoven, zaytiggi, So Icey Entertainment

[Hook]
Quarter-brick, half a brick
Whole brick, aye!
Quarter-pound, half a pound
Whole pound, ok!
100 pills, 1000 pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap: "Aye!"

[Verse 1 - Juiceman]
I'm booming, I'm bunking, I'm serving all the babies
Rap game easy but the dope game gravy
Young Juice man and my life is like the J.Kidd
With stupid fruity crazy swag, jumping on your lady
Banana-donk Chevy interior like the Lakers
LeBron James wrist when I'm fuckin' with the capers
Hit the trap, stay down, watch the paper
Wake up, booming out the house and J asking for a waiter
Half a brick, whole brick, got me buying Jacobs
Bourbon shoes, walking in the head of the gators

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
I'm twerking birds in so we working [x3]
Packing a truck, stop, a trailer back in
We big, flip jugs, we tote it off the forklift
The way my Blood kick you'd think he had a black belt
My scale so Big, Boy can weight his damn self
2000 pounds of mid, I sold that shit my damn self
Washer full of cash, dryer full of X pills
Red rag in my pocket same color my 'Vette is
My number lower than a ése from Texas
A quarter mil' in the mail is an investment
A sniper rifle like a soldier in the desert
An Eagle on me, boy, I'm known to tote a desert
I sacked an ounce up before I sold a record
He want a sack I told him "meet me by the Checker's"
I sacked a pound up before I sold a record
He want a brick I told him "meet me by the Checker's"[Intro]
I got hard dick for all these bitches
I get all their numbers I don’t call these bitches
No patience for relations kiss my Rari bitches
Niggas don’t know us we never saw these niggas

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got V12 sittin' on rims and I parked the bull back in my Benz
Got a fucking with a seatbelt strapped on it cause it's my friend
Breaking bricks down in my den I got bills stacked to my chin
Diamond jeans cost an M&M, why? So bright cut off a limb
Look at me then look at him
Hard top Bentley Bentley rims
Fucked two sisters wet the crib
In a drop top dunk I broke the rims
Back to back bitch call them twins
Got a hard top x and a drop top m
Call me iceberg slim can’t fuck with him
2k on weed - hell, that’s a deal
5k on lean, I'm leaning now
Drunk two whole pints, I'm dreaming now

Drop top Rarri showing cleavage, I'm on Cleveland, call it bleeding
Knocked your bitch don’t need no reason
Take my bitch then call it even

[Hook: Chief Keef]

Co-defendant that's a no
Can’t have that shit fly in court
One thing about young juice my
Niggas spied the pussy like a scope
Since you pussy I'ma send these hollow tips down your throat
Killa killer murder murder flip that nigga like a burger
I don’t shoot for legs so you know ain't no attempted murder
And Young Juice man stay with fire
Make me put you on a burner
Smoke you like a cancer stick
Make your momma deal my load

Born to go to war, man you got me talking like I'm Tony

Wrist black man white girl Charles Bark
I ain't never stood in line for no Micheal Jordans
I'm a rich nigga standing and I'm very important
I'm buying choppers for my army

He want a nine, I take two out
So that's a kinda quarter

Tone four button-down and my diamonds on kick
My watch on bling and your bitch on dick
Pulled up in a truck my H girl got sick
I'm trying to go pass than a New York Knick
Bout to go and get me a brand new Benz
I don't need no sucker standing by my six
Got a charger with a bodykit it bout to have a big
Trunk going crazy man I'm bout to take your bitch
Bankhead bouncing to the bouncing
It's Guwop behind the tint
And if Bricksquad ain't on the list
Many bouncers got a hit
All this Polo on me think it's Jojo in this bitch

She say she like my chain she want the same thing
First she got the bird with the pink rings

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
See she the type of girl that a nigga like
And she'll jump off she'll help a nigga fight

See that's my old lady she drive me crazy
But the homies in hood call her the candy lady

Busting up in this bitch, Flocka need a bad bitch

Got goons that's gon' shoot, tag your man in body bag

That's why I follow her she don't want tilapia
Just give her a cheeseburger and promise not to lie to her
[?] in the South before I got knocked
She'll get money from all of my side bitchs to bail a nigga out

That's why I call her my main squeeze, fittna drop with that cool breeze
When I see her I freeze I like to watch her like HD
Yeah that's my baby no Beyonce and Jay-Z
Cause she walk up on you and rock-a-bye baby

My wrist so rocky, I'm cocky
Cat smell like Issey Miyake
I wanna drag her for jockey
She wanna dig in my pocket
You move a gold digger in
Bitch will live in your wallet
You start out taking her shopping
She end up spend all your profit
I just fall, I don't call
She eat balls and the bitch bring broads
Don't get your feelings involved with dogs
Feed her to the wolves that'll hang with the boys
Sippin on oil, we got her spoiled
Rollin up guards got gas in jars
All my cars foreign
Sittin on 4's
Damn you gorgeous, what you on
She on molly, I'm on chron
We put lean all in the dime
Camoflauge foamposites on
80k on me and hun
Shittin on niggas I got the runs
Pissy jewelry, yellow charm
Baby dissin, why so frizzy
Need to sit out in the sun
PeeWee kiwi kush we blowin
Take your bitch that's what we on
Beat her up, RiRi Chris Brown
Diamonds dancin like James Brown
Pitch words like I'm on the mound
Baby know what I be on
I be in and out of time
I put my dick on her tongue

[Hook]
She turn me on, I'mma turn her on to me
And I turn her on, VVS all over me
Look at my arm, this Rolley got her feelin me
Don't turn me on, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree [3x]
She turn me on, and I got ice all over me
I turn her on, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
PeeWee Longway nasty ass
Hide that gas off in the past
Italian Stallion my watch rockin
VVS is my ear hockey
Longway Liberace
Karate chop the dope in huarache
Benihana eating steak and hibachi
Clap on, clap off, I'm rocking chandeliers
Pick ups, drop offs, I'm making drug deals
I got Christmas tree bells up making profit
On some crip shit, Longway blew the rastas
Sippin and spinnin still pourin up the codeine
Brick grip still coming down your chimney
Turnin me on and all now ya in the Remy
Blowin gas Mr. Lean with the white Remy
But rising diamond bars open, know you hear me
Super charged blue Hemi flyin down 20
Bought a Porsche just out the window, blue M&M
Can't stomach my bars, ain't as sick as him
I be hangin out with stars like wit Bush and them
Stems crushin my cigars like we kushin them
One button, push start, doing tricks in them
I'm talkin foreign cars, A&G kit'd them
She turn me on, I had to turn her on to Juice and them
And OJ turned her ass on to Gucc and them, Longway

[Hook]

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]

And you hot cause you ho done chose me
I'm a young nigga from the hood my nigga
Got these racks out the Bouldercrest corner
Texaco soldier
Deuces in the water
6's on my Charger, whip the dope a little hard
Try to see me a way, nigga better profit
Keep white just like a Nazi
Got gas, long dreads like a Rasta
Calamari shrimp type play pasta
Make moves just like I'm a mobster
Like a young nigga trying to win an Oscar
Plug came and his first name Oscar
Gettin paid since I first start walking
I'm not poppin when I'm talkin
Young Juiceman trending topic
32 Entertainment
1017, how can we explain it

[Hook][Hook: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boilin water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Mi casa su casa partna, mi casa so full of rahstas
More ganja then reefer farmers, you couldn't see me with binoculars
White girl with me; Cindy Lauper, multi deep like Frank Sinatra
Gave 10 birds to Waka Flocka, told him drop em at Moreland Plaza
Whoozy like the morning after, try me then yo skull get fractured
Ransom yo lil hansom son, so sad yo that first daughter captured
Gucci hot as boiling water, my pack just came cross the border
Your girlfriend's a major snorter, but that bitch ain't worth a quarter
Don't give that another thoughta, if you serve me and you shorta
Ounce a half a eigth a quarter, send my goons to do the slaughter
Hustle hard got from my father, take no shit got from my mother
Never snitched and never will, I put that on my baby brother

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Only one dude and I'mma smoke my reefer
Cruise through the city in my new two-seater
Stay low key and get doe wit my people
Maybe try to find me some blow a little cheaper
Only one dude and I'ma ride around town
Work got love bitch, drop a few pounds
Count a few checks deal them out
Shoot a lil dice, pour a lil out
Sell an Impala make a few thou'
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao
Mean mug everything about my team
Nigga say anything, folk will hit him in his mouth
Back in the day they said I wouldn’t be shit
Tell them fuck niggas "nigga look at me now!"
Mami on my dick, they worse than they bitch
It don’t make no sense we just laugh at them clowns
Pull up to the club everybody like "wow!"
Watch cost a car, car cost a house
Catch me in the club I’m stunting on the couch
Balling like a balla me and Gucci ballin' out
Shawty got it for the low who said it was a drought?
Swag run so hard man these hoes like “Ow"
Well known in the North, raised in the South
Connected out West get them in get them out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
In the kitchen with Patrick Swayze, me and the yay is dirty dancing
Drop a gold deuce and it white just like some Louie Glass
Stupid Brick Squad chickens in stankin' through the plastic
Gettin ‘em in and gettin’ em gone; definition of a trapper
I’m the hottest thing walkin' around in East Atlanta
So I’m like a baby, shittin' like a damn pamper
They hatin' my swag, cause these bars is Alaska
Hip-hop police got me workin' under the scanner
Coca cola where’s the water? Watch this doe I serve this order
One on the window, cause the police just might smell this odor
Barber shops and beauty parlors, just to cover dirty dollars
White girl was super dirty, so I put her in the shower

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
Soo Woo! To the B Gang, it’s a G thang, see me
I’m eyeballin' shorty, Gucci got the work and Flocka got the 40
Work the wheels, and hold the gun, smoke out my pistol, I wish you’d run
Nigga win some, like which one 100-round chopper or the handgun
Heard I ain’t never lost none, I got nicks and dimes you want some
I’m a legend in the hood like Big Pun, got bales of the mid you want some, I got them
Waka Flocka, Flocka Waka, midgrade bought me everything
I’m gudda gudda, gudda gudda, I put that shit on Gucci Mane
Brick Squad is what the fuck I claim, God y'all niggas off the chain (Loony)
Lookin' like he want my chain, I smoke him like some Mary Jane
And shorty that shit real talk
And shorty that shit real talk

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Shawty Lo]
Shawty Lo, call me Escobar
They try to retire me like the great Brett Favre
Still got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Even Nicki, fuckin' with my girlfriend
Yeah, we share that bitch
Got Waka Flocka, Gucci, Rocko in that bitch
Still in the kitchen, flickin' the wrist
And I’m still on the highway, takin' the risk
Back and forth, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20 with a bunch of them bricks
Ayy, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20, all white bricks

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Feds coming after us, niggas talkin bout jackin us
Married to that white girl so bitch I ain’t no bachelor
Brick Squad Re-up Gang, mothafuckin' yayo club
Lookin for another one cause I ran off on my last plug
Off white Jag, white truck, white Lambo
All white Porsche four door going ham ho
You know who I am ho (GOTTI!) You say I robbed yo brother
I don’t give a damn though; he must've had the yams low
He must've had them grams off weighing what I paid for
Too many of them bands now he laying on his man floor

In East Atlanta Zone 6 and I got the North with me

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Nicki Minaj]
I got that hard Gucc, you know these bitches easy

You in that Mitsubishi, I'm in that Bentley GT

I got them pookie fiends, might rock some Juicy jeans
I mean some Juicy sweats; maybe some blue Giuseppes
I play foul; no free-throw
Bitch I ball, no free show, deadass; no peep-show
Bought our own condo, water-front condo
Daughter, son dundo; watchin' Telemundo
Flyer than a rocket, money in my polly-pocket
What'chu coppin'? Keep that work inside my Pippi Longstocking, bitch

Smoking up the gas take a look in to my eye
Got the trap hotter than a Motherfuckin wildfire

[Hook]

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
Birds for 33, like I'm Scottie Pippen
Catch me in the kitchen, straight drop chickens
House on the lake, but I'm still fishin'
Nail-shop trap, fishscale city
Trying to dodge prison, trying to see a million
But at the same time, trying to make a living
'Round these nigga turtles, they rats like Master Splinter
Counting all this lumber got me with a splinter
Headed to the Crest, with bricks in a Sprinter
Ballin' all summer, trapping all winter
Plus I keep more chickens; Church's & Mrs. Winner's
And your girl dog? (Ayyyyyyye!) She a flippa!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
My bitch got a fat ass something like a stripper
If you on a paper route, then you something like me, nigga
Dope boy with a dope flow, bitch I'm a dope dealer
Yeah, I love my bitch, but I'll still fuck yo ho, nigga
Sold your brother a pound and had a threesome with your sister
Fronted my nigga a 20 pack and told him Merry Christmas
I'm full of that sizzurp and your bitch gone on that liquor
I had her goin crazy say she feel it in her liver
Spent a hundred bands on designer [?] and pistols
They hatin' but I don't give a fuck 'cuz they ain't fuckin' with us
In the middle of the gutter with the killers and the dealers
That's that Paper Route Empire, you get the picture

[Hook][Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'mma keep dropping verses
Hotter than the hottest summer
Eat rappers like Jeffrey Dahmer
Dope color Sinead O'Connor
Should I name another one
Unless you like President Obama
Wanna buy two extra commas?
All my shoes are Ferragamo
Lightning actually hear the thunder
Even Stevie Wonder wonder
Why yo baby mama call so much I had to change my number
Sarcasm, these bitches need to ride or ride past him
I wouldn't even give that bitch an orgasm
Miraculously my niggas stand beside and not in back of me
So disrespect my faculty, how dare you have audacity
The club packed to capacity, I cash out automatically
I spit these rhymes so radically, sporadically, fatality

[Chorus: OJ Da Juiceman & Gucci Mane]
I got the green, drank, pills, blow
Runnin round the town gettin money I suppose
I'm the gingerbread man (X4)
I got the green, drank, pills, blow
I can't get no sleep, just keep knockin' on my door
I'm the gingerbread man (X4)

[Verse 2: OJ Juice Man]
Gingerbread Man, i got white, I got white
Trap house bunkin up all night, take flight
Droppin 10 bases? its jumpin that white?
Trees to that paper so im something like a kite
Loud stanky kush and it tellin me to light
Extra loud diamonds and its lookin like a light
Roller skatin' money and my pockets just glide
Everday diamonds kuz they dont like to hide
Vvs light yea so you block yo eyes
Burnt color diamonds like a sweet potato pie
Hit ya color diamonds??? and get ratchet like a fly?
The brick man, the bread man I don't tell no lies

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I'm the man to get it in
I am on it and I go in
I am comfortable settin' a trend
I get bored and do it again
If I ever crossed a genie
I would ask her for a twin
Cuz the number time of paper
Cost me to gather up my ends
It's ???
AM and I'm drinking gin
I could act like we are friends
But I don't like to pretend
I got 30 stacks, need Ajax
Got your future price on my AmEx
I'm addicted to ballin'
I hear ??? and relapse
You SlimFast to bankroll
My stash gettin way too fat
No push ups, just cook ups
I'm booked up, I do one lap
There's ??? mayne and ??? mayne
And ??? mayne and I'm brick mayne
Got ??? all in my kitchen
So my house smell like cocaine

[Chorus]I'm livin' one helluvalife
Crazy colored karats, baby, cover your eyes
Front headlights and I'm smokin' on loud
One of those nights in my helluvalife

I brought a lot of ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar, girl, you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a helluva car
A ghetto superstar, it's a helluvalife

Rozay not beer, toast
Baby, say cheers, major ice make ya go burr
Cake so big it's like, yeah
Swag so stupid, I'mma real time heir

A buncha street niggas gettin off no legal
See me on front street but now I'm on cable, able
And it's human nature to hata playa gettin' papa
Money like skyscrapa
It's Gucci

I'm livin' one helluvalife
Crazy colored karats, baby, cover your eyes
Front headlights and I'm smokin' on loud
One of those nights in my helluvalife

I brought a lot of ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar, girl, you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a helluva car
I'm a ghetto superstar, it's a helluvalife

Went to sleep in Michigan, woke up in Miami
(Where?)
South Beach sleep with a bitch in my pajamas
On the most expensive liquor front the most expensive fos
Smoke the most expensive dro, rock the most expensive clothes

Cars that we ride ain't out this year
I got diamonds on my pinky, on my wrist and on my ear
Baby, I'm a chandelier, standin' at the bar
Like an ice cold beer, we outta here
It's been a helluva night

I'm livin' one helluvalife
Crazy colored karats, baby, cover your eyes
Front headlights and I'm smokin' alaf
One of those nights in my helluvalife

I brought a lot of ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar, girl, you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a helluva car
A ghetto superstar, it's a helluvalife

Michael Jackson diamonds, VVS colors
Pull up to the club in a '08 Mustard
Bustin' fifty bricks, dog use a little muscle
Young juice man, goddamn I'm a hustla

Ghetto superstar and ma money's super double
Prada shoe walkin, the rap game in trouble
Six go cookin', so the Juice bunkin'
Young juice man, smokin' pounds of that funky

I'm livin' one helluvalife
Crazy colored karats, baby, cover your eyes
Front headlights and I'm smokin' on loud
One of those nights in my helluvalife

I brought a lot of ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar, girl, you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a helluva car
A ghetto superstar, it's a helluvalife[Intro: Diddy] (Red Cafe)

That's it![Chorus]
I am the man, I am the man [4X]

[B.o.B]
Geah; up in this booth, so let me introduce
Myself to all the haters that debate on what I do
Yeah, they in my face but I fade away and shoot
I - beat up the basket that's the way I do
Yuh! Just like a bottle of vodka, I'm Absolut
The proof is in the product, I'm hotter, and that's the truth
I squish the competition with the bottom of my shoe
But competition is none, so what am I to do?
And I was worth it, yeah - since they birthed me
But now I've murdered these verses put 'em in hearses
I, ate all the food on my plate but I am thirsty
From open mics, the flashing lights, I learned it
And what I learned is the game ain't for certain
So I live my life, I ain't worried
While I fly my high behind curtains

[Chorus]

[OJ Da Juiceman]
Down South hustlin, came up from nothin
Trap in the apartment, with a controlled substance
Livin with my momma, 'til I got busted
Down on my dick, maybe start back hustlin
Moto' crack workin, so I'm bailin money
Sick cell phone, distributin to the junkies
McDonald trap got me gettin to the money
Turn the warm water then I count up the hundreds
Murder by trap, hand it down for the zombie
One trap car and it was mainly for the junkie
Been a damn man ever since I was a young'n
Blue color chain like it came from Yonkers
Candy colored jewelry like my name was Willy Wonka
Came to the club, truck tall like a Tonka

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
I, am the man, makin jumbo
Keep the game hot like a big pot of gumbo
Do dumb shit, but don't be thinkin that I'm dum, bro
Watch what you say, I hear it all like I'm Dumbo
You say you wanna rumble? Is your dumb ho?
Toe to toe you're bound to stutter or stumble
Take your tough talk down to a mumble
It ain't goin down in my house, like Mutumbo
But it's definitely an honor
To light your scaff' up for the money like I'm a brawner
Brother, brother I consider it a pleasure
To break you down to minimum measure, just for the leasure
(The leasure?) Oh shit, my bad, I mean the leisure
Forgot who I was talkin to like I got amnesia
Damn, back on the track again, the mack is back again
Get the word out to them boys and tell 'em pack it in

[Chorus][Intro:2 Chainz]
Sitting in the trap 'bout to go bezerk
I take a sip of lean then i go to work
Sitting in the trap 'bout to go bezerk
I take a sip of lean then I...

[Verse 1:2 Chainz]
OK now when I was five
I went to Popeye's
My mamma said "Tit, you want some chicken and some fries?"
I said "No Ma, instead I want a brick"
And i was slangin dope by the time i turned 6
I ain't learn ABC'S
Cause i was slangin keys
No vegetables when my mamma served me peas
And no bullies jacking
Cause i was pistol packing
My whole team had free lunch cause i was trappin

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I got a trap
I made a trap
Only time i don't be trappin is when i take a crap
I got a trap
I made a trap
Only time i don't be trappin is when i take a crap
I be trappin x12
These bricks ain't hard to find
They ain't no Bin Ladens

[Verse 2:Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane, i could make a brick out of a lemon
I accept cash, checks, and a box of chicken
All my junkies mad cause my dope got boogers in them but
Gucci can't help it, if i see it gotta pick them
6 rings on you could call me Scottie Pippen
All my bi*ches ugly, Like Eddie Griffin
Somebody please get Waka out the kitchen
Cause im trying make this dope
And that Ni**a always tripping

[Verse 3:Waka Flocka Flame]
WAKA FLOCKA FLOCKA FLOCKA
BOOM..SHACKA LOCKA
Yes, I be trappin
Cause I damn sure don't be rapping
I be sapping, i be yapping
I be up in Chuck E Cheese
Taking tokens from the kids
'Bout to play some fu**ing games
Like, FLOCKA x20

[Verse 4:Kayne West]
CHIEF KEEF! CHIEF KEEF?
You an Indian
I pee on your tee pee
I'm looking like a black Austin Powers
You looking like some black cauliflower!
Young Dreds that's that sh*t i don't like
Mop heads that's that sh*t i don't like
Young Dreds that's that sh*t i don't like
Mop heads that's that sh*t i don't like

[2 Chainz]
These bricks ain't hard to find
They ain't no Bin Ladens!

[Verse 5:Soulja Boy]
Now i wake up in the morning
I be trappin
I be up in the morning
I be swagging
I be up and im swagging
I be jumping, and im flapping
And im rapping and im Snapping
I be swagging when im trappin
I be all the way...

[Verse 6:OJ DA Juice man]
Young Juice man and i just cam from trappin
All my songs flopped but im still rapping
When im at the ATM im getting that money
When its Easter time i be hopping like a bunny
'67 cutlass and it goy the AYE
I went to New York and they booed me off the stage
They told me go home and threw tomatoes in my face
But i still got the trap so its "AYE Okay!"

You can take me out the hood, but I'm gone keep it hood (keep it hood!) (4x)

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
You can take me out the projects, not the projects out the nigga
Yeah you see I'm having thangs still, I'm gonna be a nigga
Liquor drankin, hit the grind
Pimpin' I did all the time
I ain't thinking 'bout no child support, I'm still gonna shine
Cause I'm still getting mine
One way or another doe
I ain't compromising with no judge, I ain't stuttered though
Others though, wanna back down, I'm fightin' to the end
If I get done up or something, I'mma gonna do ya in
A life sentence in the pen, what they want you to receive
I'm getting brain, making cheese, all that other's make-believe
And I still ride chrome rims and I shoot K's
Still hangin' with my dogs, and we blowin' purp for days

[Hook]

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]

Dekalb county dope charges got me twisted
Bubba Kush is blowin', and its in a Swisher
Ghetto broad, ghetto car, its a perfect picture

Apartment raised, I didn't do no picket fences
Been shot eight times so they got me high defenses
Pussy nigga leg shooter got me with a limpin'
Scrap bitch, yeah I'm strapped bitch, with an AK

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
When you see me in the club, fool I'm reppin' Tennessee
Arkansas and Mississippi, they just like some kin to me
Cause we ride the same way
More ghetto than section 8
Hustlin' to get our pay
Grew up shootin' on a crate
Can't forget about 201
Lower level powder (??)
Waking up with hard lids, funky breath, and sour dreads
Fighting cases, lawyer fees
Dropped the case, I copped a plea
Would have gave my life savings up so I could see them streets
Then I be back to the hood, where we watchin' over our shoulder
Ridin' with a hot pistol, hope police don't pull me over
Over in the bay, where we keep it North, understand
Take the man up out the ghetto, not the ghetto out the man

[Hook][Hook: OJ Da Juiceman]
Trapping it into the bando
