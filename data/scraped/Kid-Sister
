[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Aye, yo this mutherfucka's jammin', I'm on it it's an anthem
Who is that in the Phantom, please no cameras
They gone have me on Concrete Loop in my pajamas
To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammers
I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome
I was pretty before the dough but now I'm just the man
You remind me of my old chick
On that eighty four shit
Oh shit
Did you see the way she got her toes did?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Sister]
Girls be so thirsty, thirsty
Fast forward o the end of my song
And say third verse me, verse me
Whenever I hit block I see
Tricks try to rehearse me, 'hearse me
From manicure sets to silky weaves
They be so grimy, nasty, bogus
Germy, dirty, uh oh
Sure did, ou ain't slick
Naw, let the pioneer blast my shit
Wait a minute, hold up
Bubble letters on my butt say "fresh"
Oops I'mma go, bails like whoa
Acrylic base, top all gold
Colors on my nails to the paint on my toes
Stay fresh, I'm accustomed to gold

[Hook][Verse 1]
I got my own style and I got my own grace
I work my own angle, what you trynna say
I got my own cut means I stick my own green
And green-eyed monsters be first on the scene
Like yellow foxes, eyes in the sky
Always flip quick like can I get a ride
Can you get a ride man, can I get a spot
I see you throwin' shade out the corner of my eye
I'm from the go, so I keep movin' on
From the freaks out night to the early morn
Blue muhfuckas done got me gone and we ain't leaving till I get some
I got my records, I got my own taste
Shoes Louis Vuitton, power suit, super cape
If you get to yappin' say it to my face
Dial 3-3-1-59-88, holla at me

[Refrain]

I got my own rhythm and I got my own bass
I got my own kickers and my motorcycle dace
Got five on the ride baby I got trace
Like she ninety-nine gotta keep it grace
Work so shinin' but you whinin'
Chillin at the Superwards, checkin out behind him
I got eye on them, man I grind on them
Even pop that booty when I'm rhy-a-min'
That's right, Ima learn ya how
I moved up and I got my own piece of pie
Not pizza pie but I got a good record like Domino's line outside for five
So you wanna kick it to a down-ass jawn
With my man cold chillin' and my glasses on
Uh, I done told you don't call my phone
Only broke hoes creep on the low
So I got my own singles and I got my own cuts
Switchboard shucks and I got my own struts
I know you hear me comin' so you betta listen up
And get that ole style while we're pissin' out ya cup
Holla at me

[Refrain][Verse 1]
Said you were my baby
And your love was true
But as soon as I turn my back baby
Look what you go and do
Start sneakin' it, too
Usin' me like a fool
Now I know the deal
I could see right through you

[Refrain]
I said, you ain't really down
Playin' those games you do
I said you ain't really down
Your love was never true, oooh

[Verse 2]
Woulda bet my life, with you all this time
That you were the one for me, baby
How could I be so blind
Gave you my love and you used and abused it
Broke my heart like there was nothing to it, oooh

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
No no no I said
You ain't really down
Playin' those games you do
I said, you ain't really down
Your love was never true
You ain't really down
Cause I know u been sneakin' around
Tellin' me lies, using alibies
And u think to yourself, I'm so sly
But the games to play won't work today
Cause I'll never believe another word you say
So I know the deal, you've been playin' the field
You just ain't for real
Gave you my love and you used and abused it
Broke my heart like there was nothing to it, oooh

Better get your right hand hi

Where you from? South side
Where you from? West side
Everybody from the best side, I’m ripping the Midwest right?
Gotta keep that hand up high
You know I keep these nails nice
If you hear me holla, I gotta get that hand up
Hi I’m Kid Sister and I’m stacking money, drinking all night

Hi I’m Kid Sister and I’m stacking money
Drinking all night got you feeling right
Better get your right hand hi
Hi I’m Kid Sister and I’m stacking money
Drinking all night got you feeling right
Better get your right hand hi

Get that hand up, Get that hand up
Gotta get that hand up
Better get your right hand high
Get that hand up, Get that hand up
Gotta get that hand up[Verse 1]
Said you were my baby
And your love was true
But as soon as I turn my back baby
Look what you go and do
Start sneakin' it, too
Usin' me like a fool
Now I know the deal
I could see right through you

[Refrain]
I said, you ain't really down
Playin' those games you do
I said you ain't really down
Your love was never true, oooh

[Verse 2]
Woulda bet my life, with you all this time
That you were the one for me, baby
How could I be so blind
Gave you my love and you used and abused it
Broke my heart like there was nothing to it, oooh

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
No no no I said
You ain't really down
Playin' those games you do
I said, you ain't really down
Your love was never true
You ain't really down
Cause I know u been sneakin' around
Tellin' me lies, using alibies
And u think to yourself, I'm so sly
But the games to play won't work today
Cause I'll never believe another word you say
So I know the deal, you've been playin' the field
You just ain't for real
Gave you my love and you used and abused it
Broke my heart like there was nothing to it, oooh

[Refrain]
