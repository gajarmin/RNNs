[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales call it level up
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me 91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, "there go Mase!" there go your cutie

[Hook: Kelly Price]
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
I'm the D to the A to the D-D-Y
Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots
Rip all the spots, rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
I know you thinking now when all the balling stops
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
10 years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A, be on your way
Cause it ain't enough time here
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square

[Hook: Kelly Price]

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
B-I-G P-O-P-P-A
No info for the DEA
Federal agents mad cause I'm flagrant
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement
My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya, mere mics to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch? Never that!
If I did, ain't no problem to get the Gat
Where the true players at?
Throw your Rolies in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye
Player, please, lyrically, niggas see B.I.G
Be flossing, jig on the cover of Fortune, 5 double O
Here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know
I got the dough, got the flow down pizat
Platinum plus like thizat
Dangerous on trizacks
Leave your ass flizat

[Hook: Kelly Price][Total]
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Just tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want

[Hook, also by Total]
Tell me what you want for me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is something you can have for years
Tell me what you want for me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is something you can have for years

[Ma$e]
Now Ma$e be the man wanna see you doing good
I don't wanna get rich, leave you in the hood
Girl, in my eyes you the baddest
The reason why I love you, you don't like me cuz my status
I don't wanna see you with a carriage living average
I wanna do my thing so we be established
And I don't want you rock in them fabrics
Girl, I will give you karats 'till you feel you a rabbit
Anything in your path, you want you can have
Walk through the mall, if you like it you can grab
Total it all up and put it on my tab
And then tell your friends all the fun you had

Repeat Hook

[Ma$e]
Hey Mama, won't you come here to Papa?
You don't like the way your tata's lookin at Shada?
In a 600 ain't no smokin' cigada
Come over here, I think I see your baby faddah
Here ya go the number to my casa
If you in a rush you call me ma√±ana
Whatever you need girlfriend, I got the whole enchilada
Just the way you like it, Ma$e gon' do you propa'
Girl, I can tell you was meant for me
I can tell by the way you was sent to me
While I'm on tour trying to make them centuries
And they ask who your man, you better mention me
If you don't you know you got a problem
Said you want no beef, girlfriend, don't start none
And it just so happens that I'm seeing cash
Cuz you messed up a lot just trying to be fast
And I ain't gonna ask who smashed the E-Class
Pull up to the crib with the whole front crashed
Now you wanna laugh, good thing that's the past
If you ever lie again, girl, that'll be your last

Repeat Hook

[Ma$e]
Now the more you treat me royal I adore you
That's why I don't mind doing these things for you
You did things for me I wouldn't believe you did
That's why I always want to keep you here
In a year or two, girl, I could see you with my kids
Girl, you make a thug want to get a legal gig
It's only right we spend our lonely nights
Gettin' crazy biz till we awake the kids
Don't get too loud, got respect for you honey
To keep it all real, you come second to my money
And can you be my ghetto love prophecy?
Everybody love you girl, not just me
And I know that you really care a lot for me
Wanna see you happy even if it's not with me

Repeat Hook until fade[Intro]
You ready Mase?
Party people in the place to be
It's about that time for us to

[Verse 1]
Yo, what you know about goin' out
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck
Piece all glittered up, stick up kid, nigga what?
Jig with a cut sip Cris? Spit it up
Ho's ride, get your nut 'till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I'd a hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall?
Hand on your balls
Lighting up drugs always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my fresh clothes
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
Whether friend or ex-friend in a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end
Come on

1 - Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could

Ah ah
You can't understand we be Waikiki
Sippin' DP til' the TV, look 3D
Little kids see me, way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome BB's, they wanna be me
Nigga's talkin' shit they ought to quit
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just started seeing cars because they auctioned it
So while you daydream my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybeline
One time you had it all I ain't mad at ya'll
Now give me the catalog, I'll show you how daddy ball
Six cars and power to fire big stars
Sit up, CEO style, smokin' on cigars, nigga
It's like ya'll be talkin' funny
I don't understand language of people with short money
Come on

Repeat 1

Ah ah
Do Mase got the ladies?
Do Puff drive Mercedes?
Take hits from the 80's?
But do it sound so crazy?

Well me personally, It's nothin' personal
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
And I chill the way you met me
With a jet ski attached to a SE
Smoke my Nestle, no mad rap-ASCAP
Where my check be?
Problem with ya'll I say it directly
Went from hard to sweet, starved to eat
From no hoes at shows to menage in suites
Now I be the cat that be hard to meet
Gettin' head from girls
That used to hardly speak
Come on

Say oh, if you don't need a nigga for nothin'
Then say oh, if you don't need a nigga for nothin'
(I don't need a nigga for nothin')
If you don't need a nigga for nothin' (2x)
Then say oh
If you don't need a nigga for nothin'

[Verse 1: Mase]
She spit on the tip like she cursed the cock
She wasn't a freak, least at first she not
She got at thing for thigh highs and Birkin crocs
She pick up strands of long hair, she search the drop
She don't do burger spots, she like to splurge a lot
And if the twerkin' stop, it's cuz the merchant drop
And you don't ever catch my chick in a thirsty spot
Though she ain't king of diamonds that don't mean that she ain't worth a lot

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mase]
He don't love it like I love it
He don't treat it like I treat it
He don't touch it like I touch it
He don't beat it like I beat it
He don't see it like I see it
Eat it like I eat it, leave it like I leave it
Cause really he don't need it like I need it
A chick that bad, she need her own bottle
She need her own space, she need her own ace
She need her own rave, she need her own place
She can't keep sharin' me, she need to own Ma$e
Come on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eric Bellinger]
It's unbelievable how your body is calling for me, yeah
It's calling for me, yeah
It's unbelievable how your body is calling for me, yeah
It's probably cause you got your own money, girl

[Hook][Intro: The Dream]
Look at your money, ooh momma, this could be you
On the right side of this drop
Ooh momma, throw it in reverse
I call that back it up and drop a
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Baby, baby baby, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Dream]
Ohh, girl I think that she like
I got that shit that make niggas want fight
I got that shit that make bitches act right
Make bitches act out of spite, aiight
Ohh momma, I got that bomb
I got that shit make your ass go run
My shit, not make niggas get guns
But the white girls say, "Where you get that cool beat from?"

[Pre-Hook: The Dream]
She love it (she love it)
Every beat of the drum, she sprung
She say I make her wanna touch it, she love it (she love it)
She make me wanna touch it, I love it (I love it)

[Hook: The Dream]
We buzzin', yeah
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker, yeah

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yeah, I've been known to chase 'em, known to replace 'em
Shoe game outta this world, I outer space 'em
Known to have a hundred and one, like Dalmatians
Maybe if she special enough, I'll glass case her
Get caught cheating and I gotta let you stick me up
Let you shop 'til you drop as a pick-me-up
Bergdorf bandit, Barney's for the burglary
But these bands lift the whole store like Hercules
Get raunchy in Givenchy, my palm reads
Passports, Pinot Noir in arm's reach
Paddle shiftin', push-button, no car keys
The pent houses are poolside with palm trees

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: Mase]
Uh, one-two one-two guess who back again
Uh, Harlem in this-what? Yeezy let Manhattan in
Get my mic right, turn my levels up
Get the light right, turn my bezel up
You either bounce on it, go 'head throw your mouth on it
So many ghosts in my garage they think my house haunted
Long as my buckle say Hermes, the rumors I'm not concerned with
They wanna garnish my earnings before I send it I burn it
You know them people too convinced that my money's gettin' rinsed
Her Lou B's seven inch, they TMZ me through my tint
I bumped into Loon he like, "Well, as-salamu alaykum"
You know I ain't Muslim my nigga, I'm about my bacon
The shot niggas takin' you'd think I'm rollin' 'round with Reagan
A Mexican landscaping couldn't rake in what I'm makin'
Think you blew me up with your bougie butt
But you ain't slow me up, I'm on the charts, you move me up
I'm like a drug overlord, my jewelry's overboard
It's hard to believe dollar sign e-even know the Lord
Already wrote it off, so just ignore the cost
So when I'm rollin' off I'm showin' off with no remorse
Shamone!

[Hook]

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Bitch hold smoke longer
Choke hold so strong, broke your armor
Now you're wide open right?
You ain't even smokin' right
Bitch hold the smoke
Cough hope, Harpo
Purple gotcha knocked out, now you know you're smokin' loud
You're higher than a motherfucker
High in this bitch, high as a motherfucker
I'm high and this bitch fine as a motherfucker
I'm high as a motherfucker
I hear sirens, she dying in this motherfucker
Moment of silence for this motherfucker
I'm just higher than a motherfucker
I'm higher than a motherfucker
I'm higher than a mother(Puff) Bad Boy... we ain't gon' stop

[Verse 1]

(Puff)
Now it's Sean on the hot track, melt like it's hot wax
Put it out, all the stores, bet you could shop that (that's right)
Leave a nigga with a hot hat, fronting like
Bad Boy ain't got tracks (nigga stop that)

(Mase)
There's no guy slicker than this young fly nigga
Nickel-nine nigga, floss you die quicker (uh-huh)
This fed time outta town pie flipper
Turn Cristal into a Crooked I sipper

(Puff)
Everbody want to be fast, see the cash
Fuck around they weak staff, get a heat rash
Anything in Bad Boy way we smash (we smash)
Hundred G stash, push a bulletproof E-Class (ehehe)
I'm through with bein a player and a baller
Just want me one bad bitch so I can spoil her

(Mase)
Mase wanna be the one you respect, even when you're vexed
Rock Versace silks over spilled brunette
Got green never seen so you suck my jewels
Clutch my uz', anything I touch I bruise
Puff make his own laws, nigga fuck your rules (that's right)
Goodfellas, you know you can't touch us dudes

[Hook]

Don't push us, cause we're close to the, edge
We're tryin, not to lose our heads, a-hah hah hah hah

[Verse 2]

(Mase)
Broken glass everywhere *glass shatters*
If it ain't about the money, Puff, I just don't care (that's right)
I'm that Goodfella fly guy, sometimes wiseguys
Spend time in H-A-W-A-I-I
(Mase can you please stop smoking lah lah?)
Puff why try? I'm a thug, I'mma die high
I be out in Jersey, puffin Hershey
Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby
Though I'm never drug free when I'm the club, G
Though I know the thug be wantin to slug me (uh-huh)
Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)
Yo I think it must be the girls want to lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me
Brothers wanna: rock the Rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life (uhh)
I'm like, "Damn, how these niggas got that trife?
Used to be my man, how you gonna plot on my wife?"
Do you think you snake me, cause they hate me?
Or he got his Ph.D; Player Hater's Degree? (Ahaha!)

[Bridge]

(Puff)
Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't nobody hold me down... ohh no
I got to keep on movin

[Verse 3]

(Puff)
Quit that! (uh-huh) You a big cat? (yeah)
Where your chicks at? (yeah) Where your whips at? (where dey at?)
Wherever you get stacks, I'mma fix that
Everything that's big dreams, I did that (that's right)
Don't knock me cause you're boring
I'm record sales soaring (*whistling*) straight touring
Simply a lot of men be wantin to hear me
Cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh)
We spend cheese, in the West Indies
Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (ahehe)
You name it, I could claim it
Young, black, and famous, with money hangin out the anus
And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (who?)
Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)
We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)
And got a Benz that I ain't even drove yet

[Mase] Don't push us, cause we're close to the, edge
[Mase] We're tryin, not to, lose our heads, a-hah-hah-hah-hah

[Mase] I get the feeling sometime, that make me wonder
[Mase] Why you wanna take us under
[Puff] Why you wanna take us under
(repeat 2X)

[Hook] repeat to fade[Intro - Puff Daddy]
I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had 24 hours to live, what would you do?
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it?
Mase, what would you do?

[Verse 1 - Mase]
Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my Beretta, too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
Yo, yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket
Then go get a jar from Branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldy, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gonna play lotto, for what?
Even though I ain't gonna be here tomorrow, so what

[Verse 3 - Black Rob]
You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bare Spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one of them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Pause, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, get them cats I wanted to get
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in '86
Went home took a shower in ice cold water
And spent my last hours with my son and my daughter

[Hook - Puff Daddy]
If you had 24 hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would your ass deny that your ass about to die?

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Sheek]
What hey yo, if I had 24 nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papis' spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty and he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a book bag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller with the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to 23, I'mma be strapped with TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges with me

[Verse 5 - Styles]
If I had 24 hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin' the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the 24 I make it out the precinct
Shootin' niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds

[Verse 6 - DMX]
24 left until my death
So I'm gonna waste a lot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but I'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

[Hook][Intro]
Uh uh
Get Money all over again
Get Money all over again
Get Money all over again
Get Money all over again
'99, Double Up, uh uh

Yo, when you look in my eyes, what chu see?
A sincere man or just a bunch of G
Why second guess, the brotha would last
They took a whole clique from the George and the Ave'
The booties in Aruba, boats and hoover crafts
So if Biggie could love the dough, Murda could love the cash
Butter Benz, gave the Tahoe to my other half
If she got the Benz then guess what mami have
Why dread it, tell the waiter too much ice in the crib
Blink's so drunk, he think we singing "Nights Like This"
He say when he grow up he want a life like this
Sleep all day and plus you want ice like this?
While girls throwin' head I ain't even touch dice
I ain't trust Don King, how my trust Mike?
I date bull daggers, ain't I don't trust Dykes
Need a cleaner nina, cuz they don't bust right
I ain't stingy, when everybody see the plush life
Buy rims before the benz so I look just right
Girls love me try to get the girls that love Mike
All I need is cup of Kool-Aid, I got enough ice

1 - [Cheri Dennis]
All I ever wanted was you for me
Cuz that nigga who I'm with don't give a fuck about me
And all I ever wanted was to be there for you
Cuz that girl who you with don't give a fuck about you

You unhappy, and I can see it when you cry
You look like your life has just been minimized
I ain't your man, I'm your man on the side
You just call me when you plan to slide
And if you ever feel like you wanna creep
All you gotta do is just give me a beep
Only way I won't call you back less I'm asleep
Gettin' my money or layin' it wit' a piece
We hit the block, shop alot
She see her man, but she don't wanna drop the top
And you know that don't really mean a thing to me
Can't no girl ever run game with me
You know Mase, got alot of places to be
Spots in Ohio, kick in NC
And I be wit older dudes and know the rules
So if a man pick up I know what code to use

Repeat 1

If you cheat on me, I'mma cheat on you
If you don't speak of me, I won't speak of you
I'll tell you now, we wait about a week or two
Then I know what we could do
We could just get our food and stay in
Cuz people on the block is hatin'
They know your man and know we datin'
So we gotta do this just to stay friends
(OK) Amen

[Both]
I lay back, I zone
You say that it's on

[Mase]
Then the girl try to snatch the phone
So I knew I was happier home

Repeat 1 until fade[Verse 1 - McGruff]
Crooked corrupted criminal crime boss with cream
Cocaine hustler, blowing out the brains of busters
Be in my mansion chillin', inhalin' the ganja smoke
Counting mad cream, weighin' tons of coke
Guarded by thugs and Rottweilers
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Niggas get plugged when my Glock hollers
Skunk smokers, Philly and Owl ripper
Cristal sipper, I've been a willy for a while nigga
'Gruff got hoes, the man with all the nachos
Expensive hot clothes, drop top Rolls
East coast, West coast, fiends overdose
'Gruff get the cream with my team and I'm ghost

[Verse 2 - Ma$e]
This money be temptin' me, to jump out the MPV
Empty three clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since 14, I sold morphine for more green
Kept open a Nautica coat under the drawsting
And watched out for cops, squad cars, and Beemers
And laundry ninas, flee the country to Argentina
Laid back in the beach (yeah) coastin' with commuters
Smokin' the buddahs on the cruiseline boat to Aruba
For a while, yo; pump the vowel so I can pile dough
Then become a Harlem kingpin just like Alpo'
Get paid so I can lay low in San Diego
With yayo so I can ship it out whenever I say so

[Hook]
Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast, you know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown, Downtown; you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We ain't splittin' this cream

[Verse 3 - Cam'ron]
Yo! I'mma run hystrically, till they bury me
Count numerically,hills of Beverly
More grands than cherokee; president like Eric B., and Rakim
Drug game, I'm top ten; locked in? Right now its not an option
And those who creep got the Mac in the heat
They got the five-inch screens in the back of the seat
And now they got this daddy raggin'
Last year, had me saggin', wasn't ready
When Heavy was back, tossed me in the paddywagon
But ain't nobody out here stoppin' love
Cause we was twelve years old in the Cotton Club, poppin' bub'
So all the fame without the fortune; goddamn, you wrong
Killa kid Cam-e-ron surviving in the Amazon

[Verse 4 - BloodShed]
Yo! I leave you dazed and froze
With all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded I counted
While bathing with Asian hoes
Back home niggas is after me
I'm back to sea, sippin' daquiris
Coke factory, fiends baggin' up crack for me
From cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
Nautica yachts, and knots busting outta my socks
Now that Bloods play the chub
All the ladies love me, they hate who made me hubby
Behind my back they say my baby's ugly
Each night I sleep, with freaks with Lamborghini jeeps
Neighbors be sneaking peeks, how my semen leaks, between the sheets
Mess up my loot, I cut your collars, Juan
Cause these is modern times, and the only thing I see is dollar signs

[Hook]

[Verse 5 - Big L]
Check it! To be seen clean in the mean Beam
Is every team's dream; Big L's a cream fiend
With more green than Springsteen
You know I'm crazy quick to smack a groupie
I'm known to mack a hoochie
Do I got stacks of lucci (Absolutely!)
Harlem kids is known for felonies
And sellin' keys, pushin 300Z's
GS3's, and puffin' trees
These G's breeze while DTs
Be yellin, 'freeze!', we stash cheese
And keep a pocket full of centuries
Ayo, I'm set for the rest of my life
Some clown that laid the threat cause I had sex with his wife
I stuck my tool to his brain, so that fool can get slain
Nigga, yo' bitch chose me, you know the rules to the game

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yea What? Harlem on the Rise

Cocaine hustla, blowin' out the brains of bustas
Be in my mansion, chillin', inhalin' ganja smoke
Countin' mad cream, weighin' tons of coke
Guarded by thugs and Rottweilers
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollaz
Niggas get plugged when my Glock hollas
Skunk smoka, Philly and Owl rippa
Cristal sippa, I been a willy fo a while nigga

Expensive hot clothes, Drop top Rolls
East Coast, West Coast, fiends overdose
Gruff get the cream wit my team then I'm ghost

[Mase]
This money be, temptin' me, to jump out the MPV
Empty three clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since fourteen I sold Morphine for more green
Kept dope in the Nautica coat, under the drawstring
And watched out for cops, squad cars and Beamers
And larger ninas, flee the country to Argentina
Lay back on the beach, yeah, coastin' with commuters
Smokin' the buddhaz on the cruise line boat to Aruba
For a while yo, pumped the vile so, I compiled dough
Then become a Harlem kingpin just like Alpo
Get paid so I can lay low in San Diego
With yayo and ship it out whenever I say so

[Hook]
Yo, makin' that money's the American Dream
East coast to West coast, You know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown or Downtown, You pick the scene
You got to get your own scheme, we ain't splittin' this green

[Cam'ron]
And in Florida, its Cam's Orlando
Lyric soprano, Me and my Cuban connection Fernando
Sellin' bags of camo, streets be ran with ammo
See me late night, take flight
Dropping though these eight flights
Hold my blade tight, forced to do wrong to make right
Now they got this daddy braggin'
But last year had me saggin'
Wasn't ready when Teddy was baggin'
Tossed me in the paddy wagon
And life's an obstacle, often I just stop and pull
Brothas like to act, that's why I make sure that the Glock is full
Reporters shootin' photos of Killa shootin' the Glock, I'm loco
Drinkin' vodka dolo, sellin' yayo in Acapulco
So all the fame without the fortune, goddamn you wrong
Killa Cam Cameron, survivin' in the Amazon

[Bloodshed]
Yo, I leave you dazed and froze
With all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded, I count it, while bathin' with Asian hoes
Back home niggas is after me
I'm past the sea sippin' Daiquiris
Coke factories, fiends baggin' up crack for me
From cuttin' up rocks to investin' in stocks
Nautical yachts and knots bustin' out of my socks
Now that Blood's paid in chubby
All the ladies love me
They aim to make me hubby
Behind my back they say "My baby's ugly"
Each night I sleep with freaks with Lamborghini Jeeps
Neighbors be sneekin' peeks
Of how my semen leaks between the sheets
Mess up my loot, I'll cut ya collar swan
Cause these is modern times
And only thing I see is dollar signs

[Hook]
Yo, makin' that money's the American Dream
East coast to West coast, You know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown or Downtown, You pick the scene
You got to get your own scheme, we ain't splittin' this green

[Big L]

We stash g's and keep a pocket full of centuries
Ayo, I'm set for the rest of my life
Some clown that laid the threat cause I had sex with his wife
I stuck my tool to his brain
Said "Act a fool and get slain"
Nigga yo bitch chose me, You know the rules to the game[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Beautiful... Pain

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Niggas studying shawty know what a hundred do
Actually the nigga backing me is right in front of you
Raising a daughter sometimes depending what her father do
Niggas stunt on you, front on you
Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you, them niggas lame
I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain, dickhead
By the time you get there
I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack
Her lips and her hips thick
My boxers are covered in her lipstick
Her pussy fat but ain't good, so that's a misprint
I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond
Shiny watch look like the old Diddy on my arm
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada
Run this rap shit, I got stamina
You an amateur, I aim at 'cha, I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha
Fuck you and whoever came witcha
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha
Like a tattoo of a framed picture
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member
I got some gambling scriputres like um

[Bridge: 2 Chainz]
Scared money don't make no money
Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga

[Hook: Lloyd]
Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
See what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Shamon.. hm-mmm
You talk about hurting try washing clothes with no detergent
Daddy deserted so he now serves sandwich serving
Dreaming we had a furnace so cold sleeping on the curtains
What can I say it got me highly motivated, mama two job working
But now the companies are merging
Need a two week notice before they say don't need your service
I'm too young to have burdens, but still feel I should be further
But who I'm I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them
My mama need earnings, ain't had no time I had learning
Call me a hypocrite, backslider, you name it I done heard it
The way they speak of me you think I'm already murdered
It's hard to be laid back, my haters so assertive, but
I gave my life up, I gave my rights up
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up

[Interlude: Ma$e]
You don't see my pain
I guess it's beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain
Sometime you don't gotta say much

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
Life is a game of inches
Every move leads to something better
Theres no time to pay the bitches
Gotta get in the game and live forever, and ever

[Interlude x5]
I'll be the man or I rather die

[Bridge + Hook][Intro: Mase]
This Mase, you know what I'm saying
You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggas that don't wanna see me rich
You got niggas that's mad cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know the, those PHD niggas
But you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though
See it's a difference
A lot of niggas pop shit
But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit
We come to bring it to y'all niggas, me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever, Black Rob
If you wanna dance, we dance

[Verse 1: Mase]
Now trick what, lace who, that ain't what Mase do
Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face boo not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit and make a nigga say, rewind that
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo
Getcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says okay my tint smoke gray
No way, nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my six
Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
I was in one bedroom, dreaming of a million
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling
I was a gentleman living in tenements
Now I'm swimming in all the women that be tens
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins
Hoes of all complexions
I like cinnamon
Mase you got some hoes well nigga send em in
What you waiting for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz...)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way
It's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there girlfriend I'm ticklish
And I be switching fees with a wrist full of G's
Nigga please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy and Mase]
Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies cum
Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks
I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, nuff money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

[Refrain]

I know where you reside right there on the East Side
Street wise, I don't just roll alone we ride
Loon all smoked up, Meeno wanna rob you
J might feel you, Hud wanna kill you
Mase wanna let it slide, Stase wanna get you high
And walk you in that wrong building
Now you at the wrong place, and it's at the wrong time
You got a long face cuz now you see this long Nine
But whatchu lookin' scared for, nigga?
You only in some things you ain't prepared for
It ain't that you not my man, but Mase my man more
And family is the only thing I stand for
Blinky Blink, yo, I know alotta nigga's tell you this, dog
But I would die for you nigga

1 - [Mase & Harve]
Blood is thicker than all this here
Don't be worrying 'bout the cars, the clothes
The money or these hoes
Blood is thicker than all this here
Cuz anything you love in life
You can't take it when you go

Blood is thicker than all this here
Don't be worrying 'bout the cars, the clothes
The money or these hoes
You know blood is thicker than all this here
You heard me, blood is thicker than all this
Blood is thicker than all this, blood is thicker than all this

[Mase]
I'll be whatever you call this
I'm Cash Money like them Hot Boys in New Orleans
That thin vest you got on, slugs'll go through all this
And burn, so when you see me salute and fall in
I'm real and only the real would understand me
Got love for my nigga's that's why the chicken's can't stand me
Wasn't for your mami I woulda got the grammy
But that's what nigga's get goin' against they family
Know a boy dealin' with Stase, get dealt with manly
Whatchu think the cops could do, come and can me
Bell was Plan A, nigga's go wit Plan B and end no where
Cuda Love or Cardan, bein what about Dre
That's my nigga, going against Stase I clap my nigga
When money involved it get solved with automatics
You don't mess wit' me, you mess wit' Hud and there you have it

Repeat 1

And truthfully a nigga can't do nuthin' to me
On the real you know my nigga B.I.G. used to school me
Said never do a show for less than a QT
If a nigga get to you, he gon' get through me
And if a mugger move wrong I put one in his coffee
If a nigga shoot at you, you know he gotta shoot at me
More then less, my mother used to warn me for the best
Said Mase, nigga's gon' love you, nigga, long as you fresh
Long as you hot, long as you cop
Long as you not that nigga who be doin' never come through the block
But think about it now Mase, who wouldn't love you alot
You take nigga's around the world with girls suckin they cock
But just because a nigga ride witchu, fly witchu, high witchu
That don't mean when bullets come he gon' die witchu
It be them niggas you be knowing that long
You be killed, run up the block with your new Rolley on
Don't be quick to flip a nigga brick and spend what's on
Cuz if they recognize you stole them pots, bring the war
Now you could skate now or stick around
But don't be afraid to call the name when this all go down
You feelin' me now?
Cuz if I'm showing you something that you never seen
Then you gon' shake when you see this dusty M-16 come off the shelf
I know we kill for what but what they brought
Nigga we came to kill you, got the gun put in sto'
And what about the block nigga's, can't get nuthin' in his coat
Cuz them the same nigga's we took 'em on, they wanted to smoke
So leave them niggas there

(You back kid, Bad Boy for real, Let's go)

[Verse 1]
Before 99 I was born again
5 years later and I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Mase broke, that's a oxy moron
Forget a bus, I bought a drop to tour on
G-4's What I soar on, uh
You thinkin I ain't hot you so wrong
Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gone make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me
Ya hairs stand up
Been a change of plan
Rip your old plan up
Instead of hatin
Help me lift the big man up (As we proceed...come on....yeah)

[Hook]
Awake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Wake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
(Betha I love this one...endeavor, for real, Bad Boy)
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go

[Verse 2]
Some days I make thousands
Some days I make millions
Spend my day chillin
Coupe's with suede ceilings
Everybody out there wanna know what Mase got
Way hot gray drop Maybach gray yacht (Whoooo)
And that's just the way it be
Favor, people wanna pay for me
When I'm in Mr. Chows, they waive the fee
And I don't chase money man
Money chase me
I give my wife things that she dream and more
I give a little bit, and she fiend for more (lets go)
I'm back like Moses to bring the law (Come on)
Brand new saint Mase in mean velour
I had bling before you ever seen the tour
Fans from Iran and Singapore

Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go

[Verse 3]
I used to be the guy stood next to Diddy
Crucified for bringin sex in the city
Even though the girls think I'm extra pretty
How I know? I ain't got no extra wit me, oh
With the fist tight flow
Wit a wrist like whoa
What if this might blow
Ain't no if I... know
I'm the man to plan the way
This ain't my life
I've become a saved (Say what)
Put up a good fight
Like its mandalay
Hate the game, but it made a man a man
Gone for a while, its like I ran away
God tI'me now, and I don't plan to play
I'm only here for the one thing you lack
And make dj's scratch is he is he back
Kids in the hood stutter it's a it's a fact
It's the kid resurrected it's a it's a wrap
(As we proceed, to give you what you need, he's back)

There's no guy slicker than this young fly nigga
Nickel-nine nigga, floss you die quicker (uh-huh)

Everbody want to be fast, see the cash
Fuck around they weak staff, get a heat rash
Anything in Bad Boy way we smash (we smash)
Hundred G stash, push a bulletproof E-Class (ehehe)
I'm through with bein a player and a baller
Just want me one bad bitch so I can spoil her

(Mase)
Mase wanna be the one you respect, even when you're vexed
Rock Versace silks over spilled brunette
Got green never seen so you suck my jewels
Clutch my uz', anything I touch I bruise
Puff make his own laws, nigga fuck your rules (that's right)
Goodfellas, you know you can't touch us dudes

[Hook]

Don't push us, cause we're close to the, edge
We're tryin, not to lose our heads, a-hah hah hah hah

[Verse 2]

Spend time in H-A-W-A-I-I
(Mase can you please stop smoking lah lah?)
Puff why try? I'm a thug, I'mma die high
I be out in Jersey, puffin Hershey
Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby
Though I'm never drug free when I'm the club, G
Though I know the thug be wantin to slug me (uh-huh)
Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)
Yo I think it must be the girls want to lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me
Brothers wanna: rock the Rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life (uhh)
I'm like, "Damn, how these niggas got that trife?
Used to be my man, how you gonna plot on my wife?"
Do you think you snake me, cause they hate me?
Or he got his Ph.D; Player Hater's Degree? (Ahaha!)

[Bridge]

(Puff)
Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't nobody hold me down... ohh no
I got to keep on movin

[Verse 3]

(Puff)
Quit that! (uh-huh) You a big cat? (yeah)
Where your chicks at? (yeah) Where your whips at? (where dey at?)
Wherever you get stacks, I'mma fix that
Everything that's big dreams, I did that (that's right)
Don't knock me cause you're boring
I'm record sales soaring (*whistling*) straight touring
Simply a lot of men be wantin to hear me
Cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh)
We spend cheese, in the West Indies
Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (ahehe)
You name it, I could claim it
Young, black, and famous, with money hangin out the anus
And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (who?)
Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)
We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)
And got a Benz that I ain't even drove yet

[Mase] Don't push us, cause we're close to the, edge
[Mase] We're tryin, not to, lose our heads, a-hah-hah-hah-hah

She already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you)
If she got with you when
She already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you)

[Mase]
Mase, come on
If I'm in the streets or I'm in my jeep
And I wit my peep, ex know not to speak
See it's all good, and it's all sweet
All women flirt, all women cheat
So I might spend a week down in Virginia Beach
Out or in the sheets blaze plenty freaks
Be the bad boy everybody wanna meet
Practice what I preach, never caught when I cheat
If I ain't work late, I say I was wit my peeps
And quick to tell a ho, yo I ain't get the beep
And all these girls is quite the same
So it ain't your pencil, it's how you write your name

Repeat 1

[Lil' Cease]
Ain't nobody hotter than the jam, don dada
Been around the world with girls at Ramada
Never been the one that chick, lotta scotta, protta
And yo when Cease got a girl he gotta
Though I love a ghetto girl that keep her doobie fly
39 in my Benz them niggas and super size
Girl talk slick but I see through the lies
You don't got TV, whatcha mean who am I
If you knew what I knew, you wouldn't be givin' her pearls
If you know that she cheap why you live with the girl
Half you cats couldn't live in my world
Cuz you couldn't picture another nigga hittin' your girl (what?)

Repeat 1

[Jay-Z]
Is it because my game is stronger, name last longer
On the brain like a whole eighth but can
Chicks stop, mesmerize rub up on they tetas
Like push up bras, who you dealin' with ma, he's jigga
You know the rawest, ice is flawless baby
Nice is lawless, recite for balla's
And I fools ya'll fake players every time
Cuz you only hit chicks that you think is mine
You know how I paid his due, but I'm unfatable
Mommy screamin' pappi can I skate wit you
They wanna ride wit me, stay fly wit me
Wanna help me get rid of my rivalries
Wanna be the ebony to my ivory
But I'm straight though, thanks ma, I only chase dough
We can lay for tonight but in the mornin'
I get Shirley Murdock, I hope your door slam lock, I'm gone

Repeat 1

[Mase]
Yo, you can't think you gonna be cheatin and the girl ain't gonna cheat

My wrist‚Äôs out as I hit the corner, them 50-pointers bling hard
Got a million dollars in the bank and I‚Äôm still swiping that Link Card

Not only that, I feed the killers, I cleaned up all their credit
See, I ain‚Äôt startin‚Äô no rap beef, but we got heat, got money
Touch me and you gon‚Äô see just how much loyalty niggas got for me
Walk inside that studio and start squeezing off in that bitch

Yo, I barely know you
But the way you front, make you wanna blow you
You rappin, but you local, my shit is goin global
Niggas ain't ready, nah, fuck figures that petty
I want bricks so thick, you cut em with machetes
Any nigga met me know I'm bout gettin cheddy
Ain't nothin fancy, settle for 1500 chevy
I watched my man get banned tryin to plan scams
Done ran grams on a pan am to san fran
We want the money, so it's a must we get paid
I puff in the shade, rock clothes custom-made
Send bricks to papi, be big as liberacce
You don't believe me? nigga, watch me
Unfold your phone and call up all your soldiers at home
Tell em you saw mase in rolling stone holdin a chrome
Now he probably out in a poconos strokin hoes
Smokin those, celebratin, open the mo? s
A cool guy, even a cool guy can't get too high
Even his boo'll try to set him for his moolah
The cops take us to where a cell block await us
I watch my capers clock and paper rock on glaciers
Yo l, I ain't got to tell you what to do

Packin toast, this host is quick to roast the mic, then I'm ghost
I'm not a soprano like that italiano sammy gravano
Mc's be gettin knocked off like Paulie Castellano
This little menace be guzzlin hennessy
Props from here to tennessee, police wanna finish me
You know I hate jakes, they mad cause I make papes
I'm large like the great lakes, with drug spots in 8 states
Chillin, makin sure this money is right
Sippin sunny delite, hittin every honey in sight
Playboy, tracks I like rough, ain't that right, gruff?
I might puff some green shit, but no white stuff
I shoot the gift like a quick fix, front and get your shit stitched
I drop slick hits (go l) get off my dick, bitch
When I was broke, you ain't wanna see me get rich
Now I kill tracks and flip bricks and murder nitwits
And I'm all about big bankrolls, clothes and hostin shows
Smokin foes and strokin hoes in the Poconos
Without cash you ain't meant to live
Signin out corleone, the uptown representative

Hey yo, gruff, man
This is yo track, man
What you waitin for?
Rip this shit

[ verse 3: mcgruff ]
Now my life somethin finer, it wasn't when I was a minor
See, but now I'm pumpin china
White, nigga, yeah, right out the diner
For this shit here I could get time in either
Facility, locked up where all the villains be
Make your first move if you're bored of grillin me
>from harlem world, take care of your mob and your girl
Too much dom, gruff can't starve in this world
.38 revolve with the pearl
My wolves hollerin at the moon as the earth revolve in a twirl
Blood thirst, nigga with dough get rushed first
Get him, a thug search, tell him these slugs hurt
Do you in, hooligans, timbs and rough shirts
Bust jerks, better duck when gruff squirts
Leave niggas in more pain than when your nuts hurt
Give niggas the business, done-done much dirt

Alright, alright
You see what I'm talkin about?
That's what I'm talkin about
Who started this?
Uptown
Who made this?
Harlem
Soon the whole world...
Everything's sugarless, baby
Now okay[Cam'Ron]
Aiiyo what good is all the guns and techs
And dumbs respect to keep your sons in check
If your cash don't come correct?

[Bloodshed]
Yeah I agree G
Cause most niggas got ghost figures
In 3-D and still can't see me

[Cam'Ron]
True, but people tend to get very jealous
When I got the Perry Ellis, but get the skelly when I'm buried fellas
And kids look at me, they crew be stressed
They thinking yo "He do be fresh"
Making more deliveries then UPS
But those that schemers used to diss me when I was a dreamer
But now I pack the nina when my crew is in the beamer

[Bloodshed]
Yo they used to think I was psycho
Cause I put the juice container in my bike to make it sound like a motorcyle
But now, I could afford a Ninja
I could even afford a Lex with all the trips to and from Virgina
See I'm all about cash profits
Expensive objects like tag watches
And bagging chickenheads in "Snack Boxes"

[Cam'Ron]
Cause I'm a plagarist that always pulls his razor quick
And keeps the flavor chicks that got North Faces to Avirex
I only know the fresh way, and on a stress day
I killed some Esses in Timbs and Peppes
Got guns for lead play

[Bloodshed]
I like to flash jewels, to the cops
To stash tools, made a lot of fast moves
So I can get

+Cash Rules+

[Cam'Ron]
+Everything Around Me+

[Bloodshed]
Extort me? Now how that sound B
I'm down with a pound that put rounds in clowns G
At the dice game, I keep the clean bank
Four foxes, clean gank, I ain't having nathan (nothing) to be frank

(Chorus)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Baby Doin It
Saturday, Sunday, a weekend thing
You know that we Doin It
I'll Time for Doin It (Hey) 8x

[Mase]
18 I'm depressed, only dream of success
I want C.R.E.A.M. to invest, I want a Beamer and Lex
Now I never was broke, when I was out measuring coke
Still I treasure my smoke, bought hoes leathers and ropes
I lost several men, in the borough and
I was out in Baltimore Maryland, trying to flip some herion
I sold bags of dust, I needed cash and plus
Dash Deluxe all we really had was us
I don't have to tell of fib, where I dwell and live
Bout what my fellas did
Homicide notify your relatives

[Bloodshed]
Sometimes I lounge in the crib, on the dolo for delf
Ain't combining my wealth, but sometimes I find myself
Wakin up in champagne shaped bathtubs, sippin some Alize
With a girl named Fay', giving me back rubs
Screaming she love but a Blood ain't a lady lover
I got brothers, baby mothers, on my mine just like latex rubbers

[Cam'Ron]
And I don't mess with hicky bringers
But I stuck a few tricky swingers
And had the girls screaming loud as Sticky Fingaz

[Bloodshed]
Ha, I like dimes I don't prefer the chickens
Chicks I'm known to stick them and leave 'em drippin wet like murder victims

[Cam'Ron]
Yo to me, women be crazy loyal
Some say that I may be spoiled
Cause I get rubbed down all day with baby oil
I hit you while your man is high
You be like damn his vibe, damn this guy
He had me open like I drink some Spanish Fly
I'm into nicks and hits...and a
Flicks to slicks, see the guys get stuck
But the chicks I stick

I buy the whole bar, my crew don't even drink
(Don't even drink)

We do sets behind the 'neck
That's my Denale right behind the Lex

When I'm 40, I'mma get all kinda checks

You want us do it again?

Spend big, you spend a little
So I take what's big and you take what's little
I bring a full stage straight up the middle
Girl too tight? Break the middle
Now, why be the illest if your money ain't the realist?
Mad cats hate on me, mad girls feel it
Cut a chick off, let Mase mess wit' her
Pre-nup these girls so I'm never stuck wit' her
Wanna coup our group nine eight car
Doin' 20 in a Bentley even wit' out a radar
You minor, I'm major, I don't play par
I'm a shining pay star with diamonds from Quasar
Peep all your script, I don't wanna pay y'all
Let me tear wit' my kids, it's what your days are
How the f you duck infrared laser
So my sympathy goes out to the lady that made y'all, yeah

Repeat 1

[Mase]
Yo, marchin' around the world and met no man
That had ice like Frosty the Snowman
And though my name Mase, what does it mean?
Dolla sign, no matter what I do, make C.R.E.A.M
Out of famine steak greens, Miller A-teams
And grew up pretty cuz my pop got great genes
I hold it down now that B.I.G. gone
I hit butt naked and then keep my kicks on
I don't get my Cris on, I throw a brick on some young bad chick
That lolly probably flipped on
You better get goin', you wanna live long
Can't nobody protect me like my tres cinco siete
If you front, you'll just read about it next day
I'm that cat you know you got killer respect
Stay out my way if you're feelin' my threat
You'll know it's real when you face feel a Gillette
And I come through the club with your deal on my neck, come on

All Out
All Out, Bad Boy
What
All Out, All Out
Let's go

Repeat 1 until fadeVerse One: Puffy
When night falls, that's when it all begins
Be prepared we can allow no loose ends
I highly recommend ya'll bring your arms
This is no false alarm
They want to do us harm
Like I'm nervous, live inside a glass house
They want to bring us down
Then drag us out
It's all about niggas that doubt our reputation
Startin conflict and don't know what they facing
Want twist us all in there black magic
? suggest paper of wars and break havoc
Are you ready, don't sleep on them
Ain't petty, you get that ass thrown like confetti
Meet me at the getaway spot in a jiffy
Leave all the does behind that act iffy
We got maneuvers, that's hard to beat
Till the other side retreats
Under six feet beneath
C'mon

Verse Two: Mark Curry
I told u that is a saw I wore
I'm a kill
When the rebel yells song that don't stop till
It's done, see I got guns and I m sick
See how you said meet me here and I came quick
Them same catz on the most wanted list
We can hit them, Then straight disappear in the mist
?,Won't cease to exist
I shoot to kill and I'll be damned if I miss
A warrior waiting for Armageddon
I get serious as hell when I'm threatened
Intent to get hostile break into a rage of fury
Send them back their apostle's fossils and crazed right
A rude awakening and but now I'm alert
And that's right down my line of work
The whole Brotherhood new verse, gutless cowards with no back
And watch how they all fall flat
Ahh
Chorus:
Niggas gone fall out
They got us up against the wall
Here to call out, let it all out
With or without you I'm for war
Some shit's worth dying for, ah-huh

Niggas gone fall out
They got us up against the wall
Here to call out, let it all out
With or without you I'm for war
Some shit's worth dying for, ah-huh

Verse Three: Black Rob
Yo
You want hot soup, I got shit like up on in Attica
Guns ridiculous like Battlestar Galactica
What's this, want to insult my family?
La Familia, actin like ones of us gonna kill ya
I want ya'll dues
Shit hit the fan, we going to be eatin' your food
Time up in the new
Then torture, I rip a niggas toe nails off
What, I didn't here the news five slayin the law
Man, how I don't want do these catz
I lay mousetraps for those mice house niggas that house gats
They want to out me, I know killers from down south be
Who know and understand, there ain't a thing sweet about me
I earn my respect, and I was born to wreck
Spit techs, by your rockets threw jets
Who's next, to get hit by firepower that's so raw
Go play 4-4's ready for war

Verse Four: Mase
All out, what what
Wanna blow, what what
Teamsters what what
Mother Fucker
]From Monday to Sunday, it's all about the money
Nigga ain't got mine, I guarantee I'm gun play
Moms says "Mase, you gon need that money one day"
Bitch I'm in the jet, Benz on the runway
Don't be fooled, still squeeze tools
Money like that, why the fuck I need school
M-A dollar sign-E rules
Hundred G jewels
Vacate places you don't even need shoes
Same catz say stay up, prey 4 my day up
No one where my bitch live, plot where I lay up
If you got coke way up, Got doe then pay up
Niggas shoot at me a nigga better spray up
Cause God forbid, you hit me in my Ribs and I live
Comin back and getting you and your kids

Chorus

Verse Five: G-Dep
Dom Dom Dom
Thought I heard something
Last cat that I heard frontin
Burned up herb huntin
Word cause, my heard something
Splurge something
Now I don't care who I hit
Its who I hit I knew I hit
Who would understand though
We vandals and land roles
Program for our own channels
And flannel, this man knew any clan
We're here for the catz in the minivan
Gotta let this schemmie plan
Pay me man, scan
Sex, cars any money
Sex guard the money
With this gun, it be hard to run me
Get it right, or get it tonight
Better tonight
Set up your wife, with the head of the night
Don't fold cause my goals imbedded with ice
To my tents dimming the light
I'm bendin this mic
Lot of niggas don't comprehend
Lots niggas look sloppy when
They don't see me and I see them

Chorus
Chorus[Mase]
Uh, uh, come on, uh
It be the same cats that wouldn't listen to my demo
Now I want they ass in my limo cuz now I'm a sex symbol
Intercontinental, L.A. airplay, just like Jay Leno
Now all the labels out wanna send a memo
To do a remix ya'll, but Mase say N-O
Figure once I make it, they'll fake it
And ain't nobody show me love when I was naked
And when he threw my tape in the trash, I laughed
Now a nigga' tape on blast, I laugh
Figure as days pass, make more cash
And I push everything from E to H-class
Four years ago couldn't go to a show
I was standin' on the corner sellin' dope for dough
Now I no longer hope I'll blow, smoke my dro
On a Yacht nigga, fuck a boat that row

1 - With all this money that we can make
Why ya'll cats wanna playa hate?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
With all this money that we can make
Why ya'll cats wanna playa hate?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?

[Mase]
Yo, the reality of it all, everybody can't ball
If you had currency, you wouldn't be worryin' 'bout me
But see, I could go the whole summer, gold Hummer
But I'd rather go Lex bubble, cuz it's less trouble
Make my dough and I just stack, no investment
I live off just that
Money, hoes, and clothes, and shit that I'm best at
But I'm a Bad Boy so you gotta expect that
Why do what most do? Do what you 'possed to
Make hot jams ya'll, sell bicoastal
If you want a hit you can let me coach you
Money back on anything that got my vocals
This is so true, I do what pros do
Cuz broke ain't a state that I'm tryin' to go through
Dealers give me credit any place I go to
Drive out in the Benz say "Let Mase owe you'"

Repeat 1

[Mase]
See, the moral of the story is
I'm not here to replace Notorious
I'm just a young cat tryin' to do his thing
Harlem World style, pursue my dream, cuz see
The things that went 3 mil, I didn't even like that
You say you got mad hoes, well where is she tonight?
Mase be the cat that'll lead you to the light
Messin' with me shorty, you'll be a-ight
Stop listen' to all them cats on the block
That tellin' you that Mase don't rock
Cuz Mase is hot and Mase got a drop and a yacht and a big knot
To move you and your moms off the block
For real though, Mase got real dough
That be in briefcases cats kill fo'
And since you can't beat us, it's best you join us
Cuz I know you won't have this hold that's on us

Repeat 1 until fade[Intro]
You ready Mase?
Party people in the place to be
It's about that time for us to

[Verse 1]
Yo, what you know about goin' out
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck
Piece all glittered up, stick up kid, nigga what?
Jig with a cut sip Cris? Spit it up
Ho's ride, get your nut 'till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I'd a hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall?
Hand on your balls
Lighting up drugs always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my fresh clothes
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
Whether friend or ex-friend in a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end
Come on

1 - Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could

Ah ah
You can't understand we be Waikiki
Sippin' DP til' the TV, look 3D
Little kids see me, way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome BB's, they wanna be me
Nigga's talkin' shit they ought to quit
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just started seeing cars because they auctioned it
So while you daydream my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybeline
One time you had it all I ain't mad at ya'll
Now give me the catalog, I'll show you how daddy ball
Six cars and power to fire big stars
Sit up, CEO style, smokin' on cigars, nigga
It's like ya'll be talkin' funny
I don't understand language of people with short money
Come on

Repeat 1

Ah ah
Do Mase got the ladies?
Do Puff drive Mercedes?
Take hits from the 80's?
But do it sound so crazy?

Well me personally, It's nothin' personal
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
And I chill the way you met me
With a jet ski attached to a SE
Smoke my Nestle, no mad rap-ASCAP
Where my check be?
Problem with ya'll I say it directly
Went from hard to sweet, starved to eat
From no hoes at shows to menage in suites
Now I be the cat that be hard to meet
Gettin' head from girls
That used to hardly speak
Come on

Repeat 1 until fade

Mase

Bad Boy

[Ma$e]
Yo check this out this Ma$e the Roy Jones of this rap shit

Niggas don't wanna get in the ring with me

Niggas sayin Bad Boy this and Bad Boy that
All we make is mad more hits and mad more tracks, c'mon!!

Y'all niggas in the back, steady sayin I'm souped
Your hoes in the front, steady sayin I'm cute (that's right)
Beep me all day just to lay up in the Coupe (ha ha)

Go blow six grand go catch a quick tan
I'm a big trick, drink expensive liquids
I see riches straight from the district (whoo!)
So how you expect you can jerk your check (I don't know)
Then you come home thinkin you deserve the sex
Yo I merk when I jet in convertible Lex
And I move too swift, might hurt your neck (ahaha)
I jump out the Lex with the iceberg sweat
Platinum chain hang with a third of baguettes (c'mon)
This year P niggas gon fear me, hear me
Wave my treble, put my shit on blazin levels
C'mon niggas, give em what I got
Since you want butter now you got to take it while it's hot
I wasn't gonna talk but you made this a issue
Now I got to get you, send dog to sick you
Pull a pistol, make all my shots hit you
Rip your tissue, send you place where they miss you
{Puff Daddy repeats in background 2X}
Niggas sayin Bad Boy this and Bad Boy that
All I hear is mad more hits and mad more tracks
Walk the Ave then kiss you, man you wish you
Never fucked with Ma$e, his work be official
Can't scar the man with ?don de farges?
That rock, everything from rap to R&B
Oh yeah, nine-seven, won't be your year
Don't go there, it ain't nuff dough here, you can't blow here
Ma$e alone, and with Puff, there's no fear
Bad Boy rule forever, we ain't goin nowhere
What nigga? Bad Boy, Harlem on the rise
{Puff Daddy repeats in background 3X}
All I hear is mad more hits and mad more tracks
Niggas sayin Bad Boy this and Bad Boy that

All I hear is mad more hits and mad more tracks
You bitches!
