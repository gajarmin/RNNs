I had a lady once stop me on the street. I was wearing white shoes. And she says, "I'm glad you're sticking with the white shoes." She says, "It makes me feel good."

[Hook]
Take this good advice
If they're gonna judge you for life
Say we can't always be fly
We gon' be good long as them sneakers white
You'll be alright
Said you'll be alright
Said you'll be alright
Said you'll be alright

[Verse 1]
Gucci S. Dots, whole hood had 'em
Ice cream 'fore the hypebeasts that's into fashion
Being forreal, yo try being Pharrell
When your black ass in a back class, the fronting was real
No Lauren London, we was on a budget
You know, sharin' Old Navy so the army could be fresh in public
Where the sneaker stores and laundromats get all the money
Cause it ain't 'bout what you're doin', 'bout how you're lookin'
When they love you for your status and your catalog
And everybody got a jersey to play along
Back then the hoes checkin' for your zapatos
So even dirty niggas had the foams

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Viotech trainers on the way to work
And we would quietly complain while Eric would lurk
That was the PG Plaza manager, managin' us
Yeah I'm standin' in Lucky 7s but slingin' them Lugz
Still have them Js for the low, low, and I could get 'em early
But I'm not without a conscience, I see people out there hurtin'
Got 'em for Penny Foams that was bought at this very store
And I think that was my shift, then again I'm not very sure
And that's a lot that can get to ya
When you're not sellin' drugs but the outcome is similar
Cause out come them niggas with pistols, tellin' you give 'em up
Now out come the moms with tissues cause you ain't give a fuck
Free lunch for everyone, income was very uh
On the second and 16th everyone would have every 1
And Reebok would carry pump, and that's not the scary part
These niggas love white shoes so much they'd be buried in them

[Skit]

[Bridge]
You'll be alright
You'll be alright
You'll be alright
You'll be alright

[Hook]

[Outro]
No matter how good or lavish us niggas got it
We just a bunch of ravenous addicts living for fancy haberdashery[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Simple minds get blown, shattered into pieces
My thesis is thick like the Book of Eli
We live we die, we put 'em in the sky
Free your mind as a slave like the Fourth of July
This a sandstorm created from original thought
I bust boundaries son, you just do what you're taught
My vocab is powerful, spit shit subliminal
Slang therapist, my whole style is criminal
Bugged like Bob Digital, fly visual
Mind body and soul, I'm a strong individual
Come through in the final hour, with gun showers
Stand the fuck up like Flav to fight the power
I'm an activist, socialist, deadly ass poetrist
Supreme Clientele, I'm a goddamn vocalist
My thoughts are so heavy I could change a generation
The x-factor, we puttin' holes through inflation

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
If you hit the rock bottom of the asphalt, that's likely your ass fault
My lines are cocaine, the flow is bath salts
I'm a for-sure Don, no one in your circle can box me
That's like an oxymoron
I flirt with building your empire
Gotta shake the snake in the grass and spark sharks to swim by ya
Cuz every meek head that speak street cred ain’t bangin heat lead
And probably cut like sweet bread wetting their sheets spread
So nigga holla, I coin phrases to trigger dollars
Its butterfly like the shirts made with bigger collars
Women thank the scholar, the broad stealer
Who laying them face down and ass up like a card dealer
The time ceases, I keep a bed with dime pieces
As I palm another phenomenon rhyme thesis
Because on the contrary, I get it popping like Dom Perignon beyond Tom, Harry and Dick
You can declare me as sick

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Highly contagious
Bathsalt flows leaving bodies all on stages
Locked behind cages, Don of all ages
Its Ghostface nigga never plead in the cases
But I plead the fifth, four-fifth by the belt buckle
Crack stone-faced niggas with the steel of a knuckle
Go ahead and chuckle, I have uncle murder your goons
Hoes and balloons, ODing on flights from Colombia
Pull your trunk through your neck when the cartel's done with you
Supreme talk boss, verbal holocaust I'm a thriller
Have you jumping out, they sleep, Wigs hand me a Miller
Sick the dogs sitting in their shoes
My iron monkies spit banana clips with thick traps like Terry Crews
Silverbacks with high tracks, fuckin relax
Got a duffle bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture rises in attack just like a vulture
Ghostface the next Escobar or Sosa[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Intro - Drake]
Yeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though

[Hook - Drake]
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 1 - Drake]
They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'mma take this hat off, and I'mma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Phonte]
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping bout trapping you's a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Elzhi]
They say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
No El' will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

[Hook][Hook: Dwele]
There's something I wanted to know, can we get closer
Yeah baby, seems like I've waited so long, can we get closer

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Girl you should come up for the week
I'll make you cum from the tub to the sink
Rubbing your feet in a luxury suite
Make sure you come with nothing on just a long shearling
And I'mma make ya toes curl up like they all earlin'
I'll whisper in your ear, tell ya something
Stick my tongue in your bellybutton
Reach down below, you know I'm well sprung
Hit ya from the back to get ya calves trembling
And pull your hair 'til its straight, you look half Indian
Laugh and giggling
With champagne bubbles tickle your nose
Before you I wouldn't throw my old nickels at hoes
I'm just glad we can get close, for breakfast in the morning
We can fly out to Paris, France for the French toast
You made me wait so long and that's a good thing
Now let me make your candy rain dampen your thong
I hit it off like a champion strong, for real
Your still bumpin' and grindin' even after the song but all along I, I

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T3]
Let me talk to ya, feel me for a sec
I love ya sassy ways I must confess
You're lookin' good girl, I hope you into sex
Sort of a model type with a splash of innocence
Your fashion (fash-shon), ass like your moms
I love that Tiffany charm thats hangin' from ya arm
And if we get it on I'mma take her back to the fort
Show her how I run game like an athlete in sport
Sweety I can see that money ain't a thing
Been doin' this for a while no need to explain it
You're doing swell girl, you're never doin poorly
You know I'm hoppin' in whips just look at the jewerly
Plus you need a man in your life
Yo someone who can hit it right, and plus got the right dough
Plus I'll treat you like a queen
Your place or mine I was thinking we should get close

[Hook]

[Dwele]
A lot of cats done tried it
I like to touch the na na, I
Know you act real shy but, know you get down
You're not that type we go
Just keep it low and let it go
No need to act up cause I, know you get down
Can we get closer tonight, I'll make it right
Touch you inside baby, I make you get down
Hold you very close, with or without clothes
Public or closed doors, we will get closer[Intro: ElZhi]
Let's keep it real yo and count this money
Put the Grants up in the safe cause we spendin' the Jacksons
Washington's go to wifey, that's what it's all about right

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Everything I write is like a fatality
I’m a pattern-punishing painter with a pen
Got a style kinda like sodomy cause I'm anal with the way I get it in
I'm a maneuver with the mic, like Drano
Moving through a pipe, I'm insane-o
You can lose your life, I'm biblical with this lyrical ability
Respected I’m here to get rid of these records
Get checks and fill up facilities
I ain’t sounding like no man
I ain’t holding no dynamite, I just got dino might in both hands
Nigga this is Elmatic
I’m with a chick with her tail tatted
She at Chanel baggin', pill addict
Ill, I’m still at it
For real status and you gon' be a vegetable unless you got you a steel cabbage
I woke up early in the mornin'
Dressed in black yawnin' said two of the best is back
Early in the mornin'
Dressed in black yawnin' said two of the best is back

[Refrain]
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
I got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Get a rush from how they bust, swear they was leakin' puss from
I don’t deal with hoes nor trust scum
And treat money like pussy, if I fuck it off then it must come (cum)
I stay fixed on lines that make your mind play tricks
When they mix, even my basics sound like The Matrix
I’m more vivid than Michael Bay flicks
What I say tricks, then it lay clicks to rest like God after day six
They left fallin’ from missin’ they opportunity
At the door nor death’s callin now they breath’s stallin’
And who could touch me, fuck who you read about
And haters, I weed ‘em out the same way I do my dutchie
I’m a maniac on track the way a train react
With smart bombs for dummies
And Dum Dums for braniacs
They only have a few minutes of fame
They caught flame and my pen is to blame
I get it in when you pretend it’s a game
The way racquetball and tennis became the game’s finish
Nine outta ten is exchange
And I’m tremendous, it goes without sayin’
With my pen insert, it’s sort of introvert
It’s not about playin’

[Hook x2]

[Stokley Williams]

The time has come for us to stop messin’ around
Cause once you know that I like having you around in my life
Oh baby
So many times I want to hold you
I want to say I love you softly in your ear
Oh baby
Don’t keep runnin’
My heart is yearning for your love

Keep runnin’
Can’t keep runnin’ in and outta my life
[Repeat x5][Intro]

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
I'm trying to get to memory lane
But wonder should I take the train of thought
Or hop on a mental plane
I don't stay far, but this a place you can't get to in your car
Travel, standing still, it's bizarre; but there you are
Like you never left, back in junior high with your report card
Trying to make a B out the letter F
Maybe that was me around the time that my brother was six
Before I got my first job and my mother was sick
It's like she never needed chemo, her hair looks long, flowing
Sometimes it feels wrong going
But then every corner that you slung
Hung with all your dead homies slung
But now they got breath in their lungs
Looking forever young, before they were stressed
In here they only dress in nothin' less than Guess
Timberland, Tommy Hil, Rockports, and a Pelle
I reach down and grab a beeper while I'm searching for my celly
Damn did I hear Bump and Grind that was the jam at the reunion with the fam
In front of the cam, I'm trying to kick it with my first chick
I used mom's Infinity
This will be the twelfth time I lose my virginity
Shit was the truth, I left and I stopped up at the Hip-Hop Shop Seen 'Tin, Dilla, and Proof
Bugz, Bad Vibes, and Grym, T3 when he was slim
Watchin' La Peace battle Eminem
Soon they handed me the mic to spit a rhyme and a verse
I was shocked to see the clock show the time in reverse
But I ain't wanna leave
Without hittin' my first blunt filled with chronic leaves
I choked up and couldn't breathe
That's the day I missed class, smellin' like twist grass
Mrs. Nash kicked me out because I'm not a kiss ass
So I visited places where spots got shot on a daily basis
Where kids pull triggers with babyfaces
Wait, I must be on the wrong side of the lane trail
Where they rob memory banks and end up in the brain cell
Where all my misery and pain dwell
I'm said to leave out my state of mind before the train bail
So now it's time to go
I threw the deuces up to Dilla, dapped up 'Tin and then I hug my mama slow
Yo
It's the place you wanna be, right
Next time I think I'll take the mental plane
Instead of the train of thought
Hopefully touch down
In a state in my mind, but I'll leave the mental baggage in the crib
Get back to that place
In Memory Lane{Verse 1} (Dilla)
Yo EL and 'Tin kill'n em, Three kill'n 'em
You thought we broke up but we was just reassemblin'
Ladies and gentlemen you barewitnessin
The villa on some classic shit like vans emblems
It's the guerrilla pimps, we bustin denim in the club
That you can't wear ya denim in
Freakin a rhyme til every line ends with a then and than
You dont wanna rump and stomp in Timberlands
Shout to my nigga Killagan
And all of my peeps that rep more D than 12 Eminems
Who let the dogs out and let Dilla in?
Fuck wit this is ya loss Gilligan
Sounds similar I'm not feelin 'em
Get the balls like Venus in Wimbelon
While I'm in them fly whips five Will and them
On some Kim and them All About the Benjamins
Still here

{Chorus}
Still here, never left, just switched the style up
Came through, made moves to get the crowd up
Its hard time "V" time nigga ya times up
Get rowed up for the Reunion

{Verse 2} (T3)
L kill'n em, Dilla kill'n 'em
Maybe we could hook up again back wit 'Tin and them
Together again like armed forces on some Fantastic Four or Four Horsemen
Can't do it without ya crew boy
Guess who boy, comin' through with two boy
Nobody but us that rap in a clutch
Passed and switched it up like kids in double dutch
Some couldn't feel our style or feel flow
Never talked our slang, never walked our road
All they know is these niggas is tainted
Don't know about those rovers that candy painted
We've been miss quoted, miss construed, miss understood, and over used
So we take this time to set the record straight
Critics skipped and did it anyway
Now you hear our raps wit Dilla and you all on our team
Till you heard 'Tin was gone was apart of the scheme
See! We still got love where was you at at?
Just cuz a nigga go solo think we turn our backs
Maybe we will reunite on some shit like that
But I gotta set it straight 'fore you twists the facts nigga

{Chorus}

{Verse 3} (eLZhi)
Yo T kill'n em, Three kill'n 'em
You thought we broke up and ya you rite we really did
I wrote a verse that I recited it was hot
But I had to rewrite cause I thought we was united and we not
But though all the love that I got for you
Partna I picked apart ya words and I'm shocked in the interviews
I been accused of not carin'
When the city threw your furniture out
Its not fair when I'm learnin about how stress you fell in a article
Forget a rhyme I'm just as real when I talk to you
And you know that we share Kodak moments
I wish we could go back
But don't act like you wasn't bugin out like a phone tap
Chasin' cars in the street
I saw you throw up hard in the sink
Then after hit the bar for a drink, who asked you to slow down?
Even though niggas told me you was gon' clown
But I tried, and you know I cried when I saw you wild'n at the State Theater
In the door by the side
Throw you in the trunk and found a preacher for you
Cause I thought you had unlawful demons on you
Sinkin fast in the deepest soil
Ya parents finally got you some help
You came out seemin normal and
I heard you on medication
Had a illness you couldn't heal with herbs and meditation
And believe me; Me and T, Three kept it low
Don't take this as a dis this is just to let you know that I love you
But watch the company you keep
Sware niggas don't care, but they love you in the streets
Get ya mind right nigga...[Intro]
Yeah, it's Elmatic, check

[Verse 1]
Yo let me start you from the Genesis far from where the finish is
No role models just empty bottles of Guinnesses
Roaches in the ash tray toss and gettin' fast cash the
Ski mask way for those who never passed class
Born inside of poverty
Probably they stack bread and crackheads never looked alive to me
Robberies and liquor stores tricks and whores
Reality was sick as yours so I blow trees stronger than sycamores
Now wait, let me get back to my past
As I rewind mine, before I got on the 1-9-9-9
Mother gave birth to this divine mind
Born with this arm, leg, leg, arm head like a Quran line
No paternity but as I'm turnin' three I learnt to be
Strong, pops moved along and he never returned to me
Thought I'd feel anger for an eternity
I bottled my feelings inside with
Pride is never swallowed followed
By killers they rise ride off of endo
Bustin' off cartridges through your window
Different from the one from my Nintendo
That line shoulda been my intro, here's when I started rappin'
Lookin' up to younger thugs with they heart at trappin'
Starter cappin' fly wheels
Thick chicks in high heels tellin' me my skills is sick
I was only eight slowly fate took its turn
I'm where hookers earn, money and drugs sell, it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
Check, I went to Peck Elementary, Lesenger, Cody
To graduate I had to take a semester with homies
Too busy writin' none of my time went into my assignments
Jot a line as my rhyme schemes maneuver like the Heimlich
Use to ditch class for bitch ass
Picture me a lot shorter my vocal pitch sound like it switch fast
Young and rebellious, hangin' with failures who L twist, the eldest
See me saggin' that's what my belts is
That's round the same time my mother is ill
Collecting mental scars waitin' for the others to heal
No one saw the vision everyone's beyond blind
Can't think about finding the meaning of life when tryin to define mine
I won't pretend its cool, was wet behind the ears
So I had to jump in this pool graduate and finish school
Niggas was mad that I owned a diploma they was just sleepin
They shoulda slept til they domes in a coma
I'm that bad shorty who been through the land of Berry Gordy
With a buddha man that grew a grand but gained 40
That ain't rich in all my hell I wasn't born with a silver spoon
Just a wooden one upon my kitchen wall
Now I rock shows from Cali Groves down to Wichita
Feelin' like a grew ten feet a couple inches tall
Just thinkin' back what was to doubt about my view sunny
Now it seems too funny cause even new money gets counted out
Nobody believed, only ones was J Barb or JAE.B Group
Money investments everyday be cool
You thought I fell, it ain't hard to tell[Intro]
Take a journey with your boy in the dark corners of his mental
Hope it stays pleasant

[Verse 1]
12 A.M., a knock's on his window
Through the curtains knew if he should let the person in so
It was his boy off of Pete Rock and he got
A gun he took from his reef box that come with three shots
He said, nigga is you down for this stick-up
Replied he's ready as they hopped inside the Chevy pick-up
Got to the spot, his boy Pete from the passenger
Through the glass at the dude with cash getting gas for sure
They saw his car by the leaded and unleaded pumps
The worker would serve him, head down, looking red and flushed
The dude turned around and (?) felt concerned and frowned
Plan a return, started the car, and circled out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
12 A.M., he's on the kitchen table
Dick licked enabled by a chick thick as J-Lo
He grabs for the last rubber in the stash he has
Too bad cause the (?) half and half
Replied stay here, that's what he told the skeezer broad
Starts to leave (?) small heater underneath his draws
Speeding in his car, appears as if he's drag racing
So fast, he almost go past the nearest gas station
Pulls aside at pump five, (?) for his errands
Looks up and sees an Arab staring at the get he wearing
The bell rings from him jerking back the door
Then he caught eyes with the person that was working at the store
In and out of each aisle, he finds the rack of condoms
But in his mind he kinda feel chills behind his back
Told the man at the counter to put ten on five
Then he turned around and saw these guys out the window drive
The worker caught his attention so he could pay the (?)
But was stuck when the truck outside was skating off

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
12 A.M., a man works for hours
To scan the amount of the purchases that land on his counter
This woman had a bunch of items
He helped her, she left, he bout to get dressed
But then another ride comes
He saw a Black guy who decide he possibly look
Like a crook, he shook, cause on this job you see robberies
Dude was pulling at the door but when he walks in
He's on him like a hawk when he walks man
His thoughts ran
Eyes watch him up and down, left and right aisle
Hit the rack stack with the back to back packs of Lifestyles
He came forward with the purchase but he felt nervous
The Black male seems he does crack sales, murders
The guy replies ten on five, the men drove by
He had his head down but heard it
When they skirted

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
They both hopped out the truck, pulling their mask down
It's obvious they didn't come here for gas now
The man behind the register saw the two coming
He reached beneath for his piece like a true gunman
Hands shaky, his hands forming beads of sweat
The two rush inside, the other guy hasn't seen them yet
One yells, hand me your earnings off every purchase spent
The (?) burning at the same time the worker did
Dude in the back, out there hiding behind the condom rack
Speechless, reaches to palm his gat, where the robbers at
He rolls high with a four-five, but with both eyes
Saw the second robber draw a Tec from out his coat side
That automatic that the Arab cat was shaking
He was scared and panicked
Shot the robber with the cannon blazing
After the robber caught the slug his foot was staggering
Clapping the Arab who perished and sent bullets scattering
The other robber was shot from a gun, that popped once
In the eye of the guy who was shopping for condoms
And even he was murdered when the Arab's gun spilled
Strays his way, so there he lay
Now everyone's killed

[Hook][Intro] [Royce talking]
Yeah, Royce 5'9". The M.I.C. Walk with me. Talk with me
A wise man once told me...he told me...he said...

[Verse One] [Royce Da 5'9"]
Back your bag, pick your punches
Know where you at and where you goin', fix your compass
Yeah, '06 is my year
Mo guns with no prints, for shit I'm prepared
Mo fun with your bitch
Well, now she my bitch, used to your bitch
Allow me to clear out the air
Yeah, I'm bout to pull out the pair
Stick out the thing, piss on the king
Like, get out the chair
Peel out and leave
Feel out the breeze
With the window down on the Vet
Shall I proceed?
Yes
The tattoo had to be in the right spot
To remind me of how notorious that my life got
True story
Used to hide the gat in my high tops
Adidas tracksuit, black and white like the White Sox
Feelin' as cold as an icebox
The older you get
You know where you stand
And you know when you might drop

[Verse Two] [Elzhi]
Yo, the game is mine
I rewrote the famous line
Off of spittin' flames designed the same as Spawns
Truthfully
I'm R-A-W, a big raw
It puzzles you like when you fumble through a jigsaw
I own toys that fold ya homeboy
This is for, my young niggas holdin' chrome on Joy
12th and Lawrence
Glenn, Dexter and Cone
That show death to a opponents
For no less than a Donut
Get your weight up
And quit mean muggin' niggas
Like you with your sister and she just fit her A cup
I would have smashed you before my mustache grew
It's like you crash when you pass through to get your gas fuel
The ladies say I got a way with words
But they don't know the half
I'll write a blind man a photograph
Subliminal
Any imbecile in general
Can suck the identical genitals from the general
What

[Verse Three] [Supastition]
I got the flow down to a science
None is identical
Can't be duplicated like the sound of the ?finda roads?
Can it be stopped? Hell no
Not until the day that my cell close or hell froze
I be strong armin', throwin' Tony Jaa elbows
Slangin' them mix tapes
Better my own buzz on the streets, fuck a big break
I wanna be mentioned with all the greats and pioneers
We heard back in the cassette tape and vinyl years
They say that my time is here
I ain't lyin' I swear
I'mma beast everything
I'm on my grind this year
From Elemental mag to XXL
I got love as well, without beef to double my sales
Don't let the smooth beats fool you
I'm rugged as hell
I million dollar flow, yet I struggle myself
Now
Let's make this clear
Some people will rob Supa this year
It disappears, the funds with quadruple

It's time to get live from the Backroom right now
I'm your boy, DJ Live
We gon' take you to the Motor City D-Town right now with my boy Elzhi
Elzhi step to the mic and talk

[Verse]
You can catch me out in [?]
For puffing on a jet in the sky, no raining
Yet I'm hydroplaning
El, extraordinaire in a pair of Jordan Airs
Exporting flare on rare recordings supporting snares
That's why I never wrestled with thoughts of not being special
I'm nestled in a celestial body, you just a [?]
I say and mention to make you put your two cents
In your memory banks and use it to pay attention
To that kid with the fitted, the D on the front knitted
The OGs passed me the torch I lit my blunt with it
And carried tradition, in addition to women wishing we married
Now on a mission, made position
And though I'm seeing commas
And diamonds may cause you to watch my watch
I rather brag about being timeless
So those who take fads and run with them, I make mad
'Til they stomp on their notebooks and they turn them to brake pads

[Outro]
Yeah
Elzhi
New album coming soon
PIMP: Possession Infinite Mind Power
What up Jae Barber
Glow365
Fire 4 Hire
We out baby
Detroit
Yeah[Verse 1]
I blow a blunt of blue widow listening to instrumentals
In a five star suite with paid-for incidentals
Hopping outta cars that you're convinced is rentals
I'm what's happening for a reason, there is no coincidentals
I'm honestly the best; anyone in your dynasty
Can test and get chewed like how piranhas eat the flesh
Pretend that, I ain't in fact coming off
Like a thin hat with strong wind at, soon as I
Lay the pen flat, it's certi-fied murder; I decide
Further your fate with nickel plate side burners
Bang bang to all my foes, leave 'em froze off dros
My flows keep niggas on they toes like orangutans
And roadrunners, I erase 'em like old numbers
In the celly, I push Pirelli's on gold Hummers
Get bread and dip from the scene like it was cold hummus
The Devil tryna take our soul that we hold from us
It's a gamble but still I chose to roll the dice
Cause my cold world feels like hell frozen over twice
I came from the bottom just to spit it from the top of the
Fitted, sicker than the clinic with the pox and the
Mumps and the measles, throw pumps at the
Chumps and the weasels, blowing tree stumps of the diesel

[Verse 2]
Set the track into flame, back in the game, packing the same
Two guns that I stuck to with accurate aim, and since I only
Got one shot to blow, I'm not missing
Next rhyme I jot'll be on the yacht with cod fishing
Niggas is twat and they should squat pissing; two I spot
Dissing off to switch up the story like where the plots twisting
They know about how I light 'em up and blow 'em out
Like a blizzy in the Benzie, getting Lewinsky
And Lohan like Lindsay, I cause a frenzy
As long as the world spins me around, you know I stay
Gunning for the throne, licking rounds at the crown
You dumbfound, all of these bums is thumbs down[Hook]
This is the unfinished stories of the streets, baby
Don't get it twisted cause the globe already does that
Live and learn, watch the Earth get a turn, 360
Boomerang, violent kid'll burn
Where I live at is so cold
And models that grow old
Cause niggas die young and go broke! Haha
Is it the way we is?
Is it the way we live?
How do we portray them kids? Negative!

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
This is the code of the streets that ain't wrote yet
Niggas starving, it's getting nippy
Red face taking cold steps
This trigger finger is itchy
The other hand is sticky
Robbed this nigga at gunpoint
The cops bust quickly
Before you know, dead
Bloodshed in the snow
5-0 shot him, one nice cop, the other rotten
Same cops the same night
Stopped a guy for no reason
Put his face against the windshield
He fucked it up while he was breathing
The rotten porkchop kicked his teeth in
Did it in the alleyway so nobody would see him
He recovered from bleeding
So the next evening when he got stopped
He said "F That!" and started squeezing
Bulletholes through the cops' car
After firing, he heard sirens
Dropped the gun, wishing he got far
Got his grandmother thinking
What did she do wrong
Got his brother putting like the same exact suit on
He wore to his boy's funeral
Over cocaine, fast life, fast cars
Money and gold chains
He sits through the sermon
While the preacher preaches
The same preacher that knows the bible
But don't know Jesus
He takes your hard cash and hard lass
In a Lexus Coupe
Pipped out with a chick
Busting his life out
Took a long stroke
The condom broke
And he didn't know it
Dick on the clitoris
Constantly spitting on it
Where the period at?
The stomach getting bigger
She needs money for the child
"Give it up nigga!"
The dough that she takes she spend it up on drinks
Puffing cigarettes while she's still pregnant
She didn't know until she had the baby how bad she was affecting it
Now he barely breathing, he could've been the next president

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
For the karma
Walking in the streets of the arma-
Geddon, young cats spitting fire armour
Never see sweet 16
Parents grow sour
Casket in the dirt, you throw flowers
Cats taking cold showers, for eyewitnessing
Murders, snatching purses from senior citizens
We living in the last days, the innocent
Bystanders in their pathways
24 hours turn into half-days
The gat stays in the thug's waist
Another hard decision that the judge makes
Murder was the case
The streets will get you beat
Like Tina Turner's face
Before she fought back
Stray bullets floating off track
Killing young kids, jump roping on their property
Where they once lived
Plus niggas ain't living properly
And we gotta be
These days
So we hustle like old folks in cabarets
Looking towards the bright side
Through a cave before we caved in
But the future looks dark, within a grave
Like a waistband, my arms and legs stretch when I awake
I thank God for it
Life, it takes God for it
Many led by this redhead guy
With a pitchfork and two horns
Lounging in a place that's too warm
For my nig-get-out-of-view point
I try not to do wrong
But I want to be in that limo askin' for the Grey Poupon, for a change
I'm sick of saving change from a coupon
I'm a rhymecaster that'll do
The same stuff that Ice Cube's on
With a suit on, and got bread
Thaw out your cold heart with hot lead
It's like a coin toss
Who got heads, who got tails?
Which one you thinking with?
It seems to me that cats would rather rest in peace instead of keeping it

[Hook][Intro - Elzhi - talking]
Yeah, yeah
This your boy Elzhi
Finally here now
It's been a minute though
You know what I'm sayin?
I came up from nothin
Doin my thing, so I got the right to brag swag
Makin money off music I create

(*scratching*)
"Create"

[Verse 1 - Elzhi]
Yo, the day that hell snowed is when El fold, poetry well told
It's entertainin, keep niggas trainin like the railroad
Stingman, what I bring in is dope as the kingpen
Slingin, OG's threw me beneath the wingspan
Expert, through the less dirt, but still my tec squirt
Bucked, then it gets tucked in, just like a dress shirt
Been a beast in a winter fleece, time for your dinner feast
With a pen unleashed, if there's a priest, within a piece
Quick to lead, stick chicks of the thicker breed
Get fricasseed with trigger speed, you puffin nigga weed
I buy hundred dollar bags, Cadillacs and polished Jags
Yeah, I show you how to brag, while the hours drag
Spit quotes that slit throats, bet it could split boats
Get votes off shit wrote, I'm the legit G.O.A.T
And no statistic, to bitch niggas I'm chauvinistic
I tote a biscuit, carry arms like shoulder discus ('scus)

[Hook] (*scratching*)
"You heard what I said"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create"
"Nigga you heard what I said"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create"
"Makin money, money"
"For the, for the, music that a nigga create"

[Verse 2 - Elzhi]
Remain a fresh goon 'til my flesh prune
You'll need a vest soon, to catch a chest wound
Have you rest, above the crest moon
On your block, get your door knocked
Then by my warlocks, who wore Glocks
And left you with stains too deep for Clorox
Run rap beneath sun cap, levels is untapped
Done laps around a spun mat, hoes get they buns slapped
Y'all panic for all static, that's what I call frantic
Lookin shook as a small planet, becomin volcanic
Off top, y'all soft pop, weak as a cough drop
I love cop, to stop in the mall, so I can club shop
Veteran, you better involve us all in the letterin
If I don't get your girl wetter than, I must have met her twin
Create rhymes that are straight bombs, and call 'em Napalm
I date dimes and maybe an eight, if she got great palms
'Nough said, get at a rough dread, so I could puff red
I cuff bread, I'm paid and got maids, that could fluff beds
I even snuff heads

[Hook] (*scratching*)
"Hey yo"
"Hey yo"
"Yo, yo"
"Nigga you heard what I said"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create" ...
"Nigga you heard what I said"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create"

(*scratched until the end*)
"Create" - 7XChorus (Dwele):
All that I want is to show you love
All I got to do is find the time
So when can I see you? (I see you love)
I know what you want
I know what you want babe

Verse 1 (T3):
Yeah yeah hit my ring ring call me
I know I'm always busy s-s-sorry and
We don't even see each other much hardly
It never stopped me from girl thinkin bout your body
Swear to God, she's so s-s-s-sexy
Thinkin to myself the lord must've blessed me many times
I wrote many verses girl, many lines about you & me
Us together intertwined
On some s-s-serious shit
Girl you got a nigga st-stuttering
Got me on some long term thinkin other than
On some diamond ring shit
Girl smotherin, we be t-t-talkin on the late nights
Takin trips to see each other on the long flights
Spending tour money on you girl I don't mind
But it's been a minute girl, you been on my mind
C-c-call me

Chorus

Verse 2 (Elzhi):
We brought each other pain, fought without ballin' a fist
Yellin, niggas could hear us through the walls & the bricks
Sayin what we don't mean
Stabbin each other in the heart through the back
And actin like the cuts just don't sting me neither
See the sun but the clouds make it smoky
You was my down chick when others just went down on me
Must've saw something in me to wanna birth my first
You changed my mind about raising a child on a earth that's cursed
Wonder where we went wrong when the thing's so right
When our future looked brighter than casino lights lit on the strip
In the bed you shocked me, bit on your lip
Sex was tighter than a leather outfit on a gimp
Was our feelins supposed to disappear the minute we kept, lost
Started out on a good foot then we eventually stepped off
Or is it just troubles that couples go through?
Mad on the phone can't hang up
But I'm hung up on you
Give me a call

Chorus

Are we in love?
Is it possible to have love within this relationship?
Cause now that I got the time
You should call me tonight
And I'll be alright oohh

Chorus[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Lions, tigers, gators oh my
They rattlesnakes necks no lie
Call that a bow tie
They hustle grams
Hope these dudes don't look at you
And see food
Cause even man with huge muscles clam
Slugs didn't move at a snail pace
When he sparked it
Your dog died then was found hog tied
Behind a flea market
In the forest where they air the streak
Grip on the hawk
And walk with a chip on they shoulder like a parakeet
For that success right now that few approach
Cause life's ills will make you
Turn a white owl into a roach
They think it's fly to bear arms
Like an octopus
Move everything from rocks to Kush
Even what the doctors push
They keep the fiends
In their bed buggin' that bites
Chicken heads in fishnet stockings
Pull Glocks in cat fights
Don't be a fool bridging the gap for the pigs
Just three blind mice
Cause a rat is teachers pet turned stool pigeon

[Chorus: Bill Cosmiq]
Carnivore
Hunger at the core
Cannibal tore us
So prey walk cautious
(On the island of grime)
Realigned ox cutters
Will defend my shrine
(on the island of grime)

[Verse 2: Vordul Mega]
Licking my paws
The foamy
The remains of cartilage
On the forest floor
Watching hunters sit on the horse
They move with adrenaline and force
Intent for a main course
To fulfill what's in my veins coarse
And remain cautious
Seeking more
Enabling all fours
Still blood on the jaw
Alluding from being up in the mass
After viewing the scenery
Becoming adaptable
Instinctively
Cutting through grass
With retractable claws
Had the forest look of rain and leaves
While gaining speed
Maintaining extreme balance
Achieving
With the mechanics of a cheetah
Behind me the sounds of people
Police and golden retrievers
Off of they leashes
As I came across it there
Steady my breathing
And proceeded to
Pounce and devour
Swallow the feces

[Chorus]
Cannibal tore us
So prey walk cautious
(On the island of grime)
Realigned ox cutters
Will defend my shrine

[Verse 3: Vast Aire]
Is it on(yo)
(on the island of grime)
Is it on(yo)
It's me
Vast Aire the anti fraud
There's no mystery God
Or Scooby Doo fog
You could be a crab or a slob
I'm Jimmy Neutron
My gun go hard
And at the game of life
My team plays rough
We don't got to believe you
That hard look ain't enough
It's probably a bluff
You make one false move
And its probably a snuff
I know cats that's starving
That's why I got
Hounds in Brooklyn
Wolves in Harlem
You don't have no heart
Why'd you start
You know I got bears in the Bronx
And every time the wind change
Imma spit game to a bad dame
A punk bitch
Giving me bad brains
I'm the most interesting man in the world
I sip on Dos Equis
And sleep with two girls

[Outro]
…Yeah
I.G.C
Crimson Gods
Bill Cosmiq on the boards
(Yeah)Checkmate crown me king this loaded fo' fo'
Will make you fold up like a yo-yo wrapped around a string
Buck 'til it spray there's pen in my knuckle that sway
That send trouble your way like NWA Ren coupled with Dre
The secret is out the sneak peak leaked
Now your speakers about to bust and just skeets skeets
Victory's mine sick with the rhymes should be a crime
Convicting me sentence it'd be a century's time
You're not worthy to tangle with me
You're not worthy to hang with a G
Just dangle and hang from a tree
The moment you feared and scared you know it
This poet pierce a mere opponent and split his dome up
From ear to ear for acting like he don't hear me clear
I'm untouchable as a hole in a chastity belt and sheer brazier

They all holler I'm ill over the beat
Don't get overly beat the way your forefather
Tore cottons from fields your forgot that the skills
Put heads in a headlock shot you dead from cockin'
And still lead shed with a red dot
Now these niggas eternally sleeping
I think they personally prefer to be breathing
Anyone versing me is certainly leaving
The Earth surfacing the surface sea in this region
Your dealing with the don a villain and a con artist
Find the heart these killings still my feelings isn't gone
Run in your place with wonderful grace
Don't get stomped in your face I'll make
Your lungs jump from your stomach and waist

Toast glasses for your host with the most classic flows
Of the coast you gasping like a ghost just 'rose
From a close casket eLZion the guy to keep ya eyes on
Until the day you die Satan fries in the skies gone
Want him it's over with don't walk towards me with
A chip on your shoulder you'll walk away with your shoulder chipped
I stole a whip already high and racing deadly combination
Like a itchy trigger finger with a load of clips
I put a rapper to sleep I'm the wolf harassing the sheep
Rolling grass with a glass full of drinks
My real life clash with the ink this ain't fiction
No I paint a picture that a flick would show Mean Chicks
Fiends sticks for blow addiction dough restriction
Rob your polo before popo roll in your jurisdiction
Part of a new bread sparking this toolie
You being wet like water on a garden that grew weed
It's my time to reign I blind the game when I shine
I ain't gotta combine these fine diamond chains[INTRO]
Yo man what's up with this word "love"?
I-I don't get it, I mean..
Okay, a brother could say he love his car, ya know?
He say he love hitting the pussy
He could also say he love earning cash flow.. you know what I'm saying?
What's wrong about that.. ya know?
It's a comparison of saying you love your fam.. you know.. you...you love your girl... you love life
I don't know.. lemme know, man... cause shit is like.. a puzzle but ah.. word up

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
So tell what me what is pure love
Me and poetry, got something going on
My woman wonders why she don't see me
Am I cheating because I love critiquing this art form?
Me caressing the pen within makes my heart warm
Speaking of heart
Cash's raft in her heart
And is it love?
Must be for me, man, cause my girl strays further apart
It's breaking her heart
My heart's broken, too
But I'll be more hurt if you called me wack
I would take it to heart
My relationship with my penmanship has grown thicker
It's been with me since I was young, now I'm a grown nigga
So tell what is really love?
My woman gives me love, I love to hit the booty
And she love to give it to me
Plus she love dick, and she love kicks in the size six
I love the way she look, pretty eyes, thick, arousing my private-
Parts, licking my parts in private
I love to hear her moan, a sweet tone with froze eyelids
Of course I love sex, do I think she my soul mate?
I don't know, cause I put my heart and soul within this whole tape
I present it, somebody told me love is not a limit
I guess it's true to say you love me and the freshest shoe in the same sentence
Bothers me, cause one probably weighs out the other
And if I'm equal to a gym shoe, she stepping on my soul
Cause through my 20 years of living
I done been through many notebooks and though many women
But it's only one I can open to see the truth that lies within 'em
Or whatever lies within 'em, I can honestly say I feel 'em

[Hook]
So, if I had to choose between her and it
I'd have to choose
My woman wants me to choose between her and rapping
But I think about it just as much as the words are rapping
See how they rhyme!

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Besides my woman bugging and me wishing I had lots of loving
Keep the mic hot like pasta oven
She got assumptions that I'm cheating
And claim I don't spend time with her
She says I'd rather bust a rhyme in her
Crown of a mic, my ex babes are like wack rappers
Sounding alike, both hate the fact that I'm emceeing
The studio I be in
While I'm trapped between the lines like riding with Drivers Ed teaching
She tryna throw me out them same lines like I'm a drunk Speed Demon
These evenings, I come home late
I'll be thinking about calling her but I hate thinking her phone late
Next day she illing, like "was your thinking cap on straight!?!"
I can't take this, but I'mma take this gift and make this my career
Where my support at?
I threw my heart into rapping, she tore that
Baby, what happened to trusting her?
Things you said before that?
Thinking my lyrics are lady, and poetry means pussy
And when I say "hit the tracks,"
She think it's some broad with tracks, shocked and appalled by that

[Hook]

C'mon ![V-Stylez]
MoSS, I'm..
The wrong type of cat, gritty nigga and I'm evil
Out for the presents, sneaky dude, call me Smeagol
Lord of the ring and when the bell go "ding"
Jabs looking very sharp, punches hard and clean
You never land, I'm too elusive for your amateur game
Spit it well, you didn't know? You better check my name
V-Style, get it right and I rep the D
Where everybody hood hard, yo I just emcee
It don't matter if you big or tall or who the shortest
Just show me where the challenge is at, call your florist
Cause I'mma John Wayne on your ass, that's true grit
Talk slick and I would damage your top, wig split
D-X on muh'fuckers, silly dudes can +Suck It!+
Take my twins from my waste, blast my Kirby Pucketts
Yo my brain propane, gas turn into flame
Straight fire when ignited, break you down to the grain

[Royce Da 5'9"]
G shit, we sick, we spit, fuck you
Pay me, fuck all that free shit, eat dick
Crew shining like shit, we split, she strip
We tip, blue diamonds got mammy all seasick
Now take a brief sit, here's a handkerchief tip
While I fall on the floor, 'nuff money for a cheap trip
Huh, bitch, now who I'm finna leave with?
Find a friend and come, who you wanna get on your knees with?
My jewellery sick, I got a disease on my wrist
My neck and the shit's making me freeze bit
Breeze in with my Angela Jolie bitch
She lick my underarms, you can call me B. Pitt
Any problems nigga, we fix, my bitch
Will hit you, be like boiling water nigga, she slick
That's a trip saying he slip
Always on point like a Christmas tree tip
Creep up and eat clips

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Aiyyo, I know you like how Rapper C is waiting
Cause D niggas recognize thee nigga waiting
Rapper remain patient, took jabs like a champ now
Every verse out need the Rapper Pooh stamp
I tramp on foes, face down for them hoes
Pity the fool, any fool likely to oppose
See right through them clothes and your real nigga pose
Real niggas won't say a word, case closed
Blessed with the pen game, take aim
Maimed your career off of this strain, the disdain
All on your face mayne, it's plain with no competition
Me and you in the same breath, don't mention
This is my position right now in the future
Sewing up careers like some well-done sutures
These are maneuvers, up the ladder I ascend
Clash of the titans, nigga fuck a new trend

[Elzhi]
This nigga biting while I'm thinking, writing, to get the ink ignited
So when he move it's like a streak of lightning
Fuck where the crowns at, this brown cat could leave the town flat
And beat you like the part of the speaker you pump the sound at
I'm not stopping the slot topping, so when I plot
Dropping something hot, you copped it, it got popped in
Vultures better duck, flows with lead is tucking
Expose the feather ducking, blows your head to chunks
Rip flyer before I dip, be quick, hip fire
Slip by you a line that goes off like a trip wire
I'm from the sickest city, your whole clique is kiddy
If your chick is pretty, she'll suck a dick, I'll lick the titties
Your type of rhyming got me bored but I'm a star
The kind that you found where the comics are, knock you off your feet
Fussing, I eat dozen, I move the streets, trusting
In some sweet crushing petite Russians, skeet bussing
Screaming like they bout to meet Justin
Timberlake, I tremor quakes, hemmers shake
I'm the one with the gems and cake
Extra smokes and skinny dips like naked folks in swimming lakes

[Phat Kat]
Around the world my fans know me for the flows I bust
The Polo I rock and hoes I crushed
And the sound of my voice turn haters to dust
But still making funky music is a must
The newest star in Catacombs giving haters the flux
I switched it, bounced it, upgrade to super-deluxe
My whole crew is dangerous, ain't no taming us
The fast get wound on point, the finger's blaming us
Simply, oh, oh, it's the year of the emcee
We're here to fill the void, the game been running on empty
Had a long day nigga so please don't tempt me
Cooked so much beef but my name ain't Wimpy
Bout to snatch all your customs, your bag's too skimpy
And my shit sound fresh when this the voice in this empty
Tongue's so sharp, I chop you niggas down to mincemeat
So fuck your money, jewels and cars, using it as camouflage
Need to focus on planning the strength in your bars
It's Phat Kat the living legend, still counting my funds
Because I never kissed no ass, I stuck to my guns
While you're still coming up short, Kat holding the fort
Dedicate this to my fans, thanks for all your support
Yeah, this cold steel bitches, it's how we do it and it's real bitches
Yeah, it's Ronnie Kat

[V-Stylez]
Yeah, it's your man V-Stylez
Royce 5'9", Phat Kat and Elzhi
The Rapper Big Pooh from Little Brother
And MoSS on the beat bringing the heat
It's Hip Hop, non-stop[Hook: Dwele]
There's something I wanted to know, can we get closer
Yeah baby, seems like I've waited so long, can we get closer

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Girl you should come up for the week
I'll make you cum from the tub to the sink
Rubbing your feet in a luxury suite
Make sure you come with nothing on just a long shearling
And I'mma make ya toes curl up like they all earlin'
I'll whisper in your ear, tell ya something
Stick my tongue in your bellybutton
Reach down below, you know I'm well sprung
Hit ya from the back to get ya calves trembling
And pull your hair 'til its straight, you look half Indian
Laugh and giggling
With champagne bubbles tickle your nose
Before you I wouldn't throw my old nickels at hoes
I'm just glad we can get close, for breakfast in the morning
We can fly out to Paris, France for the French toast
You made me wait so long and that's a good thing
Now let me make your candy rain dampen your thong
I hit it off like a champion strong, for real
Your still bumpin' and grindin' even after the song but all along I, I

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T3]
Let me talk to ya, feel me for a sec
I love ya sassy ways I must confess
You're lookin' good girl, I hope you into sex
Sort of a model type with a splash of innocence
Your fashion (fash-shon), ass like your moms
I love that Tiffany charm thats hangin' from ya arm
And if we get it on I'mma take her back to the fort
Show her how I run game like an athlete in sport
Sweety I can see that money ain't a thing
Been doin' this for a while no need to explain it
You're doing swell girl, you're never doin poorly
You know I'm hoppin' in whips just look at the jewerly
Plus you need a man in your life
Yo someone who can hit it right, and plus got the right dough
Plus I'll treat you like a queen
Your place or mine I was thinking we should get close

[Hook]

[Dwele]
A lot of cats done tried it
I like to touch the na na, I
Know you act real shy but, know you get down
You're not that type we go
Just keep it low and let it go
No need to act up cause I, know you get down
Can we get closer tonight, I'll make it right
Touch you inside baby, I make you get down
Hold you very close, with or without clothes
Public or closed doors, we will get closer[Intro]
Settle down class, take your seats
Pull out the manual and turn to chapter three
We about to learn the lesson on color schemes
You ready? Here we go

[Hook]
Okay, kids, today we learn the color schemes
Like purple hearts, black clouds, yellow submarines
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the (Colors)

[Verse 1]
Damn, it's fucked up how they found Tune
He was robbed for his gold chain in front of a brown stone
But what's a fellow to do if he not earning one red cent
Or trying to make the green like mixing yellow with blue
Oh no, it's true another black on black cause it's lynch fly
That's what I heard, word get around like the pink eye
Watch out when your enemies sneak by
Wish I could pour white out on these lines before the ink dry

[Hook]
Okay, kids, since now we learning color schemes
From Red Cross, blue shields, yellow submarines
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the (Colors)

[Verse 2]
Now there's some that's dead from fighting over breadcrumbs
Feet and head numb, it's a murder, we call it red rum
Got them boys in blue with black jacks locking the new youth
They sell purples through Blackberries with the Blue tooth
Saw this gold digger red bone I knew poising in Black Tail
Another black girl lost inside the world of Black Male
And white collar crime done on the sneak tip
Different from blue collar workers catching the pink slip

[Bridge]
Yo, red, yellow, orange, green, brown, white, black
Pink, purple, grey, blue, now let us bring it right back
Blue, grey, purple, pink, black, white, brown
Green, orange, yellow, red, now let us break it back down to the (Colors)

[Verse 3]
I think it's quite foul while I sip the Grey Goose and orange juice
And twist a white widow in a White Owl
How first you painting the town red beneath the night skies
Now you going to trail telling little white lies
It gives a mother the blues to see drama
Printed in black and white on papers that cover the news
And read some dudes in a white tee was laying in old piss
A victim of a drive-by, they even killed his goldfish

[Hook]
Okay, kids, we done learning color schemes
Using words like white horse, yellow submarine
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to theUh
Elzhi
J Dilla rock on

(Elzhi)
Yo I heard you was lookin for me
Well its sort a like you lookin to be in the wrong place
With your arms waving getting took for ya things
That ice emblem ya Benjamin and ya Timberland
My raps finish 'em like strokes to black citizens
Attack ya women friend
Pull her hair til its straight like she half Indian
Collapse many men doing laps around meridian
Aim for ya chest like I'm a titty man
Wit a fetish for feelin him wit a iron fist that lift like helium
What y'all niggas want shock therapy
Ya pop barely and fold up
Ya never blow up no
You full of hot air to me
Another rapper claimin he hot
But couldn't be if he was Damien's pop
That was once an angel from God
Get my jock out ya mouth now that I'm hot
Can't believe nigga's a stoop so low til they limbo with the cock
Well I'm
Tryin to get over like a Alche to sober nights
Y'all niggas ain't spittin y'all just soakin mic
Getting hot headed
But my shoulders ice that's why I catch the cold eye
That's why you catchin holes guy inside ya four door ride
I left four more slide from out the barrel
Then my niggas speed a punch you in ya back to knock you out apparel

(J Dilla)
What you want, what you want, where you at, where you at
What you want, what you want, where you at, where you at

(Elzhi)
You lookin for me under a rock, a bush, or a tree
I jump on ya block and stomp you til my foot is asleep

(J Dilla)
What you want, what you want, where you at, where you at
What you want, what you want, where you at, where you at

(Elzhi)
You lookin for me run in ya spot bullet and heat
I bust off a Glock and snuff you til you put in the deep

(4x)
If you want it, come and get it

(Elzhi)
Get ya best nigga out ya brigade
Bet everything becomes vague
Clothes become beige
And hearing sweet serenades and grenades
I bomb like Saddam twice
Smoke fills the room like the intercom vice
I'm wicked enough to punch you in your inner mind's eye
Until you black out and wake up within the land of Mt. Zion
Whack niggas get screamed on
And highly retire
I got the eye of the tiger like Rocky's theme song
Step in the concrete jungle
I bust you til you see doubles
Then watch all four of me reach for you
The heat bubble ready to cock back
I'm aimin shots at any nigga
I even got midgets wit triggers hittin the side of top hats
Ready to kill ya
We fully armed like Dr. Octagon
Skinny limbs that flip cocky arm
Cough up lung if you wanna tango
Best run ya ankles
You ain't fly
Ya vocals sound dry like they under rain coats
And the same niggas that's still after me
They get chills when it get back to me
Then peel back they feet like an athelete
Then when they turn they back to me dramatically
Them and the ground collide til they pop up on the other side wit the Japanese
I mean business
To oppose would be suicide
Ya middle name would be mud like kalauah slide
All you hear is slugs
So you move and dodge
And try to run for cover
I'm on some other, other, other
Skip ya level I'm above that
So what you love rap and you want mine
I make ya very punchline sound like love taps
They don't hit right
Throw ya fist right
I fist fight with a mic
To submit like
To ya insight
Then I'm a leave ya area walked you
Arogant dogs
They claim you carryin sparks but couldn't bury a corpse

(J Dilla)
Ha huh say
What you want, what you want, where you at, where you at
What you want, what you want, where you at, where you at

(Elzhi)
You lookin for me under a rock, a bush or a tree
I jump on ya block and stomp you til my foot is asleep

(J Dilla)
What you want, what you want, where you at, where you at
What you want, what you want, where you at, where you at

(Elzhi)
You lookin for me run in ya spot bullet and heat
I bust off a Glock and snuff you til you put in the deep

Say uh

(*If you want it come and get it*)[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
From the hood where them niggas pack fullys
Turn an ounce of reg to a cutty
Count money with a 10 deep flannel on
SB's looking like they been painted on
Jeans fitting like they was made for me
Your pants looking like, they was hand-me-downs from your Daddy
Get at me, my fit worth a stacky
I'm in a Caddy getting head in the back seat
Rubbing on her yakki
Then it start raining, when I start cumming
So now I'm brainstorming, on how I'm gon' run it
And y'all like fags – pussy? You don't want it
Gosh darn it, got heat like furnace
And I raise it like thermostat
Rolling that Thundercat kush look like Panthro
Heard you grab your ankles, take it in your manhole
That's so disgusting, I think I just threw up in my mouth
Can somebody pass me a towel?
A wetnap or something? Nigga is you fronting?
I beat you in your face, now your head like a pumpkin
Jack-o-Lantern, I'm Danny Tanner
Watching that white girl, you a dry jheri curl
You worthless piece of shit
Your baby mama begged me to suck my dick
And I ain't gon' let her, she look like Predator
You a gay boy like David Archuleta
Contra, where niggas pierce armor
It's two niggas, two guns, blowing out your conscience
You see them chrome 44's, in this bitch with thirty men
Y'all niggas know the code like..

[Hook]
Up-Up, Down-Down
Left-Right, Left-Right
B-A, B-A, Select-Start

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
When I write y'all, I blackout like nightfall
I'm never shitted on like that flight stall, that's quite small
You wouldn't like me when I get gutter, it's the legit cutter
And you ain't sharp enough to split butter
I stack riches, throwing niggas in black ditches
You wack which is why you mixed up like when the track switches
Hand on my nuts like my sac itches
Looking like The Mack, hitting 'lac switches
Hiding guns in my Abercrombie
With a dime piece, getting more brain than a zombie
Times 3, Ladies Love Cool J
I need a bitch with more class than a school day
I heard a fool say I wasn't in his top 3
Stepped off with a broke arm and a popped knee
See me and Brown is no regular team
We make the whole planet flip like Omega Supreme
Yeah, make 'em hype, yo I murder with this tight flow
You a typo, plus you suck like lypo
I keep bodies hid, fuck a John Gotti bid
Talk money, then we can chop it up like the Karate Kid
But don't think I won't clap and merk 'em
Infrared, beam 'em up, I will Captain Kirk 'em
And turn 'em to a brainless dodo
And break 'em both, legs one and two, like when Kane was solo
I'm snatching up his chains and Polo, the flow's fitted
To pose with it in the strangest photo
I'm bumping blue genie, if your stacks is too teeny
First you see me, and then you don't like I'm Houdini, nigga[Dwele]

Theres many ways to touch ya
I been thinkin of you
Let me count the ways to fuck you
You're all I want girl

Theres many ways to touch ya
I been thinkin of you
Let me count the ways to fuck you
You're all I want girl (echo)

[T3]

It goes day one
I would take her on a short vacation
Some place to chill, probably some place warm
Don't pack nothin but bathin suits and shorts hon'
And thats for real girl
And then step two
When you land off the plane up in Malibu
Limo, chauffer service awaits you
Champagne open and the sunroof too
Black Leather interior trimmed in powder blue
We roll out then we shift to step three
Hotel accomodation is lovely
There's no way they hand us the wrong key
Top floor you know the penthouse suite
It's plushed out, theres six rooms for two weeks
Theres 3 beds, 2 baths, 1 jacuzzi
You got a wardrobe sittin in ya dresser draw
Thats when el steps in to setup step four

[Dwele]

Theres many ways to touch ya
I been thinkin of you
Let me count the ways to fuck you
You're all I want girl

Theres many ways to touch ya
I been thinkin of you

[Elzhi]

Yeah, theres lingerie and a blindfold with handcuffs
Chardinay for the wardro and cameras
So we can play back this moment in a DVD
And mama send this bad truck through the 3 tvs
The waters runnin for your bath now we at step five
Givin you head .. ? .. like bein baptised
Dryin you off and let you get inside your neglige
Pour some wine like the dro and let the record play
Dwele g track 10 thats my favourite edge
You blazin with me we laughin and on our way to six
Stick my tongue in ya ear and set the mood right
Hit the balcony and grind you in the moonlight
You horny off the gentle breeze before we're off of six
Dab some wine on ya nipples and lick it of your tits
Now we enterin seven and you just can't wait
Its like you enterin heavens gates when we make eight

[Dwele]

Theres many ways to touch you
I been thinkin of you
Let me count the ways to fuck you
You're all I want girl

Theres many ways to touch you
I been thinkin of you
Let me count the ways to fuck you

[T3]

Now we in eight
Reachin the climax ya feelin so relaxed
Take you to another place, lay you on ya back
Ya body's tremblin girl you feelin so right
Repeated actions turn the moonlight into daylight
We watch the sunrise onto step nine
Breakfast in bed with cherries and some chilled wine
With the windows cracked open feel a slight wind
I take my time as we ease into step ten

[Elzhi]

Believe when my only reasons for this hon'is pleasin
Stickin my keys in your ignition
Ya screamen eleven semen like big fun
We even we both skiin and just cum
Ya screamin and I semen and we get done
We leavin the next evenin events come
You ? and we head to sweden you can get some
We leavin at 12 to bring you back to just one

[Dwele]

You're all I want girl (fade out)[Consequence]
Yeah, you break artists, look, they crying broke
Career in the garbage, they decided to croak
I guess my assignment now is just to poke
At the sleeping giant until he's awoke
I can take the slingshot and make these heat rocks
Hit 'em between the eyes until this bad dream stops
To be at the top the price ain't cheap
I pay DJ's, they still send me drop sheets
I drop heat and you can blame it on my past
Why I only work for currency now like Damon Dash
Forget being mad I can tell they pissed off
That I became like Jermaine when
He would rhyme with Kriss Kross
Da Brat and Xscape and whoever else
He had signed but made wait
That's the old bait and switch
The bullshit you go through to get rich
And that's the reason why Tyson hit Mitch
Right in front of Dapper Dan before
He got the chance to stitch
Up a new outfit, there ain't an outfit
That I can't out spit, cause they don't rap about shit
So take these words home and think 'em through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

[Hook:]
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
So you can quit crying BROKE

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Today is the first of the rest of your life
Cause you refuse to write on paper, that don't make you nice
Windex on your chain. that don't make that ice
Lil' niggas wanting fame, this a sacrifice
Plenty rappers getting signed, spending time on the shelf
It's a flaw in the design, learn you rhyme for yaself
Dusty records ain't classics, most people plastic
But fans ain't plastic, they more like metal
Refuse to play the end of ya strings, no Geppettos
Men with ho tendencies, your Jordans are stilettos
Drum and bass flow, your soul is so cello
Sugar free jell-o, I will never settle for less than what I deserve
Youngins got nerve, think they story gonna be different
Be on the same train, different cars, nigga listen
The game is full of sheep, and wolves attack herds
Cause you already sleep

[Hook:]
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
So you can quit crying BROKE

[Elzhi]
You rather see me cryin broke, die and croak
We gettin high and smoke
Off the water with Hawaiian folk
You funny and ain't even try and joke
Because I got the right dollars
To move next to white collars who be buyin coke
But last year was different
I felt my knees buckle that's when I
Got on my knuckles like the apes inside the jungles
Up in Africa, imagine feelin like the reaper's after ya
Tax man taking half of the pie, only to suck you dry
Like he Dracula
It made my spine tense
It's all due to this record label nonsense
But I've been fine since, I got back up on my feet
Spittin heat with the Cons-Quence
And only because I plan on running and I'm far from stressed
You'd rather see me with my car possessed
And my mansion haunted
And I was terribly deprived
The moment they try to bury me alive
I barely survived, now I'm here

[Hook:]
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
Let me help you wipe your tears away
So you can quit crying BROKE[Black Milk]
Truth be told this is who you call the truest out the newest fold
Till people watchin our every move like it's the Truman Show
Coolest flow signal to my crew the cue to go with they finger on triggas
Gunpowder under cuticles
Newest flow shows as ugly as warzones, yeah
Shit is ugly as Lady Gaga's wardrobes
Word to Dilla his verses iller the words are killer
Ain't heard nothing this legendary out since the birth of Thriller
My human nature to expose teams seems these rapping niggas are girls
Pre-teen Billie Jean, seems they love when I'm performing, they laugh at your performance
My shit is Martin Luther, your shit is Martin Lawrence
Touring on a plane in somewhere in the world new
In the clouds listening to Stevie Wonder's 'Girl Blue'
So true dude is feeling confident and feeling taller
I'm feeling on top of the world without the fear of falling

[Royce Da 5'9]
I said niggas known to talk a lot, get chopped up
I say I'm sitting in a coffee shop, I dont mean I'm at no starbucks
Just me and Vishis roll around like we don't need no niggas
Just these triggers we old school like Dean Pritchard
You can't take the heat, get yo' ass out the kitchen
Matter of fact take yo' ass back in there and wash those dishes
I'm ready for war I know what you're thinking I already said it before
You better get ready for this deadly medley whenever we here to record
I can cut into you in my sleep like stepping to the weak
I can catch a bullet in my teeth
I'm known as who not to go at, don't ask just never tempt me
You can bet yo' ass - you'll have no ass you bet against me
Ugh I'm in the best shape of my life lyrically I don't even write seriously:
I just fuck around
Like a rolling stone I lay the hat in many homes
Bad boy like Diddy Combs
Shoulders' what his whole entire city on

[Elzhi]
Yo you need to be amputated I'll snap you in minutes
I left Detroit rappers in fitteds decapitated
It's not a dumb threat cuz though I'm not what I'll become yet
I'll challenge some vet and stick it to him like a drum set
Clap the matic I'll flip like an acrobatic slap fanatics
With murderous rap mechanics
I'm worth pay, pockets go green like it was earth day
That's why I blow cake like it's my birthday
The way I roll - envision a city blob
Half of yall shouldn't rap, y'all do a shitty job like colon cleansing
And I'm dying to test ya, no denying I'm applying the pressure
Like the iron I rely on that lie in the dresser
Several try and get they Kangol crushed
Cuz my skills ill like slicing up devil's pie off of angel dust
You left behind me looking shadowy it's fatality
To ever try to handle me like a piano key[Verse 1]
I’m the bell ringer, shell slinger
Hidin' bodies 'til the smell lingers
Until they pale as Renée Zellweger, when El sting ya
You feelin' like the braille finger, searchin' for the line
I’m first you stuck in last, rappers now suckin' ass
Full of new school niggas I wouldn’t fuckin' pass
They should flunk your class and dip low
They tiptoe and eves drop with both sleeves popped
Now please stop, you'll melt faster than a freeze pop
In a hundred degrees El’s sunning MC’s he pops
You better put that work in
I murk grins and kill grills, my steel peels
Then I peel wheels then skill feels like it heals ills
Like Benadryl pills, the hottest artist will feels chills
When I drop gems that play out like fans when you peep
These rhymes ain’t cheap, oh yeah I gets deep

[Refrain]
I'm a thoroughbred
Never sleep I find a way to eat
To all my Detroit niggas that be tryna eat
It's your boy Elzhi, my science is deep

[Verse 2]
Yeah I gets deeper than that
Once I blow your mind your not keeping your hat
I bomb the scene, killin' off your rhyme regime
You taken back like a time machine, my dime is clean
My flow is hydro, cannabis, Sativa
Also known as Chronic weed and again this reefer
Watch it blow, my nuts hang a couple of crotches low
And fuck fifteen minutes nigga my watch is slow
You need to cease to bragging
You see the fire that I spit when I unleash the dragon
The ruler is back, we battle your medulla is cracked
We do it online you find that yo computer is hacked
It’s your decision what my brain stores division
I’m seein' bars come together like doors in prison
When I spit that line, you can keep in your mind
When they creep, I do this in my sleep, oh yeah I gets deep

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Listen, I blow trees with the Buddha man squeeze with the war lord
Your floored hot stay on point like a scoreboard
I come hard the way a chick pull a clit
I know you assholes pissin' all you dicks full of shit
Gets your dogs muzzled, I’m drunk off the power I guzzle
Break men into pieces leave 'em puzzled
Clips I pack 'em in like sardines, flippin' on niggas
Like Megatron in they hands on Starscream
And this year y'all are gona have to give it the fuck up
If not I'm takin' it, however you make of it
I stack cake a bit, I should wear a bakers mitt
And put cheese down on the whip like it was quaker grits
Oh little mommy how she shakes her tits
Work the pole and make it twerk and roll
I know it urk you whole that I could jerk your soul
In your sleep, you meet the Grim Reap, oh yeah I gets deep
