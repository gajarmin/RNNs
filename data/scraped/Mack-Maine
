[Outro: Detail]
I’m in love with your Egyptian skin
And your talk about religion

Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
But you can call me Tunechi

My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise, I should be hooked on Phonics
But anyway, I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it, back-back it up and dump it)

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]

[Verse 2: Drake]
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they wanna talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all
Young Money man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest
And what are all your names, again? we drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am? let's be honest
She wants me, she wants me
Cause I got it all, shorty, tell me what you don't see?
I will fuck with all y'all, all of ya'll are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say, "Pussy, pussy, pussy"
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all
Damn, and every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jae Millz]
I ain't being disrespectful, baby I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, some married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss, you can get the business, ha

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas

Mack the thinker, I'm the Blood - Method Man, Redman
A scared man a dead man, can I get a amen?
You done bought all of them guns and ain't nobody dead yet
Catch your pussy ass in traffic, aim at the headrest
Got your bitch on her knees lookin' like she legless

Lord I need some wood to knock on
Lil Tunechi, I'm a movie, get your gummy bears and popcorn

And this little red dot gon' help me hit a nigga spot on
Point guard with the bullets; you say Rajon, I say Rajon
Yeah, hold up; we them boys, we them wild boys
I hold a pistol sideways when I shoot, that's for style points
Menace to society, menace to myself though
Bend but don't break, my niggas call me elbow
And you don't want no problem, I'm a problem
My AK just keep shootin', it's on autopilot
Tunechi what's your fuckin' problem? I got fuckin' problems
Bad bitch on top of me, she started from the bottom
On that Cognac and that loud pack, that loud pack
You gotta shoot the rat when it get too big for the mousetrap
Shoot at me and I'mma smile back, and then I "Pow" back
Flip you over like a kayak, bitch it's combat
Bitch I'm Tommy gun Tunechi, favorite color ruby
Made enough to quit but I keep makin' up excuses
Triple A dick, that's Amazin' And Amusin'
I'm sedated and secluded
I'm the greatest and improvin'
But my baby momma say I'm livin wrong
Well if I die then I guess she dead right
Catch me walkin' on this mothafuckin' water, nigga
I catch your pussy ass at a red light
And you gon' hear that blocka, that blocka

Brief moment of silence for Chris Wallace
Soulja Slim, Pac, Pimp C, I hope they smilin
And Weezy still hot as tamales
My private plane got that wi-fi and that wireless
I'm so sorry for the wait

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Spread your legs, girl, I'm tryna break the headboard
I'm a fiend for the bread, I want the whole Dej Loaf
My Chinese chick just want a blunt and some yaka mein
She a squirter so we don't fuck on my Versace sheets
My whole crew'll skate on you like a hockey team
It's like Wayne Gretzky meets Jeremy Shockey
We Young Money Mafia, I rep what I rep
Try to throw salt on my name and I'll put pep in your step
Put your gloves on, nigga please get you a grip
And I bet you rest in peace when I let this bitch rip
The money runnin' like water, check the cash flow
My weed funky like armpits and assholes
Potato on the nine, when we creep we mash slow
And make sure them kids get everything they ask for
My bitch in London said she's a Mack Mainiac
And her sister love Tune, she a Wayniac
It's like she's two different persons; she be chillin', she be cursin'
Cry a river, squirt a ocean
Fuck fast, in slow motion
Man I know Soulja proud of me (ya heard me?)
Man, I know Soulja Slim proud of me (ya heard me?)

Life to me is currency, prosperity I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like its livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet, lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga play your part or parallel park your ego next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a mac in the back of a 'Lac
With a latch on the back of the trunk
Hit a punk in the back with a pump in the back, till he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future
When you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block
With a cop wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block G watch for the block or whatever
And cut no cut more guns more guts fuck boy you fucked up twice you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish back flip head first smilin'
C-cry in the face of Jesus we just pray we keep on stylin'
On you bitches TDE YMCMB business bitch

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Okay nigga riding in a May-be, and I'm probably with Baby

Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up she deep in a coma

Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber
Young nigga, got a lot of flows
Any nigga don't believe me, I make it look easy easy out of control

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger
Uptown gangsta, get it how we get it
Third Ward soldier, suicide rider
Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter
Hand-Persian rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fish scales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
I’m from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That’s why when the babies grow up damn they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I’m so happy my lil’ brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and [Fail Boy?]
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain’t no pain I can’t withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I’m in a whole ‘nother tax bracket
Amen[Verse 1 - Mack Maine]
Young Maine for President
I'll probably paint the White House black if it was my residence
Bush back in office, some niggas feel that's irrelevant
Cause they still pedalin' this medicine, but anyway, anyday
I can zurk off quick and make my semi spray
Send some of my men away just to blow your men away
Stephon Marbury type bullets, they like the penetrate
Young Money, we outta school, but we got chemistry
Young Spitta, Young Maine, Young Cop, Young Mobb, Tez Poe
We don't pass the rock nigga, we ball hog
Mad slow in the Escalade nigga, y'all all fall
Jack your fresh ass Caddy and steal your white walls
Nigga, we don't like y'all
Hell yeah, we will fight y'all

And the cocaine is right up in her anus
Old Wayne is right up in the spot where he supposed to
Be, got Hova at the game and now he coachin'
Me, but I've been the champion, happy as I ever been
Lampin' in the Hamptons like, what the fuck is a hammock
The chef up in the kitchen like, what the fuck is a sammich
I'm like, we gotta find middle ground, we need balance
Challenge me, that be to my advantage
I'm outstanding, like standing outside up in the twister and walking not damaged
Standing outside up in the blizzard and walking hot handed
Serving nicklebags in Iraq, bet I will not panic
Swerve the nickel black, if I wreck, bet I will not panic
Cop another one the next day and drive it crazier
The seats will be lazier, shit'll be gravier
Nina Sarafeena my girl, so then I baby her
Wavin' at her at 2 crazy, Fugazis, I'm too brazen, 3 brazees deep
We got .380s and P80

Shell cases, money put up for jail cases, bail make it
My momma say, tuck your chain son, they'll take it
I hit her with one of them stale faces, like
I'll be damned momma, they know who I am momma
I'm still your little boy, but to them, I'm the man momma
Fuck with your boy, man Hollygrove the hood, nigga
Throw it in your face 'til you get that understood

[Verse 3 - Curren$y]
Niggas know I'm heavy with the coke, with the coke
In the Impala SS and sittin' heavy on the spokes
Never am I broke man, I'm playin with some change
I get a nigga soaked like he playing in the rain
And everywhere I go, a ho starin' at my chain
I'm the most valuable player in the game
All these haters wanna ride me
Cause I got more kicks than niggas with black belts in karate
Keep a redbone with a real nice body
Just copped a 'Lac and a yellow Maserati
Niggas ain't fuckin with the dawg
When Young Money shoppin', we don't leave nothing in the mall
These niggas ain't as rich as us
Man your rims too small, get your motherfucking inches up
Cause I copped me a Benz today
Just to go on 106 & Park and hand the keys over to Free and AJ

Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back

[Mack Maine:]

From ring tones she sing my songs at the karaoke
She call me baby all day like I'm Bryan Williams

And I'm evictin' all you cats that only spit an ounce
And like a stripper ass you better bounce diggity, bounce, bounce

Cheerleaders, we ain't worried 'bout nothin', nothin'
Nigga act dumb, push the button, fuck 'em
Get 'em out of here like the 6th foul in the NBA
Little nigga no discussion
Boy I'll close ya case, like judge Millz Lane
All y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Big guns that go over the shoulder dog
My team strapped, no overalls
So please don't make me do it, got soldiers and shooters
These bullets will swallow like shots of Kahlua
When we light up the weed then we fly like a rumor
Then hop on the plane and fly over you losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer
I'm not from this era that beef on computers
Look boy if it's war, then all we comin' after you
Special I'm smashin ya, somethin' like Gallagher
Shots in your challenger, shots in your passenger
Hittin' your girl then I'm passing her
Jae Millz ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Young Money ain't worried 'bout nothin'
D5!

[Outro: Jae Millz]
We ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Young Money)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Jae Millz)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (not a thing)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (D5)I use to tote a .38; I tote that AK-47
In my crack days; in my rap days

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I use to tote a .38 up in my crack days [x2]
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days [x2]
I use to tote a .38
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I use to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I tote that Ak-47

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm too fly, can't stay up in my bat cave
Hello, say goodbye when the gat wave
Hold on to your surf board when the gat wave
Homie, you can be deleted like backspace
I'm comin' through like a fax page
I'm just a gorilla in a unlatched cage, I peel off like black tape
Weed & Syrup, good combination like a cracked safe
Uhmm, real nigga in the buildin', where the Cris at?
I got them twins with me, you know, click-clack
I got them M's with me, you know, big stacks
I stay on the right side when that bridge crack
Cash Money, everything understood, everybody hop on a Lil Wayne that could
Haha, Hollygrove, that's my hood, Eagle Street is where I stood, boy!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
See When I Saw My First Murder When I Was Only 7
4 Years After That, I Did My First 2-11
A 2-11 That Turned To A 1-87
The Block Wad Dialing 9-11 For The 4-11
We Left The 7-11, Lookin' Like 9-11
They Skipped The Doctor And Ambulance And They Called The Reverend
See That Was Then Homie, And This Is Now Breadren
I'm This Close From Copin' The Porshe 9-11
The 9-11, That's The Reason For My AR
The M-14 Is For My Nigga JR
See I Don't Feel Too Many Rappers Cause' They Are
Softer Than Girls In Catholic School
Yaw Boyz Rap Like Ya'll Went To Actin' School
I Thank, My Beef, The Guns Show Em' Gratitude
Young Money, whether we're traveling or not, we pack a tool
Why N.W.A., them Niggas With Attitudes

Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Check me out, look

Old school Chevy, faster than a silver bullet
Strawberry paint, seats vanilla puddin'

Top chopped sent the car to the barbershop
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot
I'm so unothodox
I got your bitch ridin' my dick wit no shocks
(Bounce bitch, bounce, bounce)
I'm the hottest shit jumpin' out the coffee pot
Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup and I can make a soda pop
Keep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop
Real niggas wit me ridin' till the motor stop
I got these hoes straight livin' out the soap op

Okay?

[Hook]
Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs
And since I'm paid, niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back

Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs
And since I'm paid, bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back

[Mack Maine:]
I'm Mack Maine, hey
Hey, to a man with a ho with some pop trunk
I fuck over you like I'm sexin' on the top bunk
I make alot of noise, boy, like a cop car
The whip got the dicks out like a pop bra
And you ain't gotta ask your girl... you knew she knew me
From ring tones she sing my songs at the karaoke
She call me baby all day like I'm Bryan Williams
The new hip-hop landlord I'm 'bout to buy the buildin'
And I'm evictin' all you cats that only spit an ounce
And like a stripper ass you better bounce diggity, bounce, bounce

[Hook]

[Birdman:]
Yeah Shawty The Last MOB Flyin' The Bugatti With The Tool On The Seat
Put the K in the car while we ridin' blaze
Put the chopper on the pussy in the driveway
Bet the house on the young 'un when we got paid
Triple colors on the bikes in the new mercaids
Bustin' keys on they ass while we got paid
From I-10's ridin' hot to an open bay
Uptown made man out the hard way
Crab in the bucket 50 shots bitch make a way
I Thought They Knew Shawty
Like Father Like Son
Ball till you fall stuntin' wit them paper plates
Throwin' hundreds on them hoes while we eatin' steaks
We in the club poppin' bottles like everyday
We grind for the shine nigga gettin' big money
Got a fleet tossin' chicken nigga get cake
I'm on his island with this power like Scarface

Ice man birdman rockin' red monkeys

Already Nigga Nieghborhood Super Star
And We Gon' Ball 'Til We Fall

[Hook][Intro: DJ Khaled]
Believe dat.. it's DJ Khaled
It's that We The Best, YMCMB
"We The Best Forever"

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
A million lights and a kick drum - the floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling bout this one - and we still young you know-oww-oww
I'm breathing fire in your club-ubb
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold

[Tyga]
Uhh, new Hermes duffle bags
On the plane, see the sky through a little glass
Twenty hour flight never jet-lagged
Sipping white wine, watching the sunset
Real love this close I ain't never had
Sitting with you all day til the night pass
Damn, I ain't trying to fight that
But if we fall too fast will the feeling last
{*singing*} Now I'm looking over my shoulder, shoulder, uh
Champagne, good dimes and good times and now it's all over
{*rapping*} But you can't blame me for all that
You was bright now your heart all black
Try to outshine the good with the bad
You a cold motherfucker I ain't mad at you
Still shining

[Hook]

[Mack Maine]
Bitch I'm Mack Mai-I-I-I-I-I-I-ine...
You getting old and your heart turn cold
Time-line froze; mad at the world
Cause you lived your life but this the life that we chose
Lights on the road for the nicest Rolls
I mean long-ass flights for these trifling hoes
But we don't crap out when the dice is rolled
I mean no life, low life
Say my name and hopes to get more life, nigga live your life
Lame-ass nigga, you cook it with no spice
Lil B sacrifice, show me what your ho like
Hit her with that dope dick, now she's a dope fiend
Leo Lion the king, I'm looking for a dope queen
A First Lady baby, Young Money's Barack
Baggy cargos, high mismatched socks
Me, Gunz, Millz, Tyga, we give em the chills
Weak riders, get birth control pills

[Jae Millz]
(Millzy...) Uhh, bright lights
Lord knows I live for these nights
You're damn right
I'mma sip champagne till it blurs my sight
Yanks fitted cap to the front like Jeter
My diamonds ain't fierce like an episode of cheetahs Jesus
Loud jewelry, loud speakers
Blowing loud weed with some loud divas, Millz

[Hook]

[Cory Gunz]
(Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, Khaled)
Uh, it's that summertime money time
Gonna rhyme good time, wanna dime, gimme mine
Loud smoke, quiet engine out the city line
Pretty toes hanging out the window to the finish line
Spikes poking out my kicks like a porcupine
Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best fall in line
Uptown thorough breded from the South Bronx
Hot blocks in Miami, Khaled outcome
You made us, they hate us, just to say the latest
Life nothing like a movie: I just day-to-day this
Remember it was hard trying to pay us wages
Nice spitting hard rhymes on the main stages
Independent, yeah I told em major later
We some independent niggas getting major paper
Shout Tune, Stunna, Slim, Mack
We play for keep, so how we gon' give up that
YMCMB, lights, camera, ACTION~!

[Hook][Hook: Detail]
Talk to me baby, tell me who I am
Tell my nigga I said what's up, when you get a chance
Tell my bitch I said what's up, when you get a chance
She said when can you do it, we can do it when you can
Girl I'm all about the angels
Come down from heaven, you angel
Pop that pussy every angle
I swear I love my angel, my angel

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
You might not believe me, think that I'm trippin', but nigga I saw angel
I did, I did, that chick was thick, I mean she was off the chain
I wasn't stalkin' but couldn't stop lookin', like she called my name
Maybe if I get her attention she might notice I'm fly like I'm off the plane
I'm making my move, you know what I mean
It ought be sacrilegious, to look like them religious jeans
Blame her mother, but don't tell her dad
His chid gotta heavenly body, but one hell of an ass

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some Millzy in it
Ain't no hands inside her body, but I bet she feel me in it
That bedroom in danger when we desoliving anger
I work her ass out so good she got rid of her trainer
Talk to me, bad bitches they honk to me
GTV-shot non-stop now watch that pussy walk to me
Fuck 'em all girl, we gon' make them sweat
Our top down and it ain't even at weather yet, so

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Okay now do me like a favour, or do me like a chore
Or do me in your favourite red bottoms, oh Lord
I say my guardian angel, I swear her features a blessin'
She gon' learn today, I taught that pussy a lesson
I beat that up like I just made hell, kiss that pussy whenever do tell
Give her that package, you got mail
When it kind of your love I'll take that (?)
I'm lookin' for you girl, and do shit a molly world
I want a rotten fish, old Tuna spoil you girl

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
She makes that ass clap, like a naughty girl
Introduce you to some better things I can show you girl
Lights on, but take that Prada off, I beat it like a xylophone
No phones, but I can be the one that you're calling on
Talk to me baby, walk with me baby
Then we can take a long ride in this charcoal Mercedes
I'm the boss you my lady
You keep it wet, I go underwater swimming
I be a shark for you baby

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
Man I got pussy from my angel, head from my angel
I spent a night in heaven, me and Elvis split a Mango
She had that aquafina mermaid wet wet
I heard the love gods hollerin' out, "Man, we got next"
Her physique is unique like the clothes from boutique
Hit that ass 'til she peak and can't speak
She got wings on that pussy, she's so fucking fly
And everybody say she's dope, but this another high

[Verse 6: Birdman]
Talk to me baby my lady and my friend too
Notice flower bomb the scent when she breeze through
Bitches hatin' cause we sitting on top
When you walk the block the traffic stop
The 2-seater that I copped, that's for me and you
Drop the top back, your hair breezing through
I lay my stunt down proper, top shotter original (?)

[Hook][Bridge - Lil Wayne]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement
And a breeze turn to blazes

[Verse 1 - Gudda Gudda]
I’mma tell these niggas: “motherfuck the world”
On the real, nigga feel this
Punch a hole in the system like I got a steel fist
I don’t trust a soul nigga, so I ride alone
And I’ve been paranoid ever since I got a phone
Yeah, better roll or get rolled over
You too cool nigga? You could get the cold shoulder
I’m from the city where the skinny niggas die
Ride, I survived and I made it out alive
And they wonder why my face look blank
Cause I don’t give a fuck about what they say or think
Uh, nigga you see me with that face wall paint
Come on, pick your poison in the spray of a shake
Militant minded, the way Gudda think
You could meet the devil, better pray for the saints
Militant minded, the way Gudda think
Nigga you could meet the devil…

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
So where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
I blow the flame out, the world is dark now
And everybody need their spark now
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement
And a breeze turn to blazes

[Verse 2 - Gudda Gudda]
Starin’ at the world through my rear view
Gotta stay high just so I can keep a clear view
Tryna do right, but I’m swervin’ in the left lane
Tryna stay out of that black hole, watch my step man
They say money is the root of all evil
And we love it, so I guess me and you are all equal
Shit ain’t been the same since Hurricane Katrina
Ike and Rita, what happened with the FEMA?
Government officials not keeping it official
Like a ref with no whistle, so I’m tackling the issues
And they wonder why we act the way we act
Murder, murder, steal, steal, and sell crack to get stacks, but…

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
And I’mma just sit back laughing
And when I tried to kick that habit
Man I was like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
This whole world is aware of my actions
But they ain’t that bad compared to taxes
Ashes, all I see is ashes
As the world burns

[Verse 4 - Mack Maine]
I’m a young arsonist on my late night Johnny Carson shit
I ain’t never gave a fuck about the world
Cause they don’t give a fuck about me, or my girl
Or my mama, in the midst of the drama, ya digg?
They try to pull you all the way back to get ahead of you
Then Internal Revenue gon’ come for your revenue
Sayin’ that you owe 33% of what you make
When the world die, I’mma be rejoicing at the wake

[Bridge - Shanell]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
So where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
I blow the flame out, the world is dark now
And everybody need their spark now
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]

Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore, anymore

[Verse 1:]
Shit! It seems like yesterday I was only five
And my mom used to put out my clothes to get shavvin
These days I gotta get dressed myself
But let me go back in time, like Michael J myself
Well, my moms was a fox, she's still a fox
But my sister grew up, she took her spot as the fox
But it still was all good
My dad used to work all the time, he was rarely home
Sing this song
You see, uh I used just to watch cartoons
Back then my homies didn't have war wounds
You fast forward a little, older when I got
A lot of my homies see that they all got shot
But I remember the days, I remember the times
When we used to listen Eric B and Rakim for rhymes
And we used to shoot ball at the park everyday
But now things changed, I'm on my way, see
I'm on my way, see

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, you see, I used to like snack time
And pre-kid I used to like when it was nap time
I used to get my mat out
Chyeah I remember when we used to have to do math like one plus one equals two?
I remember when I learned my A, B, Cs
And my one, two, threes, it was just so eased
And my dad sat me down
And he taught me about the birds and the bees
Then I used to bring home bees
And then I started bringing home seeds
Even brought home dees and I saw the way
That my mom used to cry when I brought home the dees
So I got up on my GOB
And I used to shine like the sun
And I used to sip on Capris
I used to like the gummy bears
And I used to like the fruit gushes
And I used to get snowballs with rome
But fast forward I used to watch The Flintstones
But it's funny how time go and my homie long gone, but uh

[Verse 3:]
Remember your first kiss
And your first girl that you really made love with?
That was the shit
Remember how you used to need her fit for the dance?
You was running around trying to get something for the homecoming
Then you went to your prom
See that was just your time, that was your time to shine
Now everybody trying to work on their 10 years anniversaries
And half of your homies stay up in the hearse you see
Remember the "rest in peace" T-shirts and the second line
Hardy hard a lot of smiles when we was at that Marti Grass
Chicks was trying to get the bees
I remember back in the day
When you ain't had to worry about trying to worry about feeding yourself
Now you feed your seed and you're getting what you need
You can't get what you want
You used to have an allowance, you used to watch TV
Hot day during the summer man back in the days
Plan back in the days, you know
I remember back in the days, let's go

[Hook:]
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Grown up huh? You know
I wish I could hop in the same time
Machine, that Michael J Fox got in it
And go back in the days
I ain't really had to worry bout nothing
Peanut butter & jelly sandwiches
You know, lil debby cakes
Put your lil uniform on girl let's do it, that's it
I'm a 80's baby
It wasn't really that hard to please moms and pops
I love the 90's too
Remember they had too much to worry bout
That's what it used to be like
Girls was uh
Sometime I still wish I was like girls is uh
But love licks, and a nigga really got turned up you know
Mack Maine's a ay
Back in the days, back in back in back in the days
When I was young, I'm not a kid say
Back in the days, see I remember way back in the days
When all my homies they was kids
I wish that we could really be kids again
I wish that we could really be friends again
I miss my homies, I just wish that, I just wish that...[Intro]

We stay hot on that 504 shit (New Orleans!)
Selling iron all the time, and you know this

[Intro: Lil Wayne][x3]
Look
Back out the garage in the hog
And you know I redo the insides like the morgue

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
The coupe blue like the ‘do on Marge
Riding with a bitch prettier than a Debarge
Mommy want a soldier, baby I’m a sarge’
You can’t have me but we can have a menage (that’s 3)
Now rub me wrong and fuck up my massage
And it’s flowers for the dead, better get em a corsage
Ey-ya, head nigga in large, and everything I do I San Diego Charge
While you niggas just starve
I’m eating so much I'mma fuck around and barf
And red is the color of my scarf
And understand, to a giant you’re a dwarf
My flow’s throwed off
I’m so sick all I got to do is cough

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2: Raw Dizzy]
Bitch I come from the bottom of the mast
New Orleans, Louisiana, we love to pack gats
We love to count stacks, we love to pump back
I love killing the track, me, Wayne, Ronny, and Mac
That’s some Hollygrove shit, and I'mma bang it in your ear
Until you get it clear
You heard that? That’s my word and I meant that
Don’t tempt me, I leave ya bent up in your Bentley
Believe me

[Verse 3: Ronny]
Yeah it’s Ronny, back in the game

We got freaks in this bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
I got a thing for them big trucks
Big fine bitches with good jugs and big butts
5 4 mommies with nice hair and fake tits
That don’t get loose off of goose and probably act up
5 7 bitches with bowlegs that [?] big
All they really need is like two pills and 6 blunts
Wake up in the morning and count money and make grits
She don’t really know no English so we don’t say shit
Wayne said let it rain on them
Mother nature with the paper, doing a Mack Maine on em
Like there go 1000 like swoosh
Like there go 2000 (balling)
Now shake that ass like you can’t
Pay your cable bill and you tryna watch the Saints
So the 60 inch Hitachi, living like Liberace
Sporting the latest Versace, shotty and Maserati
Dodging the paparazzi, A C cold like the hunter Nazis
This here a classic like old school Hirachi
Then get your grill cooked like it was Hibachi
Word to cousin RodneyLil Wayne:
Yeah (take me out, take me out)
Ok now it was me and Mrs. C
We was chillin by ourself
Both of us just popped a pill
And now am feelin' myself

I ain't worried bout you cause I'm feelin' myself
I ain't worried bout you cause I'm feelin' myself

And they feelin' my shoe and they feelin' my belt
And they feelin' my jean thats the one they never seen
And my watch look like a television screen
And my right wrist nice and my left wrist mean
And now my neck gettin' all jealous and things
So I had to cop a couple of more necklaces man
Like ain't that a bitch?
Ain't a bitch I ain't my words
Heavy so I hope them bitches stick like paint

And all I really care about is my bank ho
And all I really care about is my bank ho
And all I really care about is my bank ho
Ya digg? now, what you drank?

I tell her bartender just straight patron
Man I'm takin one of these girls home
And we can do what we do we grown
We can do what we do we grown
I met her on first base standin' all alone
We went to second base and now she in my zone
Then we told Mr. Third Base we gon'
I told you im taking one of these girls home (safe)

Mack Maine:

I take a chick out the park like Barry
She held my balls so long the ref call her carry
She come to the crib and she think we married
She try to sneak in my bed like the tooth fairy (ha)
I call her genius oral she give me head sex
And all my bitches like packages they get FedEx
You can call 'em priority of 'da next day
They call the next day like "Maine I'm still rollin'"
I'm like well im heading to the game you still rollin'?
Like let me know your destiny child like Kelly Rowland
You think she lift weights with her brain the way she headstrong
You see my house is third base I call my bed home
You call her Miss Decapitated yeah her head gon'
She think she living right but I tell her she dead wrong
And I don't care if she all fat or she all slender
And I ain't T-Pain but this what I told the bartender

CHORUS
I tell her bartender just straight patron
Man I'm takin one of these girls home
And we can do what we do we grown
We can do what we do we grown
I met her on first base standin' all alone
We went to second base and now she in my zone
Then we told Mr. Third Base we gon'
I told you im taking one of these girls home (safe)

Lil Wayne:

Now run around a base
You know I come from outter space
And I'm runnin out of space
Cause I got to much paper
I ain't got enough space
You call that girl 7
Cause she finna get 8
If you call her at 7
Then probably gettin' ate
Tomorrow call her at 7
And she still gettin' ate
Ya now she do me
And girl what the bitch say?
"daddy please could you come
And put some tears in my face" (haha)
She wanna Lil Wayne on her face
I said well bitch go get lil' wayne on youre face (haha)
Then I came in her face

Bitch I know you love me
If not you just stupid

And why dont you just do it?
But fuck them niggas girl me and you should do it
And you know im gon' of that fluid you ain't see me tell

The bartender just straight patron
Man I'm takin one of these girls home
And we can do what we do we grown
We can do what we do we grown
I met her on first base standin' all alone
We went to second base and now she in my zone
Then we told Mr. Third Base we gon'
I told you im taking one of these girls home (safe)
I swear I told the bartender just straight patron
Man I'm takin one of these girls home
First base
Second base
Third base
We Home
We can do what we do we grown[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Talk about it, make em talk about it
Life to me is currency, prosperity I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like its livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet, lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga play your part or parallel park your ego next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a mac in the back of a 'Lac
With a latch on the back of the trunk
Hit a punk in the back with a pump in the back, till he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future
When you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block
With a cop wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block G watch for the block or whatever
And cut no cut more guns more guts fuck boy you fucked up twice you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish back flip head first smilin'
C-cry in the face of Jesus we just pray we keep on stylin'
On you bitches TDE YMCMB business bitch

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Okay nigga riding in a May-be, and I'm probably with Baby
Dont talk nigga fuck you pay me, intercept your bitch like Bailey
Okay big money on this side, 100 grand for the whip my bitch drive
Need a new safe money getting too high, dead presidents all in my Levis
Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish
Might cop me an Aston, Martin on 'em
Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up she deep in a coma
I'm super paid, 2 shows a day
My rollie gold, no time to waste
What it do Berg, my fuckin' brother
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma
Hot as the summer, cold as the winter
Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber
Young nigga, got a lot of flows
Any nigga don't believe me, I make it look easy easy out of control

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger
Uptown gangsta, get it how we get it
Third Ward soldier, suicide rider
Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter
Hand-Persian rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fish scales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail
Fr-fresher than I been before
Higher than we even been, shining on them 24’s
Junior doing time ho
On the grind ho, while he doing time ho

[Interlude: Mack Maine]
Ya know!
The time is money and money still was made baby
Eight months ain’t stop nothing nigga
It’s like jail was third base and my lil’ nigga still came home, ya understand

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
I’m from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That’s why when the babies grow up damn they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I’m so happy my lil’ brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and [Fail Boy?]
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain’t no pain I can’t withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I’m in a whole ‘nother tax bracket
Amen{DJ Folk~!}

[Hook]
Pop a bottle and celebrate
We made it to a new day
Pop a bottle and celebrate
We done made it to a new day
Oh I take a hit and just elevate
Cause today will be a good day
I got my mind right, money right, ready for war
Workin' hard today for a better tomorrow

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Hey! - blow the horns on 'em
The sun is out, it's a brand new day and it just dawned on 'em
The smoke in here got 'em floating just like in salt water
And break is fast, we gotta cook it just like a short order
Dont feed dem hens when the birds covered in cheetah print
A jungle out there and the jail is the zoo that keep us in
Players in gators is crazy, we feel the need to rock 'em
Furs coming in all different colors like PETA got 'em
Killing yourself for a salary
Look ya line flatter than stomachs of the women that's running, watching them calories
Hope that we linking, we smoking and drinking casually
Cause life without living ain't nothing but a fallacy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Say, who's that peekin' in my window?
Is that sunshine? Is that one time?
Let that sun shine through my living room
Hospitality is what I'm giving you
Harsh reality is what I've been through
But I'm not alone, ask her and him too
And they shall tell ya, ain't nothin' better
Than the smell of a new day
I know the ocean runs dry and the sky gets dark
And ya don't see what He's trying to show ya
And I know the wall may seem tall
But if we help each other I guarantee we get over
And once I'm over, I'll reach back for my brother
And pull him over as well
Keep our heads high and our noses wide open
Hopin' for that new day smell
Love live life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
Yea homie, I been waiting since I was 16
To tell 'em what I'm 'bout to tell 'em
So I need more than a 16
See I'm the only son of Mary and Joe
So I gotta fulfill my purpose 'fore I'm buried, ya know
My momma say she having visions of me being a missionary
And the hood looking at me as a walking visionary
So I sit back and wonder will I ever have my time to shine
And die like Pac in his prime
Or will I go out like Len Bias and OD before the tryouts
No tell the reaper no buyout
I'm good, I pray for a head to protect ya
And I gotta walk the streets with the heat as my protection
Still gotta watch my back, still watch my front home
Cause I seen a lot of niggas die with they gun on
So with that in mind, I just get higher
And pray to the higher Messiah, I'm no liar
And they say that puffing the fire fucks with your memory
But I got a lot of stuff that I don't wan' remember see
Like when my homie ivin died
I like how I never seen a man cry 'til I seen Lance died
Never seen my pops cry 'til I seen my Grams died
And I'm here to tell him that I miss my Grams too
And I wish I could hug her for mothers day too
And I feel the same way that you do
But we gotta still move on so she can just smile down on us
And I don't want the Lord to ever frown down on us
I know that they really got power in a gun
But I also know that they got power in a tongue
So every time I speak, look I try to speak life
Y'all tweaking for broads, I tweak life
They said I was s'posed to die as a fetus
My momma said I bind that Devil in the name of Jesus
So now I'm here just to talk to y'all
Come and stroll with me homie, let me walk wit' y'all
Ten million ways to die so I chose
To get my life right by the end of the road
'Fore my body in a casket and I'm stiff and froze
'Fore I'm laying in a morgue with a tag on my toes
I'm here to tell you take heed to the warnings
School shootings, hurricanes, and global warming
Open ya Bibles up with no hesitation
BC was the Genesis, this is Revelations
So you better pick your destination
Tomorrow ain't promised, better pick your destination
Rest in peace B Spencer, rest in peace Pimp C
Shit could be worse so I'm feeling like Weezy
I wake up in the morning, take a piss, and wash my hands
Take a knee and thank the Man and leave my life in God's hands, yea!

[Hook]Chorus: Lil Wayne
Dark ass shades, I can’t see them haters
Now eat these fuckin bullets, don’t forget to tip the waiter
I don’t drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
Bitch I’m on that Patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go “pu”
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go “pu”
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go “pu”
Got-Got a mean ass swagga, my bitches do too

[Verse 1: Mack Maine]
Uh, Mack in this bitch, tell ‘em hoes I'm about it
These niggas sweet, a bunch of fucking brownies
The fuck you’re talking about, I’m a G like a thousand
I’m on my one two, and bitch I’m still counting
You niggas got problems, well I got bigger problems
My guns all black, make me bring the nigga out 'em
You don’t want that, homie
Plus I got that pick-up on me, finger fuck nina, she horny, you won’t see tomorrow morning (Nigga)
We so fucking cold, young money, money old
Life is full of choices and your bitch chose (Nigga)
I’m so Holley Grove, f-fuck them other niggas
And if the gun's strong I'll paint a fucking picture
You know what I’m on, a bag of that strong
You know where I’m going, (Bitch) i’m going, going, gone!
Nigga holler at your boy, I-I don’t give a fuck
Got a silence on the gun, make me shut you niggas up

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Just a third ward gangsta, been filthy , top ranker
Hustler, shot caller
Kill 'em all, keep banking
Big mansions on the island
Popping shots out the bottle
Spending cause we’re winning
Five star, money, and power!
Hunting while we stunting (Bitch), triggerman hood rich
Built on some solid shit, bad bitch born rich
Chandelier (Shit), marble full of bricks
Turn water into wine, hit your set and paint that bitch
O-O-Out the Bentley with them doves, stashes for the plug
Green and red bottom, throwing hundreds in the club
Bossing on the shine, we the niggas running shit
Blood to blood-line, pearl white black tints
Head light, red light, spend them at the green light
Flash light, fast life, hit 'em for a cheap price
Uptown swagger life, living like we live it twice
Point blank aim (Nigga), give ah fuck about the price

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bitch I'm from New Orleans
Rest in peace Magnolia Shorty
And I come from Hollygrove
That bitch is wild as a safari
I go stupid, I go retarded
The grass is greener in my garden
Swagger meaner than the warden
Pow pow pow I ain't with arguing, hah
Leave a nigga leaking
If you scared go see the deacon
Got a silencer on the gun but them bullets still speakin
Got a buncha bitches tweaking
To tell me all of their secrets
And if I get in that pussy
I'm on her walls like graffiti
You a dead pita bread, you a fed ass nigga
I'm on my vampire, bloody red flag nigga
Fuck with Lil Tunechi, get your head smashed nigga
Hit you dead on the money call that dead cash nigga
And it's .. party time excellent; Wayne's World
Party time excellent; Wayne's World
Tonight I'll probly fuck another nigga girl
Party time excellent - Wayne's World

Young veteran, soon to be O.G

Willie the kid pull guns like a hamstring
No bull I push pro Vs like Pantene

Players get jumped like a trampoline, tangerine
Gators day, nay-sayers, mascara wearers
And my niggas on paper getting paper like ball players
No blood no foul, ya my heart cold as moscow
We NAPA killin like a hot towel
All my hoes hostile
Not me, never tell me "not now"
Rap niggas forty cal to your brow
Roof remover
We leave your brain with more air
Maneuver, I leave your bitch with a moist chair
Seduce her, ya
You rappers should be tired o' lyin'
But I know its hard like a tire iron
But yet it's complex like it's Mayan science
Or Aztec math
I'm crazy as a mess tab

Nobodies fly as this

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
They say powder makes you hyper
Reefer makes you calm
Cigarettes give u cancer
Well wounds make you dull
While I sip the purple harlot
Thick as my Southern drawl
Put me on the ocean floor wit a mermaid wit no draws
They got bats up in the cave
Upside down blood rushing to they head
They reacting off sound as I stand on the mound
Pitchin for the crown
Uptown bound face painted like a clown
Reciting scriptures from the chapters
Proverbs leviticus
Old ass rappers complaining what the business is
'Bout the state of hip
Soundin like some bitches hop your ass up off a rich nigga dick
Its ridiculous the new school nigga
What you need to do is become a resident
Under the condition
Get your ass up off your ass
And get your ass up on a mission
Become some competition
Like Federer and Nadal
Young money nigga we ball
Like Kobe or Chris Paul
For giving a whack cracker
Still sipping Cristal
Wavin the lifeline
Since lifes a bitch y'all
Raising up the skirts of jezzebels
For no cash like
"bitch give me that ass"
Or pulling up to the lot like
"give me that jag"
No pulling up to the lot like
"give me that lam"
They study me, yeah
They cram like im a final exam
If I hit you in your back
You'll need a spinal exam
Im something like a rhino or ram
Animal,beast
Irritating you pussies like chlamydia,yeast
YM militia you niggas better retreat
Or be like this beat
R.I.P. deceased

Ya already, ya better call every pallbearer in ya area the ball carrier gon' get popped

He gon drop like a flop
On the court I love sports
That's why I play my bitches cause I got game
That's why you pay my bitches (Yaay)
Same hustle new money
Im just hip hoppin like two bunnies
Who run it, bitch nigga moi
That was French, nigga
Not a kiss, nigga nah
Haha No homo, rappers get ate like 4 on 4
They say I fuck so and so
And I be like so, so and so
Nikes on they neck, they like let me breathe
Im sorry but I can't this is how we feed
This is why we hot
This is how we freeze
To fast to follow
This is why we lead
And the money in the pocket isn't why we Gs, see
This is how we shoot and this is how we leave
You know we tote steal, this is how we ease
You can get the steel if you try these thieves now
Pass me the swisher let me climb these trees
And them haters say we couldn't this is why we Bs
This shit like pudding, putting it down like gravitys pulling
Putting it down like gravitys pulling
Putting it down like gravitys pulling me to the ground

Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy
I won't pay for no pussy
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it
I'm a motherfucking G
And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Hell naw man I'm too throwed
Niggas stay getting shows
Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes

[Verse 1: Wale]
Pay for that, not me, no hell
Y'all the one that bring the c-notes out
This is K.O.D., now they wait on me
Cause if I do not arrive, there wouldn't be no show
Wale, Wale
Hear you talking, but I cannot stay
Chicks involved, but I cannot stay
I spit the raw, I leave a gay bitch, late
Turn your date to a lake, turn your 8 to a great
Turn a nine to a damn! without paying for the date
No debate, ain't no John
You done broke the safe just to get those broads
You been playing the Uno but you getting no drawers
And I poke her face and let her hold no cards
I ain't even tripping, or paying these women
Got plenty fish in that ocean and my rod game is so vicious
And my ? is 450, can I used the whip to 550
Now I 62 cause I get the loot, and she's gon' kiss the ring but no wedding

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Clap that ass, bitch, turn up
Nigga kill the pussy, call it murder
Swerve in the Murcielago
Me without a foreign car, man that's unheard of
In the Maybach, king with my feet up
Curtains drawn, bitch scream when you see us
Hi, I'm your leader, word to Onika
2500 for the sneakers, dope ass nigga, no beeper
I was 16 with a Beamer
Glock with the watch on Aquafina
Niggas going, hyena
Getting pussy posted up at the Dinah
Now we pull up, post in Medinas
With light-skinned bitch like Gina
Aston, Martin
Man that motherfucker cold like Keyshia
Stop signs, Simon says
We don't give a fuck, we run them
Like Tommy Young, been barely men
Man broke niggas, we don't live with them
I don't fuck around, I just fuck her friends
Got eagle doors on that brand new Benz
And a threesome with two twenty twins
I'm rich, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
(Bitch I'm Mack Ma-i-i-i-ine)
Trick what? Lace who?
Baby girl, that ain't what Maine do
Before I chase you, I replace you
Before I break you off, I'mma break you
Matter of fact, fuck you
Got a hundred chicks on my tour bus
Asian chicks, they adore us
I'm feeling like the nigga on the chorus
(Got this drank in my cup
And I'm 'bout to roll up)
Man this bitch talking too much, dawg
(I done came down, hold up)
Heard a nigga say pimping was dead
I showed them my watch and corrected them quick like, "Nah, niggas you're scared"
Now go get you some bread
See it's...
(Money over bitches, and bread over bed
Tell a bitch that I know Khaled, and she take it to the head)
Shit
Shit, one go to store for me
Got another one that's trying to ho for me
Hopefully, she bring more hoes to me
And reverse the game and make em bring dough to me

[Hook][Intro: Birdman] + (Yo Gotti)
(Yea!) Birdman, pussy
Sittin' on this muthafuckin' hill
(Rich Gang, billionaire status)
All day! One hundred

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I believe dreams come true
I believe dreams come true
I believe dreams come true
Close my eyes woke up in that Bugatti coupe
That bitch ain't got a roof
This 1.5 on a coupé
Rich Gang, nigga dreams come true
Bad bitch, I make her dreams come true

[Interlude: Yo Gotti] + (Birdman)
Rich Gang, nigga dreams come true
Dope boy, I'm a dream come true
(Big Gang Millionaires, nigga)
I believe dreams come true

[Ace Hood]
Ace Hood, dat right
Hood Nation, OG, whattup doe?
You already know...

I believe dreams come true
Can't wait for the Rolls Royce to make the coupé (can't wait)
I'm lying on a mil, that's the truth (yea)
Spent five thousand dollars on some shoes
That's what you call stuntin'
I turn in none, ran into my freak bucket (oh word)
Then turn a pussy, ran into my cute puppet
No ventriloquist, I make it talk to me (Hi!)
I'm the richest nigga in my hood
10 chains on me, smoking Cali good
Private plane luggage never necessary
I can take you where they never could
That super fly shit is mandatory
Chasing all this money, I just can't avoid it
Jesus pieces only keeping me anointed
Getting richer, niggas highly disappointed
But umm...

[Hook] + [Interlude]

[Mack Maine]
And I done seen dreams come true
Bentley truck 'bout to drop, give me two (haha)
Presidential rollies for my whole crew
Me and Bird see the world through a bird's eye view
Man we started from the bottom now we here (yea)
GT V bottles at the table, no beer (ya heard?)
Hustlers' my career, never had fear
I'm flying on a lear high, rest in peace Aaliyah
Man I spent 3.5 Million on a crib
Young Hot Boy, had to get how I live
The main question is, why am I always smiling? I'm living
I was born with the drive, now a nigga get driven
Young Money

[Hook]

[Birdman]
And I done seen dreams come through
11 hundred catana, sock on the new shoe
Moving birds out the coupé
The sun do shine, we can knock him off for the loop (BLAAAT~!)
Stunna Island out the pound homie
Stunna Island with my rounds homie
Moving eleven, strapped with a mack
A hundred G's in a dufflebag stacked
White doves, and we serving out of Bentley
Uptown, moving round, now we filthy
Paint the whole town
Red on that brown, lay 'em all down (BLAAAT!)

[Hook] w/ Birdman ad-libs

[Outro: Birdman]
Yea!
Party never stops, nightlife poppin'
Take that shit to the mansion nigga
Stunna island where we hold it down, put it down
One hundred[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
I like a long haired, thick red-bone
Open up her legs, then Filet Mignon that pussy
I'mma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in, I'mma own that pussy
Go on, throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick,now come here let me dope you
You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you Dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
But you can call me Tunechi
I'll fuck the whole group, baby I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise, I should be hooked on Phonics
But anyway, I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it, back-back it up and dump it)

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and she like us too, and ohhh
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Ohh-oh-ohhhhhhh

[Verse 2: Drake]
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they wanna talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all
Young Money man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest
And what are all your names, again? we drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am? let's be honest
She wants me, she wants me
Cause I got it all, shorty, tell me what you don't see?
I will fuck with all y'all, all of ya'll are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say, "Pussy, pussy, pussy"
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all
Damn, and every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jae Millz]
I ain't being disrespectful, baby I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, some married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss, you can get the business, ha

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log and I'mma call all of y'all
My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out "papi" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too, boy I gets my pimpin' on

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
(And bitch I'm Mack Maine...)
Sanna Lathan, Meagan Good
Angelina Jolie (hah) D. Woods
For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no not at all
Kit-Kat a midget, if that ass soft, I'll break her off
I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind a Christian like Dior cause he are
Mack Mizzle... baby
Cause he are Mack Mizzle, baby

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world [x5]
Young Mula, baby
