[Hook: Soulja Slim]
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me
Uhh I like it like that she working that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me
Uhh I like it like that she working that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me

[Verse 1: Soulja Slim]
I'm a dick thrower
Her neck and her back hurting
Cut throater, I'll have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jicky jerking
Slow down for me, you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm trying to grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and Ima make you get of me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
I'ts like I got the world in my palms
Your girl up under my arms, she fucked up from the charm
She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 till early in the morn
Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me I'm strong
If you going through your cycle I ain't with It I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby you know they was wrong
Na make it official wheres some of that dom
I don't mind buying to, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil Mama my shit together I ain't driving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'nolia get a chance with it
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Soulja Slim]
Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping that she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya ima see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'mma deal with ya

[Juvenile]
I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handfull
I know what's happening all I want is a sample
Who you with, I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on hoes, dawg the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me

[Hook - 2X]
Either you love me or love me not I'mma be me
I'm known for making promises that I can't keep
And baby the streets made me
And I run 'em 24/7 365 daily

[Verse 1]
Look you knew what you was dealing with from day one
I'm not a lil boy, yeah I'm young with a lot of old vet ways
Its only been a few days and so you say
You love me in a married way, yeah okay
I've been several types of relationships
And I feel Joe too, love don't make no sense
Its all on me if I want this thang to work out
I know your goal is to try trap me that what you heard bout
I ain't been home in a few days cause you be traveling
I let you get your mind right cause I ain't with the kicking and scratching
I'm on parole, I can't be riding for domestic violence so I stay my distance
When there two ways to beat the pussy up and I'm bout my business
If I gotta beatcha then I don't need ya, let the next man do it
You done ran me away from you now, how you gone prove it
Being stupid, you done lost out
Now its next to the boss bitch with the boss mouth
You know what I'm talking bout

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Son say he seen me distributing something
You know that boy dirty, he didn't see me distributing nothing
So now its back doing jail time all over again
And josphine means bumping running working the pin
I only got 500 for me but I keep ten
But you my number one and you don't suppose to know about them
Deep in your heart you know that I'm a true player boy
But its cool I take that nigga I take my player charges
I don't know why you making me promise to come home to you
Yeah Im comin fuck but thats bout the only thang I can do
You noticed how I put the truth in front of the player
The world revolves round cane and thats why I take it there
God forgive me but I swear I think I'll never change
And I'm still stuck on that old saying no pain no gain
What said me not to be explain decision ya understand
I'm a man, so I gots to keep the upper hand
You know what I'm saying

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah I got feelings but my first real old lady left with'em
A refuse to give'em back, so I'm rolling like that
What I really loved is gone now
Thats why I stay in another nigga house when he ain't home now
Putting that brod down player please don't feel played
She was uptown looking and got herself a true lover head
Your girl and all my hoes got my psyched up
Calling on caddy daddy just to get the right fuck
You best tighten up your game cause it hurting charlie
I pop a rodly feel my game tight than everybody
On the low you don't even know I got her pop it two
And thats just one of the thangs I know you couldn't make her do
It ain't nothing for me to take over a strong mind
Even Eve couldn't tell a bitch that love blind
I don't be lying when you asked for something its no's and yes'
She got my name on her thigh, her back, and her chest, like I'm impressed

[Hook][Soulja Slim]
Man I sure don't need them dick suckers fuckin' wit me right now brah
Man I'm muthafuckin' high right now man, shhh, fuckin' wit a nigga

[Hook: repeat 2X]
It's hard to maintain this soulja life mentality
If it be a tradgedy, dem white folks come & hassle me
Gon' slam me down & wrestle me, just to put on handcuffs
Then charge me wit resistance when they told me throw my hands up

[Soulja Slim]
Just cause I'm a black man, push a 2G Lac an
Mouth fulla golds an my neck & wrist frozen
They label me a drug lord supplyin' the 3rd Ward
When I only push some Ghetto D wit Master P & my Tank Doggs
Money in the bank dawg, dem haters don' like dat
Bitch this ain't the slave days, us niggas gon' fight back
You crackers can write dat all up in the magazines
Put me on a T-V screen & I'm gon' say the same things
You can call me racist, black man in this white world
I'm sick seein' sell out niggas married to these white girls
Knowin' they the enemy, can't never be no friend of me
I just get my dick sucked, nut in they mouth instantly
They ain't nothin' but freakshows, you feel dats what you need though
While you off at work or somethin' she fucked one of yo people
Now you want to kill somethin', pull of you an O.J
If you ain't got the dream team then you ain't winnin' yo case
I get all up in yo face & call you a straight house nigga
I know yo gon' press charges on me
Whip my pistol all up in yo mouth, nigga

[Hook]

[Soulja Slim]
Black man kill a black man, it's cool they lovin dat
Black man kill a white man & the sentencin' him to death
White man kill a black man then scream about selfdefense
Break it down to manslaughter wit all of the evidence
Ever since I been here, been nothin' but sin here
I done backed up out the game just to persue my career
So I'm gon' say this loud & clear, muthafuck the white man
Ku Klux Klan talk shit but they don't want start shit
Niggas today ignorant, especially my little generation
Squeeze triggers wit no hesitation for any kind little of altercation
Rappin' is my occupation but I'm still ride wit my pistol though
An drop the top on the low low so I an feel the wind blow
Pull up on side of white folks, smile show every gold I got
Smokin' on some sticky sticky but yall like to call it pot
Young black man callin' shots, middle finger to all the cops
Suck a nigga dick pullin' ya Glock out for a little traffic stop

[Hook]

It's hard to maintain this soulja life mentality
If it be a tradgedy

[Soulja Slim]
Yall know what they gonna do ya understand, these niggas out chea
Talkin' bout a nigga hatin' on them, what the fuck you talkin' bout a
Nigga hatin' on you bitch ass nigga, you know who hatin' on you

Oh shit, (um, um), oh shit(um, um), oh shit(um, um)

[Verse 1]
Look I like 'em with a small waist and nice hips
So when I'm hittin from the back I get a nice grip
I be sweatin like a dog and I might slip
So with the right hips I get a tight vise grip
I got that work and I just come from doin time again
You can't slip you see the line that they standin in
Don't trip I got enough of dick for all of ya'll
They say that I'm a dog right after I knock 'em off
She mad at me tryna get me out some out money
You gets nothin from me you gon' be broke around the bar this Sunday
Believe that, you gon' see that
I'm a thug ain't no love for the club rats
Yeah I told you I was breakin bread
But breakin bread to a limit you heard what I said
I ain't stutter I'm a cheeky ass motherfucker
If you a hustler let me see you work them booty muscles
Get jiggy wit it

[Hook 2x]
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
If I want it, if I want it
If I want it, if I want it

[Verse 2]
I'mma leave some passion marks on fire red
Suck on her neck like a vamp when we in that bed
I'm like 'Jada' I stopped 'kissin' a long time ago
I'mma player and I don't put nothing past a ho
Move on it slow but I move fast when I want that ass
Then break camp like a rockhead done stole the stash
I'mma holla. I got Caramel waiting on me, Red hating on me
She think I really give a fuck that she skating on me
What you ain't heard the news? All of 'em confused
For everyone that I lose I bounce back with two
You in love with me? Yeah I'm in love with you
Not mentally but physically and what ya mouth do
Yeah that booty loose, like a rubber band
I ain't make it like that, that was that other man
I just start hitting it a few weeks ago
If you a pro let me see you make that thing show

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let me see you walk with it, make her mad
She hating on you cause she ain't working with too much ass
I'm waiting on you to make me and my dawg proud of you
Throw that ass this way I got a few dollars for you
I'm hollering for you I got three 50's and eight 20's
I'll give you these three 50's if you rolling with me
The rest going on a motherfucking hotel
Soulja Slim got that work, you can go tell
I let my dawgs hear the screaming on the Nextel
I'm a motherfucking dog, send me to hell
I fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck all (I'ma dog like that)
I'm a motherfucking dog like that (just like that)

[Hook]It's cut throat to the bizzone
Ya heard MEEE
Yea, this how we get down
And it goes like

[Hook 4x]
Rata Tata
Tata tata
Tata tata
Tata tata
Tata tata BOOM!

[Verse 1]
Life! if you live it trife then you gotta pay the price
Think twice before you shake 'em up and roll them dice
We all die, but why so soon from the womb to the tomb
We gets rata tata'd tata tata BOOM
Same tune, "they ain't have to do him like that"
Closed casket, emptied 32 out the mac
Face off, something makeup can't replace dawg
Yea I knew him, and I knew the killers that done it to him
But I mind mines, in a way it's better him than me
It ain't like we was runnin, but we got loaded back in the g
You know how that go, I still show sympathy and tilt my hat though
I might go view the body, I'ono if I'mma make the funeral
And all the hot girls that used to twerk, claim they had work
But quick to say, "save me one of his t-shirts"
But later on that night they be at the DJ backin' that ass off Jubilee
Reminiscing how they used to be

[Hook 4x]

[Verse 2]
Could you picture your own death before you die
When I die, I wanna know who in the fuck gone ride
It hurt inside to make me even think like that
But on the real, will my soldiers let me get spanked like that
Who killed Pac, who killed Biggie, it's a mystery
Unsolved murders that made history, in the industry
I send my prayers to both of em, they livened up the rap game
Showed me how to maintain and watch over my chain
Still wear my vest from day to day, no it can't stop a AK
But run down on me with a handgun I might can stand one
But not too many
My reaction is to start blastin letting of 20
Hit anybody in the way of my trigger play
No kids though, I play the game how it go
I retaliate, but not like last funky 4
From '94 to '95 and '96
Momma prayed for her baby cause I stayed in war(raw) shit
Above the law shit, raw shit, nigga feel me
Been to prison for 2 years, still think a nigga wanna kill me
So I'm riding hot, I'd rather get caught with it than without it
If I could I'd make moves with momma cause she all the way 'bout it

[Hook 8x]

This one goes out to all the Magnolia, Calio, Melphamene
Ya understand, UTP, Ya understand ME
Cutthroat to the bone and nuttin elseTalking:
Whats that big baby?
You know whats sound dog
They gon' like this here, ya heard me?
They go like, you know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck 'em

Chorus:
From what I was told niggas say I'm a hit No Limit like Pac
Hit Death Row and make some mon', now dance ho
And blow, up like the world trade
And be protected by No Limit tanks, soldiers with K's and hand grenades

Could you recall a soulja that used to be crawlin'
Now I'm ballin', don't plan on fallin'
For the world
Left the furl in the dope man, on the set
Cause I got plans bigger then the desire projects
I run with steel object toes, niggas that smoke coke
And watch 'em in they back scopin'
Outta all soldier haters
Quick Draw McGraw niggas see ya later
Cradle to the grave ya
Ya daddy made ya?
Let's see if he can be ya savior
When I cave ya chest in with me murder weapon
They can't find out Smith and Wesson
Only Glocks and street machines with infer beams
You know what I mean
Fully automatic things light up the scene
And break ham like Carl Lewis
Nothin but gun smoke is all ya smell
Niggas lying dead on bullets and shells
My people dwells to Uptown
Where the shit goes down
Shot callers and big ballers, mothers know
And do-do brown, Beats By The Pound, somethin' you could smoke too
Flavors like ? red, beans, rice, gumbo the stew
My little one said its all on you, and Choppers City
My ? clique clanin' posse
Ain't no stoppin', my committe
Shits bigger then me, Nino Black
And a can of Trinity, ya feelin' me?

Chorus

Incarceration had me real impatient
I was local until ya heard me on Down South Hustlers, it was nation
That told this shit is my creation
Is it real, yeah, cause niggas wearin' soldier rags and shit
Keepin' it twreal
My reservation is to make some mills
And stay independent
Stay wearin' girbauds and polos, and soldier Reebok tennis
Crushed out tank on my neck
Protect my chest like a vest
No more coke, no more dope, just alcohol and sess
Respect my rhyme because my mind is filled up with anger
Sound like I got a Glock for it
With black ? bullets in the chamber
Wait to be released and decease fake ass MC's
Niggas best freeze cause I squeeze gats and burn to the third degree
Make you wonder will you ever breathe again like Toni Braxton
Leave ya skull fraction, about more action than Jackson
So you better ask somebody that know me
If they real they gon' tell ya whats real
If they fake they gon' soldier hate
I can freestyle about it without makin' no mistake, ask Trey
That's my compadre, a nigga that I ride with, all day
Got it cocked
And in the trunk bumpin' nothin' but the Beats By The Pound funk
Pull that skunk out, the windows fogged up
And the system all the way pumped
Everything we drop be fire, don't nothin' be bunk

Chorus

I was a weed fiend, dope fiend and coke fiend with low key
And I was on the cumma move
When UNLV used to rock the club 49
Back in 93
Ho was givin' me love
Niggas givin' me daps and hugs
Soldiers respect soldiers, and soldiers respect thugs
Thugs gotta respect soldiers, if they don't want they life to be over
Brought to a closin'
Ain't nothin' changed but the name
When ya say soldier
Mean magnolia
Ya got that?
And me keep me Glock, for they cocked back
Hoes jock that, when a nigga be all the way real
Only thing they want is the dough, dick appeal
But I don't fuck around no more
And only saw me like that you little clown ass ho
If my flow was a gun, bitch you would run
When you hear my come, from the head
Every lyric is a bullet
Fuckin' ya up with some of this shit I say
In 95 nigga left for me dead but I didn't die
And some of the soldiers die
They only multiply
God left me alive, so I can blow up in the world
I thank the man every night for takin' me off that pearly girl
It gave me the opportunity to raise my son and my community
Cause now a days niggas got guns and shit
Screamin' out unity
Motherfuckin' nigga bruisin' me
That something I can't go for
I done signed the contract
Shut the studio door[Snoop]
This a mothafuckin' hot record right here
Your about to witness some shit
Ya never thought you'd witness before (fire)
Fin' to get ingorant up in this biatch (beats by the pound)
Y'all know what time it is (DPG)
What y'all thought?
I wasn't gonna be on? (get rowdy rowdy, rowdy rowdy)(what?)

Here we go again, my flow again, is dope enough
I tilt my brim for Soulja Slim its time to open up
I tuck my heater in my drawers, right next to my balls
I got some weed up in my jaw, stuck in shuckles breakin' laws, mayne
Mr. Magnolia, the high roller, knew I'd pull him over
And bless him with a fat sack of some dolja, told ya
See I'm a soldier represtin' West Coast, cuz
But South Side, rip ride, go on and give it up
I can't fake it, for all my niggas moving weight
From state to state, get your mothafuckin' paper plates
And stack that shit nigga, go on and get your grip on
I'm in it to win it for No Limit (for life)
So nigga trip on (thats right)
And dip on , cause we gon' keep makin' hits (makin' hits)
And the kinda music, that makes you wanna bust a bitch (b-i-atch)
I used to make that shit (uh), that make you wanna drive by
Then P sat me down, hooked me up (uhh) and strapped me down
With the rowdy rowdy (rowdy rowdy) bout it bout it
Suicide, pull a ride, nutty buddy, with the cutty on the side
Sittin' on, 3's with D's, on top of dub
I'm down South in the club gettin' much love (nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now a thing about me and young cuz
We hit No Limit at the same time (nigga, what, what, what, what?)
Say what?
Doggy Dogg and Soulja Slim at the same time
Is in it to win it for No Limit at the same time
You got my back, I got your back at the same time
You blast for me, I'll blast for you at the same time

[Soulja Slim]
I'll blast for you, you blast for me at the same time
Blow up some dolja with a soldier at the same time
Niggas stay real as the fuck at the same time
You ride for me, I'll ride for you at the same time
Me and Snoop hit No Limit at the same time (time)
Watch me put it down and shine
And make the whole world respect my mind (mind)

But these niggas acting like bitches at the same time (same time)

At the same time, my nigga Snoop D-O double G (G)

Ever since been in basements been doing raw shit for me

[Snoop]
Straight Up

Before my casket drop put my pistol up in there

[Soulja Slim]
I talk dis shit & I stomp my feet
Cause I'm a street nigga from the U-P-T
I keep my heat & don't squash no beef
They say I wouldn't see 20 but now I'm 23
Bout to be 24 wit a brand new Escalade
An a Deville park in my front driveway
My girl push the pedal to the flo' in a 2G Tahoe
When we floss we ride slow & blow behind tinted windows
Laughin' at these niggas frontin' up in the luxury rentals
They screamin' soulja dis & the screamin' soulja dat
But Soulja don't play no games I'll put yo head on a flat
Ain't to much changed about me still the same from way back
89' goin' into 90' had the game down pat
Momma couldn't find me, ya baby boy flippin' crack
Flippin' dimes, flippin' twenty's tryna come up
Got me a duece five for the jackers runnin' up
Ready to bust & drop my nuts, don't give a fuck

[Hook]

[Soulja Slim]
I smoke to much til' I be bout to fall out
Fuckin' wit Snoop Dogg off in the Dogg House
Since I balls outta control, balls outta control
Dem laws outta control, dem laws outta control
They actin' like ridin' on chrome is a crime
That's why I play the factory, so the won't be hackin' me
Had enough of ridin' in a 2G hot, wit a Glock an a beamer on top
Wit a vest on, T-shirt made teflon
Fellin' like Spice-1, "wouldn't look to pretty wit my chest gone"
Cause nigga don't play in the city of choppers
Most niggas get they shit split behind money & poppers
Wit air max on, prop top, & nigga boxers
You niggas better get yall fuckin' mind right

[Hook]

[Soulja Slim]
Straight like dat, for the fuckin' 2G ya nigga

My little one said its all on you, and Choppers City
My ? clique clanin' posse
Ain't no stoppin', my committe
Shits bigger then me, Nino Black
And a can of Trinity, ya feelin' me?

Chorus

Incarceration had me real impatient
I was local until ya heard me on Down South Hustlers, it was nation
That told this shit is my creation
Is it real, yeah, cause niggas wearin' soldier rags and shit
Keepin' it twreal
My reservation is to make some mills
And stay independent
Stay wearin' girbauds and polos, and soldier Reebok tennis
Crushed out tank on my neck
Protect my chest like a vest
No more coke, no more dope, just alcohol and sess
Respect my rhyme because my mind is filled up with anger
Sound like I got a Glock for it
With black ? bullets in the chamber
Wait to be released and decease fake ass MC's
Niggas best freeze cause I squeeze gats and burn to the third degree
Make you wonder will you ever breathe again like Toni Braxton
Leave ya skull fraction, about more action than Jackson
So you better ask somebody that know me
If they real they gon' tell ya whats real
If they fake they gon' soldier hate
I can freestyle about it without makin' no mistake, ask Trey
That's my compadre, a nigga that I ride with, all day
Got it cocked
And in the trunk bumpin' nothin' but the Beats By The Pound funk
Pull that skunk out, the windows fogged up
And the system all the way pumped
Everything we drop be fire, don't nothin' be bunk

Chorus

I was a weed fiend, dope fiend and coke fiend with low key
And I was on the cumma move
When UNLV used to rock the club 49
Back in 93
Ho was givin' me love
Niggas givin' me daps and hugs
Soldiers respect soldiers, and soldiers respect thugs
Thugs gotta respect soldiers, if they don't want they life to be over
Brought to a closin'
Ain't nothin' changed but the name
When ya say soldier
Mean magnolia
Ya got that?
And me keep me Glock, for they cocked back
Hoes jock that, when a nigga be all the way real
Only thing they want is the dough, dick appeal
But I don't fuck around no more
And only saw me like that you little clown ass ho
If my flow was a gun, bitch you would run
When you hear my come, from the head
Every lyric is a bullet
Fuckin' ya up with some of this shit I say
In 95 nigga left for me dead but I didn't die
And some of the soldiers die
They only multiply
God left me alive, so I can blow up in the world
I thank the man every night for takin' me off that pearly girl
It gave me the opportunity to raise my son and my community
Cause now a days niggas got guns and shit
Screamin' out unity
Motherfuckin' nigga bruisin' me
That something I can't go for
I done signed the contract
Shut the studio door[Hook]
Ya talkin' that shit bitch nigga
Wusup, wusup , wusup, wusup
Better Get Cha Mind Right
What What , Huh what
[4x]

[Soulja Slim]
One lonely Soldier I be
The last real nigga still down with Master P

I looked up to niggas like Glenn Metz and Skully so fuck Gotti

I'm a real soulja lets go to war & I'mma show ya
I don't have a damn conscience about nathan
How ya figure I won't cut your throat & leave ya shakin'
Down south money makin' dats all a nigga know
Niggas I used to run wit still like to snort coke
Lay it down, let tha gram go around, yeah yall get full

Cause ain't nothin' like dat boot up nigga, suit up nigga
Lets go & get 'em, I got some niggas I wanna shoot up nigga
Now I get high off stackin' my mail
Dodgin' back uptown, don't wanna see no more jail cells

[Hook 2X: Soulja Slim]
Is dat gun smoke I smell?
What's dat? niggas lying dead on bullets & shells
Is my city really livin' hell?
Do I gotta keep my pistol everywhere dat I dwell?

[Soulja Slim]
Nigga my mind is made to be respected
When you get disrespected dats when shit gets hectic
I flex wit automatics dat will bang ya up
Once ya in, ya fucked, better have ya shit clutched
I take nuts & have 'em for souvneirs
Brains bust & so does guts when shit gets real
Blood spills on tha curbs of dat 3rd
Killa connection train to serv, Magnolia niggas words
Why's dat? they say uptown's a cut throat area
They same nigga dat killa ya be one of your paul bearers
Dope fiends don't give a lilly fuck about nothin'
You ain't never been thru what I've been thru
You ain't never seen what Ive seen
Street machines dat'll take off body parts, if you get caught
Slippin' in tha dark, by niggas dat bang & by niggas dat snort
Play it smart if you wanna live life on life terms
Cause niggas get third degree burns behind jiggas & ferns

[Hook]

[Soulja Slim]
Out of towners don't want no beef & I know
Cause they keep it on tha low, what they gots about tha N-O
Fuckin' right my city's all dat & then some
Small boy from tha south murdered out for income
Which one fuck I might choose tha crowd I'mma hit one
Innocent bystanders don't be standin' dats how shits done
Where I'm from? New Orleans tha killa capital
On Washington Avenue hustlers a hassle you & jack you too
You at your own risk walkin' up 6th
Tha last nigga got mac-9'ed & blowed a kiss
Picture this I fuck wit souljas dat hop outta tha trees
Put pillow cases over their heads damandin' ki's & G's
At broad daylight, you niggas take life for a joke
Is dat gun smoke, gun smoke?[Soulja Slim/Big Ed]
Chorus
We suggest that you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring the more heads we bust
[Soulja Slim]
It's do or die on the streets that I roam, that I roam
That's why I never leave my gun at home, gun at home x2

[Soulja Slim]
Shit, niggas not goin for the chest these days
Niggas catch ya down bad and bust your motherfuckin head
Put it like that, should have had your gat but nigga you chose to slip
And the nigga chose to let all thirty two out the extension clip
In to your dome, that news gon meet ya momma home
I'll let you slide one time cause she was full of that fucking rum
But you wanna draw down and stunt in front of these pussy poppers
I'm from uptown so you know I gots to get you partner
I've been doin this and you just jumped off the porch with the new jacks
And I got quick reaction to bustin back and hit somethin
Fuck the stuntin, me, myself
Im twirkin somethin and hurtin somethin
Straight dome shot, and when ya fall
Got that look on my face like fuck em all
Then walk off with an innocent look on my face
Soon as I get to the corner, pick up the pace
Running like I'm running a race
Cause I ain't bout no more murder charge catching
Down here them people blues ya, lose you in a second
Get convicted for life, now you trying to appeal
Should have gave them a dome shot, should have played it real
I suggest you don't fuck with us
Suggest don't fuck with us
I suggest

Chorus x2

[Big Ed]
We some hard ass niggas, Big Ed and Soulja Slim
Niggas bust at us, watch us end low and bust at them
Get out the way, kids getting hit and shit
Already split forty rounds and not even a half a clip
Bitches know me as the assassin, tip toe and squeezing and blasting
Camoflauge fatigue feared off in a black ski maskin
A No Limit soldier, nigga we ain't scared to bring it
Nigga I'm tryin to leave the streets behind
And put in no wax and singing
And nigga keep my gat trown up like ????
Trigger finger itching like crabs
Got me strapped tighter then hoes legs wrapped around me when I stab
Nigga think got more deadly so I got more gats
Totin to edge two compacts, Big Ed be puttin it down like that!

Chorus x2

[Mr. Serv-On]
It's the S to the E to the R to the V
To the O to the N to the T to the R to
The U to the N to the I to the G to the K to the A
Can't carry ya, drama marry ya
Step across this fuckin line my tank stroll motherfucker
I straight deal ya
Be like blasting, stepping like a fuckin hog
Soulja Slim ya know me, Big Ed get at me dog
I'm still asking the lord to bless me
These niggas persist to test me
After the night, only the gangsta hell gonna accept me
I'm ready to lay my claim niggas know the game
Ain't shit changed, five hundred dollars
I'm soed up and I'm still creeping
Round the corner with my mask on
Got my gloves on, ready to get my fucking blast on
So when you see me, nigga bow down to this fucking tank
You niggas wanna be like us but you niggas fucking can't
So I'm tired of you motherfuckers
Asking why I twist my hat and wear my colors
It's all tank love, fuck the others
It's real nigga (real)I be thinking bout' a whole lotta ways of getting paid
And got a lot of ways of getting mine, all the time
If you got it, then I want it, that shit don't stop
Let me get that out ya' nigga
Still we closing down shop
And taking hits at the same time, trying to maintain my ends
Fuck a benz, I'm trying to get a Land Rover
Riding down Magnolia, hit the horn at the real soldiers
Fuck the ones who wanna see me dead all over in Angola
Have 'em saying "Damn, that boy done came up, he done got famous"
And "I know you couldn't test that nigga, cause he was on that dust"
Yeah I caught a joce, but that just was my wake up call
A year and 6, back in town with a lot of rounds
They said I'm tripping, I've got a gift that God gave me
I'll be slipping, I'm crazy, I'm a hustler

Hook
Hustlin' is a habit, we gots to get our paper
Straight mob niggas, touching 6 figures on these capers (x4)

I be an artist like Picasso, when it come to these jacks
Flood my nostrils with this powder, boy you surf to get wet
I need it all in one pop, cause boy my habit can't wait
Get tough, kiss this M-11, and quality on like a safe
See, my trigger finger's shaky, got a bad taste in my mouth
See my nose starting to run and that mean that time bout' out
You know the ghetto's trying to kill me
Thats why I'm giving it to you raw
Fuck what you heard about a nigga, and believe what you saw
Since life or death in these streets, and my seeds gotta eat
The lord gave law to the land
The strong survive by the weak
Don't play no games, cause I'm tweaking, and you know whats next
Get ass-hole Luke out on the floor, oh yeah come up out that there Rolex
Thats on the G to the H to the O-S-T
Hustlin' is a habit and there ain't no cure for me

Hook (x4)

FUCK PEACE, its a violent society
I'm lacking the currency, but shit I need the bread so I can eat
Cops stop it, they don't purify the streets, nigga from Smack Meets
Cause I tell it how it be
Some dope fiends owe me, so they got they ass beat
Such a cold world, wicked ghetto tragedy (your telling me)
I got soldiers with forces and traits from Angola
Pelican fate, meal quick at your ?atrophy?
Tell me why it has to be, cause I'm a G
So many fake ass hoes and foes
Thats how the world goes
Billy Block owed double kilos, she load the steel-o
We on the D-low
Don't make me push it aside like Rico
We getting money in my Bubblelaud Benz
???????? and Magnolia Slim
Boy, why these suckers try to do me
Why they mad
Cause I'm influenced by niggas who make they own movies
While you acting moody, Crooked pass me the tooly
I'm a tuck 'em farther down till they do me
They be shining like African rubies
I'mma a real hustler nigga....

Hook[Soulja Slim]
Oh shit, (um, um), oh shit(um, um), oh shit(um, um)

[Verse 1]
Look I like 'em with a small waist and nice hips
So when I'm hittin from the back I get a nice grip
I be sweatin like a dog and I might slip
So with the right hips I get a tight vise grip
I got that work and I just come from doin time again
You can't slip you see the line that they standin in
Don't trip I got enough of dick for all of ya'll
They say that I'm a dog right after I knock 'em off
She mad at me tryna get me out some out money
You gets nothin from me you gon' be broke around the bar this Sunday
Believe that, you gon' see that
I'm a thug ain't no love for the club rats
Yeah I told you I was breakin bread
But breakin bread to a limit you heard what I said
I ain't stutter I'm a cheeky ass motherfucker
If you a hustler let me see you work them booty muscles
Get jiggy wit it

[Hook 2x]
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
If I want it, if I want it
If I want it, if I want it

[Verse 2]
I'mma leave some passion marks on fire red
Suck on her neck like a vamp when we in that bed
I'm like 'Jada' I stopped 'kissin' a long time ago
I'mma player and I don't put nothing past a ho
Move on it slow but I move fast when I want that ass
Then break camp like a rockhead done stole the stash
I'mma holla. I got Caramel waiting on me, Red hating on me
She think I really give a fuck that she skating on me
What you ain't heard the news? All of 'em confused
For everyone that I lose I bounce back with two
You in love with me? Yeah I'm in love with you
Not mentally but physically and what ya mouth do
Yeah that booty loose, like a rubber band
I ain't make it like that, that was that other man
I just start hitting it a few weeks ago
If you a pro let me see you make that thing show

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let me see you walk with it, make her mad
She hating on you cause she ain't working with too much ass
I'm waiting on you to make me and my dawg proud of you
Throw that ass this way I got a few dollars for you
I'm hollering for you I got three 50's and eight 20's
I'll give you these three 50's if you rolling with me
The rest going on a motherfucking hotel
Soulja Slim got that work, you can go tell
I let my dawgs hear the screaming on the Nextel
I'm a motherfucking dog, send me to hell
I fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck all (I'ma dog like that)
I'm a motherfucking dog like that (just like that)

[Hook][Verse 1]
(So Slim, do you have anything to say to the people?)
I'm a mothafuckin' Fool, and you, test my nuts
Not knowin', in guns I trust, and bust and put gats in the dust
You wanted some murder shit, well murder shit is what ya gettin'
I'm verbally spittin', got these niggas scared and shittin'
You fuckin' with the right one, soulja fo life one
Ain't no mothafucka like em, Where he at, show em to me
And I'm gonna strike em and bite em
And swallow em, for trying to be a follower
My deadly venom instantly kills em like a cobra
Leave it up to Magnolia To shut em down and sow it up
Dom P being toasted up break down sticky and roll it up
And smoke it up with enemies Claim to be friends with me
The whole while they into me When shit don't make sense to me
Whodi got a bently, and whodi got a jag
Whodi got a lot of shit that Soulja Slim never had
But, I don't get mad and start hatin, cuz that's bitch shit
If it wasn't for incarceration, I'd a been rich

[Hook]
I'm a fool
And I'm one of em, who likes to talk about what I'm about
Straight up tell ya to ya face what I'm gonna do
I'm a fool
These niggas fool hoggin, and ho hoggin
Drinkin' that hatorade, they don't wanna see me ballin'
I'm a fool
They can't stop me, they hoes jock me
How u luv that, baller block that
I'm a fool
I can hear em sayin it now
That's a fool there, a fool there

[Verse 2]
(knocks on the door)

Who's there?, it's me dog, me?
Where the fuck you was at when I was off in the penetentiary
When I was outta sight and outta mind
With only a handful of soldiers by my side
Rest of my so called niggas was jive
But I ain't gonna say no names, cuz they know who they be
So if you thinkin' I'm talkin' bout you, Fuck You
Cuz lately, I been feelin' since these niggas tryin' soulja hate me
That they wanna duct tape me
And knock me off, and drop me off, in the Nolia
But I'm shell shocked, clutchin' my Glock, bitch I'm a soldier
Pay yo round n them some change to come and get me
And I'm gonna be waitin' on em by myself with my pistols with me
Ain't nann nigga gon' ride, like I'm gon' ride for me
And ain't nann nigga gon die, like I'm gon' die for me
Believe that, I'm 100% real when ya look me up and down
You can see that, come at me and miss, and I'll be back
To touch somethin', hit somethin' and split somethin'
Quit stunnin', ya'll niggas ain't killin' nuttin'

[Hook]
I'm a fool
I been there, done that shit
When I'm off in that zone, nigga, tell me run that shit
I'm a fool
Angola bound, uptown
Skinny ass nigga weighin' a hundred somethin' pounds
I'm a fool
I represents what I say
Ain't no fuckin game here, ain't no instant replay
I'm a fool
I hear em sayin it now, that's a fool there, a fool there

[Verse 3]
(Slim, do you have anything to say to the haters who say you can't
Make it on the outside?)
Remember this old sayin' a wise man change A fool will stay the same
Fuck it, blame it on the game cuz its raining acid
Will I spend my life in a cell block or in a casket
Or will I get old and get my groove back like Angela Basset
Only time will tell, but until then I'll be stackin' my mail
Off my album album sells, Magnolia wear dwells
I love them bricks, I love the ghetto hoes
Cuz they gon' show ya what they workin' with
A lot of my little dogs, still be gettin' loaded
Walkin' around the project with the pistol out, talkin' swollen
Whodi don't give a fuck, cuz they dilly got em gone
Bout that foolishness, and gon' jack somethin' with they jones
They remind me of me, old Magnolia Slim
You can break ya ass off in this sewer water tryin' to swim
It's polluted, I'm foolishImagine making it big in this rap game
And you think it's all good
I'm here to tell you it ain't baby
You got every eye in the world on you
You gotta understand these people fear what they don't know

[Chorus 2x: C-Murder]
Imagine life with no jails or no laws
And no harassment on brothers in fancy cars
Now why they wanna trap me, make me a slave
They just mad cause a ghetto nigga breakin bread

[Verse 1: C-Murder]
I'm on the ground cuffed up like a dog
Said my cuffs too tight, but they laugh when they see me fall
I guess my skin too dark for them to hear me
I know they don't like me, for some reason I think they fear me
Quit tripping on my chains and my rings
I want to hit em, but I didn't cause I maintained
They got them FED's on the scene and they swear I got the cream
And the stolen truck green, canine all up in my jeans
They don't realize I'm a soldier
I had 'em pissed, ask your son, I know he got a C-Murder disc
Number one in every record store, mom and pops
He tapped my phones, but you know I ain't slangin rocks
Take me to jail is what I tell em, get me off the scene
My first call go to P, put my mind at ease
He told me not to trip, cause it's a bigger picture
And if they take you put it on TRU, I'm coming and get ya

[Chorus]

[Mac]
Woah, picture life without the crooked cops and without the cell blocks
Would you sell rocks, or would you be like me, I'm shell shocked
And I wouldn't stress it (why), cause I'm already strapped
Bulletproof vested
Waiting to be tested by the devil on that level
I used to sit on the porch with my Uncle Ben
And I watched the murder scene when I was 13, yeah, by the Melpomene
And it made me crazy, and it made me lose my mind
And time to time it crossed my mind
What if that wasn't a crime
Now Slim, would you kill for me and everything that's trill to me
If there was no law, and nobody was superstars
No state trooper cars to follow, you wouldn't have to swallow
Your rocks, or toss your Glocks with the hollows
I'd kill a rich man and drink his blood, would it bring me riches?
Or would I just be selling my soul to them wicked witches
We already in Babylon, the world is a ghetto and God is like the don
Nigga wooooah

[Chorus]

[Soulja Slim]
Now we get only get one minute to pray and a second to die
Could you picture the darkside before I let these bullets fly
From out my 4-5 see, I know what you mean
Is it life or death? Imagine living life with no breath
My imagination's a motherfucker when I'm full of stress
Too much killing, I won't supply the world with a vest
But that's impossible. Killing, it's unstoppable
Long as they got bullets and guns they got niggas that's droppable
Real niggas imagine if the world was surrounded by real niggas
We won't have a reason to kill niggas. Feel niggas?
My pain it runs so deep I'm a share it with y'all
Would my own niggas try to cutthroat me while I'm tryin to ball?
Dog, you ain't never seen what I seen
Murder scenes, packets, fuck it hurt to see moms screams
Picture, my nigga Reg reincarnated
Already imaginated us balling and dedicated

[Chorus]Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook - 2X]
Either you love me or love me not I'mma be me
I'm known for making promises that I can't keep
And baby the streets made me
And I run 'em 24/7 365 daily

[Verse 1]
Look you knew what you was dealing with from day one
I'm not a lil boy, yeah I'm young with a lot of old vet ways
Its only been a few days and so you say
You love me in a married way, yeah okay
I've been several types of relationships
And I feel Joe too, love don't make no sense
Its all on me if I want this thang to work out
I know your goal is to try trap me that what you heard bout
I ain't been home in a few days cause you be traveling
I let you get your mind right cause I ain't with the kicking and scratching
I'm on parole, I can't be riding for domestic violence so I stay my distance
When there two ways to beat the pussy up and I'm bout my business
If I gotta beatcha then I don't need ya, let the next man do it
You done ran me away from you now, how you gone prove it
Being stupid, you done lost out
Now its next to the boss bitch with the boss mouth
You know what I'm talking bout

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Son say he seen me distributing something
You know that boy dirty, he didn't see me distributing nothing
So now its back doing jail time all over again
And josphine means bumping running working the pin
I only got 500 for me but I keep ten
But you my number one and you don't suppose to know about them
Deep in your heart you know that I'm a true player boy
But its cool I take that nigga I take my player charges
I don't know why you making me promise to come home to you
Yeah Im comin fuck but thats bout the only thang I can do
You noticed how I put the truth in front of the player
The world revolves round cane and thats why I take it there
God forgive me but I swear I think I'll never change
And I'm still stuck on that old saying no pain no gain
What said me not to be explain decision ya understand
I'm a man, so I gots to keep the upper hand
You know what I'm saying

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah I got feelings but my first real old lady left with'em
A refuse to give'em back, so I'm rolling like that
What I really loved is gone now
Thats why I stay in another nigga house when he ain't home now
Putting that brod down player please don't feel played
She was uptown looking and got herself a true lover head
Your girl and all my hoes got my psyched up
Calling on caddy daddy just to get the right fuck
You best tighten up your game cause it hurting charlie
I pop a rodly feel my game tight than everybody
On the low you don't even know I got her pop it two
And thats just one of the thangs I know you couldn't make her do
It ain't nothing for me to take over a strong mind
Even Eve couldn't tell a bitch that love blind
I don't be lying when you asked for something its no's and yes'
She got my name on her thigh, her back, and her chest, like I'm impressed

[Hook][Soulja Slim talking]
The streets made me, you know they did, 6th Street, Magnolia Street, c'mon
M...A...G...N...O..L, I, A, thats the home where the souljas stay

[Hook-2x]
You niggas claim to be a soulja, but you souljas ain't no souljas
I told ya and I showed ya, I'm a soulja for life
Now what you hear is what you get, from a nigga like me
Uncut, raw shit, all I know is the streets

[Soulja Slim]
I got these niggas wearing soulja reeboks and soulja rags
I had these niggas off the porch in '94, snortin' powder bags
Magnolia Slim underground, Soulja Slim to the world
It's all the same, don't get it twisted, still uncut and explicit
Uptown's where I'm listed, look me up in the 3rd Ward
You might find me on the Parkway between Dourgenois and Broad
Smokin' herb, by the curb, but I ain't gone chill for too long though
Cause on that there block, them white folks be hot
Shoot up to wards Claybourne, make a left cut through Exon
Now I'm on Willow Street, the spot where the killers be
That's where I layed my head for years, I'm a representa
And I ain't talkin' bout this rap shit, nigga respect it or I'll send ya

[Hook-2x]

[Soulja Slim]
I'm soulja this, I'm soulja that, nigga what, I played the halls
Ran through the cut, 6 Co. fa'sho, The Circle, the killin' field
Where the killers chill, on the real, that been my spot since I was lil'
I can't tell these d's to chill, since Shorty Mike got killed
Open wound still soaked, it's gone heal
I run with trill niggas, we don't take no shit
If you got it, you better hide it, I still pull off robberies
Ain't a damn thing gravy, ain't a damn thing sweet
My beef they beef, they beef my beef
6 Co. nigga, 6 Co., Cut Throat nigga, screamin' Cut Throat

[Hook-2x]

[Soulja Slim]
I'm screamin' I'm a soulja cause I mean it nigga
From my black soulja reeboks to my beanie nigga
I soulja walk and talk crazy to these bitch niggas
Its in my blood, what the fuck, I'mma blast that trigga
What you forgot, with the murder charge in '96
Without no evidence, I ain't even do the shit, not guilty
You niggas should've been killed me
I done came up, me and my souljas bout to fuck the game up, be cool
M...A...G...N...O..L, I, A, thats the home where the souljas stay

[Hook-2x]

[Soulja Slim talking]
Cut Throat Comitty, the streets made me, the streets made me
Motherfuckers better know[Intro]
You know how I'm coming
You know exactly how I'm coming
(I'm telling you) It don't stop
Shit don't stop

[Hook x2]
My jacket consist of
Batteries on robberies, pistol charges, and murder
I know I'm the realest nigga you heard of besides 'Pac
Got niggas screaming Soulja from the street to the cell block

[Verse 1]
You bitch, you
Soulja Slim and his committee is coming to get you
My mag 90 bullets'll hit'chu and split'chu in half
That lil bitch boy staff won't last
Up against these motherfuckers that used to taking blood baths
I been smoking blunts with the devil, that's why my eyes red as the fuck
Now tell me, do I look like the type that'll be scared to bust?
Well, guess what? I'm screaming out murder me and I'm vest up
Chest up, test nuts, watch how I bless ya
You bitch made and I'm self-made, Magnolia, Calliope, Melph-made
I get through like a scalp blade and Kunta Kinte your left leg
I play surgeon and I'll be splurging in Denalis, Navis, and big bourbons
Don't stunt, dog, whatever I said, I'll come wit'cha, I'll come, dog
I'mma get mine for the two Gs and I'mma take it 'for I say please
I fuck with twirkers not the twirkees, put it on will give a nigga herpes
So I stay back, I mean way back, y'all didn't notice how I say that?
Well, then motherfuck y'all hated waving on three Gs laid back

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
As one time we was click tight, what the fuck's going on?
I just come home, my shit ain't going right
Everybody branching off doing they thing
Some of 'em in the studio and some of 'em they slang
That's how it go, I know this rap shit ain't gone last forever
So I stash cheddar for hard times, flipping to make it better
I can take ten Gs and make twenty more ten Gs with that
I'm from the six 'co circle where all the hustlers at
You busters stacking from 'round me with all that junk claiming
In ninety-five I ran on Tara Lane and bust a brain and
Smoking blunts and snorting 'caine with my girl Big Ree
'Til I started spooking out, thought a nigga was trying to kill me
Nigga feel me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Picture lil daddy think he raw, must've forgot I'mma vet
Freshen up his memory, then get him set for the flow of death
I got a way to make all real niggas feel my pain
Any more player-hating ass fake niggas look at me strange
Reverse the game, fuck his head up, leave him in the middle of the street
Nigga shit ain't tight enough to G-for-G with me
Actually, you don't even supposed to be in my presence
So I'mma ask you like a man, shit, playboy, get to stepping
Now if you walk off with that look like you gon' get your weapon
And I'mma do you something dirty for all that stunting and repping
Now as the beat goes on, my flow don't stop
'Til I make your girl drop it like it's hot
I can run some shit that make you pussy pop, it don't matter if you real or not
Play my game and I'll cheat on ya, pull the rubber off and skeet on ya
Haters slanging that shit pussy for me on the Magnolia street corner
You's a ho nigga, you know I know nigga
And I put that on all my six 'co fa sho niggas
I'm X4L chief of the mag booyay
Fuck what them niggas doing tomorrow cause I'm doing my thing today
That's how I'm living, just game giving to make y'all recognize
I been doing this and I ain't never took off my camouflage

[Hook x3]Soulja Slim
Only for the real, niggas who I fuck with
Know what I'm sayin'?
REal niggas gon' feel this shit
Cause its only who I fuck with
Know what I'm sayin'?

Show by hands
Put 'em up in the air if you bout makin' dollars
And you be bout this real shit
That be to hard to swallow
Come, follow?
Me to the land
The home of the soldiers
If not committed they will cut throat ya
Play brawl then go to
Soldier streets but don't sleeps
And shots to knock ya off ya feet
Specialise in assassinatin', all bustas who be soldier hatin'
My bodygaurd is the Lord
Mines in the back of my head
My dogg, a born killa
Treal nigga
Been runnin' with me since I was small
Alot of y'all probably know him, then again ya probably don't
Cause its sung to strugglin' that be ridin'
With head biters in the trunk
Elliotts name was double crosser
He'll double cross ya, when he woulda taught ya
Told me not to get my hand dirty
He'll be my nigga tosser
Tellin' me to do my rap thing
No Limit bring me out there
Just chill, and make my mills
With my skills and keep it real

Chorus-1:
That's a, born killa
1- A treal nigga
2+3- Big time, dope dealer
A real nigga, that get it how I live on it
Fuck with born killas, dope dealers and real niggas
Ill niggas, and treal niggas
That get it how the live nigga
Born killaz
Dope dealers
And treal niggas
That get it how they live

The real niggas, stay real
And the fakes stay fake
And you's a busta type nigga
Then stay the fuck outta my face
Because I'm tryin' to stay busta free
But y'all not hearin' me
Its nuts or cuffs
Get it how you live, on these city streets
And every nigga roam
Gotta be Bout It Bout It
Niggas pourin' syrup in the game
They not bein' solid
And thats the busta type
Niggas I can't fuck with so I stay my distance
And run with real soldiers that love me
Only a handfull, duck and holler back
Real niggas for sure got my back
All about the combat
All of the rest of 'em dead
Bread, ridin' red
A big dope dealer I used to fuck with doin' time in the vet
No need to say his name, my nigga used to slang them thangs
O-Z's and kilos
Heard the smack mayne
He used to give me grams
Never wanted to give me weight
He knew my habit, had me out there, he was goin' to get blazed
I respect that by me bein' an addict
I was, here I had to snort about half a gram to get me a buzz

Chorus-2

I got sent to the old jail, where alot of niggas don't survive
I rolled on the till bout a quarter of five
Got up early in the mornin'
Four feet up old mill
Guess who till rep
My dogg Cheer Will
He gave me five scoops, cause I just rolled in
But I gave that shit away
Cause my head bone bent
A murder charge in three attempts
What the fuck you expectin'?
I'm facin' life in prison, with a leathal injection
But these dick suckin' DA's
They refuse the charge
I rolled off B1, makin' boo-koo noise
Screamin' those bitches can't hold a Soulja like me down
Then my pajamas, socks and T-shirts, with a tank from ? town
I ain't stay out, cause thirty days
I come right back in this bitch
Probation violation, gotta do a year in six
I bet you dick suckers won't see me
No mothafuckin' more
I got big plans, ya understand?
By slangin' lyrics like dope
To all my people locked down, y'all be home in a second
Just keep it real, and stay treal and make them bitches respect ya

Chorus-3 till end[Intro]

[Hook: till end][Master P talking]
Check this out
When ain't nothin' else happenin'
And ain't no more money
The only nigga gon' be here for me, huh
Is the nigga that made me, my mama
Ya heard me?

[Soulja Slim]
I thank the Lord I got my mind right
My lifestyle was drastic
Tryin' to avoid the casket
Don't want my son to be a bastard
But y'all wouldn't know
But I seen that a couple of times
The Lord talked to me
Told me put the foolishness behind
It's not worth dying
Tryin' to represent where ya come from
Or makin' beef, because you feel like your that big G
I went the same way, but today, I'm on a higher level
I'm on a paper chase and runnin' behind it like a rebel
I want it all
So me and my mama can ball
The only one that pushed me up, in my downfall
And my pop, been in pennitentaries
10 wasted years
My mama wasted tears
But she brought me up, by herself, without no help
Used to catch whippings with a leather belt
But that ain't stop nothin'
I was a Soulja always into stuff
Elementary school I'm cuttin'
Gettin' caught wrote on the B roll
Mama, come sign me out
I don't like these phony people
Down here to come sign me out
Come bomb me out central lockup
I shoulda put the Glock up
And the two quarters I rocked up

Chorus: [Master P]
Mom, I love you cause you made me
But pray for your baby cause this ghetto got me crazy

[Trenitty]
I remember Indo sticks and concrete bricks
Dope fiends fix, Deathrow cliques
That pops them shits
Takin' hits
Had to make more grits
Than a homeless man, hungry man
Had to watch my mom twerk here body, for a ceilin' fan
Pops incarcerated so I hated as a child
But as I grew, I got to knew him so I dug his style
Livin' foul, the law was: get it how you live
Friend or foe, never forgive, crack that niggas rib
By any means ness, get your cake support your fam
Don't give a damn, robbin' neighbors for some ham
Even spam was a good dish
See we was poor, when we were sick, moms made us well with a kiss
I'm through, my most respect is due, so I spits my gat
Cracks my back
Makin' sure she gets the lack
So well deservin'
Pervin' in some shit I bought her
That's what she told us: remeber that blood is thicker than water

ChorusIt's cut throat to the bizzone
Ya heard MEEE
Yea, this how we get down
And it goes like

[Hook 4x]
Rata Tata
Tata tata
Tata tata
Tata tata
Tata tata BOOM!

[Verse 1]
Life! if you live it trife then you gotta pay the price
Think twice before you shake 'em up and roll them dice
We all die, but why so soon from the womb to the tomb
We gets rata tata'd tata tata BOOM
Same tune, "they ain't have to do him like that"
Closed casket, emptied 32 out the mac
Face off, something makeup can't replace dawg
Yea I knew him, and I knew the killers that done it to him
But I mind mines, in a way it's better him than me
It ain't like we was runnin, but we got loaded back in the g
You know how that go, I still show sympathy and tilt my hat though
I might go view the body, I'ono if I'mma make the funeral
And all the hot girls that used to twerk, claim they had work
But quick to say, "save me one of his t-shirts"
But later on that night they be at the DJ backin' that ass off Jubilee
Reminiscing how they used to be

[Hook 4x]

[Verse 2]
Could you picture your own death before you die
When I die, I wanna know who in the fuck gone ride
It hurt inside to make me even think like that
But on the real, will my soldiers let me get spanked like that
Who killed Pac, who killed Biggie, it's a mystery
Unsolved murders that made history, in the industry
I send my prayers to both of em, they livened up the rap game
Showed me how to maintain and watch over my chain
Still wear my vest from day to day, no it can't stop a AK
But run down on me with a handgun I might can stand one
But not too many
My reaction is to start blastin letting of 20
Hit anybody in the way of my trigger play
No kids though, I play the game how it go
I retaliate, but not like last funky 4
From '94 to '95 and '96
Momma prayed for her baby cause I stayed in war(raw) shit
Above the law shit, raw shit, nigga feel me
Been to prison for 2 years, still think a nigga wanna kill me
So I'm riding hot, I'd rather get caught with it than without it
If I could I'd make moves with momma cause she all the way 'bout it

[Hook 8x]

This one goes out to all the Magnolia, Calio, Melphamene
Ya understand, UTP, Ya understand ME
Cutthroat to the bone and nuttin else[Soulja Slim]
Yep, I need a top boss bitch in my factory, ya heard me, my boss bitch

They say dat we was of tha same kind & ain't lyin'
But at dat time I did shit to fuck ya like you was mine
Turn tha ghetto bitch boss & let her floss
It don't make dollars it don't make sense dat pussy cost
Break it off & when you get it brang it to me
Split it down tha middle, you get 2 I get 3
I wouldn't call it pimpin', they thank pimpin' played out
Still tha same cept Soulja Slim shit layed out
Put cha on your feet to keep ya neat, nigga speak
Not only dat she make a nigga wanna eat
Nigga tweak for a big booty & a smile
Might hurt me later on but don't hurt now
Sendin' good pussy on this mission to fuck this faker
Figure maker, perpatraitor, a soulja hater
Thank he boss cause he fuckin' my ghetto ho
But I'm off in his baby momma & tha nigga never know
An I'm slick side doggin' it at random
Met her at Bayou Classic, when Southern played Gramblin'
She was pushin' yo Expedition, tell me if I'm wrong?
Tha bitch tinted, grill fitted, sittin' on chrome
Followed me home in yo shit, tore tha pussy up
Bust a nut, left a soulja rag in tha truck
Remember dat, dat was me, actually
I did it on G-P for tha dog nigga up in me

[Hook 2X: Soulja Slim]
All hoes get layed, boss bitches get paid
I see somethin' in ya, we can blow up like tha world trade
Slang dat ass, make dat cash, brang it back to me
You be tha top boss bitch up in my factory

[Soulja Slim]
Now back to my ho I lie to, said I die for
My whole life I thank I cried enough
Still hype enough to keep my paper steady comin'
Heads up, where they at? I hear 'em drummin'
I'm hotter than tha gun dat killed Martin Luther King
That why tha fuck I can't floss on Narizen
Dat light green sticky sticky got my vision blurry
Head buried underground, feel like I smoked a pound
Shake down, give it up, drop it like it's hot
Me & tha Bossalinie close & open up shop
It's understood dat you ain't nothin' but my boss bitch
Double cross me get cha head knocked off bitch
To tha river ya go buck naked wit out no clothes
Bullet lodged to ya dome, bust open asshole
Disrespect tha code get ya self fucked over
Got cha pysched all tha way out there behind Soulja
I played them hoes, I'm a cold blooded ass nigga
I done it to ya girl, look here don't get mad nigga
I done dat bad nigga but fuck you know what's happ'n
I lay ya down, I'm a dog here besides rappin'

[Hook][Hook: Soulja Slim]
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me
Uhh I like it like that she working that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me
Uhh I like it like that she working that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me

[Verse 1: Soulja Slim]
I'm a dick thrower
Her neck and her back hurting
Cut throater, I'll have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jicky jerking
Slow down for me, you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm trying to grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and Ima make you get of me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
I'ts like I got the world in my palms
Your girl up under my arms, she fucked up from the charm
She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 till early in the morn
Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me I'm strong
If you going through your cycle I ain't with It I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby you know they was wrong
Na make it official wheres some of that dom
I don't mind buying to, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil Mama my shit together I ain't driving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'nolia get a chance with it
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Soulja Slim]
Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping that she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya ima see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'mma deal with ya

[Juvenile]
I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handfull
I know what's happening all I want is a sample
Who you with, I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on hoes, dawg the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me

[Hook x3][Soulja Slim]
Man I sure don't need them dick suckers fuckin' wit me right now brah
Man I'm muthafuckin' high right now man, shhh, fuckin' wit a nigga

[Hook: repeat 2X]
It's hard to maintain this soulja life mentality
If it be a tradgedy, dem white folks come & hassle me
Gon' slam me down & wrestle me, just to put on handcuffs
Then charge me wit resistance when they told me throw my hands up

[Soulja Slim]
Just cause I'm a black man, push a 2G Lac an
Mouth fulla golds an my neck & wrist frozen
They label me a drug lord supplyin' the 3rd Ward
When I only push some Ghetto D wit Master P & my Tank Doggs
Money in the bank dawg, dem haters don' like dat
Bitch this ain't the slave days, us niggas gon' fight back
You crackers can write dat all up in the magazines
Put me on a T-V screen & I'm gon' say the same things
You can call me racist, black man in this white world
I'm sick seein' sell out niggas married to these white girls
Knowin' they the enemy, can't never be no friend of me
I just get my dick sucked, nut in they mouth instantly
They ain't nothin' but freakshows, you feel dats what you need though
While you off at work or somethin' she fucked one of yo people
Now you want to kill somethin', pull of you an O.J
If you ain't got the dream team then you ain't winnin' yo case
I get all up in yo face & call you a straight house nigga
I know yo gon' press charges on me
Whip my pistol all up in yo mouth, nigga

[Hook]

[Soulja Slim]
Black man kill a black man, it's cool they lovin dat
Black man kill a white man & the sentencin' him to death
White man kill a black man then scream about selfdefense
Break it down to manslaughter wit all of the evidence
Ever since I been here, been nothin' but sin here
I done backed up out the game just to persue my career
So I'm gon' say this loud & clear, muthafuck the white man
Ku Klux Klan talk shit but they don't want start shit
Niggas today ignorant, especially my little generation
Squeeze triggers wit no hesitation for any kind little of altercation
Rappin' is my occupation but I'm still ride wit my pistol though
An drop the top on the low low so I an feel the wind blow
Pull up on side of white folks, smile show every gold I got
Smokin' on some sticky sticky but yall like to call it pot
Young black man callin' shots, middle finger to all the cops
Suck a nigga dick pullin' ya Glock out for a little traffic stop

[Hook]

It's hard to maintain this soulja life mentality
If it be a tradgedy

[Soulja Slim]
Yall know what they gonna do ya understand, these niggas out chea
Talkin' bout a nigga hatin' on them, what the fuck you talkin' bout a
Nigga hatin' on you bitch ass nigga, you know who hatin' on you
Tha D-A & the judge hatin' on yo bitch ass nigga, the police's & all
That type of shit nigga, fuck you talkin' bout a nigga hatin' on you
Behind a ho, a real nigga a bat the piss outcha scary ass
