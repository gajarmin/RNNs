[Hook]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Mike
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Makin' a story, makin' sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin it up, let's go

[Verse 2: Tak]
Who the hell is he anyway?
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' 'em star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin' raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin' for someone's help, to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

[Verse 3: Ryu]
This is twenty percent skill
Eighty percent fear
Be a hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, "Name Of The Game"
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
I like bleach man, why you have the stupidest verse?
This dude is the truth, now everybody givi'n him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin' with S. Dot!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ryu]
They call him Ryu The Sick
And he's spittin' fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
Been a fuckin' nihilist porcupine
He's a prick, he's a cock
The type woman want to be with, and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin', patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

[Verse 5: Tak]
Tak
He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep askin' him, "Was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?"
No, he's livin' proof, got him rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doin', give a hundred percent

[Verse 6: Mike Shinoda]
Forget Mike
Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

[Hook x2](Verse 1) [Takbir:]
Aiyyo, first things first
It's time to shake ground in the eighth round
Box battle and break down
For the beak in the rhyme tone
Jump in the cyclone
S-T-Y-L-E-S, yes I know
Give the rap phene vaccine
Packed red beam
Put 'em up, what the fuck
You plucked a bad seed
Off the wall, spittin' the guerilla tag team
What's up now, duck down stuff that can't breathe

[Ryu:]
Yo- you know the routine, the demon effect
Please, don't step, you wanna be one of my pet peeves
The more beef the better; sound gay
But you all wanna sleep together, okay?
In the club we don't sneak Berettas
Why not? We got so much street credit, the fuckin' police let us
Now that's bullshit, cause we don't pack heat
So come and get your head crackin' up at me

[Hook:]
Kick it- movin' it's on now
Making it punk loud
Shaking the buck wild
Rapin' the punk style
Fakin' the funk pal
Dunk watch the punk
What now? Watch your battleship get sunk down
Click (click) pow (pow) nine (nine) thou (thou)
What? Just what I thought, what's up now?
Click (click) pow (pow) nine (nine) thou (thou)
Hu-hu
I'm like Hu-hu-


(Verse 2) [Ryu:]
Hold it down, never give in
Styles ever get limbs
Or whether you want it to end
Dirty seringe, I murder 'em again
97 serving them sins
Uh 30 your friends get knocked out, turbulent wind
Hopped out, what you want, big verb in the gin
I'm a fish; you can tell by the flippers or fins
C'mon

[Takbir:]
Yo- I got a rock style
Pivot the offspring and joke with 'em
With a distorted gist off string
Who am i? Rushin' what leg? who and Tak?
Pushin' your bed hotter than Quebec in July
Area 51, stereo, rive gun live
Here we go, S-O-B drop some
For the kids in the hall with the new block tape
Blast from both angles like boom dock saint
So get up get up and let the sound hit ya
Snap it's already ya style picture


[Hook2:]

Kick it- movin' it's on now
Making it punk loud
Shaking the buck wild
Rapin' the punk style
Fakin' the funk pal
Dunk watch the punk
What now? Watch your battleship get sunk down
Click (click) pow (pow) nine (nine) thou (thou)
What? Just what I thought, what's up now?
Click (click) pow (pow) nine (nine) thou (thou)
Hu-hu
I'm like Hu-hu-

(Verse 3) [Tak:]
Who the hell wear splittin' the belly up on a selfish
Shinnin' in your style playin' the fell blitz
Drillin' your brain, like rap and video games
Feel the seringe for the styles that stickin' in your brain

[Ryu:]
Yo- what kind of shit is he on
Really is styles, really be on
C'mon punk fuck off; You really gotta be gone
Ripped out of your brain
Pissed covered in shit to diss this S-O-B game
Son of a bitch
I'mma start killin' for kicks
There ain't an air force 1 inn the globe I can't fit, get it?
I'm sick with it, when I spit the venom
And it drip's up in 'em
And it get's the women in a
Quick dilemma; We can settle it now
And I don't know who did it but they said it was styles

Click pow nine thou
What? Just what I thought, what's up now? (what's up now?)
Hu
I'm like Hu-hu-
Hu-
I'm like Hu-hu-
Hu-clickpow nine thou

I'm like hu[Hook]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

[Ryu]
I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like funny games, keep playing'em
I'm just saying, think back then, you was like one of the same
On the right track, but I was on the wrong train
Just like that, now you gotta face the pain
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play
And in your brain like a maze you can never escape the rain
Every damn day is the same shade of grey

[Mike]
Hey, I use to have a little bit of plan
Use to have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right out of my hand
Now I don't really even know who I am
Yo, what do I have to say, maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see but it's not gonna happen with me

[Hook]

[Mike]
Back then, I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But you proved to me unintentionally
That you would self destruct eventually
Now I'll be thinking like the mistake I made doesn't hurt
But it's not gonna work cause it's really much worse
Then I thought, I wished you were something you were not
And now this guilt is really all that I got

[Tak]
You turn your back and walk away in shame
All you got is a memory of pain
Nothing makes sense and you stare at the ground
And hear my voice in your head when no one else is around
So what do I have to say, maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see but it's not gonna happen to me

[Hook] x2

I'll do what I have to do
(You're on your own now believe me)
Whatever happens to you
(You're on your own now believe me)
What do I have to say
(You're on your own now believe me)
Is not gonna happen to me
(You're on your own now believe me)[Mike Shinoda]
Someone right now is leaving their apartment
Looking down at the street, and wondering where their car went
Someone in the car sitting at a signal
In front of a restaurant, staring through the window
At someone right now with their finger in their teeth
Who could use a little floss, right across the street
There's somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
Spent half the rent, at a bar getting plastered
Now he's gotta walk, 14 blocks
Just to work at a shop where he's about to get fired
Someone right now is looking pretty tired
Staring at a laptop trying to get inspired
Somebody living right across the street
She wrote the best things she's written all week
But her best friend's coughing up blood in the sink
He can't even think what happened, feeling so confused
That he knows it looks bad, but there's nothing he can do
I wonder what's it like being right there in his shoes
But..

[Hook] 1x (Mike Shinoda)
Yo, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom again
Tomorrow I will be gone
I don't know when I will be back
But in this world everything can change just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that

[Ryu]
Somebody right now is droppin' his vote
Inside a box, and trying not to get shot in his throat
For the act of freedom
Right now somebody stuck in Iraq, hoping that he gets shipped back breathing
In a war where he's not really sure of the reasons
So we show our support when the press mislead him
Though we mourn, remain proud and salute the troops
Get some, I know you boys got some work to do

[Tak]
Meanwhile, right now someone's 25 to life
And standing on the corner with their thumb up hitch hike
And scratching of a lotto ticket, hoping for a real winner
Sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner
Right now, someone wishes they were you and I
Instead of second guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
But right now, staring out the window at a fiend
With holes in his arms, and holes in his jeans
He pulled out a cigarette, and sparked a light
And walked right around the corner, just out of my sight, but..

[Hook] 2x (Ryu & Tak)
Yo, I'm just taking it in
From a second story hotel window again
TV's on, and my bags are packed
But in this world everything can change just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that

[Black Thought]
Right now, somebody is sitting in the darkness
Trying to figure out how to put some heat in their apartment
But they got a little mattress, a little carpet
And they appreciate it cause some people on a park bench
You see them when you rushing to get to the office
Wife fly by when she coming home from the market
Right now somebody's coming out the pocket
Trying to dump that rock, they run around the block with
Same time the cops is raising their Glocks
With aim to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
Right now somebody is struggling to stop this man
Who's kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors
Down the hall, the child taking his first breath
The doctors ain't even passed him to the nurse yet
Yeah, yo, I wonder if he understand what it's worth yet
Like time spent, while we're on the earth yea
The answer to the question we all seek
Can be found, it depends on how free ya'll think
Right now, it's somebody who ain't eat all week
That would kill for the shit you throw away in the street
I guess one man's trash is the next man's treasure
One man's pain is the next man's pleasure
One say infinity, the next say forever
Right now everybody gotta get it together, man

[Hook] (Black Thought)
Uh, I'm just taking it in
In an another strange hotel lobby again
Put my luggage on my back, I don't know where I'm at
I'm in the world where it all changes just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that

Yeah, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel, better again
Tomorrow I will be gone
I don't know when I will be back
But in this world everything can change just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that[Hook 2X - Mike Shinoda]
These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home

Verse 1 - Mike Shinoda
Standing on a bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath
Trying to make it home without freezing to death
And my Grandfather's face is stuck in my mind
And how seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time
I should've brought a jacket
Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill
I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
Thinking laying in that box people look so still
At times like these you start thinking
Your first breath in and the clock starts ticking
I'm not trying to bum anyone out
Not trying to be dramatic, just thinking out loud
I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind
Some defence from the cold that I'm feeling outside
And for a minute, escape with some rhythm and rhyme
And get away from the grey just a bit at a time

[Verse 2 - Ryu]
Yeah
Kind of funny how this world can treat you
Like a freak in a sideshow, a carnival creature
Climbing out of cans, I'm a diamond in the sand
But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones
My life's like trying to swallow a pine cone
It's tough when you live fast just to die slow
Talk to dial tones, my dreams are far fetched
It seems, so I sleep underneath this park bench
I know it don't make sense, and I don't expect for you to know what it's like
Smoke, drink, piss, sniffing everything in my site, push rocks in the pipe
Lift off, I keep puffing 'til my lips turn white, And my chest gets tight
But who the fuck really cares, when you're so far left that even death looks right
All I can do is hope for the best and pray
That it gets a little better than yesterday

[Hook 2X - Mike Shinoda]

[Verse 3 - Takbir]
Yo
Pardon me, I think I'm next to earl
Too many problems going on, that's why I left my girl
Pack my backs and I travel with a pen and my notepad
They said I was broke and things that I don't have
But still, I try to find a way to escape
From all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
But now I'm breaking the mold, See I was patient and calm
Many sleep in the rain, but now I'm awake in the storm
Written my life in the short film, the rise and the fall
How I managed to scorch hills and climb the wall
Pound pavement, Aimless in this cold existence
Even though things are changing, I'm going the distance
Overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
To put it all behind me cause life still goes on
Now I'm much stronger and know where I stand
While lost souls search over and over again

[Mike Shinoda]
These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everybody's trying not to cry
Trying to get by and trying not to feel outta control
And if you look hard enough, sometimes you'll find
A place that might just remind you of home
But if it doesn't feel like home, You can do what I do
Just pretend you don't feel so alone (so alone, so alone...)

(Scratching...)
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home[Kenna]
Ohh-ohhhhh, ohh-ohhhhh
Ohh-ohhhhh, ohh-ohhhhh
Ohh-ohhhhh

[Mike Shinoda]
I had a friend named Victor
The two of us used to hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight
That his whole life, just changed
I know when his mom and dad broke up
It didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk
And he gambled away the rent
Pretty soon Vic was seein red
Pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
Then he'd do it all again
The whole time
Smilin on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside
All he was tryin to do was get away

[Hook: Jonah + Kenna]
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping, through the craaaaaaaacks

[Tak]
Yo, funny how things change color
Then fade to another shade
When you had it made it was all good
But now look, just another day
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one-two-three; lights out
Which way to turn, can't get a grip
All alone in a big white house
Every day gets worse
And you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left
Now you suffer, should've thought of that one first
No family, no kids
Can accept what you did
Now you wanna run away
But you can't cause the past comes back again

[Ryu]
Slippin through the cracks
Sip a little Jack, go to bed half dead
What about rent? Why does every cent
Gotta be a bet, when's it gonna end?
Oh my God, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Out of debt, out of dodge
Out of breath, out of this big problem
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
In a better place in his brain
But the medication he takes makes him wasted
So sick he was gonna think
The good Lord would come take him
I'm shakin him - "Wake up, you son of a BITCH!"

[Hook 2X: Jonah + Kenna]
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping through the craaaaaaaacks!
Hiding himself away
Watchin all the memories fade
Away from red to blaaaaaaaack!

[Kenna]
Slipping through the craaaaaaaacks {*3X*}[Takbir]
Aiyyo, first things first
It's time to shake ground in the eighth round
Box battle and break down
For the beak in the rhyme tone
Jump in the cyclone
S-T-Y-L-E-S, yes I know
Give the rap fiend vaccine
Packed red beam
Put 'em up, what the fuck
You plucked a bad seed
Off the wall, spittin' the guerilla tag team
What's up now, duck down stuff that can't breathe

[Ryu]
Yo, you know the routine, the team in effect
Please, don't step, you wanna feed one of my pet peeves?
The more beef the better; sound gay
But you all wanna sleep together, ok
In the club we don't sneak berettas
Why not? We got so much street credit, the fuckin' police let us
Now that's bullshit, cause we don't pack heat
So come and get your head crackin' up at me

[Hook]
Kick it- movin' it's on now
Making it punk loud
Shaking the buck wild
Rapin' the punk style
Fakin' the funk pal
Duck watch the pump
What now? Watch your battleship get sunk down
Click (click) pow (pow) Nine (nine) Thou (thou)
What? Just what I thought, what's up now?
Huh! Huh! *Buck shots through the speaker* [- Inspectah Deck sample starts

Huh! Huh! *Buck shots through the speaker* [- Inspectah Deck sample starts
*stab-stab-stabbin' the track with both hands* [- Inspectah Deck sample ends

[Ryu]
Hold it down, never give in
Styles, sever your limbs
However you want it to end
Dirty syringe, I'm Murder Maginn
97 serving them sins
A third of your friends get knocked out, turbulent winds
Hopped out, what you want? Beer, bourbon or gin
I'm a fish; you can tell by the hundreds of fins
C'mon

[Takbir]
Yo- I got a rock style
Pivot The Offspring and joke with 'em
With a distorted guitar string
Who am I? Russian Roulette, Camu Tao
Pushin' a 'vette hotter than Quebec in July
Area 51, stereo, rive gun live
Here we go, S-O-B drop some
For the kids in the hall with the new block tape
Blast from both angles like Boondock Saints
So get up get up and let the sound hit ya
Snap, it's audio style picture

Who the hell wear splittin' the belly up on a shellfish
Shinnin' in your style playin' the fell blitz
Drillin' your brain, like rap and video games
Feel the syringe for the styles that stickin' in your brain

Yo- what kind of shit is he on
Really, his +Style's+ really +Beyond+
C'mon punk fuck off; You really gotta be gone
Ripped out of your brain
Pissed covered in shit to diss this S-O-B game
Son of a bitch
I'mma start killin' for kicks
There ain't an Air Force 1 in the globe I can't fit, get it?
I'm sick with it, when I spit the venom

*Buck shots through the speaker*

[Hook]Welcome...

[Ryu]
It's time unravel the plot
Unlock the safe
Searchlight, binocular spot
Commposite sketch phase
Tryin to apprehend the suspect
Beyond typical flow
Black and white cam, elevator
Surveillance photo
Freeze frame
Still shot that skill spot
Ryu in the post office
FBI's most ATF mascot
No charge penning for
Climbing the Kremlin wall
I'm the communist, monuments
On the conquest to crawl
Through the barbed wire fences
And motion censor detectors
Code within my sentence
That cracks foreign defenses
Mention my name to no one
Let's keep it top secret
Classify my digital mind
So you can peep it

[Tak]
It's a mystery unable to explain
But strange
How we connect from
Two complete diffe-rent sides of
The terrain (hah)
2000 Fold
Sean Connery code name
No mysterious chemistry overcame
So while the beat bangs
Everybody's doin' the same
Spittin out repetitious
Bull crap
That you thought wouldn't change

[Ryu]
Retracin' my tracks back to my birthplace
A hollogram, seein' things never there
In the first place
Chase my image like a figment
And fantasy, What you tellin' me?
Evertime I rhyme I chalk up another felony
The last action hero on the planet
Evidently, when they ask who's Tiger Chan
Act like you never met me

[Hook]
[Styles of Beyond]

This ain't your average everday rap song
We ain't the average group cause our 'styles beyond'
So, how we keep this chosen mystery unsolved
Nobody knows, 2000 (2000) Fold...x2

[Tak]
Ayo, 2000 fold, everybody's still searchin'
Lookin' for that voice that they never heard in person
Radio in-tennas and television screens
Attractin' this signal that's universally recieved
Styles of Beyond, the normal type of flow
The ones that discover the way to hype the show
With the uh ah (haha) Oh my god the real came back
Two of the most incredible ever on the same track

[Ryu]
Code red operation
That we're takin' back hip hop
Dead or alive behind enemy lines
Hear the pen drop
The album 2000 aftermath
Rock the Casbah
Wearin' a meat necklace
Two steps from hungry jaguars
Wreck a track faster than nascars
In black, snatchin' hip hop tonight
And you ain't takin' it back
Thought you had it stashed
Like a nine milli financial weapon
Now it's time for the S-O-B
And nine thousand is steppin'

[Tak]
Travelin' slowly through every channel
And laboratory samples
Now a national geographical panoramic anthem
Exposed as one of the seven gases
No evidence 'shown' but now the 'globe'
Is full of ashes
We just some auditory creatures
Creepin' out your speakers
Delinquents usually understand it's frequent
+The Mighty Bostone+ relatin the mor-se code
Exchangin the body suits of our clones
Yeah...

Welcome...

[Styles of Beyond]
Yo, you gotta mic
But your time won't last
Cause when we in the ring
Everything moves fast
And we takin' care of biz
In this hip hop show
If you in the front row
Then you might just know
So what's the crew? S-O-B
That's the click I'm from
Bottom line either get down
Or get done...ugh

[Tak]
Ayo, this just in, at five foot ten, mysterious african
Slight build, bottled with nice skills
Over by the ledge, breif case, twistin his dreds
Developin' a way to repel against the common asshole
All in the favor of the S-O-B
Get yo ass to the store, purchase the CD

[Ryu]
As we close the first chapter
In the book of mystery
All that's left is a three minute
And changed legacy
Subconciously stained styles on your memory
Releasin' all the primal first century
Tendencies on my enemies
Got you on candid camera
Through my gamma vision glasses
Starin' at drops quick as clocks tick
Time passes, tide rips
One wrecks the other destroys
Now the two deadliest warheads
Have been employed

[Hook...][Common]
Uhh, yeah, yo
We 'bout to take y'all to the tip, to the crib
Let's do it Mike (yeah)

[Hook: Mike Shinoda]
Back home (back home) everybody's searching for something
But all they can find's a whole lot of nothing
Back home (back home) ain't nobody hopin and prayin
Cause they feel like nothin can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact
That life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
Cause ain't a damn thing free back home (back home)

[Common]
Back home, they holla "disciple" and "blackstone"
Same block they freebase, yo we trapped on
Where our grandmothers marched, the guns clap on
There's liquor stores, beauty supplies and rap songs
I travel the world just to come back to it
The crib got a lot of soul like black music
I'm attached to it, in many ways this city raised me
And gave me the drama, honor and bravery
The streets seem hollow, when I go to Chicago
It's cheap wine and sorrow, times is hard to swallow
In search of God's tomorrow, I borrow
Words from the Bible, and use them for survival
Gangs rival, signs painted on walls like hiero-glyphics
I tell them that this is all tribal
Used to do dirt, shorty's goin through the same cycle
And trials like Michael, tryin not to stay idle - back home

[Hook]

[Ryu]
Back home, it's not Compton but close, the same problems exist
And the pain throbbin and folks are so common
It don't, really bother us much, we just swallow it
Uh, crack the bottle and smoke
Hope tomorrow somethin magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
But the chances of it actually happening's kinda slim
Back home, we get the good life at a glimpse
In the form of a rap star, drug dealers and pimps
I'm back, home

[Tak]
Back, home - I try my best to keep it together
It's cold, like the Windy City streets of December
I pace back and forth, lookin for the courage to shine
But can't tap the source, need somethin to nourish my mind
I know we all lose quite a bit in life, only to gain some
Life or the dark winding roads we came from
But I move with the night so I'm used to the shade
And never lose sight, bringin truth back to the game

[Mike Shinoda]
Back, home - we've got a lot of shit on our minds
We're always behind on somethin cause there's not enough time
And we're non-stop, bottom line, doin what we gotta do
To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
Back home there's people callin us hopeless
People tryin to tell us all we need is some focus
But, focus, focus is overrated
Cause you see every blemish and mistake and can't change it
Back home is Alvarado, K-Town and J-Town
Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know
Where figures shiver, livin right in the litter
Where kids write bigger, right inside the L.A. river
On the concrete, a symbol of our everyday way
It's that color and concentration over heavy and gray
And by the time the ink dries on this page
I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay (yeah)

[Hook]

[Outro: Common]
We takin it back home y'all
Yeah, it's Common Sense (yeah)
My guy Mike (what up Com'?)
S.O.B. (uh-huh) yeah
This time we rotate, it's good music (ha ha ha)
Hip-Hop (it don't stop) yeah, uhh
It's home for me baby, yeah[Hook]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

[Ryu]
I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like funny games, keep playing'em
I'm just saying, think back then, you was like one of the same
On the right track, but I was on the wrong train
Just like that, now you gotta face the pain
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play
And in your brain like a maze you can never escape the rain
Every damn day is the same shade of grey

[Mike]
Hey, I use to have a little bit of plan
Use to have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right out of my hand
Now I don't really even know who I am
Yo, what do I have to say, maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see but it's not gonna happen with me

[Hook]

[Mike]
Back then, I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But you proved to me unintentionally
That you would self destruct eventually
Now I'll be thinking like the mistake I made doesn't hurt
But it's not gonna work cause it's really much worse
Then I thought, I wished you were something you were not
And now this guilt is really all that I got

[Tak]
You turn your back and walk away in shame
All you got is a memory of pain
Nothing makes sense and you stare at the ground
And hear my voice in your head when no one else is around
So what do I have to say, maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see but it's not gonna happen to me

[Hook] x2

I'll do what I have to do
(You're on your own now believe me)
Whatever happens to you
(You're on your own now believe me)
What do I have to say
(You're on your own now believe me)
Is not gonna happen to me
(You're on your own now believe me)Yeah!
It’s Megadef
What you know about Cheapshot?!
What you know about Tak?!
What you know about Ryu, Faggot?!
What you know about Vin Scully?!

[Verse 1: Tak]
Another half-ass, hit out now
We used to chill, ‘til that motherfucker bit our style
It’s kinda funny how, You and your friends are small town
Act like you got something, big to draw down, silly
Probably confused, sobered up to shine
So when you rhyme, you sound like both of us combined
And don’t act like you don’t know
You in a crew, couldn’t hold it down solo
You full of poop so I’mma scoop the feces, put it in a Pamper (Uh)
Let it drag, any time you call out won’t answer
Punk, get a cab and a robbery
You a little kitten that shouldn’t have climbed a tree
Now you stuck with the truth ‘til we dig up the bones
I feel pregnant--birth to my musical clones
So for nine months, the pack rats watch them grow
With your backpack, clown, you sound sloppy though

[Hook]
Now I wanna...be your dog
Now I wanna...be your dog
Now I wanna...be your dog
Now I wanna...be your dog

[Verse 2: Ryu]
(Listen up, faggots)
Knock, knock come off the damn platinum
Stand back, drop the plaque, “Pop, pop!”
So cock the magnum, “Rock, rock”
Blow shots off at random, Ryu and Tak
And we don’t stop the anthem
Give my flow back
Lo-Jack, phone-tap, punk the Pink Panther
Give me a soul clap, “Click, clack!”
Rip that, snap necks quicker than Kit-Kats
Knick knack, patty wack pistol grip pump the jams up
Wild West SOB’ shit’s bonanza
Who the fuck wants it, spit guitar picks
Slit your neck with a Bic razor across it
Knock the bitch lead singer unconscious
No pets, so don’t step watch the dog shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tak]
Signed a bad deal, with a weak video
Maybe if I had skill I wouldn’t need serial
And we ain’t have to pay anybody for shit
Especially to play me, like I’m some kind of a bitch
And every other day people want to swallow and spit
Like a plunger, to sludge in abdominal kits
And the promoters with their fat heads
You and your chick friends (Uh)
You don’t even know what rap is--you tripping
Forty-seven groups on a ten minute marquee
Barely making sense spitting words at a Mach 3
Sorry as hell, hobby or thrill
Something that ain’t real, it’s obvious still
So for the hell of it we dropped another album
Shock Therapy Freaks, Artificial Intelligence
Run pop pills, get the metal and click
And reload if necessary, just to handle the kick--bitch
[Outro]
“Are you crazy...I got enough to worry about, getting back on the street...
Doris...I could fucking kill you!

I’m sorry!!!”[Verse 1 - Tak]
Yo, swing the sword for the classic year
Bring the noise with your hands up, slash and tear
You can't fathom asthma, dash for air
Spittin' on the baby bib in the plastic chair
What's up stupid?
(Shoot this)
1-5-1 in the shot glass
(Hot flash)
Bangin' on the drum, huh
We cause havoc down in Las Vegas
Paper trails racing, Pelican briefcases
We outrageous, name the streets gave us
Yeah, we got flame, but now we heat blazers

[Verse 2 - Ryu]
I let 'em all fly, ten in the clip, one in the chamber
Thumbs up, another banger
Untuck the flamer, dumbfuck
It's like gettin' with a dumptruck
Brains and guts
Maim, cut, aim, duck, same stuff
Get you cracked up like cocaine, heat 'em up
Okay, I'll let a sucka's fly once
Face down, found him in his Cap'n Crunch

[Verse 3 - Tak]
Uh, malpractice - a bang-off jam
I joust rappers and track in the radar scans
Flip beats for the crew like fleets and platoons
Reach for the moon like Reese Witherspoon, uh
Don't stop the sure-shot, the rooftop anthem
Blast the gold box, cock back the cannon
What's up partna, I got ya (what, what)
Hope that "rah-rah" crack the piñata
Slap, box, mouth of backwash
Teeth mashed up on the asphalt, ya dig?

[Verse 4 - Ryu]
Set the pace like a mustang, mashin'
Up the stakes, who wanna cut the cake, I take cash
Dropped on a blood-stained mattress
Stop, you ain't got access, watch
I'mma change my accent, Ryu and Tak
You little cunts in the game, you can suck my cock
And lay flat on the ground, don't make a peep
If you want the stains out now, get the bleach

[Hook]
Guess who's got the rubber gloves and the bleach?
Guess who's rockin every club, that's me
Get so hot, you feel the buzz in the streets
Keeping it knockin', Jay drop that beat
Guess who got the group name on top?
S.o.B. got the rap thing locked
Who want what, when, why, and what not
Who got next up, Ryu and Tak

[Verse 5 - Tak]
Yeah, here it comes, all you hear is a click
Bloody brains on the sand was like Miracle Whip
While the blood keeps gushin', relish and pink mustard, huh
I'mma slam till I tear it to bits
Till the bell for the recess rang
On the defense game
You feeling grilled like P.F. Changs
Hopscotch on the corpse till I drop the torch
And burn crews for their views that'll rock with force
Sayin, don't stop the sure-shot, the rooftop anthem
Blast the gold box, cock back the cannon
What's up y'all, we don't stall
Come one, come all till we drop the ball like

[Hook](apathy)
The almighty
Demigodz
Yo

Verse 1 (apathy)
Ever since the big bang
Before god had a name
Before the birth of earth
Or when the dinosaurs came
Way before cavemen were huntin prehistoric game
Or cleopatra pumped poison venom in her veins
Before the world changed when the romans reigned
Before jesus was slain and noah watched for rain
Cause I been waitin longer to drop my cd
Than people'll wait in line at the dmv

Verse 2 (celph titled)
Yo
Before the lord himself said let there be...
There was me celph titled
God emcee
No frequency to transmit
No hammers to grip
No flicks where they were killin kids on summer campin trips
Before you was cohereint
My flows spirit co-existed in pyramids
Temples of holy lyrics
Homey I'm serious
Before Jehovah thought of yall
I done payed dues
Blown the fuck up and fallen off
Come on

Chorus

Don't make me
Wait!
What will it
Take!
Let's get this
Straight!

Demigodz
Don't forget it or we gonna bring it!

Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Yea
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Come on
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Yea
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Bring it

Verse 3 (ryu)
Before tats and the booze
Two packs a day shit
In the lunch room battlin chumps in they faces
Ever since cassettes
I was fresh before the phrase
"so fresh"
For my age I needed a fucking agent
>From out the basement
I came when kane did
Before k-swiss was gay kicks for gay kids
I'm saying!
For the sake of being abrasive
I'll slit a ho's throat so the bitch can't say shit

Verse 4 (motive)
Way before my mom used to beat me with a switch
Suspended from school
For callin all my teachers a bitch
Before I used to rock lee's and the creases was thick
The only time I dressed up was on easter and shit
Basically I'm sayin i've been patiently waitin a long time
Before my pops even thought about knockin up my mom
Before so many fake dudes tried to rhyme
The guarded angels got they ass whooped for stoppin crimes
Yea!

Chorus

Verse 5 (tak)
Before I was even concieved and kickin the womb
Before I was able to breathe I was diggin ya tomb
Before I even had a style and the clips to fill it with
Before my brother bilal left a hook with the syndicate
I was waitin in the shack with everlast
Way before he had knack
Way before it was cool to wear leather pants
Before lickin a line up came look at my number
Def jeff and drop rhymes on ya

Verse 6 (apathy)
Feels like centuries
Or essentially
Longer than flava flav waited for the ent
Before o.j. got lucky and lost his fresh prince
Before they tried to switch up the aunts on fresh prince
Before napoleon began to strategize
Or way before McDonalds fucked up they apple pies
Before capone committed a single crime
Bottom line i've been waitin a long fucking time

Chorus[Hook]:
Don't be afraid to call my name {x4}
Step up, step up

[Verse One] [Ryu]:
Okay, the west back, yeah the proof is us
I got a rag on my head cause the roof is up
The R-Y-U, comin' with the stupid stuff
I got her foamin' at the mouth like a loofah sponge
I don't claim no set yet I'm a threat to riders
And I got a few tecs in the L.A. riots
Yeah I'm L.A.'s finest, serve and protect
The street from wack shit, I deserve respect
On the sneak tip, I came in the game to slay them
I had the world singin' 2K4 verbatim
Brave and dumb
818's favorite son
Disintegrate them like my tongue was a laser gun
Yeah yeah
Backpack rapper I guess
But I wear it in the front like a suicide vest
If hip hop is dead how do you define death?
Only way it ever died is if Tak and I left
So what a dude gotta do to prove his sickness?
In a world full of bougie dip shits
I cooly reach for the uzi, lift it
Click the tooly back and blow brains to a gooey liquid

[Hook]:
Don't be afraid to call my name

[Verse Two] [Tak]:
I started off, fresh off the head
Then I wrote songs and left y'all for dead
Now I got a plot, time to cook this omelet
And knock it out the box like the Brooklyn Dodgers
Hmmm
Do your dance, the beats are grizzly
I'm chewing through your camp like a piece of Wrigleys
Man for the fight, I'm destroying your name chump
Your man on the mic is more annoying than James Blunt (Beautiful)
So ring around the phoney
You're kicked in the lip with a brown Saucony
Upchuck your billy bang bang get off me
Please, your body looks like a scene from Saw 3
Ughh
Yeah, I'm whiskey sippin'
Risky business, killin' Dixie Chickens
Therapeutic sicks, have a disposition
A Garbage Pail Kid still in mint condition
Slow it down, they're holding me hostage
Cause when I go to town, man I'm totally awesome
Shots to my people in Galats so stand on by, back
Choppin' like I'm Afro Samurai

[Hook]:
Don't be afraid to call my name[Intro] [Mike Shinoda talking]
Gentlemen and ladies. Please put down your expensive champange
It's about to get ugly in here. (Yeah. Set it off motherfuckers!) Let's go!
My name is Mike Shinoda. And with some help from my man Celph Titled
(You goddamned right!)
I would like to introduce to you from Styles of Beyond: Takbir!

[Verse One] [Tak]
Yeah, I'm here, put a sock in your mouth
You now rockin' with Styles
That's how we knockin 'em down
No other option around
Cause I'm just cockin' and POW!
Me and my popular pals
Don't make me hop in the crowd, stop jockin' about
We taking over and stomping all of your sports spiders
Cover and duck, and we shootin' straight out of Fort Minor
Roll with a pack of fifty
So when they get they gettin' shifty
I put a stamp on it and slap 'em with a flask of whiskey
You got your holster blazin'
Buzzin' with no sedation
I got a (gun cocks) and a party cap for both occasions
With something terrible seepin' into your stadium
Never perform solo, I'm freakin' sick in the cranium
Packin' 'em in, yeah, the ruler gets back
We're quick to
Crackin' ya shins with aluminum bats
Got the place going bananas and they pumpin' they fists
I'm tilt my brim to Los Angeles and jump in the pit

[Mike Shinoda]
What the fuck are you doing, man? You spilled my Cristal all over me

[Hook] [Celph Titled]
So raw, so rugged, so rough
Like a runaway train we're tearing the track up
We're at it again, we're ready to act up
So cover and duck, show us you're rockin' with us
Let's see a fist if you're rockin' with this
Let me see your fist if you're rockin' with this

[Verse Two] [Mike Shinoda]
From the start 'til the end, night until the dawn
It's that fight music cause right when it comes on
You just lose control of your elbows and fists
Fuckin' other disregard for your body in the pit
People are swinging limbs, swinging bottles and chairs
Throwin' lime, backin' motherfuckers up in the air
So back up, we got you wearing that Fight Club glare
Steady, tearing down the club cause you just don't care
It's the realest way to feel it when the speakers pop poppin'
You with it if you get it when that beat starts knockin'
And we kill it when get up on that mic, start rockin'
And you feel it when you hear it cause we're on non stoppin'
So ask a buddy or a friend if they know, no
We do it daily, never maybe, every show, show
Y'all want to get down? I'm ready to roll
Right now, y'all ready? let's get it, let's go!

[Hook] [Celph Titled]
So raw, so rugged, so rough
Like a runaway train we're tearing the track up
We're at it again, we're ready to act up
So cover and duck, show us you're rockin' with us
Let's see a fist if you're rockin' with this
Let me see your fist if you're rockin' with this
Let's see a fist if you're rockin' with this
Let me see your fist if you're rockin' with this
Ryu!

[Verse Three] [Ryu]
Yo, so now they notice me, rockin' over Shinoda beats
Makin' it crack like the extract in coca leaves
Hopefully labels love it, if not then fuck 'em
I'm cuttin' the break cables, ain't stoppin' at nothing
My hype is comin', murder for the price of a muffin
You think twice with a steak knife stuck in your stomach
I'm like "Who ever wanted whistle? I'll let you bring a pistol"
I'll put a verse on both wings like a stinger missile
Provoking people to bring it, I keep the weapons stable
I'll blow a fucking hole through it like a western bagel
Yeah, I talk tough and I rap ignorant too
Sick of me kickin' knowledge, getting crap on my shoes
I'm off my rocker, a psycho stalker
The girl called me David Beckham, she thought I was going to sock her
Nah, I'm the one to get it crackin', the plan works
Before I rock a show you gotta fax in the fans first
Ready? Let's go!

[Hook] [Celph Titled]
So raw, so rugged, so rough
Like a runaway train we're tearing the track up
We're at it again, we're ready to act up
So cover and duck, show us you're rockin' with us
Let's see a fist if you're rocking with this
Let me see your fist if you're rocking with this
Come on, Celph Titled!

[Bridge] [Celph Titled]
If it ain't raw, it ain't right, so get it right
We at it again, now to act up and start a fight
So cover and duck cause we runnin' a muck
No, cover and duck cause we about to erupt
Throw your motherfuckin' hands to the sky, sky
And make a fist if you want to get live, live
Throw your motherfuckin' hands to the sky, sky
And make a fist if you want to get live, live

[Outro] [Celph Titled]
Come on y'all! Yeah! You like that shit?
We had to get real Godzilla on 'em this time
Tak and Ryu, S.O.B., Celph Titled. M. Shinoda the Cobra Holder, Demigodz
That's how my crew do, shut the fuck up when Fort Minor's talking![Intro]

[Verse 1: Tak]
Uh
Listen
Come here for a minute, let me borrow your ear
I was just a little kid, I heard it perfectly clear
Got a chip planted on my neck when I was six
And ever since, Ive been tripping off this music itch
I couldn't sleep, television screen kept me awake
My brothers 808 booming in a room full of crates
I couldn't wait (wait)
Plus I was late for the school bus
Rhyming in the mirror with my spider-man tooth brush
Divine and Everlast in the back of the hut
I'm talking '89 and I'm still packing a lunch
Sounds crazy, but will he seem to happen as such
Whoever thought that I would do it with this passion and gut
I don't know but it hit me
All of a sudden I got the globe rocking wit' me
Now we clubbing and all the girls wanna kiss me
Says she loves it, but she's really not listening
... Damn whats up with that?

[Hook: Michael Buble]
I'm feeling good as hell tonight
That bands a playin' outta sight
Me and the boys we got it right
And everybody sayin'
Damn!
Just a night out on the town
Nothing else can get me down
Bartender pour another round
Till everybody sayin'
Damn!

[Verse 2: Ryu]
To all the people down since the beginning
Yo, we never wore the crown, you insisted we get it
Bought the record everyday, never trip what it costed
All you wanted was to put some more chips in my pocket
Way before the world tour and overseas and big stuff
When 'Cheapshot' was still spinnin' valley bar mitzvahs
You always had a seat rollin' right there with us
In the car drinkin' 40s out in front of them shit clubs
You remember then, twenty-five fans would line up
But nobody gave a fat frog's ass who I was
Times up, nine months later put the smack down
Sign to Machine Shop, Warner got my back now
Funny how they all flipped up when they see me
"Yeah he think he doing big shit cos he on TV"
Yeah, but that was all planned like it or not man
You hatin' from the couch going
Goooooddd
Damn!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ryu]
You want to play the role?
(Yes)
Like you ain't a ho?
(Yes)
But you probably heard the single on the radio
Now it's all love
(Yes)
Got a strong buzz
(Yes)
But she didn't know my name thirty days ago
Oh you heard of us?
(Yes)
Let me hear you say
(Yes)
Roll em up, I was tellin' you in '98
But that was all planned, now its a logjam
With haters in the place shouting
Goooood
Damn!

[Hook][Hook] [Apathy]:
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down get down
Now
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider

[Verse One] [Ryu]:
They told me dumb it down
The song is too underground
They wanted some other style
Or something with southern bounce
But this is southern Cal, sucker we rocking L.A
So we don't 'Walk It Out' unless you get shot in the leg
I tried to keep it simple and maybe create a dance
I need a single and I gotta repay the advance
So get stupider, pockets are getting poofier
Shooting up the chart and won't stop when it hits Jupiter
Damn, if you don't want your band's stock to plummet
You need a hook so catchy your dog spot can hum it
So understand it's a game, but you gotta get paid
So if life is handing me lemons I'mma make a meringue
I let it rain
Hot Chicken Noodle Soup in your seeds
Make you chew on some Laffy Taffy till you ruin your teeth
Any musical feat's possible if you want a hit
Just grab an 808 kit and dumb it down a little bit

[Hook] [Apathy]:
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down get down
Now
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider

[Verse Two] [Ryu]:
Yeah, I dumb it down but I'm sticking to the truth
And I don't mean no soda with no Chicken Noodle Soup
See people are a medium, marshmallowed up
Listen to the stereo inside a small yellow bus
And now they going mad with some crazy type of
Trend where grown men rap in baby diapers
And I could care less who distributes the coke now
I got more respect for all the members in O-Town
You dig it?
Cause now the streets can tell
So stop picking all your lyrics out your Speak N Spell
Now you in the top 10 but who writes it sucks?
Try picking up a pen in your life for once
But what?
It's too hot, puffing kush in the Rover
He should be on the block getting pushed in a stroller
Looks like they need a hit for the year so here's one
Just a little something for the preschool eardrums

[Hook] [Apathy]:
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down get down
Now
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider

I dumb it down for ya
I dumb it down
I dumb it down for ya
I dumb it down
I dumb it down for ya
I dumb it down
I dumb it down for ya
I dumb it down

Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider

[Hook] [Apathy]:
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down get down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down

I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down get down

"Get stupid"[Intro]:
[Man]:Lasagna
[Woman]: What's up?
[M]: Why you gotta tell Sophie D everything about us?
[W]: Because, I just needed somebody to talk to
[M]: But you tryin' to make it seem like I started it dummy
[W]: I just told the story the way it went
[M]: Lasagna
[W]: What?!
[M]: Look, since you seem to be forgettin', I'mma tell you how it started from the beginning
[W]: Whatever

[Verse One] [Ryu]:
Cruisin' down the ave with my homeboy Tak
Sippin' on a tall can, layin' low from the cops
The greatest man alive is cold rollin' my G
Down Reseda like a G when I saw this fresh fly freak
Hold up, I can't go out like a bitch
Ayo, I had to conjure up a cool way to spit
They call me Ryu
The overlord of pimps
So put away the sidekick bitch, hop in the backseat
My confidence
Came through in the clutch
She started to blush
And right then I knew I could fuck
Called the next morning and said, "What do it be?"
I'mma go and get drunk with Vin Skully and Cheap
She said, "Peace"
So I went and got the slimmy
And as soon as she walked in the door she ordered Henny
I was like, "Cool", I ain't payin' so forget it
Better hope that the Scotland Yard accepts debit
But after a couple hours gettin' drunk with my friends
She did the dummy move
Started askin' for my dividends

[Verse Two] [Tak]:
Yo
Come around the corner lookin' funky fresh
This dude Jack Daniels got my mind in a mess
Straight trippin'
Cause I don't like Miller Lite
I kindly threw it to the side and said, "Yo, take a hike."
Cause I don't need to hurl
Too many problems when you hurl
I boo boo on your head with your jheri curl
They gave me Heineken and Michelob, I said "No way
Yo son, what do you think this is Sober Man's Day?"
People start buggin' off the beer on tap dummy
You know the time, so don't get funny with my money
I refuse to abuse my cravings and loans
So I hit up my friends, snatch my roller blades and I'm gone
Now I said it once before and I'mma say it again
Best believe I won't be spendin' no dividends

[Interlude]:
[Man]: Lasagna. Um, don't you think it's about time you go get me some money?
[Woman]: What?! When I was with Apathy I had it all. Mood rings, squirrel furs, Lane Bryant...milk. I thought the Demigodz were different. You ain't givin' me nothin'!

[Verse Three] [Apathy]:
It's a shame now a days you got to stay paid
It ain't like back in the day when you could get laid
Just chillin' with a bitch even when her mom's home
In the bedroom, secretly gettin' some dome
But this MySpace generation, got 'em all confident
Instead of one, they gettin' 10,000 compliments
It's bound to kill you when you read what they write
Got 'em thinkin' that they're models on this fuckin' website
Every trendy new style, she always gotta rock it
Like a pimp, even extract the lint from your pocket
And when you try to fuck all her friends cock block it
You really want to pop it but her girlfriends spot it
Material hoes, parents probably bought her a Benz
Never driven, given a million dividends

[Outro]:
[Woman]: Why you lookin' at me like that?
[Man]: How you know I'm lookin' at you unless you lookin' at me? Fix your face bitch
[W]: Ughh!
[M]: Ughh is right. Whoever smelt it dealt it
[W]: Fuck you
[M]: You better light a vanilla candle. You no drink buyin', .39 cent taco eatin', 200 pound strip aerobic teachin', XXL rasta Bart Simpson shirt rockin', no cat box cleanin' skeezer
[W]: Oh no you didn't you House Of Pain impersonatin', cubic zirconian, Machine Shop wearin', Pabst Blue Ribbon drinkin', can't hold a job cause you smoke to much cigarettes, deadbeat motherfucker
[M]: Yeah, aiight
[W]: Oh yeah and your momma got two wings on her left nipple
[M]: So...is cake on the Atkins Diet? I didn't think so. I'm out[Takbir]
It was 11:33, just wakin up to write
Got plans to meet my man at the jam tonight
Got a call from Tiger Chan, he said, "Whassup Tak'?"
Yo my car broke down, meet me at the bus stop
"What time?" About five, I'll be ready when I'm done
4:22, turn twenty-one, so you know
Threw on my shades to block the rays from the sun
I stepped out the door and now my day's begun
So I'm walkin down the block, think about that girl Britney
Knowin that I'm goin to the club to get tipsy
If I step out of line, would she soon forget me
I don't know - I'm Dazed and Confused like a hippie
Waitin on the corner for the four-door Honda
Picked me up, with the switch seat recliner
Yo I hear the horn blowin from these girls behind us
I turned around to look and they got all obnoxious
They recognize the face, "Can we get your autograph?"
Yo I turned back to Ryu and we started to laugh
"We got a show to do tonight," that's what I yelled out the window
They pulled up on the side, with a pen and pad for info
One had pretty eyes, with the buttermilk complexion
So I ran it down the line with the directions, yo..

Everytime we got a jam to make
We make sure the beat knocks, we dig up in the crate
Once the vibe is straight, we packin the place
It's the S.O.B., put the needle on the plate
(What what what what?)
Put the needle on the plate
(uhh.. uhh..)
Put the needle on the plate
(yeah UH)

"Wait back it up, hup, easy back it up" -] Q-Tip (repeat 3X)

[Ryu]
Steppin out in style, three dimensional light beams
Knight Queens and Club Kings swingin hype cling
Trippin over bottles of Moet on my way to the dancefloor
Pan-thers, freakin my folklore
My bloody roar buddy deplore cunning game to transform
And trap a dame flat in nine seconds we take aim
Change to battle beast, that'll cease, any attempt
In petty offensive diss to my click
We move quick, you might not even recognize my presence
Thirty second assassination sedation weapons
Step into the club, all these thugs wanna shoot me
Because I'm well known at the spot, they call me roofies
Hittin hard rocks when I travel through veins
And wake up in three days not remeberin thangs
The reign of the poetry prince of darkness the martian
Stompin, from California to Boston, Lost in Space
So take caution, face the facts, harken
Eagle talon attack, pack it up often
Audio abortion, distortion offense
Corporate, decaptitated three-headed horsemen
Shredded portions of serial murder endorsement
Course across clubs and fold my armed forces

Everytime we got a jam to make
We make sure the beat knocks, we dig up in the crate
Once the vibe is straight, we packin the place
It's the S.O.B., put the needle on the plate
(What what what what?)
Put the needle on the plate
(uhh.. uhh..)
Put the needle on the plate
(yeah UH)

"Wait back it up, hup, easy back it up" -] {cut and scratched}[Hook 2X - Mike Shinoda]
These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home

Verse 1 - Mike Shinoda
Standing on a bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath
Trying to make it home without freezing to death
And my Grandfather's face is stuck in my mind
And how seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time
I should've brought a jacket
Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill
I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
Thinking laying in that box people look so still
At times like these you start thinking
Your first breath in and the clock starts ticking
I'm not trying to bum anyone out
Not trying to be dramatic, just thinking out loud
I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind
Some defence from the cold that I'm feeling outside
And for a minute, escape with some rhythm and rhyme
And get away from the grey just a bit at a time

[Verse 2 - Ryu]
Yeah
Kind of funny how this world can treat you
Like a freak in a sideshow, a carnival creature
Climbing out of cans, I'm a diamond in the sand
But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones
My life's like trying to swallow a pine cone
It's tough when you live fast just to die slow
Talk to dial tones, my dreams are far fetched
It seems, so I sleep underneath this park bench
I know it don't make sense, and I don't expect for you to know what it's like
Smoke, drink, piss, sniffing everything in my site, push rocks in the pipe
Lift off, I keep puffing 'til my lips turn white, And my chest gets tight
But who the fuck really cares, when you're so far left that even death looks right
All I can do is hope for the best and pray
That it gets a little better than yesterday

[Hook 2X - Mike Shinoda]

[Verse 3 - Takbir]
Yo
Pardon me, I think I'm next to earl
Too many problems going on, that's why I left my girl
Pack my backs and I travel with a pen and my notepad
They said I was broke and things that I don't have
But still, I try to find a way to escape
From all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
But now I'm breaking the mold, See I was patient and calm
Many sleep in the rain, but now I'm awake in the storm
Written my life in the short film, the rise and the fall
How I managed to scorch hills and climb the wall
Pound pavement, Aimless in this cold existence
Even though things are changing, I'm going the distance
Overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
To put it all behind me cause life still goes on
Now I'm much stronger and know where I stand
While lost souls search over and over again

[Mike Shinoda]
These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everybody's trying not to cry
Trying to get by and trying not to feel outta control
And if you look hard enough, sometimes you'll find
A place that might just remind you of home
But if it doesn't feel like home, You can do what I do
Just pretend you don't feel so alone (so alone, so alone...)

(Scratching...)
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home[Intro] x4
Here they come ya'll, here they come

[Tak]
What if it is about?
Polluted Harlequins
The partying begins
Joining Carnival of Sins
Gats and Party Hats
Rumbling paint wars
I'm troubled like
Tom Comet juggling chainsaws
My unicycle is tight
You toucan fruits
Get to beating water pipes like the Blue Man group
So from the Black Phantom of rap to calling me crazy
The best traveling next to Barnum and Baileys

[Ryu]
Yeah I'm kind of a baby I'm always sucking a bottle or something
Staggering drunk couldn't find my way home with a compass
I gotta bunch of brain cells I kill with Tequila
A Manischewitz, they was all singing "Hava Nagila"
With every song I was losing a dozen
Need a new brain from two days of boozing in Dublin
I ain't using them fuck it
So if the music is pumping
I be sipping stuff that's ain't made for human consumption

[Hook] x2
So join the carnival
Where freaks crawl around
We the talk of town
So what's it all about
Gats and Party Hats
Gats and Party Hats
Gats and Party Hats
So where the party at?

[Ryu]
It ain't my birthday no, but it might as well be
Cause I be knocking them back like frats on hell week
You heard us popping them gats, its loud but you hardly notice
Around hear we call them Mach Ten party blower
I probably roll up with a couple of hearts
Drink 'til I barf, forget to pay the tab at the bar
Catch a cab, drink another twelve pack in the car
Getting trashed way before the party even will starts

[Tak]
Yeah now let's get back to the pit
We're Sadomasochist as shit
Watch a human body contort like a zag with a twist
The only motto is war, get them all to follow along
You sorry Ronald McDonald's will probably swallow your sword
I've been locked in a jeep, punching the back to get bill
With a evil opposite twin sparring and standing on stilts
I must be out of my melon to be involved with a freak show
But I've stuck with it this long for all of my people saying

[Hook] x2
So join the carnival
Where freaks crawl around
We the talk of town
So what's it all about
Gats and Party Hats
Gats and Party Hats
Gats and Party Hats
So where the party at?

[Tak]
I got 'em up and going y'all
For causing a scene
Like I'm the puppeteer controlling
The ho with a string
You little homies are rolling
Going with us so move
And those who roll with your homies
Party and blow a kazoo

[Ryu]
Yeah, you get the keg wrapped
Cupped with a few hats
I got the clowns in the house
Making balloon gats
Get your face painted
Came faded full of OE
Got the break lighter piece
Spray painted by police

[Intro] x4
Here they come ya'll, here they come

He's about to be a problem!

[Hook]
So let's get right to it and groove
Ain't nothin' but a thing to getcha people to move
Gotta lovin' the way we swing when we step on the scene
You know we kill it, goin' all out, we about to get it

[Ryu]
Yo, it's in my blood, I was born to spit it
The cordless kept me warm through the storms of winter
Ignored the pain and struggle when it's time for dinner
We huddle together and grind, rain or shine
Survive the weather, forget about changing spinners
Throw me a bone, I'm just tryin' to raise my litter
It made me bitter, eventually made me sicker
So when the heat's on we don't get pre-game jitters, uh-uh
We go to work man, dick in the dirt, we took 'em to church
We're checkin' in some teenage strippers
Livin' life by the seat of my pants and threepeated, we champs
Undefeated we can't lose ever whoever wanted with us
Better roll with a camp you trust to cover your ass when your asses can't
Huh, so bottom's up, here's one for the crew
Put some liquor in your gut and tell me what you wanna do, sing it

[Hook]
S, for every sucker left behind
O, what they were yellin' when I bust a rhyme
B, best believe when it's time to get it
We grind and jet cause we ain't got time to kick it
No
S, for the drunk sexy women
O, sippin' Jack with some Pepsi in it
B, best believe when it's time to get it
We grind and jet cause we ain't got time to kick it

So let's get right to it and groove
Ain't nothin' but a thing to getcha people to move
Gotta lovin' the way we swing when we step on the scene
You know we kill it, goin' all out, we about to get it

[Tak]
Wow, look at 'em now, their mouths are closed
We done came a long way since 2000 Fold
Spilled "Bleach", got the whole entire crowd exposed
The fumes leakin' in the street, throwin' down them bones
Whoa, we on the job, the one with the mob
The fake facades to get it just to make new large
I roll a seven to nine just to break the odds
And step in your mind and unfold the great bizarre
Hit the kill switch, yeah, found my Hitch
I'm on the pitcher's mound for now, it's me and Will Smith
Finally overseas, I sneak in the mattress
Ain't nothin' like a sweet club freak with an accent
We out gettin' bent makin' dollar amounts
So if you with me let me see you raise your bottom with shots, say it

[Hook/Outro]
S, for every sucker left behind
O, what they were yellin' when I bust a rhyme
B, best believe when it's time to get it
We grind and jet cause we ain't got time to kick it
No

O, sippin' Jack with some Pepsi in it

[Apathy]
Champion hoods that I rock, new Nikes out the box
Will attract your little chick then lock it down
All the Demigodz shit sound
Hardcore
Reloadin' my .44 like "click"
Box cutter slicin' open your six pack
Demigodz attack, motherfucker better start fallin' back
Aight
Cause I'm the king of Nike flights
I got more boxes stacked then a warehouse
Two pairs, one on ice
I won't even wear out
Go head and talk greezy and you'll find yourself Aired out
I box with the force that can knock grizzly bears out
Prepare for warfare, fuck fightin' fair ones
Feels like I shot you in the face with a flare gun
The heat when I speak and the temperature of my tongue
Will make you swear to god that I'm the emperor of the sun
A next level hustler that shouldn't be slept upon
Fuck crack!
I sell Energon to Deceptions
Swamp H, have Megatron on methadone
Apathy is a god in the rap upper echelon
Assassination theme music, raps to die to
Cock back and blast before I pass to Ryu

[Ryu]
I be that insane cracker from the D.G.Z.s
I need liquor and two packs of G.P.C.s
Now that's sicker
Rats if you don't like it then fuck you
My clans deep, steppin' out my jeep in my truck jewels
(Beep beep)
The killin' is a part of my job
Ayo RZA, good lookin' on that sixteen god
You gotta figure I'm the cream of the crop
The demon in Pac
I leave 'em butt naked, make 'em eat the beam of the Glock
You wanna see the M.P. pop?
Give me a reason, guarantee that after beefin' with me they turn vegan
What the fuck you gonna do? Come and see Ryu
I'm like a sniper
Sittin' on Machine Shop's roof
S.O.B. style
Demigodz hold me down
So keep my fuckin' name out your mouth

[Motive]
I leave the mics in body bags
With the same effect tsunami's have
And uplift the rep that Gotti had
And I'm the reason why your seeds is probably mad
Cause they caught me squeezin' my thing up in they mommy's ass
It's Motive bitch
And yes I'm the bad man
I spit so sick, they say I need a cat scan
A Demigod assassin by cash fam
Kilo mode but still grind up bad grams
The Doe Raker that's well known so tell home
I'm more to sea with my chrome more than cell phones
And I ain't here to teach no kids, I'm just rhymin'
I have you son wildin' like them kids in Blood Diamond
Fuckin' with Mo clutchin' the heat, flippin' cane
I keep the streets full of snow like a blizzard came

[Esoteric]
Slammin' a hype as verse till your bones snap
I ransack dead in the track and domes crack
Rap assassin, blastin', y'all should fasten seat belts
You crab ass rappers I'm rebuilt
I'm hot
Top notch, man fuck the pot shots
We got a leg up on the competition like hopscotch
I'm nice
I'm sayin' it twice
I repeat like a pen
I breed another eight MCs approachin' me
I disrespect, slash your neck, cash your check
It's how I bought my fat ass Lex
So clear the way
It's Shay, dawg open the gate
Peace, I'm out
Jettin' like I'm dealin' out of state

[Emilio Lopez]
You're gettin' stripped for your spot of your game
You can't stop me, you can only try to contain
I'm outta your range
That white widow got me thinkin' I'm on top a blade
No deal so I still keep stockin' the cane
I only recognize your girl from the top of her brain
She loves the taste so much she even swallows the stains
Don't be surprised if you fuck her and she callin' my name
My flow is insane, I'm headed to the hall of the fame
I'm chargin' the game for all the long studio nights
Time is money I need back a billion tonight
Stay up in booths threatening rappers and killin' the mics
I love goin' overseas but I ain't feelin' the flights
So I'm tryin' to get a private jet
Demigodz, we the livest set since hi-fi cassettes
Ain't a damn thing change boy
+Protect Ya Neck+
I'll have ? swingin' at where you head connect

Are you a warrior? Killer?
Slicin' shit like a kamikaze ninja
Go where I've been and you'll find bodies injured
Call the ambulance, the A.T.F., the Ghost Busters
This is fast food, your last meal is a slow supper
I'm Dan Aykroyd, Sigmund Freud
Bill Murray, that spit dirty at your derby make you act 'noid
You only half boy, half child
Boom, bang BLOAW!
Demigodz be like, "All in together now"
I get funky fresh
Watch me boil and flambe
Turn your favorite rapper to ham glaze
(Hey!)
Uncle Ben fucked Betty Crocker but it get's worse
I fucked Mrs. Butterworth on a covered perch and kicked a gutter verse
For every hardcore consequir
Studio got mushroom stacks we got bombs galore
Celph Titled the grand daddy grenade man
Sellin' all my bottled up anger at lemonade stands

[Tak]
My clan is thick like plaster
Bust ya
Blast ya
Kill 'em in their tracks like a buff black gorilla
Styles pumped off of skrilla
Feel us
You'll lose your ? cause they gave us a banger from Dilla
I came down with fat gats, then unload and lick a shot
I blow the backs of city cops like bloaw
Now it's all over
Punks seein' pink hearts, eatin' schrooms through a straw with King Cobra

"Here we go"
Here we go, same shit, different hoes
Stay sick, aim click, bang you don't hear me tho'
"Here we go"
Change clothes, watch how the chain glow
Rocks that'll mock every color in the rainbow
"Here we go"
Range Rov, dippin' to the stage show
Trippin' over bitches sippin' Guinness by the case load
"Here we go"
Tits like she's smugglin' mangos
Thick ass trick with a trunk like a Dodge Durango
Oh
We got it sewed up, the block, leave it tore up
You know us, we corrupt, but so what? Fuck it
I'm Tiger Chan, think I give a damn?
Nah, you buggin'
But 20 grand get your man touched, stuck in the oven
I'm runnin' this rap shit ragged
You faggots are finished
The baddest ass rappers around, deceased or livin'
I keep pimpin', keep spittin' until they learn to like me
If not man, I could care less, this world can bite me
So
"Here we go"
Here we go
Take it to the radio
Slip a couple dollars in they pockets so they play it though
"Here we go"
Yeah yeah, my man is comin'
So stop playin', please try to understand it's nothin' you know
"Here we go"
Really though, let me see them arms up
Buggin' like you on stuff
Styles Of Beyond, what?
"Here we go"
I think that's what I'm callin' this song
So look alive, when you hear the hook, follow along
C'mon

[Verse Two] [Tak]:
I'm really sittin' pretty on this escalator ridin' up
Till I burn the city, what a pity for the fire truck
Fellas seem to think we up and vanish in the mist
Nope, now we back, S.O.S., Panic At The Disco
Jeah
Open up the curtain, now I'm in the scene
Fly baby and I don't need no Red Bull to give me wings
Ever since I had the dream, floatin' above me
I've been followin' my success as a token of study
So now
"Here we go"
Killer rap, locks in the fitted cap
Killin' you chinchillas, no one's iller, split 'em with an axe
"Here we go"
Aiight then
Can I get some light, damn?
Put your hands together for the Fort Minor hype man
No money
On the road, sippin' Jack before the show
Never know which way these little tricky dice are gonna roll
"Here we go"
Here we go
Get it while you can bruh
Grand finale out the valley, smilin' for the camera

[Ryu]:
I'm reppin' the Demiz
These checks are as heavy as trucks with hemis
You punks better pitch in your pennies
I'm fixin' to kill it so picture the illest and here it go
Take my face, copy and paste then super impose
I'm faded 'em quickly mane, cause when the .50 flames
I make a G spin around quicker than 50's chain
You dis me, bang, you bitches get a crispy brain
You better act like you know my name

[Tak]:
"Here we go"
Here we go
Take it to the radio
Slip a couple dollars in they pockets so they play it though
"Here we go"
Yeah yeah, my man is comin'
So stop playin', please try to understand it's nothin' you know
"Here we go"
Really though, let me see them arms up
Pumpin' like you want stuff
Styles Of Beyond, what?
"Here we go"
I think that's what I'm callin' this song
So look alive, when you hear the hook, follow along
C'mon[Ryu]
Chasin me - follow a visual mist
Imprint's a tiger fist, fly swift, attackin Kodak
So get your camera ready if you plan to catch a 'hollo-
-grammar' dope lyrical nut so suck and swallow
Borrow, a pencil and a sack of common sense
So you can take notes on how to flow dope and represent
Occupants in my space, bring it on, try to harm me
I grab a gun and start to unload like Finnish laundry
(BLAOW! BLAOW!) Terminology rips, like full clips through {bullshit}
Funk flips off the tongue, Ryu's on some pool {shit}
Bellyflops and whatnot, low audio sonar
Tractor beams pullin all dreams into the polar
Symetic solar systematically scramble thoughts
Like eggs on Sunday morning, OJ and acid drops *drip drip drip*
Randomly rippin spots, spittin dope like freebasin
Like an open invitation to come and kick it with Satan yo

[Takbir]
I'll rip the mask off the body - settin it off, commencin surgery
Perjury's a crime, and now you must, pay the penalty
I inject a deadly poison that sucks calcium out your teeth
Dryin out your bones, killin the fake - identity

[Spaceboy Boogie X]
I, come! out of my shell, breaks loose the truth
Exploiting chemical reaction making contact with the youth
You are now left in front of a million sides claimin the truth
Choose your destiny but beware being guided by the fools
Youth will be dropped in front of you, many of you got shook
Two-timed topped for Tommy Hil', gettin played by Captain Hook
Look behind the books, and see the red eyes of demon
Like semen travellin lost, searchin for the egg
Givin birth to an indentity, no heart and no brain
Travellin through a maze but never passed the third grade
Rolled the dice get a seven, now you move to next phase
Pressure's gettin kinda thick as you fall, into a fade
Breakin out in sweat, but the water evaporates
Rubbin your eyes not believin, what I demonstrate
Visual effects as well as comprehensional soundwaves
Blinded by the fact that you are now official contract slaves
Seein the light, you may be able to escape the grave
But the dice are in your hand, I be that invisible man
Holdin back the Guardian Angel that's tryin to help you stand
As you collapse you roll a two, that sends you two steps back
Blood drips out the guillotine as mental slaves are whacked
The last words you ever hear would be the knowledge that you lack..
(knowledge that you lack..)

Yo, tap the bottle twist the cap, drink it down to the Main Source
So watch how many people "Fake the Funk"
Categorized in the majority of punks who can't avoid
The false bash you get trapped in a slump
A fool's paradise, rockin mics, livin large
Cruisin through illusions, now peep the mirage
Imaginin the plaque the made of platinum when he's rappin
But he don't know the facts in the game, now what happened
Identify the master of fraud, the unknown confess
Hittin holograms shown watch the mirror reflect
The Style of Beyond seal of official respect
The one.. two.. mic.. check..
The rhythm black hole, grapplin the souls of artificial
Flows that decompose, cause it ain't really real
Reveal what's concealed, pop balloon headed egoes
Syringe deflates the mindstate below zero
Scales gettin tipped with overweight hot {shit}
Invisible em-bl-em shinin bright from my wrath
So open up the door and feel the blast
Cause too many rhyme, too many slide, too many pass..
