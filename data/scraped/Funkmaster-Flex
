[Intro: French Montana]
Give a fuck about yo feelings (x3)

[Hook: French Montana]
Give a fuck about yo feelings (x4)
Who gives a fuck? (x3)
Give a fuck about yo feelings
Who gives a fuck?

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
All of them niggas complaining
Tell from the second I came in
I done been through mo' shit
Po shit to the top, now I’m faded
I don’t give a fuck where a nigga been, where a nigga going
Or what kind of shit he been through (yay)
Watch niggas ball, shit I couldn’t score
I done sat up on the bench too
Now a nigga fly by (by), fly jumping out the drive right (right)
Haters see me when I hop out (what?)
When a nigga did his state bid
Was the only time I copped out (copped out, yay)
(I’m askin' God questions, what we fighting for?)
(A nigga lost his name, what you crying for?)
Rock bottom, not going up
Fuck slowing up, I’m drinking (yay)
3 hoes, all 4 of us, I’m thinking (yay)
Know some niggas at the bottom and they still in it
Ask yourself, nigga really?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I’ve been dangerous
Rolled up blazed with the angel dust
Murder one homicide when they came to us
We came with the bail when they came with cuffs
Fame and trust – it don’t mix, like oil in the water
Feds on my door while I’m boiling the water
Need those chips, Michael in the fourth quarter
When you getting money fast life’s getting shorter
Nigga hit yo' head then nigga go and mop 'em
Nigga play Batman nigga gon rob 'em
Looking at my rap shit, nigga won’t argue
Niggas talk a rap beef, nigga no problem
Coming from my head, just my God on me
Pussy and the bread, keep 'em calling me
Money in the bag, nigga calling me
But you pussy ass crackas don’t follow me
Now I’m talkin bout 500 dirty on my day like
Them young niggas hit you on the daylight
Young nigga tote that nina
Niggas turn on you, they ain't playin' right
Hundred thousand with a cross in the middle
Playing both sides with a cross in the middle
R.I.P. with a cross in the middle
HAAAH! (Ask yourself nigga, really)

[Hook][The Notorious B.I.G.]
Where Brooklyn at?, Where Brooklyn at?, Where Brooklyn at?, Where Brooklyn at?
We gonna do it like this
Anytime your ready, check it!

I got seven Mac 11's, about eight
38's, nine 9's, ten Mac 10's, the shits never ends
You can't touch my riches, even if you had
MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
That's how I got the weedspot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lamb's bread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give mc's the runs drippin'
When I throw my clip in the AK
I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Mateo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God, I'm droppin shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin' babies at they christening

[2Pac]
Motherfucking Biggie Smalls

[Kane]
What you gonna do with it 2Pac?

[2Pac]
Yeah where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw your motherfucking middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this

I thank the Lord for my many blessings, though I'm stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nuttin separatin us from a MacK 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, hold up
A straight soldier, bucking at the busters
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me striking down the block, hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I - wanna
And ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug Life motherfucker crime, pays!
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me nigga
Zig zaggin through the freeway, race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker, that you ever saw[Verse 1]
Game on lock, she ain't stepping on this bus if she ain't gon pop
I ain't walking in the jeweler if i ain't gon cop
Stole Mase flow just to say i ain't gon stop,
Who made the beats hot? CL or Pete Rock
Shit or was it a perfect marriage
Me I'm both in one my beats got me the chain
My raps bought me this range, my diamond chain the clearest
Funny how a youngin i never liked carrots
But now im older and I'm eating better, which means
Less beef and more cheddar more bread, more lettuce
Was always fucking dimes but now a days more let us
From a world where love was just four letters, a go getta
My shows better, my flows better
A go getta rarely do i do better
I'm too set in my ways I'm too gutter to change
Should have known that I'm the coldest I'm two letters away
Nigga who better than Jay? from the the the roc
Not HOV though its Cole yo
Niggas taking pictures every time I'm in the store yo
When I hit the club they be snapping on the low yo
Niggas snapping pictures every fucking where i go yo
Sometimes i be mad as shit
Then I say stupid motherfucker boy you asked for this
Oh yeah I did, didn't I, did it big, didn't I
Made my album sell like it did a bid, didn't I
Check the album credits that's produced and written by
None other then yours truly
I'm bored sue me, im all on the billboards I'm tryna make Forbes sue me
Audio visual nigga i could score a movie
You couldn't score a bucket, I'm aiming at warren buffet
And painting my poorest fuck it, it rains and it pours
I'm covered out on these tours, running a train on your whore
Take her home in a ford, ironic cause i explore
Nigga I explore!

[Verse 2]
Prophecys fulfilled, as i proceed to kneel
Dodging greed of niggas who cock and squeeze to steal
I do this for my niggas that got degrees and still broke as fuck
Fuck your flag, democracy has failed
I'm in the realest state with no properties for sale
Probably could build with Socrates himself
No soccer moms to throw us on soccer teams but still
Kick shit so cold boy i can freeze in hell
Now do tell exactly how does it feel
Tryna save a generation knowing that you never will
Tryna do rap without some nigga tryna pay your bills
Cause you black and rap you'll never do no numbers like Adele
Oh well Momma already been through hell
I could turn this into heaven if my records even sell
I'm a firm believer if you never quit you never fail
If i slip i grab the rail ill get a grip and never fail

[Verse 3]
Falling victim to this society, wheres hoes gaining notoriety
And if i ain't rocking chains these kids won't admire me
Niggas try extorting me to get a verse up out of me
Nigga eat dick your street shit don't apply to me
I walk around dolo no security YOLO
So if a nigga plan to put a bullet through my polo
Cause i wouldn't help his promo so be it
Kill you niggas without licking a shot, this cold war, Soviet
No Vietnam, back in Fayettenam. no stay at home moms
We was far from street niggas but we played along
Walk around with our mean mugs painted on
Rest in peace to all the teen thugs
May the lord bless your soul
Cross the crossings this must be called life
Momma stressed she been stressing all night
But momma your little bundle of joy
Is clever enough to avoid the pitfalls of this world they destroyed
This is clever nigga i never seen another nigga[Intro: Funkmaster Flex]
We out here moving, J.Cole is here
This has happened before
When the mics are set up like this
You know something's gonna happen

[Start: J.Cole]
Is it on me?
Is it on me?
Hmmmmm, hmmmmmm
Hmmmm, hmmmm
NYC, Cole World

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Look, they say I'm something like a teacher
I guess they right, I'm with your bitch on her
How to play FIFA, kick game Messi
Switch lanes while I get brains, bet me
I don't whiff stain anything these pricks aim at me
I am hater proof, the straight up truth
Went and got my weight up God
Now I'm straight-up Zeus
Silly little rappers rhyming 'bout their made-up coupes
That you ain't ever gonna drive, jets you will never step inside
So just step aside, rather look up at the sky
Don't you see this middle finger from my big ol' G5, I
Chartered planes, ballin' blowin' money fast though it's all in vain
You only live once, so fuck the cops
Who'd rather see us all in ball-and-chains
My aim is to stretch my name in your Hall of Fame
Next to Elvis, paint a vivid picture of where hell is
And crawled out, heart froze and it never thawed out
So I balled out, with my balls out
Screamin' live for the moment, make sense don't it
My mama need a crib I'm gon' cop it and she'll own it
We gon' toast to the days when they foreclose our shit
Now we livin' better thanks to the flows I spit
And I'll make sure she paid like she wrote my shit
That's a Wayne line, no time to count this dough I get
All this gear I don't wear, I need four closets (damn)
Go figure, my pockets got bigger
Now all those I don't fuck with say "That's my nigga"
"That's my nigga"

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
You see us, baby
Funk Flex, J.Cole
Who you mad at, me or yourself

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
Look
They give props to the others but them niggas ain't help
Take a look around, girl I built this shit up myself
At a time when niggas cry 'bout how they sit on the shelf
I gave the world 2 classics to put on my belt
Way before Work Out I did them sit-ups myself
Too many hands in my pockets, niggas hit at my wealth
I gotta, re-maneuver these deals, they need improving drastically
Cause homie if you asking me
I'm supposed to be the richest nigga since Master P
If not, at least half, my nigga at least half
Afraid of 30, still looking twenty, like he's Fab
Subtle shit, throwing these jabs like he's Zab
I seen, Mac Miller, that nigga got mad millers
The rap Brad Miller and even a tad iller
You see me, salute me, it's crazy the way they do me
You would feel me if you niggas knew me, let's make a movie
Out this shit, cause these hoes getting choosy out this bitch
Playing "Juicy" in jacuzzis, getting woozy I could sip
Champagne and hopefully forget the whole damn thing
We pullin' hoes like a ol' hamstring
Cole so damn mean, and high as fuck nigga no landing
Long as I'm alive, no man king
And nigga that was the hook

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
HOT 97, baby!!!

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Look
This music's my weapon so anyone that's interrupting
Get a Colin Kaepernick bullet straight to the chest
Tryna make an impression, so if I aim to the left
And you can't make the reception, ya man'll catch a great interception
I'm nice nigga, could've dropped the album like twice nigga
So nigga fuck your advice nigga
Started off friendly, now all these niggas my enemies
What could you say to offend me?

[Outro:]
I could go forever, Flex, I could go forever
Born Sinner, TOMORROW, June 18th
I could go on forever[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Check check, one two, one two, one two
(Yo it’s rolling?) Yeah yeah yeah, Dr. Dre up in here, y'all know what this is
It’s what you’ve been waiting for, Funkmaster Flex big caps
Def Jam records giving it to you baby
Yo Eminem, show these motherfuckers what time it is baby

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be a lonely man, only mad
Till I got a million dollars, shit now if I only had
Some fucking hair I'd pull it faster than a bullet
Out of 2Pac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan, and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate this straitjacket
It ain't latching and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me and just kept throwing their fucking self at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation
Anyway, I got down with Dre
The first man who taught me how the Glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, Fuck the Police
When you still had your mother's fucking nipple stuck in your teeth
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holler bravo
Hell yeah I punch my bitch
And beat my kids in public
Suck my dick bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face
But I won't
Cause you probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass 2Pac image
You faggots ain't tough
You just get drunk and become talkative
I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling
Mumbling a bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'm just high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs
When I'm fly on kites
Motherfucker
Slim Shady
I'm drunk, pass the Tec

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre] (x2)
Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it moving
Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron
Psych, I'm just joking
For Christ sakes
Don't get so bent out of shape
Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it
But I won't let it upset me
Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of its own
Sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove
Hello, where you at
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
Hailie Jade, Daddy loves you, baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter
Fuck you lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in, you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me, so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped
With a Band-Aid over his mouth and shove his head in a fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip-hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the White kids like it so they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night gets silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it, let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since three years old

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do [echo][Intro]

[Verse 1]
Don't even know if summer gon' feel me
So many sides to a nigga
I wonder who's the real me
Tired of fightin'
Tired of always trying to enlighten
Hit the blunt that I am lightin'
To catch a spark cause I'm writin'
Some shit that'll cause a riot
Or make a war go quiet
Make a fat cat diet
Make the square bitch try it
Make a cheapskate buy it
Tell me who as high as this
Balenciaga kicks for kicks
Tell me who fly as this
Effortless, got dressed quick
You niggas stress at this
An hour on your outfit and
You still can't impress a bitch
I cruise through the city so mean
Gangster lean, with no promethazine
So obsessed with cream
I done hit the lottery in my dream like four times
Took a minute but I burst on the scene in '09
Now tell these hoes meet me and please be on time
She come up out the jeans, and it seems she want mine
For her unborn child
Girls gone wild meets black girl lost
She got the type of body, piss fat girls off
This ain't love dove, this lust
Do you know how fast that wears off
Let me take you back to queens
Where a nigga was a king, uncrowned
Country boy, new kid in town
Ran the streets after sundown
Hit the spots you wouldn't come around
Same block that Sean Bell was gunned down
Told that hatin' ass cop harrasin' me cause I am black
"You ain't have to do that man like that
The nigga ain't even do a crime, yet you squeeze 50 times"
He turned to me with a smirk "51 to be exact", damn
Cole world, no cupid
Got drama with these niggas fronting like they so ruthless
Ok I am supposed to like your record
Cause you got a little record
Tell me do that make you real
Or just real fuckin' stupid
Nickel and Dime nigga
Came back with the hustle but get with the times nigga
You live in rewind nigga
Real niggas believe in me
Cause ain't nobody seein' me
And the way I shine is intended to blind niggas
And I am ghost
Disappear like Copperfield in the six
Switch gears and cop a feel for your bitch
Yeah that yellow bone thing, that's my honey
Everytime my fucking telephone ring it's about some money
And you know that, nigga
You know that

[Outro]Feel like I'm big meech
When I be cashing out
Holding my bottles up champagne splashing out
We all got rooms nobody crash the couch
More K's at the crib than a Kardashian house
No Brian Pumper jewels just large links
A lotta ice in em, I'm talkin large drinks
Lets see what the Audemars thinks
My necklace make chicks Nicki Minaj blink
There is no challengers
F what the dodge thinks
I'm ridin in some....
My garage stinks
Coconut Ciroc
Coca loso
Pretty boy swag never coke my nose though
Got your baby mama eatin off Philippe plates
It means the world to her to me it's just a cheap date
Plenty fish in the sea
And I keep bait
You're a broke rollerblader, cheap skate
My g plate say "tune into the game"
Competition killer
Funeral's the name
Listen up son
I'm immune to all the lame
If I fathered your style, put a junior to your name
I searched the whole planet
There's no comp on earth
Sky blue J's look like I stomped a smurf

Life is but a dream
Ain't always what it seem
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
Raise your glass
Now lets toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equals success, I did the math
I see haters in passing yea they round
I be on the way up
They be on the way down
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip Payless
Won't be on Craigslist
Lifestyle's A-list
On my way to vegas
Ipod playlist
Yea, just another page in my success story
I make my worst enemies work the best for me
My only job, persistant and consistent
I go so hard my assistants need assistants
I'm living my hands on, get the feel of it
Life's a bitch you might want to get familiar with
Yea...Yea...I ain't done...I ain't done...Can we keep going?

This the flow that put haters on their deathbed
And make the chicks blow the whistle give me ref head
Somebody call 911 like 'Clef said
Before my mans and them black out - Meth Red
The newspaper said 'young rapper left dead'
The only suspect they have is young funeral
And when you see him, he might be on his goony prowl
So just put em up in the air George Clooney style
Slow motion for me, Soulja Slim Juvenile
Don't shoot move, a dude can't move his bowels
Or catch it like Larry Fitzgerald
Kurt Warner bullets pourin out the fifth barrel
Baby Im'a make it
My shits thorough
Shootin blanks
Yall ?
The competi-
Can't hold me
But first lay in the box
And cross your hands for me
Fan base killer blame your loss of fans on me
I triple what you see's like Ross's mans homie
Dudes get to New York look lost as D'antoni
You pick the place everybody cross the land know me
Keep it real, I can't endorse of stand phonies
Unless we arm wrestle never force my hand homie
These YSL's cost a grand only
My white girl bought that Porsche sedan for me
Sweet, sweet like Georgia peaches
School of hard ... I get brain from gorgeous teachers
Funeral in the house, no mortgage either
Any competition he see, the boy is ethered
I can't feel my face, this that Boston George's reefer
You lie if you say I ain't hotter than August weether
I mean weather, you can't see me I mean ever
Ever ever? Andre 3g
This is me, G
Gucci print G G
Clean ice, neck full of frozen fiji
Been in the game long as Mario Luigi
No Juvenile, Wayne, Turk, or BG
I'm still hot boy
But its not a game jack
You bang right the first time they don't bang back
Dudes can't ball like me they quickly nearing horse
I bring death to em
No hearing loss

[Shyne]

Fidel shipped me a hundred bricks, up on the boat
My bitch, I to our to you, playa said she'd fly coach

Tie you, see me? Na na with out the I.U

[Hook]

[Funkmaster Flex over Hook]
Yeah Bad Boy, Shyne
Shout to Harve Pierre
Funk Fliggity baby; 60 Minutes of Funk, Volume Four![The Notorious B.I.G.]
Where Brooklyn at?, Where Brooklyn at?, Where Brooklyn at?, Where Brooklyn at?
We gonna do it like this
Anytime your ready, check it!

I got seven Mac 11's, about eight
38's, nine 9's, ten Mac 10's, the shits never ends
You can't touch my riches, even if you had
MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
That's how I got the weedspot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lamb's bread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give mc's the runs drippin'
When I throw my clip in the AK
I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Mateo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God, I'm droppin shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin' babies at they christening

[2Pac]
Motherfucking Biggie Smalls

[Kane]
What you gonna do with it 2Pac?

[2Pac]
Yeah where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw your motherfucking middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this

I thank the Lord for my many blessings, though I'm stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nuttin separatin us from a MacK 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, hold up
A straight soldier, bucking at the busters
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me striking down the block, hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I - wanna
And ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug Life motherfucker crime, pays!
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me nigga
Zig zaggin through the freeway, race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker, that you ever saw[Funkmaster Flex]
Yeah Dirty South baby - Ludacris
Shout to Shaka Zulu, my man Shawn Taylor
.. it's goin down

[DTP]
Yeah, Funk Flex, Volume Fo'
Disturbin The Peace, Def Jam South
'Cris (yeah) you ready?

[Ludacris]
Oh it's my turn? Aiight..
I got permission to put ya mamma in a headlock (what?)
She tried to jook me in a figure-fo' leg lock (ohh)
She said she like the way I stick and make the bed rock
Or how I lick and leave her twisted like a dreadlock, and it's on
So stop the sweatin like a wristband
And get some balance like a bike without the kickstand
I think I changed the definition of a hit man
Cuz I could really give a fuck about that bitch man, c'mon!
We puttin holes in your residence
And lose anybody for the right president
We thugged out street niggas with intelligence
So all that bullshit you yappin is irrelevant
Oh yeah, I represent the Dirty Southside
I'm a dentist makin women open they mouth wide
You be in jail still runnin it on the outside
Thank not then won't ya open up ya mouth riiiight, but who cares?

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I got my corner on lockdown
About to hold this whole block down
Ludacris tell um how the South sound
UUH BUDDAH-LAA AH, UH UH UH BUDDAH-LAA
UHH BUDDAH-LAA AH uh oh uh oh uh oh

[Verse 2]
Comin to Shady Park is like a peep show
It's some respectable ladies and there some freak hoes
I know killers that go to church up in they street clothes
You'll end up missin more than Shaq when shootin free throws
They packin and bout to open up the dope spot
My neighborhood is stoppin cars like a roadblock
They movin' weight like Atlanta was movin boat rock
And catchin ums like seeun Muslims eatin pork chops - never happen
And meanwhile I been thinkin man
Niggas been slangin tapes like they slangin 'caine
Cuz in the hood its gettin ugly like orangutang
So if you tryin to stop the hustle get the dangalang
Okay, we tryin to make our own White House
Paint it black and start yellin our fuckin pipes out
You try to tackle some players and you'll get psyched out
They can't fuck with us niggas you think they dyked out, so don't play

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Disturbin The Peace, we do that funky shit
Hey, what can I say? We got a monkey clique
See Dre'll throw on them shades, and make that funky shit
And keep y'all women away if they got funky clit
Understand, we got that dough and it get rolled up
You pay the price and still we got the block sold up
Ain't nothin nice a full house don't make you fold up
You full of heist and try to jet and I'm like -
Hold up, god damn - I need to say it on a megaphone
And tell your sister get the fuck up off the telephone
These fools is tickin me off like fifty metronome
I'm takin all of ya money just call me Pebbletone!
Alright? I got the pistol and the safe key
You betta tell your bitch to follow you to safety
How dare you wanna be heroes and chase me
It's Ludacris won't leave no evidence to trace me, you know why?

[Hook]

Funky shit oh
Do that funky shit oh
Do that funky shit oh

Get acquainted to the one and the only
The future, hip-hop king
Forever, the Canibus... (The Funkmaster Flex is coming!)

[Canibus]
Yo, yo
For all you niggas saying that my shit is sick
Just imagine the ninety percent of my brain that I ain't even used yet
Take a deep breath, quick, suck in as much air
As my lungs will permit, then I start to kick that shit
I been getting busy before the planets started to turn
Before the bees, the birds, and Adam and Eve occured
Prior to all creation, in other words
When the female egg will merge with the man's sperm
I stand firm, my words burn through your exterior
They eat away at your interior, I'm superior
While you only pretend to be, I can double my density
From three-sixty degrees to seven-twenty instantly
Six, multiplied by five by four by three by two then one
Go head and calculate the sum
The time has cometh, I was summoned to punish
Motherfuckers with mouths that runneth over with rubbish
When I come through, niggas stand stiller than statues
Cause if I have to, I'll battle your whole rap crew
Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd
And rip your fucking skin off just to get on your nerves[Intro]
You think Philly cats won't snap on your mothafuckin ass
Huh, you think we won't pull these hammers out and do what we do, nigga
We live this, nigga. We don't just talk it, we live it
Muthafucka take it to the streets, that's all I can say
Take it to the muthafuckin streets, give me more nigga

[Hook]x2
You a deadman walkin
Have you like, "Damn, why am I in this coffin?"
Nigga, I live the life that you talkin
I hold the heat, shoot a muthafuckin target
You better duck bitch
[Spade]
He the dead man, he the fucked talkin in Fed land
He want me murdered, so shit when I heard it
I thoguth the nigga ahd life sentences concurrent
Man, I can't sleep 'till I see this nigga buried
Same nigga pointed out my man to the jury
Oh, him ha, oh he be workin in the gym ha
But you know its Spade that guns that make him slim, ha
And a type ??? that'll make a mnigga sin, ha
D.A. reduced his ass to 5 to 10, ha
He tellin, on how he was a three time felon
But, nah, me not worry give him 2 to his melon
He's a deadman walkin, deadman talkin
Deadman eatin, deadman sleepin
Go for his tool he's a deadman reachin
Open up his mouth he be a deadman speakin
Find em duck taped in the red van leakin
And shit, when I see him, it ain't no rap
Don't have nothin on your hip, if it ain't no gat
I'll put that thing to the beak, on his baseball cap
Throw the muffler on the front so there ain't no clap

[Hook]x2
You a deadman walkin
Have you like, "Damn, why am I in this coffin?"
Nigga, I live the life that you talkin
I hold the heat, shoot a muthafuckin target
You better duck bitch

[Beanie Sigel]
I stay strapped, I keep a half a hundred to cap
I put your stomach in your lap
You don't want none of the Mack
The gun'll come out if I think your runnin your mouth
I fuck around and have fifity niggas run in your house
Plus I keep an escape route to avoid the State Troop
Talkin to the jakes goose? 4 in your grapefruit
Catch me population, yard out, gray suit
You'se a bitch nigga, P.C. is where they take you
You think that clique tight, somebody bluffin
9 guns in a shootout, but 8 bustin
Let me find a female dog in my clique
I'mma grab the revolver in give em off 6
The same niggas that you thought would never snitch
Is fuckin your bitch, got the keys to your wip
Stay in your crib, eatin all your shit
Probably owe you shit, watch who you rollin with

[Hook]x2
You a deadman walkin
Have you like, "Damn, why am I in this coffin?"
Nigga, I live the life that you talkin
I hold the heat, shoot a muthafuckin target
You better duck bitch

[Dutch]
It take a baller ta ball Playa to pimp
You can tella gangsta when he walk he limp
And everytime he talk he talk real quick
Get caught by the cops, don't know shit
Even if its him, don't know shit
He's the type of dude you just don't fuck with
Talk real breezy, or press your luck with
And if you wanna know who he is, he Dutch, bitch
His watch is his power, chain is his strength
Money getting low, police watchin my strips
Helicopters, binoculars watchin my bricks
Getting in my grime, changin my flip
I'm too young to be stressed
Daughter need pampers, daddy need rest
Baby moms trippn, tryn cause my arrest
You think its suicide, walkin without a vest
You a deadman, nigga

[Hook]x2
You a deadman walkin
Have you like, "Damn, why am I in this coffin?"
Nigga, I live the life that you talkin
I hold the heat, shoot a muthafuckin target
You better duck bitch

[Outro]
Deadman walkin (repeated seversl times w/ change of voice)[Verse One: DMX]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Niggas gettin trampled on, what's all the fuss about?
Suckin my dick so hard, I'm bustin in they mouth
And then I snuff em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did
With no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you wit your kid
Slid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that
Where ARE they at, when I get thirsty, shit
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits, and pieces are all thats that left
Niggas so scared to death, they hold they motherfuckin breath
Til I pass, cause they ass, and I smelled em
I S-P-E-L-L-E-D T-H-E-M, I spelled em
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head
Catch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead
Red alert, niggas is about to get hurt, do work
To skirts, like a jag on the merk, ARF
Night time is the right time for creepin
Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleepin
I been off the deep end, since I was semen
That's why now, I'm such a motherfuckin demon!
SCREAMIN, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gotsta get off
Can't even hold a joint, lest I let off
A couple of rounds, from the big three pound seven
That's about eleven hundred as of now
How-can-one-man-kill-so-many-and
The-sin-be-plenty-before-the-age-of-20 {*sing like Nice and Smooth*}
Life ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot
That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot
Fat new leather jacket, I bag it, along with
The jewels smackin tools out the hands of fools
On the strength that they don't know what they holdin
Niggas called me TAILOR cause the WAY that I be sewin
Shit up cause I get up, off my ass and SKATE
Makin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state
I speak the GREAT, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga, "The FUCK is you be sniffin?"
Cause when it come to riffin, I am the riff raffin
Ain't gots to say nuttin, niggas know to give half

Motherfucker, Funk Flex, volume three, the final chapter
Ruff Ryders, Irv Gotti, Def Jam..
Right here, where my dogs at?
Got them all for you baby I got them all
I gots them all..[Verse One Troy Ave]
Now I ain't got a worry in the world, I went from dealing bricks to doing rap
But nowa nigga know I'm gonna be rich
I see the haters I'm pointing, and laughing at the tears
I'm the biggest thing out my city in the past ten years
They don't do shit they pussy, in gats we trust
We ain't the same, motherfuckers never loved us
Drake do R&B, that's how he make his chips
I did R&B too, but mines was rap and bricks
Don't knock the hustle we open, come in go shop
Man you can buy anything except your way to the top
I look and sound like New York, all my beats do not
These other rappers lookin' shitty tryin' to see young chop
I'm fever, the new school leader, you don't got no class I don't fuck with you neither
So don't tell me that you rep New York and you like what I bring
I heard that song when you was trying to be like 2chainz
You ride around lickin' dick, I'm riding around with the grit
Life ill and everyone real a nigga spit
A few of you want payback cause your people gone
But I know God got me, I did more right then wrong
Hovain is killing, the business building
I want more and I say lets get millions
That's what we about to be getting, I ain't trying to boast
But you niggas can't see me, motherfucker I'm ghost

[Verse Two Styles P]
I'm ghost too
Guess what I'm close to? The handgun, the weed bag
Tell grandmothers I'll kill their grandsons
My soul's ugly my face handsome
I sold bass, and I took niggas for ransom
Ex stick up kid, heroin dealer
A lot of rappers claiming they real but I bet I'm realer
I'm just an OG smoking OG kush
I'll murder that young boy and get the OG bush
It's enormous shit, new informer shit
Get you popped up, 38 taurus shit
Niggas like me, is the reasons that the law exist
Lord assist, ?
You want bricks? I'm the one you put the order with
Fuck it up you getting drowned in your ?
I'm on some mexican, cartel, border shit
I got fish scale, who looking to score this shit
I got big bullets, who want to explore the clip
Either the big nine or the four to fifth
Or you can get a shell from the trey pound
The money stacks up but I stay down[Intro]
That "T" would help though
Here we go again
Yeah, check it out, y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check it out y'all, check it out y'all
Straight Y.O. mother fuckers

Now days cats and middleman, little man, ain't controlling shit
Talk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick
Niggas talk real slick, but that's about it
Soon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick
Must you beat me in my head everytime I come through?
It's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you
But you not me, got me? And you can live without me
If I wasn't DMX, you wouldn't give a fuck about me
Ain't about "Dog I wanna be just like you"
How about you wanting to be just like you?
You can do what I do, just in your own way
Shit, I get niggas that ride big every fuckin' day (I-ight?)
If you got talent, talent is yours, it can't be mine
And it take you where it's gon' take you, it'll be fine
Let me hit 'em with the rewind
Do you and I'll do me
To me you'll see how real you'll be

1 - Do you - Cuz what it boils down to it's true
Do you - Cuz you are held accountable for you
Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
Do you - Cuz I'mma do me, truley

Do you - Cuz what it boils down to, it's true
Do you - Cuz you are held accountable for you
Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
Do you - Cuz I'mma do me, truley

Hey yo dog, I got lyrics
Hey yo dog, I got beats (Word)
Damn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets?
Used to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody
Everywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party
It ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like
But if we all see it through the eyes of the Lord, we see a light (c'mon)
Just let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something
Now the good things that go wrong because of a little frontin'
Express yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star
You don't even know what you got inside
How the fuck you gon' find out, you keep wanting to ride
Hey yo, I ain't gon' let it slide no more
You're best to go for what you know
Can't do you, then what you flow for
You ain't gon' get there tryin' to be me, dog
Look through your eyes, see what you see

Repeat 1

Like fuck it, you wanna be me? Here's what you do
Grow up neglected by both parents and still pull through
You gots to come up fucked up, get treated like shit
Then have your mother's new boyfriend smack you like a bitch
Turn into a killer, don't carry shottie
Cuz the way it's goin' down right now, you gon' kill somebody
Get a dog, walk the streets, learn what you need to learn
Better have a cause but because you'll get burned
You got 15 years without ever coming out
And beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about
Then get locked up every two years
For two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears
Become a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes
Let 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine
In time, everything you hear will come true
But you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you

Repeat 1 until fade[Fat Joe]
Power from the street lights made the place dark
But yo they didn't care, they turned it out..
Uhh, you know what this is, South Bronx
Fat Joey Crack representin the realest
I got my man Big Dog Punisher in the house
Yo Punisher, let these niggas know

[Big Punisher]
Brothers are rappin like Iraqi soldiers
Actin like they crackin boulders
When they pack a cap that won't attack a blowfish
Always talkin shit, players that rather balk than pitch
And often counterfeit, Kings of New York
On Mr. Walken's dick
You make me sick to my stomach, you don't really want it
Riffin like you sniffin coke
To scare me but you barely blunted
You really done it now you got me mad
Morenos be like, "Papi's bad,"
Makin fakers cocky when I'm drivin back

[Fat Joe]
Many thought it couldn't happen, Joe is never rappin
He was always get loot off the crack and
Fuckin with them heavyweights, who had shit sewn in every state
The very sight'll make the average man defecate
Livin the life of stock bonds and cars, word bond
I be gone I'll be worshiped like Nicky Barnes
It's on -- you don't want no confrontation
Kill the communication, or suffer from multiple lacerations

[Big Punisher]
I keep a Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo
With my top hat, what you funny motherfuckers know about that?
Lookin Doug E. Fresh in my double breast
Like a pimp, eatin shrimp, gumbo, bubble bathin
In the jumbo jet, set, on auto-pilot
Gonna fly it to Puerto Vallarta
Charter a chopper on top of the Hyatt

[Fat Joe]
Business chatter's over shrimp and lobster platters
At Jimmy's Cafe, a glass of Peirier
Chick go for celly book a room at the Holiday
Inn, so I can get her and a friend
Menage a trois livin the life of a star
Overweight overpaid, pockets bustin out the seams
While you niggas havin limousine dreams
I got you all sized up, niggas wise up
A Fat Beat truck'll be pickin all you guys up

[Big Punisher]
For you hilarious comedians, I'm at the Marriott with deviants
And rentin chariots to carry us to various
Evening events, eating the best up in Jimmy's Cafe
Extorting wannabes for all their G's
Fuck it, just gimme half
I make it last, with the dough I got, if not
I blow your spot, if not, Joey Crack please load the Glock
Let these niggas learn the hard way
The word to God way, the motherfuckin murder mob way

[Fat Joe]
Fuck that fuck that fuck that!
Funkmaster Flex keepin it realer
Hot 97, Joey Crack, Big Dog Punisher
Bulletclips, WHAT![Intro: French Montana]
Give a fuck about yo feelings (x3)

[Hook: French Montana]

Give a fuck about yo feelings
Who gives a fuck?

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
All of them niggas complaining
Tell from the second I came in
I done been through mo' shit
Po shit to the top, now I’m faded
I don’t give a fuck where a nigga been, where a nigga going
Or what kind of shit he been through (yay)
Watch niggas ball, shit I couldn’t score
I done sat up on the bench too
Now a nigga fly by (by), fly jumping out the drive right (right)
Haters see me when I hop out (what?)
When a nigga did his state bid
Was the only time I copped out (copped out, yay)
(I’m askin' God questions, what we fighting for?)
(A nigga lost his name, what you crying for?)
Rock bottom, not going up
Fuck slowing up, I’m drinking (yay)
3 hoes, all 4 of us, I’m thinking (yay)
Know some niggas at the bottom and they still in it
Ask yourself, nigga really?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I’ve been dangerous
Rolled up blazed with the angel dust
Murder one homicide when they came to us
We came with the bail when they came with cuffs
Fame and trust – it don’t mix, like oil in the water
Feds on my door while I’m boiling the water
Need those chips, Michael in the fourth quarter
When you getting money fast life’s getting shorter
Nigga hit yo' head then nigga go and mop 'em
Nigga play Batman nigga gon rob 'em
Looking at my rap shit, nigga won’t argue
Niggas talk a rap beef, nigga no problem
Coming from my head, just my God on me
Pussy and the bread, keep 'em calling me
Money in the bag, nigga calling me
But you pussy ass crackas don’t follow me
Now I’m talkin bout 500 dirty on my day like
Them young niggas hit you on the daylight
Young nigga tote that nina
Niggas turn on you, they ain't playin' right
Hundred thousand with a cross in the middle
Playing both sides with a cross in the middle
R.I.P. with a cross in the middle
HAAAH! (Ask yourself nigga, really)

[Hook]Yeah y'all this Jay-Z, coolin out with the Funk Flex
60 Minutes of Funk, volume two, how we do
Motherfucker... yeah you don't stop
You won't quit, Jay-Z drop shit like this
Aiyyo, my records sell cause I was born to do it
Kick that Willie shit well, cause I'm really gonna do it
The voice of the hustlers, who else gon do it?
Most niggas is locked or in the box with embalming fluid
That's how I get it locked when I come through in the V
You rap niggas on the radio don't do it for me
Insert the removable face, place the CD
Your Prince, cause you rap dudes don't make sense
Talk about bitten lines
Nigga I did ery bit of crime that I writ in mine
Ran so much coke, I could shit a dime
And this is way back when, way before your bullshit was signed
Tryin to indirectly, effect me, directly
Careful what you wish for, Jigga get raw
Nigga I'm straight gutta, let me remind you
Act like you, out of your mind, I put your mind out of you
I do anything when I put my mind to it
A whole lot more when I put the nine to it
I flow shit blow shit smash shit tow shit
On some sho' shit hose it down totally and you knows this man
Keep niggas in awe with the old shit
No shit, and I don't give a fuck who you go get
I fold shit like poker, smack em around
On some Joe Schmoe shit, I back your whole click down what?
Frito Lay rappers I slay for play, tell me
Who in your circle could fuck around with Jay?
No mo' shit, Cristals get dough shit
Shoot my pistals on the reg, I'm on some double-fo' shit
Bout to drop a jewel and make po-po sick
I only the respect feds, beat cops know shit
I'm pro slick, the dopest nigga to your brain, the comatose shit
Cause after all, what's my name, oh shit!

Yeah Funk Flex and uh, we don't stop
Y'all wanna rhyme like me, wanna dime like me
Every Tom, Dick and Harry wanna ride my mami
Drink Cristal, play diamonds in his wristal
Sell fish scale, y'all niggas love this style
Wannabe players, Jay-Z's offic-ial
Been through out, I could tell you what to do and how to do it
Foundation is layed, we can take this to the top babygirl
If you're not afraid, the world is watchin
Most certainly, clowns wanna get up in your drawers
Think they hurtin me, ha hah
I keep you ill and traced out, tennis brace style
Cartier watch my diamond face style
Crib on the coast, marble floors laced out
Chase you upstairs singing 'Let's Play House'
Drop a seed in her, little life to breathe in her
Wanna boy so to be sure, I OD'd in her
His days are laced in Caesar Leguars
All the chicks jealous at the baby showers
Beatch!

How we do, Funk Flex, yeah
Brooklyn...

*fades into How About Some Hardcore by M.O.P.*[Funkmaster Flex]
Yeah, you know I had to get Bad Boy up on this piece
You know I had to get Bad Boy up on this piece!
Big shot to my man Puff Daddy, Notorious B.I.G., one time!

[Styles]
I'd rather not breathe than snitch
And I love my niggas not my bitch, Lox pop the clip
If the rap game was the dope game
I be a chink named Lu Kang, selling Montega on my own plane
Movin with, entrepeneurs, who run the law
Coke sniffin bitches holdin forts off the wall
Back to reality my mentality is fatality
Niggas makin way over they salary
I think way out, like a fifty state lay-out
Thugs meetin up in one city to have a spray out
Cartels bring in they coke, havin a weigh out
Kingpins is crowned, blunts is lit
Aiyyo Styles don't exist so a cell ain't shit
Jail ain't shit, God'll just teach me quick
If they put me in a cell then my ghost'll drift
Hold my inf, feel my soul give me the strength

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Pop the gat, aim squeeze precisely
Where them niggas at? Them faggots are sheisty
See the problem's that, you way too nice please
Where that coke at? Fuck where it might be
Don't be like me, hard-headed, and stubborn
When my gun burn, much hotter than sunburn
You got one turn, I suggest you show
Me the stash to the cash and the blow, yo
Wherever I go, my crew, is true to swarm
Got stripes in New York like Yankee uniforms
When I was born, I know I make the world darker
The age of fifteen, tote gats, quick to spark ya
Like Bob Barker, if The Price is Right
Lay your ass down for spite, anybody aight?
Went from eatin no frills cereals with food stamps
To Armani materials, coppin Rembrandts

[Jadakiss]
I got cats to spray for me, honeys that pay for me
Money that lay for me, mami, pray for me
Cats that spray for me, honeys that pay for me
Money that lay for me, mami, pray for me

[Shiek]
Uhh, uhh, talkin to me doin shit for you, try God
Cause after one in your cabbage you as good as retard
Mr. Big Style, too cool, I did this to you
Whirlpool maxin, lounge to the end
Elevator, next stop, Tony and LaFrenz
While y'all still fuckin with them twins from Flatte
I'm out in Vegas, tryin to strip Stacey Dash
Fuck police talk black I don't do shit in New York
Too many supercops nigga, you can have these blocks
And these hoes, with them cheap ass Parasucos
Get some new clothes, then I let you front in my Porsche
And give Jay head, til your squeaky voice turns hoarse

[Jadakiss]
Four minutes and twenty five seconds to your end
You know it be the kiss, grantin your last wish
Everybody wanna know who The Lox is
Cause we ain't spittin nuttin out but that hot shit
Burnin trees, sippin mo', eatin lobsters
Up in the oriental joint, usin chopsticks
Soon we gonna rock gators, hit bitches from Barbados
Then all y'all players gonna hate us
Cause everything we do stay gettin overlooked
Now y'all be shook cause you dealin with real crooks
I can't lie for a while y'all cats was on us
But now, if you can't beat us, join us
We tryin to blow lye with the Sultan of Brunei
In it for the cheddar, Gucci slip-ons and sweaters
Black M5 with the headers

Niggas sayin Bad Boy this and Bad Boy that

This be the Ma$e Bad Boy debut (that's right)
Y'all niggas in the back, steady sayin I'm souped
Your hoes in the front, steady sayin I'm cute (that's right)
Beep me all day just to lay up in the Coupe (ha ha)
I hit fam tell KAM pick me in the Land
Go blow six grand go catch a quick tan
I'm a big trick, drink expensive liquids
I see riches straight from the district (whoo!)
So how you expect you can jerk your check (I don't know)
Then you come home thinkin you deserve the sex
Yo I merk when I jet in convertible Lex
And I move too swift, might hurt your neck (ahaha)
I jump out the Lex with the iceberg sweat
Platinum chain hang with a third of baguettes (c'mon)
This year P niggas gon fear me, hear me
Wave my treble, put my shit on blazin levels
C'mon niggas, give em what I got
Since you want butter now you got to take it while it's hot
I wasn't gonna talk but you made this a issue
Now I got to get you, send dog to sick you
Pull a pistol, make all my shots hit you
Rip your tissue, send you place where they miss you
{Puff Daddy repeats in background 2X}
Niggas sayin Bad Boy this and Bad Boy that
All I hear is mad more hits and mad more tracks
Walk the Ave then kiss you, man you wish you
Never fucked with Ma$e, his work be official
Can't scar the man with ?don de farges?

But we got to show them who's on top
Nuhmean?
Uh, check it out, uh
Fellow bitches, adapt to any rebel wishes
Check it out, the Queen Bee
Lil' Kim, Yeah
That's right
Lil' Kim in the house
Check it out
Wit my man, Flex
Uh

Sometime a gal can get couth, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
Ain't that the truth?
Frontin like they bulletproof
And those with no couth
Get thrown off the roof, like Bishop with the Juice
Part-nah, let your noose loose
Bitches got the audac-ity
Tryin to say they gettin cash like me, get ass like me
You couldn't be as classy as me
Even if you roll a Eva curtain
And diamonds on the surface it just defeats the purpose
Ho, I'mma double bitch
I lick dicks sometimes for the hell of it
Who stack chips like computers never celibate
Stash weed in Bermuda
Look around, look around, the room's empty
So, I guess that be me
The Queen B, Double E
I keep my foes close
Like I used to chop my hoes close
But this cat named Gicanno's
Who used to call me bag lady
Cause if you lick me from my
Index finger to the thumb, it shouldn't stay numb
See, I live this life, you wish this life
Dream this life, of royals
Motherfuckers got you gas motor spoiled
So what you gonna do when you run out of oil?
Crumble like the foil

This goes out to you
Sealed with a kiss, the Queenuesche
Uh, yeah, check it out
Me and my man Flex; we just doin this shit
That's why I'm up next, you know what I'm sayin?
We been there[From the end of the last track]
This is Funk Doctor Spot, K-Solo, comin to ya' live
1996 to 97', Funkmaster Flex!

[Redman talking]
I got tic tacs in my mouth with a big dick
But it dont matter, we representin, on some
Real shit, Def Squad, coming to ya live
Splittin these peas from a pod
Yo, K-Solo, drop 1 one time!

[K-Solo]
A breaka breaka, one-nine, site
Get off the dappa-vine, guess who's back to shine?

[Redman]
I wish I won the lotterry
So I could tell niggas to suck dick out of animosity
And freeze em' like pottery, and give labotomies
To all you rap colonies, and shut your million dollar investment to economy
Impossibly, might be the one in black leather
Nametag sayin "caution when wet by the track wetter"
The hash spreader, I love the grimey shit
Even my girl did grimy shit to me and I went back wit her
Three years for carryin a loaded handgun
But it's forever when a nigga BLOW! when he lands one
To your cranium, that red dot on your forehead is not cause your Arabian
Watch what you say to him! you caught up in a tight situation
I should start erasin, your whole organization for making
Wack tunes, while my whole platoon rock the basement
You couldn't come closer if I gave you my booking agent
Or producer, royalty points, 12-shot loaded luger
Even a crowd to get you sooped up, your still wack
I peel caps, on the regular
Destroy MCs ecetera, move like the Predator
Fuck you, your label, moms, and your editor
Give you two to the jugular, blood be spreaded
All on my shirt, it's the king of the blurt shittin
Bitches hit me off more than New Edition
TWIN TWIN TWIN TWIN! TWIN TWIN TWIN TWIN!
I make your heart skip a beat from the steel phyhique!Feel like I'm big meech
When I be cashing out
Holding my bottles up champagne splashing out
We all got rooms nobody crash the couch
More K's at the crib than a Kardashian house
No Brian Pumper jewels just large links
A lotta ice in em, I'm talkin large drinks
Lets see what the Audemars thinks
My necklace make chicks Nicki Minaj blink
There is no challengers
F what the dodge thinks
I'm ridin in some....
My garage stinks
Coconut Ciroc
Coca loso
Pretty boy swag never coke my nose though
Got your baby mama eatin off Philippe plates
It means the world to her to me it's just a cheap date
Plenty fish in the sea
And I keep bait
You're a broke rollerblader, cheap skate
My g plate say "tune into the game"
Competition killer
Funeral's the name
Listen up son
I'm immune to all the lame
If I fathered your style, put a junior to your name
I searched the whole planet
There's no comp on earth
Sky blue J's look like I stomped a smurf

Life is but a dream
Ain't always what it seem
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
Raise your glass
Now lets toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equals success, I did the math
I see haters in passing yea they round
I be on the way up
They be on the way down
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip Payless
Won't be on Craigslist
Lifestyle's A-list
On my way to vegas
Ipod playlist
Yea, just another page in my success story
I make my worst enemies work the best for me
My only job, persistant and consistent
I go so hard my assistants need assistants
I'm living my hands on, get the feel of it
Life's a bitch you might want to get familiar with
Yea...Yea...I ain't done...I ain't done...Can we keep going?

This the flow that put haters on their deathbed
And make the chicks blow the whistle give me ref head
Somebody call 911 like 'Clef said
Before my mans and them black out - Meth Red
The newspaper said 'young rapper left dead'
The only suspect they have is young funeral
And when you see him, he might be on his goony prowl
So just put em up in the air George Clooney style
Slow motion for me, Soulja Slim Juvenile
Don't shoot move, a dude can't move his bowels
Or catch it like Larry Fitzgerald
Kurt Warner bullets pourin out the fifth barrel
Baby Im'a make it
My shits thorough
Shootin blanks
Yall ?
The competi-
Can't hold me
But first lay in the box
And cross your hands for me
Fan base killer blame your loss of fans on me
I triple what you see's like Ross's mans homie
Dudes get to New York look lost as D'antoni
You pick the place everybody cross the land know me
Keep it real, I can't endorse of stand phonies
Unless we arm wrestle never force my hand homie
These YSL's cost a grand only
My white girl bought that Porsche sedan for me
Sweet, sweet like Georgia peaches
School of hard ... I get brain from gorgeous teachers
Funeral in the house, no mortgage either
Any competition he see, the boy is ethered
I can't feel my face, this that Boston George's reefer
You lie if you say I ain't hotter than August weether
I mean weather, you can't see me I mean ever
Ever ever? Andre 3g
This is me, G
Gucci print G G
Clean ice, neck full of frozen fiji
Been in the game long as Mario Luigi
No Juvenile, Wayne, Turk, or BG
I'm still hot boy
But its not a game jack
You bang right the first time they don't bang back
Dudes can't ball like me they quickly nearing horse
I bring death to em
No hearing loss
Nice[Havoc]
The illustrious
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, if you fuck with us
It's a must we busting if you stand with us
Nine times out of ten son, he might get bucked
Is we marked for death? Maybe marked for life
Cut by the gem star, razor tight, try to avoid that
Get this money up, live right, then it's put right
Anybody standing in the Mobb way, the hard way
To get his ? feet and the extra ? never lose sleep
Never roll less than two deep
Cause we mobb deep roll silent on this hard street
Talk the ? only eat dog meat we was stompin on
Have your mind baffled like an unknown phenomenon
Chop shit up like it's time for some

Havoc:
And all you bitches that you hittin' we done ran through that
Plus ? that's why the king's stand will crack

Big Noyd:
I die from the causes
Dive in these streets of New York kid
I'm dyin to find who the informer is
You know the fam strictly biz
So what the deal is dude, think you got a little confused
Comin out of QB not DC
Any problemo then see me
Bring it to the T-O-P
Rapper Noyd baby comin at ya
Holdin it down gettin around
Constantly comin at ya
Right back at ya with thug shit
Sit back relax you'll love this
Slim Jim, brown skin and rugged
Timb's unfastened pants saggin fuck it
We can do it however you want it
Even E&J or either blunted
Catch me sober
Peel a heat out of the holster and mini rover
It's the new Noyd order
I slaughter with Havoc and P
Funk Flex Final Chapter Volume 3 nigga

(Funkmaste Flex shout outs)

Prodigy:
Meditate to this
Celbrate my shit
Here's a toast to the most loved rap cage niggas
Entertain the thought
Of the grain being crossed
And the pain is brought, cuz in vain you talked
This be the rapture they spoke of in Revelations
Reveal the truth to the nations, it's only basic
Public relations so real you could taste it
Bitter to the mouth of those that hate this shit

Calico:
Face off, Jake's tryin to slap me in bracelets
My rap papers is so major
Base a wager that Timax won't pull out first
Calico's verse fire, can I disperse
Max like ? sax and A-blac ?
Dun burn that, put it all in they ear don't hold back
In the Ac with the rest of my type, only my kind
Niggas that'll take you to war, you outta line

Prodigy:
You crossed the fine space between love and hatred
Entertwined with the rest of my elite clique
Countermoves get plenty steps ahead of you
Men'll do all type of shit just to prove
They militant but get knocked the fuck out the box quick
They must have forgot how the mobb drop jewels and take spots
Y'all dudes don't deserve to eat
Mic check nigga, drop it like it's hot and bleed[Intro: Funkmaster Flex]
We out here moving, J.Cole is here
This has happened before
When the mics are set up like this
You know something's gonna happen

[Start: J.Cole]
Is it on me?
Is it on me?
Hmmmmm, hmmmmmm
Hmmmm, hmmmm
NYC, Cole World

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Look, they say I'm something like a teacher
I guess they right, I'm with your bitch on her
How to play FIFA, kick game Messi
Switch lanes while I get brains, bet me
I don't whiff stain anything these pricks aim at me
I am hater proof, the straight up truth
Went and got my weight up God
Now I'm straight-up Zeus
Silly little rappers rhyming 'bout their made-up coupes
That you ain't ever gonna drive, jets you will never step inside
So just step aside, rather look up at the sky
Don't you see this middle finger from my big ol' G5, I
Chartered planes, ballin' blowin' money fast though it's all in vain
You only live once, so fuck the cops
Who'd rather see us all in ball-and-chains
My aim is to stretch my name in your Hall of Fame
Next to Elvis, paint a vivid picture of where hell is
And crawled out, heart froze and it never thawed out
So I balled out, with my balls out
Screamin' live for the moment, make sense don't it
My mama need a crib I'm gon' cop it and she'll own it
We gon' toast to the days when they foreclose our shit
Now we livin' better thanks to the flows I spit
And I'll make sure she paid like she wrote my shit
That's a Wayne line, no time to count this dough I get
All this gear I don't wear, I need four closets (damn)
Go figure, my pockets got bigger
Now all those I don't fuck with say "That's my nigga"
"That's my nigga"

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
You see us, baby
Funk Flex, J.Cole
Who you mad at, me or yourself

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
Look
They give props to the others but them niggas ain't help
Take a look around, girl I built this shit up myself
At a time when niggas cry 'bout how they sit on the shelf
I gave the world 2 classics to put on my belt
Way before Work Out I did them sit-ups myself
Too many hands in my pockets, niggas hit at my wealth
I gotta, re-maneuver these deals, they need improving drastically
Cause homie if you asking me
I'm supposed to be the richest nigga since Master P
If not, at least half, my nigga at least half
Afraid of 30, still looking twenty, like he's Fab
Subtle shit, throwing these jabs like he's Zab
I seen, Mac Miller, that nigga got mad millers
The rap Brad Miller and even a tad iller
You see me, salute me, it's crazy the way they do me
You would feel me if you niggas knew me, let's make a movie
Out this shit, cause these hoes getting choosy out this bitch
Playing "Juicy" in jacuzzis, getting woozy I could sip
Champagne and hopefully forget the whole damn thing
We pullin' hoes like a ol' hamstring
Cole so damn mean, and high as fuck nigga no landing
Long as I'm alive, no man king
And nigga that was the hook

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
HOT 97, baby!!!

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Look
This music's my weapon so anyone that's interrupting
Get a Colin Kaepernick bullet straight to the chest
Tryna make an impression, so if I aim to the left
And you can't make the reception, ya man'll catch a great interception
I'm nice nigga, could've dropped the album like twice nigga
So nigga fuck your advice nigga
Started off friendly, now all these niggas my enemies
What could you say to offend me?

[Outro:]
I could go forever, Flex, I could go forever
Born Sinner, TOMORROW, June 18th
I could go on forever
