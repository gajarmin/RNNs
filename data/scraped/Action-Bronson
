[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy, igh!

[Hook]

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
La la la la[Produced by Hit-Boy]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm mmm,"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big KRIT]
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artistPrelude:
Fucking Drug Shit
Do the drugs
Yeah....Yo...

[Verse 1]
Straight from the depths of Queens.
Leave you sleeping on the mezzanine
Like you Lincoln, then switch into a desert scene
Often heard, but this motherfucker seldom seen
I'm throwing blows while you waiting for the bell to ring
Drug smoking
Raisins make the pasta sweet
Slumped over when the barrel and your posture meet
Stay lean like some motherfucking ostrich meat
You full of shit it's time to get a colonoscopy
Scissor kicks, dick suck from Miss Elizabeth
Lex Luger arms
4 in the morning in the dark with the computer on
Wasting my time, my thoughts are paced, untastable grace replaced in my mind
Born to shine like the eyes on a cat
Same cat fuck around, put the knife in your back
This is nothing, we live & let die and roam the land
And you bluffing
You lifted the cards and showed your hand pussy

[Verse 2]
Tailor-made rubber, Rubbermaid reliable
Never spill the soup
Rock a linen suit
Play the streets like the ball court
Spin & shoot
Strong as Popeye dipping in the spinach too

[Verse 3]
Take my nuts out your mouth
Let me breathe for a minute please
Your life is cheap like a hooker in the Philippines
About to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens
You're on the shelf like a figurine
Drugs infested my mind
But I'm destined to shine
Spit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind
Thousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine
Live divine, free the mind, lead the blind, read the signs
Hands up like you stepping in the party
No you getting robbed, motherfucker, with the shotty
Said you pottyd
Make your body do an ollie
Then dig your shorty out cuz I geeked her up on molly
Have her eating dick, no need for seasoning
If seven dudes are in the room then she's pleasing them
Like a trooper. Hit her in the pooper. Throw her in the shower
Then I take her out to Lupa
I'm kinky, I'll hit it even if it's stinky
Put em in the shower, make the pussy brand new
Ran through. Give 'em money what I can't do
Stuff her lunchbox & burn her with the candle

[Verse 4]
UH!
Consensual Rape
Vinegar solutions
Animal abusing
Barrel revolutions
Don't get me pissed off, fuck around rip your tits off
Still getting head, even if my dick's soft
Rising quick, no Fleischman's
I'm in the endzone with one leg up, posing like Heisman
Throwing like Theismann, sway foot
With the Village Leader smoking a pipe with seven wise-men
I eat the biggest piece of chicken at the table
Let 'em know I'm hungry
Polo on the rugby
The forty-four long surely got a trusty home
Trying to live American Dreams...Dusty Rhodes

Yeah
Fucking Pussy[Produced By: Noah "40" Shebib & Omen]

[Intro]
Uh, yeah, uh, opportunity be knockin', let a motherfucker in

[Hook]
Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby

[Verse 1]
All my life I was a fuck-up, now I pull the truck up
Same bitch stuck up, now she wanna suck us
See me hangin' out the window, screamin', "What, what?!"
No more tough luck, a different cloth is what I'm cut from
Baby, oh, my lord
The cops chasin' Bronson in an all-white Ford
Shit, I'm on that all-night tour
Bitch, I'm alright, but I'm off that raw
I'm in a robe dancin' salsa on the top floor
You would swear I'm Puerto Rican, but I'm not, lord
Hot hoes every city that we go, singin'
"Heads high, kill 'em with it now!"
Uh, all I do is eat oysters
And speak six languages in three voices
It's Adriatic Summers on a sail boat
Don't even try to call, I'm not available for nothin'
Unless it's stupid paper, hop out the Studebaker
With Anita Baker, uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh, I feel so alive, I think I shit myself
I should kiss myself
I'm starin' at the man inside the mirror
The reflection shows a wolf though (AOOOH!)
Goddamn, I'm still cute, ho (Yeah)
All my women play the flute
Saw me plate some melon and prosciutt'
Left handed, make the Fender cry
Count money with a reverend's smile, the Devil's eye
Half-Cherokee and Gemini, uh
Motherfuckers'll dump heat, from Jump Street
And turn your chest plate to lunch meat
I'm in a Humvee, lookin' like a young me
Now these motherfuckers all wanna be chubby
I switch the season, now the hair's curled
Tan skin, I need a bad girl
Cause James Brown said, "It's A Man's World"
In a Transam' Twirl, the burner handle made of pearl
That's just "Daddy's Little Girl"

[Hook][Produced By: Party Supplies]

[Verse 1]
Praise the lord, I was born to drive boat
Feeling like Slash in front of the chapel
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul
Shit I smoke is like cholesterol
Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival
The best of all, had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call
Best believe that there was neck involved
Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab
Uh, we took acid for ten days straight up in the mountains
Started running with the stallions
Playing frisbee in the West Indies, did the tango with my kidneys
Eyes open, now I know just who my kids need
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Bury a million in the sand, by the clock tower
Before I die, take a hot shower

[Hook 4x]
Ride the Harley into the sunset

[Verse 2]
By chance I seen her in the lobby of the Ritz
With her man, the one that swings a hockey stick
I was wearing all white, and my hair was looking precious
Shit, I might cop a chest and a dresser
A little machine to make espresso
I heard your bitch still wears Ecko
Hide drugs behind the box of De Cecco
Live from the Expo, it's me
I wear the wolf in the winter, steer the coupe from the center
Who gives a fuck, I'm a sinner
I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans
Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin
Bite the eel by the dozen (Got to take it for the team)
Bite the eel by the dozen

[Verse 3]
Pump the bass in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby hand
Except this toy cost 80 grand
And I'm crazy tan, from all the places that I've been
Just from writing words with a pen
Tell the pilot "Land the plane," on Roosevelt and Main
Put a jacuzzi on the seven train
And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face
I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste
The brass band was seven pieces, my bitch's name is Peaches
We got twin Mac elevens with the features
Shit you barely got sneaker money
So much dick in their mouths, that's why these motherfuckers speaking funny
You need to speak clearer dear, cause I can't hear ya
(I can't hear ya)
You need to speak clearer dear, cause I can't hear ya

[Verse 4]
The Magic Johnson of the game
These lames don't want to play with me
Smile on your face, but I really know you hatin' me
I know you mad, cause I'm sick, and it's plain to see, it's me

[Hook 6x]

[Guitar Outro: Curt Chambers][Produced by brandUn DeShay]

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Introducin' Chance the Ruthless
Trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid
Loosely based on music
Swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BANG)
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of illusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended
Last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley
Always in the hallway, so I never been classy
(Ha ha ha) Shut up

[Hook]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(Igh, igh, igh, igh!)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Acid, Acid, get it? Acid
Melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper
If this was work, I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with jack
Lickety-split, Look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back
Give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra
I eat it like Idi Amin, ya kna wha' mean
Hit me back when that mean shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Introducin', It’s Bronsonlino
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino
3 Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh
I rep the East Coast, I got a team of hoes like Pat Summit
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer (Get to the chopper!)
I splash summer like a fast brother
With a number on his back, ain’t no fumblin', in fact, I’m -
Back, acid in my hat
Shoot then pass the gat, it's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef’s salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn’t help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on

[Outro]
Suck my motherfucking dick, it's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby
Blow me[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Think I can see a fucking halo, about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano, some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches, he got special needs
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping
Al be fucking with the fader, sipping mind eraser
Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it
Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public
We the Republican government, abundance of substance
Having consumption to fuck a bitch
You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

[Hook: Action Bronson]
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle

[Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first
After rapping take my people out for octopus
We all deserve it; dedication to the fam
Don't hold your hand out for nothing if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
Blow the dice, roll them chips, hit another trip
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the 6 in the summertime
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma
My look is Jay Buhner, dawggy, cause some of us just age sooner
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio, I fixed the game
Between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor, chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
I came from that basement, now look at this view
Making this money, blowing it all
Fuck what you did, just show me results

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]
Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly mothafucka
Leather to the foot, horses I lead 'em to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no mothafuckin' faking that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs

[Outro: Loaded Lux]
You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name say "Crack dealing trap nigga
Slash cap peeler, back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my minds first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir
Taps liquor the pass 'til it
Goes around the room like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
Yoohoo, I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure to look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you Beastie Boy
You can't match your killer with that wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were strucking blows, bloody nose for your honey rolls
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You're a bully's Best Day Ever
With those Nike's on your feet
Coming through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga give me that shit
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac
With the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?Verse 1:Labba
Uhh Who test these fat niggas
I beat ya bitch with a bat nigga
Fuck yall the AK to ya liver
Motherfucker sayin they gon pray
And they pray for my downfall
Rob a rapper for his Audemar
He fuckin ran lke the Autobahn
Pussy nigga this is Crookton
You just muthafuckin know
If you come touch mine
See the coroner line
The lastest to fucking pound pavements
Phantom engraved need the hoody for the Ac
Laser cut key shit these are the evils
The liquid diesel call it Pimp C'page
UGK forever tougher than leather
Nobody does it better Im sonnin'em
They against me like abortion
Fuck yall haters fuck those rockin gators

(Verse 2:Action Bronson)
Good coke cut cold cuts
There she blows the bottom of my whole nuts
Now every table set and laced up with the gold crust
Stuff some drugs in the middle of the ho's butt
Cuz we wildin' off the boat Albanians cannibals Queens county
Stick you for your rings only sing for a kings bounty
Cuz if you wanted to cop it i feed them brownies
Oakleys be the optics eat tapas and drink cabby
Baby veal neck stew wildin' like Winona Ryder
Face in magazines divas dug Al down at the slut house
Enter her butt mouth breakin' an bust down
Open my eyes inhale and blow the drugs out
80's bush smoke blue mercedes kush
Ass fat waist small like an asian foot
Kick shit Miroslav Klose i drink piss of the purified cobra

(Verse 3:Ike Eyes)
Stock in the block skyrocketed thru the roof
Core of the rotten apple eating at the roots
Solo acts and duos I eat up your whole group
Backpack trapper duece fever in the boot
My ol' head taught me all the tricks to the drug trade
Dont make the same mistakes that love made
Your best friends a dollar in your pockets
And ya stash ain't right if you can fit it in your wallet
Hank Moody of rappin fat bitch stank booty clappin
Back to the live action
Break night take flight pipe smokers rail rippers
Hungry hounds on the trail tail sniffers
It was all love til' the drugs blurred my thinking
Lap full of work in the backseat of a Lincoln
Waitin' at the coast for the loads to wash ashore
This ain't enough Im gonna need more 1000 pounds

(Outro scrathces by PF Cuttin)[Produced by: Buckwild]

[Hook: Meyhem Lauren](x2)
Doin' a 100 on a highway
Fast cake, I do it my way
Fast cake, I do it my way
Head to toe labels on deck, do it the fly way

[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Predatory glory feastin' on endangered species
I take a shit right after birth a million dollar feces
Fuck ya habitat, it's really where your ratchet at
My ego is so lethal that a ? will try to damage that
So Queens that you can feel me
So dope that you could deal me
Do a donut then I hop up out the Benz
Still in the hood like ATM's that give tens
Crime infused paragraphs with expensive pens
Now we chasin' ends my niggas need extensive ends
Refined thug salary, fine rug gallery
Purchase courtesy of the street, real niggas proud of me
Strategize always think wise but never cowardly
Powerfully shower me with the finest different designers
Leanin' back were shinin' like we drivin' in recliners
It's your highness the flyest, so acrobatic were manuverin'
Catch me freak dancin' in the club, I got the Ruger in

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The kings portrait laid inside the hand car frame
Hung over the fireplace admired by the peasants
Present some evidence for things you mention in your sentences
I'm devilish, the foot is like a leather fish
Smoke wax like a Brazilian salon
Stand on the corner after three in the morn'
All thermal on, your money shorter than a gerbil's arm
Fuck around, throw a gerbil in your mom
Yo change the channel put the Ninja Turtles on
Arrange the battle, blaze the saddles
Bust your motherfuckin' ass in basketball wearin' sandals
Gun at the side by the love handles
Bring me your face so I could fuck it hard
Then do a 720 in the mustard Saab
The bitch touched my hair said I must be god
That bitch touched my hair said I must be god


[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Deluxe fresh, hop out the Lex flexin' ya ex
She's left stretched properly sexed fuck it I'm blessed
Checks comin' in, street money movin' at the same time
Gain shine whenever my feet step on the concrete
Seated outside drinkin' wine chewin' on conch meat
While cops heat corners and streets, we in the bistro
Thinkin' that ? don't fuck around I'll let my heat go
Cuban linx hand made, nigga I'm clan paid
Fuck a couple ratchets got lost to my man Rae
Seven thousand feathers in a eagle
The one I lost didn't have none but it was evil
Niggas try showin' fake love, but they be see through
Deceitful, my people
Still the same crew from back then
Sellin' drugs out the hoopty with a black Mac-10
Unique ringtones, obscure trap phones
You wack rap clones never had a backbone

[Hook][Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I'm smoking big killa on the Clearwater beach
And every time I speak I hear "Go ahead your honor, preach."
I'm too hot for you niggas not to acknowledge me
The prodigy could talk a married bitch out of monogamy
I'm out of reach but your posture ain't looking promising
I'm pressing pussies, gynecology, you niggas robbing me
I deserve respect, cut a check, fuck and investment meet
For all the mess it has to for tracks I handle recklessly
I'm Glen Rice from the corner, three, in there
Swimwear twisted like Dub-C chin hair

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I payed Holyfield to take the dive
Fix the drug test, we getting richer
Blood or a spritzer
Cherry oak wood shifter
In a Jaguar, shoes are made from Babar
Roll the lethal
Seats in the Regal same color as Mario Van Peebles
I'm like a young Stephen Seagal
My favorite move's a clothesline
Dragon jacket, hair slicked back when it's go time
Motherfucker I'm a great artist
I fixed the game between Georgia Tech and Wake Forrest

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Fly shit we make that, Marvel we bake that
Pull a shotty, leave your body where the lake's at
Staying foul places, strip clubs with meth faces
All my fam's thumbs smell like gloves that catch cases
Not trying to glorify, but my story's obnoxious
Y'all faggot rappers wash your faces in a box of sausage
Surpreme server, bare burger when we order ostrich
Opposite of niggas poppin' shit cause we pop lips for gossip
Fluent Jewish lock it, gun black like Lewis Gossett
Predict the profit so I prophesize the fucking profit

[Verse 4: Roc Marciano]
Plush thoughts flood to Christopher Cross
Throw out the Rollie with the salt, park the Renault
Your number was called
I grip the nine iron like golf
Wipe 'em off
At night ride the white horse with the torch
You bleed out by the court while I've leaving court
Defeat of course, my cohorts snort
Pop a wart and read the robber port
Drive a quattroporte
Step on the product with the Rockports
Spark a Newport
Whip up a stew, this is food for thought
Pursue the course and floss in the newest Porsche

[Verse 5: Despot]
Tell your stories running, walking isn't fast enough
These cats will lap you up like milk out of a plastic cup
You bastards stuck somewhere between fragile and half a chump
I'd bet you fucks a thousand bucks your dad wishes he's wrapped it up
We rapscallions, like a bundle of onions
How you find the gumption to be out here trying to function
I fixed the game dog, I'm neutering the poodle
Got the ruger to your noodle and the goons are yelling "Who you?"
The rental car's window's rose-tinted, dope in it
The credit card got a tank in it, no limit[Verse 1]
Medication in the plastic bag
I'm a man motherfucker, you're a half a fag
My chest is hairy like the Cubans rocking silk
In the 80s on Miami beach
You're just a rabbit that be captured by the falcons feet
I hunt for the meat see me we can thump in the street
Fuck around leave you slumped in your seat
Cause we're coming from Queens, every platter is Zagat rated
Caramelized up, bulls are getting castrated
Hold up hold up someone pass the weed to me
Fuck a routine I'm switching up the scenery
Boats with decks strictly using throats for sex
Yoga stretch, open pussy like a sofa bed
Key lime spear fishing off the Yucatan
Grab a barracuda higher than a parachuter
Pair of shooters Anthony and Harper
Caciocavalli dog I'm sharper than the archer
I'm an artisan down for bi-partisan
Cause everyone getting paid see me with the freshest fade
Charles Oakley gecko belts and durangos
I fuck good and make big seeds like a mango
NFL ready, sculpted for the clay court
Simple spaghetti shifting in the gray sport
Suck my dick bitch real good
Mother fuck a kid, Action Bronsolino suck my balls

[Verse 2]
No disrespect ma, I'm tryna eat the pussy
Lift your legs over you head so I can taste the tushy
King Thrust is what they call me at the hooker house
260 pounds of pressure right in a hookers mouth
5'7" with the ass of of a horse
Put it in from behind its the salad I toss
She ride me like a maniac
Best believe the bitch a brainiac
She known to keep a fresh shaven cat
Milk chocolate and her eyes like the sun
Keep a loaded 22 inside her thighs and her buns
Her pussy lips are tight just like the box of a nun
She'll have a fiend itchy and scratchy for rock in the slums
Boosting in the boostiere
I give my favorite Goose away just to get a closer look at how the juices spray
Fucking tired can't go no more
My raps are marinated days ahead
Jalapeno cream cheese on the raisin bread
That's for breakfast
I've got a death wish you never catch Bronsolino in a necklace
I'm on the block like tetris
Caddy green Northstar engine
Pecan pie seats Lord I'm a legend
Queens shit man[Produced by Hit-Boy]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm mmm,"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big KRIT]
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like bees in this track
Just smoked out, I ain't talking 'bout what you toke out
Get choked out fo'rilly, thinking that this shit a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't acting on the scene niggas scream
The actions ain't screened, just well schemed
I'm trying to have wealth for my well being by 18
Pockets healthy green, what the fuck is 12 beans?
I need the cake and cream, stakes is high like fiends off a dream
Jet streaming having cuisine with the best seasons
It's the vet season carry a vest you know the reason
I'm in Chiraq and I'm getting blown like the breezes
Your chicken strip tease us, thighs leg and the breast part is the cleavage
She even lick it down to the bone marrow
She in love but I don't got a bow and arrow
I'm known to jack the booty like I'm sparrow
They ain't trying to see me in the battle, they lines is too narrow
They couldn't even outshine my shadow
They don't want the beef nigga let alone the cattle
They just want to ride the saddle, it's so sad though

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Hammers present, you gettin' wrapped up
Uhh, jump out the Mack truck, black tux
Go 'head and act up, drink the blood out of the brass cup
Your jewels are fake those are glass cut
No snakes keep the grass cut
Thick dominican women skin cinnamon with they ass up
Sick spinning, I stay shitting like a sick pigeon
Different colors glisten of the wrist prism
Blicker off the hip hit 'em, spun 'em
Chopped an onion, in the process peeped the diagnostics
See my shorty draped up in an ostrich
Smoking weed from the doctor
As I sit on a train to Paris draped in fabric like an arabic
Mommy always knew her boy was talented
Come off tour give her 20 thou for nothing
Cause it's nothing to me I'm something to see
Sunk in the sea, Duncans on feet
Shits are shiny take a shower rather dump in the heat
Jump out the jeep looking fly like a bundle of geese, jeez
I'm on some shit
I'm talking 7 series triplets, bitches with military fitness
And my girl a shooter like Chamique Holdsclaw
With coke in the door, she used to play ball
For Christ the King, selling drugs got her the icy ring though
Me

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
The last black hippy to get a wiki
I'm in your city getting a hickey from your chick in her Vickies
Don't try act like I ain't popping homie
My style like Mandela meets Monster Kody
Cop backwoods by the box bro, OG only
Drop 460 for a zip, need 2 to be cozy
I hate to stunt but look me up
Evil Knievel ain't much when I do my stuff
Polo tee polo black cologne
Burberry by my nuts she won't leave me lone
The Levi's was on sale, but I ain't flexing hard
Flexing, never had a 24 Hour Fitness card
I told myself I wouldn't flip I made a little bit
I'm no magician but I hope this blue dolphin do the trick
Behind the mic with a thizz face
You take your Mrs. through my entrance thats a mistake
I got it bad like Usher Raymond
Middle finger to the plaintiff, screaming Top Dawg Entertainment
Look I don't know why you niggas hating
I take that back cause I know why you niggas hating
I just said it cause I likeded how it came in
I even used likeded, that ain't a word, I'm just saying
I got to be the greatest on this land, I spell high with
3 I's and I'll never never land
The rap Mike Jack, Peter Pan with 28 grams
Hendrix with no guitar, Albert on Adderall
Yeah, jug
Smoke 'til I'm Weezy don't worry what's in my cup

[Verse 4: Travis Scott]
Speeding, and damn I’m leaning, on the Kawasaki
In the lobby, got me dro codinein’, out in Abu Dabi
Chain beaming, hope it ain't anemic, cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, just me and four women, and we all playing hockey
Blow Scott La Flame, pimpin, no cane
Rocking the chain and hood with no pass
Fucked up the flow, nothing but fam cause niggas be hoes
Have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ when I stock it up and then grow
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs, my nigga Yeezy done taught me that
Young niggas in the Soho House spilling booze wherever the Barbies at
Damn homie, this a movie nigga, take a picture or somethin', where your Kodak at?
Scottie is tokin and swimming with women, he writing, producing, then score and filming it
Oh god, my god, this shit be like God-level
Nigga you talking money nigga, stacking several
Bonds over billions niggas the real is in the building
With Ye and Hova niggas know what the deal is
The deal is nigga the realest
Young Scott the rock, rocking from the Phyllis
Got my nigga Bronson, Joey, Ab-Soul
And you know a nigga pockets getting swole on the road, yup[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yeah, nights from Norway
Hookers in the hallway
Fiends tap dancin' on the strip like its Broadway
Ash the hundred dollar joint, inhale the info
Ten percents on the limo, doin indos, farm raised goat
Yo, farm raised goat, arm length tucked in the coat
Old 6 series bucket approach, 3 stripes on the leather
Powder puffin her nose, say you feel my pain
Really muthafucka you don't, I'm on some outtabody
Out of body with the Shaman in the jungle
Never cry over curdled milk, dip in convertible
Rock the leather neck, full length Persian twill
Shoot the trouble on the company by herbal pill
Gotta get it, gotta gotta gotta get it quick
Fuck her good, or she on to look for better dick
I'm off the hook dawg you fuckin with a veteran
Think different express my sentiment
Put you in the sediment

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Yo, Yo
Play me never
Seats in the Mercedes is leather
See she think she bad, they ain't nuttin' you can tell her
Uh, i ain't no regular nigga
If you see me with a bitch, you know she lucky I'm wit' her
She know she lucky I'm wit' her
Like a hungry muhfucka wit' a bucket of chicken
Heels is clickin, from Beverly Hills to Hell's Kitchen
The twenty cells spells lifted
The TECHs held different, the sex is a given
The fishscale sniffed off of dishes
Uh, murda material, Uh, the .38 scrape the serial
We sat down and ate cereal
Uh, muhfuckas are like sound boy burial
Fly face tone, steel vagina Grace Jones
My favorite clothes, My ace in the hole
Some basic ho im never takin her home
My statue naked in Rome
The 650 Beamer run 80 alone

Switch whips, 456
456, Switch whips
456, 456
Switch whips, 456[Verse One]
Five minute beats, one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat
Hand-craft the music, rhymes stay acoustic
Pies and Thighs on my mind all the time, roll the lime
Fuck rap I was class with my bus pass
Early nineties Tom Selleck with the moustache
Your eyes are blind to the diamond in the rough
Needle in the hay, charismatic character, far from amateur
Spider senses so I'm scanning the parameter
Straight from scrubs so my uncle is a janitor
Love my Mother, hate a motherfucker, hate a piece o' shit, hate a cocksucker
Stand beside me motherfucker you're my brother
Came from different pussies but we share the same supper

[Hook]
Five minute beats, one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat
Blunts stay fat, blunts stay fat

[Verse Two]
West Palm Beach betting on a dog race
Bitch with me big titties and a small waist
Pistol noise, shiftin' in a Hitler toy
Kick shit, young Ruud van Nistelrooy
Eating brisket, chilling at the bris
Knuckles like I punch walls metal in the fist
Smoking seven kinds of pepper and shit
Veteran shit, give Melissa Etheridge a dick
Stroke pussy like a cat lover
My kids are mixed that means they got a black Mother
And their Father's a G
Strictly Oolong on the tea, the shirt straight from '93, man with the ski
Peace to lo-lives Brooklyn, smart crew Queens
Sharp tooth fiends in the chartreuse jeans
Old Girbaud shit, pockets in the front
Waist 33, odd sizes out of Marshalls

[Hook]
Five minute beats, one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat
Blunts stay fat, blunts stay fat
Kid, Queens shit, Blue Chips shit[Verse 1: Maffew Ragazino]
Ragazino, S-R, period
Ain't a nigga better than him, period
Purists got me confused for a backpack syndicate
When I'm planning to take over the whole fucking business
The Great Black Hope, it's Maffew, bitches
Either I'm The One or The Matrix has glitches
How dare you speak on the illest
And neglect to mention that I'm the best
What the fuck? Do I gotta die to convince 'em?

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
A thousand miles apart
Just two degrees from a straight line
Bottles of vintage hanging, clinging from the grapevine
Olives pressed, greenish on the glimmer
Get me on the court, shoot from anywhere like Jimmer
Barrel revolution, spinning like a hula hoop
All these rappers breakfast
Steaming up the yuca root
Queens native, mention with the greats already
Don't even talk to me unless the fucking paper ready

[Verse 3: Homeboy Sandman]
Not another insecure MC, thank God
Peter, this is a phat beat, nice job
Congrats on the engagement to Lex, too
I'll be at the wedding shaving piraguas off the ice swans
The last part shouldn't sound bizarre
You've been in New York City long enough
You should know what piraguas are
The last bar that I'm writing
Is...I laugh while I'm fighting

[Verse 4: Kaimbr]
Flag of that new Confederate slash helter shit, uh
The concrete the color of Welch's
Flow so cold and my hope is that your name come in
Serve rhymes over crushed Red Velvet
Ma, circulate your pelvis
Show 'em how to ride it
Couldn't bury me like Elvis
Melt 'em, uh, I'm with the elders
Teeing off at Elkridge
Flights on my right
Minus off something Keltic

[Verse 5: Jon Connor]
I'm Troy Aikman and Pat Bateman
You Clay Aiken
Every flow is shocking
Take this taste to the face
Face it
I make hits in this game word to the 3rd Bassment
Every verse, not a verb wasted
With words, I'm a superb Jason
Murder tracks
Fuck walking in my shoes
You couldn't even lace 'em
Niggas gassed, I deflate 'em
I eat 'em early, they bacon
I'll burn a spot until it feel like it's baking
Think I'm scorching now?
My future's hotter than a Satanist
Haha![Action Bronson]
Here we are
Just us
I know you want from the first time you seen me in the movie
Hanging on the shoulder of a villain
She could flatten a village
You know I'm usually chilling out with Bruce Willis
Somehow, you and my man met first
I was still stealing the money outta my gram-gram's purse
But you were
Running the streets, letting the blam-blam work
Back then we smoked nickels of dirt
Nowadays it ain't shit to drop a grip on dessert
And you wanna tell the feds about some shit and it hurts
Fuck it, so be it, you 'bout to know Jesus
Turn this motherfucker back into a fetus
Phone's tapped so speak Swedish when you call the crib
Rich forever motherfucker I was born to live
Die happy, knowing that my family's straight
I hope they didn't see the numbers on that Camry plate
I been a grown man since I had a baby dick
These motherfuckers ain't saying shit
Close my eyes, spray the whip, hit your rib twice
Now your kids gotta deal with this shit cause this is life

[Big Body Bes]
Yeah, and I'm fucking here now
It's fucking Body
What the fuck I'm doing?
Whole bunch a shit
I'm out here wilding
Got a fucking 50-year-old Puerto Rican with me
He don't even know my name
But he gon' stab something for me
He know what time it is
No watch on the wrist
Fuck outta here man
Smack the shit outta you then slap your son's father
Your own family loves me more than you
Salute me every time
Every time I come to your fucking crib, it better be a plate wrapped up on the stove motherfucker
Cause you know I'm coming to eat
Fuck that I don't even want firsts, I want my seconds first
That's right, I eat right out the motherfucking pot
Fuck a spoon, I been eating hand to hand my whole life
I motivate myself motherfucker
Anytime I need to think about some shit man
I just go back and close my motherfucking eyes man
And go back to the sorrow
Fuck outta here man
My whole life is a fucking discography b
You stupid? Quadruple platinum
Oops, what's that? Another one[Intro: Retchy P]
Hopped out of the fucking s550 into the 850
Admire my transition bitch!

[Hook: Retchy P] x2
In search of answers
The stone is missing, stakes is rising
No silver lining on the horizon
The sun is blinding
Cap of the mountain, it was covered in snow
Ain't smoked the weed cause he was toting the dro
Fuck that

[Verse 1: Retchy P]
Down in the foyer, paranoia
Is what I suffer off the marijuana
I'm looking like I'm fresh up out the sauna
Jumped in the wave pool
'11 Jordans they was grey cool
The bay stool is what I ate fool
Unbelievable is what I turn to achievable
The elevator need a key to move
Her name was Sandra
Had two kids with baby fathers
I bang her pussy on the desk
Caress the breast
Effervescent when I step out of the villa stuntin'
The leather jacket dog butter like an English muffin
Dissembled the guard
Breached the fort now I'm at large
Crashed the speed boat my uncle was pissed
Guzzled a fifth, tossed the bottle knocked out a fish
Had her mouth to my dick, and the wheel slipped out of my hand
Pardon me fam
I can brag but I'm living sumptuous
The arm candy so voluptuous
Its porter

[Action Bronson]
Take That (its me, its me, its me)
I swear to god I look Egyptian in the Jeep (I swear)
With a three year conviction in the seat (Please)
Courtside Pistons vs the Heat
My hair slicked back like I'm Pat Riley
I'm like the Howard drumline with the black Tommy
Plastic money from down under (Mate)
Butternut squash ravioli sage brown butter (Butter)
Big body make the pounds stutter...
Two inches off the ground hovering a beamer
Like Bobby Browns mother (Damn you seen that shit)
Come fuck with your man dog
Serve dimes the size of hand balls
Rocking sandles
Then hit Scandals throw a Benz in the air
Then walk out, do donuts in front the whorehouse (For nothing)
All I want is raw mouth (Raw mouth)
Please don't stain the lord's couch (With your pussy juice)
The Grand Marnier pours out
Don't make me have to bring the sawed out[Intro]
*coughing*
Smoking fucking thanksgiving turkey bags man
Surgical procedures
Ben Johnson
You already know

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Sign my name with the feather, tap dance under the full moon
Smoke and drinking liquor for the fam that left us too soon
Just keep it truckin', searching all the nooks and crannies
No english muffin, streets are filled with crooks and trannies
Bam bam got a shooter like Lagassee
Emerald green paper that I split up with my posse
One hand driving, 3 gram smoking
2 fiend sucking, tea bag soaking
Strength of a retard the drugs are even stronger
Shorty loved the longitude, dealer bring a quarter through
Over fishing make the snapper less affordable
I hate when stupid bitches ask me questions that's rhetorical
Like "do you want to have sex?", well bitch, it's obvious
Her name was Jeta from the former Yugoslavia
She grew a bush like a baby plant
Still I ate it, just think of it as bucatin' and razor clams
Smuggle cheeses in a baby bag
And then I serve at a private tasting
I got no time for wasting
Just dick is placed in the slit no type of conversation
And prime rib from LaFrieda carved at the blablablabla
Fuck, fucked my last word up cause I don't give a shit man
I meant to say prime rib carved at the fucking carving station but yo

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yo my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
Plus she wearing a wedding dress a special day
She said she finally met a… Fuck
Yo, my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
And she wearing a wedding dress, a special day
She said she finally met a man to take her breath away
Well naturally I'm jealous, because I'm lonely
At times my only friends in life are drugs and the cannoli
My dad was right I shoulda listened when he told me
A walking contradiction wounds inflicted on me solely
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean-Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh yo
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean avenue, the family straight from Kosovo
That was years ago mum look how your son has bloomed
I hum a tune and then I'm hotter than the sun in June
And I'm just living my life but feel I'm drifting
Demons on the doorstep, lungs that feel constricted
Or maybe I should see a shrink and get prescripted
Or take the hand of God but shit I think i'll keep my distance
I think I'm frightened and I didn't even know it
But yo, that was a thought and I'm subconsciously a poet
It's perfect timing and I hope that I don't blow it
I pop the bottle of the moet, yo here's to me

[Bridge: Big Body Bes]

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Late nights I'm trying to stay up out of the orange skips
Great white sharks, the .38 with tarnished tip
27 years I never met an honest bitch
Slice their faces like Kitana and shit
Through my nasal blow the smoke
Basil on the boat
Hookers on the half shell, hundred dollar pants
Wind breaker jacket flapping like a falcon from a westward wind
Play the kitchen like a mexican, next of kin
Patrick Swayze… We out!

[Outro][Action Bronson]
Uh
Waxy
Smoking that Barbara Walters wax
Same fucking outfit twenty days in a row I don’t give a shit

[Verse 1 - Action Bronson]
You only came around ‘cause you thought I had some money for you
You got it fucked up
That’s for the kids
And If there’s anything left I’ll cop a crib
And If there’s anything left after that I’ll cop a six
How you think I got the art displayed on the dinner plates?
First course was from the Finger Lakes
Last course cinnamon ginger cake
She gave me head during the Laker game
I got her tatted, trying to erase her name
No, I caught her cheating, her pussy didn’t feel the same
She was probably with one of the Broncos
Or LeBron so I blew her car up
Soon as she try to start it up, nah
I can’t talk about that though…
Your chance is thin like the moustache of Puerto Ricans
Shooting guns with my daughter on the weekend
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker *laughs
Fuck
Fuck man
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Uh

Then showed him the gat like ‘you're gonna miss the finger roll right?’

Then I cartwheeled into and aqua car
Now I’m, sliding
Ma, your boy has made it, no more
Crying
The facial reminiscent of a lion
Fuck around I’ll send you back to zion
And I ain't even trying
Swing the wood wheel like lumberjacks
I remember back when they wouldn’t spend a stack on my rap
Now they want to wipe my ass in the crack after I shat
And I just had corn beef hash
Ew…

Eagles up[Produced By: Noah "40" Shebib & Omen]

[Intro]
Uh, yeah, uh, opportunity be knockin', let a motherfucker in

[Hook]
Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby

[Verse 1]
All my life I was a fuck-up, now I pull the truck up
Same bitch stuck up, now she wanna suck us
See me hangin' out the window, screamin', "What, what?!"
No more tough luck, a different cloth is what I'm cut from
Baby, oh, my lord
The cops chasin' Bronson in an all-white Ford
Shit, I'm on that all-night tour
Bitch, I'm alright, but I'm off that raw
I'm in a robe dancin' salsa on the top floor
You would swear I'm Puerto Rican, but I'm not, lord
Hot hoes every city that we go, singin'
"Heads high, kill 'em with it now!"
Uh, all I do is eat oysters
And speak six languages in three voices
It's Adriatic Summers on a sail boat
Don't even try to call, I'm not available for nothin'
Unless it's stupid paper, hop out the Studebaker
With Anita Baker, uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh, I feel so alive, I think I shit myself
I should kiss myself
I'm starin' at the man inside the mirror
The reflection shows a wolf though (AOOOH!)
Goddamn, I'm still cute, ho (Yeah)
All my women play the flute
Saw me plate some melon and prosciutt'
Left handed, make the Fender cry
Count money with a reverend's smile, the Devil's eye
Half-Cherokee and Gemini, uh
Motherfuckers'll dump heat, from Jump Street
And turn your chest plate to lunch meat
I'm in a Humvee, lookin' like a young me
Now these motherfuckers all wanna be chubby
I switch the season, now the hair's curled
Tan skin, I need a bad girl
Cause James Brown said, "It's A Man's World"
In a Transam' Twirl, the burner handle made of pearl
That's just "Daddy's Little Girl"

[Hook]Mr. Rosenberg presents
I got the fresh baked clam
Rockfeller Center, keep it to myself
I ain't trying to be a Yenta
Sour raviolli herb oil the inventor
? hit recline on the Sentra
Long road traveled all alone
Crying on the phone when they said that you were gone
Couldn't utter, but I heard it in your tone
Well now you know I got to get the chrome
We spent the mortgage at the steak house wyling with the creeps
Way before this rap shit, driving in a jeep
Forest green Cherokee, bad bitch and she ebony
Problem is she's smoking all the celery
ZZ Top beard like a lion
Leonidas body, smoke until the cows come
? sandwich, mustard with the cow's tongue
Dr. Brown, net worth about a thousand
You know the blunt like a Barry Bond bag
Smoking bombazzy, fuck ya Sean John hat
Baking out the car, ? contact
The red sen sunset long short hat
We queens bread like a baker in the morning
We getting money while you snoring
About to start the touring
I'll leave an orphan out in Florence
Elephantitis in my pockets, shit's enormous[Intro]
That's right (sniff sniff)
Bam Bam in the mother fucking building
Queens, New York
Straight up
Drop that shit
It's me
I built this shit
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Let me begin baby, my name is Bronsoliño
All I see is C-notes, silk shirts at the casino
It's time to take those leather pants off, this ain't no dance off
I know your hands soft, you're on the menu like the lamb broth
This is a grown man's sport
And, dog, I leave a motherfucker laid out on the handball court
I never brag and boast, I'm fire out the dragon's nose
My words pronounced just like a camel toe
And every whip in the garage laced
Keep that thing in the guitar case, bait the cops into a car chase
Crash the mother fucking Jeep into the venue
You better pray to God it's straight to Heaven where they send you
Ah, why the fuck would I have a bodyguard
If I look just like the mother fucking bodyguard
Baby hair curls on my forehead, leave your whore dead
Hop out that four times, four door and draw lead
I'm underground and I need more bread
And I need more head from some bitches straight from Morehead
State your business cause I'm busy tanning naked
My joint is shaking while I'm wearing bracelets
Uh, your words are tasteless, your taste is basic
My taste in Asics will lead your fucking spaceship into Matrix
This place I made is quite spacious
And dog I'm not the one to fucking play with
Hear me?[Hook: Action Bronson]
Baby my ride so clean, I ride so dirty
I'm about to buy an alligator for my birthday
My girl asking me, "Where you been?", don't worry
She said, "Baby I crashed the Benz", don't worry
I ride so clean, my ride so dirty
I'm about to buy a fucking Lion for my birthday
My girl asking me, "Where you been?" don't worry
She said, "Baby, I crashed the Benz", don't worry

[Verse 1]
Dropkicks out the drop-top 6
Don't make your fucking kid become a hostage, I got this
Stay in the water like the Loch Ness
Shirtless rocking a locket
Drugs in my pocket
It's all for a profit
Aim it and pop it, drive in a range in my boxers
Lay in the tropics, my girl pussy red like a lobster
Orgies at Hofstra
My bank account is like a Polish doctor
My heart is cold, I sing a soldiers opera
My drugs as strong as Arnold
They found her dead in the gold Impala
Hanging backwards out the chopper
The room smell like Nag Champa
Most my crew a bunch of armed robbers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I rhyme sick like i play with shit
I've driven every flavored whip there is to get
Feel like I dip that cigarette in wet stuff
I should be on that Sped Ed bus, layin' on the bed with a red head slut
These mother fuckers praying that I don't make it
I'm on the balcony stoned and naked playing sega
Prince of Albania
No money, nothing to say to ya
I push the limo to the stadium
Game 7, Knicks-Heat
Me and Spike had to switch seats
Cause he kept spilling Henny all on my bitch feet
Expensive bracelets where my forearms and my fists meet
Down in Mexico eating chick' meat

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No emotions, lotions on the bed sheets
I saw her walking cause I'm stalking on the dead streets
Trying to purchase where the shoulders and the head meet
She had a tight pink dress, her pussy was a weapon
Said she was a daughter of a Reverend
Well thank god I don't believe in heaven
Butt cheeks sculpted like a horses hind
Shit man, I think that I just crossed the line
Annual abortion time
Yeah, she got the tat straight from West 4th
Hereditary cancer almost took her breast off
And over 6 months she said she had a chest cough
Well I'm not a doctor, but I know that's not a good sign
Matter of time 'til she placed and laced in a wood pine
For years she was the hood slime
Now no longer having a good time
Under earth, she burst into a sudden birth
Oh shit, the facial of my cousin Murph
Strange occurrences, alignment with the sun and earth, yeah
As baby turtles break the sand just to figure out the meaning
Instinctively they heading towards the water cause they need it
Forever cycles stay the same, they feel it like a fiends wrist
Mustard straight from Russia that they brought in on a steam ship
My mustache like a Colonel
Take a haters facial and I treat it like a urinal
A bit disturbed, confessions in a journal
I'm sickened by my thoughts so it's tossed in the inferno[Intro]x2
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches


[Verse 1: Styles P]
I got a couple of niggas that’ll drop yo body
Ridin in Ferraris and Maseratis
Suits in Dubai and Abu Dabi
Catch em at the juice bar guzzling baji
They can chef it up like Emeril Lagasse
A game when daddy can’t play them posse
Martini and Rossi, asti spumante
You doin the science, I’m a giant just like Andre
Talk about washin the money like it was laundry
Probably smoking a blunt, sippin upon a Don P
Now all these whack rappers is beyond me
And the fact they think they nice; that alarms me
But like alchemist I smoke calmly
The army couldn’t harm me
Kill yourself before you ever think to bomb me
Yea boss of the boss, nigga Don P

[Hook]
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
-I got upmost respect everywhere I go
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
-I got love from my fans when they hear my flow, yo!
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably

Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
-I ain’t got it all but I’m good with all I got

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I got some wild Albanians that come through the block
In some slippers and a jumpsuit and lift off yo top
All maple on the shifter,Armagnac up in the snifter
Catch me in the 5 with the Shiksa
Leather vest with the patches all embroided
I tuck Jackie with the soy milk
Mad ginger before I rap, bunch of joints like a bat rack
You warm pussy and it’s time to take a cat nap
Smoke the catnip, fiends rip the plastic
Hookers getting bread, no G waste band elastic
Talkin business in the bath house
Hilfiger hats rockin stack house
The crib look like Shaq house
Uh, sharp foot like i'm John Bones Jones, kid
Tomahawke chop, red bone in
Grab yo bitch, lay nuts on the ho chin
Only thing for me to do is go in

[Hook]
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
I got upmost respect everywhere I go
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
I got love from my fans when they hear my flow, yo!
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably

Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
I ain’t got it all but I’m good with all I got

[Verse 3: Styles P]
I got a couple of niggas that’ll smoke yo boots
Ridin on a train, know they flew in the hoop
Probably in the projects or most of the stoops
You can see em in the juice bar gulping the juice
Motherfuckers will shoot like they playin for doop
Deuces wild get the bricks, throw em off of the roof
Crack pack and yo sneakers are boots
With a gun on yo waist
Keep it movin when police in pursuit
I’m out here in the Jeep ball coupe
About that life
If you ain’t, I ain’t speakin to you
About that mic, SP a beast in the booth
Like I’m indian, I’m the fuckin chief in the booth
Know the difference between a sheep and a wolf
Trade deuce dues dues
You don’t wanna talk shit to a bull
Get yo higher than the first blunt, head in the pool
If your automatics are semi, get a full wuddup?

[Hook]
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably

Catch your, catch your, catch your, catching wreck on the M-I-C
What must I say?
What must I do?
To show how much I think about... (catching, catching wreck on the M-I-C)
What must I say?
What must I do?
To show how much I think about... (catching,catching )

[Verse 1:Apathy]
After Ap reloads, get these rappers to explode
Readin' maps to magic roads with John Walker sat in robes
The messiah, crucifier
Who is flyer, There; elusive as Lucifire(Lucifer)
I fuel the fire, usin' music to inspire
Uzi does it, uzi did it, let my uzi spit it
Don't confuse me with them dookie motherfuckers gettin' shitted out
Spit it out, slit their throat and slowly I'mma bleed 'em out
This the Garden of Eden so best believe I weed 'em out
Just because it's pussy doesn't mean I'll always eat it out
Honkey shit, 'Moby Dick', classics you should read about
Buggin' out, gotta chill, 40 ounce, pop a pill
Turn your burners around like the cover for Kill At Will
Holy smokes, pour some liquor out and if your homie croaks
Heard a rapper bitin' my steeze, well I hope he chokes
Vanderslicin' everything in sight, it's like I handle light
And through this mic recitin' frightenin'
Have your family candle-lightin'
Waitin' for this rocket to launch, to try to hit the Sun
Have a séance in the Bronx to channel Big Pun
I'm a phantom with fans that beat up rappers I hate
You'd think they fat kids, the way they always after my cake
My jet's on Jupiter, my mansion's on Mars
I spend a Saturday on Saturn, slow dancin' with stars
This is music where you find a female and form a fetus
A rollerskatin' jam hand-crafted by a genius
And if you smoke trees, you're halfway through the blunt
Or dick deep in some cunt, bitches hate when I'm blunt
See the only thing that's badder is the '87 Mattingly
Scratch that, take it back, '011 Apathy

[Hook]
Catch your, catch your, catch your, catch your break on the M-I-C
What must I say?
What must I do?
To show how much I think about... (catch your, catch your break on the M-I-C)
What must I say?
What must I do?
To show how much I think about...

[Verse 2:Action Bronson]
Yo I was born to be a king where smokin' drug is a mandate
Made somethin' outta nothin', now controllin' the landscape
Bad grapes swellin' in a glass, yo I'm educated
Mind levitated, crime and family separated
My hands are placed right at the top of the chopsticks
Status in society is high like my optics
Say a couple words, the people scream for joy just to get a chance to meet
Smoke some reefer wit your boy
Never really thought the kid would rap
Now it's a simple fact
My flow is Hookers at the Point the way I hit the track
I'm all day with it, pissin' in the street
Just like my daughter at the park, you get lifted off your feet
My bars are heavy like Olympic liftin'
Place raided by siftin'
A-I-R inscripted on the side of the Pippen's
Never sniffin', motherfuckers need to learn and listen
Bronsolinio,hard cover, first edition

[Hook]
Catch your, catch your, catch your, catching wreck on the M-I-C catching wreck on the M-I-C
What must I say?
What must I do?
To show how much I think about... ( catching wreck, catching wreck on the M-I-C on the M-I-Con the M-I-C)
What must I say?
What must I do?
To show how much I think about... ( catching wreck, catching wreck in Connecticut)
What must I say? (catch your, catch your, catch your, catch your, catch your break in New York)
To show how much... (catch your, catch your, catch your, catch your break in Connecticut)
What must I say? (catch your, catch your, catch your, catch your, catch your break in New York)
To show how much I think about... (catching , catching wreck on the M-I-C)Yeah
So give me that reason
I told you I loved you already, bitch, what the fuck?
Yeah

Shawl neck on the drunk lawyer
Coke shits in the toilet
Turkey sandwich in aluminium foil
The game been fixed
I don’t play that shit
I aim that shit
If she looking at another mother fucker than you leave that bitch
I don’t play that shit
Hear me
Left hand is steering
In a Amadu Diablo
Shit I got the urge to get a earring
Image in the rearview mirror like Timothy Leary
Don’t even come near me
I keep it thug with a gun near me
Your boy been eating on the run clearly
Clear the run-way
720’s on a one way
So much drugs, what would a nun say?
And its Sunday
Shit, I don’t really give a fuck
All I really want to do is see my people up
Up to no good again
She threw the condom told me put it in
I did, fuck
I nutted in like three strokes
Shit, now that’s no way to rep the East Coast
Every day I’m walking with my head up
Don’t let up ‘cause it’s a set-up
Like Albanian marriage go from Haiti to Paris
The bath was 90 degrees
Tapping Heinies with ease (shit,)
Bitch please I’m the bee’s knees
Shooting Deca-Durabolin three CC’s
Peep the landscape
You can catch me in the trees like the shit for the pancakes
