I shine so hard that you broads cain't miss me
I'm so krispy, I'm so krispy
When it comes to bein fly you cain't fuck with me

[Kia Shine]
Dreads hangin long down in Memphis on my grizzly
Gone for a second, now I'm back did you miss me?
You can find me "In Da Club" but my name ain't 50
Kinfolk Kia Shine, look it's not a game with me
Been broke kinfolk, now I pop Cris-sy
You would do the same thang, if you knew my history
Haters see my champagne, now they wanna get me
The same dude they call Dusty, in V.I.P. krispy
Well my ice game right mayne, it got yo' wife choosy
I see ya Kinfolk Jones~! Look my life is a movie
You would say the same thang, probably if you knew me
I'm 'bout to hit the dance flo' my song on excuse me

[Hook]

[Kia Shine]
Brown Louis logos with the Louis belt buckle
My style Universal, they gon' have to ship me double
Respect my fresh - it come to clothes, I'm the mayne
Shorty I'm the reason why you wearin "Stunna Frames"
Respect my grind, shit I be e'rywhurr
I'm through buyin bapes cause I got e'ry purr
I ain't a trapper rapper, still a G from the hood
That Great China Wall, I spent a G on the hood
I got them year-up windows that come in the bucket
A house note on yo' jeans Shine? I don't care nigga, fuck it
You niggas hatin if you say I'm not fly
I'm extra crispy like a two-piece out of Popeye's

[Hook]

[Kia Shine]
My hair line krispy like a stepped out the chair
The kush got me feelin like I stepped out the air
I keep your body zoned, money long as my hair
Ay watch your step Jones, these nine hundred a purr
(Damn kinfolk, man your shoes super hot)
I call 'em traffic jams, people see 'em and they stop
Check your dictionary I'm the fly definition
And my stones so clear they in high definition (BLING!)
Took twenty stacks, got a track from Play-N-Skillz
Shit I ain't mad at 'em # cause Universal pay the bills
Ol' Sylvia cut the check now it's time for me to rock out
And my release gon' be bigger than the day they let 'Pac out

[Hook]

[Kia Shine]
I stay outta town but I'm so true to Memphis
A head hearty chop with the new true religion
Chain on my wallet and my shoes is ridiculous
Whoever did your wardrobe, you dudes look ridiculous
Polo player, D.V.'s, Zoo addict
LaCroix don't make it if your boy ain't got it
Tennis shoe fanatic, I'm the traffic jam rocker
Closet full of shoes you cain't find at Footlocker
Let me talk about where I live cause you know why dreads fly
Slats in my crib like I stay in Best Buy
I can flip stlyes like I flip hot cars
Look how I flipped from prep to rapper to rockstar

[Hook]

[Outro: Kia Shine]
Knahmsayin, kinfolk, it's ya kinfolk Kia Shine
It's oh-seven, it's time
Step your fresh up and catch up baby~!
Make 'em respect your fresh, and get krispy
{*23 seconds of instrumental to end*}[Hook]
Cause I'm lifted
Cause I'm lifted
Boys all paid it whole 550
Cause I'm lifted
Cause I'm lifted
I don't want what you want I smoke Swishers
I get lifted
I get lifted
Don't got none you ain't gonna smoke with me
Cause I'm lifted
Cause I'm lifted
Sniff so strong that you boys can't miss me

[Verse 1]
You ain't heard of me I keep the weed up in the air
Come up to my crib you'll see weed everywhere
3 boxes in homie I ain't stopping there
Always paid attention now they stop and stare
I'm fresh to the death dressed like a million bucks
Eyes Chinese smelling like a million blunts
4 zips up in the speakers of my trunk
Fuck the club owners I'm a chief when I want
Haters talk shit
Ain't going to do shit to me
Shorty on my dick cause my piff smell fruity
Don't want me blowing smoke in your face bitch sue me
Ate them other niggas
This how Pittsburgh do it
Keep a swisher moving
If don't nobody know
You going to find out why they call me Mr. Blow it by the O
I'm smoking on stage
Roll a blunt up at a show
While my niggas getting paid
Throwing money on the floor
Seen a bad bitch ain't got fronted on before
But I'm Warner Brothers now
So I stunt on every ho
Do a nigga do it bigger?
Why don't you go on and let me know?
Take your time
I'm a roll one
A cigarillo what I like called Ray
Smoke one sweet hanging high all day
Eyes all blazed
Ya'll about
Wait a minute
Still ain't found that answer to the line I was saying
That marijuana got my shit dry and all red
Really not the guy to try what ya'll plant
Might break you off
But no I'm not staying
The game play to win I'm all in like when
Heard a lot of talk but you ain't saying nothing
Middle of the floor I'm a shake these guts and
Fill my Swisher with a light green substance
Every time you see me man I'm blazing something

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Smoking on exclusive so don't ask if you can hit it
Smell that is great don't even ask me where I get it
And what I pay for is way past you niggas limit
Smoke in the day
What's that bad shit you flipping?
Crack another swisher
Roll it while I'm driving
Spraying blunt block case the Po Po up behind me
If I got some chronic
Know it's going to be diamond
If I got a bitch know she going to be diamond
Henny to the throat
Turn to smoke in my body
Heard that T-Pain now she want to be my shorty
90 on the tank and the jeans 340
Never stop rolling
I'm a smoke til I'm retarded

Jones if a carat, that's around my arm, or in my ear, or in my charm
These hoes Icy White, nigga that's my life
When I pull up at the club it's a hell of a sight
In a Icy White Jeep Wagon with TVs, My rims grown men
That just turned into a machine
[Hook: Kia Shine]
Memphis, Tennessee in a tech young town
North Memphis niggas in this bitch shake down

Put your stunna frames on, whoa

I feel so fly up in my frames, I done came up with a song

Oh forgot the sticker on yo' lens? Naw, that's a super stone
Kinfolk, kinfolk, you know the Memphis boys crazy
(Why you wearin shades at night~?) Respect my fresh and stop hatin

[Chorus]

[Kia Shine]
Check it, Polo horses on my shirt, Chanel's on my face
Red monkeys on my ass, on my feet Bathing Apes
Bathing Apes? Ay, y'all gon' respect my fresh
I'm a fly Memphis hustler, you shouldn't expect nuttin less
See my shirt match my car match my shoes match my lens
Damn kinfolk! You done merked them folks again
Again when it come to clothes mayne I be killin it
Trill talk, my frame game is ridiculous

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Now do the motorcycle (AY!) do the motorcycle (AY!)
Put your stunna shades on and do the motorcycle (AY!)
And if you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)
If you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)

[Jack Frost]
I'm gettin money, I'm gettin paid
When you see your boy Frost I got them frames on my face
Cause my future so bright I got to wear shades
And my eyes prolly red from the kush and the haze
I get buck with my shades on # buck with my shades on
Walk like a pimp and grab my nuts with my shades on
Cartier, Valentino, even B&G's
When it come to stunna shades niggas ain't seein me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Outro: repeat 2X]
Now do the Memphis walk (AY!) do the Memphis walk (AY!)

If you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)[Intro]
I gotta be honest though and tell the truth
That why I talk on my records, that be why I talk on my records
Be like cause I got somethin to say
And on this song right here I got somethin to say
About them real women out there, y'knahmsayin?
(C'MON!) Ya heard me?

[Chorus: Kia Shine + 'Kane']
Holla at me any time you need me
When you hear this song bump on the radio
I, know you be happy cause we made it past it
If you need somethin just ask daddy, c'mon
When sunshine turns to rain
You stuck with me through all the pain - that's why I love you
Trust me, you ain't got to want for nothin
If you ever need meeeeee - just holla at ya kinfolk

[Kia Shine]
Kinfolk, look
Kinfolk she came down South with me, suffered through the drought with me
Lived out of car, still didn't have no doubt in me
She went without with me, lost e'rythang she had (that she did)
To get me back on my feet she borrowed from her mom and dad
She wore the same clothes, even rocked the same shoes (same shoes)
She sold her earrings mayne to get ya boy back in the booth
She sold my mixtapes to help me get our shit straight
My gal trill and for me she'll do whatever it takes
She took a charge for me when I got caught with a gun and 'dro
At TSU homecomin at the mass co (cash real)
She on the grind with Shine, tryin to come up on these figures
I'ma keep it trill mayne, she realer than most of y'all niggas~!
Taught her stay down (down) and you'll come up (up)
That's how we live everyday where I'm from bruh
And mayne it's what she did (did) she know who she is (she know)
Anything I got I'ma give her, holla at ya kinfolk

[Chorus]

[Kia Shine]
Kinfolk, kinfolk!
See you my inspiration; on top of that my motivation
I know you got my back, regardless of the situation
Girls don't even know you hate you, I know they get so aggravatin
Yet you got so much patience dealin with me and this dream I'm chasin
I'm constantly on the road (road) I'm constantly on the move (move)
You calmly handle the duties, things you thought you'd never do (do)
Like livin out hotels (#tels) and messin up your credit (credit)
It woulda broke a weaker gal but you ain't let it (ain't let it)
Get the best of ya (nah) that's why I mess wit'chu
Went through God's test wit'chu, why I'm so blessed wit'chu
I must confess to you when I say that you the trillest (trillest)
Compared to any other gal yeah you the realest (the realest)
And mayne you got to feel it, just like my heart's feelin
Through this track when I be talkin 'bout this hard livin
It's like you was my witness (witness) now you is my Mrs
Anything you want you can get it, holla at ya kinfolk

[Chorus]

[Kia Shine]
Ay, you know I ain't one of these dudes
Who too hard to say how he feel, y'knahmsayin~?
It don't cost nuttin to keep it trill
You stay down there with me, you gon' get what's due to you
Whatever you need daddy got you
Holla at ya kinfolk

[Chorus]

Just holla at ya kinfolk[Hook]
All I ever wanted to do was live the life
Money, drugs, cars, clothes hoes
Brick, paints, pounds of dro fa sho
A young nigga living how he supposed ya know

[Yo Gotti]
I got sixteen 28 grams broke down to dimes
What's my life like nigga its a constant grind
You got seven eight or nine you can push on
Cause I'm a selfish nigga I want 10 strong
Oh no it happened again
Let me get a good flow of that dro again
Got phone blowin up like a high school bell
Plus the price sky rocket like dope in jail
Break it down in small portions fuck sellin a O
You'd rather make seven or eight or cock bound for da 4
I'm a hustla far from being a busta nigga
You got good game but still don't trust ya nigga
You can catch me in the neighborhood winter or summer
Spring or fall cause nigga I be selling it all
From junts to blunts blunts to bags and bags to O's
O's to pounds I'm just holding it down

[Hook] x2

[Yo Gotti]
I got 36 ounces blocked up pure yola
Make it times 2 once I hit it with the soda
Whip it up good in a beacon and a blender
Have it rock hard plus white as december
I switch up my raps yo I never go the same way
Plus I get a different prepaid every 30 days
So if I get jam I know where it came from
Rub my shit suitable never serve unusual
All money ain't good and all money ain't fine
Some money come with blood and some money come with time
Some money can't spend and some money ain't safe
Money in the wrong way I'll lead you to the wrong place

[Hook] x2

[Yo Gotti]
I got 8 or 9 paints and a bottle of kay row
And I woundn't give a fuck if you nod or stay woke
I just got back from the N Y C 250 a paint
Back in memphis tenn with drank
50 a ounce after I done added the bounce
45 get the nine and every dollar gone count
I'm a hustla don't make me say it again
I ain't trying to please a nigga I'm trying to stack some ends
The strong survive while the weak slowly dying
I'm congruent to them boys I'm out there slanging them pies
They never stop trying they never give up they gotta succeed
My life is like the saying nigga crack speed or weed

[Hook][Hook]
Look at my hair (oh), look at shoes (oh)
Look at my jeans (jeans), look at my jewels (aight)
All you can say is WOW, WOW
All they can say is WOW, WOW
Look at my car (car), look at my style (style)
When I pull up (up), I drive the girls wild
All they can say is WOW, WOW
All they can say is WOW, WOW

[Verse 1]
Hip-Hop ain't dead, it live in the South
It gotta be alive, cause it just bought me a house
It just gave me a deal, I'm just 'bout to come out
Said I just got my buzzer, I don't know what they talkin 'bout
Hip-Hop our meat exchange, it just bought frosty (?)
Shit Memphis then I'm fucked up, let us in the game
Kia Shine that's my name, but you can call me Kinfolk
It's your first time here and this is what you in for
A laid back flow with a whole lotta swag
Lotta folks didn't wanna see, a whole lotta niggas mad
And I'm just like WOW, that's too bad
But now that I'm here, y'all can kiss my ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man, Hip-Hop trippin, he kinda dry snitchin
He workin with them people, cause he see his sale slippin
He used to watch the FEDS, this is you flippin weight
Now you can catch a FED case or flippin mixtpes
And I'm just like WOW, this shit ain't even straight
I was gon' drive mine but I think that I'mma wait
I think I rather switch my hustle and flip some real estate
While Hip-Hop tryna hate, I'mma make some realer K
I'mma flip a couple houses, make a couple 100 thousands
Plus the meter mixtape game too overcrowded
Ain't nothin they can do about it, yeah my tapes away for free
And put it in your face on my kush DVD so you can

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Me and my woman go stunnin, Louis Vittonin
When it come to bein fly, yeah he ain't talkin about nothin
I stay rockin the best shit, all of the fresh shit
By the time you get on it, I'll be on the next shit (WOW)
This ain't about Hip-Hop, it's about me
Look at my jewels, look at my frigde, look at my mouthpiece (WOW)
Look at my car, look at my rims
Your girl say your shit cool but you ain't like him
I start a new trend, everytime I get dread
I write a new hit eveytime I get fresh
I'm so right now, you so yesterday
Look at me right now, man I'm so yesterday

Bag of kush cost 16 ?

[Kia Shine]
Shine is a hustler and what I sell
Is that hip-hop
My music is my dope, that's why
I put my discs in ziplocks
Respect my grind, I'm on night and day
Tryna get that dough
Like Ice Cube, I'm pushing weight
Every verse is a quarter, every song is an ounce
16's on this, sixteens on ok? My kush CD a pound
Get up and zip it in the streets and flip it
The time I ship it to the best store
That a nigga dun seen in the streets of Memphis
Shine out of Memphis, ? jones
And he got that pimp
He spit it so different
Yet it still is so pimpin: that boy got that gift
That boy got that good
And it's in your hood
Nothing but the best shit
You can buy ? like Memphis
I got that good..

[Hook]
I'm so fly, I'm so fly, I can fly..
I'm so high, all I see is the sky

[8Ball]
In the streets these thugs they hate me
Cause I stand so tall
I got DET under my stunnas
Smelling like dro
Cigarillos I stuff em
I like em heavy like my belly
I'm rolling and tippin with bitches
Smoking out my Chevy
Kush and the purple and Diesel
She say that is tastes like fruit
She say she don't really smoke and
Every time she hit, she choke
Puffin and passing and laughing
We ashing through ATL traffic
Look around, we downtown
Fuck around, they hit that magic
Eyes tight, head swoll, we so blowed man
Ashes shaking, look at them bitches!
Throwing money, make it rain
Chicken wings shots of Patron
Straight to my gut, straight to my dome
Can't walk, can't talk
And nigga I'm still finna drive home!

[Hook]

Whoa, whoa, whoa the dro
Puff puff pass, burn it slow
One to the head when I get out the bed
That granddaddy you already know
Bob Marley with the black Harley
You don't smoke? I'm so sorry

On it, ? hit that shit you said you want it
Gimme that shit my bread is on it
My kush tastes good, don't it
T-shirt, like "Wow!"
These people love my style
Before I stepped my game up I had to change up
Bought me a pound
Money, get up
That's the reason I ain't running with em
Post in the projects get it regardless
Wait on my cell: I'm coming to get em!
I'm so fly, I'm so high
Cut my break, I'm feeling myself
I just Wow, this is Wow!
We smoke til there's nothing left

[Hook]

[Kia Shine]

For helping me out on this joint
And of course I can't forget the living legend 8Ball

Once again, this is Tennessee's finest
Until we smoke again, y'all be blest mayne
Thank y'all for coming out, goodnight[Hook]
Cause I'm lifted

Boys all paid it whole 550

I don't want what you want I smoke Swishers
I get lifted

Don't got none you ain't gonna smoke with me
Cause I'm lifted
Cause I'm lifted
Sniff so strong that you boys can't miss me

[Verse 1]
You ain't heard of me I keep the weed up in the air
Come up to my crib you'll see weed everywhere
3 boxes in homie I ain't stopping there
Always paid attention now they stop and stare
I'm fresh to the death dressed like a million bucks
Eyes Chinese smelling like a million blunts
4 zips up in the speakers of my trunk
Fuck the club owners I'm a chief when I want
Haters talk shit
Ain't going to do shit to me
Shorty on my dick cause my piff smell fruity
Don't want me blowing smoke in your face bitch sue me
Ate them other niggas
This how Pittsburgh do it
Keep a swisher moving
If don't nobody know
You going to find out why they call me Mr. Blow it by the O
I'm smoking on stage
Roll a blunt up at a show
While my niggas getting paid
Throwing money on the floor
Seen a bad bitch ain't got fronted on before
But I'm Warner Brothers now
So I stunt on every ho
Do a nigga do it bigger?
Why don't you go on and let me know?
Take your time
I'm a roll one
A cigarillo what I like called Ray
Smoke one sweet hanging high all day
Eyes all blazed
Ya'll about
Wait a minute
Still ain't found that answer to the line I was saying
That marijuana got my shit dry and all red
Really not the guy to try what ya'll plant
Might break you off
But no I'm not staying
The game play to win I'm all in like when
Heard a lot of talk but you ain't saying nothing
Middle of the floor I'm a shake these guts and
Fill my Swisher with a light green substance
Every time you see me man I'm blazing something

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Smoking on exclusive so don't ask if you can hit it
Smell that is great don't even ask me where I get it
And what I pay for is way past you niggas limit
Smoke in the day
What's that bad shit you flipping?
Crack another swisher
Roll it while I'm driving
Spraying blunt block case the Po Po up behind me
If I got some chronic
Know it's going to be diamond
If I got a bitch know she going to be diamond
Henny to the throat
Turn to smoke in my body
Heard that T-Pain now she want to be my shorty
90 on the tank and the jeans 340
Never stop rolling
I'm a smoke til I'm retarded

[Hook][Hook]
Look at my hair (oh), look at shoes (oh)
Look at my jeans (jeans), look at my jewels (aight)
All you can say is WOW, WOW
All they can say is WOW, WOW
Look at my car (car), look at my style (style)
When I pull up (up), I drive the girls wild
All they can say is WOW, WOW
All they can say is WOW, WOW

[Verse 1]
Hip-Hop ain't dead, it live in the South
It gotta be alive, cause it just bought me a house
It just gave me a deal, I'm just 'bout to come out
Said I just got my buzzer, I don't know what they talkin 'bout
Hip-Hop our meat exchange, it just bought frosty (?)
Shit Memphis then I'm fucked up, let us in the game
Kia Shine that's my name, but you can call me Kinfolk
It's your first time here and this is what you in for
A laid back flow with a whole lotta swag
Lotta folks didn't wanna see, a whole lotta niggas mad
And I'm just like WOW, that's too bad
But now that I'm here, y'all can kiss my ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man, Hip-Hop trippin, he kinda dry snitchin
He workin with them people, cause he see his sale slippin
He used to watch the FEDS, this is you flippin weight
Now you can catch a FED case or flippin mixtpes
And I'm just like WOW, this shit ain't even straight
I was gon' drive mine but I think that I'mma wait
I think I rather switch my hustle and flip some real estate
While Hip-Hop tryna hate, I'mma make some realer K
I'mma flip a couple houses, make a couple 100 thousands
Plus the meter mixtape game too overcrowded
Ain't nothin they can do about it, yeah my tapes away for free
And put it in your face on my kush DVD so you can

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Me and my woman go stunnin, Louis Vittonin
When it come to bein fly, yeah he ain't talkin about nothin
I stay rockin the best shit, all of the fresh shit
By the time you get on it, I'll be on the next shit (WOW)
This ain't about Hip-Hop, it's about me
Look at my jewels, look at my frigde, look at my mouthpiece (WOW)
Look at my car, look at my rims
Your girl say your shit cool but you ain't like him
I start a new trend, everytime I get dread
I write a new hit eveytime I get fresh
I'm so right now, you so yesterday
Look at me right now, man I'm so yesterday

[Hook][Intro]
I gotta be honest though and tell the truth
That why I talk on my records, that be why I talk on my records
Be like cause I got somethin to say
And on this song right here I got somethin to say
About them real women out there, y'knahmsayin?
(C'MON!) Ya heard me?

[Chorus: Kia Shine + 'Kane']
Holla at me any time you need me
When you hear this song bump on the radio
I, know you be happy cause we made it past it
If you need somethin just ask daddy, c'mon
When sunshine turns to rain
You stuck with me through all the pain - that's why I love you
Trust me, you ain't got to want for nothin
If you ever need meeeeee - just holla at ya kinfolk

[Kia Shine]
Kinfolk, look
Kinfolk she came down South with me, suffered through the drought with me
Lived out of car, still didn't have no doubt in me
She went without with me, lost e'rythang she had (that she did)
To get me back on my feet she borrowed from her mom and dad
She wore the same clothes, even rocked the same shoes (same shoes)
She sold her earrings mayne to get ya boy back in the booth
She sold my mixtapes to help me get our shit straight
My gal trill and for me she'll do whatever it takes
She took a charge for me when I got caught with a gun and 'dro
At TSU homecomin at the mass co (cash real)
She on the grind with Shine, tryin to come up on these figures
I'ma keep it trill mayne, she realer than most of y'all niggas~!
Taught her stay down (down) and you'll come up (up)
That's how we live everyday where I'm from bruh
And mayne it's what she did (did) she know who she is (she know)
Anything I got I'ma give her, holla at ya kinfolk

[Chorus]

[Kia Shine]
Kinfolk, kinfolk!
See you my inspiration; on top of that my motivation
I know you got my back, regardless of the situation
Girls don't even know you hate you, I know they get so aggravatin
Yet you got so much patience dealin with me and this dream I'm chasin
I'm constantly on the road (road) I'm constantly on the move (move)
You calmly handle the duties, things you thought you'd never do (do)
Like livin out hotels (#tels) and messin up your credit (credit)
It woulda broke a weaker gal but you ain't let it (ain't let it)
Get the best of ya (nah) that's why I mess wit'chu
Went through God's test wit'chu, why I'm so blessed wit'chu
I must confess to you when I say that you the trillest (trillest)
Compared to any other gal yeah you the realest (the realest)
And mayne you got to feel it, just like my heart's feelin
Through this track when I be talkin 'bout this hard livin
It's like you was my witness (witness) now you is my Mrs
Anything you want you can get it, holla at ya kinfolk

[Chorus]

[Kia Shine]
Ay, you know I ain't one of these dudes

She got her own car and she got her own pad
If you ain't talking bout money conversation won't last
If you ain't got no guoop then you probably won't smash
And if she let you pop then you know what she gone ask
Where the where the cash at she ain't being funny
This is how she grin this is how she get her money
She love go-getters that really go get it (really go get it)
The rose mo-cycles that hit the club crispy

So save all yo game and yo cheezy lines, she ain't messin with you

[Kia Shine]
Put your stunna frames on, so you can see what I'm sayin

I'm sayin - kinfolk, they call me Kinfolk Jones
I feel so fly up in my frames, I done came up with a song
I got them D.G., Louis V, Armani and the Gucci jones
Oh forgot the sticker on yo' lens? Naw, that's a super stone
Kinfolk, kinfolk, you know the Memphis boys crazy
(Why you wearin shades at night~?) Respect my fresh and stop hatin

[Chorus]

[Kia Shine]
Check it, Polo horses on my shirt, Chanel's on my face
Red monkeys on my ass, on my feet Bathing Apes
Bathing Apes? Ay, y'all gon' respect my fresh
I'm a fly Memphis hustler, you shouldn't expect nuttin less
See my shirt match my car match my shoes match my lens
Damn kinfolk! You done merked them folks again
Again when it come to clothes mayne I be killin it
Trill talk, my frame game is ridiculous

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Now do the motorcycle (AY!) do the motorcycle (AY!)
Put your stunna shades on and do the motorcycle (AY!)
And if you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)
If you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)

[Jack Frost]
I'm gettin money, I'm gettin paid
When you see your boy Frost I got them frames on my face
Cause my future so bright I got to wear shades
And my eyes prolly red from the kush and the haze
I get buck with my shades on # buck with my shades on
Walk like a pimp and grab my nuts with my shades on
Cartier, Valentino, even B&G's
When it come to stunna shades niggas ain't seein me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Outro: repeat 2X]
Now do the Memphis walk (AY!) do the Memphis walk (AY!)
Put your stunna shades on and do the Memphis walk (AY!)
And if you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)
If you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)[Intro]
This goes out to my folks in the club
Put your hands up in the air if you feel me
Grind all day, party all night
When it's time to rolllllllll

[Chorus 1: repeat 2X] + (Wifey)
We gon' touch when we leave the club
We gon' touch when we leave the club - is she ready?
(We gon' touch when we leave the club)
(We gon' touch when we leave the club)

[Chorus 2]
Is she ready? Ay ay, take one of these
Ay ay, drink some of this
Is she ready? Ay ay, pop one of these
Ay ay, smoke some of this

[Kia Shine]
Is she ready? She ready to pop
My name Kia Shine and she want me to knock
Aight, aight; already
She ready to go and the gal just missed me
Don't sweat me - just, let me breathe
Ahhh - in a second, we gon' leave
I got some tricks rolled up my sleeve
I got some {dick} you about to eat
Now momma hop in this quarter tilt (tilt)
Don't pop you another pill (chill)
And make sure you drink yo' water (water)
I'm 'bout to hurt somebody's daughter (daughter)
She said she feelin my swagger (my swagger)
I said I'm feelin that ass (that ass)
She respect my fresh
And in a minute she gon' respect my sex
I told her!

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Kia Shine]
Kinfolk! Now this groupie chick was so deceptive
Actin like she ain't never heard my records
Knowin damn well that her whole objective
Was to find Kia Shine and try to sex him
Club closed now she ready to go to breakfast
After that she wanna get a suite at the Westin
Hopped in the whip so she could follow
She said she love girls and she love to swallow
Promiscuous girl like Nelly Furtado
Like a Shirley Murdoch, I'll be gone tomorrow
One night stand like a, comedi-an
You not my girl and me not your man
I'm sayin, ain't no sense in tryin to pretend
Check out time, Kia Shine is in the wind
All good things must come to an end
But if I catch yo' ass again babygirl bring a friend
AIGHT~!

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Jack Frost]
I'm somethin else with myself, the one night bandit
I burn a broad head up - and then leave her stranded
See her next week again - this instant replay
But this time she got a friend - well we gon' do a 3-way
I'm from Memphis mayne so the game come easy
I pop 'em, in LAX, lotus or the prefix
Well if you know Jack Frost, well then you know I love snows
Especially the ones that wanna hit me with the dough
I'm on Ro-se-mo', two rolls in haze
Lookin for strange love, like Brigette and Flav'
If you wanna get saved - girl go to church
But if you wanna get laid - then it's time to twerk
So drink one of these, and smoke one of these
You ain't scared is ya~? Well pop one of these
Drink one of these, smoke one of these
A blonde and a brunette, I'ma knock both of these
I told ya!

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Outro]
This goes out to my folks in the club
Put your hands up in the air if you feel me
Grind all day, party all night
Then it's time to rolllllllll
