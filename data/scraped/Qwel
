[Intro]
Don't be you
Don't do what you do
But what you say

[Verse 1]
Man I seen this sleek graff piece of Japanese baby shadows
Blasted black back against the foundation of half cracked knees
How could the artist catch the perfect and exact beauty of the little faces
From 10,000 stacked feet, cynical laugh
Musta had mad reach, flash freeze frame, made efforts
Remembered to paint the faded jump rope froze in half leap
Man’s canvas masterpiece, banana ants and apathy
Hands danced to slash thick apple on this last patch of green
Fat squeeze the master painter heard the ground cry out black streaks
Deep ash piles of salmon pink and sweet corn yellow
Rusty red dragon stabbed across my sky so subtle
Greasy cobalt streaks from black squares, puddles of pear bubbles
Puncture holes double as burgundy moons over dim plum meadows
Mint stamped oasis and gray aphids of charcoal statistics
Scraping scarlet across mustard crust, maroon and hunter critics
Purple mistress circles of tin spin under burnt umber crimson
Instances of living under vivid lemon wings with quick orange flickers
Flash! Ripped the canvas in his mouth in his coarse grin full of slivers
To join the outer phoenix with the inner, seen it
Initialed with white warm splinters, scenic

[Verse 2]
He sang so carpenter
How you paint ivory fences with red hands and hammers
The left stumbles like the right dances, his full ring of keys answers
Be hardest tinkling C, sharpest stinging B. Carpal tunnel visions
Listen with heart and soul, then soul can pump beat literally
Heart can spot mind, mind can rock earth
The stuck prey alarms the spider in her dark cave soft purr
The faucets spring a leak on spoon and greasy saucer ring
The father sings this autumn breeze
Strangle this queen that knows the thoughts he thinks
Constant pacing back and forth crawling this long hall of keys
His song is out of reach now, down-stretched palms to maul the beast
He calls his sleep out, twisting sheets, spotted monstrous mistress
Starving queen darling clouded dream catcher chattering snarling teeth
Right back at him, call it holy matrimony. Fire ax in sharp C
Laughing foaming at the soul swollen charred reach
Arms locked arched back, scarred deep
Rippling water, tapping feet on beat, rhythm dwindling softer sleep

[Outro]
Be you
Do what you do
Always
Here come the locusts
Here comes the locust[Verse 1]
Yo, check out this tape (is it rock?)
No it isn't, but I really think you'd dig it if you'd give this shit a listen
It's my heart and soul (you play your own instruments?)
Well not actually, but we got the sample from...
(yeah well whatever, it's all crap to me)
I know, but this is different I'm gifted, and it's some phat shit
(rap is ignorant, stop acting like you're black kid)
Yo, can I at least pop it in so we can find out?
(I said no! I don't allow that nigger shit in my house get a job)
Ok I catch your drift this shit is just my passion
(I don't give a fuck what it is, you put it in, and I'mma smash it)
(I said no that's why, don't even ask again
Keep it up and find yourself fucked up just like your black friends)
Yo, it's doper then most rock shit (yeah right)
At least it's honest, Ya know you're right
To like this shit you need some soul, so you ain't on it
You ain't heard of OutKast? Then how you lived a rock riff
Cop some Pharoahe Monch tickets and whisper mosh pit
(Yo, you're still hear? I thought I said to hit the road?)
Yo, fuck you Helen Keller
Do the twist until your hips explode

[Hook 2x]
My god speaks to hip hop prophets through rock riffs
'till white boys drop beat boxes in mosh pits

[Verse 2]
Yo, check out this piece
This shit is clean (is that so?)
(If it's on a building it ain't art)
Well what about the Sistine Chapel?
I bet if you tried to give graff just half the chance you'd dig it
(Yo, that shit is ignorant, and all it is is vandalism)
(Go to school and get paid to paint, not playin' all night)
Oh, so if it don't pay it ain't art, and if it does it's all right?
I don't get it (It's wrong cause you can go to jail you dipshit)
Oh, like they fed Christians to lions, how is this shit different?
(People can't even read it, how's it art, I thought so!)
Cause art won't listen it just lives Basquiat, ask Picasso
(Tell it to the judge when you up in jail dummy)
(Don't even bother to call me or your mom for bail money)
I ain't asking you for shit, just 10 minutes to peep some flicks
If that's too much to ask you ain't got eyes to see this yet
If you ain't seen Monet you just missed impressionism
When Dondi flicks rough as Van Gogh the lessons given
(I didn't ask you to express yourself, give up your cans kid)
Fuck you Helen Keller, I'll hit the bricks, you hit the canvas

[Hook]I be water globed gold sole host particle from flash flood
As random routed path as math magnified caves splashed in ash mud
Travel back before your wahs, laughs, graf, grass, and cash was
The dew on day one back to the past before your planet had a sun (Son)
Ran a canyon swam a mountain's mouth and sprouted out a mustard seed
See to me it's nothing, just as easily drown you or be what you breathe
Enslaved by plastic, now I weep and dream of the days when I once was free
The cleanest cumulus polluted and looted just to fuel someone's greed
Leaks your blood, sweat, and tears crystal clear freeze unreluctantly

From Mariana's trench to mama's breast through the dead who plundered me
I hum the breeze at high tide seas come and gusts the thunder sings
Under me your lives cry to my sky and plummets drink
Beating heart of the oasis taste it sacred thirsty subtle sweet
Perfect puddles deep sleep for worthy burning learned humble feet
To whisper misery released shudders huddled in sputtered streaks
Rinsed the filth from you heat spilt guilt in ill destructive streets
Conduct your sleep in pure silken ripple linen luster sheets
Or faucet leak rung peaking beat enough to hunt or interrupt your dreams
The father all upon this earth as we know it
The catalyst for Yahweh the drops He made to keep it flowin

I be solid H brother 2 O sole life preserver
Swelled wells expansion on the word thirst quell the flames of Hades
The last and first to burst fizzle crack or ice to ice burgle
Crash your worldly crash fast and return back to the state that shaped me
Draggin crosses crossed it skate the Bering Strait then frost bit
To coughin water mains exhausted bangin and sang the drains freeze
To cease the faint tinkin leakin change speed to demon shrieking faucet
Autumn answers "be my name" to grant the sleepless brains peace
Paint trees with gleamin fangs ain't no thing to rain sleet
Or stave heat or pave streets where your seeds play or make you wait Gene
I make panes creak where your reigns cease to streak when cans of paint wheeze
On hands and knees on fourths teeth on thirty-seconds beat angrily
Thankfully we ain't your bling, naw, you can walk this lake with me
To much waiting (weight) peep displacement, thaw the faithless that sank beneath
Fractal of the sacred three, me the block form as matrices
Fate proceeds where them track-froze predators prey patiently
Gold chips brick and brittle riddle PhD's that play degrees
But ain't got and ain't got to say to me
If only they should teach shiver snakes while they pay for heat
Though they breathe through faith I'm that breath
That they can see that they need that ancient seed

I'm that quenchin vision drenched and risen from the sun's burst of heat
Deep image that the thirsty seek creepin through this desert
Headed horizon line serviced and blurred beneath these birdies wings
Though the diverted see their pleasure the deserved servants see their measure
Peep me these lessons essence means pressure
Guessers need not flirt and see
I can turn this unworthy earth debris
Or work your levers
Who the Heavens turn through burn you meek debtors worship me
The heat to wet ya peep sweat to leave ya festering
Hot tempered
Checked battlers the catalyst through which the message breathes
Question who el crease swell the reference to heads of steam
Above this mezzanine of schemes deceit hell respects this cream
Not the bull spit cash cause really everything's acceptions me
Perceptions peak at threece concepted
Each a section breathe the lesson drink the lesson
Omnipresent streams of deep perfection
Set in presence effervescence wetted rest in peace
Said in me
Set it free the best reflected energy to the scent the cent degree
Where v in victory is five the second letter I is three
See in perspectives twenty twenty t is crossed respectively
Let the receptive seeBut brothers would it kill us to change?
And chain 'em up in prison when it filled 'em with hate, cause ain't a difference
It's pound for pound the literal weight
Stay down for now
It's crowns are minutes away
And hey, to each his image, with satan lickin his fangs
But sang bandstand freedom in it's business of slaves
Who paid Jay-Z and Mantan to give it away?
Shit'll take some new brand pants to get us to stay
Make haste
To the pinnacle, infinite, made of mineral clay
Today we're diamond, nickled, crippled out of critical rate
A little wisdom with some rhythm to pray
A place within em, livin grace as original as the middle of gray
His cynic cake and Antoinette with a tyrannical taste
Faith abandoned
How we wise if even famine obeys?
Now we're swimming with the salmon to calamity's lake
With granite feet, shaped from vanity and grammy speech "thanks"
The late great planet E
The hand of greed squeezed, fannin these flames
Nine to five will be the ant theme, but man, it'd be great
Time's a lie, Yah's alive, why's it man that we praise?
Anchor hands and canvas feet
Like, damn if we say
Standing deep beneath the, deep between the span of these banks
It might take a Barbie chant to get the answer dj'ed

But man it might change us to stay
Straight line 'em up and shoot 'em when they cued 'em for fame
It's the same unnamed shooters, through the hoop with the flames
Saying truth is the rain, remain luminous and true to this or lose it in vain
Computer Judas rather view it through the tube in his brain
Supersized, eyes swollen open, two to a cage
Mother funded dungeons, running on punishment budgets
Someone's up to something
Govern it, two to a plane for fame, sing it again, a cell
Scream it, a gain, a name
Losin it paid us well
Keep it the same and bang
Claimin the realest real
To reel in your favorite slave
Peeling the seal revealed for real
His name remains the purest
See the trees for the forest
Born to be the force of meteors or screamin it towards us
They'd sort us off in sections
There deception ignores us
To sort us to the new world
Or new world orders
For motherfuckers that would maim us to prey
Aim and pay 'em off as senators
The predators bait
Fate inevites the snake
Like, whatevers your flav
Pay the rent for your president
We're peasants or slaves
Which is better?
Richest debtors get a whip whipped instead of a say
Let it fix itself, while dangling from venomous fangs
Your name is sediment
The bestest threats to get you to break
To make the exodus from genocide
The letters we paint

But brothers would it kill us to change from vain
Jiggy, diddy, viddy what you give me to up jump the boogie
But man it might change us to stay the same shitty
Gritty, cities hittin kiddies with fronts, stunts, and hoodies
Sissies with a name and claim to fame
Woody looking goody, it's all boogie to beat beat beat
With deceit seat seeded and conceit's teeth gleamin
The truth gets diluted to me me mePlease doctors don't worry, not that Ruby liked to be burned
She truly was the dreamer, mommy's secret singer
Would just rarely let a lover beat her
Lest she had it coming
Well, once or threece maybe, that's it
But who's something
Daddy used to hum it with a smile on
But never with the lights on, long nights just numbin
Slutty perfume, and ruined pork roast, soaked wardrobe
Scars
Ruby grew up with bubble gum cheeks runnin
Streets
Sweet child, steep summit
Plummet, pink tile and all (Tylenol) a weak stomach
The driest eyeball, waterfall calm, dream caught, night crawlin, subtle "aw nothing"
The humming birds sang they saw nothing
But soft rain hanging from the plumbing
Flooding from her grimace
Image hiding in this furnace
Soul soakin in the summer like it's breaking in her sunburn
Monsters in her road home, she knows them by their number
Her daughter named her mother, she was weeping drunken tangos
Sunken under vanity table, in shrunken angles
Rusty angels fuckin with my day dream, the chuckling stain sings
The drain chokes, the day goes on
But not a day goes by
That she don't sing those songs
So the day you fly is the day I died
Today I die

Dear weeping Ruby, tears streaking cheek bones
He moans, he remembers everything, singin three feet of sea foam
It's getting deeper Ruby, we failed you as your brothers
Your genesis was a whisper
But exodus like thunder
And ever since the summer I died
I've been under high tide
I can't take it no more
This pain wading my time
I'm weighing me down, dear Ruby
Would you mind if I hang around
Dear truly
Would you mind if I stayed and drowned
Red Ruby
Would you hate it if I painted out loud
Dear truly

Pain staking His palms He can make it along
But can't make it alone
There's strangers playin your song
Can't wait for that long, in Yah's cradling arms
The Creator of all, imperfect RubyWhen times get rough, you're my diamond in the now
Lining in the clouds
Smiling with a child
Cry to get it out
The why to stick it out
Through stress in silent sittin bouts
For being patient with this weak man
While his mind is flippin out
Just a million miles between us, venus
Yah made your eyes emblazoned sapphires for me
Like ain't a half a smile between us
The way your cheeks spring up
Sweet tongue
Hung behind meek doves
Thinking thirst through this drought aloud
The singing clouds I speak of
The mother to your mother
To my sons
Your love is thunder
Sung from Heaven
You're my sun and water, daughter of redemption
Mentioned always in my silence
My asylum in your iris
Every shade of silk I dream in
Deep secret streams that I confide in
Spring breeze greet the green leaves
United with this dry wind
Like diving into violets, gliding free, no one's an island
She's a diamond tree
Pearl limbs like nag champa
Purr grin like myrrh samba
I thank Yah with words
But burn when they're not enough
It's the psalm I'd spit to Christ twice, wife
Your tears are ice swans
My gift to life, light like
Your embrace, the grace of white fawns
Arriving dawn that I've awaited life-long, when she yawns
Right palm and arm, the softest song sung
To the farthest heights and nights when he's gone
Nothing to offer thee right, like my life in this song
A flight to leave, no night of sleep, it seems to frightfully wrong
It feels like life's a drink of soul
To hold my wife in these arms
To seek the greatest heights to seat you
And decipher these psalms

Just a million miles to dream of
Your kiss is Indian summer swings and sweet plum
To see you sleep like Spanish moss
And hear you breath sun
Dare to compare you to the clear blue and the deeps I speak from
Like kingdom come, prepared for two in moments, life, the roses she hung
Light forms through ballerina fingers
Man, she sings when it's funny
Strummed like honey harp strings
To the heartbeat of the breeze and just loves me
Fit puzzle piece
Your cheeks are peach trees in Eden sleep in sweet shade
To make the seven seas between us shrink in a blink
Where we can dream of the day
Sea sprayed, Sonoma sunrise eyes, and tiger lily lips
Witness the Tigris spilling over and over, pupil solar eclipse
Big sky iris
Divided by the cutest nose in existence
Violet misted horizons and mystic islands in the distance
Just to sit in silence
With water rippled fingertips to violin
How this mile ain't an inch to climb
Smiling your winter pines
Pygmalion hips and thighs, and a mind I'd die to hide in
Flip script to it's just a twisted trip we're sittin side by side in
Treasure of Poseidon, who can find the finest incense
Kiss the edge of prism light
Like misses life
Thistle less inset
Crimson grinning rose
Timeless, chiseled in stone
Throne silken linen
Just a million instances from homeMan sometimes I feel the soul lift right out of my body
Who wants to scare me with a shotty, come get flamed like Mahatma
Screaming Mohammed at Ghandi, or rip you outta your name
The Freezer Burner make you proud of the pain, drown in the rain
The Freezer Burner sent me let me introduce myself
The speaking furnace verses earthquakes, typhoons I Qwelled
But dude I sell, Q, unconcerned with who I melt
It's through the turns, that these pussy's spooning like it's soup that I smell
The ice'll burn em like the crews that I felled, like they two by twelves
When I'm the truth stop trying to fool thyselves
It ain't surprising news for fools, it's just the boos that I yelled
Fucking with Chi is suicide, that ain't a bulls-eye hell
You peep my mic just like a glimpse of the after, skipping bricks from the rafters
While you're trying to fix your shits in the masters
Crimson incision rap deliverance rapture, mad sinister laugh
Ya little craft came in blistering fast
But still spinning when you get it, as if these nurses are rappers
With raps in their purses, trapeze at circuses, with behemoth, no net
Imhotep, the genius version, while you curse at your surgeon
That shit's for certain
Meaty creep up on that ass like FEMA, y'all bitches faker than Shiva
I bring the rain, and seen the flames through the freezers
While make believers keep the sheep leaping, I speak with discernment
You ain't the boogeyman coming out the closet, Freezer BurnerForecast say expect slight traces of rain and thunder
But my vain frame named the umbrella, stay up under
My name done brought nathin but bricks turned to mud and my fame
Done laid it crooked, lookin' good at talk I wonder can a man
Remain the clay of his castle all laid of sand
And dancin mong advancin floods a rushin rustin asunder
My pride to sigh the thunders aside, the commin tides
Arisin tiny safe puddle stride, runnin ripple, messiah of I
Failed nailed by I, shine the jesters I'm guessin
Anesthetized eyes fummble stumble feelin for heaven
Seven senses try but fail by the fourth hail try the fort
When forth cries the breathless leapor precious nectar cries the sky
It pours when it rains, torrents torment it sings
And pangs from below and flows the buds on the trees to say a name
I can't I pray, I faint a slave, the greatest knave
To talk about myself, then walk up out this hell awake, face the rain
They sayin certain it's karma, but we done
Buried too many good folks beneath the dirt to say it's karma alone
It rains upon the wicked and unwicked the same
Makes me think we ain't the geniuses at judgin we claim
A throne, ain't it just the spring to bring agape rains
Lost the fallen just to find em got it God just sang
For all rememberin, remember this, forgot some thangs
Love is what we do in truth it's true and not just sayin
And sayin ain't it just the spring to bring agape rains
Lost the fallen just to find em got it, Yah just sang
For all rememberin assemblies forgot some thangs
Love is what we do in truth its true and not just sayin
Forecast say expect a blood moon with quakins under
The thunder bangin pride aside upside amazin wonders
The vain say they got the umbrella, um fellas, yell the tellers
Splashed in ashes of askers and flashin cellars
Hell is fast upon us, humid, cast appaulin to humans
Ask if ya'll can truth swim the all the massive passin putrid fluid
Flowin fast, blackened cumulus zoom in
Yah bless the spring and strings singin tunes cuein blooms in bluish
Like bruises on this ballerinas grimmish grin, dimmin plumes loomin
Weavin wicked webs in the breeze
The deep reflections it springs, piano lessons the streets
Streaked east to west in spring bleedin wet on the beast
Beleivin leapt from his sleep faced the skies rains wet on his cheek
To streak the tears away in this breeze
Can't believe it but once he sees it it settles with ease
The wildest bike on dirt and shit to spring it pedals and leaves
It's like, ain't it just the rain to bring agape rains
Lost the fall......[Verse 1]
It's raining frothing packs of rabid cats and dogs, gnawing, clawing, scratching
Falling too fast to catch em all in all appalling
Thought, a gaseous fog forming blasting fog horn warning
Morning meets the swarm before the captain saw it all upon him
Recorded captain log tore the craft to boards
Bordered by disordered oars shortened roars
Flashing, crashing waves, blackish grey, this ain't his grave, anchor wade to shore
Fragile clay embrace its form, agile wave is grace, the storm...
This anger aggravates the stranger, danger grabs at the waist stronger
The harder he hates, this oughta be watery, just waits longer
When all that she takes, is all released, his palms reach to calm her
Soft beach breathing flotsam, lost screams beneath the water

[Refrain]
When the brainstorm poured him over board, he swore at that fate
It just made more torrent torment for him, and fortune wore at his faith
The rain pouring was the warning flash, clashing wrath at black waves
Sure he saw the shore through the storm but didn't make it half way

[Verse 2]
The lightning flashed the mast, ash and cinders, whizzing rapid splinters
Into the wintered tips of icy grey, a likely grave, she whispers
He shivers at the frightening face of mother thunder summoned hither
Come to get her best of deafened shriek weakened to tweeking dumned whimper
Another flash of bolted glitter, different side, the same inner
Reminds him pride don't float, quote, a sore sight for eyes of swimmers
An itch inside for every hint of pride, another inch to swim up
Heard the thunder just once beneath the purple surface his tips touched
An influx of rushing hints, thin lungs
Brushed against his chunking sunken ship of pride, chips that didn't splint much
This time he felt the thunder rumbling, chuckle bloaw, now you feeling me
Pride taste like salt water? But can't talk, awe, humility?
Who willingly changes himself saves himself, it ain't the they that they's for
Saved grace in through pouring rain, came vain to tame the brainstorm
Warned again and again and again, it ain't the they that blames for
It's made for me, myself and I, so blinding rays can break forth
We made war upon the sky, why I ain't surprised it stays warped
Entered the center I in pride, that my mind can pay for
Crashing waves clapping, laughing at the late great captain
Hate, vain, gagging, gasping, grasping at the rain to catch it, had it
Couldn't hold it if he had it clasped, with that attitude fashioned
Squeezed the soap too tight and mad, had to imagine that it'd happen
An addict to his actions, captain loved his life and lost it mainly
For fighting against those waves that could've brought him into safety

[Refrain][Verse 1]

[Hook][Verse 1]
Dah-nuh-na-na-nuh... yo
G4 for sure, we're goin' to war son
On his snide pride, lyin' with a smile and forked tongue
Stealin' with his eyes, chillin' back of the forefront
Will's design to ill the mind, but here the fourth horse comes
Screamin', "come freedom!" in this season of drought
Masonic demons meet in secret, we believe it aloud
Without the greedy grubbin' ducky hands, just feet in the clouds
Swingin' sickle at these anti-Christos keeping us down
Blingin' heathen at this bloody freaknik, geekin' to drown
Crowds of weekend warriors, but Meaty seeked, so we found
Never peace on this earth, reserved for sleep in the ground
Awaken only perfect in to keep the weakness without
But who's that creepin' in the teachin' without speakin' a sound?
The loudest deacon fell asleep and shrouds his speech with a doubt
Yah's fallen singer, fingers you down to scheme and a shout
Blinded eyes screamin, "why?" tryna beef with the how

[Hook]
(On the ground) Wonder how with no wings, but we'll both fly
Only a fool would bring war on the Most High (is that your broken wing?)
Is that your broken wing? Misery lovin' company, huh?
Hopin' we both die

[Verse 2]
He who's living in vain, though it's given us bling
And paints life in image, gimmicks in this splintering frame
Tainted gift, that fallen angel clipped, crippled and lame
Limpin' for sympathy, bitch-like, but his riddle's his name
His fiddle dribbles out the brittlest twang, the vain cynical
Derail the faith train to inflame your fame, literal
Brang pain, vain to maintain the slaves' brains
And claims of brave ways, but can't stay safe and hidden though
It's either beefin' or vegans or white Jesus in the middle road
Posed for sold simpletons frozen in a glimpse of hope
Focus dimmed and interscoped, floatin' winter's splintered boat
Notice hiss in intervals, lotus twigs and integrals
Known as bitch to flitty hoes, golden grip and fixing votes
Sold us six in Christmas ho's, broken scripts and videos
Jokin', just skinny bows, locin' shitty city folk
Hopin if the kiddies quote they'll see him as the pinnacle

[Hook]

My eyes open high to the bloody horse soundin'
Real birds and bees, honey, forty four thousand
Comin' on this cloud with a quake and a loud wind
Singin' with this Jesus to the drum of war poundin
We found him, now's the season, ain't no reason for doubt, shit
If you ain't 'bout it 'bout it, you're about to get drowned, kid
'Til all praise Yah's triumph: Zion, this mountain
All that realized, I find my ties at his fountain
Bounce on witherin', slitherin', ain't no side 'round it
Or way to stay out, to catch the snake on his down rip
With triple-six brow, frow toutin' this foul chip
Blazin', amazed at how this truth just sounds sick
Fakes ain't forever like the weather just sound bit
When lightning strikes twice on my mic and resounded
We wonder in the thunder ground without the dumb proud shit
To see you on His judgment with a Blunt and a crown, vicCoward human got a gun, he's down to shoot it, run
Bow before his outward spouting power
A flower slumps in the slums
A crushing flood on someone's love, someone's son, someone's done
(Buck, Buck, Buck, UHHH)
And the rain sings like, I don't care
And the train howls like, I don't care
But where them thugs at, so other thugs know just who to bust at
Some dumb ass brats who buck at other thugs, but miss as much as tap
To cap a total stranger's rug rat
Waitin on the bus mad
Not another mustard...puff...slug through lung and lunch bag
Fuck cats actin adamant about thug ass philosophy
But oddly enough never changed a diaper or diaper wrapped colostomy
Rap about zaggin rags, I highly doubt it
Let the dragon out on babies babies, now ain't a side round it
(I don't care)
Drowning flowers ain't a thing, not for cowards fraid to sing
That goes for cops up on Howard
Panoptic tower made of heat
It's raining steel nails through tissue boat sails and gales of dollar cream
Hail increase like collars, fathers martyred out of ink
Think how slaughtered daughters' mothers weep it out without an ounce of sleep
Salty heaps of sniffled "why's" crystallized round her cheeks
Sees the skies as just clouds now
Shouts in her pillow wet
But where my killer's killers?
To fill in her children's silhouette
Chillin, building hell, feelin well, killin something
Blood for miles, high as a horse's bridle, demons runnin, Jesus comin
Told 'em
Hold 'em to an unrepentant sentence, senseless muggin
Desensitized eyes, shruggin pride, to deny your lungs from pumpin
He's the hardest motherfucker, fucked a mother
Brother bucker
Bust at thunder in his slumber
Up to pluck your number
Peace
The Harvest
Rubber Duckers, he's retarded
Swingin his sickle, gleanin brittle garden, marksman sucks you under

I don't careUhh

Qwel

Summer heat stroke
Have a heat stroke

So this one Joe goes there was this flow that boasts he totes a gun
Dont know his promo caught some fingers up till he saw both of them
But now his shit is jaded
Played himself, hes gonna see me
Checked me once, stepped, said whats up, and copped another cd
Me be hell breathing back
He needs to ask to spar with Qwel
Start to scar your shell toes
I suppose its hard to tell
The battles half the lesson
The cats strapped with auto-mat four sevens
Beat you half to death twice
Send white light back for seconds
Rest when less than me ain't good enough
Hoods and thugs rough won't cut it
What if all this tough rug thug stuff ain't really what what is
Is it my job to own this fucking mic until it starts to melt
The dark starts to yell
I suppose its hard to tell
Start to yell back
But there's not enough mics to rock
He likes to flow
But the dikes are locked
On his writing spot
There's too many mc's
And not enough mics to rock
He like to flow
But the dikes he like to strike with mics are locked a lot
There was this other Joe once
Covered in gold front ego
I'm butter with mics
He stutters with ice
And wonder where that weed go
He showed prose in his time
Compose lies his rib cage
Hungry not just for my mic
Blocked every blow with his face
And now he spits with a limp
And thinks his shits a zeplin
The blimps his head wet to the ground gassed
Drowned, and unleaded
Found his rep, disconnected
His best shit was pantomime!
Jagged his chance to shine impressed
He left a fan of mine
Grab the mic for sale
And barter rap to use
But lost to qwel again
Who had to snag an autograph for proof ...

Just one more time
Just one more time
For the last time
Caught a heat stroke

Man second hand contact is cancerous
The trouble with guessin is
Doublin questions is
All the answers did
Ask your man to spit, shit
We ben-dove
No shenanigans
Brandishin claims you fucked inannimate
Nope the pen broke
But ain't it grand makin mannequin
Canned amusement
And all the while, man
The fans can't stand the music
The producers credits is
With the critics rappin crevices
Offensive
Get in line
We help design them flippin fetishes
The measurements are evidence ain't nobody tight
Cuz when he spit veterans bite like, oh but hes right
Insight precise incisions witness witty wisdom like
The system bustin out the seams with dreams are lived in this mind[INTRO]

[VERSE 1]
Peep my attention getter, like "why am I miserable"
Because my persona's see though, nah it's invisible
And follow with a line, And more rhyme
"I find you listen throught"
Switch to [?] And shift the inner syllables

A little pause, it'll give it a swing
Don't forget, include the little "ing" proceeding the "swing"
And then go "Sing Sing" will help you get attention if you lose it
You can always start again, just mention "revolution"
Gotta say it like you mean it, like it's in the living proof

Put something shocking monotone and flip it cynical
Like understating baby raping, highlighting specific syllables
Act sincere and rapidly rap weird and cyclical
If that don't work, act misunderstood or flip political
Compare yourself to what you're not, like similes, but literal...
Gotta handle angry with your hand to hand demeanor
Insert pop-reference here "Something, something Brangelina"

[Hook]
And for the chorus try to keep it plain
Emotional images, dead ballerina, rain
Or just insinuate, and keep it safe, maintain
And just state the obvious "It's like I can't complain"
Or try to be ironic, like "I hate my hate"
You can even use them words you just learned today
"Validate my vediety," repeating's great
"validate my ve- something, rain"

[VERSE 2]
At this point repeat the chorus or get back to the verse
But if you start again use the pace you had in the first
It makes the hook more catchy, trust me, with some practice it works
Ease 'em in but cookie-cutters will snap, start rapping in spurts
And if you really feel the track, say something mad and absurd
"I pour a forty on my shorty, write my raps in a hearse"
And then reverse the established pattern, "Cheese is for lunch"
It doesn't have to make no sense you're setting leads to the punch
Buy some time like, "The C in MC is for crutch"
Lead 'em on to leave 'em stuck, and then you leave them with "what?"
And if you wanna lie you lie big, the fans will believe ya
Throw in an onamonapia like "BLAOW," and there's your lead up

A little mini bridge and get your voice descending
See, a cheesy melody affords the ending
Might wanna read your bumper sticker here depending
Or name a better man, or just a dead MC

It's like...

[Hook PT 2]
And for the chorus try to keep it plain
Emotional images, dead ballerina, rain
Or just insinuate, and keep it safe, maintain
And just state the obvious, dog, like, "I can't complain"
Or try to be ironic, like "I hate my hate"
You can even use words you just learned today
"Validate my vediety," repeating's great
"validate your vebiety something, rain"
Or resort to self defeating, "Why am I rhyming for?"
Make a crazy blanket statement, like "the sky's a whore"
Hyperbolize sometimes like, "I've died before"
Rhyme some more, or flip the pace, re-iterate, go back and rhyme the fourth...I be water globed gold sole host particle from flash flood
As random routed path as math magnified caves splashed in ash mud
Travel back before your wahs, laughs, graf, grass, and cash was
The dew on day one back to the past before your planet had a sun (Son)
Ran a canyon swam a mountain's mouth and sprouted out a mustard seed
See to me it's nothing, just as easily drown you or be what you breathe
Enslaved by plastic, now I weep and dream of the days when I once was free
The cleanest cumulus polluted and looted just to fuel someone's greed
Leaks your blood, sweat, and tears crystal clear freeze unreluctantly

From Mariana's trench to mama's breast through the dead who plundered me
I hum the breeze at high tide seas come and gusts the thunder sings
Under me your lives cry to my sky and plummets drink
Beating heart of the oasis taste it sacred thirsty subtle sweet
Perfect puddles deep sleep for worthy burning learned humble feet
To whisper misery released shudders huddled in sputtered streaks
Rinsed the filth from you heat spilt guilt in ill destructive streets
Conduct your sleep in pure silken ripple linen luster sheets
Or faucet leak rung peaking beat enough to hunt or interrupt your dreams
The father all upon this earth as we know it
The catalyst for Yahweh the drops He made to keep it flowin

I be solid H brother 2 O sole life preserver
Swelled wells expansion on the word thirst quell the flames of Hades
The last and first to burst fizzle crack or ice to ice burgle
Crash your worldly crash fast and return back to the state that shaped me
Draggin crosses crossed it skate the Bering Strait then frost bit
To coughin water mains exhausted bangin and sang the drains freeze
To cease the faint tinkin leakin change speed to demon shrieking faucet
Autumn answers "be my name" to grant the sleepless brains peace
Paint trees with gleamin fangs ain't no thing to rain sleet
Or stave heat or pave streets where your seeds play or make you wait Gene
I make panes creak where your reigns cease to streak when cans of paint wheeze
On hands and knees on fourths teeth on thirty-seconds beat angrily
Thankfully we ain't your bling, naw, you can walk this lake with me
To much waiting (weight) peep displacement, thaw the faithless that sank beneath
Fractal of the sacred three, me the block form as matrices
Fate proceeds where them track-froze predators prey patiently
Gold chips brick and brittle riddle PhD's that play degrees
But ain't got and ain't got to say to me
If only they should teach shiver snakes while they pay for heat
Though they breathe through faith I'm that breath
That they can see that they need that ancient seed

I'm that quenchin vision drenched and risen from the sun's burst of heat
Deep image that the thirsty seek creepin through this desert
Headed horizon line serviced and blurred beneath these birdies wings
Though the diverted see their pleasure the deserved servants see their measure
Peep me these lessons essence means pressure
Guessers need not flirt and see
I can turn this unworthy earth debris
Or work your levers
Who the Heavens turn through burn you meek debtors worship me
The heat to wet ya peep sweat to leave ya festering
Hot tempered
Checked battlers the catalyst through which the message breathes
Question who el crease swell the reference to heads of steam
Above this mezzanine of schemes deceit hell respects this cream
Not the bull spit cash cause really everything's acceptions me
Perceptions peak at threece concepted
Each a section breathe the lesson drink the lesson
Omnipresent streams of deep perfection
Set in presence effervescence wetted rest in peace
Said in me
Set it free the best reflected energy to the scent the cent degree
Where v in victory is five the second letter I is three
See in perspectives twenty twenty t is crossed respectively
Let the receptive see[Verse 1]

Pearl shivers on the shores of Gin River
Just searching for daddy alone, he’s a swimmer, he’s just late for dinner
His shadow dances on the surface of rips and of ripples
The scribbles off to find her daddy like calamity’s normal
Find herself toe-tested these waters until both legs are piranhas
They hiss, “This one’s on the house” then slither on her
She questions, “Have you seen daddy?” he say “Yeah, maybe
But your glass is half-empty and that’s a pity pretty baby.”
He remind her of her father, watch the water get faster
She fall in Gin River, love whoever want to catch her
Undertow tug the string on her heart
The river freezing her breath
Fighting the current, screaming deep to her neck
Calling for daddy, they keep bringing her drinks
Oh how she sings, how she weeps
Tossed by the river, it’s that lingering stink
So many fathers with strangers’ faces and promises crooked
She just been looking so long she just forgot she was looking

[Hook]

She say, I promise I done cried him a river
Plus I prayed him a boat
He’s not a swimmer though he swear he can swim
If you seem him would you tell him I miss him and that I never stopped looking
I’m not a swimmer but I been swimming for him

[Verse 2]

Gin River playing tricks on her eyes
It ain’t a place to get lost, woozy, stumbling, and blanking it off
Dragged by the river, reaching weak for the bank
So many selfish hands to help her stand on her feet with a yank
The smile drown before she did
Like hey doggie look at what, what we did
She looking for something but guess he had what she needed
She leaves a ghost just like that stick in the air
But daddy dream in her stare
Make up the high, the water, ring in her hair
It’s thick in these waters, it’s thick with pirhanas and leeches
She say the deep’s a sink, you in it, try to swim for the beaches
Try to search for a day, days turn to weeks and weeks into seasons
And leeches turn into beacons, to each his weakness
She went for higher water to spawn
The river cost her her mind
She chose supplies look like her father’s brother brought her some wine
Twisted ripples gives her up to the river
To the cliff getting quicker, nobody looking for sister
Pearl’s swimming where no one can find her, Pearl within the oyster
No one can break her down now, no one can disappoint her
Hide where no one can find her, the Pearl within the oyster

[Hook]Oh God, what the?
Oh fuck, how many drinks did I..
Oh my God, where's my wallet?
Oh God, I think I'm gonna fucking...
Oh God

Now how am I gonna get from this bar stool, to across the room without puking?
Either barf-drool on this broad's shoes
Talking stupid, drippin', fall into a liquid ball of spew age
I know I'll do this again eventually
Which tempted me and tempted me to get fucked up
I don't know, but it ain't the centipede rich drinkin' spending spree
Shared with three kids at the crib skip the rent at least a week
Speaking in tongues to all both of you
In hopes to get a drink I think I'll crawl over
To a sober sympathetic ear to spit this lim-pathetic jeer
Oh my God, cause I don't hear so well
Is it a trouble seeing double even when your eyes are shut
You can time travel through black outs and wake up inside some ??? club
Six pence of beer, my dear friends are near
You all look like demons from here
In this mer hall of mirrors, cheers (cheers) (cheers)I'm havin' dreams of seeing Jesus on the Wilson stop
Crying' his eyes out, soaking the there t-shirt that he rocks
As the tears drop and mix with the blood from his palms
I compared his crown to yours and I began to scream psalms like
Soups open soul, soups open soul the non-stop
Unfold so he can roll and get his cross back from the pawn shop
Shocked no one can see him through his money green fog
And just then he disappeared from two kids with seeing eye dogs
They asked me who he was?
Well how should I know just a wino
Well we saw him in Border's tearing price tags off bibles
In this game of survival of the save souls
Until I know for sure I'll keep flyin' my tags with halos
He can't breath because my brother's yellin' "fuck your soul"
Cause in this lustful world righteousness ain't never taxed deductibles
So fold your food stamps and go collect your plate
Hoping that heaven's open Sunday as she shakes from hunger rates
Mistakes these bullshit lessons her preachers stressing'
But never once questioned how many blessings he paid for his new Lexus
Profession, heaven's a million miles from Chicago
We only see the stars when we're tippin' back a bottle
Only see the stars when we're tippin' back a bottle
He only sees the stars when he's tippin' back a bottle
Why try to sleep? We don't dream as much as yesterday
All our prayers infested and stress and rent to pay
But ain't nobody hiring' on desire alone
Try to find his way home but this silence is cold
Like the Vietnam vet with the tires in his throne
Eyes turned to stone holding' wild Irish rose
With the time freezes froze he realizes it's his breath
In a foggy bottle, To remind him he's dead
Left to get worthless in this bus terminal
He puffs an answer to his cancer, but the circle grows
And echos in the subway "who's gonna save us"
Sleeping under the newspaper, obituaries face up
God bless you for your pennies collect your spoils of war
Spoils himself with a meal he paid a quarter for
He's sorta short on... Can't afford a conversation
Sure the cloud is chasin' in the place his legs went
It's gonna take a whole village to drown this witch
But she floats over dreams, foams when he sips
He misses his children witnesses the buildings drop
Disgusted with this rusted anchor called the Wilson stop
Disgusted with this fuckin' rusted anchor
Disgusted with this fuckin' rusted anchor called the Wilson stop
Yo, if it ain't been in the pawn shop, then it can't play the blues
If it ain't been in a pawn shop, then it can't play the blues
If it ain't been in a pawn shop, then it can't play the blues
If it ain't been in a pawn shop, then it can't play the blues
Now can it?
I guess we can all play the bluesMan you can hardly rip that wrapper off my album
After how you ask around you sound exactly like you found 'em astounding
Pattern decisions after this vision
Shattering, haveta listen
Rock habits like the Vatican practicing fact and fiction
Impact, collisions, magnifficant, raps wisdom
Assassin hits passin' battle kids, not laughing with 'em
Tattoing autographs to pass apache missions
Bring your writtens and the kitchen sink
Mastered lyricism
Her it is, and battlin' me's confessing an ass whooping fetish
Held the best efforts from Qwel, punkin' pessimists
The funk and festered in a nut shell
But what sucks sells
So best luck with your rep son
And best up Qwel
Spittin clocks on commissary while you itchin to sell
Cause you iffy as hell while they wish you was QwelPlease doctors don't worry, not that Ruby liked to be burned
She truly was the dreamer, mommy's secret singer
Would just rarely let a lover beat her
Lest she had it coming
Well, once or threece maybe, that's it
But who's something
Daddy used to hum it with a smile on
But never with the lights on, long nights just numbin
Slutty perfume, and ruined pork roast, soaked wardrobe
Scars
Ruby grew up with bubble gum cheeks runnin
Streets
Sweet child, steep summit
Plummet, pink tile and all (Tylenol) a weak stomach
The driest eyeball, waterfall calm, dream caught, night crawlin, subtle "aw nothing"
The humming birds sang they saw nothing
But soft rain hanging from the plumbing
Flooding from her grimace
Image hiding in this furnace
Soul soakin in the summer like it's breaking in her sunburn
Monsters in her road home, she knows them by their number
Her daughter named her mother, she was weeping drunken tangos
Sunken under vanity table, in shrunken angles
Rusty angels fuckin with my day dream, the chuckling stain sings
The drain chokes, the day goes on
But not a day goes by
That she don't sing those songs
So the day you fly is the day I died
Today I die

Dear weeping Ruby, tears streaking cheek bones
He moans, he remembers everything, singin three feet of sea foam
It's getting deeper Ruby, we failed you as your brothers
Your genesis was a whisper
But exodus like thunder
And ever since the summer I died
I've been under high tide
I can't take it no more
This pain wading my time
I'm weighing me down, dear Ruby
Would you mind if I hang around
Dear truly
Would you mind if I stayed and drowned
Red Ruby
Would you hate it if I painted out loud
Dear truly

Pain staking His palms He can make it along
But can't make it alone
There's strangers playin your song
Can't wait for that long, in Yah's cradling arms
The Creator of all, imperfect Ruby[Verse 1: Qwel]
Since before I peeped the theory from the low end
Water deep three feet high and rising
Before I started smoking, I was smoked to my nose and eyes
When I stopped to realize where this ride went
Was it just the eyes of my youth like the coupe she keeps passing me by in
Went from straight up suicide to suicide, how we scrutinized it
Who remembers your walkman hoping there's still juice to rewind it
Knowing you knew the whole shit through and used to flip it through the silence
Faded tapes that faded away truth the desecrated grave she lies in
They never remenisce when she crosses over to the other side
It was a black sunday with a black moon on the horizon
Outcasted so the setting of the sun beefed with its rising
Ladies met brenda's baby a ray of hope to take some pride in
Clear blue skies, and ain't sure whose side it was who euthanized it
But ain't the devil happy as fuck?
Just saw her daddy get bucked
And laughed it up in the magazines that they never write in
Plugged her uncle with the same gat that she snapped at her daddy's light with

[Hook]
This craft saved my life and my soul
So many times that i've known
There wasn't any sign of light in this hole
For every rhyme that'd take flight from my soul just know
That there's at least 5 spitting behind it sitting from the writers of old

[Verse 2: Qwel]
She was such a good child, I don't get it
How she went from poor righteous teachings to hit the road to the riches
Amidst the ho's and the bitches
It's like a whole different misses(mrs.)
I ponder on the shorties around
And how they drowned in the driftings
As I'm sipping this crown bugging about the sound, and how what they missing
Is that shit without the glam and the glitz and it's glistening
Now it's the camera's pick explicit amatuers with canter to spit
When we was fans to the shit we had cause
Ain't a man that can tell me different
When shut 'em down just got you open
And KRS just made us listen
We had it made and paid in full now we the bullshit renditions
Of Rick the Rulers in dresses
Hip Hop hooray with these fishes
Just in the jewelers and dressers
Misused the message to get it
This shit was schooling or repping
Now it's forget it or dead it
When this new shit's like a fool with a weapon
Letting loose at his wedding
With kinetic proof in his love so now
How this love gonna get him
His pathetic excuse for a prophetic just to profess his concessions
She blessed my life with her strife
Without your honorable mention
How long can man dance on her flesh til his god reserructs it?
It's like

[Hook]
This craft saved my life and my soul
So many times that i've known
There wasn't any sign of light in this hole
For every rhyme that'd take flight from my soul just know
That there's at least 5 spitting behind it sitting from the writers of old

Man this craft saved my life and my soul
So many times that i've known
There wasn't any sign of light in this hole
For every rhyme that'd take flight in my soul just know
That there's at least 5 spitting behind it sitting from the writers of old(Verse 1)
Yo, shit ain't like it used to be, Not since puberty
Who knew our paths would happen to cross so what you do to me
But now I love you with every bit of my heart
How I used to get you wet when I hit it too hard
I can taste you on my lips, I even love your aroma
Please stay close to me, we'll float into a coma
I love your red hair, I'm just dead air without you
Showed me the light with slight pools hype around you
You used to love crushed ice cold down your back
I'd try to swallow you whole, you rolled down the sack
But now it's empty, you and I'm whipped, I'm lonely
A love letter to you, but yes I hope the phone rings

2x
Every penny I made I always brought straight to you
My thoughts never strayed, I stopped shaving it's proof

(Verse 2)
If I can't have you girl consider this the suicide note
I miss your mind games ever since you and I broke
At time you made it hard to breath hard to see the end
Please one more chance I'll never let you slip through my hands again
I always showed your seeds love
You were never charmed
How's it better this way, with an empty set of arms?
I know we said we had to let the air clear a few days
I thought I knew life, well then along you came
But now it's too late
You were always more than just a friend to me
You've occupied everything in my short term memory
Sure there's other fish in the sea
You snagged the line
Corny but cold in this empty sack of mine

2x
My friends ain't seen you, said I should let it be
But yo girl you'll probably be the death of me

You're my source of inspiration, did I pass my limit?
We used to light an incense, we'd snap in the kitchen
Following our instincts with whipped cream in the dark
The chemistry between us when shit seems to get hard
We used to cut class to chill, we'd get alone I'd choke
Spittin' shit I wrote for you, not just blowin' smoke
No other will effect me in the same place that you touched
Sometimes I wish my friends would've never introduced us
You give me goosebumbs, but the truth is I love it
Sometimes too much to take, we used to do it in public
On the train in front of other people she never seemed to care
Where we was going cause sweet love was in the airBut brothers would it kill us to change?
And chain 'em up in prison when it filled 'em with hate, cause ain't a difference
It's pound for pound the literal weight
Stay down for now
It's crowns are minutes away
And hey, to each his image, with satan lickin his fangs
But sang bandstand freedom in it's business of slaves
Who paid Jay-Z and Mantan to give it away?
Shit'll take some new brand pants to get us to stay
Make haste
To the pinnacle, infinite, made of mineral clay
Today we're diamond, nickled, crippled out of critical rate
A little wisdom with some rhythm to pray
A place within em, livin grace as original as the middle of gray
His cynic cake and Antoinette with a tyrannical taste
Faith abandoned
How we wise if even famine obeys?
Now we're swimming with the salmon to calamity's lake
With granite feet, shaped from vanity and grammy speech "thanks"
The late great planet E
The hand of greed squeezed, fannin these flames
Nine to five will be the ant theme, but man, it'd be great
Time's a lie, Yah's alive, why's it man that we praise?
Anchor hands and canvas feet
Like, damn if we say
Standing deep beneath the, deep between the span of these banks
It might take a Barbie chant to get the answer dj'ed

But man it might change us to stay
Straight line 'em up and shoot 'em when they cued 'em for fame
It's the same unnamed shooters, through the hoop with the flames
Saying truth is the rain, remain luminous and true to this or lose it in vain
Computer Judas rather view it through the tube in his brain
Supersized, eyes swollen open, two to a cage
Mother funded dungeons, running on punishment budgets
Someone's up to something
Govern it, two to a plane for fame, sing it again, a cell
Scream it, a gain, a name
Losin it paid us well
Keep it the same and bang
Claimin the realest real
To reel in your favorite slave
Peeling the seal revealed for real
His name remains the purest
See the trees for the forest
Born to be the force of meteors or screamin it towards us
They'd sort us off in sections
There deception ignores us
To sort us to the new world
Or new world orders
For motherfuckers that would maim us to prey
Aim and pay 'em off as senators
The predators bait
Fate inevites the snake
Like, whatevers your flav
Pay the rent for your president
We're peasants or slaves
Which is better?
Richest debtors get a whip whipped instead of a say
Let it fix itself, while dangling from venomous fangs
Your name is sediment
The bestest threats to get you to break
To make the exodus from genocide
The letters we paint

But brothers would it kill us to change from vain
Jiggy, diddy, viddy what you give me to up jump the boogie
But man it might change us to stay the same shitty
Gritty, cities hittin kiddies with fronts, stunts, and hoodies
Sissies with a name and claim to fame
Woody looking goody, it's all boogie to beat beat beat
With deceit seat seeded and conceit's teeth gleamin
The truth gets diluted to me me meI once was asked how to make liberty's idol last for centuries
I know, shape her out of pennies, paint her green with envy
She'll be standin with her back turned, burnin, smirkin towards her enemies
She better be hollow from head to toe with horns beamin out respectively
Just ask pretty penny about her copper torch, shorts, and bad data
Must've made her mad, well, the way she turned her back away to fuck her neighbor
Green with envy, seen the ending with her forced force torch a saber
Ashamed of sister liberty, gimmicky sourced, and faith flavored
Both whores and finicky sports to play the game
Left sores and razor pissins, different day, the same invader
Drift away
It's the way to ensure the surest source for paper
Ya'll can either respect her cheddarish scepter or be a slave to
Ya'll get me, God bless these snakes, bally fakes, and alley-gators
Walter Raleighed hate, coca-cola bottle flavored mothers and brothers without a say to
Or way to make the rent, pavement played and spent hence, cavemen make the sense
And fences for cash prayers
And past tense saviors
The same bitch'll make you fly two planes just to awake ya
Dresses like a million bucks in cash favors
Makes me wanna Ralph Nader, ask Wheezy, Alpha Beta
It's fast feces and mass sedaters, evil masked to master bait us into class rags
And mass graves through crack crusaders
Snakes with smart chips that wanna vaccinate us
Make us fat and racists, mad and rapists, glad it breaks us
So she cages us like larouche in the bottom of her blackest basement
Makes us fags for fads to keep us in our padded places
Hacks a cackled crash and asked us where our scattered faith went
Trash in her left hand, rats in her right
Laughin how the rats altogether rappin, masses jaded

Stacked like a brick shit house, the louse that hates
On the shortest route to doubt for clout on an out and out to bait you
Shapes youth and euthanates truth do for take two
Soon as Pfizer breaks through she swoops her prey, elusive ain't who
Just do it, flew into two traders, it's today's news
Right behind her back, gravity's angel, with a great view
See she's a true novice, (novus), ordo seclurum
See a skewed vote is just more dough to secure em
To a view broken and short rope to lure them
To a lewd token choking fool, blue for no insurance, boat cruise ignore the current
Divorce court adjourned with Gomorrah burnin
Squirmin like a whore in church, service to her person, worship through her purse width
Perfume fumes and vermin, loop de loop nooses drew in cursive
But why's she cursin
Starts with lie (li) ends in birdie (berty) fly, a little worm told me it's perverted
Give me your huddled masses backs so we can crack with burden
I once was asked how to make liberty's idol stand for eons
She'd brandish a torch with no light on some stolen land she peed on
At the base it'd be a rat race poem for her to rest her feet on
The whole world stirred green with envy like that sheet she dons
I once was asked how to make liberty's idol last for centuries
I know, shape her out of pennies, paint her green with envy
She'll be standing with her back turned, burning, smirkin towards her enemies
She'd better be hollow from head to toe, with horns beamin out respectively[Verse 1]
The space it takes to time travel ain't worth the effort
Mic saddle mastadons to find Babylon the network
As clear as it seems hi-fi makes it perfect
This pyramid scheme with the eye at the vertex
Serpents smell with your tongues and wait for blackouts
Yo, for sure sex sells check wealth at the crack house
Appachis don't stop, but the candle burns
At both ends while most men just channel surf
It's gonna take more then folded hands to part the skies
So lets drown from the ground up
Imperfection starts with I
Am god and god's not hard rock or worthy slaves
Surfer make the paper sleep late, pray for early graves
I hope we catch ebola, just what man deserves
Built god with satellites, but couldn't handle earth
It'll flood 'till the blood spills, but you still wouldn't believe it
No control, alt, delete it
I'm on my way to be it
The time it takes to space travel ain't worth the distance
If I could reach the remote from here then I convert the mission
Worse then vision splitting headaches
What man's set on looking?
These books are too heavy, plus the antenna's crooked
The batteries are drained, I think I'll wait it out
But way the pounds of apathy, I think I hate this couch
We can slouch into a fetus, all we need is television
With long spoons to feed us sex and exorcism
Internet access to find our souls
E-mail me dogs, cynical smiles and barcodes
Homes are only shelters, only shelves of a man
Remote is where the heart is, the heart is gettin' bent
Yo, we can start right now, here in Chi-town
I'll die if you have to, you know I'm down
With an automatic bag of chips, the honeybun's out
What channels the revolution on? the motherfucking couch

[Verse 2]
Cameras for the crips, like gifts for the thieves
When he's only fifteen and got a tip from his seeds
So whats kid gonna read, when clips is magazines?
When god drowns we;re surrounded by fags and fiends
Rapping teen actors on the magic screen
Lies for halftime, why's he laughin' at me?
Let the smoke flow out through his platic speech
Patching dream jobs for slaves, saving half the fee
Hack the feet off, at the khaki cuff
Need batteries for windows, cause reality sucks
Half to give up something right?
The library's sold, meet us on the ones and twos in binary code
Hypnotize my mind, is it time to explode?
Is my spine a remote, or am I in control?
As I portray this wisdom image actor see
But why's this plastic thing, pointed back at me
Pointed back at me (pointed back at me)[Intro]
Don't be you
Don't do what you do
But what you say

[Verse 1]
Man I seen this sleek graff piece of Japanese baby shadows
Blasted black back against the foundation of half cracked knees
How could the artist catch the perfect and exact beauty of the little faces
From 10,000 stacked feet, cynical laugh
Musta had mad reach, flash freeze frame, made efforts
Remembered to paint the faded jump rope froze in half leap
Man’s canvas masterpiece, banana ants and apathy
Hands danced to slash thick apple on this last patch of green
Fat squeeze the master painter heard the ground cry out black streaks
Deep ash piles of salmon pink and sweet corn yellow
Rusty red dragon stabbed across my sky so subtle
Greasy cobalt streaks from black squares, puddles of pear bubbles
Puncture holes double as burgundy moons over dim plum meadows
Mint stamped oasis and gray aphids of charcoal statistics
Scraping scarlet across mustard crust, maroon and hunter critics
Purple mistress circles of tin spin under burnt umber crimson
Instances of living under vivid lemon wings with quick orange flickers
Flash! Ripped the canvas in his mouth in his coarse grin full of slivers
To join the outer phoenix with the inner, seen it
Initialed with white warm splinters, scenic

[Verse 2]
He sang so carpenter
How you paint ivory fences with red hands and hammers
The left stumbles like the right dances, his full ring of keys answers
Be hardest tinkling C, sharpest stinging B. Carpal tunnel visions
Listen with heart and soul, then soul can pump beat literally
Heart can spot mind, mind can rock earth
The stuck prey alarms the spider in her dark cave soft purr
The faucets spring a leak on spoon and greasy saucer ring
The father sings this autumn breeze
Strangle this queen that knows the thoughts he thinks
Constant pacing back and forth crawling this long hall of keys
His song is out of reach now, down-stretched palms to maul the beast
He calls his sleep out, twisting sheets, spotted monstrous mistress
Starving queen darling clouded dream catcher chattering snarling teeth
Right back at him, call it holy matrimony. Fire ax in sharp C
Laughing foaming at the soul swollen charred reach
Arms locked arched back, scarred deep
Rippling water, tapping feet on beat, rhythm dwindling softer sleep

[Outro]
Be you
Do what you do
Always
Here come the locusts
Here comes the locustWhen times get rough, you're my diamond in the now
Lining in the clouds
Smiling with a child
Cry to get it out
The why to stick it out
Through stress in silent sittin bouts
For being patient with this weak man
While his mind is flippin out
Just a million miles between us, venus
Yah made your eyes emblazoned sapphires for me
Like ain't a half a smile between us
The way your cheeks spring up
Sweet tongue
Hung behind meek doves
Thinking thirst through this drought aloud
The singing clouds I speak of
The mother to your mother
To my sons
Your love is thunder
Sung from Heaven
You're my sun and water, daughter of redemption
Mentioned always in my silence
My asylum in your iris
Every shade of silk I dream in
Deep secret streams that I confide in
Spring breeze greet the green leaves
United with this dry wind
Like diving into violets, gliding free, no one's an island
She's a diamond tree
Pearl limbs like nag champa
Purr grin like myrrh samba
I thank Yah with words
But burn when they're not enough
It's the psalm I'd spit to Christ twice, wife
Your tears are ice swans
My gift to life, light like
Your embrace, the grace of white fawns
Arriving dawn that I've awaited life-long, when she yawns
Right palm and arm, the softest song sung
To the farthest heights and nights when he's gone
Nothing to offer thee right, like my life in this song
A flight to leave, no night of sleep, it seems to frightfully wrong
It feels like life's a drink of soul
To hold my wife in these arms
To seek the greatest heights to seat you
And decipher these psalms

Just a million miles to dream of
Your kiss is Indian summer swings and sweet plum
To see you sleep like Spanish moss
And hear you breath sun
Dare to compare you to the clear blue and the deeps I speak from
Like kingdom come, prepared for two in moments, life, the roses she hung
Light forms through ballerina fingers
Man, she sings when it's funny
Strummed like honey harp strings
To the heartbeat of the breeze and just loves me
Fit puzzle piece
Your cheeks are peach trees in Eden sleep in sweet shade
To make the seven seas between us shrink in a blink
Where we can dream of the day
Sea sprayed, Sonoma sunrise eyes, and tiger lily lips
Witness the Tigris spilling over and over, pupil solar eclipse
Big sky iris
Divided by the cutest nose in existence
Violet misted horizons and mystic islands in the distance
Just to sit in silence
With water rippled fingertips to violin
How this mile ain't an inch to climb
Smiling your winter pines
Pygmalion hips and thighs, and a mind I'd die to hide in
Flip script to it's just a twisted trip we're sittin side by side in
Treasure of Poseidon, who can find the finest incense
Kiss the edge of prism light
Like misses life
Thistle less inset
Crimson grinning rose
Timeless, chiseled in stone
Throne silken linen
Just a million instances from home
