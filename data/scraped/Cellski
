[ Mr. Cee ]
Well, here's a little dose
From the half of the group you like the most
Straight from the Frisco City, West Coast
With somethin up my sleeve
It's just my pep talk about these niggas who be trippin
About these niggas who be trippin about these niggas, oh my God, they done failed
Each one of them's some victims with some jaws that got swelled
With a hard blow from the steel-toed boots
Cause mama always said, "Boy, put them feet to use"
And don't get mad cause we won't flip-flop
Cause RBL's just like a truck with no brakes, punk, it don't stop
Like Tony the Tiger you know our shit is like great
Cause we ain't comin corny like some of you Frosted Flakes

[ Black C ]
So meenie-meenie-meenie-moe
Should a nigga pick a ho?
I think I squat to the house for the gat, I bring us back some indo
Pretend tho, if you wanna, I think I'm gonna
Step to the back and bust a cap
And watch yo 'real-ass' niggas scat
See, it be on on my block
We poppin a cop with a Glock
Even them young niggas givin shots
We gives a fuck about a copper, gettin our propers
By burnin cops like ???? chopper
So ah - you can smoke an ounce to this (biatch)
While my niggas on the run smoke a stog and all bounce to this

[ Hook ]
We go front, back, side to side
"While you muthafuckas bounce to this" (Snoop Doggy Doggy)

[ Black C ]
So knick-knack-patty-wack, give a bitch a crack sack
And a fat smack with the muthafuckin nut sack
And bust back in a battle
I'm like a rattle snake, I don't fake
Bust one cap out the eight in my gun
Run, you get stunned, I'm shootin for fun
I'm like a warrant havin niggas on the run
It's the B-l-a to the c to the k
A nigga from that there city by the Bay
A nigga who gets his mug on and mack on, but anyway
On any day we can get em up or shoot em up
Havin that ass bounce three times while my nigga's schoolin ya

[ Mr. Cee ]
It's like 3 and to the 2 and 2 and to the 1 with a bang
It was 'a lesson to be learned,' but that's a known thang
But niggas still ain't learned they lesson
So we continue to make hits while you suckers keep guessin
Our style, our muthafuckin flavor
But don't you even trip if you can't cater
To the needs of party people, makin em movin, gettin em groovin
But 2 niggas in Frisco hats and Nike shoes can
And no one told me but I know I'm goin major
Cause all these punk hoes that's for callin on my pager
But I just sit back and chop my beats like a ounce
And make yo trunk like a trampoline and watch my song bounce

[ Hook ]

[ Cellski ]
Yeah, it's '94 and I'm back on the spot
7-deuce class 455 block
Straight mashin down the 'dolph windows up, full of contact
Me and my niggas just got through burnin a twamp sack
I'm rollin around high as fuck gurpin off some right
I hit the liquor store to get a 40 of St. Ides
Forty ounces, I bounce back to the 'dolph
Hella took already and a nigga fit to be mo' off
I hit a cut and parked in some shade
Seen my nigga Baldhead walkin down the street, he said, "I got a fade"
He jumped in with fo' sacks of indo
He twisted up the dank as I hit the 4-0
He said, "Let's ride and get up out the View
Because in the View really ain't nothin to do"
Off to the O, see some hoes before we hit the freeway
5 deep in a 5 Ac, see where we stay
I said, "Baby, I'm from the Lunatic village
In Frisco where the gold thangs keep spinnin"
You got niggas from Fillmore and Hunters Point
Who quick to smoke that ass just like a joint
But niggas ain't set-trippin, just keep on dippin
Stand away from player-haters who save bitches
Cause niggas where I come from don't save hoes
If you ain't givin no ass up, well, bounce yo ass on
Biatch

Yadadamean and thats it(chorus)
It's your life, don't be stupid though (4x)
Cuz when you waste it

(Black C)
Livin that young life
Where nothin nice runnin from the vice
Think twice you lose your life gamblin with the dice
Cuz it ain't nothin but a ninety thing baby
And all the hoes in the Point drive me crazy
Can't fade me
If they had a ten-foot pole
I stroll down the block givin props
To my niggas on the spot
It won't stop and it won't quit
Cuz the hoes can't fuck with our shit I switch
Up on that ass, fast
If she try to fade a young nigga she'll get mashed, bitch
It's just a juice thang, mothafuckin deuce thang
Kill that game, but still a nigga maintain
My business, my mission I'm lynchin
Any mothafucka catch another one of my loved ones slippin
I smell jealousy up in the Point
But I laugh at the niggas as I blaze up a chronic joint
Cuz I don't trip off them bitch-made niggas
Or them gold-diggers, cuz they don't know my niggas known killers
But I guess that's a victim tryin to earn a stripe
And got caught up in that mothafuckin way of life

Chorus

(Mr. Cee)
Livin my life man, must be the fuckin shit
Cuz nowdays niggas actin like a fuckin trip
And punk hoes try to get you lynched by your dick
But all you impetrators gonna need a Medic quick
Saying this or saying that
You might as well be a masseuse cuz ya always talking shit behind my
Back
Spreadin rumors like tumors
And crossin off my face on my poster in your girl's room
And um, I never asked to be the man
But the way these niggas be playa-hatin make it seem like I really can
But I don't have to play a role or perp to kick it
Just to get a piece of ass or a free meal ticket
Now I got a tape and these bustas wanna hate me
Just because they girl caught the base and wanna date me
But back in the days it was always about my nigga
And now you see a brotha comin up then you say his head is bigger
But I'm still the same-old same-old
The only thing changed was my Levi's to Girbaud
Damn, it just ain't right
But that's just the shit I have to go through cuz I claim I'm livin
The life

ChorusVerse 1:
We rollin' five cars deep, all logo thangs:
A Cutty, a Caddy, two OJ's and a drop Mustang
My nigga's fucked in the Cutty gettin' donuts, fishtail
And smokin' up the block and "Two hun'ed block" is what he yellin'
Hyped as fuck, gone of the Hen and dank
Bitches all over the place, jockin' niggas off gold Daytons
6-7 lock is what I'm rollin' when it's sunny
Fo' figured, five block to keep my shit runnin'
Gold thangs, spin in pearl pains, shinin'
And everywhere I go, niggas ask if they can buy in
Bitches jock everywhere I go
That's why I roll solo at the sideshows
Creepin', peepin' out these hoes
Cuz the first one to look is the first to get chose
So come take a ride and let me show you how it's done
Up in the state of Cali-funk-ia
Nigga

(chorus x2)
Roll, roll, roll yo' voges up and down the street
All the niggas drop the tops and hit the spot, if you're ridin' on gold
D's

Verse 2:
Sippin' on some hindu, blowin' on some indo
Brang paint, tick tock to the Regal to the rallies, all addicted
Chrome
Strike a well, my crews is saying, you ain't ne'er be mine
Hungarian P.R., now I'ma let me throw back windows back and a bangin'
Job
It's funk in the town of the fog
Too many deaths, ain't nobody down for the squad
Rollin' plushed out exact like your Cadillac
Soldier Seargent in a car wit gat on my lap
All day. Escapin' tracks from Vice
Can't wait till it get dark, might hit the club tonight
You know them sound recycled clubs
Where there to the bunch a big be life hype, who to da bunch a Glocks
And then a bunch of unknown damn buds
Niggas poppin' the trunk for the funk
Benzes, Beamers, Lexus', Caddy paint wit drops what's out, pushin' a
Bump
Y'knaw't's how we do it in the town and I was cold
And now to the Bay, nigga go roll yo vogues

(chorus x2)

Verse 3:
Nut'n nice, it's like life, I'm livin' off in my buildin's
Slangin' that 'caine, get regular cash back, a nigga's spillin'
Ready and willin' for some freaks to leap off in these streets
So I can yap on high cap, in a nina millimeter
Then fall down, these niggas is walkin' around with one of these ammos
Under they belts
More niggas I'm killin' than killed, then I be up on tilt
Right to my belly, rush is so striggity-straight as cops
And me and my ridah potnas, back to the Bay, got caps at you intrudas
Mug, that's when I'm slug-killed, still makin' these drug deals
Wit a 9-double 8, tryin' I'll think it him and dark kill
It was a thrill, comin' up in these projects
All the set arsenal with them took years to duck this
Stuck to the set, you rarely see me off the turf
A young nigga that's showin' off, ready steady pushin' that work
Pushin' a Caddy on Originals and Voges
Stack wit my lap strap, with my mack Mud'fuck's

(chorus till fade)[Verse 1:]
I’m from d bay, process of elimination
Where they won’t hesitate, to put down d demonstration
Consequences an repercussions, they bussin
Put da bitch ass nigga in half like a english muffin
They gone on the brown and will do u some harm
Snortin heroin in the powder form
No respect for a cop in the uniform
Chemical babies, dropped on his head when he was born
Nigga crazy
Out here in d Ye
No recess cause dem boys don’t play
Betta get up out da way
If you calm down tryna see another day
Persuade a bitch to play which way
Give up her punani berry, I’m actin in full effect now she callin me dada
Not a sandwhich but I used to be a poboy yow
Holes in ma socks, just stains ya know

[Chorus:]
Both ways don’t cross that bridge
Cause every city in the bay wit this shit
Yea we wit this shit
Yea we wit this shit
Every city in the bay wit this shit[x2]

[Verse 2:]
Ma game infested, from d soil
Up in Houston sippin on oil
Up in KC fuckin wit d royals
Up in d kitchen waitin for d water to boil
You know a nigga still move yirl
An all ya’ll knocked your game from Earl
I’m a fresco nigga like Boobie an JB
Dem 80’s ladies is what made me mainly
I used to sit on d blocks sellin rocks to AT
Dis for d most Sony, Dell an HP
Dem lakeview niggas yea we still crazy
Be-tray hear the veegies an alimany
A legend like the Giants an 9ers
Tryna get dat bitch to sell her vagina
All I know is countin stacks
All I know is blowin racks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I got money in ma duffel, money in ma sock
Keep d 50’s in d honies an d rest for the back
Ma lil niggas love it when I take em to da spot
When they see dem handhelds and bold out shots
Rule number 1, neva be d aggressor
Cause any little weez can bring d Glock off d dresser
Some get knocked off d block or way lesser
Leave d whole family, cryin, stressin
Funk in d summatime, funk in d winter
Where killers be invite, invitin you to dinner
Duct tape, tea parties an notes for da ransom
Duggin ain’t pretty but da payoff is handsome
Find me in da projects, sippin on coolaid
Twistin up afgan keepin d crew paid
Bounty on yo head then we come fo’ d payoff
Then fuck you like Bernie, in d Chevy we made off

Brang paint, tick tock to the Regal to the rallies, all addicted
Chrome
Strike a well, my crews is saying, you ain't ne'er be mine
Hungarian P.R., now I'ma let me throw back windows back and a bangin'
Job
It's funk in the town of the fog
Too many deaths, ain't nobody down for the squad
Rollin' plushed out exact like your Cadillac
Soldier Seargent in a car wit gat on my lap
All day. Escapin' tracks from Vice
Can't wait till it get dark, might hit the club tonight
You know them sound recycled clubs
Where there to the bunch a big be life hype, who to da bunch a Glocks
And then a bunch of unknown damn buds
Niggas poppin' the trunk for the funk
Benzes, Beamers, Lexus', Caddy paint wit drops what's out, pushin' a
Bump
Y'knaw't's how we do it in the town and I was cold
And now to the Bay, nigga go roll yo vogues

(chorus x2)

Verse 3:
Nut'n nice, it's like life, I'm livin' off in my buildin's
Slangin' that 'caine, get regular cash back, a nigga's spillin'
Ready and willin' for some freaks to leap off in these streets
So I can yap on high cap, in a nina millimeter
Then fall down, these niggas is walkin' around with one of these ammos
Under they belts
More niggas I'm killin' than killed, then I be up on tilt
Right to my belly, rush is so striggity-straight as cops
And me and my ridah potnas, back to the Bay, got caps at you intrudas
Mug, that's when I'm slug-killed, still makin' these drug deals
Wit a 9-double 8, tryin' I'll think it him and dark kill
It was a thrill, comin' up in these projects
All the set arsenal with them took years to duck this
Stuck to the set, you rarely see me off the turf
A young nigga that's showin' off, ready steady pushin' that work
Pushin' a Caddy on Originals and Voges
Stack wit my lap strap, with my mack Mud'fuck's

(chorus till fade)[Verse 1:]
I’m from d bay, process of elimination
Where they won’t hesitate, to put down d demonstration
Consequences an repercussions, they bussin
Put da bitch ass nigga in half like a english muffin
They gone on the brown and will do u some harm
Snortin heroin in the powder form
No respect for a cop in the uniform
Chemical babies, dropped on his head when he was born
Nigga crazy
Out here in d Ye
No recess cause dem boys don’t play
Betta get up out da way
If you calm down tryna see another day
Persuade a bitch to play which way
Give up her punani berry, I’m actin in full effect now she callin me dada
Not a sandwhich but I used to be a poboy yow
Holes in ma socks, just stains ya know

[Chorus:]
Both ways don’t cross that bridge
Cause every city in the bay wit this shit
Yea we wit this shit
Yea we wit this shit
Every city in the bay wit this shit[x2]

[Verse 2:]
Ma game infested, from d soil
Up in Houston sippin on oil
Up in KC fuckin wit d royals
Up in d kitchen waitin for d water to boil
You know a nigga still move yirl
An all ya’ll knocked your game from Earl
I’m a fresco nigga like Boobie an JB
Dem 80’s ladies is what made me mainly
I used to sit on d blocks sellin rocks to AT
Dis for d most Sony, Dell an HP
Dem lakeview niggas yea we still crazy
Be-tray hear the veegies an alimany
A legend like the Giants an 9ers
Tryna get dat bitch to sell her vagina
All I know is countin stacks
All I know is blowin racks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I got money in ma duffel, money in ma sock
Keep d 50’s in d honies an d rest for the back
Ma lil niggas love it when I take em to da spot
When they see dem handhelds and bold out shots
Rule number 1, neva be d aggressor
Cause any little weez can bring d Glock off d dresser
Some get knocked off d block or way lesser
Leave d whole family, cryin, stressin
Funk in d summatime, funk in d winter
Where killers be invite, invitin you to dinner
Duct tape, tea parties an notes for da ransom
Duggin ain’t pretty but da payoff is handsome
Find me in da projects, sippin on coolaid
Twistin up afgan keepin d crew paid
Bounty on yo head then we come fo’ d payoff
Then fuck you like Bernie, in d Chevy we made off

[Chorus]
