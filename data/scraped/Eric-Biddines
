[Hook]
I got to feel the sunshine
I got to feel the thoughts of your mind on mine
Then I’ll never die
Beneath the darkened sky

[Verse 1: Eric Biddines]
Excuse my babble, I talk until I got lengthy
Certain topics get the best of my interest don't mean I'm friendly
Running like a leaky faucet
See we toss it to the side throw it in the closet
Very rare for me to lose my cool
We in a school full of stools
Sitting at a table dissecting these facts like they ain't true
Who told you you can get away with telling these lies?
Before you swallow oxygen look me in the eyes
Reflection in the mirror we don't recognize it
Paint a canvas in my image
Put a frame around it
Don't even hang it cause I'm looking like
This supposed to be me?
Analyzing every logistic how can I fix it?
Changing everything but what I need help with
See now I'm trippin’
Now I'm fishing for a crack in the ceiling so I can ditch it
Rules golden like the mouth that I speak with to bite the tension
Count on me to let you down cause that's realistic. Rules

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yasiin Bey]
They say the chief of the tribe took a handsome bribe
Now his face is everywhere but he's hard to find
Super prime, on the grind, in the modern times
Gains from the game in exchange for a sober mind
And young’un you can hug the block, but it won't hug back
Until it do, and it squeeze and your spine go snap
Like feet chasing paper then his lungs just collapse
Ain't no freedom at the trap, it’s as simple as that
Pay a hater no mind, because that don't matter
Why whip slaves when you can just kill master?
Slaves getting brave to guard masters’ interests
They too shall feel it once we snap the clip in
So no threats only oaths, get well or catch hell
Shop open get dosed, medina hours baby, we never close
And how ever the banks go this balance don't broke
Salaam folks

[Hook][Verse 1]
Working the fields the whole yard
Out in the sun it's so hot
Singing a tune to move on
Dat’s how it is, it is lord

Everybody wanna be buddy from the hood with a Chevrolet grill
But nobody wanna do thangs dude did just to get where he is
Raised on a old dirt road front yard with railroad tracks
Snotty nose kid, booger nose drinking outta water hose like that

[Hook]
Sho’nuff, oh why?
There's a lotta wrong things in my life
Turn up turn down
Yesterday is yesterday and no doubt
Hey hey hey...


[Verse 2]
Only had one TV bunk bed with a broke box spring
Shared a bathroom, toilet tissue got wet let it dry on the sink
Bought a loaf bread, mildew on the end we ain't even much complain
Got a couple pots on the living room floor momma said it might rain
You ain't think it no joke
Collard green, stems split peas for the pork
Soaking in the kitchen on the table with the wood cutting board
Playing Al Green from the radio
Daddy had dreams but he never did know
How to provide for a whole household
2 or 3 dogs and cat and small junk yard, fed them for he even fed his own

[Repeat Hook]

Working the fields the whole yard
Out in the sun it's so hot
Singing a tune to move on
Dat’s how it is it is lord[Verse 1]

Back in this bitch like I missed the whole winter and showed up to late
Chip on my shoulder like somebody forgot to fix me a plate
Story unfold history shows that all can't be great
But the way that my bank account set up. My phone and my internet my not get paid
Money on hold
All of my profit ain't came. Feel like it's taking too long and I'm spending mo money then I ever made
I still feel on the real here we don't live still
I done told y'all all about change we can make bills
Wore the same shirt for the 10th time reminisced I
Not a thing hurt cuz without shit you don't  miss out
Seen a whole lot saw a man shot women pimped out
From a swap shop to a outlet to the hood spot
Taken all names. Further I go with this rappin the closer I get to the top of the ranks. Never no acting bumpy like acne drumming and droppin the bass
Who is it askin probably fascinating they all wanna hate. I'm kicking the doors off

[Hook]
I'm kicking the doors off  (x2)
I'm bringing my folks in I'm, im kicking the doors off. (Repeat twice)

[Verse 2]
I'm kicking the door off. I'm bringing my folks in. We knocking the bolts off. We coming from both ends
We don't  have shit we on got shit, want everything. Stomach on E. Pocket got lint. And my gas tank. Need a hundo, got a bill due and the rent late. Momma feet hurt, cuzzin Torri wanna shirt made
I still feel on the real here we don't live still
I done told y'all all about change we can make bills
This my real name Eric B- I. Double D I n-E-S yes from the first day I be dat guy
People don't that know that we come from the bottom were money don't ever come visit. And  the size of your wallet no bigger you got it for fashion you pinching 4 pennies
You look at me strange. I walk on this concrete Wit the mind frame of a giant untamed. No shackles or chains
Juggernaut running threw walls coming down quicker than Niagrah falls. .Leaving whatever may stop us from reaching  the level to conquer it all

[Hook][Verse 1]
Walk around my way. You would see no weight
I done been there seen things felt like coulda got way more say
If a moonlight dim in the dark blue sky would a folk have faith?
If a man stand still right against his will did he fail to make?
Many times had the opportunity we be the first one wondering
For the path I made had a shorter glance I gotta real life thang for the older stance
Fear war like a soldier dance in the field bullet fly low key to prance
Over ceilings rooftops a cars
Flow trapped  I'm between the bars
You the one your the gleaming stars
Said we when I meant to feel
Felt fake when I said the real
Got Lost looking back at years
Years never went by safe
Purple goldfish in the back of my mind
Head straight for the lake

[Chorus]
Have you heard about the water
Has anybody ever seen it
I be waiting till the moon come
Purple Goldfish Dreaming
I be ready for war
Purple Gold Fishes
I be ready for war
Purple gold

[Verse 2]
See, what a mother fucker failed to realize that, I done been across that lake
A nigga told me that the purple gold fish didn't exist and that it was fake
Now for the sake of me not just saying some shit, I hope y'all understand my take
Oh you believe cause that what is not in front of your view or vision
Can't be real because you seen everything huh? Trippin
The purple gold fish poses the power and is only given to who that ingulf the essence of fight
The battle within self against others
The alternative gesture to strike
But you too afraid to think I'm right

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Purple gold fish little fishy swim free
Rise above lake so the power I see
Moonshine mill in the woods hid deep
Fighting for the right found war in me
I'm looking for the purple gold fishes
I'm looking for the purple gold fishes I

[Chorus][Chorus]
Tell you all about my day
And how I missed you in every way
And throw my keys on the counter, grab a couple towels, get up out the shower, then I...
Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours
Lay in you for hours girl

[Verse 1]
Just got off work I'm feeling tired put in overtime
My lil momma just want me back In time for dinner time
She send me texts threw the day to speed the clock
Got me looking at my phone more often then my new watch
I can't be late no more this week
Im in the studio a lot I'm busy forget to have Sex and eat
Don't wanna seem like this music and work it come before her
But she know a n*gga trying to build a ark kinda like Noah
To get my partners out the hood and feed the fam
I know she appreciate me out here being who I am
I could be home invading, or distributing grams
But I can't be with her if I'm behind a cell
Pull in the driveway she peaking threw the blinds
The light in the bathroom she turned it on that's a sign
She getting ready for Eric to come inside and I'm ready for whatever know she made me a surprise

[Chorus]
Tell you all about my day
And how I missed you in every way
And throw my keys on the counter, grab a couple towels
Get up out the shower, then I...
Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours
Lay in you for hours girl

[Verse 2]
She cook me breakfast in the night like its morning
I ate it all up even though I'm not that hungry
She made me coffee how I like don't want the strong blend
15 sugars 4 creamers know it's on when
She bring that song out, if this world was mine, by Luther Vandross played it about a hundred times
That music on to make babies when ovulation taken place inside a lady, don't hurt to be educated so
We in a place that only me and her can go
Eric Biddines got the map to wrap ourself around the globe
She don't want me gone but eventually I got to peel
Got some fans although she number  1 I have to go appeal
And leave you alone, I know you held it down
Laid in you for hours and hours I'm talkin owe!
My legs cramping up, where you put that towel
Lay it on this puddle I don't wanna sleep in ours

[Chorus]
Tell you all about my day
And how I missed you in every way
And throw my keys on the counter, grab a couple towels
Get up out the shower, then I...
Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours
Lay in you for hours girl

[Bridge]
I wanna lay, I wanna lay in you. I wanna lay in you. (2x)

[Chorus]
Tell you all about my day
And how I missed you in every way
And throw my keys on the counter, grab a couple towels
Get up out the shower, then I...
Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours
Lay in you for hours girl[Hook]
Coffee in my cup, I hope you understand
It's more like therapy, whenever in my hand
It gets no better than this cup I have of coffee
It gets no better than this cup I have of coffee

[Verse 1]
If I don't wake up in the morning to coffee
I must not have waken up at all, I'm dead in a coffin
Or probably somewhere lost in, trapped in what you call a
Place that every coffee drinker hate to be we all a
Victim of being guilty to being addicted
It's the aroma we long for, provided we lifted
I love the feeling like the moon above the beach
The smell of wet rain on the afternoon concrete
Early dew on freshly cut grass
Drink it slow I take my first sip of the brew like it's my last
Coffee so good you have to look back at the cup
Reminds me why I love this feeling right here so much
You lolly gagging when you lucky to be living
People stressing everyday, lost family that's no longer with 'em
I talk about this coffee but it's way more deeper
It's an expression that we digging for relax a bit
Get up and pour some

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
You could be riding on the bus or subway
With you iPod in your ear lobes, that coffee you might take
Driving to your job and  hope your boss took a vacation
Waiting for you train to come, rely on public transportation
Just seen a text sent from your ex that you was missing
Checking on you like you got over the arguments and tension
Some times you really want to be alone
Gone  come a moment in your life you're looking for this song
Saying that Eric was striking a chord inside my soul
Ain't even know that it existed must be something that he know
Well I don't know everything, but I know life
Is random, and making sure that you stir your coffee right
I'm gifted in a sense to know that happiness is gold
Everybody is unique, we was made a custom mould
I believe in good karma
Locate the place that ease your mind and block the stressfulness with armor

[Hook] (x2)

[Break]
You don't even know what's on my mind
But you don't need a watch to know it's time
I'm tryna fast forward or press rewind
The present is a gift, I realized
So I'm
Drinking (x7)
And I'm
Drinking (x7)
And I'm
Drinking (x7)
My coffee

[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1]
When sun down follow the drinking gourd
Let the moonlight take you away
The riverside said'll take you north
Pack no bags you on need no weight
Said the masters on my sole
The shackles on my feet
The blood still in my clothes
But all I see is free
Don't lie me die for no reason
Don't let them take me away
I prey to lord Jesus
I'm bout to loose my faith
That's why the shackles on my feet
And the blood still in my clothes
But all I see is free
Hope the hound dog ain't that close
Try to make it to freedom
I know we will one day
Don't make me out a believer
I'm bout loose my faith

[Hook x2]
I said the rail roads down
It's under

[Verse 2]
I live on the field with the porch the tree with the branches that come with a that rope
My daddy was brought on a boat. Said a nigger had sold em to keep him afloat
Ain't know bout the title of slaves. Born into what we know now as thought
Mommy said one of these days our luck will run up and these shackles be broke
Uncle said must not be no god. If it was this won't happen
Toby said keepin all faith hard but we gotta keep at it
Prayed and we prayed and we pay hard. Til the moment it happen
One of these days we gone come far
I just know with a passion

(Independence Day)

[Intro]
Finally free x 4
Made  a way x4
Finally free

If you asked me where I'd be today I would prolly say Ida never made it out

Possibility went away never came not a thing till the day I

[Verse 1]

Started doing left the doubt in me I had evaporated just like fluid
Said if change was posed to come like early Morning with the rooster on the get up y'all forgive me I was stupid
Ain't know that loosing was loosing your hope and faith. You only die if you give up the day before they make your grave
Too many ppl depending my lead of way, the load you carry when you barely show weakness in others face
You shoulda been there when my life was on the fence, never went to jail but still I always stayed stayed in the pen
Writing history on compositions. This developed from a camera im living inside the prints
Came from a Long dirt roads the crop of farm with no agriculture barely can grow us a stock of corn
Shoulder looking over every lil vulture the term born
What you think I'm posed to Barry my ppl without no funeral
I told my daddy I'm double if it was two of you
I seen London I'm booking a flight to Liverpool
You Caint stay local forever. You need a team but as a individual you gotta never say never
Almost cried the first time I wore genuine leather
It was Cold but see me the type to Preciate weather
Just saying you coulda been somebody ain't wake up. Happiness is free but material sh it'll break us[Verse 1]

Back in this bitch like I missed the whole winter and showed up to late
Chip on my shoulder like somebody forgot to fix me a plate
Story unfold history shows that all can't be great
But the way that my bank account set up. My phone and my internet my not get paid

Not a thing hurt cuz without shit you don't  miss out
Seen a whole lot saw a man shot women pimped out
From a swap shop to a outlet to the hood spot
Taken all names. Further I go with this rappin the closer I get to the top of the ranks. Never no acting bumpy like acne drumming and droppin the bass
Who is it askin probably fascinating they all wanna hate. I'm kicking the doors off

[Verse 1]
I hope one day that I can touch the sun
And even though that might not be as fun
A simple melody to move the waves
If a seashell wash a shore then that's the day

[Chorus]
I've been searching high and low, and high and low I search
And everywhere I go
Can't seem to leave the hurt
There's a message in the boat
In a bottle waiting to, ship out to sea

[Verse 2]
The bottle that I sent may not return
But that's okay because I feel like I earned
(Like I earned a prize indeed)
Treat myself before anyone could read
Just to let go was enough and all I need

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tug boat paddling against the current
A couple footprints in the sand thinking dernit
Was I left her at a critical moment
At a time I thought I needed more than one could of wanted
Listen to your heart and you don't gotta ask why
Looking through a window like I got a glass eye
From the moment you doubted when everybody who hated
Begin to figure that you never understood why
People sell their dreams and leave docks
Got time to need a third watch
What's a goal he said without a chain
He was thinking of jewelry and me change
Follow what you desire to maintain
Wen the water hit the fire to light up the whole day
Pull the lever to alarm the ship in the third bay
Same ocean that the Santa Maria had sailed away

[Chorus][Verse 1]
Walk around my way. You would see no weight
I done been there seen things felt like coulda got way more say
If a moonlight dim in the dark blue sky would a folk have faith?
If a man stand still right against his will did he fail to make?
Many times had the opportunity we be the first one wondering
For the path I made had a shorter glance I gotta real life thang for the older stance
Fear war like a soldier dance in the field bullet fly low key to prance
Over ceilings rooftops a cars
Flow trapped  I'm between the bars
You the one your the gleaming stars
Said we when I meant to feel
Felt fake when I said the real
Got Lost looking back at years
Years never went by safe
Purple goldfish in the back of my mind
Head straight for the lake

[Chorus]
Have you heard about the water

The purple gold fish poses the power and is only given to who that ingulf the essence of fight
The battle within self against others
The alternative gesture to strike
But you too afraid to think I'm right

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Purple gold fish little fishy swim free

Shared a bathroom, toilet tissue got wet let it dry on the sink
Bought a loaf bread, mildew on the end we ain't even much complain
Got a couple pots on the living room floor momma said it might rain
You ain't think it no joke
Collard green, stems split peas for the pork
Soaking in the kitchen on the table with the wood cutting board
Playing Al Green from the radio
Daddy had dreams but he never did know
How to provide for a whole household
2 or 3 dogs and cat and small junk yard, fed them for he even fed his own

Excuse my babble, I talk until I got lengthy
Certain topics get the best of my interest don't mean I'm friendly
Running like a leaky faucet
See we toss it to the side throw it in the closet
Very rare for me to lose my cool
We in a school full of stools
Sitting at a table dissecting these facts like they ain't true
Who told you you can get away with telling these lies?
Before you swallow oxygen look me in the eyes
Reflection in the mirror we don't recognize it
Paint a canvas in my image
Put a frame around it
Don't even hang it cause I'm looking like
This supposed to be me?
Analyzing every logistic how can I fix it?
Changing everything but what I need help with
See now I'm trippin’
Now I'm fishing for a crack in the ceiling so I can ditch it
Rules golden like the mouth that I speak with to bite the tension
Count on me to let you down cause that's realistic. Rules

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yasiin Bey]
They say the chief of the tribe took a handsome bribe
Now his face is everywhere but he's hard to find
Super prime, on the grind, in the modern times
Gains from the game in exchange for a sober mind
And young’un you can hug the block, but it won't hug back
Until it do, and it squeeze and your spine go snap
Like feet chasing paper then his lungs just collapse
Ain't no freedom at the trap, it’s as simple as that
Pay a hater no mind, because that don't matter
Why whip slaves when you can just kill master?
Slaves getting brave to guard masters’ interests
They too shall feel it once we snap the clip in
So no threats only oaths, get well or catch hell
Shop open get dosed, medina hours baby, we never close
And how ever the banks go this balance don't broke
Salaam folks

[Hook][Verse 1 – Eric Biddines]
Yesterday was a moment that came soon
I expect to be a blessing, what other way should I prove
That we don’t need a picture, develop the focused minds
When [?] envision spitting like man that’s a cool design
Smoking on stone, barefooted, no food
[?] clean water flowing for drinking, [?] think of shoes
Was you dreaming its on, you know what song
When you’re shot you came home, and the [?] alone
Got a call from a place that you can’t reach with a phone
This summation’s for the people in the form of a song
Strong bones built walls like a concrete tower
Rained ponytails, fell from the clouds like showers
Broken soul, need a healing, when you’re hoping for change
I just notice if you’re thinking that’s a moment of power
This an elevator, step into the proper direction
I’m the perfect [?] who listen, I’m projecting perception

[Hook – Eric Biddines & Amber Monique][x2]
Y’all don’t know that I don’t want no problems
Trying to provide me a role model
I done turned a penny to a whole dollar
Mission [?] hoping I’m on full throttle

[Verse 2 – Bun B]
Waking up in the cold world with no heat
BSB, bop it up and down your street
The world we live in is crooked and corrupt
So we got to let the next generation know what’s up
We got to give em the game they need to survive
Make sure they don’t just exist, but that they thrive
Staying alive, know on days it ain’t a given
Got to be aware of the surroundings that you live in
It don’t matter who you are or what you’re repping
There’s some booby traps laid so watch where you’re stepping
See they don’t really want us to win, well they really didn’t even want to let us in
But keep on striving and keep on hoping
Won’t be long before the doors is opened
You can break out of the crazy hood that you left it
Wise words from the OG and EFN, baby

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 3 – Jarren Benton]
Tryna be a role model, so many issues, I down the whole bottle
Used to feel inadequate, fuck it, didn’t want to see tomorrow
Niggas put too much hope in the rock
Kids grow up fatherless, their mama smoking on rocks
Where the role models when we out strolling these blocks
Ain’t no rocket scientists, no lawyers or docs
Crackheads, dope boys, single mothers, and cops
They fear for their life, can’t cherish any moment they got
That’s the mind of a young soldier in these lost communities
His 13th eulogy, where is the opportunities?
Ain’t no young dreamers, the reality’s a nightmare
We bitch over policies, kids deserve the right care
Fuck the crooked office of politicians and [?]
Waiting on some leader to reach us, nigga please
Seen some dark clouds, the sky forever blue
Dream big young kings, the role model is you

[Verse 1]
Being pigeon held
Back against the wall, claustrophobic, damn it's hot as Hell
Sweatin' like a slave in a field full of cotton
At the drive thru Taco Bell
From where I'm sittin', you can view the world
You get fucked or you can fuck a girl
You can choose to be a leader or a follower
Respect to all the fathers cause to me it's more than diamond pearls
I mean no judgin', I'm just talkin' from a place of honest
See I'ma star but I'm no different from that fallin' comet
I write these bars hope the universe will listen
See I had to swallow pride even if it made a nigga vomit
Appear to me you want somebody that'll lie to you
But not somebody that'll die for you
Appear to me you want somebody that'll lie to you
But not somebody that'll die for you
Same dude from out the south of Florida
Same street you bought a cigaret that cost a quarter
Haitian lady gave me a couple bag of chips I got a soda
It was free my hunger showed over thirst of water
In desperate times you gone have to decide
To kill yourself so you can make a livin'
If I'm inspired ain't no power alive
To stop my vision, that's just my opinion
And you can quote me you can bring up bout my past
Yu gone notice that I'm well driven
Check my record I got pictures of my shoes I was poor forever
Never ever begged not for nan penny
Momma said it was important that we ate at school
We got off the bus at home it may not be no food
Our refrigerator had more space then our living room
I thought that all kids ain't have a daddy I assumed
Cornered in, fighting suffocation
Sick of being sick and tired I ain't even patient
Racing elevate my stride gotta learn to pace it
And do it all just to dream I can add bacon

[Hook] x2
I'm looking out The Window (I'm looking out the window)
I'm looking out the Window
Ain't no place that you can go so you sitting there at home

[Verse 2]
Sleep on the same flow you spit on
People hate you ain't put them on
Got it twisted thought somebody owed me something like being good was enough
And they was posed to play demo
Looked out the window
If I could blow like cartridges a Nintendo
Would you let me be your hero?
I promise always do it for the fans never for advance
They was nappin so I woke em off they pillow
I never fear no
And I never took a night off
And I still got yo shout out. Some a wright off
Don't extend your hand to all folks
Take your kindness and they will bite yo shit right off

[Hook] x2
