[Intro]
Don’t ever let somebody tell you, you can’t do something
Not even me, alright? (alright)
You got a dream, you gotta protect it
People can't do something themselves
They wanna tell you that you can’t do it
You want something, go get it. Period

[Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
Yeah, West Coast
I remember when nobody believed in me
But now, I’m bout to prove them wrong
September first 88’. The first day of my fate
To be the greatest so I say this to myself, “I can’t wait”
I gotta put in work so I can get this money stacking
I gotta put in work so I can get the crowd reacting
You ain’t gonna be the best
I confess if you gonna be resting and don’t care
Still got a ways to go but my goal is to finish that lesson life ain’t fair
We are all just human in this life that’s for the proving
So many out there choosing to stay losing never moving
What you know about that life? So I can be living it right
Central pay in the summertime global express, private flights
Studios all night ain’t coming outside til the outcome right
Or out come the light, well my future bright
Hustle hard because you only get one life

[Hook: Chanel West Coast]
I’m on an elevator to my penthouse
Two fingers for the haters tell them “peace out”
I’m living major, now living my dreams out
Ain’t no contesting that all of your life’s just a lesson
I said nothing is going to stop me, nothing is going to stop me
I said nothing is going to stop me
Im gonna be whatever I want to be because nothing is going to stop me

[Verse 2: Chanel West Coast]
Gonna be the cream of the crop, piling cream on top
With a mean drop top, my team don’t stop Man I sieze the top
When my album drop gonna seize the spot Like I just been shot
Go hard like rock, [???]
My time, tick tock, my whips ain’t stock
And I won’t stop til I get my props
I do it for myself, do it for my crew
We do it like stealth because you never see my crew
All eyez on me, that’s my favorite record
West coast I be, rapping Audrey Hepburn
I’m in my lane and I’m not ever pulling over
I like green and I’m not ever going sober
Know my name and the feel me just like a groper
On my campaign, household name like Oprah

[Hook: Chanel West Coast]

[Bridge: Chanel West Coast]
Haters want to hate us cause’ they can’t be us
We living for the moment, hold our hands way up
Nothing Is going to stop me, nothing is going to stop me
I said nothing is going to stop, nothing is going to stop
Whatever I want to be cause’ nothing is going to stop me

[Hook: Chanel West Coast] (x2)[Intro]
Drop an old school beat!

On fire like I'm camping
Breakfast in my mansion

I don't care if you understand the meaning but i won't stop pilling till cash hit the ceiling
Oh no no, you'll never get this moment

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh i had to take off ...?

Tell me your name, so I can forget it
I'm in the fast lane
And you at the exit

Blow past you bitches
While you blow for riches
I ball hard like bitches
You holding on like stitches
I'm taking off, no glitches
You behind me like hitches
Stay grinding like bitches
In the eye lens like snitches

Cocaine white

Let the streets have me

Step up, I got a down bitch Ima call her

Bitches it's a wrap, that's a beat all over
You dead wrong if you sober
Ho stay back, show grace like Topher
So tonight we gon' get a case of ace of spades
Spray lames in the fucking face
And tonight we might catch a case
Get laced like we just won the fucking race
So if you ride like we ride and tonight be the night
Got you going in heaven (heaven)
Grab a dime or a nine, have the time of your life
Lids flowing, no livin' (livn')

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My attitude is fuck it, motherfuckers gon' love it

My fans know the words, while yours be humming
My man buy me loubs, why yours be bumming?
Got twice as many pairs as you, I'm doubling
Get twice as many stares like Gazelle make you run it
I'm gonna twerk, I'm getting it
I'm gonna work, stay getting it
You a jerk, get your own licks
You a lurk, check your own pics
Ain't got a care in the world
Middle finger up, skater girl
Sipping liquor up, faded girl
Hitting better Bud, later girl

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Liquor, liquor, liquor, liquor
Pour it in my cup, hold it up, way up
Liquor, liquor, liquor, liquor

Liquor, liquor, liquor, liquor
Some wanna fight, I just wanna get right

[Hook][Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
If you drunk and acting foolish
Then this be the music that shit to make you lose it
Get thrown out like you stupid
Maybe bands will make her do it
Lands in France will make me move it
In that trance from my movement
Getting love like Jen Hewitt
Living life to the fullest like jack nick and freeman in that movie
Catch me out living in Miami Willie beaming with the Louis
In my queen of some land still drifting by my jewelry
Ain’t no other team we live the dream that’s just the way we do it B

[Hook: Chanel West Coast]
I’m about what’s happening, stay all up on my fashion
These drinks yeah we be smashing, getting money that’s my passion
Loaded like im blasting, you can’t get it why you asking?
Got Fendi in my mansion flashing lights, Kardashian
Looking so fly I’m tied with the sky
Looking looking so fly I’m tied with the sky
Looking so fly I’m tied with the sky

Peel out in my new Benz, on my way to one though
Got some old and new friends, roll up cause we gon' smoke

[Pre-Hook - Chanel West Coast]

Get thrown out like you stupid
Maybe bands will make her do it
Lands in France will make me move it
In that trance from my movement
Getting love like Jen Hewitt
Living life to the fullest like jack nick and freeman in that movie
Catch me out living in Miami Willie beaming with the Louis
In my queen of some land still drifting by my jewelry
Ain’t no other team we live the dream that’s just the way we do it B

[Hook: Chanel West Coast]
I’m about what’s happening, stay all up on my fashion

Now I’m on the red carpet in red bottoms that’s what they said
I’m living the dream, make my own bread
Dressed to kill leaving them dead

[Hook: Chanel West Coast][Verse 1]
People walking like they
Think they important I'm not
Supporting they showing they
True colors when they talking I'm aborting
It's exhausting that I'm caught in the moment
When rappers flowin
Like other rappers in every song sound the fucking same
People think they know me
From shows on they TV
My flows they don't, believe me
Some hoes they want to be me
Some hoes they tryin to see me push buttons like it was serious
Stop fronting I'm bout my
Keeweed the screens for all your lanes
Caught up in a jungle
The world, the way we struggle
The world, the way we juggle
Sometimes we need to huddle
Sometimes we need to cuddle
My rhymes that be my hustle
Bout brands like I was rustle
The start of my campaign

[Hook]
This world keep on spinnin
This world keep on spinnin
This world keep on spinnin
Round and round we go (x2)

[Verse 2]
Shoot me for the stars like
A fucking paparazzi can't wait to learn
Lennon's for the local vavazachi
Driving fancy cars they still see me
At the swap meet pullin up wit jaws
With that sticky icky bomb weat
(bomb weat)
And I gotta do what I gotta
Gamble on myself navada
Stappin for the wealth I wanna
I'm moving so stale poronna
I got all these dudes double taking
Like a two for one in the cali sun they baking
All these fucking rules I'm a load the guns they breaking
I'll never lose and I'll never lose I'm waiting

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some people wanna talk about ya
Some people wanna try and doubt
Ya I got myself here with out ya

Chips all in and I'm cashin' out
Whips on gleam cuz I'm showin' out
I'm sinnin' and winnin' at the same time
Make a livin', I'm finnin' to get mine
You timid, stay hidden on the sidelines
I'm chillin', keep hittin', it's game time
I'm that bitch you mad at
Cuz I'm good and you bad at it
Mad cuz you home and you want my spot
Hatin' on me from your fucking laptop
Waitin' on me trying to see what I got
No deba-ting, give it all that I got

Party all night, up, up all day, day, day
More 24's than Kiefer play, play, play

The world's step ahead and I'm not fully prepared
I place any bet, I take any dare
Cause nothin' in this world can make me scared
I felt so much hurt, it's time to dedicate
I knew it was worth,it's time to climb stairs
Still here climbin' in my way to the top
Everyday climbing, never gonna stop
Focus on a dream that should've come true
Nobody can defeat me, I'm speaking the truth
Nobody completes me, all I need is [?]

I woke up today, I was so much fresh
It's gonna be okay
I'm heading to success
Through so much pain, blood and sweat
Seems like yesterday I lost my best friends
It was also suddenly, never had a warning
Path made of mud but I'm still your warning
Haters have to be here in my ride to the top and for no apparent reason they were brutally shocked
After bleed to death
I am on the sidewalk
It takes it all my breath
Even around the clock
But time can't stop
They can't beat him
You can only move if I stay to sing
And your heart have all
Everyday keep breath
Even if you let go
Your memories keep insane
Keep a minutes in your place
And nobody can take it
No matter what you say
They know that you made it

[Hook]

I'm on a mission now
Nothin' can hold me back
Through all the ups and downs
I'm on the right track
I'm focus on my dreams
No matter what I go through
I will complete my mission
Cause I know I'm supposed to
I got ambition in me
It's time for me to use it
I know I got the talent
It's time for me to prove it
So I'mma speed my mind
With the wrong or the right
Cause music is my mission
This mission is my life (life, life, life)
Cause music is my mission, this mission is my life
(this mission is my life, this mission is my life, this mission is my life)
Cause music is my mission, this mission is my life
(this mission is my life, this mission is my life)

[Hook][Verse 1]
Me I'm moving now
Chasing my dreams
To be moving out
Ain't what it seems

Do I need a crown?
Do my own thing

Summer is the truth, so
Let you know when I get there
I don't know whether how the cold is better
I just know never is the same as forever
I live to be better
Stay the course like leather
I'm lost whatever
And I'mma boss whenever
Take a steam when I want to
Take your hand when I need to
Spend a grand just to see you
Love is grand when you see through
Roam the land like a breeze do
It came in like a least true(?)
That's the can, and it can do
One reason that I be true

[Hook][Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
Where all my bitches?

Homies got to go if they faking
Go harder than a porn star

People can't do something themselves
They wanna tell you that you can’t do it
You want something, go get it. Period

[Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
Yeah, West Coast
I remember when nobody believed in me
But now, I’m bout to prove them wrong
September first 88’. The first day of my fate
To be the greatest so I say this to myself, “I can’t wait”
I gotta put in work so I can get this money stacking
I gotta put in work so I can get the crowd reacting
You ain’t gonna be the best
I confess if you gonna be resting and don’t care
Still got a ways to go but my goal is to finish that lesson life ain’t fair
We are all just human in this life that’s for the proving
So many out there choosing to stay losing never moving
What you know about that life? So I can be living it right
Central pay in the summertime global express, private flights
Studios all night ain’t coming outside til the outcome right
Or out come the light, well my future bright
Hustle hard because you only get one life

[Hook: Chanel West Coast]
I’m on an elevator to my penthouse
Two fingers for the haters tell them “peace out”
I’m living major, now living my dreams out
Ain’t no contesting that all of your life’s just a lesson
I said nothing is going to stop me, nothing is going to stop me
I said nothing is going to stop me
Im gonna be whatever I want to be because nothing is going to stop me

[Verse 2: Chanel West Coast]
Gonna be the cream of the crop, piling cream on top

And I won’t stop til I get my props
I do it for myself, do it for my crew
We do it like stealth because you never see my crew
All eyez on me, that’s my favorite record

Know my name and the feel me just like a groper
On my campaign, household name like Oprah

[Hook: Chanel West Coast]

[Bridge: Chanel West Coast]
Haters want to hate us cause’ they can’t be us
We living for the moment, hold our hands way up
Nothing Is going to stop me, nothing is going to stop me
I said nothing is going to stop, nothing is going to stop
Whatever I want to be cause’ nothing is going to stop me

[Hook: Chanel West Coast] (x2)[Verse 1 - Chanel West Coast]
Like bath salts, going crazy shut it down in this 'B'
Like last call, never catch me bounce on them
Like basketball, do what I wanna, smoke hella marijuana
It ain't my fault, stay showing off, if you got it then flaunt it
Just let them know, moving to the music, go hard just lose it
With no remorse, I'ma keep cruising like time in a movie
Just stunting off, hate it or they love it, always cold at the summit
Got a hermit scarf, they so sick, it is what it is just call it off

[Hook - Chanel West Coast]
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they put me on
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they put me on
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they put me on

Pushin’ pushin’ pushin’, keep it pushin’ (x4)

[Verse 2 - Ty Dolla $ign]
Dirty girl you getting money, then you’re bout your dollar signs

Tint on her window, getting ratchet in the truck
Everything we rough is on designer

Put my middle finger up, tell them we never gave a fuck about no hater

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chanel West Coast]

You just met me no you can't get the digits
So keep it stepping move with the quickness
I don't care you a balla got me all wrist freeze
So dope trying to holla baby boy on me

You can spend your whole money trying trying to get me
Trying to get me trying trying to get me
I don't gaurentee that your leaving with me
I'm a tease boy so take it easy boy
I'm a tease I'm a tease and this is your warning [x2]
