Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it
Turn it, leave it, stop, format it

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
See, now you know who the God be
Back runnin' the city and you know who the squad be
Flipmode, bitch, look see ain't nothin' changed
Now I'm back with the remix with the Queens of the game (TURN IT UP!!)
When you see me in the spot, you niggas better respect it
Y'all already know where I rep, ain't no reason to check it
And I know that you ain't fuckin' with me, just for the record
So instead, I'mma let Mary J. Blige come and set it

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Maybe you can guess who it is (Uh huh)
Mary J. Blige, I'm 'bout to handle my biz (Uh huh)
I'm on my grown woman, still I rep for the kids
In every hood, and all my peoples doin' a bid (TURN IT UP!!)
Now you know who's really the queen, deliver the mail
Seven hundred thirty thousand, first week of my sales
The haters plot and they watch, lookin' all pale
While I'm on a yacht, overseas, doin' my nails

[Verse 3: Rah Digga]
Now he sittin' there lookin' stuck
He thinkin' cause he spent a little dough I'm 'gon fuck
If money ain't a thing, I'm sayin' let a bitch know
Type to empty an account, how far you willin' to go (TURN IT UP!!)
Now he hopin' on the jet, he ain't wastin' no time
Told me all expense paid anyplace I could find
Hit the islands in the winter, trickin' all on his dime
Ain't a shorty in the world pussy better than mine, they wanna

[Hook]
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it
Turn it, leave it, stop, format it

[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]
I'm jinglin' baby, go 'head mami
Don't I look charmin', put your lips up on me
Kiss it, touch it, good, yes I wish you would (TURN IT UP!!)
You like to see me when I dip, baby, dip
Don't it look like I got Beyonce's hips
Lookin' like I could be like Nia Long
Boy, you smokin' that Cheech and Chong

[Verse 5: Lloyd Banks]
I know it feels like I been gone for a minute
But I'm back, chinchilla ice on with a fitted
Everybody talk money, everybody gonna run
With that bowl of bread smaller than the arm of a midget (TURN IT UP!!)
And you know I'm doin' my thing, it's blue in the ring
If you had it like this, you probably do it the same
But you won't, cause you broke, all you do is complain
After the club, I'mma put a few in the range and let 'em

[Hook]
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it
Turn it, leave it, stop, format it

[Verse 6: Papoose]
Five boroughs of death, you don't understand
I got New York City in the palm of my hand
Now I could make a tight fist and let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world with a New York Nemesis (TURN IT UP!!)
I got Staten Island on my pinky, Queens on my thumb, dude
The Bronx on my middle finger screamin' fuck you
Rock ice in Manhattan so there's the ring finger
You know I had to keep Brooklyn on the trigger finger

[Verse 7: DMX]
Swizz is the monster, X is the beast
Fuckin' with Bus, everyday is a feast
Stay off the streets, I'm tired of talkin to y'all niggas
I'm a stick a fork in y'all niggas (TURN IT UP!!)
When I hit 'em man, that truck come get 'em man
Fucked up how I did 'em man
Ain't no remorse for the corpse, truth is
Can't I.D. the body, nigga toothless

[Hook]
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it
Turn it, leave it, stop, format it

[Verse 8: Busta Rhymes]
You see me, you love me, the streets declare me God of the hood
You niggas is watchin' and wishin' you could
Be claimin' the throne the way I got it, lock it mu'fuckers
What's good, you tryin' to stop it, I'm wishin' you would (TURN IT UP!!)
Cause then I'm glad to hit you with the fact that the God is immortal as spit
The way I be doin' historical shit
In case you and your niggas act like you ain't know when I'm informin' your click
I take your bitch while I'm performin' my shit

[Hook]
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it
Turn it, leave it, stop, format itThis is the Fugees, Outsidaz up in here:

[Hook: Wyclef]
Everyone wants to be a cowboy
Grab your guns boy
.45 by my side, do he live?
No, the nigga die!

[Pacewon]
Zen, zen zen zen zen zen zen
You shot your bullet, but the bullet went ****
"Desperado", new word for "rudeboy"
I pull out my gun and plug two like Trugoy

[Verse 1: Wyclef & Pacewon]
Wyclef
Pacewon
Yo this was how the West was won
(Our motto, a true Desperado)
Rappers want to be actors
So they play the Jesse James Character
(And get they bones fractured)
You ain't got no guns, you off to the precinct
Inside tuff guys are feminine like Sheena Easton
Woman cry, woman cry, Son still dies
Thrown off the building like The Fall Guy
Caved in the grave cause you didn't know how to behave
Playin' cowboy now you sleep with the slaves
Who's the desperado, sellin' bottles in the alley
On some villain shit, wearin' a mask like Jim Carrey
With his gat cocked, stinkin' up the crack spot
Pacewon dies with both eyes on the jackpot
The town that I'm from beggars eat cat chowder
Sundance Kid is the everyday purse snatcher
If you see him coming, you better start running
Like a terrorist I guarantee you he'll be humming
(Dynamite, dynamite, Clef I got the cash)
Yo let's skip town like Harlem nights

[Verse 2: Rah Digga & Lauryn Hill]
We make moves in stage coaches
Rah Digga likes the roaches
If anyone approaches
We be like noches, buenos
And I compose a poem for the many gun-slingers
R&B singers, perpetrating guns with two fingers
My style is perhaps one of the foulest
I inhale large clouds of smoke through my chalice
(Buckin' at stars) and write rhymes for hours
The ghetto missy, drinkin' whiskey sours
Bust this scenario, can't no other niggers in the barrio
From North to Ontario, bust us when we in stereo
Cause me and Rashida rock the battles
It's apparent, your no talent, cause your blazin' in your saddle
Watch these rap bitches get all up in your pockets
Then bounce with accountants that give me good stock tips
Cause props is up, Digga's through the roof
Burnin' niggers like I'm 90 proof
And for all you head beaters
The lead eaters, the cheaters soon to be retreaters
While mamacitas carry real heaters
I rock the Dooby and L rocks the Nubian twists 9-6
Motherfuckers gettin' dissed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Zee & Praz]
Yeah, when the OUT's hooked up with the Refugees
It be more niggas than the NAACP
Comin' up on weed of all type
Smokin' home-grown out tobacco pipes
(You've got to know when to hold them
Know when to fold them)
I can take the sunshine, piss in your wine
Steal your concubine, walk away with your goldmine
(So ooh aaah achiga, Mamase Mamasa Mamakusa)
Fuck the sheriff, I shot John Wayne
Push him off the runaway train in the movie Shane
Yeah me and that kid, um "What's his name?"
That would be me, Young Zee from No Brain
Smokin' pure from the health fodd store
While my whore slaps cops like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Fuck with OUT's it's like those Islam brothers
We march through your hood with a million muthafuckas
So let's get high off the Fu-Gee-La
When the east is in the house, like I'm Blahzay-blah

[Verse 4: Forté]
When pandemonium strikes, at midnight
Full moon splits soft niggas in a lunatic
On some absurd shit
You talk back, hustlin' crack don't make you bigger
Niggas who take your measurements quick, don't make it quicker
Stick and slide with vigor
City streets hot like liquor
21 gun salutin', shootin' niggas from the roof and
Got nerve to mouth about it and the weight you claim you movin'
Your whole style is loose and we gon' sew it like it's cotton
You fail to recognize that everybody could get gotten
The bounty on your head, says your dead by manana
Pop babies whisperin' that there's a body dropped, behind the lot
Police blew up the spot and locked the whole block
Medina is the east side of town lounge never till we yawnin'
Gun players regular front page is the bonus
Life will keep existing while I'm shitin' on opponents
Life will keep existing while I'm shitin' on opponents

Type to empty an account
How far you willin' to go?
(TURN IT UP!)
Now he hoppin' on the jet

Yeah, State vs. Kirk Jones, Judge Battle now residing
Got a case of armed robbery that ended up in violence
Maximum sentence, life in jail's what you're facin
Prosecution set it with your opening statement

[Canibus]
Your honor, before we get started
I'd like to give my condolences to the family of the dearly departed
Tyrone survived by his mother Barbara
His two year old daughter T'wanna
And the baby's mamma Sandra
(He's a murderer! That animal killed my baby's father!)
[Rah Digga]
Order in the court!
[Canibus]
I'm sorry for the outburst your honor
I have an original copy of the police report
January the 4th the day that Kirk Jones got caught
The forensic report states there was a gun in the car
And gunpowder residue on Mr. Jones' right arm
Baliff, could you please pass this report to Judge Battle
Mr. Fitzpatrick there's a few questions I'd like to ask you
You said you was outside the store in Manhattan
So could you please tell this court what you saw happened

[Superb]
Yeah he killed Tyrone
I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything
The worst shit I saw in my life
I wanna testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie

[Canibus]
Did you see that man in court today?
Do you think that you could point him out?
[Superb]
Yes that's him right there
[Canibus]
Are you sure?
[Superb]
Yeah without a doubt
Same nigga that took my Pumas but I ain't hold no grudge
Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood
[Canibus]
You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before
In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?
[Redman]
Your honor, objection!
His opinion should be stricken from the record!
[Rah Digga]
Objection sustained, prosecution next question

[Canibus]
I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour
Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?

[Scarred 4 Life]
Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class
Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass
And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass
He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask
I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor
Yo I swore I was a goner for sure
He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet
It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it
[Canibus]
Is that the moment when he shot him?
[Scarred 4 Life]
Yeah man that's when he popped him
I was so scared I laid there, played possum
He started to blast this way, til the gat was empty
He took the gun handle and broke the glass display
He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store
And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor
I can't remember no more, that's all that I saw...

[Canibus]
Okay, okay calm down
I have no further questions your honor

[Rah Digga]
Court is now in session, now gettin back to business
Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness

[Redman]
Yeah aight your honor, I call up Henry Lace
He's the witness that I'm cross examinin for the case

[Guess Who]
Yeah I testify your honor, it was death by dishonor
It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it
It happened so fast, I didn't see alot of it
But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus

[Redman]
Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous
There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages
Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath (yeah I know)
You lyin in the stand to get him fryin in the pan
Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone (I was right there)
You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home
Was you mad because he came home bangin your chick (what you talkin 'bout?)
Got your boys out the hood now they slangin and shit
I know you mad that's why you in court, turnin on him
Kirk cold blooded killer wit no burner on him
Come on you don't believe he murdered Tyrone
I believe you wasn't there you just heard it by phone

[Guess Who]
Man you crazy man I was right there... Redman- Yeah right... I read your rapsheet...
Calm down, calm down, chill, chill, Kirk, Kirk...

Respecting the Code of Honor staying together

Rattle and knock all of your troops who goin to get this cheddar

Show em mysteriously watch how they vanish
See when we finish just analyze all the damage
No matter who you are, we accept any and EVERY challenge (yeah)

I hope you know that this is really not a game
The way I put it down you will remember the name
The way we change it up shit is never the same
And when I'm finished I promise I'll have you niggas feel ashamed
For giving the people shit they ain't really loving
It's funny to me but y'all niggas be buggin'
But it's aight because I will continue flooding the streets
With heat for the ladies and niggas who be thugging
And if you want it then bring shit wit open arms (spread love baby)
While I continuously give you niggas bombs
Asalam will make 'em will lake 'em so long
I'm in the abscence of confusion holding the world in my palms
I'm tired of telling you there ain't nothing greater
Swinging the torch and repping for Violator
So tell the DJ to go and turn up the fader
Putting it down for the streets regardless what you saying playa!

Is the reason I got the band back together, bitch
Yeah, it's me and [???], and his [???]
North side, bomb squad, Eric Vietnam
If you don't see it like I see it then you see it wrong
We October 3rd niggas like me and Kwe'
Life got me in a state on the interstate
And all I'm thinking bout is what's up on my dinner plate
Meanwhile I make your girls hyperventilate
Prolly cause I live the kind of life art imitate

[Hook: Al Be Back]
That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands
We living next door to the Aquilius again
Pardon me fam
But I'mma show you how it is
I'mma show you how we get in

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Rocking the Guy Fawkes mask like Anonymous
Passport pimping like I'm going outta town to flip
The ass for a symbol with the cops hopping out of whips
Bath salt niggas with the zombies apocalypse
I'm blessed cause my afterlife is the studio
This rappers life is gangster's paradise like I'm Coolio
That's what a few believe like a doobie roll
We off of that Patrón, we sipping the Don Julio
You talking shit? we don't need the chatter
Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth
That's when I'm letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out
Better let it off cause you set it off
The music that's creating a movement like it's December 4th
Threw away the dark meat but they ate the white
Animated like it's kind of darklit it's my wicked life
It imitate my life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rah Digga]
Yeah, y'all keeping it 3hunnid, we keeping it 360
Coming full circle echelon don emcees with me
Tired of saying I'm the best, I won't waste another breath
Heard lyrics coming back, I say it never left
Y'all just catching up, so slow to come around
Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down
Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it, and set the precedence
And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff
Nice being self employed, ain't gotta kiss ass
I ain't gotta slim fast, smack a ho with a love handle
Dare you to say you ain't a fan boo, roll a bamboo
Life imitating art imitating life, show you how the fam do

[Hook]Peace to the ancestors
Yes
Peace to Dr. Cornel West
Yes
Peace to The Movement
Yes

We came from the bottom
Ever since they got us
We've been going through these problems
400 years behind and there's no promise
That we could ever actually be equal, to be honest
It's messed up how they put us in chains
Kidnapped our language and changed our names
But when we speak ebonics then they call it a shame
They leave us with a couple options:
Rob us, slang
Now we locked up again
How much can our skin take
We went from slaves to inmates
Carrying the weight of the 50 states
Working your farms
Black nannies carrying white babies in their arms
Black men sacrificed their lives in your wars
But you don't ever show appreciation here at home
You treat us so damn wrong
You act like you hate my race
The police, they just beat in the streets, like a 808 base
America, when will you defend my case?
You never will 'cuz your freedom is fake
I'm only living here 'cuz I wanna get paid
Enough to round up all my family and shake

Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up

They done torn...

(incomplete, I'm having trouble with the transcription)[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Let's toast to paid mortgages, lasting marriages
Tina Farris's pay King to Paris
Living long, making my kids heirs and heiresses
The family crest, the legacy, the heritage
I'm out of Philly where the ecstasy and syrup is
And we don't need Theraflu, we need therapists
Them never-ending pursuit of them dead presidents

Mediocre rappers gettin all this play
While the underground rappers stay around the way
Even up and coming heads gettin lead astray
But us female rappers gon' be OK
(repeat 2X)

[Bahamadia]
Yo, this is the orifice to mythical mindstate
I'm pure as opposed to the fakes y'all makin legends of
It's ridiculous, showin wack niggas and chickens love
Cause they playin in rotation and constantly gets buzz
But it's aight though, majority rule for this hype so
I play the background until it's my turn to blow
Never jeal', record it like I see it cause my vision swirl
Minus the weave and nails you gettin rawness from Illadelph

[Rah Digga]
Uhh, I bounce the Reebok's, and smoke Hawaiian cheebas
With the ese's, with Pepe's, and the mida's, with Fila's
And come back to lay the vocals
Milky like Total, tighter than Krunch's
I showstop they homegrown like contraceptive sponges
With cutthroat raps, plus I'm fuckin with the SP-1200's
And 950's, when C-Low's fuckin with me
Loop kick snare link it up with the semi
I set warfare like when the doctor yell "Clear!"
Hits below the belt but no bitin on the ear
I'm worser than a Colt boy with punchlines trife
Battle 40 MC's and make em take they own life
Now what's this talk about a marketing scheme?
Nigga please, I crush all MC's ?sardi deez?
Dead or as they take em, you faker than Muslims eatin bacon
Or growin' some dreads, now you Jamaican (bwoy)

[Bahamadia]
My thoughts lose you, in the logic that they glue to
Diverse channels they move through when I will spit influential
Workin on your mental sort of like sermons at holy temples
Neotepic and nimble when deeper than baby dimples
Style the vulture, I laced it so you could observe closely
These opuses unfolding insuring the heads quote me
Off the top of written each time I finesse it I be shittin skill
Infinite, bask in the eloquence internet
You know the repoitoire, ghetto platinum rap star
Sixteen bars of inspiration from Allah rightfully God
And these Goddess poetics, reflectin off geocentric
720 essence promoted to Earth lesson
I shine like flourescent whenever I'm blessin it
Fuckin with these independents now and lovin it

[Rah Digga]
Yeah, cataclysmic, Rah Digga be the rhythmic
Cutie who can shit raps, like government get kickbacks
Hit em overseas with the hellified remix
Cause everything I hustle, like Blaj and Jay-Z shit
I want my videos filmed on location
Blow up the station if I ain't in rotation (yeah)
Knee deep in patients, on a cowboy ranch
Now I found a new branch, Golden Girl like Blanche
Out to take niggas bank, make em walk the plank
Spot's yanked when I make it Big like Tom Hanks
Fuck East, fuck West, I'm comin from up North
Baby tryin to see Glory like the 54th
And I, even set it on all y'all she-rappers
Get out of line I make you look like Wee Papa, Girls
My MC skills are for building
Ship a million, shit square like Sicilian

(Digga) pass me the Henny so I can take another swigger

(Chorus)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes (Rah Digga)]
(Switch it up like Ak-Nel while you hit a dry spell
Cats like you get no reply on the Skytel)
Hate y'all (raps like Eminem hate Britney)
Bonafide (MC) who (fuckin' with me?)
Top niggas better give props nigga

Flip-flop niggas, you could (really get your shit mopped)

Shit'll have that) who could rock (the raw best award, nigga)

A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
And it ain't gon' be pretty, now let me paint the picture
So we can do it hit style, by whipping out the slammers
Or we can go medieval, with spear, shanks and hammers
Now anyway you want it, a bitch is gonna get ya
You playing Daredevil, I'mma be that bitch Elektra
Now you can't even measure, you such a pretty gal
A dropkick from me feeling like a fifty cal'
A bitch is gonna get ya, this really could get dirty
Box cutter in heels, seals thirty thirties
You wanna call my bluff, ya'll nowhere near tough
My shank turn furry Kangols to some earmuffs
Make 'em all scatter like roaches
A bitch is gonna get ya, now who is that approaching
Somebody trynna see me, these jokers miss the memo
They bet about face, 'fore they going out the window
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
I'm jumping in your whip like that crazy ass Hitcher
Sliced ear to ear like F.U. haters
Except you ain't getting saved by no Caped Crusaders
Saying to yourself, yeah that bitch crazy
Think Green River Killer mixed in with John Gacy
Your hits don't phase me, they make me laugh
Now watch me go smack a bitch with my period pad
I said a bitch is gonna get ya, but ya'll already knew that
I catch another body every time I write a new rap
How many of ya'll can do that, you know it's only one of me
All of ya'll for cop shifty, ya'll just some wannabes
A bitch is gonna get ya, you know a bitch coming
It's not T-Pain, when you hear that thing humming
Fully automatic, coming right out the spinner
Call it lead lipo, make that ass look thinner
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, like Wendy with the gossip, or even Miss Info
With all her little topics, little blogging
Yeah, ya'll all know, trynna match O stacking all that Harpo dough
That chick with McCain, since Hilary out the picture, how can I put it bluntly
A bitch is gonna get ya, Digga Digga
Say peace when you see her, that ready to beat her, shit gets uglier
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, bitch I'm gon' get ya
Bitch I'm gon' get ya...[Hook: Busta Rhymes]

On some Mya shit, like "It's All About Me" see?

Bra top, lots of G-strings, havin weed dreams
I'd be Queen if this the 1900's
Cause niggas gon get it, and E'RYBODY want it
I'm totin bags, eyes redder than a photo lab
The spins on your single, won't even top my promo ad
Hard drops quicker than jackers at the car lots
Couldn't get no harder if you went to School of Hard Knocks
The grimy bitch, sometime be punchliney bitch
So don't make me go there! (*starts singing to "The P is Free"*)
Because the groupies are free, but the rhymes cost money..
OH YEAH!!

Chorus 2X

Okay, this is how it goes, pimpin all you, hoes
Catch em outside the shows, time to get the dough
Up in the studio, smokin the hydro
Writin the hot shit, you waitin for me to go
Threw on the Ram' bounce, just shakin yo' ass yo
Bump this in your Lex Coupe or your Expo'
Flipmode Squad, we the ones in them videos
Catch us with the fly shit, but you don't hear me doe
Rampage, professional, just move your feet
We bout to make you do the jerk, get out your seats
Seven days a week and we the Squad that don't sleep
Catch me in the street I'm on the midnight creep, so what?

Chorus 2X

[Lord Have Mercy]
I walk the path, that Allah made, +Smooth+, like Sade
Got pickup trucks -- high-beam with the fog rays
International capital, checks cashed in full
Damage your hood, natural, spend grands for goods
Traditional niggas know -- scream on these players like
DJ call in some mo', invincible pretty flow
Grammar God, swing like gold from Panama
Twenty-four carat charms, with smooth cuts like Sarah Vaughn
Here we go, here we go -- attitude
Spit the vocals hotter than soul food from Baton Rouge
Come, sharp-tongued like Malcolm, on any album
Some got chrome like Sly Stone, what you about son?
Here it is, here it is -- handcraft the raw
Who the boss? Human torch any Fantastic Four
Player, I be a point guard, controllin things
In the 4th quarter, it's all water like Poland Spring

[Hook: Wyclef]
Everyone wants to be a cowboy
Grab your guns boy
.45 by my side, do he live?
No, the nigga die!

[Pacewon]
Zen, zen zen zen zen zen zen
You shot your bullet, but the bullet went ****
"Desperado", new word for "rudeboy"
I pull out my gun and plug two like Trugoy

[Verse 1: Wyclef & Pacewon]
Wyclef
Pacewon
Yo this was how the West was won
(Our motto, a true Desperado)
Rappers want to be actors
So they play the Jesse James Character
(And get they bones fractured)
You ain't got no guns, you off to the precinct
Inside tuff guys are feminine like Sheena Easton
Woman cry, woman cry, Son still dies
Thrown off the building like The Fall Guy
Caved in the grave cause you didn't know how to behave
Playin' cowboy now you sleep with the slaves
Who's the desperado, sellin' bottles in the alley
On some villain shit, wearin' a mask like Jim Carrey
With his gat cocked, stinkin' up the crack spot
Pacewon dies with both eyes on the jackpot
The town that I'm from beggars eat cat chowder
Sundance Kid is the everyday purse snatcher
If you see him coming, you better start running
Like a terrorist I guarantee you he'll be humming
(Dynamite, dynamite, Clef I got the cash)
Yo let's skip town like Harlem nights

[Verse 2: Rah Digga & Lauryn Hill]
We make moves in stage coaches
Rah Digga likes the roaches
If anyone approaches
We be like noches, buenos
And I compose a poem for the many gun-slingers
R&B singers, perpetrating guns with two fingers
My style is perhaps one of the foulest
I inhale large clouds of smoke through my chalice
(Buckin' at stars) and write rhymes for hours
The ghetto missy, drinkin' whiskey sours
Bust this scenario, can't no other niggers in the barrio
From North to Ontario, bust us when we in stereo
Cause me and Rashida rock the battles
It's apparent, your no talent, cause your blazin' in your saddle
Watch these rap bitches get all up in your pockets
Then bounce with accountants that give me good stock tips
Cause props is up, Digga's through the roof
Burnin' niggers like I'm 90 proof
And for all you head beaters
The lead eaters, the cheaters soon to be retreaters
While mamacitas carry real heaters
I rock the Dooby and L rocks the Nubian twists 9-6
Motherfuckers gettin' dissed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Zee & Praz]
Yeah, when the OUT's hooked up with the Refugees
It be more niggas than the NAACP
Comin' up on weed of all type
Smokin' home-grown out tobacco pipes
(You've got to know when to hold them
Know when to fold them)
I can take the sunshine, piss in your wine
Steal your concubine, walk away with your goldmine
(So ooh aaah achiga, Mamase Mamasa Mamakusa)
Fuck the sheriff, I shot John Wayne
Push him off the runaway train in the movie Shane
Yeah me and that kid, um "What's his name?"
That would be me, Young Zee from No Brain
Smokin' pure from the health fodd store
While my whore slaps cops like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Fuck with OUT's it's like those Islam brothers
We march through your hood with a million muthafuckas
So let's get high off the Fu-Gee-La
When the east is in the house, like I'm Blahzay-blah

[Verse 4: Forté]
When pandemonium strikes, at midnight
Full moon splits soft niggas in a lunatic
On some absurd shit
You talk back, hustlin' crack don't make you bigger
Niggas who take your measurements quick, don't make it quicker
Stick and slide with vigor
City streets hot like liquor
21 gun salutin', shootin' niggas from the roof and
Got nerve to mouth about it and the weight you claim you movin'
Your whole style is loose and we gon' sew it like it's cotton
You fail to recognize that everybody could get gotten
The bounty on your head, says your dead by manana
Pop babies whisperin' that there's a body dropped, behind the lot
Police blew up the spot and locked the whole block
Medina is the east side of town lounge never till we yawnin'
Gun players regular front page is the bonus
Life will keep existing while I'm shitin' on opponents
Life will keep existing while I'm shitin' on opponents

[Hook][Hook]

[Rah Digga]
Do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah!)
Do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah!)
Put it down for the bitches all across the map
All the real live bitches all across the map
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

[Verse 1: Sonja Blade]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I'm on the roll like butter
Flow gutter, fuck what a bitch going through
Do or die is what you gon' do
I warn you it's gonna get you and your guys killed
With my skills stay on your toes like high heels
And handle bars like bikes 'bout to blow like innertubes
See me in the tube in the views to interludes
Never see me in the nude, Blade gon' bend the rules
Lock the street coming through with more rocks than Pete
I'm into jewels I will not repeat
Y'all obsolete, Sonya Blade y'all
It's murder when they drop the beat
I spit it once
I'm hungry spit at lunch
One take, I hate boxes so I don't punch
I got a hunch, y'all figure
Y'all gon stop my figgas
Get on some rah-rah with Eve and Rah Digga
But these my niggas so please my niggas
Stop the Blade from where you don't know nann nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eve]
Yo, yo now why y'all wanna make me get raw
This bitch gon split ya, get tha picture
Call yourselves emcees, titles don't even fit ya
How they gonna stop us Digga?
Try-na shine, the rest of them bitches
Is past tense and out of time
Cause my time line consists of many dreams shattered
Trying to run up with two ryders deep as if it mattered
When real bitches get to rockin', heads knockin'
All dem chickens in their coupe gon do is get to squawkin'
All the hating do is feed my temper, let me live
Ice grillin' eyein' my clothes, I'm eyein' the crib
E-V-E spell it out when you speak about her
The only one out the bunch to hate
The rest gon crowd around her
Majority rules, it's our time, back the fuck up
Cause the shit you sayin' out your mouth
Make me crack the fuck up
Laugh hard cause we pass y'all so dash broad
Lay my shit by myself in the booth
While y'all need flash cards

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rah Digga]
Yeah, check it out now Like that y'all
Watch me sink three points
Smash your whole LP with just my lead joint
It's the rhyme super bitch gon' stay forever wildin'
Smooth with the pen, Shakespeare, Edgar Allen
Hot chick, catastrophic, blast the hot shit
Your whole verse whack and bare no facts or logic
Smash your clique in
Y'all niggas only heard tidbits
I put that on Gabana every rhyme I done spitted
One-two, one-two
Your whole crew I dismantle
Rock fly gear and stay clear of sex scandals
With drogues to spark wait for shows to start
My put my niggas down if they know their parts
Caramel give 'em hell from Bricks to Anadel
Rappers try-na compete get ate like Samuel
By a sister who twist a few L's rip it dually
The song say It Ain't My Fault like Mystikal

[Hook 2x][Rah Digga]
Yeh, check it out now (uhh uhh uhh)
Rah Digga y'all, Dirty Harriet (uhh!)
Kweli, Xzibit, new millenium! (C'mon, check it)

[All] One, two, three, four
[Rah] Grimy bitch stomp the bogey outside your front door (yeah)
Puffin on Goodie, eatin tuna and rye
Blow the spot with some old school shit from junior high (HEYYY!)
[All] One, two, three, four
[Rah] Jersey's finest in the house, punchlines and metaphors
Make your foul ice grill, thug grimy on the real
Puttin heads to bed like Hennessey and NyQuil

[Rah Digga]
Convertible style, still had the heat knockin
Bumpin shit from way back with my man beatboxin
Shootin the breeze - see I'm nice with these
You'll be suckin it down like fast food high-C's
Type of rap bitch that love underground classics
Gettin more green than that nigga St. Patrick
Makin wack rappers go and merc the set {*dial-up sounds*}
Better off behind a desk tryin to surf the net
Cause I be adamant, kill 'em when my joints get added in
Worse than boric acid in your project cabinet
Dirty Harriet, increase the fanbases
Leavin non-writin cats stuck on the plantations
Mini-skirts with tights, eatin lunch with whites
Leave the party over here like they Israelites
Got Cali Brooks critics, Ta' Kwe'(??) Xzibit
Gonna rock shit down like he can't get no visits

[All] One, two, three, four
[T.K] Rock the whole world like the Rolling Stone tour (AH-AHHH!)
Raw your wack set is faker than a bomb threat
By a nervous terrorist who's so scared that his palms wet
[All] One, two, three, four
[T.K] The stuff legends are made of, urban folklore
Like Jim Morrison we break on through
Before I care about your take on me, we take on you

[Talib Kweli]
Yo, yo, yo
We bring it straight to your face from the start, yo
Rage Against the Machine, break it apart
Might be over your head, but it's straight from the heart
I show my love in the light while y'all hate in the dark
Straight to apocalypse is where I'm takin the art
Givin niggas battle scars, ALWAYS makin my mark
You fakin the part of gangster, til niggas break in your spot
You straight bitch whether I say it or not
Shit is hot, spittin flames on the track
Put our town's names on the map
From now until we fadin to black
Where we at? Thug rebels love metal clubs ghetto
When the slugs let go like Frankie Beverly
Forever we stack notes like the treasury, flow heavenly
Get you high on speech laced with obscenity
Niggas be gassed like Cipha Sounds, and need rescue remedy
Then fall the fuck off like limbs affected with leprosy

[All] One, two, three, four
[X2z] Why the fuck can't MC's MC no more?
Hardcore til somebody put me under the ground
With a dick in your ear, still couldn't fuck with my sound
[All] One, two, three, four
[X2z] Takin me straight to the weed spot, then to the liquor sto'
"Gimme Some Mo'" like Busta Bus', who do you trust?
Swingin through, your favorite neighborhood lush

[Xzibit]
I'm i-rate, usin your body for live bait
Xzibit rockin them heavy gems you can't take
Dilate, cock back the weight, spread hate
Heavy metal we settle and set shit straight
Hit gates in my younger days, from the policeman
Me and my clan used to dance thicker than quicksand
Supply and demand the hand is quicker than the eye
Find some chickens to fry, while you find it hard to stick to your lie
I see through the tricks, destroy the facade
Your little lungs is too weak to hotbox with God
Rah Digga, First Lady of the Flipmode Squad
Gotta be hard like a young nigga walkin the yard
For the first time, we ain't the niggas you let shine
Expect mines to blow lines like coke everytime
I'm an Alkaholik nigga so I finish the fifth
You at the front door bitchin because you ain't on the list

It's like
[All] One, two, three, four..

Yeah (ohhhhhhh) hehehe (aight y'all, aight y'all..)
Yeah (here we go)
[All] One, two, three, four..[Intro]
See, cute time is over
I’m about to roll up my sleeves on these bitches
I’m about to take my earrings off
Don’t make me take my earrings off
Throw my hair back real quick
Throw my Chucks on
Quit playing with these motherfuckers

[Hook]
I’m on some Kung Fu Hustle shit
Scream lady with no muzzle shit
Y’all don’t really wanna tussle with
Brick City, we be on that Bumpy Knuckles shit
Or had ‘em boys turn into some real duffle shit

[Verse 1]
Shanks and hammers, now wait for the cameras
Waste a lone gangsta, don’t need no bandannas
Rhyme hard but those darts even harder
Y’all talking about murders, but all I see is martyrs
One, three, go—watch me blow
Right past these niggas and these knock-kneed hoes
I ain’t really need for the small talk, y’all walk that a way
Baby don’t cry, [?]
See I don’t want to have to get indignant
Hollywood to Miss Urban in a minute, Nicole Kidman
No smidgen of upbringin’, fuck swingin’
Guns by the waist, I’mma punch ‘em in the face

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This vaseline-on-the-face type music
This badda-bing-in-your-face type music
Y’all don’t want it with them born-again hooligans
Type of bitch that stab your ass with a [?] pen
No metaphysical, more like mega-physical
Too deep in this piece to let a typical
Bum trick try to score one, I implore one
A rain dance, but it won’t be a George one
A rated-R, be a violence-and-gore one
A Pharaohe-Monch-now-we-callin’-it-war one
Get-trampled-before-they-get-out-the-door one
Then I’m goin’ on a tour (One!)
January, February, March, April, dag
Some saying that I’m too hard, I think they just
(Hey! Not supposed to say that word!)
Too late—all these rappin’-ass faggots getting punched in the face

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I smell a rumble, welcome to the jungle
Don’t be a smart-ass, cats be disgruntled
Won’t be satisfied till one of us son you
Russian mafia-style punk, do svidan-you
Always been a little loud mouth foul mouth
Third round, they already got the towel out
I pow-wow with skateboarders and [?]
Shits and giggles, all y’all do is take orders
Huh! I play it under with abused bitches
You only here for my amuse, bitches
Give it your best shot, I take two of y’all
You probably have better luck with a voodoo doll
Look, not the hands, nope not the [?]
Never get beatdowns ‘cept when I box with my mom
You’re cool, I’m cool, hey chick, choose your fate
We can have play dates or get punched in the face

[Hook][Chorus: Dionna Nichelle]
Silly little girl, in a men's world, wish I could fly
Dilly lilly pearl, caught up in a twirl, of a butterfly
Ladadadadi, ladadadada, wish I could fly
Silly little girl, caught up in this world, of lullaby

[Rah Digga]
See when the, mics go on, the lights go on
It's like Muhammad Ali, and Tyson sparring
I take a, stab at you, a jab at you
I do 'em, Carrey style, I make 'em laught at you
Try me, ain't nothing worse than a little defeat
From trying to weak a sleeping giant that ain't even asleep
I'm not your ordinary shorty, I be bobbing and weaving
Don't even give me no excuses, just to knock a few teeth in
Bust a shot like it's semen, you do not want to see it
Have you in predicaments, you do not wanna be in
The last man to try, the last man to die
Wiggle my toes, then turn to the last samurai
Move, who not to scare to die, we runnin' wit our spears
To the sky, screaming Bis Mi Allah
So please be advised, cuz she's gonna light up the trails
Better listen to them old wise tales

[Chorus]

[Rah Digga]
Without warning, shit could get real appaling
And invalid, don't even know what to call it
S.I.O., or you could call me bad business
Talking eyes, while your boys in the hood, down to menace
The skull smasher, basher, chicken head mangler
Then use you as a tool for my misplaced anger
The dude ripper, cuz they don't even see me come out
I blind side 'em, 'fore they can even get they guns out
Now who next to try, who next to die
What you call fighting for your life, I call exercise
Huh, coming through, looking like Lucy Liu
Whipping shanks out, running down the block, WHOODI-WHO
Ooh, you acting all intusive, we rolling kinda deep
Up in this piece, now don't be foolish
Don't make a sister lose it, that would not be condusive
But wouldn't be the first time people die, for something stupid, stupid

[Chorus]

[Outro: Rah Digga]
Here we go, baby, it's Dirty Harriet
Digga digga ya'll[Intro]
Ha ha ha haaaa!
Yeah, what the fuck
Outsidaz, we be a hard act to follow
We be a hard act to follow
We be a hard act to follow
Yeah, baby
Hard act to follow
Ha, yeah
So come on and come on
So come on and come on
So come on…

[Verse 1: Yah Yah]
Yah Yah
And I’ve been black balled and outlawed like 2Pac's posse
Still no cops, the neighborhood watch could stop me
I’m like Selassie driven in a Dodge Jeep
The God’s peace while i civilise Rah's beef
Unbelievers fall in 2000 leavers
Landing more needles than the route of all evil
Dom perignon, henny
Outsidaz, cause we all scary
Shells Buried from in hell’s very
Skunk glary, my 51 Chevy, gun's near me
Squatting on the wheelie with them truck jewelery
Come on

[Verse 2: Young Zee]
You got a big mouth, when you rap
I whip my dick out
And mouth-slap you and make you kiss my out tattoo
And leave you with wet stains until you bleed red rain
And for the next days you’ll need fucking X-rays for your chest pains
The Outz splurging for drinks, so I bought a round
Fuck the quarter pound, bitch, we lock this corner down
In a fact, you’ll be robing in a black pea coat
I’ll eat gold and flip the remote while you main bitch do me a deep throat
And word is raw since we all can’t get along til I’m dead and gone
Y'all gon' all get shitted on
Come on now

[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!

[Verse 3: Azz-Iz]
Azz-Iz high as space high
You blonders state side, take sides
And get ate like steak fries
Unwise guys stuffed with televised lies
Till headaches buy size
Blood sung: sci fi
Off the wet pep, I need dregs and take lives
The raw rasta, bang harder and breaks the boxer
Flow's aqua, spada, lada void cutta
Burn ‘em, rip the infrared gutta
And the horror the terror for ya pappa sick and bye bye
Send a chopper, die before ya reach the doctor
C’mon!

[Verse 4: Slang Ton]
It's tha iza mashtons
I ya wanna hit your ass kicked, just hit the av and pick ya stash with sixty bags and
Get this fucking filling craft and get the matches
I smoke more than 50 chimney hatches
I'm never quick to passin'
I smoke and choke off Simon split this pattern
Rip-o-matic, tris-o-matic
Shit, I've had it, get the average nigga blasted
In a half a second, Slang the Fattest on a record
And check it, I ain't half this racket till that ass get naked
Settle for cash and slap, kid, pass the necklace

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Product of espionage
Pissed drunk on pepsi and Scotch
Sticking my fucking foot up a lesbian's crotch while pedestrians watch
Gangsters bow down to a mightier villian
There might be a million outsidaz
Hiding on the side of your building
Say goodbye to your children
Notify your next to kin
Bring some extra men
If anyone on your team expects to win
The effects of gin made me a smart ass with a bossy mouth
Six bouncers had to come and toss me out some coffee house
It ain't a riddle
After you flat line in the hospital
While I'm in the middle row at your funeral wake
Fucking your widow
Someone call the nurse and tell her to strap me down I need a harness
I bleed bizarreness
Spitting blood like Kiss' lead guitarist

[Verse 6: Rah Digga]
Now who be yappin‘ ‘bout they shit the bomb
With them stife-ass tricks you tryna sell nickles for dimes
Boys, I’m that bitch
Chump change be 6 digits
Doing remixes for all them R and B bitches
Ya motherfuckin‘ rosters
Be filled with imposters
Digga not fresh like Lil Kim singin‘ gospel
‘Cause we be the tightest in this whole rap race
You get your contract cancelled like Homeboys In Outer Space
Come on

[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)

We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!Rah Digga
The Harriet Thugman of hip hop has returned baby
C'mon!

[Verse 1]
I be that house nigga squatting in the lab
Rhymes comin, rhymes goin like I was a dollar cab
Fingerin the man tryin to tap into his spirit
A misguided soul so ain't checkin for the lyrics
Many different players, only one hold the ball
Ghetto fabulous chick, go against the protocol
With the grittiest lingo, still such a little sweetheart
Book educated with a whole lotta street smarts
Follow me now, as I build my fanbases
Makin rappers worry like they got open cases
Harriet Thugman, bout to see shit through
Like a whole world of people wait for Episode Two
I be the rap purist, the walking hip hop thesaurus
The innovator, spawned from Libra and Taurus
Do away cats with the same ol' whack
Lead a nation up north where the real party at
A place where we spray when our asses get older
No shots in the throat, no gettin pulled over
A place where graffiti ain't considered a crime
And your favorirte underrated MC's is primetime
A land good and fruitful, where lyrics free people
Black presidents, and all the weed legal
No rich or poor, we break bread and drink merry
Smoke a little Mary for the real visionaries[Talib Kweli]
Yo you sent out the signal right?
And this is what happened
The voice of Hip Hop got heard
Never comprimised this is how we put it down c'mon

[Kool G Rap]
Throughout my thug life I've seen the most trife
Like ??? fighting over the roll of dice
Flashing whole lights when killas on a hiest
So contight, get poltergiested over the bowl of Christ
Who pulled the slice from cats aiming gats at shoulder height
Told you right, G be the one that come and hold the mic
And aim it at the whole vice squad that's out patrolling nights
Rollin like every prototype was Dolomite
One man be cold as ice inside his gun hand he holds for life

[Rah Digga]
This for those who pose in they grave
Waitin for they piece when the law misbehave
I say we fall deep, watch 'em walk the beat
Like you can't cross streets make em all retreat
(now) Judges and the jury be a little too appointed
Ending up defendants when we supposed to be the plaintiffs
Laugh now cause soon the thrill stops when
Heads get it on and start to kill cops

[Sporty Theivz]
I'm sober they pulled me over
What I do yo? (what we do yo?)
Po-po go I'm drivin too slow (cool yo)
I torin' them explorin them (damn)
Four of em that's why I'm ignoring them (uh-oh)
Think quick, brain like, King skip
Before they bring this to some Rodney King shit
Forget them fools
Nah make no sudden moves
They reachin for they tools (let's move)
You buggin Dubez
Kirk you ran the stop, word them pigs frontin
Yo tell that kid something cousin we ain't did nothin
All they see is three blacks in a jeep with seats back
Lookin for G packs how the blood dog can eat that
They thirst to find a reason to blast you can't peep that?
Gats and a badge to match you can beat that so bounce 'em

[Mos Def]
My people unite and let's all get down
We gotta have what? love peace and understandin
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight
My people unite, hop up and do it right
We gotta have what? love peace and understandin
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight
My people unite, hop up and do it right
Do it right ya'll, keep it tight ya'll, do it right ya'll, just do it

[Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Blood on they hands, blood on my mans
Destroying the fam
More soldiers die, another mother cries
Anthony Baez, Eleanor Bumpurs, Diallo
Let it keep happenin and there's more to follow
It's even deeper then that penal shot in the back
Forever we fight and cuss but the world still injust
So many bullets just to stop one man
Is that the plan
To leave us all dead in the street

[Common]
I'm an opponent of violence
Too many of my guys have become moments of silence
Law takes lives and condone it through sirens
And night sticks I write quick
Hopin that

[Talib Kweli and Common]
I might hit somebody in the heart

[Talib Kweli]
Like an arrow with her eyes on a sparrow
Yo I feel my people pain all in my bone marrow

[Common]
I'm tellin Pharaoh to let my folks go
Monsters singin to law like they background vocals

[Talib Kweli]
Local, state, federal cops have been paid properly
To protect the property
How can I just stand by and watch a man die for nothin and not react
The way we spit on this track is how we bustin back

[Common]
Yo I pimp slap 5-0
Get behind them and make the marks drive slow

[Talib Kweli]
Yo, you wanna know how to improve on the quality life?
Try respectin it step in my zone with that madness and I'm checking it

[Pharoahe Monch]
Cops they transport me from Long island to Medina
With they fucked up demeanor
Dreamin of stickin it to me like Abner Louima
Pharoahe slash El-Hajj Malik Shabazz
In the flesh, with plans of retaliations for your coward ass
God please allow me to preach for 'em
A voiceless man through a spirit I speek for him
Step to city hall for delf, do it for dolo
With visions of cops inside the Public Enemy logo

[Posdnous]
All that scheming and plotting
The young absorb like cotton
Especially in my city where the poor is steady rotting
And you would thought 5-0 would cut it all short
But they play the biggest part in the art of living wrong
In our land cops guns clap more then hands
As if we don't deserve what they hear to preserve
We just tryin to do it right in these boroughs that we reppin in
While they trying to fill us with more Led then Zeppelin

[Everyone Lead by Mos Def]

Flipmode the Imperial
You know you love it when you hear us on the radio
Go cop the joint and play the shit up in your stereo
Or in the streets up in your Jeeps or in the disco
And if you want the fly shit, my nigga here we go
You know it's Digga lookin pretty in the video
With Bus-a-Bus up in the cut but you don't hear me though
Just when you think we done we hit y'all we got plenty mo'
Blow!

(Rah Digga)
It be's the little mama, lip gloss and eyeliner
The only shit poppin like White Castle or the diner
Rah Digga make the joints that the DJs blast
Ghetto diva in the Source with the 3 page ad
Watch as the hood rat messiah climb swiftly
Labels scarred to death to let their artist bomb with me
Cause you can send your thuggest MC and watch me son 'em
The ruggedest bitch, don't even rhyme about gunnin
Got joints circulating like them old karate flicks
Buncha Rah Digga shirts on some big body chicks
Throw my shit in your hoopty or your luxury trucks
And make the quickest turn around like 'dro for 20 bucks
And I'll still be the greatest if this rap shit fail me
Back to jackin bootleg flicks from out the deli
Livin off the interest
Sippin on Tequila with my logo on the side of fuckin 18 wheelers

Chorus

(Busta Rhymes)
Ay yo yo yo
Raze and dazzle niggas like ya'll
Spray niggas like you and dismantle niggas like y'all
I got the thing that'll majorly handle niggas like y'all
Fight y'all, bust a semi and cancel niggas like y'all
I know some joke niggas who love to hassle niggas like y'all
Talk, and fix and simply dance on niggas like y'all
Trample niggas like y'all
Make examples outta niggas like y'all
Grit their teeth and cock the hammer up inside the dance hall
Thugs, here's another sample for niggas like ya'll
Or for the ones who pass and light a roman candle for niggas like y'all
Fight for niggas like y'all
Grad the mic from motherfuckers like y'all
Blow the spot in the night for all my niggas like y'all
My get high niggas, I blaze for niggas like y'all
Stink the spot up with 'dro now spray the fuckin Lysol
You know we be the ultimate
We fuckin with some other shit
And when we hit y'all
Yes, we sit and watch ya'll niggas ride the dick

Chorus

(Busta Rhymes)
A'yo, clap and slap up a nigga for talkin lotsa wack shit
While I roll around with the Harriet Thugman of this rap shit

Black chick, with intellect, who wanna match wits?
Write my own rhymes so can't no nigga tell me jack shit

(Busta Rhymes)
Master shit, Flipmode exclusive across the map and shit
Presenting the first lady of the squad so give me dap and shit

Sayin' peace when you see me, play the role like Ally Sheedy
And I ain't gon' join ya cipher if the weed's too seedy

(Busta Rhymes)
Yo, make sure you see what we doing now, put on your binoculars
Then I gas ya like a paid latino down at Banco Popular

(Rah Digga)
Rah Digga underground and gon' always blow the spot for ya
Longest runnin shit since the Phantom of the Opera

(Busta Rhymes)
Bus-a-Bus, going down as one of the greatest spoken philosophers
Holding a 12-shot semi with a little red dot for ya

First and only female unmatched by anyone
Rip it from old school to the next millennium

[Spliff Star]
Never judge a nigga like the cover of a book
Fuck around and get shot back of the foot
Nigga fall, stumble and look, nervous and shook
Dragged in the alley and book and beat down to a pulp

[Roc Marciano]
Shot up my copse, Dirty Harry
You stickin me is like niggas fuckin the Virgin Mary

[Busta Rhymes]
Shit we carry, will have you found layin down somewhere damp and muddy
Split your tummy, puncture your kidney and make you piss bloody
So now I leave your body to rott
Where bitches sell they pussy for rock
Cook they coke in steamin water boil in a pot

[Baby Sham]
Do you know niggas like us that clutter they watch
Invest in yo' block, like it or not, involvin your pops

[Rampage]
You messin wit a rhyme surgeon
Trade the GS for the Excursion, heads is turning
Flipmode we still mergin

[Rah Digga]
Now we splurgin in Suburbans
Dirty Harriet rock the camouflage turbans
Said one for the money and two for mic check
And spit a million rhymin words in 240 seconds

[Lord Have Mercy]
Get three to get your bitch neck, and four to even the score
Graveyard shift it's best that y'all believe in the law

[Roc Marciano]
Flipmode like Mary Lou Retton
Suede ballie, shoe steppin do the best that I can can

Right outta your mouth and fuck your life up

[Prelude Background]
[Hook]

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us

[Rampage]
Before all the plaques and the source awards
Y'all niggas wanna dick ride so jump aboard
It's a first class ass whippin, Rampage, I ain't trippin
Check all the magazine clippins

[Spliff Star]
Yo I pluck pigeons, get brains in Expeditions
Cause friction, every chick I stick my dick in
I'm not trustworthy like midnight I'm pickin
Spliff keep it warm like wool caps to mittens

[Lord Have Mercy]
Watch for me in a new milli, kick up dust with my shoe shitty
New Jack City, wicked ways move wit me
Holla mine, any violent times crooks bear malice
White collar crime, Columbine, weak clear classes

[Roc Marciano]
Burn a nigga into ashes, how I mashes ass like Cassius
Finger jabs, I got it mastered, fantastic
Writin half ass shit, splash kids
Poke em with the bassonet in the neck, graphic

[Baby Sham]
Can't tell I'm from QB the way that I talk
Speakin in tongue, with six blocks callin my dun
Bogie collapsed lung, big and small gats we brung
Bangin your drums with hot shit and more to come

[Busta Rhymes]
But then we manifest the truth
The niggas like predictions from the Bible
Betrayal for niggas is suicidal

[Rah Digga]
Kick swift shit niggas rock harder than Limp Bizkit
Dirty Harriet floodin all through your district

[Prelude Background]
[Hook 2x][Q-Tip]
African American with the power, just tapped in to the cultural gin
That be swalloin our minds, whole, but yo must it
Empty ass rappers get me fueled and disgusted
Can't even kick a rhyme about yourself properly
Listen man I'll show you why you ain't toppin me
Apitamy a levelheadedness
Whose concern is how ill I come off and how that ill that I dress
I don't, hit you with a whole bunch of bullshit
On the microphone I keep my pros fluid
Speakin to them people in a Tongue that's Native
Not with an ego that's anti-creative
Concious to the fact that I'm a talented lad
Make your move at a jam and feel better when sad
Hey, "asalaam alaikum" to them firm true believers
Hope yall pretty good as the message reciever
Cause yo we got to take things in-to our own hands
And be aware of these dangerous, plentiful lands
That we exist within and combat and shake on
But do it over Tribe because Tribe is the bomb
We get through, especially if you got my back
The Abstract use machete cuttin down on slab
And we do it like this, rarely do we miss
Catch you in the chest with an egale claw fist
And back you, get it two by four and she'll lack you
Tip you only find a nigga now that out raps you
Or gets at you, and insists that you do it
Cause you make it smooth and you make it like fluid

[Q-Tip](Rah Digga){chorus}
Sometimes I just be wonderin
How these cats be com-in IN
..........
I think we need to rectify this right?
(And show these muthafuckas how we Mardi Gras)

(Rah Digga)
The name's Digga and I'm on, a mission to be larger
Than them crackers that be running Time Warner [That's-right]
I take it further, even runnin' shit in Persia
With acquisitions and merges
"You takin' me?" I might have you stressin
"Your rap styles clear," but I'm the only danger pressin
Rah lyrics with "UMMAH" productions
Be "phater" than a chick that had liposuction
They wasn't ready, for that which came
T'was a slim little hunny after the fat bitch sang
I break it down like quadratic equations
You luke warm, my shit hotter than cajuns
[Lacin]Stop, you ain't even worth my while
Mama boy tryin to play it like he motherless child
The whole rap industry is another evil
They play enough times then I just might believe you
Heads was still rhymin Glock with Glock
I was puttin shit together phater than T. Shirley murda
Ain't nuthin but a buncha, thornes in my side like you was acupuncture
Bust it, playin post with me? that's unruley
No matter how loose you'll still be a muley
It's Rah Digga from the O-U-T's
Having bullshit rappers going "Whoa it's" me

[Q-Tip]
We domonstrate MC and their music
Laced with the real P-funk you must choose it
We Buck Rogers, aiyyo we sun you like Twiggie
Girls be like (he's jiggy), and they friends be like (who is he?)
Mastering the mic like Jordan with the pill
Showing a nigga love cause a nigga got skills
A little sumthin sumthin, corny cats must flee
Rah Digga forms the lines with the Ab' MC

(Rah Digga)
Ahhhhh....
Peace Tip, the love flows abundant
To paste one, the underdopeless and youngin
Rappers be off on a tangent
I could flow longer than the van with
Backwards stand smith
When I go bring the noise
I sweep rappers by the "Bunch" like they Brady's boys
So change your sound 'fore I claim that crown
That's for all yall home girls on dangerous groudns

[Q-Tip](Rah Digga){chorus X4}
Sometimes I just be wonderin
How these cats be com-in IN
..........
I think we need to rectify this right?
(And show these muthafuckas how we Mardi Gras)

[Yeah yeah Native Tongue's in the house](Mmm, hmm)
[Yeah yeah Outsider's in the house](Outsiders in the hosue)
[Yeah the UMMAH's in the hosue](UMMAH's in the house)
[Big Tribe in the house][Wyclef]
Hold on now, don't die now, be strong now
He said, I was born a crack baby
In a plastic bag in the alley
Raised in a foster home
With no mother to love and I never knew my papi
Back in the days of Bobby McFerrin
Used to sing don't worry, be happy
Lord how can I be happy
When I don't even know my own family tree Lord

[Wyclef]
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life
Cos I don't know what's there on the other side
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

[Wyclef]
Gang poppin' things, doing drive-by's and angers
Kids going to school putting fears in their teacher
The teacher let them know that it ain't all good
Cos the gang was created to protect the neighborhood, now
All you red now, all you blue now
All you yellow now, follow me now
To that place of righteousness
Where the only thing that matters is your consciousness, he said

[Wyclef]
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life
Cos I don't know what's there on the other side
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

[Wyclef]
In my father's kingdom there are many mansions
All the rooms are free, there is no tax collection
I can see Biggie, 2Pac, Moses and Abraham
Jason, the one and two's, jamming with the sun of man

[Scarface]
I've been kicked, I've been stabbed
I've been shot, I've been ? by a
Person that I thought I trusted, where I live
It's a war at the cribs, walk with a strap
Myself cos I don't want nobody's son on my back
My mind playing tricks ?, to really ?
Me out in five unless I take another hit
I done seen the sun set on the other side of town
Now I'm drifting in the darkness, Heaven hold me down
? ? ? but I know I'm born dying
Feel the tears of the angels looking down on me crying
For a lying ass but yo forgive us in a while
And I'm sorry, never let me forget that I'm your child
While I'm locked up in this basement staring eye to eye with Satan
In this cold dark world with no patience
We get plotted on by agents with talks of replacing
The Africans, Jamaicans and the Haitians in this next generation

[Wyclef]
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life
Cos I don't know what's there on the other side
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

[Rah Digga]
Whoa, we the next generation, look at what we facing
The kids raise themselves, all kind of temptation
Flowers and candles decorating all the pavements
No, the perpetrator ain't seeing no arrangements
Nobody cares about the feelings of the poor
Man they suffer while we spending eighty billion on a war, uh
Cutting school budgets, US stockmarket plummets
Condition's only worse and I wonder what become it
Metal detectors replace music classes
Angry little kids wanna beat their teacher's asses
The red and blue's, somebody gotta lose
Reality TV be reality for who
I don't question what the Lord found in me
I just pass it on to folks with no boundaries
Got a long road ahead of us, AIDS already gettin' us
Now we got SARS, how many will there be left of us

[Wyclef]
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life
Cos I don't know what's there on the other side
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try
