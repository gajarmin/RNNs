[Refrain: John Legend]
I'm calling (Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)
All my (Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (Maybe I'm selfish)
Let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with no one
But me, baby

[Verse 1: T3]
To my thick chicks down in Texas
All the way to New Orleans where the girls cook catfish
And in LA every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass to sell a lot sex
And Hot Atlanta y'all is one of the best
Where they speak Southern slang and smoke la cess
And New York women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feeling myself too much I guess
But to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
Whether you see me in streets or catch me at shows
I'm calling

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And don't be tryin to come around my girl acting like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
Get your own, I got Paris he got Nicky
He tried to get em a clone
He said yeah you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
Can I please, say my peace
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heat rocks
Spit like a beat box, the way the beat rocks
New version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switch my girls around like 3-el-dub
I'm calling

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
What up Pam how your little man doing in New Jersey
Last I heard he caught the flu and you was worried
Hope he feels better
And thanks Jonetta from Cleveland
For that good head in your Jetta better believe it
Shanice you're my piece from Compton
Before I'm off the plane make sure you cop some trees and spark up
Danielle ATL got them pictures in the mail
You sealed with a kiss and you send it with Chanel
You looking good in that one showing off your body
Had a Beverly Hills Mami that would buy me Carti's
Take me to after parties her name was Carrie
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch I'm sorry
But, hey Kim how's Minneapolis, you so pretty
Hate to show off your titties for silly classes
Cause I love you girls though you ain't mine
I wish my arms was long enough to hug you all of the same time

[Refrain x2][Hook]
To fall in love
With the things you do
Don't sell yourself
To fall in love
With those things you do

[Verse 1: Baatin]
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep
I'm the motherfucker gripping the mic like it's a joke
Niggas fall in love with the music like its a ho
Put down your mic you lost your whole flow
You take it too seriously like it's a gamble
Fuck this rap shit I listen to classical
In the studio loop as usual
Loving my lyrical
Fuck bitches that you would know
I'm out of this cause you wanna be below
Y'all niggas in love with the S
Y'all niggas in love with the S

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T3]
Yeah, JD man I see sometimes
I sit and wonder when I think about these written rhymes
How'd I get to the point constantly taking all my time?
Time I could of been spending gettin' cash, gettin' mine
Hoping one day it comes around
One day when I'm
The nigga gettin' money, gettin' cash, gettin' signed
Getting the fuck out the ghetto, cause I'm tired of crime
But it's a crime that I feel this fucking way sometimes
But sometimes I feel like this shit here's a waste of time
Yours and mine
To these niggas out here trying to rhyme
Your reason for it better sure 'nough be genuine
I do it because it gives me a sort of peace-of-mind
And for the love

[Hook]

Yo, one-two
Word up, ah one-two, SV, word up, word up, alright
Uh,uh,uh and to my nigga Jay-Dee uh, uh my nigga T-3 uh, oh
That nigga Baatin uh, uh, that's my crew
Yo, uh, oh this going out to my nigga Bust-a

Trying to get down with us, cause we know you just mad as hell
Yo I'll give em the mic, ehhh! So niggas don't know that I am
T-3 on the mic

(cause?) Cause I get down tonight, yo
Niggas try and put up a fight, wit us, yo alright

Some freestyle shit[Produced by J Dilla]

[Hook]
What is the look of
It got something to do with umm
Being a man and handling your biz
What love got to do with it
Ask SV it's all bullshit
You know what love is
Say it with me one time, you know what love is
SV on some love shit, you know what love is
SV on some love shit, you know what love is
And to the bitches that love dick, and masturbate
No need for that I get down for rap, say word
Take it back, take take it back

What is the look of
It got something to do with umm
Being a man and handling your biz
What love got to do with it
Ask SV it's all bullshit
You know what love is
Say it with me one time, you know what love is
You know what love is, you know what love is

[Verse 1: Baatin]
The motorbot hasn't been slept on for a long time
It's time for me to put my mack down
But in the meantime
Let me tell you bout a bitch named
The woman looked so good she make you masturbate
Come into my life, let me show you how I operate
My name is Rassur, but you can call me a gigolo
My teacher name is, yup yup, you know how we roll
I had a lot of shit to do, back in her astral
Baatin nigga come back to earth
What can I do for you
Back in this bitch, coming through with my new suit
Nigga looking fly, cause you know we got a lot of loot
When I'm on the mic, a nigga throw down his blunt
Just to hear what we say, up in this bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T3]
T3 is on the love tip y'all, you know what love is
Yo the S is on some love tip, you know what love is
T3 is on some love tip, you know what love is
She said I wanna be down with the S
I said, certainly let me taste your splendorness
Busting a Virgo, you were scandalous
Your fragrance got me losing consciousness
Your stance got me unbuckling my fucking pants
Spending clouds of finance on a two dollar romance
To do dick, to the tip, get a lick
Tell a bitch, the S is the shit, so eat a dick
You need to, you need to just give me your clit
As I get nasty like an old porno flick
Oral sex, got me caught up in the {?} bliss
T-Cedric, as I drop this dick between her tits
Yes, you know what love is
Say it with me one now - you know what love is
You know what love is

[Hook][Hook]
Real love, true love
It feels good girl
Tainted love
It's so good girl, real love
True love, it's alright baby tainted love, real love, true love
Tainted love

[Verse 1: T3]
Think of her think of me
Think about us, it's a intimacy
I'm trying to strum like guitars in this beat
And consider riding she'll kick the blahzay spleen
Plus you got a man, but he ain't quite me
The type of man that try to give you what you need
And he wanna know where you are, where you be
Where you going, where you today, where you started to be, damn
If I was him I wouldn't even leave
I would trust you what you say that you are where you been
Say he the type of nigga that's still cheap
Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's
See, I'm the type that try to style in a jeep
Try to take you out to see things and occasionally creep
Yeah, your man is doing things I can't really see
Don't sound too good, it sound tainted to me

[Hook: Dwele] (T3)
Real love (It's so real girl) true love (It's so right girl)
Tainted love (It's real) real love (It's so good girl)
True love (For real love) tainted love (Tainted)
Real love (Yeah yeah) true love (It's so good girl) real love

[Verse 2: Baatin]
How many years does it take for a record to blow?
I'm doing exactly how many licks it took for my hoes
Spending your cash flow cause she was so out ho
Scandal love, cause love full of scandal
Too much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that
Well it's the same tainted love in the music business
People they lose their brain just to get up in this
Let's be a star for day, everything in life is just ok
People say things they don't really wanna say
Hey but it's okay, cause your a star for the day
People a smile at you when they really wanna frown
Well a that's just the way tainted folk get down
Just keep it real and, we'll see
When the situation is tainted love is always free

Love is always free

[Hook: Dwele]
Real love, true love, tainted love, real love
True love, tainted love, real love, true love, real

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
You say you love me, but is it really real?
Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feeling ill
Could you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day?
Dinner by candlelight but you're the main entree
And if so, I do the same with other treats to give you
Trailing rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow
With a bucket of champagne on your night stand
Experience with someone who want in they lifespan
The same...

[Outro: Dwele]
Real love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love
Someone to trust in you for real
Everybody need love; that's real
I would never want nothing tainted
Wait a minute, what you feel?
Faded if your loving was tainted
True, oh, I know true love is hard to find
Just let it find you; for real
If you found love to keep it real
Keep love from being tainted, being tainted
Oooh then you'll, be, alright
(T3: Just sit y'all, Dwele, on more time, y'all, come on)
Then you'll, be, alright[Jay Dee]
You ain't gotta play hard to get
I know you, I know you like the art of sex
I'm putting down my plan like a architect
It's for you, and her, we can all get wet
I got alot of nerve talking this to you right
I'm straight up, and this should make sense to you
Girl you ain't gotta front don't be acting dumb
And if you got the goods, then I want some
I'm tryna get down this ain't no la di da
But I ain't never fucked with a menage a trois
It's three like the stripes on the a-di-das
Getting live like we at the mardi gras
We getting live like we at the mardi gras
Three is the magic number ask my part-i-ner
I be serving that ass like a bar-ten-der
I'm only too bold to be watching ya
I'm only too bold to be watching ya

[Hook]
I want you right here in the world
Being with you all alone
It's like a dream's come true

[T3]
See these things get sold
I'm caught up in ya game I'm kinda tango
Maybe it's the way you sed---huuuu on the down-low
Saying things to me that one and 3 would only know
I wanna tell you though that these things seem to mean
Situations keep you from point A to B
I certainly put a counsel on our mistakes
I got a mission on two girls on a hot beach
Everythings a reach and ain't nobody stoppin' me
It just relax me cause they know I gotta plan for each
Hhhhyeah every body know I gotta plan for each
You know I, you know I gotta plan for each

[Hook]

[Baatin]
Thought you knew Baatin was polygamist
Which one of you queens is coming to get with this
Already got one holdin' my arm in this
But I need a couple to add to my list
Take a position in my world of compassion
Satisfaction, ecstasy
Calling you calling me
I know you yearning for sexual longevity
My name is Baatin Rasul Rasii
Tantric master, sex, two or three
Ecstacy, calling you calling me
I know your hubby ain't giving you no action
Well for one he's too damn masculine
He need to relax, and take some lessons on givin' you climax
All alone, it's like a dream's come true

[Hook x3][Verse 1: J. Dilla]
Uhh, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
Ha, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
You know us, this rap shit we bout to own it
You know it, these Mini-Me's trying to clone us
I got a bonus for the bitch that run up on us
I got a bonus for your bitch that run up on us
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist

[Verse 2: T3]
Uhh, no time to sleep cuz if you sleep you don't eat
Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet
Niggas living on the street while other niggas feast
Aight wit you it ain't aight wit me
Right, gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay fucking bitches many types
Yeah you know what I'm talking bout
Yup, stay turning these bitches out
Dick em down also dick em out
Throw something down whenever my dick's out
They know me so they restructure and reroute
They know me from Washington to down South
All the way to London to my nigga Common house, right
It's like a game we never play out, out, out, out

[J Dilla]
Nigga no doubt, nigga get live or get knocked the fuck out
Word up, just be about what you about dogg
Knowhatimsayin, just play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
You know us, this rap shit we bout to own it
You know it, cause you can feel it in your throat, say it

[Verse 3: Common]
I'm bout to let my mind float
(Com, say it)
Get your third eye poked
Fuck game, I assemble dope
Ness, a nigga that's fresh as the 'fess
Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your B I, feel it in her breasts
Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreamin when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
Still doin this shit like dude in Wild Style
Inviting wack niggas to dinner
I Trick Daddy emcees and I don't know, nann nigga
Who can take it where I take it
You better goin to God like Mase did
Leaving crowds complacent
I move 'em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body

[J. Dilla]
Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want it, need to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy, niggas tryin to clone us
You know us, Thelonious, super microphone
You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real

[Verse 4: Baatin]
Ay, it's like a ritual
You been invited let the mortal body stimulate the place
With the grace, nevertheless, I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for, you aching for the best
Hurtin like a sore in that ass, like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word, cause it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Dropping the line in your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art, never go astray
Word is bond

[J. Dilla]
Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucka nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious
Owning this rap shit, super microphonist and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkist
You want this, see when J get to saying the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime, Off The Wall with mines
I'm grabbing my balls when I rhyme, nine-nines busting plus
Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex
You ain't on my mind I'm thinking bout paychecks
Niggas large like an 8X Avirex jacket
Connant Gardens they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
You funny duke, cause really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday
Thelonious niggas, if you testin us we get you laid back
Show you the definition of a payback[Hook: Dwele]
There's something I wanted to know, can we get closer
Yeah baby, seems like I've waited so long, can we get closer

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Girl you should come up for the week
I'll make you cum from the tub to the sink
Rubbing your feet in a luxury suite
Make sure you come with nothing on just a long shearling
And I'mma make ya toes curl up like they all earlin'
I'll whisper in your ear, tell ya something
Stick my tongue in your bellybutton
Reach down below, you know I'm well sprung
Hit ya from the back to get ya calves trembling
And pull your hair 'til its straight, you look half Indian
Laugh and giggling
With champagne bubbles tickle your nose
Before you I wouldn't throw my old nickels at hoes
I'm just glad we can get close, for breakfast in the morning
We can fly out to Paris, France for the French toast
You made me wait so long and that's a good thing
Now let me make your candy rain dampen your thong
I hit it off like a champion strong, for real
Your still bumpin' and grindin' even after the song but all along I, I

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T3]
Let me talk to ya, feel me for a sec
I love ya sassy ways I must confess
You're lookin' good girl, I hope you into sex
Sort of a model type with a splash of innocence
Your fashion (fash-shon), ass like your moms
I love that Tiffany charm thats hangin' from ya arm
And if we get it on I'mma take her back to the fort
Show her how I run game like an athlete in sport
Sweety I can see that money ain't a thing
Been doin' this for a while no need to explain it
You're doing swell girl, you're never doin poorly
You know I'm hoppin' in whips just look at the jewerly
Plus you need a man in your life
Yo someone who can hit it right, and plus got the right dough
Plus I'll treat you like a queen
Your place or mine I was thinking we should get close

[Hook]

[Dwele]
A lot of cats done tried it
I like to touch the na na, I
Know you act real shy but, know you get down
You're not that type we go
Just keep it low and let it go
No need to act up cause I, know you get down
Can we get closer tonight, I'll make it right
Touch you inside baby, I make you get down
Hold you very close, with or without clothes
Public or closed doors, we will get closer[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Ay yo, wind up on the Today Show
Nightly News Tom Brokaw, broke off and then K.O'd
Lay low, stay where they may blow the yayo
Like Jimi Hendrix in his afro singing Hey Joe
So real, verse me quoting to show skill
You hoes will go to the first thing that smokin' on four wheels
What's that? As far as bars you wouldn't bust back
To me your raps proves your thinking cap is just a dunce hat

[Verse 2: T3]
Yeah all that, (uh, uh ,uh)
I grab my whole sack when I rap
Sudden impact, sorta like Daddy Kane
Ain't No Half Steppin' mane, ain't a new jack swang
Where my crown at, It's like please Lord please
Let me kill these MC's, I be walking on their nuts
Like doormats, ain't no cops to assist, ain't no cuffs to the wrists
I'm a bad son of a BITCH!

[Hook]
1 2, I tell a wack nigga (GO)
That's how we do it, put it down like that
Yeah yeah, I tell a wack nigga (GO)
That's how we do it put it down like that
Yeah yeah, I tell a fake hater (GO)
That's how we do it put it down like that
Yeah yeah, I tell a wack nigga (GO)
That's how we do it put it down like that

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Come through, and mic check one-wuh-one two
To stun you dumb crews to undo my spun screw
Oh no, bring acid to an Average Joe Schmo
But my go-go gadget polo jacket [?] your logo
Oh here's a boss, beneath my mattress is a Nina Ross
To break a man is faker then shaking hands with his fingers crossed
Wink wink, here's a sneak peek of my ink streak
That skeet skeet on your forehead, chin and chick's cheek

[Verse 4: T3]
Let's say, I'm a sick nigga, black born leader, gut beater, paper getter
Yeah dog, it's too late when you see it
I already did it I did done it when you seen it
Fo' sho', and what I said what I mean is
Get the senoritas, get em' drunk off tequilas
So gone, I'm large not centimetres
Sex game crazy, had em' saying "Oh Jesus!"

[Hook]

[Verse 5: T3]
(SWITCH FLOWS!)
When I hit it up, yup yes yes
Put a bullet up, to his chest vest
Gotta broke out when it go through ya
It'll be sure to leave lots of mess mess
This rap shit's a hobby, gotta whole coast many mami's
[?] better also, gotta also, got an arsenal many armies
You fake fucks will never harm me
I'm reminiscent of a kamikaze, get off for that last flow You need to put it in the garbage
I switched it up then did it up, then fillin' up til' you get enough
Then give it up, you feelin us (let's go)

[Verse 6: Elzhi]
Livin' through pitiful critics who cynical
Send a few criminal clips with serial numbers
Bust a slug and budge your blood like women
Through any new menstrual cycle I go psycho my flow stifle
Rise a eyeful, insightful, you right slight bull, and need your stripes pulled
You dead at the end, see never again will you competitors win
I sever the head of a veteran said to be better than lettering spread from my pen
Hardcore, to make you brothers act fools
When I tend to rip you like Chip Fu shtick when the track move
And we out

[Hook][JayDee]
You look and stare
I see you took it there
Wassup wit'chu?
Hey, wassup wit'chu?

A little bit of fact that revolves, the five helluva elements and all

Youse a bitch, I know what's in the mind of a bitch

And we cold rocked the spot...[Verse 1 : T3]
Speak to the hand, I'm Martin, You Tisha Campbell
Tired of livin' this life everyday it's a gamble
Puttin' pieces together that don't even assemble
Feelin' like somebody I don't like but I resemble
I'm so sick up in here and it's time to make moves
I try to blow caps in everything I do
My life is a shame I'm tryin' to just get through
I'm movin' through the trenches
With my mike and my crew
What am I 'posed to do? I got to keep goin'
Shit is happened for me I'm not even knowin'
The storm has passed and yet the flowers still growin'
Still makin' moves, right now shit is on'in
I see a glimpse of life that shines in my face
Warmness in my heart takes me to another place
See right now what I want I can achieve
All I have to do is stick to myself and believe

[Hook]
Where you at, uh-huh
(To all my street niggas makin' money, make it happen ya'll)
Where you at uh-huh
(To my ladys doin' your thing, do it you're the best girl)
Where you at, uh-huh
(To all my Daft Punk people, makin' it happen, keep it movin', let's do it ya'll)
Where you at, uh-huh
(Uh, everybody, everybody ya'll)
Where you

[Verse 2 : Baatin]
Don't make no sense, the way we are
Niggers can't get a chick (chick) without a car
Anybody ask me (me) I been the star (star)
Always knew that one day (day) I would go far
Some of these rap niggers they need a rain check (check)
I don't understand how they got a mic check (check)
Get your head right, true, you look a wreck
And in the mean time we gone get the pay check

[Interlude : Baatin]
You know, no we ain't the ones to judge
But uh, there's people out here
Who are really puttin' it down, and that's real
You know, Slum Village, can't even do our thing
Make it happen yo (tss) like this

[Hook]
Where you at uh-huh
(To my niggas down for the struggle, keep it up baby)
Where you at uh-huh
(My nine to five niggas, street hustlers, roll-the-dice niggas)
Where you at uh-huh
(To all my chicks tryin' to get the paper, keep doin' that)
Where you at uh-huh
(See everybody makin' moves, don't stop keep it all)

[Verse 3 : Elzhi]
You fled Babylon of life and death on a tattered arm
From the drunk who staggered home
To the destructive atom bomb, set to detonate
You wonder why I write so graphic
When here bullets shatter light poles into white snow fragments
It's catastrophic that you picked up on it like an antenna object
You either find your hustle or demand your profit
Instead in the land of plot and schemin'
Cause today's microscopic
Do bifocal fiber-optics
My friends die with suit and ties inside of boxes
Flip me out when you hit the ground like a fightin' ostrich
But life is just a pair of dice droppin'
In mid stumble
A precious jewel you seclude when you in the struggle

[Outro x2]
Where you at uh-huh
Where you at uh-huh
Where you at uh-huh
Where you at uh-huh
Where youYeah SV

[Elzhi]
Yo when niggas blurtin
Its flirtin with death I'm certain
You actin off the wall consider yourself curtains
I'm nasty
You ask me am I disgustin, you bet
I'm like playing russian roulette
Bustin two teks
Straight shittin
I'm great spittin
Get great kitten off the great writtens
I shoulda been born in great Britain
'stead I'm from the Michigan state mitten
I keep a nigga on his toes like he hate sittin
Know your place or get your flow erased
'til you a nobody
So it prolly wouldn't make sense to show a face
Shit was just murdered
I'll leave you with two words: fuck you
Or you fucked, however you wanna word it

[T3]
Shit I mean biz
Put 'em where the maggots is
Who that bad as me
Young Lazarus damn dog it's been a bit
I rise up surprise cuz we the shit
Chillin where the flask was
Now judge
Haters make me nauseous
Blog us, we get it while we prosper
I could see the storm comin' just call me doppler
Radar
Nine months waiting call it labor
Niggas stay sharp call it razor
Niggas better raise up
Or get his face taped up
And no I'm gangsta, its anger
For niggas tryna play me like sega
You faker, thought I was soft cause I had a blazer on
But I am not PM Dawn
I'm a madman on the song bearing arms

Bare witness as I come back
Step up, microphone check up
Back by popular demand once again
X2

I'm the truth when I step in the booth

[Baatin]
Front knees for rilla the subliminal rhyme thriller
Chill a minute with me and my niggas from the villa
Touch of jazz poetical interestingly intriguing
Or even or zooming im better but still human
Changing of plans
And what you thought that I couldn't do man
Metaphoric expressin the lesson eternally blessed
No matter which way that I turn
Threw it in a yearn
It's zealous this irony of what reality tell us
Still could be consumed in the analytical synthesizzle my nizzle
Visible disible from the jizzle
Um
Get you ready for the action with just a syllable
Satisfaction from the rap drawer when you're miserable[Produced by J Dilla]

And get drunk off my dick tonight
I want you to get plastered off of my meatsock tonight
Please blaze my dick like a blunt and
Make me want your cunt
It's all I want
It's all I want, that's all I ever want in my life...

[J Dilla]
You said you lookin for them niggas yeah we be them
Shit reminds me of some old EPM
This year 'bout to blow up like some helium
I usually rock around 92 BPMS
Like BDM, the Lexus what you see me in
Homeboy don't ever step to S.V. again
Shoutout to 5 Ela, ain't no beef with them
Gotta say what's up to HouseShoes and Beej n Dem
Oh, I gotta go it's like, we be on peace, peace, peace
Peace, let's get into flow again
We be them, niggas yeah we be them

[T3]
T3 got the same flow continuin'
Y'all motherfuckers say the 3 don't be freestylin
I got a flow that got these hoes buckwhylin
I got you diggin' and reachin' for your wallet
You want it boy and you know who - got it
You claim original and sound like somebody
Shit I've been rippin shit since I first started
Been challengin niggas and leavin 'em de-parted
I don't wanna but I gotta like build this body
I said this shit goes out to everybody - body - body - body...

(Yeah we be them niggas, yeah we be them)

[Baatin]
Niggas come back to life, yo, I do the usual again
Hoes is givin me blows, cause I'm a sexy man
Niggas is comin with rhymes I ain't feelin
You think you know me boy I used to be a hard villain
Niggas is mad cause they shit ain't genuine
Don't even come my way boy with that cause I'm chillin
Fillin my shit, like Rollo fill up my click nick
Steppin to S'll be your last and, feelin the flow again
We be them niggas, yeah we be them

Yeah we be them niggas, yeah we be them (4X)

You think that'll roll~?
It's gonna have - that's gon' have to roll
Fuck that[Verse 1: T3]
Picture my life as premier cinematic
For the whole world to view critic ever actor
Play the role from drama to action
Of course i got the part my mom did the casting
A story of a boy who made it rapping
But it wasn't sweet it had it's disadvantages
Pop left ,mom drank from the canisters
I tackle this , jotting rhymes a sentences
Mad stubborn plus the kid mad discipline
Like mind individual is who he kicks it with
We start A group we start a click now we been the shit
Mom passed wish she could of saw me benefit
We got hit b.e.t damn 106
Just bought my first whip
I'm feeling good feeling big, the cars and the benefits
I wish my mama could of lived

[Verse 2: Young RJ]
I know i got an angel lookin out 4 me
Im Gods son protected from blasphemy
Decapitate these pharisees mad cuz they can't
Make bangas like these
Yea but this ain't about that/ my range blowin
Up naw this ain't about that
Long nights passin out this ain't about that
After party dont smoke but high off a contact in
Music biz doin biz with the kidz of diablo
Yellow brick road they tryna put potholes
But i still paint pictures like pablo and
Stay relavent outshine yall fossils
Can't stop me dog im still standing tall
Even tho the doctors thought i had cancer naw
How i kept my mind clean and kept repeatin isaiah 54:17
But this ain't about that..

[Verse 3: Focus]
I got things you ain't seen before
I been places you can't even go
Me and my team we earning crazy doe
You see that money out there on the floor
See you ain't knowing who i really am
You can't buy it but i know i can
Is that all you wanna hear from your favorite rap star?
We are told we ain't nothing without our pr
So we just ruff it to we see our
Life slipping away up in the er, dr
Not the homie that found me and put me on
I am talking that grind since you ain't seen since russ and lyor
While in the front of my mind i know the end is near
Revelations has painted the canvas out pretty clear
Motivated by money but undated by fear
I got little to show from the struggle that got me hear, listen
I ain't talking for nothing, trying to save y'all the trouble
And this is not a discussion so i don't need your rebuttal
And now that I'm always sober its easier to settle and get right
Y'all bugging I'm gladly bussing y'all bubble
I ain't apart of y'all team, i refuse to get in y'all huddle
My quarter back is jehovah,I'm running beyond double by faith
Beyond civil the race non hospitable wait
Its not frivolous jibber jabber it critical

[Outro]
All we talk is real
All we live is real
All we see is real
Niggas ain't feeling us then they ain't feeling the real[Hook: T3]
And they say, we carnivores
Savage
Been raised by wolves
No complaints
It made us us
No praise just breaks and hooks
Braveheart
Hustling n*ggas yea we out to stack
Get that money then double it back
Hustling n*ggas yea we out to stack
Get that money then double it
Braveheart

[Verse 1: Young RJ]

Muy...... Grande/cudjo of tha pack
Black suits reservoir dogs shovels in the back
Digga ditch quicker dont let that liquor get u exposed
Or feel that heat nigga 500 on the stove
Dont make me go in beastmode Benicio
Lyrical Wes Craven so official
Can't stop it, its new 2 u so foreign
Seventh Son stay shining/ Jack Torrence
Slice ya spleen like a wolverine flee the scene like
Will Randall walkin with a guillotine scream
If u wanna it just make my adrenaline rush
Ima life editor...predator
Meet the messenger that ain't no metaphor
Leave u needin medical attention lookin pitiful
Beast with the beats on these streets J Incredible
Throw u 2 the dogs let them feast on ya skeletal

[Hook]

[Verse 2.1 :T3]
Mine is loin with a electrical void of appliance half live half dead frankstein science
Dissect it, still don't know what i am, more like spirt of detroit in climate in rhymes
Survived when I dived I was in the great lakes, never drowning I knew how work with my surroundings
Nigga's got to see I'm astounding, I'm a downers , over bullshit walk on type rope and still new balanced do what I do thats challenge nigga's fuck with me on this planet
It ain't all smoke and phone cameras
It all good Its outlandish ,nigga's straight they slanted, these a friends they addicts , this ain't how I feel it , its basic mechanics
Brave hearted,when with the will from the dearly departed,yeah we got it nailed its the pros against the novice,yeah we eating well from the scales against carcass

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Money all kinda ways
Hating niggas looking at the kid sideways
Cause everyday like a friday
So fuck em all what i say
Long as the pies made everything hi grade
Ak arms reach wherever i lay
I'm dat nigga what you trying say
We can make it happen hadle that right away
I ain't trying to let the beef linger none
Get up on you i ain't have to lift a finger son
Show you how to bleed a lung
Send you to the essence see you son
A long kiss goodnight, niggas curios i show you what it look like
What it cook like all day hood life
Niggas money missing homie get ya books right

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Illa J]
You can’t find another nigga that’s braver than me never
Ain’t a nigga hotter than me, even with three sweaters
Get as much nookie as I got as a rookie with these clever
Lines that I spit like darts
So psycho on the microphone now I wake up like
Why did I bite this shark? Rip it apart?
And why did I light this spark in the middle of the day
And why didn’t I wait till dark?
‘Cause I am a beast and I’m on the feast
I came to eat your heart
What the fuck is this
Hannibal Lector, cannibalistic shit that I’m fucking with
Now the microphone so hot I need an oven mitt
Rewind my verse to the top
I know ya loving it
There’s no way that I can stop, I gotta keep it going
Till I feel that I am killing it
And if I’m not I gotta start rewriting it
Go under my hood and start rewiring
And all you loose screws getting fired
And I hope it’s understood we not rehiring
You might as well just go and get a job at Coney Island
While I vacation in IrelandChorus (Dwele):
All that I want is to show you love
All I got to do is find the time
So when can I see you? (I see you love)
I know what you want
I know what you want babe

Verse 1 (T3):
Yeah yeah hit my ring ring call me
I know I'm always busy s-s-sorry and
We don't even see each other much hardly
It never stopped me from girl thinkin bout your body
Swear to God, she's so s-s-s-sexy
Thinkin to myself the lord must've blessed me many times
I wrote many verses girl, many lines about you & me
Us together intertwined
On some s-s-serious shit
Girl you got a nigga st-stuttering
Got me on some long term thinkin other than
On some diamond ring shit
Girl smotherin, we be t-t-talkin on the late nights
Takin trips to see each other on the long flights
Spending tour money on you girl I don't mind
But it's been a minute girl, you been on my mind
C-c-call me

Chorus

Verse 2 (Elzhi):
We brought each other pain, fought without ballin' a fist
Yellin, niggas could hear us through the walls & the bricks
Sayin what we don't mean
Stabbin each other in the heart through the back
And actin like the cuts just don't sting me neither
See the sun but the clouds make it smoky
You was my down chick when others just went down on me
Must've saw something in me to wanna birth my first
You changed my mind about raising a child on a earth that's cursed
Wonder where we went wrong when the thing's so right
When our future looked brighter than casino lights lit on the strip
In the bed you shocked me, bit on your lip
Sex was tighter than a leather outfit on a gimp
Was our feelins supposed to disappear the minute we kept, lost
Started out on a good foot then we eventually stepped off
Or is it just troubles that couples go through?
Mad on the phone can't hang up
But I'm hung up on you
Give me a call

Chorus

Are we in love?
Is it possible to have love within this relationship?
Cause now that I got the time
You should call me tonight
And I'll be alright oohh

Chorus[T3]
Everytime you try to do what you can
To get the ass, it's part of the plan
You settin it up, you buyin her stuff
You do it for the love cause you bucklin up
MacNicholas, Muh-Fuck ready to
The S gin-u-ine, you invision the grind
She's already wit it, you just wanna dine
See now I'm going for mine
Plus to tell the truth y'all
It's been a long time, this chick got me settin up the abbeyance
If you ask me, yo it's time to get down
I turn up the music, get some bass in my sound
Quick dash to the bathroom cologne me down
Now, it's time to relax
Back on the scene that's, MackNicholas mack
Tell her the place to be is the place where she's at
She's feelin relaxed, my hands on her
I'm feelin up this chick I'm feelin up her flap jacks
Got a page from her girl said let me call Sha ne' back
Sha' ne said, "I had to leave the kids back at the flat girl"
So she just pull up the, had to go and thats wack

You shouldn't'a gave me a huh
In the first place
You should have put up the guard, since the first date
I know that it's hard, but it's not the worst case
I told you straight from the starts
That I was thirst-ay
For more than just one or two
Shit, two or three, can do
Much more than just one could do
Listen, it's good for ya health
Cause you know I ain't the one to
Repeat myself (5x) .......
Yo yo why you playa hatin?
I knew it was a reason for the separation
Girl said you told her that I was a super
See I ain't even know, that you could stoop so low
What the fuck you over here fo'
What, the girl she in the room what, there's the door
I'll tell her that you came and that you said hello
What up

I wonder what happened to my nigga, cock block
I hate to see ya young ack, be put up in a box
He became a dread cause he had a lock
On the flock in the place all on my jock
Cause I had grace
Told Cock Block he could hop many women
Upon them never ever release your semen
Upon them is a materialized demon
Illustrious, succubus, do not trust
She see you when you coming
She know you wanna bust
Now she got you sippin on the clitorus, juice
Some of them juices is poisonous, juice
Shoulda took notes, when the master spoke
Places in the pussy, you can provoke
You got what you want
Your soul is ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost

You ain't gotta play hard to get
I know you, I know you like the art of sex
I'm putting down my plan like a architect
It's for you, and her, we can all get wet
I got alot of nerve talking this to you right
I'm straight up, and this should make sense to you
Girl you ain't gotta front don't be acting dumb
And if you got the goods, then I want some
I'm tryna get down this ain't no la di da
But I ain't never fucked with a menage a trois
It's three like the stripes on the a-di-das
Getting live like we at the mardi gras
We getting live like we at the mardi gras
Three is the magic number ask my part-i-ner
I be serving that ass like a bar-ten-der
I'm only too bold to be watching ya
I'm only too bold to be watching ya

[Hook]
I want you right here in the world
Being with you all alone
It's like a dream's come true

[T3]
See these things get sold
I'm caught up in ya game I'm kinda tango
Maybe it's the way you sed---huuuu on the down-low
Saying things to me that one and 3 would only know
I wanna tell you though that these things seem to mean
Situations keep you from point A to B
I certainly put a counsel on our mistakes
I got a mission on two girls on a hot beach
Everythings a reach and ain't nobody stoppin' me
It just relax me cause they know I gotta plan for each
Hhhhyeah every body know I gotta plan for each
You know I, you know I gotta plan for each

[Hook]

[Baatin]
Thought you knew Baatin was polygamist
Which one of you queens is coming to get with this
Already got one holdin' my arm in this
But I need a couple to add to my list
Take a position in my world of compassion
Satisfaction, ecstasy
Calling you calling me
I know you yearning for sexual longevity
My name is Baatin Rasul Rasii
Tantric master, sex, two or three
Ecstacy, calling you calling me
I know your hubby ain't giving you no action
Well for one he's too damn masculine
He need to relax, and take some lessons on givin' you climax
All alone, it's like a dream's come true

[Hook x3][Hook: Dwele]
There's something I wanted to know, can we get closer
Yeah baby, seems like I've waited so long, can we get closer

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Girl you should come up for the week
I'll make you cum from the tub to the sink
Rubbing your feet in a luxury suite
Make sure you come with nothing on just a long shearling
And I'mma make ya toes curl up like they all earlin'
I'll whisper in your ear, tell ya something
Stick my tongue in your bellybutton
Reach down below, you know I'm well sprung
Hit ya from the back to get ya calves trembling
And pull your hair 'til its straight, you look half Indian
Laugh and giggling
With champagne bubbles tickle your nose
Before you I wouldn't throw my old nickels at hoes
I'm just glad we can get close, for breakfast in the morning
We can fly out to Paris, France for the French toast
You made me wait so long and that's a good thing
Now let me make your candy rain dampen your thong
I hit it off like a champion strong, for real
Your still bumpin' and grindin' even after the song but all along I, I

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T3]
Let me talk to ya, feel me for a sec
I love ya sassy ways I must confess
You're lookin' good girl, I hope you into sex
Sort of a model type with a splash of innocence
Your fashion (fash-shon), ass like your moms
I love that Tiffany charm thats hangin' from ya arm
And if we get it on I'mma take her back to the fort
Show her how I run game like an athlete in sport
Sweety I can see that money ain't a thing
Been doin' this for a while no need to explain it
You're doing swell girl, you're never doin poorly
You know I'm hoppin' in whips just look at the jewerly
Plus you need a man in your life
Yo someone who can hit it right, and plus got the right dough
Plus I'll treat you like a queen
Your place or mine I was thinking we should get close

[Hook]

[Dwele]
A lot of cats done tried it
I like to touch the na na, I
Know you act real shy but, know you get down
You're not that type we go
Just keep it low and let it go
No need to act up cause I, know you get down
Can we get closer tonight, I'll make it right
Touch you inside baby, I make you get down
Hold you very close, with or without clothes
Public or closed doors, we will get closer[Intro]
Where we come from is a place we call Conant Gardens
(Motown) We getting shit started
If you every hear us say McNic, Nic

[Jay Dee]
It's going down like that range rover
When ladies see you they catch the love hang over
Day or a night if you wanna stay over
You better have the will to bend over and take..

[Baatin]
Off your clothes in time
Conqueror, come back to give some of that old
Pictual, actual, factual; Let Mac'll bring you the raw
With gigantic loads that my people come to love

[T3]
Azurite, get down with it
Can't fathom these brothers fantastic
Uh, I heard you cry when I dipped that ass in some plastic
How could you master, you deal with rappin' bastards
Because you asked us if we could bring you fashions
Fascists, because we turn this rap shit into something tragic
I didn't wanna have to put you in some action
Uh, I know you asked but did you really wanna have it?
See, I cause havoc like a loaded automatic..

[Jay Dee]
How do you like me now nigga, you know my style say word
I'm from the city where we're known for slangin' pounds of herb
Getting dough is a must, and it's the money making its
Yo, the never faking its creating shit that's taking your ho
After the show you know I step up in the place..

[Baatin]
...when I step up in the place
Mind is not strong enough, to hold me back
The tools you lack, the skills you deal
Lyrics to kill, cars to deal
Cops to peel, image too real!

[All]
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it..
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come, on..
Do it, do it , do it, come on, come on, do it do it..

[Jay Dee]
Back again from the bank baby, counting my change
Chains for most of these cats probably cop my rings
Quick, fast, and always got a way to get cash
Whiplash is what you get when you mashing the gas
If you ask, you might catch me..

[T3]
...You might catch me in my rental
Won't catch me in tinted windows
Might catch me on residentals
Or various instrumentals and yo..
Got a whole crew and my crew is monumental and yo..
You need to lo and behold these innuendos

[Baatin]
Its just the fine talk
Mac'll come with tracks, you relaxe-d
My rhyme is universal like a elastic-uh
I hope you feel me like you feel your past-or

[Jay Dee]
...What do you ???
And you so used to bab-bl-ing
See it dont matter cause we mas-tered this rap shit
Pockets get madder cause its hitting so imma-culate
You like the way it goes down when S attacks-it
It will get tragic when the S is on the mission..

[T3]
...The S is on a mission again
So listen, relax take a seat in the place
It's living, living up to expectations and still
Ripping, With rhymes and filling the chrome
Dipping, Cruising the neighborhood is just local
Pimping

[Baatin]
As for my memory, we were meant to be
I am the soul Melchizedek, from the D
Role of the world, ever see, who got the Key
Its gonna take a master, yo, yo, the S, S

[All]
Where we come from is a place we call Conant Gardens
Motown, we getting shit started
We don't stop, nahh we don't quit..
We just do it, do it, do it, do it do it
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Yo, yo, yo..

Don't pack nothin but bathin suits and shorts hon'
And thats for real girl
And then step two
When you land off the plane up in Malibu
Limo, chauffer service awaits you
Champagne open and the sunroof too
Black Leather interior trimmed in powder blue
We roll out then we shift to step three
Hotel accomodation is lovely
There's no way they hand us the wrong key
Top floor you know the penthouse suite

Theres 3 beds, 2 baths, 1 jacuzzi
You got a wardrobe sittin in ya dresser draw
Thats when el steps in to setup step four

And mama send this bad truck through the 3 tvs
The waters runnin for your bath now we at step five

Dryin you off and let you get inside your neglige
Pour some wine like the dro and let the record play
Dwele g track 10 thats my favourite edge
You blazin with me we laughin and on our way to six
Stick my tongue in ya ear and set the mood right
Hit the balcony and grind you in the moonlight
You horny off the gentle breeze before we're off of six
Dab some wine on ya nipples and lick it of your tits
Now we enterin seven and you just can't wait

Take you to another place, lay you on ya back
Ya body's tremblin girl you feelin so right
Repeated actions turn the moonlight into daylight
We watch the sunrise onto step nine
Breakfast in bed with cherries and some chilled wine
With the windows cracked open feel a slight wind
I take my time as we ease into step ten

[Elzhi]

Believe when my only reasons for this hon'is pleasin
Stickin my keys in your ignition
Ya screamen eleven semen like big fun
We even we both skiin and just cum
Ya screamin and I semen and we get done
We leavin the next evenin events come
You ? and we head to sweden you can get some
We leavin at 12 to bring you back to just one

[Dwele]

Theres many ways to touch ya

Let me count the ways to fuck you
You're all I want girl

Theres many ways to touch ya

Theres many ways to touch ya

Let me count the ways to fuck you
You're all I want girl (fade out)Oh...yeah...yeah (oh)...uh

[Hook]
S Villa, nigga, that's the crew when you rep' (Who?)
It's been a long time, we shouldn'ta left you (You!)
It's the S (move!), crushin' your best dude (dude)
Spitin darts so nigga bring your vest too
Villa nigga, That's the crew when you rep' (Who?)
It's been a long time, we shouldn'ta left you
It's the S move, crushin' your best dude
Spitin darts so nigga bring your vest too

[Verse 1: T3]
(Guess who) just stepped in the basement with Pete?
Quick, swift with the flow boy S to the V
Hear the static in the records, the dust in the beat
Grimy like the ghettos when it's pitch black in the streets
Red alert nigga better beware, bring the heat
Soul Suvivor comin' through so it's hasta la vie
V.I.P. dog watch us just take it to the top
Plus we so Detroit like Murphy was in Robocop
Say we can't do a thing and man we ain't 'sposed
But I'm quick to return like I'm breakfast with the toast
Villa in the spot tryn'a gain and maintain, yeah (oh)
Tryna erase you lames, most slept in the game

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Yeah yeah
Sharp, retaliate your fleet with animal instinct
Walk with alligator feet, talk like Keith through alleyway and street
Avenue crime scene locked in my rhyme scheme
When plottin to blow, like watchin' a disappearing *bomb string*
On Bin-Laden; I'm a vocal assassin, my throat is a handgun
When you think I'm chokin', I'm in motion to land one
And get you open - basically sick, facin' me, nah
Your bones'll get thrown through a masonry wall
Without me breakin' the bricks
Wit wallow in my venom
Split nozzle from a kit combo Get bravo from the womens
Lift pothole, admit defeat and forget it
I'm well known to speak in heat of a minute
Like I'm linked to a cell phone, reachin' the limit
Meet yo untimely demise, I
Flow with the entire glow of a diamond insides
Let the fire blows from the cannon, I can win and I will
At random I peel steel like a mechanic that builds
And strip away, nibble on simple prey
Simple minded, whistle silent when I ripple my mental rage
Trip'll ride and then flee from the scene paid (hey)
I'm on your head like a wooden contraption
Collapsin' the guillotine blade
'Til your eyes is bigger than DMC's shades
Not the low B grades, we 4.0 with the flow
You see A's

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T3/Elzhi]
[T3] Speak ghetto language for niggas to hold
Tarnish bubble-gum raps when I switch and turn gold
See the plaques on the wall but we platinum status
One verse is like a gauge and blow a nigga off the atlas
Man listen, I'll break them bad habits
For the pursuit of the green I gots to get the cabbage (yup!)
Me and my dudes, my man, we all savage
Can't reach the status quota your team, they all average
[Elzhi] Comin' outta the dark, I undoubtedly spark ironically
My sane mind sharp as James Bond part for Sean Connery
Your rhyme odyssey, possess a treacherous style
Bet you would bow if my nine possibly
Shot your knee on the left
Cuff gat, criminal act, tough rap, bust back
Like genital sacks that's gushin with something that resemble the Claps
You dealin' with a multiple *manic-depressin'
Instillin' panic and stress on all o' you

[Hook][Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo this O.D.B. and Slum Village
Detriot wild out! You know how we do

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Girl, if you're flexible, intellectual
Bisexual, can I get next to you
If you're flexible than, we can keep it dirty and sexual
If your man front, than we gotta knock the nigga out
Smack the nigga up, stomp the nigga out, clap clap the nigga up

[T3]
She got a man, but her man ain't me
I'm a, M-A-C, to P-I-M-P
I'mma, show her things, and spend a little cheese, baby
Cuz your man ain't doing the right thing lately
Yup, so I'm steppin in his house
If the nigga step up I'mma knock the nigga out
So I'm here with a beer and a glove
With some thugs and some chicks with some derry' ass
She got a man, it ain't fair, I don't care
I ain't scared with my dudes and I come prepared
Ladies, lemme see what you workin with
Make a nigga stay at home like a punishment
I'm trying, to think of us, think of we girl
Think about us, and some, and T3

[Hook]

[Elzhi]
Yeah, you know how Slum do, when we come through
Gum shoe, Air Force is a pair of Air Jordan's
Pelle Pel, are old school with gangsta white walls
Tailor suits, coordinatin' with the gator boots
Before you hate on what we do, it's a D thang
You flamin' at a Cappa/Rae offa Alize
Where the ladies at, pushin' back you Baby Phat
Make it clap like eight gats
Stayin' at the Infenium, just use the key
You got a man, but what your man gotta do with me
He don't want it, nah, he don't know the nigga
Roll with Dreadknaughtz, Cardi Boys, AML, Fat Killahz
Raw C, D12, but don't mind that
And we should hit the telly up, I got the Remy and the dime bag

[Hook]

[Hook 4X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Keep it dirty nuh

[T3]
What, they don't wanna fuck with us
They don't wanna feel the pain and get bruised and touched
She was down with your team, now she roll with us
Brought he girlfriend with her and its all a plus
She wanna do what the players do, play how the players play
And she don't like how you treated her anyway

[Elhzi]
Yeah, you said you love, but is it really real
Would you break me off first, and let my nigga Phil hit you
Picture my Caddy truck, we sexin' in the backseat
Or in my room, you bucky naked in my black mink
Girl, it's either 'this or that', like it's Black Sheep
I know it's on, if you twistin' back my Pistons cap
Ignore the phone, if it's your man, let the machine get it
Matter fact, turn off the ringer, and let me lean in it

[Hook 3X]

[Hook]

[Outro: Ol Dirty Bastard]
From Detroit all the way to New York, we comes down(T3)

No time to conversate get funky like the bass
Get down to the sound cuz the Slum is on the tr-ace
Don't worry about the sound cuz the Slum is on the c-ase

Elzhi drop a verse to make 'em disco come on

(Verse 2: Elzhi)
Don't sell yourself to "Fall In Love"
You're in "Climax" cuz after it's done then "Go Ladies"
I mean what's up with all the "Jealousy"
You knew that it was you, her and me
You tryna "CB4" you better "Raise It Up"
Out of my crib take a cab
Cuz "Conant Gardens" is where they flatten your wig
This for a certain chick whose name remains "Untitled"
This is "2U4U" and by you
Got sick and tired of going "Forth And Back"
Arguing about my paper stack, told you to "Hold Tight"
But you always tryna "Get Dis Money"
Asked you where my dough, you said "I Don't Know"
I thought the sex was "Fantastic"
It's the "Thelonious" when I'm boning chicks
Against the mattress
Girl "Tell Me" if you want something you can just
Make plump and if so then keep your "Eyes Up"
Now we buckwilding "What's that All About"
"Once Upon A Time" you was down now we falling out
Sweetheart we the "Players"
You wouldn't understand if you bought Volume 2 from the bootleggers

(Chorus: T3)
What you want Disco
We got it for you
Up up in the club we make 'em disco (Yeah)
On the street corners make 'em disco come on (Yeah)
What you need Disco
We got more for you
We got the soul to make you disco
SV will drop the funk to make you disco come on
What you want Disco
We got it for you
We'll make you disco
Pretty ass women wanna disco
What you need Disco
We got more for you
We got the funk to make you disco
You wanna disco come on[Produced by J Dilla]

I remember the day that you showed your ass
Full moonin, wolf nigga transformin
Burnin rubber, that get you nowhere fast
You doin stupid shit so that these whores can swarm in

See when Baatin say he got yo' back, you better trust
You know you fucked up, tellin rumors on my crew
But fuck the dumb, you gotta estimate
Before you tell a lie on the 7-88, 88

You told my man to come and get it
And when he did it, you fronted on his ass when you did it
You won't admit it, yet you know you bullshitted
Yet you walk around town like your shit is sweet scented

And in a minute, niggas intend us to get in it
I recommend this, estimate it
Don't false advertise us no need for pretendin
To be someone you're not when you can't hide your feelings

YOUR TRUE FEELINGS~! Cause you can't hide your true feelings
I get the feeling, you got devious intentions
Actin like a Willie when you're just a Sir William
Cause you're hollow on the inside cause you got no feelings

You gotta estimate yo' fate yes you in touch
You wanna be down, but your crew is all in it
My city's Motown, my crew is Slum Village
Macknickalous niggas don't give a fuck about image
We bustin jams on the ceiling

We is the, hey it's the, we is the
Hey it's the, ahhh-ahhhhhh

Don't put your bitch out there like that
If you don't want her out there like that

Don't put your bitch out there like that
If you don't want her out there like that

Don't put your bitch out there like that
If you don't want her out there like that

Don't put your bitch...Fake niggas, talkin shit about me and my click

Be hittin like Bam Bam, in Bed Rock

So when my band rocks, watch the bands flop
You say (h-huh) my jam knocks

The soul shot known to make 'em shell shocked
When devinous cats used to pop locks

Chorus[Hook]
To fall in love
With the things you do
Don't sell yourself
To fall in love
With those things you do

[Verse 1: Baatin]
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep
I'm the motherfucker gripping the mic like it's a joke
Niggas fall in love with the music like its a ho
Put down your mic you lost your whole flow
You take it too seriously like it's a gamble
Fuck this rap shit I listen to classical
In the studio loop as usual
Loving my lyrical
Fuck bitches that you would know
I'm out of this cause you wanna be below
Y'all niggas in love with the S
Y'all niggas in love with the S

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T3]
Yeah, JD man I see sometimes
I sit and wonder when I think about these written rhymes
How'd I get to the point constantly taking all my time?
Time I could of been spending gettin' cash, gettin' mine
Hoping one day it comes around
One day when I'm
The nigga gettin' money, gettin' cash, gettin' signed
Getting the fuck out the ghetto, cause I'm tired of crime
But it's a crime that I feel this fucking way sometimes
But sometimes I feel like this shit here's a waste of time
Yours and mine
To these niggas out here trying to rhyme
Your reason for it better sure 'nough be genuine
I do it because it gives me a sort of peace-of-mind
And for the love

[Hook]

Yo, one-two
Word up, ah one-two, SV, word up, word up, alright

Yo, uh, oh this going out to my nigga Bust-a

Trying to get down with us, cause we know you just mad as hell
Yo I'll give em the mic, ehhh! So niggas don't know that I am
