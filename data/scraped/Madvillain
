[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Living off borrowed time, the clock tick faster
That'd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
Dick Dastardly and Muttley with sick laughter
A gun fight and they come to cut the mixmaster
I-C-E cold, nice to be old
Y2G stee twice to threefold
He sold scrolls, lo and behold
Know who's the illest ever like the greatest story told
Keep your glory, gold and glitter
For half, half of his niggas'll take him out the picture
The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta
Villain: a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare
When he have the mic, it's like the place get like: "Aw yeah!"
It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
Just keep ya eye out, like "Aye, aye captain"
Is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody ain't hear it
And can they testify from in the spirit
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got "Ooh Lords"
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
Or even one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it
It's like the end to the means
Fucked type of message that sends to the fiends
That's why he brings his own needles
And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
Slip like Freudian
Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion

[Outro]
When he had the mic you don't go next
Leaving pussy cats like why hoes need Kotex
Exercise index, won't need Bowflex
And won't take the one with no skinny legs like Joe TexThe rest is empty with no brain but the clever nerd
The best emcee with no chain ya ever heard
Take it from the Tec-9 holder
They've bit but don't know their neck shine from Shinola
Everything that glitters ain't fishscale
Lemme think, don't let her faint get Ishmael
A shot of Jack got her back it's not an act stack
Forgot about the cackalack, holla back, clack clack blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra chart toppa
Start shit stoppa be a smart shoppa
Shot a cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go
'Bout to jet, get him, not a bet, dead 'em
Let 'em spit the venom said 'em got a lot of shit with 'em
Let the rhythm hit 'em, it's stronger in the other voice
We makes the joints that make 'em spread 'em butta moist
Man, please, the stage is made of panties
From the age of baby hoochies on to the grannies
Ban me the dough rake, daddy
The flow make her fatty shake, patty cake, patty cake
For fake, if he was Anita Baker's man
He'd take her for her masters, hit it once an' shake her hand
On some ol' thank ya ma'am an' ghost her
She could mind the toaster if she sign the poster
A whole host of roller coaster riders
Not enough tracks (is it?)
Hot enuff black (for ya)
It's too hot to handle, you got blue sandals
Who shot ya? Ooh got you new spots to vandal?
Do not stand still, both show skills
Close but no krills, toast for po' nils, post no bills
Coast to coast Joe Shmoe's flows ill, go chill
Not supposed to overdose No-Doz pills
Off pride tykes talk wide through scar meat
Off sides like how Worf rides with Starfleet
Told ya, on some get-rich shit
As he get older he gets colder than a witch tit
This is it, make no mistakes
Where my nigga go?
Figaro, Figaro

O's beats and my rhymes attack
A scary act
All black like Ms. Mary Mack
Wait 'til you see 'em live on the piano
DOOM sings soprano like "una duociano" (singing voice)
My momma told me
Blast him and pass her her glass of Ol' E
Not to be troublesome
But I could sure use a quick shot of double rum
No stick of bubble gum
I like ice cream
We could skip the weddin'
Have a nice dream
She only let him stick the head in[Verse]
So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
Daily told the people "You can call me Your Majesty!"
Keep your battery charged
You know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter
Peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (Your mother)
Don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try
Villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you
It's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

[Outro]
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop!* like snot bubbles[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Tripping off the beat kinda, dripping off the meat grinder
Heat niner, pimping, stripping, soft sweet minor
China was a neat signer, trouble with the script
Digits double dipped, bubble lipped, subtle lisp midget
Borderline schizo, sort of fine tits though
Pour the wine, whore to grind, quarter to nine, let's go
Ever since ten eleven, glad she made a brethren
Then it's last down, seven alligator seven, at the gates of heaven
Knocking, no answer, slow dancer, hopeless romancer, dopest flow stanzas
Yes, no? Villain, Metal face to Destro
Guess so, still incredible in escrow
Just say Ho! I'll test the yayo
Wild West style fest, y'all best to lay low
Hey bro, Day Glo, set the bet, pay dough
Before the cheddar get away, best to get Maaco
The worst hated God who perpetrated odd favors
Demonstrated in the perforated Rod Lavers
... In all quad flavors, Lord save us
Still back in the game like Jack LaLanne
Think you know the name, don't rack your brain
On a fast track to half sane
Either in a slow beat or that the speed of "Wrath of Kane"
Laughter, pain
"Hackthoo'ing" songs lit, in the booth, with the best host
Doing bong hits, on the roof, in the west coast
He's at it again
Mad at the pen
Glad that we win, a tad fat, in a bad hat for men
Grind the cinnamon, Manhattan warmongers
You can find the villain in satin, congas
The van screeches
The old man preaches
About the gold sand beaches
The cold hand reaches
For the old tan Ellesse's
... Jesus[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1: Viktor Vaughn]
I knew you was fucking around
Playing all innocent and hoeing since the foundation
Don't make me have to pound his tin crown face in
And risk being jammed up like traffic inbound from spacing
There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put all my chips on the worst bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off and ended it and dip
And if you spoke soft we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw, no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power...

[Verse 2: Viktor Vaughn]
Probably kissed me later that evening, I should be hurling
Matter of fact, gimme back my bracelet and my Shearling
I rather waste it or give it to your girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was workin'
Remember our vacation out to Maryland
I dooked the maid Carolyn, she made me throw the towel in
Like all foul men the time I hit your moms off
I told her knock it off but she had to set the rocket off
Ain't enough room in this fucking town
When you see tin head tell him be ducking down
I'm not romping around
He better be ready and prepared to be stomped in the ground[Produced by Madlib]

[MF DOOM]
Hold the cold one like he hold a old gun
Like he hold the microphone and stole the show for fun
Or a foe for ransom, flows is handsome
O's in tandem, anthem, random, tantrum
Phantom of the Grand Ole Opry ask the dumb hottie
Masked pump shotty, somebody stop me
Hardly come sloppy on a retarded hard copy
After rockin' parties he departed in a jalopy
Watch the droptop papi
Known as the grimey, limey, slimy, try me, blimey
Simply smashing in a fashion that's timely
Madvillain dashing in a beat-rhyme crime spree
We rock the house like rock 'n roll
Got more soul than a sock with a hole
Set the stage with a goal
To have the game locked in a cage getting shocked with a pole
Overthrow like throwing rover a biscuit
A lot of bitches think he's overly chauvinistic
Let go his dick if that's the case
Rats, what a waste there's more cats to chase
Dogs, he got it like new powers
Woke up, wrote and spit the shit in a few hours
Sheesh! Been unleashed since the glee club
Had your fam saying please make me a dub
Well, since you ask kindly
Where he been behind the mask, who can't find me?
You're blind
In the wine zone leave ya mind blown
When he shine with the 9, he's a rhinestone... cowboy

[MF DOOM]
No no no no enough

[Verse 2 - MF DOOM]
Goony goo goo loony cuckoo like Gary Gnu off New Zoo Revue
But who knew the mask had a loose screw?
Hell, could hardly tell
Had to tighten it up like the Drells and Archie Bell
It speaks well of the hyper base
Wasn't even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace
Couldn't wait for the snipes to place
At least a track list in bold print typeface
Stopped for a year
Come back with thumb tacks, pop full of beer
We're hip hop sharecroppers
Used to wear flip flops, now rare gear coppers
He's in this for the quiche
You might as well not ask him for no free shit, capiche?
Oh, my aching hands
From raking in grands and breaking in mic stands
Villain—his smile stuns ya chick
While he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks
You heard it on the radio, tape it
Play it in your stereo, your crew'll go apeshit
Raw lyrics—he smells 'em like a hunch
The same intuition that tells him "spike the punch"
Curses, we's truly the worsest
With enough rhymes to spread throughout the boundless universes
Let the beat blast, she told him wear the mask
He said you bet your sweet ass
It's made of fine chrome alloy
Find him on the grind, he's the rhinestone cowboy[Produced by Madlib]

Two two one-two

[MF DOOM]
How DOOM hold heat, and preach non-violence?
Shhh, he about to start the speech, c'mon, silence
On one starry night, I saw the light
Heard a voice that sound like Barry White, said "Sho you right"
Don't let me find out who tried to bite
They better off goin' to fly a kite in a firefight
During tornado time with no coat than I caught ya
Wrote the book on rhymes, a note from the author
With no headshot, he said it's been a while
Got a breadwinner style to get a inner child to finna smile
And that's no exaggeration
The doctor told a patient "It's all in your imagination negro"
Ahh, what do he know?
About the buttery flow, he need to cut the ego
Trippin', to date the Metal Fellow been rippin' flows
Since New York plates was ghetto yellow with broke blue writing
This is too exciting
Folks leave out the show feelin' truly enlightened
They say "The Villain been spitting enough lightning
To rock shock the Boogie Down to Brighton," alright, then

[Bridge: M.E.D.]
Yeah, check, it's enough
Uh, yeah, now

[M.E.D.]
How M.E.D. hold heat like Clint East is reborn?
Leave you with more holes than a dartboard
Haters watch him, Hennessy double shot drink
Like the answer to the problem's at the bottle's bottom
Uhh, from the bottom, top that homey, pay how you owe me
My niggas take no like Kobe
Even with the the arms of the Hulk, you couldn't hold me
From gettin mines, stogies be rolled, smokin and gettin by
Thanks to rap I ain't got a dime
Got me sneakin out of checkout lines with bottles by the waistside
Yeah, smack 'em in the face, let 'em taste pride
Face trial, end up washed up like the shorelines
Do or die ride, how the dead return
Street turns, keep me in this dirt, like an earthworm
What he spit hits and grows, will brothers ever learn
Worth a word, chat with a nerd, meeting adjourned[Produced by Madlib]

In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop!* like snot bubbles[Intro]
Come out to show them
Like, open the bruise up and let some of the bruise blood come out to show them
Come out to show them, come out to show them, come out to show them {*storm howls*}
Come out to show them, come out to show them, come out to show them... {*echoes*}
{*guitar sound, coughing fit*} Music (bad weed)
Listening to music while stoned is a whole new world (to' up man)
Most cannabis consumers report it second only to sex
And grass will change your musical habits, for the better

{*scratched: "America's most blunted!"*}
{"Soon as he start sleepin, catchin you off guard"}
{"If you'll all gather closer at the phonograph"}
Where Quas at? {"Yo!"} Doom, you got the trees?
{"America's most blunted!"}

[Verse 1: MF Doom]
Quas, when he really hit star mode
Never will he boost loose Phillies with the barcode
Or take a whole carload on a wasted trip
Or slit White Owl laced tip from tip with yip
Some rather baggies others like their cracks in vials
Catch a tag, roll a bag of schwag in a Black'n'Mild
He twist Optimo, just the raw leaf part
The list top go: bust before beef start
At the Stop'n'Go Mart, actin like a spirit host done it
{"America's most blunted!"} Yeah, yo
DOOM nominated for the best rolled L's
And they wondered how he dealt with stress so well
Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
Some say buddha'd, some say faded
Someday pray that he will grow a farm barn full
Recent research show it's not so darn harmful (true)
Sometimes you might need to detox
It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beatbox
Off spite to your surprise
Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes
Tear a page out the good book, hear it how you want it
{"America's most blunted!"}

[Hook]
{"Comin kinda stupid from the station"} {"blunted"}
{"Amazing loops, loops, loops.."} {"blunted"}
{*"The-th-the-best, the-th-best, the-the-the, the best in your perimeter"*}
Yo I can't find that nigga Metal Face nowhere (oh alright)
{"America's most blunted!"}

[Verse 2: Lord Quas]
Doom! The Madvillain killin mad boom
Consume weed and drink brew 'til we perfume the room
The beat conductor smoke twenty-four/seven
Shady.. you can even ask my reverend
Willie knows, how the Phillies roll, really though
I spend my last dough, to pick up the sticky gold
I spark the lah, but don't {fuck} with speed or trees with seeds
Quasimoto crew, we get keyed
The most blunted on the map
The one astro black, in the alley, with a hoodrat
Hoodrat.. when you try to react
{*belch*} Even your pops got smack
Even your moms got crack
Meanwhile!! While my bowl got packed
(Do you?) Drop X so you can have good sex (What, no)
I smoke dank so I can grow me a shank
I got the fat sack {shh} all day I'm on it
Who are we? {"America's most blunted!"}

[Outro]
{"Comin kinda stupid from the station"} {"blunted"}
{"Amazing loops, loops, loops.."} {"blunted"}
{"America's most blunted!"}
Creativity, it's a known fact that grass increases creativity
From eight, to eleven times. In fact, everyone finds that they're
More creative stoned, than straight. So remember!
M-A-R-I-J-U... {*xylophone*} ... A-J-U-A-N-A {*xylophone*}
Mari-ah.. {*xylo*} ..juana {*xylo*} Mari-whana {*xylo*}
{*laughter*}I'd like to start off by thanking our sponsor
For financing the parts for this Frankenstein monster
Along with my partner who's a bro of few words
We did this research for true nerds and two birds
Piano
Do a show, same time watch it
And guaranteed to give em more than just hock spit
MC extraordinaire, technique sort of rare
Caught a glare, sure to scare, next week more to share
From the most retardedest artists this year and forever
Villain 'nem, ya mean big brothers love ya
Definitely felonies, telling me
Treacherously MC, yelling B, set em free
Let me see, that strategy's misleading
Gs all in the freezer with the batteries and Z-Rims
He him stalked the concrete with bunion
And won't hurt corns when it's on like the stun gun
*tsssst*
Not so shocking
Funyun faced rappers eat rocks, over beatboxin'
Debunk punks with a stock flow
And make them funky fresh with no socks for hocko
Madvillain been as high as Kathmandu
And tilted to the side like that fat man's shoe
Look, not to give them mix signal
The rap game got more toys than Kris Kringle
And he's fake, his ears are not deceiving
I can't believe my eyeballs no more than "Steveland"
No "Wonder", OMFG
Snuck him like an unexpected blow from a lefty
Caught me, almost shot her eye out
Felt good though, even with the cotton dry mouth
Time out
Okay, time back in
Never seen a living human being with black skin
What's crackin? Besides smoking trees and wheezing
For no reason working like a broken tetrahedron
He get paid and get even
Building
Still get mad when it's time to get (???)
They thought the Don had gone silent
And since deep in the﻿ studies he's accepted non-violence
Don't make him have to skip some classes
And open up an old can of whoop-ass with the fastness
Cut the rolling melatonin put a little more in
Strip club full of whores and grown men snoring
Keep the block sewed like Thread and Bobbin Bonus
And make sure the seeds know they'll never ever own this
Beat a dead pony and sell the corpse for glue
Get a portion off the proceeds for the shoe
No need to bleed if there’s no pig to do
Flew a fly flow with the speed of Mr. Magoo
Blew a wad on a platinum card debit
Come back broke as hell ask the god for credit
Dead it
The mask is like a hand crafted ghillie suit
Only if the ladies could see him they’d say it’s really cute
Hmm
Thanks in advance
Don’t try to be cool now had ya chance
Avalanche
Rappers is Bagger Vance acting
Who need to fix they pants or get smacked by the Mac 10
Or 11, or both
Find Jesus, see the reverend take the oath
He moves his huge hands in the dark like fate
Waitin' for the date to drop the tape like bait[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the debut grand opening
Of Madvillain Bistro Bed and Breakfast Bar and Grill
Cafe lounge on the water

Where we offer you the finest of the finer things
Twenty four hours a day, seven days a week
Three hundred and sixty five days a year

Live on the beats, we have the one and only Madlib
We also have King Geedorah on the mix
Yesterday's New Quintet's here, Viktor Vaughn, Quasimoto
And I'm your host, 'The Supervillain'

Just lay back and have a good time
Enjoy the music, you know what I'm sayin'
I'd like to dedicate this next joint to my mans, you know
Big Hookie and Baba from the laundromat[Verse]
Villain get the money like curls
They just tryin' to get a nut like squirrels in his mad world
Land of milk and honey with the swirls
Where reckless naked girls get necklaces of pearls
Compliments of the town jeweler
Left back now-schooler tryin' to sound cooler
On the microphone known as the crown ruler
Never lied to ma when we said we found the moolah
Five-hundred somethin' dollars layin' right there in the street
Huh, now let's try and get somethin' to eat
Then he turned four and started flowin' to the poor
That's about when he first started going raw
Kept the 'dro in the drawer
A rhymin' klepto who couldn't go up in the store no more
His life is like a folklore legend
Why you so stiff, you need to smoke more, bredrin
Insted of trying to riff with the broke war veteran
Spliff made him swore he saw heaven he was seven
Yup, you know it, growin' up too fast
Showin' up to class with Moet in a flask
He ask the teacher if he leave will he pass
His girl is home alone he tryin' to get the
If you want to sip get a paper water fountain glass
How I'm 'posed to know where your mouth been last
Hands so fast he can out-spin the Flash
Known to smoke a whole mountain of hash to the ash
Boom-bash leave the room with the stash
Assume it's in a smash, Doom get the cash[Stacy Epps]
Give me a little bit, a little bit
Just a little bit, or a lot

Pieces of the dream that I pick up in my mind
Is not blind, of our love
Every day when I look into your brown eyes
I get high, on our love
(x2)

I, I get high, look in your, brown eyes
I get high-iiiiiiii-iiiiiii-iiiiiigh
Higher, higher, hi-igher, -igher
-igher, -i-igher, higher, you make me higher
I fly (I fly) I fly (I fly)
I fly (I fly) up high
I fly - take me there, I fly - take me there
I fly[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1: Viktor Vaughn]
I knew you was fucking around
Playing all innocent and hoeing since the foundation
Don't make me have to pound his tin crown face in
And risk being jammed up like traffic inbound from spacing
There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put all my chips on the worst bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off and ended it and dip
And if you spoke soft we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw, no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power...

[Verse 2: Viktor Vaughn]
Probably kissed me later that evening, I should be hurling
Matter of fact, gimme back my bracelet and my Shearling
I rather waste it or give it to your girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was workin'
Remember our vacation out to Maryland
I dooked the maid Carolyn, she made me throw the towel in
Like all foul men the time I hit your moms off
I told her knock it off but she had to set the rocket off
Ain't enough room in this fucking town
When you see tin head tell him be ducking down
I'm not romping around
He better be ready and prepared to be stomped in the groundThe rest is empty with no brain but the clever nerd
The best emcee with no chain ya ever heard
Take it from the Tec-9 holder
They've bit but don't know their neck shine from Shinola
Everything that glitters ain't fishscale
Lemme think, don't let her faint get Ishmael
A shot of Jack got her back it's not an act stack
Forgot about the cackalack, holla back, clack clack blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra chart toppa
Start shit stoppa be a smart shoppa
Shot a cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go
'Bout to jet, get him, not a bet, dead 'em
Let 'em spit the venom said 'em got a lot of shit with 'em
Let the rhythm hit 'em, it's stronger in the other voice
We makes the joints that make 'em spread 'em butta moist
Man, please, the stage is made of panties
From the age of baby hoochies on to the grannies
Ban me the dough rake, daddy
The flow make her fatty shake, patty cake, patty cake
For fake, if he was Anita Baker's man
He'd take her for her masters, hit it once an' shake her hand
On some ol' thank ya ma'am an' ghost her
She could mind the toaster if she sign the poster
A whole host of roller coaster riders
Not enough tracks (is it?)
Hot enuff black (for ya)
It's too hot to handle, you got blue sandals
Who shot ya? Ooh got you new spots to vandal?
Do not stand still, both show skills
Close but no krills, toast for po' nils, post no bills
Coast to coast Joe Shmoe's flows ill, go chill
Not supposed to overdose No-Doz pills
Off pride tykes talk wide through scar meat
Off sides like how Worf rides with Starfleet
Told ya, on some get-rich shit
As he get older he gets colder than a witch tit
This is it, make no mistakes
Where my nigga go?
Figaro, Figaro

O's beats and my rhymes attack
A scary act
All black like Ms. Mary Mack
Wait 'til you see 'em live on the piano
DOOM sings soprano like "una duociano" (singing voice)
My momma told me
Blast him and pass her her glass of Ol' E
Not to be troublesome
But I could sure use a quick shot of double rum
No stick of bubble gum
I like ice cream
We could skip the weddin'
Have a nice dream
She only let him stick the head inWow, it caught me off guard
Went to breathe out and she made me cough hard
Contacted god to let him know to slip two in
Fine, and how are you doin'?
Can I get you a drink? This one's a shoe-in
In a situation that I'm on a mission to ruin
Her big butt and smile was like camo
Hit up the men's room, need more ammo
Watch your 3 o'clock, a new recruit
That's her gin and Juicy-Juice
Used a stick of Juicy Fruit
She just knew she was cute
It's in her own best interests
Less stress hit her with a "do you need a mint?" test
It don't matter if she's slim or dressed to impress
I won't rest, fellas don't fess
Some of them need to eat the whole thing of Crest
It's been a long day
It's just how the song say
[She needed a mint] [she needed a mint]
I hope she don't take this the wrong way
[She needed a mint] [she needed a mint][Intro: MF Doom singing]
It never really mattered too much to me
That I was just too damn old to emcee
All that really matters is if your rhymes was ill
Girl, that's all that really mattered to me, oh baby

[MF Doom]
Looks like it's gonna be a great day today
To get some fresh air like a stray on a straightaway
Hey you, got a light? Nah, a Bud Light
Early in the morning, face crud from like a mud fight
Lookie here, it's just the way the cookie tear
Prepare to get hurt and mangled like Kurt Angle rookie year
The rocket scientist, with the pocket wine list
Some even say he might need some p-sychiatrist
DOOM, are you pondering what I'm pondering?
Yes, but why would the darn thing be wandering?
She's like a foundling, barely worth fondling
My posse's on Broadway like Mama I Want to Sing
Mad plays the bass like the race card
Villain on the case to break shards and leave her face scarred
Groovy, dude! Not to prove to be rude
But this stuff is like what you might put on movie food
Uh, what is jalapeños?
Get it like a whuppin' when you holla at your seniors
Dolla he can overhear the hashish vena
He just came from over there, the grass is greener
Last wish: I wish I had two more wishes
And I wish they fixed the door to the matrix, there's mad glitches
Spit so many verses sometimes my jaw twitches
One thing this party could use is more... booze
Put yourself in your own shoes
And stay away from all those pairs of busted Timbs you don't use
He only keep 'em to decorate
If you wanna peep him, select a date
And bring a deep check, like "Check, mate"
I kid you not, on the dotted line signed
Ever since a minor, kids considered him some kind of Einstein
On a diamond mine grind, she was dumb fine
But not quite the type that you might want to wine and dine
Couldn't find a pen, had to think of a new trick
This one he wrote in cold blood with a toothpick
On second thought, it's too thick
His assistant said: "Doom, you sick," he said "True" through acoustics
Psycho, his flow is drowned in Lawry's seasoning
With micropower he's sound and right reasoning
It's easy as pi, 3.14
One more one false move and they're done for(Madvillain...)

[Wildchild]
Jump on the track with a hardcore hustle
With a busload a niggas this time we bought 'cha muscle
Wildchild's the one to uplift most and it's confirmed
So tonight let's bang this Madvillain music 'till it's adjourned
Loot rushes in head first with the full force of a ram
So the source of the verse coerce the course of a jam
Went to hell and back, saw devil sellin' crack
In fact had to come back with brother with the mask
By yellin' "black.. power to the people", who support raw music
Blessed from the start to keep upliftin' progressive art
To come out and uplift words
Take verbalistic leaps to the next purge(?) compact dope poetical excerpts
Who's the expert (Wild)? With the physical frame
Who's mental was tamed to get over in this musical game
When the Madvillain breaks your dome you'll see
Your interval depth was written for those that slept
We take 100% unpredictable steps
(Say what?) Who's the one that rocked up a party with the vigilance urge
When smokin' the ism the division is blurred, but vengence is heard(?)
And just when ya got, caught up in the cynical thought
Intervals in the shape of a mic get put straight through your heart like..

{*scream, sound of someone bleeding probably through
Their neck, and a heart beating while a man moans orgasmically*}[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Tripping off the beat kinda, dripping off the meat grinder
Heat niner, pimping, stripping, soft sweet minor
China was a neat signer, trouble with the script
Digits double dipped, bubble lipped, subtle lisp midget
Borderline schizo, sort of fine tits though
Pour the wine, whore to grind, quarter to nine, let's go
Ever since ten eleven, glad she made a brethren
Then it's last down, seven alligator seven, at the gates of heaven
Knocking, no answer, slow dancer, hopeless romancer, dopest flow stanzas
Yes, no? Villain, Metal face to Destro
Guess so, still incredible in escrow
Just say Ho! I'll test the yayo
Wild West style fest, y'all best to lay low
Hey bro, Day Glo, set the bet, pay dough
Before the cheddar get away, best to get Maaco
The worst hated God who perpetrated odd favors
Demonstrated in the perforated Rod Lavers
... In all quad flavors, Lord save us
Still back in the game like Jack LaLanne
Think you know the name, don't rack your brain
On a fast track to half sane
Either in a slow beat or that the speed of "Wrath of Kane"
Laughter, pain
"Hackthoo'ing" songs lit, in the booth, with the best host
Doing bong hits, on the roof, in the west coast
He's at it again
Mad at the pen
Glad that we win, a tad fat, in a bad hat for men
Grind the cinnamon, Manhattan warmongers
You can find the villain in satin, congas
The van screeches
The old man preaches
About the gold sand beaches
The cold hand reaches
For the old tan Ellesse's
... Jesus[Intro]
The villain took on many forms..

[Verse 1]
Let he who is without sin cast the first stone
After you who's last, it's Doom, he's the worst known
That'll have your boom blown or even thirst bone
Rock it to a worst clone, just don't curse the throne
Own his own microphone, bring it everywhere he go
So he can bring it to you live in stere-ere-o
Pan it, can't understand it, ban it
The underhanded ranted, planned it and left him stranded
The best, any who profess will be remanded
Yes sir, request permission to be candid? Granted
I don't think we can handle a style so rancid
They flipped it like Madlib, did a old jazz standard

[Verse 2]
Don't mind me, I wrote this rhyme lightly
Off of two or three Heines, and boy was they fine, G
One Black, One Spanish, One Chinese
It keeps the woody shiny year round like a pine tree
Don't sign me I'm about to get a mil without em
Grab him off the shelf, he's the villain, and what about him
So and he's a jerk and you don't know him
Mad how he expand work but won't show 'em
Poor guys, what a sight for old, sore four-eyes
Now hook me with two apple pies and a small fries
All rise, so far art as a Rupple
So raw break it down and make quadruple
It's crucial, you could see it in his pupil
And this time when he get it he'll waste it on somethin' useful
Like getting juiced off a deuce-deuce of cokey
Keep it low key, known to pull a okey-dokey
Silly Goose, Doom is too jokey
Damn he could really use a room or a whole key
Egads, he got enough styles to start three fads
True dat, she bad, I wonder do she come with kneepads
What a call, what a real butterball
Either I get a strike or strike out, gutterball
Rock it like gear for the fall
With knives inside pockets, prepare for the brawl
Yeah y'all you could say its an earful
Beware, do not touch mic, be careful
And just like he said, I coulda told ya
MF, the holder of a boulder, Money Folder
It ain't funny nigga
Money Folder

[Outro]
The muscle-bound karate expert concealed a razor edge
Which could lop the head off of a marble statue once propelled
With notorious world takeover schemes and the most magnificent gadgets imaginable
Villains rapidly grew healthy cash flow
It is explained by a more comedic villain, the bald headed DOOM
This villain rose to incredible new heights of money-making, revenge and extortion
Such was the magnitude of the typical villain

This is no answer!
Very well then... a duel to the deathVillain hold a mic like he's mean and his tummy hurt
In a clean pair, ripped jeans and a bummy shirt
Wonderin' would you clap your hands if he was friendly?
Dapper Dan dipped and pretend to be Fendi and gold sellin'
No tellin', slap a fan hand down, tell 'em "no yellin'"
DOOM, all capitals, no trick spellin'
Got what it take to get it through your thick melon
(Woopwoosh) Fresh witty city skits
When he get wreck, pretty emcees catch titty fits
Told them call the cops, just don't hold your breath for the ball to drop
Better yet, hold on to your halter top
Kept reppin', steppin' in hotta
Ignoring pigs like Bigs Top Shotta
Survivor of a live crew, not out to jive you
It stings when he laugh when he at the bank drive-thru
Wylin', get me every red penny
Sold a lonely only child an imaginary enemy
When he sees the mask and the microphone gizmo
He's the broke host, this is like his own quiz show
This go out to all my brothers doin' long bids and sisters
Who got brothers bein' fathers to the wrong kids
Stay strong and ride like the funky flute
Won't find the Villain in the street inside no monkey suit
Or either at the bar in no gorilly bra
Nor raceway park scoring on no silly car
Ask the stranger he knows who you really are
Behind the mask face stay dark, no boring willy star
Gleaming, dreaming, screaming- he'll be off the heezy soon
Cunning live rats drive at your steaming greasy spoon
In participating places tip your waitresses
A sure fire way to wire, trip the matrices
Skip ya laces, all black tennis miniature
Ball stack, gall tall pack, Guinness minister
Tussle the hustle, cut your dank with dirt
Won't be in the club in a muscle tank shirt
You could find 'em in the pub with the grub stain
Chuggin' on a small tub of pain to his bugged brain
Sane, some say he plum crazy
Amazed at how he still get paid but dumb lazy
That's for him to know and for you to guess
Won't be caught in a suit vest at no computer desk
A suede front, maybe may stunt khaki dig
Not in no braids or no lace-front yaki wig[Intro]
The world is under attack at this very moment by the most powerful person man has ever seen. Fate from the depths of the earth, Operation Lifesaver is in effect, as of right now

[Verse 1]
Wow, it caught me off guard
Went to breathe out and
Then she made me cough hard
Contact the god and let him know to slip 2 in
Fine. How are you doing?
Can I get you a drink?
This one's a shoo-in
Awkward situation that I'm on a mission to ruin
Her big butt and smile was like camo
Hit up the men's room, we need more ammo (reload)
Watch your 3 o'clock, a new recruit
That's her gin and Juicy Juice
Use a stick of Juicy Fruit (fire in the hole)

[Verse 2]
She just knew she was cute
It's in her own best interest
It's less stress
Hit her with the "do you need a mint" test
It don't matter if she's slim or dressed to impress
I won't rest
Fella's don't fess
Some of 'em just need to eat the whole thing of Crest (it's in effect)
It's been a long day (Operation Lifesaver is in effect, as of right now)
It's just how the song say
I hope she don't take this the wrong way
You need a mint bitchAll day

Be celibate, out of his element
Madvillain never forget like a elephant
Any bets, idle threats all irrelevant
Get your man's wallet, tell him "found it", and sell him it
Well writ, as well as well spit for the hell of it
Before the shell hit
Etiquette, spell it
Pumpin dumplins a hundred and sumthin sumthin
Forest Gump chumps get clumps of nuttin' for nuttin'
Tourist, show 'em where the shore is where the shark's at
Hold up, spark that, park rat
Stirred not shaken
Absurd verbs since word to hot bacon
Wrote this rhyme on standard sand paper
Worked out the plan and plot for grand caper
Vil on the cover of Playbill
Grillin' make ya mother say "Ill, hey will ya!?"
Ten feet at least, the beast may still ya
Yeah I feel ya
Hey, hey what's better than the healer yet worser than tequila?
A money-gettin' nigga that's thirstier than a squealer
I guess you had to be there, there was free beer
Last of the Ansars
On the microphone, cyclone, like Myanmar
Hand in the jar, got stuck, took it
Use the glasses, juxed a pot luck, crooked
Flashed and not lookin'
Four words: Cash on the spot... book it
Howdy
Never too loud for me, too rowdy and too black and too proud to be
And he's outtie
Last seen with a Queen
Lakum Dinukum Waliyadin
Nah mean?[Produced by Madlib]

Two two one-two

[MF DOOM]
How DOOM hold heat, and preach non-violence?
Shhh, he about to start the speech, c'mon, silence
On one starry night, I saw the light
Heard a voice that sound like Barry White, said "Sho you right"
Don't let me find out who tried to bite
They better off goin' to fly a kite in a firefight
During tornado time with no coat than I caught ya
Wrote the book on rhymes, a note from the author
With no headshot, he said it's been a while
Got a breadwinner style to get a inner child to finna smile
And that's no exaggeration
The doctor told a patient "It's all in your imagination negro"
Ahh, what do he know?
About the buttery flow, he need to cut the ego
Trippin', to date the Metal Fellow been rippin' flows
Since New York plates was ghetto yellow with broke blue writing
This is too exciting
Folks leave out the show feelin' truly enlightened
They say "The Villain been spitting enough lightning
To rock shock the Boogie Down to Brighton," alright, then

[Bridge: M.E.D.]
Yeah, check, it's enough
Uh, yeah, now

[M.E.D.]
How M.E.D. hold heat like Clint East is reborn?
Leave you with more holes than a dartboard
Haters watch him, Hennessy double shot drink
Like the answer to the problem's at the bottle's bottom
Uhh, from the bottom, top that homey, pay how you owe me
My niggas take no like Kobe
Even with the the arms of the Hulk, you couldn't hold me
From gettin mines, stogies be rolled, smokin and gettin by
Thanks to rap I ain't got a dime
Got me sneakin out of checkout lines with bottles by the waistside
Yeah, smack 'em in the face, let 'em taste pride
Face trial, end up washed up like the shorelines
Do or die ride, how the dead return
Street turns, keep me in this dirt, like an earthworm
What he spit hits and grows, will brothers ever learn
Worth a word, chat with a nerd, meeting adjourned[Produced By: Madlib]

[Verse 1]
You know, you best to watch out (watch your back nigga)
Til you, be fresh out of clout (fresh water trout)
Rumors (out of water) that he got a mouth on the street (somebody tell him yo)
You know, you best to watch out (watch your back nigga)
Who knows, who is watchin in (streets is watchin you)

[Hook]
Hope, they don't know (they don't know nothin)
As much he thinks, they know
That what, he drinks, is Drano
Rat butt, she winks, rainbows

[Verse 2]
Loser, was twice in the fed (comin home son)
User, whose nice in the head (where that shit at bitch)
Choose to, entice him with bread (get paid son)
Air him, they said he was ex-pen-dable (dead him dunn)
Air him, there's no witnesses (tell 'em the B.I.)
Dare him, they said he was ex-pen-dable (dead 'em dunn)
Air him, there's no witnesses (tell 'em the B.I.)
You know, you best to watch out (watch your back nigga)
Who knows, who is watchin in (nosey yo)

[Hook]

[Outro]
This Villain was a ruthless mass conquerer
With aspirations to dominate the universe[Produced by Madlib]

[MF DOOM]
Hold the cold one like he hold a old gun
Like he hold the microphone and stole the show for fun
Or a foe for ransom, flows is handsome
O's in tandem, anthem, random, tantrum
Phantom of the Grand Ole Opry ask the dumb hottie
Masked pump shotty, somebody stop me
Hardly come sloppy on a retarded hard copy
After rockin' parties he departed in a jalopy
Watch the droptop papi
Known as the grimey, limey, slimy, try me, blimey
Simply smashing in a fashion that's timely
Madvillain dashing in a beat-rhyme crime spree
We rock the house like rock 'n roll
Got more soul than a sock with a hole
Set the stage with a goal
To have the game locked in a cage getting shocked with a pole
Overthrow like throwing rover a biscuit
A lot of bitches think he's overly chauvinistic
Let go his dick if that's the case
Rats, what a waste there's more cats to chase
Dogs, he got it like new powers
Woke up, wrote and spit the shit in a few hours
Sheesh! Been unleashed since the glee club
Had your fam saying please make me a dub
Well, since you ask kindly
Where he been behind the mask, who can't find me?
You're blind
In the wine zone leave ya mind blown
When he shine with the 9, he's a rhinestone... cowboy

[MF DOOM]
No no no no enough

[Verse 2 - MF DOOM]
Goony goo goo loony cuckoo like Gary Gnu off New Zoo Revue
But who knew the mask had a loose screw?
Hell, could hardly tell
Had to tighten it up like the Drells and Archie Bell
It speaks well of the hyper base
Wasn't even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace
Couldn't wait for the snipes to place
At least a track list in bold print typeface
Stopped for a year
Come back with thumb tacks, pop full of beer
We're hip hop sharecroppers
Used to wear flip flops, now rare gear coppers
He's in this for the quiche
You might as well not ask him for no free shit, capiche?
Oh, my aching hands
From raking in grands and breaking in mic stands
Villain—his smile stuns ya chick
While he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks
You heard it on the radio, tape it
Play it in your stereo, your crew'll go apeshit
Raw lyrics—he smells 'em like a hunch
The same intuition that tells him "spike the punch"
Curses, we's truly the worsest
With enough rhymes to spread throughout the boundless universes
Let the beat blast, she told him wear the mask
He said you bet your sweet ass
It's made of fine chrome alloy
Find him on the grind, he's the rhinestone cowboy
