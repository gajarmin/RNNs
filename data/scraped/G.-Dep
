[Intro - Take A Mic]
J'ai toujours voulu ramener plusieurs univers dans mon projet
Tout en restant dans le rap
C'est juste mixer plusieurs flows, plusieurs manières de penser, tu vois c'que j'veux dire ?
Donc j'appelle G, MV, Béné
A chacun son point de vue mon pote
Yes

[Couplet 1 - Take A Mic]
J'ai assez de paires de Nike fallait que je passe à la Balenciaga
J'ai assez de phases, que des effets spéciaux dans leurs sagas
Ils ont volés mon style, ils ont volés mon flow, j'fais comme si j'les voyais pas
Les rappeurs c'est des dealers ou des victimes, quand ça se tape tu [xxx]
Yeah Niggas in Space comme Pesos
Eddie Hyde Gang j'suis pas perso
J'suis le dernier colis du dernier cargo du paquebot
J'ai pas tourné la page, j'la remplis recto-verso
Fuck la concu, j'm'entraîne à repousser mes limites
Ils font plus de l'egotrip, dans leurs textes je ne vois aucune logique
Ce que je fais c'est de la balle et je parle pas balistique
Poto si t'as mal ma 'sique est biologique
Tu me vois faire j'te donne l'impression que c'est facile
On sait plaire donc les négros on les fascine
D'après eux ils graillent tout, en vrai c'est la famine
Faire du son pour des loves, j'préfère encore vendre des los-ki
(Faire du son pour des loves, j'préfère encore vendre des los-ki...)

[Pont - MV]
Difficile de percer quand faut être vrai
A chaque [xxx] qui tombe quand mes gars parlent vrai
Quitter le sous-sol, négro respire
A chacun sa paire, mon pote nous on reste digne

A chacun son point d'vue

A chacun son point d'vue

Chacun son vécu, négro
Évite de faire la grosse pointure, négro
J'vois aucune concurrence à l'horizon
Et toi, qui vois-tu, négro ?
Tu vas poiroter, de rien convoiter, si t'as pas grave la thune, négro
A chacun son point de vue, j'préfère mater un gros cul dans une p'tite voiture, négro
Tu peux pas faire [xxx], c'est une grosse affaire, ça  les vrais le savent
Demande à Take-Take, MV ou Genius
Tout n'est pas génial, t'inquiètes on continue
J'te vois te ranger du côté des nuls
Difficile de continuer quand t'es nu
Tu joues l'étalon j'te vois faire la mule
Quand le [xxx] prend [xxx], de l'autre côté du mur, nigga

[Pont - MV]

[Couplet 3 - G.]
On persévère et c'est sévère, on s'est bien compris
Informé H24, comme un négro en son-pri
On les kill, élimine, extermine tous ces négros dans l'industrie
HOD, BDG, mec on taffe dur tous les jours c'est la survie
J'ai pas les cartes comme au Black Jack
J'lève mon verre mais pas de Jack
J'avance sans même regarder derrière
J'prends le dos du bord pas le dos de la cuillère
Négro à chacun son point de vue
On a la même vie mais pas la même vue

[Verse 1]
Uh I done met some girls since we was last together
And even told a few that we would last forever
But we both knew that that wasn't true
Cause let's be honest that's that same lie that I told you
So she saying I'm the reason she can't find hope
Gave her these feeling now she can't cope
So I'm the reason that she always wanna smoke
I'm getting faded as she blowing laughing when she choke
I always keep my shit on replay
She look at me and say I love the shit that he say
And it's too bad that he isn't you
Why can't you be more like these people that you listen to
But I'm still better than her last main
So if I give to her she would take my last name
That's when you text me and it read baby I love you
I hit this jack then hit you back maybe I love you too

Panties on the night stand bra on the tv
That lil plastic keeps the maids out my floor suite
Check my phone all I see fake statuses false tweets
Fuck it I let'em all know how I feel
And if you think I need a filter then you can't handle the real
Now she fresh out the shower and she naked as she come back
Lay on the bed she put her head in my lap

Sittin' here alone writing this in the dark
Flickin' my lighter over and over gave me a spark
Most of these dogs don’t bite, they all bark
But you can get your jaw clocked with them remarks
I'm not on the block sellin’ chalk
I’m on a writer’s block cause I’m thinkin’ ‘bout a lot
Put all that into thought and jot down what I’m feeling
The pain still lingers and I’m barely healing
A loved one just got cancer, now I see life from a man vision
I’m running from God waiting for a damn collision
With the devil, like the plans are settled from the sinnin’
But God's grinnin’ so I know he has more power in him
He has a glass of faith for me, I better get to sippin’
I rather die than see my people struggle to keep livin’
But til then, I’ma keep my head high and keep livin’
Cause if no one else is giving up then why should I give in?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: G]

You know those things you think about right before you fall asleep?
I take all of those things and put 'em all on a beat
I've got visions of the future minus the PCP or LSD
I'm still trippin' on everything that I see
McDonald's on every corner, ready to take your order
Knowing that their product gets you closer to the coroner
I ain't saying Illuminati, I'm saying that paparazzi
Gots you watching on somebody irrelevant to your life
See we care more about who is so and so's wife
Than we care who's in charge of laws of all types
I see the flaws in the stripes and stars of ours
Hallucinating about the freedoms we probably already lost
The patriot act had me acting like "where's the patriots?"
Asking more questions than an undercover atheist
Fluoride in your toothpaste, gots you trippin' like a shoelace
It ain't hard to see the truth when you realize you're facing it![Hook: G]
Baby let me be your music
I'll teach you how to move yo body

You've been all on my mind when I've been walkin the streets
I've been all on my grind to have you talkin to me
You've been all on my mind like you stalkin me
And all them other B****** I got off of me
You wanted a man so I offered me
LOVE NEVER EVER REALLY COST FOR ME!

Yeah, I met this girl lookin' so damn good, yeah and I'ma text her maybe
Put her in that mood, (yeah) where she sex me daily
Piss her off on purpose, (uh) she looks sexy angry
Said you already gotta man, but I bet he ain't me
I'm probably right, said she might fall in love, she probably right
She said she don't fall for my type, girl I'm one of a kind and I love your behind can I get all of that tonight?
I don't mean to sound stale cause I know damn well you got dudes tryna fuck
And I can see that they all fail but they come back one by one linin' up, but what can you do?

[Hook: T. James]

What can you do? Nothing at all cause you're just that fine
I hope you don't mind, but let me grab you by the waist girl, so we don't waste time
You're that luxury item I've seen my whole life that I've been tryna make mine
Love takes time, but I'm in love with your bad side, let me know if that's fine, yeah
Go on with your bad self (go)
Girl go on with your bad self (go)

Cause what momma don't know won't hurt, flirtin' with the truth and you're gon' get honest
I'm in way over my head but
That cute face and that big butt
Got my mind state messed up
So I picture both of your legs up
In the air, yeah I'ma hit it like a snare
You love it when I pull your hair
And all of the rest, they don't compare
So every time you roll up everybody stares over there but

Oduvek si znala da te volim
I kada nisi pored mene taj osecaj zna da boli
Volim da spavam s tobom i da te gledam

Jedino za tebe znam koliko si vredna
I da neces da odes od mene ako te ne dam
Ponekad kad te nemam sreco mnogo sam sjeban
Bez tebe dan tesko moze da mi bude vedar
Volim da te delim s drugovima
Znas da ako ja te imam kao ortak da te ima
Nikad nisam krio uvek pricao sam svima

Svako zeli da te gleda, svako zeli da te ima
Ti si ta sto je dobra i kad je prljava
Svasta bi radio da te drzim u rukama
A ti sve to znas i samo gledas nas
Sad te imam bejbe ali nemam te za jedan sat
Bez tebe zivot ume da bude gorak
Cak i da te nemam dace mi te neki ortak
Ljubavi zasto samo lezis i cutis
Znas da ako imam tebe nesto moci cu da kupim

Used to smoke the best buds bruh but you know I'm lying

Itchin' in my chips
Throttle Speed 'til she hit her max
Mackin' on this grip
(x2)

Mackin' on this grip
M-m-mackin' on this grip
(x2)[Hook: Ill-Noize]
I'm down for my motherfuckas
Talkin' shit, Ima roundhouse you mothafuckas
Close-line, then elbow drop down on you mothafuckas
You pussies think it's funny? Ima clown on you mothafuckas
3 bitches in the 2-door, smokin' on the backwoods, crusin' down Lake Shore
Hit the party 'round 10, don't leave til 4
Then it's back to the crib to turn up some more!

[Verse 1: Ill-Noize]
This my hatin joint, just like Schoolboy
Light another joint, then I hit em with that ill-noize
You pouring all your change into the fountain of youth
I'm pouring out my bank just to wish a bitch would, bark!
So start off on me mothafucka
Here them shots pop off on you mothafucka
Target locked, headshot, on you mothafucka
If you step up in my city with that hard talk mothafucka
Rollin thru these streets with the maestros
All about the come up in my city like D Rose
When you talk your shit, you talk about the past
I couldn't care less, I've moved on from that
Your bullshit don't phase me, I'm gettin it fast
Stackin all this cash, while you sit on your ass
You sound so uptight, like there's a stick up your ass
& when we see you in the streets, we gon' stick-up your ass!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ill-Noize]
Stop playin' like I pressed pause
I'll kill you with my bare hands, no paws
$50 dollar drawers to hold my balls
Bitch, I am in effect, no cause, cut your loss
Bang! On these bitches like bass
Stay the fuck out my face, because you're just another rat in the race, still stuck in a maze
Looking for the cheese, like
Cash Rules Everything Around Me!
I'm colder than Lake Michigan frozen over
Honest Asshole, & I'm rarely sober
Red Rover, Red Rover, we swaggin' over here
Send your baddest ho over!
The New American Dream to live Tax Free!
No Bank Accounts, I got pounds of weed
& a money clip, told your honey, "dip,"
I ain't even want the bitch
Stuntin' for the fuck of it!

(Tonight)Verse (SliQ)

Yeah I think about this everyday
I’m a product of my thoughts tryna’ get myself paid
Put my heart in & though my heart breaks it’s just waves
The key is to float & I’m in flat fleet that makes sails
I’ve been materializing the dreams since I woke up
Getting fizzy when it comes to the cream like soda
It’s never been a ghost hunt
Figures, I should let ‘em in when I post cards
See I play right whenever
When stakes are high at measure
Tryna get mine watch me eliminating my contenders
AS I’m saying this with pleasure, this is making time for cheddar
I work with workaholics so they ain’t no time for leisure
Man the money is the target for the passion as a motive
You should know this, that’s just a reminder you should know this
It’s that heavy medal tone so the sound is golden
Gotta put the money where my mouth is & get this gold in

Chorus + Hook (PxSH)

I’m tryna get it, tryna have it all
And I’ll be screaming n*gger f*ck the law
I mean I’m tryna make paper
I see an image of it later
Like oh (x8)

Verse (G)

Okay... G’s verse, so you know what it i
I got poor man’s dreams but sleep is for the rich
Its workaholic G… & and still I have not done enough
It’s probably my realest verse, none of this is made up
Turned 18… & I’ve been tryna get it all
Do it for my n*ggers, man loyalty is all I know
With a bunch of b*tches & all these girls is down to go
So we go… we go...
But the hustle real, tryna get on stage doe
Dream chasing, hardly sleeping, napping when I need to though
So I’m always there to answer when duty calls
I be like “I’m coming”, that’s something like a booty call
And still study IT, so I’m tryna get it right
So all I write is line… that could be code or rhymes

Chorus + Hook (PxSH)

Verse (Ryu)

Headed to the top
Yall about to fall
Swear to never stop
Till I have it all
Changing the game to what it should have been
Am a no dream, I’m a prophecy, a vision only those with vision see
Am the reason lames losing sleep
With flows to bring back the lost sheep
Fans don’t know what to say, cause normally they’d ask that I go deep
But since underground is where I’m from, now it’s time I hit the mainstream
Becoming tomorrow’s kids dream
Am dropping fly shit like a pigeon, focused like a surgeon
That one rapper to believe in like religion
My mix tape… Highly anticipated
My words like weed… Highly appreciated
You rappers been sleeping, Ain’t no need to lie
Ain’t nobody told me so your music testifies
How the rap game you sacrificed

Chorus + Hook (PxSH)[Verse 1: T. James]

Yeah, I met this girl lookin' so damn good, yeah and I'ma text her maybe
Put her in that mood, (yeah) where she sex me daily
Piss her off on purpose, (uh) she looks sexy angry
Said you already gotta man, but I bet he ain't me
I'm probably right, said she might fall in love, she probably right
She said she don't fall for my type, girl I'm one of a kind and I love your behind can I get all of that tonight?
I don't mean to sound stale cause I know damn well you got dudes tryna fuck
And I can see that they all fail but they come back one by one linin' up, but what can you do?

[Hook: T. James]

What can you do? Nothing at all cause you're just that fine
I hope you don't mind, but let me grab you by the waist girl, so we don't waste time
You're that luxury item I've seen my whole life that I've been tryna make mine
Love takes time, but I'm in love with your bad side, let me know if that's fine, yeah
Go on with your bad self (go)
Girl go on with your bad self (go)
Go on with your bad self (go)

Ain't my fault that she want it (want it)
Game, I'm gon' stay on it (on it)
Keep the whole place poppin' (uh)
What momma gave her she flaunt it (yeah)
That right there is ironic ('ronic)
Cause what momma don't know won't hurt, flirtin' with the truth and you're gon' get honest
I'm in way over my head but
That cute face and that big butt
Got my mind state messed up
So I picture both of your legs up
In the air, yeah I'ma hit it like a snare
You love it when I pull your hair
And all of the rest, they don't compare
So every time you roll up everybody stares over there but

[Hook: T. James]
