Aye[Intro: Ben J]
You want to get active
I don’t really care lil' mama, what’s the deal?
You got a nice body
I’m hungry now, baby tell me how you feel

[Verse 1: Ben J]
Because if you ain’t there we can do foreplay
Girl let's kick it like soccer like Jorge
Have fun in this house, call it horseplay
She like a nigga with some cake like a birthday
Not a little scrawny little nigga doing four days
But don’t get me wrong, I’m skinny with a dope shape
This girl tell me skinny niggas got the bigger dicks
Cause I pulled out mine and I was big as shit
I never speak high league on you little kids
And when I say little, I’m talking big kids
Ya bitch let you talk shit you wear lipstick
Your girl call me ice cream cause that big stick
You wonder why I got a nickname and you didn’t
She said she you barely even hit it, I give her the business
Man you live for this chick, you feel for this chick
But when I come around her crib, I go in on this chick

[Hook]
You want to get active, or want to get chill
I don’t really care Lil mama what’s the deal
You got a nice body, looking like a Meal
I’m hungry now baby tell me how you feel?

She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me (4x)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Shit bang bitch, active
Pigeon fly in the coupe, money in the mattress
Can’t fuck this chick, cause she crazy like my last bitch
Might let you get a taste, Go on tell your girlfriend
So icky wet, really really she a fan
I really want to put her on, but it’s no hands
Overnight celebrity off the slow jam
Bad to the bone, bone baby you want it
So famished, eat it if its Spanish
No bandana, bang my hammer
Girls getting gooey and the Gucci all wow
Carrera and Louie fuck you in your all gown
Owww, Ayyy, pass on to Ben J
In the rose red mirror, she a devil with a waist
Last King Pharaoh , motherfucker in the game
These niggas ain't thorough throw it up in your face, Ayee

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Legacy]
Woah she got to watch it if she skeet on me
I got that underrated dick cause she sleep on me
I close the curtains she go nuts, no common sense
She going German on the blowjobs like "Khhh" and shit
If you gotta go, we can do it in your car
She said my pipe is meaner then the comments on WorldStar
Of course I’m wearing latex, but first I made her taste it
I went down and did the same shit, make the kitty purr like trey pens
My mouth be getting all riddle on her clit real tongue licking
Tony, I’m a pharaoh on the head, “Well Done” get it
I made it rain, bitch, now get a hommie something
She said her name was Paris, and this that Dirty Money!
Please don’t be without a sleeve
'Cause you might get burned like Cleveland 23
Rule blind scissors to the eye, blind sight bastard
YM, 100, West Side, Active

[Hook][Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You a dime, so beautiful, top of the line, so unusual
Words can't define, you're running through my mind all day
I'm so happy you're mine, so beautiful, top of the line, so unusual
Now I think it’s time, hey shawty, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off, ooh
Girl you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off, ooh, better with the lights off

[Verse 1: Legacy]
Hey Miss America, what you look so sad for?
Sweetheart, you only live one time
So put your fantasies on flash forward like
Gone speed me up, got a deadline, cause you need me done
I hate your type, I love you too
I bite your swag cause I wanna do you
Can't blame you, babe
Obama your work clothes girl, make a change
To your lingerie, right like that
That lalalala, make your eyes roll back
I mean you really fine though
Just wanna see you with the lights off
Every guy wanna know how it is
To clap off the lights and turn Khloe to Kim

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 2: Ben J]
Drive off take my girl to have a nice day
Shit was right, so I let her hang my way
You look cute girl, what you wanna do girl?
Drive to my house cause it's only me and you, girl
Checking her out, she had to put her swag on
Acting too happy saying she ain't going back home
I'm like wow, whatever you say
But whatever you plan gotta be done at 8
Next stop
Party at my place, of course you welcome girl
You ain't taking up space
We get there, shawty still looking right
She attacked me, but wait, let me dim the lights
Oh, you look different, she's like boy, stop it
No, I ain't playing, actually you more popping
She said shocking, now that's really raw
I don't know baby, but even with the lights off

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus][Intro]
Yeahhh (knockout) {KNOCKOUT}
(Knockout) {ayup} {yeahhh}
But she ain't gon' tie me down
{Ray J} Nah {New Boyz}
But she ain't gon' tie me down
{No she ain't gon' tie me down}

[Hook: Ray J]
She ain't gon' tie me down, while you on the road
Buying all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What'chu want right now? Whattup right now?
I think you need to close your mouth
Cause you ain't gon' tie me down, tie me down
Tie me down... you ain't gon' tie me down
... you ain't gon' tie me down

[Verse One]
Ayyy, know we been together for a minute
But uh, its kinda been forever since we been in
The kinda situation not involvin other women
And it's pretty obvious that your kinda trippin
Like "Who the hell is this bitch?
Lookin a hot mess, what you fell for this chick?
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it"
I'm like "You need to go somewhere else with this shit"
Because, I ain't gon' put up wit'chu
Talkin 'bout how she make you uncomfortable
Like I mean, shit I'm only 17
And um a perfect couple is only in a dream
And right now I'm pretty much away for this
Relationships? I think you should wait for it
I mean later we could try things out
But not right now

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Ha ha, yeah, look
Ay girl whattup? No I'm not gon' make a scene
But you can't tie me down like a pair of shoestrings
Yeah you cute, so what? Girl let's get it through your head
Yeah we make love, sex, weed all in the bed
It's the "Best That I Ever.." but things gon' change
When I'm not faithful, you be feelin all pain
Now you stuck like a stain and I can't believe that
Baby girl 100, I ain't tryin to do that
Got so many girls and I ain't lettin go
Cause my life is great, and you ain't nothin but a ho
Yeah you come to my shows and you very supportive
Just show me a camera and my show recorded
It was nice, but I'm suprised that you still standin here
As you know, I'm a man, and I have no fear
I'mma start it from the top, girl this ain't no lovin
I'm a New Boy girl so

Got your girl on my swag she lovin them jerkin songs
Like the new iPod just touch it, it turn her on
And when the bass start beatin and the waist I'm beatin
Done I got on my way I'm leavin
She like where you goin? I ain't got my shoes and purse
I said it's none of your concern, and she yelled "You're a jerk!"
So I walked out the door, called Ben J
Told him it's a function he said I'm on my way
We pulled up to the party I take off my shirt and
Got geeked up, e'rybody jerkin
We was jerkin to the right, jerkin to the left
Then she popped up out of nowhere, she was still half dressed
She like f'real jerk, you lookin for this stuff
And the whole party heard her but all I could hear was

[Hook: Legacy]
Wah, wah, wah wah wah "You're a jerk!"
Why you trippin? I ain't even do nuttin "You're a jerk!"
"You're a jerk!" I'm a jerk? You ain't never lie

"You're a jerk!" (I know) "You're a jerk!" (Ay, ay)

"Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk" (Jerky)

[Ben J.]
Ha ha!! .. Everything quiet and the bass real hard
And I stay geeked up never been a retard
Got a New Boy swag and this here for y'all
So they gotta keep it separate like the Jim Crow laws
I'm a beast, I'm a king, and I guess I'm a jerk
And I go through big problems cause your boy here a flirt
Man you call me a bother wit'cha lil' jerk lines
Then you say you brought it up, but the jerk is mine
You squeezin, I'm squeezin, but your style is whack
Why you comin to the front? You can push that back
Got your girl on the side, she tossin a lil' stuff
While she textin on the phone Ben J. hit it rough
So I did it was good and I quickly got dressed
She was like where you goin? There's another girl naked
She screamed out loud Ben J. "You're a jerk!"
And I had nothin to say but sorry that it hurts

[Hook]

[Intro]
Hey... hey! New Boyz

[Verse One: Legacy]
I remember when Pharrell used to rock the tight jeans with ice creams
While riding his skateboard it was like sightseeing
To lames who was afraid to change
If my middle finger could speak then I'd say the same
Nigga I must state my name, call me Legacy bitch
Mrs. Sweetheart, a.k.a let me see tits
Doin too much like a Marvel backflip
Jeans stay skinny like I starve my fabric
Where the haters at? Hello I found you
No I don't give a F word about you
I do me, leave us alone
Why don't you do you and go hump a clone, get it?
Ai, another damn thing
You'll never see me care about another man's jeans
I don't even know, like all through the years
Seem like everywhere I go the only thing that I hear is

[Hook]

Why y'all niggas hatin on my skinny jeans?
Fresh kicks like I copped a magician
You must be missin the simple fact I'mma get it
And you ain't with it, baggy clothes n outfits
You like this, brothers actin stiff like cactus
They comin' off hard but they soft like fabric
They lyin', sayin they the best like Khaled
They chose me, it's obvious I'm meant for the best
Skinny jeans sag low and I know y'all know the rest
I'm Ben J fool, why these dudes wanna trip?
Even though I like to flash, get it jerkin' in my kicks

Bright colors is here, New Boyz is near, ha!

[Hook]

{*4 cricket chirps*} Ha! One verse, one hearse

Lock your old ass down, lil' Ron Isley

Telling me she Pisces, don't do signs, do check signings
Tyga tyrant, I'm with the power, with the diamonds
The fame will blind ya and bitch yeah I'm fuckin blind
See no evil, below the zeroes
More funds to free throw, house got the strip pole
Leave your jeans at the door girls with the speedos

[Hook]

Heard you had a bad day, well, let’s make it good night

When it's time for taxes, a nigga gon' be done for

[Hook]

[Iyaz]
Make me wanna break my
Make me wanna break my bank

[Verse 2: Ben J]
Okay, the start of my day, I took her on a date
Had to scrape for some change, so I went to the bank
But when I seen her she was so damn fine like that
So I headed right back to pull a lot more stacks
Overdrawn, low funds, it's-it's like I'm dumb
But I'll put it right back cause your boy is sprung
Man she is so damn fine got me spendin all this cash
Man it's goin too fast, I need to watch my ass

[Iyaz]
Make me wanna break my
Make me wanna break my bank

[Breakdown]
If you a bad girl, and you need a little change
Tell your man go break his bank (go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you tryin to get paid
Tell your man go break his bank (go-go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you need a little change
Tell your man go break his bank (go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you tryin to get paid
Tell your man go break his bank (go-go break yo' bank!)

[Hook]

[Iyaz]
Make me wanna break my
Make me wanna break my bank[Intro/Hook]
She had a apple bottom, skinny waist
Shake them buns all in my face
Five-six, super freak
Tell all the homies that she got
Buns, buns buns (said she got)
Buns, buns buns (sh-she got)
Buns, buns buns (said she got)
(Sh-she got)

[Verse One]
I like big buns and I can not lie
So if you got some and I see you walk by
I'm a get up, tap you, say hi
Take you to my room, tap you, then bye
Nah I'm just playin
But your friend need to stop cause she ain't got none
I like my buns fat and juicy
I don't want no saggy booty
Tryin to do me not, you can stop
I ain't touchin nuttin less the booty pop
Got a milli' like bank cause I handle cake
If you ain't got money better fly that away
Tell Wolf Pack that a chick need a change
Booty bounce proper, my chick bounce lame
It keeps goin got too much fuel
She don't got a donk, this girl got a mule

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Ben J, oh yep that's me
And I'm lookin for a girl with a dub ID
And a girl who can drink that's mixed with freak
Now it's time to go to war with a mixed booty
I can see this girl want mo'
Now she dealin with her man, nope man didn't go
Got a old school swagh with a new Kangol
And her buns nice display on a black Range Rove'
Checkin those buns this girl got back
And I think she got back cause her momma got back
And her sister got back, and her granny got back
But her auntie got none but they all got buns

[Interlude]
And I got swag to handle it right
And you gon' get it tonight
And once I put it on you
You gon' feel it feel it alright

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Kydd-SB]
I mean buns, where the chick with the buns
Check her real fast lookin like she havin fun
Shake it super hard boy you better not run
Poppin those buns like her booty is a gun
Probably had buns since the day she was one
Buns so big that'll block out the sun
Can't take two, Wolf pass me one
This the New Boys and we all have fun
Kydd leave the club but befo' we was done
She bought me a drink and we both got drunk
Now we at the crib, we both throwin up
But it's all good cause she still wanna hump
Then I bang bang bang 'til the sun came up
Hit the New Boys, said "Come pick me up!"
They pulled up to the front then I hopped in the trunk
Then I told a story 'bout the girl with the buns

[Hook][Ben J]
I walked in the function with dark black shades on
Ice cream jacket and my hat says amazing
I'm a cool cat, but I'm about my money
I'm an urban nigga, hopped out and do the dougie
Fresh as a wanna be, do what I wanna do
2 bad models fighting over me like what it do
I'ma pick this one or I'ma pic that one
The chick so bad, so I'ma take action

[Hook 1]
(Oh you're cute) I know I know
I get that pretty much where ever I go I go
See baby, I'm a rock star, everybody love me
My friends call me cocky, but you can call me Dougie
Dougie dougie dougie
Baby, call me dougie dougie dougie
You could call me dougie dougie dougie
Baby, watch me dougie dougie

[Verse 2: Legacy]
Nac nac noob, wrists frozen
Z-Shock on, my chicks foreign
Excuse me, miss, Roxanne Roxanne
I beat it so loud you think I'm a rock band, No Marilyn
Veteran at this rap shit, no Federline, never him
Trying to tag I, you gon’ need a spray can
’Cause y'all like seeing me, better clean your Ray Bans
Celebrating stuff like a holiday, word up
Travis Porter in the club, all the way turned up
Get it while you can, ma, ’cause we go fast
Don't be thinking I ain't looking Legacy yo ass
When I met her we be talking bout our blind date
She was like, "Oh let’s Do It" Waka Flocka my state
I might wipe her up long as shawty cooking right
Hit the 21 and up clubs and they be looking like

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I'm turned up in the function, I'ma yell that
I'm going dumb with my niggas, where the melts at?
This big girl she bouncing on my pogo
She a fool with it, clowning; Bozo
Nigga, yeah, we popping
And I do my dougie, I ain't talking beat-boxing
Skinny jeans, guitar swag, we rocking
Bet you can't do it like me, boy stop it
I'm the Big Bambino
Swimming in these women like a Dolphin; Dan Marino
Like the Eve song, go and get your tambourine on
Haters you ain't gotta like me though
’Cause I got money
Power Ranger flow and y'all niggas straight putty
It's your boy, Chris rock, but the nigga ain't funny
D-O-U-G-I-E, dougie

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]
Oh you're kind of cute, girl, can I get yo name?
(Call me dougie) Hit her friend up and asked the same thing
(Call me dougie) Put my number in the phone and I said
(Call me dougie) Then I walked away and went to hit my ?
Baby, call me dougie dougie dougie
Call me ?, ?, ?, ?
Call me dougie dougie dougie

[Hook 1][Hook: Shanell]

Yeah, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody baby, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, oohh nobody baby

[Verse 1: Legacy]
She the reason why my clothes stay pressed
While I pack and go
And she the only one at the airport
When I'm back from the road
Took me home
Two ribs on the stove
My favorite how you know?
Hit the couch and she already had the game on
Tivo cause it ended hours ago
She screamed when kobe hit the game winning jumper
Ran through the house like a playground in summer
She wrapped her legs around me and I spunned
Kissed her forehead and said that I love her
She ran the water for me got down in the lingerie
And said that she gon model for me
Perfect way to start the day

[Hook: Shanell]
Who gon', who gon', who gon' love you better than me?
Who's gonna kiss ya'
Who's gonna touch ya' baby better than me?
Yeah, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody baby, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, oohh nobody baby

[Verse 2: Ben J]
I don't think anybody made
You the only who got it made
Like everytime I see you
Our love gets stronger by the days
Take you to different states
Every day a different place
You never heard or seen that race
I'm different people different faces
You wanna be kind
Mommy you mine
I get to work like overtime
I'm past that up high
I know you wanna meet someone who you can fit
And so I step up to the plate
Home runnin' shit

[Hook: Shanell]
Who gon', who gon', who gon' love you better than me?
Who's gonna kiss ya'
Who's gonna touch ya' baby better than me?
Yeah, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody baby, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, oohh nobody baby

[Bridge: Shanell]
You can try something new if you want to
If you want to oooh
And baby you can go
If you think this is ain't where you
Baby where you should be
But don't nobody know you like me
If it takes that for you to see
Than baby you can go
But like I said before, can't nobody

[Hook: Shanell]
Who gon', who gon', who gon' love you better than me?
Who's gonna kiss ya'
Who's gonna touch ya' baby better than me?
Yeah, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody baby, can't nobody

(Um, huh, excuse my friend)
(He's kinda new to meeting girls cause he's used to men)
Used to men!! (Girl this dude is stupid huh?)
Yo I ain't gay (Man why don't you tell the truth for once?)

[Hook: Legacy]
Cashmere, Cashmere, you know I'm really diggin yo' style

Cashmere, Cashmere, you don't need that dude Ben J
Cashmere, Cashmere, but yeah you wanna be my babe!

[Verse Two: Ben J] + (Legacy)
See it's like this, 5'11 with good sex

(Nah bro, 5'8, swass size great)
(Long as hell I can make you lose weight)
(But your body off the chain, make me wanna scream)

[Verse Three: Legacy]
He a dog girl, all he do is run and smell
You wanna buff Nick Cannon or a young LL?
Guess the point I'm tryin to make is he dumb as hell
And I can make you fall in love after one quick meal
Then she stopped, paused, stared in my eyes
And for the first time moved her mouth to reply
She said that she kissed a girl and she liked it
And ever since that night she was a full blood dyke chick
(What? Wait huh, did she just, what she say? Hell nah!!)

[Hook: New Boyz]
Cashmere, Cashmere, that's why yo' breath stink
Cashmere, Cashmere, what the hell's wrong with yo' teeth?
Cashmere, Cashmere, when I said I liked you I lied
Cashmere, Cashmere, I'm over here, uncross yo' eyes
{*laughter*}

[Legacy]
Ay yo Don't get me wrong though
We love Lesbians
Just not you

Man I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow [x3]
Dudes think their fresh but we ain't even on the same boat
Man I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow [x3]
Dudes think their fresh but we ain't even on the same boat
Man I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow [x3]
Dudes think their fresh but we ain't even on the same boat

[Legacy]
My style is so retro
S o fresh yo
I got the best cloth
You still rocking Echo
Like yodels I am lethal
Lethal weapon
Speak so f'in great
I am flyer then the eagles
People listen New Boyz is skytop
Chilling with a boom box and tube socks on my block
Which is the international fly curve
I feed so many fly things
I can even bite birds
My word
And the haters get mean
I keep my shit toke
But the lace is still skinny
I got plenty
Girls maybe 10 at a few
And I'm never blushing
Let my gear shatter proof
I am fly
Like legend was an insect
Only messin friends and family
No incest
Colors ain't a rainbow no homo
We flawless
Them leprechauns where the pot of gold is in my closet

[Hook]

[Ben J]
Too fresh
You know I rock the proper stuff
Its Ben J and I'm cleaner then a doctors glove
A lot of love I get from the block and stuff
And you can say I pack haters
Cause I box them up
I'm hot and stuff
The sun gives me lots of love
And I ain't stepping on snails
But I'm Poppin slug
Naww I'm playin
I'm just saying its a lot of bloods
Who ain't afraid to kill a soul
Like the locked up thug
But back to the point
Me I got them chopper colors
Like the kitchen of a fanta lover
The hood love me
Even got the suburbs yo
On my team so you need a lot others yo
Damn I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow
You ain't changing nothing like you sleeping with the same ho
Everybody wanna watch the New Boyz style
Even the Cool Kidz wanna be the New Boyz now

[Hook]{*crickets chirp 24 times to open*}

[Intro]
Hey... hey! New Boyz

[Verse One: Legacy]
I remember when Pharrell used to rock the tight jeans with ice creams
While riding his skateboard it was like sightseeing
To lames who was afraid to change
If my middle finger could speak then I'd say the same
Nigga I must state my name, call me Legacy bitch
Mrs. Sweetheart, a.k.a let me see tits
Doin too much like a Marvel backflip
Jeans stay skinny like I starve my fabric
Where the haters at? Hello I found you
No I don't give a F word about you
I do me, leave us alone
Why don't you do you and go hump a clone, get it?
Ai, another damn thing
You'll never see me care about another man's jeans
I don't even know, like all through the years
Seem like everywhere I go the only thing that I hear is

[Hook]
Da-da-da-da New Boyz, Da-da-da-da tight jeans {*2X*}
"Oh my God, why they jeans so tight?" (Oh my, oh my)
"Oh my God why they jeans so tight?"

{*4 cricket chirps*} Psh, they like crickets to me

[Verse Two: Ben J]
Look, I'll scoot back let me give y'all your shot
Now get money, best believe I'mma get mine
I see haters and I'm looking at 'em like please, let me breathe
Why y'all niggas hatin on my skinny jeans?
Fresh kicks like I copped a magician
You must be missin the simple fact I'mma get it
And you ain't with it, baggy clothes n outfits
You like this, brothers actin stiff like cactus
They comin' off hard but they soft like fabric
They lyin', sayin they the best like Khaled
They chose me, it's obvious I'm meant for the best
Skinny jeans sag low and I know y'all know the rest
I'm Ben J fool, why these dudes wanna trip?
Even though I like to flash, get it jerkin' in my kicks
I'mma just keep it straight like no one else
Bright colors is here, New Boyz is near, ha!

[Hook]

{*4 cricket chirps*} Ha! One verse, one hearse

[Verse Three: Tyga]
Ha! Get tighter, as the ghost of Mike rises
Tight jeans, naw nigga, I don't get hyphy
So you think you can dance in them fake Nike?
Lock your old ass down, lil' Ron Isley
I've been icey since minute maid made Hi-C
Telling me she Pisces, don't do signs, do check signings
Tyga tyrant, I'm with the power, with the diamonds
The fame will blind ya and bitch yeah I'm fuckin blind
See no evil, below the zeroes
More funds to free throw, house got the strip pole
Leave your jeans at the door girls with the speedos

[Hook]
I'm grown I don't do those, New Boyz with new dough
Other niggas Brunos, homies with homos
I'm Young Money, Sqad Up, GD capo
I get them cheese, extra cheese, no nachos/not-yours
Tyga man tatted like vatos (ya-da-da-da)

[Hook]

{*4 cricket chirps*} Heh, they like crickets to me[Verse 1- Legacy]
Look, I went over pick-up lines in front of mirrors all the time?

You my heart, if you leave me then I bet that I'm a die
See wiz said I had to get you from your man
And biz told me that you said he's just a friend

And she got some nice hips they get it from momma
Hit the sex room then we gotta change up the drama
This girl gone wild I think I'm loving her persona
She like to wear prada louie v. & Gabbana
Street clothes over longerai on the bottom

But I had to suck it up and tell this cutie wassup

Aye[Verse 1: Legacy]
You know I feel myself the way I'm just a little fellow
Lil people playing games but they still ain't on my level
Ain't touching my clothes, y'all stunting my growth
All these nosey little kids tryna Budden like Joe
But I put my effin' guard up like this is effin' Sparta
The kid is scary, Mr. Man he live with every martian
I live with every martian, you salute the master
My sh*t outta this world like I doo-dooed on Saturn
They like is you tatted?
I say nah but I'm packing
Put out a sex tape and we both be blasted, get it?
Y'all ain't hearing a kid
My iPod got The Bangz like it's wearing a wig
They be like Legacy he suck
I put my middle finger up like Legacy these (cough)
Don't call me out, unless I'm gonna get it popping
If you tryna find my swag
You better go a build a rocket, boy

[Hook: Sabi]
See I found my swag, and put it in the bag
And the shit was so fresh like fresh out the Bags
I still got the tags
Like if I had a receipt, I could take it right back
Wait, take it right back
See I found my swag, and put it in the bag
And this shit is so fresh like fresh out the Bags
See I found my swag, I found my swag
See I found my swag and this shit is so fresh
I found my swag

[Verse 2: Sabi]
Newsflash!
Another singer turned rapper, turned actor
Turn to channel 7, you might see me up in NASA
Blast off, I might mess around and be an astro-naut
Anyway I'm really, really hot
All the men applaud, I'm the real hot flasher
I need to bake a track just to catch 'em in a rapture
TMZ, catch one of me on my Louie bag tip
I don't really boast but I am the one to brag quick
Tag it, hide and seek
I know where my swag is
Right behind my Vera Wangs and my Gucci fabrics
Classic, half-breed, Sabi is a bad mix
Combination of half black, half bad bitch
I'm the freaking best, I'm the best he ever had
Boys are like a shopping spree, I just put 'em in the bag
Or hand em off to Ella, let her pop a couple tags
Cause that boy is out of style, on to the next fad

[Hook]

[Ben J]
Let me set a trend up all boys is my plan
Yo, my steez is so cold, you should call me Iceman
No steez bout it cause I think everyone should cop this
Stop this dog, you should shop at Hot Topic
Skinny jeans is too much, you can't handle
So you should flip-flop the subject like sandals
My fits so bad you snitched on me like Randall
You know ?
I blow you out like candles
I'mma go hard and bang on em like The Bangz
I'm a cold young figure, I should Dash up the Flames
I'm a pimp with no cane, y'all frosted flakes in the winter
Pissing on you brodies styles like a bowl of kitty litter
I'm a beast and you know it, young king of hip-hop
And time has changed since Flava wore his wrist watch
I'm on fire and I ain't even use my lighter
They say Ben J, you the shit like diamonds

[Hook]
See I found my swag and put it in the bag
And the shit was so fresh like fresh out the max
I still got the tags
Like if I had a receipt, I could take it right back
Wait, take it right back
See I found my swag and put it in the bag
And this shit is so fresh like fresh out the max
See I found my swag, I found my swag
See I found my swag and this shit is so fresh
I found my swag...

I found my swag
I found my swag
And this shit is so fresh
I found my swag[Verse 1 : Oktane]

Yeah ! Now what we say
"Girls are like buses girl girls are like buses" (Yeah)
"Girls are like buses girl girls are like buses" (Yeah)
"Miss one next 15 one comin miss miss one next 15 one comin" (Yeah)
"Miss one next 15 one comin miss miss one next 15 one comin" (Yeah)
Now what we do
I let my swagger do the talking I don’t say a lot so
I’m a put down for girl like they weigh a lot [x3]
Alright, you already know when theses girls try to get to me
I’m the reason that their boyfriends probably sick of me
I'm too fly, dirt is never hittin' me
My swagger on a dagger, I’m a stab her with it quickly
They never get it back in the time I get it
So if you leave now your friend will be here in a minute
Cause Beetle probably want you and Ninja pay attention
Bet your boyfriend probably doesn’t want that squad business
As a million of you not another me
You got a man but come on, compared to me who is he ?
It’s Tanya Tesha Keisha and Bree
So if I’m in front of you I’m texting another free
Because


[Chorus:]
Girls are like buses girl girls are like buses [x2]
Miss miss one next 15 one comin [x2]
Girls are like buses girl girls are like buses [x2]
Miss miss one next 15 one comin [x2]


[Verse 2 : Pricetag]
I let my swagger do the talkin' I don't say a lot so
I'mma put it down for you girl like it weight a lot
I'mma i'mma put it down for you girl like it
I'mma i'm i'mma put it down for you girl like it weight alot
Yessir Pop Tag Trice yeah you're rockin' with the best one
Major makin' mula they be smiling when they checks (Yes um)
Come chicks tricks babies me I never stress
Jay-z em all I be on to the next
I stunt hard but never know drizzy
One game around the chick till her brain get dizzy
Let’s get busy everybody know me never trippin' off a chick
Because it's Brodies Over Wodies
This ain’t never nothin' new we been up on that cause if Price
Don’t crack the brodie ninja gonna snatch
We pointin' out rats but never give them cheese
Cause you get none of these please at ease
All of these feeds on my day to day jocks
Chicks all around my neck like a Flavor Flav clock
They say that they hot
But I feel that they stay
We compare chicks everyday but I must say


[Chorus]


[Verse 3 : Ben J]
Now what we do
I let my swagger do the talkin' I don't say a lot so
I’mma put it down for the girls like they weight a lot [x2]
I’m i'mma i'mma put it down for the girls like they weight a lot
Ok, I pulled two girls cause my swag started talkin'
They were lookin' pretty hard so I had to start flossin'
Startin walkin' the other way my pants started fallin
Money comin' out my pocket so you really know your ballin'
People hatin' on my jeans cause they don’t have a swag
And when you don’t have a swag you can’t throw it in the bag
So girls are like busses I get them like De Niro
And if they are busses then I’m an orange Camaro
I keep it straight and simple
I am the t-t-trending topic of the week best style with this industry
Young king of hip-hop iced out, wrist watch
G-shocks so loud don’t you hear his tick-tock
Girls like d-side but when I’m on a track I get cocky
So running back you can’t stop me and that’s the fact
You try to block me that’s a wrap and make all my swag crack
Cause I’m so damn raw and I got it like that
Ben J !


[Chorus]


[Verse 4 : Legacy]
I let my swagger do the talkin' I don't say a lot so
I’mma put it down on the girls like they weight a lot [x2]
I’mma i'mma put it down on the girls like they weight a lot
I met this girl named Jennifer I was into her like a splinter
But Jennifer into slipperier and it’s like Christopher
I kicked her rad out of my life
Mister "I’m mad at my wife"
So I spend most of my time tryin to get me a better one like
Jennifer's sister but I ain’t know
She prefers the wreck relationships and mines ain’t long
No body part ain’t no one more cockier than me
So I acted like a bus and dropped her off on the streets
When the freaks want me then she looks decent
She told me she rock 50 miles an hour no seat belt
Winter so I got her a new coat with fur
She wanted Gucci so I left her in the cold like "burr"
Then I met this Spanish babe that had the cutest Spanish frame
She told me she was with it and was down for anything
Said and if it wasn’t move forward into she’ll make the way
I don’t want to catch a bus I’m gonna ride a train today Ha!

[Chorus:][Verse 1: Legacy]
Hello, bad bitch
Hello, hello, bad bitch
I don't like Knicks
But the Irv got a nigga to wear that Melo swag shit
Like, ooh, yeah, you cocky huh?
But I bet you can’t take it like a Rocky punch
Trying to get it in, get it in, get it in
Wanna let my stick hit it Ms.Hockey Puck?

Hey What up Felli. Knock out. Yo Like I say, Ray J, L.A stand up. Yeah west coast

RAY J -Chorus:
We goin' party till the early morn
When the Lakers bring the trophy home
We got that California purple gold
And F them Laker Haters cuz we down with the greatest

ICE CUBE:
Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off 'em in the finals so often
Always on fire, keep 'em chuckin' and coughin'
Off that California purple, that Laker Purple in the air
C’mon everybody, Paul Pierce need his wheelchair
3rd year, still there, this will be my third
My style's like Magic Johnson, yours is like, Larry Bird
Overrated nerd, but this ain’t the 80′s man
We got Ron Artest, don’t you know, he’s a crazy man
Defense all crazy man! This ain’t no lazy man!
All up in your jersey like the ghost of James Worthy
You ain’t worthy to hold up that championship trophy
Rollin' down Figueroa on the bus with Kobe
Don’t ask my ring size, you already know it
I got a drawer full I might as well throw it
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
It’s goin' be sweet to watch the Lakers repeat
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
Yell "beat LA!" and get Boston beat

Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off em in the finals so often
Always on fire, keep em' chunkin' and coughin'
Off that California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple

[Hook]

[Verse 2 Chino XL and Roscoe Umali]
Chino XL:
The Lakers are magnificent
Critics better admit it
We winning, shoot it, pivot
With less than a second left and it swishes
Don’t test us, you know how vicious
Artest is, leavin' the Celtics cryin'
Like Lebron when the Magic gave em that ass whippin'
Lake Show you know we down for the kill
Score numbers greater than gallons lost in that BP oil spill
Paul’s pie gets pierced by the king of the kings
Rondo’s obsessed like Schmegal with the Lord of the Rings
His name was Kobe

Roscoe Umali:
Roscoe Umali, I reppin' for the Lakers
The all time greatest, can't nobody fade us
I do it for the jersey that be hangin' from the Staples
Jabbar, West, Magic, Worthy, Chamberlain and Baylor
Fisher, Pau and Bynum got championship rings with diamonds
While the homies Ron Artest to run the defensive assignments
Bench mobbin' Odom, the Black Mamba Kobe
We parade on Figueroa with the championship trophy

[Hook]

[Verse 3 New Boyz and Ray J]
New Boyz:
We the best it's so. How you ain’t a fan by now bro?
Laker’s over there head like it Shannon Brown dunk
Anybody stepping up, we getting rid of them lanes
Say LeBron needs Verizon, he ain’t getting a ring
Play LA and it’s over for sure
Tell them Boston leprechauns that them clovers don’t work
The Lakers win another championship
That’s why we got D Fisher to keep on reelin' 'em in

Ray J
It’s gonna be down Lakers in the motherf---in house right now
Ya’ll need to stop, stop runnin' your mouth
We gone celebrate and pop bottles right now
You ain't gon' top us down

New Boyz:
Ok I’m ballin, yeah I’m ballin
Them fouls you can’t be callin’
Watch you in it girl
League my n---- we be on that Spartan
Number one and you can call in
We put that ass to bed
Buzzer shot game winnin'
Derek Fisher, Ron Artest, Kobe Bryant on they head
We call that dude the man
Catch us up in LA reppin with my Laker fans
Purple and gold, yeah we smashed 'em up and they gone
Lakers took the whole series and the rest went home

ICE CUBE:
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
It’s goin be sweet to watch the Lakers
Repeat I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
Yell "beat LA!" and get Boston beat
Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin

[Lil Rob]

Since you left your ex, all your friends think I'm bogus
You got your nails done, I bet your ex wouldn't notice
Swag on point, She don't shop at all the local spots
Without makeup, she look like she been photoshopped
You had a deal, you'll get Marbury millz
If you on the front cover, you'll be off every shelf
