[Verse 1: David Stones]

I hopped out with that system thumpin
Get this party jumpin I be stuntin on these mothafuckas They ain't saying nothing
I see them niggas that be muggin
But them boys be fronting man we really thuggin they ain't hurtin nothing
I just looked at shorty like whatever
We should get together
Fuck them dudes you need somebody with some cheddar
Said she been waiting on forever to hop up in that 745 and give it to me on the leather
Then she got a look at my baretta
One in the head she never bust one off she asked my if I'd let her
Baby I could do one better
Why don't you just throw this in your pocketbook it's lighter than a feather
Cause I be waiting on someone to dumb out
So I could pull that drum out
Bust one off and then watch everybody run out
But that ain't even all that I'm bout
When I'm in the club all them ballers and them bad girls come out Cause

[Hook]

You could hear that system bumping for you see me coming
I be stunting on these motherfuckers
They ain't saying nothing
Niggas run and tuck they woman when they see me coming I be stunting man these dudes ain't saying nothing

[Verse 2: David Stones]

Shorty told me Stones you be that nigga
That's why them dudes be hating so just keep your finger on the trigga
Everybodies fucking with ya
Every girl up in my city up on they wall they got your picture
I replied to shorty that's what's up and we should stay in touch
I like you much and shorty I ain't even bluffing
Then from there we started touching
After that I took her back to the hotel and we started fucking
You should see the way my niggas rush in
Hop up on stage we got them niggas wilding all them girls be dumbing
Ayo that ain't even nothing cause when we out of town shit be getting so crazy we bring them guns in
Cause I be waiting on someone to dumb out so I could pull that drum out
Bust one off and then watch everybody run out
But that ain't even all that I'm bout
When I'm in the club all them ballers and them bad girls come out

[Hook]Intro

Who would've thought when we was young
This what we'd become
I remember when we didn't even know that we was from the slums
We was having fun
Rain, Sleet, Hail, or Sun

Chorus

I'm a get it
I'm a get it
Just watch me I'm a get it
I'm a get it
I'm a get it
Just watch me I'm a get it
I'm a get it
I'm a get it
Just watch me I'm a get it
I'm a get it
I'm a get it
Fuck you if you ain't with it
(Repeat 1x)

Verse 1

This is for my niggas that be swiping that ain't even got a license
But be whipping in them foreigns getting cake with all the icing
For my niggas that was bummy
Now they getting to the money
For them hunnies with degrees who ain't fucking with no dummies
For my niggas bout that action
All they know is make it happen
They ain't really with the yapping
Get too loud and they start clapping
Look I want the whole pie
I ain't in it for no fraction
Boy I need that money stacking
Why the fuck you think I'm rapping

Chorus

Verse 2

This is for my niggas on a mission
Tryin not to rot in prison
For the homies that be whippin bricks up in they momma kitchen
For them hunnies that be strippin just to pay off their tuition
For my people up in college tryna bring to life their vision
I'm a get it for my family
I'm a get it for my niggas
I'm a front on every single bitch that ever tried to diss us
I'm a run down on them no that be acting like they run it
Hit the club and throw some hundreds
I'm a spend it like I won it

Chorus

Verse 3

Who would've thought when we was young
This what we'd become
I remember when we didn't even know that we was from the slums
We was having fun
Rain, Sleet, Hail, or Sun
And the furthest that we thought ahead was "I don't wanna go to bed"
Nowadays the only thing that's on a nigga mind is bread
I gotta get this bread
I gotta get this bread
Fuck what haters said

Chorus[Verse 1: David Stones]

When Stones drop a tune boy your spotlight doomed
That boy Ex make the bass go "Boom"
There's not a safe place in the room
Watch that Benz turn into a spaceship (vroom!)
I'm a light year from where they call Cancun
I'll be back somewhere around earth time, noon
Not a second late or too soon
You dealing with a real tycoon
I, overflow on the track like typhoons
Fuck your little train of thought
My freight needs room
When met face-to-face with my platoon
The simple minded run
While the educated swoon
I seen shorty clear across the room
Now she so damn close I could taste he perfume
Me amor in that Dior I adore
Said she love it when I rhyme for a cause (cause)
Fuck a punchline I dabble in philoshphies like Socrates
They do it but they do it so sloppily
Me on the other hand I do it properly
I'm a freight train in the bike line
There's no stopping me
I paid the toll and traveled down this road before
You want?
Bring it on
They can't fuck with me!
We live at the Ramada like!

[Hook: David Stones]

We live at the Ramada!
(We live at the Ramada)
We got the telly poppin' like
(We got the telly poppin' like)
We live at the Ramada!
(We live at the Ramada)

[Verse 2: David Stones]

Don dada
It's none hotter
OT late night at the Ramada
See shorty lickin' her lips dipped in Escada
Her bff doin' the Prada
She whispered that she wanted me inside her
And she like to climb on top
She's a rider
Damn boo, you hot like lava
And I could tell that pussy wet like agua
She said her best fried wanna jump in
Well, shit baby girl go 'head jump then
We could get this whole thing jumpin'
Do it 'til the box spring slumped in
Now is you gonna back it up or you frontin?
That's when she showed me something
(Y'all done got me started now)
We got the telly poppin' like! (2x)
We live at the Ramada
We got the telly poppin' like
We live at the Ramada[Verse 1: David Stones]

On dark nights if you recite this you'll notice a light lit
My life is real it's more than just fly shit
Fast cars and bad chicks that ride dick
I spit it for the people that's surviving the hardships
Chasing your dreams ain't as easy as it seems
When you're from where most brothers don't make it to 17
Man these streets mean
Some of the shit I seen'll fuck you up in the head and lower your self esteem
Triple beams
Dope fiends
Shorty only 14 and fucking for a pair of jeans
Man that shit crazy
That's somebody baby
Lil' homie scheming with the hammer off safety
Cause they don't understand the value of life
Influenced by some shit some entertainer said on the mic
And I say some wild shit too I know it ain't right
But I do the best I can tryna' balance the hype
Last night I has a conversation with God
He said: "son you up against all of the odds
You was built to be strong but times gonna get hard
Now get a good night sleep cause you starting tomorrow"
So I'm on my job
I'm on my shit
To use my God-given gift with the pen to uplift
I refuse to entertain the fuck shit
If you looking for change watch this

[Verse 2: David Stones]

How come in the hood we got projects
You think it's a coincidence?
Or could it be that it's just one big experiment?
Structured to see how a group of people react when you pack 'em on top of each other and just feed 'em the scraps
We was taught to spend stacks to put work on the block
Instead of spending that guap to go invest in some stocks
Killing each other man this shit gotta stop
Grab another nigga down just to get to the top
Ayo another gloc popped means another brothers shot
And another brother shot means another brothers locked
Now that's 2 mothers crying cause one sons in the grave and the others in a cage chained up like a slave
No I'm not a saint and never will I ever claim to be
I'm just a man with compassion for humanity
That's why I had a conversation with God
And said: "please, teach me to see pass the mirage"

[Verse 3: David Stones]

We so caught up with shittin' on our haters
That we neglect the people that be showing love and forget to return the favor
Even to our creator
It's hard to concentrate in a world that only glorify the paper-chasers[Verse: David Stones]

I could tell them sexy ass lips is good for more than just talk
And I could tell that kitty good by the way that she walk
She know I'm cut from a whole different cloth
From the County of Kings
Where they breed Kings of New York
I met shorty OT at a weekend resort
It was hotter than a bitch so she was rocking some shorts
With some converses so we started conversing
Told me that she came to kick back and do some soul searching
I could dig that
Shorty ass fat
Nice rack
Asked her out to eat she said she'd like that
Later on scooped her in the V
You know, all black
Cleaned up nice damn, baby girl you all that
She fly in some heels or some kicks with a snapback
Paparazi on her heels fiending just to snap that
I can't stop staring at those curvy ass hips
And lord the way she licking those lips
Oh, shit
She wanna hop in the ride
Throw on some tunes and enjoy the good vibes
She tired of lies and lame guys that think that they live
That's why I got her mesmerized when I look iin her eyes she reply
"You the man baby"
Me and my whole team get it in and we roll deeper than the fucking navy
Them hoes ain't got a clue
Try to play me I force 'em to call audibles
My ex-chick thought she had me where she wanted me
Shit
Where I'm at is where I wanna be
Bitch
But real spit you the one I'm tryna' deal with
Fine as fuck plus somebody I could deal with
She saw what's in my cup and she asked me "what's that?"
I let her take a sip now she don't know how to act
Shorty staring in my eyes while she grinding on my lap
Then she threw that thing back and made it clap
Oh, snap
Was it something I said that got these haters hating when they should be grinding instead?
You kow you got 'em mentally scared when they debating on whether you be shining too hard
I'm on some lowkey shit with a bad ass chick in the spot
Moonlight ricocheting off the watch
Yea I had a couple shots and uh
Nevermind, I forgot[Hook]

They love it
They need it and we made it so far they can't believe it
Critics said that we won't ever achieve it
So I guess their expectations we exceeded
We does it, So rugged
But somehow get accepted by the public
Get rejected then connected on some bugged shit
The same reason why they hate is why I love it
(Yeah) Why they hate is why I love it
The same reason why they hate is why I love it
(Yeah) Why they hate is why I love it
The same reason why they hate is why I love it
(Yeah) Why they hate is why I love it
The same reason why they hate is why I love it
(Yeah) Why they hate is why I love it
I love it, I love it

[Verse 1: David Stones]

This is for my niggas in the trap with the gacs moving g-packs
This more than rap matter of fact even more than that
This for them honey's in the hood tryna get away
Hustlin' everyday just to make a little pay
I feel your pain times changed It's a cryin shame
That our brothas and sisters are strugglin' just to maintain
That's why I vowed to get in this game to make a change cause if it was u u would want the fuckn' same
I never understood how they throw us to the wolves
Like they don't see the shit we lack in the hood
Ain't shit but scraps and some shacks in the hood
So how they gon' judge the way we act in the hood
They think the only thing we do is slack in the hood
Chillin' all day sippin yach in the hood
Buying backwoods and dime sacks in the hood
Fuck that!
Yo that's why I spit facts for the hood cause

[Hook 1x]

[Verse 2: David Stones]

This is for my people in the fast lane tryna live the fast life
Finding out that they didn't read the map right
Now they on the same exact road as last night
Lookin' for a flashlight falling victim to the hype
Hindsight is 20/20 but a better view is when you stop to look at what's right ahead of you
Most the time what you needs not what you wanna do
That's why it's good to know the differences between the 2
Open up your eyes and get wise to the truth
You could make a lot of money rhymin' in the booth
And you could make a lot of money ballin' shooting hoops
But if u free your mind your potentials through the roof
In the hood success doesn't leave a lot of proof so we stick to what we know cause we gotta get the loot
But "all money ain't good money's" the truth
That's why I do it for my people strugglin' and the youth cause

[Hook 1x][Intro: Buckshot Speaking]

[Hook: Shirley Bassey Vocal Sample]

Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Cause I got style
Everybody's waiting for me
Check my gold diamond ring
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Cause I got style
Everybody's waiting for me
Check my gold diamond ring

[Verse: David Stones]

1,200 on the watch and I ain't talking bout 12:00
Something light, you know?
Custom made G Shock
Pinky ring flooded with a couple rocks
Chillin' sippin' on Ciroc
Hold up
Bitches blowing up my phone cause they know I'm bout to claim the throne
Climbing up them steppin' stones with my Louies on
Shorty came to the club with her nudies on
Now she in my room in the nude sippin' on Patron
Butt naked in her Louboutin's
Word is bond we bout to get it on

[Hook: Shirley Bassey Vocal Sample]

[Verse 2: David Stones]

They been waiting on a minute for that Brooklyn boy
Now I'm finally here so they all scream and jump for joy
Flyer than a jet plane that just deployed
You'll see me sitting in the whip dipped like some chips ahoy
Listen baby boy I'm the real McCoy
I'm that dude lame niggas hope they chicks avoid
Drinks is on me everyone enjoy
If you came to have a good time make some noise[Verse 1: David Stones]

We got so much shit that we could cry about
But we just ride it out
I remember many days in the house hiding out
Cause I ain't have shit to wear
Some say you shouldn't care but they never felt the stares
It's clear they never felt despair
Or the wear and tear of being broke so many years
I remember being young thinking life ain't fair
When your peers stay fly how the fuck you compare
I don't wanna hit the trap cause I know that's it's lethal
And, I ain't tryna' poison my people
But it's not too many options they leave you
Dear God talk to me big homie I need you
I'm down for whatever and my homies as well but my only fear is going to hell
Some say we already there cause from heaven we fell
Well shit, I don't know I'm just tryna excel

[Hook: David Stones]

Last night I had a vision
I woke up looking at the world different
Gotta free my mind from this prison
It's all or nuthin' I ain't asking for permission
I had to make a decision to follow through on my intuition
Cause last night I had a vision
I woke up looking at the world different

[Verse 2: David Stones]

Ayo I'm riding through the 'Ville bumping some Meek Mill, Kendrick and Big K.R.I.T
Some real shit I could feel
With a bad chick on her knowledge of self shit
Who just put me on to K'La the Lyricist
I heard somebody say: "Yo, who is he tho?"
Real talk
Then somebody else replied: "That's the future of New York!"
Yea that's right I got these haters all distraught
Because I paid the cost to be the boss what the fuck these niggas thought
I debuted in '06
You must be on that thing you sniff if you think I just got poppin' overnight
Shit
Man this game is full of fake-ness
Sometimes I feel I'm so real I won't make it
A artist used to be somebody blessed with a gift
Now it's all about the best marketing and most tricks
First they try to diss
Then they see you build a buzz and they all up on your dick man, they make me sick

[Hook: David Stones]

[Verse 3: David Stones]

If you real then I see you dog
The other 95 percent I can't fuck with y'all
Naw, I could never put my trust in yaw
Cause I know them evils done corrupted y'all
I never chased the fame I was outrunning the pain
Dodging the ordinary steady looking for a change
People told me: "Ayo David you insane, it's a million fucking rappers how you gon' get in the game?"
I stayed focused just mastering my lane
Back when me and Styxx kept each other on our A game
If you hating then you should be ashamed cause a haters just a lame looking for someone to blame
Ayo I came from the bottom I ain't have shit
Not even a fucking mattress
Sleeping on the couch at my aunt house
If section 8 found out every-fucking-body getting kicked out
Word up and that's real shit
Something that I really had to deal with
My pride made me hide and conceal it
Stressed out
Got me ready to kill shit
Thoughts on my mind
Notepad full of rhymes
But not a motherfucking dime for some studio time
The life of a nigga unsigned
The devil made some offers but I always declined
Ayo I'm just freeing my mind
Taking my time got me feeling like I'm falling behind
I know the only way to be great is stay on your grind
But damn how long is this line?
Please show me a sign
This recession got a motherfucking stressing
I know it's all part of life lessons
Like everybody else I had some questions
But my faith is so strong it kept me from second guessing
These niggas tryna' block my blessings but every second that I don't shine I spend perfecting
I know what I want and I ain't settling ot budging
Cause this time around it's all or nuthin'[Verse: David Stones]

We get bread
Bust heads
Nigga, 'nuff said
Find me in the hood skiing in a bobsled
And that thing kitted up so it turn heads
With a bad chick
And she got Nicki Minaj legs
Black YSL scopes
With the matching loafs
Niggas doing bus trips
While we doing boats
Niggas spittin' punchlines
While I'm spittin' quotes
And I live by the code cause I took the oath
Fuck around with ST that be suicide
What you tryna' do doggie it's just you and I
Better make your move quick cause it's do or die
But you better make that move count or be brutalized
When I step up on stage they electrified
Except them niggas talkin' tough they be petrified
How you want it baby boy
You better step aside
Cause my aim mean, 16 right between the eyes
While I'm screaming fuck the other side
I'm that guy!

[Hook: David Stones]

Fuck you bitch I'm the shit!
Fuck you bitch I'm the shit!

[Verse 2: David Stones]

Everywhere I go I shit sought of like a poodle
Overseas motherfuckers call me Yankee Doodoo
What I'm doing to this game
Some'll call it brutal
And some call it OD'n
I say what's it to you?
Shorty on her android searching me on google
I told her don't watch me trick watch Hulu
I'm a young pretty nigga but don't let it fool you
I keep a ox in the sock
I will sock it to you
My shit dope and I'm realer then most
When the beef pop man these niggas is ghost
When the beef pop we turn that shit in to roast
When the heat pop I got you dead in my scopes
You fall like sheet rock when demolition approach
For niggas tryna' run they stop runnin' and float
I show these motherfuckers no mercy at most
I'll kill you lyrically so physically you're here when I boast
My shit potent like dope (like dope!)
And I quote

[Hook: David Stones]

[Verse 3: David Stones]

MSG, SOB's or the fucking block
Guarantee ST give it all he got
Man it's cool you ain't even gotta past the rock
I'm coach man from the bench I be calling shot's
That bass knock motherfuckers bout to call the cops
And I'm warning motherfuckers it's a warning shot
You can't stop the show
Just prolong the plot but the show goes on prolonged or not
Hitmaker room shaker
Stones on his J.O. (they know)
I'm the bread maker
You's a faker
Disguised hater
I'll turn a made man in to a fast food order taker
When I'm in Toronto I rock the blue Jays
They call me S dot T dot
No relation to Jay
These niggas taking days off
No vacational pay
I'm shitting on these dudes in a inspirational way
(Aye)
My yardie niggas tell 'em gweh
What ya' say?

[Hook: David Stones][Verse 1: David Stones]

Aye girl
I see you 'round the way girl
Bangin' ass body like okay girl
Every time you smile it just brightens up my day girl
Always so busy when you gon' stop and play girl
I see you when you pass through
You look at me, I look at you
The whole neighborhood tryna bag you
You wanna tell 'em shut the fuck up when they harass you but you tactful cause you got too much tact to
You ain't like them other chicks
You be on that - You be on that other shit
Got me on that, "Yo, I think I love her" shit
You the type of chick that I go and see my mother with
Put the pimp-card down baby-girl and call it quits
Stay fly, being broke-down ain't a option
Shoe game mean with the dress that you rockin'
Love the way you look in your stockings
Damn girl you poppin'
You workin' it and you ain't even clocked in

[Hook: Mark Jonas]

Every time I pass you
I just wanna get at you
That's why I got my eyes lookin' at you
So if you'll have me
Like I'll have you then I'm gon' ride
No lie
I might have to

[Verse 2: David Stones]

I love the way you carry yourself
Independent chick you ain't asking for help
You ain't diggin' for wealth
You in love with yourself
So you'll never sell your soul for the money and gold
And your name don't pop up in the stories that told
Cause you never be around when the drama unfold
Every time you walk by I just stop and behold
I'm usually composed
You got a nigga losing control
Eyes off the road
I'm swervin'
Thinkin' bout splurgin'
Wanna put you in the crib where the rugs persian
We could eat out or the dinner could be served
Sippin' fine wine while the rest sippin' bourbon
Anything you need it's a wrap like a turbon
We could just shit on the world no curvin'
You been hurt before so the thoughts still disturbing
I know you not sure but it's one thing for certain

[Hook: Mark Jonas]

[Verse 3: David Stones]

Baby what's up
Let's keep in touch
I don't know if you noticed this but
I like you much
I wanna get to know you and show you how a real man supposed to hold and console you
I'll never try to mold or control you
That's something that I won't do
Your beauty so priceless that it feels like I owe you
So I'll pay my debt with respect
Flowers on your door-step delivered by a quartet
I'm a sure bet
Baby won't you place it on me
I'm everything you need
Don't go getting basic on me and you won't believe just how real my feelings are
You are star boo I see you shining from afar
Your whole style and your mind frame is up to par
You ain't the type to be impressed by a fancy car
They're looking for themselves
You know exactly who you are
How bout we grab a mean, just chill and gaze at the stars

[Hook: Mark Jonas]

[Outro: Mark Jonas]

Every time I pass you I just wanna get at you
I'll make you feel so good
On top of that I'm so nice
And plus you're lookin' so right
And I, wanna know your name so you can get to know my game
But until I ask you it's just every time I pass you I just wanna get at youIntro

Who would've thought when we was young
This what we'd become
I remember when we didn't even know that we was from the slums
We was having fun
Rain, Sleet, Hail, or Sun

Chorus

I'm a get it
I'm a get it
Just watch me I'm a get it
I'm a get it

Just watch me I'm a get it
I'm a get it
I'm a get it
Just watch me I'm a get it

Fuck you if you ain't with it
(Repeat 1x)

Verse 1

This is for my niggas that be swiping that ain't even got a license
But be whipping in them foreigns getting cake with all the icing
For my niggas that was bummy
Now they getting to the money
For them hunnies with degrees who ain't fucking with no dummies
For my niggas bout that action
All they know is make it happen
They ain't really with the yapping
Get too loud and they start clapping
Look I want the whole pie
I ain't in it for no fraction
Boy I need that money stacking
Why the fuck you think I'm rapping

Chorus

Verse 2

This is for my niggas on a mission
Tryin not to rot in prison
For the homies that be whippin bricks up in they momma kitchen
For them hunnies that be strippin just to pay off their tuition
For my people up in college tryna bring to life their vision
I'm a get it for my family
I'm a get it for my niggas
I'm a front on every single bitch that ever tried to diss us
I'm a run down on them no that be acting like they run it
Hit the club and throw some hundreds
I'm a spend it like I won it

Chorus

Verse 3

Who would've thought when we was young
This what we'd become
I remember when we didn't even know that we was from the slums
We was having fun
Rain, Sleet, Hail, or Sun
And the furthest that we thought ahead was "I don't wanna go to bed"
Nowadays the only thing that's on a nigga mind is bread
I gotta get this bread
I gotta get this bread
Fuck what haters said

Chorus[Verse 1: David Stones]

When Stones drop a tune boy your spotlight doomed
That boy Ex make the bass go "Boom"
There's not a safe place in the room
Watch that Benz turn into a spaceship (vroom!)
I'm a light year from where they call Cancun
I'll be back somewhere around earth time, noon
Not a second late or too soon
You dealing with a real tycoon
I, overflow on the track like typhoons
Fuck your little train of thought
My freight needs room
When met face-to-face with my platoon
The simple minded run
While the educated swoon
I seen shorty clear across the room
Now she so damn close I could taste he perfume
Me amor in that Dior I adore
Said she love it when I rhyme for a cause (cause)
Fuck a punchline I dabble in philoshphies like Socrates
They do it but they do it so sloppily
Me on the other hand I do it properly
I'm a freight train in the bike line
There's no stopping me
I paid the toll and traveled down this road before
You want?
Bring it on
They can't fuck with me!
We live at the Ramada like!

[Hook: David Stones]

We live at the Ramada!
(We live at the Ramada)
We got the telly poppin' like
(We got the telly poppin' like)
We live at the Ramada!
(We live at the Ramada)

[Verse 2: David Stones]

Don dada
It's none hotter
OT late night at the Ramada
See shorty lickin' her lips dipped in Escada
Her bff doin' the Prada
She whispered that she wanted me inside her
And she like to climb on top
She's a rider
Damn boo, you hot like lava
And I could tell that pussy wet like agua
She said her best fried wanna jump in
Well, shit baby girl go 'head jump then
We could get this whole thing jumpin'
Do it 'til the box spring slumped in
Now is you gonna back it up or you frontin?
That's when she showed me something
(Y'all done got me started now)
We got the telly poppin' like! (2x)
We live at the Ramada
We got the telly poppin' like
We live at the Ramada[Verse: David Stones]

I could tell them sexy ass lips is good for more than just talk
And I could tell that kitty good by the way that she walk
She know I'm cut from a whole different cloth
From the County of Kings
Where they breed Kings of New York
I met shorty OT at a weekend resort
It was hotter than a bitch so she was rocking some shorts
With some converses so we started conversing
Told me that she came to kick back and do some soul searching
I could dig that
Shorty ass fat
Nice rack
Asked her out to eat she said she'd like that
Later on scooped her in the V
You know, all black
Cleaned up nice damn, baby girl you all that
She fly in some heels or some kicks with a snapback
Paparazi on her heels fiending just to snap that
I can't stop staring at those curvy ass hips
And lord the way she licking those lips
Oh, shit
She wanna hop in the ride
Throw on some tunes and enjoy the good vibes
She tired of lies and lame guys that think that they live
That's why I got her mesmerized when I look iin her eyes she reply
"You the man baby"
Me and my whole team get it in and we roll deeper than the fucking navy
Them hoes ain't got a clue
Try to play me I force 'em to call audibles
My ex-chick thought she had me where she wanted me
Shit
Where I'm at is where I wanna be
Bitch
But real spit you the one I'm tryna' deal with
Fine as fuck plus somebody I could deal with
She saw what's in my cup and she asked me "what's that?"
I let her take a sip now she don't know how to act
Shorty staring in my eyes while she grinding on my lap
Then she threw that thing back and made it clap
Oh, snap
Was it something I said that got these haters hating when they should be grinding instead?
You kow you got 'em mentally scared when they debating on whether you be shining too hard
I'm on some lowkey shit with a bad ass chick in the spot
Moonlight ricocheting off the watch
Yea I had a couple shots and uh
Nevermind, I forgot[Intro: David Stones]

Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye
Tryna' play with it a li' bit
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye

[Verse 1: David Stones]

She do it like she dancing in a video
Her body move to vibrations from the stereo
Swing them hips around like a merry go
Touch her toes then she dip it low and she hit the floor
Shorty got flavor
She know the difference from a baller and a nigga that done saved up
But ain't looking for nobody that can save her
She just wanna shake what her momma gave her
Pretty as toes and her manicure right
Not a worry in sight
She could party all night
Her friends are all hype
They wildin' by the bar going hard
Gon' wake up and do it all tomorrow
Shit
Baby in my eyes you a star
Cause on the dance floor I could see you from afar
They call me VVS Stones like what's in the Audemar
But enough about me I'm tryna' find out who you are

[Hook: David Stones]

Shorty got me watching how she grooving to the music
The way her body poppin' man I don't know how she do it
But she do it
Do it
Yea she do it how she do it
She do it how she do it
When she do it
She do it
She do it
She do it
She do it
She do it
She do it
She do it
I don't know how she do it
Do it
But she do it how she do it
She do it how she do it
When she do it

[Verse 2: David Stones]

Shorty got them fellas in the club tryna' find a clue
I walked up on her like damn boo how fine are you?
Come here boo I like your little hair-do
Them other girls naw they shouldn't stand near you
Shorty body bangin' from the front and the rear too
Turn around baby girl let me get a clear view
Said she tired of them lames
Yea I hear you
Show 'em how to get fly when I bring the leer through
Nice shape and thin waste
They gon' hate
And she stay on that new shit they so late
Tattoos and piercings in the right place
Lames all up in her face give her no space
Shorty in my eyes you a star
On the dance floor I could see you from afar
Naw I don't just cop a bottle boo I buy the whole bar
But enough about me I'm tryna find out who you are

[Hook: David Stones]

[Verse 3: David Stones]

She do it while sh doing them Giuseppe heels
Her body could kill it's deadly like her sex appeal
I ain't saying she a gold-digger but for real
She only fuck with niggas that be getting skrill
She know ST got the mass appeal and I go harder than a nigga with a major deal
Independent nigga with a major feel
Keep it poppin' like some pills
Hold up
I see some blazing Caucasian
Latina sensation
Black mixed with Asian
What a combination
So many bad bitches it's amazing
But baby you the only one I'm chasing
Cause shorty in my eyes you a star
On the dance floor I could see you from afar
Yea I'm a BK nigga and I push a fast car
But enough about me I'm tryna' find out who you are

[Hook: David Stones][Verse 1: David Stones]

I hopped out with that system thumpin
Get this party jumpin I be stuntin on these mothafuckas They ain't saying nothing
I see them niggas that be muggin
But them boys be fronting man we really thuggin they ain't hurtin nothing
I just looked at shorty like whatever
We should get together
Fuck them dudes you need somebody with some cheddar
Said she been waiting on forever to hop up in that 745 and give it to me on the leather
Then she got a look at my baretta
One in the head she never bust one off she asked my if I'd let her
Baby I could do one better
Why don't you just throw this in your pocketbook it's lighter than a feather
Cause I be waiting on someone to dumb out
So I could pull that drum out
Bust one off and then watch everybody run out
But that ain't even all that I'm bout
When I'm in the club all them ballers and them bad girls come out Cause

[Hook]

You could hear that system bumping for you see me coming
I be stunting on these motherfuckers
They ain't saying nothing
Niggas run and tuck they woman when they see me coming I be stunting man these dudes ain't saying nothing

[Verse 2: David Stones]

Shorty told me Stones you be that nigga
That's why them dudes be hating so just keep your finger on the trigga
Everybodies fucking with ya
Every girl up in my city up on they wall they got your picture
I replied to shorty that's what's up and we should stay in touch
I like you much and shorty I ain't even bluffing
Then from there we started touching
After that I took her back to the hotel and we started fucking
You should see the way my niggas rush in
Hop up on stage we got them niggas wilding all them girls be dumbing
Ayo that ain't even nothing cause when we out of town shit be getting so crazy we bring them guns in
Cause I be waiting on someone to dumb out so I could pull that drum out
Bust one off and then watch everybody run out
But that ain't even all that I'm bout
When I'm in the club all them ballers and them bad girls come out

[Hook][Verse: David Stones]

I could take you on a trip where they cooking that potent shit
I saw a fiend who caught a whiff start dancing and do a split
In the other room a base head took a hit
Your man whole body shifted on some 3:30 shit
Man it's hot summertime got me stressing
When you ain't got no money sunny days are depressing
But I'm still here so it's a blessing
I'm guessing I', destined for some sort of perfection
Cause when you from the slums and you live to 21 you survived
The next milestone is 25
I know this shorty and she got a good soul
Trying no to loose control and let them demons take a hold
She said: "ST please don't let the fame consume ya' and all the silly rumors ruin your sense of humor"
So I joked with her
It shocked me that she dropped that jewel on me cause I viewed her as a little sister
I want her to excel
Cause her pops in a box
Her brother got locked
She need influence from a male
That ain't tryna' get between her legs
She stay 2 steps ahead cause she know just how to spot the ledge
I made the lil' homies take a pledge that they won't do nothing stupid that'll land 'em in the fads
And I'm a show 'em how to get this legal bread
Make your own decisions
Fuck the bullshit that Simon says

[Verse 2: David Stones]

A lot of brothers sinning out of greed
Some do it to stay afloat
Some because they don't believe
Until they feel them hell fires then they start to plead
But it's too late cause they knee-deep in evil deeds
Ayo I'm tryna' match the life that I lead with the life I believe
Yea it's a difficult task indeed
But nowadays I'm more concerned with purifying my spiritual
Instead of stereotypical shit they say that niggas do
Nowadays I'm more concerned with purifying my spiritual
Instead of stereotypical shit they say that niggas do

[Outro: Louis CK Skit][Hook]

S.t. is the truth!
S.t. is the truth!
S.t. is the truth!
S.t. is the truth!
S.t. is the truth!
S.t. is the truth!
S.t. is the truth!
The illest nigga you know!

[Verse 1: David Stones]

I'm comfortable with being myself
These niggas acting like they somebody else
Look, we had it with your fantasy rap
Talking bout you could've did this and would've did that
I think it's bout time we bring reality back cause in reality the fact is your shit is just wack
Matter of fact your whole career is a joke
And shame on them yes men you got giving you hope
They call me VVS Stones in some VVS Stones
Well known, my name ring like them PBS phonesAnd I'm waking niggas out of their slumber this summer
Don't even bother to call
I got your number
Try to get up in my lane if you dare
If I catch you over here you best to be waving a road flair
I don't play fair you don't want me to demonstrate it
Or insert name here, I could dedicate it
Put your career in the trash like I'm sanitation
Say hello to the future nigga, salutations
I could hear their hearts palpatating
While these niggas hating
I'll be living off the land steady cooking up a plan to tip the scales
Strategize while demons rise to no avail
Got God on my side he know me well
I was taught to talk in code it's too risky on them cells
Son they hanging brothas in them jails
Judge hitting niggas with them 7-figure bails
Farewell letters through the mail
Will he ever walk the streets again?
Time will tell
These niggas filling every bar up with punchlines while I use mine to uplift in these hard times
This ain't just words rhyming in the booth
This right here is significant proof that S.t. is the truth!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: David Stones]

They impressed with my intellect and view me as a threat cause my respect can't be paid in the form of a check
I perform in rare form I was blessed with a gift to put my foot up on these motherfuckas neckI grind in the night while you slept
Kept running shit while you were running out of breath
I hear these niggas saying they the best then you play the mixtape and that shit is a hot- mess
A lot represent it but only a small percent is documented
The rest get x'd off the list cause they ain't authentic
Yea I'm independent but the bars is hard enough to lock 'em in it so them history books they better log us in it
This a victory commercially and critically
Fuck whoever hating let 'em wallow in their misery
I'm everything they wish to be, literally
And if they ain't feeling me it must be something wrong with 'em physically
In my eyes it's no such thing as competitors cause they're all prey and I'm the mothafuckin' predator
Wildin on the regular, S to the...
You could never walk in my shoes cause I'm 10 steps ahead of ya
They'll never be another emcee as dope as me
VVS Stones, put me on I give you clarityThis ain't just words rhyming in the booth
This right here is significant proof that S.t. is the truth!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: David Stones]

Ayo I flow so fluidly I should tax my CD's with a water fee
Opposing S.t. your chance of victory are very slim
I come baring bars, I'm a fuckn barbarian
They like ahhh damn, not him again
That nigga Buckshot lil cousin fuckn' goin inChivalry ain't dead I catered to a few women friend but these niggas is bringing new meaning to gentlemen
They sucker soft
Prolly walk up in a A&R office, close the door and go and suck 'em off
Niggas cop my shit and start trashing the store
Then their nose start to bleed cause that shit is so raw
Quick question for you overnight sensations
What's your lyrical equation when brought up in conversations?
Or do you lack a nomination?
Don't even give a fuck about the culture you're disgracing[Into: David Stones]

Y'all niggas need to get hip to this DOHH Squad shit
District Of Honor & Humility
District Of Heavy Hustlers
District Of Hip Hop
DOHH Nation
Peace to the Gods & Earths
Peace to Wu Tang
Big Baby Jesus told y'all niggas Wu-Tangs forever
RIP ODB
Peace to the DOHH Nation

[Verse: David Stones]

I be the legend before the legacy
S to the fucking T
Luckily I mastered the art of living sucker free
Who stopping me?
Rain on your whole fucking monopoly
Breathe of fresh air breaking up all the monotony
Go 'head with all that pretend shit
We bear no resemblance
Horrendous
Just pray for you these bars are not intended
One line will whipe a rapper from attendance
My pen(n)'s dangerous
Nigga you could get sentenced
You ain't fooling me with your lies and tom-foolery
Acting like we cool tryna cover up the scrutiny
Smiling in my face cause you see a oppurtunity but if you had a chance you'll be the first to try to ruin me
Fuck that look at all these snake niggas laid back
Guess that they relaxed cause they thought they covered their tracks but naw son peep the ill shit I'm on your heels bitch
We read lips and body language 'til they reveal shit
Truthfully I ain't the one you got to deal with
I roll with a click that's on some murder murder kill shit
Banana clip spilling out the steel shit
All them niggas know is straight ignorance and real shit
I'm a boss so I keep my hands clean
But please believe I got some shooters on the team
With them fully loaded nickle plated pistols homie if you got a issue it'll whistle when it hit you blood'll trickle
My BK team so official
My brownsville niggas load the van and come and get you
If you chillin' with your mans he going with you cause I don't play no games
Not just even just a little
Not even just a giggle
I'm not playing go against the grain and niggas better start praying
Shots spraying
Man laying
Decaying broad day in BK
My 'rican mans cut with both hands like they DJ'n
Bitch I'm a get it poppin' like I'm supposed to
All I need is the beat the mic and the pro-tools
And my dude Sha to mix the vocals
Send the mp3 overseas now we global
The name Stones cause I'm known to drop a few jewels and on top of that put me anywhere I shine through
Oh, it's a acronym too
Simply The One Niggas Envy is who?
(Stones)
S.T. Bitch try to temp me
My nine work just fine I squeeze 'til it's empty
Dweebs gon' resent me for these rhymes of the century
I would smack 'em up but that'll be elementary
My presence strikes fear evidently
I'm all up in the motherfucking house like it's rent free
What the fuck you motherfuckers gon' do as the saga continues
DOHH Squad![Verse 1: David Stones]

Niggas running around talking bout they're keeping it real but for the right deal they'll spill what the gangsters conceal
Shout out to all the gangsters for real who know that shit is much deeper than just busting your steal
Shout out to all the thots who be thotting tho
Acting like you low
Bitch we all know that you a ho
Bitch we all know that you gon blow
Bitch we all know that you gon (oh!)
These bitches ain't loyal
These bitches is spoiled
When you getting chips the only time these bitches adore you
I tell a thirsty ho drink some tap water that's boiled
Other than some hard dick I ain't got nothing for you
Niggas fucking up the game treating these hoes like they royal
Yea I shine hard
And I grind hard
General of DOHH Squad
We the black mob
Bitch we go hard up against all odds
I keep a bad bitch with some sexy appeal
And her ass fat looking like she came from Brazil
Pretty brown eyes
Nice lips
Sexy in heels
Could make the average nigga chill but I'm playing the field
Don't make me come and kick in the doors of you and yours nigga
Waving the 4 like everyone get on the floor
Ride with niggas with some murderous ties
Who could've did life inside but alibies proved otherwise
And naw that ain't to glorify
That's just for niggas with some untrained eyes who fail to recognize
Respect it or check it
Go ahead be my guess and try
Be a dick head fuck around and get circumcised
I'm almost certain that half of these niggas wear disguise
Acting like they're tough guys but really sweet as pie
We break 'em down to size
We all gotta die but don't let stupidity be the reason why
I haven't ever killed a man and I pray I don't
But That Don't necessarily mean that I won't
Bang bang Brooklyn gang
Niggas on that bullshit
My minds a weapon but sometimes I alternate with four-fifths
Full clips
Old school
Tucked in the Woolrich
What up nigga
Talk tough but go to war
Nah they wouldn't dare
They know I'm rare
They don't really wanna take it there
I know some niggas that'll run up on your whip with the fifth while you chilling with your bitch
Pump shots in your motherfucking fave
Even though the ho escape  bet she still. have the shakes cause she felt it like the bass
I know some niggas that'll run up in your crib where you live
While you laying in the bed
Put a motherfucking bullet in your head but I'm trying to be a cool cat
It Aina fair that you bout to make me do that
Niggas looking like who that
Until I back the four-fifth out and make 'em move back
Bust a nigga head when the steel spit
Now that went 0 to 100 nigga real quick
0 to 100 nigga real quick
Real shit
Bust a nigga head when the steel spit
0 to 100 nigga real quick
Real shit
Fuck a nigga bitch on some real shit
Hold up who these niggas tryna stop vision
Being the opposition is a bad decision
I don't consider you my competition
Talking bout you shitting you don't even got a pot to piss in
Nigga listen
I been grinding for a long time
That 9 to 5 got me thinking I should grab the nine
Hit a lick word to mother on some real shit it could go from 0 to 100 nigga real quick
These bitches ain't loyal
These bitches is spoiled
When you getting chips the only time these bitches adore you
I tell a thirsty ho drink some tap water that's boiled
Other than some hard dick I ain't got nothing for you
My first mixtape the song was called everybody's waiting but in reality there was zero anticipation
They could be hating or maybe I ain't good enough
Who am I kidding mos these rap niggas fucking suck
People that I trusted threw me under buses
Don't know who I should fuck with everyone's corrupted shit got me disgusted I can't even discuss it before I got the gold watch encrusted
Niggas try to play me
Bitches tried to play me
Who the fuck is these false profits tryna save me
They must think I'm crazy and Momma didn't raise me
Yea I know what time it is and I don't need no AP
Tryna make it to the top but I'm in the same spot can't dodge the rain drops
When will the pain stop
My man said up what's the next move bro
Shit I don't even know
They say on the bottom the only way to go is up
I'll fuck around and go even further down with my luck
I gotta get my shit together for the times up
I think I lost myself I need a reminder
Niggas was my homies
Now they moving phony
They act like they don't know me
Man that shit so corny
And plus my tenderonni done up and left me lonely
Damn I could've swore she was my only
Thought she was a rider
Instead she just a low down caniver
Bitch was sucking dick on the side bruh
But I ain't gon lie tho
I smashed a few chicks on the side too
I'm chasing dreams that I pray one day I'll catch up toChorus :
Everybody talking bout the cars and the chains
How they tryna make a name, but on the block they remain
Cause they don’t know about the grind and the pain
Or the time and the strain that’s involved in the game
(Repeat 1x)
1st Verse :
I started on the grind with a vision in mind
No co-sign, front line, me and my rhymes
While they were waiting for directions I was reading the signs
Going for mine cause them haters try to leave you behind
Fuck a lack of wealth I just tighten my belt
Before I ask for help I invest in myself
Cause very few give a fuck about your dreams
And that’s real talk homie better get it through your bean
Although as fucked up as it seems
You got people that’ll talk behind your back on your team
They say they got hope but really think you a joke
Criticize you for sacrificing laughing saying you broke
While they letting that go you letting that money grow, but they don’t know cause that return come back kinda slow
So, lord help ‘em when that money start to flow cause now their the butt of the joke for every show
So, never give up cause that’s a whole lot to part with
You made it too far not to finish what you started
Just keep your eye on the target
Even if it means that you gotta take a side job at Target
He who laugh last laughs hardest
Today a starving artist
Tomorrow you’ll be number 1 charted
And even if you’re not number 1 on the chart list at least you still showed where your heart is, regardless
Bridge :
Wait, hold-up, hold-up
You niggas gon’ really act like y’all don’t see us out here doing this shit nigga?
We in the motherfucking Ville right now
The belly of the beast
You niggas is clowns
You niggas is fake
You niggas don’t do this shit from the heart nigga
This shit is where the motherfucking strong survive
Never ran, never will nigga
We don’t need no motherfucking validation nigga
We here to stay
[Chorus]
2nd Verse :
Everybody got a opinion when it comes to your life
Some say that you living it wrong and they can tell what’s right
Try to say that you’re delerious and caught in the hype
Blinded by lights so it must be something wrong with your sights
Cause, can’t you see that you’re dreaming too big?
Just face reality and get a real gig
Look kid you will never make it big don’t be stupid
If it was that easy wouldn’t everybody do it?
But everybody’s not you
When they tell you what you can’t do that’s not true they just tryna block you
Never let ‘em stop you
You’re heading straight to the top to claim your spot no longer can they knock you
If your actions are driven by your passions
That’s the quickest way to satisfaction
Eliminate distraction
And make sure every move you do can trigger positive reactions
Get ready to cash-in
A lot of party crashing and fashion
Camera lens flashing
They gon’ try to drag your name through the trash bin
But that’s only cause they see you mashing
If you believe in you then what else matters?
Never fall victim to the chitter-chatter
You already gone
But most do see the small steps ‘til the day they’re getting stepped on
[Chorus]
Outro :
Everybody talking bout that
Talking bout this
They don’t know about shit
Everybody talking bout this
Talking bout that
They don’t know about shit
Everybody talking bout that
Talking bout this
They don’t know about shit
Everybody talking bout this
Talking bout that
They don’t know about shit[Verse 1: David Stones]

I paint pictures with my lines
Write scriptures in my rhymes
I shine-baby-shine this young nigga in his prime
It was written that I'm ahead of my time
But it was also written I would never be signed
Niggas always got a opinion with no facts
So judgmental, cut a nigga no slack
But oh-snap now a nigga on wax
Worldwide I tell all them haters hold that
I grind-baby-grind to get my name on the map
Put in overtime tryna' clime me a plaque
It's been a wrap since I came through the door
I left all them lame niggas laying on the floor
I claimed fame and got 'em running to the store
Cause I'm not only a rapper
I'm much more
Dogs
But of course I'm a boss so I floss
This young show off'll show off in his Porsche

[Hook]

I shine baby shine
Grind baby grind
I get's mine and I'm still in my prime
Don't worry bout me homie I'm a be fine
Cause I grind baby grind
Grind baby grind
(Repeat 1x)

[Verse 2: David Stones]

I could tell you niggas tryna' disguise your green eyes
I wondered why you wore shades now I see why
Cause I shine baby shine
And I shine so bright it'll leave a motherfucker blind
I could tell that it's fuckin' with your mind
He just came in the game and homie on his grind
They already wanna put me in a shrine
But in due time 'til then I'm first in line
These niggas say I get too much credit
But I really earned it so it's more like a debit
Dead it
All that tough shit forget it
But if you really want it my nigga then we could set it
Cause I ain't pussy don't push me I'll bust the fifth
But I much rather make hits and have 'em bang my shit
These niggas kill for the thrill
If I kill it's to chill
Cause with beef it's no peace and that's real

[Hook]

[Verse 3: David Stones]

I keep perfecting my profession cause it is what it is
And let my rhymes manifest 'til I'm the best in the biz
Ask a real lyricist he know what it is
And all my hood niggas check for the kid
But let me tell you little something bout this fame shit
You'll be here today then tomorrow you'll be nameless
You could set it up where you'll remain rich
Or you could leave with the same shit that you came with
Man this whole lifestyle is dangerous
Never knowing if you coming or going and anxious
To know what's next cause success is a half of step away
Failure is even less
Look at yourself in the mirror you're a mess
Everyday is like a motherfucking contest
But nevertheless I progress
Cause I ain't satisfied with success I'm obsessed

[Hook][Verse: David Stones]

You might be dope but you ain't no fucking king of New York
You bout to learn it's certain lines you don't cross
Don't think we soft cause Rocky ain't say shit
Although he got his name spit
I guess it take some BK niggas to come and slay shit
They tried to box me out of the game to keep it basic
Cause they know ST ain't nothing to play with
I spit like a fuckin A-R
This a lead shower
His own fans like damn that's some high power (hiiipower)
They say Stones you don't want it with Black Hippy
Them boys got bars
That's a buck-fifty
But I don't give a fuck
All them dudes could team up and come get me
I'm still rep for my city
Cause look I ain't playing fair
I ain't never scared
When I spit it's like a fifth with 16 in there
I ain't playing fair
I ain't never scared
When I spit it's like a fifth with 16 in there
And I bet I got some shit to knock Kenny out of his skippies
Jay Rock'll have to go get a new pair of Dickies
Schoolboy Q'll fall back without his bucket hat
Ab-Soul'll take off his black shades like what was that
Who the first to step up to get played and be a footnote on my Wikipedia page
I'll set the whole record label ablaze and put your Keebler elf in the face looking ass back in the cage
You ain't on top dowg just cause you on Top Dawg
So stop dog
Running 'round talking bout crowns that's not yours
You the hottest in the game by default
They need to let some more superstars play on that court
That nigga A$AP got bars too but it's a pity that he too bizzy tryna to be more pretty than Nicki
I'm the new Prince of New Yitty
That king shit that's between Jay, Nas, and Fifty, and Diddy
It's DOHH squad niggas best get with me
Or feel pain when I rain and that's word to Biggie
I was taught this a competitive sport and you could never let nobody feel at home on your court
I hope you don't think I'm mi-dad
That rhyme you spit it made me li-daff
But say that shit again and that's your id-ass
Don't feel the wri-dath
You other niggas better step your bars up and stop hiding behind your ci-dash
Don't get confronted
(Uh)
This my Jay Z flow tell me who want it
(Uh)
Niggas don't want it
I got 'em sick to they stomach
(Uh)
Cause this the hardest shit you heard thus far
Keep it a-hunned[Hook]

They love it
They need it and we made it so far they can't believe it
Critics said that we won't ever achieve it
So I guess their expectations we exceeded
We does it, So rugged
But somehow get accepted by the public
Get rejected then connected on some bugged shit
The same reason why they hate is why I love it
(Yeah) Why they hate is why I love it
The same reason why they hate is why I love it
(Yeah) Why they hate is why I love it
The same reason why they hate is why I love it
(Yeah) Why they hate is why I love it
The same reason why they hate is why I love it
(Yeah) Why they hate is why I love it
I love it, I love it

[Verse 1: David Stones]

This is for my niggas in the trap with the gacs moving g-packs
This more than rap matter of fact even more than that
This for them honey's in the hood tryna get away
Hustlin' everyday just to make a little pay
I feel your pain times changed It's a cryin shame
That our brothas and sisters are strugglin' just to maintain
That's why I vowed to get in this game to make a change cause if it was u u would want the fuckn' same
I never understood how they throw us to the wolves
Like they don't see the shit we lack in the hood
Ain't shit but scraps and some shacks in the hood
So how they gon' judge the way we act in the hood
They think the only thing we do is slack in the hood
Chillin' all day sippin yach in the hood
Buying backwoods and dime sacks in the hood
Fuck that!
Yo that's why I spit facts for the hood cause

[Hook 1x]

[Verse 2: David Stones]

This is for my people in the fast lane tryna live the fast life
Finding out that they didn't read the map right
Now they on the same exact road as last night
Lookin' for a flashlight falling victim to the hype
Hindsight is 20/20 but a better view is when you stop to look at what's right ahead of you
Most the time what you needs not what you wanna do
That's why it's good to know the differences between the 2
Open up your eyes and get wise to the truth
You could make a lot of money rhymin' in the booth
And you could make a lot of money ballin' shooting hoops
But if u free your mind your potentials through the roof
In the hood success doesn't leave a lot of proof so we stick to what we know cause we gotta get the loot
But "all money ain't good money's" the truth
That's why I do it for my people strugglin' and the youth cause

[Hook 1x]
