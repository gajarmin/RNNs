[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe[Produced by Passion Pit, Benny Blanco and Cashmere Cat]

[Intro]
Watch it, watch it
Watch it, watch it

[Verse 1]
Lost in the cracks of the landslide
You saw me slipping on my blind side
I'm feeling lost, feeling tongue-tied
And now I'm frozen in your headlights

[Verse 2]
Deep in the haze of your love high
I used to soar on the live wire
I'm coming down from your supply
And I don't know if you can make right

[Chorus]
I can't take it
From the day I saw
My heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you baby
Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw
My heart start breaking
No one saved me

[Verse 3]
Shot through the cracks of the earthquake
My body's moving into retrograde
I'm feeling loose, feeling untamed
And you're the dynamite in my chains

[Verse 4]
Deep in the trench of the crossfire
You shot me down from the live wire
Tossed to the loss in your love game
You beat me cheating and now I can't play

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hit the ground running up from you
Baby, you know I don't want to, no, I want you
But there's nothing left to say
Lost in the riddle you gave me
Caught in the middle, you played me
I see so plainly, but there's nothing left to say
I should have known, I should have known
Known, no, no-no-no-no...

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
(Ahh, all around)
(Ahh, all around)

[Outro]
Watch it, watch it
Watch it, watch it[Intro/Bridge]
Work hard, play hard (x4)
Work (x8)

[Verse 1]
Diamonds all on my ring nigga
Gold watches, gold chain nigga
Hundred thou' on champagne nigga
Yeah my money insane nigga
Yeah I'm making it rain nigga
But I was just on the plane nigga
Buying gear, flying here
Fuck what you heard, it’s my time of year
If I'm in the club, I get a hundred stacks
I'm always rolling up so I get love for that
Them niggas stole my swag but I don't want it back
My nigga uh! I was on this, but now I'm onto that
You see it in my closet before it's on the rack
Was out there in Hawaii, now I'm goin back
My nigga uh! I got so much money I should start a bank
So much paper right in front of me it's hard to think
Buy so many bottles it's gon' be hard to drink
But I'm still pourin' up and my family here and they rolling up so uh!

[Hook (x2)]
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
The quicker you here, the faster you go
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Hop your pretty ass up in this fucking car
Bitch I'm out this world, girl you know I'm a star
Used to buying rounds but now we buy the bar
Last year they had to ask now they know who we are
Boss shit, walk in the building, I own shit
You can tell by who I'm on the phone with
Yeah nigga talking about grown shit
Niggas too busy jacking my swag
Need to fuck around, get your own shit
Get your own cars, get your own clothes
Get your own smoke, get your own bitch
You ain't reppin' my gang, get your own clique

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Go hard
Make sure you do whatever is that you gotta do, that's your job
And niggas gon' hate but that's no prob'
So hey fuck 'em don't need nothing from 'em
Some niggas talking but the shit they claiming don't mean nothing
It's straight from Cali, that's what's in my joint that's what I'm puffin', OG
And been one since I was young enough to know that everybody was gonna know me
Most niggas don't see

[Hook][Verse 1]
I danced in the desert, in the pouring rain
Drank with the devil and forgot my name
Woke with somebody when the morning came
No one there to shame me for my youth
Cause I wouldn't be with you

[Verse 2]
And then I found me a lover who could play the bass
He's kinda quiet, but his body ain't
Spend the days dreaming and the nights awake
Doin' things we know we shouldn't do
Cause I wouldn't be with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Says he can't believe he found me
Wraps his arms around me
Yeah-eah, eah-eah-eah-yeah

[Chorus]
I can't let him in
You call me up and ask me how I've been
I'll call your bluff and
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
No, I can't let them in
You play me rough, but I won't let you win
So, call my bluff, I'll
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
Keep on telling you lies

[Post-Chorus]
Count down to the day they may come true

[Verse 3]
And I fell for a vagabond, a month at tops
Lied and said his bike was in the "motor shop"
Drove my car once and made the tire pop
Still we had some fun, till I came to
Cause I wouldn't be with you

[Verse 4]
On the Fourth of July, I met a man, "Pierre"
Lied about his age, but I didn't care
Spoke in broken English but the heart was there
In those eyes of sky and ocean blue
Cause I wouldn't be with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he can't believe he found me
Wraps his arms around me
Yeah-eah, eah-eah-eah-yeah

[Chorus]
I can't let him in
You call me up and ask me how I've been
I'll call your bluff and
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
No, I can't let them in
You play me rough, but I won't let you win
So, call my bluff, I'll
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
Keep on telling you lies

[Post-Chorus - Extended]
Count down to the day they may come true
I'm counting dow-ow-ow-ow-own
I'm still so dow-ow-ow-ow-own
I'll come around[Intro/Outro]

[Intro/Outro][Kanye West]
We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

Oh, father time
That meter maid who lends one lively winking eye
We dance a borrowed jig while hiding from the fine
Oh, what I wouldn't spend to lend you mine, hmm

[Chorus]
Nobody knows where they are going
Oh, how we try to wrap our minds
Over the edge of all our knowings
Be it a bang or the divine
Tip of my iceberg blues are showing
I've never been one for goodbyes
So, 'till I meet you there, I'm singing
A traveling song to ease the ride
And so you know, everywhere I roam
I'll see you on the road, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Oh, I take it in vain
All the plans and moves that we made
Half a heart is aching to grow
Soulmates aren't just lovers you know? I know, I know
Your eyes are the rain, just a soul that's changin' in shape
I'll be laughin' all of the way
Thinkin' 'bout the days, oh

[Chorus]
Nobody knows where they are going
Oh, how we try to wrap our minds
Over the edge of all our knowings
Be it a bang or the divine
Tip of my iceberg blues are showing
I've never been one for goodbyes
So, 'till I meet you there, I'm singing
A traveling song to ease the ride
And so you know, everywhere I roam
I'll see you on the road

[Outro]
So, farewell to my friend
He, who taught me to love like a beast
And to feast like the queen that he fed turtle soup
Little boy from Paris to the States, check the facts
That was Magical Max
He was black sheep and mischief and loved for his craft
Then he told me that I was Apollo 13
On that very last day, he said
"Shoot for your dreams, little girl, to the stars,"
Well I'm taking you with me
Now this one is ours
And I know what you'd say, you'd say
"On with the show,"
So on we go[Produced by Cashmere Cat]

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Boy, so what's been on your mind?
For me, it's just you all the time
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I, we'll be alright
Cause here, we get to take our time
You, you're finer than some wine
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I, we'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So when you're ready, baby

And then I'm like, oh, your love

After that, when you catch your breath
You look at me and say
Love, are you real?
Just don't pretend you're just a friend

And you love, and you love me good, no lie
But there's something behind those eyes, those eyes
That you can't, that you can't disguise, disguise

[Chorus]
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I don't wanna cry no longer
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie

Baby, and drive me crazy

[Verse 1]
If you know how to treat me
You know how to touch me
Baby then you’ll get the chance
The chance to love me
It’s obvious I want to be into you
But it all depends on all the things you do
Cause babe I promise, I promise
If you keep it real with me
Be honest, be honest
You can get anything you want
That you want babe
Just show me everything I need to see
I’ll give you anything boy

So if you treat me right just the way that I want you
Oh baby boy I promise that I’ll be on you

Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry & Snoop Dogg]
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (yeah, yeah)
The boys, break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek, at us
(What, what, what?)

[Pre-Hook: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love, ohh, oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh-oh

[Hook: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh-oh, oh, oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh-oh, oh, oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh-oh

These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
{*OHH!*} The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep, and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay, just like I love L.A
Venice Beach, and Palm Springs
Summer time is everything
Homeboys, banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, tankinis, martinis
No weenies, just the king and the Queenie

Break down
Break down
Break down
I was scared to death I was losing my mind
Break down
I couldn’t close my eyes I was pacing all night
I think I found the light out the end of the tunnel
I couldn’t find the truth I was going under

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won’t hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out
Gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now

[Chorus]
And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I’ll fly like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball

[Verse 2]
Freedom
I let go of fear and the peace came quickly
Freedom
I was in the dark and then it hit me
I chose suffering and pain in the falling rain
I know, I gotta get out into the world again

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Break down
I was scared to death I was losing my mind
Break it down
I gotta get out into the world again

I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball[Intro] (x2)
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love

[Verse 1]
Took the plane at five
Flew across the world, I'm the other girl
The one who's in your head
Laid there by your side
In the city nights, naked in the lights
Hiding secrets in your bed

[Chorus]
Coz we tried to turn around, but we can't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind
Push restart, press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love

[Verse 2]
Lost inside the line
Stare across the room, almost fallin' through
Never make the same mistake
Harder every time
Wish we could be true, always wantin' you
We gotta stay a mystery
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of

Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of

Then I'm gonna smuggle
Some Rosé, Chandon
Drink 'til I see double
She put boobies in my face
And now I'm really seeing doubles
I took her to my place
To blast off like a shuttle, wait
Kissing while we talkin'
So I'm speaking with a mumble

This is all we've got and then it's gone

We light up the dark

We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

[Hook - Rihanna]
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Hook]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Verse 2]
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Hook]
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

[Hook]
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Hook]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Outro]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond[Hook]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night
Like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night
Like we're gonna die young

[Verse 1]
Young hearts, out our minds
Running till we outta time
Wild childs, looking good
Living hard just like we should
Don't care who's watching when we tearing it up (you know)
That magic that we got, nobody can touch (for sure)

[Bridge]
Looking for some trouble tonight (yeah!)
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives (uh-huh!)
We'll keep dancing till we die

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Young punks taking shots
Stripping down to dirty socks
Music up, getting hot
Kiss me, give me all you've got
It's pretty obvious that you got a crush (you know)
That magic in your pants, it's making me blush (for sure)

[Bridge]

[Hook: Collective]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums

[Hook][Verse 1: Juicy J]
Everybody know Juicy always turnt up
Tour bus smoked out, everybody purped up
9 to 5 grind and got the whole hood worked up
Ain't getting money then you better get your work up
Pull up in a Porsche drunk, back seat chauffeur
Taylor Gang in here, everybody know us
Hundred bottles, and there's more coming
Same shit tomorrow night, all I know is stunting
20 shot of Jager, I don't do chasers
White boy wasted, smoking out the vaper
Party with your girl, sweating out my pores
Becky so good, I had to thank the Lord
She won my heart, in the club she go hard
Shake her ass and titties, I threw my card
Love California girls like David Lee Roth
You tell em that you love em
I say, 'Take it off'

[Hook: Ke$ha]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms

[Ke$ha]
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
No changing us
Ball so hard, it's not a game to us
Pull up in the club throwing Taylor's up
Spending cause money ain't a thing to us
But for the famous stuff, I wasn't the one to play with
Party all night, getting drunk and raging
Ball so hard, I think I'm gonna be sick
Wake up, roll a joint and do it all again
Yeah, I like to party
Got a cute face and I like your body
You leave sober and you might be sorry
Pour another shot then light the Marley
And what goes down, don't bring it up
Tell them broke niggas they can hang it up
Take six shots, feels like we're dying
Hit this once, feels like you're flying

[Hook: Ke$ha]

[Becky G]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

[Ke$ha]
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

[Verse 3: Becky G]
Won't stop cause it's my time, time
I'm staying on my grind, grind
You tryna take my shine, shine?
Step back, bye bye
When I rap, all the boys go cray cray
Every time that I jump on the stage
Oh, you like it when I'm in your face?
And if you don't, man, whatcha gonna say?

[Hook: Ke$ha]
Looking for some trouble tonight (yeah)
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young

[Outro: Ke$ha]
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Hit the corner, burnin' rubber like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
Black dress with the tights underneath
I've got the breath of a last cigarette on my teeth
And she's an actress but she ain't got no need
She's got money from her parents in a trust fund back east
T-t-t-tongues always pressed to your cheeks
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl's teeth
You tell your boyfriend, if he says he's got beef
That I'm a vegetarian and I ain't fucking scared of him

[Chorus]
She wants to touch me, woo ooh, she wants to love me, woo ooh
She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh
Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho cause the ho won't trust me
She wants to touch me, woo ooh, she wants to love me, woo ooh
She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh
Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho cause the ho won't trust me

[Verse 2]
X's on the back of your hands
Washed them in the bathroom to drink like the bands
And the set list, you stole off the stage
Has red and purple lipstick all over the page
Br-br-br-bruises cover your arms
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm
And the best is, no one knows who you are
Just another girl alone at the bar

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips

[Chorus][Intro: 3OH!3]
Black dress with the tights underneath

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I've been feeling some type of way about her
Wanna wife her
Borderline I don't really like her
Cause she like to play around and she know she got it
In turn and make a kid not really want it
A bad bitch, who know she a bad bitch

Worst type in the world if you ask me
Worst thing in the world is emotions
So I'm sitting here trying to go through the motion
Get along but it'd be better if we boned
You don't understand, I don't need you honey
I beat my dick like I don't need money
She get around probably fuck yo homie
She text me then she probably gonna text Drake
Cause it be the ones man, with the pretty face
I guess it be the moon man who cracked the case

[Hook: 3OH!3] [x2]
She wants to touch me [Woah]
She wants to love me [Woah]
She'll never leave me [Woah, woah, oh, oh]
Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho
Won't trust me

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
She's a freshman, with a cup in her hand
She tries her best to pretend she doesn't know who I am
Her and her best friend, I seen em pull up they skirts
They got a wager to see who can hook up with me first
The threesome, like you ain't done it before
Oh you're a good girl, from high in his port
Well tell your boyfriend, if he even exists
He shouldn't trust you, because I'm stealing his bitch

[Kid Cudi]
Hey hater, sign language
Middle finger, middle finger
Let me tell you now
Intergalactical
I see them rockin the pole
I see them 304

[Hook: 3OH!3][x2]
She wants to touch me [Woah]
She wants to love me [Woah]

Diamond, diamond, shining, shining, ooh, boy, you so fine
Gotta be the finest thing that I've seen in my life
I will pay whatever just to get a better view
And, yeah, your body looks so sick, I think I caught the flu

[Pre-Chorus:]
Look at you, look at you
Be my sweetie, be my honey tonight
Look at you, look at you
Be my sweetie, be my honey tonight

I know you've heard it before
Boy, you know you broke the mold
Nobody even come close
Nobody even come close
You're some kind of fine

[Verse 2]
You must be B-I-G because you got me hypnotized
Whoever that beauty's on the inside is a liar
Cause what I'm looking at right now would make a big girl cry
So fasten up your seat belt, it's gonna be a bumpy ride

[Pre-Chorus]

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge : Sabi]
Oh, I think I like you, Sabi!
Boy, boy, look at you
I wanna get, get, get next to you

Boy, boy, look at me
I know you wanna touch but it ain't for free
I don't want your money, I just want your D
Boi, come over heeya witcho sexii azz

[Chorus]I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying AYO! gotta let go!
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying AYO! baby, let’s go!

If wasn't for this, if wasn't for that
If wasn't for thief, if wasn't for rap
I probably be in jail or that
So rest in peace Dave, we'll never forget you
All the shit that we did together
We miss you, bro, your music will live forever
It's the BRAZA era, so it's whatever
Don't matter what they did, we did it better
You helped the [??], kinda like my big bro
Not just C4bal, but the whole Team PRO
We was family, kinda like my [??]
Can't it be that,  it was all so simple
But that's life, as we cry, we grow
With tear in eyes, cause inside we know
It will never gon' be the same without this kid, yo
This is straight from the heart, I love you Disco

[Refrão]
Um momento de silêncio
Eu dedico pra quem não ta mais aqui
Então acendo um incenso e sinto quanta falta você faz aqui
Sim, eu choro quando eu penso que eu nunca mais vou ver você sorri
Em memória eu relembro, essa é pra você meu mano Disco D

[Verso 2]
Em silêncio, eu sinto sua falta, cara
Lembro que o seu sorriso iluminava a sala
Você foi um gênio, na musica e no business
Mixtape e uma tour em menos de um mês
Se você tivesse vivo, teria sido diferente
Teria sido, mas eu sigo em frente
Quando não sei o que eu faço, eu penso o que você faria
A vida é tão frágil, eu penso em você Maria (Clara)
Quem disse que homem não chora?
Eu chorei com você quando minha mãe foi embora
Mas eu também lembro da gente rindo, todo rolê gringo loco
Se você quer saber, remorso eu sinto pouco
Porque se eu soubesse, eu teria ficado
Se eu soubesse, um abraço eu teria te dado
Mas você quis assim, então que assim seja, tru
Daqui até o fim, pra mim déjà vu

[Refrão][Verse 1]
You cast a spell on me
I was broken by the breeze
And runnin' from the ones behind me
Just in it for the game
A wild thing to tame
But you took my hand and ran beside me

[Chorus]
I'm slippin' up under my feet
Hallelujah, believe
Hear my heart beat major keys
Nothin' competes
When love is free

[Verse 2]
My compass may be broke
But you follow where I go
And you never really seem to mind it
Sun, stare it in the eye
Now, I'm blinded by the light
That seein' you with eyes wide open

[Chorus]
I'm slippin' up under my feet
Hallelujah, believe
Hear my heart beat major keys
Nothin' competes
When love is free

[Bridge]
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball when we're together
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball when we're together
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball when we're together
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball when we're together
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball when we're together
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball, just a ball, ball

[Outro]
When love is free
