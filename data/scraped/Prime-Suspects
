Where I'm from, only strong niggas live where I'm from

Where I'm from, only real niggas live where I'm from
Where I'm from, only strong niggas live where I'm from

(C-Murder)
I live cross' the street from a killer
Round' the corner from a murderer
Next door to a nigga, that never even heard of a free day
Cause he did fed time about 9
A cold-blooded killer, still dressing like them old times
Their goes some gangstas on the corner slanging crack
If you want the powder, you gots to go around the back
If you don't want trouble, then stay up in your home
In the middle of my block, is where you find the heroine
And the one who kill the most, get the most respect
Its like the motherfucking law, when you living in the projects
Cause money brings problems, and dope brings killing
And where I'm from, every young nigga willing
To do what they gotta do, on my block
Thats why the best job in the hood is slanging rocks

Nigga

(C-Murder)
I live the life of a killer
One time can't catch me, hennessey and weed

We duck and run from the bullets of our jealous friends
Prime Suspects feel my pain
Its the killer in me, cause I'm true to the game

HookI'm a bird with a fix
I lay with the roaches
My 85 Cutlass red and it be smoking
Posting and hustling
Struggling and plugging
Mean muggin and thuggin and cursing out you cop suckers
My all black soldier Reebok's with the bubble gum sole
Good for walking and running from the dumb ass popos
Mo hustling slicker than Earl, colder than furl
Trying to get a little something something in this cold cold world
Everybody and they mama out here shooting game
Perpetrating and faking, even the got damn preacher man
Gangstas harmonizing like my nigga Mo B
Prime Suspects, 3rd ward soldiers
Living raw better have my boulders
Shooting dog water all ya'l back up call
Rob with Silkk up in the Viper
Can't catch me, I know they don't like me

[Chorus x4]

Get it how ya live how we live be raw
I ain't bout being broke crooked officer

One more strike a nigga out of this bitch
Coppers on my ass I gotta think real quick
Trying to make it over for that LAP
Plus its dark in the trees, gone cushion the seat
For a smooth getaway, at least that's what I thought
Head up the alleyway they had two more cars
(Freeze mothafucka freeze, oh shit he's armed and dangerous)
I know that I'm a die if I let them coppers get me
My oozie got 32 rounds I'm taking two of ya bitches with me
I refuse to be a victim, going out like Adolf Arjay
You got a gun I got a gun I run no more bitch
NOPD trying to send me upstate
With a murder case, what the fuck
Can somebody pick the place
No not today I'm gone get mine
Never ever dying
But if I do than its cool, in between time of food
I got away

[Chorus x4]

I'm on some other shit
Some killed my brother shit
I'm out here getting and I'm gone get what I can get
Dicksuckers in my mothafucking place though
Smiling in my face
I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
Millimeter get to bucking your whole body turning numb
Now the cops running after me now I can't cope
I hit the parkway when I stash my dope
Cause if these pigs catch me slipping or tripping I'm dead
No suspects no motives, with two to the head
Fuck that I ain't with it, so I'm gone sell my dope
Yes its ran buy boat, but these niggas can't cope
Cause they caught in the dope world
Fancy cars, fly clothes daytons and vogues
And these fucking pussy popping hoes
Them dick suckers fitting to been man they already done had
But fuck that I gots this mac so I'm busting back
Its hot as fuck, you better duck
The last thing in my mind in this world is being locked up
I'm on probation, life is what I'm facing
In this damn zoo
Them boys in blue is always after the crew
Because we stay true in doing what we do
(25 with a L son)
Man fuck you
And do this time shit never mind
I'd rather rhyme build my client
Get mine never blind and pack a nine
They never see my desperate signs
And fuck a bind
They think I'm blind to his kind
Crooked as fuck, you out of luck
Stuck in this cell, a living hell
Bust back, you might as well
Peep this I'm clocking figures
Pulling triggers on niggas that run up
They getting done up
From sun down to sun up
It don't stop I'm on the block slanging rocks
You crooked cops, they on my jock my Glock
You cop catch me now I bust a shot
Get it how you live how we live be raw[Prime Suspects]

See them scary motherfuckers look em dead in the eye
Uzi man got to touch ya ain't no love for ya
I got the spirit of my nigga laying dead in the gutter
Got the bustin by moon in the broad daylight
Facing life, I'm a soldier willing to die for what's right
Flags spinnin at him, caught four did him wrong
Bust your dome, now I'm breakin, shakin, headin on home
Smokin on that California to relieve my stress
Know them coppers coming at me so I'm wearin my vest

Chorus

[Glock]

Realizing to yourself you can't fuck with niggas who hungry

Got my name ringin, got your people spooked out
Heard it was niggas in all black steel toes trooped out
Now your in position to feel crushed by niggas too real
Straight warriors, gettin it how they live

Chorus x2[Mr. Serv-On]
Niggas realize we all livin in our last days
And we all Prime Suspects to the pains of this world
And just think if you was lookin eye to eye with your killer
It's your last breath, it's your last cry

[Glock]
I go all out constantly thankin how to get mine
Everything I do is a hustle, pullin work tryin to get by
Every time I close my eyes
I'm havin nightmares of closed caskets faced down
Thankin is it my time
But got to watch these niggas with the slanted and crooked eyes
Lookin me straight in my face and I know they be jive
But I make moves like a chess play yall then I handles mine
I'm pressure stress to the fullest, but only the smart survive
Can I maintian, or will my mama see my name enscribed
Losin all my faith, chase one bag and weed
That felt in my ear claimin she can show me a better day
That's why I'm boxin with the devil, that's why I'm totin the AK
That's why I'm peepin through my window every motherfuckin day
The final chapter wanna write me away
But it ain't goin be that easy, I'm livin out my own play
I'm hollerin right, left, never goin astray

Chorus
Now why I'm peepin through my window
These last days got me sleepin in my steel toes
But I gotta survive, hollerin how much time
Till I'm just another memory, my name enscribed  x2

[New Nine]
I heard a ghetto child cryin tonight
Sayin Lord don't let that killer nigga take my life
But the reaper breathe death and he came to visit
Layin shaking with his bacon, hot fry to the finish
Babies dying, mama's crying, yellow tapes around the scenes
The last day's right before us so I run and catch my neice
Paranoid with my gun, thinkin I could be next
Trust in a few, niggas blastin at me to rest

[Uzi]
Now see that drama that I'm bringin, half of these niggas can't even touch
Now see these last days and times, they got a nigga mind fucked up
But I gotta maintain and keep my composure
That's why I smoke dolja, cause see it's trife down south
They takin it off your shoulders
And bloody bodies just an everyday thang
Motherfuckin consiquences if you hang where I slang
Look it's this thang you get banged
On my block is how we do it
Shit is real these days, use that vest, I'm comin through it
Nigga fuck who mourn, your best bet is to protect your neck
And never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
There's a constant threat in the N.O
That's why I'm peepin through my window
That shit is grimy in the gumbo

[Glock]
Chorus

[Mac]
Check it
These streets is dangerous and life is hard
Murder murder's in my eyes, take it away my Lord
Cause ever since I was a lil nigga
Chasing Nike's and Hilfiger
I never knew one day that I would have to kill nigga
I ain't never had shit, I'm straight from the ghetto where niggas are poor
Crack heads are hangin in front of the corner store
Chasin little bitty peices of flow
Everybody wanna be like Master P, tatooes screamin out they bout it
Could yall make a change and be up out the game
I really doubt it doubt it

[Glock]

Kept me thinkin that gang a niggas named Jackers was gon play me
See my baby, would amase me, when she hit the block
Her dycker names are grams, pizza, and rye

Mothers done lie sick, from ,meeting up with my girl
She done make my pockets fat from Curuptin world
But see dont let hr high tonight
Cause she'll make you end your life tonight

[Chorus]

[Snoop]
I have a lot of bitches

I fucked a lot of bitches
Which is the reason
I fell in love with her

She's the preachers daughter
And Quarter Key is what they call her
She's a Chi town baller, checking cheese from new orleans
Then she ship it down to her folks uptown in Harlem
When my chips get low, that's what my old lady for
Can you hear me dawg nigga, do you feel me dawg
All my niggas in the game feel the same way
Getting honey for the money, then cut like O.J
My lifestyle is crazy im living way to shady
Im at the pad acting bad my old lady

[Chorus]

[Uzi]
She drive me crazy can't keep her off the streets
A down bitch, down to make me rich, she hot, she makes me keep some heat
Some say I switch cause I left my boy for that girl
But they tripping, she's TRU 2 me, they tryin' blues so let that bitch run
My world she understanding never demanding
And never overweight, when I go to jail she post bail
And when Im hungry she fixes a plate she's playa hated
By these sucker, and jomie they wanted the beef
She kept my homies paid I know they like her
Because they nicknamed her "D"

[Glock]
My old lady snow jumped off the poacher
Native four expensive ho she balls cutthroat
With gangstas cross if you here to one time
Ain't no flossing, but if you pimp the bitch and stack the grits

Long police mad, can't stand my bitch game plan
Slick with her should I love money making bitch
She got that fire, got all that junk and boy 6

[New 9]

You niggas wanna love, my old lady tattoo slug bouncin
That ass in the club my old lady got the tweakers,tweakers
And she love when I beat he with that B-12, and watch it swell
Making my paper on the streets, ugh and since I

And when the game get me stressed out fuck it im ready to ride

And jump in the motherfucking car and pass the heat (pass the heat)
Everybody gone nigga, fuck the police

Fuck these bitches cause they'll love ya, but most of these hoes they hate

Street walls forced apon ghetto children
Putting any section to sleep when a nigga got the heat

Soldiers, all for nigga, one for all

Struggling and plugging
Mean muggin and thuggin and cursing out you cop suckers
My all black soldier Reebok's with the bubble gum sole
Good for walking and running from the dumb ass popos
Mo hustling slicker than Earl, colder than furl
Trying to get a little something something in this cold cold world
Everybody and they mama out here shooting game
Perpetrating and faking, even the got damn preacher man
Gangstas harmonizing like my nigga Mo B
Prime Suspects, 3rd ward soldiers
Living raw better have my boulders
Shooting dog water all ya'l back up call
Rob with Silkk up in the Viper
Can't catch me, I know they don't like me

[Chorus x4]

Get it how ya live how we live be raw
I ain't bout being broke crooked officer

One more strike a nigga out of this bitch
Coppers on my ass I gotta think real quick
Trying to make it over for that LAP
Plus its dark in the trees, gone cushion the seat
For a smooth getaway, at least that's what I thought
Head up the alleyway they had two more cars
(Freeze mothafucka freeze, oh shit he's armed and dangerous)
I know that I'm a die if I let them coppers get me
My oozie got 32 rounds I'm taking two of ya bitches with me
I refuse to be a victim, going out like Adolf Arjay
You got a gun I got a gun I run no more bitch
NOPD trying to send me upstate
With a murder case, what the fuck
Can somebody pick the place
No not today I'm gone get mine
Never ever dying
But if I do than its cool, in between time of food
I got away

[Chorus x4]

I'm on some other shit
Some killed my brother shit
I'm out here getting and I'm gone get what I can get
Dicksuckers in my mothafucking place though
Smiling in my face
I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
Millimeter get to bucking your whole body turning numb
Now the cops running after me now I can't cope
I hit the parkway when I stash my dope
Cause if these pigs catch me slipping or tripping I'm dead
No suspects no motives, with two to the head
Fuck that I ain't with it, so I'm gone sell my dope
Yes its ran buy boat, but these niggas can't cope
Cause they caught in the dope world
Fancy cars, fly clothes daytons and vogues
And these fucking pussy popping hoes
Them dick suckers fitting to been man they already done had
But fuck that I gots this mac so I'm busting back
Its hot as fuck, you better duck
The last thing in my mind in this world is being locked up
I'm on probation, life is what I'm facing
In this damn zoo
Them boys in blue is always after the crew
Because we stay true in doing what we do
(25 with a L son)
Man fuck you
And do this time shit never mind
I'd rather rhyme build my client
Get mine never blind and pack a nine
They never see my desperate signs
And fuck a bind
They think I'm blind to his kind
Crooked as fuck, you out of luck
Stuck in this cell, a living hell
Bust back, you might as well
Peep this I'm clocking figures
Pulling triggers on niggas that run up
They getting done up
From sun down to sun up
It don't stop I'm on the block slanging rocks
You crooked cops, they on my jock my Glock
You cop catch me now I bust a shot
Get it how you live how we live be raw[Mr. Serv-On]
Time to release this terror on you
Best believe in these letters across my stomach
I'm gonna blast on you, piss on you
Fuck what these coward bitches told me
Live a quiet life, take a wife
Fuck that I'm slanging this shit day and night
Gimme a bitch, 36 ounces to a crooked scale
A thousand pounds to a bail, nigga thats mail
If I fail to die with money in my pocket
Nigga blast from my side if I ride
I'm high-siding on you motherfuckers
Lot of you bitches made to suffer
For that cheese, so drop to your knees, and say please
To these young niggas, cap pillas, and they be candy dealers
Ready to pistol whip and to die rich shit a jail trip
I'll frusterate your bitch
A nigga wanna be laying in them guts, nigga you know whats up
I'm slanging this 'cane, from Youngsfolk, Virginia to the bay
Every day, flipping them browns
Sharp me for my shit, I'm baseball whipping
Like pac man, niggas don't doubt it, been bout it

[Prime Suspects]
Yo, I'm coming, you running, cause I'm gunning
My nine humming, 12 gauge to your fuckin stomach
Facing charges, my ??? is of runs and guns
Getting it done, for the fun, putting it down like Torrence nigga
Run, be that killa California
Home if that nigga did one leave you soaked
Like a sonar, a No Limit soldier
Been totin', fuck ghetto quotes
Murder he spoke, I never wrote
I live with the most, I left a note
PS undercover, pull the bluff from my coat, BITCH
You die rich or a bitch nigga

Situation too real so you bail
And when you see us don't bow, nigga kneel
Used to wonder how you jump ship in full throttle
But when a nigga got your heart too so you usually follow
Now you screamin and hollerin, with that middle no ax
But the world can't hear you, with that deed off your back
You gameless but you shameless
Like a five dollar ho on the stroll
And its gonna be ripped up to toe
Guarantee to die a bitch, block hardy
Not a prophet just a ho ass bitch
Huh, realase that smoke from your ass, I hear you hollerin, whaaaat

My momma raised me up a little bad motherfucker
At the age of fifteen told me slow down it brother
You bout to get our shit with all that weed hold firm
Don't be no bitch little nigga, get the riches of the world
So I'm a let know, I'm out for the gusto rippin some key
I can't be late cause this murder rate is at an all time pace
Less your kicks up, you better duck cause I could give a fuck
As for this tool I got, step poppa gave me this stuff, nigga

Chorus x4

[Lil Gotti Gambino]
Four, five, mack 10, my only friend
Who can guarantee me papers till my end
Selecting my dividends I want it all
I'm macking a hog in 97, chasing down the chedder
Down for whatever, hustling in any kind of weather
Running with killers, thug niggas, drug dealers
You feel us, no limit thrillers, mob figures
Made niggas, livin the family of grave niggas
So misbehave, front page my mafia wave
Got me inches away from a cage my gat you display
On partners be played, my silent prayers be thug haters
In thier grave I be a breeder
All my days can I take time out to pray
Cause momma said judgement day ain't far away
So I be thuggin, pistol huggin, slug bustin
I wish a nigga would trip, I'm a do him wrong and split his dome
To the moon, to the danger zone
And get dealt with, you either die rich or die a bitch
Lil Gotti, representing

I'm representing that whole Gambino Family
Mia X, the farazano, unlady like, Mr. Serv-On
TRU, Prime Suspects, with that platinum shit
With the beats by the pound, P, the colonel, that nigga Silkk
The Shocker, C-Murder, the whole No Limit family
Represent, for youChorus: Fiend (repeat 2X)

Do you wanna be a rider?
Yeah, I wanna be a rider
Are you ready for the power?
Yeah, I'm in there for the power
Got 'cha gat right beside ya?
They must evolve in power
Do you work by the hour?
Then the deal must be sour

[Fiend]
I'm a livin, breathin murder topic, but in the ghetto makin sales
Leaving bloody trails, loving that gunpowder smell
My type about to bring hell boy, flames to where you live
My though, lickin it, got it initiative and jump in get your kid
It's my word after the mid, she did that bit on your live
Though, blame it on Christ, we can happen and deny
I get the cappin for the strise, have a toastin like the hawk
And control as the evil men do, as if they was a cup

Chorus 2X

[Magic]
Picture my mind is full of wicked thoughts, unleash the beasts
Where you niggas that appose me? May y'all rest in peace
I defied and lost man kind, so father forgive me
But its this thug in me got me want me kill my enemy
Will I pay for all the pain that I can cause these families?
Unable to control myself, I'm pleadin in insanity
I'm beggin for my lives cause I'm hated for death
I watch my step and now learn to appreciate every rep
I was born a killer, I've been rejected from society
Fiend's on my side, so none of you niggas can ever bother me
I try to be a better image for my family
But I'm a sin, so they label me a muthafuckin rider

Chorus 2X

[Prime Suspects]
Murder, murder, wonder was the victim I caught slippin?
Now I'm trippin, so drop that
I'm having flag, best to get popped at
Harrassed at a nigga in black, he did the cap
He's blamed it to the states and I can tell you what happened

Check my jacket, you gon' find slow frangin and brangin
Pain to the family or the nigga named Raymond
Got the habit, been down to ride from day 1 ( Uno)
Death blow to the full of the made one

What you know about the powder to the powder, hour after hour
On the block, with the Glock cockers, dills go sour

Hit you in your headache spot with my heat release
Prime Suspects keeps the heat cuz we riders

Chorus 2X

[Lil' Gotti Gambino]
I'm stuck with these mob ties and a matter of die survive
Look in my eyes, determination did shine nigga
I'm out to get mine, 45, my waist line
I waited for my time, Gotti, I'm down to ride
Alias forgive me, for the sins who commit
But these bitch niggas are bout to be dealt with
I'm out for show, bitch told me, "Gun up for show." Hundred round drum
Niggas I'm bustin for fun, make it blood run
Duckin for fun, I live my life on the run
But keep my eyes in the pride, cuz if I slip and I die
So niggas, I'm down to ride wit 'cha, get high wit 'cha
[Fiend]
Because it No Limit
[Lil' Gotti Gambino]
Get ready to die wit 'cha

On an all night flight trying to get rich paid
In the shade on the L.A.P

I still move ten boroughs a week cause a nigga gots to eat
Don't feel my teeth
Mamma turned 5 into 10, 18 to 36
My triple beam gangsta lean
Thousand eight that be the weight
On this motherfucking grip it's the lip
This paper got me rich I'm sick
Quick to run up in that pussy with a hard dick
Ghetto boys starting ghetto wars
Took a little scrilla the killer
Wait starting late in the hood got me paid scoring like Reggie Miller
Representing like a senator
When I'm on the block (woo woo) then again
Smoking hay bitch a hundred down like predator
If you got my rocks then I ain't got no fucking check

[Abel]
Fuck you nigga pay fuck your lady
Fuck your mamma fuck your baby
Rolling with P on the D bout to be gangstafied
Honey drop top white Mercedes

[Mr. Serv-On]
Nigga pass the weed to a nigga baby

Chorus
This world got me heartless
That's why I hit the weed
Leave my middle finger up, I give a fuck (2X)

Dear God tell me, how many times
During the course of a day for ?????
My life I gotta say a prayer for myself
Or tell me, how many nights
My mama gotta lay awake cryin
Starin at my picture on the shelf
But if you ask me
Some of you niggas instead of hating
You need to be anticipating
And find the bullet that's waitin for ya
Do I feel for ya, I'm heartless
I feel for people like my girl Cheryl
Who lost her brother Travis to these streets
Can you imagine, having to identify
Your little brother that's laying beneath some sheets
I don't think so
Or what about this ho
That tried to tell me about a nigga
That I came up with since diapers
Serv watch yourself he don't like ya
Or what about these niggas on my block
That know I made it out
All this dope you niggas done sold in the hood
You still ain't bought
Your mama a house
But believe me niggas I love you till my dying day
But if you try to take me from my family
I'm a bang you in a fuckin heartless way

Chorus (4X)

[New 9]
I just got out last night so it's like a cycle
Even though I know shit always don't go they way you want it to go
I proceed to be a nigga I need, it's only real
It's money making plans to demand at center field
And shit's real and right now everything is tight
I got to pack a gun but if I get caught it's my third strike
I'm strapped up, my tennis too tight, that's how I'm living
A nigga on a mission, anything in my way, I'm killing
That's my mentality right, me and my niggas be quick to fight
Type of niggas you don't wanna cross if you kinda value your life
Whether wrong or right, I got a pocket full of rocks and I'm on a block
Smokin weed with my niggas, last thing I wanna see is a cop
On patrol, some dicksuckers roll, the heck is up
I'm heartless so I point my middle finger cause I don't give a fuck
I'm strapped up and on parole, I gotta fight to stay out of the penn
The same shit happened last year, here I go again

[Mr. Serv-On]
Chorus 4X

[Uzi]
Mercy mercy me, Lord forgive me for the wrong I've done
Ghetto child with a crooked smile I had a rough one
This life full of plenty hurt, so soft and pain
Consequences of the game but I had to maintain
Step on toes, I'm ready to ride or roll over
I'm a kill for a meal, lay back and smoke some doja
But I know what go around come around good
Knock on wood and it's understood
I'm stayin young at twenty one life full of regret
Ten commandments say don't kill but I done left some folks wet
I got the blood of a dead man on my hand
We goin clash again in soldier land
Mm hmm

[Glock]
Now am I wrong when I want to bust your motherfuckin dome
Got that blues song stuck, scratch on you ain't coming home
I let it ride cause I know he be fake
But fuck that he cross my family, this nigga's done took the cake
Stop the record just start it up you can find him in the lake
Have your people fucked up sayin I just saw him yesterday
See that's real and I know you motherfuckers can relate
It's written down in ghetto law and taught by this ghetto church
That's why my hollow keeps me strapped, cause it be too late
Cause in a minute all this shit bout to be in one way

[Mo B. Dick]
Here I go again

[Mr. Serv-On]
Chorus 6X[New 9]
Chorus
We done hit a lick, open up shop
Clear the block, we bout to make this motherfucker hot x2

[Uzi]
The catie was the toolie that we chose for duty
Came up on some bricks, the Mob and PS in some gangsta shit again
The Bay and gumbo connectin, bloody murder
Left him on the curb, heard he smoked plenty herb
That's the brother of the nigga in the last song
We gots to do em, talkin to niggas don't last long
Get your brother spanked takin it back, settin shop
Watch it rock, clear the way cause I'm ready to spray
Uzi man represent raw until I die
Parkway, raise up, where we hang all night
On the flight, Two For One's got them blocks on bump
Heads up, here the law comes (woooooo)

[Billy Bavgate]
Kaboom, I'm Bavgate the cleaner, I'm kickin in your door
Everybody freeze, and lay down on the floor
I heard you got some loochie through a ho
I'm fresh out the penn, I need some dough, I ain't playin no more
Cause it's real bitch give up the jewels
'Fore they find your ass stankin in the Oakland hills

[New 9]
Chorus x2

[Glock]
Wholesale, we done rock this nigga's bell
Another legendary gangsta story to tell
Like a rollin over a bounty here
PS and Steady Mobb'n knock the roof off the kitchen
Now I open up shop, the hot potatoes gone for half a knot
That's how you do it when everything is a profit
Then lay it low for a week or four
Then back door in it's drop, who lookin to score
Recognize a villian, knock him off his tippy toes I'm livin
Gotham City, the nappy headed go get em
Bumpin how you figure, by the young Soulja Slim
And you know we livin right, now put that corn in the wind

[Crooked Eye]
Nigga let's rock it up, any violations we pop it up
So put the brick on the table nigga, let's chop it up
Ghetto D, with the Suspects and the M-O-B
Havin money, stayin strapped with heat
So nigga buck the cops, cause we settin up shop
Got the whole block hot from the ice cream shop
And we sowin it up from the south to the west
Them Black Mafia niggas and the gangsta PS

[New 9]
Chorus x4[Mr. Serv-On]
Niggas realize we all livin in our last days
And we all Prime Suspects to the pains of this world
And just think if you was lookin eye to eye with your killer
It's your last breath, it's your last cry

[Glock]
I go all out constantly thankin how to get mine
Everything I do is a hustle, pullin work tryin to get by
Every time I close my eyes
I'm havin nightmares of closed caskets faced down
Thankin is it my time
But got to watch these niggas with the slanted and crooked eyes
Lookin me straight in my face and I know they be jive
But I make moves like a chess play yall then I handles mine
I'm pressure stress to the fullest, but only the smart survive
Can I maintian, or will my mama see my name enscribed
Losin all my faith, chase one bag and weed
That felt in my ear claimin she can show me a better day
That's why I'm boxin with the devil, that's why I'm totin the AK
That's why I'm peepin through my window every motherfuckin day
The final chapter wanna write me away
But it ain't goin be that easy, I'm livin out my own play
I'm hollerin right, left, never goin astray

Chorus
Now why I'm peepin through my window
These last days got me sleepin in my steel toes
But I gotta survive, hollerin how much time
Till I'm just another memory, my name enscribed  x2

[New Nine]
I heard a ghetto child cryin tonight
Sayin Lord don't let that killer nigga take my life
But the reaper breathe death and he came to visit
Layin shaking with his bacon, hot fry to the finish
Babies dying, mama's crying, yellow tapes around the scenes
The last day's right before us so I run and catch my neice
Paranoid with my gun, thinkin I could be next
Trust in a few, niggas blastin at me to rest

[Uzi]
Now see that drama that I'm bringin, half of these niggas can't even touch
Now see these last days and times, they got a nigga mind fucked up
But I gotta maintain and keep my composure
That's why I smoke dolja, cause see it's trife down south
They takin it off your shoulders
And bloody bodies just an everyday thang
Motherfuckin consiquences if you hang where I slang
Look it's this thang you get banged
On my block is how we do it
Shit is real these days, use that vest, I'm comin through it
Nigga fuck who mourn, your best bet is to protect your neck
And never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
There's a constant threat in the N.O
That's why I'm peepin through my window
That shit is grimy in the gumbo

[Glock]
Chorus

[Mac]
Check it
These streets is dangerous and life is hard
Murder murder's in my eyes, take it away my Lord
Cause ever since I was a lil nigga
Chasing Nike's and Hilfiger
I never knew one day that I would have to kill nigga
I ain't never had shit, I'm straight from the ghetto where niggas are poor
Crack heads are hangin in front of the corner store
Chasin little bitty peices of flow
Everybody wanna be like Master P, tatooes screamin out they bout it
Could yall make a change and be up out the game
I really doubt it doubt it

[Glock]
Chorus x2Damn, these hard times be more vicious
Makin me feel like the liquidation of the ghetto

Chorus
It's hot around my way
Lookin for a better day  X4

[Prime Suspect #1]
Good and bad, right and wrong lurking the land
You choose your fate gracefully
Save your soul if you can
Life is shorter everyday my nigga make the right moves
Choose your hustle spots wisely police give you the blues
Lock you up put a strike by your name you on paper
See the white boy be on every money and your paper
Put the weed down now cause we face incarceration
Stipulations of probation strike two is what you're facin
In the mandatory joes, now you ain't gon bounce
Short timin round them lifers hopin that you touch down
If I see the free world again, I'm a ball
Put my back up on the wall hopin blessins from the lord
3rd strike twenty to life nigga I choose death
Leave a coppers scar wet I ain't aimin for the chest
44 chrome to the dome, uzi man did it
Once again Prime Suspect guilty til proven innocent

Chorus

[Mystikal]
I'm sweatin cause it's hot and humid outside
The spot where we lay it down
I amplify the city streets and terrorize the underground
Nigga respect gangsta and run in the streets they walk on
FBI might finish listenin to the car phone I talk on
Waitin on me, wantin me to mess up, put my hands in some dirt
But I'm a legitimate businessman, I sell light green t-shirts
Go on officer leave me alone, I ain't be got no weapon
I don't even know what you talkin bout, I be makin records
Hits size I'm too busy for this bull and kicks
Was it tinted when you pulled this six
Over to the side of the road
Got my hand on my heater cause I'm tired of you hoes
Let the dog sniff my vehicle and my clothes
But I bet I make it home cause you gotta let me go
I'm too cold for an iron box
I need city lights, the projects, and the boondocks

Chorus

[Prime Suspect #2]
I'm lookin for that wall
So I can put my back up against it
Cause it ain't no love from the beginnin to the endin
They got me pledgin the flag that wanna see me doin 10 in
See it's vicious out chea on these 3rd world streets
Them people tryin to stop the hustle
But yet they survivor just like me
Makin liquidate runnin in them hater streets
So I tell my brother get the cake for me if need be

[Prime Suspect #3]
Look let me run into ya'll cause the pilots burnin over
I've been doin the same thing since lil
But now I'm called a soldier
And I'm older and watch fake soldiers transform cause they own
See them same soldiers upstate and they ain't bout no home
Why it's already a livin hell for the average thick soldiers
Survival of the fittest watch yourself
Is what poppa always told me
Why we already misled, bustin hot metals
I just need to step back and take a look
Cause they liquidatin the ghetto

Chorus until end[Prime Suspects]

Shit nigga, pack the Lac with mac's and choppers cause it's going down

Chorus

[Uzi]
Jumping in the hot Lac with a point to prove
Bumpin pass me them things when you see them they lose

See them scary motherfuckers look em dead in the eye
Uzi man got to touch ya ain't no love for ya
I got the spirit of my nigga laying dead in the gutter
Got the bustin by moon in the broad daylight
Facing life, I'm a soldier willing to die for what's right
Flags spinnin at him, caught four did him wrong
Bust your dome, now I'm breakin, shakin, headin on home
Smokin on that California to relieve my stress
Know them coppers coming at me so I'm wearin my vest

Chorus

[Glock]

Now your in position to feel crushed by niggas too real
Straight warriors, gettin it how they live

Chorus x2[Uzi talkin']
Prime Suspects, Kane & Abel, Silkk The shocker about that money

Money Makes a nigga do some strange thangs (I admit)
Over change, niggas lose they brains (ain't that some shit)
If you got it when then niggas hungry brah (what, what)
Keep your Glock cocked & your eyes up on ya stuff (ya heard me)
[Reapeat]

[Uzi]
Just remember it takes a bitch to play wit a real a real nigga
Glock knockin' 'em while they chop 'em down for figures
While money makes a nigga do some strange thangs, I admit
Over change, niggas lose they brains, ain't that some shit
Come equipped as we still quick in tha Lands
Niggas get dealt wit in his back while shakin' hands
While plans get spoiled by niggas want furl trips
Rather they snort, bang, or either sell tha shit
I hold my dick & let my nuts sag
Niggas act bad behind tha cash actin' like it last forever
Any kind of weather nigga get tha job done
Block hotter than tha sun, niggas still pack a gun
But I ain't tha one to get done wit behind some dumb shit
I pack a gun bitch & ain't scared to let tha bullets flip
I said enough, either get scuffed or roughed up
If you got it when then niggas hungry keep your eyes up on ya stuff

Chorus:(2X)

[Kane & Abel]
Runnin' up on niggas like finish lines, wit cocked nines
Give a fuck if niggas wit dimes, get flatlined for tryna take mines
In broad daylight, lose yo life for tha paper
Haters a waste ya, meat ya maker, coroner gonna have to scrape ya
Off tha concrete
My street hotter than fish grease
For big face bills, niggas kills wit big heat
Niggas dressed in all black or army fatigues
Killas perform like pussy poppers wit choppers, squeeze 2-2-3's
Put your face on TV's, for less than a quarter ki
Leave a clip empty, now watch you muthafuckin' enemies
Murda's like a disease, catch it, ain't no comin' back
Rest in peace, yo wig split, hit by niggas on a jack
Gangstafied Kane & Abel watch the Suspects back
Niggas do strange thangs fo' paper, I feel that
Take tha money, take tha Benz, but hustle never ends
Put us on tha block wit one rock, an we'll make a million again (ha ha)

Chorus:(2X)

[Silkk the Shocker]

She made everyday in the hood in the hood just gravy
Kept me thinkin that gang a niggas named Jackers was gon play me
See my baby, would amase me, when she hit the block
Her dycker names are grams, pizza, and rye
What she got ain't no need for  another bitch
But its so hard, I dont seen brothers kill brothers quick
Mothers done lie sick, from ,meeting up with my girl
She done make my pockets fat from Curuptin world
But see dont let hr high tonight
Cause she'll make you end your life tonight

[Chorus]

[Snoop]
I have a lot of bitches
I made a lot of riches
I fucked a lot of bitches
Which is the reason
I fell in love with her
I never meant to hit her
She's the preachers daughter
And Quarter Key is what they call her
She's a Chi town baller, checking cheese from new orleans
Then she ship it down to her folks uptown in Harlem
When my chips get low, that's what my old lady for
Can you hear me dawg nigga, do you feel me dawg
All my niggas in the game feel the same way
Getting honey for the money, then cut like O.J
My lifestyle is crazy im living way to shady
Im at the pad acting bad my old lady

[Chorus]

[Uzi]
She drive me crazy can't keep her off the streets
A down bitch, down to make me rich, she hot, she makes me keep some heat
Some say I switch cause I left my boy for that girl
But they tripping, she's TRU 2 me, they tryin' blues so let that bitch run
My world she understanding never demanding
And never overweight, when I go to jail she post bail
And when Im hungry she fixes a plate she's playa hated
By these sucker, and jomie they wanted the beef
She kept my homies paid I know they like her
Because they nicknamed her "D"

[Glock]
My old lady snow jumped off the poacher
Native four expensive ho she balls cutthroat
With gangstas cross if you here to one time
Ain't no flossing, but if you pimp the bitch and stack the grits
She make em good money they ho hype stand on the block all day
Long police mad, can't stand my bitch game plan
Slick with her should I love money making bitch
She got that fire, got all that junk and boy 6

[New 9]
My old lady be the thug ho
You niggas wanna love, my old lady tattoo slug bouncin
That ass in the club my old lady got the tweakers,tweakers
And she love when I beat he with that B-12, and watch it swell
Making my paper on the streets, ugh and since I
Pimp her so sweeter it comes back to me
A boss bitch, every nigga wanna please
But they better get the fuck from around me, soul survivors, up in it
Pimp that ho for me from that LAP, to the LBC now pimp that ho for me

Respect the tank, nigga stick my chest out

[Magic]
Woah, please somebody tell me where the party at

Yall just keep the bitches, now we on the way
Hold on man I think Snoop got somethin to say

[Snoop Dogg]

Got out & balled nigga, straight muthafuckin' ball til we fall
Ya heard me, nigga peep game ya heard me, representin'

[Chorus: New-9 & C-Murder]
Outta all tha hustles in tha world, I chose coke
Caught a joce, locked up an I'm missin' my folks
Free a soldier, Lord knows my pain burns deep
I'mma ball if I can touch them streets
[Repeat]

[C-Murder]
When I touch tha streets nigga, I'mma act a fool
I'm known for totin' semi automatic tools
I smoke joes on tha porch wit them O-G's
They taught me how to turn coke to mo' cheese
An when a nigga locked up, he keep his mouth shut
Cause a snitch get his muthafuckin' box cut
An that's tha code of tha street life
I tell a wanna be niggas get they muthafuckin' mind right
Cause all tha ballers & shot callers is targets
They runnin' from jackers, & crooked cops, & other drug lords
An I ain't dyin' on tha street like a dog
I get 'em fo' he get me, I ain't runnin', I'm killin' all of yall
Cause TRU muthafuckin' G's gonna rise
I label him a bitch nigga, by tha fake look in his eyes
How many thugs wanna ride wit me
Cause I'mma ball til' I muthafuckin' fall when I touch tha street

Chorus:(2X)

[New-9]
Fucked up, caught a case gotta learn about life
Cause tha judge heart hurtin', daughter smokin' tha pipe
Life in human hands, prosecutor paintin' an ugly picture
Off tha top Prime Suspects guilty til proven innocent
State appointed lawyer in my ear talkin' ten
Take it now or your headed for plenty time my friend
15 to 30 if ya take it to trail
An tha D-A ain't lost in that section in a while
A rock in a hard place, smack dead in my face
On tha other side of tha game, were them people ain't playin'
It's rough fuckin' round wit these man made laws
But tha junkie boys had me makin' plenty paper
Now I'm sick wit a jones for that rotten ass world
Touch down today or tommorrow, find me slangin' that girl
But I'm sick like a vick chasin' after that high
See the red in my eyes, I'm feelin' like I'mma die

Chorus:(2X)

[Uzi]
Of all tha hustles in tha world I chose tha coke game
Packin' gats & sellin' crack was an everday thang
2 & a quarter they turn to 4 & half an now I sang slabs
Perhaps I can grab what I can grab & never dibble & dab
Half steppin' wit some fake niggas that just wasn't in me
Weed, coke, dope, & money, shit I gotta have plenty
Forgive me for my sins Lord, even though I know it's a shame
But I'm caught up in these worly thangs
An if you don't, then ya considered lame
So I'm splittin' brains & caine, play it like nothin' I had to prove
I choose to do it for profit, cause if I don't, then I lose
Uzi & Glock livin' witness to tha shit that Milli than did
Fuck a job so I rob & if it come I caught a bid
To many broad, H-O-D, hand on smoke, missin' my folks
But I ain't trippin', back at home was a house full of coke
Soon as my feet touch down I gotta get me some heat
Shit, Lord knows this time I'mma ball when I hit tha streets

Chorus:(3X)[Chorus: Uzi]
I gotta ride wit my layin' close on on seat
That's how I'm livin', playin' tha game just like red meat
I don't win, I don't eat, I'm refusin' to sleep
Everyday I'm livin' life dodgin' death on tha street
[Reapeat]

[Uzi]
7 nights on a flight, dressed in black on black
Catch 2 days sleep nigga & I'm back on tha set
Treat ya body junkie boy, all I want is tha money
You can point, snort, smoke, speed, ball & feel lovely
Play it how it go I gotta get mine
Duck tha law at tha same time, stick & move, fuck jail time
Fuck petty hustlin', move to big weight
Nothin' less tha 12-5, I'm grossin' 50 G's everyday
Sound kinda sweet but I'm livin' uncomfortable
Cause my shadow spook me out, niggas plottin' on takin' me out
But I been puttin' in work, so nigga deal wit me
Make me paranoid, I'm uppin' them toys, my heat ridin' wit me

[Prime Suspects talkin']
Seen 9-0 pussy ass niggas around this bitch jackin' 'em
Have they maw dressed in all black singin' a melody around this bitch

(Man fuck it, I ain't seen 'em no mo', lets take a ride down tha rode)
Shit I gots some heat

[Glock]
Fuckin' well right I be spooked out

That's how they find you all tha way stretched tha fuck out
Cause niggas always tryna get theyself repped out
Tryna come up on some clout
Gotta slow 'em down, get my name out cha mouth
I roll wit 2 junkie fields, chrome 357 steal
Throw away at will, if got murda murda kill
It gets real behind my meal ticket
It pays tha bills, I'm chasin' Jill
Evertime I show my grill in tha field
But I gotta support tha fam, can't be weak
You not gonna take this from me
I'm hound out like Cujo
Look in my eye, tha result of hard times
Got me losin' my mind, fuck it, losin' my mind

[New-9]
I gotta ride wit my heat, smack dead on my front seat
Two 9 millimeters nigga & they sqaushin' all beefs
So I keep heaters on a day to day basis
Cause I'm a Prime Suspect nigga
That can't get around for catchin' cases
So I hit Uzi & Glock on a home wit they's heads up shot
Tha quarter shop hot, meat me around tha corner from tha block
Yall know how it go, if it don't, then it's rocks in tha cut nigga
Tha dicks, they come up
You can tell 'em cause they like what's up nigga
Ironically, on tha hot spot, there goes Uzi & Glock in tha cut
Wit tha head stash, wit 2 macs, 2 pumps, & 2 choppers
We play tha game like red meat, & if we don't win, we don't eat
Put tha macs & pumps in tha trunk & tha choppers on tha back seat nigga

[Prime Suspects talkin']
Respect a reall nigga (or get  dealt wit nigga)
I'd rather be dead than po' nigga
(Just them pussy ass bitches bout playin' wit a nigga)

You know I gotta ride wit my muthafuckin' heat nigga

[Chorus](chorus)
I sold me a half nigga

I live cross' the street from a killer
Round' the corner from a murderer
Next door to a nigga, that never even heard of a free day
Cause he did fed time about 9
A cold-blooded killer, still dressing like them old times
Their goes some gangstas on the corner slanging crack
If you want the powder, you gots to go around the back
If you don't want trouble, then stay up in your home
In the middle of my block, is where you find the heroine
And the one who kill the most, get the most respect
Its like the motherfucking law, when you living in the projects
Cause money brings problems, and dope brings killing
And where I'm from, every young nigga willing
To do what they gotta do, on my block
Thats why the best job in the hood is slanging rocks
