[Verse 1: Demrick]
I'm always searching for the setup
Mother told her son "Boy better never let up"
I’ve been fed up, keep your head up, I'mma do this shit forever
Close my eyes watch letters come together
Better than whoever died
They better never not, murk 'em on the spots
Swervin' on some shots
Puffin' pot, this ain’t what you want
On the block, talk a lot, parking lot, barber shop
So I’m in the studio groovin' in the ambiance
Try and be a Capitan, think you’ll be a happy man
Trash can competitions, send them in an ambulance
Taliban, contraband, bitch do the molly dance
Make it out without a chance, livin down at Zombieland
My mind is all twisted, I need a smoke
They hope, I go over the edge without a vote
But nope, these quotes have overcome the impossible
Don't think that they ain't watching you
Nobody's safe

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe

Yeah, it ain’t safe nigga (Nah)
Jarren Benton

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
My pen is poisonous, secrete on your girlfriend’s orifice
Politic with God, said make love to a sorceress
Twist kush like a contortionist
Skimming through thesauruses to find the perfect synonym to slaughter shit
Yeah, I’ve been tryna make a dollar, Dear
Fucking four bitches for perc and petting koala bears
I'm Alfred Hitchcock on PCP
Spillin' vodka for my nigga restin' 6 feet deep
I’m a legend in the making, these other rappers are bacon bits
Too much time in the music, fuck up relationships
Bitch breathe, got chloroform on a handkerchief
Be standing ovation, I spoke at the player's banquet
Fuck wit' me cause you stuck wit' me
I give a shit about your 2 cents nigga, here catch a buck fifty
Underneath the bubble goose, a tool that’ll cut kidneys
We in this motherfucker styrofoam cup with me

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe

[Verse 3: Madchild]
Aye, Underground Kings, swing swords like we Turkish
The worst version of personal verse murkers
Spookiest nucliest kookiest conquest
So nobody's safe like a nuclear bomb threat
Young De dabbed till his lungs full of crystals
We kung fu fist, all these young tongue twisters
Very mental , listen and say "The Demented"
Kill it on a hoppa instrumental, now with Jarren Benton
Aye, I am asshole smurf
Money spread across the floor like it's AstroTurf
I met a groupie, almost had a heart attack
Fucked her then I came in her face and called it an autograph
Told you that right after I nut I won't call you
West coast Bax-War killers with Funk Volume
Angry, I'm bady, a Gladiator mayne
We are hungry, salivate with alligator fangs
I'm from an asylum, wild tribal and violent
Won’t catch me sleeping, I sliced both of my eyelids
I'm vibrant , vampire and lycan, a hybrid
White like i'm Rye bread and write like a tyrant

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe[Verse 1: Berner]
I'm dizzy, F1 got the room pissy
Good smoke in my lungs, drunk bitch don't kiss me
Fresh picked, still sticky, but it burn right
I'm everythang that your girl like
I went from trimmin' to swimmin' in beaches
From Puerto Rican and Dominican girls, with no Visas
Light the reefer, pass it to the left
I told her hold it in
Let it burn to the end and we'll smoke again
My flip-flops Gucci, in my crib watch movies
In my own home theatre, with three or four groupies
Lobster roll, hot Saké with the sushi
Flip coke money, in the rap game
They wanna prosecute me
A couple tried to shoot me, let me live player, let me get paper
Three Xanax bars, that's a mind eraser
All the money and cars, I got all kinds of haters

[Hook: Berner]
I don't ever sip alone
Xanax and Patron, I don't remember gettin' home
Xanax and Patron, I don't ever sleep alone
Xanax and Patron, I don't remember gettin' home
Xanax and Patron

[Verse 2: B-Real]
When you're in the Dam, Better think about (kosher?)
Bitches passin' out at the Green House
Take a hit, lights out at the hash bar
On the floor eyes open, what you ask for?
Smoke everywhere, now ya need the Doctor
Air lifted, elevated, hellicopta'
Don't be comin' with no rookie lungs in the Dam
Don't be pumpin' up your chest like you're goin' H.A.M
Got ya flyin' into the E.R, first class
Got ya tappin' in a minute, first [dance?]
When the thrust lasts, like a blast from a dab hit
Bern's in flight for the [slab?], bitch
From the herb, maybe shrub, then to shatter
Maybe hardcore, settin' off the high in the brain matter
In my shot glass, fire water
Berner got the Xanny
Lights out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Demrick]
She let us pop those, and I got those
I'm a two boss star, I [move got fo?]
[All the games?], mix Patron, with champagne
Got me chillin' in the zone, like I'm gone on the plane
Yeah I wanna catch a fade
So I call my homie Berner, when he said he'll put me on, in the Bay
Breakin' cookies on the tray
Glass tips, Raw Papers when I twist, you ain't fuckin' with my day
Shit, it's just another day
Turn to a goodnight and it's goodnight for ya right away
All ya first top dabbers, we high like ladders
When ya really get money, mane shit don't matter

[Hook]Enter Death's waiting room, if you dare

[Hook: Demrick]
We ride where we come from
We get high where we come from
It's suicide, try to play dumb
Go against mines, you could die where we come from

[Verse 1: Madchild]
Welcome to the Terrordome
Silver Surfer, my exterior is mirrored chrome
Kill planets as I fly through the galaxy
And smash every fuckboy act that lives a fallacy
I'm exploding with vitality
Hard to find a capable compatible mentality
I found young De, that's my young G
Just as fearsome, lethal, equally as hungry
When I start snapping on a beat it gives you cold chills
White axe face tatted rapper wearing gold grills
Moved to the USA cause shit was killing me
High toxicity with zero visibility
I'm thinking how am I gonna make it I'm too complex
Waking up hallucinating, screaming with my palms wet
Then I realized they realized that I'm a bomb threat
New kid with the experience of Vietnam vets

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Demrick]
The way I'm feeling, just know I'm willing to die
For what I believe in, blow my smoke up in the sky
Living life like this, live for nights like this
Drink a 5th, smoke and sip, take a hit, that's my shit
Any bottle on the table, living so unstable
She got a body of an angel but that ain't no halo
All about the dollar, pound, euro, peso
Son a nigga like a cradle, shot's fatal, independent no payroll
Arrive like deliverance, this the wack rapper nemesis
Fuck your censorship we killing shit right on the premises
And my head up in the clouds, puffing loud, no access
You haters ain't allowed to come around, you past tense
Tune to the sounds and right now watch the crowd
Crowd around, inside a riot, get wild
And I came from the abyss with some kill to twist
Black and white mix, suck a dick
Who the fuck you fuckin' with bitch

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Madchild]
We on some ride or die shit, a mighty and majestic beast
The competition better exit or you'll rest in peace
Kill shows, all these other cats are extra goofy
Use my iPhone to make a porn after with sexy groupies
Fuck em two at a time until they're screaming
A green eyed, ink covered, three legged demon
My words are magical, they're dancing, jumping off the pages
And every word I blurt's a murderous engagement
I'm raging, this is oral choreography
We're climbing, steady new sensation, they're tobogganing
Fifteen minutes of fame, they fall so fast
That's cause we do it for the love before the cold cash
I'm not saying we don't want a little extra loot
But to our soldiers, we salute, and lyrically we execute
These fuckboys all chickenheads with ruffled feathers
We made it through the roughest weather, skin is tough as leather

[Hook x2][Verse 1: MadChild]
I spit ferocious fireballs, the kids are all excited
I pour petroleum on your linoleum and light it
On a podium, I'm causing pandemonium
Sodium and nitrate, second greatest rapper in the white race
Might've been the spider venom, might've been the snake bite
Fuck with me and find out what a metal pipe will taste like
I'm explosive like a molotov cocktail
Lyrics get around the kids quick like fuckin' hotmail
Involuntarily, solitary confinement
I've no one to confide in, quiet in my environment
Mentally, I'm way off balance and off kilter
Brains, we ought to wack - that's why I rap without a filter
Perverted matador, I tackle bulls and try to mount 'em
So many personalities, don't bother trying to count 'em
My life is a crazy rollercoaster, call me Magic Mountain
I'm throwing boulders, they're exploding - mouth's a fuckin' fountain

[Hook 1: MadChild]
I'm mental
That's just the way that it goes, dog
Canadian but you could keep the rain and the snowballs
I love palm trees, sitting in the sunshine
Learning quick - my rhymes, they are ridiculously sublime
Stupid shit, but the way that I combine
My wordplay, smartest rapper out with a dumb mind
Sometimes I kind of miss the clouds and the rain
Cause that's what helped me get the blues, MadChild is proudly insane

[Verse 2: MadChild]
I went from backpack, to snapbacks, to lab rats on acid
Spit anthrax, the band's back, this man's raps are massive
Completely gone bananas, whipping up within bonanza
Short like Dan DeVito, still the boss like Tony Danza
Now stick your damn hands up, this here is a robbery
Hobblin' like a goblin and my brain is a little wobbly
I'm probably the height of a hobbit that's hobnobbin' in Oz
With a couple wonderful wizards, I've got problems
The plot thickens, I'm stuck up in the mud again
Utterly disgusting when I'm muttering my foot up in your anal hole
It's unexplainable cause I'm the awesomest
Blossom from a possum, stick my cock down your esophagus
Narcissist, I'm also an arsonist from an orphanage
Cock is way too big for my body, it's unproportionate
Morph into a profitable author, Mad's a novelist
Of course I'm still a mess and I'm depressed, it's probably obvious

[Hook 2: MadChild]
I'm fuckin' mental
That's just the way that it goes, dog
Canadian but you could keep the rain and the snowballs
I love palm trees, sitting in the sunshine
Learning quick - my rhymes, they are ridiculously sublime
Stupid shit, but the way that I combine
My wordplay, smartest rapper out with a dumb mind
Sometimes I kind of miss the clouds and the rain
Cause that's what helps me get the blues, MadChild is proudly insane

[Verse 3: Demrick]
I lost my mind a long time ago
Hot with the rhyming though
Fall in line like dominos
Light it up, vamanos
My flow is all kind of dope
Something like a line of coke
Streets is cold, go and grab my heater, that's my kind of coat
Rain, hell, sleet, or snow
Shit you never know but to each his own
Pops back from prison, guess the preach is on
Watch your tone, Battleaxe Warriors are not alone
Smoke a zone, to the dome
I can't leave this life alone
Murder on this microphone
Living in a Cali daze
Get familiar, this serial killer is in his final phase
And my path ain't bathe, every brick is laid
Fuck it, I'm paid
Light a j and just fade away
Fuck what they say, I ain't listening
Son, I'm like a christening
Keep it rolling like Michelin
You don't know shit about positions that I've been up in
Vent again, grind for the benefit
You want to see the end of it

[Hook 2][Intro: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, Jarren
I ain't gonna say my last name nigga, you know what it is (say your last name nigga)
DJ mother fucking Hoppa
Your DJ ain't no DJ
He just hit the instant replay, nigga

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Bitch I break the law of gravity ain't no way that Jarren's falling off
I write like my hand's possessed, I had to gnaw that fucker off
Scared of what, all you niggas soft that I come across
Bust out this fucking straight jacket and bite the buckle off
Old school Corvette, colored as mustard sauce
I speak a different language, fuck discussions with y'all
I para sail the Mediterranean
Your bullets couldn't penetrate the god, my skeleton's titanium
Crazy as a Tasmanian Israelian
Now watch you lame niggas hang from a noose with your feet dangling
Rappers need strangling, I punch out of a pine box
And leap out of the bowels of the devil, subterranean
I fell out of love with that bitch called Hip Hop
Freezer full of rapper's arteries in a Ziploc
Fuck off and kick rocks you fuckers don't get props
I get my dick sucked while I'm bumping Kid Rock

[Hook: Demrick] (x2)
This the shit that you don't know about
You don't live this
Kick the door in at your momma's house
Leave no witness
You a killer or a motormouth
There's a difference
Niggas ride for what they all about
Till it's finished

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
I'm not a killer but don't push me, we all have our limits
Your foolish actions are dictated by the drinks you sippin'
And that's gonna leave you in a bad position
A drunk tongue bred bad intentions and I'm ready to get this over with
Fuck your corporate ties and phoney biz
Purpose and content we got more to give
And more to offer, useful verb, I'm not a fast talker
When I'm done she'll have bad posture she'll be stumbling and walking awkward
I ain't here to satisfy your vices
And I will not be the comfort to cushion your lonely nights with
I turn them on, light switch, I turn them off, light switch
I'm mixed like decisions but the flow is so decisive
We are not enticed by the life you glamorize
That's your ego in disguise I will quickly testify
There's no love for impostors
Shout out to Brass Knuckle Benton, Demrick and my valley pal DJ Hoppa

[Hook: Demrick] (x2)[Hook: x2]
I'm building up my money, call it skyscraper paper
I got models, I got strippers, I got bitches I'm a player
I'm in that residential, waving hi to my neighbors
Then I'm on that next flight saying bye to my neighbors

[Verse 1: Demrick]
I made it outta my hood
I know some niggas wish I was back there
That's why old friends is just old friends
I'm in chuck taylors with a low brim
Got my old Tims and my North Face
From the old days in that cold place
Now it's rose and good kush
California living on my sole face
I got no shame, from the nose bleeds to the center stages at long way
How I got here? Niggas want to act like it's not fair
Just cause I know millionaires who know billionaires
Cause i'm a thousandaire who trynna get there
I used food stamps to fill the fridgidaire
Now it's weekend trips up to big bear
I got a swimming pool in my backyard
Couple pitbulls in my backyard
Couple bitches in bikinis, barbecues what the fuck were you doing? You finally get a backyard
Been in Australia, New Zealand, all of Europe in the last month
I could use this fuel that's in that blunt
Smoke it to the head don't pass once
And I know my neighbors upset, cause we ain't been to sleep yet
We playing these beats on repeat for a week and i'm just warming up as a heat jack
And we don't get a reset, so I'm doing this shit without a regret
She say she wanna stay and get her feet wet
But I'm diving in to the deep end, better reach in

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 2: Logic]
Recognize real when i write this
Never do it like this, Rattpack be the hypest
Goddamn can you feel it, hold up motherfucker let me kill it run it back like that
Got your back like chiroprac- hit you with the gat like brhha
Nah, never that, goddamn. Now they wonder who the man
I'mma sell a hundred thousand, first week by the man
V's up be the band, L-O-G-I-C that be the brand
From Maryland to the west fuck all the rest we connected
Took a while but we respected, now they know yeah

[Verse 3: King Chip]
I'm just looking for a reason to cut some people off
Zero tolerance, no hollering just piss'em off
This ain't no new year's resolution, nigga this all year
I'm trynna keep my circle tight cause nigga this our year
I'm extra cold flying through the no fly zone
44108 yeah that's that you can die zone
King Chip the coldest that you ever lay eyes on
It's a blessing for you haters to share my time zone

[Outro]
Building up my money, call it skyscraper paper[Verse 1: Demrick]
I’m always searching for the setup
Mother told her son “Boy better never let up"
I’ve been fed up, keep your head up, I'mma do this shit forever
Close my eyes watch letters come together, better
Than whoever died, they better never not, murk 'em on the spots
Swervin' on some shots, puffin' pot, this ain’t what you want
On the block, talk a lot, parking lot barber shop
So I’m in the studio groovin' in the ambiance
Try and be a Capitan, think you’ll be a happy man
Trash can competitions, send them in an ambulance
Taliban, contraband, bitch do the molly dance
Make it out without a chance, livin' down at Zombieland
My mind is all twisted I need a smoke
They hope I go over the edge without a vote
But nope, these quotes have overcome the impossible
Don’t think that they ain’t watching you, nobody’s safe

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
My pen is poisonous, secrete on your girlfriend’s orifice
Politic with God, said make love to a sorceress
Twist kush like a contortionist
Skimming through thesauruses to find the perfect synonym to slaughter shit
Yeah, I'm just tryna make a dollar, dear
Fucking foreign bitches for [?]
I’m Alfred Hitchcock on PCP
Spillin' vodka for my nigga restin' six feet deep
I’m a legend in the making, these other rappers are bacon bits
Too much time in the music, fuck up relationships
Bitch breathe, got chloroform on a handkerchief
Standing ovation, I spoke at the player’s banquet
Fuck wit' me cause you stuck with me
I give a shit about your two cents nigga, here catch a buck fifty
Underneath the bubble goose, a tool that’ll cut kidneys
We in this motherfucker, styrofoam cup with me

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe

[Verse 3: SwizZz]
See when I enter it's done, no more holding my tongue
I put an end to your fun, fuck the project, give up
Inhale the kush in my lungs, a couple hits and I'm straight
Either conform or get rolled over, stay the fuck out my way
Nobody's safe, watch what you say, control how you act
Your ambition might betray you and be the reason I snap
Or be the reason your pretty girlfriend is sending me snaps
Like I'm entertaining the thought of even message her back
Come on, I'm too centered to severe a happy home
Too crowded to be derailed so I'm focusing on my own
Just miss me with all the talking, the way I spit it is awesome
The people need me to boss it, I'm coming after the throne
The second time around we had to put it down the hardest
Setting the mark and raising stakes for these silly artists
Ask me for your feedback, my reply is garbage
You better come correct or turn into a fucking target

[Verse 4: Madchild]
Underground Kings, swing swords like we Turkish
The worst version of personal verse murkers
Spookiest nucliest kookiest conquest
So nobody’s safe like a nuclear bomb threat
Young De dabbed till his lungs full of crystals
We kung fu fist all these young tongue twisters
Very mental listen and say “The Demented"
Kill it on a Hoppa instrumental now with Jarren Benton
Aye, I am asshole Smurf
Money spread across the floor like it’s AstroTurf
I met a groupie, almost had a heart attack
Fucked her then I came in her face and called it an autograph

All black everything, just like paint
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East
I'm moving, I'm moving
East and the East and the killers in the West
Just get smoking
Why you fucking with stress?

[Verse 1: B Real]
Break in my line if you don't know the dock
Get in line, don't fuck around looking for my crop
Get dumb as the one that's the rise to the top
Product of Versace I'mma hit you with the Glock
Bitch we riding high, we keep stacking
Money like coats in closets, keep racking
Backs like Cali quakes, keep cracking
Skilled what the doctor know, what up with no slacking

[Hook: B Real]
All black everything, just like paint
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East
I'm moving, I'm moving
East and the East and the killers in the West
Just get smoking
Why you fucking with stress?

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Killer in the game and the one finna pop
So don't mind if I come around, spend a little guap
Snow been the chick, all these rap bitches jock
All these bum bitches, I'm the cream of the crop
Look I'm riding 'round, I been got it
Robbing these banks, these dudes, and these pockets
All of these hating bitches still watching
But I don't get no pay for no talking
Constant

[Hook: B Real]
All black everything, just like paint
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East
I'm moving, I'm moving
East and the East and the killers in the West
Just get smoking
Why you fucking with stress?

[Verse 3: Demrick]
Couple rolled up for the road
Hotbox any spot that I go
Yah
Steamed like a pot on the stove
Chase that with a shot of Patron
Fuck stacking my papers
But that just assesses I make it
I know boy it's coming
You don't like where I'm at
Then I know for a fact
People really hate what I'm becoming
I came in this game with a flow and a flame
Never go'n switch man the story's the same
Drinking this liquor, I fuck with my niggas
I always deliver, that's not gonna change
Ribs on a raise, tits on a frame
Jet fuel on a plane
Her ass is ridic, she grabbed on my stick
Trying drive me insane

[Hook: B Real]
All black everything, just like paint
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East
I'm moving, I'm moving
East and the East and the killers in the West
Just get smoking
Why you fucking with stress?It's all out war
It's all out war

Turn my hat to the back, left to the right
Step to the stage, press on the mic
Look in the crowd, get lost in the lights
This shit here's for the rest of your life
Tell me what you gonna say, how it's gonna feel
When you're finally reach in and go for the kill
Reality sets in, it's oh so real
Gotta keep it moving like a Oldsmobile
But wait, gotta form the troops
Case the perimeter and storm the roof
Let this shit here be the proof
A nigga told the truth just 'cuz he wore a suit
Didn't mean that he'd shoot when the war is on
Playin' for the other side all along
Gotta make it happen like fourth and long
'Cuz when the war is on, it's on

[Hook]
It's all out war
Some things are worth dying for
It's all out war
Tell me what are you fighting for
It's all out war, war, war, war
How much can you ignore
It's all out war, war, war, war
There can only be one winner
It's all out


Hat to the front, fight to the left
Gotta go hard 'til there ain't shit left
Used to focus on the block, but then I had to step
Came a long way from the days on the steps
Dangerous minds, it ain't safe
I'll keep it in the safe so you ain't safe
Heart of a slave, kill the owner
First it was Wash, now it's Arizona
We write for what we love
Word to the streets how I got to bust
Ain't no case, they ain't got the glove
Stone cold shot, I got the slug
Watch back on who's watching us
Binoculars, they tried stoppin' us
They tried knockin' us, but we're not the one's
Just forgot, you've got to flaunt

[Hook]
It's all out war
Some things are worth dying for
It's all out war
Tell me what are you fighting for
It's all out war, war, war, war
How much can you ignore
It's all out war, war, war, war
There can only be one winner
It's all out

Oh, oh, oh…

Gotta step to the podium, make the speech
They're runnin' wild, livin' off the leash
Shit gonna change when we take streets
Real motherf*ckers play for keeps
Got it on lock from A to Z
They're out there snitchin' to the agency
But all that talk don't mean a thing to me
Feel like the whole world got to explain to me
So I block, plan, words don't hurt
Like a shot can, say get down when I'm on cam
Try to play me out, nigga, no chance
Rememberin' the days when I sold grams
No I won't go with your program
Gotta stand up, I'm my own man
Own pride, on time, all mine

[Hook]
It's all out war
Some things are worth dying for
It's all out war
Tell me what are you fighting for
It's all out war, war, war, war
How much can you ignore
It's all out war, war, war, war
There can only be one winner
It's all out[Hook: Demrick]
Niggas got a lot to say, I’m ok with that
Just stay out my way, we don’t play with that (No, no, no)
I came from around the way, I got away with that
So roll me another, we gone smoke them things back to back, back to back

[Verse 1: Demrick]
I been smoking for a week, man I’m loaded
I’ve been noted, I’ve been quoted as the coldest nigga flowing
Never slowing down for nothing, fuck it, got to keep it going
We on stage for the night, got a flight in the morning
Like damn, got to thank god for a new day
I used to clean my Vans up with toothpaste
Now I got fans and my plans in a suitcase
Shit I been in Japan drinking 40s with a couple bad shorties
Asked em do you want to orgy and that’s real shit
Imma let you deal with it for me
Jet fuel fly, let the raw papers burn up
Ain’t concerned much, I’m all about the turn up
Thinking back on the blocks where I served up
People talking like there’s places that I can’t come back to
I can say that’s natural, they gone get at you
When you doing what they can’t do

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
Contemplating my next move
Cause when they want what you got they don’t respect you
And they show it every time their mouths are open
That they hoping that we throw in the towel, but now we soaking in sun rays
Washington Heights, the whole city riding
Now we the shit to them same hoes that shitted on us
Sipping so much champagne we got liver problems
All these women rushing the stage like they was little mama
Venezuelan kid from the upper
I learned how to be a man from the strength of my mother
My team a family, we giving thanks to each other
She give me good pussy, I’m a bad motherfucker
On my second passport, and it’s half full
I’m in a hotel gym doing back rolls
I ain’t lost my drive at all, I hit the back roads
And now I’m back at these cats’ throats, brrrt

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lunar C]
All my moneys off the books, no one’s taxing that shit
The only check I ever signed were titties in Europe
Talk off and you might see why you rappers ain't like me
Swinging but none of your punches are landing that Tai Chi
I write rhymes, burn weed, then fuck mouths
I count the money while your girl keeps the look out
The tour's into the third week I'm run down
But I'll be going hard till my work visa runs out
A bit hyperactive when I don’t smoke
I flip at motherfuckers random like freestyle gymnastics
I like my lasses thick like molasses
Yeah, dumb fat bitches is what I find attractive
Got this beat from Hoppa, smoking swishers in the Gold Coast
You was at home on your sofa eating cold toast
Almost made it, probably won’t make it back
As long as I get paid off this shit, I’m okay with that

[Hook][Intro]
Do you want to get high?
Does everybody want to get high?
I want to get high!

[Hook]
Blunts, dabs, joints, slabs
Vape, clouds, loud, gas, puff, pass
Grow, stash, quarters, halfs, pounds, bags
Blowing money fast, I be blowing money fast
I be blowing money fast, I be blowing money fast

[Verse 1: Demrick]
Got a zip, it’s the gas take a trip
Put the flame to the glass, take a dab feel the hit
I’ma stack it to the ceiling til there’s millions in the stash
Went from nick bags on the Ave., now I'm out in Amsterdam
Add it up like mathematicians, all my bad decisions verse my ambition
This is repetition, you can see the difference
I rep it for the have nots, Strippers with them mad shots
Pimps push a product out that Pontiac Ragtop
Spend it like I print it like that shit just been invented
This the gold rush, I'm something like the gold crush with it
On that marijuana marathon, Me more than a carry on
Jet fuel very strong, Ha I last very long

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Scoop Deville]
Time piece all around the world
See me with your girl, On her knees, got 12
Hundred freaks in the penthouse, watch me give a fuck
Next day we hop off the tour bus, hit the gas
Burn a half into ashes, boss
Hoes that flip like gymnastics, applause
Don't worry bout how I get mine, get yours
By the time I hit the stage it's jam backed to the doors
[?], I'm a grown man, gold chain, light it up like Las Vegas
MGM, shout out to my partners lock down in the pen
I'ma do this one for y'all, they just wanna see me win
9 times out of 10, Smoke down in the big body benz
With your girlfriend, creme dela creme
Juice, gin, life is too short
Getting ends, Make sure you get yours, cause this man got his

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B-Real]
I be blowing money, honey dripping
Blowing trees, you be blowing reggie
You be willing knowing me, we hit the gas
Doctors orders when we rolling
Now your pockets getting thinner
But you came in with them swollen (What you holding)
Dabs up, blunts down, I put a slab on it
Doesn't matter nails hot put a dab on it
Grams melting by the second for the hell of it
You thirsty ass bitches magnetize for the smell of it
Flipping rigs like it's nothing big, no spill
Let the rig hit the ground, glass breaks big deal
Triple flipper in the sky, why you asking why
Scoop called the doctor and he said (I want to get high!)
Milky hits, water bubble, lungs blow up
I'm the duke of errl, baby pouring shatter like it's syrup
Wrap her, then a white girl, lights swirl, glass tip
Pussy's can't hang, lights out, catnip

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Berner]
Sandro Pay, creme brulee and mimosa's
Yellow hash, wax hits, ash tray 20 roaches
Thousand dollar glass, yeah i'm first class toasting, to the good life
In my S-Class Benz floating, ask Demrick how I get down
I grew up by the ocean, where the pounds go for cheap
And them local girls are hoeing, they asked me where i'm going
To the top with this bass shit, new strain alert
Here you go taste it, you know we get the paper
Jars with the different flavors, wiz khalifa papers
Hardcore, trippy vapors, you got a bitch to pay ya
All my girls are money makers, I'm in Jamaica
Drug money on my kitchen table, blowing

[Hook]

(I want to get high!)[Hook]
Everybody's gettin' high
Everybody's gettin' high
Everybody's gettin' high (we get high) x 6
Everybody's gettin' high (we get high)(Don't forget the weed though)

[Verse 1: Slaine]
He's been sniffing since 15, smoking since 14
Never could piss clean, existed on morphine
Twisted endorphines, [?]
Tongue in the hallway, Weening off things
[?] his offspring, Weezing and coughing
From the weed he's breathing, he's believing in nothing
Cause everyone is gettin' high in this city, dope crushed down, fold the numbers, down a crisp fifty
Joey downtown boosted with his bitch Christy
Need a fix, gotta hustle [?]
Smoke a spliff, [?]
Getting high with a boombox, saying he missed biggie
[?]Kid's get sniffy, Sluts on ecstasy, my ex Stacy texts me saying she just missed me
[?]
The whole blocks fucked up with a rough history

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Demrick]
Yah, at my uncles with a j in a roach clip, told me go ahead boy take a hit
[?]
I was up, I seen everybody smoking, I seen everybody [?]
Bitch I fuckin' wish she on that cocaine diet
I ain't biased but I never tried it
Far as weed goes, known to roll with the most highest
Molle [?] got me rolling like 4 tires
Mushrooms have my head in the sky with no pilot
My homie dropped LSD  in my 40, said don't  fight it
Nigga have one hell of a night, that's no lying
Grandma's medicine cabinet was on another planet
Grab a couple reds, couple whites, couple blues
It's the American way, how come I never knew
Get them things off back at school for the revenue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slaine]
This is the place where I see my demons, where they haunt me at
I try to leave, go away, they always want me back
My neighborhood is where the real life zombies at
Just seen Johnny noddin' off down at the laundry mat
My uncle's got sober, but my auntie's [?]
Trying to pawn a mattress she stole out of Johnny's backpack
She's a thief, the pills affect her speech
She's clean inside the can, that's until she get's released

[Verse 4: Demrick]
We all got addictions so who are you to judge
Acting like you never caught a buzz, Shit the whole world high
Just make sure it ain't your own supply, I seen too many get spun like some old 45s
[?]two shots of Jameson for a flight
If you lookin' for a nigga, it's hard to find me sober
If you're looking some drugs, go ahead and invite me over cause...

[Hook][Chorus: Demrick]

Ive been dreaming so long, shit became real
Livin' life so fast, burn a tire off the wheel
You got so much to say right now, but its fuck how you feel
Cuz I've been doing me so long, you already know the deal
Imma young'n steady gleamin
Young'n steady gleamin (3x)
Steady gleamin
Young'n steady gleamin (3x)
Yea, Yea


[Verse 1: Demrick]

Im too ready, my crew deadly
My kush heavy, My new chevy, got rims on it
Got ten on it, for this rap game ive been wantin'
Ive been called that im next level
Keep an eye out for that bullshit
Choose wisely who you move with
Im Ron Isley on the smooth shit
Hit the 'woof and I lose it
Black out, act out, studio my crackhouse
Serve em up 'til I max out fuck a bitch throw her back out
She wanna be where the ballers at
Shit so old like artifacts
Thats why i don't never call her back
She know all that where the clubs at where the drugs at
Where the fucks at, where the loves at
Who the tight end who the quarterback
I touchdown, you run it back
See the scoreboard? Im on tour, got more whores on all fours
Than you niggas throwin out a hundred racks


[Chorus]


[Verse 2: Demrick]

You know its real, I overkill
I overshine, this is overdrive
And over time, theyll all see
If i my heart beatin, we all eatin
All season we all stars
Them chuck taylors nigga fuck failure
Theyll try to tell you lifes too hard
But big buds in my kush jar
Keep me relaxed so i dont trip
Roll with those and know to go get
Pocket filled with empty promises
Cuz you tricked it all on my old bitch
If you dont got nothing you dont get nothing
Ive been you something you been frontin
You lust at bitches ive been fuckin'
No chain but ive been stuntin
We out'chea allowed where you get no waxes
Game time this is no practice
Like a new pussy on a old mattress
My flow classic I can't stop I won't quit
Feel like puffy way back in '96
Pullin' up in something gorgeous
Next stop is that Forbes' list


[Chorus: Demrick][Verse 1]
I just landed in Vegas
From the home of the Lakers
Crap tables trying to break us
These hoes keep trying to take us
This life is so contagious
She want a nigga with some acres
A house and a car, a tab at the bar
A star stepping off these stages
We live that life and I did that right
Tell the haters, better not bite
We high like a red-eye flight
She wanna get it on the very first night
And I told her we good to go
I come from the hood, you know
I'mma break it down
Turn that ass 'round
Girl you shoulda known...

[Bridge]
Bad than a motherfucker
Damn...
Damn...
Damn...
Said girl I wanna take you home tonight...
Damn...

[Hook]
I love the way that booty go down
Girl, what you doing, girl what you doing
I love the way you work it out
Girl, what you doing, do it now
She 'bout to go in
Go in, go in, go in
And it's on, she 'bout to go in
I love the way you put it down

[Verse 2]
It's six o'clock in the morning
She on it, I know she want it
Liquor in the cup, feelin' fucked up
Room keep spinning, gotta hold the walls up
I'mma knock it out like a heavyweight fight
T.K.O., call me Teddy for the night
She ready for the night, Teddy fit it right
Body looking good, make me wanna take a bite
And you know I will cause you like that
And I know get these J's rolled before I night cap
I see you, freak in the sheets, like I beast on beats
Boat catcher flow and the headboards screech
Stripes on my chest like a triple OG
Access to the place cause you keep it low-key

[Bridge]
[Hook][Verse 1: B-Real]
So many nights, many lights in my growth room
So many heights, taking flights while we hit the bloom
Started up a couple plans blowing up the block
Best in the west couldn't keep my shit in stock
Everytime I haul is buying off a cop
Buying off a block, Greenthump rising to the top
They ask who got the product
Just tell them Green done brought it
They understand quality over profit
I'm the top of the topic
They got the fuel if you want it
Take you to Paris or Florence
And I can [?]
And if you fuck with me, fuck it
We can thuggin' and take it
Any level invaders so all you bitches can say

[Hook: Demrick]-[X2]
I'll pass it to the left, put it in rotation
Never loose a step
All this paper that I'm chasing
All I see it green
And I'mma keep it blazing
Smoke you out with these kush coversations

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Pass it to the left, that's the realest hit
But when you roll it put on a funky feel tip
That's how we smokers do
You know we smoke a few
Silly bitches man you know it ain't promotional
Don't get emotional
I'm coasting so you know the best
Shout out to my partners
Snoop, Berner, Courtesy and Wiz
Man I see you Dizzy, you get the cover soon
Red and Meth come on, put me in How High 2
My family smokes the best
Represent from east to west
You know we roll the kush
Inhale and let it fill your chest
Blowing out your lungs, save for the flavor rookie
Let's call the cookie monster
Roll it up with [?]'s pussy
Let's have a conversation blazing up the medication
Sorry if I'm spacing is a former meditation
It's called the high life
Breath and get your mind right
You see me shine bright, metal fuckin' highlight

[Hook][Intro: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, Jarren
I ain't gonna say my last name nigga, you know what it is (say your last name nigga)
DJ mother fucking Hoppa
Your DJ ain't no DJ
He just hit the instant replay, nigga

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Bitch I break the law of gravity ain't no way that Jarren's falling off
I write like my hand's possessed, I had to gnaw that fucker off
Scared of what, all you niggas soft that I come across
Bust out this fucking straight jacket and bite the buckle off
Old school Corvette, colored as mustard sauce
I speak a different language, fuck discussions with y'all
I para sail the Mediterranean
Your bullets couldn't penetrate the god, my skeleton's titanium
Crazy as a Tasmanian Israelian
Now watch you lame niggas hang from a noose with your feet dangling
Rappers need strangling, I punch out of a pine box
And leap out of the bowels of the devil, subterranean
I fell out of love with that bitch called Hip Hop
Freezer full of rapper's arteries in a Ziploc
Fuck off and kick rocks you fuckers don't get props
I get my dick sucked while I'm bumping Kid Rock

[Hook: Demrick] (x2)
This the shit that you don't know about
You don't live this
Kick the door in at your momma's house
Leave no witness
You a killer or a motormouth
There's a difference
Niggas ride for what they all about
Till it's finished

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
I'm not a killer but don't push me, we all have our limits
Your foolish actions are dictated by the drinks you sippin'
And that's gonna leave you in a bad position
A drunk tongue bred bad intentions and I'm ready to get this over with
Fuck your corporate ties and phoney biz
Purpose and content we got more to give
And more to offer, useful verb, I'm not a fast talker
When I'm done she'll have bad posture she'll be stumbling and walking awkward
I ain't here to satisfy your vices
And I will not be the comfort to cushion your lonely nights with
I turn them on, light switch, I turn them off, light switch
I'm mixed like decisions but the flow is so decisive
We are not enticed by the life you glamorize
That's your ego in disguise I will quickly testify
There's no love for impostors
Shout out to Brass Knuckle Benton, Demrick and my valley pal DJ Hoppa

[Hook: Demrick] (x2)[Intro]
I love that stuff, been drinking it for years

[Verse 1]
Make way for the new leaders
That mix Belvedere with the two liters
The roll through cheaters in them two seaters
Cooking up classic albums with a few features
I lay vocals on pro tools and v-necks and bow shoes I call LA local
My beatin' mama's like the side-aid tofu
We don't valet, we roll through, to see if it's necessarry
Might need a secretary, my presence is legendary
Niggas pickin' flees like a veterinary
I'm lookin' for a queen I could probably marry
I always had a thing for a Halley Berry
Want the ice and the cream like Ben & Jerry's
Livin' high like real check the commentary

[Hook]
The necessary day shit, yup
The necessary day shit
All my life, that's all I know
All my diamonds break to gold
Man, this rap shit saved my soul
That's why I never give it up

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna sound ungrateful
Cause God gave me what I prayed for
But when yo flow stay all volcano
Hoes take ya down like drain-o, it's hard to say no
I got a passion for hard fashion
Chick in spandex pants with the fat asses
You know I love to roll up, puff, pass it
Put it up in the air like a pump action
And I'm tired of the pump faking
Pass off if you can't make it
I'm too hot to hold these two shots of more
I 2Pac my soul, I'm too off the road to steer clear from problems
Young and livin' lawless
Mad cause I get mine regardless

[Hook]
The necessary day shit, yup
The necessary day shit
All my life, that's all I know
I won't never save these hoes
Get fade in the play you close
That's why I never give it up

[Outro][Verse 1: MadChild]
I spit ferocious fireballs, the kids are all excited
I pour petroleum on your linoleum and light it
On a podium, I'm causing pandemonium
Sodium and nitrate, second greatest rapper in the white race
Might've been the spider venom, might've been the snake bite
Fuck with me and find out what a metal pipe will taste like
I'm explosive like a molotov cocktail
Lyrics get around the kids quick like fuckin' hotmail
Involuntarily, solitary confinement
I've no one to confide in, quiet in my environment
Mentally, I'm way off balance and off kilter
Brains, we ought to wack - that's why I rap without a filter
Perverted matador, I tackle bulls and try to mount 'em
So many personalities, don't bother trying to count 'em
My life is a crazy rollercoaster, call me Magic Mountain
I'm throwing boulders, they're exploding - mouth's a fuckin' fountain

[Hook 1: MadChild]
I'm mental
That's just the way that it goes, dog
Canadian but you could keep the rain and the snowballs
I love palm trees, sitting in the sunshine
Learning quick - my rhymes, they are ridiculously sublime
Stupid shit, but the way that I combine
My wordplay, smartest rapper out with a dumb mind
Sometimes I kind of miss the clouds and the rain
Cause that's what helped me get the blues, MadChild is proudly insane

[Verse 2: MadChild]
I went from backpack, to snapbacks, to lab rats on acid
Spit anthrax, the band's back, this man's raps are massive
Completely gone bananas, whipping up within bonanza
Short like Dan DeVito, still the boss like Tony Danza
Now stick your damn hands up, this here is a robbery
Hobblin' like a goblin and my brain is a little wobbly
I'm probably the height of a hobbit that's hobnobbin' in Oz
With a couple wonderful wizards, I've got problems
The plot thickens, I'm stuck up in the mud again
Utterly disgusting when I'm muttering my foot up in your anal hole
It's unexplainable cause I'm the awesomest
Blossom from a possum, stick my cock down your esophagus
Narcissist, I'm also an arsonist from an orphanage
Cock is way too big for my body, it's unproportionate
Morph into a profitable author, Mad's a novelist
Of course I'm still a mess and I'm depressed, it's probably obvious

[Hook 2: MadChild]
I'm fuckin' mental
That's just the way that it goes, dog
Canadian but you could keep the rain and the snowballs
I love palm trees, sitting in the sunshine
Learning quick - my rhymes, they are ridiculously sublime
Stupid shit, but the way that I combine
My wordplay, smartest rapper out with a dumb mind
Sometimes I kind of miss the clouds and the rain
Cause that's what helps me get the blues, MadChild is proudly insane

[Verse 3: Demrick]
I lost my mind a long time ago
Hot with the rhyming though
Fall in line like dominos
Light it up, vamanos
My flow is all kind of dope
Something like a line of coke
Streets is cold, go and grab my heater, that's my kind of coat
Rain, hell, sleet, or snow
Shit you never know but to each his own
Pops back from prison, guess the preach is on
Watch your tone, Battleaxe Warriors are not alone
Smoke a zone, to the dome
I can't leave this life alone
Murder on this microphone
Living in a Cali daze
Get familiar, this serial killer is in his final phase
And my path ain't bathe, every brick is laid
Fuck it, I'm paid
Light a j and just fade away
Fuck what they say, I ain't listening
Son, I'm like a christening
Keep it rolling like Michelin
You don't know shit about positions that I've been up in
Vent again, grind for the benefit
You want to see the end of it

[Hook 2][Verse 1: Demrick]
I’m always searching for the setup
Mother told her son “Boy better never let up"
I’ve been fed up, keep your head up, I'mma do this shit forever
Close my eyes watch letters come together, better
Than whoever died, they better never not, murk 'em on the spots
Swervin' on some shots, puffin' pot, this ain’t what you want
On the block, talk a lot, parking lot barber shop
So I’m in the studio groovin' in the ambiance
Try and be a Capitan, think you’ll be a happy man
Trash can competitions, send them in an ambulance
Taliban, contraband, bitch do the molly dance
Make it out without a chance, livin' down at Zombieland
My mind is all twisted I need a smoke
They hope I go over the edge without a vote
But nope, these quotes have overcome the impossible
Don’t think that they ain’t watching you, nobody’s safe

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
My pen is poisonous, secrete on your girlfriend’s orifice
Politic with God, said make love to a sorceress
Twist kush like a contortionist
Skimming through thesauruses to find the perfect synonym to slaughter shit
Yeah, I'm just tryna make a dollar, dear
Fucking foreign bitches for [?]
I’m Alfred Hitchcock on PCP
Spillin' vodka for my nigga restin' six feet deep
I’m a legend in the making, these other rappers are bacon bits
Too much time in the music, fuck up relationships
Bitch breathe, got chloroform on a handkerchief
Standing ovation, I spoke at the player’s banquet
Fuck wit' me cause you stuck with me
I give a shit about your two cents nigga, here catch a buck fifty
Underneath the bubble goose, a tool that’ll cut kidneys
We in this motherfucker, styrofoam cup with me

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe

[Verse 3: SwizZz]
See when I enter it's done, no more holding my tongue
I put an end to your fun, fuck the project, give up
Inhale the kush in my lungs, a couple hits and I'm straight
Either conform or get rolled over, stay the fuck out my way
Nobody's safe, watch what you say, control how you act
Your ambition might betray you and be the reason I snap
Or be the reason your pretty girlfriend is sending me snaps
Like I'm entertaining the thought of even message her back
Come on, I'm too centered to severe a happy home
Too crowded to be derailed so I'm focusing on my own
Just miss me with all the talking, the way I spit it is awesome
The people need me to boss it, I'm coming after the throne
The second time around we had to put it down the hardest
Setting the mark and raising stakes for these silly artists
Ask me for your feedback, my reply is garbage
You better come correct or turn into a fucking target

[Verse 4: Madchild]
Underground Kings, swing swords like we Turkish
The worst version of personal verse murkers
Spookiest nucliest kookiest conquest
So nobody’s safe like a nuclear bomb threat
Young De dabbed till his lungs full of crystals
We kung fu fist all these young tongue twisters
Very mental listen and say “The Demented"
Kill it on a Hoppa instrumental now with Jarren Benton
Aye, I am asshole Smurf
Money spread across the floor like it’s AstroTurf
I met a groupie, almost had a heart attack
Fucked her then I came in her face and called it an autograph
Told you that right after I nut I won’t call you
West coast Bax-War killers with Funk Volume
Angry, I’m bady, a Gladiator mayne
We are hungry, salivate with alligator fangs
I’m from an asylum, wild tribal and violent
Won’t catch me sleeping I sliced both of my eyelids
I’m vibrant, vampire and Lycan, a hybrid
White like I’m Rye bread and write like a tyrant

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps

It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace

[Verse 2: Demrick]


[Verse 3: Futuristic]
Yo, WTF gang in this motherfucker
Yo, it's my kind of talk, okay
Futuristic in this bitch, even the deaf say that they heard me
Arizona's finest, spreading through the college, just like herpes
Nasty coming at me, it's dangerous like open heart surgery
Talking shit, get you banned for life, Donald Sterling
Only fuck with two or three, I'm shining like jewelry
Flow is colder than ice cream, they got tatted on Gucci's cheek
Stop it with the foolery, all dudes is on that same old
You got a lot of squares up in your circle like a eggo
Chopping it local on the come up with the words I never run out I be getting shit done
Ten million views on my YouTube
Every a thousand I let your ass get one
What's the ratio? You lazy bro, I got a track with Layzie Bone
Your lady knows, I give her that fellatio
You got beef, lil nigga, fillet mignon
Dash like Stacy, you need to switch careers, like Tracy McGrady
I could have a bitch beat you up, in the elevator, like Jay-Z
I'm running this game, if you get in my way
You get jumped like a hurdle
I'm killing these tracks and then Imma ask
Did I do that? Like my name's Steve Urkel, yeah

[Verse 4: Young Markk][Hook: x2]
I'm building up my money, call it skyscraper paper
I got models, I got strippers, I got bitches I'm a player
I'm in that residential, waving hi to my neighbors
Then I'm on that next flight saying bye to my neighbors

[Verse 1: Demrick]
I made it outta my hood
I know some niggas wish I was back there
That's why old friends is just old friends
I'm in chuck taylors with a low brim
Got my old Tims and my North Face
From the old days in that cold place
Now it's rose and good kush
California living on my sole face
I got no shame, from the nose bleeds to the center stages at long way
How I got here? Niggas want to act like it's not fair
Just cause I know millionaires who know billionaires
Cause i'm a thousandaire who trynna get there
I used food stamps to fill the fridgidaire
Now it's weekend trips up to big bear
I got a swimming pool in my backyard
Couple pitbulls in my backyard
Couple bitches in bikinis, barbecues what the fuck were you doing? You finally get a backyard
Been in Australia, New Zealand, all of Europe in the last month
I could use this fuel that's in that blunt
Smoke it to the head don't pass once
And I know my neighbors upset, cause we ain't been to sleep yet
We playing these beats on repeat for a week and i'm just warming up as a heat jack
And we don't get a reset, so I'm doing this shit without a regret
She say she wanna stay and get her feet wet
But I'm diving in to the deep end, better reach in

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 2: Logic]
Recognize real when i write this
Never do it like this, Rattpack be the hypest
Goddamn can you feel it, hold up motherfucker let me kill it run it back like that
Got your back like chiroprac- hit you with the gat like brhha
Nah, never that, goddamn. Now they wonder who the man
I'mma sell a hundred thousand, first week by the man
V's up be the band, L-O-G-I-C that be the brand
From Maryland to the west fuck all the rest we connected
Took a while but we respected, now they know yeah

[Verse 3: King Chip]
I'm just looking for a reason to cut some people off
Zero tolerance, no hollering just piss'em off
This ain't no new year's resolution, nigga this all year
I'm trynna keep my circle tight cause nigga this our year
I'm extra cold flying through the no fly zone
44108 yeah that's that you can die zone
King Chip the coldest that you ever lay eyes on
It's a blessing for you haters to share my time zone

[Outro]
Building up my money, call it skyscraper paper[Verse 1]
Where that champagne at?
Yeah, we trying to get faded
Tell the DJ put us in rotation
Motherfuck that playlist
These 808s knock, shit's ignorant, the hoes flock
Getting paper just don’t stop
So we're never watching that clock
She back it up and then drop
It's nasty, and I like it
She down to ditch her side kick
Just to be my side chick
I’m addicted to all that fly shit
You know chains, watches, cars, houses
I ain’t get it off of these ounces
I got it all from clubs bouncing
And bein' crazy enough to need counseling
We standing up on these couches
Our whole section is clownin'
We made it off of our talents
And it wasn’t even a challenge
All this liquor I’m downing
Got me bout to lose my balance

[Hook]
Said we ok, just mix a little bit of vodka with that OJ
Throwing shots of patron, we on man they was foreplay
Cause we about to turn it up
Tell the dj turn it up
Cause we don’t give a fuck
And that’s wassup, wassup, yeah that’s wassup
That’s wassup, wassup, yeah that’s wassup
That’s wassup, wassup, yeah that’s wassup
You getting paid, well go and do your thang
(x2)

[Verse 2]
All about that life, found out tonight how you really roll
Man that ain’t your wife, just gotta let that go
These hoes choosin', who are you to try to stop
Chase down the profit then you ain’t got to worry bout it
They like Prada, Louie, Gucci, Fendi
Niggas ridin' in them Bentleys, they got bitches, oh so many
That’s why I’m doin' me, livin' cool
I don’t like to make shit difficult
But we wild out, act a fool, party startin' in the afternoon
We twistin' up, hittin high, she like to roll, got her own supply
Put that away, we smokin' mine
In this club I pay the fine
Take a drink this ain’t no wine
This is red cups with lean inside
We have a good time so be advised
When you rollin' out with me and mines

[Hook][Verse 1: Berner]
I'm dizzy, F1 got the room pissy
Good smoke in my lungs, drunk bitch don't kiss me
Fresh picked, still sticky, but it burn right
I'm everythang that your girl like
I went from trimmin' to swimmin' in beaches
From Puerto Rican and Dominican girls, with no Visas
Light the reefer, pass it to the left
I told her hold it in
Let it burn to the end and we'll smoke again
My flip-flops Gucci, in my crib watch movies
In my own home theatre, with three or four groupies
Lobster roll, hot Saké with the sushi
Flip coke money, in the rap game
They wanna prosecute me
A couple tried to shoot me, let me live player, let me get paper
Three Xanax bars, that's a mind eraser
All the money and cars, I got all kinds of haters

[Hook: Berner]
I don't ever sip alone
Xanax and Patron, I don't remember gettin' home
Xanax and Patron, I don't ever sleep alone
Xanax and Patron, I don't remember gettin' home
Xanax and Patron

[Verse 2: B-Real]
When you're in the Dam, Better think about (kosher?)
Bitches passin' out at the Green House
Take a hit, lights out at the hash bar
On the floor eyes open, what you ask for?
Smoke everywhere, now ya need the Doctor
Air lifted, elevated, hellicopta'
Don't be comin' with no rookie lungs in the Dam
Don't be pumpin' up your chest like you're goin' H.A.M
Got ya flyin' into the E.R, first class
Got ya tappin' in a minute, first [dance?]
When the thrust lasts, like a blast from a dab hit
Bern's in flight for the [slab?], bitch
From the herb, maybe shrub, then to shatter
Maybe hardcore, settin' off the high in the brain matter
In my shot glass, fire water
Berner got the Xanny
Lights out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Demrick]
She let us pop those, and I got those
I'm a two boss star, I [move got fo?]
[All the games?], mix Patron, with champagne
Got me chillin' in the zone, like I'm gone on the plane
Yeah I wanna catch a fade
So I call my homie Berner, when he said he'll put me on, in the Bay
Breakin' cookies on the tray
Glass tips, Raw Papers when I twist, you ain't fuckin' with my day
Shit, it's just another day
Turn to a goodnight and it's goodnight for ya right away
All ya first top dabbers, we high like ladders
When ya really get money, mane shit don't matter

[Hook][Hook]
16 ounces in a pound, break it down, break it down
24 hours goes around and around
Inside the ride everybody get loud
Sitting up on a cloud looking down at the crowd
Wanna know what's going on with kids these days
We just smoke, we just drink, we just get paid
We don't give a fuck what anybody say
We just smoke, we just drink, we just get paid

[Verse 1]
I'm not to be fucked with I hustled out of my bucket
I keep my dreams in my clutches I roll my weed up with crutches
You ain't talking about money then it's not my discussion
Down this road to success on my path to destruction
Game didn't come with instructions, I travel light with no luggage
Not the type to hold grudges I want a life with no budget
Wanna pull up in something new, right on the avenue
Where I spent every afternoon, serving them after schools
Say get your degree, but that wasn't for me
They was talking about a future that I just couldn't see
Hotboxing my ride, I'm leaving no room to breathe
Just try and catch me a vibe, staying away from police
Wanna pull out the crib, put my name on the lease
Trying to get me a meal right in the belly of the beast
What I've learned in these streets is what I write on these sheets
So what you know about me is everything that I see

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If we ain't fighting we fucking, if we ain't fucking we fighting
Instead of keeping it cool we choose to keep it exciting
Others trying to convince, a nigga not making sense
Wanna push [?] but that don't move me an inch
Had me lasso the bench when I go hard as the starters
Never be like my father I plan on taking this farther
Say this game will make you crazy, shit it's probably true
But I ain't following you, no one belongs to these shoes
A head hard as gristle ass is soft as a pillow
She go off like a pistol I love a bitch with some issues
What's keeping it simple, some kush in my mental
A dope instrumental or being caught in the middle
The other people's bullshit, I'm not trying to hear it
Why you judging my lyrics, trying to fuck with my spirit
Load a bong and clear it cause I'm not even worried
I'ma get mine in time, shit I'm not in a hurry

[Hook][Hook: Demrick]
We smoke a lot with the clouds up above us
To the day that I'm laying in my grave only God he can judge us
This life is a bitch so you might as well fuck her
Let me read I lived how I wanted
And yeah they gon' love it

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I make up and bake up and ask God is he gon' wash me from all of my sins
Drinking this Henn' every night gon' fuck me up one day, I just hope I don't fall for the trends
But I got my own style from the clouds flown down, zoned out, boy she rapping
Put the song out, get onstage just to get offstage and get domed out
Pretty little thing, Rastafari' she claim, got out school and we changed
Don't worry about what they sayin', they just say what they say but they the ones paying
We just paint the artwork, they can just the product but not the hard work
They don't see what we see behind the scenes so we focus and meditate on how to breathe
Now I'm baby momma drama free with the economy the future's bright
So I push my folks to be motivated, respect your life and catch some flights
We got moves to make, who moving with me, inhale the smoke until the truth is in me
Pick your battles and who you choose to envy, no matter who's against me

[Hook: Demrick]
We smoke a lot with the clouds up above us
To the day that I'm laying in my grave only God he can judge us
This life is a bitch so you might as well fuck her
Let me read I lived how I wanted
And yeah they gon' love it
We smoke a lot with the clouds up above us
To the day that I'm laying in my grave only God he can judge us
This life is a bitch so you might as well fuck her
Let me read I lived how I wanted
And yeah they gon' love it

[Vere 2: Demrick]
I'm just tryna survive, no lie, hustle till I [?]
Momma can I get the [?], throw it to the vultures, show no love and you know why
I can't see it no other way, light me a J, live for the day
Fuck what they say because tomorrow's not promised, I'm not Nostradamus, look what I've accomplished
I'm pathing my way, back against a wall, I guess I'm looking for a way out
Hotbox in the spot, get baked out, haters watching my moves like a stakeout
Eat the pussy like takeout, know she gon' love that, fifth of Hennessey and weed, where the buzz at
But I don't do much else, I got everything in this world but help
And I never had a plan B, I did this for my family's sakes
Fuck the Grammy awards, just put me on tour with some floorspace, let me get my story straight
I got a lot to say and just a little time left, my mind said it's a lot to digest
[?] from outta the projects, I got one question nigga, are you high yet?

[Hook: Demrick]
We smoke a lot with the clouds up above us
To the day that I'm laying in my grave only God he can judge us
This life is a bitch so you might as well fuck her
Let me read I lived how I wanted
And yeah they gon' love itEnjoy your high, girl...
Everything's better when you're faded, baby

We high as shit, and you fine as shit
Smokin' on that designer shit
She go nuts when i pass the piff
So don't cuff if she tryna flip
Hot-boxin' when we in the whip
Got big kush clouds right behind the tint
So much smoke, need oxygen
I got so much stroke, she got to swim
Her ass so dumb, she don't know no better
Out in Cali with the good green and no cold weather
5 13's and my Polo sweater
Said her friend wanna smoke, so we finna go get her

Let's go...
She already got one rolled...
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled

Enjoy your high, girl...
Everything's better when you're faded, baby
Enjoy your high, girl...
Ain't nobody here gon' judge you, baby

Cause ain't nobody on trial
No car, my name ain't on file
Still cop my sacks from the weed-man
I need two O's just for the weekend
I'm gettin' on what she peekin'
We goin' over that deep end
Just like the high, we creepin'
Relax and let it all sink in
We young, havin' fun, it can't get no better
Feelin' so good so we down for whatever
We all know that we won't live for forever
So tonight, let's say we in this together

Let's go...
She already got one rolled...
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled
I love a girl that love to smoke
She always keep me one rolled

Enjoy your high, girl...
Everything's better when you're faded, baby
Enjoy your high, girl...
Ain't nobody here gon' judge you, baby

I love a girl that love to smoke (enjoy your high, girl)
I love a girl that love to smoke (everything's better when you're faded)
