[Hook]
I hate college but love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to class, I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesnt mean im looking for somebody
Some say they drink blaze up, but hardly
Poppin' PK's, ski a little bit of molly
Am I out my mind most people say probably
But I've been on my grind puffin' nugs of that cali, collie

[Verse 1]
Pack my bag no parents didn't drop me off
I felt lost saw some herbs all wearing Lacoste
Couple dudes in pinnies musta played lacrosse
Grabbed my duffle and I hustled through the dormitory doors
Of course my homie lived on the same floor
Soon to blow trees and down to pound Coors
Down to pound whores, out of time though
Flow the better up to the whole town oooh
I hate college but love getting laid
Socialite swagger at night when the sun fades
Check my sun shades talking about upgrades
I can't see the haters no more I feel great
My eyes 20/20 so sunny when skies gray
I'm loved by the honies what more can I say
I'm just getting paid working like a slave
Between school athletics and music its all day
So invite your friends to come play
Gave you the invite if you miss it don't complain
If you lucky get a kiss but miss no that's lame
Wanna get it in with wizzy, I'm your man
Sweating bullets no fan can contain
Short to pull it, but quick to amaze
I'm looking forward to tours in these planes
Seeing the cork popping from bottles of champagne
Dear lord taking your name in vain
All these sins in college that I made
Well well my game's off the chain
I last a couple hours tomorrow go insane

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep cause my god damn teach keeps assigning essays
Due at the end of each week
But little do they know I got a show by the beach
Watching girls flash Wizzy way more than their teeth
They mad I'd rather learn flows than their lesson plans
But sit me down asking do you get the message Sam?
This is your life and you're in school to get right
Nah, music is my sun and you blocking my light
And if I don't blow get high and ignite
My life full of lines so my money gets nice
Well money's not happiness, you'll only get greedier
But shit it'd make life a whole lot easier
And my field gets a whole lot cheesier
Dominos bread but still getting meatier
But schools good for one thing I must add
And that's having a plethora of my vocab
Whole bags of verbs that I must grab
And throw down like a rich girls bar tab

[Hook][Hook: Niykee Heaton]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Now I just feel like I'm gonna win
Whole mid-west side, that's my kin
Beneath your beautiful that's my pen
You trying to get dope but I just am
I was born with it, did a tour with it
Them overseas girls always give you more digits
I've been blessed, I done went shore to shore with it
Now trying to help a couple kids do more with it
Got some plaques on the wall and I'm still dope
I'm just trying to show the people that there's still hope
You buy a album and we serve up a meal bro
The label's like "That's gonna cost you a mill bro"
So big, God told me to
And momma don't believe in that but I know it's true
We came to spread a little love that's what we gonna do
Finally Famous in the house that's the only crew

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T. Mills]
I bought it, I own it
You borrow, I loan it
I got people rocking clothes with my fucking name on it
She said "Milli do your thing"
So I built a stage on it, now my bed rocking
Rocking like one of my shows
All she wearing is perfume, she love my cologne
And I been waiting on my moment what feel like forever
But the more I think about it shit it's probably better
Cause I keep working, I keep grinding, I keep writing, I keep rhyming
I'mma turn a single stone into a pile of diamonds
I remember when I didn't have the funds to buy shit
Holla if that's something that you can identify with
But now I drop a grip on the jeans
And now I drop your rent on some weed
And now I'm making love on your sheets
I'm in your worst nightmare and in your girlfriend's dreams
Wake up, hello, tell me what you see
I'm a skinny motherfucker like six foot three
I said fuck a weight room, I was selling CD's
Getting more pussy than the whole football team
I was born in Riverside and I'm still that
Yeah I heard your new shit and it's still wack
Every time we get together you gonna feel that
This summer and the next, I'mma kill that, Mills

[Hook: Mike Posner & Niykee Heaton]

[Verse 3: Sammy Adams]
I got them wetter than a Vilbrequin youngest of the champions
Beach house music, cue the dark pads and violins
Clear glass out in Malibu with all my friends
Me, Mike Pos, the Mills, and Niykee for the win
I'm growing up I gotta buzz call it motivation
Blowing up like iPhone push notifications
Priceless if I had it back I wouldn't change a thing
It's far from over so I tell the fat lady sing
And she hitting the notes and I'm starting to feel
Like I can't sit in coach cause I get fucking killed
Oh, I own it, oh oh, I'm on it
Cold like Winterfell I Game of Throne it
Hold it, hold it, did anybody notice
They all in the D now, Beantown we own it
Shouts to the D.O. Beantown we roll it
Yeah me and my Gs and we own it, yeah Sammy

[Hook: Niykee Heaton]

I’m waking up on Sunset Boulevard
Maxing out all my credit cards
Living my own LA story
Living it up ’til the morning

[Verse 1: Sammy Adams]
Sammy
I’m not trying to show you love and affection
I’m trying to live the life a kid always expected
Over on Sunset, finished a couple sessions
One foot in the door, one in the hills, questions
Angels in leather, I ain’t talking ’bout the motor club
But I tend to go hella hard when I go to clubs
Minibar murder, I’m on Denzel’s flight
With a stewardess that wants to f*ck the whole damn night
Who cares what they all say
Try’na find some girls like Hov did with Beyonce
Had you for a week but I heard you say fiance
Na na, none of that girl

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
I fell in love, the streets got a glow
The city of angels is calling me home

And she said, and she said uh

[Hook: Mike Posner]
I’m waking up on Sunset Boulevard
Maxing out all my credit cards
Living my own LA story
Living it up ’til the morning
We’ll be taking shots under the stars
Living off of hotel minibars
Living our own LA story
Living it up, living it up
We living it up

[Verse 2: Sammy Admas]
Everybody’s a model or a wannabe
If you’re that bad it’s in Paris where you ought’a be
She’s an actress, working on the late shift
Only longs for a big break as a waitress
Walk the strip, see the fashion getting wacky now
Out the door, passing out
Hit the floor, Pacquiao
Credit card at the bar never closing out
But the weather’s so nice, nobody slowing down
Well except for the 101
Gotta SUV stuck in traffic with a ton of buds
I can promise you tonight’s gon’ be a ton of fun
Know that c-c-c-c

[Bridge]
‘Cause I fell in love, the streets got a glow
The city of angels is calling me home

[Hook]
And she said, and she said uh

[Verse 3: Mike Posner]
Up at Urth Caffe like Vinny Chase
She got a big booty, itty bitty skinny waist
Henny straight, everyday summer
Never on the sheets like you’re on top of the cover
Every day when I’m away look at the toe so
Look at the cops, don’t even care, you can just blow smoke
I’m Robin Hood on the beat
I get paid in LA and give it back to the D

[Bridge]
I fell in love, the streets got a glow

Living it up, living it up
We living it upI love summertime cause I love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to work I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody

[Verse 1]
I just need a dime and some sunshine
A little magic a cut above the average
Everybody moving I told 'em this will happen
Cut above the records who the hell you think they blastin'
Kiss the hand of the new boss all jazzed up I ain't ever been to Utah
Packed up ready for the journey got my U-Haul
Game's over sunk the 8 followed by the cue ball, cue ball, cue ball

Tapes pop Panama to Cuba
Jack's chasing everything I chew on
Life is just a party and you missing every nuance
Keep your comments cut 'em out the picture with your coupons, coupons
You are everything I'm looking for
Fireworks every time that I'm looking towards
Everything I do I, do I, I promise Ima do it to the best of my ability
I prove it

[Hook]
I love summertime cause I love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to work I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody

We gon' live, live it up, feel like this, feel like love
And we on top so come with us
If you gon' roll then lift your cup
Summertime

[Verse 2]
I just need a pretty girl one time
No commitments down to get it in quick
I'm just tryna drink a few
Soak up all the sunshine
Not a damn thing running through my young mind
Thank God for the new hits
Walking down the beach and hearing my own music
Couldn't feel better
Cutie on my right bad as ever
And my homie told me I could never get her, get her, get her, get her
Yup I can't even explain the feeling doing nothing
But just chilling with your gang
Things up on the road and I seen a board of planes
Can't compare to being with the homies
Some things just never change
It's summer love some numbers gon' exchange
I left a couple hearts bleedin'
It's part of the game
And I know I, know I, gotta lot of work to do
But Ima keep on working for the music

I love summertime cause I love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to work I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm lookin' for somebody

We gon' live, live it up, feel like this, feel like love
And we on top so come with us
If you gon' roll then lift your cup
Summertime, whoa, whoa, whoa
To Summertime, whoa, whoa, whoa

We gon' live, live it up, feel like this, feel like love
And we on top so come with us
If you gon' roll then lift your cup
Summertime, whoa, whoa, whoa
To summertime, whoa, whoa, whoa
To summertime, whoa, whoa, whoa[Verse 1]
In Vegas, yeah I drink Jäger
Throw bangers, get serenaded by ladies basically naked
It's crazy this life I take it
Everybody notice, white girls drink Vodka Sodas
Jack and cokes will get you open, tequila shots are the dopest
And I love it, the way you look so fine when I'm faded on my 10 gin and tonic
But keep on getting persuaded that I wanna crack a Jameson
Invite all your lady friends, tell that bartender serve a mothafuckin' round again

[Hook]

You know this body aroma I'm a stoner
Crumblin' marijuana on your sofa
Watchin the bently [?]

Threw a concert on the highway

Jumpin out, she thinks she’s awesome
Hung over kid from AD
Late to class daily
Runnin from his dorms, jukin people like he’s AP (let’s go)
Got a emo girl who hates to teach
Hates the boys, always cheats
Make up on the eyes, lookin fried like she on the streets
Real pic chick in a sun dress

Body losin contest (let’s go)

Hate me, that’s alright
You ain’t bout the athlete life
Runnin round, you yackin nice
Sophomore, junior, senior
Don’t matter long as the package right

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sammy Adams]
Okay she to they side and plays with guys
Went to Major Lazer
But standing right in the paper
And said fuck it, I’ll just plagiarize
Academic pro, not a pro
That’s probation
But twerk it like a pro
Thanks Diplo, that’s amazing
And the girl is on the soccer team
I can tell her body’s lean
And she like a goalie, takin more shots than a hockey team
First week she was probably clean
Last week she a molly fiend
This week she’s a party queen
It’s so fuckin awesome

[Hook]

Money he got plenty
He ain't playin
They ain't ready
Shits gon get a little heavy, oh
Beatin up the beat
Early up I call it Breaky
And I'm skatin through the generous
Ridin fast like a (bang bang)
365 day cash flow diet
If I ain't doin shows or in the studio I'm dyin'
Buzz that I created make people think I was buyin
I guess these dudes forgot that makin money takes some grindin'
I been doin this for 9 months but I'm sure they know
That I put in more work that you have in like 4, 5 years or so
Can't hear all them haters
Learned a technique couple weeks ago
Middle fingers up bitch
My eyes are closed

Yeah forget
Mr.Stern
Alex (energy)
Oh (Basshead)

Stop time ocho
Taller than you front row
Yellow flag not throw
I'm whack thought so
Hard to take a loss oh
Eyes on picassos
I'm a mile high smokin nuggets in a bronco
Hear me on my junk go all records all gold
Record labels all hoes
Talkin to my mom oh
So rude but in interviews a gentlemen
Can't compare me to somethin in the game that's (oh oh)
Uh like me like me
And these bitches mad I care more about my nikes
Stuck off a plane blowin smokes like lee
And these dudes are blown away goin on beats like these (whoo)
Yeah, I call it hip hop dubstep
This has not been done yet
Shit that get the club wet
Yeah I'm movin out I got a sub let
Mad I gave the game somethin that they haven't fucked with
Yeah and admit it feels awkward
To not say a word but know that everyone's talkin
Every eye is watchin
Studio locked in
Go and get this off me
Baby failin's not an option
Yeah ironic how I walked in
And if it was the 90's
I'd be blastin in your walk-man
Please, hold the comments I get often
You need to take a breather
Maybe you should take a walk man[Hook]
I been working all night, man
What's a young kid got to do to blow up?
This life's becoming something I can't stand
Tell those people "Go Home" I don't want to grow up
I drank too much again last night, damn
Woke up with a hangover, time to roll up
Been workin' so hard can't they understand?
So many kids like me, we just wanna blow up, blow up, blow up
Blow up, blow up, blow up
Yeah, we just wanna blow up

I just wanna prove a teacher wrong
Tell them that my own degree didn't help me write a song
Only payin' attention to the girl with the thong
And the skirt so short, it's like she barely has one on
And uh, sick of hearin' bout my alcohol abuses
And makin' up extravagant excuses, they're useless
So deuces to the classroom, welcome to your dreams
That made you without a major, homie, welcome to the team

[Hook]

Waking up, weights become a trend
I roll over in the morning, random girl up in my bed
And I swear she was a cutie, she was lookin' like a ten
But the proof is in the puddin I was obviously bent
Obviously put it on a rich girl's tab
Just tryin'a make money like a rich girl dad
So deuces to the school life, welcome to the game
That made you without a major, homie, look what I became

[Hook x2]O yeah
I’m brand new like you haven’t unwrapped it
Head over heels got bloggers doin' back flips
Am where I am cause my fans and some practice
I could go for 90, bet the kid is match fit
Girls on my page writing Sammy is a bastard
Thinking that they special, but got treated like the last chick
Knowing that my fan base stretches like elastic
Jaw droppin' beats like it's better than the last shit
But still, I’m in the paint by the basket
This that one take new flow straight classic
Yeah I see the truth shining bright if you look close
Rappers dropping names forgot to add the footnotes
In all honesty, hating's not a part of me
Respect’s in my blood, I don’t need a bibliography
I show love cause that’s what I’ve always dug
If ya ass ain’t got a shovel get the fuck out of the mud
It’s sandbox I’m Smalls first time on the Sandlot
Tryin' to learn the rules maybe get myself a damn shot
Yeah, I’m hittin' veins you could have never drawn
Pumpin' blood no rubber bands around the arm
But looking back when I started as a critics young
To makin' hits with a grin as the crowd applause, pause
I’m digging deeper with my gritty paws
Tryin' to get it poppin' with a presence no Santa Claus
Yeah, and I’m the spitter who defies the laws
Bringing the heat, unexpected like some menopause
Ha, I never thought that one of my songs
Would spread quick on a thousand different iPods
Yeah, I’m human and I got benign flows
Rapping with the competition chillin' up in my jaws
Thinking in my mind how to write my wrongs
Turning all this change into ends that defy laws
Cut it out I wasn’t talking 'bout the beat though
Aimin' to make em get the point like a free throw
Tell my girl to please recline my seat slow
Knowing that I’m colder than the bottom of a ski pole
And if it’s snowing in the city I’m getting blown
With a couple bitches down to ride where he goes
Late night in the jacuzzi with the same hoes
Catchin’ brains puffin on them Monte Christos
Uhhh I’m back on my spittah shit
Back, ba-back, back on my spittah shit
Yeah, you know I'm back on my spittah shit
Back, ba-back, back on my spittah shit[Intro]

Lifestyle switching, the illest up in the business
I’m hoping to make a killing
Get at me, get at me
Going coast to coast
Going coast to coast
We going coast to coast
Coast to coast

[Verse 1]
I’m not being mean, I'm just being me
(?) Sinatra, get on my team
Girls see me say "OMG"
He’s back on flights going overseas
Not rich, but aspire to be
Got a new Bentley and my swagger cheese
Rather be an act with a pound of trees
Never been down and you cannot see
Girl problems, you think you had some
Hit the beats, you won’t have none
Big dream sale, you know platinum
Checks never deposit, just cash ‘em
Summertime, triple eight vodka
Going out with my boys, looking proper
Used to be at the bottom with the other lobsters
Now I’m in the sky like birds and helicopters

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
On flights traveling to play songs
Two things, iPod and my Dre's on
Two things on my mind at the same time
Got to go both coasts on the same song
Gotta kill shit, no limit
I spit my heart out, cause it’s in this
And the bridges, the beginning
Yeah, something like the keys to my ignition
Come fly, yeah get a boarding pass
Too busy all day can’t go to class
Still getting good grades, know I’m gonna pass
Hit the West Coast, I’m leaving last
Domestic, got a press kit
Side life every girl's impressed with
Girls strutting like they won't have sex with me
Yeah right

[Hook] (2x)Sammy Adams
Comin' up, comin' up
Yeah, Boston
Matty Trump
Yeah, uh
Uh, uh, uh

Chorus:
I'm comin up, I'm comin up on it
Running airlines from LA to Boston
Can't stop and I told you I promised
So you ain't gonna hear nobody that's hotter (hotter)
Hear nobody thats hotter, ain't nobody that's hotter
Nobody hotter, ain't nobody thats hotter

What up haters, I'm back so hows my dick taste?
I'm spitting grimy, like mouths without toothpaste
Never thought of mixing blood with my confidence
She was in my city, showing love to me's the consequence
Cause my wills coming, whether or not you're liking it
Felt like the tip of the pen that checks the counterfeits
Like, your girl ain't never heard of me
Sike, cause she'd probably search the world for me
Ha, ha, ha, ha I laugh on tracks
You burst face to go hard cause your ass can't rap
About to take all, see the stripes and the stars on my window
Plane flying on the air pitch dark

[Hook]

I told my parents that I was gonna get some
Hop on stage and get higher than a jet, son
Getting love told me why you never getting none
Born to the game, never pose as a step-son
I'm that new to iTunes, what's next shit
Rewind that track, what time before I exit
Like I could give a fuck, really what y'all think
Destiny is blessing, bartender give me a tall drink
So I could fade out, dreams of being played out
City radio I'm good and look at how I made out
Uh, on the stroll my path's paved, telling me to do it all up
So now I'm off stage, taking shots, I'm just trying get in cage
Coming up bar, see the numbers on the fan page
Can't stop cause they want 'em on the airwaves
Late night in Boston, west coast in the LA

[Hook]

And my sky line's so contagious
Jet fuel on my tongue, ain't hungover cause I'm wasted
Chewing on success, so close I can taste it
Came too far, homie feel like I'mma make it
Yeah, and you know I'm gonna get 'em
Agencies hawking, never can forget 'em
Slowly moving strong in positions that I'm winning
Better let em know
(Sammy Adams yeah tell 'em)

[Hook]Sammy Adams
Lazy boy
Matty Trump

Got a problem too many girls in class (yeah)
Wanna run a show but they just can't wrap (no)
The idea around they head that the kid could rap
Fact, I kill stages all places
Nantucket and ACK city so they could taste it
But I’m real late no way I’ma make it
Back to my classes, the clock impatient (I’m back)
Well, apologize to the teach for me
Cause anything she speaks ain’t doing shit for me (ain’t nothing)
And my bad can't read notes
Still amazing like a chick with a deep throat
Treading water since the very thin ice broke
Now I’m neck deep in contracts
Psycho (yeah) I’m alright though, or I will be
Shake your ass ma, if you feel me

Baby, you been driving me crazy (crazy)
Can you be my lady? (be my lady)
Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy

Grab your girl up out this life
Drink hen and coke with ice
DJ spinning all my shit, Cause Sammy Adams what is what they like
(Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy)

Yeah and I can party with the best of ‘em
At school but still can't touch them son
Ain’t DC, but flyer then rest of them (oh, oh)
You ain’t there I’ma get her num

Walking on, walking on something new
You and the whole damn rap game too (So)
And I know got one life (One life)
Like you girl, please no wife (no wife)
Blow weed in the club, no white (no white)
Wheelin’ females, got no bike

Going twelve rounds, yeah go fight (yeah)
Get blessed by the kid Jesus Christ
And the beat stop, sleep tight

Baby, you been driving me crazy (crazy)
Can you be my lady? (be my lady)

(Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy)

Being a man it only makes you better off
Ain’t a rock band, no my shits never soft
I look at girls and they always wanna talk

Move to this, get drunk to this
You know
Uh, yeah Boston’s boy
We outPoppin pills like I'm sick boy
We're number one don't forget boy
I'm a machine and running the team
From the fuckin bean I just stay coy
Island life the vacation flow
Reppin USA everywhere I go
Got it on my arm so you already know
That I'm comin for your spot I'm bringing JCO
Woop! New Sammy track
Never run away but it's cool fall back
Always been cool so the fame just adds to the fact that we got the whole room so packed
We good we don't need no cause
The team likes being in the city so we don't see no stars
Whattup haters i'm back so how's my dick taste
Still good? K cool get it all back


Harder than ever my balls sharper than cheddar
Smell like tobacco and leather
Thanks Tom nobody's better than that
Spas I don't need medication
You hear it the dedication
Refuse to take a vacation (fallback)
I'm on the cover like bitches that I fuckin got
Enrique doing doubles like I'm a fucking drug I don't crack
I'm a no brainer I'm a fucking entertainer
I'm just bringin the focus like some mad mother fuckers[Verse 1] [Enrique Iglesias]
You know I'm going to get you, yeah
Whatever it takes to, get there
No I won't drop you
Like everybody else does

[Hook]
Forget about your friends, they don't care where we go
If they do, we'll get lost in a crowd of people
I've been looking for you
Forever baby we go
Together baby we go, we go
In this crazy world of choices, I've only got a few
Either you're coming with me or I'm coming with you
Because I finally found, I finally found you
You never have to worry if what I say is true
Girl I've been looking for you
And when I saw you I knew
That I finally found, I finally found you

[Verse 2]
I'm coming I'll get ya, yeah
We have a connection, that's right
Because girl I'm not letting go
I'm gonna make you feel right, oh yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3] [Sammy Adams]
Yeah, so can I get love, too much to ask for
Really so tough
Find yourself moving with the sex of the drums
Got my hands full, grabbing all these girls, girls
Hands up, hands up, dance floor chilling when I hold two cups
Can't stop spilling because I'm drunk as fuck
And my song comes on and the club goes nuts
Every time the side goes, seems to you sleep, best that to you know
Running around, and doing all these shows
Round the whole globe, I come, and you go girl
And you need to think of it
Just wrap for the night, baby live a bit
With a place to hit, and your pants to zip
You can make a scene and party, are you into it

[Hook]Heads Gone Roll Remix
Party Records
Sammy Adams
I'm On

Bees knees
Little homie I'm the item 9
Yea, you get slapped like a bitch if you outta line
Cross joints so that piff leave me in the sky
No shoes, god damn, well I guess its time to fly
And we could go in on fuckin' anything
You and your boy want techno rap or country fuckin' R&B?
Don't compare home boys to me
I'm in another genre, way out the gal-lax-y
Ya'll could never see me, No
Never play my game
Never roll them dice then you gon' never learn a thing
I, I do my thing for the 6-1-7 mang
This the Boston's boy, killin' it is you know ain't nothin change
I'm back on the radio but the don't see my chains
I might have something trendy but I keep it baggy in my jeans
Party records on the scene, bitches scream for 2 hours in a dream
The bass drops crack, eat a pill, and be a fiend
I'm on

(Chorus)
Glitter on the west streets (yea, yea I'm on)
Silver over everything (oh, oh I'm on)
The rivers all wet (yea yea, I'm on)
You're all chrome (I'm on, I'm on)

Glitter on the west streets
Silver over everything
The rivers all wet
You're all chrome

(Verse 2)
Oh, here's the part where I come in
Hit it and make another damn track again
Haters say this is the same ol' me, hi friends
Still mad I'm in the spot with Sam
Got my chance, locked it in
Now girls wanna interlock with him
But I just pass 'em, Utah Jazz em, yep
John Stockton now
Peligrino, bubbly, or vodka, I don't know what I'm gonna get
You choose cause I disagree with the prices in this bitch, yea
White boy who could tie a tie
Got the benefits from the neighborhood to rely
Got a dog at home where your homie lies
I'm the center for the team, don't be surprised
I can't stop trippin over a milli I'm remixing
Place so hot every I get finished
Paper lights
Everybody got the bass and mic up
Blow trees in your face you get stuck
Blow trees in your face you get stuck
Blow trees in your face you get stuck
Cause we on

(Chorus)[Hook]
I hate college but love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to class, I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesnt mean im looking for somebody
Some say they drink blaze up, but hardly
Poppin' PK's, ski a little bit of molly
Am I out my mind most people say probably
But I've been on my grind puffin' nugs of that cali, collie

[Verse 1]
Pack my bag no parents didn't drop me off
I felt lost saw some herbs all wearing Lacoste
Couple dudes in pinnies musta played lacrosse
Grabbed my duffle and I hustled through the dormitory doors
Of course my homie lived on the same floor
Soon to blow trees and down to pound Coors
Down to pound whores, out of time though
Flow the better up to the whole town oooh
I hate college but love getting laid
Socialite swagger at night when the sun fades
Check my sun shades talking about upgrades
I can't see the haters no more I feel great
My eyes 20/20 so sunny when skies gray
I'm loved by the honies what more can I say
I'm just getting paid working like a slave
Between school athletics and music its all day
So invite your friends to come play
Gave you the invite if you miss it don't complain
If you lucky get a kiss but miss no that's lame
Wanna get it in with wizzy, I'm your man
Sweating bullets no fan can contain
Short to pull it, but quick to amaze
I'm looking forward to tours in these planes
Seeing the cork popping from bottles of champagne
Dear lord taking your name in vain
All these sins in college that I made
Well well my game's off the chain
I last a couple hours tomorrow go insane

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep cause my god damn teach keeps assigning essays
Due at the end of each week
But little do they know I got a show by the beach
Watching girls flash Wizzy way more than their teeth
They mad I'd rather learn flows than their lesson plans
But sit me down asking do you get the message Sam?
This is your life and you're in school to get right
Nah, music is my sun and you blocking my light
And if I don't blow get high and ignite
My life full of lines so my money gets nice
Well money's not happiness, you'll only get greedier
But shit it'd make life a whole lot easier
And my field gets a whole lot cheesier
Dominos bread but still getting meatier
But schools good for one thing I must add
And that's having a plethora of my vocab
Whole bags of verbs that I must grab
And throw down like a rich girls bar tab

[Hook][Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found meeeeee
I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without meeeee
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Hook: Taylor Swift]
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
Double platinum wherever she go
Shout to French Torino
Met her out Met her out in Vegas
I'm not in no casino
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate
Just yet
Slow down I know that you're thinking you and me
Just met
But girl I got the remedy
Most important the chemistry
Good girl gone bad
Too much for a Kennedy
So, some say some say they sold their souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live the life of gold with the perfect chick
Cause that one moment so breathless and you're hoping
That you'll feel the same way same way
Sparks glowing off that cute face and that sharp smile
Oh man
I haven't crushed this hard in quite awhile
Oh dang
And I could care less that you famous
We gon' make the perfect couple
Cause my first name Big
Last name Trouble

[Hook]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

When your sadest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble![Verse 1: Taylor Swift]

And I'm ok baby, I'm just fine
And I must step back, and close my eyes
I can't see the ground cause I'm so high
I'm so I'm so I'm so high

[Verse 1]
That's just the way it goes
Rock bottom watching my inspiration fold
Thrown in the game, no warm-up but I ain't cold
Transition from ice cold to luke warm
Wanna feel my story homie come and put my shoes on
Yeah, Cause since the beginning people be hatin'
When I see 'em I'm just grinnin'
(What up hatas)
Grew up in the city blowin' Ls while we winnin'
You know I'm going just had as hard in the ninth inning
As the first thanks Boston for Raisin' me
Thoughts clear with a splash of complacency
Sammy Adams the prey of the agencies
Unless it's Ari Gold
Homie get the fuck away from me
Waitin' on the game so patiently
Living life styles that you would think were make believe
Never stole a swag, bit a line, none of this
I only did me thinking how I could become the shit

[Hook]
And I'm ok baby, I'm just fine
And I must step back, and close my eyes
I can't see the ground cause I'm so high
I'm so I'm so I'm so high

[Verse 2]
So high, dodging jets straight, straight yay flow (zoom)
No pipe dreams, getting pesos
But I'd rather get love, get besos
Tracks on repeat, girls asking who makes those
Give a damn if your boys don't like me
I'm on track now like Nike, almighty
If you get money just tend to it politely
If you got bars, beating me is unlikely
Always had a chance
You never had a glance
I'm the cool kid in the meetings
When others would piss they pants
Head up in the clouds, sophisticated stance
While my body's in the office, supplyin' their demands
And every hour in the booth that I'm getting paid for
Wonder why it's dark outside, and where today go
Cuz' it's easy to get your name known
When everything you're recording is straight fuego

[Hook]
And I'm ok baby, I'm just fine
And I must step back, and close my eyes
I can't see the ground cause I'm so high
I'm so I'm so I'm so High[Verse 1]
My best friends call me Wiz, my cougars call me kid
And even though these haters talking, I ain't hearing shit
The girls call me all the time, women call me fine
And my birthday fell in August, so my auntie call me lion
Maejor call me young, pops call me son
Music is my line, so the best is yet to come
Benny call me Sammy, LA call me Grammys
Mikey call me Wizzy F, and Boston call me family
Critics call me inspiration, my lawyer call me patient
Agent call me superstar, accountant call me cakin'
And Nicky call me tio, cousins call me Leo
Always entertaining every single person we know

[Hook] (x2)
Cause I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was


[Verse 2]
Sis said I was one of the greatest, we ain't even make it
H call me animal and fans call me famous
My liver call me faded, and foes call me the fakest
And I don't ever answer cause I'm out here getting it
Team call me boss, when we out on the road
You've got to live and experience everything you know
Youth call me leader, overachiever
All day dreamer, please stay, I need you
Ex call me liar, best friends call me fire
Can't help but I don't mind, I'm next in line
Al call me Bubba, my mother call me stubborn
Keith call me butter, and girls call me lover

[Hook] (x2)[Intro: Curren$y (Sammy Adams)]
Yeah (Adams)
(Yeah) Fly Jets Over Boston
Yeah oh
We not playing with 'em

[Verse 1: Sammy Adams]
White picket fence not me I'm on the top floor
Roof top city spot looking over all yours (I see ya)
Chillin' with a crush I don't really have time for
I'm the 3 white keys in C, you're a minor
Knew my shit bang when my music hit the highways
Found out that hard work pays off like Fridays
And, plenty of people do this our age
But don't seem to be blowin' like Penelope and Johnny's
Sorry, sound so big headed
I'm just flowin' no clue where this clouds headed (no way, no clue)
Never been addicted to the fame, no star fetish
You worried 'bout yours, but we count all of this, uh

[Hook: Curren$y]
All we gon' do is spit that reals
So if you fake then don't come round here
Oh you thought that this was your year?
There's the door get the fuck outta here
I'm not playin, I'm just sayin
I'm not playin, I'm just sayin
I'm not playin, I'm just sayin
I'm not playin

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Uh, and when it all come down to it
The homie Spitta do his thing you gotta give it to him
Refer in 3rd person tell myself about my music
You got them screen door lyrics, we can see through 'em
You and your team don't get it how you say you doin'
You just tryna keep the crowd moving lying to 'em
Disrespecting the game and gettin' paid for it
Lost sight of what you first got in the game for
I seen it all from my stadium seat chair
Number 1 rolled OG brand new
Old sneaks man what you mean?
It's like club life shoppin' in a time machine
Kinda light headed in my heavy Chevy
Talkin' to my light skinned red bone on my blackberry
Headed wherever I haven't been already
Fuck all else jets over every

[Hook: Curren$y]
All we gon' do is spit that reals
So if you fake then don't come round here
Oh you thought that this was your year?
Here's the door get the fuck outta here
I'm not playin, I'm just sayin
I'm not playin, I'm just sayin
I'm not playin, I'm just sayin (straight up)
Word to Sam, fool
Roll me another one[Verse 1]
I'm a Ace on the river, not playing cards
Alcohol and reefer that's my air
None flyer, fans the messiah
Got your hands up now I say jump higher
Boston's boy, awesome noise
Wanna battle it'll cost ya boy, accost ya boy
Fuck singing and promo, got my mojo back
Vision back like [?]
Fucked up, trying find the exit
Said she loved pearls, I gave her a pearl necklace
Not the jewelry, stop the tomfoolery
Tom Ford cologne that I spend on when she do to me
I'm sure you're one of those guys that's really nice
And we fuck and you vanish at night it's not right
Well, in and out girl I got my own agenda
I'll go animal style, I bartend my own menu

[Hook]
I came to get fucked up
Came to jump, well it's just your luck
I know, I know how to make ya'll jump
I know, I know just what ya'll want
Put your hands up, now I say jump higher
, j-j-jump higher
, jump higher
Got your hands up, now I say jump higher
, jump higher
[Verse 2]
Prost chickes don't love me anymore
After my pants sag down  to the floor
Pants back up til my waist belt secure
The walk back was out the motherfucking door
Damn, he's back at it, Sammy's back at it
Rewind the song, like Nas I'm still mad at
Mr Pragmatic, Nas I'm illmatic
Rewind the song cuz Sammy's back at it
Poker
Face, three eighths, but don't gamble
Almost passed out from killing the whole handle
More pain, Rambo, we're both commando
Knowing that she on it but she know she does it rando
Girl wanna mack and if you don't see
I'm just tryna get some jobs
Like my name is Steve
Ay say DJ in wholesale or hotel
Even if you don't let me hit, disappointed we don't tell

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Damn kid, that's so devilish
Kill my vibe, almost as hard as Kendrick did
I'm a sinner, I'm a born-bred winner
I probably do you again right after we finish dinner
Ho, who are you to judge?  You don't know the kid
Always at my front door, some Jehovah shit
Witness, my dick is, your fitness
Can't fit this, ridiculous, delicious
Yeah that's the fucking business
You're 19 acting like you on some older shit
Always at the same clubs with promoter kids
Only place I go to is the studio or homie's crib
And I be out in NYC  to LA and you know this shit
Sending girl emojis, while she giving me blowies
She went 24, she the east coast Kobe
Just the tip, playing just the tip isn't playing hard to get
We both know I'm gon' hit it

[Hook][Intro: Sam Adams]
I, I got so much to say
Don’t even know how to say it
All this hype, all this noise
I’m ready

[Verse 1: Sam Adams]
First stop high school rookie
Not a single fan writing rhymes playing hookie
Back around the time Fred Durst got nookie
Couple years before my ass had ever seen pussy
Yeah, young Sammy with a fantasy
Found my mind first time I blew a gram of tree
Used to hate on my brotha cause I didn’t see
That good weed made a shackled man feel free
But they could never see that, nope
And my music seemed weak
Embarrassed to play me tracks embarrassed to be me
Yeah, stepped up with my levels on the beats
Made a damn anthem for my high school team
But no features, packed bleachers, hearing myself blast out of car speakers
And that’s when I started to believe and finally realized I should let myself succeed
I should let myself succeed

(Hook)
And when I leave stage
And the limelight
And the groupie girls
When the times right
And I fly home back to my life
With my fam around me yeah it sounds right
When I leave LA with my mind right
On a couch at home for the whole night
No drugs here, just love here
Just love here

[Verse 2: Sam Adams]
Next stop tears in my eyes
Remembering the person I was so set to disguise
Packing up for college no parents at the time
Starting a new chapter of Sammy Adams life
Write, and my got better
Spittin everyday new vocabs clever
I Hate College allowed me to enter
The realm of popularity I thought I’d reach never
Ever, and loves an endeavor
I want my girl to love me but my music won't let her
Chasing all my dreams while I float like a feather
Yeah, and my grades going south
But as an intellectual I needed to get out so
I visited to see what it was bout
And being close to Boston it made a better route
These fake ass promoters stay running their mouth
Reacting to what they say with a handful of doubt, ouch

(Hook)
And when I leave stage
And the limelight
And the groupie girls
When the times right
And I fly home back to my life
With my fam around me yeah it sounds right
When I leave LA with my mind right
On a couch at home for the whole night
No drugs here, just love here
Just love here

[Verse 3: Sam Adams]
Third stop, waiting at my gate
This home sick feeling is something I can't shake
But make no mistake I was born to do this
Born to make music, boy I’m gon’ prove it
I can’t sleep on the flight
Which isn’t helping out cause I can’t sleep at night
And even with some Ambien a half of bar bites(?)
Consumes my damn stomach which continues to be tight
Yeah, and my dreams will ignite
On hooks while we fight
Fan base broad, real click slight
Focused on point I’m tryin to live right
Right and I’m about to graduate
And all these agencies know how to aggravate
I wish they would just leave me alone
I just wanna go home
I just wanna go home
(but I also want the throne)

(Hook)
And when I leave stage
And the limelight
And the groupie girls
When the times right
And I fly home back to my life
With my fam around me yeah it sounds right
When I leave LA with my mind right
On a couch at home for the whole night
No drugs here, just love here
Just love here
