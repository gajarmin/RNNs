[Verse 1]
I used to cop a lot
But never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails, tight, and bob a lot
Stop and stick around
Come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown six-o sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press - let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take "Means to the End" for two milli'
"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back
Came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone - turn H2O to Cognac
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
Doomsday
Every since the womb ‘til I'm back to the essence
Read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say"
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames of nimble and tip of nipple metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutangs
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can
Me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF - the super-villain![Verse 1]
Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped
Or even a wreath for ma dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be talking that baloney in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen the justice
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries some Brillo and some foil, he'a boil it
He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed
(Food, we need food!)

[Verse 2]
He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
Her bra smell, his card say: aw hell
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares
The odd pair swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years
I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares?
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he about to eat
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable, or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old Negro spiritual
For a mil' do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell 'em devil's hell no, sell y'all own Jello
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar three dollar bills
And squeal for halal veal, 80-dollar pill
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal (FOOD!)

[Verse 3]
What up?
To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
And keep your shirt on, at least a button-up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Out of work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM, tippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail, and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'till it glow like a ruby
After which they couldn't find the Villain like Scooby
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
Overproof drunk shit, and who would'a thunk it?
Punk, try and ask why ours be better
Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater
Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude (We need food!)[Verse]
So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
Daily told the people "You can call me Your Majesty!"
Keep your battery charged
You know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter
Peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (Your mother)
Don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try
Villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you
It's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

[Outro]
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop!* like snot bubbles[Produced by MF Doom]

[Intro: Sample]
Say Brain, what do you wanna do tonight?
The same thing we do every night Pinky
Try to take over the world

(Joey) Who the fuck is this Joey Bada$$ nigga son?

[Hook]
Aye yo who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow?
Point 'em out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic?

Check!

[Verse 1]
Puffin' on stramonium
Underground like potholes but going fossil
These bars like art in the Smithsonian
These flows is for custodians, homeless men, horny OBGYN dudes
Browsing my laptop lookin' at red fallopian tube
They like "Yo Joey you rude"
I'm like "If only you knew I'm only in school for cosmology
That's why I act as lonely as you"
You see I'm wise behind my years and my peers
So my voice over the snares is the only way they hear
What I got behind my membrane, but I've been smoking chem strains
So lately I've been having hard times with remembering
But be patient, my studies prove Egyptians ancient
Cause I believe that we could be like Neo in the Matrix
But fuck it, I'm erratic, momma lock me in the attic please
Til I draw enough static in my somatic anatomy
And come out imputed with fusions of Blueprints and Illmatics
I’ve been going raw, this just how I feel rappin'
We gave y'all sur' tactics, so y'all can’t even gas us
We taught you how to be prepared but still attacking the masses
Y'all better get y'all caskets cause we ‘bout to annihilate
(The New Babylon Era) My empire gate’s in the Empire State
I’m on the higer platform, look at the way they clap for ‘em
Never fuck with phony men cause I don’t like my back torn
Nigga ask kwon - this that top ramen' you ain’t used to
Keep it neutral to scruple and tell ‘em no beef like noodles!!

Keep it neutral, just so you can scruple

[Bridge]
I tell ‘em no beef like noodles
It’s world domination, (nation) you’re tuned into my station
Always got a doobie and a motherfucking eighth lit
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain’t about to rise to the top with my fucking team

[Hook 2x]Keep your hoes in check...

(...Super!)
I got this girl and she wants me to duke her
I told her I'd come scoop her around 8, she said "Super!"
That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper
No matter what I need her to do, she be like "Super!"
Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
On the microphone he flossed the ring "Super!"
Average emcees is like a TV blooper
MF DOOM, he's like D.B. Cooper
Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit
Just to cool her off she said niggas ain't about shit
I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it
The way it be in her mouth she can't live without it
And can't live with this, handle your business
Villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list
One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper
It's fun smacking rookies, he is the "Super!"
Look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow
Weirdo, brown skin'ded always kept his hair low
Rumor has it it's a S-Curl accident
DOOM was always known to keep the best girls' backs bent
Some say it's the eyes, some say the accent
A lot of guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla
Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her
No matter the city she with me to do the thang-thang
Work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang
Same name on the titty as on the name ring
Pretty like Baby D off "All in the Same Gang"
Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her
But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the "Super!"
See most cats treat her like Foofur
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the "Super!"
You need to make her feel cuter
And lay down the G like Luther, everything'll be "Super!"
Do for her, keep her in a new fur
So she look sweet when she go to meet the "Super!"
Got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it
Put it in the air, come here, kiss it
Listen here scooter, let her try to bag you
When she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu
Which'll have you under some type of spell crying "dag boo"
Her name on your back in a tattoo
Whether a bourgie broad, nerd ho, street chick
Don't call her Wifey if you met her at the Freaknik
You don't want her don't waste her time, I'll dupe her
And be a father to your child like the "Super!"
He keep his hoes in check
Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
Tell 'em take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real
Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal
Find out where he keep the Tec and the blue steel
Make sure for extra wreck let him know how you feel
And while he's running down to all star weekend to ball
I'm coming with the U-Haul[Produced by Madlib]

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they MC's and drink 'em under the table like
"It's on me, Put it on my tab kid."
However you get there
Foot it, Cab it, Iron horse it
You're leaving on your face, forfeit
I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told him tell they stole it
He told her he lost it
She told him "Get off it," and a bunch other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he's drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and their trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him to autograph her derriere
It read

“To Wide Load
This yard bird taste like fried toad Turd
Love
Villain”

Take pride in code words
Crooked eye mold nerd geek, with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die, by the pizza guy
No he's not too fly to skeet in a skezzers eye
And squeeze her thigh
Maybe give her curves a feel
And the same way she feel it when she flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back... uhh... plumbing fixed
"How theres only one left? the pack comes in six
Whatever happened to two and three?"
A herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught
Like, "What you doing G?
Don't make me have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact not for nothing right now you and me!"

Looser than a pair of Adidas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MC's sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came do his thing again no matter who be blinging
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is, like it's time for Tellie Tubbies
Few can do it even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wears mask, like a -tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies
In and out
One, two, three, no bodies please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shottie
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat, like ya boy done gone to war
He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!"
A whole string of jobs, like we on tour
Every night on the score, coming to your corner store[Intro]
Before we go any further
Friends

[MF DOOM]
As you call 'em, they call you when they need something
Trees for the blunt, the g's for the front
I found a way to get peace of mind for years
And left the hell alone: Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
Send me a letter, or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of they eyes
Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies
Asssociates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies
Close, but really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice, or take it from me
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
So nowadays he ain't so friendly
Actually he woulda even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs: "No feeding the baboon"
Seein' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
Y'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance
Try to put 'em on, they blow the chance
Never let your so-called mans know your plans
(How many of us have them?) A show of hands
(Friends) is a term some people use loosely
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see
You telling me; I try to act broke
Jealousy the number one killer among black folk
Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
Ghetto Cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack, loc
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
I check the dictionary for the meaning of friend
It said: (Friend): Person, one who likes to socialize with
Sympathiser, helper... and that's about the size of it
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
To bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid
And they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch
Sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch
(Click!) and when things get quiet
Catch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot
I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal
Don't let it get drastic, think of how yer moms'll feel
When it get for real, steel get to sparkin'
Everything darken, and ain't no talkin'
For somethin so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble
Ya better off focusing than tryin to plot to bubble
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is
(One's we can depend on...Friends)
Some come in the form of codependence
A lot of times only end up being codefendants
Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
And leave you up under the jail, begging for a penance
It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty
I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory
(How many of us have--) a similar story
(Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing
Just so when I let her get the man thing, she know its no strings
We could do the damn thing, but ho its no rings
Just how the tramp swings, will she see 'em again?
That depends on how good was the skins
And could she memorize the lessons
It ain't no need to pretend
Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they're just friends

[Outro]
(Friends
How many of us have them?
Friends
Ones we can depend on?
Friends
How many of us have them?
Friends
Before we go any further)

Fellas! Don't be silly! I know who my friends are!
And the next nice neighborhood I move into, you guys'll get crackin'
(Negro humor always escaped me.)[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Intro: Dr. Doom]
My servants began to forge what was to become
The most dreaded costume on the face of the earth
The last thing to fit was the mask
Will it conform to my twisted features in comfort

[Verse 1: MF Doom]
He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery that Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
I suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

[Verse 2: Kurious]
Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44
Contemplate, meditate, dictate
I direct my direct fate, coming of late
Kurious, can I say shit
Do it for CottleRock, do it for K.Nit
(RIP)
K-N-I-T, Sub R-O-C
(Eternally for M-I-C)
Only we save we

[Verse 3: MF Doom]
By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame but still bagging 'em too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan manM.F.! M.F! (x7)
MF Grimm is hard as hell
Murder anybody, I don't care who you tell
I bust shells, they all fell
World domination started, sitting in my cell
Potential, kinetic, only time tell
Pressing up units, for more to make 'em sell
Messing up universe, fractal cause chaos
Communicate with the dead, Grimm is in a seance
Don't take it personal, this is strictly business, kid
Nosy niggas wanna hang around, we killing witnesses
We're into torture, have you tied up, hollerin'
Bleed, let you die slow, in heaven, hoverin'

Face my adversaries, every confrontation conquered and
Faces of my adversaries, mutilation, severed and
Traces of my adversaries exist, just like they never did
Other cases involving Percy Carey, yes, I did a bid
? what the Feds feel, war, pistol-whipping pigs
Old toupee type, Grimm is probably twisting wigs
Not a stranger to getting hands dirty, clothes bloody
Either my enemy or a close buddy
We come to terms, it's the life we lead
Some burn from it, Lucifer indeed
They can't separate, their wants from needs
Some learn from it, and try to teach the seeds
A new breed, coach, sees the ? power
Others throw salt in the game, let em ? like they're sunflowers
Hail, gun power, sparks - I sneeze
Your style stinks and I'm Febreze
I'm ever flowing so I rhyme for breeze
Then, willing, I rhyme for cheese
Manhattan, murdering, lay you down with ease
Manhattan, clam chowder, a thousand degrees

Niggas nowadays, take your eye off, you're a goner
If I think you a snitch, then I throw a cup of water on you
Hit team, fly through, kill you on your own corners
Second team, flight crew, mow 'em down, that's how it scatters
Some have kids, but when it's on, it doesn't matter
Defeat that, they'll hunt you later, the ones now that pitter patter
Hit baby formula, Similac, crack splatter
Fox Five, hovering, kill reported, take camera
Gun fire, ducking it, hunted like Al'Qaeda
Strictly with my mind, choking niggas like I'm Darth Vader
Stick me on a crucifix, reappearing days later
Fuck Jacob's Ladder, times change, use the elevator
Life is a struggle, so day by day's the entertainment
Day by day we make our moves so competition hit the pavement
Ghetto politicians, recognition, move the crowd, I'm waving
Shaking hands and kissing babies, maybe they'll assassinate me
Fully automatic, rapid fire bullets fill me
Six million dollar man, stronger they rebuild me
A hybrid: Michael Corleone, with the perspective of Michael Concepcion
So if you fuck with me, then nigga, it's on
With the clock, moving palms with Viktor Vaughn
I make it rain blood with Megalon
Brothas in the street know that Grimm's a Don
Yes, a made man, trapped in the wasteland
They know my mind's a refinery, so they keep an eye on me
Change life for comrades, before they all die on me
I sacrifice mine, before they all die on me
Double oh seven, tuxedo niggas spy on me
Unavoidable, death will occur
Niggas, left shaken, not stirred
On video surveillance, Grimm is blurred
Put me under the jail, that's what they'd prefer

I don't give a fuck, tuck my gun in my waist
Tie my belt tight, so it stays in place
Get out my chair, crawl up the steps
No elevator, so they don't feel I'm a threat
Believe me, I'ma get 'em, and that you can bet
Think it's a prank, nothing to see but a knock
As he opens the door, I'm on the floor with a Glock
Homemade suppressor, so the noise won't start
Most in his face, a few in his heart
Without a trace, I slithered down the stairs
Upper body strength, I'm back in my chair
Cause when I'm mad, nigga, I don't care
Talk shit from far, I'mma leave you there
Reach for your gun, it's done in vain
Grimm ain't the one, you'll be left in pain
Bullets pollute blood, infect the brain
I move fast, I'm curious with shifting lanes
Many get jealous cause money be stacked
Every time they try to kill me, I come right back!

[ -Doc, Doc! Here he comes again, whadda we do?! ]
[ -Surrender! ][Kong]
Kongcrete, the most hideous
Check it, check it, check it
Smoking hash, leave an open ash, broken stash, floating fast, lifted
Kong with the broken glass slur board, nasty nigga fucked Bertha
Insert her further than murder, pulled out then squirt her
Out for murder, out for murder, murder
Out for murder, pull a squeezed then hurt her
Out for Cheddar piece of cheese when in doubt love
Took Alicia Keys in and out love eight nine
Hate all hate all fakes you call cross fate
Find your body at your girls weight walking
Create comment when I start to spit
Y'all niggas spit conformant, conformant

[Megalon]
Study every religion there is rhythm for kids
Deadly as venom as this him or his friends of his
I'm like a guinea pig with a skinny snitch hear me big
Like a penny-rich, hear me bitch, ready to let you see me spit
Here he is, is he really sick or is he really picked
To see the vic or is he really dead for what he did
Let the machete riffs spaghetti drip ready, get set, ready go
Ready to rock with steady flow to let you know we ready to go
Is he heavy? Is he petty? I was hungry so they fed me yo, for heavy dough
I need some heavy dro, Megalon in your stereo
Ready to shoot the heady yo
Yo!

[Rodan]
Lyrics with def rap this side of a letter bomb, yo Megalon
Pass that Megatron, guys on a hunt like a Predacon
Smoking cedar wood trees from Lebanon
Fascist sprites just on MTV terrorist threats looped on a MPC
Travel at a hundred eighty-six thousand kilobytes per second, downloaded on the MP3
1995 Long Island high-styled in the MPB
Monsta Island escaped from MCC

[Kong]
By any means, many fiends his team to toast teens
Toast the scenes for the hoes to scream mostly seen
Bruvee avoided get at me Veluciani 'hind me
Bahama taki busting shots with Giuliani bust back
I squeeze rapping niggas. Y'all been acting like it can happen
My Mack 10 make big niggas' backspin what happened?

[Megalon]
Is that so? Tommy Brasco stacked overnight flow my abstract flow for cash flow
Turned cocaine to crack and turned crack to blow now how the fuck that go?
I'm gonna fuck that ho, the white ho and the black ho
Lay on your back ho, they made the track slow so I could rap slow Tommy mack hoes
Yo, yo, my gun is like my girl cuz I don't wanna let my GAT go
I sold crack fast now I sell crack slow
In the back on the low, if you ain't got no dough
Come to the back door, I'll give you a full pack at four
Rock rap shows, LB on the map when I blow
R&B rap takes it in the ass-crack slow
At my last show I snatched gold
Black Jesus, its a black Christmas now picture black snow

[Rodan]
Hey yo we calculate the sands of time in slo-mo
Manipulating every moment through space
Metabolize the seeds of wealth and let the dough flow
Committing the acts of violence and hate crimes against the po-po
Double barreled hand-held bazooka for sergeant shipbays
If you want to start frying like E-Robo
Blaze that bush whether your maryjane is def or even if it's so-so
Teasing bitches with ice cubes on their nipple, keep them playing with their yo-yo
Athletic pussy like Lisa Leslie and Rebecca Lobo
Rock the show from uptown, downtown to Tribeca, Soho
Most of these rappers are R&B singers like K.C. and Jo-Jo
Better off harmonizing with Taj, Leigh Leigh and Coco
Thesbian thugs, niggas is all mouth like the Rolling Stones logo
Bianca Jagger, free jacker, jacking me off in a go-go
Stuffed down their throats spitting completely bobo
Keeping it groovy without the synthetic fucking mojo
Got the spot kicking like a donkey locked up inside a dojo
Smacked Ralph Lauren, got Tommy Hilfiger picking cotton and rocking Polo

[Megalon]
Is that so?

[Kong]
Niggas straight lifted
Bring the bisket, bring the bitches, bring their motherfucking statistics
Bring their death certificates
Um don't forget the four blocks, peace to Fort Knox where the four stops[Clive Burrows]
Clive Burrows say your last words
"if theres a god then i'll tell him let my ass burn"
On the 21st for last verse words turned verbs worse, explicit
Refer to previous, just in case you missed it
So try'in listen
Look ive always been I misfit, with a sick fit
Big lipped, triple six, spitting from the motherfucking crypt
Im a dick, slick, with the diss in the writ
Im a trip, think its funny isnt it?
Just watch, fore your snowbunny trip and hop
On a nigga cb's carrot, for some lunch money
Sick as fuck, yeah thats why the nose runnied up, flu
Blue jewels, neck frooze
Rude dude, get a clue
Heres some food for thought for all of you
In the end when its through, who the fuck are you?

[Spectre]
2010 was the year that I started rapping dope
Now you better carry a .9, because I'm snapping hope
I ate the track, before I came back for a second helping
Seven days in a week, I murder beats, so heaven help him
When I was six I would've never dreamed of this flow
Maybe five minutes of fame would've been my wish yo
But then I wrote bars like you've never before witnessed
The rap equivalent of shooting threes, and you sure missed it
In order to score maybe you have to drive it in
But I'll always be the one, that nobody was brighter than[Intro: Dolemite]
Watch out- How much you pay to come in here? Three Dollars?

[Verse 1: DOOM]
Front row of the cat fight
The cash tight, write it up flash light, last night
Was a ball, lost a eye off the fly y'all
Bloody tab, he fell head first off the dry wall
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
It's like the quickening, quit your sickening bickering
Things kickin' in, the wick is flickerin'
It's super mother frickin' villain, witchin' through thick and thin
Oh no, the beat is like go go in buffet
Except there ain't no pork and the beans up in the buffet
He ain't lyin', wreck confessions as a rag bite
Sent it as a beamed text message off the satellite
Reflect it like SolarBright
When he hold the mic, he run the mic like Dolemite
It don't match what the decor
But duty stay in drawers, give a round of applause for Rudy Ray Moore

[Verse 2: Oh No]
Smell the piss on the restroom floor
No doors, whores testing the course
Need more three dollars on the tab with the cash
Easy stash, show off the ass get past faster than the avalanche
Hoes know this is quotable
Club thugs filling up the show trying to overdose
And the bouncers are haters
They act tight, and these drunk ass niggas always trying to fist fight
Ain't no wrong, tell 'em (that's right)
Blow more smoke than a motorbike's tailpipe
Seen the villain chillin', had to pay a visit
Super human shit, raise the ceilin' while I raise a million
While I'm in the buildin' bitches sittin' catching mixin' feelings
Like a bad case of intervention, straight ventin'
Cat fight still appealin' to my innervision
Trying to mack in the back during that intermission(Verse 1)

Oh you really wanna be that nigga, fuck a bitch
Oh you really wanna be that nigga, face a zip
Oh you really wanna be that nigga, sell your soul
Illuminati got a nigga rocking hella gold
Been in the game so long trying to make a name
It's only slavery if you're in it for the whips and chains
I been cold but you niggas sleep
Waking up all of the haters when they see me on the tv
With a bitch who's complexion is the chocolatest
I'm on a roll and ain't nobody gon be stopping this
I'm in this bitch, throwing L's to the blue sky
The winning circle you niggas didn't even qualify
Got all of your bitches you niggas couldn't even satisfy
Feet kicked up, just watching my dollars multiply
Sneak dissers and haters I'm coming straight for the cranium
Came into my own and ain't nobody gon be taming him
I'm from the city where niggas kill over Jordan sneaks
And paper, paper, dollar bill is what a nigga speak
Pelle Pelle, Vasques in the summer time
True Religion is what's worn around the waistline
Chi town Illin', Blue Line chillin'
I'm a murderer, that Englewood killin'
I'm so westside, but I'm wild hunnid
They ask me where I'm from Chi City over nothing
Its young Kel rich daily like the mayor
Playerlistic approaches to bitches wanting my paper
Super duper laced in latest sneaker drop
Fuck a cop, fuck a opp, dump on any nigga spot
Green superhero bout my coin like Luigi
Pop up on ya lady and the top i how she greet me
Ion even need to crack I got her wrapped around my index
I'm harder than you thought feel it all in your appendix
The realest nigga on the west of the wind
Don't approach me if it ain't about some bread or some skins
No porky rinds but a nigga rhyme like a loonie
Goonie hitting licks serving out a Suzuki
Foreign broads from Japan kicking shit like Kabuki
She a groupie she a hoochie
Stain then kick her out the hooptie
Hit me up the next day im act like she never knew me
I'm a dog you a bitch looking for you like you Scooby
Laying hands like I'm Knuckles, come and get it come and tussle
I'm just young and getting paid flapping gums and flexing muscle
Shout my niggas from  the 'L' shout my niggas from the 'K'
Shout my niggas hitting Chase cracking cards like a case
Gotta get it anyway, gotta get it everyday
For the love of that cheese making faces Stevie J
I start my day with a J' then I find a beat to slay
Rich daily on the rise but this ain't no easy bake nigga

I'm so 1994 like I'm missing 23
Even in my worst season ain't nobody stopping me niggaI'm a problematic adolescent, smart but I never listen
Not going to fall like physics, cause my mouth spits mystic
Working at this since 3rd grade, to pay off stuff with wordplay
But hey, I did better in the past life, people thought I was the reincarnation of Christ
They wore my country's color which was nice, and all had to bring was water no glass no ice
But now I'm living in times where people rather commit crimes, and do some time, than be employed which means their in the back of the line
Some people spend their life rapping and get mad, cause their broke now and use rapping as a party gag
But that's what you get for thinking without a plan b, you think I'm a hypocrite but I have plans from a to AZ
I rather call my dreams faith, and faith call belief, but if belief is a dream then what is this circle that we don't need

[Hook]
Life lessons learned over here in 48th street, philosophy and showing niggas not to gank me (x2)

[Verse 2]
Praise the shaman on your block, he probably looks like the one whose smoking some rock
But you must of forgot, philosophers don't get the check
So don't disrespect his set of guilded wood on his neck
And give a shout out or two to the og's intelligence, giving exact way to get dead presidents
Without selling crack, dope, cocaine, by getting a good job that doesn't require pain
You can settle down now with your baby mama, with no drama, and knowing you coming home with commas
Homies way trying to get famous isn't going his way, his mom said just pray and say gods great
But there's an eviction notice cause the rent was late, now homie is thinking that gods passing faith
If you want to think differently than look this way, I don't believe this but it was made
Science say we came from outer space across so far, so thinking about it we were all born stars
Truth is we're tested in the struggle, to see whose coming up and whose stuck in the rubble
I'm focused to my future reality like Hubble, trying my best to stay out of trouble
Because once I'm in I'm going off like a shuttle, meaning I'm not coming back just to be subtle
And also Kaleb I.A. has been dope since the cretaceous, proving to kings, Pharaohs, and emperors that they ain't shit
Neither am I but I'm trying to, right now I'm that gastric acid after you eat food
Might come back from where I began, but to free has been the plan
Taking out rap zombies since 04 man[Verse 1: The Real Ice Cream Man]
49 doesn't have the time for lame rhymes
Wait in line for the internal rhymes inspired organized crime big as optimus prime
49 the paradigm of sublime rhymes
Climb the game part-time no chime like a mime could you spare a dime

[Verse 2: Ryan Flip-Flop]
Ryan Flip-Flop is back with 49
The Real Ice Cream Man i will give you a dime
We destroy at the game of pool
You think you're cool, you're a fool
We are the shining jewel
And trust you are nothing but dust

[Verse 3: The Real Ice Cream Man]
Cause we kick you up don't give a fuck
Better duck when i chuck amuck bad luck so you get stuck
Get struck with a garbage truck you schmuck and beat up with some golfing clubs you scrub
Wake up in a shrub next to a full tiger cub with a stub

[Verse 4: Ryan Flip-Flop]
49 we are the best we won't rest
Till we rip open you're chest and play hopscotch
We will kill it just watch you're not real like sasquatch and mermaids
When we win there will be a parade in our name

[Verse 5: The Real Ice Cream Man]
So step up your game you lame
Put you to shame
Proclaim the stage names that are critically acclaimed
Leave you maimed its all the same your the one to blame
While 49 in the hall of fame
Hashtag nom is the name, Bitch

[Verse 6: Ryan Flip-Flop]
ATC that stands for anti-Tyler club
Can't you see Tyler as no friends
Sumos are you twins
Do people like you it depends is your name Tyler?

[Verse 7: The Real Ice Cream Man]
I'm just a swifter bigger bitter blister shape shifter mister tounge twister known killer of your young sister
49 is realer than you wanna be killers
Just wanted you to know what the deal is
Before we kill it
We on some real shit

[Verse 8: Ryan Flip-Flop]
Were also on the Golden Mountains
In front of my house are golden fountains
'Scuse me are you doubting our skill
What are you a Bill?
Every track we kill, destroy you against your own will

[Verse 9: The Real Ice Cream Man]
This is 49 world domination
Hashtag nom narration
Music for the duration of your vacation
Our dictation sweeps the nations and plays on the stations
Critics feel elation on location
Our music gives sensations

[Verse 10: Ryan Flip-Flop]
I'm not a good doctor
I kill all of my patients
And hide them in hidden locations
Kill you in mixtapes is what ill do
Challenge me to a duel but there can only be one rule
It's that 49 winsThe worst of the worst, very blessed to be honest
See words as my worth, keep em dressed up n polished
Like pleats in my shirt, cologne and corsages
Sins in the dirt, a corpse in the coffin
Often, reclusin' in the studio, wonder if its haunted
Eyes skewed to the door, heard knuckles knockin
But it was just a kickdrum, I'm buggin off coffee
Had to pause the track, take a breathe and get off it
Eyes all glossy, 5 hours passed me
Feelin wired up like FBI tryina tap me
Antsy, figured I'ma call it a night
Look in the mirror swore I saw the ghost of gatsby alive[Intro]
I'm dark skinned so please don't take me lightly
Stogie in my hand, begging, "Please light me"
Again, don't this feel like '96 or '95?
It was in his hand with this dude, while I drive

[Verse 1]
Pass out in the sheets with a freak, should I creep with her?
I'm too tired, we don't fuck, I just sleep with her
And baby momma's still pasty
She found the rubbers in my dresser (God bless her)
Third trimester I don't really wanna stress her
So daddy will deny her, orgasms I supply 'em
To the women that inspired all the rhymes I wrote
And kill millions of civilians with the nines I tote
I'm just young, dumb and ignorant
I couldn't go to college so I settled to be a nigga then paper chasing
I wonder if the government formulating
This chemistry that got 'em rich niggas paper racist
It seems that I'm a goner, so I escape aromas
Of that hate with weed and marijuana
And conforming is what I'm living with
Cause you die if you different, and now I'm smoking

[Outro]
And don't this feel like '95 nigga...[Intro: RZA]

[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
The burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash
We got females that got it like that
The golden childs that bone the crowd
See, niggas in the place that bit my style
Well, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers
Wu Tang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pants-uh

[Ghostface Killah]
Y'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough
Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything that's the god's honest beyond
We airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on
Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka

[Raekwon the Chef]
Yo, I drink heavy gallons of Crew, play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up
We all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'
Lines come digital stupid, plus ain't got
No jewelry on, bet I'm still live and I'm coopin'
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react and sippin' Cog-i-nac so relax dude
Know I'm with these cracks dude

[ODB]
Yo, 1-2
Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn, Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn... ZOO!

[Cappadonna]
It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush they karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll deep, with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler, AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand

[Method Man]
I remember in the elevators when we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us, (uh)
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cuz she lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them

[Genius/GZA]
We got a history, full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough it ain't no mystery
Long vision, from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast, with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock

[Inspectah Deck]
We grindin', down to the bone
My name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with Chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes, with minds right, we choose Queens

[Masta Killa]
Yeah we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing
On the crime scene
Body on the block
Eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still had a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the master
Disaster, gotta blast ya, cuz I hafta

[U-God]
The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed off, cuz you worship the gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's head off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like, Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain curly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash"Things take a turn for the worse"
"Send him back where he came from"
"We got shots fired down the street"

[Doom]
Ba-di-yahhhh
Alright, steady
Ba-di-yah, ba-di-yah

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded then {*AHEM*}

Good to the last drop niglets
Hood 'til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses' dicks or higher
Beatwalkers still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth, play alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them nosy federalies yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your Nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell get lighted on sight
The ringer's on a need-to-know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you're on your own, acted alone
Back home your fam'll be provided for while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice bring back eyes, fingers, toes and pictures
Send copies to those who singin' the blues
Mothers and fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send them a message, let them P.O.W.'s go
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty
A new way to let the shots spray
A few drops a day, double espresso, D.A. latte
No smell nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor paid to get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stresses
A long list of C.O.'s names and addresses
A fake judge with many years on the bench
That sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched
The whole system scared in doubt with a fear stench
And she was tortured, some say post-mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught him
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part when Terminator killed Tookie
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded, son, then shit
Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud, red flood

"Villain"

[Outro]
One of the things we ran into the unknown
We we couldn't get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to
And once we did, finally pull the door and breach the interior door
There's a man trapped inside of it
Basically that man trap is a cage
'Fore we run in, we're stuck in there and they can shoot us
While we're just, we're stuck in a cage[Verse 1: Tommy Faucets]
I'm not you're average teenager
I walk around with a Motorola pager
I always bet high wagers
Cause simple I don't care
Put your hands in the air
So I can give ya free body shots
I can fix ya song, call me Tommy Doc
With the crazy socks and the big cock
And big booty bitches in my huge yacht
You could have all this if you would like
All you gotta do is start from where you at
Maybe with the huffy bike
It really was the struggle for the fucking team
But we joined together like a fucking seam
But it seems that the team would want a challenge
I am the leader but the pressure is balanced
But it never fazes us, cause my niggas be blazing up
And we just trying to beat the numbers
Cause if we don't we won't have any covers
But you'll never catch us sleeping or weeping
Cause we always winning and pinning the opponent
And we can identify the opponent as grown men
And can't none of them fuck with the TEN Boy

[Verse 2: Frosty Duplex]
I'm said fast and I'm furious
You niggas trash and I'm curious
And identify when I'm so fly into the sky
But I'm school like the blue like the blues clues
I'm so nice but I gotta be nicer, so I gotta be precise
On the beat when I go cause I realize its to steep
I gotta keep never borrow cause
I don't want to stop for tomorrow
And I'mma do what I gotta do to keep it true
So I'mma influence you to follow me
Follow me follow me
I'm the leader, so if you want to go down I got the liter
Liter, meter yeah I mistreat her
So I'm about to bag and I put it in the hand
I'm to cool for new school I'm on that
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on more
Two more, I sore, I'm hardcore
Cause I know I'm about to bring the bass to the freakin' floor
Put your hands in the air, listen up kid
I'm about to go ahead and feed you with the no bibs
I'm about to go in, I'm going in as I do
So I'mma go ahead and I'mma make sure I'm throughTo be honest I was never known to ball
Back in third grade I was takin' Adderall
ADHD had me bouncing off the walls
But by the seventh grade I just told myself stop
Cause I had to an appetite to attend to
By the next year I was learnin how to roll doobs
Your half an half like CatDog not fully you
Plus your full of yourself. Been a long time since I took shrooms
You fruits is like tulips, infecting your manure no amusement for excuses
Ain't buyin' into silly bullshit can't produce it
Not aware of what that sounds like. I'mma rap what I wanna write
Word to Riff, if you bite catch rabies
I'm now on MF DOOM's Favorite Ladies
90's baby without a single baby
Tend to keep it that way no controls to play me
Life's too short to give a fuck about acceptance
Yall quit after the first meal I'm headin back for seconds
Pull out the bag of peas and start to ease down the swellin'
If you hatin' pull out a piece and aim it at your melon
Open up your mind if you think that way
Its sad you can't admit you love the sound that we make
I just wish shit would change like I goin' the whole day
Without putting down a j and my amount will stay the same
In my bag I complain when my bud runs out
Sweet like the syrup they servin while dining at the waffle house
Call me corny I don't care, I won't let it sink in
I'll keep pissin' yall off and I'll be rappin' again[DOOM]
The beat is sicker than the blood in your stool
The way it repeats can trick ya like a stuttering fool
Uttering butter king jewels
His mudda been cool
Schooled on how to wash away the crud in the drool pool
Made his chrome dome glisten
At first he couldn't tell she had a chromosome missin'
Kept a spare somewhere
In these underwear, he swear
To helped her get the gum out her hair
They need to get they thumb out they rears
And show some skills the one time they come out in years
Instead of dumbin' out in fears of they own shadow
In a game that swell 'em up to dead 'em like cattle
Take your rattle and skadaddle
Before you get a whippin' with the pen and pad paddle
Ghouls, got 'em modeling gear
He came with more rhymes than molecules in air

The track was like a thorn in his back
As for the rhymes, I'll give y'all fair warnin', it's crack
Whoever start smokin', come back
Quit, or catch a heart attack up in some bum shack
Sharper than a thumb tack
His body was a temple made of chemicals to the dimple
To him still it wasn't so simple
Kept his right and left hand beefin'
One knockin' teeth in, the other one chiefin'
But first, this song'll make you wanna stomp ya ten toes
Swooped up hooptie Pinto off a pimp my whip
Before they put the system in and had it all stripped
It ain't no need to trip
Indeed he ripped scripts from here to Jebip
Get a grip, leave it a dag mess for beer
Burnin' like a bag of schwag cess in the airYea.....that's right
Hardy Boys shit...uh huh
Smoke a Winston to this shit nigga
Word up bout to fuckin' throw ya head up, Yea

Yo, yo he got his stones from Greece
In mouth he had like thirty plus karats
Big ratchets, smoke cigars like a Bogart classic
Told niggas if he dies he want a glass casket
Parents died when he was five years old
Made his way inside the US with Colombian Gold
A fake name and a passport
Benetton luggage, one sister, pretty thing, light skin
Niggas will body over her like fuck it
With a scar by her left eye
Her brother Alex was extremely close, he sold coats and minks
Had trays put in toilets and sinks
Loved to roller skate, ninety nine did time up in Rahway
Came home blown, the thorough kings and soldiers
Never gave a fuck about that MC beef in Queens
Alex, he was a rich nigga
He had close to ten bodies under his belt
His man did the last one and got murdered himself
Took him a while to get his head together
Alex one day out in LA, made a call in New York
Told his man Oc, God it's goin' down, fly the whole team in for support
Remember that Ray shit that Jamie Foxx played? That was my shit
I never got paid, they got rich off a stolen script
In ninety eight I seen Charles on the Cali strip
Showed him the copyrights, his life in the real flick
In Braille, he read it in no time
Hit me with his math, said I'll give you some more lines
Real talk, stand up dude
Said how you like Jamie Foxx to replay you? He said yea that's cool
But under one circumstance, you think he can bow my walk, flip my talk and my hands?
I said sure why not, he can imitate anything trust me this young boy hot
Shook his hand then I bounced in the limo
Grabbed my cell, bit my cigar and then rolled down the window
Contacted Stony Brook and Roberts
Told them we got it in ten ?, yo Ray Ray signed it
Now we can move on and shoot this live shit
With mad options, Paramount and DreamWorks we shop it
Or Mandalay and New Line cop it
I go and get ten mil' and blow it on the independent market
But anyway down in PF Changs, I had a meeting with this rich investor
Said they'll throw twenty million on the kid's film only if he chose the cast
He was drunk, he was talkin' real fast
So I test his mouth, laid back then I put him on blast
Where exactly we gon' get this cash?
I gotta ill Gotti Gigante connect
Wise guys that kill Bulotti, catching bodies, earnin' respect
The waiter came in a dropped off the shrimp fried rice he ordered
I said thanks as he poured my water
Then out came the veggie rolls, sesame chicken and mint tea
Rice wine had me wanting to pee
Said excuse me I'll be right back, pardon me
Grabbed his glass and he nodded to me
Skated off to take a piss, the shit felt like a nut
Got back the dude vanished, briefcase, script, and all
Ask the waiter where he go, the motherfucker spoke Spanish[Verse]
So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
Daily told the people "You can call me Your Majesty!"
Keep your battery charged
You know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter
Peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (Your mother)
Don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try
Villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you
It's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

[Outro]
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop!* like snot bubblesThey fail to practice what they preach, since you are what you eat that's why kept it in tongue in cheek
And why every word they muttered just seems to udderly reak
Put that in Layman's terms, you guys are ass so to speak
Rolling in the deep with no paddle, the famous creek
Save yo babble that shit is weak, kick up gravel,shatter yo teeth
Never reveled around yo ankle,prepare now for yo defeat
You rather run through Mozambique in a pointed white satin sheet,
Crane kick the kitchen counter, tip that drink from cattle's teat
Then I straddle nearest seat to observe if you'll really weap,
As l Velcro, my orthopedic sneaks, that squeak, 2 left feet slowly shuffle into the street
Yell there goes my ride before I slide off in Missy's Jeep, BEEP beep you're welcome to come too
Timothy Mosley put an APB out for Magoo swerve onto curb, we just barely missed a Jew
About to get fuk'd, Sarah Jay walking the avenue
Power steering started breaking like electric boogaloo passenger window
You glide right though, no seat belt tally the shock value
The scene looks like there a clean up on aisle 2
That head gash, red glass looks like clashed ragoo
Steadfast they spead past they didn't know it was you,
Posted with the crew thinking what da hell should we do this can happen to you if you allergic to cereal
Oooh[Sample]
One more beer
And I'll take you all
All of you

[Intro]
Banned from all bars
The man with seven scars

[Verse: 1]
Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fell
Sunday in the A-T-L and I'm all outta ale
Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail
Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell?
Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well
Since last week the bootlegger been in jail
If all else fail, inhale the L
Makin sure they can't see your sale via snail mail
Mind like a sewer, servin rhyme on a skewer
DOOM'll step to a fine dime like he knew her
"My black sister"
She said "Step back" before he kissed her
She did the dipper and the smack just missed her
There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger
99% of rap is just a friendly listener
I'm like these dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all
Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball
Y'all know it's time for the end, when the day come
Buy an album, get rudely insulted over fake drums
Same CD's you get for free, you break 'em
Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like Steak-ummm
Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paprika?
One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker
Every week or so peeked out the lab though, eureka
A technique to keep somethin uniquer in your speaker
For yo' information, I didn't do the beat y'all
It ain't my fault, if she didn't move her feet at all
Skeeter, robbed Peter to pay Paul
So he could trick it on Mary so she can play ball

[Hook]
... Better have my scrilla
And cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holey moley, did you get a load of her Roley Poley?
Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me
Whoever don't feel him, Feel balls like a goalie

[Verse: 2]
One for the money, two for the better green
3-4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
Told the knock kneed ghetto queen get the head fiend
Tell him it's for Medallin and use oxcyocetaline
Who needs airplay, it's all just hearsay
Leave a wig like it was having a bad hair day
Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret
He said 'Shasta', and turned to formaldehyde faster
When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily
One night she tried to flail me with her ukulele
Pack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat
With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat

They better have my scrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley?
Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me[Sample: Saul Williams]
(Fuck You!)
I stand on the corner of the block slinging amethyst rocks
Drinking 40s of mother earth’s private nectar stock
Dodging cops, cuz’ 50 be the 666 and I need a fix of that purple rain:
The type of shit that drives membranes insane
Oh yeah, I’m in the fast lane snorting candy yams
That free my body and soul and send me like Shazaam
Never question who I am, God knows, and I know God personally
In fact he lets me call him “me,”

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
When did rap turn into a fashion show?
Too many makeup artists won't let their passion show
The anti-social mogul, havin' 20/20 visions
In needa bifocals, for your eyes dilated ojos
Open wide, never did I owe hoes
Suck a dick dilated, tell my old hoes
Hit my main bitch in the Poconos
I'm not Pinocchio, I never lied I poke her nose
With the dopest dope, brand new Pablo, brand new God flow
It feel like, Escobar and Apollo
Swank apparel, I put a pic on the site ‘ya megabytes
Y'all niggas ticking me off like headlights
Get your head right, it all falls down
I bread right on the house
Eye was on 106 & Park and still on the couch like, Bitch fuck Jacob
I went to meet my maker, with 25 sacred stones
Told him save me a few acres

[Interlude]
Yeah, cause' we just some Amethyst Rockstars
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Try aim at this Rock Star!
Time just keeps on falling, falling, falling

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
How is Hip-Hop dead? I'm still makin' a killin'
Banana clip peelin' and ho's I'm still stealin'
This is not for the soda pop niggas
Take me to the leader of the new school or the block dealas
Cause all these fakes mcs take from those figures
Is what get fake MC's infront of loose triggers
Can't knock the hustle though, I may just bust a jigga
And lookin' through my eyes, you can kinda get the picture
Mo money mo problems as you get notorious, inglorious, until you're a big Victorious, no show
Only way you get to see the kid is through a photo
Or burn-ed up logos, and the females come out at night
And when they find the pot a gold they strike, seducing me?
Wait y-y-yeah, you nice on the mic, yeah yeah, you lookin' right
Yeah, you just my type, yo
(Bitch, don't get me tight!)
Her friend split and dipped, damn I should've seen this
I'm in a boobie trap and thats some clever ass cleavage
Well, I think with my dick, I know you want to blow my mind for that reason
She said "You got clever speaking"
And after I'm done, I still got it leaking
I dipped off ‘cause knowledge a nigga is still seekin'
What you lookin' at son? I might rob you blind
Defined by every line, niggas tryin' to outshine
We’re both number one enemies, it’s sad though
One on one, and it takes two niggas to tango
Two niggas to tango
Watch me go Rambo

[Outro]
"Don’t Front on a nigga like me
Time just keeps on falling, falling, falling"

[Interlude]

YO!YO!YO!YO! (8X)
