[Hook x2]
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em
I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
My 2nd or 3rd trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild, ta-dow
I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground
All that other shit, sugarcoated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and going dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

[Hook (x2):]
Tell me when to go (x4)
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 2: Keak Da Sneak]
I'm off that 18 dummy juice
Nigga yadadamean? Labeled the Black Zeus
King of the super duper hyphy (hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy)
And your wifey he don't like me (like me, like me, like me, like me)
From the Bay to the A
Put me in a Backwood, Swisher sweet bud, orange lace (Let's go, it's dope)
It's just some shit I wrote, I said they couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)
I slid past on the gas, bitches looking at me
It's good, it's good like the granddaddy
Cross game, you get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged, pass me a big old fatty
I drink white, with a snow bunny
Talking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy
1800, Jose Cuervo
Yadadamean? Yadada I'm saying though?

[Hook x2]

[Outro: E-40]
Now let me direct traffic for a minute
(talk to 'em)
Now, let me tell you about this hyphy movement we got going in the bay
When I say something you say it right back to me, you smell me?
We're gonna do it like this right here

[X2]
Ghostride the whip, ghostride the whip
Ghostride the whip, ghostride the whip
Now scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape
Now scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape
Put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on
Now gas, brake, dip, dip
Gas, brake, dip, dip
Shake them dreads, shake them dreads
Shake them dreads, shake them dreads
Let me see you show your grill, let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill, let me see you show your grill
Now thizz face, thizz face
Thizz face, thizz face
Doors open, mayne
Doors open, mayne

Doors open, mayne
Now watch em swang, watch em swang
Now watch em swang, watch em swang
Go stupid, go dumb, dumb
Go stupid, go dumb, dumb

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
Somethin' went off in my hand on my strap
But I'm smoking purple sipping 'yac
Inhaler I'm primatene mist causin' asthma attacks
Hitting niggas taking early fades gap backs

Direct the scene shoot them with cannon
So how you wanna act?
Bunnating, oppolating the sizzle
In the cut alone for doing my thizzle

Ohing drinking throwing up the hundreds
Solo, but on the low my buddy (My buddy)
Doing hella shit at one time
My definition of hyphy man is thizzing, sniffing lines

I'm in the building and I'm feeling like yee!
R.I.P. to the Mac D.R.E
So don't don't stop keep it going (Keep it going)

With some Privilege in the back boy blowing (Blowing)
Hold it down for the bay repping Oakland
If it wasn't for that granddaddy smokin' (Dadida)

[Verse 2]
Ooh ahh ooh aah do a little shit
Br-a-b-b-b-bay have I lost it? You still with me?
Fazeeking keaking and sneaking
All N Da Doe wit da nappy 'fro I'm still freaky
On citas, bonitas senoritas

Turn the tool is the way they stay up on the feature
I see my nigga in the traffic, wassup-e?
Brotha by another motha, first 'cuz, worst bloody
I mixed big with husky brusky

Quarterbackin', trust me, rugby rush me
Color purple still in the sweet it's ugly
I don't know you but you loving me fresher than Doug E
Look at what the motherfucking rap game done to me

To a grown nigga run the beat
Here comes Keak Da Sneak
Sell talk, what to do with technique, nothing but heat
Sell talk, what to do on this beat, this for the street

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 3]
First, second verse, this my third
Sixth grade driving to school I had a Firebird
I don't think they knowing that's my word
Oh you hip now? I was problem child you was nerd

I was being bad you was being good
But all this time had a destiny to save the hood
All that shit I been through look at me now
I'm striking like a match, man, back to tha town (Back to the town)

Bennie cap fowl and my mug on mean (Mean)
Waking up your family with 4 15's (4 15's)
In the driveway they can't stand me
Die hard Raider Sneak Davis, Draft Randy
Moss (Sukasuk)

Put it on thick like MAC lip gloss (MAC lip gloss)
Oh inhale that shit mayne I ain't taking a loss
But pay, this shit cost cause I been had sauce

Droppin back in the pocket bout to hit sum

[Hook]

[Verse 3-Mistah F.A.B.]

I'm tryin to yell "Timber!" after breakin ya left limb
Foolin wit a light weight, wit a feather in my brim

We went to go satisfy a High Tech pimp
Wide enough to grip
Walkin wit a limp

Too many years have gone by we're still strugglin
We fuss and fight think it's time for new boogining
But everytime I think that I just can't take no more
I pack my bags change my mind and I never go
Should I go, should I stay, should I go

See ma you runnin me away with ya ways
Got me leavin and not comin home til the next day
And I ain't never comin back to the house til I get some respect
Or I'ma be up in jail for breakin ya neck
I done tried to hard just to make things work
And arguments go too far til ya feelings get hurt
They got me packin my bags but you don't want me to go
Now I'm off to the next braud but I ain't feelin this ho
I did it fast but now I'm tryin to live life slow
But I'm a man so I reap what I sew
It ain't all about dough cuz you can't take that witcha
And it seems like you want me to hitcha
So before I do that I'ma leave everything behind
No 30 days when I avict you out my mind, before I do that

See I hustle to get money just to catch yo eye
Can't incriminate myself, that's why I lie
They say it takes a man to be a man and I'm a grown one
This rap game got me on one
And it's a destiny thang, so I don't wear a platinum watch and a chain
I'm just tryin to head shot ya brain
You can catch me in a 2K3 Range, 4 point some change
Drinkin Remy, blowin zips of the pain
You want a L7 lame, or a nigga in the game
You a thug, he tryin to make you the same

Haters beware, We attack like wild bears
Ho stare at a player, Kickers like Nike Air
The crowd up'll stare
Security push me in the do', Cause I'm all in the dough, Popped in my collar like a snare
Recognize the lil trick at the bar wit her square
Swear she dope like she real, But she's fake like her hair
While ya hatin movin ya mouth I'm makin moves wit my life
Ya kissin her all in her mouth, I'm face fuckin ya wife!

Straight come from it, Niggas love ya sister
Some niggas go all out and let her
Tryin to turn a ho into a housewife, Don't wanna quit em
You spike biatch, It's wrong how you did em, did em
Slipped up and called you another name
Sympathy'll cripple ya game

I get stupid dumb di-d-dumb
Ice king baby and I have plenty fun
I go 18 since I was 18
I got more chains than the nigga from the a-team
Sideshows ghostride the whip
Hey lil momma go on shake them hips
Go on shake them hips, what it do
Ride glasspacks 24's on the shoes

Fast like a nascar nascar nascar nascar (8x)

Eeerr, sidewayz, this way that-a-way
With a gallon of that muthafuckin tanqueray
On my way to get the Cut dawg lifted
Slap these marshall faulks on so I don't hit this bitch
Yeah ho, all in the doe
The money and the dimepiece rims are spinnin whaddi-hittin fo
Winnin don't know how to lose
She choose she tearin it off if she do
Knockin but stock, holdup, I done fucked around and blew a fuse
Circuit breakers, want my mule and 40 acres
I break it, shake it to the curb
That's my word, I'm just crumblin herb

Fast like a nascar nascar nascar nascar (8x)[Keak Da Sneak]
And you can catch me in Bent red artlidge, 2K3 Bentley
Leader not a follower so don't ask who sent me
Paid for, no lease and you can't rent me
Still grinding worth grand Bobby and Whitney
X pills keep you up all night
Bottles of everything and that guada green light
I'm in the club like 50, not Shady Aftermath
Tricks treat em like they offset, I'm the number one draft
Wholes not halfs a nickel thirty six
And raw, raw raw raw raw like the top of the rick
I hit like rick drums kick and claps
Six 15's zeus zap on my lap
Keep a fadango rolled boy I never would crap
Paystyles no longer free when I rap
I adapt in any 'viroment or the weather
Got many personalities, nigga my mouthpiece is cheddar

[Hook]
This how I ride like it ain't no tomorrow, don't beg or borrow
We take shit, and seperate our stuff from the fake shit
The jam start sockin, make ya feel like a quake hit
The whole block rockin with intention to shake shit
Now this (should be played at hi volume, resedential)
Now this (should be played at hi volume, resedential)
Now this (should be played at hi volume, resedential)
Now this (should be played at hi volume, resedential)

[Keak Da Sneak]
And my watch I can't even pronounce
That cost three huned thousand tax in the states in year round be my account
All I wear is gucci and louie, ice berg
My mistress will get you down, she cop me that throw back Spurs
Get yours, the voices in my head be tellin me
You misdemeanor I'm a felony, give up sports and start sellin D
Now I'm like waitin on the rap shit
Assholes and elbows, get up in ya like catpiss
Quiet on the set I'm recordin
Caught my first trial then I faded just like Michael Jordan
Stompin in my Air Force 1's
Blockin niggas, strong armin with no gun
I rap for funds, mucho denero
Got my hoes bringin me 10 G's a night, the cousin Nefero
I just jet like this and get a battery charge
Pimpin and playin, I tell ya Keak Da Sneak is hard

[Hook]

[Keak Da Sneak]
I sell my rock in the studio or the streets
Gone blow up but not cuz I'm signed to a Dre or a Pac beat
On the Rick Rock sheet, and no I'm not the best kept secret
Cuz everybody know about this Keak Da Sneak shit
Danger! Not Mystikal but get on the flo'
The man right chear, All In Moe Doe
My style my flow is original as hell
Cuz who is who in this industry, I just can't tell
Everybody sound like Nas or Jay-Z or Jadakiss
Nelly or Ja Rule nigga I hate this shit
I come wit that shit you never heard befo'
And everybody say "fa sheezy" but where my credit though
East Oakland make that work
10-Deuce and Walnut trick fuck what you heard
Quit sayin you sellin birds like you wanna get caught
Cuz if niggas accidentally snitch on you it's all yo fault
And quit tryin to put 2Pac Shakur in ya rhymes
Niggas get shot for being at the wrong place at the wrong time
Left shirt and show ya bullet wounds off to ya ho
But you don't really wanna get shot no mo', that's why

Trunk soundin like Godzilla, and King Kong, back there thumpin
All we do is WIC, and get high and petal and push!

I cut the the wheel well, on my whip, and filled that bitch up
And now muscle car sittin up high like a monster truck
Monster up', suck up to none, don't be no poodle
Split his pack open like pack of Top Ramen noodle
In the heart of the soil, where you can find me
Try me fuck boi', and get your face put on a white tee

Return of the skitzo
Maniac, flip so

Album: Tha Hall of Game
Song: Ring It

Leave your message at the beep *BEEP*

Hah! Mmmhmmm. Yeah, uhh... on my pager!
What you say? Oh yeah. Kick that shit then nigga!

Verse One: Keek tha Sneak, E-40, Spice-1

Higher than a bird, off that herb, in the O-A-K
Off on perv, parked on curb, rollin up a vay
Licked it three times, laced it with the Alize
About twomp a day, baby hit me frequent-lay!
Sneak, and Forty, from chocolate short-ay, we been
All prepared, cause my nights is no day, the broad say
I last! Cause you six months
But I say, she pullin a gang of major stunts

Bust, bust niggas, consequences when you're doin the do
Fuck around and get caught up in a catch twenty-two
In the area! Dirt and dust
Where the yah! B.A. Plus
But ain't yo sista Suga-T? (Suga-T)
Ain't you the one that say Sprinkle Me (Sprinkle Me)
I loves me some Forty-Ridah
I seen you up in 2Pac's video poppin your collar

I play this playa shit like Bugs Bunny
Ain't no cartoon figure nigga I makes money, ain't nuttin funny
If you're ever in some funk, call your potnah on the cell
And leave one-eighty-seven, at the end of the number
B-uh-Benzy on Washington, on the cellular phone
You could tell that the Easy Bay was his home
My people goin off like a high school build'
And all my money in stacks, and all my pockets on swell
M-uh-mobbin like a playa, but I'm still a G doe
Pager goin off like C-3PO
Time for the Hurricane, E said word
I put a nigga on his back, fuck what you heard

Chorus: repeat 2X

If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it, ring my telephone, ring my telephone

Verse Two: E-40, Harm

I be so rebel-yalous
When I'm talkin on my phone-telyalous
You can have my baitch, but I maintain
I chop it up as a loss and charge it to the game
She said you must be playin some kind of phone tag
Cause erytime I hit you, you don't hit me back
Why is dat? Cause you're hella hard to get in contact with
Thought you thought, was killin big girl was crackin on some crabs
Six o'clock, the girl said that's my crib be at the West plus
Due to go, left me at home be leavin my ass up in the living room all alone
And I be starvin rubbin my monkey fiendin for some Donkey Kong
Now you're talkin, let's get the show on the road
I know you're tired of barkin, you need to hop on my load
So we can stab out, strike rock and Arroyo Park
At the top of hill, so I can check your oil

I said ah one to the two ah two to two three
Tell me why your baby momma keep on pagin me
I didn't give the ho the number, so why does she call
She says she wanna do me, and all of y'all
But I'm like that nigga on The Mack, I don't want the honey
I want the money some of you niggas is funny style and meanwhile
I'm sellin my piece to these tricks cause it's the paperchase
Laced with game, see I'm livin in the hustlers dream
Call up a player if it's major
Specially if it's scrilla nigga hit me on my pager

Chorus

Verse Three: Sneak, E-40

Rang it, baby gimme a call
My name you're screamin, how I be hittin them walls
You got me tinglin, how you be workin them drawers
With a kiss I make em all say this, yeah that's raw
I glance your cut, bass we uhh, big cheeks
With a blast headin straight for the nut, big A&H
Got some bitches all in the cut, it's that season
Drop my number to the ho to hit me up

Yo, you're nine-one-oneing me to death, what's all that fo'
Got my Williams and fillin my pager and pager on the overflo'
What's happenin with all that old bullshit
Is it really all that damn serious
You're draining the hell out of my battery
Got your partner thinkin curious
Cause in the Y-E-A A-R-E-A the game ain't constipated
Buckin around in the Golden State where the game originated
Fools be scandalous they used to be squares be turnin vicious
Hit me on pager, hit me if it's major

Chorus 2X[Verse 1]
Somethin' went off in my hand on my strap
But I'm smoking purple sipping 'yac
Inhaler I'm primatene mist causin' asthma attacks
Hitting niggas taking early fades gap backs

Direct the scene shoot them with cannon
So how you wanna act?
Bunnating, oppolating the sizzle
In the cut alone for doing my thizzle

Ohing drinking throwing up the hundreds
Solo, but on the low my buddy (My buddy)
Doing hella shit at one time
My definition of hyphy man is thizzing, sniffing lines

I'm in the building and I'm feeling like yee!
R.I.P. to the Mac D.R.E
So don't don't stop keep it going (Keep it going)

With some Privilege in the back boy blowing (Blowing)
Hold it down for the bay repping Oakland
If it wasn't for that granddaddy smokin' (Dadida)

I don't think they knowing that's my word (Fasheezy)
I don't think they don't that's my word

[Verse 2]
Ooh ahh ooh aah do a little shit
Br-a-b-b-b-bay have I lost it? You still with me?
Fazeeking keaking and sneaking
All N Da Doe wit da nappy 'fro I'm still freaky
On citas, bonitas senoritas

Turn the tool is the way they stay up on the feature
I see my nigga in the traffic, wassup-e?
Brotha by another motha, first 'cuz, worst bloody
I mixed big with husky brusky

Quarterbackin', trust me, rugby rush me
Color purple still in the sweet it's ugly
I don't know you but you loving me fresher than Doug E
Look at what the motherfucking rap game done to me

To a grown nigga run the beat
Here comes Keak Da Sneak
Sell talk, what to do with technique, nothing but heat
Sell talk, what to do on this beat, this for the street

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 3]
First, second verse, this my third
Sixth grade driving to school I had a Firebird
I don't think they knowing that's my word
Oh you hip now? I was problem child you was nerd

I was being bad you was being good
But all this time had a destiny to save the hood
All that shit I been through look at me now
I'm striking like a match, man, back to tha town (Back to the town)

Bennie cap fowl and my mug on mean (Mean)
Waking up your family with 4 15's (4 15's)
In the driveway they can't stand me
Die hard Raider Sneak Davis, Draft Randy
Moss (Sukasuk)
Boss gonna be flossing (Floss)
Put it on thick like MAC lip gloss (MAC lip gloss)
Oh inhale that shit mayne I ain't taking a loss
But pay, this shit cost cause I been had sauce

[Repeat Hook][Hook x2]
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em
I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
My 2nd or 3rd trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild, ta-dow
I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground
All that other shit, sugarcoated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and going dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

[Hook (x2):]
Tell me when to go (x4)
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 2: Keak Da Sneak]
I'm off that 18 dummy juice
Nigga yadadamean? Labeled the Black Zeus
King of the super duper hyphy (hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy)
And your wifey he don't like me (like me, like me, like me, like me)
From the Bay to the A
Put me in a Backwood, Swisher sweet bud, orange lace (Let's go, it's dope)
It's just some shit I wrote, I said they couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)
I slid past on the gas, bitches looking at me
It's good, it's good like the granddaddy
Cross game, you get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged, pass me a big old fatty
I drink white, with a snow bunny
Talking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy
1800, Jose Cuervo
Yadadamean? Yadada I'm saying though?

[Hook x2]

[Outro: E-40]
Now let me direct traffic for a minute
(talk to 'em)
Now, let me tell you about this hyphy movement we got going in the bay
When I say something you say it right back to me, you smell me?
We're gonna do it like this right here

[X2]
Ghostride the whip, ghostride the whip
Ghostride the whip, ghostride the whip
Now scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape
Now scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape
Put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on

Now gas, brake, dip, dip
Gas, brake, dip, dip
Shake them dreads, shake them dreads
Shake them dreads, shake them dreads
Let me see you show your grill, let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill, let me see you show your grill
Now thizz face, thizz face

Go stupid, go dumb, dumb
Go stupid, go dumb, dumb

[Hook x2][Keak Da Sneak]
My family roll thick like syrup and milkshakes
Transporting weight from the south to the golden state
Swingin' figure 8's, burnin rubber its hypo
In the middle of the intersection, tryin to start up a side-show
My mind go in other places cats dont speak on
Da Raw and uncut, for you niggas to tweak on
I flip on suckas as they come out rappin
So imagine whats gon' happen when I catch you in traffic
Who sell the most records in the bay(You?)
Indepentent label(You?) No video and radio play? (You?)
Its been 86 murders since the start of 2002
When niggas bang turfs for the work
Not that red and blue, and every single block is a street
When niggas hold it down cause you know we gotta eat
They call me Keak Sneak, but my real name is Kunta-Kentay B-O-W-E-N

[Hook: repeat 2X]
My nigga told me dont be scared, cause I'mma run the streets
Just like t-shirt, blue jeans, and Nikes
Coke white t-shirt, blue jeans, and Nikes
Stay strapped with the 45, I wish a nigga would try

[E-40]
Kick styles so unique and Exquisite
Gift of gab, and I spit it
I'm off this Gungie my ninja
I'm so damn twisted from smokin so much turtle I'm spliffed
Went to court and got acquitted the other day ago
So I wassa perkin early in the mornin, yawnin off
This HIGH SPEED CHASE SHIT! Damn near caught a case wit it
Hit the gas, Skeet Skirt, drivin fast, Skeet Skirt
In the slow lane, seein stars, goin against the grain
Slappin this shit, THAT'll FUCK WIT YA BRAIN BOY!
This is ya brain on thug(on thug) mode I suppose
Plenty hoes, Panty hose, 5 times sittin on vogues
24 inch toes, robbers, lookin out for the hella-kizz-noppers
We ain't proper, I'm off the main line
I represent heavy on the grizz 9, Intergame (Intergame)

[Hook]

[Keak Da Sneak]
I'm in the dope-fiend rental, tryin to paint the town
Four speed honda civic and I'm breakin it down (Breakin it down)
One head light plus I'm ridin spare
Thermometer say a hundred, I'm takin him there
It was me and Bra Heff, Ridin and smokin
Sidin' in Oakland, livin it up, cause the 8 frame broken
Coke white t-shirt, blue jeans, and Air Max
Came up Highstreet, stopped on Fairfax
Hit the liquor store, gotta get me a Remy
Copped some light from Lil' O, forgot the tank on empty
So I hit E-1-4 gimmie 10 on fo'
A box of Philly titans, and a short box of dem 'Ports
More for me, if a nigga dont smoke
And I knock the baddest hoes when I ain't on hundred spokes
Gimme head, lemme poke, errything on him
I know her nigga but she ain't feelin him

[Hook][Girl singing]
Too many years have gone by we're still strugglin
We fuss and fight think it's time for new boogining
But everytime I think that I just can't take no more
I pack my bags change my mind and I never go
Should I go, should I stay, should I go
I don't, really know

[Hook]
I don't really wanna go, I don't really wanna stay, nooo
I don't really wanna go, I don't really wanna stay, stay [2x]

[Keak Da Sneak]
See ma you runnin me away with ya ways
Got me leavin and not comin home til the next day
And I ain't never comin back to the house til I get some respect
Or I'ma be up in jail for breakin ya neck
I done tried to hard just to make things work
And arguments go too far til ya feelings get hurt
They got me packin my bags but you don't want me to go
Now I'm off to the next braud but I ain't feelin this ho
I did it fast but now I'm tryin to live life slow
But I'm a man so I reap what I sew
It ain't all about dough cuz you can't take that witcha
And it seems like you want me to hitcha
So before I do that I'ma leave everything behind
No 30 days when I avict you out my mind, before I do that

[Hook 2x]

[Girl singing]
I'd be wrong if I put all the blame on you
Cuz I admit through issues I got problems too
But what do you act sometimes like you don't give a damn
You leave me at home, all alone, when I really need my man, I

[Keak Da Sneak]
See I hustle to get money just to catch yo eye
Can't incriminate myself, that's why I lie
They say it takes a man to be a man and I'm a grown one
This rap game got me on one
And it's a destiny thang, so I don't wear a platinum watch and a chain
I'm just tryin to head shot ya brain
You can catch me in a 2K3 Range, 4 point some change
Drinkin Remy, blowin zips of the pain
You want a L7 lame, or a nigga in the game
You a thug, he tryin to make you the same

I need a, I need a woman that's down for adventure
To drive through a do not enter, skurr

[Hook 2x][Keak Da Sneak]
Cuz I came, I came to rock the mic right
Step up in this mutha fucka and get shit hype
Keak Da Sneak baby is the name I use
'95 Monte Carlo is what I cruise
I paid dues the game owed me one
Originator of "fa sheezy" take this game and run
And don't come back til you blow this shit up
Don't think just drink til you finish the cup
I came here to get you lit
Get you a red boy top of bottle, not a red nose pit
Keak Da Sneak baby known everywhere
Step in this rap game and spark shit like a flare
Way to cold at a younger age
It was everyday still in the car slangin yay
Hella years later still young in the game
I'm sharp as a Gillette razor with that Charlie Mac game

[Hook]
Keak Da Sneak baby known everywhere
Bitch don't act shy you in the presence of a player
When I grab my mic I'm the one man crew
Talkin bad bout me bitch you must be off ooh
When they heard Keak Da Sneak, Sneak came to town
Like Pac in his prime I be gettin around
On who? On you cuz this shit is real big
Know no laya in me cuz you know I love da kids

[Keak Da Sneak]
Dome shots to the face and all
And you can pray and pray for my downfall
This is destiny bitch you niggas in it to ball
Then get satisfied and let a nigga run in ya draws
Straight for ya safe then ya manhood took
Left tankin and tinkin, stomache we can't look
You can't visualize some of the shit I seen
So if you ain't ready for this game mayn go on come clean
Do ya yadadameen, I invented that shit
So before you put it out there you better holla at a pimp
Cuz I'm takin shit personal, it's feelings with this
Head up or music bitch I be killin ya shit
And I can't sleep til I know that you hit
Feedback, a nigga don't need in his mix
My usual fix, pound of Remy and a zip of light
Put hands and feet on yo ass like a nigga in a prize fight

[Hook]

[Keak Da Sneak]
And uhh no he ain't a Walnut gangsta
Yes I is, 2-4-7 on the block with anchor
Not in it for the small time, I gotta get mine
Playa hatin is a crime, you niggas way outta line
And I'm goin, goin, back, back to East Oakland
Ya dig, you know where it's at
Get em, getcha gotcha get em, hit em
Sicka bit em, the chee P-O, all in the do' nobody can fuck wit em
Bra Hef, Beanie, Dola Ike and Big Scoop
Look how long I waited, had patience for the loot
But we gone get there, I been at it since 1990
Went through hella fazes til I really just found me
Outsandin, and all my albums is poundin
I grown man outplayin intentional groundin
I been buildin Keak Da Sneak sine 9-8
For the group mayn a nigga couldn't wait, what's my name

[Hook]-Mac Dre-

-Keak Da Sneak-

Still highly national, still a killa wit murder flow
Still screaming  all in the do
Bet yo ass down fo, cuz that's the trade mark
Where nothing but brave hearts, thug relutional
Never thought when a muthafucka losing crutal
Collect the doe, thinking ahh and still counting it
Smoking by the pound you niggas still quarter ouncing it
Dry cut let it melt down bouncing it
Nine hundred thousand fo my kids allowance

Still gifted talented, from a notch to a bad bitch
Get mo then yo ass kicked depend on how mad I get
Genet razor dagger shit im leaving faces like naxima attics bitch
Im from mind over money and murder would manage shit
Without a sign, hearding some endings
Tragic shit you want to shine
You ain't fucking with us then who you wit
Thats a perfect way to get yo wig split

-PSD-

Um Hum

Get down foul, and im hurting patna
In da shows on my fo's
Call me curtain droppa
Can't you tell from the dirt in my nail
From down south to my turf of Vallejo
Addiction to this mail is sometin' worser then yell
Make a nigga hi spy something worser then hell
Riding GMC denale it no l's
Wood indegital video 4 12
Possessions are under a zip of weed no sales
For personal need be, give me the fin
With no jail, no jail[Intro:]
“Hello”
“Rick Rock”
“Has a message for…”
“The Bay Area”
“To accept the message press 1”

[Verse 1:]
(Ugh, ugh)
We flow for about five years ago, when we lost a down
But I had faith in the game
So I knew that one day that sooner or later it got to come back around
E-40 Water held his ground
Kept ma foot in the fast lane, flew uppidy on mesmerized
Cuz I snuck up in up out d game, you makin' a 40 Water cd
An get you penalized (penalized)I Promise you that you get your face kicked man (face kicked man)
Astonishing, you never know who know who beat you black an blue
Demolish you have you lookin' just like the bottom of ma shoe
The game, the game feeds off us (feeds off us)the industry an all the slangin speeches (speeches)
So we had to do what we like (do what we like)
Unite, come together like a fist to a mic
I'm from the block where they raise you up, tuck Glocks shot's blaze you up
Big shot niggas fade you up, I'm in the cut where they fade you up
5-0-9, you can page me but I'm a hustla
Bust you wit the Mac, never trust you wit the sack
In fact, when you ready get fetti out d Lac
I'll block patrol dead presidents an pesos, stack money an I chase hoes
I give em blues, tattooes on who to choose, quitters never win an I don't plan to lose
I check shoes, rich watch, an pocket books, been a crook
Califoolya made ya look

[Chorus:]
The lan of the hustlas an slick choppas
Ambulance gurneys an helicopters
Gangstaz an playas an street ballas
Game spittas like 40 the colla popper[x2]

[Verse 2:]
Hey boy, I'm a Bay boy
An I rep every block that I'm on, every city I roam
From the state that is golden, state where the youngstas keep holdin
Feds an the narcs be patrollin
Northern California, come an take a look (come an take a look)
Crankin' off the hook (crankin' off the hook)
Everybody's crooks (everybody's crooks)
They be bringin you robberies, you can come mob wit me
We can be violent we broke plus we smoke
Blow on the best of dro, it's Frisco, now who's the next to go?
The calico would make a playa hater rest fo' sho
Califoolya, San Quinn reppin' the moe
Yeah I run up in a party mayne an rep ma district
(An rep ma district), an run up on yo boy like “Nigga what is it?”
I sell each zones (uh huh), they sell like stones (uh huh)
Frisco, California we stay off them phones (ha-ha)
An I'll show you some thangs draw down, pull out the pilly son, an show you the rain
Show you poor hustla niggas the game like turnin one into two
It'll cost you more if I'm squattin em through
West Coast nigga! (West Coast nigga!), I'm just lettin' you know
The home of Scalen, Sic Wid It, an Death Row (whoo!)
You still get that blow an that doe an wear them watches wit the tic-tac-toe (what!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
(Yea)
This nice guy role's been a God damn cover up (ugh)
We ride on yo block wit the Mac, hit a nigga up (huh)
God damn it! It's Northern Califoolya (right) this Mac gon' do ya (ugh)
I swear it's gon' do ya (yea)
The thought's all wrong when it comes to this north side (north side)
I ain't lettin  mothafuckin shit slide (nah)
Gangsta, hustlas, pimps, dope dealers (ugh), tec's, Glock's, A-R's are real nigga
We shoot through your chest (ugh), cardiac arrest
Now you floatin through the sky, may God Bless
Who am I? Mr. Ski, apply pressure, the 40 Water call mi “SKI” (hey)
The most aggressive
I was raised up where we say “blood” an “cuz”
Gang bang, slang cane, breed killas an thugs
I gave up sports, an started sellin drugs
Use to be a car thief but now I spendin love to bars
I'm a star; I was born one (born one)ma jersey is throw back, but never toss ma gun
The task force hit the dock ma moms got stopped, ironic
An rep East O but not from New York son
I get money like Suge, Master P, an Russell an build up ma franchise cuz since the money is muscle
I fuck wit the switch in the front before an everybody says “fo' sheezy”
But where ma credit go?

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Northern Califoolya game
We've all been properly introduced
To uphold this yay mayne
Cuz if we don't check it from the womb
We gon' check it from the balloon
Still serve in mind I'm pushin the number one tea spoon
Northern Califoolya playin, mac's, pimp's, an ho slayers
Were made sharper than the Gillette blue blade straight out the pack
Cuz Northern Califoolya's the snake
To start the strike, clear folks an judges up have plenty of this light
So don't get caught up goin' to the spoon by noon
Ya dig?
Because you'll be missin that coochie cuz you be on yo way to the bitter hoochie(feat. Messy Marv & Matt Blaque)

Matt Blaque (Chorus):
Girl the things, the friends, the cars, the rims, the rich that I'm living
No me nothing without you, girl I'm nothing without you
Cuz baby girl you been my rock, my friend, my companion-cake
Can't imagine livin' within out you, girl I'm nothing without you, it's you

Keak Da Sneak (Verse):
I forgive, but don't forget; nobody else I can see myself with, but you
My best friend, my wife, my flavor, my type
You hear the song, you got me on this hot, taught me a lot
On my brain and my heart you got your own spot
Sporting out the rear, when you tell me that my song hot
Fast, you special, I'mma spit it off
You still the best, stay super fly, so fresh to death, I ain't kidding
Before money constantly came in, I get my changed up, I didn't change then
And I ain't gonna change now, the reason I love you to death
Baby you stay good

Matt Blaque (Chorus)

Messy Marv (Verse):
What's happenin'
She not on ya'll's back, but she is my addiction
Joke after, joke and nigga can't stay out of prison
But she stand with position and maintain your smile
When you came to this bitch, you knew a nigga was foul
That's why I wanna fly out and resort to the resorts
I let you do the feelin' when we doing the feelin' you feel or
It's back to the photo shoots and the Thizz-sorts
Ridin' and grindin' on you niggas that take snizz-norts
I'm in love how you ain't in love with the club
Or ain't in love with the above; you in love with a thug
I didn't change then, and a nigga can't change now
The reason I love you to death, girl you stay down

Matt Blaque (Chorus)

Keak Da Sneak (Verse):
It's you baby, I guess its true what they when you in love, it's crazy
I'm glad I got the chance to know you and me being myself I got the chance to show you
You should've left a long time ago, but you didn't cuz you love me, but I love you more
Open my eyes to see that the old girls know
Life is too short, I'll give myself, forget the boys and the doe
Came along way, made along time long; fightin', fussin', touchin; man I made you stronger
Two wrongs don't make a right; they make a wrong-wrong
God tell me what you need, is there someway I can change this wrong

Matt Blaque (Chorus)
Matt Blaque (Outtro):
I love the way, the way you mooooove
Ooooooo, I know where and when ooo youuuuu[Are you ready?]

[San Quinn]
Give me a minute to get in it
Give me a minute with one of your main bitches
Mental fitness I demonstrate
Right in front of your eyes
Watch your bitch elevate from a five to a nine
Confidence booster all in her mind
And I'm checkin' every dollar and dime
[Come with me]
To the city where my committee chase titties and ass
[Are you ready? Come with me]
I'll show you where the check break fast
And we bust heads fast
If a nigga not in single file
Run up on him single style
Let the thing break him down
You love my methods
Take a nigga off the Earth if he on my shit list reckless
The key copper
Have to eat proper
Bitches lookin' for guidance
Had to be proper
Tone Capone is the beat dropper
The jump off is jumpin' off proper
And it's about to get hotter

Chorus: Keak Da Sneak
[Come with me]
Til it pop off
And you better be ready for the jump off
[Come with me]
Til it pop off
And you better be ready for the jump off
[Come with me]
Til it pop off
And you better be ready for the jump off
[Come with me]

[Keak Da Sneak]
I still rep Walnut Street in deep East Oakland
The 100 block where you can your whole shit broken
Like Mystikal "Still Smokin"
The life ??
And rent free
I never let nothin' live on my mind
I gotta grind [grind], shine
And fight for my grandma
And don't do nothin' stupid like Hammer
Til I go bankrupt
Steady drinkin' til I finish my cup
Then bust ya head before I shoot up the gut
Fresh outta Folsom and proper beef injections
Chosen selections
Cuz girl I ain't fuckin' without protection
I'm harder than erection
Teachers so you study your lessons
And advise for that viewer discretion
On a scale to 1 to 10 I get 11
Give a toast to the pussy like Devin
And beat it up off Sprite and Seagram 7
I've plottin' on a way to get rich
And keep bread out that cock
And all the folks in the hood aimin' for head
Shots of lead poppin'
Situation's crucial
And every nigga I'm wit is feelin' neutral
Fuck takin' 10 paces
And drawin' down
This ain't no Western movie
Roll a Swisher, pass it to Ric
Sat the window wit the doobie
I'm lookin' at booty
Onion ass on the strip
You fine but baby girl where your whip
It's jumpin' off

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
While I'm outtie on the West
I got the best weed
And the best hoes
I'm on the block at all times dressed in the best clothes
My focus is money cuz pussy come natural
I only fuck wit those that can show me some collateral
I deal 'em all off top
I ain't a child molester or a killer
I don't need y'all props
Shit, if she wit me, she know what it is
We hotellin' and you don't deserve to go to the crib
If yo potna wanna roll she can roll
I ain't gotta touch
I like to smoke and watch you freaky hoes
And I could have my choice
Enie, meenie, miney, mo
Bust a nut, get the fuck
Play it how it go
My main ho called and told me she made some money
I said "Bitch you ain't never come gave it to me!"
How many woman now done wanna get gangsta for me
Gotta be willin' to get down on your hands and stomach
[Are you ready?]

[Chorus](feat. E-40)

[Keak Da Sneak]
My family roll thick like syrup and milkshakes
Transporting weight from the south to the golden state
Swingin' figure 8's, burnin rubber its hypo
In the middle of the intersection, tryin to start up a side-show
My mind go in other places cats dont speak on
Da Raw and uncut, for you niggas to tweak on
I flip on suckas as they come out rappin
So imagine whats gon' happen when I catch you in traffic
Who sell the most records in the bay(You?)
Indepentent label(You?) No video and radio play? (You?)
Its been 86 murders since the start of 2002
When niggas bang turfs for the work
Not that red and blue, and every single block is a street
When niggas hold it down cause you know we gotta eat
They call me Keak Sneak, but my real name is Kunta-Kentay B-O-W-E-N

[Chorus: x2]
My nigga told me dont be scared, cause I'ma run the streets
Just like t-shirt, blue jeans, and Nikes
Coke white t-shirt, blue jeans, and Nikes
Stay strapped with the 45, I wish a nigga would try

[E-40]
Style so unique and Exquisite
Gift-ta-Gabbit, I spit it
I'm off this Gungie my ninja
I'm so damn twisted from smokin so much turtle I'm spliffed
Went to court the other day
So I wassa perkin early in the mornin, yawnin off
This HIGH SPEED CHASE SHIT! Damn near caught a case wit it
Hit the gas, Skeet Skirt, drivin fast, Skeet Skirt
In the slow lane, seein stars, goin against the grain
Slappin this shit, THAT'll FUCK WIT YA BRAIN BOY!
This is ya brain on thug(on thug) mode I suppose
Plenty hoes, Panty hose, 5 times sittin on vogues
24 inch toes, robbers, lookin out for the hella-kizz-noppers
We ain't proper, I'm off the main
I represent heavy on the grizz 9, Intergame (Intergame)

[Chorus]
[Keak Da Sneak]
I'm in the dope-fiend rental, tryin to paint the town
Four speed honda civic and I'm breakin it down (Breakin it down)
One head light plus I'm ridin spare
Thermometer say a hundred, I'm takin him there
It was me and Bra Heff, Ridin and smokin
Side of the Oakland, livin it up, cause the 8 frame broken
Coke white t-shirt, blue jeans, and Air Max
Came up Highstreet, stopped on Fairfax
Hit the liquor store, gotta get me a Remy
Copped some light from Lil' O, forgot the tank on empty
So I hit E-1-4 gimmie 10 on fo'
A box of Philly titans, and a short box of dem 'Ports
More for me, if a nigga dont smoke
And I knock the baddest hoes when I ain't on hundred spokes
Gimme head, lemme poke, I know her nigga, but she ain't feelin him

[Chorus][Hook: Agerman]
Ridin in a big body benz, Countin my ends, Hollerin revenge
They wanna see me lose but watch me win
I'm surrounded by the f.e.d.'s, They know about every block I been
Oh shit, They tryin to do me in
Reppin and rattin me out, Gon get it to the neck wit the syringe
Nina ross my girlfriend, She's my only friend
I pop my clip off in her as soon as I got out the pen

[Verse 1: Agerman]
First of all, Ain't got no time for these bustas, Smilin all in my face
Niggas like bitches be fake, From head to toe laced up wit hate
Nigga, I'm a playa, Rydas, Fake niggas be scary lies
Runnin tired, Got me strapped up, And it's on to open fire
You got killas, We got killas, Playin the game of cash
Too many softee's tryin to cross me, But now I'm up in yo ass
See, Mama raised me to be a leader, So motherfucker follow me
What if all go down, We ridin deep, Whether I get you or you get me
Fear no man but God, So if it's on it's on
Cowards could come and get ya, But we gon get ya later on
I'm about me and mine, Fuck the snitches, Fuck the bitches
Keepin .9 when we ride, Cause we on a mission for riches
Nigga field is laced up by realist killas and deala's
Give a fuck about ya feelings cause nigga, It's strictly business
Nigga what? Back up off me you softee
I'm a cold piece of work like Khadafi when you bitch niggas try to cross me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Keak Da Sneak]
You runnin, Now you see that I'm comin before you blasted
When shit drastic, I want more than just ya ass kicked
I'm waitin, Under ya car, Because ya crossed me
When ya come out flossy, I hope ya next ain't loss me
Boom boom, Put em in the car and drove up
Boom boom, Left em in the trunk wit his clothes off
It's that quick, When ya pahtna outta licks, I move fast
Get to dumpin the cash, And leave no evidence, Who ask?
But I make ya bleed when I'm bustin
Run up, Ya think I'm bluffin?
Thinkin you gon get somethin in the 97 I'm bumpin
Biatch, I'm throat cuttin it, Junkin it, Draggin it
Thinkin my shit ain't havin it strapped wit d.e. auto magnets
I ain't done taggin it, Not off in a ragnet
Still click cluck baggin it
Ain't stuckin my cash on a bitch, My future, Gotta be havin it
This is my opportunity, I'm snatchin erythang when I grab this shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Agerman]
Uh, Relax yo mind, Look up at the barrel of my fuckin .9
Caught one to the face, Caught one to the back, Carried out in a lac for fuckin wit mine
You droppin dimes, Hey, Ain't no snitches around my way
Just niggas on the block wit a bundle of rocks
Wit Glocks, That's cocked and ready to pop, The block is hot
Ring on the spot, Cops on my block, They tryin to fade me out
Feds surrounded the house, 5 seconds to come out
Now tell me what the fuck I'm 'sposed to do
Plus my d, Down my brew, Hit the cig, Take a ooh
Fuck a boy in blue, Ooh, Thinkin of now, Headed for the back, Inside of the back do'
Through the backyard, Full of pits, Fuckin wit the mind of a lunatic
[I had to do her] Smooth get away from the boys in blue
And you'se a fool, They gon let them boys get you
Nigga, We ridin

[Hook] 2x[Intro:]
For me
Whomp, whomp, whomp (x8)
Oooh weee

[Verse 1::]
Skit, dit, roll the script
Chuck, smoke, down ya throat
Bounce, hop, drop the top
Been a few counts turn up the knots
Scroll through the spot with every dope dealin
We used to breakin windows like porcelain
Whomp, whomp, whomp ooh wee
Playas in the traffic off  juice or gin
Tryna money mac up on some scrillion
I don’t have to have a lot scrill ya
For me to turn that sipp into a million
If i can turn that sipp into a million
Just think what I can do with a kiss

[Chorus:]
Say you want say you ride with me
Whomp, whomp, whomp
Say you want live like luxury
Whomp, whomp, whomp
Diamond rings, fancy things
Things ain't always really as it seems
Whomp, whomp, whomp
For me
Whomp, whomp, whomp

[Verse 2:]
Well, deal, ride the steps
Operations that broke and you hold some steps
You side ways like there ain't no tomorrow
Don’t beg or borrow you take this and separate us no need the fakeness
Lens so i smack it make you feel like earthquakeless
Gotta hold back no intentions to say shit
None of this should be played high volume residentials
No amps but the police ain't trippin they all went to the scraps man
That’s what happens when i gets the paypa
National geographic, wildlife, the jungle
Growl with it thrust big and husky
Trust me I ain't the quarterback so don’t rush me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You didn’t want me when i was leaking
I see you peakin but baby you ain't speakin
Just met me reapin the other day on the dance floor
At the club with liquor comin all out of my pores
To my thug this a thing a magig all day
At the bar drinkin hennessy shots and grandma yeah
I gotta tell ya the beautifuls the ankle play
Had you callin your uncle earl on ya birthday
Drunk drivin i’m telegraphed in bird play
Wakin up in the holder cell the next day
Not remembering me can’t even think that far
They must have caught me in public
Pissin on my car with the knock goin

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro:]
Whomp, whomp, whomp
Say you wanna
