[Hook 1: Kanye West sample] x2
It’s what ya all been waitin for
It’s what ya all been waitin for
It’s what ya all been waitin for, ain’t it?
What people payin paper for?

[Hook 2: French Montana] x2
Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
Murder was the case that they gave me

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Getting shot up, then he got up
Came back then he lit the spot up
Homie hit the chart up
Moroccan boy, you sloppy boy
3 chains on, I be Rocky boy
Packs out the lobby boy
Nigga you can read on, East Tremont
Franks, got my feet on
With money I can lean on
Canary chain cold but still keep the heat on
Your bitch with the raccoon vest, Peter Pete on
Catch me at the game, hard wood where my feet on
Lookin for an actress on my wood I could skeet on
Mansion on the other hand, live from the mother land
2 straps on, east side where you rumbling

[Hook 2] x2

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Alfred Hitchcock, two fear fist fight
Caught a nigga slippin for his chain and his wrist watch
Murder was the case that they gave me,
I can’t believe my boo bout to have my baby
Fuck, you outta luck, Mercedes truck
Pull up, distance, shoot better than Miller
Ducking from the narcs, Elsmere Crotona park
Out of control, now a nigga gon' control the market
Shoot outs and move out, ask the brick layers
Now I'm floor seats, talkin to the bench players
Tell Mike Bibby, it’s my city
Leave the game, hit green house, me and Diddy

[Hook 2] x4

[Hook][Intro - Cam'Ron]
Uh Dipset! 'Fore I set it off
O.K. First off, you a bitch nigga
Only reason I'm doing this
I'mma just name 5 reasons real quick, got a hundred fifty
First - you stole Rocafella from Dame
Second - you stole Kanye from Dame
Third - you stole Rocawear from Dame
Fourth - I seen the nigga throw that diamond up before them shots was fired
Fifth - hold on, turn the beat off
I had to turn the beat off for this
You talking bout you a 80's baby
You 37 years old, you was born in 1968 and I open the Daily News
How's the king of New York rocking sandals with jeans?
Open toe sandals with chancletas with jeans on
How's the king of New York rocking sandals with jeans and he 42 years old?

[Verse 1 - Cam'Ron]
Backup, this one ain't the only one with big wallets
Got it, my shits brollic, dot it
But your publishing should go to Ms. Wallace
Honest. Stealing Big shit, he made 2 albums, you wilding
And you can't dress, dog -- who's styling?
It was Roc-a-Wear when Dame had it
Now you got it, call it Cock-a-wear, heh not in here
Dead it pronto, you won't see a car. No
Dame and Big bitch for years, now you on ho
He own the 40/40 got you in Atlantic City
Pitch your budget outta Baseline, goddamn it's pretty
You love a Harlem nigga, we get it cooking it's true
But now I look we got more dudes in Brooklyn then you
Apparently, right? Down in Jeezy video
I should've kissed you on the cheek, you a pretty ho
And Jaz video you starred in it: Peter Pan
I was hopping off the Greyhound: Peter Pan
How could he be the man? Ha only reason fam
I don't suck dick or kiss ass and I'm consided, damn
But we hawk yo, right where you walk bro
You can fool the rest of the world long as New York know
We put you under ground clown, they gon check the cellars
I know he 40 years old, I don't respect my elders
I respect the hustlers, plus the grinders and the sellers
You's a customer buster, here go jet propellers

[Hook - Max B]
You got to hate us the way we getting this paper
All my niggas are coming straight from minimum wage
Niggas dick-riding the Dip steady trying to play us
But you get sprayed, bust a round we got in his face
Dipset - hitting 40 and niggas we toting guns
Dipset - this is forty an nigga we from the slum
Dipset - pushing 40 nigga you not the one
It's killer season, holla at a nigga cause here it come

[Verse 2 - Cam'Ron]
Killa! Let's go
Who can fuck with me? No mammal, but we tote handles
At your open toe sandals, and you look like Joe Camel
Off of Rocafella, right? no contact
But bust this fly joint they put inside the contract
I left the label right, lot of cats wonder how
Every time I diss that label I get fined a hundred-thou
Just for telling y'all I get fined a hundred-thou
Heh them cats are ill, 5 times a half a mil
Wars to play, like a bumper sticker smack a grill
Paul Wall cap a grill but them cats are daffy dills
East coast west coast slang yo cap ya bill
Down in Houston ask B I'm a mack for real
Hackie tell me, respect, better dwell me
Beyonce fiancee, check my 2nd LP
I might bring it back, that's your girl, that's your world
Had the thing, fucking singing bout slinging crack
Mr. Rocafella stop, stop, stop it fella
Still got our acapellas, but I will Akinyele-ya

[Hook]

Put it in ya mouth uh put it in ya mouth
Put it in ya mouth uh put it in ya mouth

[Verse 3 - Cam'Ron]
It ain't my fault I'm raw
I'm sorry B but I want a war
And he stabbed Un over Charli Baltimore
Sucker for love, hmm-hmm sucker for love
Kill a bitch, go to trial -- hand be stuffed in the glove
I'mma hop in the bed, dog gon' just pop off her head
Tell O.J.-
Z chill, Cochran is dead

[Hook]

[Outro - Cam'Ron]
Y'all niggas don't want it with us man

Acting like you got something over there

Let it out man, get ready for 15 rounds man
And all I did was battle once
Everybody getting ready to step to the plate
And I'mma step up again and slam, grand-slam yo ass pardon me
Dipset! I know you, I know you like that

Chipped in for the GS, you Jaz-O's son
Where's Sauce Money at? Where's the like, where they at?

Round one, let the games begin doggy
Haha ain't laughing at ya ugly ass no more

Because before you it was the bunny, she want me
Told me pull it out and dont even come in (OWWW)

[Hook]
I came (Oh shit, baby my bad)

Stop playin' (Before I even gave you some ass you shoulda told me dat u was gonna cum)
You came (Baby I didn't mean to do it)

Stop playin' (Before I even gave you my pussy you shoulda told me dat you was gonna cum)

Is he the reason that my phone couldn't bleep through
I heard he treat you bad, heard he beat you
Bring that pussy home like ya used to do
Still on my grind I'm gettin money
Light the sour up so I can get a buzz
Is he the reason that my phone couldn't bleep through
I heard he treat you bad, heard he beat you
Bring that pussy home like ya used to do
Still on my grind I'm gettin money
Light the sour up so I can get a buzz

[Verse 2]

Listen baby girl I used to say to her

Hug me, choose me, smiley face
Mix the grand creezy with a smoothie

[Hook][Intro]

[Verse 1: Max B]
Ain't nothing like a ride or die bitch
She come through and throw the fifty up
Love to fuck she even roll the piffy up
Who that in the swiffy truck
Son with the blicky tucked
Federally tried to hit me up
But, my bitch she nice behind the wheel

One thing a nigga could say is that the heists' they be real
She gonna shoot a nigga dead like she licensed to kill
She always tell her friends bout me, the pipping is real
Let me control the tempo baby cause I'm nice with the peel (chill)
I want you on your belly quick
Max is the good side, I'm on my biggavelli shit
Riding to the party, her thighs touching the shotty
My eyes touching her body, got her high off bacardi (ayy)
Bitch had the nerve to take a piss in the lobby
Now she talking bout catching a body (wtf baby)

[Hook: x2]
Cause I want you

And I need you

Never would she crack under pressure or would she fold
She ain't with that bullshit my baby girl she bold
Say a prayer for you, give you long kisses goodnight then fill u with some holes
Riding in the rolls, cruising in the third lane
This my first time around I'm doing it for byrd gang

Got black girls, puertorican, even got them chinese
Ecuadorian, white, even got them guyanese
Ya'll know how to find me, lenox ave 7th ave
Say wassup to my mother, I never had a better dad
Say wassup to my brother and love to the women
That's holding my nigga down while he sitting in prison
You don't know how a nigga living
Let's not talk about the past let's just forget it (let's just forget it, bang bang)

[Hook: x2]
Cause I want you

[Verse 1: Max B]
Quarter mil in that Louis bag, shorty wanna do me bad
Get a bitch her do, he pull up in sixes boo
Double up on that hefty bag, I'm the best dick she had
In a long while, momma say all my songs foul
Momma say all my songs sound provacative

I'm gon' spark again, pour me cups of Cru, get me nice and right
Pussy, like it nice and tight, cookies, like 'em nice and light
Fluffy like them biscuits that my momma, when she pulled 'em out the oven
Smelled 'em in the air, bullets fly from everywhere
Bet
He pull out a heavy gear, every year
I was sittin' in the penitentiary, look at what was sent to me
Letters from these bitches sayin' "Bigga you gon' have to go back in for conspiracy"
One thing wasn't clear to me
Cared to be, how can you niggas prepare to be something you can't see, smell or touch or taste
'09 ma let's up the stakes

[Hook: Max B]
I got a beautiful thang, mami I'm just tryna change

And a nice freaky girl, and a nice freaky girl
And I'm not tryna go ho-whoa-ome

[Verse 2: Max B]
Now dippin' on that lean, got a half a bird
Drivin' up the interstate, dinnerplate in my car
Gots to break it down and bag it up, right before I hit the strip
Gotta move low when I tote that 5th, got a new flow wit' a gold 4-5th
Rope that bitch, make her tell me more, basement under the deli store
I'm rarely hard?, better call the Champ Bailey dog
Pop up on the scene, it's like that nigga on a mission for some cream, reincarnate
Every weekend my mom stay
Every weekend she go to church, knows the earth
Take it from your wiz, man I know it hurts, when them stones is on the dirt
When them chromes is on alert, nigga you better talk like a G
Nigga don't be tryna fuck with me

[Hook]

[Bridge]

Now that you got it, nigga ride it out, better do ya thang
Sick chain when you look at here, lookin' clear
Feds try take friends of mine, hands of mine
Niggas skiing to that finishline
Powder every hour, every minute, while you in it
Get your money, get up out it, ain't no love in the business
Keep your niggas close, circles small
Homie it's luv at the top, but it hurt when ya fall, most of all
Look homie, if ya ask me, Montana, Max B

Take a look at his mean chain, they dragging on the internet
Ain’t kill a nigga yet, he smoking weed & cigarettes
Stuck with seeds and niggas pet. We get seed out the set
I’ll have him weaving out his 'jects, or wherever the nigga rep
Wherever the nigga step-
Foot like a landfill, one click of the metal give your man chills
Stop living for fan thrills, or see how your fans feel
When Gay R body hard. They telling your man chill
He giving your man peels, its off with your mans grill
Niggas with ram kills, give a fuck how your man feel
Ya niggas in your fan peel, keep testing the fam we’ll..
Power smoking sour, you’l be dead a couple hours
Or crime scene investigators come sprinkling they’re powders
Niggas loving the dour come fuck with this thing of ours


(Hook) 2x

[Verse 3: Max B]
Fresh up out that gate, I can penetrate-
Send one through that dome of yours
While your home watching the Source Awards
Fuckers got me pissed, thought she was a fan
Bigging up my new PD3, Screaming nigga give me a CD free
Bobbing off my shit, you and your main bitch
Tripping off Sexy Love, empty slug
(?) He is such a work of art
He is known to squirt the dart. Work the charts
Help these bitches get cake. See niggas don’t appreciate
What I do for the game, fuck the politics
Coca got a lot of it. Poke it out and polish it
Tell them bitches swallow it-
Gurgle it, Mustard on his murder shit
Average in 2010 on some burger shit
Used him for all purposes, used him for all services
Wipe you niggas down. Look at mama bet she proud of me
Cluttered like the lot of me, flooded like the lottery
We need power boy, Dour called
Tell me max I got that Sour on, Oww Oww

Them bitches see my bars, they get in the loop
Hit the coupe and cop cars, got the droptop Bentley
Niggas love the way the bars flow

Cruising on 6, you’ll come
Let me take on a detour, G4
Nah baby, you flyin on jet blue bigger
Actin up in the black shoot, I can get you anything you want
Back rub the boss so it’s bigger and fresher to get mo bucks out

[Hook: Daft Punk/Max B]
Been around the world, now ya ya

Nigga please, I’m the macaroni with the cheese

[Hook:Daft Punk/Max B]

[Verse 3:Max B]

And when my dope low, when this shit slow froze
But the big 4-4 and slip her the coco
Oh no, boys don’t got em on me

Vigilante season edition

So wavy babySee we all medicate our pains some ways (Liquor, Booze, Drugs)
This is what we do
Let’s go, yeah

[Hook]
I'm 'bout to blow me a dub
I need a swig of Grand Cru to take the pain away
The sour serenades my soul
(You better show me some love)
We sell seven bricks of caine a day
What's the matter with y'all hoes
(This for my homies and thugs)
I'mma pour a lil' liquor on the curb for my homies, see ya at the crossroads
(You niggas better show me some love)
Show me some love

Verse 1:
Niggas tried they best to hurt me, come and catch the birdie
I'm Tom Brady, you a Testeverde
Yeah, old, washed-up with no arm strength
He don't show no remorse, he ain't got a conscience
He ain't got the don sense to be the boss
Who that nigga they talkin' 'bout, that he need the cost
Biggavel', bet I prove 'em wrong again just like the last wave
I only get the money, hit the honeys that be nasty
Blast me, caught 'em off the lean, took his breath away
The ratchay, tore him off his jeans, took his vest away
Spend 50, put the rest away, tuck my metal hold
750 for a rainy day, cuz you'll never know
Know he got that better blow, Ds tried to crept strong
The Ds'll still a 9 even when stepped on
The sourman, throw me dub, the powderman, show me love
95 off a high-speed drive

[Hook]

Nigga better show me some love man
All this wave I bring to the game
Y'all niggas better show Biggavel' that love man
Might have to go back in, ya know
Might have to go do that 30, ya know
Fuck it, ya know
I'mma leave you niggas that wave though
Boss Don Biggavel', Byrd gang
Gotta love it, yeah
Public Domain 2 shit for you niggas baby
So wavy
Shouts to my boy Midel Barrio
Got the smiley faces back in the building
Nigga Al Pac, what's good baby, we Gain Greene
Ron Gida, Mike Bruno, ya know
It is what it is

[Hook]Yo, it definitely is a concrete jungle
And yet, there's more to life than misery
We have to have unity in our community
We have to work together brothers and sisters (I'm from the ghetto)
Yeah this is Dr. Ben, I'm with Jim Jones (Lord knows, I was on the run confused)
DipSet forever (shit)
We're talking about a concrete jungle (yeah it sure is a jungle)
Life or Death, you have to choose life (I done seen it all, at least I think I seen it all)

[Verse 1]
I'm with my concrete jungle, no Tarzans and Janes (no swinging from vines)
Diesel by the bundles, and the hard grams of 'caine (we on our grind)
D's when they come through; it's hard to get some change
Smoking weed getting drunk, in the car for a flame (slow down nigga)
Yeah I see the traffic, but we dipping on the shoulder (break laws)
Winter start to set in, it's only getting colder (dress warm)
And I miss you all my political soldiers
Most are doing life for moving bricks or doing hold-ups
Damn I know we caught up in the fast life
Some life a fiend when they caught up on the glass pipe (we pookie out here)
Me, I'm still caught up from last night
Same clothes from the club, on the block getting cash right (I'm on my G though)
Damn, you know this world full of misery (pray for me)
Some get tore up 'til they hurl off the liquor B (gettin twisted)
Somebody told me that the girls need the chivalry (fuck a bitch)
That's why I cop ice 'til they ass get the shivers B

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto (ain't nothing sweet about it)
Been there, done that, running in the streets (running wild)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride
I'm trying to make the most of my hustler (I gotta hustle)
Been there, done that, so I can live out all my dreams (live out my dreams)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

[Verse 2]
For the coke I would sleep hard
But the game drove me nuts, in the streets, I'm a full-fledged retard
Was the city block overseer
Man your life is Chuck E. Cheese, mine is a pizzeria
How many pies I done flipped?
I lost count
How many guys I done gave shit?
I lost count
Holding, but I can't ignore cheating
Any day your life could be the hot topic at that board meeting
They discussing who'll stretch you for your trees
For your thievery, you living, you breathing for no fucking reason
That's how it is when you make a man
That's why your man's gotta learn to make himself
Then you shake his hand
Man, I'm into catching heavy clams
And when Dezzy cans when it comes to dumping I got heavy hands
Ain't gonna be right for your picking jet
This is ours, the square is where we eat, this our kitchenette

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I let my temper hit the floor
I be staring through the mirror as I serenade my halls
I'm fond of the juices that marinate they drawers
My shorty, she bank a carrot with the four, cause
If you take us out, the streets will evolve
Some niggas they live to eat, some niggas eat to survive
And my conscience keep disturbing me, fucking with my energy
Niggas that I thought was friends, really the enemy
Dear Lord please grant me the serenity
To accept the things that I cannot change
Locked up for eight years and ain't join no gangs
Been converted to true nigga, I'm as real as they come
And any moment I have you staring the barrel of my gun
Put my dick up in the streets, but I'm married to the slums
Put the chips up in the ante and tally up the sum
I'm having fun, hitting the fiends in the allies with some jums

[Chorus]

Alright, yeah but in choosing life, you got choices (oh yeah)
The jungle is full of everything
It's the mother and the father of creation (ain't nothing sweet about it)
But listen up, you have to choose something for yourself
Do something for yourself, make something of yourself
That's what time it is (don't let go)
Go strong, be strong, stand for something in life (all my young soldiers)
Yeah, concrete jungle
I can feel it, I can smell it (sometimes it gets hard)
Jim Jones is spitting truth, the power (don't let 'em pull your car over)
Now and forever more
Making life the way it should be

Ain't nothing sweet about it
Make me want to scream and shout it
But I know I got to hold on, and just roll on[Max B]
I gotta see how that thing sound but I got it
I'ma come right in wit it Dipset, uh

[Chorus: repeat 2x]
If theres a need to confront ya babe
I'll let the nina come punch ya babe (DIPSET!!)
Fur beavers big blunts and things
Byrd Gang Byrd Gang (OW!)

[Verse 1: Max B]
Nigga I'll leave you bleedin on ya door slot
Max B look like Derek Jeter on the short stop (uh)
I'll put the heater to ya soft spot
Waive the nina and make ya adiddas do the short stop (uh)
You don't want it wit me b
Dickie under the snorkel heat and the mean v
Bend ya main bitches over give'em the wee wee
Big gun up close in ya face 3-D (uh)
I'll put the thing near ya ear Let it bang near ya ear
Fivic grand crew haters linger in the air
Clothes fit right like the finger in ya beer
Last week hit anger in the rear
Jim came threw he gave me the chain and couple of 'guettes in my ear
Now the bird swingin off the thermo
Tre pound tucked bitch I don't give a fuck bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Shit I treats this game like it's 88
Nauti' sweats no socks hopped out the range wit the paper plates
Hopped on the plane wit the bathing apes
Hopped off the plane ta see the hatian face so pound nigga (sa pa say!)
We gangsta rappin gettin dough from this violence (east side!)
I'm talkin G4's blowin haze smoke from the piolet (purple!)
I chartered that flight cause it was lookin kinda rainy
Now i'm known ta bring the goons out like that nigga John Chaney (Goonies!)
Or catch me up on the hill in the whip doing 80 (Dimelo!)
Till the police pulled me over and the whip smelled all hazy
What you know about that cash get you thrown up in the trash
I'll put a gun up in ya mouth and have you blow it out yo ass
Blunt up in my mouth blowin out the grass
Show you how to stunt, pockets loaded wit the cash
Show you how to dump semi loaded ready ta blast
I'll roll up on you chumps I got this whole shit in a smash

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Cardan]
Yo Now when I'm crusin threw harlem I get my bunky charn on
Gotta dunny dunk broad wit a dunky dunk car
I get all that chronic straight from them honky tonk guys
You junior muthafuckas I'm donkey don kong
I just left Jacob and he got me chunky on arm
Now I'm on my way to go smoke a dunky don bong
I brought DA BAND out and I ain't talkin puffy sean combs
Dem drums turn into guns goin brrrrump ba bump bump
Now ya mind out ya body
You wonder I got nine in the party I was high in it prolly
Doggy, I put the kam in the kazi you need it pa
Holla I might go guide you, poppy its the guy
Call me cardan tho
Been passed dem,  bust, if, ain't
We ain't wit the village fags nah we on lennox ave
You mad, go get ya dad you fag, you fit for drag
And that nina'll bump you, or if it's a need I confront you fucker

[Chorus] - 2XI'm the nigga that can't stay low
I got coke in Costa Rica and San Pedro
Keep the blunt lit, fifth in the hidden compartment
Keep sluts livin'up in all my apartments
Your money getting long, don't lie to me
You niggas is trash rap
It's not the quantity, it's the quality
We 6 albums strong on this disc drive
She went through a hella lot
I'm getting soul wishing this bitch died
You see my life's like a movie
If I wasn't the fella not to license my toolie
Max in the mood for sushi
The boy hittin them chinese
We stick together like siamese
Been tryna get ridda this devil that's inside me
Ya don't wanna live, B, they just wanna stress to come find me
The white man with the gun and vest behind me
He yella freeze and he screaming about firing
I'm retiring, gain greene bosses
You looking for a job, we hiring
Why you lie to them? That's what you said man
Sorry for you cocksucker, you's a dead man

HOOK:
Them boys got tools, them boys got jewels
Got trucks with armor
Pussy climb on the boy, you really want me for?

[Verse 1 Max B:]
After two fifths of Cru, I had the plan made
Nigga got his food ate, patched it up wit' a band-aid
Max mayonaisse, macaroni cheese, and mustard
Your bitches look busted
Shit got me disgusted, clusters droop off the left wrist
I think I got a death wish
Sittin' back, suicide your thoughts of doin' it
Hittin' the switch, all my niggas could move a brick
I can move the shit on a slow day, no play, okay
I be speakin' to my bitch Oshay
And as we roll on, hold on to ya love
Mami fiendin', she want more drugs
Shaking and she goin' through withdrawls
Big pitfalls, I'm 'bout to be the shit dog
Can a nigga stop what I'm bringin', singin'
Soundin' all good
I'm going all around the hood, it's Max B

[Verse 2 French Montana:]
Get high till we can't see
Your rap career over, look for plan B

Every nigga near me, got a gun just as big as Camby
That's Marcus, and open coffins
Bootleg cable, and bitch
You get what you bring to the table
I got shrimp and spaghetti, and Prego sauce
Yeah my boy polished, homie ding those off
And I hear him knockin', it's the Wavie Crockett
With more hoes from River Road
And more O's, and plenty rolled
From food stamps to big checks
And I'll smack a bitch wit' a 100 stacks off a reflex
That's a jackpot, 650 with the ragtop
And Pillsbury for a mascot

Kick a nigga in the head, football punt a nigga
Then stab a nigga quick like a London nigga
Your career is a blender nigga, mine is promised
I wear a 9 in the snakeskin Pradas
Wit' a 9 in a chick that's chasin' dollars

SO DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME, DON'T FORGET ABOUT MEEEE....
I KNOW I KNOOOOOOW

[Verse One]
Now due to me (JONES!)
Me and my truancy (NINE TREY!)
Running through the streets since early puberty! (YOUNG NIGGAZ!)
What influenced me (let em know)....it was the jewelry
Tryna get cash so I can do it like the older G's (BALLIIIING!)
The 80's...big thick rope chains
Life was all crazy getting rich off cocaine (TRUE STORY NIGGA)
...so I been caught up dog, nothing like Usher (no).....
More like a hustler (yep)
All night with customers, tryna get my paper up (right)
Jealousy, envy....gotta watch, they'll spray you up
But it was something bout the gun play....
Rolling dice on blocks, double parked up on a one way (TRIPS NIGGA!)
And breaking law was the norm' (yep), the club break about 4 in the morn'd
So we parking lot pimp, hit the diner for some grub
The squad type thick you know I'm rolling with the thugs

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Now as I roll up my window (R-Class), blaze up the indo (that purple!)....
Get tore down for my homies in the pen (miss you Zeke)
I'm ma take you the Cali with me (WESTSIDE!)....
Know ya dress code, heavy sag on ya Dickies (B'S & C'S!)
You catch me out in Houston, and usually we can slow it up (slow motiooon)
And get screwed, get a deuce and we can throw it up!
ATL sharp, if you balling and you make it rain (BALLIIIING!)
"I'm in love with a stripper", alcohol on ya brain
Fast track life, the shit is uncanny (I LOVE IT)
When it come to birds fly south to Miami (OPIUM!)
Weather like 80 (sunny), drop-top Mercedes (BALLIN)
"Sai Pa Say", on the block in Little Haiti
Chicago is the Bulls, the Bears, and the gangsters (you hear that?)
2 12'N with the OG's, tryna get the answers
And all these O. T trips got me tired
Drive the wheels til they fall off
And I just bought some new tires

[Hook]Chorus:
I gave you everything
(I said I gave you everything)
Somehow it just wasn't enough
(It just wasn't enough)
Why don't you trust me
(Why don't you trust me)
Light the sour up and give me a Puff

Verse 1:
Hey baby, somehow you seem addicted to my style in jail
I always was the first to trial
Always was a versatile, talented, handsome individual
Comin' up, so look at me, it's pitiful
Pity me, never that, nigga keep ya head for a later day
Just bow ya head and say a prayer
Speak to Jesus please till he answer, I never been a dancer
Fucked chicks, Geminis, Cancers, got the answer
Got the recipe, they tryna take the little what was left of me
Folded my destiny, hysterectomy
Baby love, you's a seamstress, daddy coming home
Really baby, I mean this
Seen shit, nuttin' ain't phase me, nuttin' ain't graze me
You fuckers supposed to pay me
Gimme my paper, niggas is overdue with residuals
Baby my work is visual
Here we go

Chorus:
I gave you everything
(I said I gave you everything)
Somehow it just wasn't enough
(It just wasn't enough)
Why don't you trust me
(Why don't you trust me)
Light the sour up and give me a Puff

Verse 2:
You see it, the way I came and took over the game
It was rare, you ain't see 'em like me in years
Keep me in the clear from the bullshit, full clip
Keep 'em on the curb, you might've seen him in the burbs
Beverly boutiques, mami she got cute feet (Oww)
At night I pop her coochy
I don't waste time, I'm so cold with the bitches
Give 'em the dick in many different positions
Wishin', one day I'll be a changed man, fuck it though
That'll fuck up my gameplan, main man
Fuck with a nigga hard, tellin' me "Bigga do it right"
I'll make it the night of your life
Take ya out at nights in the beamer, cleaner
Get it detailed, 90 thou was the retail
Peach Street, mean tail, if only Bigga beat bail, eeh, well
Scarlett, roll up a mean L, please

Chorus:
I gave you everything
(I said I gave you everything)
Somehow it just wasn't enough
(It just wasn't enough)
Why don't you trust me
(Why don't you trust me)
Light the sour up and give me a Puff

Verse 3:
We good, this shit here is a classic
Almost gone, the devil workin' his magic, tragic
Tryna leave me in the wrong direct, me with no protection
Leavin' me infested, restless
Breakfast, them bitches cook for me every morning
I dick 'em and don't call 'em, ballin'
Spend a lil' paper, hit the mall and daddy, he clean
I'm never screamin' all-in
I'mma call him and let him know where to meet me
Bigga he cru, you's a bottle of Fiji
Up north, your nickname was Cici, that was real gay
Quarantine dropped, had a field day
Had a chill day, there was a cook-out
OFO, Gain Greene comin' baby, you better look out, look out
Give me 30 years, throw the book out, picture that shit
Bigga goin' out like a bitch, naw

Chorus:
I gave you everything
(I said I gave you everything)
Somehow it just wasn't enough
(It just wasn't enough)
Why don't you trust me
(Why don't you trust me)
Light the sour up and give me a puff[Hook]
Mama, she tryna touch the yayo
We say "Yo, what you need, we got D, we got weed, we got E”
(We got, we got)
She cop it and she love to stay high
Her money good, good, good, she smoke it time after time
So pop the top, we'll put one in ya girl
This is that bone bone bone, let's smoke a couple pieces and chill
I got these bitches looking thirst' for a blunt
This not ordinary day in the hood, this is the first of the month

[Verse 1:]
Started out as a little itty baby in this cold, cold world
His poppa had a boy and girl, stressed her momma out
Now she doin' drugs, moving through the city streets
Clean teeth, used to have them pretty feet
Now she pretty weak, from the drug use, fucking all them ballers for they cash
There's war when I got pot to pass, flew 'em in
Dolo in the crib, tryna fix something to eat
Tryna get something that's sweet so we can sleep, "Don't lay on the sheets”
Momma she be dripping blood, from the needle in and out of veins
This joint gon' bring you lots of pain, lots of rain
Staring out the window as my poppa waving bye to me
"Baby where the TV, why you lie to me"
Riding we, gunning from my robberies, treating 'em like bitches from the past
Style on 'em as I watch 'em pass
Watch that nigga dash like he in and out
Carlo, he told me, "Wrap that package up and send it out"
It's the first of the month

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
They had a nigga sitting in the county jail wondering
"What's life, I am done with' it”. Run with' it
Baby you can be a star, won't you just ask Maxi B
Look at how I'm running through they faculty. Back to back with me
Was my right hand, telling all my business in the street
Said I got it from Dyckman, lightning, piping
Hot, we got burners, and them bundles, we can furnish
Done seen niggas get murdered, I can tell you more
Pumping out the corner store, kept my little look-out in the front
My dudes just moved 'em out the trunk
"Million Dollar Baby Volume One and Two” I love it boo
Classic like that G-funk sound, I fucks with you
Biggavell, I don't think you really know, how wavy you are
You's a star. The fiends, I let 'em park my car
Dipping out the back when I see the Jakes
She need a taste. Chasin' that paper, she left a trace
It's the first of the month

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
My grandma passed, I really miss her. Couldn't go to the funeral and kiss her
In the cell I was staring at her picture
She never liked my way of life, told me I would pay the price
Riding on my foes got me gliding on these hoes
Feeling like some other type of nigga
Come and fuck with the Bigga, we can live it up
One day I'm gon' give it up
Be a family man and settle down with a wife and kid. Nigga you so trifling
Nigga don't be tryna spit that righteous shit, you ain't but a bitch
And baby I don't like that shit
Staying out late, tryna come home when you want
Tryna come and roll a blunt, tryna come and go for what
You ain't really wanna be my man, Max. Damn, Max
Baby you best to stand back. I can't stand that
Every time you get around your friends you be, starting yo shit again
On the first of the month

[Intro: Max B]
Max B, you see?
There's a lot of speculation, right
(Henny the Don: I'm G'd up!)
Twenty million in the boil of hell
B2, come on! Gang Green, getting room
(Henny the Don: Nigga, I'm G'd up!)
Now we're in the studio chillin'
(Henny the Don: I'm G'd up!)

[Verse 1: Henny the Don]
Your mommy see me leaning in the beemer
Floating of the top rope they tell me dreamer
Feeling a type comfortable, hitting these chicks
With big dicks, what we love to do you
That money, when it comes to this money
Bullets from the semi-auto running up to your tummy
I'm G'd up, tie me a nigga up, mommy eat up
And now I'm trying to fuck
I'm a professional pimp, don't stress a ho, bitch
Get you for your whole shit
I'mma get this nigga whole clips, I was in the Benz babe
I've seen poody room, I was in your crib, kid
I know where you live bitch, I'm better off
Chevy Carrera Porsche and leather cloth
It's very short, tie you up, don't shot the bullet wound
Cut you up for the cheddar cause, aw

[Hook: Henny the Don]
How many a rider, always on the grind
I'm cocking my nine, whenever it's time for crime
I'm G'd up, it's all a nigga know
I'm G'd up, getting a lot of dough
I'm Gang Green, we hold it steady rolling
Pockets is heavy and all swollen, nigga, I'm G'd up
Tie me a nigga up, mommy eat up
And now I'm trying to fuzz

[Verse 2: Henny the Don]
Don't get it confused, we can get it on
But I'm always playing it cool, and niggas know I'm a rider
Cause before the singing and rapping I was cooking them pipes up
I get it popping, I don't play no games, I'm G'd up
I'm saying no names, I'm G'd up, I slain that cane
I rep that thing and plus I bang bang

[Verse 3: Max B]
Yo, I resemble it, seven-forty-feezy
Niggas like Max how you do it so easy
Max, how you do it so freely
Chick touch, might as well join us
You niggas can't be us
Fifty on the side wearing my sneaker
Whitey, don't know if you noticed
I don't think he likes me
Tell me when he see me, come and fight me
He don't wanna do that
Ship him of to Mikey, he don't wanna move that

[Bridge: Henny the Don]
If you hustling in the streets
You all in your heat
Trying to stay low for the D's
They G'd up, stay G'd up
Throw it up if you're riding that 5
And you're busting your guns
Trying to keep your niggas alive
They G'd up, stay G'd up

[Hook 2x]
I'm Gang Green, we hold it steady rolling
Pockets is heavy and all swollen, nigga, I'm G'd up
Tie me a nigga up, mommy eat up
And now I'm trying to fuzz
How many a rider, always on the grind
I'm cocking my nine, whenever it's time for crime
I'm G'd up, it's all a nigga know
I'm G'd up, getting a lot of dough

[Outro: Max B]
Biggest B's, B2B Entertainment
Gang Green, Harlem Matriarch
We stick together baby, it's Harlem!
We back, okay... 2 G's[Hook]
Can't have our cake and eat it too
She said between me and these streets, you've got to choose
Said you know a nigga love that cru girl.(Grand Cru all day)
She said between me and these streets, you've got to choose


[Max B: Verse 1]
I be 30 thousand feet, dippin' through the sky
Double shot of hen, first class, Biggavelli fly
Gotta love him that's that nigga b
Cocky, arrogant, real niggery
Baby taste this dick, come and get with me
Bet you I can fuck you on the first night, mami get your worth right
Homie tryna splash cause your skirt tight
Baby why your purse light? Step it up
Fendi bag, Chloe bag, nigga steady stressing bout the dough he had
Oh he bad. Byrdgang? yup. Damn them niggas up
Throw me jabs, first thing yup. Then them niggas fuck-
Bitches with them bigger tits, that's a blast, kiss her lips, slap her ass
Lick the dick then flag a cab
Time to blow it baby girl its getting hot in here, you ain't gotta go to home groupie
But your outta here

You can look, but you can't touch
Touch, but you can't taste
Taste, but you can't eat
Max you's a damn freakComing Soon[Hook]
G's up nigga (G's up), ho's down (ho's down)
If the bitch can't swim she gon' drown (she gon' drown)
Runnin' the streets totin' the fo' pound
If you ain't know we was them niggas, then nigga you know now (DIPSET)
[2x]

[Max B]
I had to fade 'em into black
Hit 'em with the crossover, made 'em jump back
And before all that
I used to make 'em pump crack
Ridin 'shotgun in the Eight slum back
Max leave the streets? Please, they don't want that
They need me in the shit
The .40 cals is mine, the nina's we could split
Cock back, squeeze off, started feedin' 'em with the fifth
And you couldn't really hide, cause I seen that nigga trip
You ain't seen a nigga flip
Until they bank 50 G's and you feed a nigga trips
39th, 40th and you feeding nigga's strips
Beat the nigga bitch
'til she bleedin from the lips (yeah)
Got me speedin' in the six
Drunk off the hen', breezin' in the mist
Chicks believin' in the dick (dick)
Fiendin' for a sniff
Got me needin' for a spliff
Ain't a thing funny, when you fucking with this money
I'mma lean you off a cliff...G's up

[Hook] x2

[Jim Jones]
The picture gettin clearer
If it was bricks than the strip we had to tear it up
If it's beef, the .45th we had to gear
Lookin at my life through this rear viewer mirror
Burnin' in the pike in this brand new Carrera
The game funny, mo' money it's gets weirder
My gang hungry, no money that we scared of
And do us both a favor my nigga, and don't compare us
We still losin' soldiers at this war
Like every other week I'm pourin cold ones at the floor
They just killed Ike, he was going to the store
That's why I roll around fully loaded in the door
A majority the time, I'm tryna stay above the poverty line
And that's a major part of my grind
I still hit the 'hood and park my cars in the nine
While the little niggas pump hard with dimes...

[Hook]

[Jim Jones]
They say success is like omen (pray for me)
You see police will arrest us while we rollin' (I know my rights)
We stay on heat, so if you press we ain't foldin' (fuckers)
You see me in the streets, it ain't a question that I'm holdin'

[Max B] (Jim Jones)
We pimpin' easy
Let niggas hate me, come teach me
The niggas with the big cake, they couldn't reach me (I KNOW)
Now when they see us, they kick game, everything all peachy (Ay, suckas)
Snitch niggas put 'em beneath me, (fuck) believe me

[Jim Jones]
Fuck 'em (that's right) I can't let them break me (not at all)
If I don't die, well then a man is what it makes me (makes me stronger)
I rather ride in the Lambo's with the AC
Top down, stoppin for nothing, coming through frollin'

[Max B] (Jim Jones)
I try to be one of these niggas that do it for nothin' (I need the money)
I got a passion for this shit cause I love it (me too)
Like a piece of pussy when I'm fuckin' (fuckin'), waitin' to cum
Runnin the streets at Lennox Ave., wavin' my gun

[Hook] x2 with ad libs from Jim Jones
[Jim Jones talking until end]
Byrd gang...yeah!
You know the rules man...G's up, hoes down
Fuck it...just let the bitch drown man...
M.O.B. for life!...
I'm about my paper man...
You gotta G mack, but you first gotta G stack
Gotta get your one's up, and then get your fun up, ya smell me?...
Life is a lesson...you live it one and ya learn once...
Ya make the same mistake twice...that might be yo' ass
