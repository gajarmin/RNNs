Song:   If I Could Change

Fast livin' got me trapped in this street game
Before i die i hope i have a chance to make a change
4x

I'm at the time in my life when a nigga ready to change
I'll be dead or in jail if I don't shake this thang
Feel like I'm trapped in a prison, slowly waiting to die
It's getting harder for my people, yet we don't know why
They cuttin sistas off welfare, these kids can't eat
And it's the children like ? turned out by the street
I couldn't see it while I was outside slangin my rocks
Servin' death to my people, commitin the ultimate evil
Robbin' and killin' my own kind, Lord forgive me
Blinded by this life of crime, God somebody hear me
Since the death of my momma, my life is filled with drama
Lost both of my kids, punished for what dirt that I did
I can't bring em back, so I get high to forget
All the mistakes that I made, that time won't let me erase
I keep my head up high, but I'm stuck in this game
Steady checkin' myself, God help me to change

Chorus 4x

If I could change, I'd bring my momma back from the grave
I ain't got too much trouble cause we livin' in the last days
Crime pays, doing broads can get you AIDS, gotta wear a strap these days
All the time I stay high, trying to fight my stress
Jealous fool of the world trying to put me to rest
Last night i had a talk with my momma
Then the cry, asking god if she'd serve a purpose before she dies
You can see it in my eyes, a brotha wanta slow down
I ain't mad at ya daddy cause you didn't come around
I'm knowing that the times is hard, but you can make it
You see the opportunity, you take it
But what about my little baby, I got a mouth to feed
But i still wanta hang on the streets and smoke weed with the O.G.'s
My homies rest in peace in the game
I don't think you'll ever know the pain
I wanta change

Chorus 4x

Lord know, picute me ballin
Trapped in this ghetto with my young G's callin
Henacee and weed when they bury P
A quarter key, 6 G's, when they carry me
Fall on my knees to no nigga
Trapped in this hood, raised by chrome trigga
Never had a pops, a nigga learned to slang cream
Should have been a chemist, the way i work a triple beam
Life, is like a page, I wanta turn
I wanta make a change, but Lord you let my brotha burn
I done seen a nigga lose his life over zurcubian stones
Everynight, my auntie bring a nigga home
Momma worrying cause the rent late
3 strikes, my cousin's doing time upstate
I sent him Camel with no filters
I'm in the ghetto slangin stones with staight killas, ugghh
I know kids that pack gats cause they bout it, bout it
I'm from the murder capital of the world and we rowdy, rowdy
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, Lord put me to sleep
Cause your best friend turn into your enemy
Crooked cops is dirty in this shaded game
Go on take me out the ghetto
I wanta make a change

Chorus fade out[Master P]
Wazzup Steady Mobb'n and Snoop?
I know you all grew up in the ghetto in the westcoast
I'm from down south
But it don't matter whether you from the eastcoast or where ever
Cause the ghetto is a constant struggle
It's all about the mo' money you make
The mo' problems you have
I guess the ghetto is just consequences that we can't exscape
You heard me?

[Crooked Eye]
So many murders jumpin off
Blood soakin the street
So many children worldwide
With nothin to eat
There's no peace
On these trigger happy police
It's hard enough bein born black
These times are brief
Three strikes (Your out!)
Your little homie lost his life
Do a lot of things wrong
To feed his baby at night
I wish I could
Put a lil', love in the hood
Once again, and free all my doggs from the pen
Mercy me, this world ain't what it use to be
It seems the whole world's smoked out
High off D
See my brother, murdered his own grandmother
Now that's sick, all for the love of a hit
No protection, people, dyin of age
The Lord said it would be like this in the last of days
Kidnappin babies
It ain't, safe for our kids
Man it's such a wicked place
In which we live


Chorus [Crooked Eye & Marvin Gaye]
It's a struggle in the city to survive on the streets
	(Oooooooooooooooooooooooh)
(Mercy, mercy, mercy me)
The world is a ghetto full of worn out peace
(These streets ain't what they used tooo be)
So many soldiers dyin everyday to earn a strive
(These streets ain't what they used to beehee)
I'm tired of losin homies to this ghetto life
I'm tired of losin homies to this ghetto life

[Snoop Dogg]
This is somthin for the white, the black, and the brown
]From D-P to Oak-Town
And back down
As the world go round
Another war go down
Behind my smile there's a frown
I'm a king wit no crown
Still I put it down
Acts all my tiny locs
That's on Dogg Pound (Dogg Pound)
Now all my kin folks
Sometimes we have to pause, and reminisce
And get blitzed
And wish for potato chips
And Dip slips, curves, and knuckle balls
I wanna safe em' all
And buck em' all
But I can't
Cause I'm on a tank now
Think now
Stop, pause dogg
Put your drink down
I need your attention, undivided
Cause know a days
Only the strong survive
Everything else
Is fallin to the left of me
With all this jealousy and greed
Dear God, have mercy

Chorus

[Billy Bavgate]
Lord have mercy on me
Cause I wanna be a angel and fly
Tell me who's gonna save the world
When it's destined to die
So much hatred and anxiety
A patriot of God
Bein attacked by the anti-christ
Young brotha better change your life
Cause you runnin outta time
I wish that I could help
But it's too much crime
These fools can't read the signs
I remember all my good times
I call help for my bad times
Infatuated by the by the street crime
If I could change the time
Tell me why, why people gotta die
I finally cried
When my mama died
It's a scary world
I had to bury a beautiful girl
It's gettin' hectic in this cold world
But I'm still tryin to slow down
But only thugs, I hang around
So it's hard now
Lord have mercy

Chorus[C-Murder talking]
You know you done fucked up?
You know you done fucked up, don't ya?
Nigga you really fucked up
We on a muthafuckin mission
I'm ridin dirty with my TRU muthafuckas
Fiend, Steady Mobbin', C-Murder in this bitch
Retaliation is a must
Dumpin rounds on my muthafuckin adversaries

[C-Murder]
Nigga, nigga ridin dirty for revenge
With my friends, I'm on a caper
Ready to kill 'em, if I see 'em
Fuck alarm, hold my paper
I'm a rider, so I leave 'em where I left 'em
When I creep, niggas sleep
And they ain't restin til they deep up in the concrete
Jungle with them slangers, with them bangers and them hustlers
With them killers, smokin woo and makin deals with my TRU niggas
Fiend had some yay, so we flipped it on the block
Steady Mobbin' flew from Cali so we put 'em up on the spot
Servin dub sacks and flippers, fifty shots and quarter bags
Raisin riches no matter week, servin keys out paper bags
And hustlin hard, countin money by the sack
Watch my back, niggas jack
Sweet revenge, counter attack up in my 'lac
Sippin Hennesy and chronic, I'm the tweak for some magic
Rollin the window, nigga, it's him so pistol playin bout to have it
Fuckin bullets gots no name nigga you name is on this one
Ridin dirty with my TRU bitches so nigga on a mission

[Chorus:] (Lines echo in background) X 4
In on a mission, ridin dirty with my TRU thugs
Retaliation, dumpin rounds, with no love

[Fiend]
Fiend, my reason to gunplay
Loadin my chopper right up the one way
Wishin we facin a dead end
So I could show how this gun spray
Just one damn word, that's all I desire
So I could bend these niggas back like chicken wire
Spittin fire, mobbin, s'on when them bullets get to pourin
(..?..) get my adrenalin goin
I ain't ignorin, no problems, no worries baby
I severed the crusher, and buried my (..?..)
Over the dresser, Fiend the trigga my lesser
Gon test ya, with a season to kill
And catch me celebratin across the battlefield
Loco, this is the deal, let's put the gun
To the small of his neck, we got caught up and blast
Until there's nothing left, boy
I thought some more niggas kept, what? what?
Cause I ain't facin prison
Exercising my right to exorcism
Completed my mission, huh?
By lettin the land just listen
Cause they the reason my lil homie ain't livin
So, we on a mission

Chorus X 4

[Steady Mobbin' 1]
(..?..) the cleaner, alias Saddam, nigga
(What's up there?) Cold cop killers
Now it's really on (What's up fool?)
Being crooked, we do it dirty, (We doing it!)
C-Murder and Fiend (There they go!)
We dump the fifty round magazine
Locin and mobbin, til it's clean (Make sure it's clean)
Hooked up with the colonel, and the billy, cause I need cream
Fifteen five, made twenty five, six hummer size (Nigga!)
Muthafuckas died, (Nigga!) all in one night (They die!)

[Steady Mobbin' 2] (A lot of these lines are overlapped by screams
Gunshots, etc. Hard to understand...)
Pulled the trigga on my nigga (Not my nigga, damn!)
As the forty caliber shell, blew up in the neck
Twice in the head, he was dead 'fore his body hit the ground
(Damn dog, don't go nigga!)
Bitches scream, nigga (..?..)
Pull up next to the bodies, I was runnin
My dog's head was blew off
I'm bustin hella (?) (BUCK, BUCK, BUCK)
Hit the driver's side window, as they crash into a pole
(..?..), with a few left in the clip
Some for the driver, the passenger
And the rest of the trigger men[Crooked Eye]
Bullets rain as we killers post it up and took aim
Sellin dope, low and high, didn't notice he came
We was all strapped slippin, didn't see he was there
By the time I realized, bullets was hittin the air
Just then my nigga whole neck got hit
Saw he dropped and I knew we was in some gangsta shit
He was professional, see my nigga kept on his vest
Word was the killer was paid to put him to rest
Bustin rounds, bustin back, tryin to empty the clip
Tryin to move fast to save him, I knew he was hit
Everybody at the scene who swore they was hard
Had a strap deemin to bust, or squeeze out a far

[Billy Bavgate]
Ten figure niggas whippin gats and bezzles
Bavgate still ridin like a rebel
Bitches wasn't ready when the drama came
Or Bavgate down to die for the Mama mayn
I'm still heavy in the game, I'm the king of the Oak
It's still the same cause the rap game is like the dope game
I'm smokin a taylor, strapped down with my kaylor
I walked up and dumped on the haters, you suckas can't fade us
They mad cause we famous, money didn't change us
Ghost Town, 7th ward, we armed and dangerous
I'm thugged out with one in the chamber
If you disrespect No Limit I'm a bang ya

[Crooked Eye]
Chorus
Now tell me
Nigga would you ride or run
Would you crack under pressure when that drama come
(Drama)
Tell me would you live or die
When them choppers start to split and that hot shit fly
(Drama) x2

[Mia X]
Motherfuckers ain't never gotta ask if I ride or run
I'm Mia X, alias biggest mama two guns
I done everything under the sun, been through it
I'm TRU to it, fuck who it gotta be
When the drama's goin down and I'm slightly affiliated
Bitches gotta get eliminated off top
When pressure drops I remain a hard knock
Bitch from off the block where everybody got they shit cocked
I rock that icy shit and roll with cut throats
Ghetto wise guys, Billy Bav and Crooked Eyes
Got to be a sad song blastin shit
For that No Limit click mama smashin shit

[Big Ed]
When drama came she sat beside me so I said fuck it
Whispered murder murder in my ear so I jumped in the bucket
Drama had a street sweeper and choppers and split em
Then she passed me them things and said let's get em (uh oh, ohhh)
Is all you hear nigga before I click clackin
Drama passed me the A-R with the full metal jacket
Kick the door off the brackets, drama took me in
Niggas know when I'm comin they see my dogs, ???
Drama taught me how to kill a nigga with fear
Bitch niggas shouldn't be here (Uh oh, ohhh)
Soldiers at war get the gats and bust
Big Ed brought the drama and in drama I trust

[Crooked Eye]
Chorus x2(Billy Bavgate)

I never been a motherfucking caped crusader
Motherfuckers gonna hate me when I hit'em with this heater
M-O-B, parkadas, fuck milly niggas
You never know when I might roll you up, and smoke you like a philly
Round Philly I do it till its done
Then I pass on down to my son, red rum
Now this kids get done
Cause livin' in the ghetto, niggas die over a hum bum
My lil' homie lost his life over drugs
Smokin' and Drinkin' with the thugs
And only niggas on the block,  show them love
So he don't give a fuck
Hooked wit da colonel til I die
'Till a nigga stick a revolver in my eye
Catchin Bavgate gettin' wet in a drive by
I don't know (buck buck) ask the man in the sky
Red rum when I ride
When I call up the colonel to come and get me
Before them white folks lock me up for a century

Chorus
[Crooked Eye/(Billy Bavgate)]
If you wan't some then come and get some
(Don't make me empty out the 100 round drum nigga)
Red rum x4

(Crooked Eye)

Where we at, (where we at)
Sausa pull his strap if he dump first
But the amature killers didn't know I'm puttin to work
Gave me the reason, commited treason, I wan't his head
Give me his family's bitch, his dogg, or I'm dead
He's marked my cousin
Came through on a sneak with a hit he bust'em
And Lord knows I loved him
Promise his son, I trust him
Heard his last breath, he said rise from my death
Then he shook and died, punched the cluck before my very eyes
Tramatized, thats why my head is all fucked up
I can not sleep, until these niggas are locked up
Red rum (red rum), runnin' wit dis 100 round drum
Huntin the niggas, who pulled the trigger on my closest nigga
Getcha figure, that in this game of pushin coke
It's kill or be killed, its like walking a tight rope
Got it tatted on my arm, nigga, written in blood
I won't rest til I put these niggas head in the mud
Red Rum

(Chorus x4)I be thinking bout' a whole lotta ways of getting paid
And got a lot of ways of getting mine, all the time
If you got it, then I want it, that shit don't stop
Let me get that out ya' nigga
Still we closing down shop
And taking hits at the same time, trying to maintain my ends
Fuck a benz, I'm trying to get a Land Rover
Riding down Magnolia, hit the horn at the real soldiers
Fuck the ones who wanna see me dead all over in Angola
Have 'em saying "Damn, that boy done came up, he done got famous"
And "I know you couldn't test that nigga, cause he was on that dust"
Yeah I caught a joce, but that just was my wake up call
A year and 6, back in town with a lot of rounds
They said I'm tripping, I've got a gift that God gave me
I'll be slipping, I'm crazy, I'm a hustler

Hook
Hustlin' is a habit, we gots to get our paper
Straight mob niggas, touching 6 figures on these capers (x4)

I be an artist like Picasso, when it come to these jacks
Flood my nostrils with this powder, boy you surf to get wet
I need it all in one pop, cause boy my habit can't wait
Get tough, kiss this M-11, and quality on like a safe
See, my trigger finger's shaky, got a bad taste in my mouth
See my nose starting to run and that mean that time bout' out
You know the ghetto's trying to kill me
Thats why I'm giving it to you raw
Fuck what you heard about a nigga, and believe what you saw
Since life or death in these streets, and my seeds gotta eat
The lord gave law to the land
The strong survive by the weak
Don't play no games, cause I'm tweaking, and you know whats next
Get ass-hole Luke out on the floor, oh yeah come up out that there Rolex
Thats on the G to the H to the O-S-T
Hustlin' is a habit and there ain't no cure for me

Hook (x4)

FUCK PEACE, its a violent society
I'm lacking the currency, but shit I need the bread so I can eat
Cops stop it, they don't purify the streets, nigga from Smack Meets
Cause I tell it how it be
Some dope fiends owe me, so they got they ass beat
Such a cold world, wicked ghetto tragedy (your telling me)
I got soldiers with forces and traits from Angola
Pelican fate, meal quick at your ?atrophy?
Tell me why it has to be, cause I'm a G
So many fake ass hoes and foes
Thats how the world goes
Billy Block owed double kilos, she load the steel-o
We on the D-low
Don't make me push it aside like Rico
We getting money in my Bubblelaud Benz
???????? and Magnolia Slim
Boy, why these suckers try to do me
Why they mad
Cause I'm influenced by niggas who make they own movies
While you acting moody, Crooked pass me the tooly
I'm a tuck 'em farther down till they do me
They be shining like African rubies
I'mma a real hustler nigga....

Hook[Crooked Eye]
The bullet missed me, I was high when they tried to get me
Had my nigga with me so them fools, they didn't hit me
Got the scoop from Tito, took out Vito from the corner store
With gold two toe, hit the floor, with four four
So I had to hit the floor, and bullet holes tuckin car doors
Me and B Mo out of pocket off of henny and coke
The closest heat is about fifty seven deep
I'm mad as fuck, I can't come back after o.z
The nigga that hit was intended to get
Was gettin told on (told on) by my homie on the mo phone
The game twisted, niggas crossin each other
Bullets they fly (fly), another nigga die
Why (why)

Chorus
[Billy Bavgate]
Niggas playin both sides
Usually in the end
A busta ass nigga die
[Crooked Eye]
Cross artists
Ain't no friends nigga
Mistakes can cost your lives
Niggas goin strike
And every man got a prize 2X

[Full Blooded]
I heard the shot shout, he took the bullets to his flab
Whatever he had done it don't matter (don't matter)
I seen him close his eyes before his body fell to the streets
Thirty two round clips and it left him beat for weeks
I roam the streets of a dead man
And only ranging on the ground lies a frame ??? brain
Too many cross artists ass niggas
Can't leave a house without the Glock
Too many dogs want Da Hound on my block
I watch that bitch in the rental contenintal
Back fillin up with bullets
Kinda knew it, it was my dog that pull it
Criss crossing ass niggas puttin shit in the game
And took the hit to the back by put the spit in my name

Chorus 2X

[Billy Bavgate]
Niggas playin both sides, usually in the end a buster ass nigga die
A little nigga tryin to get his stripes
The little young motherfucker love dumpin on site
The O.G.'s steady creepin from the sides
Gunshots rang out, slip into the night with a cold gunfight
See these niggas ain't right, Ghost Town niggas ride
Even when I'm high, crazy ass thoughts in my mind
When my own homie cross me in time
Cause he think I make mo money nigga when I grind
What the hell I'm gettin jacked by the one time
These some fucked up times
If any nigga cross the game then he dies

Chorus 2XI be thinking bout' a whole lotta ways of getting paid
And got a lot of ways of getting mine, all the time
If you got it, then I want it, that shit don't stop
Let me get that out ya' nigga

You better kill me, do me in, boy put me to rest

9 months, 10 days, 60 minutes of pain
Moma opened up, screamed my name
Pictured her son in the game
Many nights, I didn't know if I'd see another meal
But you did what you had to do, always keeping it real
Pops was locked up for hustlin, but he gave he can
So I respect the fact, he raised a boy to a man
Now you gone, god sent death to ya tonite
I hope the angels lead the way, guide you straight to the light
Fuck me up in the brain, seein more thugs in them tubes
Life's got your boy hatin and all but there's nothin I can do
Momma I miss ya, this baby boy, gotta move on
So a dedication of my love, is why I wrote ya this song
If I could, I'd glady trade my life in for yours
Takin it like a soulja, and I'm going to war
You haven't made a return since you left, i've been so all alone
Tell me mamma, how ya baby boy supposed to move on

[O'Dell/Peaches]
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...

[Mr. Serv-On]
Even though I had a brother and a sister
You met my pops and made him your mister
He was with ya two years after ya died
And gave me life and took advantage
Now I'm all alone, two kids foster grown
Me, young and scared, of your presence in the world
Fuck you in stress you brought less
And smiled on us, 3 sins without forgiveness
Our witness, a few men coming and going
Now I know they didn't leave for free
So even if I give my fucking life up
This shit didn't amount to what you gave me
A child couldn't breath right, for the first 60 nights in his life
You stand by my side like we was riders and we goin to ride
That's why I get high, this love affair between you and i
And I couldn't believe when my homey said
Him and his momma wasn't family
And I hope god takes the breath out of me
If that even crosses my mind
And in time, I know you gonna leave me
That's why until then, your in my psalm 27 dash one
And I'm your son, momma I love you

[O'Dell/Peaches]
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...

[Billy Bavgate]
Dear momma, forgive me I'm a ghetto child
I'm tryin to slow down, I'm living foul and wild
I know you looking at me from the sky
You say I got my poppy eyes, I gotta long ass story to write
I think about you everytime I'm high
They say a nigga tell the truth when he high
Where I'm a go when I die?  god forgive me
For my stress, my momma left
Me when I was six
I needed a momma as a kid
My poppa wasn't there for me
So I kicked it with my homies
But you still in my heart since the day one
Cuz I'm still your son, and I know where I came from
Fool, like your moms, I'm crying now
Kick it back, smoke a blunt, with fifty wide out

[O'Dell/Peaches]
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...
My life's been different since my moma's gone
Tell me how will I carry on...

[Peaches]
How will I carry on, now that my momma's gone
Dear lord help me be strong, so I can carry on
I'd like to change since you've been gone
How will i, how will I carry on[Crooked Eye]
The bullet missed me, I was high when they tried to get me
Had my nigga with me so them fools, they didn't hit me
Got the scoop from Tito, took out Vito from the corner store
With gold two toe, hit the floor, with four four
So I had to hit the floor, and bullet holes tuckin car doors
Me and B Mo out of pocket off of henny and coke
The closest heat is about fifty seven deep
I'm mad as fuck, I can't come back after o.z
The nigga that hit was intended to get
Was gettin told on (told on) by my homie on the mo phone
The game twisted, niggas crossin each other
Bullets they fly (fly), another nigga die
Why (why)

Chorus
[Billy Bavgate]
Niggas playin both sides
Usually in the end
A busta ass nigga die
[Crooked Eye]
Cross artists
Ain't no friends nigga
Mistakes can cost your lives
Niggas goin strike
And every man got a prize 2X

[Full Blooded]
I heard the shot shout, he took the bullets to his flab
Whatever he had done it don't matter (don't matter)
I seen him close his eyes before his body fell to the streets
Thirty two round clips and it left him beat for weeks
I roam the streets of a dead man
And only ranging on the ground lies a frame ??? brain
Too many cross artists ass niggas
Can't leave a house without the Glock
Too many dogs want Da Hound on my block
I watch that bitch in the rental contenintal
Back fillin up with bullets
Kinda knew it, it was my dog that pull it
Criss crossing ass niggas puttin shit in the game
And took the hit to the back by put the spit in my name

Chorus 2X

[Billy Bavgate]
Niggas playin both sides, usually in the end a buster ass nigga die
A little nigga tryin to get his stripes
The little young motherfucker love dumpin on site
The O.G.'s steady creepin from the sides
Gunshots rang out, slip into the night with a cold gunfight
See these niggas ain't right, Ghost Town niggas ride
Even when I'm high, crazy ass thoughts in my mind
When my own homie cross me in time
Cause he think I make mo money nigga when I grind
What the hell I'm gettin jacked by the one time
These some fucked up times
If any nigga cross the game then he dies

Chorus 2X[Chorus]
GAME that's my thang
And it ain't no rules when you in this game

Gunblast *gunshots* echo fast and all I seen was loose cash
I hit the flo' & when they go I make sure I grab all the dough
The Scene: Long Beach yeah '86
Where: The liquor store nigga on some devilish shit
I went in to grab a drink but I came out a felon
My homeboy got away but shit I wasn't tellin'
So I fell in a trap with no getback
They threw away the key and now I'm a OG
In the County jail rappin & bangin' at the same time
And since I don't smoke cigarettes loc
Shit I gotta slang mine
And I ain't tryin' to get on swole so I ain't fuckin' with the iron
I got bitches bringin' me money & ain't a godamn thing funny
My homeboy Devil from the HCG and Young Side Trey R.I.P
From the ETG [Eight-Trey] and oh yeah Baby Ken Dawg
From the Westside Four-O's got love for Short and my
Homeboy J-Ball from the Seven four ? from that gang
And the homeboy Tracy D from
The big bad ass ese gang them straight killas & they know

Shit...

[Chorus]

[Steady Mobb'n]
There's ten laws to the game nigga be raised by 'em all
Get ya respect on at all times nigga hustle 'til ya ball
Watch them hatas and pretendas and all the shit they do
Cause nowadays some of these niggas be bitches too
Keep the business professional get ya heat at all times
Keep them snitches on the sideline
Cause you know pressure burst the pipeline
Keep ya eyes on ya enemies watch those close to ya
See them outside niggas can't touch ya
It be the ones inside that do ya
Smilin' in ya face but want to take yo' place
Fuck around and be playa let's make a deal with the D.A
Don't be ridin' with no niggas
Who ain't sure if he gon' get down
Cause it only take a split second
To get ya buck buck and lay down
Hesitation'll buy ya fate get that ass all caught up
Ya little homey might be cool
If them other two priors ain't brought up
Remember took time to kill smash and don't give a fuck
Be a hog about ya papers straight hungry for that der come up
Respect the game feel what the soldier talkin' about
If you got to be in that game stack ya change
And get the fuck out!

[Chorus]

[Steady Mobb'n]
Game recognize game ?? kickin' back smokin' Mary Jane

Or represent yo' thang

Master P:

I need a bitch to hold my stash, a bitch to give me some ass
And when I'm on the run I need a ho to send me some cash
I'm a ball 'til I fall and that's the first right
I need a bitch to watch my house while I live the streetlife
And I know it sound crazy
I want a gangsta bitch to have my baby
And pack a 380
And ride calm by the po-pos with dope in the Mercedes
And known to be a lady
And massage me with hennessy and weed when she bathe me

Chorus (2x)

Steady Mobbin' #1:

She gotta be a gangsta bitch bout that gangsta shit
I'm living this gangsta life doing this mob-style shit
I smash like Clyde but need that Bonnie on the side
To hold my straps and busts caps at niggas naps
We can sip hen be homies and best friends
Smash off X-O get his and hers M-10's
Collect my cash, conduct yourself with class
Get respect from my soldiers everytime you pass
When I can't be seen you can inform my team
Call that shot to keep the block on pop
And can pop, more chickens than K-F-C
Lay down organize crime be my d-o-g

Chorus (2x)

Steady Mobbin' #2:

I need a gangsta bitch, I need a gangsta gimp
I need a top notch shorty to hold my clip
And don't be afraid to fall in love with a thug
All you get from this lesson baby girl is true love
She was dapping me, coronel, on my jump when I was locked down
My black queen's sendin' me Lex to the carpound
She see me now she closer than my bitch
She my boo cause she down to do some gangsta shit
And if a bitch trip
She down to boot her for free
My little mama go to work everyday
I run the streets she's a G bitch

Chorus (2x)[Master P]
Wazzup Steady Mobb'n and Snoop?
I know you all grew up in the ghetto in the westcoast
I'm from down south
But it don't matter whether you from the eastcoast or where ever
Cause the ghetto is a constant struggle
It's all about the mo' money you make
The mo' problems you have
I guess the ghetto is just consequences that we can't exscape
You heard me?

[Crooked Eye]
So many murders jumpin off
Blood soakin the street
So many children worldwide
With nothin to eat
There's no peace
On these trigger happy police
It's hard enough bein born black
These times are brief
Three strikes (Your out!)
Your little homie lost his life
Do a lot of things wrong
To feed his baby at night
I wish I could
Put a lil', love in the hood
Once again, and free all my doggs from the pen
Mercy me, this world ain't what it use to be
It seems the whole world's smoked out
High off D
See my brother, murdered his own grandmother
Now that's sick, all for the love of a hit
No protection, people, dyin of age
The Lord said it would be like this in the last of days
Kidnappin babies
It ain't, safe for our kids
Man it's such a wicked place
In which we live


Chorus [Crooked Eye & Marvin Gaye]
It's a struggle in the city to survive on the streets
	(Oooooooooooooooooooooooh)
(Mercy, mercy, mercy me)
The world is a ghetto full of worn out peace
(These streets ain't what they used tooo be)
So many soldiers dyin everyday to earn a strive
(These streets ain't what they used to beehee)
I'm tired of losin homies to this ghetto life
I'm tired of losin homies to this ghetto life

[Snoop Dogg]
This is somthin for the white, the black, and the brown
]From D-P to Oak-Town
And back down
As the world go round
Another war go down
Behind my smile there's a frown
I'm a king wit no crown
Still I put it down
Acts all my tiny locs
That's on Dogg Pound (Dogg Pound)
Now all my kin folks
Sometimes we have to pause, and reminisce
And get blitzed
And wish for potato chips
And Dip slips, curves, and knuckle balls
I wanna safe em' all
And buck em' all
But I can't
Cause I'm on a tank now
Think now
Stop, pause dogg
Put your drink down
I need your attention, undivided
Cause know a days
Only the strong survive
Everything else
Is fallin to the left of me
With all this jealousy and greed
Dear God, have mercy

Chorus

[Billy Bavgate]
Lord have mercy on me
Cause I wanna be a angel and fly
Tell me who's gonna save the world
When it's destined to die
So much hatred and anxiety
A patriot of God
Bein attacked by the anti-christ
Young brotha better change your life
Cause you runnin outta time
I wish that I could help
But it's too much crime
These fools can't read the signs
I remember all my good times
I call help for my bad times
Infatuated by the by the street crime
If I could change the time
Tell me why, why people gotta die
I finally cried
When my mama died
It's a scary world
I had to bury a beautiful girl
It's gettin' hectic in this cold world
But I'm still tryin to slow down
But only thugs, I hang around
So it's hard now
Lord have mercy

And they ain't restin til they deep up in the concrete
Jungle with them slangers, with them bangers and them hustlers
With them killers, smokin woo and makin deals with my TRU niggas
Fiend had some yay, so we flipped it on the block
Steady Mobbin' flew from Cali so we put 'em up on the spot
Servin dub sacks and flippers, fifty shots and quarter bags
Raisin riches no matter week, servin keys out paper bags
And hustlin hard, countin money by the sack
Watch my back, niggas jack
Sweet revenge, counter attack up in my 'lac
Sippin Hennesy and chronic, I'm the tweak for some magic
Rollin the window, nigga, it's him so pistol playin bout to have it
Fuckin bullets gots no name nigga you name is on this one
Ridin dirty with my TRU bitches so nigga on a mission

[Chorus:] (Lines echo in background) X 4
In on a mission, ridin dirty with my TRU thugs
Retaliation, dumpin rounds, with no love

[Fiend]
Fiend, my reason to gunplay
Loadin my chopper right up the one way
Wishin we facin a dead end
So I could show how this gun spray
Just one damn word, that's all I desire
So I could bend these niggas back like chicken wire
Spittin fire, mobbin, s'on when them bullets get to pourin
(..?..) get my adrenalin goin
I ain't ignorin, no problems, no worries baby
I severed the crusher, and buried my (..?..)
Over the dresser, Fiend the trigga my lesser
Gon test ya, with a season to kill
And catch me celebratin across the battlefield
Loco, this is the deal, let's put the gun
To the small of his neck, we got caught up and blast
Until there's nothing left, boy
I thought some more niggas kept, what? what?
Cause I ain't facin prison
Exercising my right to exorcism
Completed my mission, huh?
By lettin the land just listen
Cause they the reason my lil homie ain't livin
So, we on a mission

Chorus X 4

[Steady Mobbin' 1]
(..?..) the cleaner, alias Saddam, nigga
(What's up there?) Cold cop killers
Now it's really on (What's up fool?)
Being crooked, we do it dirty, (We doing it!)
C-Murder and Fiend (There they go!)
We dump the fifty round magazine
Locin and mobbin, til it's clean (Make sure it's clean)
Hooked up with the colonel, and the billy, cause I need cream
Fifteen five, made twenty five, six hummer size (Nigga!)
Muthafuckas died, (Nigga!) all in one night (They die!)

[Steady Mobbin' 2] (A lot of these lines are overlapped by screams
Gunshots, etc. Hard to understand...)
Pulled the trigga on my nigga (Not my nigga, damn!)
As the forty caliber shell, blew up in the neck
Twice in the head, he was dead 'fore his body hit the ground
(Damn dog, don't go nigga!)
Bitches scream, nigga (..?..)
Pull up next to the bodies, I was runnin
My dog's head was blew off
I'm bustin hella (?) (BUCK, BUCK, BUCK)
Hit the driver's side window, as they crash into a pole
(..?..), with a few left in the clip
Some for the driver, the passenger
And the rest of the trigger men[Master P]
Ha ha
One time, homocide, then we who ride
One time, homocide, then we who ride

TRU niggas don't joke check the hundred spokes
From Richmond to Oakland, I got 4
So fool don't fuck with the tank
MP be the Colonel, got gats in the bank
Waitin' for deposits and withdrawls
Got bitches in the ghetto pullin down drawers
Wanna be wit' the gidman got them with the crizam
But fools thinkin of thizangs
I'm ballin niggas straight hauling
Started from texas to new Orleans
Now the game sowed up niggas wanna role up
Bitches better check nuts, niggas betta hold up
Ain't going out like no mark cause I'm marked for death
Got the bulletproof vest with the tattoo on my chest
TRU, niggas could'nt fuck wit it
Steady Mobb'n, Master P nigga go get it
Got mo game than the Lakers, got gats for the haters
Niggas blowin'-?-

[Kane & Abel] If you scared got to church
Busting up with yo dick in the dirt
Six niggas named Paul pull you out the black hearse
I roll wit niggas with eight figures, and ichy triggers
Bring the drama I throwed the judges momma in the Mississippi River
They know the rule bang niggas up never mention their name
I asked Silkk what to do, he said "charge it to the game"
I shake niggas life like dice, got that thug in me like chinese rice Ain't'
Nothin nice I open up shop all night
Like Circle K I circle yo block wit the K, the A-K that is (handle biz) I
Leave that ass looking like Jerry's motherfucking kids
I gotta pocket full of change but ain't dropped a dime yet
Like Jamie Foxx if I gave the bitch some lobster moet
You know whats happenin' next
If Kane and Able representin, from South to the West

[Fiend]
From South to the West, South to the West nigga
See I'm a seventeen survivor sreaming out
Checking No Limit and every word Fiend gimme keep they punk face timid I'm

Steady Mobb'n now five-o got eyes on my stack
Can't be hiding that ain't no denying that
See us niggas from the tank we be ridin strapped

[Mac]
From the South to the West layin niggas to rest
Macadon put it on like a bulletproof vest
Got the tank around my neck representing respect
Do my thang and I collect arm breakin the neck

The tech scream bocka blocka when I cocka
I'm still a soldier my nogga
Catch me G. T and D corner
I be N-O L-I-M-I-T till I D-I-E

[C-Murder]
Time to check my mutherfucking cream
C-Murder living that drug dealers dream
T-R-U and Steady Mobb'n in floss mode
Doing shows at the telly tossin hoes
From the South to the motherfucking West is how we ride
Got No Limit soldiers on my side
Can I please pop a plea if I go to jail
Homicide for them haters on my tail
All my motherfucking enemys gotta die
Cause I ain't going out in a fuckin drive by
Beeper blowing, I got a meetin with the box
They wanna know how we slangin tapes like rocks
Hurry up cause I gotta show in H-Town
Call face No Limit bout to lay it down
Independent, I'm on another level bitch
A million sold, cashin check till I'm rich

[Silkk The Shocker]
From the South to the West, it don't stop
Watch I make the South and West connect like dots
Don't be surprised when I ride act like you know me
Wise like an O.G. kick more shit than Shinobi
Young nigga ballin like Kobe, play low key, Pimp like O.D
Flip my enemy's like OZ's
Mo game than Sega, role up like vegas
Fuck the rest you better step like omega (you know)
Be like man, I'm listenin to to West Coast nigga
Fa sho niggas, smoke you out the most nigga
Pull three or four hoes a show nigga
Call me Mr. crocker, Silkk The Shocker, or just Mr
If not they gon' find yo ass mutha fucking missin
Cause a niggas bout paper
Steady Mobb'n and No Limit pulling of capers

Have a nigga back up lookin all motherfucking puzzled
Just know we bout to ride
From the south to the motherfucking West Side

[C-Loc]
Bitch from South to West, nigga, thuggin ain't easy
??? makes a nigga feel queasy
Got some cheese now the feds trying to peep me
That it from me Biggin Cheesy
Ain't' easy 200 gansta ass niggas that quick to mouth
Punchin time clocks, C down with shift like it eas a jock
Nigga roll something, stop stuntin clown G's dont respect stunting
Take you to that old school whoop yo ass like yo stole sumthin
Busta hunting on the cool with my tools
Playin it like awino in an alley bustin on fools
Weekend thugs I done told ya
Any fool know what happen when you fuck around with some soldiers
Now stunting with that pistol makes it evident
Less you want us to come blow up your fuckin place of residents
Hit the door befoe the phone crank up
Like Billy The Kid I fuck around and make you famous

[Billy Bavgate]
Front page Billy Bavgate
Got trapped in a world of hate
I carry late,reload with rage
Stepped back as I bust my gauge
As the super sport Impala hit the corner sprayed
Bodies layed the bithcass niggas they can't fade
No Limit soldier till I die
Nigga you can tell I'm a killa by my eyes
Fifty soldiers in a tank full of dank
Earned 9% organizing crime is how my time gets spent
Big moves I make, suckas balls I break
Droppin sacks on the spot I got paper to make

[Crooked Eye]
Twin S's I push real game to spit
36 in the bird, B 28 in the bush
From the West to the South I got international game
No limit soldier I told ya respect the tank on the chain, sucka(Billy Bavgate)

I never been a motherfucking caped crusader
Motherfuckers gonna hate me when I hit'em with this heater
M-O-B, parkadas, fuck milly niggas
You never know when I might roll you up, and smoke you like a philly
Round Philly I do it till its done
Then I pass on down to my son, red rum
Now this kids get done
Cause livin' in the ghetto, niggas die over a hum bum
My lil' homie lost his life over drugs
Smokin' and Drinkin' with the thugs
And only niggas on the block,  show them love
So he don't give a fuck
Hooked wit da colonel til I die
'Till a nigga stick a revolver in my eye
Catchin Bavgate gettin' wet in a drive by
I don't know (buck buck) ask the man in the sky
Red rum when I ride
When I call up the colonel to come and get me
Before them white folks lock me up for a century

Chorus
[Crooked Eye/(Billy Bavgate)]
If you wan't some then come and get some
(Don't make me empty out the 100 round drum nigga)
Red rum x4

(Crooked Eye)

Where we at, (where we at)
Sausa pull his strap if he dump first
But the amature killers didn't know I'm puttin to work
Gave me the reason, commited treason, I wan't his head
Give me his family's bitch, his dogg, or I'm dead
He's marked my cousin
Came through on a sneak with a hit he bust'em
And Lord knows I loved him
Promise his son, I trust him
Heard his last breath, he said rise from my death
Then he shook and died, punched the cluck before my very eyes
Tramatized, thats why my head is all fucked up
I can not sleep, until these niggas are locked up
Red rum (red rum), runnin' wit dis 100 round drum
Huntin the niggas, who pulled the trigger on my closest nigga
Getcha figure, that in this game of pushin coke
It's kill or be killed, its like walking a tight rope
Got it tatted on my arm, nigga, written in blood
I won't rest til I put these niggas head in the mud
Red Rum

(Chorus x4)[Crooked Eye]
Bullets rain as we killers post it up and took aim
Sellin dope, low and high, didn't notice he came
We was all strapped slippin, didn't see he was there
By the time I realized, bullets was hittin the air
Just then my nigga whole neck got hit
Saw he dropped and I knew we was in some gangsta shit
He was professional, see my nigga kept on his vest
Word was the killer was paid to put him to rest
Bustin rounds, bustin back, tryin to empty the clip
Tryin to move fast to save him, I knew he was hit
Everybody at the scene who swore they was hard
Had a strap deemin to bust, or squeeze out a far

[Billy Bavgate]
Ten figure niggas whippin gats and bezzles
Bavgate still ridin like a rebel
Bitches wasn't ready when the drama came
Or Bavgate down to die for the Mama mayn
I'm still heavy in the game, I'm the king of the Oak
It's still the same cause the rap game is like the dope game
I'm smokin a taylor, strapped down with my kaylor
I walked up and dumped on the haters, you suckas can't fade us
They mad cause we famous, money didn't change us
Ghost Town, 7th ward, we armed and dangerous
I'm thugged out with one in the chamber
If you disrespect No Limit I'm a bang ya

[Crooked Eye]
Chorus
Now tell me
Nigga would you ride or run
Would you crack under pressure when that drama come
(Drama)
Tell me would you live or die
When them choppers start to split and that hot shit fly
(Drama) x2

[Mia X]
Motherfuckers ain't never gotta ask if I ride or run
I'm Mia X, alias biggest mama two guns
I done everything under the sun, been through it
I'm TRU to it, fuck who it gotta be
When the drama's goin down and I'm slightly affiliated
Bitches gotta get eliminated off top
When pressure drops I remain a hard knock
Bitch from off the block where everybody got they shit cocked
I rock that icy shit and roll with cut throats
Ghetto wise guys, Billy Bav and Crooked Eyes
Got to be a sad song blastin shit
For that No Limit click mama smashin shit

[Big Ed]
When drama came she sat beside me so I said fuck it
Whispered murder murder in my ear so I jumped in the bucket
Drama had a street sweeper and choppers and split em
Then she passed me them things and said let's get em (uh oh, ohhh)
Is all you hear nigga before I click clackin
Drama passed me the A-R with the full metal jacket
Kick the door off the brackets, drama took me in
Niggas know when I'm comin they see my dogs, ???
Drama taught me how to kill a nigga with fear
Bitch niggas shouldn't be here (Uh oh, ohhh)
Soldiers at war get the gats and bust
Big Ed brought the drama and in drama I trust

[Crooked Eye]
Chorus x2(Intro)
Yeah
WESTSIDE up in this muthafucka
(it's an muthafuckin terrorist act)
Puttin it down for the '97
Steady Mobb'n
Westbound (M.O.B.)
You gotta have big balls in this muthafucka
You know
WESTSIDE, yeah
Huh, now, fuck with that
Nut'n but straight killers, dope dealers
Real niggas

(Verse 1)
You gotta have nuts for sho'
It's horror on the strip that'll come from the O
I can flow and stand strapped, dog tops
Livin in the ghetto, it's hard tops
I know a couple of brother's doin hard times
But I stay representin
Picture all the weights I'm liftin
Claimin Ghost town and San Quentin
We had the whole pen locked down
Sayin that they had some problems
With the westbound
Then I called 'Cash' and 'J'
I been released, come get me at the gate
So I can hit the streets and maintain
My composure as a villain
Connected with some serious killers
I beat the case, reload the fill in
It's like the O.J. trap
Niggas from the west is wild
I heard a *POW* then I ducked down
And grab my strap, cause nowhere I met a young nigga
Can put you on your back
Where your heart at

(Chorus)
You gotta have a strong heart
To live in Oakland
You gotta have boss game
To maintain in Oakland
You gotta have big guns son
To live in Oakland
You gotta have a lotta cash
To smash in Oakland

(Verse 2)
Shady dips, sellin thangs off cake meal
Paid cops, mobs on every block
Big twisted, snitches comin up unlisted
Drug wars boss, so watch your doors
It's gettin scandalous
Bitches dirty, watch the set
Manipulation, killers participatin
Real villains, extortion and racketeering
Kidnappin, everybody out jackin
Roll your credits, gots 'em down like gun lead
Paid hits on niggas that bubble quick
Hog (?), dark tape surround his eyes
Last words that he heard was westside (westsiiide)
Pre-meditated drama, block monster
Too much heat, Mr.Sosa, M.O.B
Open your eyes, you can't see me like Steve
Bombshell the G, nuthin but riders ride with me

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Thru the scope I can see the bitch in your eyes
If he's a coward then he dies
To let a real nigga rise
Mob tactics, raw ghetto smash
Affilitation is in the air
So I'm blastin, releasin
Enough heat to match you down to your feet
Vietnam shit in the streets
Beware of your worst nightmare
Please don't park there
Where I'm from we don't play fair

(Verse 4)
We live faster than a 3 minute robbery
Can name hella of a bosses in this game
That wanna stop the siege
Because we're colder than the icelands
And we bury 'em quick
And take no shit from no man
Hit the block
Hangin out the door and chop
Chanel shops, this steady mobbin don't stop
Power moves run fools
Around they trunks, dumpin phat
Showin fools where my heart at

(Chorus)

(Outro): 4x
La la la la la
La la la la[Big Ed]

For Sausa teach the hits from the south to the yay
Lay em down, military minded made niggas
Low to the Last Don still up we paid niggas
Grave diggers be nothin on gods earth that bleed
Stay TRU to the game and keep close my enemies
Pushing crates and tapes all across the states
It used to be D, but now it's street rap CD's
With made niggas, highly paid niggas
Killers on the payroll, so step nigga, roll niggas
Put a hit out on me I put one out on you
You test one of my soldiers I take your whole crew
Banana clip in, Bavgate and Sausa
Commanded by the colonel P, don't like it we lost ya

[Big Ed]
Chorus

Nigga I say shit like dips quick to empty out clips
Big Ed and Steady Mobbin fuck up your block in one dip
It ain't no stoppin cause we military minded niggas
My first phrase as a kid was momma pass the trigger
The captian of this tank No Limit soldier up in this bitch
Making moves with my thugs nigga I plan to be rich
Tatted up strapped tight with tek 9's and Glocks
I'm hittin switches in the four nigga make the front hop
So nigga how many niggas wanna ride with me

Tank dawgs be the niggas that would for die for me
Cause nina war make them hollow tips fly for me

And nigga I'm TRU for life, so can't nuttin come beside us
The colonel got the tank bustin on you niggas
Ground troops of war got killers dumpin on yall niggas

Chorus

[Billy Bavgate]
Bavgate screaming Mary Jane when I mob
Nigga point to the west like Sadaam
Rowdy like the ???, nigga off the hook like a baker
Ghost Town niggas keep one up in the chamber
I lived rough as a youth when I was growing up
Tryin to come up I hit a lick on a cigarette truck
I ain't giving a fuck
I'm gettin loose your main mafia nigga in the movie
Big Ed pumpin lead till they dead
I'm a gangsta gettin watched by the feds
Bavgate gettin high till my last day
No Limit soldier till the comet hit the motherfucking bay- opening interlude: C-Murder, (Crooked Eye)

{*phone rings*}
Hello, hello

Bavgate:
Writin' letters from my jail cell
I'm gettin' pictures in my mail
I'm burnin' fools like the flames in hell
Dear God, please forgive me for my sins
I'm tryin' to have my own
Although he know it's hard for his ghetto kids
I'm gettin' luchie every day before the shift change (shift change)
After the prison got me trapped up in the street game
My bullet holes turned you boy into a scytso
When my real niggas call, I'ma roll
Still somikn' my weed, fillin' my drink I'm the king of the O
Ready to die for the Tank nigga
So, pick up your phone and dial, I'm your muthafuckin' thug pal
When them muthafuckin' killaz call

Chorus: Crooked Eye (C-Murder) 4x
(When the killaz call)
Would you ride, would you die for me
(Come runnin' when them killaz call)
With my back agoinst the wall and them killaz come call for me

C-Murder (Crokked Eye):
When them killaz call they always seem to call me first
Cause I'm know, for puttin' niggas up in the black hurse
Strech limos in the convo with the lights on
And at the grave pourin' liquor on your tombstone
Ready to ride at the drop of a dime and tote 9's
Concealed weapons on my muthafuckin' wasteline
My beeper beep 187 so I know it's real
My niggas love me for my muthafuckin' murder skills
I dressed in black, in a 'Lac, woth two Macks, and it's a pity
'Bout to turn your whjole set, into chopper city
I bring the drama like you spit on my momma
You can't hide when I ride nigga, cause I'ma find ya
(Now tell me)

Chorus: Crooked Eye (C-Murder) 4x

Crooked Eye:
Would you ride for me, step in front a bullet, if it fly for me
Lie for me, buck the world, nigga die for me
I'm livin' fast, so any day could be my last
I'm a soldier, runnin' from the rollers, huh
I'm ghetto livin', tryin' to survive escapin' prison
Bein' a hawk in heaven, paper was my only mission
So if I fall, promise you gon' murder 'em all
Pour some liqour for your nigga
Spray my name on the wall (On the wall)
To all the soldiers, I ask would you ride for me
When my back's against the wall and them killaz come call for me
See every nigga with a pistol ain't gon' pull it
And every nigga that say they down ain't gon' step, in front no bullet
Now tell me nigga...

Chorus: Crooked Eye (C-Murder) 4x

Would you ride?
Would you ride?
