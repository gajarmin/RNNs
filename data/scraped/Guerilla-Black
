Yo, you know how we do it man

{Verse}
If you look up the definition im the meaning of dope man
I ain't about to talk about all of the coke man
All of the pounds that was stronger than toe jam or all of the jugs in the back of that Broham
Ain't nothing hospitable about me i send niggas to hospitals without knees
Imagine the West without me thats like having a vest without heat
I got 100 heats nigga ,100 streets nigga fuck what my album sold ima eat nigga
Go ask my rivals about my survival Im ether nigga so go ask Nas yo
Look what u made me do raise the tool all yall my children in baby blue
Yall can't even stomach yet eating baby food
How yall gon deal with beef with 82s?
40 Navy Blue vest and all that
Jokers while raise the bets I call that
Yo Hot fall back to hit up Bo
So he can come and annoint me with holy oil
Cuz after tonight shit its only war
Whats dinner without dessert? Im wanting more
I told you once Watts was my closest neighbors
Them niggas in the projects owe me hundreds of favors
All you hear is "Baby look" before they blaze ya
I run everything from Central to Acacia
Yes this is King im sending apologies
For all my siblings and they dishonesty
You ask me who the dopest that did it?
I say Scarface, Ice Cube, Big Daddy, and Biggie
2pac, Em, Nas and Jigga
Dj Kayslay then come that fucking Clue nigga
Not to forget Felli Fel and Dj Khaled
Heavy hitters raise hell from Miami to Cali
I was lead away and crucified
You knew i was resurrected when the Uzis fired
You ain't never heard me screaming crip or blood
All you heard was momma leanin up over her son
All u seen was his tats on hiphop.com
And the M-16s and the new shotguns
Somebody call Act Rite, the Dolla Figga butcher
Cut him up in the tub leave his foot in the kitchen
Just a reminda when i find ya
They find you face-up, eyes open and mindless
Yeah its all Black yeah its Guerilla Black
Yeah the killer's back to bring bullets to tracks
Yall part time with it your skills they show
Im hard on the grind all of the real ones know
Im hard on mine tryna get a million sold
Yall all fall in time thats why the deals come slow
I was a hustla way before id eat off rap
Had whips and ice way before i seen contracts
Ask them 6-0s where I made Gs of sacks
Charlene smile in heaven when she see where I'm at
I know how to get a good workout and I ain't talkin Bally's
I know how to send the work in and out of Cali
And when the work's hot it never go wrong
The ? look like they on Creatine when i work em out over the stove
Man how i hate a snitch
I keep my lips and tongue on Lox like Im Jadakiss
Yall mouth bout as big as that Fantasia bitch
Like ? said you can't change a bitch
I stay read with gloves, masks,and mini-MACs
Outside the club like Webbie screaming "gimme that"
You got guns i got guns
Get in my way and ill pop you have you dancin around like Lil Jon
I got 100 weapons; you gon need a old box with gold handles church jacket like John Legend
When i pull out that chrome shotty and start spittin
Niggas face on the block get long as Scottie Pippen
I ain't tired im hungry; i stay on the go everyday like the Energizer bunny
You dudes dont amount to nothin
Yall lookin all soft like yall was on Brokeback Mountain or somethin
You talk about the hood, but that's my life
Yeah you rap good but im twice as nice
I can flip the flow or twist the style
I keep a pistol for those that open they mouth
Man thats unacceptable, and Im impeccable
Skill level so high call it extraterrestrial
Im extraordinary, yall is ordinary
And if there's beef, yall will see what the boy carry
I move with them hammers hard fuck the camouflage
I want yall to see my face when im blastin dog
Yall with them games like Ubisoft
I got a ? and fuck that nigga ima blast the Uzi off
Pull the mask off so u can see thats its truly yours
Fuck all that humble shit u knew me for
I stay crispy like Pringles pushing a candy ride
I was doin this before you was a twinkle in your daddy's eye
You niggas is withered and wrinkled up like dandelions
I dont think of you unhappy niggas with half the mindChorus (repeat x2)
I can make the sunrise, and the moon fall
When my plane land, you better take it off
Stop playing girl, yeah I'm trying to fuck something
Stop playing girl, yeah I'm trying to fuck something

[Verse 1]
Check it
You lookin dope in your Dolce Gabbana boots
Ma there ain't nuthin I can't do, huh
The motion's in the oceans
My dick game is potent, ma what would give you those notions
Cause I'm fat, I hit it like I'm skinny
Choke up that dro from the IHOP to Denny's
It's your choice, real pretty skin tone
Real pretty voice, that make grown men moan
I like your style, your grace, your face
You tasting better than the icing on the cake
And if I say I'll drink your bath water, huh
You know I'm drinking up your bath water

Chorus x2

[Verse 2]
You wanna talk to a balla, don't let them sims stall ya
Slide in ya man's X5, when I call ya
And let ya hair blow
I'm in the Embassy Suite room 304 and don't wear nuthin under your trenchcoat
You remind of Lisa Raye
Cut the lights low so we can play and grind till the day
I got chicks in every city
Some classy, some saddity
And two or three bomber than purple chronic in Phillies
From the G4, to the limo, to the penthouse on South Beach
Since I fucking keep my name out your mouth piece
Skin tone alone drive me crazy
I can't imagine being without ya
Everyday is about ya

Chorus x2

[Verse 3]
We pushin 6's, they pushin Grand Cherokees
Forget them dude's ma, hell I'm the man to see
Fulfill fantasies, slap the ass cheek
Like I did my victims in my last robberies, hell
You know the game, the name, 'B-L-A-C-K'
Pop the champagne then blaze the mary j
From the Bay, back to LA now
I'm old school 'Pelle Pelle' with the chain out
Fade to the right a little like Barbershop
I hit it hard enough that half the neighbors call the cops
Sexy chocolate, I got more power than, 'Stunnin Steve Austin'
Yes please take caution

Chorus x2

Bridge (x4 - through fade)
Don't bring your girl around
Or her panties coming down(Intro):
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (4X)

(Chorus):
You were My First, my last, and my only
Ever since you left I've been lonely
I can't find no love in my homies
Yooouuu allwayys was true (2X)

I knew it, ever since I started see'in ya
A few body scars, a few misdemeanors
You was down when nobody else was down
Helped me stacked the pounds, kept the gat in ya blouse
I admit I used to fuck around a little bit
But I knew that you would always be my chick
You be my shit talk, and next she be in black and blue
It was true I always had to have you
I can still smell the curry shrimp and rice
You'se the only one I ever trusted with my life, shit
I'd like to break up, to make-up, to make love
Them was some of the best times that we ever was

Chorus - 2X

I remember them bitches they tried to hit your sister
Both look at you and got their ass shook up
You was crazy, I was crazier for being with you
Everybody said I shouldn't, I didn't listen
Stealing me outfits for birthdays and holidays
Snatchin shit up with your purse, up at Robinson-Mays
Cleanin the shells at Victoria Secret
Going diamond lovey, and sell it on weekends
You used to say never give the dick away
And if I did me and that bitch just disappear away
Brown Traps I love you like a brother
Everytime when she tired she reminds me of her
My mother, my brother I love'em to the death
No matter what they say I wouldn't love you any less
Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, no matter what they say I wouldn't love you any less

Chorus - 2X

A ho at 18, the 7-18
A day M. Felicish Orlean rest in peace
Part of my heart's gold
It was me and you against the world baby but we helped our own
Some times they went wrong some times they went right
It was the petty shit the reason we fuss and fight
We was closer, than the coast of Nosetrub
Everybody thought they didn't know us
I knew that you was be having my baby
I was scared he be broke, he grow up the same way
If it was up to me you wouldn't have to work for shit
We can live great on the states and live mad rich
I guess God need the soldiers in heaven
Soldier you was and soldier forever, and ever

Chorus - 2X

Uh, uh come on baby
Rest in Peace boo
You know I'm out here I'm doin' the stage you know
You still with me you know through this whole journey
You know what I'm sayin'
Remember when we used to have all the fights[Lady speaking]
(Hook) x2
It's all right
If these fools keep trippin
We going start a fight
Then take it outside
Pull the heats out the car
And they ready to die

[Verse 1: Guerilla Black]
Well I'm Guerilla Black, the one they talking about
Wit a fresh throw way and some dope in my mouth
Just trying to make a liven
C-P-T, hard times that's a given
Flee from the bees, or starve or go to prison
No not me, I hope that be
I don't have to sovote the fiens
I got another plan, I got another plot
I got some-mo grams, I got another spot
Where we can put it, pull out the draws and cook it
I got my enemies all shooken
On the way I handle the .38 and work the weight
I got a stash if the search the place
Move up, or move out the way
You just stand back and do as I say
No, you don't need to know hey they call me hustle man
If you show stop my money
Watch me touch you man (he he he)

(Hook) x2
(Hook 2) x2
You don't really really want it
You don't want it
You don't really really want it
You don't want it wit us, Nooooooo
Wit us, Noooooo

[Verse 2: Guerilla Black]
It's been a long time
I shoulda left you, in the ditch half dead
Fa cause I help you
I got a nephew, was caller 40cal
I got five shots that'll slow you down
Ask around whose compound this
Drinking slize malt liquor
Trey pound in the vest (yes sir)
Lay down in the nest, I got a nice stash
Get to close watch ya ass see a bright flash
Aight man, I give you fair warning
I promise you want breathe, they'll see the morning
Little cock and squeeze, wit those high lows
Smoke lots of weed, that's my motto
I hope you got a good relationship wit Jamaica
Shoot you in Compton, watch them find you in Jamaica (ha ha ha)
Double the paper, I'm loving the odds
Huh, 20 to 1 I'm taken it all dog

(Hook) x2
(Hook 2) x2

[Lady speaking][Verse - Guerilla Black]
I remember when I met you on Crenshaw
I almost crashed my truck, and spilled my Hen' dawg
Yes you, God blessed you, I was trying to get next to you
Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
You said you had a man, I was like "where?"
It was something so different about you
I felt so gifted around you
Even though you had a man and all
I took the chance to call, we held hands at the mall
That day was so special to me
Your man left you at Mickey D's
You called me, I scooped you up
I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
He can't hug you like I hug you
Better yet love you like this thug do

[Hook - Mario Winans]
It's official, you're the one
But you're already taken
Oh I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish I could replace him
Cause I know that baby you're the one

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I'm having the time of my life
Felt the world on wheels, you and your homegirl got some skills
Nobody make me feel like you do
Or better yet real like you, I messed around and killed dude
I seen home-girly just flossin, we made eye contact
Dude always is flossin, me never
You and B-l-a-c-k forever, tattered on my neck in green letters
Late night eating Haagen-Dazs, watching Uncut
And me sitting there, playing wit your butt
Took off your clothes, I hit it on the counch
Even though mom's in the house
Nothing could replace this feeling
It's like winning 2 million, our bond closer than Cicilians
I know old boy won't leave you alone
I know you love him, but our love is strong

[Hook]

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I couldn't leave well enough alone
Hell I had to hit ya cell phone
I left you a message, it went like this, "I love you, mmmuah!"
I guess it's my luck, I goes to the Magic
Damn, ain't that his truck?
I guess you wit him, screw him
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to do him
You seen 'em at Jack In The Box
He was mackin a lot, to some rats in a drop
Now you call The Beat and The Power, dedicate songs every hour
All hell done broke loose
He got your passcode to your cell and my Nextel chrip too
I guess it's time for you to decide
Which one of us you want in your life?

[Hook 2x][Jazze Pha]
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen...(gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen)
This is a Jazze-phizzle produc-shizzle
Ha! (Jazze Pha, Jazze Pha)
Ho boy! Black! Black... give it to 'em daddy

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]
Got somethin' that you need to know
I think I wanna make you my girlfriend
Way too fly, can't let you go
I think I wanna make you my girlfriend
Girl you the flyest, let me inside it
Don't deny it, come on and ride it, baby just try it
Cuz I think I wanna make you my girlfriend

(Guerila Black) Uh, uh

[Verse - Guerilla Black] (Jazze Pha on echos)
I guess what they say, opposites attract
You the first make me, wanna stop my pimp back
My game tight, your frame right
We could do it, 5 or 6 times in the same night
Now I got keys for you, I believes in you
Ma, don't you know, I bleeds for you?
Sheeeit, real tall, you was meant for me
No pretendin' to be, somethin' that you not
No frontin' ma, keep it real sexy
Even though I'm thugged out, like Joe Pesci
Test me, I'm a all natural born winner
We could eat Filet Mignon or shrimps for dinner
(Then enter?), my palace
Rubbin skin with baby oil til both of my hands get calloused
Huh, a fly girl (fly girl), in my world (my world)
No need to ask, you my girl
Come on..

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
You're so captivatin
Just this time I pull on my cape and B(?) cap to save em
Your flava, so distinct
I used to react fast, now, I'm so slow to think
Pink diamonds I lace you wit'
Yellow diamond wit' bracelet
Caribbean vacations, it's just so satisfyin'
I ain't touch ground, ever since I met you I been flyin'
Three quarters of the globe, 4 karats each lobe
Outlined in that white gold
Your frame so uniqe, my game's at the peak
Ma, can't you see, hell, I'm playin for keeps
Come on..

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]

(Jazze Pha) Black, spit it!

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I just wanna talk wit' ya, walk wit' ya
Forget everything ma, I'm tryna get lost wit' ya
In a mind state, where time don't take place
At the San Pedro cliffs, different wines we taste
Toastin' to success of our relationship
Through the, ups and downs I'll embrace you wit'
Nothin' but the love from the deep depths of my heart
Give you hugs in the dark, I'm a (thug from the start?)
Hell, but it's been nothin' but heaven
It's like rollin the dice, and hittin straight seven
Call the reverend's, and get your bridesmate
I can't wait to tie the knot ma, I just can't wait
Come on..

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]

(Jazze Pha)
Jazze Phin-zel, Washingtin-zel, huh
In the flesh with Black, uh
Real big mama, whoo!
You see us, hah
Coladas mama, yeah, like that, uh huh
Whoo! Palm trees and fiends, your neck can bling
Yeah baby can't happen to you
Hahaha! It can happen to yooUUUUU
Hey! Watch me pour Cristal on these gaiters and, they gonna swim again

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]

(Jazze Pha)
Ladies and gentlemen, you have just been..... warned
Hahah! Whoo! That we lookin for the girlfriend...Oh! for the girlfriend

All I ever ate was hot dogs and chips for dinner
I sacrificed so much for my career
That's why my eyes shed blood for tears

[Hook] x4
In my heart it burns this fire
And I don't fear none of y'all

[Verse 2]
I been in the industry for a year now
All my life I wished for this I'm here now
I didn't know it was so much politickinI feel like a motherfuckin' politician
Just yesterday I was out there hustlin'
Did a three song demo, now they want me in
Nines and four fives, pots and drawers
Got Virgin callin me with P Farmer
Give shoutouts to my niggas down and rich
They was with me ever since I was on the bench
When I had no shoes, had no clothes, had no food
Had no dough, had no hoes
Shit was real thirsty back in them times
Like Martin Lawrence a Real Thin Line
I ran across a few real niggas, a lotta hatin' niggas, a lot of fake niggas
Oh lord

[Hook] x4
In my heart it burns this fire
And I don't fear none of y'all

[Verse 3]
If I see you round the way and you catch me in the hood
Show me love, nigga show me love
If I see you rollin a spliff and you seperate the seeds from the buds
Let me get a puff
If you see me pissed off with the hammer in my hand, loadin' slugs
Nigga I'm a thug
If you see me with a bitch that you never seen before
I'mma fuck or nigga I done fucked
I remember when I was just a little boy
Watchin' moms play that organ with that big voice
It touched me in a certain type of way
Like the rhyme smooth sounds of Marvin Gaye
I didn't know Compton was like that
Until I got out there and had to fight back
Walkin' back and forth up the way-ly
Them Lucas Park niggas tried to beat me daily
I guess that shit made me tougher
Thats why I love every last one of my brothers
Hide always, they're with me in the struggle
Whether I'm glad or sad I'mma always love 'em
The game is so fuckin' treacherous
A buncha bullshit niggas, fuck y'all rhetoric

[Hook] x4
In my heart it burns this fire
And I don't fear none of y'all[Verse 1: Guerilla Black]
Man I've walked through so many miles of hatred
They treat me like and alien up off of a spaceship
I heard them talking while I was in hibernation
They looked at me crazy, as if I was Lil' Kim with a face lift
Soon as you leave, they got they hands on the throat
No need for Snoop and Game, I'm a man of my own
Go ask Bishop and mom, they didn't grasp alone (?)
Dollar figure went all through vision, man, in his song (?)
I want to "Touch the Sky", just like Kanye
They treated me like an "Outkast", just like Andre
If I could show 'em my talent, like Beyonce
I'd have Gabrielle Union as my fiance (rarr)
I'd probably be at the Gremlins in tight ass jeans
But, nahh, I ain't rapping like the Black Eyed Peas
But it's not like ain't hot like the Black Eyed Peas
I just rap about the block, and they ain't like me!

[Hook x2: Guerilla Black]
I got my cap on my head and my gun on my hip
And my ice on my wrist
Yeah Guerilla is back
Okay! The killer is hot!
Hold up, Okay! The killer is hot!

[Verse 2: Hot Dollar]
Oh, kay the kid is back
I told you Hot Dollar had a lock on rap
See, motherfuckers thinking they made Hot
The same niggas sic' when the radio play Hot
Yeah I'm doing tours overseas, and they not
Imagining H-Town, at an L.A. spot (Yeah!)
The bigger, son, saw hype since 50
A mill for the deal, all you bitches can miss me
Me and Black ain't the same for brothers
But you can't put the fame above us
Or name another
That spit how the night's here are changing colors
I kill you, singing toungue 'till you shameless mother
Call me the black John Diamond
I'm in my Maserati
Getting head while I drive is a hobby
Riding through the city with my casket face
Scared rappers need church like Pastor Mase!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Guerilla Black]
Don't call it a comeback
The cycle just repeated again
I reinvented the West so you believe it again
I gave you Mario Winans, then Beenie Man
I know you was wondering "Would I see him again?"
Man I came different like Gnarls Barkley
Not with awful Dodgers and Ed Hardey
Niggas'll test a gangster like Charles Barkley
The street side, you ain't seen that part of me!
Yeah they be like "Where Guerilla been?"
I know the haters must must have hated "Did me in"
But I'm back and stronger than a million men
You tired of the fake, let the real begin
Rap was my hustle, I'm a business man
Hip hop ain't died, came to the West to the live
When you mix it with gangta rap, they the best of friends
I love the East, but the South is my next to kin!

[Hook x2]Chorus (repeat x2)
I can make the sunrise, and the moon fall
When my plane land, you better take it off
Stop playing girl, yeah I'm trying to fuck something
Stop playing girl, yeah I'm trying to fuck something

[Verse 1]
Check it
You lookin dope in your Dolce Gabbana boots
Ma there ain't nuthin I can't do, huh
The motion's in the oceans
My dick game is potent, ma what would give you those notions
Cause I'm fat, I hit it like I'm skinny
Choke up that dro from the IHOP to Denny's
It's your choice, real pretty skin tone
Real pretty voice, that make grown men moan
I like your style, your grace, your face
You tasting better than the icing on the cake
And if I say I'll drink your bath water, huh
You know I'm drinking up your bath water

Chorus x2

[Verse 2]
You wanna talk to a balla, don't let them sims stall ya
Slide in ya man's X5, when I call ya
And let ya hair blow
I'm in the Embassy Suite room 304 and don't wear nuthin under your trenchcoat
You remind of Lisa Raye
Cut the lights low so we can play and grind till the day
I got chicks in every city
Some classy, some saddity
And two or three bomber than purple chronic in Phillies
From the G4, to the limo, to the penthouse on South Beach
Since I fucking keep my name out your mouth piece
Skin tone alone drive me crazy
I can't imagine being without ya
Everyday is about ya

Chorus x2

[Verse 3]
We pushin 6's, they pushin Grand Cherokees
Forget them dude's ma, hell I'm the man to see
Fulfill fantasies, slap the ass cheek
Like I did my victims in my last robberies, hell
You know the game, the name, 'B-L-A-C-K'
Pop the champagne then blaze the mary j
From the Bay, back to LA now
I'm old school 'Pelle Pelle' with the chain out
Fade to the right a little like Barbershop
I hit it hard enough that half the neighbors call the cops
Sexy chocolate, I got more power than, 'Stunnin Steve Austin'
Yes please take caution

Chorus x2

Bridge (x4 - through fade)
Don't bring your girl around
Or her panties coming down[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I remember when I met you on Crenshaw
I almost crashed my truck, and spilled my Hen' dawg
Yes you, God blessed you, I was trying to get next to you
Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
You said you had a man, I was like "where?"
It was something so different about you
I felt so gifted around you
Even though you had a man and all
I took the chance to call, we held hands at the mall
That day was so special to me
Your man left you at Mickey D's
You called me, I scooped you up
I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
He can't hug you like I hug you
Better yet love you like this thug do

[Hook - Mario Winans]
It's official, you're the one
But you're already taken
Oh I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish I could replace him
Cause I know that baby you're the one

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I'm having the time of my life
Felt the world on wheels, you and your homegirl got some skills
Nobody make me feel like you do
Or better yet real like you, I messed around and killed dude
I seen home-girly just flossin, we made eye contact
Dude always is flossin, me never
You and B-l-a-c-k forever, tattered on my neck in green letters
Late night eating Haagen-Dazs, watching Uncut
And me sitting there, playing wit your butt
Took off your clothes, I hit it on the counch
Even though mom's in the house
Nothing could replace this feeling
It's like winning 2 million, our bond closer than Cicilians
I know old boy won't leave you alone
I know you love him, but our love is strong

[Hook]

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I couldn't leave well enough alone
Hell I had to hit ya cell phone
I left you a message, it went like this, "I love you, mmmuah!"
I guess it's my luck, I goes to the Magic
Damn, ain't that his truck?
I guess you wit him, screw him
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to do him
You seen 'em at Jack In The Box
He was mackin a lot, to some rats in a drop
Now you call The Beat and The Power, dedicate songs every hour
All hell done broke loose
He got your passcode to your cell and my Nextel chrip too
I guess it's time for you to decide
Which one of us you want in your life?

[Hook 2x][Guerilla Black]
Damn ("I tell you life ain't shit to fool with")
Clayborne Family {*scratch: "Not enough of this will make you mad"*}

We come to take your heads off boy
You thought we was playin?  Hahaha
It's real out here in this field
Come, uh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh

All five go wit chalk in heaven
These niggas they just tried to hit me with seven
Shots to my motherfuckin torso
I had my bulletproof on, and forty-four
They tried to take me from my momma and my boo be
I ran up, shot they ass up in they hooptie
So who the fuck these cats think they talkin to
I put a spark to you, I'll turn your carcass blue, huh
I got my competition beat hands down
You a stand up nigga?  Boom, man's down
Ain't no one, shank or gun, mo' Guerilla
Been everything from weed down to coke dealer
Mo' "Thriller" than M.J. in the early 80's
Call me sensei, I move along the work shady
In my crimi-mal, underworld
I got a minimum about a hundred girls
They cut the dope and hold the fuckin pistols tight
Some cutthroat bitches with they issues right
So don't make me come through and tighten yo' ass up
You ever heavy nigga, watch me lighten yo' ass up

[Chorus: Blak]
("I tell you life ain't shit to fool with")
For my peo-ples, we let the heats go, uhh
("I tell you life ain't shit to fool with")
{*scratch: "Nigga walkin the streets at night is like commitin suicide"*}
("I tell you life ain't shit to fool with")
We let the heats go, for my peo-ples
("I tell you life ain't shit to fool with")
("Feels like I'm viewin a body every other week")

[Marc Live]
See I can strangle kids, now you can read about it
Front page news, they say yo he's a criminal bastard
I walk the streets at night, critical bastard
Masked up, yo I'm triple masked up (blaow)
Beer and 'gnaced up, crazy shit makes my
Temperature flip, dismember your clique
Run in your crib, "Eraser" style - Schwarzaneggar
Shit, I shoot your whole place down
We got the rocket launchers, local police said
Watch out, aiyyo the kid is a monster
Bring your heaviest metal, bring your heaviest level
Clayborne don't run, Clayborne ain't laughin (uh-uh)
Clayborne just smashin (uhh)
We on your block yo, we lower your stock yo
We bring the heat to your block, Jurassic
Run in the jungle make your whole clique crumble

[Chorus]

[Kool Keith]
NBC lost their ratings, but I'm debating
The channel gets new scripts with new flips
I ain't goin nowhere, been here since Madison and C.H.I.P.S
Reality TV sucks, whack-ass actors waste a lot of bucks
I'm serious man, my piss wet your hand
Ask Puff, I'm down, you still tryin to make it in Da Band
My stomach expand, defecate on top of America
My pee stains smell in Japan, groups leave in a caravan
My urine cover the silver screen, who wet up Jackie Chan
Shake with one move the feces to Crisco
Ask your mom duke what's in the fryin pan
You cats ain't wipin the buttcrack yet
You lyrically tryin man, to pitch squat in the street
I squat on your Aunt Chan, my toilet drops are stronger
The steel reserve makes me spit longer
Your girl's mad, dimes sit longer
Flush the commode, woman shit longer
Long coat expert, miss shit on your Phat Farm shirt
Down South Columbine, we combine and twerk
The Valley's makin money, the check is cut
I film the back, the audience feel anal work

Anyone, anyhow, and anyway
Niggas get f**ked up when the mini sprays

Got somethin' that you need to know

Girl you the flyest, let me inside it
Don't deny it, come on and ride it, baby just try it
Cuz I think I wanna make you my girlfriend

(Guerila Black) Uh, uh

[Verse - Guerilla Black] (Jazze Pha on echos)
I guess what they say, opposites attract
You the first make me, wanna stop my pimp back
My game tight, your frame right
We could do it, 5 or 6 times in the same night
Now I got keys for you, I believes in you
Ma, don't you know, I bleeds for you?
Sheeeit, real tall, you was meant for me
No pretendin' to be, somethin' that you not
No frontin' ma, keep it real sexy
Even though I'm thugged out, like Joe Pesci
Test me, I'm a all natural born winner
We could eat Filet Mignon or shrimps for dinner
(Then enter?), my palace
Rubbin skin with baby oil til both of my hands get calloused
Huh, a fly girl (fly girl), in my world (my world)
No need to ask, you my girl
Come on..

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
You're so captivatin
Just this time I pull on my cape and B(?) cap to save em
Your flava, so distinct
I used to react fast, now, I'm so slow to think
Pink diamonds I lace you wit'
Yellow diamond wit' bracelet
Caribbean vacations, it's just so satisfyin'
I ain't touch ground, ever since I met you I been flyin'
Three quarters of the globe, 4 karats each lobe
Outlined in that white gold
Your frame so uniqe, my game's at the peak
Ma, can't you see, hell, I'm playin for keeps
Come on..

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]

(Jazze Pha) Black, spit it!

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I just wanna talk wit' ya, walk wit' ya
Forget everything ma, I'm tryna get lost wit' ya
In a mind state, where time don't take place
At the San Pedro cliffs, different wines we taste
Toastin' to success of our relationship
Through the, ups and downs I'll embrace you wit'
Nothin' but the love from the deep depths of my heart
Give you hugs in the dark, I'm a (thug from the start?)
Hell, but it's been nothin' but heaven
It's like rollin the dice, and hittin straight seven
Call the reverend's, and get your bridesmate
I can't wait to tie the knot ma, I just can't wait
Come on..

Then take it outside
Pull the heats out the car
And they ready to die

[Verse 1: Guerilla Black]
Well I'm Guerilla Black, the one they talking about
Wit a fresh throw way and some dope in my mouth
Just trying to make a liven
C-P-T, hard times that's a given
Flee from the bees, or starve or go to prison
No not me, I hope that be
I don't have to sovote the fiens
I got another plan, I got another plot
I got some-mo grams, I got another spot
Where we can put it, pull out the draws and cook it
I got my enemies all shooken
On the way I handle the .38 and work the weight
I got a stash if the search the place
Move up, or move out the way
You just stand back and do as I say
No, you don't need to know hey they call me hustle man
If you show stop my money
Watch me touch you man (he he he)

[Verse 2: Guerilla Black]
It's been a long time
I shoulda left you, in the ditch half dead
Fa cause I help you
I got a nephew, was caller 40cal
I got five shots that'll slow you down
Ask around whose compound this
Drinking slize malt liquor
Trey pound in the vest (yes sir)
Lay down in the nest, I got a nice stash
Get to close watch ya ass see a bright flash
Aight man, I give you fair warning
I promise you want breathe, they'll see the morning
Little cock and squeeze, wit those high lows
Smoke lots of weed, that's my motto
I hope you got a good relationship wit Jamaica
Shoot you in Compton, watch them find you in Jamaica (ha ha ha)
Double the paper, I'm loving the odds
Huh, 20 to 1 I'm taken it all dog

[Lady speaking](Intro):
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (4X)

(Chorus):
You were My First, my last, and my only
Ever since you left I've been lonely
I can't find no love in my homies
Yooouuu allwayys was true (2X)

I knew it, ever since I started see'in ya
A few body scars, a few misdemeanors
You was down when nobody else was down
Helped me stacked the pounds, kept the gat in ya blouse
I admit I used to fuck around a little bit
But I knew that you would always be my chick
You be my shit talk, and next she be in black and blue
It was true I always had to have you
I can still smell the curry shrimp and rice
You'se the only one I ever trusted with my life, shit
I'd like to break up, to make-up, to make love
Them was some of the best times that we ever was

Chorus - 2X

I remember them bitches they tried to hit your sister
Both look at you and got their ass shook up
You was crazy, I was crazier for being with you
Everybody said I shouldn't, I didn't listen
Stealing me outfits for birthdays and holidays
Snatchin shit up with your purse, up at Robinson-Mays
Cleanin the shells at Victoria Secret
Going diamond lovey, and sell it on weekends
You used to say never give the dick away
And if I did me and that bitch just disappear away
Brown Traps I love you like a brother
Everytime when she tired she reminds me of her
My mother, my brother I love'em to the death
No matter what they say I wouldn't love you any less
Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, no matter what they say I wouldn't love you any less

Chorus - 2X

A ho at 18, the 7-18
A day M. Felicish Orlean rest in peace
Part of my heart's gold
It was me and you against the world baby but we helped our own
Some times they went wrong some times they went right
It was the petty shit the reason we fuss and fight
We was closer, than the coast of Nosetrub
Everybody thought they didn't know us
I knew that you was be having my baby
I was scared he be broke, he grow up the same way
If it was up to me you wouldn't have to work for shit
We can live great on the states and live mad rich
I guess God need the soldiers in heaven
Soldier you was and soldier forever, and ever

Chorus - 2X

Uh, uh come on baby
Rest in Peace boo
You know I'm out here I'm doin' the stage you know
You still with me you know through this whole journey
You know what I'm sayin'

[Verse 1: MC Magic]
Abre a la puertas, muy abiertas, let the Southwest shine
Hungry like I'm homeless, and I can't stop my grind
A ten year struggle, but '06 is mine
Magic City's like my Chronic, see my blood shot eyes
I couldn't stop this
Even if I tried
When I'm at the car show, I got 'em sayin' "Brown Pride"
Like Roger Troutman, top box so fly
Drop the slow jams to make the young girls cry
Not just a verse, homey, this is my life
Ever since my first solo
Back in '95
My whole studio brought the hits every time
That's why I gotta claim, "NB Ridaz til I die"

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Big Gemini]
When I step in the club, I'm headin' straight to the bar
Shinin' bright like a superstar
Shorties all around, yeah, it's goin' down
Take a look, now, what did I found
I'm sayin'
"Hey lil' mama, ven aqui, como te llamas"
Yeah, I like how you working that... (Yeah-i-yay-i-yay)
They call me Gemini, you lookin' hella fly
Just wanna see if we can chat
If only for a minute

We jump in the six, and ride out, you know what it is

The tamale
I got the jalapeno flow
Big Chile, H-Town
Your prima wants to join us, then baby, I'm down
She showed me her panties, and did a little something
You got the sexy sideburns like Ashanti
She does the dishes, that's real big breas-te-sts
Mmm, delicious, pastel y tres leche-ses
I want a girl like you
Not a susia
Like Chapulin o contado con estusia

Repeat Chorus

Low-low, the color of
Coco, yet Guerilla
Rollin' up hydro
Ira, ira, mami hot as fajitas
Or, about
Two, good fish of taquita
I just came from the other side of the border
Tryin' to get my ass back up in California
In the dark, cut with them, the real good aroma
Yeah, up for some of that
Bomb (???)
I'm like the vatos, whenever my pockets'll suckle
You mess around, I'll leave your ass up in a bottle

[Verse 1: Guerilla Black]
I'm from a place called Compton, California
Most of my dogs smoke marijuana
Most on the run from them folks
Whenever they come
They throw that dope
Some swallow it and put in they butt
Not me I stash mine up in the tuck
Mom say son don't be no fool
I'm trying to buy a Bentley, a house on the pool
I just want a piece of the American dream
But Uncle Sam he don't want to share wit me
So when they called up my amigos
He told me bring'em a 10 and kilo

Lord knows it's so damn hard in da struggle
Everybody got either a job or a husel
Bush got everybody going to war
I'm trying to put some 15's up in my car
This is for my baby momma's on food stamps
Girl don't be mad if you lost ya man
It's another dude that'll take his place
Love ur bullet wound and the scar on ya face
And I'ma keep it real
That's the way that is iz
As long as I'm around
I don't play that shit
This is for all my dogs on my block
Hustling from 5 around the clock

It's 2004, I got the 64
On some 24's wit da stop and go's
I got a pinky ring
Wit da prince's cuts
Most of dez cats

I got some Air Force 1's, wit my kaki's on
Wit da fresh throwback and my glasses on

I'm handsome no not ugly
It's the flow spit tin, go getting, high class to chicken
By pass those pigeons hell
Shake; shake when I got the pop in wader
Turn a double up to a brand new quarter

La la la la la la laHello little girl, little boy, with the creams you have eated
Crowling up your boys, Crowling down your face

We're going in that "Yes Sir"
We're going to paranoia
And I can't never pleased up
Why you are so glam

Remember when I was i he grocery store, now's my time
Rock this world and never cline or bad away

We're going in that "Yes Sir"
We're going to paranoia
And I can't never pleased up
Why you are so glam

We're going in that "Yes Sir"
We're going to paranoia
And I can't never pleased up
Why you are so glamOh yeah, oh yeah, oh baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh baby, oh yeah
I remember when I met you on Crenshaw
I almost crashed my truck and spilled my Hen' dawg
Yes you, God blessed you, I was trying to get next to you
Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
You said you had a man, I was like, "Where?"
It was something so different about you
I felt so gifted around you
Even though you had a man and all
I took the chance to call, we held hands at the mall
That day was so special to me
Your man left you at Mickey D's
You called me, I scooped you up
I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
He can't hug you how I hug you
Better yet love you like this thug do
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him
Cause I know that baby you're the one
I'm having the time of my life felt the world on wheels
You and your homegirl got some skills
Nobody make me feel like you do
Or better yet real like you, I messed around and killed dude
I seen homegirly just flossin', we made eye contact
Dude always is flossin', me never
You and B L A C K forever
Tattered on my neck in green letters
Late night eating Hagen-daz, watching Uncut
And me sitting there, playing wit your butt
Took off your clothes, I hit it on the couch
Even though mom's in the house
Nothing could replace this feeling
It's like winning 2 million, our bond closer than Sicilians
I know old boy, won't leave you alone
I know you love him, but our love is strong
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him
Cause I know that baby you're the one
I couldn't leave well enough alone, hell I had to hit ya cell phone
I left you a message, it went like this, "I love you, muah"
I guess it's my luck, I goes to the Magic
Damn, ain't that his truck?
I guess you wit him, screw him
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to do him
You seen 'em at Jack In The Box
He was mackin' a lot, to some rats in a drop
Now you call The Beat and The Power
Dedicate songs every hour all Hell done
Broke loose he got your pass code
To your cell and my Nextel shirt too
I guess it's time for you to decide
Which one of us you want in your ride?
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him
Cause I know that baby you're the one
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him
Cause I know that baby you're the one
