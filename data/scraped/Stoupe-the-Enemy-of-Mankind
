[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Our friendship seemed to be based on what I could do for you, homie
The sad fact is I'm the type of person that would take two for you, homie
You ever give so much till a muhfucker can't give no more?
Give so much of his soul that he feel he can't live no more?
What you want from me? You want blood from me, want another dub from me, money?
You wanna drain me of every single motherfucking drop of love from me, money?
I can feel the eyes staring at me even when it's dark, even when it's cold
I can feel a lie staring at me even though I'm marked, even though I'm old
Y'all are just some "gimme" muhfuckers, "take more of Vinnie" muhfuckers
Never giving back, don't know how to act, just a bunch of shitty muhfuckers
Gradually night goes on, gradually life goes on
It's tearing me apart, never really thought that I'd have to right this wrong
I don't think I'm anti-love, I just think I'm anti-y'all
I just think I'm anti-every-muhfucker-tryna-plan-my-fall
I was never planning to be great,  something that began as a mistake
But me being me, mama always told me I should always share what's on the plate

[Hook: Eamon]
And just waking up is enough of a struggle today
And most of these phonies that's close to me push me away
But there ain't no reason I'm keeping this enemy deep in my veins
Cause I love the pain

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
And just waking up is enough of a struggle, I don't wanna deal with the darkness
Have a motherfucker laid up by himself tryna heal from the conflict
Ever have someone close to you tell you that you really can't when you can?
I wouldn't know nothing 'bout that bullshit, and that's the stamp of a man
And the same one who blamed me, the same one who defamed me
Can't make his own cash, can't wipe his own ass like a baby
Everything is past or it's light, everything is passion and hate
Everything is everything and I don't think I need to keep a track of the date
Everybody take what I offer, everybody play like a pauper
The same ones with they hands out, be the same ones that hate when I prosper
Tryna be a gentleman of sorts, tryna be a better man, of course
Tryna set a living, understand that I'ma always be a veteran of loss
What's the physiology of love? What's the physiology of pain?
What's the physiology of every single person that will probably get to reign?
I don't like when liberty is wrong, I don't like when misery is gone
I can tell all y'all one thing: all y'all gone' miss me when I'm gone

[Hook x2][Intro: A-F-R-O as Don Corleone]
Don Corleone here to tell you about loyalty, respect and underground shit

[Verse 1: A-F-R-O]
The myth of a man let your bridges wither and dance
Oblivious now, primitive, I'm Olympian, now it's routed in pistols
Allow me to buy the album, child imbeciles
I was a coward out to intend powerful minutes for
The crowd, the men, the rowdy, loudest towered sour diesel
Out to seek a pile of reeking, reaching demons, wild deacons
Denial deep, denial seek the child
Teaching my own preaching means
And thinking why I'm leaving rhymes leaking by the evening
Who'da thought the hammer hit ya?
The Ruger spark, leave you handicapped, trapped in wheelchairs
Drop bomb, calm flow forming on
Important, I'm raw mob (Don Corleone)
Take this offer, the vengeance refuse to
Amend all you're used to, remember that you're useful
Uh, and the Godfather speaks
R.A. and Vinnie Paz, Stoupe on the beat
Let's go, Let's get it

[Hook: A-F-R-O & Eamon]
You go against the family, you get buried
It's R.A., A-F-R-O, Stoupe and Vinnie P
Cause most these rappers nowadays is fairies
And y'all could never fuck with JMT
(Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist)

[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Yo, to the piano blue diablo, do an Amadou Diallo
Out the Kilimanjaro, animal, Italiano
Mario Bava giallo, I beat apollo, you eat a hollow
Hole in your middle, look like a seed of avocado
Life gone, I'm beyond body harm, carry an arm in my palm
Leave you bloodier than Carrie at the prom
Man, Van Damme kick a foe, Mantan
Wigger, whoa bam bam bigelow, bigger flow, Riddick Bowe
Summer eighties Bananarama, da ha da ha
Had the hammer to Alabama to where the crackers are
Animated Hanna Barbera rather Cameron's Avatar
Stamina like the man out of Panama, Paz and Allah
Macking Mary Magdalene, Howard Hewett from Shalamar
Rapping assassin like I'm back with Rawkus and Agallah
Pill to a blondie, the ill Bill Cosby
Ill hobby, kill the body, Ingagi, I killed Gandhi
I like Chi-Lites, dice and knife fights
Mics syllables slang slit you, scissor precise slice
Sacrifice, lose suitable beautiful life price
And I could conquer the Devil and I could revise Christ, c'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
The mythical man, who come from indivisible fam
You pitiful fam, this shit is gon' get physical fam
You kicking the can, I'm visual like Dario Argento
Like stabbing you with a pencil inside of the instrumental
If that ain't what you was into, I'll slide inside of your mental
And provide you with a rhyme, that can silence the instrumental
I body you with the Ginsu, but that'll probably be drawn
It's not so hidden, it got a kind of me gone
And I'mma probably be wrong and y'all will probably be on
The anomaly is how you'll be on a quality song
The bodies is on my lawn, the bodies have been deformed
The bodies have been piling up, but I've been silently calm
I had to sound the alarm, I had to try to get rid of 'em
Riddlin' with the Ritalin, little bit of adrenaline
A little bit of medicine in the middle of Ital' and
The only way to really begin again is to end again

[Hook]

[Outro: Cuts by DJ Kwestion]
You know who I am
I'm back and ready to fight
You know who I am
Come out your belly and get shot drastically
You know who I am
I'm back and ready to fight
You know who I am[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Official Pistol, guns drawn

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
When you pray for the rain, you gotta deal with the mud
And when you pray for the pain, you gotta deal with the blood
You ain't capable to hate, if you ain't able to love
But it get muddy in the middle, so I stay with the snub
And I'm Official Pistol 'til the veins stop runnin'
You in hell and it's hot when them trains stop runnin'
And you don't have a choice when the game start dummin'
And your physical is still, but your brain start runnin'
Why I let them eat, but I must have been out of it
Like walked in a portal inside of Being John Malkovich
Y'all are talking loud, but you should just turn it down a bit
Your hands over your head, like you was reading a counterfeit
And I don't rhyme over nothing if it don't sound sick
And all of y'all muhfuckers bite is like a brown pit
Clap at you, like you wearing cap and gown shit
A bunch of Sicilianos shoot at you inside a Crown Vic'

[Hook: Vinnie Paz]
I don't know you, and you don't know me
We should go separate ways, I'ma keep it OG
Come on, I don't know you and you don't know me
You should go that-away, I'ma keep it OG

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Young boys out here think that rappin' is dead
Glorifying dirt bags and they trappin' instead
I'ma ressurect hardbody rap from the dead
Crucify 'em like Christ, put a rack on his head
I've been here for twenty years, and y'all have been here for two days
Ain't nobody talking to you dippin' into Kool-Aid
Razor under the tongue, I cut you like a school day
Blood spill in high definition like a Blu Ray
The bullets in this motherfucker small, but the shotty big
Recoil make you kick back like Karate Kid
I ain't tryna offend a motherfucker but I prolly did
I ain't playing 'round, motherfucker, some'n gotta give
But I don't give a fuck, money, I will get your nana hit
Vinnie a gorilla, I will feed you a banana clip
Only way to get 'em dirty is to get your hands in it
And I don't play politics, I was never a fan of it

[Hook][Intro: Richard Nixon (US Government PSA)]
I have spoken to you from this office
Where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this nation
I have always tried to do what was best
(Duck...and cover!)

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I don't know why I'm over here, this job is evil
They sent me here to Vietnam to kill innocent people
My mother always said, the President he doesn't care
He's trying to leave the footprints of America there
They say we trying to stop Chinese expansion
But I ain't seen no Chinese since we landed
Sent my whole entire unit thinking we could win
Against the Vietcong guerrillas there in Gia Định
I didn't sign up to kill women or any children
For every enemy soldier, we killing six civilians
Yeah, and it ain't right to me
I ain't got enough of motherfucking fight in me
It frightens me, and I just wanna see my son and moms
But over here they dropping seven million tons of bombs
I spent my days dodging all these booby-traps and mines
And at night, praying to God that I get back alive
And I'm forced to sit back and wonder
Why I was a part of Operation Rolling Thunder
In a foxhole with nine months left here
Jungle like the fucking harbinger of death here

[Interlude - Vinnie Paz + (R.A. The Rugged Man)]
I don't wanna be here. I'm scared, I just wanna go home
(You fucking kidding me?! Don't be a pussy, don't you love your country? I like being here, I'm ready)

[Verse 2: R.A. the Rugged Man]
True story
Call me Thorburn, John A., staff sergeant
Marksman, skilled in killing, illing, I'm able and willing
Kill a village elephant
Raping and pillage a village
Illegitimate killers
U.S. Military guerrillas
This ain't no real war, Vietnam shit
World War II, that's a war
This is just a military conflict
Soothing drug abusing, Vietnamese women screwing
Sex, gambling and boozing, all this shit is amusing
Bitches and guns, this is every man's dream
I don't wanna go home where I'm just an ordinary human being
Special Op, Huey chopper gun ship run shit
Gook run when the minigun spit, won't miss
Kill shit, spit four-thousand bullets a minute
Victor Charlie, hair-trigger, hit it, I'm in it to win it
Get it, the lieutenant hinted, the villain, I been it
The killing, I did it, cripple, did it
Pictures I painted is vivid, live it
A wizard with weapons, the secret mission, we bout to begin it
Government funded, behind enemy lines
Bullets is spraying, it's heating up a hundred degrees
The enemies the North Vietnamese, bitch please
Ain't no sweat, I'm told be at ease
Until I see the pilot got hit, and we bout to hit some trees
Tail rotor broke, crash land
American man in Cambodia, right in the enemy hand
Take a swig of the Whiskey to calm us
Them yellow men wearing black pajamas, they wanna harm us
They all up on us, bang, bang, bullet hit my chest, feel no pain
To my left, the captain caught a bullet right in his brain
Body parts flying, loss of limbs, explosions
Bad intentions, I see my best friend's intestines
Pray to the one above
It's raining, I'm covered in mud
I think I'm dying
I feel dizzy, I'm losing blood
I see my childhood
I'm back in the arms of my mother
I see my whole life
I see Christ, I see bright lights
I see Israelites, Muslims and Christians at peace, no fights
Black, Whites, Asians, people of all types
I must've died then I woke up, surprised I'm alive
I'm in a hospital bed, they rescued me, I survived
I escaped the war came back, but ain't escape Agent Orange
Two of my kids born handicapped
Spastic, quadriplegia, micro cephalic
Cerebral palsy, cortical blindness
Name it, they had it
My son died, he ain't live
But I still try to think positive
Cause in life, God take, God give[Verse 1]
You motherfuckers better guard your grill, conquer the kill, and bow to the architect
Every single beat and rhyme is poisonous as arsenic
Murder just a part of it, I can see the art in it
I can see the pain and the fallen angel in all of it
You a shell of your former self and that's unfortunate
Artillery is Heavy and ammunition inordinate
I would never start a fucking war that wasn't warranted
Bullets flying back and forth at you like it's an argument
I'm up to here in shit; it's either shovel it or walk in it
It doesn't go away just cause you choosing not to talk of it
I don't even rhyme over a beat: I fucking torture it
Like taking a butterfly and ripping the wings off of it
There's drama, muhfucker, then I'ma be at the heart of it
Take his fucking head and demolish it
I'm on some Damala shit
Mississippi, maul a God, all of it
You a sweet vic, Pa, lighter than a Parliament

[Hook x2]
"Straight up and down, you don't want no conflict"
"I draw first blood, it's over with, and that's that"
"Cause I'ma send you home with your muthafucking teeth missin'"
"The worst slaughter / Devils poisoning the birth water"

[Verse 2]
You muhfuckas ain't cut like that
Have your whole fam wondering where they loved one at
And the po-9 wondering where they suspect at
I ain't doing five bullets, money, fuck that rap
I will cut that cat, I will put him in the ambulance
Bullets from the automatic make 'em do the Hammer Dance
You a lost cause, muhfucka never had a chance
Pazienza rhyme like a muhfuckin' avalanche
I'ma let this big Colt four-five rip off
And lift a muhfucka off his feet like a tip-off
Son got mangled cause he was starting to lip off
I hit him till his shoulders touched back like a kickoff
I talked a lot of shit for years and dumbed out
But that's why we have two ears and one mouth
Nowadays, most of my peers has run out
And that's why ghosts appear at son house

[Hook][Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
The murder hadn't occurred to me, burgundy wasn't burgundy
Purposely earth to me like a virgin had given birth to me
It's irking me that you would consider uttering words to me
Nervously urging me to keep killing and killing perfectly
Certainly third degree burns followed by having surgery
When he deferred to me, he was poisoned by drinking mercury
Hurdling over things that are currently in my periphery
It's all a blur to me, I was never sensing the urgency
Never sensing emergency, never sensing the thrill
Never sensing the certainty, never searching the kill
Was never searching, everything was done in the name of wicked
The brother's name was indifferent, the hunger pain wasn't lifted
That was Satan, black wings and a man made pedestal
The only fucking rapper could see me is my identical
Another story, another chapter, another parable
I miss making music with Stoupe, cause he incredible

"God is the 777"

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Vocally none of y'all are approaching me or come close to me
Hopefully you aware that you only holding my groceries
Openly holding the only opening in the hope to me
Provoking me is only gonna result in a choking spree
Supposedly I was sent by holiness, it's unknown to me
Loaning me Book of Law without Aleister Crowley owning me
Globally doing things that you only could dream of locally
I son you motherfuckers like you was peddling dope for me
The guns is always with me so I would never feel lonely
Combine it with the fact that I'm irresponsible socially
Supposed to be the art of the mechanism of action
Embezzlement of the fraction, the pessimism of passion
It had to be the psyche and the cunning of the Assassin
The tongue will give you a lashing like Punisher when he's rapping
I bludgeon you just for asking where the other fucking rapper is
Choppin' bodies up and mail 'em out in several packages

"God is the 777"[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
You came thru the door, with the chain and the saw
And the 'caine and the raw, and the flame on the four
I would never think that you could change to the core
But I seen't it before and it strangled the boy
And I remember that we was workin' hard for the deal
When you giving everything inside ya heart, and it's real
The only white boy that was sharp for the kill
But Eminem was evidently harboring skill
And the arson was real, and the starvin' was real
Are you kidding me? Literally, all the darkness was real
And the sharks in the field, make it hard to appeal
The apartment was filled, with the dark and the pills
That was just an element that's par for the course
And we signed on the dots, and we fought, and we lost
And we won, when we brought our fuckin' gun to the courts
Now me and my two brothers is just one with the boss yeaaah

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Don't ever in ya life play God with me
I'm a seven time rhyme winner you's a nominee
Hit me with a passport, stone, drugs, ornery
Bullets spit fast God, Bone Thugs Harmony
And don't even question who I'm targeting
It ain't no one specific, this is just a slaughtering
This is just an offering, this is just a torturing
This is just an everyday occurrence of The Sharpening
This is just a neutron bomb in the palm
I'm the God, I'm the wrong, I'm the calm in the storm
I'm the ever living every single garment that's worn
I'm Imam, I'm Islam, I'm the thorn and the horn, baby
I was on the mic ("1, 2 - is this thing on?")
You was just an asshole, rama lama ding dong
Bullets go forth back, back forth, ping pong
Vinnie hold arms like a person with a sling on, yeaaaah[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
My rap equivalent to a militant bomb
My syllabus form, the Pazienza killer from 'Nam
With steel in my palm, guerrillas was born, your village is gone
It's either that you die or give your will to Islam
I feel it's a storm, that buildin' from the wilderness arm
I sent the alarm, to let you know Godzilla was spawned
I'd kill for my moms, ain't nobody as real as my moms
And it ain't any woman ever know the deal like my moms
I build with Iman's in holy places filled with Qu'rans
My killers is strong, cause every Sicilian is strong
You stealin' the form, I'm sharper then a million Don's
I'm buildin' a bomb, and when I see a milli' I'm gone[Intro: Slaine talking]
Wake up
Wake up motherfucker

(Strobe light effect everything movin' slow)

[Verse One: Slaine]
I woke up afternoon with my jeans and my jacket on
Empty bottles everywhere, Jameson and Jack is gone
Ashes on the futon, roaches in the ashtray
Cocaine residue stickin' to a glass plate
Eyes on fire, head bumpin' like a bass kick
Last night's a blur let's ensure I was wasted
But what I do last night?
Where was I last night?
A kid from Miami round 5 on a fast flight
Hopped in a cab to the lab laid a rhyme
Met my peoples at the bars for some drinks, eight or nine
I was blunted when I came, puffin' marijuana blends
Caught up with some corner friends
They fucked me out my mind, I mean they must've no doubt
Cause I'm on the couch with a night I know nothin' about
I'm a villain in the night when I'm spillin' my drinks
Until I piece it back together and I fill in the blanks

[Scratched Hook x2]
(I'm sick demented, I came to represent it)
(Drugs got my brains fried makin' it hard to think)
(Strobe light effect everything movin' slow)
(I keep livin' like this I might lose it)

[Verse Two: Slaine]
My anxiety was awful, kept me feelin' hostile
I stopped pacin', my heart racin', a flarin' nostril
I remember a girl who was wearin' some Aeropostale
A lost soul, I think she had me caught in a lasso
All day a sucker for love, I'm such an asshole
Drink on and drugs kick in, it's only natural
Mixed up like Donnie Soprano and Tony Brasco
Dick suckin', crazy ass hoes, it ain't a hassle
This is how I was thinkin' 'bout the bitches and the drinkin'
I figured the blinds open has us blinkin' on a Lincoln
My man was walkin' toward my stoop my fuckin' heart sinkin'
Bangin' on my door, something smelled fishy I stopped drinkin'
Pulled me aside his eyes are clouded with tears he can't see
He said, "Allison is dead."
Oh my God it can't be
The pain written on his face he didn't have to talk it
My address was on a script bottle in her pocket

[Scratched Hook x2]

[Verse Three: Slaine]
Yes I'm a man who's been filled with malice and shame
Between dreams and reality I balance and hang
Dare we say that I'm pissin' away my talents and thangs
And what could I have done to save Allison James?
? know me, I was sniffin' coke till the nose bleed
She was eatin' Xany's, shootin' dope until she O.D'd
I took her to the hospital, left her for the doctor
And the nurses probably looked after her, watchin' her
I like to make the details up as I go along
And think I did the right thing even though I know I'm wrong
But I don't know what all this does, push me to the wall
I had another in my cell the smell of pussy on my balls
(She died)
I didn't even know who she was
Maybe she was just a whore who'd only blow me for drugs
Maybe I was just in love on that day in September shit
Maybe it's a fantasy, maybe I remember it

[Scratched Hook x2][Intro]
Utilizing all we know
True to life and
Ten-Four I read you
You're see through
I don't believe you
It ain't what your skin hides that's inside

[Verse 1: Casual]
Sliding in key locks locked in the detox
Amazing escape and evasion plots
Black stone, chiropractor crack you backbone
Spectacular when I rap to ya, it's on
And after I masquerade this mic massacre
Last of the "B-Boy" master spell casters
High-roller, lash the beat
Fantastically and put em' fast asleep
Don't discuss this travesty with his majesty
My styles make bullies look bashful
Y'all heard of casual, I get any advised
I rhyme in every minute to be miniaturized
Squeeze the chalice, till my hands get calices
Challengers get they ass kicked into spastic paralysis
I place pillows in cigarillos
Stuff them bitches to their thickest dildos
A nigga will though, marinate till I mildew
Off a brute dub-sack then and I peel too
Y'all niggas shook like seizures
You skeez' us, please us and I leaves ya
Lamping, with your tramp in the Hamptons
Amped' bout' to run throught they camp then I'm vamping
Like a champion, having fun when I run this

[Hook]
(All we know)
Utilizing
(All we know)
True to life and
Ten-Four I read you
You're see-through
I don't believe you
It ain't what your skin hides that inside

[Verse 2: Virtuoso]
This is the source so know that we hitting you off
I'm forward progress increased with centrifugal force
And as I listen I think who did the mixing on your weak sound
That lacks essential punches like the presidential recount
Deep down address the state of my being
And break in museums to take back our freedom from snakes and demons
We end off, when that cat rap it's Ten-Four
You're see-through, I read you they speak your memoirs
Flash ridiculous flows, master physicist
They be like yo that's the hypnotist the way I get with chicks
Sick of this pre-imposed regiment, we disclose evidence
Of the societal foes decadence
The righteous, we gaining advantage we banish sharks of Satan
Battle the biggest star fuck it bring on a constellation
Watch how I kill and fray the Milky Way the silky spray
Filthy gray clouds, to send them to Earth to slay crowds
In evil assemblages, walk straight mind control of cerebral appendages
So it'll lead to your hemorrhages
Quite likely, cuz' you spread rumours your might fight me
But neglectly to write nightly thinking my hype might be
Overblown, but I'm the most powerful of Jehovah's clones
Poison will, thought they said poison milk from the Cobra's pulm
Figure is Virtuoso slay hard
In a rave squad, with brave guards and layed them in the graveyard

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Del]
Deep within we begin through the grass and moss
Spent a wife from the plantation planned grand larsany
My state's malnutrition a low adjustment what's this
Identify then decide
Virtuoso was hopeful, "Cas" was aggrivated
I knew he had to make it, any task taken
Sink or swim, die young or live in wrinkled skin
Only look again cuz' homies think cuz' thinkin' in
The same civilization, my pen is inkin' it
Of the wise they a minus cuz' wise is a mindset
Dumb, deaf, blind and no time reminding
Your ass stays greedy, needy while I fast
And I'm a start there leave em' marked there
That every thought's clear and concise
They say they lived twice
And try and do me like Christ with spice
Dancing with Manson but I ain't that type alright
A fly "Cas-wise", crack survival tactics
Relax and meditate and apply

The math-quick
Get solutions, skip institutions
Strong constitution for our retribution[Intro: A-F-R-O as Don Corleone]

Allow me to buy the album, child imbeciles

Out to seek a pile of reeking, reaching demons, wild deacons
Denial deep, denial seek the child

The mythical man, who come from indivisible fam
You pitiful fam, this shit is gon' get physical fam
You kicking the can, I'm visual like Dario Argento
Like stabbing you with a pencil inside of the instrumental
If that ain't what you was into, I'll slide inside of your mental
And provide you with a rhyme, that can silence the instrumental
I body you with the Ginsu, but that'll probably be drawn
It's not so hidden, it got a kind of me gone
And I'mma probably be wrong and y'all will probably be on
The anomaly is how you'll be on a quality song
The bodies is on my lawn, the bodies have been deformed

You know who I am
Come out your belly and get shot drastically
You know who I am
I'm back and ready to fight
You know who I am[Vinnie Paz]

You funny style to me, it's war when the beat drop
Just another motherfucker gon' see Pac
You the type that'll run when the heat pop
The type that'll hide a gun when he see cops
But not me, I'll aim a .38 at the crown
Show up the next day at the wake and frown
Yeah, and then I'll laugh at the widow
And my man stoupe blast through the window
Foul when I was young but I survived karma
Drop bombs like a B-25 on ya
Yeah, it's Vietnam in the trenches
Just keep my seat warm on the benches
I run with wild Puerto Ricans that hit L's
And study classical verses by Big L
We came up in the game at the same time
And beat a hundred fifty rappers with the same rhyme

[Hook, samples]
When touch a microphone I usually rock it
Those that don't like it, then you're psychotic
It's on 'til the death, 'til we settle the score
Bust off, we bust back strapped ready for war, what
Been down for years rockin ten for ten ? take your whole damn clan?

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm a mothafuckin baboon
Hit you with thirty-seven stab wounds
Bury your body deep in earth inside a black tomb
You scared of the rain, you fair-weather
I'm hardcore like Paul Bearer in sheer terror
I'll be ready for war with suede Timbs on
Y'all ain't ready to brawl until Vin's gone
Won't stop till you dead in hell
Vinnie Paz, mega-child daddy, Ed Rendell
Was bred to fail, yeah, because the beast in all us
I was rocking Diadoras while you was eating porridge
I was listening to the Hilltop Hustlers
While you was ducking from sounds of popped mufflers
You was playing little games with your fathers
I was robbing motherfuckers for they Starters
You a novice, and I'm a old vet
And I was there when the heavens and the globe met

We ain't safe if the bomb exists
So I side with the Vietnamese Communists
If you with me motherfucker raise your arm and fist
And we can bust a fucking cap and see if God exists
I scarred your wrist, with a poisonous rusty razor
If it's Jedi Mind Tricks then it must be flavour
And it ain't safe no more
Ain't safe in the motherfucking place no more
Get laced in your upper body, face and jaw
You the type of faggot we ain't got the patience for
We break the law, while we pay our respect to Allah
But if it's beef then we be spraying your neck with a four
I love to hear the sound of a corpse drop
So protect your fucking neck like a cough drop
I'm licking four shots from different latitudes
So keep it moving like a bitch that got an attitude[Kool G. Rap]
You know the Don's armed with sixteen
And I do harm for this big cream, the whips and the carriage
Ball like the Knicks and the Mavericks, slipping the fabrics
Pull up wit some big shit, lieutenant shit, hitting the hazards
Spot a bitch wit that Cris habit, gotta have it
Fuck shorty and send her OT wit a brick in her baggage
Roll where the clubs at slip for the rabbit
Trick only lick dick status to get cabbage
She get lathered to the dick baptist
Who back on the map? Giancana wit a vengeance
It's drama to the finish, put the Llama to your appendix
And squeezing the slugs, gun powder season your blood
I'm a legend breathing, the reason you thug (nigga)
This where the buck stops, fuck props
Buck shots at the top money, what the fuck you forgot?
Thought I was done and wasn't touching the block?
Still real, busting the Glock
Put up and you can see it (blaow) what up now?

(Chorus)
"I'll exile barbarian style like an executor"
Wanna test Vinnie Paz man (Jedi Mind Tricks)
Enforce the moves on fools
[?] I'm invincible

[Mike Tyson]
Everybody talks and they like I'm losing my head, I'm losing confidence and that I'm talking loud and vulgar
I'm talking vulgar because I'm angry at what I've experienced all my years through this and I'm just angry!
Everyone else has the right to be angry too but that's just how I express myself

[Vinnie Paz]
Yo, bust a motherfucking gat to this
Y'all believe lies like y'all was Catholics
I rap in Arabic, so my message is just immaculate
My rap elaborate, drink a forty and blaze a sack to it
My aim is accurate, take your brain and blow out the back of it
I'm salty, miserable cat that slap shorties
Looks kinda resemble that, a fat Pauly
I don't even clap, young boy, he claps for me
Chain hang down to my dick, I'm that gaudy
I don't even fuck wit you cats, you rap poorly
I don't even buck at you cats, you that corny
Wit a wack army, we barkin' at you
And Vinnie Paz holds a hammer like a carpenter do
You should understand that I ain't really fuckin' around
And if you don't, you gonna find your body stuffed in the ground
We buckin' em down, cuz that's how wrong my life is
Y'all don't overstand how fuckin' strong my wife is
I'm from a time where every song was righteous
Before rap was just a swarm of white kids
And y'all a witness to the dawn of hypeness
Or just another victim to the pawns and sheisters
I'll feed your corpse to a swarm of vipers
Let em suck the blood till your form is lifeless
What! Fuckin' Vinnie Paz daddy! Jedi Mind Tricks! (Yeah!)

(Chorus)[Verse 1: Breath of Judah]
To the angelic seventh cathedral
Relic illadelphia, right words of power
Him who was holy, who holds the key
That opens, no one considered
Since an initiate's sound of seven trumpets
Those Synagogues of Satan
Will fall down at my feet knowing I've awakened
I'm comin' soon for them, Elohim's the New Jerusalem
Puttin' millennium criticisms on christians
Two shall be revealed by the seventh cathedral seal
As above, so below. Behold David’s seal
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
Those who defame me shall keep open my wounds
No liars allowed in the school of Mogoon

[Verse 2: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Seven plagues of the seven angels
Seven emcees get strangled by the seven holiest triangles
I have mangled plexiglass beams that see through
Sons of Evil like Robbie Knievel
I believe you are the lamb prepared for the verbal slaughter
Save your breath like you was under water
I am torture like the fear of internationalism
Nazi eugenics and economic rationalism
I am the being born unto the scourge
And I am the being bringing holy wars
Orators from the womb of ill Yune
Glory be to the sustainer El Kuluwm
Gabriel fell from the steps of the heavens
Extraditing evil-rooted angels in the seventh

[Hook x2]
As it was in the beginning
So it shall be in the end

[Verse 3: Rasul Allah]
Black Tibetan abbot Abyssinians
That begins the extortiation of the fullations
Battle through the tombs of the Shangri La
Of Illadelphia Shambala, enter the paradigm
Of Rasul Allah Assyrian celestial Hebrews
Penance of the Etherians, hieroglyphians
I am the silhoutte, a risky [?]
The ill czar shine of two one five
Behold sons of limitless light, border rights
That reveal from the seventh heavenly hill
The book of el's, in jail, the apocalyptical tabernacle sacred
Satharotic, propheatical chapels
The synagogues of El Kuluwm, the ghost fills the monastery
Sanctuary cathedral, from the kingdom of Melchezevik
We the mystics redeem the Annunaki Elohim
We were originated from where? The blackness of light
Was formulated from our synapses
If you get tarnished in all phrases and salutation
To the mercifullness, glory of the Sunz of Mansion

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ancient Kemet]
Sink like the Titan', into the cold
Dark waters of the ocean, my thought modes
Shift Atlantis into motion
Elevated to rise beyond the shores, revelators
For episodes to the future, energy seekin'
Intruder, infiltrate the perimeter
Lock your MI, initiation chamber
Prove to the guard snakes, not a stranger
With four large spiritual anger

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Planetary]
Yo, serious syllable wordplay, verse spray
Like a desert bird plays, niggas where the curb lay
Turn plagen, pretty shitty on a church day
Your city my committee, tussle where the dirt stay
Smokers try to sell dirt trays to undercovers
Old heads feed kids, have to run the numbers
Damn shame niggas in my crew can't bang
You demand fame, here's my man frame, champagne
Swig to the wig, Belle vodka hit my rib
Corona beers with a slice of lemon first dig
On an open mic, growl follows, space over night
Destroying your perimeter, players and prototypes
(High powers) Lifting your soul through God's shower
Resurrected your spirit with lyrics for top dollars
My squad holler the loudest, y'all niggas childish
We grown folk here, spitting raw street knowledge

[Hook x2: Planetary, Vinnie Paz]
Y'all can't touch us, cause we ain't fucking around
And y'all can't fuck with us, or else we bucking em down

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
This animal rap, cannibal rap that we make
I hate all, hate law and hate jake
I hate everything that you stand for, it's fake
Cuz anybody biting the God's a day late
I maintain, handle beef Islamly
Manage my life calmly, like I was Gandhi
Fucking with Vinnie Paz, the one man army
It take a shank and metal tank to harm me
Come on b, why you trying to build
Why you trying to get ya whole entire family killed
I'm like a demon outta Amityville
I'm the motherfucking reason that you had any skill
With tight ill, crack ya head like when an egg drop
And put you in the figure-four leglock
And make ya head bop, cause we the rawest around
Vinnie Paz, with my man Stoupe holding me down

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Planetary and (Vinnie Paz)]
Surrender and quit (or I'mma let the venomous spit)
Tremendous equip (we bugging off the Hennessy sip)
The weaponry hit (we hit you with the heavenly shit)
Only reason you live (cuz we at the end of the clip)
The energy split (young cats must be sick in the brain)
We hitting the vein (cuz all of y'all spitting the same)
We tripping the flame (and mounted all the chips in your chain)
We stick to the game (ran and inflicted the pain)
The stitches remain (and matter fact, we sonning y'all kids)
And after that we snatching up your son and your wiz
(We robbing the kids, and putting metal slugs in your wigs)
We stuck in the crib (frozen with your gut to the fridge)
We cutting ya ribs (Jed Mind stifling y'all)
We trifling fall (we pointing fucking rifles at y'all)
(You ain't icy at all, we provoke the sheisty to brawl)
If y'all sleep, Outerspace slicing your jaw

[Hook x2][Intro]
To face what we are in the end
We stand before the light
And our true nature is revealed
Self-revelation is annihilation of self

[Verse 1:]
Mummy, I don't wanna live no more
I don't think I got nothin' else to give no more
It's like I lost my passion for life
It's like all my actions are trife
I don't feel like I used to about the world
I don't feel like I used to about my girl
I just wanna die mummy cause it's too hard
I just wanna lie calmly and to view God
Ever since daddy died it's been pain mummy
It's like there's something wrong with my brain mummy
You was always there for me so I love you
I die for you and I place no one above you
Tell Lenny and the kids that you stay strong
And when I meet my maker that I'm gonna pray for'em
And tell P that I think he'll be a great father
Tell Young that I think he'll be a great author
Tell Planet that his wife and kids are gorgeous
And the same go for Andy and for Marcus
Tell Syze that I have faith in 'em
And never let the industry snakes get 'em

[Interlude]
The entire world is a graveyard
(The ending of time)
We're the ones
(The ending of time)
Who let the dying know
(The ending of time)
The hour has come

[Verse 2:]
I got a few things more I should say mummy
I never meant to hurt you in any way mummy
I never meant to hurt anyone, it's God's work
Cause wakin' up everyday for me is hard work
And tell June that she was the love of my life
And that I never stopped lovin' here even in spite
All the things that we went through together
Through the highs and lows and bad weather
Let Frank know he always made me smile
Tell him back in the days was crazy wild
Tell Stoupe that I always had his back, ma'
And we was meant to be together on a track, ma'
Tell Cheek I consider him a brother
When I die, the pain will spit into another
That's just how life goes ma, it's painful!
I'll come back to you in dreams as an angel
So don't blame yourself for what happened
Cause you was the best mother that I could fathom
So I'm going to the first place I can go
I love you, sincerely Vincenzo!

[Outro]

[[The ending of time]]
[[The entire world's a graveyard]]

Mommy just tell everyone I love them know
What I'm saying? tell my man mike tell my magruff
Keep holding me down know what I mean?
Who let the dying know tell them to stay strong
Tell Devious to keep doing his thing mommy
The hour has come tell locke to keep his head up things
Gonna get better know what I'm saying?
Everything's going to be good for everybody it's just hard
Its just hard for me I know this may seem like its
The easy way out but its not the pain hurt
Tell everyone I love them and I always had their back
Yeah sincerely yours Vinnie Pazienza[Sean Price]
Yes, just infest, the best is I
Leave you, stretched on the sket, in Bedford-Stuy
With a, lead to eject, but I bet if I
Did that, like a rat - you testify?
Niggas like what's the matter with Sean?
I'm like nothing, just thinkin' of a verse
That can shatter the song, foreign bitches
Know the stamina strong, 20 g's for the pictures
Stay in the country, so I married the mob
Don, thirty-two, but the game is 12
And the fifth for these funny niggas; Dave Chappelle
When Run-DMC was fuckin' Raising Hell
I was on the run from d's, these raised in hell
Kinda broke, couldn't raise the bell
Called my man, he broke two fuckin' arms, sold the gauge for bail
Beat the case, got my big gauge back as well
With rap, you can sing such amazing tales, nigga
Ya'll niggas bust my web, heat pop
Niggas cut ya dreads, cuz ya'll scared
Rockin' and rollin', guns and roses
Pockets is swollen, son is holding
Sean P, I'm the master of ceremony
That's blastin' at every phony ass rapper that ever know me
Niggas act like they ready for war
Get slapped with the tool, wake up bitch, get ready for school, one

[Hook 2X: Vinnie Paz]
We in this game for the money and the long life
Whether we battle with the gats or it's all mics
We can rumble with the bats or the long pipes
Vinnie Paz, it's a wrap, with Sean Price

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm more powerful than Gargamel, guard ya grill
And you'll be starved and killed
It's hard to build, when God revel
That you eat lard for meals
So as the saga builds, we need raw shit
We need EPMD to drop more shit
The hardcore shit, bang out, bust a gat
The '84 shit, how they now hustle crack
We build and we destroy until the sun rock
Until we hear the sounds of the last gun shot
But I'mma ride until the wheels fall off
Til the high in these last few pills wear off
You failed with frost, pussy rap, filled and crossed
Sellin' bags of that raw shit filled with salt
I kill ya thoughts, with a nine MA eagle
Make me sick to my stomach, like ya'll gay people
I'mma slay evil, that's what Allah likes
Vinnie Paz, Jedi Mind Tricks, Sean Price

[Hook 2X][Hook]

Torn apart now
I cannot have this combination
And fusion of your elixir
Torn apart now
These are the choices we've made
Do I swallow or walk away?

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, most of my adult life I've been torn into two
If you love me, then I love you and this song is for you
It's tight hard when you know what you said
And your shorty seein' you as an emotional wreck
The closer I get, it's like the farther I feel
And my heart has turned into this heavy armor and steel
It's hard to be real, hard to listen to the dumb shit
And I take a lot of pills cause it numbs shit
I wish I had another path to follow
Wish that I could be a man and learn to pass the bottle
A graphic novel, my future a box or an urn
Havin' dreams about death, but I'm not that concerned
And I'm diseased, through the seasons they turn
Watchin' leaves from the trees turn disease and they burn
I'm eager to learn, but I'm holdin' my breath
And everyday alive is just another closer to death

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, I've been alive longer then I expected to be
And took care of everything that's expected of me
Took care of my girl and my mother
I told her that I'm always here and I love her
I handle shit differently cause I'm grown now
And the truth is that I'd rather be alone now
I'd rather not have to deal with the day
And I hate when people ask me how I'm feelin' today
My brother Rasul, we had a beef and grudge
But we grew up together, cousin, so it's peace and love
I wish all the best, I wish all the shine
I wish I didn't wanna off my thoughts with a nine
I'm thoughtful and kind, but I'm evil alas
But everything I love has turned to a tedious task
I feel that life a waiting game for people to pass
But nobody ever want you to see through the mask

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, I don't wanna be a burden to y'all
I just wanna know exactly what my purpose is for
I feel like nothin' I do is ever right
And that I'm actin' a fool another night
And I admit, I don't take care of myself
So I do a lot of thinkin' and preparing myself
Cause the fact is my father died young and I might, too
And it ain't any way to tell what I might do
I don't wanna leave my mother behind
I don't want for her to cry, because the struggle is mine
I don't want for her to grind no more
I don't want for her to work a 9-to-5 no more
I ain't have to work a fuckin' 9-to-5 before
So I'm tryin' to get this money to provide for y'all
And if the shit ain't work out and I'm suddenly gone
Just remember that the motherfuckin' love isn't gone
Pazman[Intro: Manhunter sample]
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is
You put it together, you get being wanted and desired enough times
He believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted
Because God has power
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah.. Jedi Mind, baby..
Yeah..

Yeah, we bringin' you the hardcore, the real raw type shit
You ain't never seen nothin' before like this
It's all real, all ill, and all natural
We all kill, all steal and blast at you
I like blood, I like tastin' ya flesh
I like slugs, I like David Koresh
I like anything that's related to death
I like any king that can reign with his fist
Now back to the topic at hand
Steadily Shine, Shine Steadily with my fam
I'm the one who put the nail in the cross
I'm the one who told the world about an alien corpse
I'm the one who brought the truth to the light
If you listenin' to me you couldn't lose in a fight
Abusing the mic, with the force of five lions
Anybody fuckin' with Paz can die tryin'

[Hook: Stoupe]
{*Mixed sound clips*}
"Haven't you ever heard of a MC-murderer?"
"It doesn't matter what you say, or what you do"
"Lawnmower man sharp blades slash your vitals"
"While the Technics spin"
"Turn your body into anti-matter"

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I'm a caged lion, always dying to hurt you
Always a believer that my rhyming a virtue
You just a heathen, and you lie like the church do
I can't believe that Allah hasn't cursed you
You too commercial, you still a disgrace
You like to sit around with women watching Will & Grace
I can't over-stand your sweetness
You should try hire a therapist to beat this
I'm being facetious, you should heed this
I'm the one who hammered the first nail in Jesus
I'm the definition of Toxic
Anyone who ever got close to me got sick

[Hook: Stoupe]
{*Mixed sound clips*}

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
We like heavy metal, listening to Sepultura
Remain calm, study Islam and read Torahs
You can't fallow the path so man chill
You can't study the math, you can't build
You can't over-stand what I believe
You drown in an ocean of God and can't breathe
It's like I've been involved with beef
Since the days of (??)
I learned how to worship Allah
I learn how to rhyme, and I teach it to y'all
I'm speakin to y'all, it's hardcore, real rap
Real slugs, real clips and real gats
You real wack, and that's how I feel
And that's the reason that I got a reason to kill

Yeah.. follow me, daddy
Jedi Mind, what's the fuckin' deal?
Walk with me, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Stoupe]
{*Mixed sound clips*}

{*Different clips play until the end of the song*}Yeah, Vinnie Paz baby
2 G baby
Army of the Pharoahs
All that good shit

[Ikon the Hologram]
Yo, yo
The lawnmower man smashes
Through your skull with battle axes
We whip asses, with adjante daggers
That slashes
Crushing opposition like we was fascists
Stigmata and four gashes
We bashes, the faggots who can't attack it right
Take they sternum and then turn them into my acolytes
That's the sight of blood that make a child stop
That's the rights of thugs that keep it wild hot
I hate you, say to pray to a heavenly father
It's fatal, like a NATO military armada
We hotter, warriors from Atlantis
Couldn't understand how raw the Hologram is
The mantis who use the flame rod
Cause y'all couldn't physically bruise the name God

[Diamondback]
Yo the technique, detrimental to your immune
Leave you in the dust, let y'all niggas choke on fumes
It's the tight mikes, aerodynamic, gigantic
The shadow I cast is dominant, royal highness
North Philly's own home-grown cham-pion
Purposely remainin' unknown until shown
Cold as stone, the stage, my home away from home
I, prefer to leave these cloned niggas alone
Buildin' a home for lost MC's gone wrong
Feel the pressure when my team come on strong, it's QD

[Hook repeat 2x]
*Stoupe scratches*
Never try to duplicate the skills executed
But can't the skill execute this right
Listen up y'all suckas to what I say
Breakin out an unstoppable...

[Jus Allah]
Megatraum is fucking monstrous
Hoppin' out of Lake Loch Ness
Every motherfucker in range is left top-less
Quell my metropolis, like shit's cop-less
Y'all cock-less, we stuff y'all in boxes
For stuffed pockets, yo my thugs is thick
Thug'll diss em, when we gotta put a slug in your bitch
Splatter your dame, Pharoahs we shatter your brain
'Till a nigga's salary change to lateral game
Like Calgary Flames, puttin' fire on ice
Put me in hell, for puttin' four nails in Christ

[Louis Logic]
I'm like Billy Goat Gruff under the bridge at Governor Ridge
Waitin' to knock heads off, I'm a mean son-of-a-bitch
With an itch to misbehave and wave a switchblade
In front of your face so close to leave your whiskers shaved
To disengage, or rip the pages from your notepad
And shove 'em up the hole between your lower back and gonads
The only way your rhymes would be the shit
You need to read a script on playin' gay cause you cats could eat a dick
Servin' sucka MC's a fifth of the drunken stylin'
Rippin' M-I-C's like a pub in Dublin, Ireland

[Hook]

[B.A. Barakus]
Hey yo I got a fetish, to see flesh rip
When my Tek spits, breaking the bone where ya'll chest is
I dare a nigga to try and battle
I'll put the sweat in your palms when you swallow your adam's apple
Eat MC's like Chupacabra was eating cattle
Defeat disease with palabras, frequently battle
I make the hardest man fall back and start to squeal
Haul a fifth to his face, taste the steel
This why I got pro deep and stay ruthless
You useless, fuck with us and leave toothless
We're often known as psycho-drama dispensors
Paralyze niggas then put 'em in trauma centers[Produced by Stoupe The Enemy of Mankind]

Yeah
Sean P, Ya Mean
Jedi Mind Tricks, M.F.C

[Sean Price]
Yeah first of all don't make me burst and brawl
Image is nothin you frontin see the thirst in ya'll
Think its fucked up now, it get worst for ya'll
Assassinate your best friend now I hurt you par
Run up on your block wit dough and I curse you all
The fuck out you wanna wet duke squirt your four
Since birth I been raw hot like surface core
Kidnap your baby's mom straight earth the whore
See I do rhyme and crime so I can purchase more
If you ain't in it for that what the purpose for
Act like you don't give a fuck though
Good so I buck fo' shots from the roof
And my man Ruck catch you up close
Never give a fuck about niggas ya'll not Nutso
Hype off of carbonated water and some fructose
Straight buck foes when the nigga Ruck pull the snub nose
Wait Ruck chill, what the deal its all love though
Look into my eyes and you can see there's something changed
Runnin gunnin things knockin niggas out like Clubber Lang
With the gun I bring its straight for beatin you down
Heatin you down leavin you six feet deep in the ground

[Vinnie Paz]
It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

[Jus Allah]
I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
My heart is hateful, my tongue ripped
Lickin on the blade that slayed you
You faggots act as bitch as RuPaul
You niggas share one milkshake with two straws
You're trapped with no doors, four walls tighten
Seein the roof fall, feelin the floors heighten
Crushed and shit, your bones are blood siphoned
And put into a jug we sip before fightin
I'm raw lightning; my power extends
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Black man travel through the universe and back
While cavemen still though that the earth was flat
But we kept the sacred plans, now we carry
Throughout the ancient lands
Before the separating of the sands
God saw the power I create in my hand
He banned my gene strain from replicating in man

[Hook: Vinnie Paz] x2
It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm tasteless; there's beauty in strange places
I find beauty in razors
I find beauty in blood drippin' from ya faces
I find beauty in the Qur'an and all of its Aramaic equations
I find beauty in twelve gauges
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
I find beauty in stainless steel
That can kill and reveal the front of your grill
You're brainless, ya'll don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
I crack jaws and swing swords of the ancients
Ya'll pretended to overstand the matrix
Without attempting to overstand its basics
We dedicated to cats that's been thuggin
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggan
Ya'll been duckin for quite some time now
Vinnie 'bout to teach you how to write some rhymes now
We aim beams in between your eye brows
Jedi Mind, Sean P combine now

"I rap like no one out there can fuck wit me" - Prodigy[Intro: Riley Martin, author of 'The Coming of Tan', speech sample]
"Perhaps you will believe the million feet of film that's been taken above...
Uh... Mexico City, and various other places
If you think that you are alone in this universe
Or that you are the guardians of this universe, then you are rudely mistaken"

[El Eloh from Lost Children of Babylon]
Took a physical odyssey to the fathers of Shabazz
With the shamans of the Cherokees
Arrived in Nevada, 10 miles away from NASA
Met the farmer, in which he revealed to me the
Ohioan crop circles that linked all the star constellations
To 19th galaxy...
The metaphysists that quote the Roswell
New Mexican deserts of death valley
Will he be, extraterrestrial biological entity
Discovering extraordinary memories
Glided across Glassland
Suddenly seeing illuminations from the seven heavens circle of sand
Of Area 51 and 57, separate the schoolkid and reveal the reptilian
I seen the CIA transform into the species of Greys
The Sabbath seven adding up to seven levels of the Majestic 12
Neoclassic traveller
I Travel the Twilight Zone with Einstein and Nikola Tesla
Walk through the wilderness of Ibilis
As the flying disc, of Ezekiel
The pope stands upon the podium
Becomes a Zeta Reticulian
Behold the arrival of the Elohim ..."

[IKon the Verbal Hologram]
...Beware the prophecies of the Tarots!
Alien Spacecraft flying away like Sparrows!
Study the lost prophetic books of the bible
That recites Fallen body energies: spiritual survival
Flying discs seen in Ezekiel 1:3
Granted Kingu a tablet of destinies
Seviates spoke the word of the Bavarian illuminati
I bring forth harmonics of Hiroshima and Nagasaki!
Annunaki planted the seed where I dwell
Either vortex turbines pulling me to hell
Awareness upon my savannah as omni dimensional
Grey species has a common memory complex of the social
Liquid crystal colloidal membranes responding
To the spectrum of the universal intelligence matrix...
The basis is that extraterrestrials created Christ
And have a device that recorded all of Earth's history
And can display it in the form of a hologram precise;
Construction of synthetic humanoids is among us
You have entered the Land Of Nod now, face the deafening thunders
And the spiritual wonders
Because the harvest now is coming
Beware the world-wide ancient tunnel system
The government is running
Hectic! Verbal slaughter of the Judeo-Christian Ethic!

[El Eloh]
The world has turned on its last spin
The coming of Tan- To this wicked land! (x2)

[El Eloh]
Fled with the 5, led through a European wooded ravine
And seen Stonehenge connect and bring upon the Annunaki
The Highest kabbalah mystic chants by Elohim
And looks to the sky for prophecy
Was abducted in Nebraska
Then taken back to the laboratory, experiment performed before me
Non earthly alien autopsy!
Psycho social biological and electro-
-Magnetic manipulation of human consciousness
The Vulcan walks about the abyss!

[IKon the Verbal Hologram]
The Verbal Hologram: Wordle killer like Shark eyes
Speak Babylonian and Hebrew genesis like the Star Gods
Blessed by Biaviians like the French theologians
Anti-Christ is coming in the form of a powerful Roman!
Development of Aids was funded in 1969 for the seven
And injected into 100 million Africans in '77
Cuneiform inscriptions in Western Asia of the Nabu
Dwell in hell, celestial bodies : twelve like Kathabu
But I can rob you of your spirit soul like Xenu
Elders imprisoned, negative Para-physical beings we knew
Function outside the time-track like Ississani
I chose to be enclosed and I fold too, like Origami
Comprehend the theory of reflection like Paromatma
In the epic Sanskrit history of the world like Mahabharata
Praise to His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada

[Riley Martin]
If you stood above the stratosphere
And downloaded 7 gigawatts of negative ions
Into the turbines
Would this not disrupt the electromagnetic flow?[Hook]
I give it to you real raw
You try to tackle me you couldn't make me fall
Forget the microphone you need the iron we squeeze
Play around and you'll fall off the deep end

[Verse 1: Jus Allah]

I am entertained by the pain, moth to a flame
Jarring over your charred remains
Hard to explain to the sane
Tarzan's and Jane's
Smaller brains
The disdained
Harder to obtain, refrain
Unguard your gains
All things obtained are in vein
I am overjoyed to destroy
Boys will be boys
Uncoy deploy noisy toys
Everyday, array of dismay
Dead pray on display
Let the slain lay where they may
Tell 'em how to ban their fellow man
Settle, tell your land
Quell your well in advanced plans
Grace your acquaintances with your complaints
Stated on the page letter
Awaiting the greatest ever
Better late then never
Better you in a crate
One state lesser
One day deader in red shaded decor
Savvyt

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]

The bullet quicker than lightspeed,open gates of Midian in Nightbreed
Any one fucking around with Vinnie he might bleed
Hell is hot and that's where the homing device lead
The body or the head only thing my knife need
I don't need to speak Vinnie's philosophy known
Y'all are weak and talk sloppy like Bobby Chacon
Blood shed and war anti-christ the prophecy shown
I tried to tell you that the Bush's were possibly cloned
You should know about distortions of lessons in college
About the water-fuel cell, the suppression of knowledge
I don't call that mother fucking professor a scholar
I call him a profiteering liar obsessed with the dollar
Why we in Iran if all that we want is Osama?
Why we in a jam when all that we want is Obama?
Bush had you thinkin we at war because he asked God
Then blew up two fucking buildings in our backyard
Blat blat blat

[Hook][Verse 1: Breath of Judah]
I'm on a killing spree
The Cantonese, torturing
Painting a picture, with a paintbrush
In water color of genies
Holding the key, vitality
It's all you need, if your a different being
It will be a different color, when you bleed
Accurately punctured from needles in you nervous system
Are like the seaman, not water soluble
Because of the attributes of yin yang and do
When I cut you simultaneously, like *whang* killing you too quickly
If I were to bang, witness thee, I hang you in aqua
Sending electric shocks to open up all your chakkras
And when I do, all set plants will biochemically plant water beads on your brain
While putting salt water on open wounds to have you in pain

*suf-suf-suffer Chinese water torture, my word is water*

[Verse 2: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Four score, the verbal hologram is verbal war
Chinese water torture into your molecular structure
Ancient scholars wondering where they've seen us
Babylon's hanging gardens and the temple of Artemis
The Hologram, crushing you to grains of sand
Lawnmower man, computer generated battles of the unseen hand
Internal bleeding, I bed my seeding with deadly arrows
Fly like sparrows, and get destroyed by the army of the pharaohs
Cyborg, divine borg to the womb
Alive you will see traveling loons from ???
The ancient palace, the ancient chalice
Mystical like Aurora Borealis
The palace of pain, y'all want get kicked up in flame
Half Abel, half Caine, get slain by the verbal flame
Bring forth the sights of Annunaki Elohim
Images of the 24 supreme
Ripping out your spleen
Distributing gangrene throughout your team
Lord of the rings brings deadly hologramic dreams

[Hook x2]
And my basement's an arrangement of different torture devices
Suf-suf-suffer Chinese water torture, my word is water

[Verse 3: Breath of Judah]
You hear the pounding in your head
When I hit the disc gong, the vibrations will start circulation
Of gongs, the body's meridians and everything
That has pores, even obsidians
With the creek moisture, in this part of the torture
I'll anoint ya
With libations pouring liquids and cleanse
And you'll feel as if you were diving in the oceans
And caught the bends
The elements of the seeds
To cure all disease
Now tell me if you're unpleased
I'll treat you like a dog and never wash off your fleas
Have you waiting till I fill your bowels
With a fish bowl full of frenzying and hungry sea monkeys
Suffering from internal mange
You'll have to consult to the I Ching for change

[Verse 4: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Look in the mirror of souls see exactly where your flaws be
Leaving your squad dead on the side of the road like Ennis Cosby
The Hologram eliminating the Earth's population
Matrix field basics of organic manipulation
Ikon dwell in the forest like the Ewoks
We rot for following the prophetic books of Enoch
In the treetops hang over your cipher like a ninja
Within the perimeters of the disagreeable sinner

[Hook x2][Verse 1: El Eloh]
I am he who walks beyond the cycle of Tan
A guinea systematic survey
On the heavens long before the spells of Kimet
I had advanced cosmos journey apologist
Substantiate statements
I commands the aspects of creation
Astronomers can't even interpret my ancient civilisation
Of Andromeda
The Dragon of Dracos come touch the inner sun
I went forth, a life force out of the core of Epsu
Bring forth the possibilities of solar energy into infinity
Like a Nimbo; endless, trapped it, Kingu;
A myth too ignorant Like the Sumerians
Explorer of the solar system like Galileo
Bring the mist of Mahabharata
Celestial God symbolic to the disagreeable complex mathematics
Of the Hebrew bible
Receive and transmit the letters of the Rasqiniaans
Who have seen the 3rd suns
I am like Milton Milankovich
Who outlined the theory of ground philosophies
Messiah of all biblical tablets
Watch how the process of creation
Links with the measurements of Tan
Scientifical like a geologist
I bring the geological changes to the world
Like the prophecies of the Book of Revelations

[Verse 2: Cosmic Crusader]
The compartment allies
Now my device shatters the fusel anomas
And for my dialectical, destroyed innocuous sinconquent
Travel beyond 5 dimensions
A cipher cytoplasm or phantasm
An archetype
Antithetical to atoms
I leave you vacuous like an Organtoron, pulses
Facilitate my brain waves, determining what planet I’m on
CyberTron transmit my Mhakabaraso over the sea of influence
Never neglect My lobular units
Stereo-material movements
Painfully Cranials statisticals giving your Cerebral Cortex
Damaging Demigods
Crushing egos, into which a wench began by
Extracting a Trans-cordial
Connections of Macros-manic animals
Caves of sleek stature, once sabbatical
Once bring drama
I’m bright on harrowing lava
Within the Plexus from my anatomical
It gets darker
A sense of urgency
Enters the atmosphere with my excursion
In this Microcosm, a third version!
Specifically a generation
Of Mutated
Warriors from the Nether;
That’s ‘Neva Antiquated’
My flux is like somatic stimulation
As macro-electrolytes converge
Eternal recurrence
My mentals merge; its cyclical
But it revamps its own thesis, Reaching
The premium blend in the communion

[Verse 3: Ancient Kemet]
Follow me beyond the cloud
In the stratosphere, to the House of El Huul
It should lead you to a place opposite my heavenly throne
In the temple of ancient Kimet
Who discovered the wonders and the 24 elders
These beings, the Rasqiniaans
Come to enlighten you
With supreme Mathematics
Dramatically stood
12 disagreeable
12 agreeable
7 feet tall in diameter
These elders sit
On the flight in the craft Niburu
Passing through the universe density levels
Heading straight for the wrath of Andromeda
Elliptical physical galaxy
Containing beings in the line of Dracos
Stomping on negative snakes like Broncos
Create magnetic field around my aura
Incapacitating ships
Negative energy creates the spiritual slaughter
Where you dwell in the physical world is horror!
My mind returns to Illyuwn
To inform the elders of the incident
In case of the need for assistance
To return to my epic form
From my physical;
And see my soul arise into a sham
Hitting the arcs of Cumulus clouds of Annun
I left my image of a crop circle in the form of a galactical star map
Perhaps to another plane of consciousness

[Verse 4: Ikon The Verbal Hologram]
Through a series of psychological tests
I have been declared a demon
Traveling through dimensions fatal weapons leave you bleeding
Dissecting gray matter, doesn't matter in my cathedral
But how could you stand my timberlands in your cerebral
Faces of space probes be scattered through my mental
Acoustics in my chamber just endanger instrumental
Fundamental rhythms are symbols of paternal power
Get devoured, by my infinite skills to disappear
Getting lost in the holocaust that rage between my ears
Complex like gravity
Tragically and mathematically
I defeat ya squadron black magically
Analyze the tangle
As you get mangled by my triangular rhythms...
Systematic rotations of my words cause cataclysms

[Verse 5: Breath of Judah]

In the farthest universal
At your communion Nefilim council
Beings come to some planets in your galaxy
That were most frequently visited
Because life existed there
In various forms and deities it was
Why they explore mars
Gives meanings
Ahnk is Jah, foremost to the firm-land
Super friends of man
Fore-prophesise sight
Tight with a photon of light
Rubber band…
Others in Orion, skies or heaven
Star sections, constellation
Ploughing towards us
Lending aid to help our Taurus
Routine, orbit on the slate, clean
Took a thousand
One fall sure four
Equinox a birth time deemed;
The team of thirteen
Searching our rich natural resources
And minerals
To take back after retrieving
Our responsibilities are fulfilled!
Like the Onus of Annun!
And En Yil!
So build the unstoppable force of Evol-u-TION![Killa Sha]
The invincible huh? Yeah ya'll be seein it
It is what it is indeed Stoupie
Ya'll be knowin huh? Let 'em know

[Ikon the Hologram aka Vinnie Paz]
Hold the device tight, when it's time for a mic fight
You're a pagan tryin to battle someone who's Christ-like
The precise knight that smash you with a white pipe
Left you bleeding into the ocean under the night's light
Oh you hype right? Well meet the soul benders
Cop that or get shot at like goaltenders
You roll benches till playin fear was fair game
Ya'll got fucked up like sex on an airplane
That's why we can't change, we just ill
We blow trees, sip Ole E's and spit real
The clip's filled with the wrath that Cain saw
Then I slash with a leather mask and chainsaw
That's why the brain's raw, that's why your veins pour
That's why you copped my shit nine times at the same store
That's why you Entered the Dragon and got slashed
And that's why the Hologram counting up cash. What!?

[Hook]
Looking for rappers who wanna battle
Don't seem to understand that I'm just that bad
The underground rapper who's wrecking
Whatever ya want yo, whatever ya like

[Killasha]
Holocaust, rap javelin toss Killasha's the boss
I take what's yours, pour poison in your pores
I'm down for the cause my nigga, not "because"
My soul wasn't made to be lost, stop for the pause
I play 48 minutes hard without the calls
Slicin elbows through ya jaw, need I say more?
Facinated with 44s and foul whores
Large gram cookups, and the ill drug scores
My captivating verses, that'll open all doors
I soar like a condor ready for war, fuck the law!
[Sample: distorted] "raindrops on the ground"

[Hook]

[Jus Allah]
Ominous leave your brain matter painted on ya Stainmaster
Game of Death motherfucker we draft ya, semi-autograph ya
Keepin L's lit, sendin pellets through helmets
Shells hit, you and the fag you share a cell with
Takin niggas out their element, rhyme fighters
Divine writers, time travellers, Sliders
Pale niggas act jail lifers
Who tell the active nail biters with the 12s in thier diapers
Shoes never walk nor land, explore land
I expose my scrolls and code it in Fortran
Bullets graze ya wig kid, brushes with death
I let the iron clutch grip the bones in ya flesh
Playin on ya wrist like strings on a violin
Dyin in a blood pool wrestlin Leviathan
Fuckin wit Gods, Jedi Mind Tricks
Ya'll suckas like niggas born without dicks

[Scratches till end][Hook: Block McCloud]

When you're falling into this tune
It's like you're crawling into your tomb
Deadliest of melodies, deadliest of melodies
Once the wraths get a hold of your soul
It's like you're trapped and there's no way to go
Deadliest of melodies, deadliest of melodies

[Verse 1: Jus Allah]

I don't have the thought to care
It's off, it's my cross to bare
Lost the cross I used to wear, I am cost aware
Partnership with darkness, we're an awesome pair
Sought position, wall facing office chair
In the depths of hell, death for sell
With blood that propels from the cells
And every L is extra L
It's hot here, hear the sears from the dropped tears
Its an opera to the ears, of gospel fears
Hot careers, grotesque, slow deaths
Here is where I am nobelist and oversexed
It's a whole mess of loneliness, no regrets
Unholiness corrosive mental rolodex
I know uncertainty, personally
Murder uncourteously, mercilessly
Sole safe haven, open up my swollen heart
The hole greater than the sum of its broken parts

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]

I'm your worst nightmare
The reversal of Christ here
The only thing you seeing is the shadow and knife glare
Me, I ain't the type of motherfucker to fight fair
Pistol grip pump, chainsaw and a pipe here
Y'all are pussy watered down like a light beer
I don't run from it, I embrace it, I like fear
Texas-Chainsaw Massacre I invite fear
Call me Leatherface motherfucker I'm right here
Call me any other person that's an evil killer
Pazienza Pontius Pilate call me Jesus killer
Call me Richard Ramirez because he spill venom
I'm Mark David Chapman before he killed Lennon
I was studying my lessons when the Earth was seedless
You're like Judas Iscariot when he murdered Jesus
The way my operation work is like a surgeon's thesis
I'll drink the period blood of a fucking virgin priestess

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Demoz]

Maserati Mazi, it's the D.E.M.O.Z
Nah homie you can't control me
I pop slowly, thinking you know me
Slow, phoney niggas, is starring hard, like I'm looking familiar
If you don't owe me, I ain't looking to kill ya
Still it smell too funny
The plot thicken, a lot of you die snitching
Ligaments missing, illiterate niggas die hissing
Why would I wana trade my soul for your riches and lose to the devil?
I never break the rules of the ghetto
From borough to borough, I rep the most thoroughest city, Philly
The livest rhymers, pay homage cuz I'm a survivor
You lying - DEMOZ
Either you love me or hate me, hug me or snake me
Lately I been behaving like I ain't got a baby
Maybe it's the way my lady treat me
Crazy, shady thoughts
Run through my head by the minute but still I play my part
Peace to every piece of piece of shit
My piece of work is not a piece of nothing
Fronting if I'm bringing peace to Earth

[Hook]
