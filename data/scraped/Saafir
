[Ras Kass]
What, yeah, yeah
Black John McClane, Harold the Menace, and the Waterproof
With my nigga Bud'da, on the track
Golden State Warriors..
Eatin every rapper on the plate
Huh, feel me

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
I got three-oh-fo's in three-one-oh
On section eight, with multiple one-eighty-sevens
Sport a Marilyn Manson t-shirt when I die and go to heaven
Smoke a beady, scrape my lungs, smoke the resin
Remember the name Ras Kass-ciano
Get to clownin y'all punk bitches, cause I'm a Mac, like Ronald
I make Mac make money, and mack murder wack rappers
My Makaveli verse Bomb First, the Mac-11'll gat cha
When I get at cha, the situation tenses
Fatality (Toasty!) before you ever reach your senses
Got so-called riders, crashing into brick fences
Like my name was Al Fayed so you die, like that white princess
If you lookin for sympathy, you better look
Between R and T, in the fucking dictionary
See the object of the game is to win, stack some ends, sippin Henn'
Whip a Benz and leave it to your next of kin

Chorus: repeat 2X

[RK] Pick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it
[GS] Golden State, number one with a bullet
[XZ] It's three card molly
[RK] Will they ever stop?
[XZ] Probably not
[SN] Pull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop

[Verse 2: Saafir the Saucee Nomad]
The un-edited medic, on the cut, with a degree in metaphysics
A doctor, with a lot of patients/patience
And perseverance -- flows like an ocean liner
That sails/sales like a clearance, I'm bilingual
Fly like a flamingo, I'm a pitcha, everything I freak
I eat like Al Pacino, you don't like me baby
You ain't happy, you need some Ecstasy
Now you in my properties, but you have to pay my equity
For the lowest point in my character
I'll reach the highest place in the house when I rock
Like the Qu'ran, fuse hot, fluid with flavor like buillion cube
Been this way since I was fourteen
And like this I been runnin shit without the use of Sportscreme
Rippin up tracks like immigrant Chinese, peep the game I lay
I'm grim, I brim over my brow when I rip
Never write rhymes with slim fingertips
Each syllable you choose to use is light as a flower
Keep tryin to go gold
But all you're gettin is a golden shower

Chorus

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Look, now if it wasn't for the West
These rap niggas wouldn't need a vest around they chest
Keep bustin about where you rest, and what you own, and what you drive
So the day some niggas come for you I'm really not surprised
Mr. Black Bruce Willis, please don't kill us
I show mercy like Kevorkian, like a scorpion
We sting you from behind and put it in you, so meet me at the venue
Put you on the spot to put you on the menu
Fricasseed emcee, we be the ones that keep the pussy hot
Xzibit livin life, like a bull inside a china shop
Strippin everything, see you ain't even got a dime to drop
Go ahead and call the cops, you ain't said nathin
Jerry Spring-you out the studio, then Suge Knight you
To the parkin lot, niggas ain't ready for all this heat we got
Picture yourself crushin Xzibit with your tough talk
That's like Christopher Reeves doing the crip walk

Chorus[Hook x2: Lauryn Hill]
Oh-oh-oh I'm coolin' with my niggas on the Wake up Show-oh-oh
We kick a little something for the radio-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Nas]
Check it, bust it
Tune it up it's the corrupt novelist, Nas
Involved in this liveness radio waves
Slaves thrive inside of this
Wake Up Show flow, hip-hop's alarm clock, the bomb spot
Mellow with ganja, that makes my eyes turn yellow
Seat reclined on my leather sofa
However close to Na- be I'm Joe Quicks
King Tech I could just see 'em on the one and two son
My blunted crew pour the rum
92.3, number one in the slum
Representin' DJ's
Sway's the host, see police the most
What a collaboration see I'm comatose
No pork just knowledge and I'm born once more
It's the beat that blesses the street deep in the 9-4

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Hip-hops last prophet henceforth in excistence
The 92.3 megahertz will exert radio waves
The slaves for a phenomenal distance
Electrons appear to slice through jeeps that you can hear some
Slum that it will chunk consider it will numb your eardrum
Kid, you sleepin' like a Latter Day Saint
With Sway & King Tech gon' wake you up on a saturday
9 to 12 verbal junkies overdose
And Joe Quicks will get you fixed to the mix
And then I'm ghost win

[Verse 3: Prince Poetry]
In your sleep I slap you with a lethal doses of medicine
So Wake Up with Organizin' the bretherin
King Tech, Joe Quiks better than your last fix
Severing wackness with Sway the host dumps a fat mix
Baby doll is frontin' so saturday night's open
Hoppin' on the one on one, times scope
And 92.3 degree is chokin' on chocolate
And from thou smokin' Prince Po'
Blows up from LA to Lobokin and I'm out

[Verse 4: Ras Kass]
Yo it's the Wake Up Show
My genetic make up take up
One hundred and thirty pounds of beef
But my lyrics shake up, like January 17th
Cause all the 16th MC's fossils
Protect ya neck and wear a bulletproof vest on ya tonsils
Amateurs bandage ya cornea
Cause you don't wanna see California
Get C-arson and spittin arsenic
With Sway Tech and Joe Quicks on the mix
Spinal meningitis ain't as stiff as the riff
Of Ras Kass, styles last like Jason crackers with whips
Come equipped you're losin' your paraphernalia
I'm a hip hop apostle
Sing in the gospel like Mehailja, Jackson
It's saturday nine until the break of dawn
Put cocaine on my tongue
You got crack now rock on *echo*

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Dred Scott]
Saturday night get live set it off
Right swing with my peeps
King Tech yo pass the mic and turn her up
Yeahyeahyeah it's peen kablow Dred Scott it's
Nine o clock, time for the Wake Up Show
To the breaker you think I'mma say dawn
But I say, day, cause it rhymes with Sway
My word is bond I'm on the scene
Plottin out the mainstream doin
Them right, with Joe Quicks on the mix
Late in the night so tune in
Cause the crew don't sleep
Boomin in ya Jeep on 92.3

[Verse 6: Shyheim]
It's 9 o'clock PM, 92.3 the Beat begins
To rock hip-hop non-stop, you know who got the props
In L.A. on saturdays, Tech and Sway no doubt

[Verse 7: ??]
Set your clocks for the unorthodox hip-hop that drops
Nine to midnight King Tech and Sway yo those kids is tight
In the mix with Joe Quicks the verbs spit verses
With the purpose of droppin curses like a triple six
Fat snares and dirty kicks to get ya open
From Watts to Oakland it's that raw {shit} that start provokin
Smokin, word's precise like a laser, cross roads in the Wake Up Show
We'll get your party shakin like a pager on silent mode, yeahha
Nine to twelve saturday night fool, peep the episode

[Verse 8: Saafir]
Wake Up, Show, and you can tell
I'm not spittin it in no muffled style
No silent screams just weddings, rings
To swings and Sway Techs King, Tech-
-nique and I'm building in a little agility from Joe Quicks
Hey Jay-Z in the eyes
It's seen only on the bottom of water risin
We're takin groups
Put it on 92.3 while your beatin boops, oops
I mean coops bumpin in to mission on the twine
Swoop saturday between nine and twelve I'm delvin
We're well tuned in to the pattern of the year
Here on 92.3 times me
Bo junks young ricks are bolders
That are only soldiers are connected to Wake Up Show
Ya right

[Hook][Saafir:]
You have, scars in your mask like Seal
That ain't for real
We'll have to fix that, yo nigga, sit back

[Xzibit:]
Your flow remind me of a nigga that I just don't feel
Same style and delivery
Might as well have his grill
Pass the scapel, the alcohol, clamps
25 hundred get you style enhanced
It's like...

[Saafir:]
This, mask right here will lift your grill
It'll put height in your mack
Don't take to much off
If you want a nose like Michael Jackson

[Xzibit:]
If you want it done right, nigga come see this
Maybe even send your bitch
We can fix them tits
From a C-cup to a double D-cup
Make them big shits, doctor lick 'em, yeah

[Saafir:]
I like to, axe em, jack em for their financial
Need a facial, I'll change the skin tone to interracial
After I'm done, you might have a little pouch though
Nothin' my scaple can't fix
What kind of face you want
(I want the kind that make me look like I can rhyme)
It'll cost you
(But I can find the skrilla, if I can have that nigga face named Saafir!)
That's imposterous, plus I never cloned a microphone
What type of shit you on, I hope you got insurance
Before I sit you on my gurney
And lead you to an anesthetic breather
If your not broke, I'll save your face like dope and make it right
Casue being fake ain't tight
You need plastic surgery

[Hook:]
I hear the same ole rhymes, the same ole style
(It seems you need plastic surgery) x5

[Xzibit:]
I'm located, at, the bottom of the black list
I like to malpractice, complicate a surgery
Intoxicated, smoke cigarettes, drop ashes in your open gases
Feel the utensil, knife is dull like a pencil
And what?
When a nigga play pussy, get fucked
Without a kiss or a hug, I'm like contaminated blood
Transfused from a junkie
With the heroin jones, I reconstruct the bones
Of all hip hop clones

[Ras Kass:]
I date fat girls that weigh 215
With low self esteem, cause it's easier to get the pussy
I'm performing vinyl liposuctions
(Fat MC?)
Phat production, motherfuckin' facial reconstruction
Needles injected 33 RPM of anesthetic for actors who require cosmetic
Sex changes from bitch niggas to rah-rah niggas
The only cure for sick lyrics is to implant a hit gimmick

[Saafir:]
This shit is full blown, you better head to the clinic
After Captain Save-A-Ho, we had the sex lieutenant
Operate get straight, we here to separate the fake from the classic
Niggas get blasted if they plastic

[Hook]

[Ras Kass:]
I'm like Dougie Howser M.D with a desert eagle
Criminal Genius
Operation, seperatin' them siamese twins hangin' beneath them niggas' penis
Take it to your face like a skin graft
Rappers, I specialize in talent transplants
You want fat lips nurse get the collagen
And ten tons of stomach pumps from all the cum you and Richard Gere be
Swallowin'
Now followin' ask Vanna to buy you vowels
So you can see I, aye, E-Swift, oh, you know why
We remain uncontested to the contender, we can
Million Man March all the way to December
January, Feburary 28th

[Saafir:]
I never wash my hands
The only rubber gloves I wear is on my dick
But I'll split you quick
Got hands like Jackie Chan, the way I switch my wrists and
I make ya sick, but I'm a doctor, don't trip
Hopefully, in surgery, I won't slip
On a tile that file and twist ya lips
Like Gomer Pyle
Prescriptions I'm over-ripe
For the ones thats overbitin' on dental records
Bitin', to God, send your blessings
I'll put your mask on, fast like Ramadan
Mix them bitches like half Lola Falana, half blonde in the paper, they named me
A Large Professor, a Mad Scientist, with a long line of clients
(BITCH! GET OUT OF MY OFFICE)
You don't have an appointment or an application
For me to attack your face in my practice
Never lackin' when I'm inserting these plastic patches
Seems like you need plastic surgeryIntro:
Huh yeah yeah. Saafir in the house youknowhatI'msayin'? Layin' it down with
My nigga Sonnie Black. About to spit this shit to you. You might be on this
Motherfucker man. You know?

Saafir:
Since the death of the first two icons I be wonderin'
Who's gonna be the next to plummet in the dirt
Somebody is puttin' in major work
And drop the line of these top the line rhymer you know who was the first
And the second MC
The shit temps me
To keep practicing my aim at the shooting range
And keep my vest
In close range to my chest
Say a prayer to the game
Cause she won't be the same after this
I heard they
Who is they?
I don't know
But you know what they say
Don't believe it till you see it
But now I peep the Ebony special Big Daddy Dane or Super Nat
Death's comin' three and the shit is startin' to worry me (why?)
Cause this shit got to be connected to a much deeper plot
Maybe the government is fillin' it
Since they see them taxes of these millionaire black men rappin'
Imagin' if they got fed up and attached a contract
To touch these pathetic lips
Believe me
It would be called

Hook:
The Hit List
But it never happens to you if you're hitless
So you better stay sharp in you mental fitness
And always holla at your follies about business
What is this? The Hit List

Saafir:
The newspapers read
"De La Soul Is Dead"
The Stakes Is Higher than Hell fire
Shocking news travels like a live wire
To the Mississippi connect
Brought in from a club bathroom
Bartender slipped him a Mickey
Everybody in hip hop is trigger itchy
One of the Pharcyde got smoked in a hotel in Perkipsey
Upstate with no backin' I'm packin' heat
Like an immigrant work Nike factory
I feel like somebody is watchin' me
I got eyes in the back of my head and under my balls
Cassette from outside bathroom door stall
Watchin' my back without a pause
Scarface in Houston tryin' not to catch a bullet scar
Ridin' to the studio in bulletproof cars
ATF had a shootout ? wait with FaceMob
A cashier worker and a grocery bagger was tagged up
Body bagged up
Pedestrians meeting the concrete
Gettin' faces and body parts scrapped up
Face Mob swervin' through as they may ? (screeching)

Hook

Sonnie Black:
What is this the Hit List
The Hit List some sick shit over glove shit
Mr. Sonnie Black the fly ass tracks jack
You slippin' like bait on a fishing rod
I'm tryin' to manipulate your fate
I'm tryin' to get you God
Cause you tailored my made me good and plenty
Your soldiers turned GI Jane more (Moore) than Demi
Keep your hustle on kinko
God got blessings to give me

Saafir:
On Remy and a night chair
Spit my plot to my partners and hoes sittin' around in nightwear
Crackin' a window a slight air
A nigga feel twisted
The story
The Hit List[Verse One]
I was lyrically hip hop's top five
Before two of my niggas died
Syntax and deep impact Bruce Willis couldn't survive
A strange death, since niggas wasn't loud
I'm throwin' monitors offstage
Cause Rakim said move the crowd
I'm one year older, ten times more determined, partner
A hairy situation like Chaka fuckin' Chewbacca
Connect the dots, murder by design
Shit on your intellect, and fertilize your mind
Pull out the gauge and we can face off like Nicolas Cage
Battle for the second coming of Christ and see whose soul gets saved
One might be your girl so don't trust her
I'll tell her like Usher
Girl I'll make you wanna leave the clown you with
Start a new relationship
Make the bitch take the dick
She ate the dick too, though, that's Mr. mafioso dulo
We bustin' caps at your culo....

[Saafir]
Waterproof, baby. Know what I'm sayin? That means we can't be wet

[Sample]
(The waterproof MC, you ain't wettin' me
You need to stop rappin' and start robbin' banks like Steady B)

[Verse Two]
My style is sex and violence
Vocabulary and science
In an uneasy alliance
Let's toast the bread like a plugged up appliance
(I'll drink to that!)
Remy on the rocks, the real is-stated eventually, son
Reverse the purdy props to prop-perty like, Century 21
I want the mansion and the yacht
And all the shit them rich wack rappers got
(Then the ultimatum was read)
Like every MC woke up with a thouroughbred horsehead in their bed
In other words, teflon top with kevlar nuts
The closest I've ever been to ass was cigarette butts
I'm nice, that's probably why I don't be fuckin' with Sprite
Cause thirst is nothin', image is everything on the mic
These days, these DJs get paid under the table
Pay the most popular producer on the most popular label
Pay for full page ads in the most popular magazine
Now you got the most popular new artist
Guaranteed the air we breathe is thin, better tell her
Then I'mma choke the bitch out at 11:59, reveal the real Cinderella
(AAAAAAHH!) When two hydrogens reach my oxygen atom
You can't gat 'em or get at 'em
Anatomically designed to be solar, fuck the rap star
When I die I want niggas doin drive-by's with my ashes in the car
R-A-S, H2O liquifyin' your assets
Repo your flow even in (prepo letho?)
Straight outta Aruba, lampin' with my boo from Bermuda
Lickin' rugers in Cuba, blowin' niggas out the frame
With brass knuckles and a tuba, my new maneuver is scuba
360 degrees of revenge like Montezuma

*more scratching*
[Saafir]
Waterproof...know what I'm sayin?
It's like this man....
Know what I'm sayin?
Muthafuckas really gotta like reach within themselves
And pull your spirit out your mouth...
Knowmsayin? But now it's all good cause I'm in
Relation with the truth!
You gonna have to really be yourself potna
Look Me in the retina

[Verse Three]
When it's my time to shine, the whole world is goin' blind
From the sheisty side of town where a nickel cost a dime
Niggas is (Boston?), black brothas is bastards
The bubble break bread and give a nigga space like NASA
I catch red-eye flights to rock mics
Spent too many drunk nights fuckin' gold diggers and dikes
Same shit, different toilet though
Concentrated to blow
I moonwalk across hot coals on my tippy toes for the flow
Stay low key like midget doorknobs
Stay above the law like Judge Judy giving blow jobs
Satisfaction, three out of four Braxtons
Especially Toni
Fuck affirmative action
Cause Anglo-saxon factions is packin' Mack-10s
Trainin' for helter skelter when the race war begin
Stay true to the game, but the game ain't true to the MC
Where niggas is bootleggin' Makaveli 2 and 3

[Saafir]
Real game...waterproof..with the name, man. Listen to the name, man
Waterproof don't have no muthafuckin (?) Junction, with nothin. Ain't no

It's best you let me wander or I'll taunt

The leaf-a-rap a dope shit, antique
Rope kits for the hang time, a
Heinous crime
Cause I drain his mind. Open it up
Oh...not
The same as mine, not the same ass
Rhyme
Nickel plated statements with nickel
Plated
Knuckle faded faces. No matter what
The Race is I hope ya cockpit got shit
I stock
Hits. Inventory glorious. I owe me this
I'm on my homies shit - the homeless
Shown
This skill is real when I attack from
The
Back I'll say a rhyme then pull your
Spinal
Cord from your torso, more so or
Better
Yet more or less it's not an option
I'm coppin'
A plea seizing a shop and hopin' a
Cop's
A blow of the past. If not, I'll be
Blowin'
His ass away. J. Groove is on the cross, I'm
The heavyweight fader of a playa
Hayta

Analysis is deep, forever on the peep
And I'm
The best, the crest of the ho shit...
Yeah
You can't manifest destiny unless it's
Me
Oh, you don't approve of my moves
But I'm not
Starvin' for jargon, so save it
My libido is
The needle to the wax, I like to tax in
Gazebos, surviving like a mac king
Clever
Never lacking when I'm stacking
Endeavors
I try and try to tell fools, that I've been
Through hell and my tools ain't the same
As yours. Coors Light that's what
They're
Drinkin', must be I'm wrong yours is
Right
That's why you're sinkin' in your own
Sight
Nose is in my business, witnessin'
Your
Own fate, drownin' in your own lake
Of hate
But I don't see no abstinent crabs in it
Perverse perpin' after the salt I can
Hear the rehearsal of a serpent
Urgent
Cause you don't use your head when
You
Shed skin - dead end...for a playa
Hayta

Charades, are played but I keep
Getting it in
Large amounts because I be doin'
These Hoogies' charge account like a banker
I'm patient and I be waiting like an
Anchor
To spank her. Then I get the softy
Sanka
Coffee drinkin' breath stinkin'
Cheddar cheese
Eatin' wheat germ, checker board
Pants
Wearin' can't dance, and you're starin' in
My grill. But you had a steak
A nervous
Twitch and you're a badly fake and I
Heard
His bitch is gettin' around like 2Pac
Servin' niggas two at a time like she
Got
Two cocks. New blocks she be conquering
Zip codes, I rip ho's that be lappin' up
Mark ass lames then charge it to the
Game. So he next time you step to
Me
Like a defense attorney, Ha!...I'll
Fade ya
Cause you're a playa hayta

From a real playa ' cause I play the

And start whuppin' your ass. It's the rap game killa masta
Kid who has a pool room with business and non-stop blastin' shit
Tore cagenin' in what your lungs' incased in
No comic book animation, just assassination
All you fake-ass nigs would kill a fasination
Cosmetic niggas would feel this villain plastic facement
Call me Father Red, but for you, you think I'mma get a higher rankin'?
You fly cats is chickens, you featherless
While you tryin' to get millions, I'm trainin' as a United States terrorist!
Drombin' these bomb before your planes get off the ground
Blowin' out the pilot and all flames that sound the same
Y'all niggas is B-12 bumped up wit' a pound of fame
I'm thirty-two degrees below freezin' in the game
But some of you love, gettin' crossed in the pair of pliars

That classic hot shit, Jag in garage shit
You braggin', ain't got shit. Complainin' 'bout my shit
PaChino's above average. Product of a mixed marriage
I'm violent, you better be silent like the 'J' in spanish
Immacurate, saw moons and stars and flames in back of it
Rap past the untalented. Dangerous, haters try to silence it
Couldn't accomplish it. I'm bringin' the ruckus, I promise it
My skills are polished it. 'You wack, nigga.' I'm wack's opposite
Drama's been poision pen venom bent up inside of your brain
My lyrical syringes for dope fiends to take my name in vein
Physical frame, the heron Frankie Lyman over-dosed on
I'm strong, I make you look weaker than Usher wit' no shirt on
I still attack tracks like two young-G raps
This industry's ill, it's a bunch of hyperchondriachs
And I'mma smack ya face off ya face for bitin' rhymes
Like I've more skills than you niggas if you practiced for three lifetimes
Lyrical hangtime. You wacker. Jump in the time machine
And soft the vagina that half of these rappas came out of

Sick tales from the male Mary Magdaline. Chino's so raveshing
You couldn't double X-L if you was the magazine
The black Nazerine, takin' charism. The hell in the battle
You mix with sugar and shit spice, you're not add ho!
You're gettin' sex pay-back from my lyrical syntex
Nigga, ya index finga wouldn't trigga a bottle of Windex
And I forgot more lyrics then you will ever write. Tight wild like
Eddie Murphey gettin' caught with that transvestite on that night
You cats might get put to sleep like pills I be nodding on
Foldin' niggas' Averexes while they still got 'em on!
Buildin' underground side holes with lights dimmer than the ones in
Biggie Smalls's hallways. Colder than a menthol lip that's
Haulin' rap in the fall. My foot deep in the ass of
Niggas that's Glock rhymin' me. I do to your future, dog
I'm savage. That word is describin' me
("Scribin' me. Scribin' me...")

[Verse 2: Saafir the Saucee Nomad]
The un-edited medic, on the cut, with a degree in metaphysics
A doctor, with a lot of patients/patience
And perseverance -- flows like an ocean liner
That sails/sales like a clearance, I'm bilingual
Fly like a flamingo, I'm a pitcha, everything I freak
I eat like Al Pacino, you don't like me baby
You ain't happy, you need some Ecstasy
Now you in my properties, but you have to pay my equity
For the lowest point in my character
I'll reach the highest place in the house when I rock
Like the Qu'ran, fuse hot, fluid with flavor like buillion cube
Been this way since I was fourteen
And like this I been runnin shit without the use of Sportscreme
Rippin up tracks like immigrant Chinese, peep the game I lay
I'm grim, I brim over my brow when I rip
Never write rhymes with slim fingertips
Each syllable you choose to use is light as a flower
Keep tryin to go gold
But all you're gettin is a golden shower

Chorus

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Look, now if it wasn't for the West
These rap niggas wouldn't need a vest around they chest
Keep bustin about where you rest, and what you own, and what you drive
So the day some niggas come for you I'm really not surprised
Mr. Black Bruce Willis, please don't kill us
I show mercy like Kevorkian, like a scorpion
We sting you from behind and put it in you, so meet me at the venue
Put you on the spot to put you on the menu
Fricasseed emcee, we be the ones that keep the pussy hot
Xzibit livin life, like a bull inside a china shop
Strippin everything, see you ain't even got a dime to drop
Go ahead and call the cops, you ain't said nathin
Jerry Spring-you out the studio, then Suge Knight you
To the parkin lot, niggas ain't ready for all this heat we got
Picture yourself crushin Xzibit with your tough talk
That's like Christopher Reeves doing the crip walk

Boxcar sessionist black magic is
The magnet breakin' 'em down to
Micro fragments. I might go dragnet
Shoot Joe on Friday if I miss I'll
Get your one day won't forget officer
Monday I'm good with gun play I get
Wreck check the boss don't remove
Your firing pin punk cause I get
Off - comes the safety freak a clip
Or get plugged with the four - 5th
Off my niggas hip best believe the
Triggers gettin' gripped we stroll
The back doors to the railroad is
Where we go when we flow hell
Knows
And elbows are shot thrown don't
Blink
An eye gets ruff when I flex the
Ingrim chrome don't even try it
I'm the arsonist cause I'll burn you
With the slug I'm funky plus I got
Carpet fresh in my rug tug a war and
Get dug six feet under floor plans are
Banned
Combat hand to hand cowards clocks
Is gettin' cleaned with detergent if
You want to freak a funky flow we
Can splurge it so I'll perk like an
Expert I'll send a flow that'll kill
Bet I won't break a sweat in a
Battle drill

Start ya engines but you look
Exhausted like carbon monoxide
I'm sly
Like a foxeye see me I'll jack you
For your bundle G I'll be lurking
In the rear smirking when you're
Crumbling the hobo junction is
Function is
To freak the lyrical smoke a
Blunt to the grill till we reach
The spiritual world then get wit ya
Girl dip her like a tea bag up it
Another notch for the flea bag king
Queens be freaky fiends don't sleep
And
Fall think the cocks the bomb but like
Tom you'll get brokawf sheer energy
So u know I be stockin' rear entities
Eatin' linto beans and I do reek when
I speak true who's this ya girl nice
To freak you let me freak a clip slip
One
In the chamber click clak that's the
Sound of the gat right before the jack
Comes true I thought you knew
That's ya cue oh! But you're a hero
Muscles kinda swollen but you ain't
Real you wouldn't strike if we was
Bowlin' to the left march arch ya
Back the impact is fat when I tag a
Grill
With a battle drill

The nomadic attic dweller never
On the cheddar cheese grease down
The plank yankin' mentals clean
Slates
Are freaked treats for the tricks like
A magician doin' halftucks genies and
Arabian's chest be cavin' in and I be
In the rubbish rubbin' this like Aladdin
Through obstacles my saliva be
Liva than stoppin' flows in they tracks
Cuttin' the tape it's nutthin' to debate
Fate tells me this is the last grape
To be cracked rippin' the plaque
Between the gums hums this lift ya
Lip a little more to the chef's recipe
For flavor they be beggin' me to stop
The torturing but forth I bring
A subconscience which means no conscienceness
On this effort no mercy on a groove
No
Space to move check mate it's

Released I'm down count it's a
Lifestyle for the regular
No five. O you may catch me in some
Old British Knights
Some mark fives no cellular hobo
Brova's are ready to go
Concentrate fundamentals I extend
My defense give my man the ric some
Breathin' room fresh air see sparks
As he strikes the bounce
Is on 'cuz brova's got runnyn' pass
Game the aim is for me to rip
Shit up I like nut in ya cup I don't give
A motherfuckin' fuck
Wit style it's the bignose the pro-file is
Ta rip brova's be pullin'
Cards it's the bignose (I'm out)A freak of nature makes a nigga wanna mate ya
With the kind of vagina that makes ones part from paper
You make my chest warm
I'm about to be reborn
Wrap your form around me
You astound me
The way you mount me
Wait, let me burn a fatty
So I can feel the fluid when you do it
Call me daddy
Add me to your shit list
Uh-huh
Feel the punishment
You ask me to twist you like taffy
It's from when it's bent
Yolkin', hot water soakin'
Ease up the throbbin'
I know I got your loins
Knockin' coins
Give me your pockets
I take necklaces, bracelets, earrings and lockets
It's OK to pay me
Skills and be ridden thrills
Run concurrent with currency
Be earnin' me a livin'
(Like a super ho)
But I'm super though
Without the leotards, it's the man of steel for real
Can you conceive me?
If you don't believe me, take a sample
You can freak me
Take your time, critique me
I wanna feel every nook and cranny in your fanny
Right after your annual
Man, me I'm manual
I leap freaks like a frog
Don't rewind it
So much space behind my face
Can you find it?
I'm broad minded

Chorus: Shock G

I'm major deep, deeper than deep
But when it comes to bumpin freaks
(I'm broad minded) I'm broad minded
I'm real nasty, see if you can outlast me
When I bump a freak
(I'm broad minded) I'm broad minded

In my younger summers
My moods used to spook me
I used to wonder the smell of Janet Jackson's booty
Ooooo weeee
On good times, but I took what I could find
Like the time I was in first grade, in class with Kool-Aid
I got bored and explored this young female
We'll sprung on the details
We fell in the closet
Down came my pants
Up like a clown in my stance
When I hit the stickiness
I fell into a trance
It was bent
I've been a fool every since
In pools and garages, on the roof, behind the fence
I'll be a freak apostle
After I take my middle fingers to my nostrils
Whatever the case is to the facial
Cause in my mind, I belong in my files
So mental pictures, when I sit and split ya doggystyle
You tell me "take it easy"
Baby it's been a while
Here I come touching down in your vertical smile
Hers is wild
Hot but mild like crystal hot sauce
You make me trickle
Nickels got tossed, on both sides was a winner
Heads and tails for dinner
Forgive this sinner
I got a jones for them bones
It wasn't planned
Though God timed it
You can ask D'Angelo
I'm broad minded

Chorus (2X)

You got me ready to touch the moon, here's my mushroom
I'm reading your body language
I'm ready to publish the puttin of...
Stroke of genius from a penis
That's touched everything chocolate to tapioca
I wanna watch you choke up and giggle
And wipe the spittle from your nipples a little
Uh-huh just a little
And drool a jewel until I hit a mental wreckage
The only way to identify you when I'm done
Dental records
Like this one
Fear me not
Got everything from Miracle Whip to spiritual dick
Drippin wet
Let me bite your hands on my chinny chin chin
Win a trip to buy a fit to tie your loose ends
Stay a while child
I got toys
But you got to wind it
I'm broad minded

Chorus (2X)

Yeah, big shout out to Shock G for these broad minded tracks
No doubt
Hobo Junction soldier
Bumpin these freaks in a broad minded state
Lettin you know for the nine six straight
SidewaysWe went all around the planet, pitchin', and no one hit it
I'm the first batter up Ahmad -- well then come widdit
All around the planet, pitchin', and no one hit it
I'm the first batter up Ahmad -- well then come widdit

[Verse One: Ahmad]
Well it's the niggerole that caught Foot Lock
Cause the vibe keeps voxed in funk, makes you rock to the side
Gave it all I had, just to have what I got
Niggas tryin to be bad, and they mad cuz they not
Gonna defeat the rapper who got three ways to sack a
Quarterback I slaughter wack MCs with ease
These nuts what you get and a busted lip
What you have when you come at me with buster shit
All that graf given driven so I musta hit
Bought a Jag, chillin on the Shore just to dip
Get it right, cause I get it, night in and night out
I'm butter, covering up wack MCs like Wite-Out
Don't doubt it that they dissed me OK rap is overrated
Who hate it that a nigga from the West blew up and made it
And I'd braid it if I had it but for now I keep it balded
Niggas tryin' to touch to me better stop before they get scalded
I'm hot, like a skillet and grits, crush you to bits
When I look over the room, and then lower the boom, and
Think that they can defeat the man that can't be beat
I do the breaststroke, clown, while you drown in three feet
Beep beep like robots on Buck Rogers plus I bust
25th century rhymes so you decline
To battle any time, had skills since I was nine
Dope lines the only weapon that I cock, I never drop
I stop clones cuz biting's never condoned
From the Westside 4th Avenue crew Jones

[Hook]
We went all around the planet, pitchin', and no one hit it
I'm the second batter Ras Kass -- well then come widdit
All around the planet, pitchin', and no one hit it
I'm the second... nah forget it

[Verse Two: Ras Kass]
My foramen magnum got 357 calibers
To bust a sucker's melon like Gallagher
Body chemistry consists of Hennessey, toxic melanin
With an adamantium skeleton like Wolverine
Child, my heart pumps kerosene
Son I spit butane, burn any bastard you name till I die
And even when I'm maggots, I'mma still be fly
Perpetrator, you're not the one
Your name's not Anfernee Hardaway
I'm like a wolf with blood dripping down the fangs
My techniques foul enough to shoot the flagrant technical
I be comin' off the head rougher then ribbed tip receptacles
Expect the exceptional syllables to be the next man's umbilical cord
Catch distortion, ras cancels kids like abortions
Sendin niggas to hip hop hell, ock
Eternal damnation through writers block
I rock over the results of Reeboks and sands
Stand ill, forget a live band, just my mouth and hand
And even man wasn't prehensile
I'd still find ways to grip mikes, hold my tip when I piss
And pick off pubic lice
Cause see, I always been nice but first brothers slept
Now I've come back twice like Christ to resurrect the West
Check

[Hook]
We went all around the planet, pitchin', and no one hit it
I'm the third batter up, Saafir -- well then come widdit
All around the planet, pitchin', and no one hit it
I'm the third batter Saafir -- well then come widdit

Verse Three: Saafir the Saucee Nomad
Some spit it, but my saliva is liver
Spit stenches drenches been intricated, flow braggarts
Act cynic thyroid thermia hypodermic
How I earn it squeezing juices, one-hundred
Percent concentrated on easing nooses around the necks
Of tricks, probably won't get this
Thick hottie body carberuator
I'm the un-priggish well cat led bredded-well ill verse my
Will is ho gung for the fortune
Can spell hearse with the same Addams Family apple grapple hook
Crooked, flier I fly crooked
For the crew, Hobo Junction, in a few I'll plan
Father soldier and when they're older, I'll teach them of
Killings of confidence and to be omnipotent with content
Accomplishment for gladiation I'm done
With training of explaining as the crates in plan B
Plan the attack, instructs me to hit the yak
I'm here, on purpose
The Nomadic, addict, merchant

[Hook]
We went all around the planet, pitchin', and no one hit it
Well then come widdit
All around the planet, pitchin', and no one hit it
Well then come widdit[Hook: Shock G]
Don't be afraid to let a brother funk with you
Would you let a nucka doo woo you (x3)
Don't be afraid to let a brother funk with you
Yeah, would you let me doo woo you

[Shock G]
Yo, I've got plenty of love
But I got no love for anybody trying to keep me down
I got a lot of love for all the ones who got my back
But not the monkey that's riding on it
They ride to hear a brother say 'shaggalackfragganack'
You know what I mean ... nothing
But like an FOI I can't tell a lie
I get too much juice when you turn me loose
And like fruit from a tree's got vitamin C
I'm from the Darkside and I'm fortified
I got the kind of vitamins to creep beneath your skin
That's why you're so afraid to let me in
I'll take you to a whole 'nother level
You know I got the Main Ingredient
So just keep on fronting
Gotta, gotta, gotta keep on fronting - keep on, keep on
Keep on running your mouth and pumping the lies
So I'm punking you out
Invest in all the young, funky minds of today
Infesting all the young, funky minds with the FADES:
Falsely Acquired Diluted Education Syndrome
That's why I need a Bodyhat
To block all the ooey-gooey brainwashed nuts with the bag
Make them drip back up the shaft of the system
Uh-huh, I just dissed them

[Bridge: Shock G]
You make me out to be the devil
Afraid that I'm a take you to a whole 'nother level
You know that I'm a creep beneath your skin

[Hook]

[Saafir]
Well, what do we have here
Sheer bliss, Saafir hears this so
We getting our grind on
Put a little tuning and your grooming
They want us to zoomer-zoom, we already zooming
Putting on my mask, gotta think fast
I'm a light sleeper so I wake last
I'm drinking out the glass but the water ain't pure
And they wonder why I don't want to do you
First of all, you're scandalous
And I'm too real so you can't handle this
Then you'll throw a fit and tell me I ain't shit
Go fatten up your lips
Or better yet go put some rhythm in your hips
I'll flip, never will I slip
On a front took her bust up
So now what? I'll tell you what:
Why don't you get a clue from within, mark
Otherwise I'm gonna creep beneath your skin

[Hook]

[Shock G]
A wing-ding ding-a-ling, listen to me sing
I like chicken wings
All living things get treated like a brother
Cause I'm a planet Earth lover
And I'm surviving, I keep striving
Alive in my blood's the God from up above-uh
I gain strength from my mother
I'm potent cause soul is what I'm toting
Style runs deep in my family tree
Yeah, that's me
See, it's gonna feel good when I run right through you
So let me do you
Open up and take a bite of me, chew me up
Try to swallow my blackness. Go on, taste it
Face it, it's fact that you're attracted to my style
But still you lie to me
You see, being afraid is the same as being shallow
So why follow the masses?
We're in the Nineties
Try to release your mind and be deep
Peep/peace

[Hook][Verse One]
I was lyrically hip hop's top five
Before two of my niggas died
Syntax and deep impact Bruce Willis couldn't survive
A strange death, since niggas wasn't loud
I'm throwin' monitors offstage
Cause Rakim said move the crowd
I'm one year older, ten times more determined, partner
A hairy situation like Chaka fuckin' Chewbacca
Connect the dots, murder by design
Shit on your intellect, and fertilize your mind
Pull out the gauge and we can face off like Nicolas Cage
Battle for the second coming of Christ and see whose soul gets saved
One might be your girl so don't trust her
I'll tell her like Usher
Girl I'll make you wanna leave the clown you with
Start a new relationship
Make the bitch take the dick
She ate the dick too, though, that's Mr. mafioso dulo
We bustin' caps at your culo....

[Saafir]
Waterproof, baby. Know what I'm sayin? That means we can't be wet

[Sample]
(The waterproof MC, you ain't wettin' me
You need to stop rappin' and start robbin' banks like Steady B)

[Verse Two]
My style is sex and violence
Vocabulary and science
In an uneasy alliance
Let's toast the bread like a plugged up appliance
(I'll drink to that!)
Remy on the rocks, the real is-stated eventually, son
Reverse the purdy props to prop-perty like, Century 21
I want the mansion and the yacht
And all the shit them rich wack rappers got
(Then the ultimatum was read)
Like every MC woke up with a thouroughbred horsehead in their bed
In other words, teflon top with kevlar nuts
The closest I've ever been to ass was cigarette butts
I'm nice, that's probably why I don't be fuckin' with Sprite
Cause thirst is nothin', image is everything on the mic
These days, these DJs get paid under the table
Pay the most popular producer on the most popular label
Pay for full page ads in the most popular magazine
Now you got the most popular new artist
Guaranteed the air we breathe is thin, better tell her
Then I'mma choke the bitch out at 11:59, reveal the real Cinderella
(AAAAAAHH!) When two hydrogens reach my oxygen atom
You can't gat 'em or get at 'em
Anatomically designed to be solar, fuck the rap star
When I die I want niggas doin drive-by's with my ashes in the car
R-A-S, H2O liquifyin' your assets
Repo your flow even in (prepo letho?)
Straight outta Aruba, lampin' with my boo from Bermuda
Lickin' rugers in Cuba, blowin' niggas out the frame
With brass knuckles and a tuba, my new maneuver is scuba
360 degrees of revenge like Montezuma

*more scratching*
[Saafir]
Waterproof...know what I'm sayin?
It's like this man....
Know what I'm sayin?
Muthafuckas really gotta like reach within themselves
And pull your spirit out your mouth...
Knowmsayin? But now it's all good cause I'm in
Relation with the truth!
You gonna have to really be yourself potna
Look Me in the retina

[Verse Three]
When it's my time to shine, the whole world is goin' blind
From the sheisty side of town where a nickel cost a dime
Niggas is (Boston?), black brothas is bastards
The bubble break bread and give a nigga space like NASA
I catch red-eye flights to rock mics
Spent too many drunk nights fuckin' gold diggers and dikes
Same shit, different toilet though
Concentrated to blow
I moonwalk across hot coals on my tippy toes for the flow
Stay low key like midget doorknobs
Stay above the law like Judge Judy giving blow jobs
Satisfaction, three out of four Braxtons
Especially Toni
Fuck affirmative action
Cause Anglo-saxon factions is packin' Mack-10s
Trainin' for helter skelter when the race war begin
Stay true to the game, but the game ain't true to the MC
Where niggas is bootleggin' Makaveli 2 and 3

[Saafir]
Real game...waterproof..with the name, man. Listen to the name, man
Waterproof don't have no muthafuckin (?) Junction, with nothin. Ain't no
Image!

*scratching*[Verse 1 - Chino XL]
A pretty smile can cover up a character
Dirtier than Janet Jackson's clothes
When she played Penny on "Good Times" (right)
A chick in the hood shines
But blind to trick nigga
That has not been exposed to this mentality of mines...
(I find the one I want) If she step up
I get her open like every piece of my mail when I was locked up
Laced up stupid after I drop 'em
Then fuck every model in Q-tip videos with the same condom
(I never met a bitch) That faded me
Cus mentally and physically God was showing off when he created me
(Be afraid of me)
But stop hating me cus women are loving me, I'm sorry
That you was a virgin until your record release party (right)
Hoes won't admit this, but that's groupie's style (yeah)
I call 'em Cleopatras, they the queens of The Nile
And these trick niggas dead on 'em
Bithces looking like Barbie doll bodies with a G.I. Joe head on 'em
It's pathetic how quickly are to get naked
Probably infected, shieet! Give me the ones with good credit
Or Dead it, Admitedly I have a fetish you could be on
I like an ass so fat she can turn a boxer shorts to thongs
(Is you hot from all my songs?)
She diggin' me, Got women fingering themselves
Thinking of women fingering themselves that are thinking of me
You know what sickening me? (Yo dog express your feelings)
If Eric Bennet can get Halle Berry I deserve Vannesa Williams

It's how it goes (*3X*)
Tell 'em how it goes yo...

(Chorus)
Saafir + [Chino XL]

This is how it goes
Down in the town of West Oakland keepin' hoes soaked in

[This game will never change]
[In Jersey freaks touch concrete eight inches on cheese baby]

It'll never be
Another me, sauce see squeeze up on a ho like
"Oh shit you got to pay me!"

[Saafir Talking]
That's real talk
And you know what's that fat white man name
Ben Franklin
The bald head nigga with the glasses... feel me

[Verse 2 - Saafir]
I dead tricks in the game (what)
Baptise they eyes with the reply that I ain't fly
Trick, bitch, I'm an astronaut
With so much hot acid cock on the concrete
You gotta wear sunblock (know)
Sending these hoes like meteors (whooosh)
By 2004 you'll see me in a space suit
Paper chasin' with hoes in pursuit of my boots
Touch down on that pimp planet, floor
(Gimmie some more)
Up goes the flag made out of wigs and galore
(Take that back)
Panties are vision for male tricks on a mission to hold hoes down
Like gravity, (ha ha), Imagine me (trick)
Cus the way from ya'll I'm like years with the fly gear
And better than credit thats limitless
For breaking a bitch I'm in the mothafucking book of Guinesses
(Breakin' records) Under H.O.T
Short for: Hoold Ooooon,... Trick!
Let me switch your ?cre-day to mayday
Time to show up, ho up or blow up (blow up!)
But you know what? (what)
I gotta keep tellin' my other half
Nigga they don't know us, thou shall not hold trust
I'll pass the ass on mine, playalistically divine
No Nickelodeon shit
Ho take out your clothes and get into this here ?feronien? slick

(Chorus)

[Chino XL]
See I dont' chase these hoes
These hoes chase me, why chase the doe, yo

[Chino XL signing]
Your purse comes first your ass comes last
And I don't know how long we gon' last
But what you do with all your money baby
You bring it all home to Chi...

[Verse 3 - Saafir]
To a true P.I., the thick ?? less layer
A playa,-listic
Gangsta pulling your age and funny style ass foul
(yeah, but now)
That's it I'm a shake that trick and I'm puttin nothing else on it
I won't arrest the chest and thighs
Recognize the weapon size
When I shoot this game at your ass
Or get shot with hot shit into ya lip
Blister bitch, miss a nigga if you a plain ass coward
With a colorful name that hate players and not the game

[Chino XL]
Woop!(Latin lover lover)
Famous in art
I'm dangersous and smart
Guaranteed victory dating your wifey on the Change Of Heart
No bitches run me, I told you from the start
So many tears shed over me, don't make a scene, make an Ark
(Straight talk)
Women turnin' their beepers, cutting their phones off
I make love to their minds 'til their clothes just fall off!
I fuck Tamia as a side bed
I make chicks consider themselves widows
Whose husbands ain't even died yet (damn)
To best explain it:
Catch me in your living room gettin my hair braided
By your girl, buttnaked
Look at what having the best lines done for me
Your wifey will trade six of you for one of me
(And that's real)

(Chorus)

...Tell em how it goes down (*5X*)[Intro: DJ scratching]
Ah, here we go

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I know I'm an emotionally disturbed person
People think I'm talkin' to myself when I'm rehearsin' on the rhyme
A mass productionist
A mass production matador, pan it more to the left, there you go
Minimize the synthe-sizer wiser when I wind up for the pitch
But I don't pitch a bitch
Cause sales get derailed and towed
He owed an abundance of cash
Damn, I let it go
He was my man
I tried to trust him, but I busted him
Twice, in my trash can and I'm askin'
I don't need psychology to see
The dichotomy in me
Knew something was fishy
But I'm better than wishy washy or topsy turvy
It kinda irked me that I caught him sleepin'
Cause I try to be wide awake
But he slows it down
So I can't dilate and show that I'm bigger than that
But I also have to consider the fact that opposed to him
Not being the right peeper, I'm a light sleeper

[Hook]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
But I'm a light sleeper, I'm a light sleeper
Wake up, don't sleep
But I'm a light sleeper, I'm a light sleeper
Wake up, wake up
But I'm a light sleeper, I'm a light sleeper
Wake up, wake up
I'm a light sleeper, I'm a light sleeper

[Verse 2]
So what do it mean when I reach maturity
And still see that I'm not the mayor of my mayonnaise
The master of my milieu
At least I have a swing and a few things on my mind
It's never a good nighty night
Just a rise 'n' shine
Why's the rhyme so important?
Why do I have to be so potent and blow the microphone without chokin'?
I don't
I'm arrogant and outspoken
Mouth no token I'm just a roust about
I have a house and clout but I don't come tight
But it's routine since few fiend for true hip hop
It's a trip when I drop my style
And forget it and forget where I got it from
And how I got 'em sprung, cause I'm
Stuck on myself and I depend on my luck and wealth for health matters
So I don't explode with stress
I'll serve you an elf platter
They'll tell me that my shit is fatter than the first
But I'm a light sleepin' rapper in a hearse

[Hook with variations]

[Verse 3]
I don't wear sarongs in my songs
I diss the skirts in verses
And I used to measure my demeters with clever pentameters
But I bounced like a pogo and I'm solo with the hobos
A nocturnal colonel in a journal
I put fly kids' eyelids to rest a detour
For deep sleep when I freak beats
I snap like a defective contraceptive and my sleep
Will be light, so you'll know that I'm tight

[Hook with variations][Chino XL
Saafir]
You locked down with no bail money to get yourself loose?
Not fa' nuttin'
That's not what a thug would do
Uh-uh
I hit you girl for free and that's alright wit' 'chu?
Not fa' nuttin'!
That's not what a thug would do
Nope
Caught slippin' wit' no heat inside your bubblegoose?
Not fa' nuttin'
That's not what a thug would do
Uh-uh
Pretty skillianaire niggas about to spit it at 'chu?
Not fa' nuthin', that's somethin' that a thug'd do!

[Saafir]
Not fa' nuttin'. I'll jump out that mild-mannered frame of glasses
And start whuppin' your ass. It's the rap game killa masta
Kid who has a pool room with business and non-stop blastin' shit
Tore cagenin' in what your lungs' incased in
No comic book animation, just assassination
All you fake-ass nigs would kill a fasination
Cosmetic niggas would feel this villain plastic facement
Call me Father Red, but for you, you think I'mma get a higher rankin'?
You fly cats is chickens, you featherless
While you tryin' to get millions, I'm trainin' as a United States terrorist!
Drombin' these bomb before your planes get off the ground
Blowin' out the pilot and all flames that sound the same
Y'all niggas is B-12 bumped up wit' a pound of fame
I'm thirty-two degrees below freezin' in the game
But some of you love, gettin' crossed in the pair of pliars
I'mma call high yellow nigga keepin' hoes duckin' like a hair dryer

That B.-I.-G. 'Ready To Die' shit, 2Pac 'All Eyez' shit
That classic hot shit, Jag in garage shit
You braggin', ain't got shit. Complainin' 'bout my shit
PaChino's above average. Product of a mixed marriage
I'm violent, you better be silent like the 'J' in spanish
Immacurate, saw moons and stars and flames in back of it
Rap past the untalented. Dangerous, haters try to silence it
Couldn't accomplish it. I'm bringin' the ruckus, I promise it
My skills are polished it. 'You wack, nigga.' I'm wack's opposite
Drama's been poision pen venom bent up inside of your brain
My lyrical syringes for dope fiends to take my name in vein
Physical frame, the heron Frankie Lyman over-dosed on
I'm strong, I make you look weaker than Usher wit' no shirt on
I still attack tracks like two young-G raps
This industry's ill, it's a bunch of hyperchondriachs
And I'mma smack ya face off ya face for bitin' rhymes
Like I've more skills than you niggas if you practiced for three lifetimes
Lyrical hangtime. You wacker. Jump in the time machine
And soft the vagina that half of these rappas came out of

I'm a mad rappa, beat you like the editor of 'Blaze'!
For real cause Bill Clinton look like George Clinton cause he got
Funked with Parliament, the Congress but I done funked all of it!
Sick tales from the male Mary Magdaline. Chino's so raveshing
You couldn't double X-L if you was the magazine
The black Nazerine, takin' charism. The hell in the battle
You mix with sugar and shit spice, you're not add ho!
You're gettin' sex pay-back from my lyrical syntex
Nigga, ya index finga wouldn't trigga a bottle of Windex
And I forgot more lyrics then you will ever write. Tight wild like
Eddie Murphey gettin' caught with that transvestite on that night
You cats might get put to sleep like pills I be nodding on
Foldin' niggas' Averexes while they still got 'em on!
Buildin' underground side holes with lights dimmer than the ones in
Biggie Smalls's hallways. Colder than a menthol lip that's
Haulin' rap in the fall. My foot deep in the ass of
Niggas that's Glock rhymin' me. I do to your future, dog
I'm savage. That word is describin' me
("Scribin' me. Scribin' me...")
Chianardo DiCaprio been known to slap a ho

I'm from that indian tribe called Nava-love-a-ho

You have, scars in your mask like Seal
That ain't for real
We'll have to fix that, yo nigga, sit back

[Xzibit:]
Your flow remind me of a nigga that I just don't feel
Same style and delivery
Might as well have his grill
Pass the scapel, the alcohol, clamps
25 hundred get you style enhanced
It's like...

[Saafir:]
This, mask right here will lift your grill
It'll put height in your mack
Don't take to much off
If you want a nose like Michael Jackson

[Xzibit:]
If you want it done right, nigga come see this
Maybe even send your bitch
We can fix them tits
From a C-cup to a double D-cup
Make them big shits, doctor lick 'em, yeah

[Saafir:]
I like to, axe em, jack em for their financial
Need a facial, I'll change the skin tone to interracial
After I'm done, you might have a little pouch though
Nothin' my scaple can't fix
What kind of face you want
(I want the kind that make me look like I can rhyme)
It'll cost you
(But I can find the skrilla, if I can have that nigga face named Saafir!)
That's imposterous, plus I never cloned a microphone
What type of shit you on, I hope you got insurance
Before I sit you on my gurney
And lead you to an anesthetic breather
If your not broke, I'll save your face like dope and make it right
Casue being fake ain't tight
You need plastic surgery

[Hook:]
I hear the same ole rhymes, the same ole style
(It seems you need plastic surgery) x5

[Xzibit:]
I'm located, at, the bottom of the black list
I like to malpractice, complicate a surgery
Intoxicated, smoke cigarettes, drop ashes in your open gases
Feel the utensil, knife is dull like a pencil
And what?
When a nigga play pussy, get fucked
Without a kiss or a hug, I'm like contaminated blood
Transfused from a junkie
With the heroin jones, I reconstruct the bones
Of all hip hop clones

[Ras Kass:]
I date fat girls that weigh 215
With low self esteem, cause it's easier to get the pussy
I'm performing vinyl liposuctions
(Fat MC?)
Phat production, motherfuckin' facial reconstruction
Needles injected 33 RPM of anesthetic for actors who require cosmetic
Sex changes from bitch niggas to rah-rah niggas
The only cure for sick lyrics is to implant a hit gimmick

[Saafir:]
This shit is full blown, you better head to the clinic
After Captain Save-A-Ho, we had the sex lieutenant
Operate get straight, we here to separate the fake from the classic
Niggas get blasted if they plastic

[Hook]

[Ras Kass:]
I'm like Dougie Howser M.D with a desert eagle
Criminal Genius
Operation, seperatin' them siamese twins hangin' beneath them niggas' penis
Take it to your face like a skin graft
Rappers, I specialize in talent transplants
You want fat lips nurse get the collagen
And ten tons of stomach pumps from all the cum you and Richard Gere be
Swallowin'
Now followin' ask Vanna to buy you vowels
So you can see I, aye, E-Swift, oh, you know why
We remain uncontested to the contender, we can
Million Man March all the way to December
January, Feburary 28th

[Saafir:]
I never wash my hands
The only rubber gloves I wear is on my dick
But I'll split you quick
Got hands like Jackie Chan, the way I switch my wrists and
I make ya sick, but I'm a doctor, don't trip
Hopefully, in surgery, I won't slip
On a tile that file and twist ya lips
Like Gomer Pyle
Prescriptions I'm over-ripe
For the ones thats overbitin' on dental records
Bitin', to God, send your blessings
I'll put your mask on, fast like Ramadan
Mix them bitches like half Lola Falana, half blonde in the paper, they named me
A Large Professor, a Mad Scientist, with a long line of clients
(BITCH! GET OUT OF MY OFFICE)
You don't have an appointment or an application
For me to attack your face in my practice
Never lackin' when I'm inserting these plastic patches

Oh...not
The same as mine, not the same ass

Nickel plated statements with nickel

Knuckle faded faces. No matter what

That's why you're sinkin' in your own

Nose is in my business, witnessin'
Your
Own fate, drownin' in your own lake
Of hate

Perverse perpin' after the salt I can

Oh-oh-oh I'm coolin' with my niggas on the Wake up Show-oh-oh
We kick a little something for the radio-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Nas]
Check it, bust it
Tune it up it's the corrupt novelist, Nas
Involved in this liveness radio waves
Slaves thrive inside of this
Wake Up Show flow, hip-hop's alarm clock, the bomb spot
Mellow with ganja, that makes my eyes turn yellow
Seat reclined on my leather sofa
However close to Na- be I'm Joe Quicks
King Tech I could just see 'em on the one and two son
My blunted crew pour the rum
92.3, number one in the slum
Representin' DJ's
Sway's the host, see police the most
What a collaboration see I'm comatose
No pork just knowledge and I'm born once more
It's the beat that blesses the street deep in the 9-4

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Hip-hops last prophet henceforth in excistence
The 92.3 megahertz will exert radio waves
The slaves for a phenomenal distance
Electrons appear to slice through jeeps that you can hear some
Slum that it will chunk consider it will numb your eardrum
Kid, you sleepin' like a Latter Day Saint
With Sway & King Tech gon' wake you up on a saturday
9 to 12 verbal junkies overdose
And Joe Quicks will get you fixed to the mix
And then I'm ghost win

[Verse 3: Prince Poetry]
In your sleep I slap you with a lethal doses of medicine
So Wake Up with Organizin' the bretherin
King Tech, Joe Quiks better than your last fix
Severing wackness with Sway the host dumps a fat mix
Baby doll is frontin' so saturday night's open
Hoppin' on the one on one, times scope
And 92.3 degree is chokin' on chocolate
And from thou smokin' Prince Po'
Blows up from LA to Lobokin and I'm out

[Verse 4: Ras Kass]
Yo it's the Wake Up Show
My genetic make up take up
One hundred and thirty pounds of beef
But my lyrics shake up, like January 17th
Cause all the 16th MC's fossils
Protect ya neck and wear a bulletproof vest on ya tonsils
Amateurs bandage ya cornea
Cause you don't wanna see California
Get C-arson and spittin arsenic
With Sway Tech and Joe Quicks on the mix
Spinal meningitis ain't as stiff as the riff
Of Ras Kass, styles last like Jason crackers with whips
Come equipped you're losin' your paraphernalia
I'm a hip hop apostle
Sing in the gospel like Mehailja, Jackson
It's saturday nine until the break of dawn
Put cocaine on my tongue
You got crack now rock on *echo*

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Dred Scott]
Saturday night get live set it off
Right swing with my peeps
King Tech yo pass the mic and turn her up
Yeahyeahyeah it's peen kablow Dred Scott it's
Nine o clock, time for the Wake Up Show
To the breaker you think I'mma say dawn
But I say, day, cause it rhymes with Sway
My word is bond I'm on the scene
Plottin out the mainstream doin
Them right, with Joe Quicks on the mix
Late in the night so tune in
Cause the crew don't sleep
Boomin in ya Jeep on 92.3

[Verse 6: Shyheim]
It's 9 o'clock PM, 92.3 the Beat begins
To rock hip-hop non-stop, you know who got the props
In L.A. on saturdays, Tech and Sway no doubt

[Verse 7: ??]
Set your clocks for the unorthodox hip-hop that drops
Nine to midnight King Tech and Sway yo those kids is tight
In the mix with Joe Quicks the verbs spit verses
With the purpose of droppin curses like a triple six
Fat snares and dirty kicks to get ya open
From Watts to Oakland it's that raw {shit} that start provokin
Smokin, word's precise like a laser, cross roads in the Wake Up Show
We'll get your party shakin like a pager on silent mode, yeahha
Nine to twelve saturday night fool, peep the episode

[Verse 8: Saafir]
Wake Up, Show, and you can tell
I'm not spittin it in no muffled style
No silent screams just weddings, rings
To swings and Sway Techs King, Tech-
-nique and I'm building in a little agility from Joe Quicks
Hey Jay-Z in the eyes
It's seen only on the bottom of water risin
We're takin groups
Put it on 92.3 while your beatin boops, oops
I mean coops bumpin in to mission on the twine
Swoop saturday between nine and twelve I'm delvin
We're well tuned in to the pattern of the year
Here on 92.3 times me
Bo junks young ricks are bolders
That are only soldiers are connected to Wake Up Show
Ya right

[Hook]Peace
Here to explain to you 25 to life
It's not no criminal shit
But then again it is
It's some lyrical shit
From the abyss

[ VERSE 1: Saafir ]
What else am I to do, I'm not seein no more
Revenue, I try to detach myself from life
So catastrophies never grace my path
I couldn't never play (what?) the part, so I started
With heartmarkers never mark me
I never crossed the Parker's Brothers path
The absent minded applicant denied
See, these rhymes are designed to stretch the skin
Anticipation of the Junction
Jerkin your ass into a ??? worker answer to fly by night
Vision emulates precision
A trait for greatness related to liquidation of the character
When animation consumes your whole conversation like vapor
I'mma mangle that ass like a acre, I'm a get-paider
You're on my land, my ancestor's mindstate
Make platinum in the ears of a large resident
I be in charge of the canibal's canabis
Where hot shit, ain't no fannin this, when I write it's 25 to life

(For every rhyme I write it's 25 to life) --] Havoc

[ Saafir ]
25 to life
It's a mindstate, straight up and down
Stay hard
In your foundation keep mobbin
Youknowmsayin?
Don't slip like these gased at paid niggas

[ VERSE 2: Mahasin ]
I get a strike every time I touch the mic
Marks got a bounty on my head from scripts read
Mahasin lyric assassin leave yo ass for dead
You have no stamina, amateur
And don't know my caliber
I make the party say ho at the show
From the verbal calico with nuff ammo
Quick to clown these tricks and these broads
Cause they rhymes ain't hard
Wack MC walk away scarred
Cause they didn't know what they was in fo'
Didn't have the proper info
I'm an underground soldier savage on the rhyme
And I'm goin for mine, can't knock it
Dare not try to stop it
Can't get with the sick shit that I spit
I ain't yo punk bitch
You have no stash, so how can you profit?
Rob you of your props, run, get the cops
But I'll disappear into thin air
Make your life a misdemeanor
Know what I mean, huh?
Crime scene clean smooth getaway

[ Saafir ]
Youknowmsayin?
Non-detectable
Can't be seen
But we the usual suspectuals
Yaknawmsayin?
You can find us
All you gotta do is look baby
Peep

[ VERSE 3: Saafir ]
Mentally I'm here, Saafir is focused like Minolta
Yoko Ono couldn't sow no linen like this
I'm on the john shittin these writtens
Lickin my fingers like a banker
Swingin it like a shanker
Paint a picture like a Van Gogh
Flow faster than a locomotive
I bounced a ho as sho' as holdin my balls like boulders
Bustin shots through the holster
A quarter century
To life means describin the lyrical pimp in me (bitch)
When I write for the likes of criminals at night
Striking through the night for life

Junction riders
Puttin it down
H.J.'s
Deflectin these hate rays

Song: Bent

I've been down this corridor -
Before you enter you have to bring
Back the creator of winter damn
Too late I'm spoiled, I need the napalm
I got it, I shot it in my left sector
Blew up the timing device on the reactor
Time shifted I had to remold the floor
The foundation for creation - mate's blend
The pleasure dome into another roam -
A walk stalked nightly by the ogre
That's rarely sober. But there's no tracin
I see the place in the flow. I'm beyond dawn
No I'm not in the lawn under pawns -
Don't rest, never possessed stagnate magnets
I never pulled slits lips wit no braille skilled eyes -
Balls through eyesockets. I'm currently current
Currents of electricity; They can't get wit me
Invisible to the retina half - way reality part limbo
A nervous laugh while ya climbin through windows
Never spin ho's on merry-go-rounds
Be the ground level for ghouls, schools of fish
Victims on a hit list me like Geronimo on a pratt -
Tackle patt tacklin patterns addin in seasonings, flavor
No false teeth for beef, catapulting fingers to light
Switches so you can see the real, I feel the tension
My sight twitches - I'm bent

Second Scene: I'm the star in a step show
Around corners, the coroner's office;
Where my rep grows. I'm on some sort of drug
Like the President, it's evident that I'm noid
A little bit of pizza - the riddle gets deeper
I'm lookin for outs n ins, stolen isotonas
The gloves, the bout begins three jabs on a transport
It's a sport for me to take another life on landing
Branding wit a prattle prod designed by God
It's my job to resign frauds
The odd is against you got a degree in me
So I know that I flow, credentials are essential -
It's blasphemy the type of shit they be askin me
I don't feel the vibe, abstract art the veal
Doesn't heal this deprived stomach from a plummet
Swinging on a duet with the bullet
I never pull out for suspense - I'm on a bent mission

Jack Cousteau couldn't take it no deeper -
I'm a resident in Davey Jones micro-locker
Holds the phone, foamin at the mouth:
Mad Dog, a taste, never had hog I'm droppin
The scrooge, makin fools hit the log - axe it
I seen it beneath where the cowards hope
Trembled sleeper see if you can find the lost
Treasure through measures in bars - I'm bentIt's not the weather, to wear no sweater..

[Hook]
Sometimes she changed like the weather
But no one loved me better
I'll never ever forget her
My brand new sweater
Nobody got her wetter
She told me in her letter
I bought her food and fed her
My brand new sweater

[Shock-G}
Baby said, "Ooh baby shoo-be-dooh
Let's hook up again cause the loving is cool"
I said "Yo, I gotta go, I got a show"
She said "I know, after the show let me cook for you
If you're hungry, you never know
You might need help with your laundry
Don't hesitate to call upon me
Before you go, would you meet my mother
She lives right around the corner
It's not a bother, meet my mother!"
I said "Woah, woah, woah, baby slow it down
I said I gotta go, I ain't say I'm leaving town
I got your number, stop tripping
Why're you flipping? Had a great time
Let me get my jacket, I'm dipping."
Hate, hate, hate the way I felt like I dissed her
"Wait, wait, wait" cried the pretty, young sister
She said, "Shock, while I got this chance
I've got let you know that if you rip your pants
I'll beee there, to sew the hole for your butt
Want a nut? Call me up, I'll pick you up in my jetta
No one's got me wetter
Shock, I never got freaked better!"
She said "Here, yo, it's all in my letter"
See, I just met baby last night
We g'd
While I was sleeping she was up
Creeping around writing letters to me
Man, I hate somebody all up in my face when I'm sleep
But I ain't sweating it
"Look, I'll hook-up with you next week"
She said "Wait, let me walk you to the street, baby
Sweet thang, don't forget to ready my letter!"
Somebody please help me:
I'm stuck wearing a sweater

It upsets meee, when she sweats me..

A game of dominoooess

I've been sporting sweaters ever since I was a child
But nowadays sweaters kind of cramp my style
Cause up around the collar they be getting me hot
Believe it or not, my sweater used to the shot
The freak of my nature, my sweet, stick thing
But like George of the Jungle she had trouble with the swing
[Shock-G: Was she funking up the flow?]
Yeah, brah, she couldn't hack it
Started cock-blocking like a full metal jacket
Fingers did the walking, calling, tying up my phone
Boo had me under heavy surveillance at my home
Word to Mac Mone, suffocated my bone
Pulling on my hoodie in a nagging little tone
Where you going? Where you been? Who's Kim? Who's Felicia?
But I don't see no ring, I never met the preacher
I got to play you out, I mean the loving was phat
But you're a sweater, riding so heavy on my back

[Hook]
She wore a lot of leather
Baby, drove a jetta
I never used to sweat her
Yeah, but that upset her
No-one got her wetter
She told me in her letter
I'll never ever forget her
My brand new sweater

[Saafir]
I got a brand new sweater
But I didn't get it from Mervyn's
Her friends be pulling wool but
My syringe pulls bull from the lens
Even then, I'll send you back for a refund
Plus she sport a good hat-terin (?)
That'd have been the end
If I let the sweater lay upon my skin
Great Scott, time for a rebate sale
We make mail, more than you think
As long as they're strong
And the cotton don't shrink
We can spend doe on a jane doe
Cause ho got to have clothes, so
I buy the thread and let them weave
Leave it alone if you don't want to get worn out
I've got legions of sweaters for the seasons
I got blue when I'm sad, red when I'm mad
Pink cause I'm ticklish
When I'm being laid in green
When I'm getting paid
I don't have a problem if you wanna jock me
See cause, gs is what you're gonna clock me
Go ahead, knock me if you think I'm not shit
But when it comes to sweaters?
Saafir's a perfect fit

[Hook]
She was real go-getter
Her cheese smelt like cheddar
She let me use the credit
Yeah, but just forget it
She cried when I upset her
I should've treated her better

I'm cruisin, I'm losin money on gas
I pass a car with a star in it, I stare
For a minute, but that's the limit
Otherwise gas won't be the only thing
I'm losin' money too...ooh wee! It's
Tuesday, two days after the weekend
Imagine if the weekend was a day for
Weak minded men - anyway
I re-take my train of thought, I bought
A fat sack and I'm happy cause I got nappy
Soldiers in my crew, ya through, if
You don't learn so I learnt, that I'm burnt
I ran into my homie, yeah wassup?
At least I thought he was, but then I caught
The buzz that he was talkin behind my back
From his girl, ain't that Earl? For
Those who can't feel me, Earl means wack
In fact, I had that problem a few times
But I'll just splurge it in a new rhyme, then forget it
Maybe I'll split it in half, or laugh like this...
Ha ha ha... can u feel me?

I faked the funk, and conversated without a doubt
He was a chump, but with clout, I ended my route
At the liquor store and I tried to
Buy a Guiness Stout, but I remembered it was nasty
But fools drink it cause it's a hip-hop classy
You can miss me with that trendy drink
Cause they, all make your breath stink, plus
Death is linked to all alcohol that Arabians won't let you buy
They keep tellin me my identification is a lie
Why would I, put my face on plastic and in the space
Where it says birthdate put "see owner"
Fool, I'm a teenage organ donor
So I pick up my I.D. I ain't trippin - why?
Cause I'm high, already, on life
Once again - I'm riding
I'm about to hit the eastside of Oakland
I got my seat belt on so when the heat's felt
From 5.0, I'll turn up the song and start
Singing, "I wish police was a lease
That was up" Can u feel me?

Well it's gettin dark, but it's daylight savings time
Clocks go back, but I stay focused and
Ahead cause I wanna be fat, can u feel me?
If you rap I like to fully flex, I like to box
I like breakin bullies necks
I like collecting checks and collecting respect
But I'm not there yet and until then I'll just sell dank - sacks
20's, 10's, I'm drivin the weights to be
Prepared in case I meet my fate and I'm always
Thinking, "Where will I go when I die?
Will I be underground like I am now
Or in the sky?" My man plan B is smilin
Cause he can feel me, wassup JessIntro:
Yo Saafir what's goin' on playboy?
Saafir: What's really goin' on?

Huh, you tell me baby

Saafir:Hey, it's like this man
I gotta let these motherfuckers know how to crawl man

I know everybody tryin' to come up immediately

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance cause they
Ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man

Verse 1:
You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline'
And stackin' your scratch
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin'
Stickin' and movin' slidin'
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner
Dodgin' the coroner's office
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin'
Shot callin'
It's the murk one like that
Sit back but not in starship
So I don't tarnish or rust
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

Hook: (x2)
What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball

Verse 2:
All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin'
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
]From the trenches
The stench is unknown
I've been crawlin' like a two toed
Chameleon for so long
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick
Sickin' thinkin'
That we know it's on
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you
And you know they all with you
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes
Recognize
I'm crawlin'

Bridge: (x2)
Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

Verse 3:
You see gotta put in major work in at first
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin'
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys
The team then turn and brace God gave green
Going, going till I'm gone
I'm ballin'

HookAh, I don't wanna hear shit
Get off ya motherfucking ass
It's right now, right now, right here
And we bringing it to you live, COME ON!
Golden state, what... come on, what bitch
New Shit! Ha, come on, yeah Ras Kass blaze that shit up
Xzibit, break it down slam it, Jelly Roll

[Ras Kass]
Show me a bitch and I'm a slay her like Sarah Michelle Gell-ie
Rap star, trash tellies blow up my sprint celly
Dare me, I tongue Halle Berry's belly
Show her a monster's ball, fuck it you tell me
Platinum, heavy 22 inch Pirellis
Jelly, it gets so ugly it gets scary
Haters act like under-age hoes so what's really-
Can't fuck wit y'all, paging R.Kelly (ooooohhh)
Oh, if the shoe fits buy a matching shirt
Ya nothing take ya face and attach dirt
Catch me and my niggas wit strychnine
Strictly constrict 9 triggas disfigure ya figure
Our figgas got bigger, niggas the same
Menace to society and y'all done made me Kane
Can't extort us faggot, you bust we bust
In God we trust but we paying at dusk, biatch!

[Hook]
Don't you think this shit is for fun (NO!)
Think before you reach for that Gun (Think!)
Look at all the shit that you started (yeah)
You bring heat but we bring it harder (sing!)
La la la la la la la la (Ha!)
La la la la la la la la (Sing!)
La la la la la la la la (yes)
La la la la la la la la (come on)

[Saafir]
Yella, yizzel, shaft shizza-lean
Fuck what y'all talking about, this shit clean
That's why we filthy rich behind the scenes
Game spitters with helmets and shoulder pads on the hitters
Bullshit so far what this game sent
We here to burn it down open bar entertainment
Taking the work clipping the clientele on raw
Lactose intolerant but I still sell
Game enough to mash on the coach like Sprewell
Don't salt there hoes flows ain't got that sea smell
Overstand under surveillance, Ben Savage-
Can't come to the town terrorizing we been Laden
Been beat heavyweight beefs and went passage
Back to the blockmates and it's safe to unlock cakes
King sizzel makin' bank, shake the spizzle
We don't make it drizzle we rain in the G-state

[Hook]
Don't you think this shit is for fun (NO!)
Think before you reach for that Gun (Think!)
Look at all the shit that you started (come one)
You bring heat but we bring it harder (now sing!)
La la la la la la la la (Sing!)
La la la la la la la la (Yeah!)
La la la la la la la la (Sing It!)
La la la la la la la la (yeah)

[Xzibit]
Feel the adrenaline, feel the rush
The effects of the compound the ammo dump
Doc Dre don't fuck with punks
We all thump like Maximus, stop fucking with us
Take a ride inside the home of hands-on hip-hop
Speak what you believe and hope you don't get shot for it
Ghetto poets, show it if you got one
A hot one, with ass and rap like a shotgun
I can write to the sound of the sunset
Smith & Wesson, I use words as a weapon
Gun sling my dreams I rain supreme
And fiend for the next challenge, knocking you off balance
Look, I been through the worst, avoided the hearst (Survived!)
Starving to death and dying of thirst (alive!)
Here in the flesh, elope with the profoc-
The answer, the solution, the remedy, the anecdote

[Hook]
Don't you think this shit is for fun (NO!)
Think before you reach for that Gun (Think!)
Look at all the shit that you started (yeah)
You bring heat but we bring it harder (Now sing!)
La la la la la la la la (yes)
La la la la la la la la (Sing!)
La la la la la la la la (Ha)
La la la la la la la la (come on)

Bounce... Bounce... Bounce... Yeah... Golden State"My line of work is considered by some to be a...
A tumor on society, be careful Mr. Magenta there are benign tumors
And there are others, that are very malignant..."

(Saafir)
Ay-ay, Ay-ay (Saaf Bizzle)
Ay-ay, Ay-ay (Saaf Bizzle, Nickatina) Yo
Mothafucka in here with some real Nickatine man...

(Andre Nickatina)
When the gat would hit, then the rhyme would spit
Gun nailed you to the crucifix
I ain't new improved man I'm true to this
Ain't nothin you can do to this
Chicken beg, mislead, caught a shot to the head
Instead we get high as a mothafuckin nigga yeah wit no dreads, no dreads
I get to plugging that, who Thuggin that
Gotta go drop a bug in that
Post up where the drugs is at
Yeah mothafucka where the lovin at
My computer brain is on high octane
Ripping like a rocket man
Block it try to stop it man
You'll end up in my pocket man
Bust like a bullet in a watermelon
What's the CD there you're selling
Better not be mine or mothafucka you gon' start to yelling
Fillmore rap academy, Bustin right at your sanity
Ammo and artillery, clock a major salary
Charge just like a battery, for assault and battery
Dead just like a battery, from this major battery

(Saafir)
I bang that West Oakland my colors the silver and black
Raider nigga got his stripes from the barber shop where the filmed "The Mack"
Nigga I got them rules on my shirt and I'm deep in this game
All angles spittin it so niggas don't get it confused with the fame
Let me tap that blackness on your eyeball like "What the fuck you lookin at?"
Then I got to remember, I'm strizzled and sacked and saucy off smack
Bitch I ain't no contender, I been holding these championship rings
Ammunition and big faces mothafucka I been "Ladeem"
Niggas on the turf on American soil, gettin this American green
Niggas hate cause I'm skyscraping the small shelf Bull pit cigarettes
I promise a hospital harness, to be taken the farthest from this life
Nickatine and Saafir, Sizzaline is the farthest on this mic

(Andre Nickatina)
Walked out of court doin major bragging
Bruce Lee down like danger dragon
Blue jeans doin some major sagging
Freak can bump hard in the station wagon
Hot heavy and ready
Garlic bread with the spaghetti
Do it like Bo-Bo, with a fo-fo
Ty fo-fo, Ty fo-fo
Write to the gods like it's legendary
Some might think its imaginary
In the rap game freak I popped the cherry
What you gotta say about that
Keep it live a 45 number 2 pencil
Get my solo wave, for the perfect gangsta instrumental, ya feel me
Check it, load me up and then cock me back
Then come right back with the counter rap
He's bustin raps till he collapse
Or at least until his chest plate crack

(Saafir)
I ain't one of these bitch ass niggas
That ain't from the town that spit what he don't do
But I'mma let him bumble a little more then I'mma hip all my niggas to you
You lyin about tryna be high that ain't fire that you spittin
Purple haze a fake crook get cooked and burnt
And baked the fuck up in Hell's Kitchen
I ain't one of these bitch ass niggas
That ain't from the town that spit what he don't do
But I'mma let him bumble a little more then I'mma hip all my niggas to you
You lyin about tryna be high that ain't fire that you spittin
Purple haze a fake crook get cooked and burnt
And baked the fuck up in Hell's Kitchen
I know at his next show he'll be slipping, cause his guns ain't clicking
He tryna shine like stadium lights I'mma leave this nigga ice dripping
With some real heat star 6-70
For a bitch ass Hollywood nigga that wanna become a star that's heavenly
It's not hard, you can depend on me
Serving niggas like you, I'm the epitome
Only difference I don't drink much
And mothafuckas get deeply touched
That think I give a fuck tryna get money
But shit if you gotta get hit I'll dump your face off
Have your ass under the Astroturf of some shit
Crack that weak Halloween mask
And stab your ass in a pumpkin, I'm dumping

West Oakland...Saaf Bizzle...

"Finished with the assignment, beautiful, excellent work, great work..."
