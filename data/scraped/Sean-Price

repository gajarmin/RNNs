Jedi Mind Tricks, M.F.C

[Sean Price]
Yeah first of all don't make me burst and brawl
Image is nothin you frontin see the thirst in ya'll
Think its fucked up now, it get worst for ya'll
Assassinate your best friend now I hurt you par
Run up on your block wit dough and I curse you all
The fuck out you wanna wet duke squirt your four
Since birth I been raw hot like surface core
Kidnap your baby's mom straight earth the whore
See I do rhyme and crime so I can purchase more
If you ain't in it for that what the purpose for
Act like you don't give a fuck though
Good so I buck fo' shots from the roof
And my man Ruck catch you up close
Never give a fuck about niggas ya'll not Nutso
Hype off of carbonated water and some fructose
Straight buck foes when the nigga Ruck pull the snub nose
Wait Ruck chill, what the deal its all love though
Look into my eyes and you can see there's something changed
Runnin gunnin things knockin niggas out like Clubber Lang
With the gun I bring its straight for beatin you down
Heatin you down leavin you six feet deep in the ground

[Vinnie Paz]
It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

[Jus Allah]
I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
My heart is hateful, my tongue ripped
Lickin on the blade that slayed you
You faggots act as bitch as RuPaul
You niggas share one milkshake with two straws
You're trapped with no doors, four walls tighten
Seein the roof fall, feelin the floors heighten
Crushed and shit, your bones are blood siphoned
And put into a jug we sip before fightin
I'm raw lightning; my power extends
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Black man travel through the universe and back
While cavemen still though that the earth was flat
But we kept the sacred plans, now we carry
Throughout the ancient lands
Before the separating of the sands
God saw the power I create in my hand
He banned my gene strain from replicating in man

[Hook: Vinnie Paz] x2
It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm tasteless; there's beauty in strange places
I find beauty in razors
I find beauty in blood drippin' from ya faces
I find beauty in the Qur'an and all of its Aramaic equations
I find beauty in twelve gauges
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
I find beauty in stainless steel
That can kill and reveal the front of your grill
You're brainless, ya'll don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
I crack jaws and swing swords of the ancients
Ya'll pretended to overstand the matrix
Without attempting to overstand its basics
We dedicated to cats that's been thuggin
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggan
Ya'll been duckin for quite some time now
Vinnie 'bout to teach you how to write some rhymes now
We aim beams in between your eye brows
Jedi Mind, Sean P combine now

"I rap like no one out there can fuck wit me" - Prodigy[Intro]
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta...

[Verse 1: Jay Reaper]
Psychosis
I’m going mental
I'm stuck in the melody
Call me instrumental
Hip hop felonies
Down with the gentle
Gotta analyse what I been threw
Fuck you!
Tourette one of my disorders
I been Horus
Make the beat explode when I spit on it
Supersonic I’m fluid like gin tonic
And when I say I'm killing it
Its just symbolic
Come and hang with the Dopekids
Come and hang and ima show you how the show business is
If you the lawn then I'm mowing it
Because I'm way too thick like I’m Jay-Z’s lower lip
Can’t get a grip on my sober shit
Now let me break these niggas down to the last little bit
And blast cum on your pretty bitch
Cause I got medical issues
And more than just a silly twitch
Get out my way cause I'm pretty pissed
Grab niggas by their necks and dump em in a dirty ditch
And dirty dicks for your nerdy bitch
Ima never switch
Stay like this
Till I’m 36
You jerk prick just insert disc
Or Ima get busy like a insurgist
Its
Way more than I can cope with
Hopeless
Dope D.o.D. living with a psychosis

[Verse 2: Skits Vicious]
Come along come and see it
Psychotic being, circus freak: Skits!
I cut wack mc’s career’s short as a fetus
Now I'm on the brink of destroying world leaders
I enter arena’s, seen as the beast in the sport
Chopping down crews with a 3 meter sword
When P’s on the boards there’s a chemical reaction
Run while ya can start heading for the exits
Cause my skin melts off when I transform
And shut down blocks like a sandstorm
You come across as a nervous teen
I go blind in the club and wake up to a murder scene
Drug tester, raise my blood pressure
I give chicks a case a shock lecture
Raps mad hatter, in effect!
I kill a track with flows from the bottom of the river bed
And I ain't finished yet, within a milli sec
I cut the crap and snatch ya by ya little head
I hit the switch to high voltage
And stay slick as I live in Psychosis!!!

[Verse 3: Sean price]
Psychosis, I wrote this
Heroin Needle with wings, fly dope shit
Port of Miami.am hanging near a boat bitch
Open the box and thats where the coke bricks
I'm so slick, no wave grease
When the 4 spit, don't wave peace
I'm about war, diamond with no flaws
Rhymin is so raw, climbing from dirt poor
Mentally sick, I'm meant to be rich
But I'm the opposite, I pop the 5th and empty the clip
No smile and the fucked up grin
Profile with the scuffed up timbs
Past the point of no return
Blast the joint, ignore the burns
Lost contact with reality
Psychosis who the fuck wanna battle me![Verse 1: Termanology]
Termanology, so uh, aye yo I
Send my condolences to any rapper holding a crown
I'mma blow his wig off his body and roast it
Rocking with my dudes flicker
Move when I'm with the goons
It's a fool run any rapper that wanna diss the crew
I'm with the Switzerland wolves we bout to spit some jewels
For the ? ? ? ? ? caring flaring with the tools
I'm the hardest spitter and I got the heart to kill you
I put your squad up in the grave then I party with you
You not soldiers you stock brokers, the Glock's smoking
I'm Pac over Nas I'mma start rock and rolling
I'm Michelangelo eating you like a cannibal
Greeting you with my hammer-lo
Deepest flow I'm mechanical
Mandible like Canibus
Render these rappers like amateurs
Panicking what she should be my uzi weighing a ton or two
I got determination, that's right the term is waiting
To turn your safe into my personal bank and burn your paper
The MC slaughterer, pardon us we make horror flicks
We chopping bodies like calamari, you pounds of fish
On a scale lucky lefty
Sonnie turn your vessy messy
It's Termanology rock with me
I be repping SC

[Hook x2: Lil' Fame]
If you don't want to get buried alive or get tossed in the grave
You better get off the ground, get off the ground
And from New York, we do it our way
You better get off the ground, get off the ground

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Yo you can't rap, understand fam you can't rap
Overhand blam, you got slapped
Now get off the ground, pull my dick off a ral
Click and hiccup the pound
Pop a few bars, who eat and devour the bars
Nice rip you a bitch, still a coward in cars
Off the marijuana, I will Sarah Conner your squad
On the scene clean, we are the champions Pa
Rap Gouda, it's a rap the gat shoot you
Dough fight the dyke, ????
Provoke Mic ice pick, your bitch shoot coolers
P, good night Pa you're a loser
Listen I rap better than most dudes
Most dudes can't rap and tap on your boat shoes
P, bust my nine
Sean Price thinking Justin Tyme, let's do it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ruste Juxx]
Machine gun skunk I blow dolo
That's why your bitch jocked me like Polo
I ain't gotta go get it cause I got it on me
I smell like palm trees, nothing but exotic on me
Hoes get erotic on me, I put the pipe down
Stick the pipe in her mouth tell her pipe down
Now lick a shot for niggas doing life inside
Grabbing you by the neck, sticking the knife inside
It's B-R-double-O-K, double A-K brining trouble your way
Knock niggas out, they can't get off the ground
Shell cases found, the cops get off the ground
So put a muzzle on that bi-suiter rap shit
Nigga knuckle up, cock rugers back bitch
Ruste Juxx bullets blow out your brain
Think it's a game, listen to Lil' Fame

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Justin Tyme]
Foul lyrical assassins, patented the truth
We gonna carry the torch son when we get in the booth
Looking for proof, ask ???
Everybody follow is watching, yeah you better salute
Nobody move until we say so, we murder ?? to BK
You better lay low ho
It's a takeover, the game's over, we stay sober
It ain't over, who told you dawg we can't honor
It's the 2K11 and we still push figures
Got mad haters, but they still don't get us
It's the Clash of the Titans, you want beef start biting
Like Iron Mike Tyson in his prime make you fighting
We got the tracks make, Mr. Who gon smash
Legendary friend, got the hook on smash
Yeah, we make all these cool girls gone mad
It's a no-brainer, bout to steal game

[Hook]

[Verse 5: H-Staxx]
Move motherfucker, what part you ain't understand
I'll murder something with the steel in my hand
Blaow, blaow, blaow
Knock something off quick
Can't dance with the wolves I walk with, we'll talk shit
We holla at the moon, let you feel that boom
Sookie, run or you are doomed
Send your punk-ass to the upper room
We do this, AMs, PMs, evenings and afternoons
Mornings it's on, a new day is dawning
Popping off over here, international warning
From New York to Switzerland, we gets it in
Competition, don't want none
We send them things whistling
Vision that, holla back it's beast mode
Unleash ??
Who gotta problem with that, hey yo Slap
These clowns get slapped, word to G-ma

[Hook][Verse 1]
Yo, Grown man fuck rappity rap

Ugandan lunch meat, I am Idi Amin
I slap your snapback off for tryin ta snatch the god backpack off Muthafucker (Psht)
Niggas needin a song I'm like, Fuck rap then I read the Koran
Kareem Said oh indeed, on my deen ahki
Except when I rhyme, every line from Sean is haraam
Uh, Nigga, I'm a work in progress
Came a long way from the jerk in the projects, ha ha

[Verse 2]
Ah where was I, Oh yes
Old school nigga blunt and a Becks
Sean Price, sabado gigante
You a chain snatcher, I'm Carlito Brigante, P!
Spit bodies, you be hardly rappin

All that rappin, flashin, cashin, fashion
Don't make me, snatch him, catch him, slap him, stab him
Everything that your crew do wrong
Everyday I get dressed singin the new shoes song (New Shoes)

Fam with the hammer, I am Beta Ray Bill, P! (Yeah, ha ha)[Verse 1]
Bitch harm me, the Swiss army knife in my hand

Dig in your pockets, leave you right where you stand
Got a, dime bitch that live in Japan
Black belt, suck dick, chop bricks with her hand
Arigato, Sean Price slick like el gato
Three piece suit in the booth, ain't shit cute
Might, smack off half your smile, go to court with a suit
Smack the other half, after trial
Plead the fifth, y'all niggas plead the eighth
Don't leave your face fucked up, now your knees is scraped, I'm buggin'
E-pills, mushrooms, and dust
Got that nigga Sean Price in the mood to bust
Sean P., the motherfucking all time great
New York to NC nigga, the all rhyme state

[Hook: Tek (Sean Price)]
From, coast to coast, he traveled the land
Left footprints in grains of sand, it's
(Sean P) the soldier of force, the magnum deliver
In his presence, phony rappers will shiver
It's (Sean P), six ' one, weighing an even 200
Lord help you if you double stacked up and blunted
It's (Sean P), under rated, best in the game
Allow me to tell these onion heads, what's ya name (Sean P)

[Verse 2]
Motherfuckers ain't as nice as me
And if they is, they would've been Sean
That's fucked up for you, you should of been on
Rappin' again, punk rappers need to grab up a pen
Write some ill shit, nigga, and let the madness begin
Rhymin' for dough, no money, pa, rhyming for do'
No partners, just P, I'm lighting the show
Niggas said I lost my image, when I cut off my dreads
But I'm the nicest nigga out duke, fuck what you said
Let it be known, gold ring embedded with stone
So when I punch you in the head, the shit'll dent up your domeNiggas running up, asking bout Rock, I send your ass to heaven
Motherfucker, ask God about 'Pac
Ask about B.I.G., motherfucker ask about Pun
Gangsta rappers can't fight, so they rap about guns

[Hook][Produced by Apollo Brown]

[Intro: Richard Pryor]
Some fuckin' is good for you, though, Jack. Gettin' some pussy beats havin' a war. I ain't lyin', cummin' is a lot of fun

[Hook 1]
Drink Irish, smoke Jamaican
Fuck Brazilian model chicks on vacation
Shag hot Swedish girls on holiday
That's the American way

[Verse 1: Slaine]
You ain't in, early sobriety, girlie don't lie to me
I dirty your diary, your eyes all perverted and fiery
Her in the lobby, slurrin' and probably higher than I be
Dawg you're connivin', fast livin', how we're survivin'
Obvious I've been, brought up, caught up in violence
Psychotic, narcotic, hot white product environments
Sirens in bunches comin' to stop the bullets and punches
Streets is bloodthirsty, obnoxious, full of [?]
Runnin' 'em up, shitfaced, with her in the truck
Cuttin' it off, I'm grabbin' on her cunt and her muff
She wanted it rough
Told me that she liked to be choked
And get her hair pulled, I don't know, it might be the coke
But I'm a weirdo, kept her till the night could be broke
Drop her off, polish off a pint and light me a smoke
I don't need to be fixed cause I ain't actually broke
And at 7:58 I'm waitin' the Paki to open

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]
Drink Irish, smoke Jamaican
Fuck a bad Canadian on vacation
Bag a Japanese girl on holiday
No work and all play

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
Drink Irish when there's no Tennessee
I wanna dick her down, one pint Hennessy
I know you've got Antonio mad, just don't let me see
Give me a jager without the bomb, no energy
Guzzle like a V-12, there's no end to me
Got it goin' on, I'm the envy of my enemy
This ain't no trust fund money, work carefully
Everything I have I obtained independently
The sickest man alive needs therapy
ATM account, no crutch, no parakeet
Do it all tonight, tomorrow's not guaranteed
Freeloaders fillin' up their cup where the [?] be
They got 5 on it, but drink 20 worth
Gentlemen jacks G, go ahead and serve
Let me get my purp, swerve, look for a miniskirt
Find a little bunny, let's see if the Henny work

[Hook 1] + [Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
Jameson, breakfast of Champions
They love American, black, worldwide for rappin', son
I'm on spring break in summer time
Get to your girl's bottom like an underline
Goodbye bitches, good night bitches
Left stroke def with a mean right, bitches
Done 'em right, bitches, kegel all day
And keep it tight, bitches, even you dyke bitches
We doin' keg stands in the Netherlands
She blowin' me backstage and I just met her, man
And never took it out her mouth at all
Blame it on the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-alcohol and molly
Prolly roll a couple spliffs then afterparty
Then after hours, then R. Kelly time
That's golden showers, and she off the powder
My Aston Martin is like Austin Powers

[Hook 1] + [Hook 2]

[Verse 4: Sean Price]
P!
Drink Irish, sniff Dominican
Kill your whole family, tree branch Levitican
Dope comes three times, where the fuck is my dividends?
Simple rhymes from Sean but Sean ain't no simpleton
Medicated master, dedicated rapper
School of hard knocks, ock the educated rapper
Street smart on MLK Boulevard
Entourage packin' a gun, my son camouflaged
African ape, Jack Johnson, King Kong
Slapped to your face, Charles Bronson the big [?]
Gunned up already, thumbs up, Fonzarelli
Smacked over stupid shit cause Sean petty
Type to get your shit split in the club
And then have a peace treaty, nip the shit in the bud
You let shit pass, nigga
Fuck out my face, you bitch ass nigga, P[5 Ft.]
Yeah, come on, yeah, come on
Yeah, throw ya hands up, come on, yeah, come on, yeah
Sean P! Sean P!
Get at these niggas, son!

[Sean Price]
You can catch me in a tenement
Doing too much drugs, straight Jimi Hendrix-in'
Pop's a drinker, my mom's on dope
Pick up they bad habit, now the God do both
Popping some pills, sniffing a line, drinking some wine
Up in the club, grabbing my gun, fucking with Shyne
Bling bling (bling bling) it's a Sean Price thing
Too many clowns want the crown, but there's only one king
I'm the King, ask Rock, there is none higher
Bitch ass niggas better call me sire
Burn my kingdom, must use fire
Big bag of weed, a dutch and some E-Z Wider
Yo, Ruck had a drug habit and all
Bust matics, chrome static I ain't fucking with y'all
Don't get my hands dirty, I got goons that spray
Quick to kill a motherfucker, like boom bye yeah

Dru Ha, what up, yeah yeah
Buckshot, what up, yeah yeah
Big Rock, what up, yo yo
Tek and Steel what up, yo

"First name Sean, last name Price"

[Sean Price]
I step in the ring weighing an even two hundred
Lost twenty pounds in B-ville, fucking around with E pills
So I took a trip to Jack LaLanne
Got my weight back like that when I snatched the chain
Duke I'm hardcore, far more than the average
In Job Corps, I smoked more than you bastards
Y'all niggas ain't fucking with Ruck
Wilding out like it's dust in my dutch, motherfucker
Stupid bitches think the God got plenty dough
Just because they saw a motherfucker up on Jenny Jones
Have to step back and laugh at these hoes
I'm Sean Price, the brokest rapper you know
Nice to meet ya
Ike Turner when rocking the wife beater
You step on my toes, hoes and you're wiping my sneakers

Rustee Juxx, what up, yo yo
Illa Noyz, what up, yo yo
Elroy, what up, yo yo
Sethlow, what up, yo

"First name Sean, last name Price"

[Sean Price]
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
First name Sean, last name Price
Nigga I'm David Ruffin in the flesh
Fucked up in the game, but never the less, I'm the best
Y'all niggas be rhyming about nothing
I rhyme about nothing, and sound like something
I used to sell crack and listen to Redman
Now I smoke black, while I'm getting some head, damn
Sean Price, always broker than most
That's why the gunsmoke choke in your throat
Stick 'em up
Put your hands where my eyes can see
Yo, this ain't Busta Rhymes, bong!
Bust a nine, bong!
Roughest and toughest, so don't fuck with mine
I will, snuff 'em and cut 'em, before he fuck with mine, yo

What up
GRB, what up
Dan the man, what up
Sean Price, what up[Verse 1-Buckshot]
Ridin' down the A-V-E in the black A-M-G
With the Mac by my lap and they envy
The fact that they can't see me
Dippin' through the traffic, I'm relaxin', smokin' black with ease
Now my cell phone ringin', it's a breezy
Let me see, yep, it's this chick I just met and won't let me breathe
Fuck that, my mind on my movement
Cause when your money stop, they get dumbfounded and do this
"Who this nigga next to me?"
Like you give checks to me, nigga, it's respect to me
Let them niggas step to me and I'll handle my biz first
Then call up my team and they'll handle they biz worse
This shirt that I wear on my back
Represent every vocalist you hear on these tracks
Nigga, and everywhere that I steer my gat
I steer my whips and you hear where we at, nigga

[Hook-Tek (Starang Wondah)]
I said 1-2-3 (Uh-huh, uh-huh) Let me know if you're ready for me, lawd
(And nowadays everybody murder, bustin' they guns
The whole hood is corner boys, gettin' they ones)
I said 1-2-3 (Uh-huh, uh-huh) Let me know if you're ready for me, lawd
(And now everybody got a sixteen, a beat and 'dro
The whole hood is gangsta, pimpin' they ho's)

[Verse 2-Sean Price]
Listen, kick drum, snare and hi-hat
I pitch jums around here, pa, don't try that
Louis Satchmo, pull the tool, let the gat blow
Melon pop, taco meat, extra tobasco
Little Rascal, buck heat at Buckwheat
For talkin' dumb, but they all love it when Ruck speak
Fuck freaks for free, fuck freaks on E
Probably fuck freaks that you've seen on BET
Been there, done that, no rubber, got clap
So it hurt when I piss, this verse is the shit
Sean is a beast, you can hear me holler at the full moon
Columbine High, settin' fire to school rooms
No way, Jose Canseco
Pop popular guys at the pop of the bank-o
Sean Price, big knife, ready to shank those
Niggas at the dice game frontin' with bankrolls

[Hook-Tek (Starang Wondah)]
I said 1-2-3 (Uh-huh, uh-huh) Let me know if you're ready for me, lawd
(And nowadays everybody murder, bustin' they guns
The whole hood is corner boys, gettin' they ones)
I said 1-2-3 (Uh-huh, uh-huh) Let me know if you're ready for me, lawd
(And now everybody got a sixteen, a beat and 'dro
The whole hood is gangsta, pimpin' they ho's)

[Verse 3-Tek]
Now everybody is a hustler, grind to get money
Remember these same people broke and bummy
Askin' me for ones, being real hyphy
You spendin' all the Grant's and givin' Jackson's to wifey
Now I got haters wantin' to ice me
I gotta be careful 'fore they secret indict me
And make me a Mountaineer like West VA boys
Can't do no crime since I tatted my face boy
I'll be dead in a lineup, givin' a time-up
Twenty five-to-life, where I sign up?
"But I'm straight, my flight leaves at 8
On the ground at nine, that's more time to grind."

[Hook-Tek (Starang Wondah)]
I said 1-2-3 (Uh-huh, uh-huh) Let me know if you're ready for me, lawd
(And nowadays everybody murder, bustin' they guns
The whole hood is corner boys, gettin' they ones)
I said 1-2-3 (Uh-huh, uh-huh) Let me know if you're ready for me, lawd
(And now everybody got a sixteen, a beat and 'dro
The whole hood is gangsta, pimpin' they ho's)[Hook: Styles P]
If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Black folks, crack smoke
Big head scientist, island of Patmos
Fake tears and snakes here
Question my thug cause I ain't shoot a nigga in 8 years
Sets superior imperious rex sket interior airing ya nearing ya death inferior
Listen, it's so thuggish to sniff 'caine
Make me cold-blooded, motherfucker, I'm Rick James
Hell of a drug, Sean Price, hell of a thug
Hang with Sheen, I got elephant blood
Listen to me, y'all better not listen to me
Fuck around and catch a case, trying to be like P
Listen, a ring on you brother, I'm harming you daily
Clown, Ringling Bros and Barnum and Bailey
P, now download this on a disk
If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this
Bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Phew, just made the cut baby
Let me light this motherfucking weed I'm smoking
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
For real
Light the crack pipe so I know it's real

Whoa, young Bill Murray
I'm 21, but I feel 30
A little birdy out in Jersey said my raps were too wordy
Told his bitch to suck my dick and do a curtsy, dirty, slurpy
I smell earthy, puttin' curry on my turkey
I'm Blade 3, you're more Blades of Fury
Blonde dykes love me for my Klondike tummy
Getting all types of money, I'm with Sean Price, dummy, P
Polite stuntin' at a nice white luncheon
Met your wife, pipe plumbing, led to all night humping
Oh no, the end of your life coming
We the tribe, don't make me Phife something
My bitch from Beirut, she get loose
110 proof, call me Zeus, pussy tighter than a wet suit
Jesus Christ, he so nice

[Hook][Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah, another one, the mad butcher
12 O'Clock, Prodigal Sunn, Bronze Nazareth
Two On Da Road, yeah, Think Differently
My nigga Dreddy Kruger, yeah

[Prodigal Sunn]
Sunny shazaam, spark any part of ya jam
I am that I am, cannons like 'Samite Sam
That'll break ya ass up, like the hits on my ram
Legit on the cam, plus I do it, for the love of my fam
No wool over my eyes, been in the game, see through the lies
Ready and live, for them spies, try'nna see my demise
Zini on the rise, moving the sky, stay on the top
Late for the drop, keep clear, from them hip hop cops
Ain't no stopping what I'm willing, drilling
Do it for the love of the children, double some millions
The industry, a couple of billions
For killing the struggle, the war, the hustle
Remain like a muscle, solid Bronze, cooler than Fonze
Spit it like balms, seven dot coms, the man supreme
Queen with the charm, the king who keeps his loot all calm
Known to bare arms, moving some harm, off that burning bush
Twisting that diesel kush, lethal like some George Bush

[12 O'Clock]
Hip hop to me, is like food in the stomach
I bust in a nut that feel it, when you pumping
I rock a buggy eyed Benz, four hundred and something
My hands in my pocket, dead preses' by the bunches
My daughter birthday is on the candle in the pumpkin
I'm on the highway, Flex Master when he Funkin' it
Mmm.. I burn that kush, look out for them cops, they crooks
Do more crimes than son in Brook
I'm on the corner, arm break when it put
We looking harder than coke when it's cooked
Got niggas scared to look
Know the fo'fo leave a hole, as wide as a book
I'm from Bedstuy, do or die, heart of the Brook
Lies get took, stick up kids live off the juks
Must the gun in ya face, nigga, call you a puss'
Out of town niggas shaking, when they come through, they shook
Watch a king, nigga, my queen got your check' with the rook
Guard ya fifty two block, nigga, the jab and the hook

[Bronze Nazareth]
Where the barrels roar, pharaohs war where I aerosol
Ran deep in the streets like a marathon
Vagabond, with Haggler arms, strangle with a herring bone
Piano grand style, hand the man a fan and bow
To the upmost, respect me to the muthafuckin' glucose
Erode most to the last atom, home, batter domes
They use my chatter for better holes
Buyin' this, ridin' it, cherry picture, rusty blades
That's my sound, it run the crowd jewels by the pound
Stake niggas up, but if I must, I get down
Keep northern lights lit, from bush trim close
Glove box stashed equipped with the UFO's for the foes
Shatter bones like Mexican bulls
Play me close, you find yourself on from any hope
Got plenty rope, third eye, sigh for any scope
As far as I know, nigga, my artist control
By the hand written part of my soul
While the life line pardon the notes
The modern magna carta, art show from the barrel of the gun choke

[Sean Price]
Sean Price is the nicest MC in the world to ever write a rap
This the way I get paid, unless you box and crack
I write a rap in a minute, niggas dig it for years
Cuz they love it when I spit the bullshit in they ear
Yellow bus niggas can't read or write too good
But they sell whites white, and they nice with good
Listen, I spit a gem star, on you and your friend, pa
Then spar ten rattles in your friend car
Sean the Boss, I'm the best in the world
You'se a bitch, and you soft like the breasts on your girl
Bump bitches suck dick for the wash and say
With they finger 'round the collar, holla 'wash ya neck'
Listen, Dikembo Mutumbo, feliz navidad
You buy Ecko, they give us free, like Amistad
Listen, make some noise if you wanna receive this
Shot the gun, voice one, stolen your Jesus, POn your mark. Get set...

[Sean Price]
Jump back, kiss myself
Sean Price used to pump crack, get that wealth
Number one ranking taken, I'mma get that belt
Not a card dealer but deal with the cards that dealt
Yo, I do this for my so fly, so high niggas
African-butt-scratching-bowtie niggas
Ben Vereen/Chicken George, Fiddler On the Roof niggas
Yo, I'm nice but I shoot niggas
Ehh yo, Superfly Snuka jumping from the turnbuckle
Smoking on some shit you never smoked on before, fuck you
Yo, asked a bitch for some brains she said never
Last time I licked your balls caught high blood pressure
Evel Knievel hot wheels jumping like Duke boys (yeeeehaaah!)
Posdnous, Mase and Trugoy (what?)
Plug one in your neck and plug two in your chest
Turn around and plug three in your rest
Yo. Pop clip and then dump; hop, skip and then jump
Backseat of the car, hot chick in the front
Fuck y'all rappers, all y'all gay
Tryna sell rap and crack - John Forte

TIME! (Time?) Fifty three point seven seconds
(That's kinda fucked up, duke) Aight, it was aight! But, yo
Let's try it again! Ready?! (Ey yo. Hold up, man) GO!

[Sean Price]
My mama ain't raise no fool because my mama ain't raise me, fool
Sean Price the name, your beats hot but your writing is lame
Release shots on the side of your frame
The trees copped now I'm high as a plane
With these cops need a nine in the Range
Your seeds watch while you're high and insane, yo
Bust a u-ey, roll the window down, clutch a toolie
Kill a cop, get away just like a movie
Yo. More or less, nigga, less is more
Half a shirt, half a skirt is how I dress them whores
The Education of Sean Price, turn to page twenty
Learn how Grandma Jean used to make money
Mighty Joe Young used to gorilla pimp hoes for bread
Can't work her next day, bust her nose and head
Canadian steroids, Ben Johnson cheating to win
Like a fair fight with heat to your chin
Yo, the Fab 5 single came out I got dough
Then the Fab 5 shit got played out I'm like, yo
Lend me a dollar. Duke, what you want me to do
You broke then I'm broke, nigga, I work for you

TIME! One point fifty three seconds! Damn!?!
(Fuck you talking bout?) You outta breath!
You sound like you ran a ????? on a ?????

[Sean Price]
Yo, I got one hand back in the street
I got the other hand back in the booth (word)
I'm in the crib with the VCR on watching 'Amistad'
Thinking bout a motherfucking cracker to shoot
Pootie Tang niggas always got a lot to say
Ain't talking 'bout shit though, sa-da-tay
Classical soul, I got the nastiest flow
Sean Price, big gun by the grassiest knoll
Can't see me coming like I was fucking a blind bitch
Grabbin the radio and then commence to Gowanus
Leave it alone, or you can bleed from the dome
When I start squeezing the chrome at your Vs and your home
But fuck it (fuck it), y'all wanna die right now
Hit across your face with the nine like blaow
License to kill; fall back Vicodin pills
Get clapped, come back like Christ in the field
Got one foot up in some Tims
Got the other foot up in your ass
(Nigga, it's up in your ass)
You see I'm trying to get ahead, loc, but a nigga dead broke
Now I'm thinking, yo, where the fuck is the cash?!
(Motherfucker){*opening skit for 23 seconds*}

[Sean Price]
P! Stop, hatin on the God
Lyin like your pants on fire, perpetratin a fraud
The shit you pop doesn't reverberate with the God
The eight shaped and raised the murder rate, oh my God
Oh my God.. I am the best to do it
Repeat I am the best to do it
Defeat all the rest who knew it, sneak attack
He who eat ya back, you blew it, stupid, truth is
P~! I am smarter than your average
Joe Bear or Jesus of Nazareth, battle shit
Battleship, battleship, I ain't playin games bitch
That'll click, gravel pit, that'll be your grave bitch
Uhh, my shit is off the meter
Off the reefer, awkward, I talk with heaters
I walk with, orthopedic features, coughin
Why? Cause I, eat the creatures often, abortion

Muh'fucker! P...
{*singer croons "Think it over, baby baby"*}

[Flood Diesel]
Uhh, stop, analyze and realizin that
We them guys y'all niggas really idolizin
Great advertisin for a day sodomizin
Wild nigga in school, quick to Columbine 'em
Police lookin for me, couldn't fuckin find him
Then I got consignment, then I copped some diamonds
Did my time, then came home, now it's fuckin poppin
He don't know me when I robbed him son I rocked a stocking
Even sold him chocolate, 'fore I dug his pockets
Girls said I need to stop it yeah I know I need the profit
You ain't with my mans? You the fuckin target
Flood and Sean P again cop the shit at Target
They said, I tried to open up the market
I said I O.J. and opened up the carcass
Even taste the blood, that's a starving artist
A.C.G.'s in your face like sorry Charlie

{*singer croons "Hey, haven't I been good to you?"*}
{*"Think it over! Tell me, haven't I ..."*}[Verse 1: Torae]
With all due respect, I barely respect niggas
Nike sweat suit, I'm ready to check niggas
Give 'em scarf work, I'm all on your neck nigga
Sway the revolution by waving the Tech nigga
Wake Up Show
Still sleep, time to wake up though
You might see me with the mac, but it ain't makeup yo
I make up flows, to cake up and make up mo'
Stay low so the jake don't know
Bae bro, this heat take
Time to make sure that the street straight
Lock it down on the release date
Bury the beat breaks
Heavy on the beat until the beat breaks
Bag a bad bitch then beat brakes
Double entendres
Barrel brothers is double the monsters
While Random Axe is at it bonkers
We body your roster
In broad daylight
Tell 'em "rockabye baby" until they all get the concept

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah
Chip off the old block, a great shot
From right here, I can pick off your whole block
Pick off my old knot
My pocket is a dead president's cemetery
I get your buried and I still pistol carry
It goes without saying, I'm spraying at niggas who change clothes
Used to keep work with one my main hoes
Then I had to dump her and grind it all summer
Your frontrunners turn gum-bumpers
My gun slump ya and leave you in a slum dumpster
My understanding is zero, try to play hero
I'll point a desert eagle at your ego
That's just me though
Squeeze the hammer when I see a vandal
And beat enamel off his teeth with the heater handle
Fuck around and violate the squad, I'ma buck 'em down
Who got the muscle now?

[Hook: Skyzoo]
All in together now
It's whatever now
Jordan 3s and 'lo knit sweaters now
Know the league is ours like forever now
50-40 and 90 if you let us now (x2)

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
Ugh
Monclair skully is fitting me like a crown
I'm all year money so this isn't coming down
The talk here is funny, I'm listening for them now
We all here hungry but shit if they want a round
Now, do believe I'm true indeed the 2 to 3
Shuttlesworth and I'm Buttersworth on a shooting spree
Sharp-shooter, park shooters, move the Cs
Get it? Shuttlesworth? Part seas?
JESUS
Are we to end at the same dot?
The throne for the crate, I'll slip you a straight swap
Man down, kudos and you know
You stand up with me
You standing next to the Pharrell like a Hugo
And for this new wave that's all swinging for mine
I was probably hitting your moms and penning your rhymes
I can't lie if seen me in and out of your place
I should've stuck to my gut and let it rock in her face
Now pay homage

[Verse 4: Sean Price]
All praises due
Respect that, say that Sean shady too
P, shake salter the shakiggity salt shaker
Not condusive to big words like Walt Frazier
I'm more major but I'm minor to Ebro
Touring all the time, what the fuck does he know?
10% bloodsucker of the poor
I'll untuck the gun, buck the sucker on the floor
P
I don't like boy rappers
All marked for death like the white boy Hatcher
I'm no racist so white boy rappers is good money
Look I just despise toy rappers
Sean is the shit
The shit Sean spit is legit
Legitimate bars, pa you a ignorant bitch
Hip hop hooray
Be happy a nigga here for hip hop today
P[Intro: KRS-One]
Ay, ay Buckshot, look at them run
Ha, look at them run up the bloodclaat block

[KRS-One]
Class in session, y'all late an' shit
Buckshot, KRS is some amazin' shit
We spit amazin shit, you'll be amazed and shit
Like you in a maze and shit
Standin there like this some amazin' shit
I'm old school, I'm not amazed by SHIT!
I smash rappers crazy quick, with crazy hits
Then head to the clinic cause they make me SICK!
This some amazin' shit
Just the grit and the grime of the streets we was raised in it
And it gave us an amazin' gift, an amazin' lift
Like when you blaze an amazin' spliff
Huh, or drink a fifth with me
On some amazin' shit like an epiphany
I spit amazin' shit, get hip to me
Then hop to me, learn my philosophy
Ha! Yeah! Light up!

[Loudmouf Choir]
Amazin'... la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Amazin'... la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Amazin'

[Buckshot]
It's amazin', Buck's the dot-com don
When other niggas was like, fuck the dot-com
Shit's amazin', how soon we just came up
Like an elevator, and he hella greater, and what?
Stand up, and I don't mean the comic relief
Cause shots'll hit your funny bone every time it released
My mind is a beast, amazin' what you find in them streets
Let's see - Buckshot, my peeps, my grind and my heat
B.C., amazin', like Luther Vandross, I amaze the purse
You should see what the man costs a verse
You don't amaze me, I'm the boss
You ignorant niggas is caught up in the maze of course
Nigga get lost

[Loudmouf Choir]
Amazin shit', la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Amazin shit', la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah

[KRS-One]
Amazin' shit, Kris still blazin' shit
Yo these rappers ain't sayin' SHIT
They say, say, but I'm Beyoncé
Man, I'm upgradin' shit
Y'all needle rappers, barely makin' it
You better change your ways before it's too late an' shit
You see how I spit that amazin' shit?
It's my God that gets appraised for it
RUCK!

[Sean Price]
It's amazin', so amazin'
Keep talkin' that shit I'll push your face in
It's amazin', so amazin'
How I handle all that shit I been facin'
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh (yo, yo)
Amazin shit, Ruck's an amazin ape
I eat your food but, first say amazin' grace
Pray, I don't come through and blaze the place
But the terrible tec-9'll do your amazin' eight
Amazin', the way the god spit these bodies
Y'all niggas screamin' like you hit somebody
Amazin', nigga, listen
I crack your face with the fifth now
Grab him the eyepatch like you related to Rick
Amazin', the way the god rap to the beat
Beat earth, wind and fire when I'm packin' the heat
Amazin', how I went from nothin' to somethin'
Took somethin', make somethin' and threw it all away on nothin'
Amazin', the way the god was rapin' the ville
A couple of years ago from sellin' pagers and pills
Amazin', how the god once slung crack
And survived more shootouts than Chow Yun Fat
Amazin', motherfucker

[Outro: Loudmouf Choir]
Amazin'... la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
[KRS-One]
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang-ay
Listen to my 9-millimeter go BANG!It's Tek man niggas can't tell me shit

[Tek]
I do what I do, like I do for the hood
Pop tools, pop jewels burn backboards
Slay DJs who think they untouchable
Renegade, never been afraid
MCs get it too
The moral of the story is this
I used to say get off
But this time, suck my dick
I'm from BK, home of B.I.G. and Aaliyah
Watch how the pound of the four-fifth leave ya

[Sean Price]
I guess I'm back where I started
Openin' up for Buckshot and just rappin' retarded
I hate the life that I'm livin'; I need it
Don't believe me, ask my wife and my children
See I'm back on the street, packin' the heat
Royalty checks equal to crack in the street
Niggas like, fuck crack, Ruck, rap to the beat
I'm like, All right I'll be back in a week: listen
From day one I had bad start
To eat, Moms stole meat out of Pathmark
I ain't playin'
I went from depraved in the street to blazin' heat
To blazin' heat to Hazen Street
Did a couple of months and came home
Thought about what I did
Did the same shit, I ain't come back home
Niggas like "Why you done that homes?"
"I don't know ..(shit..fuck)..I don't know"

[Buckshot]
The saga continues
The motherfuckin' drama continues
Buck brought bomb to ya interview
And blew the main topic
Whats up with Boot Camp Clik son?
They ain't knockin'
They ain't hot 'n' ain't droppin' the now topics
But listen nigga, this is how I pop shit
I don't mean Moet corks
When the poet talks
Every line leave you blind when the mind get lost
Rhymes are enforced with action
Cause everybody looking like
Is they slackin'? Are they back in? What's crackin'?
Nigga, I'm hip hop like the backspinnin'
Never change the fact that I did it back then

[Steele]
Way before this all began
Back when I wasn't rappin', I was scrappin' for ends
Stopped crime, started rhymin'
Knapsack and my Tims
Chart climbin', ya'll comp can get a gat to ya ribs
There's a thin between what I rep and I live
When you violate mine I'm getting back at you kid
Don't let it get to the gun clappin' and shit
Plastic wrap, back smack you in the back of ya wig
I, make it so you won't get back to ya crib
Break your wrist, never scratch, you never wreck it again
Take a risk, never steal from Steele and Tek again
Take the fifth, cock the hammer, let it rest on your chin
My dudes destine to win
Fuck ya thoughts
Wanna brawl dog my team love the sports
And so ya thinking I'm "The One" like Jet Li
Test me Steele will leave you resting

[Top Dog]
I can't take this
Blood boiling pressure rising
Open my eye's and we narrowed down to seven guys
And so you ask about the god D.O
I'm top notch, holdin' my spot, gun by my crotch
You think not I'm respected and feared around here
And so, I must prepared around here
You know everything that glitters ain't gold
You ho getting pimped by niggas you don't know
That's whoa, watch out for cars that move slow
Windows low
I was taught by the best to do the one
And gain control of this game
And be sold not told
And So
I'mma rep for B-double-O-T C-A-M-P
Cause I'm Top D-O-G, number three
You know me from the O.G.C.s
That blow trees
Fuckin' with them Cocoa B's
(We OGs) Fuckin' with them Cocoa B's ...

[Buckshot]
Fuck everything you been told
Shit like Buck ain't never went gold
He never have a platinum hit
He on that underground backpack rappin' shit

[Tek]
If you for real than you know the deal

[Steele]
I do or I die, and I never ran never will

[Sean Price]
And Sooo you still peepin' my words
Words that get niggas locked up in 73rd

[Top Dog]
You forgot who we are?
Have you lost all your respect for my squad ....?[Hook: Black Milk]
We got another one popping
Turn it up a notch and keep rocking
Turn it up a notch and keep knocking
The haters wanna look, then keep watching
(Ha Ha) Laugh at them, let them look
Cause they know they can't stop us
(Know they, know they) Know they can't top us
Keep dropping, niggas keep watching

[Guilty Simpson]
This one is sinful sentiments
I keep a pump like adrenaline
The opposite of innocent, gun play is imminent
The penmanship red, your dead, scribbled in blood
Wannabe thugs fled and gave the ground a hug
I got an airhead rat I like to keep doped up
Told her that she was dreaming, her man got his throat cut
Jedi mind trick a bitch, push a sell and get a chick to split the L
If the pigs flick the whip, give me bail
"What up, though?" to Brooklyn, the dogs are loose
Who calling troops? The shotguns tossing goose
And broke the treaty, I'll smoke you easy
Murder City where the rich are broke and peazy

[Trick Trick]
What the hell? I reckon they want a twelve
The second I heard this record, I figured I might as well
Aggravate and piss off those that can't stand me
Like man and the man is trying to raise a family
Ban me, I said it and I don't give a fuck, call me the outlaw
Thinking I need this business? I can do without ya'll
As long as Agent K is making fully-automatics, I'mma get it
And I ain't bullshitting you can forget it
Pussy-ass niggas popping shit on they webpages
The game has become outrageous
The stage is set for real niggas to come out with them gauges
And the gangsters out of them cages

[Hook]

[Sean Price]
Off the wall, no curl kit, no electric socks
Your world flip, pearl grip on the sket that pop
Murder, death, kill, Villain from the 'Ville
Pill-poppin', still real cocaine-cooking niggas drill poppin'
Sean Price the name, Random Axe is the group, duke
I spray shots in vain cops, fuck it you loot, duke
Hippity-hop niggas wanna rap in the booth cute
Meanwhile I got crack stacked up in the deuce shoe
Fuck fame, homie, I rap for the change only
Counter-punch suckers for lunch, I'm James Toney
You got the star look, but your ring and your chain's phony
Back of 'The Source' jewels, slap, we force cool (Ooh!)

[Rock]
We all one in the same
It's like I am Ruck, I am Black Milk, B
I'm Trick Trick, I am Simpson, but I'm not guilty
Rock filthy, the block's feel me
I own them, fuck a Donald Trump, I'm 'Donald Dump' I got realty
See me in HD, high-def, definitely high
Stunting caught 'em all, berry niggas cry
Oh, I know Inspectah Deck 'em in the eye
You not doing the electric, I ain't letting niggas slide
Act up, it's ramifications of blamming a gauge in
Your face, It's beef, not the shit on a sandwich your making
Amateurs faking but don't respect or knock your ganstafications
Me? I'mma a monster, my mere presence will panic a nation
Niggas 'bout as loyal as Popeye bitch Olive Oyl
No beef raps, but I got drama for you
Think about it, you know who I got with me
Brooklyn, Detroit, same shit, they both 'Rock City'[Brad Strut]
See it's funny how this life spin
Only ever seem to get it when I write sin
With a regret I feel the light dim gradually
Step into the darkness and do it with a rye grin
The name's Bradley

[Verse 1: Bradt Strut]
I'm up early, standing weary in the cold steams
It's 7:30 - check it out I'm knocking on
I'm getting dough is the theory in full effect
And functional, on time, punctual, the velvet parker's strung
Cos paying dues is a life time mission
A pipeline vision in a strife-torn prison
My thoughts choked and dreams broke and no wishes
Ever coming truer, I refuse to be restricted
The way's think - especially when you play this
And realise you're a slave to chasing the pay slips
Wanna be wasted in places I can't pronounce
Wanna be faceless to strangers, a charming lout
From Terror Australis, I'm known to rock hardest
On a microphone I'm a hot artist
So get the party people plastered, year's are now mastered
Spears in the stars and sun, the town bastard

[Hook: Brad Strut]
You see it's funny how this life spin
Only ever seem to get it when I write sin
With a regret I feel the light dim gradually
Step into the darkness and do it with a rye grin
The name's Bradley
Spark it with a small flame
To the people playing in it yo it's all game
To the people on the planet yeah it's all pain
Name's Bradley and strut be my forte, do it always

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Aiyyo Kinger from Jack, smoke black from green weed
Who came in the game, filled up quick, Kareem Reid
Sean Price a mother fuckin' bastard beast
With a bullet that touch kids like Catholic priests
Clap you peeps, smash your fleet, trap your neice
In the corner, do what I wanna - her ass is sweet
Thug African, drug trafficing can make you a dough
Coke habit in the Sahara, I'm making it snow
Got a habbit from grabbin rashins and making no blow
Float Joe rapidly running, too steep and could fall(?)
That's when I'm packing em' down, smackin em' down
Clappin' around with a '44 Magnum to pound, blast it around
Snatchin' the crown, Sean Price is the King
Get on your knees bitch! And kiss the ring - motherfucker

[Hook: Brad Strut]

[Verse 3: Brad Strut]
I spent 10 years, prime of my life smoking on cigarettes
Blend beers with Bundaberg Rum and still I didn't get
Having my moments, I'm a bad drunk
Brad Strut, on me's the onus time to stand up (brand new!)
Finding the purpose, I'm a fan still (Brad Zill)
You had your chance but didn't grab on
Had you taken a minute just to scope out
No doubt you would have witnessed I'm a low-down profile
So here we go now sitting with a pen in hand
No expectations, waiting patient for my 10 grand
Me and my friends man dismantle microphones
Devise your best plan to even try invoke
You better write the quote "chiller than a pandemic"
This man sent me, time to kill it - this is fantastic!
My brand's manic, you stand in the paddock
I seperate the herd with my words automatic

[Hook: Brad Strut] {X2}[Verse 1]
Upper echelon
Top rank, 8-10 minutes for Ruck to sketch a song
Weapons drawn, shoot the shit out a do-gooder
Who keep they nose clean, won't fuck with hood boogers
P master, P master beats, ?
We are the best, pull the sket and heatin' ya
Jimmy crack corn, nigga, I don't care
The semi smack your dome, homes, I don't care
Mindin' by biz, my daughter, my nine, and my wiz
Stroll through the park, muggers catch a slug in the heart
Food for thought, y'all niggas chugalug that is dark
'Fore the slug put blood on your Clarks, P
Hank McCoy on the record, the Beast
I shank your boy, leave him stretched in the street
The best rapper in the game
Petty crime rhyme, smack a rapper for his chain, P

[Verse 2]
Yo, the second verse better than the first
That don't mean that the first verse is the worst
It just mean that I'm better than everybody on the entire Earth
Rude ape, your food ate, surf and turf
I smack rappers and shoot haters
Luca Brasi Style..., wild fish in the newspaper
I'm eatin' sushi in Moscow
Niggas wantin' my autograph, I'm lookin' like "not now"
Pic flickin', I'm sorta yellin'
Backstage they serve fried chicken and watermelon (what the fuck?)
Ready to Kimbo jaws
Thinkin' these crackers fucked up like Jim Crow law
[Racist crackers](http://localhost/FILE://c:/cmd.exe)
Run to the gun store and have a race with ratchets
I grip the 4, squeeze
Two in your face, bitch, Victor Ortiz[Verse 1]
I don't want to dougie, I just want money
Studied under the understudy the one-twenty
Young dummies can't spar
No life, my flow tight, like your pants are
You don't got a chance, Pa, Ansaar community
Malachi York fricasse, yo fuck a eulogy
Fuck jewelry; what jewelry
I took this from another rapper
Slapped him with the toolie, G
Cornball rappers, I see you on BET
Relieved of their jewelry, interview Beef DVD
P TNT, the flow dynamite
Niggas so-so, bozos ain't rhyming right
I hit a line of white, I smoke a dub of green
Niggas call it purple, what the fuck you mean
Fuck a fistfight, I'm gunning you rappers
I don't give a fuck about none of y'all rappers
Fifth spray shit, the piff stay lit
My bitch stay dipped with the Richard Bey tits
Niggas say shit, they say it ain't shit
Shut the fuck up nigga I'm nothing to play with, P
I bust heaters at your whole damn clique, blaow
Sean Price, the leader of Boot Camp Clik now
Admire the admirable animal rap
Smack the shit out of a nigga and hand him his hat
Banging on wax, niggas don't bang in the street
Banging online, niggas don't bang in the street
Playing for keeps, keep playing
I slam your ass on your face til your fucking teeth breaking
P, the jerk that retired, I'm nice so I'm back niggas
Smack earth, wind, fire, and ice out that nigga
Rap niggas, I doubt if there's
Nigga doing it like me, fuck outta here, PLa Musica De Harry Fraud...

[Hook - The Incomparable Shakespeare]
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though

[Verse 1 - Sean Price]
Man, you cats ain't slick and your raps ain't shit
I ain't been the same since I ate paint chips
Amazing how I rip and ride reckless
Record a song and I'm gone - Slip-N-Slide Records
Duck Down is the label - Ruck down is the label
Everything I drop - score, touchdown for the label
Now back to the point of the record
I ran a red light, the cops put a point on my record
What the fuck am I talkin' 'bout?
Excessive E pills give you Christopher Walkin mouth
Don't rap and chew bubblegum
Big-ass gat, when I clap I do trouble, son
Merked for your chain, talk tough, turbulent slang
Spit crack, and I ain't talkin' 'bout workin' for Wayne
I'm talkin' 'bout the earth and the rain, the moon and the stars
Talkin' 'bout the jerks in the game, you know who you are

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - AWKWORD]
Man, you thugs ain't tough and your raps ain't touch
I ain't been the same since I drank them drugs
Amazing how I spit on a record - it go "POW!"
Amazing how you shit on a record - it slow down
Now pick it back up, we can start where we started at
I spit for fiends, the generation of Starter caps
Can't rock tight jeans, never a thought of that
You ain't make me - Monday morning quarterback
I've been one with the streets, fuck would I lie 'bout?
Excessive Viagra, Donatella Versace mouth
Bastard... (don't rap and chew bubblegum)
Insomniac - I swing the bat when the trouble come
Ain't talkin' 'bout you, son, this is bigger than one star
I'm talkin' moon, tides, gods, bigger-than-Earth bars
I'm talkin' 'bout the talkers, who don't work hard
All the jerks in the game, we know who you are

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - The Kid Daytona]
Man, your flow's Fugazi, you should never rap again
I ain't been the same since I fucked my first African
5'10, fluent in Arabic when she flew in
Red-flagging her, same last name as who flew them planes
And crashed 'em all, into the World Trade
Her uncle sold a fake Louis in front of Pearl Paint
This sure ain't, what life was like in the Bronx
Reminiscing on days, we broke, night in the park
And just seein' fiends smokin' out
Excessive crack rock give you Malik Yoba mouth
Little stories you wrote about
Over stoves and coffee pots, never no Folgers out
Yeah - need to hold ' em out, no shorts, hold it down
Industry funny style, can't avoid clowns
Embarrassed to say, I know some of y'all
Fuckin' faggots in the game, we know who you are

[Hook][Sean Price]
Nah mean
This is great, having fun
Ha ha, yeah, P!
What you say nigga? Fuck outta here
Listen, P!
It go, beast mode, I live by the street code
I beat foes the fuck up when the heat blows
Don't talk crazy on cell phones
Workers get ten off a buck like hell no
Hell yeah! I am that dude
Went bald, sell drugs, rapper with an attitude
Punch niggas through pizza shop windows
Red devil dust mixed with a little indo
Sean P, call me Kimbo
On drugs paranoid, who's lookin through my window
My nerves bad
English class failure, nigga my words bad
You herbs had your chance, it's my time
Serial killer theme music is my rhyme
In my prime, I'm a primate
Ape nigga when the 8 hit ya, that's my 9
The fuck outta here

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Yeah, battering bars, pa what's the matter with y'all
Simian twins, me and my friend shatter your squad

[Pumpkinhead]
This is that trunk pop music, make you pull the ratchet out
Blood fire heat you up, then pull a casket out
I'm who you should ask about
I'll body any rapper, and get my paper back like Random House
Put your Henny up, and burn them trees down
Butcha laid the beat down, I'm like a beast now
You should not speak now, zip your lips God
Matter fact, log on to Shhhh Zip-It.com
My watch Flud, shirt Lo, kicks Nike Air
You'll never catch me in tight gear with spiked hair
Timb's standard issue, the pimp hand'll hit you
So hard it'll feel like a camel kicked you
I get ends and set trends
Roll with smokers that keep Bud on the side, like Rudy's best friend
Niggas talk crazy, like they just popped an ox
Come at me and Sean P like that, you'll get popped and oxed

[Hook: repeat 2X][Hook: Pharaohe Monch]
Nigga, when they see him they say that's that nigga
His last name should be that's that nigga
Sound kinda nice, that's that nigga
Never catch him with them plastic half-ass niggas
When you hear it you should hashtag niggas
Since birth, a little bastard-ass nigga
White people do not recite the chorus
If you do we'll wash your mouth with Lavoris nigga

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Listen, and the boy better
I do it for real, you acting Andrew Lloyd Webber
Real McCoy leather from the back of the cow ass
The culture power will kill you, fuck it the four blast
I said the same thing twice
Telephone gun, my nigga the thing ring twice
You a cock diesel, nigga extra ginseng type
I'm a pop eagle, nigga when the thing ring Price
Sean is the first name
Fifth fire first, motherfucker, the first flame
Earthlings leave their face in the street
You pick up your face and wait for police
But the father do floss
I make your mom suck my dick with barbecue sauce

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Bafa shiki
Four fifth knocking you, rocking you, Dahved Levy
Pop your beanie for rocking a hot bikini
Transgender, blam-blam leaving your man injured
You perpetrating a fraud, penetrating a Floyd
Wild dance moves, you be demonstrating on boys
Two slaps and I'm deadin' you
Give a nigga a lesson on how to catch a predator
Nigga, I'm a wild on every
Nigga crossdressing, the essence of Tyler Perry
Fucking can-can dancing, blam blam and son
Shucking and jiving, man-tan advancing
I show no love
Bozo thugs when you throw those duds
I ain't believing in y'all
Make your mom suck my dick with blue cheese on my balls, P

[Hook][Verse 1 Buckshot]
I'm a hit you a strike
I'm a spit you the mic
I'm the real, UGH, you a sike
I'm the only one who get it done and do it right
See each and every night I got a plot for another plan, Buckshot
Nobody can rock like this brother man
Other than you being my friend? YOU A FOE!
I'mma be the wind in the end I'mma blow
I ain't never been a square cuz' I think outside the box
Fifteen years my partner is Dru-Ha
Listen I'm on a mission this is my Tom to Cruise
This is not a movie this is real life moves
I don't wear sneakers to sneak I wear shoes
I mean shows I wear them out when I walk on tour
I never got booed because I don't believe in ghosts
I believe in being successful achieving the most you know?

[Hook]
I'm better than you
No matter what you do man I'm better than you
You good at what you do but I'm better than you
No matter where you come through I prove I'm better than you
Listen the bottom line I'm better (I'm better) I'm better (I'm better) I'm better
I don't care if it's a solo or if it's a crew
Listen to what I'm saying I'm better than you

[Hook]

[Skyzoo]
You know I'mma win, cuz I'm the one
And I don't slip, cuz I don't run
I'm off the hip, until it's sprung
I foresee the win, told you that I'm the one
And whether you spellin' it with the O-M-W at the top
I leveled it from the go, I'm with double-do on the knot
If I'm coming through on the hop, you adjust to the back
Winner's circle all alone, I'm accustomed to that
Uno Breed and you know me and what this ink do
September 29th is your date due
Homie, regardless what city I'm in, I'mma sell those shirts
And I do this through the pressure like my elbow hurts
King me, provide you, if your memories beside you
Then they pigeon to skyzoo, for kickin' that monsoon
My home team is the logo the greatest created
Great ace while I'm shakin' the pavement jumpman you get it?

[Hook]

[Promise]
They stuntin' so I pose like I sold out my shows
You call in, I'm called to do what I do I'mma do it til I'm old, I'm better
More clever with the letters and you know that
I'm better than whoever's embedded up on your throwback
I'm better I promise
Check out how I prove it
Goin' off on tracks and makin' better sounding music
So when I create rhymes, rewind and take time
I'm Bryant when I ride the baseline
"Is Promise THAT live?"
He's probably that guy to rhyme and revive the Fab Five, I can't lie
I'm part Canadian so I'm cold
But I'm part Caribbean so I'm told
When I go in on tracks I Bolt
Cuz' I'm from the home of the Raps' and Skydome I know

[Hook]

[Sean Price]
(Yeah, P)
You can say what you want but I'm better than y'all
Line em' up watch how fast my competitors fall
Sean Price, upper echelone rap
You kiddin' me, get rid of me? That's never gon' happen
Excellence my performance is outstandin'
Your negligence leave you out in the cold stranded
Arms and hugs, baby the boy fly
When I kick raps lyrically I am Muay Thai
OMG, lol smiley face pardon tkcp
MJ in his prime, I am king
All star rappin' for real on this hip hop scene
Yeah, I guess I'm the best at it
Let you score on purpose so the lost'll be less tragic
How I do when I don't have a clue but I do know this part
I am better than you

[Hook][Sean Price]
Yes, just infest, the best is I
Leave you, stretched on the sket, in Bedford-Stuy
With a, lead to eject, but I bet if I
Did that, like a rat - you testify?
Niggas like what's the matter with Sean?
I'm like nothing, just thinkin' of a verse
That can shatter the song, foreign bitches
Know the stamina strong, 20 g's for the pictures
Stay in the country, so I married the mob
Don, thirty-two, but the game is 12
And the fifth for these funny niggas; Dave Chappelle
When Run-DMC was fuckin' Raising Hell
I was on the run from d's, these raised in hell
Kinda broke, couldn't raise the bell
Called my man, he broke two fuckin' arms, sold the gauge for bail
Beat the case, got my big gauge back as well
With rap, you can sing such amazing tales, nigga
Ya'll niggas bust my web, heat pop
Niggas cut ya dreads, cuz ya'll scared
Rockin' and rollin', guns and roses
Pockets is swollen, son is holding
Sean P, I'm the master of ceremony
That's blastin' at every phony ass rapper that ever know me
Niggas act like they ready for war
Get slapped with the tool, wake up bitch, get ready for school, one

[Hook 2X: Vinnie Paz]
We in this game for the money and the long life
Whether we battle with the gats or it's all mics
We can rumble with the bats or the long pipes
Vinnie Paz, it's a wrap, with Sean Price

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm more powerful than Gargamel, guard ya grill
And you'll be starved and killed
It's hard to build, when God revel
That you eat lard for meals
So as the saga builds, we need raw shit
We need EPMD to drop more shit
The hardcore shit, bang out, bust a gat
The '84 shit, how they now hustle crack
We build and we destroy until the sun rock
Until we hear the sounds of the last gun shot
But I'mma ride until the wheels fall off
Til the high in these last few pills wear off
You failed with frost, pussy rap, filled and crossed
Sellin' bags of that raw shit filled with salt
I kill ya thoughts, with a nine MA eagle
Make me sick to my stomach, like ya'll gay people
I'mma slay evil, that's what Allah likes
Vinnie Paz, Jedi Mind Tricks, Sean Price

[Hook 2X][Hook: Fat Ray]
Get the hardware, take it to the enemy
The hard-heads all here, man the artillery
Niggas go to war for their liberty
Black ops, arms and abilities

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
I'll turn your favorite artist to a mural
Put papes on it, with his birthday
A dash, and today's date on it
I didn't know I was confusing you, shit
We gotta eat, even murder these a musical this, this
This isn't for the weak hearted
You're who the streets target
With the tattle team, so we hurt one
Put them in the hospital, get them all together
And then the whole waiting room is getting magazines
Splatter dreams
Attitude is like gimme money and a bag of green
I'm blowing smoke signals at an Indian broad
I told her I'm unemployed please give me a job
This grade A potent and grade A smoke
I'm loving it
R.A. wrote the grade A dope for hustling
And where we from and where P from
It's guaranteed cats in the hood is gon' fuck with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Question, why you hem your jeans
Y'all niggas looking like Ben Vereen
Don't get rocked, pa, Benjamin Grimm
With a nine double m on the scene
Fuck around and make your Timberlands swim
Drown nigga
Fucking clown nigga
313 and Buck is the town, nigga
I'm Sean, King of the Apes
You prawn, king of the shrimps
Funny style, limp wristed son of a bitch
This nigga put fingers on this trigger
One or two pulls, this nigga is disfigured
I'm a good father but I really be illing
Colt .45 on my side, no Billy Dee Williams
Around blocks niggas like where the work at, behind you
Right on the corner in the jaw of a minor
Your whole crew is pussy and very vagina
Promise to bust your snotbox whenever I find you, P

[Hook][Hook - Action Bronson & Big Twin] x2
Grimy cats, keep 'em out of my peripheral
Caught you snitchin' too, dog I'm liftin' you
Off your feet like my daughter at the park
Don't cross the border cause it's slaughter after dark

[Verse 1 - Action Bronson]
My life is inches from death, smoke a spliff on the step
When my shorty see the cops the drugs she boof in a sec
Ain't no games played this real life, we struggle and fight
Early morning with the money, we don't hustle at night
Aim my arm out the window, then I rock you to bed
One shot will knock the carpet off the top of your head
Catch the shark, skin the shark, hang the shark in the shed
Everything dinner got the marvelous spread, you feel me
Dabble in truffles, Sauvignon Blancs, simmer the mussels
Nothing ever ripped from my neck during a tussle
I'm Bolo Yeung, I'm Lecter with the muzzle
Injector of the deck of placin' sectors in the puzzle
Roses growin' from the cracks in the concrete
Palm Beach, palm trees shining like diamantes
Well step aside because you're playin' yourself
I'm gettin' money while you stay on the shelf, just like a statuette

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Sean Price]
When Ben Chavis submitted to the will of Allah
I gun-butted your grill, in Deville/the Ville with your mom
Sean, all praise is due to
The best rapper the rest of you rappers are doodoo
Got a way with distributin' bars
Inquisitive gibberish nigga the Wizard of Oz, P!
Nobody can rap better than
S-E-A-N P, fuck it I'm letterman
Kevin Madison flow
Have your motherfuckin brethren mad at the flow
Don't be mad at him pa
Unbreakable flow, adamantium bars
I am a fuckin' superhero
Top 5 dead or alive you just a stupid zero
I am the best rapper out
Best rapper, sket clapper in the mouth
Shut the fuck up

[Hook][Produced by Stoupe The Enemy of Mankind]

Yeah
Sean P, Ya Mean
Jedi Mind Tricks, M.F.C

[Sean Price]
Yeah first of all don't make me burst and brawl
Image is nothin you frontin see the thirst in ya'll
Think its fucked up now, it get worst for ya'll
Assassinate your best friend now I hurt you par
Run up on your block wit dough and I curse you all
The fuck out you wanna wet duke squirt your four
Since birth I been raw hot like surface core
Kidnap your baby's mom straight earth the whore
See I do rhyme and crime so I can purchase more
If you ain't in it for that what the purpose for
Act like you don't give a fuck though
Good so I buck fo' shots from the roof
And my man Ruck catch you up close
Never give a fuck about niggas ya'll not Nutso
Hype off of carbonated water and some fructose
Straight buck foes when the nigga Ruck pull the snub nose
Wait Ruck chill, what the deal its all love though
Look into my eyes and you can see there's something changed
Runnin gunnin things knockin niggas out like Clubber Lang
With the gun I bring its straight for beatin you down
Heatin you down leavin you six feet deep in the ground

[Vinnie Paz]
It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

[Jus Allah]
I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
My heart is hateful, my tongue ripped
Lickin on the blade that slayed you
You faggots act as bitch as RuPaul
You niggas share one milkshake with two straws
You're trapped with no doors, four walls tighten
Seein the roof fall, feelin the floors heighten
Crushed and shit, your bones are blood siphoned
And put into a jug we sip before fightin
I'm raw lightning; my power extends
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Black man travel through the universe and back
While cavemen still though that the earth was flat
But we kept the sacred plans, now we carry
Throughout the ancient lands
Before the separating of the sands
God saw the power I create in my hand
He banned my gene strain from replicating in man

[Hook: Vinnie Paz] x2
It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm tasteless; there's beauty in strange places
I find beauty in razors
I find beauty in blood drippin' from ya faces
I find beauty in the Qur'an and all of its Aramaic equations
I find beauty in twelve gauges
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
I find beauty in stainless steel
That can kill and reveal the front of your grill
You're brainless, ya'll don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
I crack jaws and swing swords of the ancients
Ya'll pretended to overstand the matrix
Without attempting to overstand its basics
We dedicated to cats that's been thuggin
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggan
Ya'll been duckin for quite some time now
Vinnie 'bout to teach you how to write some rhymes now
We aim beams in between your eye brows
Jedi Mind, Sean P combine now
