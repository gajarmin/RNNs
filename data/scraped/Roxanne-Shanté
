[Verse 1]
Some people call me Shanie, some people call me Rox
And those who try to diss I just knocks them out the box
Cos I'm Shante and y'all know the routine
And here we go again, so all hail the queen
I left you for a while but it was worth the wait
Because it gave me just enough time to create
A funky rhythm that's guaranteed to move the world
Have the party people screaming out, "Go on Girl!"
Just like Diana Ross, I'm the boss
And those who disapprove you can go for yours
But to think a girl like me, ha, is easy to take
You should treat me like Nell Carter, give me a break
Cause I'm the super female that's called Shante
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

[Verse 2]
A lotta MCs today really know how to please
But I gave birth to most of them MCs
So when it comes around to the month of May
Send me your royalty check for Mother's Day
Because yo, ya know, ya can't deal with this
I'm Shante the microphone grandmistress
A pioneer like Lola Folana
With a name that stands big like Madonna
Speaking of Madonna, some girls on the mic
Rap like virgins and get real tight
But I get loose with the rhymes I produce
That's why I'm queen of the crew with the juice
Cos I'm the super female that's called Shante
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

[Verse 3]
Shante, the baddest around
And a name like that can be broken down
As Supreme Highness Almighty Noble Topics Exponent
And any title for a girl, you can believe I own it
Cause to me there ain't nothing fresher
For me to rock..my pleasure
I'll pick up the microphone and start rocking
Say the funky rhymes that have the people clocking
Me, the S-H-A-N-T-E
Good looking, never tooken female MC
I'm five foot four, maybe a little bigger
Brown skin complexion with a nice figure
Yes, the super female that's called Shante
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

[Verse 4]
You may remember the voice from a few years ago
When I first came out and dissed UTFO
I chilled for a while, I put down my pen
But now some suckas from the Bronx got me started again
Now I'm not out to diss the whole Boogie Down
Just a featherweight crew from that part of town
You made a little record and then you start fronting
Tried to diss the Juice Crew but ain't hurt nothing
Now KRS-ONE, you should go on vacation
With that name sounding like a wack radio station
And as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed
When T La Rock said "It's Yours", he didn't mean his name
So step back, peasants, popping all that junk
Or else BDP will stand for Broken Down Punks
Cause I'm an All-Star just like Julius Erving
And Roxanne Shante is only good for steady servingWell, my name is Roxanne, a-don't ya know
I just a-cold rock a party, and I do this show
I said I met these three guys, and you know that's true
A-let me tell you and explain them all to you:
I met this dude with the name of a hat
I didn't even walk away, I didn't give him no rap
But then he got real mad, and he got a little tired
If he worked for me, you know he would be fired
His name is Kangol, and that is cute
He ain't got money, and he ain't got the loot
And every time that I see him, he's always a-beggin'
And all the other girls that he's always tryin' to leggin'
Every time that he sees me, he says a rhyme
But, see, compared to me it's weak compared to mine
A-every time I know that I am sayin' somethin' fresher
In any category I'm considered the best
And every time that I say it there ain't nothin' less
And everybody knows I will win the contest
So, then, after that came the Educated Rapper
His fingers started snappin', and my hands start to clappin'
Every time-a that I see him, everything he say
A-every time he says, he says it dumber this way:
He said-a, "Yeah, you know your mother's name is Mary,"
But all he want to do is just-a bust a cherry
Every time that I see him, he's sayin' somethin' new
But let me explain to him what he should do:
He should be like me, a fly MC
Don't never have to bite, we're always right
I have the freshest rhymes that I do recite
And after that, and you know it's true
Well, let me tell you somethin' else about the Doctor, too:
He ain't really cute, and he ain't great
He don't even know how to operate
He came up to me with some bullshit rap
But let me tell you somethin' cause you know it was wack
So when he came up to me, I told him to step back
He said, "You call yourself an MC?" I said, "This is true,"
He said, "Explain to me really what MCs must do."
I said, "Listen very close cause I don't say this every day:
My name is Roxanne, and they call me Shanté."
But every time-a I say a rhyme-a just-a like-a this-a
It's something that you MCs just won't-a miss-a
And if you think it's cute-a, and you think it's all right
But, see, you said it in a language so you wouldn't have to bite
You started talkin' Pig Latin, didn't make no sense
You thought you was cute, yeah, you thought you was a prince
You're walkin' down the block, holdin' your jock
But everybody knows that you're all on my yacht
I'm just the devastatin', always rockin', always have the niggas clockin'
Everybody knows it's me, yeah, the R-O-X-A-N-N-E, yeah
Down with everybody fresh and everyone that I possess
And every time I do it right-a, everyone is sure to bite-a
Every time I do it, yeah, you know it is-a me-a
Rockin' on the beat-a that you can see
And every time I have a DJ like Ice
He ain't right, yeah, he ain't nice
Because a-everything he does is off-the-wall
Compared to my man Marley Marl
The way he gets on the tables, yes
Everyone knows that he is fresh
So, the UTFO crew, you know what you can do
Lemme tell you one for me, and then I'll tell you one for you
Every time you sayin' somethin' just-a like-a this-a
It ain't nothin' that I don't want to miss-a
And if you're thinkin' that I'm bitin' your beat
Well, then you just better know, and a-listen to me
Because my name is Roxanne-a, and I came to say
I'm rockin' to the beat-a, and I do it every day
I'm conceited, never beated, never heard of defeated
I'm rockin' to the beat-a, and you know it is-a me-a:
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E-a
And if you want to play a little game for me
Lemme show you what you can do, baby
Cause with a twist of my cheek, and a twist of my wrist
I have all the niggas droppin' down like this
Yeah, I am fly but don't take this
And everybody knows I don't go for it
So, if you're tryin' to be cute and you're tryin' to be fine
You need to cut it out cause it's all in your mind
Tryin' to be like me, yeah, is very hard
You think you are God, but you do eat lard
Tryin' to be cute, and you're tryin' to be fly
Don't you know you wish you could be my guy?
So I can take you home, make you relax
And everybody knows that you're out there, tryin' to tax
Like corn-on-the-cob, you're always tryin' to rob
You need to be out there, get yourself a job
Yeah, you're tryin' to be in search of a Roxanne
But lemme let ya know--you're not a real man
Cause a Roxanne needs a man, and yes:
Someone fresh who always address
Someone, yeah, who will never fess
And then I'll say, yeah, the rest
Cause everybody knows how the story goes
There's no ifs, no ands, no buts, or suppose
No coke up your nose, no dope in your vein
And then it won't cause no kind of pain
But yet, and still, you're tryin' to be fly
I ask you a question, I want to know why:
Why'd ya have to make a record 'bout me
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E?

("Roxanne, Roxanne, ["Oh, my goodness!"]
I want to be your man
Roxanne, Roxanne
And here's our game-plan!")[Scratch]
I don't care who's first or who's last
But I know that y'all better just drop this
At the dro-dro-drop of a dime ba-----baby

[Scratch]
Crai-Crai-Craig G light up the mic
Craig-Craig-Craig-Craig
Craig G light up the mic
Craig G light up the mic for The Symphony

[Verse One: Craig G]
Ahh, Politics & Bullshit got me hectic
Let me show y'all new rappers how to do a posse record
Craig G-I, with the Frankie C
U-T-L-A-Double-S, MC's get trouble
Best I flow with the the swiftness, never
However new MC's pulled the lever, my style's much better
Anyone can be a victim
Empty tracks I lick sick em
I flip em rip em and strip em of all of they pride
As I slide, in out of these states I stay great
What the G stand for, I'm slammin you and your
Whole staff, style, split an atom in half
East Coast, West Coast, don't make me laugh!
The whole America feels my wrath, ahh!
It's like a terrier was on that ass, ahh, yeah!
Cause nine-six ain't about jack shit
Fuck Versace, I'm like Rocky when I'm bustin' your lip
Bust these metaphors, for better or worse
My style burst
Your grill into itty-bitty pieces
As I release, my thesis
Uhh, Craig G, I believe that's me
Ninetenn-eighty-five til infinity, ahhh

[Scratch]
Shante!
Sha-sha, sha-sha, sha-sha, sha-sha
Shante!
Shante! The baddest around

[Verse Two: Roxanne Shante]
Hey yo, you're lost in the sauce, bitches still remain
Useless, but when I reign bitches can't sustain
The drama, word to momma, bitch I leave you leakin'
Roxanne Shante stay creepin'
You sleepin' but I stay armed, and dangerous
No matter what your name is, bitch I make you famous
A lot of bitches swear shit's sweet
But when I creep I'mma lace you from your head to your fuckin' feet
Frankie Cutlass put me on so I'm back again
Ain't nothin changed it's still the same
Ain't no smilin' friend
I remember eighty-seven, eighty-eight
I was the only one gettin' weight from upstate
Gettin cake, Juice Crew All-Stars was my boys
Runnin round town baby makin' mad noise
Backtrack turn back the page
Live on stage, wreckin' niggas at a early age
I was only fifteen thinkin' big time
At the time blind, all my eyes saw was gold mine
So all you fake Cristal sippin' bitches
Here's a thirty-eight bitch, click it!
I didn't think so...

[Scratch]
I be the Biz Markie
Biz-biz-biz
I be the Biz Markie
Biz Markie, aoooowwwwwww!

[Verse Three: Biz Markie]
Hey hey hey, I'm the eMmmaZah-A
Igga-R-Rrahidy-iZza-Rrahzah-K
I don't have a big mouth, just a lot to say
So listen to my rhythm and rap display, OK
I rock the mic to the T-O-P
And every record that I make, I make history
Like a-oh-oh-oh, WHA-OHH! ah-one two
Is some of the things that I used to do, but
Right about now I got a different flow
I rock from New York City to Mexico
From England, Australia, back to Japan
They know I'm Mista Magic Cool with the mic in my hand
So, you know I got more rhymes than Muhammad Ali
That's why my name rings bells internationally
Never neglected well protected as an MC yet
I'm, super duper with the rhymes I invent
Big Daddy Kane, you know you're part of the staff
Get on the mic, get on the mic god damnit
Get on the mic on my behallllllllllllllllllllf, waaoooowowwww!!

[Scratch]
The-the-the name Kane is superior to many people

[Verse Four: Big Daddy Kane]
Tell me what you see, and uhh, vectorize
When you, check your eyes, baby, recognize, it's the
Rawest chump to make the verse in the chorus bump
With rhymes skills to be retarded like Forrest Gump
Now feel the pain runnin' through your chest area
Thoughts of the attack it got you fearin' the
Bodily abuse, that you phony niggas makin' me produce
Warfare put to use, fuck all that, just turn me loose
Huh, and this is for those who don't know the half
I want to see just how well you know your math
Now, in case a nigga want to get out of line
Just tell me how many times does sixteen go into nine
See, a lot of you rappers like to front as if you're ruthless
But, when I'm around you make all kind of excuses
Like, I just remembered, yo, my niece need diapers kid
Plus I got homework, bible-study, all types of shit
Boo-yaka, any fuckin' tune to ya
King Asiatic, tell me what we gonna do wit ya
One more thing, the next example one of you niggas is bout to be it
Now close your eyes tight cause trust me you don't want to see itBrothers ain't shit
They lookin' for the next big ass they can stick
But this here chick's not on your dick
Pulling your cars up close by the sidewalk
And got the nerve to get mad if I don't talk
Stay schemin' on how they wanna stick it from the back
A young muthafucka sellin' crack
Go home and go to bed son
Your just coming from the barber shop and tryna' get your head done
Take your ass downtown on 10th Avenue
Because a sister like me is not having you
Playa, going round tellin' other brothers that you laid her
So I guess I'll see your ass later
Some brothers approach you while your shopping
Their girl's not around so they're going ho-hopin'
From one girl to another
You turn your head for a minute, he's tryna kick it to your mother
Stop smilin'
I know all you wanna do is hit
And I really don't give a shit
They get mad cause I always look serious
So they swear I'm on my muthafuckin' period
I'm not impressed by the jewelry and the mink, dummy
Why don't you put some of your money in the bank, sonny
And if I hurt your feelings, I meant to
Cause these here pants, huh, you can't get into
Matter of fact I'm tooken'
So you brothers in the jeep can keep lookin' but I ain't hookin'
Yes I'm giving you the slip
All you can do is trick
Word
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit

I'm on my way to the mall with a couple of friends
Some niggas pull up in a blue benz
A kid named Mark with dark glasses
Talkin' about 'Yo, y'all got some real fat asses'
I kept walkin'
Tracy stopped and started talkin'
With all these motherfuckers hawkin'
With that dumb looking grin
Bitch gets in the car that was carrying three men
I know the whole game well
They spend a little money, you end up at a hotel
Well that's how they planned it
She didn't wanna screw so they left her ass stranded
That's what she get for whilin'
Cold left the dumb bitch somewhere out in long island
Next time she'll act decent
And her moms won't have to come and get her ass from a precinct
Remember Shanté told you
Drugs is not the only thing a girl can say no to
You gotta watch every move that you make on the street
Word up, cause talk ain't that cheap
It may become a bad habit
You see a brother with a little bit of dough, you wanna grab it
I get approached by a man sometimes, I throw a fit
Word
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
So don't honk your horn keep rolling
No I don't wanna ride cause the shit might be stolen
Anyway, I know your number
You got a gas, grass or ass sticker on your bumper
Go ahead and say I'm stuck up
Cause I ain't doin nothing that'll make my rep. fucked up
Cause it happens to the best of us
Fuck the rest of us
Niggas keep testing us
A man can make you wanna kill him
Or late at night, make you wanna thrill him
He'll give you money, you can even be fly
But he still has to cheat and you wanna know why
That's the dog in him, 'woof, woof!'
That makes him get up in the middle of the night and go 'POOF!'
You say 'Yo, yo where you going?'
He's cheating and he's skeezing and your not even knowing
But this is what they usually do
Suck on the ting and they make you go 'WOO!'
And then he hits the door
And for the rest of the night you don't see him no more
He's got shit at your house, here's what you do
You should do some voodoo, hmm
Make his dick small
Make him see spiders on the wall
Then make him throw a fit
Why?
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit[Verse 1]
Save all the drama
Cause here comes the Big Mama
Any bitch who rip Shante, I bomb her
Cause y'all weak-ass hoes got me fed up
So hookers, get your gloves, and yo, let's go head up
Wall to wall y'all, all will fall
I don't stall cause in this brawl, it's winner takes all
A title bout for all the clout
Any hooker trying to step to this, it's lights out
One hit, your head split, throat slit
Think you're Miss It, but I started this shit
At 14 years old I was going gold
While I was on tour, you was touring the ho stroll
Sucking dicks and turning tricks to get a quick fix
While I was putting dope hits in the mix
Ripping shows with Kane and Biz Markie
Fucking up Roxanne and taking out Sparky
Niggas came in flocks from blocks and blocks
To watch the Rox knock bitches out the box
And every place I played, I headlined
Strictly big names on the topic read mine
The q-u-double e-n
Queen of emceeing
Whenever I flow it's poetry in
Motion, so you can save all the drama
And get the fuck out the way, here comes the Big Mama

[Hook]
(Mama - mama - Aww!)
(I gave birth to most of them MC's)

[Verse 2]
Rhymes are deadly, so hooker, write out your will
Here comes the queen foot-first to your grill
Reciting poems that hit like boulders
Smacking your head dead off your motherfucking shoulders
So nip all the talk in the bud
This ain't no game, boy, I came to draw blood
At any hag thinking that she could last with me
It only takes one blast, and that ass'll be
Wrecked, ruined, damaged, ripped
Cross my path, your ass'll get whipped
Cause Shanté ain't about no games
Matter of fact, yo, I'mma start calling off names
First up is Latifah
You roll up, and I'mma smoke that ass like reefer
Cause you ain't never in life been a star to me
Sold the fuck out trying to go R&B
Now that shit is shady
You say ladies first, well I'm the first lady
And all y'all hoes are phony
Try to get flipped, I'mma rip you and your girl Monie
You're illegitimate, tryin to get a little bit
And I'm about sick of that 'Monie-in-the-middle'-shit
Your album cold garbage
Had one good jam, now you think you a star, bitch
Breaking your neck trying to be in the limelight
But give you a mic, and you can't even rhyme right
So get the fuck off the scene
Cause I got a M-16 that says 'Shante's the queen'
And all you bitches got your style from me
The capital S-h-a-n-t-é
Used to go to my show, analyze how the sound flow
On the down low, fuck around, lay around, ho
So save all the drama
And make room for the Big Mama

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The real queen's in effect
Whenever I come, yo, I come correct
And niggas give me the utmost due respect
And any hag that try to last
'll cold get smoked like marijuana cause her ass is grass
I dig ditches for you bitches
While I collect riches and give you a head full of stitches
Cause in a beef I don't sleep or lollygag
Sending you hags off-stage in a bodybag
Cause Shanté is a rebel
You say you're lyte as a rock, you get crushed like a pebble
One word, and I'mma bag her
Watch the bitch stagger, cause I don't dig the bulldagger
To me a butch don't deserve a mic in hand
Somebody tell her to stop acting like a man
She needs something real thick to help her out quick
(What?) And that's a good piece of dick
Now as for that West Coast slut
With fake-ass hair, contacts, and a padded butt
Instead of "stompin to tha 90s", use your brain
And stomp your ass down to Jack LaLane
You better hurry and hop on a diet plan
And keep the pork chops out the frying pan
Yeah, I said it, so what?
You roll up, slut, you get a fucking gun buck to your gut
I'm bringing tears to all my peers
I ain't new, I been doin this shit for ten years
Bring any ho, and I'll wreck her
I rip the nicest, from Isis down to Salt-N-Pepa
And now you know that I'm the star of the show, ho
While I get dough, you're giving up the yo-yo
You say a nigga can't play with it
You got another job? Well bitch, you better stay with it
Cause you ain't shit in this here
Shanté's the queen, and I'm making it clear
Kicking flavors the way it's supposed to be
That's why no other emcees coming close to me
I leave em all in the dust
From crumbs to crust
It's a must that all opponents get bust
So get the fuck off the stage and save all the drama
And make room for the Big Mama

[Hook][Kool G Rap]
Deadly rhymes the pages of rage strikes again
Killing men, women and children
Til defeat, types of shelter, helter skelter
Nobody's around here to help ya

[Shante]
Up in flames, the brainstorm rain drains your veins
The only remains is rains of brains
Fixed to mix, Shante's lyrics cause conflicts
I'm bookin' my rhymes like convicts

[Kool G Rap]
God prayed for a death wish? Come on, step up
Some tried to keep up, but never kept up
When I roll, nobody can't hold me
So they all told me to make 'em die slowly

[Shante]
The warning signs of danger read "please take precautions"
I'm giving your baby rhymes abortions
Hit the deck when I wreck, one got shot in the neck
Poison escaped through the tape decks
Confusion, havin' a need for a blood transfusion
She couldn't stop my intrusion

[Kool G Rap]
Your in the path of a lyrical tidal wave
Sound waves take you straight to your graves
Pain remains in your head, suffocation
Strangulation, wipe out a whole nation

[Shante]
On stage tryin' to recite like me
But what I really see is Creepshow 3
I size em up to die and pulverize 'em
So bad, her own mother won't recognize her

[Kool G Rap]
This goes for those, that oppose like foes
But I don't diss (I dispose)
Somewhere right near nightmare right where you might hear
Songs are long like light years

[Shante]
So here's a taste of the lyrical greats of all time
WHAT? Deadly rhymes

*Chorus*

[Shante]
Attack, ready to track the wack rappers who slack
I attract, cause you lack, you sad sack
The microphone fanatic comin' in with the impact
In fact this track, to subtract, I pack
A pile of stacks back in the sack for snacks
But I react, right and exact, cause I'm black
Got a taste, and treble and bass you can't chase
In case you wanna race the pace I got haste
To ace in your case, in your face just like mace
I replace, wreck the place and then erase, sho'!

[Kool G Rap]
I captivated, those that violated
Alienated, styles annihilated
Rappers, evacuated, faded, vacated
Waited, for my spot to be isolated
Crash and smash and bash you in the trash
In a flash, I whiplash you burned to an ash
A mass defeat, delete, rhymes are like concrete
Rap athletes all retreat to my beat
Except they don't step with pep, they get carried in a stretcher
Done by the treacherous rap wrecker

[Shante]
Start tearin' and scarin', what you're hearin'
Will put fear in, so I'm comparin'
You get tossed across like Kris Kross
To force, you fell of course, boss (so now you're lost)
All rhymes are organized like crime
That's why I titled this here design
DEADLY RHYMES[Intro]
We came here tonight to get started
To cold act ill and get retarded

[Verse 1]
I'm Shante and the rhymes are def
Just rap so fresh 'til I get out of breath
Now this is somethin' that we do have to do
And this is a team that I must introduce
I'm Shante, he's Biz Markie
We rap so fresh that they think it's three
Three of us who rap together
Strong as a bond that is tougher than leather
My name is Shante and yes, I'm top choice
And you can tell by the sound of my voice
That the way that I rock that I am the best
Higher than the rest, plus considered fresh
Threw on my Filas and my Fila suit
Stepped out my house, I just knew I was cute
Bumped into Biz, he had on Filas too
I said, "Yo, Biz Markie. What ya wanna do?"
He stepped out the house chillin', yes ya know
Went outside, it's kinda cold ya know
So I threw on the bomber so I could get loose
Matter of fact it was my black Goose
Stepped outside, everyone was on it
I said, "You like it, baby. Don't you want it?"
They looked at me, they thought it was funny
And out of my pocket came a mint of money
Me and Biz went Uptown, yes
Chillin' around cos we know we're the best
And then this guy came up to me
He said, "We want you to make a record, you see"
Looked at Biz, said, "Do ya wanna do it?"
He said, "Yeah, Shante. There's nothin' to it"
I said, "Alright", and time has passed
"I saved the money"
"Ha ha!" and we laugh...

[Biz laughter]

"That's not enough...
Things are gettin' tough and sort of rough
If you're not paying me ten G's or more
Then you might as well take your contract out the door"
He looked at me, he got so mad
And then when he left we were sort of glad
No, we don't sniff coke, we don't get high
All we do is dress real fly
Hang out at a party 'til the mornin' light
Chillin' all the time while other MC's bite
I say my rhymes, he does the beat
And you know me and him could never be defeated
We never sing Beat It and no, we don't Eat It
And if you do not like it, well yes you can bite it
And don't you go and get excited
I'm Shante, he's Biz Markie
Side by side you know it's we
No, I don't speak French, when I say we
I mean us two, not 'Yes, sirree'
Everyone knows that I am much better
Come on Biz Markie, get it together
Talk to the girls, you know they are wack
Tell those crabs they sound like cats...

[Biz mews like a cat while beatboxing!]

That subject's cute and it's sort of fine
But another subject just came in my mind
It's sort of crazy, it's sort of wack
I'm talkin' about five-dollar cracks
Runnin' round town just stickin' up each other
Ready to rob each other's mother
Gettin' little capsules, don't wanna choke
And all you do is sit down and smoke
Your jaws move in, your body gets skinny
You spend your money to your very last penny
You walk around town in the same old jeans
And yes you know just what I mean
No, you're not cute and you're sort of wack
You're gettin' really skinny, only big as your hat
And if you wanna beef I'll tell you so
And here's a few things that you should know
Yes, it's crack, then it's Peace
Come on y'all, take it from me
I was told to stay away
This is a message from Shante
You wanna dress fly and have some cash?
Well stay away from it because it's like a rash
Once you get it you start to itch
It's attached just like a (Hhhuh!)
Let's continue with what I said
Cos this is somethin' playin' in your head
Cos we come to party just to have action
Just to prove to you that I'm not Michael Jackson
Rap so strong and rap so def
Rap 'til I get out of breath
Now we have introduced to you
Me and Biz, the Def Fresh Crew...

[Outro]
Me and Biz, the Def Fresh Crew
That was def. See you later...[Verse 1]
Save all the drama
Cause here comes the Big Mama
Any bitch who rip Shante, I bomb her
Cause y'all weak-ass hoes got me fed up
So hookers, get your gloves, and yo, let's go head up
Wall to wall y'all, all will fall
I don't stall cause in this brawl, it's winner takes all
A title bout for all the clout
Any hooker trying to step to this, it's lights out
One hit, your head split, throat slit
Think you're Miss It, but I started this shit
At 14 years old I was going gold
While I was on tour, you was touring the ho stroll
Sucking dicks and turning tricks to get a quick fix
While I was putting dope hits in the mix
Ripping shows with Kane and Biz Markie
Fucking up Roxanne and taking out Sparky
Niggas came in flocks from blocks and blocks
To watch the Rox knock bitches out the box
And every place I played, I headlined
Strictly big names on the topic read mine
The q-u-double e-n
Queen of emceeing
Whenever I flow it's poetry in
Motion, so you can save all the drama
And get the fuck out the way, here comes the Big Mama

[Hook]
(Mama - mama - Aww!)
(I gave birth to most of them MC's)

[Verse 2]
Rhymes are deadly, so hooker, write out your will
Here comes the queen foot-first to your grill
Reciting poems that hit like boulders
Smacking your head dead off your motherfucking shoulders
So nip all the talk in the bud
This ain't no game, boy, I came to draw blood
At any hag thinking that she could last with me
It only takes one blast, and that ass'll be
Wrecked, ruined, damaged, ripped
Cross my path, your ass'll get whipped
Cause Shanté ain't about no games
Matter of fact, yo, I'mma start calling off names
First up is Latifah
You roll up, and I'mma smoke that ass like reefer
Cause you ain't never in life been a star to me
Sold the fuck out trying to go R&B
Now that shit is shady
You say ladies first, well I'm the first lady
And all y'all hoes are phony
Try to get flipped, I'mma rip you and your girl Monie
You're illegitimate, tryin to get a little bit
And I'm about sick of that 'Monie-in-the-middle'-shit
Your album cold garbage
Had one good jam, now you think you a star, bitch
Breaking your neck trying to be in the limelight
But give you a mic, and you can't even rhyme right
So get the fuck off the scene
Cause I got a M-16 that says 'Shante's the queen'
And all you bitches got your style from me
The capital S-h-a-n-t-é
Used to go to my show, analyze how the sound flow
On the down low, fuck around, lay around, ho
So save all the drama
And make room for the Big Mama

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The real queen's in effect
Whenever I come, yo, I come correct
And niggas give me the utmost due respect
And any hag that try to last
'll cold get smoked like marijuana cause her ass is grass
I dig ditches for you bitches
While I collect riches and give you a head full of stitches
Cause in a beef I don't sleep or lollygag
Sending you hags off-stage in a bodybag
Cause Shanté is a rebel
You say you're lyte as a rock, you get crushed like a pebble
One word, and I'mma bag her
Watch the bitch stagger, cause I don't dig the bulldagger
To me a butch don't deserve a mic in hand
Somebody tell her to stop acting like a man
She needs something real thick to help her out quick
(What?) And that's a good piece of dick
Now as for that West Coast slut
With fake-ass hair, contacts, and a padded butt
Instead of "stompin to tha 90s", use your brain
And stomp your ass down to Jack LaLane
You better hurry and hop on a diet plan
And keep the pork chops out the frying pan
Yeah, I said it, so what?
You roll up, slut, you get a fucking gun buck to your gut
I'm bringing tears to all my peers
I ain't new, I been doin this shit for ten years
Bring any ho, and I'll wreck her
I rip the nicest, from Isis down to Salt-N-Pepa
And now you know that I'm the star of the show, ho
While I get dough, you're giving up the yo-yo
You say a nigga can't play with it
You got another job? Well bitch, you better stay with it
Cause you ain't shit in this here
Shanté's the queen, and I'm making it clear
Kicking flavors the way it's supposed to be
That's why no other emcees coming close to me
I leave em all in the dust
From crumbs to crust
It's a must that all opponents get bust
So get the fuck off the stage and save all the drama
And make room for the Big Mama

[Hook]Brothers ain't shit
They lookin' for the next big ass they can stick
But this here chick's not on your dick
Pulling your cars up close by the sidewalk
And got the nerve to get mad if I don't talk
Stay schemin' on how they wanna stick it from the back
A young muthafucka sellin' crack
Go home and go to bed son
Your just coming from the barber shop and tryna' get your head done
Take your ass downtown on 10th Avenue
Because a sister like me is not having you
Playa, going round tellin' other brothers that you laid her
So I guess I'll see your ass later
Some brothers approach you while your shopping
Their girl's not around so they're going ho-hopin'
From one girl to another
You turn your head for a minute, he's tryna kick it to your mother
Stop smilin'
I know all you wanna do is hit
And I really don't give a shit
They get mad cause I always look serious
So they swear I'm on my muthafuckin' period
I'm not impressed by the jewelry and the mink, dummy
Why don't you put some of your money in the bank, sonny
And if I hurt your feelings, I meant to
Cause these here pants, huh, you can't get into
Matter of fact I'm tooken'
So you brothers in the jeep can keep lookin' but I ain't hookin'
Yes I'm giving you the slip
All you can do is trick
Word
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit

I'm on my way to the mall with a couple of friends
Some niggas pull up in a blue benz
A kid named Mark with dark glasses
Talkin' about 'Yo, y'all got some real fat asses'
I kept walkin'
Tracy stopped and started talkin'
With all these motherfuckers hawkin'
With that dumb looking grin
Bitch gets in the car that was carrying three men
I know the whole game well
They spend a little money, you end up at a hotel
Well that's how they planned it
She didn't wanna screw so they left her ass stranded
That's what she get for whilin'
Cold left the dumb bitch somewhere out in long island
Next time she'll act decent
And her moms won't have to come and get her ass from a precinct
Remember Shanté told you
Drugs is not the only thing a girl can say no to
You gotta watch every move that you make on the street
Word up, cause talk ain't that cheap
It may become a bad habit
You see a brother with a little bit of dough, you wanna grab it
I get approached by a man sometimes, I throw a fit
Word
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
So don't honk your horn keep rolling
No I don't wanna ride cause the shit might be stolen
Anyway, I know your number
You got a gas, grass or ass sticker on your bumper
Go ahead and say I'm stuck up
Cause I ain't doin nothing that'll make my rep. fucked up
Cause it happens to the best of us
Fuck the rest of us
Niggas keep testing us
A man can make you wanna kill him
Or late at night, make you wanna thrill him
He'll give you money, you can even be fly
But he still has to cheat and you wanna know why
That's the dog in him, 'woof, woof!'
That makes him get up in the middle of the night and go 'POOF!'
You say 'Yo, yo where you going?'
He's cheating and he's skeezing and your not even knowing
But this is what they usually do
Suck on the ting and they make you go 'WOO!'
And then he hits the door
And for the rest of the night you don't see him no more
He's got shit at your house, here's what you do
You should do some voodoo, hmm
Make his dick small
Make him see spiders on the wall
Then make him throw a fit
Why?
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shitJust gather 'round, this tale is rather chillin'
What I mean is thrillin', so listen if you're willin'
Cause Shanté has been through more than the average girl
Now I will send your mind through a twirl
Now usually I'm narrow-minded, never blinded
By any man, but some how I got binded
I mean caught up, he wasn't all that fly
I can't lie, he was cute in his suit and tie
But he wasn't my type, I mean he didn't own
A dope Benz with a rag top and a phone
He wasn't out gettin' paid by the mile
He was a different kind of man with a different style
He didn't sport a fat rope, and that was strange
He had a job at the New York Stock Exchange
Down on Wall Street, workin' 9 to 5
He was a man with a mind and a will to strive
He had a wife, but acted like she wasn't there
Long hair, they really made a lovely pair
But Shanté was ready for some real action
And this is the beginning of a fatal attraction

So I saw him nearly every day, what could I say?
"Hi, I'm Shanté, and could you leave the wife, by the way?"
I wasn't with it. He had to take the first step
I have a rep, and good is how I want it kept
But then it happened, one day he started kickin' it
And just to think, I thought that he was chicken shit
He gave his name, he couldn't give his number though
I gave him mine, and beat it like a drummer so
He wouldn't think I was on it but I really was
The same night, he had the nerve to give a buzz
And I thought, "Damn, what a bad brother"
He said his wife was out of town with her grandmother
Pay him a visit--I said "Yo I'm not a dummy"
I know that's not the only kind of pay he wants from me
But I went, and somethin' told me not to go
But when I got there, he seduced me slow
Now I'm not the first date type
But this night Shanté was quite hype
And quite ready for all kinds of action
Soon you'll see why this is a fatal attraction

And so it happened, boy did it ever
I never been touched like that, I mean never
The whole weekend was very romantic
Then came Sunday, and I got frantic
Cause it was time to run, and I was havin' fun
He touched my cheek, and then he said "See ya, hon"
I went home and thought it was short
Time I realized that I was caught
And for the next four months of us dating
I kept anticipating and waiting
Because he told me he and his wife were through
Finished, over, I just had to wait a few
So I waited, and time kept passin' on
Three more months, and still she wasn't gone
I got mad, I asked him what the problem was
We sat down, and bust what the brother does
"Sorry, baby, what was I thinkin' of?
I have a wife, and that's who I really love
And as for us—" "Please, don't even run it
Cause if you loved her, you wouldn't've never done it"
I started breakin' and he was about to see some action
And feel the pain of a fatal attraction

Well, this story has such a sad ending
And I hope these men stop pretending
As if they're single, and try to mingle
Cause one day you might feel a tingle
Between your legs, and when you look down to check
Ha, surprise! Go 'head and break your neck
Search high and low, look near and far
But what you're lookin' for is somewhere in a pickle jar
Just like him, cause he's in a hospital
He had a big one, but now it's kind of little
So little, he can't stick it any place
He tried to play me, and he lost the race
But that's not that he lost
Jimmy's gone, and that's the cost
Of my fatal attraction[Verse 1]
Some people call me Shanie, some people call me Rox
And those who try to diss I just knocks them out the box
Cos I'm Shante and y'all know the routine
And here we go again, so all hail the queen
I left you for a while but it was worth the wait
Because it gave me just enough time to create
A funky rhythm that's guaranteed to move the world
Have the party people screaming out, "Go on Girl!"
Just like Diana Ross, I'm the boss
And those who disapprove you can go for yours
But to think a girl like me, ha, is easy to take
You should treat me like Nell Carter, give me a break
Cause I'm the super female that's called Shante
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

[Verse 2]
A lotta MCs today really know how to please
But I gave birth to most of them MCs
So when it comes around to the month of May
Send me your royalty check for Mother's Day
Because yo, ya know, ya can't deal with this
I'm Shante the microphone grandmistress
A pioneer like Lola Folana
With a name that stands big like Madonna
Speaking of Madonna, some girls on the mic
Rap like virgins and get real tight
But I get loose with the rhymes I produce
That's why I'm queen of the crew with the juice
Cos I'm the super female that's called Shante
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

[Verse 3]
Shante, the baddest around
And a name like that can be broken down
As Supreme Highness Almighty Noble Topics Exponent
And any title for a girl, you can believe I own it
Cause to me there ain't nothing fresher
For me to rock..my pleasure
I'll pick up the microphone and start rocking
Say the funky rhymes that have the people clocking
Me, the S-H-A-N-T-E
Good looking, never tooken female MC
I'm five foot four, maybe a little bigger
Brown skin complexion with a nice figure
Yes, the super female that's called Shante
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

[Verse 4]
You may remember the voice from a few years ago
When I first came out and dissed UTFO
I chilled for a while, I put down my pen
But now some suckas from the Bronx got me started again
Now I'm not out to diss the whole Boogie Down
Just a featherweight crew from that part of town
You made a little record and then you start fronting
Tried to diss the Juice Crew but ain't hurt nothing
Now KRS-ONE, you should go on vacation
With that name sounding like a wack radio station
And as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed
When T La Rock said "It's Yours", he didn't mean his name
So step back, peasants, popping all that junk
Or else BDP will stand for Broken Down Punks
Cause I'm an All-Star just like Julius Erving
And Roxanne Shante is only good for steady servingWell, my name is Roxanne, a-don't ya know
I just a-cold rock a party, and I do this show
I said I met these three guys, and you know that's true
A-let me tell you and explain them all to you:
I met this dude with the name of a hat
I didn't even walk away, I didn't give him no rap
But then he got real mad, and he got a little tired
If he worked for me, you know he would be fired
His name is Kangol, and that is cute
He ain't got money, and he ain't got the loot
And every time that I see him, he's always a-beggin'
And all the other girls that he's always tryin' to leggin'
Every time that he sees me, he says a rhyme
But, see, compared to me it's weak compared to mine
A-every time I know that I am sayin' somethin' fresher
In any category I'm considered the best
And every time that I say it there ain't nothin' less
And everybody knows I will win the contest
So, then, after that came the Educated Rapper
His fingers started snappin', and my hands start to clappin'
Every time-a that I see him, everything he say
A-every time he says, he says it dumber this way:
He said-a, "Yeah, you know your mother's name is Mary,"
But all he want to do is just-a bust a cherry
Every time that I see him, he's sayin' somethin' new
But let me explain to him what he should do:
He should be like me, a fly MC
Don't never have to bite, we're always right
I have the freshest rhymes that I do recite
And after that, and you know it's true
Well, let me tell you somethin' else about the Doctor, too:
He ain't really cute, and he ain't great
He don't even know how to operate
He came up to me with some bullshit rap
But let me tell you somethin' cause you know it was wack
So when he came up to me, I told him to step back
He said, "You call yourself an MC?" I said, "This is true,"
He said, "Explain to me really what MCs must do."
I said, "Listen very close cause I don't say this every day:
My name is Roxanne, and they call me Shanté."
But every time-a I say a rhyme-a just-a like-a this-a
It's something that you MCs just won't-a miss-a
And if you think it's cute-a, and you think it's all right
But, see, you said it in a language so you wouldn't have to bite
You started talkin' Pig Latin, didn't make no sense
You thought you was cute, yeah, you thought you was a prince
You're walkin' down the block, holdin' your jock
But everybody knows that you're all on my yacht
I'm just the devastatin', always rockin', always have the niggas clockin'
Everybody knows it's me, yeah, the R-O-X-A-N-N-E, yeah
Down with everybody fresh and everyone that I possess
And every time I do it right-a, everyone is sure to bite-a
Every time I do it, yeah, you know it is-a me-a
Rockin' on the beat-a that you can see
And every time I have a DJ like Ice
He ain't right, yeah, he ain't nice
Because a-everything he does is off-the-wall
Compared to my man Marley Marl
The way he gets on the tables, yes
Everyone knows that he is fresh
So, the UTFO crew, you know what you can do
Lemme tell you one for me, and then I'll tell you one for you
Every time you sayin' somethin' just-a like-a this-a
It ain't nothin' that I don't want to miss-a
And if you're thinkin' that I'm bitin' your beat
Well, then you just better know, and a-listen to me
Because my name is Roxanne-a, and I came to say
I'm rockin' to the beat-a, and I do it every day
I'm conceited, never beated, never heard of defeated
I'm rockin' to the beat-a, and you know it is-a me-a:
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E-a
And if you want to play a little game for me
Lemme show you what you can do, baby
Cause with a twist of my cheek, and a twist of my wrist
I have all the niggas droppin' down like this
Yeah, I am fly but don't take this
And everybody knows I don't go for it
So, if you're tryin' to be cute and you're tryin' to be fine
You need to cut it out cause it's all in your mind
Tryin' to be like me, yeah, is very hard
You think you are God, but you do eat lard
Tryin' to be cute, and you're tryin' to be fly
Don't you know you wish you could be my guy?
So I can take you home, make you relax
And everybody knows that you're out there, tryin' to tax
Like corn-on-the-cob, you're always tryin' to rob
You need to be out there, get yourself a job
Yeah, you're tryin' to be in search of a Roxanne
But lemme let ya know--you're not a real man
Cause a Roxanne needs a man, and yes:
Someone fresh who always address
Someone, yeah, who will never fess
And then I'll say, yeah, the rest
Cause everybody knows how the story goes
There's no ifs, no ands, no buts, or suppose
No coke up your nose, no dope in your vein
And then it won't cause no kind of pain
But yet, and still, you're tryin' to be fly
I ask you a question, I want to know why:
Why'd ya have to make a record 'bout me
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E?

("Roxanne, Roxanne, ["Oh, my goodness!"]
I want to be your man
Roxanne, Roxanne
And here's our game-plan!")[Scratch]
I don't care who's first or who's last
But I know that y'all better just drop this
At the dro-dro-drop of a dime ba-----baby

[Scratch]
Crai-Crai-Craig G light up the mic
Craig-Craig-Craig-Craig
Craig G light up the mic
Craig G light up the mic for The Symphony

[Verse One: Craig G]
Ahh, Politics & Bullshit got me hectic
Let me show y'all new rappers how to do a posse record
Craig G-I, with the Frankie C
U-T-L-A-Double-S, MC's get trouble
Best I flow with the the swiftness, never
However new MC's pulled the lever, my style's much better
Anyone can be a victim
Empty tracks I lick sick em
I flip em rip em and strip em of all of they pride
As I slide, in out of these states I stay great
What the G stand for, I'm slammin you and your
Whole staff, style, split an atom in half
East Coast, West Coast, don't make me laugh!
The whole America feels my wrath, ahh!
It's like a terrier was on that ass, ahh, yeah!
Cause nine-six ain't about jack shit
Fuck Versace, I'm like Rocky when I'm bustin' your lip
Bust these metaphors, for better or worse
My style burst
Your grill into itty-bitty pieces
As I release, my thesis
Uhh, Craig G, I believe that's me
Ninetenn-eighty-five til infinity, ahhh

[Scratch]
Shante!
Sha-sha, sha-sha, sha-sha, sha-sha
Shante!
Shante! The baddest around

[Verse Two: Roxanne Shante]
Hey yo, you're lost in the sauce, bitches still remain
Useless, but when I reign bitches can't sustain
The drama, word to momma, bitch I leave you leakin'
Roxanne Shante stay creepin'
You sleepin' but I stay armed, and dangerous
No matter what your name is, bitch I make you famous
A lot of bitches swear shit's sweet
But when I creep I'mma lace you from your head to your fuckin' feet
Frankie Cutlass put me on so I'm back again
Ain't nothin changed it's still the same
Ain't no smilin' friend
I remember eighty-seven, eighty-eight
I was the only one gettin' weight from upstate
Gettin cake, Juice Crew All-Stars was my boys
Runnin round town baby makin' mad noise
Backtrack turn back the page
Live on stage, wreckin' niggas at a early age
I was only fifteen thinkin' big time
At the time blind, all my eyes saw was gold mine
So all you fake Cristal sippin' bitches
Here's a thirty-eight bitch, click it!
I didn't think so...

[Scratch]
I be the Biz Markie
Biz-biz-biz
I be the Biz Markie
Biz Markie, aoooowwwwwww!

[Verse Three: Biz Markie]
Hey hey hey, I'm the eMmmaZah-A
Igga-R-Rrahidy-iZza-Rrahzah-K
I don't have a big mouth, just a lot to say
So listen to my rhythm and rap display, OK
I rock the mic to the T-O-P
And every record that I make, I make history
Like a-oh-oh-oh, WHA-OHH! ah-one two
Is some of the things that I used to do, but
Right about now I got a different flow
I rock from New York City to Mexico
From England, Australia, back to Japan
They know I'm Mista Magic Cool with the mic in my hand
So, you know I got more rhymes than Muhammad Ali
That's why my name rings bells internationally
Never neglected well protected as an MC yet
I'm, super duper with the rhymes I invent
Big Daddy Kane, you know you're part of the staff
Get on the mic, get on the mic god damnit
Get on the mic on my behallllllllllllllllllllf, waaoooowowwww!!

[Scratch]
The-the-the name Kane is superior to many people

[Verse Four: Big Daddy Kane]
Tell me what you see, and uhh, vectorize
When you, check your eyes, baby, recognize, it's the
Rawest chump to make the verse in the chorus bump
With rhymes skills to be retarded like Forrest Gump
Now feel the pain runnin' through your chest area
Thoughts of the attack it got you fearin' the
Bodily abuse, that you phony niggas makin' me produce
Warfare put to use, fuck all that, just turn me loose
Huh, and this is for those who don't know the half
I want to see just how well you know your math
Now, in case a nigga want to get out of line
Just tell me how many times does sixteen go into nine
See, a lot of you rappers like to front as if you're ruthless
But, when I'm around you make all kind of excuses
Like, I just remembered, yo, my niece need diapers kid
Plus I got homework, bible-study, all types of shit
Boo-yaka, any fuckin' tune to ya
King Asiatic, tell me what we gonna do wit ya
One more thing, the next example one of you niggas is bout to be it
Now close your eyes tight cause trust me you don't want to see it[Havoc]
Ready for war, ready for anything
But doing this for everything
Y'all niggas know my pedigree
Forty first side, blood run through my veins
Got everything to gain
Like to stock and change
Got shorty in the hood on the ankle rocking my name
Words that I spit, it's my brain and pipe game
Call me your natural ? right ring
QB's radical's just doing his thing
Aiyo, niggas hate it
Even though they try to portray it
This money looking good, fuck it you can all hate it
Like I'm going to lose sleep, hold life, have beef
So you can say what you think about me
Yo you niggas like Nas and gun fight your dead roon(?)
Pull out the nine and still got hooked on
Your no frill skim
And on skill team
Got you in a coma
Angel of your shoulder

[Hook]
Aiyo we live this eat, sleep, shit this (repeat 7X)
We live this, live this, this...

[Big Noyd]
Aiyo, Aiyo, Aiyo
Its alyways Going to be ganster with me
Nigga, with Timbs on my feet
Either sweats or denim jeans, brand new white tee
With my chain swinging
I'm thugged in the streets
Think Noyd you think hustling busting the heat
Repping QB borroughs surrounded with thugs
Who carry coke, crack, bud and they got guns
Who want from slums to homes
Trains to the V's
The niggas you see in the hood with the G's
Where gangstas be and the pistols pop
You rub on the mama thighs they panties drop
This shit get you hot
We ill you not
You sick beacuse you love the way we rock
Crusing in the Nav with a dime or not
Jumping out the Nav copping cheese but eye up the spot
You know my two heaters is hot
Fending for springing
And that goes out to those scheming and laying

[Hook]

[Roxanne Shante]
Who you know have guity fo's and a dime ass kooci
Now thugging and recovering,rocking guns and gucci
'85 getting paid while them gangsters watch
Champiagn pop benzes candy painted drop (bitch)
Roxanne Shante, Hilary Clinton
Lay out the red carpet y'all hoes shut up and listen
Mouth close whenever you hear a veteran spittin
Y'all hoes only shine with the legends permisson
Bitches ask around why she wait to spit this long
You know the queen who came out with the first hit song
I showed hoes how to rock furs
Glocks in my skirts
Dated real killers when they feel I cop them a bird
Ain't nothing
Ain't fronting
Shantie love where she lives
Mother of my two kids
And the mother of the rich
Tried to make plans,ran the game and the biz
Still real popping up with nas up at the bridge
No silcone,No wigs, No liposuchion
First bitch riding back sike not fronting
I respect new females give all y'all credit
Supporting your videos bought all y'all records
No matter how you get down you sexual prefence
Just keep this shit real or that vet going to set it
Queensbrigde projects we murder the rest
And all my gangers know I rock the best

[Hook][Kool G Rap]
Deadly rhymes the pages of rage strikes again
Killing men, women and children
Til defeat, types of shelter, helter skelter
Nobody's around here to help ya

[Shante]
Up in flames, the brainstorm rain drains your veins
The only remains is rains of brains
Fixed to mix, Shante's lyrics cause conflicts
I'm bookin' my rhymes like convicts

[Kool G Rap]
God prayed for a death wish? Come on, step up
Some tried to keep up, but never kept up
When I roll, nobody can't hold me
So they all told me to make 'em die slowly

[Shante]
The warning signs of danger read "please take precautions"
I'm giving your baby rhymes abortions
Hit the deck when I wreck, one got shot in the neck
Poison escaped through the tape decks
Confusion, havin' a need for a blood transfusion
She couldn't stop my intrusion

[Kool G Rap]
Your in the path of a lyrical tidal wave
Sound waves take you straight to your graves
Pain remains in your head, suffocation
Strangulation, wipe out a whole nation

[Shante]
On stage tryin' to recite like me
But what I really see is Creepshow 3
I size em up to die and pulverize 'em
So bad, her own mother won't recognize her

[Kool G Rap]
This goes for those, that oppose like foes
But I don't diss (I dispose)
Somewhere right near nightmare right where you might hear
Songs are long like light years

[Shante]
So here's a taste of the lyrical greats of all time
WHAT? Deadly rhymes

*Chorus*

[Shante]
Attack, ready to track the wack rappers who slack
I attract, cause you lack, you sad sack
The microphone fanatic comin' in with the impact
In fact this track, to subtract, I pack
A pile of stacks back in the sack for snacks
But I react, right and exact, cause I'm black
Got a taste, and treble and bass you can't chase
In case you wanna race the pace I got haste
To ace in your case, in your face just like mace
I replace, wreck the place and then erase, sho'!

[Kool G Rap]
I captivated, those that violated
Alienated, styles annihilated
Rappers, evacuated, faded, vacated
Waited, for my spot to be isolated
Crash and smash and bash you in the trash
In a flash, I whiplash you burned to an ash
A mass defeat, delete, rhymes are like concrete
Rap athletes all retreat to my beat
Except they don't step with pep, they get carried in a stretcher
Done by the treacherous rap wrecker

[Shante]
Start tearin' and scarin', what you're hearin'
Will put fear in, so I'm comparin'
You get tossed across like Kris Kross
To force, you fell of course, boss (so now you're lost)
All rhymes are organized like crime
That's why I titled this here design
DEADLY RHYMES[Intro]
We came here tonight to get started
To cold act ill and get retarded

[Verse 1]
I'm Shante and the rhymes are def
Just rap so fresh 'til I get out of breath
Now this is somethin' that we do have to do
And this is a team that I must introduce
I'm Shante, he's Biz Markie
We rap so fresh that they think it's three
Three of us who rap together
Strong as a bond that is tougher than leather
My name is Shante and yes, I'm top choice
And you can tell by the sound of my voice
That the way that I rock that I am the best
Higher than the rest, plus considered fresh
Threw on my Filas and my Fila suit
Stepped out my house, I just knew I was cute
Bumped into Biz, he had on Filas too
I said, "Yo, Biz Markie. What ya wanna do?"
He stepped out the house chillin', yes ya know
Went outside, it's kinda cold ya know
So I threw on the bomber so I could get loose
Matter of fact it was my black Goose
Stepped outside, everyone was on it
I said, "You like it, baby. Don't you want it?"
They looked at me, they thought it was funny
And out of my pocket came a mint of money
Me and Biz went Uptown, yes
Chillin' around cos we know we're the best
And then this guy came up to me
He said, "We want you to make a record, you see"
Looked at Biz, said, "Do ya wanna do it?"
He said, "Yeah, Shante. There's nothin' to it"
I said, "Alright", and time has passed
"I saved the money"
"Ha ha!" and we laugh...

[Biz laughter]

"That's not enough...
Things are gettin' tough and sort of rough
If you're not paying me ten G's or more
Then you might as well take your contract out the door"
He looked at me, he got so mad
And then when he left we were sort of glad
No, we don't sniff coke, we don't get high
All we do is dress real fly
Hang out at a party 'til the mornin' light
Chillin' all the time while other MC's bite
I say my rhymes, he does the beat
And you know me and him could never be defeated
We never sing Beat It and no, we don't Eat It
And if you do not like it, well yes you can bite it
And don't you go and get excited
I'm Shante, he's Biz Markie
Side by side you know it's we
No, I don't speak French, when I say we
I mean us two, not 'Yes, sirree'
Everyone knows that I am much better
Come on Biz Markie, get it together
Talk to the girls, you know they are wack
Tell those crabs they sound like cats...

[Biz mews like a cat while beatboxing!]

That subject's cute and it's sort of fine
But another subject just came in my mind
It's sort of crazy, it's sort of wack
I'm talkin' about five-dollar cracks
Runnin' round town just stickin' up each other
Ready to rob each other's mother
Gettin' little capsules, don't wanna choke
And all you do is sit down and smoke
Your jaws move in, your body gets skinny
You spend your money to your very last penny
You walk around town in the same old jeans
And yes you know just what I mean
No, you're not cute and you're sort of wack
You're gettin' really skinny, only big as your hat
And if you wanna beef I'll tell you so
And here's a few things that you should know
Yes, it's crack, then it's Peace
Come on y'all, take it from me
I was told to stay away
This is a message from Shante
You wanna dress fly and have some cash?
Well stay away from it because it's like a rash
Once you get it you start to itch
It's attached just like a (Hhhuh!)
Let's continue with what I said
Cos this is somethin' playin' in your head
Cos we come to party just to have action
Just to prove to you that I'm not Michael Jackson
Rap so strong and rap so def
Rap 'til I get out of breath
Now we have introduced to you
Me and Biz, the Def Fresh Crew...

[Outro]
Me and Biz, the Def Fresh Crew
That was def. See you later...[Verse 1]
Ladies listen up, I really hope you're ready
Cause what I've got to say is far from petty
We've come a long way, baby, so maybe
Shanté can help a sister that's way be-
-hind, lost in the mind and can't find
Her way to a better day, you know the kind
So wrapped up in fairy tale dreams
So naive that every male seems
Honest and loyal, ready to spoil
Buying him gifts as if the boy's loyal
But Shanté is here just to say a few things
Some you heard before, but some are new things

[Hook]
So lend me your ears, dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers for the years
Of the independent woman

[Interlude]
(Yeah)
(Louder)

[Verse 2]
How many runny-nose kids can you have?
How many nights can you work on the ave.?
Your so-called man has a car and a Visa
He's living large while you're living on pizza
Unemployed while you wait for the perfect mate
Let's get one thing straight cause it's getting late
What you're waiting for is really never coming
No one hears the sorry tunes that you're humming
I'm here to bring the news, that if you're singing the blues
Everyday, it will not change the views
That people have of you, they say you're lost
Nobody forced you to quit, your future's tossed
You put your faith in the guys with the hazel eyes
You thought you would get a prize, all you got was lies
Now you're stuck in a room with a mopping broom
Did you assume that one day you will find a groom?
Are you dizzy? Who would ever marry you?
You're looking for a man that will carry you
And buy you nice things, like diamond rings
You're amazed at the truth that my rhyming brings
But the truth is the only way you'll ever see
That the life that you're hoping for will never be
But the race isn't over, put down the rope
Shanté is here to say there's still hope

[Hook & Interlude]

[Verse 3]
So much to live for, she wants to die
Life's full of pitfalls, maybe that's why
Her pops went to jail, her mother tapped her vein
City took custody and trapped her in pain
Feeling so alone in the room with a stranger
Hates her own blood and nothing's gonna change her
Angry at the world cause it doesn't play fair
So much despair does she feel, no one to care
Not a single family member will remember her
Smoke's in her eyes, and the past is a blur
She's on her own now, living with some other girls
With the same damn lives, but from a different world
These girls are lost, how the city is full of fools
So many years, no guidings, and no kinda rules
No love to give, yo, they need love to live
If not instead, they'll ponder in a bed
Sex is the thing that makes her feel wanted
Love and care, for she's undaunted
Because whoever is laying there won't really matter
Such a sad song when young dreams shatter
I really don't think glue is gonna fix it
But homegirl can walk the right path if she picks it

[Hook]

(Yeah)
(Louder)

[Verse 4]
The black woman role grows larger each day
Nothing in the way so what we teach may
Somehow help those young sisters that doze
And sleepwalk through life with their eyes closed
You don't need a man, all you need is to know you can
Then you can stand on your own two feet and
Achieve anything that you want out of life
Do for yourself, then you can be a wife
And you'll feel so good that you wanna shout
Because you got to the top and got there without
Relying on Tom, Dick, or Billy Dee
You don't have to turn the lights on to really see

[Hook]Jae Supreme – No Regrets Lyrics
Featuring: Entaraj Kwa
Produced By: Jae Supreme
Track 1 on Life Work

[Intro: jae supreme]
Yeah
Jae supreme
And i am
Queensbridge best kept secret
This is my testament
My legacy
Yeah
Qb true story
[Verse 1: Jae Supreme]
I was born in the bridge, real talk
M.c. capitol, queensbridge new york
Veteran of the six blocks of hip hop
12 street, vernon, the dime block
That's where the passion for the music began
With dj marley marl, m.c. shan
Marley played the bridge first time in the park
That's where i got the spark
Yo, i need to do that there
Mit showed a youngin just how to prepare
Work them boards right there
Plug in the mic, and make your voice sound real clear
Tap a beat out on that 808
A little practice and you could be great
Now i'm lookin' for a name that's mean
J. a. e. cut supreme
I got approached by young trag
Ready to put b.d.p. on blast
For that record south bronx
Me him and face made the answer soft bronx
But marley wouldn't spin it tho
On b.l.s. even tho we was ready yo
But whatever the case
We still recorded mad shit on 90 min cassette tape
Waitin' for our time to shine
My time to shine came in '89
Jamel said ayo jae, shante
Need a dj to back her on stage
Had a job but i quit it
Rather travel the country, on a free ticket
So that's what i did for 2 years
In between shows, studio engineer
For tuta aquino and mark kamins
He the one that made madonna famous
Did nas first demo, villain
Then i got a deal for myself at cold chillin'
Just for the hell of it, it was irrelevant
But the money was good, and it was evident
Niggas tried to stick me in the hood
That's all part of the game, it's all good

[Hook: Entaraj Kwa]
Never made it to the pinnacle of super stardom
But i'm still here, so i beg your pardon
I'm blessed - no regrets
Not a household name, but i'm still the same
Queensbridge blood runnin' thru my veins
And i'm blessed - no regrets

[Verse 2: Jae Supreme]
On the road, makin' new friends
Stayed in canada for six months and then
Returned to the states
Bumped into hots
Joined forces to make some mixtapes
Dreamteam was the name, look it up
We went platinum on the streets, look it up
My man trag reached out again
He needed a beat for cnn
Capone n noreaga kept it real
When they spit on my beat, half a mil
Got a write up in the source wit 'em
Unsigned hype called my work "tight production"
Cormega got released from jail
Me and hots did demos for the def jam deal
Like good fellas with him nas and syl
And dead man walkin' was real
Shante hit me up again
For the sprite commercial, five deadly women
Another deal another check, it gets deeper
That's when i started the gatekeepers
Cds and dvds on deck
I been gained my respect
Never was it for the fortune n fame
I remained the same, and i never changed

[Hook]

[outro: jae supreme]
Yeah
Yo, this ain't even the whole story
There's plenty more yo
You wanna know more
Cop the book, cop the documentary
Yeah - jae supreme
Queensbridge best kept secret
I'm still here yo - word up
[entaraj kwa: queensbridge in my blood, yeah][Hook]
My groove gets better and better now don't it?
My groove gets better and better now don't it?
My groove gets better and better now don't it?
My groove gets better and better now don't it?

[Verse 1]
I got the skills to deal
All the funky shit, plus the hips that just don't quit
My name is Shante but you can call me Shannie
Makes no diff' word up, word to Mommy
I'm still the queen upon the scene
So fly that I cause your man to fiend
Now hold up, this has gotten outta hand
There's a posse of witches f-ing up the programme
So grab your brooms and prepare for flight
Because I'm back and this time I'm more than hype
I'm causing raucaus ???
Action's what you want they might give it to me
I gotta give to live to my personal
I'm the director, directing the party well
So come along and stpe in my dimension
And bob your head to my funky invention cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The microphone passing, indeed we can do this
And when I'm done, you're gonna be shoeless
Cause I'm not an amateur, I make you get down
So you better have much soul when I'm around
I go off, get loose like a master
Deal with Shante, gimme a glass of milk
I treat MCs just like cookies
Chew 'em up, spit 'em out, to all rookies
Be on the look out in other words look twice
All competition, huh I put on ice
Fickle and feeble opponents I find them
When you in line with me you can't win
I'm just too advanced, a typical hot pose?
I do damage, yes to the utmost
So hold up, step back, you ought to think twice
Just think again cause Shante is too nice
On beats like this god damn I get nifty
You must be nuts, trying to get with meWack itt, wack itt, wack itt...

Now this is called the Wack Itt, and I do it all the time
Choose the wackest, wackest beats, and add the wackest, wackest rhymes
The wacky, wacky, wacky voice, which I really shouldn't say, is wacky
Some people say it's wack, but it's not, it's just cracky
This is how I do it, some people just can't hack it
If it's cold outside, then go on and put on a jacket
But now I'm here to tell you. and we know this for a fact
This record's just like crack, you know what it is? It's wack
Wack itt

I mean you're goin out the whole nine yards

Now I'm sittin in my room tryin to guess just what to do
So I decided to get wacky, cause you know, yo, that's true
So we turned on to a track that had to be super wack
And yo, guess what we came up - somethin like that
I was really thinkin about some things that make me mad
How could you get a gold record when you sound like J.J. Fad?
I mean come on, let's be for real, I mean I didn't wanna say it
But their shit was so wack, yo, this one I know you'll play it
It's record
A wacky record

Now just jump up and down, spin your head from left to right
Then just move a little bit, get real close, but not too tight
Let me see you throw your hands up in the air like you don't care
And that's called the wackest dance, and we'll call it the Underwear
It's a record
A wacky record

(Go on, girl)

Now my name is Shanté, not Wanda Wah-Wah
And I'm here to make a record, and some people say I'm a star
I say: Yeah, I do agree, but you have to think real close
I mean, when it comes to bein wacky, J.J. Fad, yo, they're the most
It's a wack itt

Wack itt, wack itt, wack itt...

Now if you want a example, let me tell you what makes me mad
Did you ever hear Supersonic that was by J.J. Fad?
Listen close to what I'm sayin, cause it went somethin like this
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la...)
Or you can say I missed, I really can't resist
To come to someone, up to their face. and then give them a diss
I do it all the time, everytime I say a rhyme
People jump, yeah, all on mines, cause you know they're out of line
I tell them to step right back, cause you know the record's wack
If you do not like the record, yo - I got it like that
I can make rhymes up just like this
Make the people not wanna resist
They listen to the beat and start to dance
And then they start to jump up in their pants
Now I told you how to do the dance
Get on the floor and take a chance
Now this is known as a matter of fact
Yo, stop the track, let's get wack

Wack
Wack
Wack
Wack

[as a record is spun backwards]
Yo yo
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
My ears
What you're doin, baby
Stop playin
Stop
Stop
Stop
My God

Wack itt, wack itt, wack it…

Ah-ha
Wack wack

Now sittin in my room tryin to guess just what to do
So I decided to get wacky, cause you know, yo, that's true
So we turned on to a track that had to be super wack
And yo, guess what we came up - somethin like that

Now get offa my tip
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Now who would believe...
See this - this here happens to be a fad or a faze or a style
That the party people happen to be going through
And I'm in this to win this
And I'm here to get paid, so I figured I might as well get wack too
I mean come on
They might even tell me that the record is
DYNAMITE!!!
Now wasn't that cute
But anyway
Wish I get some respect after this one

Wack itt
Wack itt
Wacky wack itt
Wack itt
Wack itt
