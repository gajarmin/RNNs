[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Living off borrowed time, the clock tick faster
That'd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
Dick Dastardly and Muttley with sick laughter
A gun fight and they come to cut the mixmaster
I-C-E cold, nice to be old
Y2G stee twice to threefold
He sold scrolls, lo and behold
Know who's the illest ever like the greatest story told
Keep your glory, gold and glitter
For half, half of his niggas'll take him out the picture
The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta
Villain: a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare
When he have the mic, it's like the place get like: "Aw yeah!"
It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
Just keep ya eye out, like "Aye, aye captain"
Is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody ain't hear it
And can they testify from in the spirit
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got "Ooh Lords"
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
Or even one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it
It's like the end to the means
Fucked type of message that sends to the fiends
That's why he brings his own needles
And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
Slip like Freudian
Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion

[Outro]
When he had the mic you don't go next
Leaving pussy cats like why hoes need Kotex
Exercise index, won't need Bowflex
And won't take the one with no skinny legs like Joe TexThe rest is empty with no brain but the clever nerd
The best emcee with no chain ya ever heard
Take it from the Tec-9 holder
They've bit but don't know their neck shine from Shinola
Everything that glitters ain't fishscale
Lemme think, don't let her faint get Ishmael
A shot of Jack got her back it's not an act stack
Forgot about the cackalack, holla back, clack clack blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra chart toppa
Start shit stoppa be a smart shoppa
Shot a cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go
'Bout to jet, get him, not a bet, dead 'em
Let 'em spit the venom said 'em got a lot of shit with 'em
Let the rhythm hit 'em, it's stronger in the other voice
We makes the joints that make 'em spread 'em butta moist
Man, please, the stage is made of panties
From the age of baby hoochies on to the grannies
Ban me the dough rake, daddy
The flow make her fatty shake, patty cake, patty cake
For fake, if he was Anita Baker's man
He'd take her for her masters, hit it once an' shake her hand
On some ol' thank ya ma'am an' ghost her
She could mind the toaster if she sign the poster
A whole host of roller coaster riders
Not enough tracks (is it?)
Hot enuff black (for ya)
It's too hot to handle, you got blue sandals
Who shot ya? Ooh got you new spots to vandal?
Do not stand still, both show skills
Close but no krills, toast for po' nils, post no bills
Coast to coast Joe Shmoe's flows ill, go chill
Not supposed to overdose No-Doz pills
Off pride tykes talk wide through scar meat
Off sides like how Worf rides with Starfleet
Told ya, on some get-rich shit
As he get older he gets colder than a witch tit
This is it, make no mistakes
Where my nigga go?
Figaro, Figaro

O's beats and my rhymes attack
A scary act
All black like Ms. Mary Mack
Wait 'til you see 'em live on the piano
DOOM sings soprano like "una duociano" (singing voice)
My momma told me
Blast him and pass her her glass of Ol' E
Not to be troublesome
But I could sure use a quick shot of double rum
No stick of bubble gum
I like ice cream
We could skip the weddin'
Have a nice dream
She only let him stick the head in[Verse]
So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
Daily told the people "You can call me Your Majesty!"
Keep your battery charged
You know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter
Peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (Your mother)
Don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try
Villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you
It's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

[Outro]
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop!* like snot bubbles[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Tripping off the beat kinda, dripping off the meat grinder
Heat niner, pimping, stripping, soft sweet minor
China was a neat signer, trouble with the script
Digits double dipped, bubble lipped, subtle lisp midget
Borderline schizo, sort of fine tits though
Pour the wine, whore to grind, quarter to nine, let's go
Ever since ten eleven, glad she made a brethren
Then it's last down, seven alligator seven, at the gates of heaven
Knocking, no answer, slow dancer, hopeless romancer, dopest flow stanzas
Yes, no? Villain, Metal face to Destro
Guess so, still incredible in escrow
Just say Ho! I'll test the yayo
Wild West style fest, y'all best to lay low
Hey bro, Day Glo, set the bet, pay dough
Before the cheddar get away, best to get Maaco
The worst hated God who perpetrated odd favors
Demonstrated in the perforated Rod Lavers
... In all quad flavors, Lord save us
Still back in the game like Jack LaLanne
Think you know the name, don't rack your brain
On a fast track to half sane
Either in a slow beat or that the speed of "Wrath of Kane"
Laughter, pain
"Hackthoo'ing" songs lit, in the booth, with the best host
Doing bong hits, on the roof, in the west coast
He's at it again
Mad at the pen
Glad that we win, a tad fat, in a bad hat for men
Grind the cinnamon, Manhattan warmongers
You can find the villain in satin, congas
The van screeches
The old man preaches
About the gold sand beaches
The cold hand reaches
For the old tan Ellesse's
... Jesus[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1]
Niggas be like "Fred, you ain't never lied"
Fuck the rap shit, my gangsta been solidified
Still do my business on the side
Bitch, if you polices, then pay me no nevermind
I was thuggin' - Black and red laces in my number threes
Take a pull up off the wood and let that motherfucker breathe
Sit outside a busta crib and let that motherfucker leave
Walk his ass back in and put him on his motherfuckin' knees
Thuggin' - Never takin' no for an answer
Might just take a loss, but bitch, I’d rather take my chances
This liquor got me lurkin' where you live at in the night time
59Fifty to the left, but I'm in my right mind
Thuggin' - Pants gon' be saggin' til I'm 40
Still lyrically sharper than any short bus shawty
Phonies ain't gon' throw me in this minstrel show
These labels see how far up in they mouth my dick can go
So go'n and, choke on this meat, throw my song on repeat
Might move away one day, but I'm always gon' belong to the streets

[Break]
I'm straight thuggin'
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
Cause mothafucka I'm thuggin'

[Verse 2]
Selling you the science of the street rap
Every motherfuckin' show I do is off the meat rack
I done been to jail and did my best not to repeat that
I’m tryin to feed my family, give a fuck about your feedback
Critically acclaimed, but that shit don't mean a thang
When you rocking mics and stealing microwaves, cooking 'caine
Never trippin' on a dame, I'm too cold for you broke hoes
Don't let the knob hit your booty when the door close, bitch
She let me hit it cause I'm thuggin'
Squares need not apply, I'm so fly I might fuck her cousin
Swiftly 'bout to stick a sweet dick in your sweetheart
Then get some groceries off my geeker EBT card
Why the feds worried 'bout me clocking on this corner
When there's politicians out here getting popped in Arizona?

[Break]
Bitch I'm thuggin'
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
Cause mothafucka I'm thuggin'

[Verse 3]
"We’re not against rap, but we're against those thugs"
Can't be legit when every nigga in your clique sold drugs
Predicate felons in my faculty, real killers can vouch for me
Teach a kid at the crib or your children might cop an ounce from me
And smoke out in the Chevy with us
Cause in the past, my low-class black ass would serve my own fucking family members
I hate to say it, ain't no need to be discreet
If she don't cop from me, she get it from a nigga up the street
Cause he thuggin'
And yo, she'd probably suck his dick for it
She turnt out so it ain't shit to turn a trick for it
My uncle last bitch put him on the glass dick
Tried to rob a man to feed his habit, he got blasted
I live on borrowed time, my expiration date I passed it
So lock me up forever, but this shit is everlastin'

I'm thuggin'
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
Cause mothafucka I'm thuggin'[Produced by Madlib]

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they MC's and drink 'em under the table like
"It's on me, Put it on my tab kid."
However you get there
Foot it, Cab it, Iron horse it
You're leaving on your face, forfeit
I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told him tell they stole it
He told her he lost it
She told him "Get off it," and a bunch other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he's drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and their trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him to autograph her derriere
It read

“To Wide Load
This yard bird taste like fried toad Turd
Love
Villain”

Take pride in code words
Crooked eye mold nerd geek, with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die, by the pizza guy
No he's not too fly to skeet in a skezzers eye
And squeeze her thigh
Maybe give her curves a feel
And the same way she feel it when she flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back... uhh... plumbing fixed
"How theres only one left? the pack comes in six
Whatever happened to two and three?"
A herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught
Like, "What you doing G?
Don't make me have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact not for nothing right now you and me!"

Looser than a pair of Adidas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MC's sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came do his thing again no matter who be blinging
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is, like it's time for Tellie Tubbies
Few can do it even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wears mask, like a -tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies
In and out
One, two, three, no bodies please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shottie
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat, like ya boy done gone to war
He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!"
A whole string of jobs, like we on tour
Every night on the score, coming to your corner store[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1: Viktor Vaughn]
I knew you was fucking around
Playing all innocent and hoeing since the foundation
Don't make me have to pound his tin crown face in
And risk being jammed up like traffic inbound from spacing
There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put all my chips on the worst bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off and ended it and dip
And if you spoke soft we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw, no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power...

[Verse 2: Viktor Vaughn]
Probably kissed me later that evening, I should be hurling
Matter of fact, gimme back my bracelet and my Shearling
I rather waste it or give it to your girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was workin'
Remember our vacation out to Maryland
I dooked the maid Carolyn, she made me throw the towel in
Like all foul men the time I hit your moms off
I told her knock it off but she had to set the rocket off
Ain't enough room in this fucking town
When you see tin head tell him be ducking down
I'm not romping around
He better be ready and prepared to be stomped in the groundEy Quasimoto, man! (Quasimoto)
Get off my back with the 20 Questions, man
There go Madlib the bad kid right over there from the Lootpack (Yes)
Right over there, man, ask him, man, ask him

"Where are y'all from?"
We from the west O-X to be exact
Lyric arrest your pack with flows to drop your order format
"But what y'all on?"
Even though we flex until the exit
On living daily, but that soundpiece always be some next shit
"Are y'all original?"
We stay original while your subliminal lines and minimal perception
Poetical enemas for your section
"I bet y'all money hungry"
We dig in crates to get them papes
"What, word"
We droppin beats to clock ends meet
"Now not only for the money"
We're not only for them ends because if I wasn't gettin' paid
I'd still be dropping beats until my grave
"So who you down with?"
I'm down with the Wild Child, DJ Romes, Oh No and God's Gift
"Oh, yeah"
Kazi, Declaime, Medaphoar, Shock got the spliff (shock)
DJ Twist, Kan Kick, peace to Roc C., yeah
Nikko, where my nigga Lali
Like when I'm rushin' loops with E-Swift (yeah)
Going out of town with the Liks, end up in A-T
L-Double-O-T-P-A-C-K, represent how I live every day "805"
L-double-O-T-P-A-C-K, represent how I live every day "805"[Intro: Madlib]
Like a .357 hitting on 365
Checking them dead or alive
With my man

[Verse 1: Medaphoar]
Listen up
I make it pop when I drop the rhyme
No corrupting your spot that mops
MC's out the box so I remain on top
Number one contender assassin
Blast a rhymes attracting
Green weed, bitches and cash
Then I'm (mashin' in fashion)
Southern Cali' wild raise for action
Crazed will leave the rhymes packed in
My verbal clip come packed for easy access
The fact, is your crew is backwards
Stepping up to the real
Yo MC shady got the record deals
Lyrically getting peels, still
I feel you recognize
There's more than just size
It's all about do you got heart
And do you come real with rhymes
Times up, never run up
Hit your roster getting done up
Paralyzed from the neck up
Hold the checking up, doing up
Crews for the coming up
I'm faster when it comes to cash
I speed fast past to leave you whiplashed
To watch we spread around like crabs
To quickly get in that ass
For the future present and past
Lacing tracks like hash

[Hook: Medaphoar]
Checking weak, mark MC's
Everyday, all day
Is where I stay
Deep on the west
Real MC's don't play
We lay it down just like that
Or better yet like this
Rhymes on deck
Leaving fake MC's check (echo)

[Bridge: Quasimoto]
The Ill Loop Digga...
What?

[Verse 2: Madlib]
Ch-Check one two two (one) two
I come through
Like volcanic eruption, Ginsu
Knives cutting right through you
Hit you off with lyrical stanzas (stanzas)
Hit you off with questions or answers
Running through MC's like
Cancel you (doot)
Can't compete
When I throw on my beat
When I write a rap
When I get on the turntables and scratch
Nigga's try to attach
Y'all nigga's get snatched up (smashed up)
Mashed up (crashed up) for trying to act up (act up)
Why you half step (half step) to my rep (rep)
Now you're going in debt (going in debt)
The Ill Loop dig upon set word back
Got to give like I'm hitting headcracks
Going through your back like some lead black
Never give a wack nigga no slack
Get the [prozac?]
Niggas always hollering about
"Where the hoes at"
Or
"I don't even like that nigga man"
But where my foes at
"Hey I'm going to take that nigga out man you see my strap"
Bunch of bluffing
"Kill that nigga, right now"
And everyone knows that

[Hook: Madlib] x2
Check the weak, mark MC's
Everyday all day
Is where I stay
Deep on the west
Real MC's don't play
We lay it down just like that
Or better yet like this
Rhymes on deck
Leaving fake MC's check
Check...check...check...

[Outro]
{Oh, the universe}
{Oh the universe}
{We must get closer to the essence of life}
{But beware that it take courage and strife}[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shout outs to Madlib
It's Jake Ellz
What up, look

[Verse 1]
I wasn't expected to put on like this in the first place
So worst case scenario, Ellz end up in first place
Third race tape, checkered flag at the drive though
Double cheese on my burger with cheese on my fries too
Mango bape on me cause orange is the new black
Mob bitches surround my table, no halo my homies lay low
Pay off for time done, time off, time to rethink things
Vinyls of the Bee Gees, peace treaties with weed leaves, see
Scratch with hatchets like my jockey packin' cleavers
Fuck boys dependent on the pussy, leavin' it to beaver
Claimed deceiver, lord of the ringers
Popped a token and played some blue grass
Too bad that lap dance wasn't any cheaper

[Interlude]
God damn, yo (god damn)
Yo I spent two hundred dollars at the strip club in one weekend cuz
It was crazy, but I can't complain when I, when I, uh

[Verse 2]
Race a 69 Chevelle through the reservoir
No bars hold, what the fuck i need a metaphor?
Explore my situation, you must be playin'
My patience is runnin' thinner
Rookie Bruce Willies, killin' beginners
Do it throughout the winter, spittin' bundles of splinters
Kindlin' for the fire, skydive inside of your sister
Kiss her neck before she return it directly after the dutch
Pink bunny, white rabbit cause I smoke too much
Special herbs and Quasimoto my dolo positive package
Compete with this pistol pete and you best to reserve your rations
American beauty pageant cause a midlife crisis
Milf claimin' they into youngins but only for tonight, shit
I could do you right miss, just turn off the lights quick
Eat outta your pussy, no need for a fork and knife
Shift your body to the edge of the bed, I could throw it backwards
Get a view of that pretty behind while puffin' the Backwood

[Outro]
You know it's that good
I'm winkin' at you through the microphone baby, I see you out here
God damnDripping off the meat grinder
Need to find a freak
Find a beat so I can tie it neat
And clutch it like The Iron Sheik
Crush it with my lion's teeth
If not that's fine for me
Cause I am beat
So goddamn paranoid I only need one eye to sleep
Slow it down a bit so it can start to set
And make it easy for you to understand the tech
I'm a killer plain and simple
A skull is my sigil
Always trying to belittle
Reap the spirit with the sickle
Check the penmanship
I'm ending shit
A+ rhetoric
You fiend to get with this like Illuminati memberships
Ain't even the best, I stash the better verses
Chock full of lines that even make the Lord nervous
Flow's fancy like all cursive
Laying down scripture with the Hebrews
Genius is what he brews
A blessing to witness everything that I've seen
No transgressions to my style it's just that clean
No second guessing now did you get the lesson
That I'm heavily stressing
If not then you're a lemming
Moving onto greener pastures
While you deal with meaner bastards
I conceal the evil mask and then reveal the genius patent
So sad how I give these lyrical gems free
Don't even write now I just type, digital MC
Immune to your poison like a Redguard
So I casually jet off
While you're stuck in traffic like a Czech broad
Don't guess answers without knowing the sum
But if you want it then I'll flaunt it as I descend from the sun
That's how it's done
One"Things take a turn for the worse"
"Send him back where he came from"
"We got shots fired down the street"

[Doom]
Ba-di-yahhhh
Alright, steady
Ba-di-yah, ba-di-yah

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded then {*AHEM*}

Good to the last drop niglets
Hood 'til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses' dicks or higher
Beatwalkers still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth, play alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them nosy federalies yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your Nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell get lighted on sight
The ringer's on a need-to-know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you're on your own, acted alone
Back home your fam'll be provided for while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice bring back eyes, fingers, toes and pictures
Send copies to those who singin' the blues
Mothers and fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send them a message, let them P.O.W.'s go
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty
A new way to let the shots spray
A few drops a day, double espresso, D.A. latte
No smell nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor paid to get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stresses
A long list of C.O.'s names and addresses
A fake judge with many years on the bench
That sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched
The whole system scared in doubt with a fear stench
And she was tortured, some say post-mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught him
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part when Terminator killed Tookie
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded, son, then shit
Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud, red flood

"Villain"

[Outro]
One of the things we ran into the unknown
We we couldn't get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to
And once we did, finally pull the door and breach the interior door
There's a man trapped inside of it
Basically that man trap is a cage
'Fore we run in, we're stuck in there and they can shoot us
While we're just, we're stuck in a cage[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Living off borrowed time, the clock tick faster
That'd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
Dick Dastardly and Muttley with sick laughter
A gun fight and they come to cut the mixmaster
I-C-E cold, nice to be old
Y2G stee twice to threefold
He sold scrolls, lo and behold
Know who's the illest ever like the greatest story told
Keep your glory, gold and glitter
For half, half of his niggas'll take him out the picture
The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta
Villain: a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare
When he have the mic, it's like the place get like: "Aw yeah!"
It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
Just keep ya eye out, like "Aye, aye captain"
Is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody ain't hear it
And can they testify from in the spirit
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got "Ooh Lords"
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
Or even one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it
It's like the end to the means
Fucked type of message that sends to the fiends
That's why he brings his own needles
And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
Slip like Freudian
Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion

[Outro]
When he had the mic you don't go next
Leaving pussy cats like why hoes need Kotex
Exercise index, won't need Bowflex
And won't take the one with no skinny legs like Joe Tex[Verse 1]
That history class make me think back, how people react cause I wrote my words with a lit match
Red had me bionic, blue tonic, water looks crystal wrong and gold poses as strongest
Ironic how leaf green wasn't the chronic,but they add fire ahead so they just go along with it
Yellow the og says they see me roll, life story and shit on my tv show
Putting 2 stadiums and a camera in N64, colosseum and darkness for a GameCube flow
But hell, new year, same career, training monsters something fierce
Thinking of names with a pen, now we starting giving it names after gems
Emerald, sapphire, ruby, writing without trying, pearl with platinum and added diamond
Gave hearts to AU, soul to silver too
Now just saying black and white cause were running out of names to do
Another sequel? Maybe a few
As long as the nineties babies think it cool, but the number of the is over done, true
Have we bitten off more than we can chew?
Let me excerpt from the fact it gets me addicted, screen in my face acting as if training was my mission
Listen, to the 8-bit tracks causing nostalgia, listen to the tracks making you want to be a master
Settled down trapper, feel good rapper, niggas come back around like the ring of Saturn
I was addicted to sitting on sky pillar but its funny how things can change nigger[Verse 1]
Alex Jones,
Yeah I'm goin' nuts for standin', cold
Yeah I'm Bruce Banner, mixed with Shan and Combs,
I am coming for the spot and I will stand alone
And ain't noone gon' stop me nigga, I'm plantin' poems
Then I watch 'em grow, bring me the fame
Yeah I rock the house and leave the stage in flames
I burn down the game then I come back save it
I'm like a necromancer spittin' this depraved shit
Then commit necrophilia, Hip-hop is dead and gone, from long, but damn, she shoulda shaved it
Made it easier for me to bust but fuck it
There's a hole, there's a hole, there's a hole in your bucket
Comin' back a kingpin like I was Noriega
I never liked em, but damn, why you niggas such haters?
I'm tryna get on tryna take over the games
And these niggas on the sideline jeering 'cuz they lame
I might as well shit on 'em like I was Kobe-Shaq
And there I'm gone and I ain't never ever comin' back
I'm outta your grasp, no skinny, no fat
Tit for tat, like that, pick pack, and I'm piercing the Peking order
With they dick in one hand like it was a penny porno
Sticking up the rap bank like I was a wrecking baller

[Hook]
Alex Jones

Alex Jones
Alex Jones

[Verse 2]

I'm breaking down the dam, like damn, he's an ape beast
Don't fuck with the pictures, I don't fuck with a say cheese
Always bust off on the beat, never fuck with the safety
But that's just me, tryna guarantee an offspring
Bust a nut, never call, I'm guaranteeing Kong's King
When I come through
I'm bout to take it over and I got an heir
And why you lookin' that way 'cuz the king is here
Leave trails of Sour D, soaked in LSD
So when you light it up, you just fell in deep
And the game got in you in its clutches, like Ray Allen,
I'm never fallin' six feet deep, the way Nas is
But I built up my own road
Never need another's help, 'cuz I got my own
Grew up by myself, yet was not alone
'Cuz I got my family and I got my home
Yeah I got my crew with me, hittin' spliffs to the dome
Right here gettin' lifted, kick back and spit poems
Killin' the track, read R.I.P, Sherlock Holmes
Airborne rockin' Jordans on my phone
And then I rock the rim like Shaq or Dwight Howard
Dunk it down nuts in your face I ain't no coward
Bring it down glass showers
Sit back smirkin' in yo face like Bowser[Verse]
So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
Daily told the people "You can call me Your Majesty!"
Keep your battery charged
You know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter
Peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (Your mother)
Don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try
Villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you
It's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

[Outro]
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop!* like snot bubblesThe chapter of the saga, fast narration, causin'
Track elevation horror slash meditation noggin
The martyr danced on, the father lost the ransom
For his mom and handsome son, shot a random thug
Slugs in the Kevlar, gun fun
Settle on the fund from the lust, trust shunned, slums bare arms
The poorest village mourn the form of its children
The norm was timid, scornin' orange trimmings for a livin'
Don't underestimate the child with revenge
In his eyes, he repents on the lives that he sends
To the sky, in defense, he relies in the lens
Tried twice by the feds, shied right from the pen
Nine times he extends lines, writing with a pencil
Mental reading, leaving heathens bleeding like a menstrual
Even Stevens, grew up in evening gutter sewers
Nothin' newer, somethin' functioned crueler, eating guts and stomach ulcers
All he needed was to look up to someone older
A role model, cold, hollow, non-sensical
Cold followed, slo-mo goblin showin' off
To Shaolin showmen, silence, throw 'em in a bottle
Poem-wrote boss

The final battle lured the ripped child and his daddy
Blind samurai, sword lie straight gripped in his hands, see
Shot hollows at his feet, and yelled, "dance"
Failed as a male dad, pale, stale, jail, well-advanced
He consents all the pain in the village
'Til the strangest scent of anger swayed, tempting the children
To gather all weapons, fathom all sections
On camera, caught pictures of the family, all massacred[LYRICS]
For a second forget whether I am in the pocket or out
Take your brain out of your pocket and listen to try to understand what I am talking 'bout
All I ask is that you walk around my chalk on the ground
Admire from a far without trying to alter my clouds
Cause then it all gets rained over
I reign over the kingdom ain't no stopping the takeover
Like [We runnin' this rap-] Stop, now understand I'm stunning these rap cliques
And everybody's wanting a classic but you ain't gonna get that if you are stuck in the past
It's a prejudice against the game today, you see I hate to say it but it seems we're scared to rate better than Ilmatic
I ain't trying to outdo Earl or Capital Steez, I just happen to be
Rappin' with ease as a passionate teen
15 living with a stuck shift key
I swiftly spit 16s through trip beams
To get in the rap game, that's mission impossible
Everyday I face a different obstacle
Everybody's giving advice and I can't listen to all of you
Cause then when I make it I'll feel like I should be mentioning all of you

"The person with the experience is never at the mercy of the person with the argument"

Well, that all depends on perception
Sanity as well, now let me lend a suggestion
The industry needs to stop bickering over legends
That already made it and take a look at the next generation
So while you argue over Pac vs. Big
Remmeber not every new emcee is an obnoxious kid
And I'm not trying to say I'm anything special
Cause I'm just like the rest . .

Come out to show them

{*guitar sound, coughing fit*} Music (bad weed)
Listening to music while stoned is a whole new world (to' up man)
Most cannabis consumers report it second only to sex
And grass will change your musical habits, for the better

{"Soon as he start sleepin, catchin you off guard"}
{"If you'll all gather closer at the phonograph"}
Where Quas at? {"Yo!"} Doom, you got the trees?
{"America's most blunted!"}

[Verse 1: MF Doom]
Quas, when he really hit star mode
Never will he boost loose Phillies with the barcode
Or take a whole carload on a wasted trip
Or slit White Owl laced tip from tip with yip
Some rather baggies others like their cracks in vials
Catch a tag, roll a bag of schwag in a Black'n'Mild
He twist Optimo, just the raw leaf part
The list top go: bust before beef start
At the Stop'n'Go Mart, actin like a spirit host done it
{"America's most blunted!"} Yeah, yo
DOOM nominated for the best rolled L's
And they wondered how he dealt with stress so well
Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
Some say buddha'd, some say faded
Someday pray that he will grow a farm barn full
Recent research show it's not so darn harmful (true)
Sometimes you might need to detox
It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beatbox
Off spite to your surprise
Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes
Tear a page out the good book, hear it how you want it

Doom! The Madvillain killin mad boom
Consume weed and drink brew 'til we perfume the room
The beat conductor smoke twenty-four/seven
Shady.. you can even ask my reverend
Willie knows, how the Phillies roll, really though
I spend my last dough, to pick up the sticky gold
I spark the lah, but don't {fuck} with speed or trees with seeds
Quasimoto crew, we get keyed
The most blunted on the map
The one astro black, in the alley, with a hoodrat
Hoodrat.. when you try to react
{*belch*} Even your pops got smack
Even your moms got crack
Meanwhile!! While my bowl got packed
(Do you?) Drop X so you can have good sex (What, no)
I smoke dank so I can grow me a shank
I got the fat sack {shh} all day I'm on it
Who are we? {"America's most blunted!"}

[Verse 1: Quasimoto]
Yo living in these times of life is getting hectic
We got to find a method to survive the head trips
I wonder every day if this is how it was meant to be
Looking at society, police always eying me
Plus my girlfriend keeps trying me (where the fuck you going?)
She thinks she can buy me
To cover up the mind see
Pretty soon she's gonna be crying see
When I have to tell her about these kids on the way from these other broads
Shit's about to get odd
Everybody makes mistakes
Some make more than others
A statistic like crackhead mothers
[?] in the gutters
Drinking nightrain pumping needles in their veins
Trying to maintain while the rich weight game
The situation's from taking the wrong path
It'll lead you to your doom from not doing the math
Am I confused or

[Interlude]

[Verse 2:Quasimoto]
Yo nigga used to be a breakdancer
But now he's lying up dying of cancer
Doctors can't find the answer
He used to smoke mad cigarettes
Nigga get like three packs a day and straight smoke em away
Now he gotta pay run away to go out
Wasn't about the game on the [?] getting the ho out
The sister copped AIDS from going raw skin
She still hoin' the pastor monk's men
Lookin' all fly but you can't tell from the size of the thighs
Waiting for you is a deadly surprise
My niggas ain’t listening still
Cause y'all blinded
You got your mind washed
Always thinkin' one-sided
Am I confused or

[Outro][Verse 1]
So before we hit the freeway
Road-trip hit the speedway
Gold chips and cheap Flakes
Friends in the car playing dj
Man at the counter
Don't think that he'll see me pay
Tall dark-skinned nigga
Grabbing drinks like it's a heat wave
I know I'm looking awkward
And what the fuck is proper to assume
When this gloom ass nigga
Walk through the room
With his hands in his pocket
Looking like he got the Glock cocked
And ready to pop it
If he need to drop a bitch
But I ain't gotta pop shit
I got the dollars in pocket
But old pops is convinced
I'm lacking knots and
It's bout to go down
The shotty under the counter
I could tell his hand was on it
He was ready to sound it
I got the cash out and walked to the bar
Meanwhile, the white homie getting out of his car
At the end of the day
We hit the trail and peeped a white van
Ironically though
The store was robbed by a white man

[Verse 2]
So now we on the road
But end up getting stopped for what?
Cops on us
We lost as fuck
The racist pigs is mocking us
Joking 'bout the North Star
But its morning time the faggots
Why this fat pig just gotta mess with some black kids?
Push comes to shove
The cops start shoving and getting violent
Whooping our ass reciting
"We have the right to remain silent"
Then they get us off the ground
And take us to the car
Trying to figure out
Why in hell we behind bars
That cell ain't no joke
Good thing I had my blokes
Cause niggas was either getting played for pussy
Or trying to play with throats
It def sucked ass
But at least it wasn't a boring trip
And here we are now
Posted up and recording shitNo introduction please
Just padding for these suckers knees
Running on the clock, So father time couldn't fuck with me
All I want in life, Is a Asian bitch with some double d's
Plan to chill with Paula Deen, After scoffing some Lima Beans
Butt-hurt niggas constantly ask "What's fucking wrong with me"
Claim I'm an atheist, Still priest act like they in love with me
Subtlely rip my notebook when lyrics begin to fumbling
Vinyl fits my taste when my tummy begins the rumbling

Holy shit, Emerging from the coldest pit
On my second life, so never write is how I cope with it
All I do is sit back and watch toons on some smoker shit
Sneaking out to board and mommy is hardly noticing
They say I'm on a Island, but really I'm hardly coasting in
I just need the paper, Cause electric bills are closing in
Room full of roaches, God damn who let the posers in
Jesus take the wheel, Guess I'll crash into a boulder then
Failing all my classes, But I still ask "How cold is him"
Tracks seem highly flammable, Braces brackets are smoldering
They say that I'm an addict, The way I'm constantly smoking them
Beach chair living, The way these niggas is folding in
Brain storms rolling in, Emoticons I'm holding in
Only real niggas, Still Rest In Peace to Soulja Slim
Flagged like I'm holding them, On the low I'm coaching 'em
They say this game is fixed, Well I knew that I supposed to win
Feeling like the chosen kin, All the heat I'm token in
Oops I mean I'm blowing out, And then remove an inch of doubt
Eating beef, I'm filling out
Fuck 'bout what you filling 'bout
My tongue is kind of dry, So I hope that you can hear the drought
Outtie like a root canal, I hope that you can feel me now
Cause I'm not another rapper, Talking 'bout his .40 cal
Verbal bullets, Lay ya down
Tried to keep me locked away, It's kind of hard to cage a sound
BITCH[Madlib]
Everywhere I go I always end up with a pocket full CD demo tapes after clubs at my shows even though I sit back and listen to em with an open mind I find that not even one of them I can press rewind

(Child you really work too hard...every time I see you your're  diggin and diggin and last season you didn't do to well)

Even niggas in limos passin' out they demos, claimin' that they shits like mine, so we do the 6 demo test and roll it out by the time we pass the third song we throw it out

(Get that shit outta here)
(Maybe if you let it grow naturally you'll accomplish much more dear)

Time and time again I hear the same story
(Let me tell you have it's done child)
But when I pop it in me and Dilla just laugh do the math
(If you work all day and your heart ain't in it so why get up and get all mixed up in it cause all you're work will be in vain or is life a losing game you only read just what you saw)[Madlib]
This nigga take it back like blacksploitation flicks
And afros where niggas trying to catch this shit
I was "uhh", three years ago
If you didn't know that we keep it fresh like douche
If you didn't know, y'all need that extra push (when y'all up on the mic)
We're rushing through with raw delight
We're dropping that shit while y'all niggas bite
Speaking 'bout ya copycats (ya copycats)
Ya weak beats and ya sloppy raps (ya sloppy raps)
We come though spreading light
While ya weak lyrics spread negative hype
We kicking true forms of music, sketches of sound increase
Niggas try to stop the force, (you know we on course)
Thinking that they have the source (when ya catch 'em, show 'em no remorse)

[Wild Child]
Hey man, I've got a question for you
Can you feel me? Speaking on you wack MC's
Ya saying "Not really", that's cuz I cut ya hands off
Time to set the story straight, brothers looking for their fate
You was that nerd fake cat who went to school at Lambda Lambda
Trying not to recite the rhymes so you bite the poems
I slap your lip, so you talk sideways like Sly Stallone
Face the truth, my fists are guided to knock your left tooth
Lyrically, ya moms rhymes better than you and she's deaf mute
Step two times to the left, throw up ya fists
Direct 'em towards those wack MC's please as I reminisce
You might have more dollars than you have common sense
The LP's stand ground like Hercules
Let's take that fake cat, break back and make black
People around the world realize they trying to play us like 8-track
I formulate rhymes to educate all those who's killing
Music be the only way to express how I'm feeling
Ya conniving like Clinton, with more nerve than, Judge Judy
You'd be a good ass looking girl because ya rhymes sound booty

[Madlib]
But on that subject, on talking bout ya wack MC's
Ya comin' like counterfeit (phony)
But back in the days y'all wasn't no killas, gambinos, or gangsta G's
Y'all up on some other shit
(Talkin' bout ya shooting off clips)
Yo, we waiting for the Mothership
But most of y'all niggas is the reason that half of us brothers have split
(Yo, it's a damn shame)
You know I'm kicking true to the game
You know I am to keep it real
Like my nigga Kaz, I'm letting off battle drills
I'm your replacement (replacement)
Madlib up in the basement (Madlib up in the basement)

[Wild Child]
Now on that subject,(What you talkin' about, cat?) talking 'bout ya wack
MC's
We drop a soundpiece, we keep it, we keep it, we keep it real
Not like them fake gangsta G's
I rock the mic and strike while dictating light
I'm peaking, you keep weakening like Kryptonite
Yo, what I'm tired of, absence of the High Above
Niggas riot up, and then blame it on the blaze they've fired up
So I'm bringing back something that was never lost
Cuz you know we can't just forget about them peeps who's strictly conscious
The 8-0-5 niggas got soul like Kato
When you swing I'll block blows, rock roll the cradle
So, ay yo, on beats I'm like the Tazmanian Tornado
Wild Child live from the 5 that be 8-0![Sample]

Alright here's another song, now
You have to listen carefully
We want you to listen to the next song
I think this next song
This is about a guy who doesn't care about your health
All he cares about is
If he can get that money from you

[Verse]

Watch him eat away the masses
Brass fist ass kicking these bastards
Gas passed
Every time a nigga hits the lab
Attire monocle, suede gators, button up and khakis
Black skinny ass
Runs charities for his cash
Whoop ass like Cassius
Cashing million dollar stashes
AFLAC ducking these whack nigga's that's actin'
Told a nigga spit mics in half call it tough love
Now, when I spit nigga's get hits like seeing slug bugs
The more the merrier
Fuse short as the leg on a newborn Cairn Terrier
Ain't no comparing him, Laxx
Hierarchy life
Stationed in the underground
Nigga's falling off like the two year olds that run around
Bronchitis cardiac attack for the vocals
Mingle with the hierarchy playalistic locals
Penicillin lyrics got these nigga's feeling woozier
Middle finger to negotiations with the Lucifer
Say she my baby won't you suck it like a pacifier
Too explicit
Bet you remember him like a Zechariah, nigga[Hook]
Silly girl to be a fool
You didn't play the golden rule
Cause once you're through with one world
There's another waiting there

[Verse 1]
Y'all motherfuckers walk around like you got a wire
My watch face the same size as a Ducati tire
Everybody hit the deck when the shotty fire
Vinnie give your team problems like I'm Stoudemire
Your fam should be ashamed of you still
This ain't a cookout but Vinnie put the flame to your grill
You claim to be real but y'all just end up painfully killed
My four-fifth is vicious, cold enough for Satan to chill
I don't give a fuck cousin, everybody can fry
Everyone could be a victim, everybody could cry
Only a real man look another dead in the eye
And tell him that he only got like twenty seconds to die
I'm slow but I realise that's my best pace
My voice raw, when I spit it crack through my chest plate
I ain't the type of motherfucker to test fate
The type of motherfucker to increase the arrest rate
Streets fucked up suffering bad
There's no kush, motherfuckers stuck hustling skag
Yeah, same ones get stuck with the mag
Hard rock turn to rubble cause he's fucking a fag

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'mma go hard 'tll nothing is left
Till there's nothing left in the world, nothing but death
And the .38 tucked in my vest
And I stare at my guns like they're a pair of voluptuous breasts
I don't care, I'll take one in my chest
If it means seeing my father again and maybe touching his flesh
I'll walk around with thirty guns in my sweats
If it means that I'm eating and my mother eating, son of success
I see the world different than y'all
I have more determination and persistence than y'all
It's probably why I have such a resistance to y'all
It's probably why I been so much more consistent than y'all
It's business-involved, I'm everything that you could possibly dream
I'm a mathematician, I'm a vision, I'm a machine
Know what I mean? I roll with brothers pushing rock to the fiends
Roll with brothers who love their mothers, stay on top of their Deen
Louie Dogs rap harder than most
And I got something that rearrange your face and turn your pop to a ghost
You get rocked with the toast
And I make you put your hands up like people that are talking in quotes[Verse 1]
(You ain't no astronaut) but we've been out there in orbit
And walked further than the moon ain't we?
(Ain't we?)
Ten to one if you found a dude
Straighten you as good as me
Wouldn't be no more angel than me anyway

[Interlude]
Ain't gon' pull no train on you
No freight train anyway
Maybe one or two after the surprisee
He's first cause it's his party
First as far as they'll know anyway
Anyhow it look like rain tonight anyway

Come on
Come on

[Verse 2]
(You're actually going somewhere?)
Look out for a Double D
She lying I'm tellin' ya, who you gonna believe her or me?
(Besides I love you)
You ain't no astronaut but we've been out there in orbit
And walked further than the moon ain't we? (Ain't we?)
Who wants to be full of regrets when old father time taps
Life don't give no green stamps
(Ten to one if you found a dude)
That could straighten you as good as me
Wouldn't be no more angel than me anyway
Yeah we've been out there in orbit
And walked further than the Moon ain't we? Ain't We?
Just between you and me, you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me, you...
