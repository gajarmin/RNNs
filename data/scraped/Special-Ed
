[Hook]
Straight from Crooklyn, better known as Brooklyn
Never taking shorts cause Brooklyn's the borough

[Verse 1: Special Ed]
Panic, as another manic depressant
Adolescent stares at death, now what's left
When there ain't no guide, and a whole lot of pride
It might be a homicide, so let the drama slide
We don't want no problems, B
Get your name in the obituary column sheet
Cause life is too short and it just gets shorter
I wish I had a quarter for all my people they slaughter
Last year alone, in the dead zone
Walk straight but don't walk late
Cause I'm coming with a hate only made from what it made me
Cause nobody ever played me
Now it's only getting worse
Buckshot and Ace in the land of the waste
Kicking you in your face

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
We be doing it up Crooklyn style
What does it take to get you wild
My mentality is getting iller, killer
Instinct that's trying to infiltrate, but wait
I know you wanna enter but I can't let you in
My mind state's the maddest, I'm gone with the wind
Because it is survival of the fittest
When the shit hits the fan I got my shank in my hand
Black man with the permanent tan
I come from the 'ville and never ran, damn!

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
I'm feeling another part of reality
Hit me when I represent the F.A.P
Straight from the 'ville, Tilden played the building
I mean literally when I say I make a killing
For my cipher, see I'm finning to bust a piper
Original heads represent the Brooklyn all-nighter
Do or die I'm saying it's you and I
Bring your click so we can get stone like Family Sly
Peace to C.I. and the Bush
Mighty Mateen, Ruck and the Rock giving the push

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Masta Ace]
We did it like that and now we do it like this
We did it like that and now we do it like this
Go inside your mind and find a time that you miss
And just think about the steel in your fist
It's just an extension of your arm, it's that ghetto type of charm
That makes all the homeboys swarm
Can I drop the bomb, oh yes I can
Move with the groove, smooth like Geechie Dan
Who is the man, that kid there
Who is the chick with the pick in her hair
Angela, uhh, Davis and we roll like Avis
Rent-a-Car kid, there you are

[Verse 5: Special Ed]
You know where to find me whenever you need me
If you know the Ave, follow the path
To the land of the aftermath but don't frolic in the midst
Crazy ass Crooklyn kids
Cause they always throwing a body on my lawn
I'm getting a Rottweiler without a collar
Get off my block, boy and give me a dollar
For the trouble, or get blown up like a bubble

[Verse 6: Buckshot]
Let's take a sec to think back
To the year of the 7-0 when Brooklyn was the place to go
Flow on a journey up to Crown Heights
Ebbets Field, feel the reel to reel on your life
Trife individuals live in the PJ's
Dee Evil, check my DJ, hey
Play what I wanna play in the day
But in the night, I feel the right took the left
Bucktown, Brooklyn, break it down
Heads from state to state, travel as I unravel the rate
Howard, Tapscott & Sutter
I remember way back in the days playing hot peas and butter
Brother, if you want another lesson, Crooklyn session
Take it back, black Smith and Wesson

[Verse 7: Special Ed]
Press your luck, you get stuck by Buck for your bucks
Masta Ace has the taste for ducks
And duck sauce so tell Lord Digga
Dig a grave for the bones, sticks and stones
While I kick some ancient poems through your domes
Act went back to attack your homes
So, Tip, can I flip? (Yes, you can)
I'm in the World War with Muhammad, my man

[Verse 8: Masta Ace]
Feels so good to be a Crooklyn Dodger
Uh-huh, what's happening to ReRun and Roger
I think I seen 'em wearing Timberlands and running down the block
From Dwayne and Dwayne had a Glock
Cause he be selling rock for the Partridge Family
And Reuben Kincaid drives a 300-E
And he be pimping Chrissy From Three's Company
Plus he stuck Mr. T for all his jewelry
This is a 70's thing from the days
When kids didn't act so crazed in Crooklyn

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican, but I'm speaking so that you know
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing
So listen to the lesson I preach
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem
Full of knowledge from my toes to the top of my dome
I'm kinda young--but my tongue speaks maturity
I'm not a child, I don't need nothing for security
I get paid when my record is played--to put it short
I got it made

[Verse 2]
I'm outspoken: my language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I play it cool--cause coolin' is all that I'm about
Just foolin' with the girlies, yes I'm busting it out
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use
I'm creatively superior, yo--I never lose
I never lost cause I'm the boss
I never will cause I'm still
The champion, chief one, won't lose until I choose
Which I won't cause I don't retreat
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street
You're invitin' me, a titan to a battle--why?
I don't need your respect cause I-- got it made

[Verse 3]
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin'
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and--
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Every other month I get a brand new car
Got 20, that's plenty yet I still want more
Kind of fond of Honda scooters--got 74
I got the riches--to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies
Even got a little island of my very own--
I gotta frog--a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti cause I own a percent
Got gear I wear for everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent
So it really doesn't matter--how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes--daily
You burn me--really?
Think, just blink and I've made--a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked-- a million times
Damn I'd be paid--
I got it made

[Verse 4]
I'm kinda spoiled
Cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear--got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted leg--I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growing too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
When the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me--
I got the army brigade
I'm not a trader
If what you got is greater I'll trade
But maybe later cause my waiter made potato 'n' alligator souflee--
I got it madeGuess who's back?

[2Pac]
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press REC on your deck
Here we go, set? Pass the MoÃ«t
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin' to rob me!
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceivin those we believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, "Hi," and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test... of givin
But be thankful that you're livin... blessed
Guess who's back, comin back with the track supplied
By Special Ed and Ak, comin right and exact
I'm fightin it back but now I snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back

Chorus: repeat 4X

"Yes I'm back" -] Special Ed
"2Pac is" .. back!!

[2Pac]
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
One minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin dicks to makin hits, bustin flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, cause they hate my black tape
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, WHY ME?
No lie, niggas cried when they try me
Givin up the roughness, justice
I'mma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back? No longer trapped
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride on the track, get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick. Guess who's back?

Chorus 1.5X

"Yes I'm back, cause I never did front" -] cut 'n' scratchedI am the magnificent!
I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
And I can go on and on for like a mile, a minute
I get in it like a car and drive
And if the record is smash, I can still survive
Cause I'm the man of steel on the wheel that you're steerin'
Or rather playin' on the record that you're hearin'
You might not understand what I'm saying at first
So Action Love, put it in reverse

I'm just conversin' with you, person
This is just a conversation
I'm Special Ed, with the special presentation, hey
I like to play, so for me it's recreation
It's not just a job, it's an adventure
If worse comes to worse, I've got your thirst quencher
But ya gotta buy it, dont' even try it
I don't rhyme for free, no matter how dry it gets
I collect my money in sets
One before the show and again when I jet
So I get mine, and I'm a get more
Cause I'm financially secure and I'm sure
So I don't need your tips or advice
Cause I'm too nice for that, you rat
I can't stand mice, I'm like a cat, kinda frisky
Battling is risky business
You might acquire dizziness, just like whisky
Isn't this enough?
Oh, you think you're tough, cookie
I think you better call your bookie
Cause you can bet your life, I'm gonna play you like hooky
On a Friday, this is my day
When I was through, I heard you say, "Why they dis me like that?"
I shoulda repent
Somebody shoulda said that Special Ed was the magnificent

I am the magnificent
I'm the magnificent, dynamite, super dope, outta sight
Special Ed with my trusty pal
Action Love, the run we shall
Continue to win, yet this is not a game
But I'm 'a play you if say you claim to be better
I hate rumors and I give tumors
And eye jammies get Grammys
Yet I'm not an actor, it's just a factor that we're famous
Don't blame us for nothin'
Action Love is cuttin', I'm on the rhyme
Skin your teeth and it's your beef that I'll grind
Like a butcher, I'll put you on a table
And let my D.J. cut ya
But you're such a little sucker
I might not even touch ya
I betcha whatcha want is just attention
Your mother and your father shoulda used some prevention
Look at all the time and the money they spent
And now ya wanna die against I-the magnificent?
I am the magnificent!
I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
And I can go on and on for like a mile, a minute
I get in it like a car and drive
And if the record is smash, I can still survive
Cause I'm the man of steel on the wheel that you're steerin'
Or rather playin' on the record that you're hearin'
You might not understand what I'm saying at first
So Action Love, put it in reverse[Kleptomaniac]
Why niggas wanna clock me?
Like that dance called the chachi
Don't they know I break motherfuckers into parts like Rocky
Part I, part II, part III, niggas can't fuck with me
My style's knock-kneed plum crazy (what?)
Who's that wild ass motherfucker catchin wreck
Stickin Jamaicans for sound sets outside discoteques
It's Klep the death specialist, Stallone and Stone shit
Stayin high representin for the nine-quint
Ras bad guy, burns the house down like Left Eye
Why try mimic? MC's get broke like speed limits (uhh)
Niggas can't fuck with my metaphors
Canin MC's like they in Singapore; Klep been through more wars
Than Gump or Shore, put together catchin leathers
On the regular, got that net, push me round and Dread stressin a
Trick ho, what the Dread won't know won't hurt
Robbin his workers for they work; now, WHOSE TURF IS THIS?
It's Klep's, the clothes wreckers'
Life interceptor, pussy collector
Got your bitch on my dick and I ain't even stressin her
Check enough sex in her, my styles are regular
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique moves in like the settlers

Hook: Niggas say "Oh my lord!"

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Throw gats to *Guiliani*
Flows tighter than pigeon punani, try me, die G
Dangerous, since my daddy bust me out
The tip of his dick, Biggie Smalls with the wickedest shit
Spit clips, niggas split like bananas
Flavour like Tropicana; orange, mango, peach
I strangle each -- negro for they dough
Niggas get to bendin, got two cases, one pendin
560 V-12 engine, women spinnin
In 9-2-9 Mazda's, Tammy and Natasha
The menage-a-trois around my way
Like Ill and Al Skratch smokin 50 sacks in the back of Ac's
Windows cracked, so sit back relax
Yo Vec, crush the hash, the Beretta's in the stash

Hook: repeat 4X

[Kleptomaniac]
What you doin with yourself? Stone heart's the way to wealth
Indecisive thoughts make sentences get dealt
Money makes the world go round, robbin shit
Fuck a job shit, niggas want cribs, bricks and spliffs
All-wheel automobiles, traction control
For clay roads, rollin with dough, kickin game
On the cell with bitches on hold, that's how we roll (uhh)
Rhymes now tight as hell so to the bank I stroll (uhh)
Money on my mind, open lips from my eyes
Reveal pupils shaped like dollar signs --

[Notorious B.I.G.]
-- the world is mine!
Niggas frontin, feelin twelve gauge pellets
BIG is repellant, to all that "He say, she say"
We play, Russian roulette, fuck the threat
Your whole crew's vagina, you and your co-signer
Nigga, we rollin in eight and a halfs, TV's in the dash
Three G's in the stash, see we love the cash
No coke, then get some more

Hook

[Kleptomaniac]
Niggas don't know bout my game, they don't know
How complex it is, baggin bitches in GS 300 Lexuses
And the sex is for summer sports
Passports for drug transports to remote resorts
Bitches with Donna Karan "Catwoman" suits, matchin figure boots
Haircut cute, on tops and garters like prostitutes
My lyrics explicit
Got bitches bringin they own condoms on the first visit

[Notorious B.I.G.]
If Biggie bring big bowls of beef
Backin bitch niggas down, burners bring bundles of belief
Common thief, slash drug chief, syndicated
Went from 10 K, to 24 K and motherfuckers hate it
J.M. sedated, quarantined (uhh)
BIG for President, buckin shots past the spleen
9 millimeter dream, Mac 11 nightmares
Electric chairs, which MC's do you fear?
Big Poppa, Junior M.A.F.I.A., nuff said
Niggas disrespect just are dead...(Think about it)		--] Rakim

[ VERSE 1 ]
Sometime I wanna rhyme, but then again I must wait
For the approaching of a toy to introduce him to his fate
Death, I always try to figure out why
Sucker MC's wanna battle me when they know they will die
In the end, so why pretend you're livin trifle
I'ma rope you up like a cowboy, stifle
Your throat with my microphone cord, cause I'm the lord
Of the rhyme, some people say that they can never get bored
Cause I'm exciting, pleasurable listening
I'm only tryin to show you what your records keep on missing, and
I'm only tryin to help our your crew, and
I know I must forgive ya, cause you don't know what you're doin
So sucker MC's, please think twice
Would you join the navy if you didn't like the gravy and rice?
Think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Think about that, then think about this
If I tried to hit you, do you think that I would miss?
Well, I'm fast, I only hit the center, mass and head
I'm Special Ed, funkadelic relic of the ages
If you like this, then I got pages and pages
Some dumb bubbleyum bubblegum chewin
Chumps be screwin
I the fly, I wonder why
What's the reason for the treason, huh, you wanna die?
I'm high-post, higher than most
Not from France, but I eat french toast
I'm international, I make the cash in all ways
Got dollars in my pocket, cause man, it pays
To be smart, I turn my art into an empire
Cause I grow and grow, so you know I never tire
Got the status and the clout, no doubt
Of all time, I got the rhyme to take you out
Cause my rap is like a trap that you fall into
I'm Special Ed, now who the hell are you?
You're unknown, don't even own a microphone
You can't rap, you make me wanna cap a stone
In your eye, why do you persist to make noise
When ever since I was a kid I never did like toys
I get furious, leavin MC's curious
In a daze, my hits do faze
I recommend you listen to the phrase that pays
Don't jest, you won't succeed
I make you bleed till you need a transfusion
This is no illusion
I know you're gettin blurried, don't worry, it's confusion
Of the mind, don't whine, you can't cry forever
It'll take your life to decipher the clever
Rhymes that I say in the way that I do
Akshun Luv, my deejay, I guess it's on you
But is there anybody better? I doubt it
And if you think you are, I think you better think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The lyrics are suffice, suffice are my lyrics
Idolized by the public, praised by the critics
Worth more than gold, longer than a giraffe
Take em to the pawn shop, get a yard and a half
And I'm the creator of the rhymes you praise
All of y'all with the gall I will leave in a daze
Try to battle me, and I'ma make it my job
To burn you as I turn you like a shishkebab
Cause yo, the style that I portrait is the style of a leader
If you' re really gonna battle me, you're really gonna need a
Whole crew, not two, three or four
You gonna need a whole posse, a mossie or more
Cause I'm strong, rap long, yet the rhymes don't drag
Like a bag full of tricks or a trick in a bag
I'm uprising, surprising
Not a nag, not antagonizing
Cause I'm full of fun, and I got a gun
To kill MC's fresher than me, but there are none
Cause I've looked everywhere
Under every rock, in every chair
MC's they try to hide when I get hot
I know that they hide, but where I know not
You're nothin but a sucker, chump you're scared
You tried to battle me, but you wasn't prepared
You slept, I crept up, shot your drawers
And now you're runnin for your life like you're swimmin from Jaws
But go, I know that you've learned your lesson
Go to church, just confess, and
Tell the preacher you committed sin
You battled Special Ed when you couldn't win
Tried, you cried, you shouted, you pouted
But I told ya - you should thought about it

(Think about it)(We're on a mission) --] Salt-n-Pepa

[ VERSE 1 ]
This is a mission, not a small time thing
Let me tell you 'bout what happened when the phone went ( *ring* )
Well, I was coolin at the crib with this girl Suzanne
And everything was goin just accordin to plan
When the phone rang - yo, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to ignore it, forget it, leave it
Just when things had started goin great
It rang again I said, "Hold up, wait"
Picked up the phone, yelled, "Who the hell is this?"
Somebody said, "This is serious business
There's a tape in the mailbox between your doors
Take the tape from the box, and put it in yours"
I listened to the tape and my mouth just dropped
I picked up the phone, but the man hung up
It said, yo, 'this tape will self-destruct'
I pressed the deck, but the tape was stuck
Oh well, what the heck, I just cleaned up the mess
Opened up the closet, got the bullet-proof west
Loaded up the sawed-off, the double-barrel
The rambo knife with the hunting apparel
Threw on the trench, kissed the girl good-bye
She said, "Special Ed, don't go, you might die"
Started cryin and huggin on me, so I shot her
I said, "Sorry baby, but I gotta do what I gotta

(You're on a mission)
Do what I gotta

This is a mission, not a small-time thing

[ VERSE 2 ]
Took the express on a air force jet
The thoughts in my mind broke me out into sweat
I was thinkin of the message again and again
In particular the name of Lu Chin Chen
Yo, I landed in Japan with intent to kill
You could tell I wasn't jokin by the look on my grill
Took a look at the picture of the man that I was after
A 5 foot 10 black-belt karate master
Knew where to find him, knew where he would be
I turned around and showin up Mr. Chen found me
I looked him in the eye with a stare so cold
I said, "I came to revenge for the rhymes you stole
Now you must die, because that is my mission"
He flipped back, got into a fighting position
The tiger style, the shit was wild
He threw his hands in the air, he started to smile
I said, "You can smile now, but you won't for long
Cause sucker, you'll be sorry that you stole my song"
He said, "Choose your style", I broke fool, I said, "What?"
Pulled out the knife, tried to shove it in his gut
It didn't even cut, I flipped, I started buggin
Pulled out the hand gun, I shot a slug in
His chest, he said, "Buddah bless" and stood proud
Out shot the bullet, Mr. Chen just bowed
So I shot him again - yo, I couldn't believe
Mr. Chen caught the bullet in this two front teeth
Yo, he kicked me on the floor just like I was a child
I got fed up, I fought him Flatbush Style
Stood to my feet, threw my hands to the sky
Shaked him then, I faked him, then I caught him in the eye
He started stumblin, yo, I started wildin
He tripped, busted his lip, I started smilin
Knew he was defeated, but I wasn't done yet
So I shot him with the shotie, then I jetted in the jet

(You're on a mission)
Jetted in the jet

This is a mission, not a small-time thing[ VERSE 1 ]
I was proven effective by a clinical test
Because some couldn't come to believe I was the best
So they tested me, and now they in the clinic
They almost arrested me, because I did it
But I didn't mean to do it
But you had to mess with me, and then you blew it
Now you got to chew it, and swallow it all
I guess that's the way that you bounce the ball
Or somethin like that, my mother always told me
Your mother always told me, "Baby, hold me"
Don't get mad because you don't get g's
And I get extra cheese like pizza
You can't keep your girl because you can't please her
But let's get back to the fact that's been approven
So let me prove it, come on, let's move it

(Come on)
(Yeah y'all, come on)	--] Flavor Flav

[ VERSE 2 ]
I spent time with the rhyme like a person
Rehearsin like a verse in a chapter
Of a play, but I rap to
Not make money
Though you might find it funny
But hey, I do it cause I like it, plus it is constructive
Enriching to the mind, cause it's mentally productive
And I am one who seeks special education
Cause I can't learn from the system of my nation
Or should I say my residence run by dead presidents
Cause my mother and brother and father are
]From the motherland of another land called Jamaica
Some of them say God, some of them say Jah is the Maker
But I say why say and who is to say
Cause you make yourself what you are today
And only to yourself do you have to prove it
So come on, let's move it

(Yeah y'all, come on)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Straight from the heart and a shot to the brain
To the hand on the pen and then flaunt the fame
And fortune, suckers I be schorchin and torchin
On and on to victory, me, I be marchin
Each and every day, reachin out to pay
My respects and checks to everybody that helped me on the way
To where I've gotten, thanks a lot and
Everybody out there buyin records by the carton
Thanks to the banks and thanks to the label
Thank you everybody with my record on your turntable
Thanks to the sellers and the distributors
Everybody thank your moms cause she delivered us
Thanks to your pops, he gave the drops of life
Thanks ot the Lord, the sword, the double knife
That I use to fight evil like I fight suckers
Damn, I like jam, so I wanna thank Smuckers
Thanks to my deejay and thanks to my producer
Thanks to the girls cause you let me seduce ya
Thanks to the posse around the way
And thanks to the fans that paved the way
You're coming to the jams, throw your hands in the air and prove it
Come on, let's move it

(Yeah y'all, come on)[Hook]
Straight from Crooklyn, better known as Brooklyn
Never taking shorts cause Brooklyn's the borough

[Verse 1: Special Ed]
Panic, as another manic depressant
Adolescent stares at death, now what's left
When there ain't no guide, and a whole lot of pride
It might be a homicide, so let the drama slide
We don't want no problems, B
Get your name in the obituary column sheet
Cause life is too short and it just gets shorter
I wish I had a quarter for all my people they slaughter
Last year alone, in the dead zone
Walk straight but don't walk late
Cause I'm coming with a hate only made from what it made me
Cause nobody ever played me
Now it's only getting worse
Buckshot and Ace in the land of the waste
Kicking you in your face

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
We be doing it up Crooklyn style
What does it take to get you wild
My mentality is getting iller, killer
Instinct that's trying to infiltrate, but wait
I know you wanna enter but I can't let you in
My mind state's the maddest, I'm gone with the wind
Because it is survival of the fittest
When the shit hits the fan I got my shank in my hand
Black man with the permanent tan
I come from the 'ville and never ran, damn!

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
I'm feeling another part of reality
Hit me when I represent the F.A.P
Straight from the 'ville, Tilden played the building
I mean literally when I say I make a killing
For my cipher, see I'm finning to bust a piper
Original heads represent the Brooklyn all-nighter
Do or die I'm saying it's you and I
Bring your click so we can get stone like Family Sly
Peace to C.I. and the Bush
Mighty Mateen, Ruck and the Rock giving the push

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Masta Ace]
We did it like that and now we do it like this
We did it like that and now we do it like this
Go inside your mind and find a time that you miss
And just think about the steel in your fist
It's just an extension of your arm, it's that ghetto type of charm
That makes all the homeboys swarm
Can I drop the bomb, oh yes I can
Move with the groove, smooth like Geechie Dan
Who is the man, that kid there
Who is the chick with the pick in her hair
Angela, uhh, Davis and we roll like Avis
Rent-a-Car kid, there you are

[Verse 5: Special Ed]
You know where to find me whenever you need me
If you know the Ave, follow the path
To the land of the aftermath but don't frolic in the midst
Crazy ass Crooklyn kids
Cause they always throwing a body on my lawn
I'm getting a Rottweiler without a collar
Get off my block, boy and give me a dollar
For the trouble, or get blown up like a bubble

[Verse 6: Buckshot]
Let's take a sec to think back
To the year of the 7-0 when Brooklyn was the place to go
Flow on a journey up to Crown Heights
Ebbets Field, feel the reel to reel on your life
Trife individuals live in the PJ's
Dee Evil, check my DJ, hey
Play what I wanna play in the day
But in the night, I feel the right took the left
Bucktown, Brooklyn, break it down
Heads from state to state, travel as I unravel the rate
Howard, Tapscott & Sutter
I remember way back in the days playing hot peas and butter
Brother, if you want another lesson, Crooklyn session
Take it back, black Smith and Wesson

[Verse 7: Special Ed]
Press your luck, you get stuck by Buck for your bucks
Masta Ace has the taste for ducks
And duck sauce so tell Lord Digga
Dig a grave for the bones, sticks and stones
While I kick some ancient poems through your domes
Act went back to attack your homes
So, Tip, can I flip? (Yes, you can)
I'm in the World War with Muhammad, my man

[Verse 8: Masta Ace]
Feels so good to be a Crooklyn Dodger
Uh-huh, what's happening to ReRun and Roger
I think I seen 'em wearing Timberlands and running down the block
From Dwayne and Dwayne had a Glock
Cause he be selling rock for the Partridge Family
And Reuben Kincaid drives a 300-E
And he be pimping Chrissy From Three's Company
Plus he stuck Mr. T for all his jewelry
This is a 70's thing from the days
When kids didn't act so crazed in Crooklyn

[Hook x2][Verse One]
My flow is vivid
I give it two-hundred percent
That's a hundred for me
And a hundred for the rent
I know whatcha meant, Joe, I gotta flow too
Cause they wack every show I go to
I be leavin'
I don't be believing they be even
Believing they own shit
Actin' like they owwwn, shit
Butcha never will
So you better chill
Or getcha grill, peice, torn by the beast
You get the claws
Across your jaws
Hear the roars
Now we gonna lock the doors
Your trapped in a rap like a def game
A left came, then a right, then a fight came
Then a light came, then an eternal night came
Now your in it, in less than a minute
Don't ever try to battle cause your never gonna win it
You better know your limit boy
You better know your limit

[Verse Two]
I'm here
Not fronichole, but lyrically present
I'm in the flesh, yo, ain't it fresh
I got that Special Ed shit
Slap that dead shit
Now play dis
Now say dis (your the greatist)
I got enough to stuff into the ladies
I rub her with a rubber
But I'm lyrically raw
Protect your neck and double check your jaw
Cause I'm gettin' bummy
A'yo I'm still gettin' money
Yo, ain't it funny
How you can't take the ghetto out the Ed-O
Maybe I'm just crazy

Why I think, I wanna kill my shrink
I see, pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers
And red blood all over, a dead leprechan
With a time bomb tied to it's arm
In Saigon somewhere on a farm
I gotta calm, down
And hit the wright wire
Or fight fire
Maybe it's a premenission, or intuition
Or some kind of vision
But either way, I'm on a lyrical mission

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three]
I think it's because I break the laws of language
Like a sandwich
I eat the whole beat
On whole wheat
Cause it's good for your teeth
Imagine a vaginal nigga like you on the street
Back on the concrete
Feet up
Gettin' beat up
So when we meet up, give your seat up
And rise
The honorable Ed is presiding
Stop biting, stop writing, stop hidin
I hate fish motherfuckers, but I like writting
And snappa, blue fish
I go to one fish two fish
Or some lobster
No I'm not a mobster, but medoddion
If I was white I might say: party on, dude
But I'm the original rude
With the New York talk
So just peep, because the skills go deep
So look, and think about it, before you leap

[Scratch Hook]Guess who's back?

[2Pac]
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press REC on your deck
Here we go, set? Pass the MoÃ«t
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin' to rob me!
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceivin those we believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, "Hi," and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test... of givin
But be thankful that you're livin... blessed
Guess who's back, comin back with the track supplied
By Special Ed and Ak, comin right and exact
I'm fightin it back but now I snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back

Chorus: repeat 4X

"Yes I'm back" -] Special Ed
"2Pac is" .. back!!

[2Pac]
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
One minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin dicks to makin hits, bustin flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, cause they hate my black tape
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, WHY ME?
No lie, niggas cried when they try me
Givin up the roughness, justice
I'mma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back? No longer trapped
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride on the track, get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick. Guess who's back?

Chorus 1.5X

Lucy, I remember Lucy
With the big fat juicy
Watermelons comin out the grocery store
Saw her comin out of the door
I said, "Miss, can I help you with this?
Please don't diss, I just wanna kiss"
She said, "Of course," kissed with force
Suckin on my lips just like she was a horse
I said, "Excuse me, please don't bruise me
Please don't tease or skeeze or use me
I'm not like that, I'm not kinky
Would you please remove your pinky
]From my rear?
Can't you hear?
What's the matter?
Get your hands off your bladder
We're standin outside on a crowded block"
I felt her hands goin down on my sock
It said Polo, she was so low down
I coulda swore her knees was on the ground
I said, "Damn Ma'am, get on your feet
Be on your way, cause you can't have my meat"
Her eyes started waterin, so I brought her
In the store, to buy some more
Tissue, I said, "Good-bye, I'm gonna miss you"
She said, "No," I said, "Yo ho, ho-ho, merry Christmas"
This must be a gift, have you ever imagined that if
You was a manget, and a girl was a metal filing
Would they all come piling?
On your body, growin like hair, yeah?
Well, just think of me as there
Didn't need a girl, had plans for the day
Wanted to step, but she wanted me to stay
You could say she was disturbing my peace
So I called the police

Cause yo
This ho was low down
(Hoedown)
And this is the hoedown
(Hoedown)
(Hoedown)
(Ho) (ho) (hoedown)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I was coolin on the ave, it was a regular day
Lookin for a girlie, cause I wanted to play
Saw a girl, as I examined her back
Her butt was bigger than a triple dipple Big Mac
As she turned around I had a look at the grill
I said, 'nah - chill'
I turned around, I was about to jet off
When I took a step and bumped into something soft
It was a girl, she was the sweetest thing
Yes indeed, she was a meal, she was fit for a king
I was scopin, but hopin and hopin to rope in
My desire was up, and my resistance was slopin
She said, "Excuse me, but I was wrong
Maybe I came on a little bit too strong"
I couldn't talk, I couldn't even think
I said, "Well, can I make it up, can I buy your a drink?"
She gave a nod to show her acception
To my pleasure, but with one suggestion
Yo, to be alone was the suggestion she had
Which was even better, so we went to her pad
I brought the wine that you call rose
We snuggled up in the couch, yes, we got cosy
She put the glass to her lip, and then she took a sip, and
Tried to get up, but she was slippin and trippin
Did a double summersault, the girlie was flippin
Took a step back, took out the hair clip, and
Unbuttoned her blouse, yes, the girlie was strippin
Put her hands on my pants, the zipper was zippin
Laid me down on the couch, sat down on my hip, and
Straddled up, and then she took a dip, and
The girl was sweeter than a chocolate chip, and
I called her name out loud, I said, Jodie - oh!"
I said, "You must be down with the rodeo
The way you ride, it might sound silly
But you're ridin up and down like Bronco Billy"
Time went by, the sex had stopped
I looked around, I saw Jodie just dropped
What was the matter, yes, the girl was in shock
She said, "Special Ed, I think it was your -
But never mind, I be fine, just chill"
I said, "That's what you get for playin Buffalo Bill"
In a minute the girl recuperated
Gave her some soup for strength and she ate it
I then waited till she finished some soup
And then I said, "Get the hell out, good lookin out, troop"

Cause yo
This ho was low down
(Hoedown)
And this is the hoedown
(Hoedown)
(Ho) (ho) (hoedown)
(Hoedown)
(Ho) (ho) (hoedown)[Verse 1]
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican, but I'm speaking so that you know
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing
So listen to the lesson I preach
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem
Full of knowledge from my toes to the top of my dome
I'm kinda young--but my tongue speaks maturity
I'm not a child, I don't need nothing for security
I get paid when my record is played--to put it short
I got it made

[Verse 2]
I'm outspoken: my language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I play it cool--cause coolin' is all that I'm about
Just foolin' with the girlies, yes I'm busting it out
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use
I'm creatively superior, yo--I never lose
I never lost cause I'm the boss
I never will cause I'm still
The champion, chief one, won't lose until I choose
Which I won't cause I don't retreat
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street
You're invitin' me, a titan to a battle--why?
I don't need your respect cause I-- got it made

[Verse 3]
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin'
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and--
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Every other month I get a brand new car
Got 20, that's plenty yet I still want more
Kind of fond of Honda scooters--got 74
I got the riches--to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies
Even got a little island of my very own--
I gotta frog--a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti cause I own a percent
Got gear I wear for everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent
So it really doesn't matter--how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes--daily
You burn me--really?
Think, just blink and I've made--a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked-- a million times
Damn I'd be paid--
I got it made

[Verse 4]
I'm kinda spoiled
Cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear--got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted leg--I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growing too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
When the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me--
I got the army brigade
I'm not a trader
If what you got is greater I'll trade
But maybe later cause my waiter made potato 'n' alligator souflee--
I got it madeI am the magnificent!
I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
And I can go on and on for like a mile, a minute
I get in it like a car and drive
And if the record is smash, I can still survive
Cause I'm the man of steel on the wheel that you're steerin'
Or rather playin' on the record that you're hearin'
You might not understand what I'm saying at first
So Action Love, put it in reverse

I'm just conversin' with you, person
This is just a conversation
I'm Special Ed, with the special presentation, hey
I like to play, so for me it's recreation
It's not just a job, it's an adventure
If worse comes to worse, I've got your thirst quencher
But ya gotta buy it, dont' even try it
I don't rhyme for free, no matter how dry it gets
I collect my money in sets
One before the show and again when I jet
So I get mine, and I'm a get more
Cause I'm financially secure and I'm sure
So I don't need your tips or advice
Cause I'm too nice for that, you rat
I can't stand mice, I'm like a cat, kinda frisky
Battling is risky business
You might acquire dizziness, just like whisky
Isn't this enough?
Oh, you think you're tough, cookie
I think you better call your bookie
Cause you can bet your life, I'm gonna play you like hooky
On a Friday, this is my day
When I was through, I heard you say, "Why they dis me like that?"
I shoulda repent
Somebody shoulda said that Special Ed was the magnificent

I am the magnificent
I'm the magnificent, dynamite, super dope, outta sight
Special Ed with my trusty pal
Action Love, the run we shall
Continue to win, yet this is not a game
But I'm 'a play you if say you claim to be better
I hate rumors and I give tumors
And eye jammies get Grammys
Yet I'm not an actor, it's just a factor that we're famous
Don't blame us for nothin'
Action Love is cuttin', I'm on the rhyme
Skin your teeth and it's your beef that I'll grind
Like a butcher, I'll put you on a table
And let my D.J. cut ya
But you're such a little sucker
I might not even touch ya
I betcha whatcha want is just attention
Your mother and your father shoulda used some prevention
Look at all the time and the money they spent
And now ya wanna die against I-the magnificent?
I am the magnificent!
I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
And I can go on and on for like a mile, a minute
I get in it like a car and drive
And if the record is smash, I can still survive
Cause I'm the man of steel on the wheel that you're steerin'
Or rather playin' on the record that you're hearin'
You might not understand what I'm saying at first
So Action Love, put it in reverseChorus 2X: "Lyrics somebody want lyrics (yea yea)
Somebody want lyrics" -- KRS-One

Verse One:

Here I go the lyrical specialist with the perscription
I give you the legal drug addiction, non-fiction
I got the shank, to your memory bank
How sharp, don't be afraid of the dark
Go in to the light, you still can't see
It can't be, the historical, metaphorical, oracle
Yes the S, you know the rest, fuck the spellin'
I'm tired of tellin' y'all who rule, cause you don't listen, fool
Your dealin' with a nigga feelin' fury
Surely, I purley destroy any toy with any game
That's why I never lose, I never play, I sever they style
While I maintain mine
Same time  yet, differ-rent, mag-nificent
No quest unless it's the Tribe
So check that vibe twice
Cause I'm nice
Whoever got beef
Tell me the price
And I'll raise you a mill, days to a kill, some praise to a bill
Never, yet I'm as lyrical as ever

Chorus

Verse Two:

You wanna start about, have you thought about
Consequences, sentences, come to your senses, or defenses
Cause I'm strictly throwin' hits
Knowin' it's, unfair
Gun here, take an extra clip
Cause I'm next to flip
Next time, bring in a next rhyme, cause I
Float like dead body, sting like a tazer
Sharper than a ... lazer
Open heart ... major
Surgery transplant cause you have none
Heres one, I dare Son, shoot a fair one, that's a real one
Grannit, you're now implanted with a enough heart to start
But can you manage when I damage your bandage
And your stitch is open
And your bitch is open
Is she, somethins' fishy
I don't like dis
When I'm like dis they try to ammulate my likeness
Clones
Microphones break from my intake
Faar phatter, mass matter, glass shatter
Be careful, I got an earful
Listen, I got them lyrics that your missin'

Chorus 3X

Verse Three:

You're commin' with your new sound
You never threw dowm
Why try? Try Muay Thai, hang em' high, in the closet
Cause it, wasn't, a good idea
Who should I fear
No one, the son of Jah
Gimmie some lah, and I get mystic
Lyrics dis thick, got weight
Your not great, your not good
I shot wood, put you out your misery history in the makin'
Fuckin' with a crazy Jamacain
See, they vanish when I brandish the hair trigga
Yea nigga
I'm goin hay wire
Might fire
Might not
But it's white hot
And with the right flow, the shit might blow
So I detonate, then evacuate, leavin' ash, don't even ask
Feel the blast, fast, I know you won't last
But you can still try
Somebody want lyrics
Then come see the eye

Chorus 3XMonster jam

This is a monster jam

[ VERSE 1 ]
This is a monster jam
I'm a vet, yet I never been in Vietnam
But come to think of who I am
It's not amazing that you're praising all the lyrics I flam
When I'm bustin a discussion to the percussion
I leave it to the Flatbush Crew to do the rushin
Cause I'm kinda laid back, MC's please stay back
If you try to riff, you'll be stiff on the way back
Home, inside a box with bottles and rocks
I know the time, you know why? because I got nuff clocks
In my house, always like to know the time of the day
Take a shower every hour to be sure that I stay
Fresh and never less, because I don't like germs
On the mic I like to psyche by usin phrases and terms
That only I could begin to comprehend
And understand how I use and choose the lyrics that blend

Monster Jam
This is a monster jam

I got the dope hype--type style
Try to bite, we might fight and you will not smile
Cause I'ma damage and ravage, you are a savage
I'ma choke your mediocre, novice, average
Ass into a pulp, then I'ma gulp ya up
]From out a cup and leave you without a hope
I'm only dope, yo, I'm just provokin your brain
I like to tease, I like to skeeze, I got a brother named Wayne
And I'm a Taurus, I brush my teeth and also use ???
I'm a king, I like to sing, I got a choir and a chorus
I was born on the 16th of May
You do not have to know the year, just be concerned you hear the day
So you can bring me my crown and then king me
Rejoice to the choice voice, then sing me
A song, make it long, so that I can hear
The praise for days and days and days to the next year

[ VERSE 3 ]
I'm a special professional, my kind is ???
The rhymes are so precise just to the fraction of a decimal
Rhyme, so sensational, I'm very educational
This is a presentation, I guess it's presentational
Yo, I'm Special Ed, I get the bread, I get the cash
Don't steal, I make it, try to take it, get bashed
I am protective and selective when I choose my rhymes
Unlike the other MC's I make g's, not dimes
I got a rhyme to keep you rockin all the time
Like I said I'm Special Ed, if you don't like it - the heck
Cause I'm a slow pace, never race, never smoke the crack base
]From the pipe or the wooler, not a fool, much cooler
Not dunce, smoked once, never ever choked once
Look good, dress fly, love ??? apple pie[Kleptomaniac]
Why niggas wanna clock me?
Like that dance called the chachi
Don't they know I break motherfuckers into parts like Rocky
Part I, part II, part III, niggas can't fuck with me
My style's knock-kneed plum crazy (what?)
Who's that wild ass motherfucker catchin wreck
Stickin Jamaicans for sound sets outside discoteques
It's Klep the death specialist, Stallone and Stone shit
Stayin high representin for the nine-quint
Ras bad guy, burns the house down like Left Eye
Why try mimic? MC's get broke like speed limits (uhh)
Niggas can't fuck with my metaphors
Canin MC's like they in Singapore; Klep been through more wars
Than Gump or Shore, put together catchin leathers
On the regular, got that net, push me round and Dread stressin a
Trick ho, what the Dread won't know won't hurt
Robbin his workers for they work; now, WHOSE TURF IS THIS?
It's Klep's, the clothes wreckers'
Life interceptor, pussy collector
Got your bitch on my dick and I ain't even stressin her
Check enough sex in her, my styles are regular

Spit clips, niggas split like bananas
Flavour like Tropicana; orange, mango, peach
I strangle each -- negro for they dough
Niggas get to bendin, got two cases, one pendin
560 V-12 engine, women spinnin
In 9-2-9 Mazda's, Tammy and Natasha
The menage-a-trois around my way

Windows cracked, so sit back relax

Hook: repeat 4X

What you doin with yourself? Stone heart's the way to wealth
Indecisive thoughts make sentences get dealt
Money makes the world go round, robbin shit
Fuck a job shit, niggas want cribs, bricks and spliffs
All-wheel automobiles, traction control
For clay roads, rollin with dough, kickin game
On the cell with bitches on hold, that's how we roll (uhh)
Rhymes now tight as hell so to the bank I stroll (uhh)
Money on my mind, open lips from my eyes
Reveal pupils shaped like dollar signs --

Niggas frontin, feelin twelve gauge pellets
BIG is repellant, to all that "He say, she say"
We play, Russian roulette, fuck the threat

Three G's in the stash, see we love the cash
No coke, then get some more

Niggas don't know bout my game, they don't know
How complex it is, baggin bitches in GS 300 Lexuses
And the sex is for summer sports
Passports for drug transports to remote resorts
Bitches with Donna Karan "Catwoman" suits, matchin figure boots
Haircut cute, on tops and garters like prostitutes
My lyrics explicit
Got bitches bringin they own condoms on the first visit

[Notorious B.I.G.]
If Biggie bring big bowls of beef
Backin bitch niggas down, burners bring bundles of belief
Common thief, slash drug chief, syndicated
Went from 10 K, to 24 K and motherfuckers hate it
J.M. sedated, quarantined (uhh)
BIG for President, buckin shots past the spleen
9 millimeter dream, Mac 11 nightmares
Electric chairs, which MC's do you fear?
Big Poppa, Junior M.A.F.I.A., nuff said
Niggas disrespect just are dead...[ VERSE 1 ]
After I pose for the photos, address the press
I take a rest to let my rhymes digest
Into my brain to sustain and cultivate it
Take a penny for my thoughts, from copper I gold-plate it
Enrich my mind like wine till I find
What I need to exceed with speed, proceed line
Fold it, I take the mic, I grab it and I hold it
Then I walk to and talk to the crowd, cause yo, I sold it
You bought it, you thought it wasn't worth
But the record went gold, it sold, jerk
I'm worldwide, from girls I hide
Not gay, no way, but they all wanna ride
Mine, they bring me roses and wine
But I hate cheap sex, so next time
Come correct like an intellect
Okay, do you hear what I say? Check
Yo, on the rhyme I'm a lyrical joy
And whoever shall front shall be destroyed
The lyrical composer, I produce all legit
My name's Special Ed and yo, your name ain't -
And I'm powerful in my stable mentality
Takin MC's, yes, of any nationality
Blitzin em, dissin em, off I'm pissin em
Makin em solo, broads won't be kissin em
You got taxed, face the facts
Now where's the jokes and all the wisecracks?
You made before you got slayed by the slayer
Special Ed, DJ Akshun on the record player
Chillin, still in the back just maxin
Me in the front, to be blunt, I'm taxin

I'm taxin

[ VERSE 2 ]
When I'm on the mic I make MC's wonder
How I don't make the foul-ups, bleeps or blunders
I'm fool-proof, I'm too couth, too
I got the Uzi for the crew, see, but the hands work for you
I give a fair one, because I never like to scare one
Unless he got a vest and a gun
A like a shoot-out, I like a have a root-and-toot-out
If you like to kick, I got the steel-toe boot out
Cause I'm malicious, vicious on the mic is how I am
And I always do as I like, clause I demand
The utmost respect from you
Because you should give respect where respect is due
To Special Ed, that's my name and that's the title I hold
You're gonna get burned if you wanna get bold
And I'm ready, I let the others call me Eddie
But for you it's Special Ed because I said so, spaghetti
And in the meantime break out the sixpacks and
Cool while I rule, cause I'm taxin

Taxin
I'm taxin
Taxin

[ VERSE 3 ]
Well, if you're lookin for a Brooklyn jam
Here's one you might like about a mic and a man
Well, I be meditatin, then I be waitin for the victim
If they flam then I slam them and kick them
Bite the face, then I taste em and lick them
Like Ray I slay, take a brick and
Brick them, yo, I'm not the typical, massive and large
I'm humongous, but the youngest in charge
In combat I contract with souls like crack
Decompose my foes to the size of toes
Because you get all hype and long-winded
But that ain't it, it's the rhymes that are commended
By the crowd as they start to cheer
With the Cisco, the blunts, and the forties of beer
Cause stimulation is what helps my creations
You know I get mellow before my presentations
Because it helps my rhymes to flow through
Like water, I caught a brew, on second thought a few
To release all the heat that I kept
When I was sober, so now it's overstepped
Aside, and by my rules abide
Protest, yes, and I suggest you hide
Cause I'm comin hummin the song of redemption
Makin stacks, takin tax exemptions
You start to fiend, scream and then holler
For a cigarette, as I get your last dollar
I'm taxin, usin Ajax and waxin
MC's with the fleas in their backs and
Behind their ears and up their butt-cracks and
Keep on till you clean up your act and
Stop hold your nose up like Michael Jackson
Dressin like a bum, cause you don't wear slacks, and
I'm done, thanks, it's been fun practisin
I'm done taxin(We're on a mission) --] Salt-n-Pepa

[ VERSE 1 ]
This is a mission, not a small time thing
Let me tell you 'bout what happened when the phone went ( *ring* )
Well, I was coolin at the crib with this girl Suzanne
And everything was goin just accordin to plan
When the phone rang - yo, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to ignore it, forget it, leave it
Just when things had started goin great
It rang again I said, "Hold up, wait"
Picked up the phone, yelled, "Who the hell is this?"
Somebody said, "This is serious business
There's a tape in the mailbox between your doors
Take the tape from the box, and put it in yours"
I listened to the tape and my mouth just dropped
I picked up the phone, but the man hung up
It said, yo, 'this tape will self-destruct'
I pressed the deck, but the tape was stuck
Oh well, what the heck, I just cleaned up the mess
Opened up the closet, got the bullet-proof west
Loaded up the sawed-off, the double-barrel
The rambo knife with the hunting apparel
Threw on the trench, kissed the girl good-bye
She said, "Special Ed, don't go, you might die"
Started cryin and huggin on me, so I shot her
I said, "Sorry baby, but I gotta do what I gotta

(You're on a mission)
Do what I gotta

This is a mission, not a small-time thing

[ VERSE 2 ]
Took the express on a air force jet
The thoughts in my mind broke me out into sweat
I was thinkin of the message again and again
In particular the name of Lu Chin Chen
Yo, I landed in Japan with intent to kill
You could tell I wasn't jokin by the look on my grill
Took a look at the picture of the man that I was after
A 5 foot 10 black-belt karate master
Knew where to find him, knew where he would be
I turned around and showin up Mr. Chen found me
I looked him in the eye with a stare so cold
I said, "I came to revenge for the rhymes you stole
Now you must die, because that is my mission"
He flipped back, got into a fighting position
The tiger style, the shit was wild
He threw his hands in the air, he started to smile
I said, "You can smile now, but you won't for long
Cause sucker, you'll be sorry that you stole my song"
He said, "Choose your style", I broke fool, I said, "What?"
Pulled out the knife, tried to shove it in his gut
It didn't even cut, I flipped, I started buggin
Pulled out the hand gun, I shot a slug in
His chest, he said, "Buddah bless" and stood proud
Out shot the bullet, Mr. Chen just bowed
So I shot him again - yo, I couldn't believe
Mr. Chen caught the bullet in this two front teeth
Yo, he kicked me on the floor just like I was a child
I got fed up, I fought him Flatbush Style
Stood to my feet, threw my hands to the sky
Shaked him then, I faked him, then I caught him in the eye
He started stumblin, yo, I started wildin
He tripped, busted his lip, I started smilin
Knew he was defeated, but I wasn't done yet
So I shot him with the shotie, then I jetted in the jet

(You're on a mission)
Jetted in the jet

This is a mission, not a small-time thing(Think about it)		--] Rakim

[ VERSE 1 ]
Sometime I wanna rhyme, but then again I must wait
For the approaching of a toy to introduce him to his fate
Death, I always try to figure out why
Sucker MC's wanna battle me when they know they will die
In the end, so why pretend you're livin trifle
I'ma rope you up like a cowboy, stifle
Your throat with my microphone cord, cause I'm the lord
Of the rhyme, some people say that they can never get bored
Cause I'm exciting, pleasurable listening
I'm only tryin to show you what your records keep on missing, and
I'm only tryin to help our your crew, and
I know I must forgive ya, cause you don't know what you're doin
So sucker MC's, please think twice
Would you join the navy if you didn't like the gravy and rice?
Think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Think about that, then think about this
If I tried to hit you, do you think that I would miss?
Well, I'm fast, I only hit the center, mass and head
I'm Special Ed, funkadelic relic of the ages
If you like this, then I got pages and pages
Some dumb bubbleyum bubblegum chewin
Chumps be screwin
I the fly, I wonder why
What's the reason for the treason, huh, you wanna die?
I'm high-post, higher than most
Not from France, but I eat french toast
I'm international, I make the cash in all ways
Got dollars in my pocket, cause man, it pays
To be smart, I turn my art into an empire
Cause I grow and grow, so you know I never tire
Got the status and the clout, no doubt
Of all time, I got the rhyme to take you out
Cause my rap is like a trap that you fall into
I'm Special Ed, now who the hell are you?
You're unknown, don't even own a microphone
You can't rap, you make me wanna cap a stone
In your eye, why do you persist to make noise
When ever since I was a kid I never did like toys
I get furious, leavin MC's curious
In a daze, my hits do faze
I recommend you listen to the phrase that pays
Don't jest, you won't succeed
I make you bleed till you need a transfusion
This is no illusion
I know you're gettin blurried, don't worry, it's confusion
Of the mind, don't whine, you can't cry forever
It'll take your life to decipher the clever
Rhymes that I say in the way that I do
Akshun Luv, my deejay, I guess it's on you
But is there anybody better? I doubt it
And if you think you are, I think you better think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The lyrics are suffice, suffice are my lyrics
Idolized by the public, praised by the critics
Worth more than gold, longer than a giraffe
Take em to the pawn shop, get a yard and a half
And I'm the creator of the rhymes you praise
All of y'all with the gall I will leave in a daze
Try to battle me, and I'ma make it my job
To burn you as I turn you like a shishkebab
Cause yo, the style that I portrait is the style of a leader
If you' re really gonna battle me, you're really gonna need a
Whole crew, not two, three or four
You gonna need a whole posse, a mossie or more
Cause I'm strong, rap long, yet the rhymes don't drag
Like a bag full of tricks or a trick in a bag
I'm uprising, surprising
Not a nag, not antagonizing
Cause I'm full of fun, and I got a gun
To kill MC's fresher than me, but there are none
Cause I've looked everywhere
Under every rock, in every chair
MC's they try to hide when I get hot
I know that they hide, but where I know not
You're nothin but a sucker, chump you're scared
You tried to battle me, but you wasn't prepared
You slept, I crept up, shot your drawers
And now you're runnin for your life like you're swimmin from Jaws
But go, I know that you've learned your lesson
Go to church, just confess, and
Tell the preacher you committed sin
You battled Special Ed when you couldn't win
Tried, you cried, you shouted, you pouted
But I told ya - you should thought about it

(Think about it)[ VERSE 1 ]
I got somethin for sucker MC's
Rhymes so dope that niggas wanna buy ki's
But I don't sell weight, I sell hits
Druggin your mind with em one at a time
I hit em up with a couple of bars
I'm breakin MC's up like rock guitars
At a Kiss concert, but not this concert
Ain't no make-up, you better wake up
Before the sandman come take your hand
I come into your dreams, or so it seems
While you're deep asleep I'm beginnin another scheme
Gettin that dough, hittin that ho
In the video, what a bitty, what a pity
But that's the chance you take when you make it
You get strung when the song is sung
But I don't hit notes, I hit quotes I wrote, so
If you know like I know, you better not try no
Dummy move, yo money, move from the mic
Exit stage right, nighty night
Time for bed with a rhyme from Ed
So put on your pijamas and tell your mamas
Beddy-bye, till you're ready to try once more
Cause I'm takin niggas out like a one-night whore
To the store, so who you're really tryin to fool?
We rule, you know we rule

We rule, you know we rule

[ VERSE 2 ]
It gets harder and harder
Cause everybody got to start a
Kid-type hit, but forget that bullshit
I'm on some hype shit, my style is well developped
When I envelop a mic I would like everyone to get the hell up
I set it off, headed off right to the mic
I let if off like an airstrike
I cover the ground with surround sound
Everybody get down before you're left deaf
So what the eff, a duel to the death
Like Macbeth, so kneel to the left
And bow your head, now Ed will rule
I'm takin niggas out like a trip at school
To the park, leadin you into the dark
Now form a double-line, it's trouble time
Now I got to rhyme double-time
Or triple
Cause MC's suck like nipple
I cripple, but they already lame
I come to claim your name and eat your brain
Right out your skull like a monster
And I do what I wantsta when I wantsta
And I ain't even gotta carry the tool
Cause we rule, you know we rule

We rule, you know we rule

[ VERSE 3 ]
I got rhymes a cop can't stop
They don't even chase, so don't even waste
Gas, I'm too fast, I come equipped to rip, money grip
Cause you the paper
And I'm the Flatbush raper
I rip shit up, your get hit up
I don't take sex, just checks and cash
Stompin niggas out like the Monster Mash
Every single day of the week, plus weekends
You and your weak friends tryin to meet ends
But you can't make em meet, cause you can't make a beat
So now you're beaten, you're meat and you're lookin all meek
You couldn't see me on the highest peak
With a long-range scanner and a antenna
Cause you're fish like a can of
Tune, all on my dock, in my scuna
I see ya later, if not, sooner
So just cool
Cause you know we rule[ DJ Ak-Shun cutting up ]
(Action)

[ VERSE 1 ]
The main attraction DJ Ak-Shun for your pleasure or your leisure
Try to match the scratch and you will end up in a seizure
Strain upon your brain, you can't contain the plain fact
That if you tried to cut this hard I bet your record would crack
Or either break, what does it take to make your hair-do
I have to put a speaker to your ear for you
To say, "Hey, I like the way the deejay is playin"
Cause that's what you'll be sayin
You'll say, "I want a deejay just like that one"
(Inside di action)

(I want action)
(Action)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I'm Special Ed, my deejay's name is Ak-Shun
Put together we're two, yet we're both number one
Cause Ak-Shun got the scratchin, as well as the catch
And I the funky super psychodelic words that match
And we're the best at what we do, in our professions we're the highest
Is it understood, we're very good, if not, try us
One thing to know if you decide to disprespect
Is if you're weak we reserve the right to reject
We don't waste time with toys or weak crews
Wanna rhyme, get in the line, I take you out by the twos
And Ak-Shun, try to battle him, you're gonna need luck
He's a destroyer, he'll destroy ya, make ya self-destruct
Explode like a bomb into pieces, so then
Superglue couldn't put you back together again
And oh, by the way, you say you want satisfaction
Well, all you had to say was (I want action)

(I want action)
(Step back)

[ VERSE 3 ]
What a man, it's Ak-Shun that remarkable man
If you heard that he could do it, he can do it, he can
If you heard it, if you word it with your lips, what I mean
Is that he cuts so clean, you would think he was a dream
You had, the man is bad, yet the man is not a nightmare
I don't think that it's right or rather quite fair
To a new deejay, you '86er
You can't be the man who was born on a mixer
If you think you broke a record, Ak-Shun is the fixer
If you need a remedy, Ak-Shun uv is the elixir
Cause if he picks her, then he gets her and he sticks her
On to the record player and then he licks a
Fingertip for more attraction
And then he makes her say (action) (I want action)[ Special Ed ]
This is not just a hip-hop gig
It's club, it's pop, it's big, you dig?
No small-time, no small rhyme
I won't fall at all, cause I'm
Supported, nothin is extorted
I know you can hear it but can you afford it?
I bet you caught it, stole it, hold it
Don't you know the law detest such acts?
First you purchase, then pay tax
Not take take free and step
Jail is where your kind is kept
It's like a party, know what I mean?
As a matter of fact call it the club scene

Then let you go
And give it to Kazaam, yo

I'm Kazaam, and I'm next
Ed gave the tag, here's the suplex
Here's the pin - we win
Do i have to get physical when we're in

Not the annihilation of a peasant
I'm a lady, know what I mean?
Don't get fed Ed, this is the club scene

Alright Kazaam, I'ma chill
I understand but I can and will
Get ill

Yo Ed, just groove it
And nothin movin
Nothin to be proven
Can't nobody take what's yours

Yeah, I know cause I'ma break some jaws
And bones ,forget sticks and stones
Don't take no shorts, don't give no loans
Well anyway, how much does a penny weigh?
Take your cheap thought, you don't get any say
So shove it
Yo Kazaam, do you like it?
[ Kazaam ]
I love it, I adore it
Hit it, I'm with it, I'm all for it
All against, commence to get overthrown
I'm on the microphone
Therefore, near or afar
When I do a show leave the door ajar
Cause the heat I generate boils water
I can burn any rhyme you ever thought of
No sweat, no Keith
No joke, no smile, no teeth
Yo Ed, tell em what I mean
[ Special Ed ]
Grow up boy, this is the club scene

[ Kazaam ]
Check it out
Take the record out
Put it on the wheels
Tell me how it feels
What is the texture, is it soft or hard?
If it's soft take it off, then throw it in the yard
Let a crackhead sell it
If it's hard memorize it and spell it
Every last sentence
Attend every show I take your attendance
But don't cut out
Because you might fail and your mother might shout
And scream and get real mean
And go (go) no more of that club scene!

One day, let's just say that I was bored
I went for a ride in my new Accord
Sucker MC's were standin outside
Talkin bout, "Yo Ed, let me get a ride"
I said, "You're already ridin on mine"
He raised his tone, and out came the chrome from behind
(Better back up, nigga) "Now continue with yourself
And don't step any further, cause it's bad for your health
And your wealth and your future
Cause I don't wanna have to shoot ya" - (booya!)
And then I went into the store
I wanted some chips, it's a dollar for 4
I gotta get some juice and a loosey
I used to smoke, now it's only 1 or 2, see?
I'm not a bad guy, but I got bad habits
I was raised in the place where they grab it
If they want it (Brooklyn) but I'm not a thief
Plus I'm not a punk, so don't pop junk or beef

I pay for the goods and I make my exit
I walked out the door, and I saw some legs, it
Looked like cheese that I knew

It can't be the rest, because the others are older
Looked like a nice slice, tapped her on the shoulder
(Excuse me) She turned around, started to stare
Grabbed at my hat, said, "Let me see your hair!"
I said, "There won't be none of that, at least not here"
She said, "My man is always snoring, and he's boring"
I said, "So what? You're out here whoring?
What you think you're doing?
I ain't tryin to ruin no relationship
Honey dip, get a grip"
Cause that's the kinda fan I can't stand
When she wanna get wreck and still got a man
So if you got a girl, you better watch her
Because love is blind (got that ass) gotcha

Well now, I got around the way and I just couldn't wait

I parked the ride, and as I stride down the ave
I said, "Oh my, what big thighs you have"
To a slice of cheese and cut-off shorts
She said, "Ain't you Special Ed?," I said, "But of course
But that's not the matter at hand
Do you have a man? Do you understand?
What I'm tryin to say is, well, ??? I'm a little shy
She said, "Why, you're an attractive guy
Plus I seen your videos, all four of them
Can I be in one of them if you have more of them?"
I said, "Yes, there's one next week

And I laid her

Road blocks ahead now I'm caught in-between
No time to think, loading the magazine
I'm going out for broke
No joke
Won't stop till the end of the gun smoke
Won't be framed or blamed
If I get caught then the story will be changed
Only evidence is I've tape recorded
Heads got it on a flight that's now boarded
Told 'em in case of emergency, make a copy

The title that I hold is the fly emcee
Why? Cause I'm fly, yeah, that's me
You see, I'm flier than a flyer to a hip-hop jam
I can even fly higher than a plane from PanAm
Flew, took a flight, yes, to France in the fall
They be cryin when I'm flyin, cause I'm flier than them all
Went to France because I was bored
So I took a flight over on the fly Concorde
On arrival I was greeted by the king of France
The queen, a band playin for the circumstance
Up came the royal crier, he unrolled his scroll and said
"He's flier than the sire and his name is Special Ed"
The king said, "You really think you're really that fly?"
I said, "He read it and he said it," he said, "That's a lie"
I said, "I'm fly, I never lie and, yo, my name is Special Ed
And if you don't get out my face, I'm gonna fly your royal head"
The king tried to call on his royal troops
Pulled out the Uzi and the king said, "Oops!"
Up jumped the queen, she called me a nut
So I kicked her in the butt, then I slapped the royal slut
Said, "Silence! Stop the violence, hear what I have to say - eh"
The tuba played a note, so I shot the tuba player
Hell broke loose, the queen just rushed me
Grabbed me by my pants, began to hush me
Pushed me on the plane, dragged off the shoes
The Levi button fly, 501 blues
Ripped off the shirt, took off her royal crown
Disrobed the royal robe, took off the royal gown
Hotter than a stove, worked me over, she was illin
She was suckin me and fuckin like a heated gorilla
Thought to myself, could this really be true, and
Yo, then I thought: yo, what the hell am I doin?
Gave her her clothes and I said, "Good night"
Opened up the door, but the plane was in flight
She said, "Special Ed, we're in the middle of the sky!"
I said, "So? I know, you don't have to fly," I
Licked the switch and flew the latch
Then I kicked the bitch through the cargo hatch[Scratch Hook] {X4}

Back from Sharom

Are there any goons with flows that froze snows?
So cool, make a fool wanna duel
Can't take the truth, you got proof
See the nigga on the roof? Move slow
He already know, who you are so it don't really matter to me
The badder you be, the better for your rehabilitation
Strap ya down and slap ya 'round
Call ya "Susan", using, abusing
Methods, are nothing

I break down stars, body gasp
You can talk fast and flabbergast most
But I freak flows from coast to coast

From my [?], they don't know the cost
Or the cause
They just applause cause they hear the pause

Wack rhymes and them black on black crimes

You'll get disbarred trying to diss fraud
