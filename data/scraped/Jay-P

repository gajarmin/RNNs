Epopee, who’s that hoodlum doing what he gotta do, I am him, doing what he does to the maximal, no minimal  x2
Verse1
Queries, was he born with it or not
As I grew older I reviewed by introspect
From a filthy lozenge, codes judicious
What’s coming his way
Am now luciferous or just some low bred whatever
I pull up into to so lucent am the real mckoy
Machismo in, gave rap LSS, low down am an efeoff aggressor
Man I visualize emporiums , so eminent nigga ama build a dynasty
Enfilade, I have to enfeeble, make em’ emollient
Do I need an Emmy, ama put the platinum plucks on the wall
The rap game needs me, enfranchise it
Real story, elevated style
I put my name on the hustle, am a legend

Hookx2
Verse2
Life saving rap, turned out to be mouthy
Ain’t no boastful pretender in me
Many branded me an outlaw
Ignored em’ stuck to pietism
Tried to make me face pillory
Swiftly, so quaint, I leave a dunderhead hating
As am turning from dun to paid
Am not ever your piffle
Quadrate to that
My existence is to splice this
Am on the road to the top
I take it by rule of thumb
Rule me out as a slacker
Savvy who I am
Riffraff or not and it ain’t just pay
I got somn to say charmin’ this mu’fk up
Whenever epopee is remembered
N*gga toast to that
Food for thought for y’all

Bridgex2
Not end game for me
Ama keep on empurpling y’all
From the depth of a n*gga heart

I tried to tell you thangs, but you just Never Listen
Wait, let me explain, somehow things seem different
The little games we play, nobody wins anyway!
[Bridge]: If ain't one thang it's another (x4)


[T.Bailey: Verse 1]

A text or call from you make my day uplifted
The fact I know you spyin on me bring a splendid feelin
When I laid eyes, I knew what I wanted  then that moment
You had a spark to you I just wanted to keep it goin
When I look at you, I just feel a sense of security
My ex ain't worked out, bestowed a fear that she was unsure of me
About adjustin, trustin whatever  sounding good
Coming from a mouth who claim they love you but never could
I'm just feeling distant, it feel like we competition
Struggling for power we use to protect our feelings
From past experience, confided in you guess you felt different
If I don't give you attention, you go out on a hunt
Just to realize what you had is what you do want
I upgraded to something gorgeous a work of art
When I had seen her, I had a feeling she had a heart
If I could have her, I know we would never grow apart

[Hook]

I tried to tell you thangs, but you just Never Listen
Wait, let me explain, somehow things seem different
The little games we play, nobody wins anyway!
[Bridge]: If ain't one thang it's another (x4)


[T.Bailey: Verse 2]

She don't like clingers he's level 5 And he in denial
Came a long ways from calling  women b**** you Lyin
You were my ride or die, I told you thangs I ain't told my momma
Had our fun in college, learned that fun bring along drama
Had a lot common I remember when we first had met
We was introduced by someone I had loved and respect
My cousin past away before she told me who I would marry
She was talking deep, I was young but still it was scary
Afraid of marriage, commitment trusting people with feelings
You hand over emotions to the person who dealing
My family loved you, it seemed good but behind doors
We need to work on our problems or we makin em yours
We down together, we ball together take my word for it
I can bring you along while I'm out here on tour and
You played yo role, you'd rob a bank if it was expected
You made me better for that I thank you, I don't regret this

[Hook]

I tried to tell you thangs, but you just Never Listen
Wait, let me explain, somehow things seem different
The little games we play, nobody wins anyway!
[Bridge]: If ain't one thang it's another (x4)

[T.Bailey: Verse 3]

I Showed you my baby pics even ones I ain't even approve of
You treated me like a king when I was low that was true love
Nowadays I'm out here disrespectful but really peaceful
Ya heart on lock and for ever will be I got the key to it
If you could give me the world, I know you would make it happen
But I'll show you the world baby it feel relaxing
My homies telling me let it go and givin me lectures
But I don't listen they situation don't look any better
If you playing me, I pray that karma will make you suffer
Aggressive loving but all that did was just made you tougher
What we had was fallin short now you longing for it
(I promise to not to grow curious) even when it gets boring
You know what make me tic; I'm trusting you not to take advantage
You feel that true love is makin mistakes.. so you was plantinChorus
Last thing, i'll ever do, is change up on you

Chorus
Verse 2
Times was harder back then, you stood played a part. Clowns wanted us apart, didn't work for dem

Went insane-shoppin' sprees, became quasi partners. til' it almost caught up with me. 5 bullets aimed to kill a nigga skipped over the bonnet of a RANGE, thank God am alive. Hell of a narrow escape, then we baited em', showed up Big-Gunnin' N killed their drama. Jay-P-Chigga-Bo yhats what you get, f***n wit me. Lost a range but am alive, sh****t, lets RIDE

Peace!!!!
Chorus X2I heard that yal niggas said Jay P fell off but i fell back on purpose

I told that bitch if she ain't sucking dick then her pussy is worthless

I'm sipping and swerving

Riding in black with a mask like im purgin

With this mac 11 I could smack 11 niggas tryna to merk me

So i cash out

Hit the clutch fourth gear then i mash out

Smoke a dutch full of sour til i pass out

Whippin with the pyrex in my trap house

Since 11 years old Ive been whippin the caine

By 16 years old i took over the game

Whatever you need i can get for the low

If you ain't buying shxt then yo ass will get banged

You take a half of gram of baking soda

Mix it with 1 gram of cocaina til it bubbles over

Whip til you can't feel your shoulders

Then you add the ice in it

Take it out that water

Scale it up and get to pricing it

Ugh

Then I shave that down

Headed out with a G pack right now

On montclair and broadway

Straight out the hallway

No i can't take any shorts right now

I stay with cookies no chocolate chips

You give me 150 I'll serve you a brick

You play with my money I'll empty the clip

Then I'll call my connect when I'm ready to flip

NWK I was raised in this shxt

I was taught never to play in this shxt

So 24/7 i gotta stay strapped

Cuz loyalty doesn't exist in this bxtch

I rather be inside the booth with me and my crew but instead im be hugging the strip

Cuz niggas die inside these streets everyday but me I'm tryna get out of this shxt

I gotta get rich!!!Hook
Shawty she a slender
Daddy am Delgado
Shawty nice figure
Yeah am Delgado
Shawty she a slender
Told you am Delgado
Africano Delgado

Verse 1
Shawty she a slender, Delgado look
She a pretty face, she like my petty cash
Really look good, told you she was eye candy
Victoria’s secret, makes her feel at home
Superfluous touch with that bootylicious pop
Laying on the couch saying, come and get some
Shawty Africano, like to go Milano
She a dark tan with that Chinese look
On the run ways is where she runs that walk
She a fashionista sharing pictures on instagram
Back to the trade, she determined not to fade
She a grade of broads that got some sort of acumen
Knows what she wants and exactly how to get it
Likes to wear pink talking about the pink panthers
High roller chic, dope seats, Rolls Royce
Takes me to Havana just to see me in Cubana
I like her elusive, makes it hard to trace me

Bridge X2
I walk that walk like you want me to
I shake that booty like you want me to
I even bubble my tits like you want me to
I put in your face so you can see what’s up

Verse 2
On the run with me, how I roll with slender
Used to sell dope, she’d collect the payments
Clyde, that’s my Bonnie, Delgado with the guy
We used to kiss each other just to keep up with the trends
Now we set the trends, save the kissing for later
Takes me shopping to kill the take her shopping routine
Pricy lingerie, she give it up in style
Shawty had a man, I had me a Delgado
Contented as my side chic but I was her side man
Used to creep the night away just to get away
Now we creep the day time to get some in day time
Used to give it up without complaint now she hesitates
I want some in the morning, that’s when she meditates
Started wanting babies, I didn’t want no babies
Then she sought a husband, I didn’t want no wify
Stopped looking sexy, wouldn’t even text me
Did a background check, shawty’s really baitYou don’t wanna get a job, you don’t wanna grind
All you wanna do is cross your legs, lay back and consume
Then you wonder why everybody turn their back on you
Social or Anti-Social, go with whatever works

Walking down Hustle Avenue, memory lane
We set out in pursuit of our dreams
When everybody laughed, we simply continued
There was this cat, met a few, we got high together
Figured I couldn’t trust em, not in this life
Let me down one too many, enough is enough
You can’t even sell dope, you consume the product
And when we made off with the loot, you double crossed us to keep it
Now you’re beeping me asking me to hook you up
I don’t trust you, really I just wish you well

Gotta make it hard to reach me, I shun contact
Can’t conform to society, I got my norms
No respect for authority but I sure came clean
You will respect me, I pay back in kind
Ya can’t bullshit me, Jay-P prototype
Don’t get caught in the hype, I represent for the streets
The company you keep says a lot about you
How you spend your time will determine your future
Am the busy type, really what you got to offer?
Fully aggravated by the weight of the world
Am built for this, brace your selves
Please accept my offering and await the omen

Where’s the loyalty? I thought we were cool?
Since the school of hard knocks, we graduated together
Set out to make a living, then all of a sudden
You started to rat and live carelessly
Thought you knew, you get nothing on a silver platter
Hard work pays, the first lesson we got
Use your time properly and progress will come
Put away a little cheddar for that rainy day
Took the lessons lightly now your worlds crumbling
I forgive you, spread the love, I don’t want you around my business

Choices we make get us where we get
Introspectively, I just keep doing what’s important to meHook

I don't mean to ruffle no feathers, but if u bother my grind, i will introduce u to misery, justify my arrogance, i will put u in your place, i don't mean to ruffle no feathers

Verse1

Mr nice guy, i play tight, no games, to be straight, i bounce up...Can I Kick? Yeah, yeah
Then am on
Go on kick it
Alright

I step up this minute put what I got on the table
Make it lucid the recipe’s sure coming of age
I ride up I tear it about
Am living am living a life for what its worth
The sweat and tears, all of the pain that brought the joy
Meet McCoy the real up about
I will sprout display the prowess
I might say every nigga chasing something, times ticking
What you chasing that’s the question, okay
Wanna toast? You gotta feel the frost nigga life is cold

Verse 2
Every body setting a goal , who gon get it
You were sports betting I seen you, I was gaming
I drew a map before I set off now that’s the difference
I’ve been seen starting from zero, nigga need a reference?
They try stand in my way sort of like a hindrance
I put my ciroc down to spit you some grown ass game
Black as can be, we gotta build our own businesses
I reached my all time crime high
Time to incorporate this

You better watch how you acting when you somewhere acting
I got jewels in my watch, why I value time
On my mind I rhyme real engage the rhythm
Re engage, shift the gear pace up to success
I strongly recommend going through the grind
To get here, I been to hell and back
To get there, gotta do more than hell and back
Tell that, words of wisdom, better value this shitChorus
Last thing, i'll ever do, is change up on you
Verse 1
They threw stones at me you was down tight with me. I fight tight right to keep the money flow steady

Credibly evident critically acclaimed
Feel my, point of view, ghetto view, see whats what
Chorus
Verse 3
GT chronicles, I tell you a story
The streets of cavers crescent, niggas followed him
They all came to see to believe indeed
If you believe in Jay-P, you too can be
Bounce up out about throw the dice about
Make money, live your live, gotta watch your bread
The more money you make, more problems accrue
Niggas get more jealous than his ex-girlfriend
Come I’ll show you how I had to do my own
So you can do, what you can do for you
My nigga laced tight game N I laced tight
That’s how its supposed to be, be it tighter

Verse 1
She gotta be, a woman of independence
Me N her interdepend
She go to work do her grind
Keepin the fella ,I in mind
I show up Ralph lauren
She know she doing Louis vuitton
Then I head to the streets availing cladrecipe clothing
She come home early, not complaining how she tired
Rather freshen, keep exotic,then get erotic on me
The type that id take to meet the parents
Walk down the aisle, not in church
Rather a private place
She gotta have her own paper
Even though I spend on her
Yes, she spend on me
I treat her like an equal
50 50 despite the age difference
The epitome of a lady
My type, no hype , she it right
Chorus
6 for the booty, 9 for the titties
Erotic, the one to bring back my libido
Honestys a must, she respects me
N expects in kind, in this world
Where so many untrue
She down to ride with me
Bonnie N Clyde travail
We will not fail
To live up to the terms N conditions we agree on
And the necessary compromise we lace, that’s tight
In the night we go to party then back to the crib
So she can work me tight
Ready to do me even in the morning
Six o’clock, she wake me up for a bout
That early morning love
From a good family, qualities she holds
I describe her as perfect
Chorus
Verse 3
Stylish N interesting she will sing me a song
Working it for me just like I grind for her
Understanding but smart enough not to let me stray
What she needs she knows, all I need is her
Might hurt a little when am not with her
Understandable she gotta work like me
Something to be grateful for
Guard me jealously but enough to keep our flame on
A fire that burn with in eternally
Growing with me, from youth to youth
With a consistent wisdom increment, I love that
Age ain't nothing but a number
N she remember to do her part
Like I gotta do mine
We, a gold mine to each other
We need each other
My type a lady, as in a lady 69
Chorus[Hook]

I tried to tell you thangs, but you just Never Listen
Wait, let me explain, somehow things seem different
The little games we play, nobody wins anyway!
[Bridge]: If ain't one thang it's another (x4)


[T.Bailey: Verse 1]

A text or call from you make my day uplifted
The fact I know you spyin on me bring a splendid feelin
When I laid eyes, I knew what I wanted  then that moment
You had a spark to you I just wanted to keep it goin
When I look at you, I just feel a sense of security
My ex ain't worked out, bestowed a fear that she was unsure of me
About adjustin, trustin whatever  sounding good
Coming from a mouth who claim they love you but never could
I'm just feeling distant, it feel like we competition
Struggling for power we use to protect our feelings
From past experience, confided in you guess you felt different
If I don't give you attention, you go out on a hunt
Just to realize what you had is what you do want
I upgraded to something gorgeous a work of art
When I had seen her, I had a feeling she had a heart
If I could have her, I know we would never grow apart

[Hook]

I tried to tell you thangs, but you just Never Listen

[T.Bailey: Verse 2]

She don't like clingers he's level 5 And he in denial
Came a long ways from calling  women b**** you Lyin
You were my ride or die, I told you thangs I ain't told my momma
Had our fun in college, learned that fun bring along drama
Had a lot common I remember when we first had met
We was introduced by someone I had loved and respect
My cousin past away before she told me who I would marry
She was talking deep, I was young but still it was scary
Afraid of marriage, commitment trusting people with feelings
You hand over emotions to the person who dealing
My family loved you, it seemed good but behind doors
We need to work on our problems or we makin em yours
We down together, we ball together take my word for it
I can bring you along while I'm out here on tour and
You played yo role, you'd rob a bank if it was expected
You made me better for that I thank you, I don't regret this

[T.Bailey: Verse 3]

I Showed you my baby pics even ones I ain't even approve of
You treated me like a king when I was low that was true love
Nowadays I'm out here disrespectful but really peaceful
Ya heart on lock and for ever will be I got the key to it
If you could give me the world, I know you would make it happen
But I'll show you the world baby it feel relaxing
My homies telling me let it go and givin me lectures
But I don't listen they situation don't look any better
If you playing me, I pray that karma will make you suffer
Aggressive loving but all that did was just made you tougher
What we had was fallin short now you longing for it

You know what make me tic; I'm trusting you not to take advantage
You feel that true love is makin mistakes.. so you was plantinChorus X2
