[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hello mothafucka, hey hi how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even tripping

[Hook]
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard

[Verse 2: Drake]
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though: I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and bucking when the hook drop

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Hold up, wait one motherfucking minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfucking meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'mma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room, Yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, "I seen it all", I said, "no you fucking didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'mma be a legend even when my life end
And I'mma be a legend even when this night ends
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothing like them
I'm goin' in!

[Intro]
Astaghfirullah
This one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To everybody out thereâ€¦
Ya digggggg

[Verse 1]
Now I ain't trying to be the greatest
I used to hate hip-hop, yup, because the women degraded
But Too $hort made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite, I stated, though I only recited half
Omitting the word "bitch", cursing - I wouldn't say it
Me and dog couldn't relate, till a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learned it from a song I heard and sort of liked
Yeah, further ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac, Nas's "It Was Written"
Intermixed with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world and listen, it drop

[Hook]
My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
And I got no place to go
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it hurts me soul

[Verse 2]
I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinking "golly, God, guard me from the ungodly"
But by my 30th watching of "Streets is Watching"
I was back to giving props again and that was bothering
'Bout as uncomfortable as an untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustle to
Seem wrong, but these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into
And thought what constitutes a prostituteis the pursuit of profit
Then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things
With the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said "don't knock it, mind your business
His business isn't mine and that nigga pimping got it"

[Hook]
They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, they cross on fire
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced
So I got no place to go
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang time
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me
Turn off my TV cause it hurts me soul


[Verse 3]
So through the Grim Reaper sickle sharpening
Macintosh marketing
Oil field augering
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation
Islamic martyrdom, precise
Yeah, laser guided targeting
Oil for food bartering, terrorist organization harboring
Sand camouflage army men
CCF sponsoring, world conquering, telephone monitoring
Louis Vuitton modeling, pornographic actress honoring
String theory pondering, bulimic vomiting
Catholic priest fondling, preemptive bombing
And Osama and Obama 'n them
They breaking in my car again, deforestation and overlogging and
Hennessy and Hypnotiq swallowing, hydroponic coughing and
All the world's ills, sitting on chrome 24-inch wheels, like that

[Hook]
They say I'm infected, this is why I inject it
I had it aborted, we got deported
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here
But I got no place to go
I can't stop eating, my best friend's leaving
My pastor touched me, I love this country
I lost my earpiece, I hope y'all hear me
Cause it hurts me soul[Produced by Needlz]

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy bank
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy bank

[Bridge]
Man I'll get at you - my knife cuts your skin
I'll get at you - blow shots at your man
I'll get at you - 2Pac don't pretend
I'll get at you - I'll put that to an end

[Verse One]
That damn shit is old, don't be screamin "Get at Me Dog"
Have you runnin for your life when I match ya part
I get to waving that semi like it's legal
A lil' nigga hurt his arm, lettin off that Eagle, you know me
Black on black Bentley, big ol' black 9
I'll clap your monkey-ass, yeah black on black crime
Big ol' chrome rims gleam, you know how I shine
C'mon on man, you know how I shine
I'm in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top
Got a 100 guns, a 100 clips, why I don't hear no shots?
That fat nigga thought "Lean Back" was "In Da Club"
My shit sold 11 mill', his shit was a dud
Jada' don't fuck with me, if you wanna eat
Cause I'll do yo' little ass like Jay did Mobb Deep
Yeah homey in New York niggas like your vocals
But that's only New York dawg, yo' ass is local

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money

[Verse Two]
Banks' shit, sells; Buck's shit, sells
Game's shit, sells; I'm rich as - hell
Shyne poppin off his mouth from a cell
He don't want it with me, he in PC
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I'm in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
It's an emergency, for Michael Jackson see
Looked at a picture and says she looks like me
Kelis said her milkshake bring all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went, and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggas know you, cuz
First thing they say about you is you's a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I'll give you what I got

[Hook + Interlude]

[Bridge]
When I get at you - I'll punch out your grill
I'll get at you - let off that blue steel
I'll get at you - nigga I'm for real
I'll get at you - could get yo' ass killed[Intro: Andy Samberg]
YOLO, you only live once
The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy
It's not worth the risk

[Hook 1: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
Don't trust anyone
Cause you only live once

Verse 1: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy
Ugh, you only live once
That's the motto
So take a chill pill,
Ease off the throttle

Never go to loud clubs
Cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry
When they can't hear

And stay the hell away from drugs
Cause they're not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard
Like a beagle

Cause you should never trust a bank
They've been known to fail
And never travel by car, a bus
Boat or by rail

And don't travel by plane
And don't travel at all
Build a bomb shelter basement
With titanium walls

And wear titanium suits
In case pianos fall on you
And never go to saunas
Cause they're crawlin' with piranhas

And never take the stairs
Cause they're often unsafe
You only live once
Don't let it go to waste

[Hook 2: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat till it's done
Cause you only live once

[Verse 2: Jorm, Kiv, & Andy]
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice:
Stay away from kids
Cause their hair is filled with mad lice

There's no such thing
As too much Purell
This a cautionary tale
Word to George Orwell

So don't 1980 force
Any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt
And triple lock it

Then hire a taster
Make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy
Then destroy him

No blankets or pajamas
They can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture:
Killing machines

Board your windows up
The sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straight jacket
So you're safe from yourself

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?)
4.2%, Thirty year mortgage
That's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now, a dependable savings
And you'll retire with money in your account
Beast

[Bridge: All]
YOLO, say no no
Isolate yourself
And just roll solo
Be care-folo
You oughta look out
Also stands for YOLO
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky
You oughta look out[Hook: 50 Cent]
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
Ha-ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CD's drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin through life chasin my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin is there really heaven or hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions, cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
It's a gift given from God, so I'mma use it - yeah

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself
Bunch of niggas around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin 'bout nothin more, than life - what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind
I'm a sponge, knowledge and wisdom I ab-sorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math

[Hook]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
It ain't my fault, yeah
Shoutout to Reverand Floyd Flake
It ain't my fault, Creflo Dollar, TD Jakes
Bishop Eddie L. Long. Easy-L shorty. Ha ha
Wooo! Feels good
Oh yeah, can't forget Bishop Morton
Cause my mama'll kill me, ha ha[Hook - Jadakiss]
Uhh, used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed RYDE OR DIE, I thought you would die wit me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit me
Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed RYDE OR DIE, I thought you would die wit me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit me

[Verse 1 - DMX]
When it rain, niggas get wet, so stay dry (uh)
Don't cross me, I can peep a snake eye (woo)
You just lost me, like yo' shadow in the dark (uh-huh)
Fucked around and forced me to hit the shadow with the spark (UHH)
Blew your shit apart -- now it's two halves of one nigga
"Look at him," I said after a few laughs, "Dumb nigga!
Stupid is as stupid does -- cocksucker (WHAT?)
And look what being stupid does, get you shot sucker (WHAT?)
I let you get too close and you bit me (uh)
I told you nah for too long, you tried to hit me
Thought you was wit me (uhh)
Well you might as well forget me, cause from this point on (uh-huh)
It's war, it won't stop until one of us is gone" (c'mon!)
I'm still mad at myself for lettin that shit go down (UHH)
Somebody shoulda told me, I was fuckin wit a clown (aight?)
And I think they found and let.. you.. nigga.. drown
.. you know how shit get around

[Hook - Jadakiss]

[Verse 2 - Styles P]
Aiyyo X fuck them niggas, them niggas ain't your dogs
Better treat like some cats and shake they ass to the floor
Been seen the foul shit, put the guns in em
Lil' wannabe you's, so why you run wit em?
You can't trust niggas no further than you can throw em
You don't wanna murder the niggas, then you blow em
He usin yo' style, that make him yo' child
Then he shouldn't make a move til he hear it from yo' mouth
We don't allow snakes - runnin wit dogs
Tell them ain't nuttin like a funeral that's gonna be yours
Double-R, and I ain't here to start trouble God
But if they wasn't your niggas I woulda BEEN hit em hard
Niggas look like they phony (what) sound like they phony (huh?)
Run around actin like motherfucker's homies
We all make mistakes, that's part of the breaks
But you can still call the apes, we bringin the duct tape
And the broomstick -- them bitch-ass niggas is gettin raped
Know how we ride, whoever on they side can die
And we ain't tryin to be blind, fuck eye for eye
Cause we only takin yours, you know the doggs you motherfucker

[Hook - Jadakiss]

[Verse 3 - DMX]
There was always somethin there, but I just couldn't touch it (uh-huh)
Wasn't somethin that would hurt me, so a nigga said, "Fuck it!" (uhh)
I let it slide, laughed and joked let it ride (true)
Now that you done killed it, I'm glad that it died (AIGHT?)
It's aight, I know where you live, I'm just waitin (uhh)
Til we knock on your front door, and let you meet Satan (c'mon!)
That's what you get for hatin -- FUCK YOU FAGGOT! (WHAT?)
I never did trust you faggot -- I'll bust you faggot! (WHAT?)
What you done forgot about the streets is this: (uhh)
You do a drimy nigga like you do a grimy bitch (AIGHT?)
You just STOP fuckin wit him, you got no more rap (uh)
No more, "Yo whassup D?" No more dap (uhh)
Be lucky if I don't spit in your face, off of G.P. (WHAT?)
AND WHAT? Bitch-ass nigga, you can't beat me (woo)
Don't take it as a loss, just take it as a lesson
Next time think twice, or get iced wit the Wessun
NIGGA! (Nigga!)

[Hook - Jadakiss]

[Jadakiss]
C'mon

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah (UHH)[Intro : Nate Dogg & (Game)]
Aww man! Ay Game, don't tell me you love her
(I mean I like the bitch, but I don't love her)
Next thing you know you gon' be all boo boo {?} and shit
(Fuck that!)

[Hook 2x : Nate Dogg]
Girl I'll do anything to make you feel special
Man it's easy to see you're special to me
Whether we lovers or friends, we'll always be
I want you to know, you're special

[Verse 1 : The Game]
L-A-X to J-F-K, that's where it all happened
Caught you walkin out that Gucci store in Manhattan
I was in chains and cuffs, you was wit'cha girls
I was in that Aftermath chain, you was in pearls
It was me against the world baby girl; you had dreams of stardom
The Prince of Compton meets the Queen of Harlem
First date at Mr. Chao's it was kosher, I wore culture
The fur, the Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada, Dolce
You're runnin circles in my living room, tearin up sofas
McLaren or Rover, fuck it ma let's tear up the highway
Let the Sprewells spin 'til the plates fall off
Then we can go one-on-one in Dre's house
Jeans painted with the waist cut out, you rock 'em the fly way
That lil' bit of Compton mixed with Bed-Stuy way
And girl, I'm not tryin to excite you, I'm tryin to wife you
Bamboo earring, white Air Nike you, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : The Game]
I like your style, like the way you move, the way you talk
The way you smile, the way you swingin them hips when you walk
The way you look, the way you ride when you workin them thighs
The way you lickin your lips when you look in my eyes
You down for me? I'm down for you
You go down on me, I'll go down on you
I wanna do all the things that your man won't do
I'm from the hood, so I know how to handle you
Keep you in pink rocks and G-Unit canvas shoes
Show you how to gangsta lean when the Lambo move
I'll take you to New York City, Atlanta too
Show you how to fly them birds and them hammers through
And you know

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : The Game]
Let me tell you 'bout the birds and bees
How I stand on the block all day and flip birds and ki's
Your boyfriend don't like me, cause he don't get a fourth of my cheese
And you can take back the Porsche and his keys
Hop in the Range Rover, you ain't gotta force him to leave
I got a chrome four-four in my jeans
You got Gucci frames coverin the mark on your face
Cause he don't want you to leave, and I don't want you to stay
Sometimes I wanna snatch that nigga out his CLK
I know he treatin you the way K-Ci did Mary J
I wanna, ease your pain, kick off your Louis sandals
Let me, wipe your tears with my G-Unit bandana
You make me wanna peel you out them jeans when you rockin them
It's "Me & My Girlfriend" like 2Pac and them
Jay-Z and Beyonce, or Bobby and Whitney
We the 0-5 Bonnie and Clyde, feel me?

[Hook]{"Bang bang, I shot you down bang bang"}
{"You hit the ground, bang bang"}
{"That awful sound - bang bang"}
{"I used to shoot you down"}

[Young Buck]
Don't nobody wanna die, but everybody wanna ball
Somebody gotta go when them killers call (dang)
You know it's in us all, you just gotta find it and use it
You can get away with it, if you don't abuse it - the streets talk
Now be smart cause that heat coming
And if they know that you did it you betta keep running (run nigga!)
I think I see something, there go my enemy
Only Lord knows what this nigga fin' to be
Ten a ki' still the price, this is real - if you're looking
Might give it to you for five, depend on if I took it
Nigga anything go, my shop never close
From the nickels and the dime to the whole KILO
The real niggas feel me, the haters wanna kill me
But I'm holding down my city, me and this nine milli'
Why you throwing bricks and hiding your head, homey I know where you hang
Ain't no thing for me to walk up, and let that chopper go

[Hook]
{"Bang bang, I shot you down"}
{"Bang bang, you hit the ground"} Now all the gangstas pray
Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"I shot you down"}
Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"That awful sound"}

[Young Buck]
Just think if I ain't empty the clip and he killed me
Would I still be living, would my homeboys miss me?
How many niggas bust they gun when they have to
Don't need no ski-mask when it's time to get at you
I'm glad you didn't see what it looked like when we left
Brain fragments for shotgun blasting, 'll take a nigga breath
It's death before dishonesty, dope deals and robbery
Poppa wasn't around but that shit didn't bother me
I'll probably be in the penitentiary
But I'll play the cards that the dear Lord sent to me, the whole truth
I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas
Why you mad at me? The government's the drug dealers (fo' sho')
Before I let these police keep harassing me
This rookie-ass cop gon' have to blast me
He asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed
He made a move and I heard a blast, that's what you get bitch (boom!)

[Hook]

[Young Buck]
It's going down around here nigga
Get your motherfucking head bust
The motherfucking street lights go out
And them real niggas come out
All the bitch niggas go in the house
Shit is not a game man
Don't fuck around and lose your brain
And ay, all my real niggas pray

[Outro]
Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"I shot you down"}
Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"You hit the ground"}

Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"I shot you down"}
Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"That awful sound"}[Verse 1:]

Diary of my life on the track
But what I started writing started writing back
And talkin bout my pops and moms
And them blocks and them bombs
Sometimes I wonder who sane, Barack or Saddam
Cause them shots and yo them blocks they still the same homie
But in people's pockets all thatâ€™s constant is change homie
Homie, I used to hang wit the Wu-Tangers
'Til my mans got hit wit 36 chambers
Swear Im numb to it, so hardcore
Tryin' to undo it in my mind
But I'm off course in my Sudan thinkin' 'bout Darfur
Tryin' to let go of the pain and the bruises in my brain
It's so useless I just throw it to the flames
And then use that fuel for my fuses
Let it Burn

[Verse 2:]

I just departed from my home town
It's half dead closed own
Flags everywhere we been invaded by a ghost town
People in them projects they be fightin' in the field
I seen my homie switch sides
Turn to Vikings for the bills and
Steelers for the bucks
In the streets we was rebels we had beef wit police
Dukeâ€™d it out the blue devils uh
My retrospecsâ€™ on I'm drained
I'm swerving through memory lane
Foot to the pedal tryin' to sustain
Swear I'm numb to it, so hardcore tryin' to undo it in my mind
But Im off course in my Sudan thinkin' 'bout Darfur
Trying to let go of the pain and the bruises in my brain
Its so useless I just throw it to the flames
And then use that fuel for my fuses
Let it Burn

[Verse 3:]

Let me be clear it's a been spell
If you been here it's been hell
If you can't tell is hard to exhale when u inhale
See these students, no grammar
Hella high school on campus
Why it feel like every child life behindâ€™s the fucking standard
Ghetto Americana
Churchâ€™s prayin why ainâ€™t no changes grandma
Its because its unanswered questions unquestioned answers
Hella C.O.â€™s no C.E.Oâ€™s
Hella subway sandwich artistses
No heroes a lot people goin crazy
Donâ€™t see dough, lotta ego
So the attitude that we know
Is I;ll put you in a box if Im P.O.â€™d
Thatâ€™s pissed off, thatâ€™s postal
A lot of people be posted
Both sides of the block, no free throw
Amigo, I'm out chea next to Reverend Rollo Goodlove playâ€™n Cee-Lo
Hella coppers, no halos
Hella Doctors, no payrolls
See hell has held us hostage and we still think hell is hot shit
See I'm fired up for the mamas
Hella fired up for they daughters
See times up time to rise up and turn they wines into water
So put ya problems to a lighter (Let it burn)
We are now fightin' fire wit fire (Let it Burn)
Light up all ya fears and ya doubts until they are undone
Melt ya problems and send â€™em to the other side of the sun
Let It Burn[Intro: Swizz Beatz]

Bitches know, niggas love the way my flow SWITCH

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]

[HOOK]
Crack!! It got my niggas addicted
Crack!! But got my niggas convicted
Crack!! Why niggas stand on the block
Its called Crack!! It got my man and 'em shot
I said Crack!! what niggas sell for the cash
Crack!! Got the women selling they ass
Crack!! What the feins use to get high
And the hustlers move to get by that's why the song called CRACK!!

[VERSE 1]
I got the cops drawn... I put the block on
Over rare bout to stock viles of the popcorn
Feins got the block warm getting they cop on
My young'ns run the block till ev'ry one of the rocks gone
And I got another block I'm puttin the pot on
Strong enough to smell through the jar wit the top on
Cop and be gone... If you come to the block drawn
I'll hit you with the Glock till ev'ry one of the shots gone
He thought he was a thug he was all on his pop join'
Till he got popped now he all on his rock join'
I left him all on the block wit his top gone
Law called his mom and pop they all on they shock join'
I was just tryna make some bread for my family
And ev'rybody got somebody dead in they family
And ev'rybody got some crackheads in they family
So it's no room to hate cause I kno you relate... My shit

[HOOK]

I'mma blow like propaine cause the flow flames
It'll have you look like the cooked version of cocaine
I spit crack homie... neva been wak homie
I'm back homie... And I hold weight like I'm fat Tony
Like a Soprano I stay with the ammo
Push keys and make music but dont play the piano
You could get blam! yo... I'm nice wit my hands doe
You'll be looking like Rocky if you play like you Rambo
I'm looking type Rocky when I hop out the Land Vo
Bezel on the band whoa... rock on the hand glow
It's all for the fans doe
Thanks for the sup-port
My 16s like the nicotine in a newport
I'm like Too $hort... Pimpin these hoes
I'm the best at inventin the flow since Hove
What these other niggas spittin is trash
But it's like hittin a glass when you listen to Cass... My shit

[HOOK]

I still be fucking it all up
Gettin it, mixin it cuttin, it all up
I make hella cake and I'm addin it all up
And I ain't sellin weight, man I'm baggin it all up
My youngn's on the block they be knockin it all off
Who you think the feins be coppin it all off
My block got hard but we coppin it all soft
If its snakes in the grass we choppin it all off
If you play wit my cash I'm poppin at all ya
Wit my face in a mask I'm choppin at all ya
But due to the fact I be rappin and all that
I be actin and all that I ain't clappin at y'all cats
But before I did music and movies and all that
I was moving in all black wit the toolies and all that
But now I dont got time cause I'm eatin and all that
I'm too decent for all that to be beefin wit y'all cats... You on

[HOOK]

CRACK!!!!, CRACK!!!!, CRACK!!!!
ITS CALLED CRACK!!!!!!!!
I SAID CRACK!!!!
CRACK!!!!, CRACK!!!!, CRACK!!!!, CRACK!!!!!![Produced by: Needlz]

[Intro]
What if the boulevard could speak, the alleyways could talk
If the blocks were horns and the sidewalks were harps
But before we start, let me give you a warning
The keys and violins are just part of the performance

[Verse 1: Honors English]
In this performance, they turn the sirens up every other morning
Caution, them yellow strings don't go across them
Make sure you a bro then he faded into a corner
Get his cross faded into his aura
I was brought up in this genre
Still can't equalize the highs and the horrors
I'll mix it down tomorrow
When they not getting smelled by the canines
And every week y'all police dogs leapfrog see
By the bassheads played by the bassline
To think we was engineered to lose
The criminalâ€™s volume is louder than the schools
The minister is shoutin' on mute
While the three-time felon's caught in the wrong loop, wrong loop, wrong
I'm just trying to remix it, to give you a score
They can help the babies grow like umbilical cords
It's just cymbals on the sidewalk

[Verse 2: Honors English]
Did you hear that? Damn, that's how them hammers go pop
So, when it's quiet it's like an amplified watts
And the minors absorb the distortion
It goes in they ears and it pours out they organs
Let me use an example
They chop and they screw that shit
To produce them a sample
Then they stretch it to see who got the best pictures
If they sopranos, as if it's a channel
Why is it hard to get a job but easy to get a hit
Contrary to popular belief not everybody flips
Coke, but everybody gets fly, just to get by
You gotta switch up the kicks
My grandma work day and night shifts
Hurt her back so I'm tryna pay her back
Dislocating these discs
And hurting these tracks is virtuoso English
Yeah, I'm compose, let me know if you wanna riff
Yeah it's just cymbals on the sidewalk

[Verse 3: Honors English]
Sometimes, I talk to my homie Boof
And I'm always talking with Mike and he tell me get the loot
But, but we gotta be double sharp
In order to change these cymbals on our sidewalks
They throwin' us in jail from guns and drug sales
I think it's time for us to play on another scale
Cause we like publishing the trap
I let the streets shit alone, no strings attached
Chrome, I'm buildin' up a staff and my business crumbles
I reverse the crash
But scratch that, I'm tryna see stacks
And backtrack so my pockets never be flat
Yeah, so fuck a crew
A one mind ensemble is upon you
Remember we were kings before emcees
So let's all get back to our royalties
This is cymbals on the sidewalk[Talib Kweli]
Yea
That's what I'm talking about
S-A-S, size ain't shit, never that
Strong Arm Steady, Talib Kweli
Yea

[Hook x2: Talib Kweli]
Niggas gettin caught in the trap
For the cash, it's the drugs; basketball; or the rap
There's more to us than that
We the shit consider the facts, after you analyze that
You know you best to fall back

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
I'm dealing with, nothing but facts, when I spit it, though
You niggas superstitious don't step on the cracks or split the pole
Candle light, flickers so bright, my silhouette can kick a sicker flow
And spill it like a liquor store, I spit the shit to make a cripple get up and dance
I spit the shit to make the average MC piss in his pants
I spit the shit to make a motherfucker call it a night
I spit the shit to see fuck wit C. Delores Tucker sex like
I take a sip from my creative well, in this game for a minute
I play this well to win it, you go to Africa, like Dave Chappelle, you finished
Cause your prehistoric raps is boring, the number of whack rappers soaring
Like the percentages of teenagers who have abortions
These niggas meek, their lyrics weak, and their beats is corporate
They try snitching on records their mouths is leaking faucets
Dripping them over system than, Chinese water torture
Ripping a series of events, more unfortunate than Lemony Snicket

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
Medallions mind, bless the mic for the gods, teach the blind
Plus get a piece of mine release your minds for each design
Baby food for thought, rappers not coonin' for sport
Due to these pork eatin niggas of sort
Yo you's a fuckface, burnt out loser that's always up late
Planet Asia the revolutionary slash nut case
A witchcraft black magic, data load up computers
A spread the message wrote to you where when I show illusions
If all y'all niggas is killas then how you write your records
How'd you find the time stop lying, your minds' infected
There's only a few, and I ain't saying niggas don't put it down from you town
I'm talkin bout you
Yea the fake dude promotin propaganda
And open on some fanna, and out right, snitching on them cameras
Planet Asia, gold chain black bandanas low
Steady Gain Klick Klack rang rang, there they go

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Phil Da Agony]
Just a high skip and a jump
Away from getting everything that I could possibly want
And prostitutes front
Get a 4 bar on the roster, scratch that
I'm talkin about a full roster of raps
Monsters that rap, buzzed out ?? check the cadence of the frequency
Uniquely, we strong arms strategically
Easily I twist the ?? killa cali ??
Back alleys burnin backwoods in danelis or
He probably with Kweli, out in BK
We make it easy for the DJ's, like instant replays
Conversation by the buttons, I talk and touch something
Straight shots of the Louis he flew me out to London
Crunchin numbers flippin more dough, like siccisero
Next thing you know we kissin ya ho, without the mistletoe
Strong arm steady, agony can ???, fill the rigglies
The Big League niggas is dropping indies
Let's go

[Hook x2]

[Talib Kweli]
Talib kweli, right about now
This what I'm feelin right about now
And I invite you all to check it out wit me
Lets go!

S'like

[Hook x2][Hook]

Iâ€™m going in for the kill, Iâ€™m doing it for a thrill

Oh, Iâ€™m hoping youâ€™ll understand and not let go of my hand

Iâ€™m going in for the kill, Iâ€™m doing it for a thrill

Oh, Iâ€™m hoping youâ€™ll understand and not let go of my hand


[Verse 1: Donnis]

Fuck it, Iâ€™m going in, I play the game, I wanna win

Iâ€™m in the water, see my shark fin? Either you love me or you a guppy

Fuck me over, show no remorse, you dead to me, I see your corpse

Pour out the porks, preserve the wines, we pop the champagne

Once we cross the state lines, Iâ€™ll be damned if they take mine

â€˜Cause they inferior, I am superior like a great lake or a fat seat

And honestly, I gotta say Iâ€™m who they wanna be

Thatâ€™s just the T-I-P of the iceberg, donâ€™t like me?

I donâ€™t give a four letter word, fuck, damn, shit

This Donnis, something you donâ€™t wanna miss bitch


[La Roux]

We can fight our desires but when we start making fires

We get ever so hot whether we like it or we donâ€™t


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Donnis]

Every verse I pin frees me from another demon, cursed with this curse

So my children are cursed, even the semen, yeah, this is just what I believe in

My ex girl still at home underachieving, mama found out Iâ€™m chiefing

And thatâ€™s just where it begin â€˜cause I been popping these pills

They instantly make me feel like Iâ€™ll never know, never gonâ€™ have to worry again

So that worries my friends, wait, I ainâ€™t got friends â€˜cause they was lame

And said the fame just wasnâ€™t for them but I wonâ€™t hit a dead end

Nope, I keep on cruising and I kept on schmoozing while the game kept snoozing

This shit got confusing, see, they thought Iâ€™d be losing

Now I sit in amusement and watch them eat that betrayal

Motherfuckers be happy if my train slip and derail, I went in for the kill

Did it for all for the thrill, said theyâ€™d understand but they let go of my hand


[Hook][Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, niggas talking all that gangsta shit
Acting like my money ain't no good in the hood; you know what I mean?
Fucking head blown off, nigga; you know?

[Hook x2]
They, they talking that
That gangsta shit
They ain't about that
Man, matter of fact
Hand me my strap
Show me where they at
I'll stop 'em from talking like that

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm the topic in every barbershop and beauty salon
Cause these other niggas that rap ain't on the shit that I'm on
Cause 50 this; 50 that; 50 stay with a gat
Thirty-two shots in the clip, hollow tips in the MAC
But when I come through, shh - the talking stop
My money long now, I can make the Pope get shot
Now, we can blow an hour talking bout the stones I rock
Or the hoes I got - catchin' stunts in the drop
Now, Nas, you love the kid, 50 on that killa shit
That big mobster bad man; BGF guerrilla shit
I'm marking my music like diesel on the block
So if you with me you gon' eat, and you gon' starve if you not
Weed smokers love me like they love Buddha
I'll turn your kids to a shooter
Crip niggas love me like they love Hoover
They tell me see careful good, cause niggas wanna see like you
They ain't used to a G like you, BOW!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
You think you a killer but we gon' just pay 'em a visit
Put the potato on the barrel so nobody hear it
I keep a holster on my shoulder like I'm John Wayne
Shooting these niggas lights out like LeBron James
Holla my name; give me a reason to see you bleeding
After you feel these hollow tips, nigga, then we even
Full of anger until there's no more bullets in the chamber
Ain't nothing like when you get popped and don't know who to blame-a
Nigga told me, "Do your dirt all by your lonely"
So I go hit them niggas 'fore 50 could even hold me
I'm waiting, anticipating to put a nigga under
Smoking like we some Jamaicans, fucking with this ganja
Ride with no hesitation, retaliation is a must
Bad as I want to, some shit I just don't discuss
So point him out and watch I knock him off
Everywhere you bitches go, I got a nigga watching ya'll, motherfucka!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Come on, nigga, I ain't here to make no friends; just cut the checks
I got a long pump that'll put your stupid ass out the steps
Begging niggas don't understand, no
Probably cause my hand glow when I'm anticipating' the lambo
Lean out my bucket for niggas thinking they Rambo
You get one warning, so I suggest you let your man know
These rap niggas portray to be tough, nobody acting soft
Til they laid out in the hospital, eatin' apple sauce
Usually for yapping off and turn apologetic
Waving a white flag, for danger they might have
My niggas buying so much ammo
If you reach in the couch for loose change
You'll probably feel on the handle
Holding sixteens to get your bandages and broke bones
So I suggest you get alarm systems in both homes
There's only one team on top; we number one with a Glock
Fuck around and get your dumb ass shot

[Hook][Lloyd Banks] + (Havoc)
Front on me and get (clapped) front on him and get (clapped)
Front on us and get (clapped) you get clapped nigga

[Prodigy] + (Havoc)
Front on me and get (clapped) front on him and get (clapped)
Front on us and get (clapped) get clapped, get clapped

[Hook: Llloyd Banks]
My niggas feel different, cause everything is good
They actin like I changed, like I went Hollywood
Like I don't keep it street, like I ain't got the heat
Like I ain't homicide, all over the beat
Like I ain't full of beef, like I don't really care
Cause I ain't camera shy, we can do it anywhere
It's diamonds in my chain, it's diamonds in my ear
A nigga come up slippin, I'll make him disappear

[Lloyd Banks]
Uhh, hey nigga
Fuck all the slick talk, get bread instead
Stay low, strap up, metal on, inf' red
Too smooth, won't slip, new jewels, don't trip
Been around the world twice, jet Leer, boat whip
Oh shit, I'm hella rowdy and I'm nuttin nice
Money ain't shit but a number, name your fuckin price
Dick rider, coat tailor, ass kisser
Sucker for love, type to pick up the glass slipper
Look around ask nigga, before you add liquor
Cause bein a ad-libber to be in a bag wit'cha
I'm seein the bad picture of bein a cab skipper
Broke as fuck, waitin for Satan to come and get'cha
Keep your clique tight, know your goals, don't speed, slow ya roll
Don't speak, learn the codes - 'fore they pop ya ass
Barbecue your body with beans out of the shottie
While I'm in the Maserati with somethin that's gon' slob me

[Hook]

[Prodigy]
Yea... my trigger finger is feenin, the nigga up here is a demon
Nigga my fangs start showin if I'm seein you dreamin
Get too close and I'm bustin, it won't be no discussion
I'm a boss I don't speak - I just nod my head
And you turned up missin with your own page in the feds
I got power, and I will flex on you real quick
Call yo' dogs, call yo' clique, hug yo' moms 'fore you split
Cause you ain't never gon' see that bitch again
And this ain't a war nigga we just havin fun wit'cha
Like a bib wit a baby, if I smack you I might kill ya
Half a million in diamonds, half a bid from rhymin
And I'm steady and climbin - that mean I'm still blowin up
Got you burn while you lookin, see my Ferrari in Brooklyn
On the corner, I'm murderin through, so come through
I light yo' buildin on fire, it's why these rappers retire
Cause they tired, of dealin with the niggas like me

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, now enough 'bout all the lame shit, them wrestlin games kid
I need the rocks to fill the rest of the chain with
I need the block to fill up best that I came with
I need the cops to get the fuck off my dick
Different day, same shit, media and paparazzi love
Envy and betrayal, my heart's cold as hockey gloves
I light it up and take off that beef and broccoli high
Chocolate thai, green skunk; South Jamaica, Queens punk
Stand up ya boy's back, put your grams up, get money
You ain't heard nuttin but a hit from me
Quit dummy, cause it's the changin of the guards
Beat bitches over their head, the caveman of the squad
And he barely fall victim cause they raised him up so hard
So my nine is on my hip, and my praises up to God
Cause we in a battlefield, where the razors lead to scars
And the lasers need to hold slugs in and out your clothes

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeahhhhhh, yeahhhhhh
Yeahhhhhh, yeah!
Aiyyo P, fuck these niggas man
I'll buck these niggas man
Ain't nobody else gettin no money, this is our year
Next year, is our year
The year after is our year
The year after is our year
YEAH! G-G-G-G-G G-Unit![Hook: 50 Cent]
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
Ha-ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CD's drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin through life chasin my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin is there really heaven or hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions, cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
It's a gift given from God, so I'mma use it - yeah

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself
Bunch of niggas around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin 'bout nothin more, than life - what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind
I'm a sponge, knowledge and wisdom I ab-sorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math

[Hook]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
It ain't my fault, yeah
Shoutout to Reverand Floyd Flake
It ain't my fault, Creflo Dollar, TD Jakes
Bishop Eddie L. Long. Easy-L shorty. Ha ha
Wooo! Feels good
Oh yeah, can't forget Bishop Morton
Cause my mama'll kill me, ha haThey say we on
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
(Get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
Say tonight we gone get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)

In the middle of the club blowin endo
Rolling up a swishers sweet, fat as Mr Winslow
Cause right now only family matters
And all these other niggers pissed cause they got little bladders
I came to shatter haters dreams kill they self esteem
Don't try to make it now my niggas this ain't maybelline
You have made it seem no body like me
And now I ain't gay so I don't care if niggas like me
Bitches know I'm cooler and I rock like Mikey
I, I, I rock things way out of your price range
We don't look at price tags never will never have
Just ask for they forgiveness later on
When you see my chick you see a chick that you will never have
And that's a concept you will never grasp
I'm the shit fertilizer in that greener grass
I'm bout to eat rama down watch these niggas fast
Now puff puff pass now and pour another glass

We on
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get your glass up baby get your ass up)

My momma asked me is the bragging really necessary
I say no but this shitt is gonna make me legendary
And I apologize for cussing, but when it come to rap I don't apologize for nothing
Disgusting nigga yuck to the maximum
These rap niggas rerun I'm yelling what's happening
Even if they get me they fucking with closed captioning
When you niggas dis me you ain't gettin no reaction
Cause emotions is for women and niggas who just be sittin when they pissin I ain't asking for permission
I'll just ask for they forgiveness later on
After I take the throne and bring it back to my home
No we on like the opposite of off, come from the same cloth
With TI get some Andre, Hov, and some Kanye
So how can they make saying Donnis ain't the illest where even the hottest niggas consider the boy a menace
Now we on

Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone

Alright
It's that new Wooden Leather

[Skinny Deville]
Yo, well it's a new day, full off them grits
You cooked the Sunday meal at 6
Lets get it while this gettin good cause Granny ain't gon' live forever
Season changin, we like these dependin on the weather
Look what we doin, summer's ruined, fall y'all pack y'all sweater
Somebody told me war was comin, y'all just stack y'all cheddar, better
I checked my mail the other day and Sam done sent a letter
I opened it and line for line it said I was a sucka
The nerve of this motherfucker, claimin he's my uncle
Good God almighty, Lord have mercy, think that we's in trouble
Please send some help like quick, fast, do it on the double (9-1-1)
The line been busy for days, hell maybe weeks
I've been tossin and turnin, back and forth, ensurin my 40 winks

[Ron Clutch]
Yeah I feel you dude
I be watchin the tube, toastin the rude
Notice the news ain't nothin but scandals and murder
War and destruction, poor keep sufferin
Lord it's troublin, the more you be hustlin the more you strugglin

[Hook - Skinny DeVille] (R. Prophet)
Well good God almighty look at what we have here
(And it feels so good to be herrrrrre)
I said good God almighty look at what we have here
(Welcome, this is Wooden Leather)
Well good God almighty look at what we have here
(And it feels so good to be herrrrrre)
I said good God almighty look at what we have here
(This is now Wooden Leather)

[Big V]
Trouble in my life got me hollerin baby
We be at 'em poor so I'm goin crazy
Anthrax on letters, little daddy just paged me
War got me worried, I been prayin lately
How will I live? Listen here, "life is still a bitch"
Money don't change shit, stuck in the same shit
To get it all, gotta risk it all or forget it dawg
A winner ain't a quitter and a quitter ain't a winner

[R. Prophit]
I just be steppin around the block cause I was doin my thing
My crew been kickin off all them rocks, just let my cellular ring
V said he heard a couple of shots, word is that they copped them a sting
I burn shit once my lyric drop, one false move and you're stained
We're pushin 'em 10 dollars a pop and I got exact change
It's like investin in NASDAQ had me caught in the rain
I'm 'bout to pull the mask out and have 'em screamin in vain
And I be puttin them tracks out and it's all for the brain

[Hook]

[B. Stille] - *singing*
Well we done seen everything under the sun
And been done what shouldn'ta been done
Y'all never heard of the blacks still young
Now that's one bad son-of-a-gun

[B. Stille] - *rapping*
Steppin out in the cowboy banana brim
Once you rockin camel skin like damn a Timb
DJ make this record spin, let my family in
Management go get the checks so we can begin

[Scales]
Well if it's good never turn it down
Wood still burn it down
And learn how to handle them
Plans you can cancel them (cancel them)

[R. Prophit] - *singing*
What you know no good
And what you know no good
What you know no good
And what you know no good

[Intro]
Astaghfirullah
This one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To everybody out thereâ€¦
Ya digggggg

[Verse 1]
Now I ain't trying to be the greatest
I used to hate hip-hop, yup, because the women degraded
But Too $hort made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite, I stated, though I only recited half
Omitting the word "bitch", cursing - I wouldn't say it
Me and dog couldn't relate, till a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learned it from a song I heard and sort of liked
Yeah, further ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac, Nas's "It Was Written"
Intermixed with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world and listen, it drop

[Hook]
My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
And I got no place to go
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it hurts me soul

[Verse 2]
I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinking "golly, God, guard me from the ungodly"
But by my 30th watching of "Streets is Watching"
I was back to giving props again and that was bothering
'Bout as uncomfortable as an untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustle to
Seem wrong, but these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into
And thought what constitutes a prostituteis the pursuit of profit
Then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things
With the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said "don't knock it, mind your business
His business isn't mine and that nigga pimping got it"

[Hook]
They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, they cross on fire
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced
So I got no place to go
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang time
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me
Turn off my TV cause it hurts me soul


[Verse 3]
So through the Grim Reaper sickle sharpening
Macintosh marketing
Oil field augering
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation
Islamic martyrdom, precise
Yeah, laser guided targeting
Oil for food bartering, terrorist organization harboring
Sand camouflage army men
CCF sponsoring, world conquering, telephone monitoring
Louis Vuitton modeling, pornographic actress honoring
String theory pondering, bulimic vomiting
Catholic priest fondling, preemptive bombing
And Osama and Obama 'n them
They breaking in my car again, deforestation and overlogging and
Hennessy and Hypnotiq swallowing, hydroponic coughing and
All the world's ills, sitting on chrome 24-inch wheels, like that

[Hook]
They say I'm infected, this is why I inject it
I had it aborted, we got deported
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here
But I got no place to go
I can't stop eating, my best friend's leaving
My pastor touched me, I love this country
I lost my earpiece, I hope y'all hear me
Cause it hurts me soul[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hello mothafucka, hey hi how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even tripping

[Hook]
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard

[Verse 2: Drake]
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though: I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and bucking when the hook drop

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Hold up, wait one motherfucking minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfucking meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'mma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room, Yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, "I seen it all", I said, "no you fucking didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'mma be a legend even when my life end
And I'mma be a legend even when this night ends
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothing like them
I'm goin' in!

[Hook][PART 1]

[Intro]
You don't have to be afraid
You don't even have to be brave
Living in a gilded cage
The only risk is that you'll go in

[Verse 1: Honors English]
Damn, it feels good to be a gangster
All these rap-rap-rappers are in danger
I spit that crazy shit, be going over they head
They say I'm the illest, only getting thirty percent
Maybe I need to slow it down, give 'em a slow rap
Hmmmm, maybe a gold tooth, that'll give me that gold plaque
Got a co-sign just so they call it ''a dope track''
All I need is yes men and a lil' sell-your-soul-swag
But I don't disrespect women every 3rd line
And I didn't buy Jordans for the 23rd time
I am less about fashion, more about real shit
Enough about the dress, I mean Kanye already killed it
I say turn the lyrics up, they say whatchu talking about?
Put him in the psychoward, you belong in a slaughterhouse
Oh, my fault, I'm not popping that molly
But check in Africa, you'll see I'm popping in Mali
That's presidental shit, you can't tell me I'm in the lead
And now I got success, now they all wanna succeed
But you gotta be brave if you wanna change the game
They confuse hate with love so fuck it I hate it
I love it - I'm insane

[Bridge]
The only risk is that you'll go insane
The only risk is that you'll go insane

[Hook]
And I, I, I, I think I'm losing my and my, my, my, my
I think I'm losing my mind and I
I think I'm losing my and my, my, my, my
I think I'm losing my mind and I
I, I, I, I think I'm losing my and my, my, my, my
I think I'm losing my mind and I
I think I'm losing my mind, I
I think I'm losing my mind

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Check - they wrote him off a long time ago
You would almost think they heard the wrong rhyme from Joe
Fuck myself over masturbation
So you're witnessing the growth, call it maturation
Now I don't let it tempt me, ying yang, I'm extra friendly
To all the folk that was extra and tried to end me
Shots of yack on my, they shocked we in the same building
They thought they made it collapse on me
To the accident murderers, take the time to remind 'em properly
Next time, stick around, make sure you find the body
Or kill that plan, pull it loose from it seams
And I'll be the last kid you try to put a noose on his dreams
I mean my moms was a misstress, pops was fiend out
Jail was his address, hear my insanity plea
Fuck me like you tried to and the next kid you try to lie to
Might wanna research his family tree, Joey

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Honors English]
Don't sound like you got a brain, tell 'em to join a gang
Say they stick together better than people with wedding rings
Don't tell 'em your car broke, nah, no sir
Even if you caught the bus, that's still a chauffeur
Say that you was locked down, make 'em think of jail
That way you would look forward to seeing your single sell
Skip that you went to school, say that you was on the corner
We'll take a prison record and scribble it on top of ya diploma
So about your wife - uhh - keep that a mystery
Tell 'em about strippers, give 'em that oral history
But I'mma keep it authentic, hope you understood me
If they could be destroyed by the truth, then they should be
I'm on that change the world shit, that's the answer
But I just can't find a big enough pamper
So I'mma be brave and I'mma change the game
They confuse hate with love so fuck it I hate it
I love it - I'm insane

[PART 2]

[Intro]

[Honors English]
I'm a hired assassin
Look at 'em all high'ed up and laughing
Oh, they can sense I'm here, help me re-imagine
I'm ten paces away, he in that royal chair reclined
I'm here to take over the empire state of mind
Ace of spades liquor, lemon pepper wings
Chronic lit up, candle flicker, dinner for the king
Concubines behind the strippers as I enter
I paint myself into the picture
Paint over the Maybach with a Fisker
The throne is for the taking, I whisper
Zip up or I'm leaving, ten Jesus pieces richer
The curtain comes down, a hush comes over the crowd
I tell 'em I run this town, there's no church in the wild
It's just the youth in me, what would you do if you was me?
To think they had diplomatic immunity
Truthfully we started from the bottom, now we here
What's the problem?
Oh, the problem is you got nightmares of the bottom
Cups full of Ciroc, Cuban cigar box
The Basquiat paintings start to watch
The room is half dark, the king summons the royal guards
But they turn on him and decide to pass the torch
I looked at his crown and noticed the shit was off, it was false
There was an ''F' on it and the ''F'' stood for fraud
He drops his fork as the mandate from heaven falls
His record shady, he governed by martial law
Your dynasty is no more, you assassinated what made it pure
You're now face to face with the state of the art
As the band plays the last drums, the choir have sung
His final words: ''live fast, die young'' - done
As we overthrow the king and we dump him in the back
When the cops approach be like ''Yo, it's deeper than rap''
And in the midst of the upheaval
I shapeshift back into the voice of the people
You gotta be brave if you wanna change the game
They confuse hate with love
Fuck it, I hate it, I love it
You gotta be brave if you wanna change the game
They confuse hate with love
Fuck it, I hate it, I love it, I'm insane
Damn, it feels good to be a gangster
All these rap-rap-rappers are in danger[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
First rule, never let them change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest
And never be ashamed to
Your just good at what they canâ€™t do
And they hate that, they want to paint you
In they color, put you on another
But what they donâ€™t accept, and what they donâ€™t see
The best thing is what you already be

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Oh her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like theyâ€™re not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
Sheâ€™s so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And its so, its so
Sad to think she donâ€™t see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay, I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
Thereâ€™s not a thing that I would change
Cause youâ€™re amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl youâ€™re amazing
Just the way you are

[Verse 2]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if sheâ€™d let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think its so sexy
Sheâ€™s so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know, you know, you know
Iâ€™d never ask you to change
If perfect is what youâ€™re searching for
Then just stay the same
So donâ€™t even bother asking if you look okay
You know Iâ€™ll say

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh yeah
The definition of real is
If you donâ€™t feel then you donâ€™t you feel it
Donâ€™t conceal it, donâ€™t be fair
You look great don't need silicone to build it/or botox to kill it
You just killing off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So donâ€™t get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors

[Bruno Mars]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl youâ€™re amazing
Just the way you are

[Chorus][Hook: Brendon Urie]
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
He spent most of his youth with his head down
Chubby, fugly, awkward walk and not much of a talker
He was good at setting bad examples but bad at math
Crunch time, he kept it moving like the lunch line
Working on his salad bars and fruit punch lines
His simple triplets had his english teachers tongue tied
As he starts pirouette for perfection
And Darren Aronofsky Black Swan reflection

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, he wasn't sure
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, toward something more

[Hook: Brendon Urie]

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Raised in a broken home built brick by government, cheese brick Back and forth between parents, making us sea sick
On his knees every night, praying for a little change
But the tooth fairy was broke and offered little hope
He used to stand in front of mirrors
With his toothbrush star searching
But he ain't have to search far
He was smart and made a pact with himself
With a smirk and made a vow that one day
His dad would never ever have to worry

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]

[Hook: Brendon Urie]

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Fast forward a few twenty four hours
Little boy turned man, makes good on his promise
Just to say we didn't take the trips to the Bahamas
Now your boy bank account got a few more commas
The hard work payed off, don't it?
Plus it feel good when you can say you own it
No rent, lease, loan or a mortgage
That generator money, no shortage

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]

[Hook: Brendon Urie][Intro - 50 Cent]
Yeah, It's 50 Cent, Young Buck
G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!

[Bridge - 50 Cent]
We get the club jumping from beginning to the end
Go shorty, we back up in this bitch again
We party, harder than you can imagine
You can run wit losers, or run wit winners that win

[Verse 1 - Young Buck]
I feel attention when I walk in the club
G-Unit to the socks, bitches all on a thug
Gimme a Henny on the rocks, and a bottle of bub
I don't need security, this for .4 Nickel enough
I came to ball wit y'all, buy up the bar and all
So bitches call ya hoes, and niggas call ya dogs
If you love ya wife keep her at home tonight
She might never come home again nigga, aight
Teeth, neck, wrists all lights my life's like
Riding in Cashville and running all stop lights
Homie is that real, I pray I keep living
My momma just had a dream of seeing me in prison
My daddy's a dope fiend, and I don't really miss him
Ain't seen him in 10 years and a nigga still living
The same old two step we move to a rhythm
50 holla get 'em Buck, you know I'm gonna get 'em, raaaaa!

[Hook - Young Buck]
I know you gon' let me shine and get mine
I know you gon' let me in wit this nine
I know you gon' let me smoke on my weed
I know you gon' let me drink wit no I.D
I know you gon' let me shine and get mine
I know you gon' let me in wit this nine
I know you gon' let me smoke on my weed
I know you gon' let me drink wit no I.D

[Verse 2 - Young Buck]
I know I'm sinning but I'm winning at the same time
Took a couple shots from a nigga tryin' to take mine
I'm back on the block, wit a chopper and a Tech nine
Niggas shooting cops in the hood running stop signs
G-UNIT, The Gang! Bitches doing what the thugs do
GDs, Vice Lords, Crips and the Bloods too
Move let me come through
Ain't a pair of handcuffs, can hold me
I'm riding in the old school listening to some oldies
My gold keep shinin', them hoes keep crying
The handle of my .45 outlined in diamonds
Just left Cashville, bout to fly to Miami
Hopin Yayo watchin' Eminem, perform at the Grammys
The reason niggas like Eric Benet, probably can't stand me
Cause I know money will make Halle Berry come out them panties, bitch!
Y'all niggas in trouble they should of never let me in-in

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Young Buck]
Bet ya I can make them bounce back
Teach 'em how to stunt, teach em' how to counts stacks (yeah)
Now where ya hood at, Buck If you want to
We fifty deep up in here what you gon' do
Who want beef, I ain't come for no name calling
Don't be mad cause we is and you ain't balling
Getting money is my motto for you broke folks
You spend ya whole life paying on ya car notes
It's alright if you still on the block boy
See I'mma cold young thug, not a hot boy
You know I do this for the streets, and my peeps thats behind bars
As soon as they come home, I'll go and buy them all cars, Young Buck!

[Hook]

[Bridge][Intro: Jadakiss]
Uh huh! I ain't even good with writing
I don't even write shit
I just felt, I had to write this letter to BIG
Niggas is acting like.................. Letter to BIG
Uh, yo

[Verse One: Jadakiss]
Dear Christopher Frank White Wallace
Yeah it's your boy Kiss I just want to holla
In your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet
Kangol on the rack, a fresh pair of Wallies
You know I'm still the liquor and the weed child
And still got Branson on speed dial
And everybody's the king now
You ain't gotta be nice getting shot is the thing now
Mafia was doing their best, they separated
Now Roc and Gutta doing a stretch, uh, yeah
Kim is still in it to win it
I seen Money L awhile ago but I ain't heard from Cease in a minute
People in power is queer
I could go on for a year 'bout how it would be if you were still here
The game got cheaper, rappers is more commercially successful now
But the heart's a lot weaker
You know me still got the flow that'll pop speakers
First option on offense the top feature
It's easy BIG all you need is a pro-tool set
And I ain't touch the paper that I was supposed to yet
Everybody that's somebody show respect
Only a matter of time before they notice that
I'm an impeccable lyricist
And with the right mechanics, I could take over be clear of this
They well aware of Kiss the light of the city
And I ain't on the label no more but I'm tighter with Diddy
I got my own plan handle mine like a grown man
Long as I know I'm nice, fuck it I'm my own fan
Remixed the joints you had
But, they could never ever duplicate your swag (Never)
Meanwhile I'm a keep it so on my lil' plans
And you might bump into a few of my lil' mans
Up there stepping with God
Down here Mister Cee in BK still repping you hard
T-yanna so pretty, CJ turned into a Lil' Biggie
Just a little lighter but so witty
On your born day, we get the highest
Groovy still the best with the garments, he keep me the flyest
Tonight, Patron is dead
Only right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Limon to the head
And before I end it, I gotta say thanks
Cause not only was your time well-spent, it was splendid (thanks)
...Miss you, my nigga
One Love (So we tried to hard to understand)

[Hook: Faith Evans] (Jadakiss)
So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away
(That was my letter to B.I.G., nahmean?)
You were everything - you were everything
(I felt it was only right, I really smoked with them niggas)

[Bridge: Faith Evans] (Jadakiss)
So we'll just keep our heads to the sky (Drink wit 'em)
(Sat wit 'em, talked wit 'em)
Cause we know we're gonna see you in the next lifetime (Real shit)
But it's never easy saying good-byyyyye
(See you when I get there, Biggie)
Saying - good-byyyyyyyyyyye (Love you)

[Hook: Faith Evans]
So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away
You were everything (Why you had to go awaaaaaay?)
So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away
You were everything (Oooo-hooo-oooo-hooo-oooo-hoooo...)[Hook: Colin Munroe]
Donâ€™t look back â€˜cause weâ€™re all like lightning
Here today, then weâ€™re gone like lightning
Light up the sky and live for something
Everyone lives, only few become lightning
Donâ€™t look back â€˜cause weâ€™re all like lightning
Here today, then weâ€™re gone like lightning
Light up the sky and live for something
Everyone lives, only few become lightning

[Verse 1: Donnis]
If you stand for nothing, youâ€™ll fall for it all, times is hard
These people is losing they jobs, my Homegirl Michelle out here
Losing her mom and nah, they ainâ€™t got a cure for cancer
Her little sister looking up to me for answers
All I can do is sit her down and read her the pamphlet
But what Iâ€™m supposed to say when her mama just vanish?
Gone in an instant, God, if you hear this, I need your assistance
I wanna be different but all they wanna hear about is drugs and pimp shit
Who gonâ€™ make a difference? I guess these niggas came with the wrong intentions
Manolo got fired, they ainâ€™t give him his pension
Eight years out in Couveya, he played his position
And now he serving things just to make him a living
We here on a mission and it starts in the mirror, Lord, can you hear my prayer?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Donnis]
When I say this, some people may start to hate me
Scared to get a government money to get a Haiti
Saw what they did with FEMA, scared to be a believer
Donnis no longer rapper, nah, now Iâ€™d rather be teacher
The day I saw my preacher in a Phantom with security guards
He said what up Don? I just gave him a nod
Do we need all these things to get closer to God?
Then my Auntie Taj bought us Gucci ties, see, where she reside is where dreams die
And they donâ€™t resurrect, they live in them projects
And them government projects donâ€™t help â€˜em the way you think
Sometimes I just think that they just want us to lose
I see how we depicted on the six oâ€™clock news
They feed us drugs and booze until we dazed and confused
Damn, I refuse to become another statistic to get caught in the system

[Hook]
