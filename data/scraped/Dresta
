[Intro]
Comp-ton, Comp-ton, Comp-ton
Real muthaphuckkin G's

[Verse 1: Eazy-E (Dresta)]
Hey yo Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
So you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about playin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre, motherfuck Snoop, motherfuck Death Row
Yo, and here comes my left blow
Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid you found a pup and now you're dapper
But tell me where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper
Talkin' bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his old album cover he was a she-thang
So nigga please, nigga please, don't step to deez
Motherfuckin' real G's

[Cuts] (x2)
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up
Boy you should have known by now

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Everyday it's a new rapper, claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the, nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard, is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness, to your fuckin' work
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me, knowing that they pranksters
This is going out to you studio gangstas
See I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talking about they come from projects
Knowing you ain't seen the parts of the streets G
Think you started trying to bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearing khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag, tried to sag, but you're flooding at the same time
And your set don't accept ya
Scared to kick it with your homies cause you know they don't respect ya
So nigga please, check nuts before ya step to these
Motherfuckin real G's

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition original baby gangsta
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker I'mma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
Cause if you do, then a pealed cap is all that would be left
See young niggas like me will break you off something
Claiming my city but, Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real motherfuckin G's

[Cuts]

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now nigga it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg, think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches, can come and suck my Doggy dick
Beating up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick, to smoking on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothing but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you're getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real motherfuckin G's

[Cuts]

[Outro]
Boy you should have known by now: Eazy Duz It[Intro: Eazy-E]
Hey Yella
Kick that shit
19-9-muthaphukkin-E
The muthaphukkin year of the real muthaphuckkin G's
And we gonna do this shit like this:

[Verse 1: Dresta]
Nigga evidently, ya just don't know who ya fucking with
So I suggest get in ya shit and keep truckin', bitch
Before I get my gat ya pressure case
Blast, blast I leave my gang bang layin' on ya face
I tattoo Dre name on my chest
Cross it out just another nigga that I X-ed, huh
And you won't see R.I.P., you'll see P.N.D
A Punk nigga deceased, yeah
And the bitch that was yours will be mine, buddy
All because ya woofed on a nigga that was nutty
And I had to make an example
Nigga thinks I'm crazy now but that was just a sample
Of a nigga with street wise reality
That don't give a fuck type Compton mentality
I stare back death right in the face
Contemplate my last day on and everyday base
Cause a nigga never know when he go
I hope it only takes one shot
Cause I don't wanna die slow
My funeral will be full of my peers
People that never gave a fuck about me droppin' phony tears
I hope I'm in the casket face down
So all you motherfuckers can kiss my black ass now
And fuck all that cryin' all night
Just be happy that I'm rid of this fucked up life, yeah
And now you see you can't handle me
I give a shout to Tonel and the Ruthless fuckin' family

[Transition: Eazy-E]
Out with the old in with the motherfuckin' new. But check this shit out. I got somebody for ya, bitch. Motherfucker

[Verse 2: Sylk]
Now it's about time for the Sylk to speak
Check dat ass last weak
You off the chronic and you tweak
Speak when I feel
Cause I'm as real as they come
I'm a bitch with a gun
Never run ain't for none
So step, step up
If ya wanna test ya luck, trick
Sister like Sylk
Really don't give a fuck, bitch
Punk bitches wanna step phony speak howdy doody
I make ya self break ya self bitch you never knew me
Yours truly no longer layin' in the cut
Steady fuckin' shit up
Never see me shakin' my butt, I strut
Like a gangsta bitch, no, not a pranksta bitch
I'm quick to gank a bitch, trick
Peep game at this bitch as I shoot this
Gangsta bitch steppin' rollin' with the Ruthless

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
The R-U-T-H-L-E double S, yo, it's the nigga Knocc Out
Claim the Blocc so nigga whats next
Try to step and flex and get wrecked like a mack truck
I'm kickin', tah spittin' this funky shit to make a quick fat buck
I'm doggin' a dog you suckers can't talk about tip flip I rip shit
I'm stressin'
"Damn cuz", "Pick it back up"
Chillin' up in the studio
With the Ruthless Family
Fuck the Death Row posse
Yo, them fools can not handle me
Snoop and Andre ya come and try to fade the
Loc'ed out, Compton, original baby gangsta
1-8-7's how we do it on the west
Ya say ya shit is chronic but to me it's more like stress
Or should I say make my shit the stronic
Tha Dogg Pound don't wanna step to the atomic dog
D-O-T-K-N-O-Double-C-O-U-T so motherfucker come and fuck with me

[Transition]
Come on, come on

This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check
Ruthless motherfuckin' family ya still in effect [x3]

This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check
Ruthless motherfuckin' family ... kick that shit

[Eazy-E]
Jealousy is a motherfucker when your the man
With the upper hand I don't give a shit
Clock a grip like no other can
Wanna be like me be a G like me
But I'm the nigga that made a G
Outta the bitch D-R Eazy
I was the captain
Dre was my sidekick
Everything was cool
Til he wanted to get what I get
Any other real G, Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E
Now claimin' you a G
How does it feel to be me[Intro: Dresta (B.G. Knocc Out)]
Knock knock! (who's there?)
Well it's the gang S-T-A-sta (the gangsta who?)

[Verse 1: Dresta]
Yo, it's your brother gangsta Dresta
Open up the door so I can flow and let 'em know
That me and B.G. Knocc is good to go to make the dough
That's my little brother, that's my dawg, that's my nigga
I'm the big brother cause I'm older and I'm bigger
Here to clock the ends and hit the skins on the daily
My little brother B.G. Knocc he drives the girlies crazy
Close like buddies but yo he mo' than my brother
We got two others and C. C. is our mother
Grew up in Compton and the bootys on the west side
Used to live in the east side but we chose the best side
Had it kinda rough but that only made us tough
We don't take much stuff, we kick up 'nough dust
Trust no ho, or no man, shit can't even trust each other
And even though I love her, it's hard for me to trust my mother
And that's just the way we was raised back in the days
Me, myself and I from the cradle to the grave
Never had a daddy, damn right, I'm a bastard
Momma was my daddy because daddy wasn't a factor
Don't feel bad because I don't need a dad
It's like this, I can't miss what I never had

[Hook: Dresta (B.G. Knocc Out)]
So niggady-Knocc can you come and wreck the set? (Yes!)
So, won't you grab the microphone and flex next? (Yes!)

[Verse 2: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well it's the niggady Knocc ready to pop like a Glock
With my brother D-R-E and we back on the block
As these funky cluck hoes fuck all on the duck
But for now my time is taken, so bitch you gets naythin
Microphone check, hit the deck, if you can't take the heat
Original baby gangsta's straight from the street
With the beat that'll bump in the trunk of your shit
So nigga bump this and I bet you bump a bitch
With the quickness cos I'm quick to kick some dope shit
K-N-O-double C-O-U-T will always make a hit
And we'll never flip flop, always keep it hip hop
A nigga dissin' on my bro, watch him fall like a drip drop
From the faucet, show me the mic and watch me toss it
And kick some derranged shit to make you think I've lost it
Ah shit, I'm ready to rock I'm ready to roll and rock
So give a nigga some room before I tick and I tock
And explode like a bomb with the mic within my palm
Won't you take a walk with me through the Compton Vietnam
And let me show ya, fools much bolder
A busta is a punk compared to a fuckin soldier
Act like you know, I'm a pro with a hell of a flow
Kickidy K to the O, ain't no motherfuckin joke, so
Step to a loc and prepared to get smoked
By me and my motherfuckin big bro

[Hook: Dresta (B.G. Knocc Out)]
So niggady-Knocc can you come and wreck the set? (Yes!)
So, won't you grab the microphone and flex next? (Yes!)

[Verse 3: Dresta]
Well here I am, once again it's the Dresta
Straight outta Compton, original baby gangsta
Quick to grab the microphone and come and start some conflict
Never seen a convict, come and drop the bomb shit
Take a good look because your lookin at a crook
My life done been took, right outta Donald Owens book
See I did the crime so I did the time
But now I'm back out, packin my nine
Scoopin up girls with the the swiftness
And if its possible to stick 'em with the quickness, I'm with this
I'll really don't need a girl but I do need a friend
To give me some love, slap on the girlfriend hit the skins
Packin the ends, payin' the bills with my skills
Never hesitate to tell somebody how I feel
Me and my brother Knocc be doin damage in the 90's
I was down straight from '88 up to '93
That was like 5 years my little brother didn't have big bro
Around to help lead him down the right path
But I'm back out and we tighter than we've ever been
Tryin' to make some ends so we can go where we never been

[Hook: Dresta (B.G. Knocc Out)]
So niggady-Knocc can you come and wreck the set? (Yes!)
So, won't you grab the microphone and flex next? (Yes!)

[Verse 4]

[Verse 4: Dresta (B.G. Knocc Out)]

(We'll sock out a fool with no hesitation)
And split him up like segregation
(So when you stepping, you testing your luck)

Knoccie niznick hit his ass with the pipe
(Dre catch him with the right)
Yeah, I'm a dog but I don't bark

[B.G. Knocc Out / Dresta]
We take a punk nigga to a park, bust caps in the mark
Knocc and Dre here we go again, with the flow again
From the West Side, C-O-M-P-T-O-N

And hoes on my diznick every time we belling
Question after another, yo, we got the same mother
Bitch, so we real brothers[Verse 1: Dresta]

To pump in ya jeep
Or in ya caravan wit' tha homies kinda deep
Smokin' on a thai stick feelin' kinda high wit'
Ya passenger seat occupied by a fly bitch
Rollin' in your lo-lo
Cutlass, or your M-C
Slap in the hip-hop
To hell with the Temprees
Modern day gangsta from the underground, yeah
Niggas roll around wit' the boomin' ass sound
Got the 6-4 kinda low as we bouncing
On the Grapevine rollin' deep to Magic Mountain
Hoes on ya jock everytime ya hit a corner
Because ya rollin' twisted on them gold Daytonas
Frontin' on the regular, talkin' on ya cellular
Actin' like ya don't hear the little bitches yellin' ya
Name at the bus stop, ya don't stop
Ya mash on the gas, roll right by they ass
Slap Dresta in the dash, yeah

[Hook: Dresta]

Rollin' through the C-P-T
Turn up the hump sounds, we groovin' to the mellow beat
Mad doggin' like bitches, hittin' me up like I'm a banger

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Beat for the street

Hittin' my switches and runnin' the bitches
And now I'm bustin' mo' hoes
Roll up to the swapmeet, hop out and hit the chirp chirp
Bail in put on some proper shorts and a proper shirt
Just clownin' cause hoes are in the house
Ridin' my dick because I got fame and my name is B.G. Knocc Out
Asking to be in my next video
Get the 7 digits, slap that ass and said "See ya, ho"
Now I'm off like a G, flee to the C-P-T
See my niggas on the block gettin' tipsy
I pulled up and start tearin' up the street
And guess what's in my motherfuckin' deck
Gangsta beat for the street

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I got beat for the street, to the beach I'll be rollin'
Never see me strollin'
40s I be holdin'
Girls in the Daisies
Drive Eazy crazy
Rolled up my windows, as I turned on my A/C
Rollin' down Crenshaw see tha hoes jockin'
Sunday night's poppin'
See the foes hoppin'
My stereos bump at that A-T-L funk
You can call it what you want
Either way that shit bumps
[Dresta: "Damn Right!"]

[Outro x4: Eazy-E]
Bein' a gangsta is so neat, yeah
Gangsta beat for the street[Intro: B.G. Knocc Out]
"Haha, yeah. Orginal baby gangsta's in this, motherfucker, ha. With the D-R-motherfuckin'-E, hu. In a ... what we gonna do right now?"
(Dog catchers about to get ya)
"We serve these marks from the Dogg Pound, killa. Check it out."
(Dog catchers about to get ya)

[Verse 1]

[Dresta]
Easily I approach the microphone because I ain't no joke
Nigga tell Kurupt, Nate and Daz I'mma buck 'em
Matter of fact tell that whole Pound I say fuck 'em
It's a new year so put the bustas in their plizace
B.G. Knocc, Gangsta Dresta bring it to your fizace
Ryders on a mission
I catch you slippin'
You gettin' struck clown
So fuck any busta down with the Mutt Pound

[B.G. Knocc Out]
It's the Compton City G, nigga
Bow to your knees, nigga
Run up in your hood cock back my strap and pull the trees, nigga
And if you slippin', you know I'm gonna wet ya
I'm the baby boss hog, better known as the Dogg catcher
Bow wow, yippee yay, did you hear me say
I'm a Dogg killa, cause all Doggs have they day

[Dresta]

I pull my nine and blow a mind, everytime I bust 'em
I trust no man and that's from now until infinity
Nigga you either my homie or just consider yourself my enemy
Niggas out here fake dog, like Nate Dogg
I swear you made it, but talkin' that shit to Dre
Will get you and your DJ regulated
Bitches come a dime a sack, so let's get it straight
A fake is what I hate, so fuck Kurupt, Daz and Nate

[B.G. Knocc Out]
Motherfuckin' fake
Niggas be thinkin' that they can get with the real deal
What I would do if I was you is take a chill pill
Yet and still tricks, I gave your click a pass
But when I see that busta Daz
I gotta bank his ass
Smash, down another puppy pound clown
With the round from my smith
And watch his body shift
Drift his soul in the wind as they carry you
And B.G. K-O can dig your hole before they bury you

[Bridge X2]
(Pranksters, studio gangstas, bustas)
(Softer than a bitch but portrayed the role of gangsta)
(Pranksters, studio gangstas, bustas)
Stupid motherfucker
(Yeah, that's what I'm sayin')

[Verse 3]

[B.G. Knocc Out]
So now you niggas know who in the fuck you fuckin' with
B-G and D-R-E, nigga, the baby gangsta clique
As we did some gangsta shit
From a real G's perspective
Niggas get all like pumped
While I stay calm and collective
I check those suckas
They callin' self and causin' ruckus
'94 set claimin', Snoop, D-O bangin bustas

[Dresta]
Much love to the B-G, C-P-T
Much love to the D-R-E, O-B-G
Much love to the Eazy-E, C-P-T
And D-P-G don't wanna see us, see see
You fools ain't nothin' but marks, so fuck your set
Now what's next, I doubt if you wanna flex, no respect
Run up and get wrecked
You tried to diss the B.G., although we let that shit pass
Daz you fuck around and find your ugly ass
Smashed in a trash bag, fool
You wannabe's gonna be layin' down
If you keep fuckin' around with the Compton Dogg Pound

[Hook X2][Intro]
Sippin' on a 40
And smoking endo
Sippin' on a 40
And smoking endo

[Verse 1]
[Dresta]
Ayo, let's roll to the store, Eazy-E
So we can buy us some O.E. 40oz
Gettin' a buzz with the thugs in the neighborhood's back
But buy you a couple of extra one's for the neighborhood rats

[Eazy-E]
Nigga, you be drinkin' out my bottle, bitch, that's bullshit

So gimmie a couple of dollars, so I can bring you back a duece duece

[B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, bring B.G. Knocc Out back a motherfuckin' 40o'

So I can spit game at this trick
Cause beer breath and tricks don't mix

[Eazy-E]
Y'all don't give a fuck what a punk bitch stank
Cause my breath always stank every time I take a drank
40's I be downin', I'm drownin' myself
Let me hit the joint and I'll be clownin' everybody else

[Dresta]
You won't be clownin' me, cause I got dose for your trick ass
Oh bitch you tryin' tah bag, I got dose for your bitch ass
Well, let me hit the joint once again and we can go, G
But, oh, let me take another sip off the O.E

Me and BG Knocc Out swingin back to Compton

[BG Knocc Out]
Yes, well I'm back on the block where the BG's chill
Where niggas like to get ill
But marks get killed
Feel the strength of a loc
As I go for broke
Step right up and get smoked
Cos I ain't no joke
Wack MC's I knock them out the box
You can go kick ass
Or either get your ass kicked
Steady packin my chrome
And I'm known, for hoo bangin
BG Knocc Out, I got clout
And I'm Compton swingin

[Hook]

[BG Knocc Out]
Givin up love to the hood
The city where I'm from
So when you come to Compton
You better bring a big gun
Or run and hide from the 165
Worldwide
Niggas thats straight do or die
Taggin out my set
As I mob through your town
Crossing out the Dogg Pound
Cos i'mma haul ground
So don't trip
You might get your fuckin lip split
Cos niggas from Compton don't play that shit
Still up on top
And you know it don't stop
All busta's bow down
Or prepare to get dropped
By that nigga named Knocc
As I rock your block
And I bet you never seen the BG callin shots
Down for my turf
Put in work in my days
Now I'm in the house, without a doubt
Tryin to get paid
Laid back and relax
With tracks to keep you bumpin
Original baby gangsta
And I'm swingin back to Compton

[Hook]

[Dresta]
It ain't nuthin but the Compton G
D-R-E-S-T-A-ster
Nutty nigga Dresta
Givin girls the vapours
Take ya
Second to relax your brain
I'm still the same
You know my name
I don't get caught up in fame
I do my thang
And hang with my homies non stop
Much props, to Compton and Watts, yeah
Sure shot, a body rock
Mix Master Spade, used to rock my block
But now its history
Another mystery, of a legend
And I been checkin mics since 87
Steady on these stripes
On the streets with my speech
And keeps me a new chick to freak every week
So girls you can page me
With a freakin outburst
Or you can leave a message with my niggas up at outburst
Though i'll hit you back with a voice mail or somethin
And tell you meet me in the hood
I'm swingin back to Compton

[Hook till fade][Intro: Dresta]
[B.G. Knocc Out:] 50/50 love
Yeah, for 199-motherfuckin'-5
[K.O.:] 50/50 love
Gangsta Dresta just stepped through the doors once again
[K.O.:] 50/50 love
Dedicating this one to all my niggas all across the land
[K.O.:] 50/50 love
We need a 50/50 love back in the hood, loc
Check this out

[Verse 1: Dresta]
I walked through the turf
Me and Smurf jibba-jabbing about the old days
Smokin' on a joint
Listenin' to The O'Jays
Fucks up my mind to see how times changed
It's all kinda strange
Ain't a damn thang the same
Back when it was all about packin' switchblade
Half of us down now is runnin' around bitch made
Didn't wanna fight brothas grown that was known
But now it's on, if one of the homies come at me wrong
Back then things was like hyped
Even if the homies fight
Still kept the hood tight
Down with each other to the last bit
Now we got homies puttin' each others into caskets
Used to roll in Chevys, now niggas wanna benzie
Money and dope dem brought jealousy and envy
Niggas got greedy and the needy got left back
Now your own homie is the victim of your next jack
Servin' nigga with the gat
Stuffed in your mouth
Used to sleep on your couch
Spendin' nights at your house
And it's a damn shame that the hood ain't like it was
I'm talkin' about a 50/50 luv

[Hook x2]

I ain't talkin' about 70/30
(A 50/50)
Not 60/40
(A 50/50)
I'm talkin' about 50/50 love, yeah

[Verse 2: Dresta]
The homies used to take us to the liquor store to steal beer
That was when my cousin Gugulo was still here
Buddy gave a party like almost every weekend
I've been tryna sneak in, tryna put my freak in
See how times changed, one of the sets we used to fight with
But that set now is one of the sets that we tight with
Time's still changin' cause brothas turnin' into snitches
Can't seperate the real niggas from the bitches
Even in the jailhouse niggas being phony
You really don't know, who to treat like a homie
Back in the day we used to claim we was brothas
And cousins and shit and now we can't trust eachother
Gotta watch my back not just cause a brotha gaze for niggas that
Bang for the same thang that I claim
Homies locked down doing time in a chamber
We talkin' about 'em a lot but yet we treatin' 'em like a stranger
I recollect the days when I was back in like the 6th grade
Tuckin' about behind the O.G.'s
Learnin' how the trick's played
Damn, a nigga really kinda miss how them days was, G
Cause it was 50/50 love

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: B.G, Knocc Out]
For the homies that's restin' I pour a little drink right
But how many others go visit dem at their grave site
Forget the bullshit, pass the hats around the room homes
Let's go and visit the homies and put some flowers on their tomb stones
Yeah, cause that's the least we can do, you know
Be in the hood that they died fo'
And loved ones cried fo'
I missed 'em with a passion fo' what it's worth
I hope I meet 'em again when I leave from this earth
And we done lost many of 'em
And it's a shame that we let 'em go
Without lettin' 'em know we love 'em
But now I'mma let the homies rest in peace
And all the homies that's beefin' with eachother, loc, gotta cease
I can't speak about nobody else
Can't be street with nobody else until we be peace with ourselves
Homies ain't homies like it was
I really don't know who wants to fill me with slugs
Without the backstabbin'
Everything would probably fun
That's how it is in the hood that I come from
Damn, a nigga really kinda miss how dem days was
Cause it was 50/50 love

A mac ass L-O-C with the homicidal tendency
Nutty Nutty dumping bloody bodies up in the sea

It's my homeboy Crooked I
I'm Dresta Tha Gangsta kna 'mean?
We supposed to pick up my homeboy Eiht
I wan' try to hit him up right now to see what's happ'nin

(Verse 1 by Dresta)
I know you love it, the most rugged Mc's, out the Gate
It's Dresta with them drunkest Crooked I and the Eiht
Oh-Oh, 2 Compton niggas known for freakin 'em right
Man, Crooked late at night got 3 and they tight
In the Bourbon, swervin', do Irvine try'na catch Eiht
So we can hook him with the 3rd fine lady
Named Mercedes, got a body like a 'Maserati'
Thinkin to myself:'I must be crazy! Tryna give away this hottie!'
Now I glance at the passenger seat
Can't deny that this girl by my side was just too damn fly
Too Jeopardized, I just glanced at her eyes
And them caramel thighs make my main man rise
Can't wait to re-arrive at the 'tele
So I can lick them honey off that ring on her belly
For so', I glance in the mirror once mo'
Loc, I gotta catch Eiht cause I know he gon' love this ho

(Chorus)
Real G's get lonely
We can have fun but bring some for the homie
(Sweet Black Pussy)
I only fuck with real niggas only
We can have fun but bring some for the homie
(Sweet Black Pussy)

(Verse 2 by Mc Eiht)
I gives a damn how these hoes tryna floss these days
Cause they still gets the nuts, fucks tramps and sluts
I must have kill it, the way you want me, ride the pony
'Secrets' like Toni(Braxton), members only
Dresta, I heard they turn in tricks for bucks
2 tricks get the dicks hard, ready to suck
Don't be havin me in suspense, but in the meanwhile
I be dippin up in the LB with C-Style
Back to the CPT, home bud and Tanquerina
Beatin' up the pussy like Ike(Turner) beat up Tina(Turner)
You know me, the gangsta love'll never wine and dine
Keep it tight, anytime I fuck it like [name]
Lately the Hype, I know it ain't right
3 a.m. I ring your phone every night
Let's play house, no cat and mouse
Don't floant it, Eiht just give it how you want it
But in the end don't press your luck
Because ain't no bitch like the bitch I fucked!

(Chorus)

(Verse 3 by Crooked I)
Fuck the bullshit, the pimps at the pool pit
I know that you want chips but dick is all you get
I knock them skins out like always trained by custom auto
Never givin' a bitch shit, that's a hustlers motto
Except sumptin' to swallow
Now your boyfriend wanna follow
Hit a nigga with a hollow tip and fuck the bitch tomorrow
I can never be your simp, trick!
I'm slappin bitches with 9 inches, the limp dick
Plus a pimps dick
Dig short, small, diggin 'em large and tall
Y'all the bigger they are the harder they fall
I fuck 'em all!!
The ho-philosopher, broke, dope and popular
Still strokin' , now goin deeper than Ocean (??)
I got your 'bra, gettin ready for the pony ride
Doggy-style, so I can hit the backsiiiide
Grab the head pump that ass in the air
What did you know?
The ho hollered:'how ya do dat dere?!'

(Chorus)

...Sweet Black Pussy... -till the end[Verse 1: Dresta]
I like big butts, but big tits drive me nuts
And heres another cut from the Compton slut
The naughty nigga named Dresta, the westside gangsta
Comin' back with more skills, than the buffalo bills
I'm makin mo' deals, than a strawberry might
I'll lick your clit, if you suck my pipe
Cause I ain't ashamed to get down on the ground
And swing you around like a merry-go-round
While I held your mound
The freaks come out at night
But freaky Dre comes anytime of the day
That's what they say
Cause I'm the horniest nigga in rap now
So lay your bare back down
And show me that crack now
Damn, girl your a gift
And bitches on Soul Train, still get my dick stiff
And I've been watchin' them hoes for a good minute
Shakin' that ass while I was wishin' I was in it
I'm all about bustin' nutts
And sexin' up the big girl's butts
Vanilla, brown or black ass can be
Don't matter cause a bitch is a bitch to me
So here bitch put your lips around my weiner
Bustin' hoes from Compton to Alsadina
Have you seen her
Shake that ass with respect
I pump more rump shakers than Wrex-N-Effect
How can a nigga say it right, let's see
I gets more pussy than a dyke
I like different hoes
But I never get naked with a snake bitch
Only pull my clothes to my ankle, wanna stank ho
Cause I'm a real nigga from the Candy Block
And since I'm makin' ends, hoes wanna hand me cock
You think you got ho'd to a rich brother
But don't know, I'm still broke than a motherfucker
But I'mma let cha think I got the riches
And keep runnin' up in you gold diggin' bitches
Get the dough then I hit the do'
To let the bitch know I'm the Compton ho

[Hook: B.G. Knocc Out (x2)]
Bitch lay down, take of them clothes
Spread the thighs wide open for the Compton ho

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Compton new and improved
With a groove guarenteed to hit
And it's more funky than Bootsy, while he takin' a shit
Cause I can do mo', than you will ever know
The neighbourhood ho, with the Compton flow
I'm never hesistent, when I represent my residence
Givin' it all I got, 165 percent
Hangin' out with my homies or my dogs everyday like
Party never stop, tick tock til the day light
Kickin' it with my nigga B.G. Moy, that's my homeboy
Killin' for the gusto, never trust a ho
Dresta's my name, original baby gangsta main
Rest in peace to Vamp, Crazy D and Wayne
Tick tock non stop on the block and it's like that
Gotta give a shout to my homegirl Nick Nack
Tick tack toe, I got the dough but I want mo'
Even though you know I'm a bonafied ho
See I gets the ends for the skins that I hit
I get to lick your slit to make you kickin' shit
I get'cha body hot with just one touch
And for you to freak your stuff, won't cost you much
Just 25 dollars an hour to make you holler
Another 10 dollars I'll eat your pussy in the shower
Come on and take your big booty for a ride
I'll cover my eyes and let you be the guide
Cause ain't no limitations on the things we do
I'll let my tongue lick where you want me to
As long as you're kickin' indo I don't care so
Bitch take a flick with the Compton ho

[Hook: B.G. Knocc Out (x5)]

[Verse 3: Dresta]
Your pussy be the lake that my face be fishin' in
So lick this dick to any bitch that's listenin'
Catchin' more hoes than a target at a gun range
Bitches call me daddy Dre, cause they know I run thangs
Go with the flow cause you know I'm a pro
At hustlin' a ho outta all her dough
And I'm the type of nigga that never kick a grunyan
But I'm quick to use my bunions
To kick you in your onion
Hoes outta know I don't find shit funny
You can keep your honey
Bitch give me your money, yeah
Cause being broke ain't no motherfuckin' joke
So give me a c-note for every stroke
Broke in the fully, yeah, money be the reason
I do it every season, get paid while in skizin'
Never had to buy clothes, bitches buy me wardrobes
Gotta keep a job bitch cause I don't fuck the poor hoes
Yes you can say I'm a modern day gold digger
Hoes figure I don't give a fuck cause I'm a bold nigga
I'll tell it like it is, got to go with the flow
If you got the dough call up the Compton ho

[Hook: B.G. Knocc Out (x6)][Hook]
Hey hey hey (Comptoooooooon Compton swingin)
All day every day Knocc Out and Dre
All day every day Knocc Out and Dre
Hey hey hey (Comptoooooooon Compton swingin)
All day every day Knocc Out and Dre
All day every day Knocc Out and Dre

[Dresta]
Yeah, you know in 94
Me and my bro
Hit your ass with a blast
Now we gotta hear this trash
From this busta named Daz (but Daz)
Ain't Nothin but a mark who be buggin out
Stop the monkey shit
Put my fist in your monkey mouth
So everybody swing with me
D-R-E, O-B-G from the C-P-T
It's on again so tell a friend
We got it poppin
Me and BG Knocc Out swingin back to Compton

[BG Knocc Out]
Yes, well I'm back on the block where the BG's chill
Where niggas like to get ill
But marks get killed
Feel the strength of a loc
As I go for broke
Step right up and get smoked
Cos I ain't no joke
Wack MC's I knock them out the box
You can go kick ass
Or either get your ass kicked
Steady packin my chrome
And I'm known, for hoo bangin
BG Knocc Out, I got clout
And I'm Compton swingin

[Hook]

[BG Knocc Out]
Givin up love to the hood
The city where I'm from
So when you come to Compton
You better bring a big gun
Or run and hide from the 165
Worldwide
Niggas thats straight do or die
Taggin out my set
As I mob through your town
Crossing out the Dogg Pound
Cos i'mma haul ground
So don't trip
You might get your fuckin lip split
Cos niggas from Compton don't play that shit
Still up on top
And you know it don't stop
All busta's bow down
Or prepare to get dropped
By that nigga named Knocc
As I rock your block
And I bet you never seen the BG callin shots
Down for my turf
Put in work in my days
Now I'm in the house, without a doubt
Tryin to get paid
Laid back and relax
With tracks to keep you bumpin
Original baby gangsta
And I'm swingin back to Compton

[Hook]

[Dresta]
It ain't nuthin but the Compton G
D-R-E-S-T-A-ster
Nutty nigga Dresta
Givin girls the vapours
Take ya
Second to relax your brain
I'm still the same
You know my name
I don't get caught up in fame
I do my thang
And hang with my homies non stop
Much props, to Compton and Watts, yeah
Sure shot, a body rock
Mix Master Spade, used to rock my block
But now its history
Another mystery, of a legend
And I been checkin mics since 87
Steady on these stripes
On the streets with my speech
And keeps me a new chick to freak every week
So girls you can page me
With a freakin outburst
Or you can leave a message with my niggas up at outburst
Though i'll hit you back with a voice mail or somethin
And tell you meet me in the hood
I'm swingin back to Compton

[Hook till fade]Hahaha, this is 4 all you fools dat don't know what's up yet...

[Verse 1: Dresta]
I come ruff
I come real ruff and get enough stuff
Demolition buster, leave 'em lookin' like suckers
I'm a bastard, not an actor
Bitch attractor
Momma was my daddy because daddy wasn't a factor
Back on the block: Compton & Watts
Could smoke rocks together
[B.G. overlapping] Compton & Long Beach together?
Nigga, never! Ever got along
It's the same song I'm singin'
When I'm bringin' the deal
You gotta respect how I feel - it's real
I chill with my homies and have a ball
If you can't speak the truth, nigga, don't speak at all, nigga

[Hook x4]
Compton & Watts gets much props back
On the block, pop the Glock cause we can't stop ... can't stop

[Verse 2: Dresta]
It's time for the phony and the fakes to devour
And separate the real deal niggas from the cowards
Never respect a nigga that's tryna be somebody else
I could respect a nigga more that's tryna rap and be yourself
You gotta speak what you feel and what you been thru
You never seen cell but speak that you been to
You think you get respect if you lies that you did time
With everybody around you already know you never did crime
See, I did mine but I don't think it makes me bigger
Cause I figure in or outta jail - I'm still a real motherfuckin' nigga

[Hook x4]
Compton & Watts [x6]
[Hook x3]

[Verse 3: Dresta]
A product of the projects
When I flex or wrecks the set
And brothers checkin' they hoes
Because they breakin' they necks
To tryna see: the D, the R, the E, the S-T-A STA, Dresta
The Westside Compton Gangsta
I keep my homie with me everytime I'm drivin'
Not talkin' about my nigga, homie, I'm talkin' about 4-5-in
Strivin' to be the best that I can be
But it's kinda fucked up in the C-P-T
Tryna move up but something tryna hold ya back
Police jack 4 crack, niggas jack 4 lack
Watch yo back! This fucked up while all this getting worse
Every other day, another nigga and another hearse
Pop, pop goes the Glock cause we can't be stopped
Much props to Compton & Watts

[Hook x9]
Compton & Watts [x4]
[Hook x4][Intro: Dresta]
*laughing*
Yeah, you niggas ain't knowin'
*laughing*
B.G. Knocc Out on a motherfuckin' mission
*laughing*
Puttin' marks in check
Cause bustas get no respect
*laughing*
Yeah, it's the big bad west side, mad ass Compton

[Verse 1: B.G. Knocc Out]
Early afternoon as I start my day
With a fat ass jay and a bottle of Alazay
Dips to the turf and as I roll up the block
I see my niggas in the cut with they Glocks cocked
Back, ready to peel a nigga's cap
Cause in the wicked west side it's some like that
I got to watch my back, cause niggas know my face
So I packs a 9-double-m just to stay safe
When I'm rollin' or just dippin' through traffic
A sucker stare me down. I'mma let his ass have it
With the automatic
And keep dippin' lane to lane, as I throw up the N for the west side gang
Nigga, it ain't no future and you frontin' or you fakin'
And youngstas like me ain't givin' up nothin'
So, until you motherfuckers recognize
This is big bad west side, nigga, do or die

[Hook: La Tee (Dresta)]
Never will I run, never will I hide
(This is big bad west side, nigga, do or die)

[Verse 2: B.G. Knocc Out]
Steady bangin', steady slangin', steady hangin'
With my niggas still maintainin'
Like a loc inhaling doja smoke
And as long as I keep jackin' I'mma never go broke
I fall shorter than a midget with no knees
While all these marc niggas rollin' around on D's
Please, I gots to get my man
Anyway I can with this gat in my hand
I could come up with the master plan
Blast a man if he don’t cooperate now
Draw the gat to his head, tell him to lay face down
On the ground and don’t make a move
Cause you’ve already taken a loss and if you do you really lose
Out on your life, your kids and wife
So be a smart man and come about the knives
If you do then I let you stay alive
But if you don’t then I guess you gotta die

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
I got a call from my nigga sayin' the homie went down (damn)
He got caught slippin' by some niggas from the town
Now he’s in M-L-K in critical condition
Fuck that I got to go on a mission for my nigga
Cause I know he do it for me
Now I’m waitin' for the little homies
To come back with the G ride
And take a trip to the east side
Catch a clown slippin' and open fire on his black ass
And blast on ‘em all night, cause I believe in the theory
‘Take a life for a life’, yeah
Now my homie ain’t the only one who fell
Cause I know for sure I sent one down to hell
Nigga, and I’m still tryin' to earn some stripes
So you best not get caught slippin' cause it’s on, on sight
Two funerals in one week, so now I gots to suit up
One I’m rollin' a ten and the other I’m gonna shoot up
Say what’cha gonna do what to B.G
Right about now, yo, I don’t think you wanna see me
Because it wouldn’t be a happy scene
All you see is me unload the whole seventeen
Rounds, dead up in your chest
That’s what you get for runnin' up without a bullet proof vest, sucker
Before I die I’m gonna take at least five
Cause when you’re from the N-U-T-T-Y
It's do or die

[Hook x4]

[Outro]
This is big bad west side, nigga, do or die (x3)[ VERSE 1: KAM ]
Well, it's the 1 to the 9 with the 9 to the 4
And I thought you knew the drill but you still don't hear me doe
KAM and Watts Up from the grassroots
No Daisy Dukes shit, knockin crazy-ass boots
Nigga please, we kick it like gees
Puttin down work when I lurk, don't even sneeze (up the gold D's)
That's just the Eastside way of gettin chips
When you're raised up dealin with the Dogs and the Ribs
New cars get tagged, riders get wrecked
Niggas' caps get peeled back and chins get checked
Don't expect no love or no apology
The kids ain't fallin for your child psychology
In nine and fo mindin yo business was the best bet
Screamin 'Watts Riot', we ain't even made a mesh yet
You shouldn't speak with a weak heart
You gots to finish everything you start
That's why I'm down for mine

[ Hook ]
(Get down for yours
I'm down for mine)

"?????"
"To get away from the A.K. spray in the broad day"
"South Central the, ill mental"
"Just kept steppin, hit em up and said right"

[ VERSE 2: MC Ren ]
Well, it's the Mad Scientist with my nigga KAM
Niggas be knowin the way I be doin it, fuckin up the jam
The size ten steel toe steppin, nigga, keep my shit simple
Hangin with my niggas on Caldwell and Temple
Niggas out fakin like they got skills
Rollin 'round with they rats in they floss mobiles
With their caviar dreams and champagne wishes
Niggas run they mouth like some muthafuckin bitches
Niggas be plottin like the government
But I'm low key like a Mason, so they still chasin
The nigga that they thought was the Villain, that's wrong
Different individual and different fuckin song
I carry a big stick, burnin is the heater
Niggas ???? with the German millimeter
So I fuck it up when I bust my rhyme
Cause Ren down for mine, a nigga down for mine

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3: KAM ]
Well, I once had this homeboy who loved to jack
We used to serve herb for a doub a sack
In fact back in the day when you could sling lley
Couldn't nobody tell me that crime didn't pay
It was on and poppin with the Bloods and Crips
Every neighborhood tryin to regulate they chips
Niggas goin out of town with the greasy chickens
And if you wasn't down, you was easy pickins
You had to claim a set to get supported then
So every day new niggas got courted in
For some gangbangin was a full time job
Cookin up dope like corn on a cob
Had to mob deep when you bailed into a party
Daytons on the MC with the wooden ?????
Flag in your backpocket, deuce five in the front
Rollin bats with the zig-zags 'fore we knew about the blunts
But no matter who jocks us
I got my sag on till you saw the tag on my boxers
Cause the I-don't-give-a-fuck mentality'll raise niggas off yo line
So I'm down for mine

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 4: Dresta ]
Let me take a second to do some mic-checkin
Bet I got a head flexin in every section
Everybody know me, D-r-e the O.G
Compton City Gee on TV with Eazy
But now I'm all on my own and got it locked shot
Give them props up to my nigga KAM (Watts Up)
It ain't no shame in the game that I got
The only places I love a lot is Compton and Watts
And nigga, I don't give a fuck about what clique you in
Cause I'm from the Nutty but got buddies in the Nickerson
P.J., Main Street, Grape Street, front streets and back streets
But we all from the same black streets
So niggas best to recognize the Dresta
Tired of bein broke so all I think about is paper
And it don't stop to the tic-toc
(Compton and Long Beach together) [edited] Compton and Watts
Fool, and I'm down for mine

(Get down for yours
I'm down for mine)[Dresta]
Bang bang bang
Pull the trang
As I shoot my shit
And I flaunt my gift
Leaving another stiff
It's me, the D
Yeah, the Compton thug
I get down like mud
When I'm high of bud
Little Sally Walker
Jackin from a saucer
Sally wanted dick
So the gangstas quick to toss her
Niggas wasn't knowin' Gangsta Dresta's kinda loco
Always out for mo' hoes
So put the lock on your hoes
When I come around
I get around like 2Pac
But you jock
The same little hoes that the crew got
Didn't you get mad when you found out I dug her
Cos thats about the same time you realised you love her
Nigga, who the bitch
Is you the bitch
I guess if you knew the bitch
You know, how to do the bitch
Screw the bitch
And send the hooker on her way
Suckin like I did my bitch, Jesse Mayer
The Compton thug
Gettin love by many
But I'm hated by masses
So fuck they asses
Niggas say they men
And they large, but they so alone
Bitches got
Niggas puttin chrome to they dome
Goin out asshole motherfuckin backwards
To kill the frustration
Why don't you just blast her
But no, you'se a sucka
Stupid motherfucker
You'd rather let a bitch drive you dead to the gutter

[Hook X4]
Down goes another nigga
Down goes another nigga
Down goes another sucka

[BG Knocc Out]
Niggas wanna fight me over they bitch
Not knowin the bitch is a trick and she be all up on my dick
But yet he still loves her
Kisses and he hugs her
Wantin to squab with your homie over a bitch
Now thats a busta
You better recognise and realise
The fuckin facts
This some shit kicked
Fools gonna watch ya back
Your homie or that bitch
Nah that bitch is gonna break
Leave your ass stranded for dead
Cos that bitch is just a snake
If I were you and that bitch tried to play me
I would just 'buck buck', rock-a-bye baby
Bury that bitch six feet in a ditch
For tryin to sucka me
Let her know that i'mma G
And I'm stayin sucka free

[Hook X4]

[Dresta]
You better learn to be strong
Try to be a bigger figga
Instead of goin out
Damn, down goes another nigga
Catch yourself
And try to check yourself
And don't neglect yourself
Before you wreck yourself
Its gonna be a long day
You goin out the wrong way
You better pay attention
To the words that my song say
Don't be a sucka
Don't be a busta
Don't be a trick
Man, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch with the nine
If she blow your mind
Grab the AK-ray
If she wanna play games
Bitches try to date ya
Try to snake ya
Wanna take ya
Wanna try to rape ya
But its in they nature
Wake your ass up
Don't be a sucka all your life trick
Clear yourself of that bitch
She'll be upon the next dick
Killin yourself
Makes you nothin but a busta
Especially for a bitch
Damn, down goes another sucka

[Hook X5][Intro: B.G. Knocc Out]
"Haha, yeah. Orginal baby gangsta's in this, motherfucker, ha. With the D-R-motherfuckin'-E, hu. In a ... what we gonna do right now?"
(Dog catchers about to get ya)
"We serve these marks from the Dogg Pound, killa. Check it out."
(Dog catchers about to get ya)

[Verse 1]

[Dresta]
Easily I approach the microphone because I ain't no joke
Nigga tell Kurupt, Nate and Daz I'mma buck 'em
Matter of fact tell that whole Pound I say fuck 'em
It's a new year so put the bustas in their plizace
B.G. Knocc, Gangsta Dresta bring it to your fizace
Ryders on a mission
I catch you slippin'
You gettin' struck clown
So fuck any busta down with the Mutt Pound

[B.G. Knocc Out]
It's the Compton City G, nigga
Bow to your knees, nigga
Run up in your hood cock back my strap and pull the trees, nigga
And if you slippin', you know I'm gonna wet ya
I'm the baby boss hog, better known as the Dogg catcher
Bow wow, yippee yay, did you hear me say
I'm a Dogg killa, cause all Doggs have they day
Now don't run up on me, if you ain't prepared to fight
Little Knocc Out can't be phased, baby gangsta for life

[Hook x2]
Dat Nigga Daz
(killa)
Kurupt
(killa)
Dr. Dre
(killa)
Mark ass niggas
Snoop Dogg
(killa)
Nate Dogg
(killa)
Tha Dogg Pound
(killa)
Fuck, fuck all y'all, niggas

[Verse 2]

[Dresta]
I bring the noise everytime a nigga wind me up
I pull my nine and blow a mind, everytime I bust 'em
I trust no man and that's from now until infinity
Nigga you either my homie or just consider yourself my enemy
Niggas out here fake dog, like Nate Dogg
I swear you made it, but talkin' that shit to Dre
Will get you and your DJ regulated
Bitches come a dime a sack, so let's get it straight
A fake is what I hate, so fuck Kurupt, Daz and Nate

[B.G. Knocc Out]
Motherfuckin' fake
Niggas be thinkin' that they can get with the real deal
What I would do if I was you is take a chill pill
Yet and still tricks, I gave your click a pass
But when I see that busta Daz
I gotta bank his ass
Smash, down another puppy pound clown
With the round from my smith
And watch his body shift
Drift his soul in the wind as they carry you
And B.G. K-O can dig your hole before they bury you

[Bridge X2]
(Pranksters, studio gangstas, bustas)
(Softer than a bitch but portrayed the role of gangsta)
(Pranksters, studio gangstas, bustas)
Stupid motherfucker
(Yeah, that's what I'm sayin')

[Verse 3]

[B.G. Knocc Out]
So now you niggas know who in the fuck you fuckin' with
B-G and D-R-E, nigga, the baby gangsta clique
As we did some gangsta shit
From a real G's perspective
Niggas get all like pumped
While I stay calm and collective
I check those suckas
They callin' self and causin' ruckus
'94 set claimin', Snoop, D-O bangin bustas

[Dresta]
Much love to the B-G, C-P-T
Much love to the D-R-E, O-B-G
Much love to the Eazy-E, C-P-T
And D-P-G don't wanna see us, see see
You fools ain't nothin' but marks, so fuck your set
Now what's next, I doubt if you wanna flex, no respect
Run up and get wrecked
You tried to diss the B.G., although we let that shit pass
Daz you fuck around and find your ugly ass
Smashed in a trash bag, fool
You wannabe's gonna be layin' down
If you keep fuckin' around with the Compton Dogg Pound

[Hook X2][Intro: Dresta]
This how it's goin down
Yeah, hehehe
This is my motherfuckin' dedication
From the gangsta
So all you bustas better take cover
Cause I'mma drop some shit on this one

[1st Verse: Dresta]
Another day another dollar
So holler if you hear a motherfucker
D-R to the E, I'm on a mission with my brother
Down for whatever so don't ever play me close
Ain't no other motherfucker on the East or the West Coast
Ever so clear makin' noise
My diary's sincere and I'm down with the Geto Boys
So, so, a nigga better check me
And revaluate, yo, step before yo neck hit the deck
I check, I bust every day that I'm alive
I'll keep checkin' marks til the day that I die
So why, should another brother try to confess?
When a nigga from the west, fresh outta Y-T-S
Ah yes, you just didn't know what was crackin'
Thought I wasn't strappin' cause you heard me rappin'
But trick, I only do this shit for you suckers
Got me clockin' clusters talkin' about you busters

[Hook]
[B.G. Knocc Out] Nigga, it's Compton everyday allday
[Dresta] You marks can't fuck with the nigga named Dre
[B.G. Knocc Out] Nigga, it's Compton everyday allday
[Dresta] You busters can't fuck with the nigga named Dre
[B.G. Knocc Out] Nigga, it's Compton everyday allday
[Dresta] The crowd can't fuck with the nigga named Dre
[B.G. Knocc Out] Nigga, it's Compton everyday allday
[Dresta] You suckers can't fuck with the nigga named Dre

[2nd Verse: Dresta]
Now busta, its D-R-E keep it comin on
Love it when I shove it ruggish the thugish bone
I only represent the real
And even though I got a record deal
I'm a real nigga still
My homies love that and would
Know I'm a real nigga from the streets
Weren't no studios in the hood
Cause, what the fuck you tellin (You're guilty)
Well put me back in so I can chill with Jayo Felony
Give me a cell with Snoop Doggy Dogg
So I can rub my dick between that bitch sugar walls
Niggas must think I'm strugglin
But fool I got 10 points and own my damn publishing
So who the fuck should I fear?
I've been out for 2 years, got blasted but I'm still here
And now yo people stand in tears
Because they heard about Compton givin head to my peers

[Hook]

[3rd Verse: Dresta]
So now, as we approach up the ass end
Nigga give yo setup and keep yo shit blastin
Till it's fuckin wit yo eardrum
I never worry bout the next man cause nutty never feared nothin
So now it's simple and it's plain
And I wanna dedicate this to my nigga DJ Train
I feel yo presence in this room
And if ya see my cousin Gugulo tell my niggas that I'll see him soon
A nigga then blew out like a rock house
'95 Now it's all about me and the Knocc Out
So watch out cause we dropping shit like a stork
Keep shit poppin from Compton to New York nigga

[Hook]

[B.G. Knocc Out] Nigga It's Compton everyday allday
[Dresta] When I roll through your town it's the nigga named Dre
[B.G. Knocc Out] Nigga It's Compton everyday allday
[Dresta] And niggas can't fade B.G. Knocc Out and Dre[Verse 1: Dresta]
I got beat for the street
To pump in ya jeep
Or in ya caravan wit' tha homies kinda deep
Smokin' on a thai stick feelin' kinda high wit'
Ya passenger seat occupied by a fly bitch
Rollin' in your lo-lo
Cutlass, or your M-C
Slap in the hip-hop
To hell with the Temprees
Modern day gangsta from the underground, yeah
Niggas roll around wit' the boomin' ass sound
Got the 6-4 kinda low as we bouncing
On the Grapevine rollin' deep to Magic Mountain
Hoes on ya jock everytime ya hit a corner
Because ya rollin' twisted on them gold Daytonas
Frontin' on the regular, talkin' on ya cellular
Actin' like ya don't hear the little bitches yellin' ya
Name at the bus stop, ya don't stop
Ya mash on the gas, roll right by they ass
Slap Dresta in the dash, yeah

[Hook: Dresta]
Guranteed to hear some sweet, uh
Gangsta beat for the street
Guranteed to hear some sweet, yeah
Gangsta beat for the street

[Verse 2: Menajahtwa]
I got beat for the street, drop a ragtop fo'
Got my strap under the seat, just in case I have to check a ho
Menajahtwa on the scene, yeah
Rollin' through the C-P-T
Turn up the hump sounds, we groovin' to the mellow beat
Mad doggin' like bitches, hittin' me up like I'm a banger
Cause niggas can't stand to see us sittin' on some daynas
Pimpin' game on the fools, runnin' the track thinkin' ya gone
'n if the twizza I ain't tweakin', chump, we puttin' the lock on it, yeah

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Beat for the street
I love to hear it pumpin' in my lo-lo
Hittin' my switches and runnin' the bitches
And now I'm bustin' mo' hoes
Roll up to the swapmeet, hop out and hit the chirp chirp
Bail in put on some proper shorts and a proper shirt
Just clownin' cause hoes are in the house
Ridin' my dick because I got fame and my name is B.G. Knocc Out
Asking to be in my next video
Get the 7 digits, slap that ass and said "See ya, ho"
Now I'm off like a G, flee to the C-P-T
See my niggas on the block gettin' tipsy
I pulled up and start tearin' up the street
And guess what's in my motherfuckin' deck
Gangsta beat for the street

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I got beat for the street, to the beach I'll be rollin'
Never see me strollin'
40s I be holdin'
Girls in the Daisies
Drive Eazy crazy
Rolled up my windows, as I turned on my A/C
Rollin' down Crenshaw see tha hoes jockin'
Sunday night's poppin'
See the foes hoppin'
My stereos bump at that A-T-L funk
You can call it what you want
Either way that shit bumps
[Dresta: "Damn Right!"]

[Outro x4: Eazy-E]
Bein' a gangsta is so neat, yeah
Gangsta beat for the street[Intro]
Uh, yeah, uh, say what
We return
Compton, Cali
For the 9-9 (that's 2000)
Dresta Da Gangsta (Dresta)
Real as they come, bar none
Uh, say what

[Verse 1]
Let's take a quick trip back down memory lane
Follow me, as we journey on the yellow brick road to C-P-T
I see, what people think, gangstas suppose to be
Compton is where rap music learned to be a G
We had flow and everybody know
When these bitches were scared to cuss
And they were scared of us
They tried to test
But you knew that the wild wild west, wasn't scared to bust
It was all about originality
But the whole time the West Coast grind
Help me focus on the salary
It seems you eastern motherfuckers have forgot
I'm the same G that put Eazy-E back on the block
I'm real as they come
And I'm from the 1-0-1-4 South Orlean Block
Where the shit don't stop
And if your car don't hop
Then you gotta be on dubs, drop

[Hook] (x4)
We just givin' it up for Compton, California
It's such a lovely place
It's such a lovely place
We just givin' it up for Compton, California
And any time of year
You can find me here

[Verse 2]
Now I done been around the world, but I still don't see
What people talkin' about ain't shit like the C-P-T
I can float to the Bahamas, to escape all the drama
Got to come back, I miss my hoodrats and baby mamas
Smashin' on the 91, navi and a dime piece
Laid up at the Hamptons homes is where you'll find me
Jacuzzi and a camcorder, bootys and the bitch
Sometimes I like to freak dykes, in case I want to switch
Like it or not, Compton Cali back in the slot
Dresta Da Gangsta, crackling hot
You can't touch this
Let's put the C-P-T back on the map
Before I put my brownies back on the strap
I'd rather rap on the track
Since these bitches ain't seein' the light
Ruthless should have never been Tomica Wright's
Bitch, you ain't from Compton
When somebody see that ho, they need to tell her
To quit fuckin' the homie Ren, like Jerry Heller

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
For years I tried to let you know this
But the media didn't wanna let me show this
Realism I've survived of off instinct
And finally my life is startin' to feel in sync
I'm on the radio and Eazy made it possible
Dresta ain't wrong, homie, I'm only bein' logical
Studied my craft, did the math
Now I get the last laugh
No longer bang for gangs, now bang gangs for cash
Me and my dawg WC eventually bang in the room
My brother B.G. Knocc and this brother C-Toons
How can we lose
We paid our dues and made our moves
The only rappers around
Who don't got nothin' to prove
Most respected on all levels
From the club to the street, homie, y'all tell us
Is it real
I see you all makin' G's through the nation
But Compton laid the foundation

[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well it's 95 and I'm back on the scene
Now everybody wanna be on a niggas team
I blew up out the clear
Kicking flavor in your ear
Rocking shows, knocking hoes
Screaming (party over here!)
But behind the scenes
Ain't all what it seems
Motherfuckers run schemes
When it comes to the greens
So by any means
I got to do what is necessary
If I wanna become Legendary
In this game my name is the B.G
Playing with the boys then O-U-T
Nigga still down wit Eazy
But now I'm wit my big bro
Bouncing in my 6-fo'
Thought we was put in the twist but ya didn't know
That I was clocking
And bitches still jocking
The baby gangster from Compton
Cause they know it's on and popping
Nigga this is for you blind fools who
Filling pockets and groove
Fuck you and yo' jealousy
Cause niggas always talking the shit about me rapping
Talk behind my back but don't really know what's happening
Popping at the lips but ain't really saying nothing
Mad cause I got up, got out, got something

[Chorus] (x2)
Jealousy- why all these people keep on sweating me
Yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Gangsta Dresta]
I'm damned if do
I'm damned if don't
No I don't got a lot
What I got niggas want
That's the problem in the hood, it's a bitch
Niggas can't see another nigga having shit
I wanna get rich and have some chips to help my man out
But niggas say I'm tripping
Cause I don't be giving handouts
Nigga you'se a grown man you better learn some hustling
But you wanna hold hands and walk through the struggling
Now nigga please, money didn't never grow on trees
If it did you'd see the D-R-E raking leaves
So wake up, that shit is just a dream and your tripping
That's why I keep my heat on the seat when I'm dipping
Cause brothers like you and the rest of them fools
Be plotting on my crew now your dropping by two's
I hit the Hennessy and I see you strictly as the enemy
(But Dre that was the homey)
Well fool better him then me
Niggas always talking that shit about me rapping
Talk behind my back but don't really know what's happening
Popping at the lips but ain't really saying nothing
Mad cause I got up, got out, got something

[Chorus] (x2)

[Verse 3: Gangsta Dresta]
See look the homies don't be realizing real shit like this
Been broke all my life ain't nobody gave me shit
Working like a motherfucker blood sweat and tears
Never heard from my peers when I served all them years
But no love was lost when you was out rolling big time
Now I wish you player hating niggas would let me get mine
Gossip like a bitch but that bullshit is old style
Nigga I ain't got shit but a low profile

[Verse 4: B.G. Knocc Out]
Ain't a nigga like the K.O?
I rolls a 5 point 0
Occasionally I go dipping in the lo-lo
I know it's a trip and niggas can't understand it
How a nigga rolling when I used to be stranded
Damn it feels good to be a hustler
Now it's time to separate the locs from the busters
I gotta maintain because games I don't play none
That's one thing I won't do (what's that?)
Forget where I came from
Cause niggas always talking that shit about me rapping
Talk behind my back but don't really know what's happening
Popping at the lips but ain't really saying nothing
Mad cause I got up, got out, got something

[Chorus] (x4)

Jealousyyyyyy[Chorus: L.V., La Tee]
Life in the hood, (life in the hood)
Life in the hood, (yeah, just like a puzzle)
Life in the hood, (life in, life in the hood)
Life in the hood, is just like a puzzle

[Verse 1: Dresta]
It's like a jungle, sometimes when you rhyme
The hood took you under
Niggers start to wonder, why you missing all these summers
I ain't seen the streets in like five or six weeks
Cause I'm back on the cell block
Looking like I'm shell shocked
In and out, down south, up north
I'm back back, forth and forth
I can't seem to keep my black ass out of dough
Cause I'm steady doing dirt, put in work for the turf
I did a gang of killing, and still ain't learnt a damn thing
Except how to gang bang
Talk slang and shoot game
And now I think I'm the mack of the century
Cause I got this bitch running through the penitentiary
But never knowing she was hoeing in the hood, black
Till the day my homies say: "Dre that bitch a hoodrat"
But shoot the package on some nights, and I'm alright
Just another piece of the puzzle of my fucked up life

[Chorus: L.V., La Tee]
Life in the hood is just like a puzzle (like a puzzle)
If in the game, your looking for trouble (looking for trouble)

[Verse 2: BG Knocc Out]
My life is like a puzzle
I thank god for everyday I'm seeing
Living in the world cause I'm bout European
Being, a young black male is like having on
Some gasoline underwear bailing through hell
Cause we have no win that we can all see
Ask Rodney King, Michael J and Mike T
And what about OJ, I think its a set up
Pac you said it first but my nigger keep your head up
They don't wanna see another black man make it
And everything we get that look nice, they wanna take it
So make it, 187 on the po-lice
I'm tired of seeing niggers get stressed
And fucked with no grease
No peace, no justice, motherfuck this
Live BG's doing dirt out of cuttless
The three strikes march, it didn't help the situation
All it did was increase the jail population

[Chorus: L.V., La Tee]

[Break: L.V.]
Life in the hood is just like a puzzle
Life in the hood is just like a puzzle

[Verse 3: Dresta]
My homies is a piece to my puzzle
I love they ass to death
But the more I look around, there ain't too many of us left
Survival of the fittest, and the strong don't survive
I can count more real niggers dead than alive
So niggers stop the talking, let that bullshit keep walking
I'm trying to get mine, so quit wasting my time
And if I had a dime for every time I met a bitch
That I thought was the shit, my ass would be rich
But no, I'm broke, and bitches ain't a joke
Nigger you better check yo bitch, talking shit
Will get that ho smoked, (I'm down with you baby)
Bitch, don't even make a nigger start
Trying to get inside my heart
So she can tear my life apart
I already got enough strain on my brain
Than to be busy worried about some busy ass dame
But game, recognize game with the Dresta
Fool, I thought you knew about the West Side gangster

[Chorus: L.V., La Tee]Yeah, something for you trick ass niggas in 95
Ha, B.G. Knocc Out and Gangsta Dre'sta
Compton for life, fools

Chorus:
Micc Check - 1,2 - What a nigga - gon do
When the 165 Crew run upon you?
Yeah, you know you gon bow down like a bitch
Cause you niggas can't fuck with the 5 or the 6

[ B.G.]
Rolling the CPT inside my g with my mask on
Ready to catch these busters slipping so the ?doc? can blast on
They ass for shooting my homie just the other fucking day, G
They fucked up, but fuck that, them niggas now gots to pay, G
I'm heading up to the spot where they be chilling, so now I'm dipping
Oh, wouldn't you know, these niggas standing on the corner slipping
I bumped around the block and I hopped out my g so
I crept and crawled, I crawled and crept on my knees until I got close
They probably would have seen me if they wasn't so faded.
?, run upon the crowd, pulled out my gat and then I sprayed it
Niggas are running  and bailing until I watched a few ?
Broke around the corner, took off my mask and then I hopped back
Into my g, which stand on the scene before I heard the sirens
Slapped on my bitch all from the way so I can collect all my ends
Took the g and dumped it but I had to dump the strap, too
It was my only chance so I did what I had to

Chorus [2x]

[Dre'sta]
Huh, I'm sick and going asleep, wake up to sweaty sheets
Stressing from the mess and all the pressures on the streets
I wanna pack my heat everywhere a nigga step
From the thoughts that have crept about death as I slept
Sheltering my madness, dreaming about mo' killing
And never seem to wake until I see some blood spilling
Dealing with the stuff's kinda ruff on a young mind
Everybody die from criminals to one-times
If we believing everything that the ? buddy? Say
Shit, we be partying everyday
But I don't feel right, I feel angry and depressed
Cause I'm dreaming about flesh being ripped from my chest
Down goes another nigga, down goes another
Respect to my brother, Rest In Piece, Bam, I love ya
Man, it's a trip to see you gone and I'm alone
You would whoop me to carry on so I gots to be strong
If only I had knew or had a clue who really did that
I swear I'd take that and split that nigga's wig back
I hate to see some niggas do some dirt to some kin of me
Fucking loc is ?fin? To be backtracking on my enemy
Niggas know what's happening, I rolling through yo hood with my strap in my lap and
About to start blasting, you trick ass niggas

Chorus: [2x]

Micc Check - 1,2 - whatchu marks gon do?
Micc Check - 1,2 - whatchu busters gon do?
Micc Check - 1,2 - whatchu bitches gon do?
Micc Check - 1,2 - whatchu you niggas gon do?
Micc Check - 1,2 - whatchu you fools gon do?
Micc Check - 1,2 - whatchu Dogg Pound gon do?
Micc Check - 1,2 - whatchu you hoochies gon do?
Micc Check - 1,2 - whatchu niggas wanna do?I hate niggas that floss like they boss then their ass gets toss'
Gotta talkin' as a loss cause they soft
Talkin' that shit like they dogs in hogs and got balls
But in high school was taggin' on walls
Now they got c rag, he sag, he brag
Bout to ??tase?? niggas so get your punk ass some knee pads
Roll on Dre's dick, now he fucking you bitch
You better make you a switch
??He be?? jackin the tricks
Now you fucked the game up, hardcore rap singer
Wannabe a BG 93 gangbanger
Twenty years late
Now you bangin' on tapes
Niggas whooppin' that shit
But don't be bustin' a grape
Snoop whooppin' this whoopin' that
I'm a G shit, you mark ass nigga ain't nothing but a bitch
Interior gangsta, interior ho
Adds Dre's gangsta flow to let ya know
Marks gets no respect

[Hook]
This time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
This time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
Marks gets no respect
This time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers

[Dresta]
I'm real as they come

Hoes they'be respect when i come
Some try to test but now they lay to rest
Try'nna mess with the layest wicked set from the west
Side i will ride with my homies and get my cap on
Let me strap on the ?brownies? and we can get a scrap on
Pop you up, then i lay my rag on your trick ass
Disrespect yourself and get my nut to your bitch ass
Cause the dresta don't be givin' a fuck
I've be livin' it up
Bump it harder and i'll see you givin' it up
The end to the end of the road
But nigga unload and let' this 9 explode(blah blah)
Catch me if you can I'm a man and I stand strong
?????? I never planned to live long
The pimp to his ????? gotta represent, compton
165 percent. Marks get no respect!
[Hook]
[B.g Knocc Out]

[Dresta]
You gets no respect if you a busta, a mark, a trick, a punk, a mark
Bitch type nigga dirty mac into some action just simple as a busta
From my home trick trap slutBut it's a shame to use another man's name
To a ??blip?? you eat game

Motherfucker I'm disgusted
Your bitch ass can't be trusted
Cause only a bitch will tell a bitch some shit like that
I wanna get my gat
And just blast your mark ass

Nigga never scared to pull the trigga
Yourself you check

Nigga evidently, ya just don't know who ya fucking with
So I suggest get in ya shit and keep truckin', bitch
Before I get my gat ya pressure case
Blast, blast I leave my gang bang layin' on ya face
I tattoo Dre name on my chest
Cross it out just another nigga that I X-ed, huh
And you won't see R.I.P., you'll see P.N.D
A Punk nigga deceased, yeah
And the bitch that was yours will be mine, buddy
All because ya woofed on a nigga that was nutty
And I had to make an example
Nigga thinks I'm crazy now but that was just a sample
Of a nigga with street wise reality
That don't give a fuck type Compton mentality
I stare back death right in the face
Contemplate my last day on and everyday base
Cause a nigga never know when he go
I hope it only takes one shot
Cause I don't wanna die slow
My funeral will be full of my peers
People that never gave a fuck about me droppin' phony tears
I hope I'm in the casket face down
So all you motherfuckers can kiss my black ass now
And fuck all that cryin' all night
Just be happy that I'm rid of this fucked up life, yeah
And now you see you can't handle me
I give a shout to Tonel and the Ruthless fuckin' family

[Transition: Eazy-E]
Out with the old in with the motherfuckin' new. But check this shit out. I got somebody for ya, bitch. Motherfucker

[Verse 2: Sylk]
Now it's about time for the Sylk to speak
Check dat ass last weak
You off the chronic and you tweak
Speak when I feel
Cause I'm as real as they come
I'm a bitch with a gun
Never run ain't for none
So step, step up
If ya wanna test ya luck, trick
Sister like Sylk
Really don't give a fuck, bitch
Punk bitches wanna step phony speak howdy doody
I make ya self break ya self bitch you never knew me
Yours truly no longer layin' in the cut
Steady fuckin' shit up
Never see me shakin' my butt, I strut
Like a gangsta bitch, no, not a pranksta bitch
I'm quick to gank a bitch, trick
Peep game at this bitch as I shoot this
Gangsta bitch steppin' rollin' with the Ruthless

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
The R-U-T-H-L-E double S, yo, it's the nigga Knocc Out
Claim the Blocc so nigga whats next
Try to step and flex and get wrecked like a mack truck
I'm kickin', tah spittin' this funky shit to make a quick fat buck
I'm doggin' a dog you suckers can't talk about tip flip I rip shit
I'm stressin'
"Damn cuz", "Pick it back up"
Chillin' up in the studio
With the Ruthless Family
Fuck the Death Row posse
Yo, them fools can not handle me
Snoop and Andre ya come and try to fade the
Loc'ed out, Compton, original baby gangsta
1-8-7's how we do it on the west
Ya say ya shit is chronic but to me it's more like stress
Or should I say make my shit the stronic
Tha Dogg Pound don't wanna step to the atomic dog
D-O-T-K-N-O-Double-C-O-U-T so motherfucker come and fuck with me

[Transition]
Come on, come on

This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check
Ruthless motherfuckin' family ya still in effect [x3]

This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check
Ruthless motherfuckin' family ... kick that shit

[Eazy-E]
Jealousy is a motherfucker when your the man
With the upper hand I don't give a shit
Clock a grip like no other can
Wanna be like me be a G like me
But I'm the nigga that made a G
Outta the bitch D-R Eazy
I was the captain
Dre was my sidekick
Everything was cool
Til he wanted to get what I get
Any other real G, Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E
Now claimin' you a G
How does it feel to be me[Intro: Dresta (B.G. Knocc Out)]
Knock knock! (who's there?)
Well it's the gang S-T-A-sta (the gangsta who?)

[Verse 1: Dresta]
Yo, it's your brother gangsta Dresta
Open up the door so I can flow and let 'em know
That me and B.G. Knocc is good to go to make the dough
That's my little brother, that's my dawg, that's my nigga
I'm the big brother cause I'm older and I'm bigger
Here to clock the ends and hit the skins on the daily
My little brother B.G. Knocc he drives the girlies crazy
Close like buddies but yo he mo' than my brother
We got two others and C. C. is our mother
Grew up in Compton and the bootys on the west side
Used to live in the east side but we chose the best side
Had it kinda rough but that only made us tough
We don't take much stuff, we kick up 'nough dust
Trust no ho, or no man, shit can't even trust each other
And even though I love her, it's hard for me to trust my mother
And that's just the way we was raised back in the days
Me, myself and I from the cradle to the grave
Never had a daddy, damn right, I'm a bastard
Momma was my daddy because daddy wasn't a factor
Don't feel bad because I don't need a dad
It's like this, I can't miss what I never had

[Hook: Dresta (B.G. Knocc Out)]
So niggady-Knocc can you come and wreck the set? (Yes!)
So, won't you grab the microphone and flex next? (Yes!)

[Verse 2: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well it's the niggady Knocc ready to pop like a Glock
With my brother D-R-E and we back on the block
As these funky cluck hoes fuck all on the duck
But for now my time is taken, so bitch you gets naythin
Microphone check, hit the deck, if you can't take the heat
Original baby gangsta's straight from the street
With the beat that'll bump in the trunk of your shit
So nigga bump this and I bet you bump a bitch
With the quickness cos I'm quick to kick some dope shit
K-N-O-double C-O-U-T will always make a hit
And we'll never flip flop, always keep it hip hop
A nigga dissin' on my bro, watch him fall like a drip drop
From the faucet, show me the mic and watch me toss it
And kick some derranged shit to make you think I've lost it
Ah shit, I'm ready to rock I'm ready to roll and rock
So give a nigga some room before I tick and I tock
And explode like a bomb with the mic within my palm
Won't you take a walk with me through the Compton Vietnam
And let me show ya, fools much bolder
A busta is a punk compared to a fuckin soldier
Act like you know, I'm a pro with a hell of a flow
Kickidy K to the O, ain't no motherfuckin joke, so
Step to a loc and prepared to get smoked
By me and my motherfuckin big bro

[Hook: Dresta (B.G. Knocc Out)]
So niggady-Knocc can you come and wreck the set? (Yes!)
So, won't you grab the microphone and flex next? (Yes!)

[Verse 3: Dresta]
Well here I am, once again it's the Dresta
Straight outta Compton, original baby gangsta
Quick to grab the microphone and come and start some conflict
Never seen a convict, come and drop the bomb shit
Take a good look because your lookin at a crook
My life done been took, right outta Donald Owens book
See I did the crime so I did the time
But now I'm back out, packin my nine
Scoopin up girls with the the swiftness
And if its possible to stick 'em with the quickness, I'm with this
I'll really don't need a girl but I do need a friend
To give me some love, slap on the girlfriend hit the skins
Packin the ends, payin' the bills with my skills
Never hesitate to tell somebody how I feel
Me and my brother Knocc be doin damage in the 90's
I was down straight from '88 up to '93
That was like 5 years my little brother didn't have big bro
Around to help lead him down the right path
But I'm back out and we tighter than we've ever been
Tryin' to make some ends so we can go where we never been

[Hook: Dresta (B.G. Knocc Out)]
So niggady-Knocc can you come and wreck the set? (Yes!)
So, won't you grab the microphone and flex next? (Yes!)

[Verse 4]

[Verse 4: Dresta (B.G. Knocc Out)]
[Me and my nigga Knocc Out
(We'll sock out a fool with no hesitation)
And split him up like segregation
(So when you stepping, you testing your luck)
Yeah, fool and with nutter get your ass fucked up
(So stay off the diznick, you little triznick)
Knoccie niznick hit his ass with the pipe
(Dre catch him with the right)
Yeah, I'm a dog but I don't bark

[B.G. Knocc Out / Dresta]
We take a punk nigga to a park, bust caps in the mark
Knocc and Dre here we go again, with the flow again
From the West Side, C-O-M-P-T-O-N
Compton, Compton is what niggas yelling
And hoes on my diznick every time we belling
Question after another, yo, we got the same mother
Bitch, so we real brothers[Intro]
Comp-ton, Comp-ton, Comp-ton
Real muthaphuckkin G's

[Verse 1: Eazy-E (Dresta)]
Hey yo Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
So you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about playin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre, motherfuck Snoop, motherfuck Death Row
Yo, and here comes my left blow
Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid you found a pup and now you're dapper
But tell me where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper
Talkin' bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his old album cover he was a she-thang
So nigga please, nigga please, don't step to deez
Motherfuckin' real G's

[Cuts] (x2)
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up
Boy you should have known by now

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Everyday it's a new rapper, claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the, nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard, is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness, to your fuckin' work
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me, knowing that they pranksters
This is going out to you studio gangstas
See I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talking about they come from projects
Knowing you ain't seen the parts of the streets G
Think you started trying to bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearing khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag, tried to sag, but you're flooding at the same time
And your set don't accept ya
Scared to kick it with your homies cause you know they don't respect ya
So nigga please, check nuts before ya step to these
Motherfuckin real G's

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition original baby gangsta
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker I'mma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
Cause if you do, then a pealed cap is all that would be left
See young niggas like me will break you off something
Claiming my city but, Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real motherfuckin G's

[Cuts]

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now nigga it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg, think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches, can come and suck my Doggy dick
Beating up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick, to smoking on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothing but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you're getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real motherfuckin G's

[Cuts]

[Outro]
Boy you should have known by now: Eazy Duz It
