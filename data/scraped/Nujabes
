[Verse 1: Cise Starr]
Light as a feather when I'm floating through
Reading through the daily news
Measuring the hurt within the golden rule
Centimetres of ether, I'm heating the speaker
Motivational teacher with words that burn people
Seeing the headlines lined with discord
It's either genocide or the planet in uproar
Never good.  The rules of paradise are never nice
The best laid plans of Mice and Men are never right
I'm just a Vagabond with Flowers for Algernon
The Average Joe who knows what the fuck is going on
It's the hope of my thoughts that I travel upon
Fly like an arrow of God until I'm gone, so I'm

[Hook: Cise Starr]
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to the something that is greater, so I'm
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to the something that is greater

[Verse 2: Akin]
Taking chances, word tap dancing with wolves
In an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of
Arizona, the sun be high, life's ironic
Ain't trying to be Dal√≠ when I write
Surreal life I paint it
Vivid, habitat crazy insane
Watch the propaganda six o'clock that are saying
Cultures clash, for black folk and white trash
They revel in the cyberspace that might crash, dash
To millennium a million miles of running
At the speed of now back, don't return gunning
Rambo style, gung ho child gunning
Ammo blao two times loud stunning
Stunning, when I hit ya, lift you off the Earth like
Ayo, take you right back to birth and
Niggas wonder why, they might wonder why
This shit might happen but it does, they go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cise Starr]
Treat you better than me, cause that's the heavenly key
To unlock the inner strength where my essence will be
It's the knowledge of self, understanding of the things around me
That becomes the wisdom that I need
Living this life to the best of my ability
Channeling energy to my thoughts into your symmetry
Remember me, because my prose remain gold
I got the gift of gab like them pimps in Kangol
It never ends, I keep it ruling like a cypher
The first caveman bringing fire
Innovating and higher; to blast mistakes I raise the stakes
It's double or nothing in this vaccuumless space
I will, survive, divine the time to cry
Fuck a hold or hide, I'm alive with pride
And I drove the Chevy to the Levy
But the Levy was dry, singing "This will be the day that I die"[Intro: Bill Cosby]
I told you that story to tell you this one

[Verse 1: Shing02]
Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
Developing this new theory of relativity
Connecting our souls resting in captivity
Positive life sacrifice what it is to me
Our history, only a quarter of a century
Reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
See ain't no mystery, the colors that we mix will set the mind free
Let the blind see beyond harmony!
Breathe life into dead space blow away clouds of doubt
New territory we determine to be
Everything a safe haven it's supposed to be
Now it might seem distant but the time is near
When our thoughts take off and split the atmosphere
Pure sound wave travel semi-infinitely
Plus I'll see you there utmost definitely

[Hook]
Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
Cause your beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Good gracious, every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation
God bless this opportunity for me to find a voice
For some words that have waited for way too long
Low wages, Small tips on the avenue
Never wasted, all hits for a revenue
Haven't you heard the news lately?
Seems we've been living for some time in a purgatory
But yo, I thought I knew what a love song sound like
But I felt a warmer tune in the sunlight
I could still hear it in my room past midnight
Gotta move, take a solo cruise in the moon light
Sometimes I do forget, Oh how much we could ease the lives we lead
If we learn to let go, the reins that we hold
Return to our souls, and the spirit let flow
So you see, upon everyday faced there's a million shades to
Express definition of grace
But the method I choose my prerogative
There's so much love in me I got to give

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shing02]
Oh how I could write a book on how you make me feel
But how about this song that I wrote for you?
What I feel like...I wanna put my trusts in these simple words
For you to feel what I'm saying, what you feel like?
Reminisce about the little episodes that we shared together
Remember the time that you told me
In the cold night, to relax when all I knew was to hold tight
Remember the time that I spoke to the crowd in a full house and
Realizes that you was my ace?
I was the joker on the stage singing the blues
All eyes on me and had nothing to prove
But yo, I thought I knew what a diamond shine like
But I felt a sharper love in the limelight
From the queen of hearts watching me quietly from the upper deck balcony
Sometimes I do suspect, I'm an actor in a well-scripted live divine comedy
When I look back, that frozen slice of time and try to defrost the senses lost
Now enough with the metaphors, the motivation that I wrote this letter for
For you to know that the music helps carry on
Like you say a new day will bring us tomorrow...

[Hook: x2]
Cause my beat plus your melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
Cause your beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently

Cause your beat plus my melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
Cause your beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently[Verse 1: Shing02]
Sharp like an edge of a samurai sword
The mental blade cut through flesh and bone
Though my mind's at peace, the world out of order
Missing the inner heat, life gets colder
Oh yes, I have to find my path
No less, walk on earth, water, and fire
The elements compose a magnum opus
My modus is operandi is amalgam
Steel packed tight in microchip
On my arm a sign of all-pro
The ultimate reward is honor, not awards
At odds with the times in wars with no lords

A freelancer
A battle cry of a hawk make a dove fly and a tear dry
Wonder why a lone wolf don't run with a klan
Only trust your instincts and be one with the plan

[Hook]
Some days, some nights
Some live, some die
In the way of the samurai
Some fight, some bleed
Sun up to sun down
The sons of a battlecry

Some days, some nights
Some live, some die
In the way of the samurai
Some fight, some bleed
Sun up to sun down
The sons of a battlecry

[Verse 2]
Look, just the air around him
An aura surrounding the heir apparent
He might be a peasant but shine like grand royalty
He to the people and land, loyalty
We witness above all to hear this
Sea sickness in the ocean of wickedness
Set sail to the sun set no second guessing

Far east style with the spirit of wild west
The "quote-unquote" code stands the test of
Time for the chosen ones to find the best of
Noble minds that ever graced the face of
A hemisphere with no fear, fly over

The blue yonder where
The sky meets the sea
And eye meets no eye
And boy meets world
And became a man to serve the world
To save the day, the night, and the girl too

[Hook][Hook: Shing02 (x2)]
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are

[Verse 1: Shing02]
Like a movie that you can't predict
Like a book that you can't resist
I sing along a song that's oh so sensual
Bring along a sip to make it all so sexual
Verbally that is, making love to the music means vibing to the beat at night
With the whole city fast asleep, out cold
True words seem to rise to the lips, take hold
Of a poet in me, most powerfully
I feel free when the world doesn't owe it to me
It's so hard to find a gig that lives up to the billing
Trying to find a reason to work, god willing
I admit, my thinking is wishful
Like a star upon a child gazing up to the ceiling
How far do we have to stretch the truth
To fit the lifestyles borrowed and overdue?
We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite
Throw on your favorite reel that's good to go
On the analog player watch the people glow
Sit back to the breeze let the memories flow
Comedy tragedy all the highs and lows

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Like your moves that I can't predict
Like your look that I can't resist
The ting-a-ling feeling was oh so mutual
The lingering appeal was so unusual
Herbally what is, medicine to a lone soul can become poison to some
With the whole body fast asleep, out cold
True vision seem to come to the eye, take hold
Of a prophet in me most visibly
I see clear when the world doesn't show it to me
It's so hard to make sense in a cycle of billing
Trying to find a reason to quit and make a killing
I admit, our dealing is painful
Like a star upon a child staring down from the ceiling
How far do we have to stretch the picture
Before pixelating the human texture?
We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's save it all up for an ultimate prize
Homecoming gathering with a big surprise
Throw on your favorite record that's good to go
On the analog table and it's hooked to blow
Sit back with ease and hear the emcee flow
Hi hat kick drum all the highs and lows

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shing02]
Um, third time's the charm, hopefully
When I chime on your door you'd still let me in
After all these years
The room that you caved in my heart is exactly the same as you left it
I realize that you have moved on
New styles and cliques like them silent flicks
I'm speechless in this golden occasion
The beautiful expression on the silver creation
This time I'd like to keep in touch
I'm a little bit wiser, a whole lot tougher
If I suffer through another nightmare tonight
We'll chalk it up as another chapter to write, all right?
Or wrong or somewhere down the middle of the road
I wanna see you again in a scene with the backdrop a perfect ten
And the music can take us back to the spot right then
From black and white to a sepia tone
Some dreams come with a tint or in monochrome
From black and white to my skin tone
Some dreams have a stint on the microphone

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Shing02]
Okay we can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite
Throw on your favorite jacket and you're good to roll
On the analog trail and you look the role
Just stroll through the trees and let your miseries go
Sunshine hurricane all the highs and lows

We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite[Verse 1: Shing02]
Once again, now where do I start, dear love
Dumb struck with the pure luck to find you here
Every morn' I awake from a cavernous night
Sometimes still pondering the previous plight
Seems life done changed long time no speak
Nowadays I often forget the day of the week
Taking it by stride if you know what I mean
No harm done, no offense taken by me
So let's rap, we'll catch up to par, what's the haps? Perhaps we're even closer
Now after, all things considered on this side of the planet
Couldn't pick a better time even if we planned it
To come clean and candid if I have to
Oh what I wouldn't trade for your laughter
Sweet and sour spice in my poetry pot melting
Even better than the real thing
It's like the God in me saw the devil in you
I wanted to break myself in the worst way when I met you
Who would have thought, conversate by the river, celebrate birth
Sit and delivered the lines that would prove to be the seeds of trust
Unsigned, yeah but destined to grow with sunshine
Self-assigned task piled on the desk of good works
Knowing hardship appreciate the best of both worlds

Chorus
C'est la vie, as they say L-O-V-E evidently, see every song has a sequel
Never same, everything but the name, all fresh just like back then, how we do everyday
C'est la vie, as they say L-O-V-E eloquently, see every dream has a part two
Never same, you got to keep it tight, always just like back then, now hear me out

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Once together, now where do we go, dear divine
I pray that you keep watching over us
From the heavens where light is the nucleus
To this space filled with darkness and negative matter
Anti-gravity pull is what I would rather, feel when I leave this shell eventually
Ties to the mother earth ground me mentally
Real vibes will keep me alive spiritually
Imagination brings bliss at no cost, when I blink blink I receive at no loss
Victory comes in small packages like a leaf of an olive tree brought back by a dove
From above, then I'm gonna rhyme love
Well you saw that one coming ever since the beginning of the end
Well anyways, I am not a perfect being, yes I am, a man full of S-I-N
It's like the devil in me saw the God in you
You epitomize the etymology of enthusiasm
Look it, up there lies the clouds that form the rain
That came from the ocean that flowed from the river
I'm a believer, firm with the first words, lyrical transceiver of our ancient roots
Science plus Arts multiplied by Faith then divided by the number of our ethnic race
Let me mention what I've been thinking
How to save the children, when the ship is sinking
So I'm singing, no lip syncing to slogans
Political hooligans with tanks, missiles and guns
Everything is relative when it's all in the family of man
Understand the time has finally come to realize the great power of one
All formulas equalize under the Sun, amen

[Bridge]
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Your vibe surely brings out the best in me
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
All good souls lost may they rest in peace


[Bridge]
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Your vibe surely brings out the best in me
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Hip-hop world wide we got to live in peace, like that[Verse 1 ‚Äì Cise Star]
Crush a coal to a diamond, eyes forever shining
Your beauty alone inspire a nigga to rhyming
Thinking of the better things in life
Thinking of how I could persuade you to become my wife
Hand in hand as we floating over tropical sands
You my lady, I'm ya man
So let's further advance to the next scene
Me sleeping next to you resting
You the personification of all God's blessings
Coming to me in just one physical being
One physical dream that I wanna redeem
You're Voluptuous, sweet, caramel-brown honeydew
Satin skin smooth to the touch, what a nigga do
So sensual
Her smile like a chemical extract of perfection, rare mineral
She smell like a happy birthday on a Thursday
Quiet time, love, sleep in, I wake early

[Hook ‚Äì Cise Star]
Honey brown with the long, black hair
Teasing me with a kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare

[Verse 2 ‚Äì Cise Star]
She's angelic and energetic, using sex as a weapon
I reckon that I'm confessing her body is just a blessing
From God down to Earth‚Äîshe needs to be in a church
To prove we didn't spawn from fish, but God's work
Hurts to see her clothed ‚Äòcause her body beholds
Secrets untold, valued like platinum and gold
For she is the key to open my mind to see
The energy that radiates from the gates of heavenly
Bliss.  I reminisce over touch and a kiss
While you fucking a bitch, I go make love to my miss
Never scandalous, it's unanimous that the hue will handle it
Lights off and candle-lit rooms and glamorous
Yo, I call you love, sexual‚Äîyou look edible
Parallel, snuggle up close, intellectual
In a rendezvous, who is you in wrap hairdo
No makeup in jean shorts, open-toe shoe
I wanna hold you, mold ya soul, I behold you
Know you better than myself, never own you
But keep you, never leave you, I beseech you
God's gift to man is you wearin' a see-through
Riding Sea-Doos in Atlantic Ocean, causing commotion
Lay you down, going through the motions
Keep ya skin soft, lotions got me coasting
Down, pretty, round, brown thighs, the candles low-lit

[Hook ‚Äì Cise Star]
Honey brown with the long, black hair
Teasing me with a kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare

[Verse 3 ‚Äì Cise Star]
Look at this agreeable, delightful, delectable
Unforgettable, so sweet she may be edible
She needs a pedestal to step out of heaven‚Äîyou ready, boo?
Never hypothetical, you factual and magical
Fuck theatrical, baby girl, because you actual
Physically, your chemistry is so mathematical
Had to use academics to define your spirit
You lifting my limits, your name off my tongue is a lyric
She's a compilation of my mind‚Äôs representation
Of a representative representing an excellent revelation
Of time and dedication (she will).  Never impatient (for real)
She know the deal (reveal) herself to me
So I can see her heavenly ways, her heavenly gaze
And, plus, it don't hurt that she has an ass for days
So as we lay, I reminisce on the day that we met
Please, God, never let me forget[Hook]
Snow flakes in January
Heart warm like February
I wouldn't ordinarily
March to the drum, play a fool like April
May the best dance in a Juno bridal
Power of the will, Julius and Augustus
Aw you know, it's just us
In a new semester, back in September
Boy, I wonder if you still remember

[Verse 1: shing02]
Meet me half way from mars to venus
Beep beep, the chase is on between us
Retweet the sweetest piece of confection
Hand made device for remote connection
Ask a question
Wait for an answer and make a suggestion
A time and a place for a first impression
Second and third to a fourth dimension
Rise above the weights that hold us captive
To a square, swear that I, I the captain to
Cruise in sci-fi, red sky burn like sapphire
A moth to a fire, but we can fly higher
Till we reach an apex
We fit tight like a glove with the latex
Bring it down to earth for a cooling session
Laying sideways and glazed in essence
Gazed each other in the eye to find galaxies of
Uncharted nebulas
Heard joy over spilled milk on a quilt, of lavender
Woven in the fabric of our calendar
Dress up at the end of October
Give thanks to the fam in November
A cold but cozy December
And we're back to the origin, so let me begin

[Hook]

[Verse 2: shing02]
When you took my hand, I couldn't hide it
Way too delighted
Tried to ride it cool but obliged to write it
Wouldn't fight it, how my watch paused
When I put my lips on your eyelids
The lost second, deposit in a memory bank
Every chance I pocketed a cent
A blank check with ya signature
Font sans serif, the curvature, a lone harbinger
With toys play coy like fish in a pond
Fond words serve poems like dish
Life is short like a doggone leash
Or a fuse in an open circuitry
That got struck by lightning
Hang a painting on the wall over the writing
Brighten up the room for a private dining
Increase the peace and cease the anxiety
Spread love and cc: the whole society
You got me shooting off on a tangent
Like I always do when I'm on the fringe
And the tally of the letters will reach
The valley where the wings will seek
A series so classic at the top of October
Give thanks to the fam in November
A cold but cozy December
And we're back to the origin, so let me begin

[Hook][HOOK]
There ain't no happy endings, cause nothing really ends
When your life is over, another begins
And that's the way it works in the circle of life
Balancing those good days with the times of strife

There ain't no happy endings, cause nothing really ends
When this life is over, another begins
And that's the way it works in the circle of life
Balancing these good days in these times of strife

[VERSE 1: Substantial]

I'm just trying to make it
Life's precious for granted I'll never take it
Every breath I breathe to me is sacred
Back when I was young, my only love was football and my mama
Learn to use curse words before I ever used a comma
Little bad ass
All I liked in school was gym and art class
Life's changin', I was age ten when my pop past
His love for cancer sticks and alcohol prove to be tragic
My fam's seen it all we became immune to havoc
My lyrics is satisfaction to those who use to be addicts
Soothin' the beast within all those who use to be savage
I advocate the acronym F.U.B.U. speak to
As if my tongue was tatooed with the word uhuru
Using my freestyle to emancipate mind states
Fuck 21, I'd like to live to see 9-8
But this world's got me going bananas like a primate
People you thought you knew full of surprises like a blind date
And I hate
Cash flashing niggas with a passion
More to life than dollars and rockin' the latest fashion
Seems like we either wanna play ball or be assassins
While children go to bed to lullabies of guns blastin'
No matter the weather
I'm striving to make it better
But my motto is a contradiction "Never say never!"
I will not
I remain poetic like Gil Scott
So stand up, get up
My people keep your head up!

[BRIDGE]
And live everyday like it's your last
Cause life only get harder as time goes past
And yo, the sun might not come out tomorrow
Don't let your life end in sorrow

That's why you live everyday like it's your last
Cause life only get harder as time go past
And yo, the sun might not come out tomorrow
Don't let your life end in sorrow

-HOOK-

[VERSE 2: Substantial]

I try to live day by day without a fear or a worry
It's no time to waste I make moves in a hurry
Used to be so clear now my vision's getting blurry
Streets is hotter than Tabasco sauce on chicken curry
Bullets fly from guns with no target in particular
Fatally hittin' ya
Leavin' bodies perpendicular
To those still existin'
Silencers hissin'
Piercin' the darkness
Bringin' forth another carcass
Total bedlam, swear these streets is infested
Filled with the many horrors that the devil manifested
Children molested
Nuclear weapons being tested
Somehow I avoided being shot or arrested
Brothers tried to bring it to me
Send slugs through me
Almost was bodied thrice back when I was just a juvy
Hard to deal thought about putting one in my own temple
Permanent scars on my physical and my mental
Sometimes I'm glad my niece is no longer around to see this
Not a trace of unity society's in pieces
Liquor spattered on concrete to mourn those that we miss
Watch day and night, controlled by unseen leashes
Watch day and night, controlled by unseen leashes
Watch day and night, controlled by unseen leashes

Yo, but no matter what...
You know something?
This is what you gotta do...

Ascending to another place in time ‚Äì I place my rhymes
Up in the face of time I‚Äôm outer space tonight
I‚Äôm out of space in my notebook
Pace of my heart got me feeling like I‚Äôm caged in the dark
Yea I smoke good toke like an eighth a day I‚Äôm feeling great today
I take the pain away the paint I spray on canvas the cannabis
Got me leveled like I‚Äôm building seven
I just vanish - atlantis
The man with plan is not God so I exit out this planet
Implant my dreams what if I can‚Äôt it seems that I am damned to be
Another number in equations that equating to a fantasy
The women, cash, and beem-ers to drive in while I drive in a spaceship
And exiting out the matrix the artificial made this the population racist
To operate the maze they lost in
They tossed in they souls cause that‚Äôs what it cost them
That's what the cost is

[Verse 2]
What‚Äôs the point of life - mine‚Äôs
The pencil while I write - I‚Äôm
Feeling so enlightened when I write rhymes out of my right mind
I‚Äôm righteous but I light spliff‚Äôs with the devil ‚Äì rebel angel
Changing from an angle ‚Äì look at this perspective
Damn it‚Äôs really painful ‚Äì this is for the nexus
This is what I‚Äôm left with death or a check for 2 mil I‚Äôm to ill
Should of picked the blue pill
Now I‚Äôm in the blues feeling to real ‚Äì is it
Reality and fiction clashing together it‚Äôs causing friction
Hash on the table I‚Äôm pretty lifted
Cash on the table I‚Äôm pretty blessed yet
I stress like every single day bout the grave situations that I face
Never take a breath when I blaze dope or spray flows around the rainbow
I‚Äôm thankful for every little thing that I came for[Verse 1: Shing02]

Joint sound hittin' now freestyle or written down
Ya' flow is played out money you need to get that shit in styleSubstantial:
Each one, teach one we reachin
Maryland and Cincinatti to the far east son
And we just begun to spread the gospel
Substantial, Pase Rock, hip hop apostles
Far from preachin with this art you call rappin
Takin y'all back to before this all happened
Frontin hardcore when you barely soft porn
Never penetratin the inner to get your heart warm
Rock on, at the ridiculous pace
Disrepect hip hop and I'll spit in your face
These kids are a waste of oxygen, it's madness
Get in your case, and all your shit, like back checks
Got my eye on ya, like insanity grabbed ya
Y'all CD packagin, and I can't stand rappers
You're bound to get ripped,  then turned into garbage
I stay blessin mics, my followers pay homage

(Chorus x2:)
Both:
Substan, blessin it
Yes I am, blessin it
UV for life, hell yes we stay blessin it
Pase I'm, blessin it
Yes I stay blessin it
Five Deez forever you know we stay blessin it

Pase Rock:
On point like the pens we write with
Livin righteous, in these times of peril and crisis
The pain'll squeeze you lifeless, dead, what's the matter who's the nicest
Who's alive, who's gonna live to see their life
Hopefully me, my lifeline a MC
Extends past paying dues how much it cost to be free
Deep-rooted underground, but on the surface a tree
Branchin out, all I ever really wanted to be
They want to put us in a box, and then pack it away
But we ain't havin that, no pause, no which way
Yo I'm goin to the top and that's where I stay
Fuck the middle ground, cold gettin biz while you was sittin down
The joint sound hittin now, freestyle'a written down
Your flow's played out money you need to get that shit a style
Speedy on the quick fast, long term we make it last
Forever and a day stay clear on the path cuz yo

(Chorus)

Substantial:
Children of the sun look out here we come
Live in Brooklyn, Maryland's where I'm from
And we don't stop, 'til you've had enough
Five Deez, UV, connect that's what's up

Pase Rock:
Children of the sun watch out we comin for ya
Rockin from the 'natti mid-west to California
And we don't stop even when you've had enough
Pase and Substantial dude that's what's up

Substantial:
Blessin it, effortless
Testin this, doubt it
Mic specialist son, we kept events crowded
As nice as you wish you were
Ripped mics are my signature
I thought you said this shit is hot
It's barely room temperature

Pase Rock:
We scorchin, we torturing cats from Cincinatti to New York
And back, word to Pat, don't say jack
When we bankrupt your crew from spinnin the wheel of fortune, black
We take you there and send you walkin back

Finn: ‚ÄúDude‚Ä¶I think I have a crush!"

[Sample]
Hair piled up, piled up high
Your hair piled up, piled up high

[Verse 1]
I see your face, stress starts to erase
Just like the fear and the cold and the hate
I guess feelings are starting to shape
And for once I don't want to escape
I'd much rather embrace, smell the flowers
Wrap the moon and stars around us, make the night ours
Can't you feel the power?
Every single part of you is the opposite of sour
Cause you're sweet from the head to the feetsies
And I love the way that you greet me
I know it's weak see, how these words defeat me
But I'm so completely lost in you, lost in the thought
That for once in my life my heart might go soft
And stop this manic damage that got me up in panics
Erupting with life like volcanic organic
Well let's make this last
We're accustomed to the custom that time moves too fast
Living no fear and no consequence
Looking at the change, hope that it makes sense
This is the minute and second where we own it
Let's get lost in the moment
No time for opponents
Let's just bask in the moment

[Sample]
You‚Äôre a flower, you‚Äôre a river, you‚Äôre a rainbow
You‚Äôre a flower, you‚Äôre a river, you‚Äôre a rainbow

[Verse 2]
At home inside the gaze of your eyes
Allowing someone to take a look inside
And calm washes over, turning watches over
Drunk off affection like I'm not sober
Finally dear I'm clearly
On my own for the first time nearly
I'll admit I'm smitten by the mystery
I live inside lines of unwritten history
But ink is written, me on my scribe shit
I'm grooving to these raps, I really hope you vibe with me
I think you're one of a kind
I think I'm on your mind, I think I'm on my mind
It's like, ‚ÄúGirl do you mind if I repeat that line?"
And if you wanna slow it down I'm like, ‚ÄúYeah, that's fine"
No cut me off
I'm done with brushing off, I'm brushing up
I think you caught me blushing, cause I think you're cool and stuff
The feeling's resounding, the interest's compounding
By my account it's astounding
How the whole feeling inside‚Äôs just building like mountains
And hey it‚Äôs building like mountains
And no I can't move those
But I'll try to make you move if I can get you close

[Sample]
You‚Äôre a flower, you‚Äôre a river, you‚Äôre a rainbow
You‚Äôre a flower, you‚Äôre a river, you‚Äôre a rainbow[Verse 1: Pase Rock]
Always in trouble need love on the double spent cake
And a lifetime climbing to the level
Contract with the devil loopholed expiration date
On the side of good people always set the record straight
Round and round the piano keys meditate
Felt in the music need it now can't let it wait
Not a secret everything is all out and exposed
It's going down like the water in the river flows
How it goes another day another story told
Stuck inside the puzzle searching still trying to get a hold
Forgotten souls got lost in the cold trying
To get freedom now they need 'em walking down to hope road
Said they hope so but it was a no go
Front row stage show well placed logo
Fancy lights and the cameras are on
But he don't care he's just there to sing another sad love song

[Hook: Pase Rock]
Fade to black the soundtrack to another night
The music of the rain and the city lights
Feel no pain it makes the whole city bright
Without the sparkle or hype it's just another night

[Verse 2]

(Pase Rock)
And they all knew what it was from the first glance
No excuses should've planned in advance man

(Substabtial)
Documented on ProTools or Tascam
Struggles & hustles of an ordinary black man

(pase rock)
Spin a record with two week life span
Can't find a good girl so we hug the mic stand

(Substantial)
Not a lot of paper left in his right hand
Making enemies of folks he treated like fam

(pase rock)
Stone cold solid rock every point stop
What you lean on soon as the pressure drops

(Substantial)
Ghetto hot
Know the ledge and you'll hear the shot
But he'll never stop
'Til his name's known on every block

(pase rock)
Spread my wings fly away to the night beat
He's wide awake while the rest of the city sleeps

(Substantial)
In these gritty streets
Dudes creep with plenty heat
Pay it no mind and we grind losing plenty sleep

[Verse 3: Substantial]
Yo... Yo...
Some play for keeps while you laid asleep
In the dark your worst nightmare waits for he
Anything discern, no dawn or despair
Air's crisp and calm I think a storm is near
And I'm watching lightning dance across the skyline
Usually miss it, rarely find time
To bask in blackness, hint of line shine
But in a jazz pub chilling, sippin with fine wine
Hypnotize by the strum of the upright
Feel like lost souls got their eyes on me some nights
So keep my eyes wide and move cautious
Slip and find yourself in a brand new coffin
By the morning...
Now you're the one with the night breed
You should've known better if you're anything like me
But the city lights will seduce you
Daywalkers beware if it's not what you're used to[Intro]
Yo, DiLa Omega ! J'vaux 800 MC t'entends ?

[Couplet - DiLaDeMiLuNe]
Une grosse dope c'est pour tous mes, tous mes tout mes gars

[Outro - DJ Haz]
Scratch SessionHey yo step back, my voice hit the track
Consist is back putting HAC on the map
And it‚Äôs about that time to come correct with the rhyme
Get your feathers and climb to make the ladies feel fine
We shine like sunlight and make the beat run right
Making you rock like you only got one life
Left to feel this, stepping with the realness
We deal this now it‚Äôs all about the illness
Half-stepping, never that, we roll properly
A couple hundred bucks past go just like Monopoly
We full flash working this game like professionals
Lyrically put me to work, my feet sessional
I got you open while you digest my sound
Bugging out while you watch my record spin around
You love the way that it sound well go buy it
Think about biting my style? Don‚Äôt even try it

What you trying me for?
Yo kid it ain‚Äôt worth it
What you trying me for?
Because my rhyme style‚Äôs perfect
What you trying me for?
You ain‚Äôt going nowhere with that
So don‚Äôt try it, ain‚Äôt nobody hearing that

So don‚Äôt try it cause nobody‚Äôs hearing that
And don‚Äôt try it, we don‚Äôt like you weak cats
And don‚Äôt try it, it‚Äôs getting hard for you to beat this
It wasn‚Äôt worth it cause I figured out your weakness

Who‚Äôs up next? Who want to test and make me get vexed?
Who wants to test ST while he be on decks?
You know we make people bounce like out-of-date cheques
And take a step back like getting back with your ex
East London sound, incorporate the jazz step
You wanna front son? You‚Äôre walking on your last step
Wickedly shifty, it make your crew say
You put my tape inside your box, I‚Äôll make you press play
Erasing cats with their raps when he pass through
Just so long as they never ever diss the class crew
They have to show the most respect for DNAQ
We always giving out the love and never hate you
We never ever came to do this on some quick shh
But when we do you know we guaranteed to rip shh
We make the loud rap cats stay quiet
Think about stepping to D? Don‚Äôt even try it

What you trying me for?
Yo kid it ain‚Äôt worth it
What you trying me for?
Because my rhyme style‚Äôs perfect
What you trying me for?
You ain‚Äôt going nowhere with that
So don‚Äôt try it, ain‚Äôt nobody hearing that

So don‚Äôt try it cause nobody‚Äôs hearing that
And don‚Äôt try it, we don‚Äôt like you weak cats
And don‚Äôt try it, it‚Äôs getting hard for you to beat this
It wasn‚Äôt worth it cause I figured out your weakness

Yo this be my last verse, the verse to be the free throw
Ey yo we breezing right through like when the wind blows
But when the kick drum pump we break your windows
You know when shit gets played just like Nintendos
Big up my man Nujabes we make the beat knock
Big up to Strumfield, Dela, and Pete Rock
I got my style on lock just like a cellblock
Cause when I ride on beats I make your legs shocked
It‚Äôs hip hop nonstop, we elevating this
So many cats out there will be relating this
Debating this but yo we on a love vibe
Making you jump to this, we on a club vibe
Turn this music right up, I need to hear this
Lyrically as an MC, DL‚Äôs fearless
Maintaining myself to start a riot
Think about taking me out? Don‚Äôt even try it

What you trying me for?
Yo kid it ain‚Äôt worth it
What you trying me for?
Because my rhyme style‚Äôs perfect
What you trying me for?
You ain‚Äôt going nowhere with that
So don‚Äôt try it, ain‚Äôt nobody hearing that

So don‚Äôt try it cause nobody‚Äôs hearing that
And don‚Äôt try it, we don‚Äôt like you weak cats
And don‚Äôt try it, it‚Äôs getting hard for you to beat this
It wasn‚Äôt worth it cause I figured out your weakness[Beyonce Talking]
Delivery me from mine enemies, O God
Defend me from those that rise up against me
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity
And save me from the bloody men

[Verse 1]
I got too much faith in this shot I‚Äôm finna take
So come along for the ride you can witness the follow-through
No slave to the dollar but cash is needed for the journey
But surely not the destination‚Äôs end
Cuz I got bigger things waitin at the bottom of the net
Tryna get the ball rollin‚Äô like backspin off my fingertips
This is textbook, authentic rap
No lip singin‚Äô off the singer‚Äôs lips
I‚Äôm climbin‚Äô the path of glory with stairs at heavy increments
There‚Äôs no short-cuts to success
Don‚Äôt fucking ask me where the escalator is
The revolutionary breath
Will tour de stade around the globe
Before you make it up the escalator kids
I‚Äôm down to the earth still grazing up the steps/steppes
But I know they get jealous better catch ‚Äòem goaltending on a star
The shots ring out like Ringo and the Beatles, I
Pray my homies don‚Äôt fall apart
Partially cuz I‚Äôm home to the whole globe
Been blessed with more than you know and
I got a lot of souls to carry in my shopping cart
How can I only help myself when I got the best health
And I see ‚Äòem brain washed
I won‚Äôt let your brains rot cuz
When you spit fire you feel it burning, I
Got to unleash the burden that‚Äôs buried in my heart
Underestimated, they don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm
Smart enough to Shaka world with the 13 seed
My 13 tracks still hangin‚Äô with the best emcees

[Hook]
It‚Äôs funny how the music put time in perspective
I believe I can change a life with one record
Why was I created, I‚Äôm tryna find my maker
Tryna duck the evils made by my own creator
Then distributed by the humans, this is not our nature
And blame it all on a devil that prolly don‚Äôt even hate us or exist
But your guilt still insist on this figment of imagination
This content flooded kid cripples Satan
With enough righteousness to peel off on a nimbus cloud
See I‚Äôm on another level but don‚Äôt let the height get you down
Cuz I‚Äôm down the earth and the style is way underground
See I‚Äôm on another level but don‚Äôt let the height get you down
Cuz I‚Äôm down the earth and the style is way underground

[Verse 2]
If money make the world go round
I live in a time before the Chinese made paper currencies
So you can‚Äôt hide your assets
All I got is this mic and this bad breath
With which I‚Äôm killin‚Äô beats
Let‚Äôs trade fairly so it‚Äôs like
If you wanna save your life, just give me your rapping dignity
I speak for the humans starving for truth
This flavor will sustain you through the desert with a manner (manna)
Of rapping that heals the blind when I‚Äôm in the booth
This must be destiny of course
They gon‚Äô hear the sharpest talent but
They hardly get the point - shaven like Muhammad Amir
This prodigy will never be bribed by Satan
Funny how we can grab the coldest whip
And still steer out of gear
No need to fear in the quintessential recital
This is essential to our survival
I‚Äôll cause every tribe to bow down
For a mere sedentary nomad
Let my city go mad for a slow jam
That is a prayer between me and the Lord, this is our romance
You‚Äôre very blessed I even recorded these
And wrote ‚Äòem in my diary
And now you finna see that the
Journey is not unrealistic
I‚Äôm hardly optimistic and so persistent because I see the distance
Between me and the greatest is minuscule in relation to
The miles of tribulation
From the village of my daddy to "Subs" of Cincinnati

[Hook]

[DragonBall Excerpt]
What does this thing do?
If you can manage to sit on this cloud it can fly you wherever you want
But, you must be pure of heart to ride this cloud
That boy, is strange[Hook]
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner

[Verse 1: Substantial]
Do you honestly believe I'd turn my back on you and leave my true love all alone in this cruel world?
When every single solitary day I do my best to secure a future for me and you girl
Cause it IS all about you, It's been all about you
Seconds feel like millenniums when I'm without you
But my momma said there be days like this and ain't jack we can do
That's the way life is

But it's been weeks since I felt your lips and I'm a fiend for my queen so I need a fix
Only for now I'll settle for these talks on the phone
But I cut my arm off for a moment alone
With the one that I cherish whether in Rome or Paris, Amsterdam or Japan
Please note that I am thinkin' bout my baby as much as humanly possible
An' I know you're frustrated cause life has too many obstacles

[Hook]
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner

[Verse 2: Substantial]
My dear my dear my dear I know you're lonely
An' I know very well that it's hard and it hurts but there's no need to cry
Cause I will be home soon and there ain't no limit to the things that we goin' do
Whatever you want name it and I'll make it reality
To see my baby's face nothin' means more than that for me
This is far from flattery I ain't trying to impress you
Truth is I miss you and I'm hurtin' internally
Sometimes these long trips feel like eternity
But they say distance makes the heart grow fonder
And in this case it's proven to be fact
So I'll be back like a T100

From blocks away you will see me comin'
With the biggest smile you ever seen on my face
Cause even the toughest man on the planet needs lovin'
There's nothin' tame the wild like a woman's embrace

[Hook]
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner

[Verse 3: Substantial]
Feels like it's been forever and I can't wait to see ya
It's like wit' Bonnie and Clyde, Tony and Maria
Romeo and Juliet, Akeem and Lisa
Basically inseparable and it's more than sexual

Withstand every shell Tell me don't you like the sound of that?
Got my heart racing and about to have a heart attack
Wantin' to be loved by you just you
There's nobody loves you like I do
And I ain't scared to show it
But these feelings are hard to put into words
And I'm a poet slash MC
So give me credit for expressing them
Because writin' this was more nervous than I ever been

I had to get it out for when I'm unable to sit with you
You have a little song that I wrote for you to listen to
So you know the way that you're missin' me I'm missin' you
I wanna give you the world but for now I hope this'll doWhy go down? Fly more up
Don‚Äôt go now. Still go on. x2
Let‚Äôs be proud of what we are‚Ä¶

They call me the rapper‚Äôs rapper
Schoolin‚Äô fools like pappa rappa the rapper
Wrappin‚Äô rappers in wrapping wrappers
When I rap to rappers the rappers rather just wrap their raps up
When the rappers rap to the rapper‚Äôs rapper their raps get mad love
Love, l, l, l, love. Got me high when I fly lke a d, d, d, dove
Way a b, b, b, bove. My words flood, d, d, d, dud
The rebirth of rap happen when I d, d, d, does

It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶

Why go down? Fly more up
Don‚Äôt go now. Still go on. x2
Let‚Äôs be proud of what we are
& dream of sounds, emcee sounds

Music, rhyme, a poet‚Äôs voice
You‚Äôll be fine, use vocal chords x2
In this life know it‚Äôs hard
But own your life & go, it‚Äôs yours

As I hit the ground running
Sound stunning, noun hunting, verb punting, I steal a base
Kick my kicks up & reveal my taste
Tunes on, smooth songs, you could feel the bass
From blue wrongs to huge throngs how it heals my face
So this a much lighter shade than navy, maybe baby
& a much higher grade than A be, crazy gravy
& so much of what I say‚Äôs amazing, I made your fav list
Graveless so I‚Äôm livin‚Äô it up
Ageless, future earth gon be listening up
& whether you at work or out & sippin‚Äô from cups
Addicted to drugs, shopping, pickin‚Äô up stuff
Sick to your gut or loungin‚Äô in the crib with your son
Missin‚Äô someone & wishin‚Äô you could kiss ‚Äòem again
Grippin‚Äô a gun or peace marchin‚Äô, vixen or nun
The difference is none, love is, this is for them, one
Five eleven I‚Äôll be settling for utter superbness
Superfluus wordage for others I mutter this service
From the gutter to burbs it‚Äôs liable to smoter your purpose
So breathe deeply, easily while the youngster is swerving
I‚Äôve seen dumpsters & vermin, hustlers no permits
Puffers of herbage, smugglers, burglars & a hunger for murder
Others advert to urging brothers to further themselves
Becoming younger learners, taking the route of safe & legal money earners
Ancient evils come to turn us in the form of wicked media
Put all your tvs up & come explore this wikipedia
Make sure you‚Äôre taking what you‚Äôre seeing on your screen with a
Giant bowl of salt it‚Äôs truth go on & eat it up
But heat it up so it be steamier, feedin‚Äô us with bacteria
Seemingly backwards demons for deeming my raps inferior
Sneaky attacks on each of us, keeping us back it‚Äôs serious
Fiercely extracting tears from ducts, merely attaching fear for fuss
They‚Äôre barely human, can‚Äôt relate to the pains of the people
A scary nuissance but I‚Äôve planted my face to the peephole
& I hear their movements, all their plans are a shame & so lethal
So I‚Äôm weary to them, ‚Äòs all a scam & their aim is to keep you
Under their spell, mind control is the way of the future
Welcome to hell, you‚Äôll find your soul within fangs that‚Äôll chew ‚Äòem
In a dumpy jail the kind that‚Äôs cold & the grates of a sewer
Are what shut your cell, ‚Äòd be nice to know but we stay in a stupor
They‚Äôll try to scorch our source of knowledge as Bradbury said
But I‚Äôll die before I‚Äôm forced to follow, I‚Äôd rather be dead
They brainwash us with propaganda as Orwell had put it
& the same‚Äôll stop us from damag‚Äôn it, Winston surely couldn‚Äôt
The tralfamadorians were wrong sorry Vonnegut
No free will? That‚Äôs an excuse for the horror that violence is
But Fanon‚Äôs right, it could work in response & that‚Äôs not hypocrisy
As Heller‚Äôd written exists in military beaurocracies

But honestly‚Ä¶

How long, will this pain go on ?
‚ÄòCause I ‚Äòo‚Äôn‚Äô ‚Äòow, if I could take much more
& is it far, ‚Äôtil I make it home?
Home[Verse 1]
My minds kind of twisted
If talk doesn't concern me I've dismissed it
Forties, oral, and pussy‚Äôs damn I've missed it
But I've been dedicating late nights to you
And I wouldn't trade this for that shit, not this for that shit
You can't imagine
I don't care if it look good this ain't no beauty pageant
And I will reject it
Until I ask for some head and a bad bitch say yeah
Damn there goes my morals they just flew out the window
Everything I've learned replaced by what I intend on
And give a fuck about your life so go suck my dick
Yeah yeah, I'm a ho I've already been through this
But the nut bust just makes me feel so alive
Got this checklist I want to fill before I die
"Can't nobody tell my ass nothing." that's what Ye said
So, why can't I fuck my girlfriends white best friend?
Uh, but you probably call me foul for that now
Add your wrongs up you probably fouling out now
You a little mad I tell you calm your shit down
Why when you with your friends you always get loud?
What's a relationship without the arguments?
There ain't no point if you always arguing
Everything I say you think that I'm lying
With no trust what's the point of trying?
Stay twatching, sub tweeting, straight bitching
Shit I can't handle, can't deal, I'm leaving. (Bye)
And I'm leaving (OK)
But I'd be back (Stupid, stupid)
I always do. (What a dumb ass, wow)
Voices in my head (Yeah I'm here)
Man shut the fuck up. (OK)

[Bridge]
Got me lada da da, Lada da da
Lada da da, Lada da da
Lada da da da da. (2x)

[Verse 2]
Uh, this is excellence at it's best baby
And you ain't getting no better than this. (believe that, you know it, two hunnah)
Now shut the fuck up and listen
I got some problems up on my chest
Will some Ralph Lauren's put that to rest?
Will passion for this game end with my death?
Will I live on through my sons and my bitch?
I bet you will, bet you will
Remember me only if I was killed
Feels like my hearts trapped in a bottle filled with the feelings I never felt
Jesus came back and he spoke with me
He said I'm right here, right where I'm supposed to be
He said he was black, he said I'm the truth
He said I'm the voice of the new youth
And y'all know it's true, y'all know its true
You niggas act like you don't bang this shit
Walk with your girl like I ain't bang that bitch
Now your neighbors know my name and shit
Fuck off I'm living life and sinning
Going places you ain't attending
Charges on my card still are pending
That's Hammer won't be my ending
Life on edge (I'm living)
That's my pledge. (I'm living)
We living, we living
We live and we die[Verse 1: Cise Starr]
Light as a feather when I'm floating through
Reading through the daily news
Measuring the hurt within the golden rule
Centimetres of ether, I'm heating the speaker
Motivational teacher with words that burn people
Seeing the headlines lined with discord
It's either genocide or the planet in uproar
Never good.  The rules of paradise are never nice
The best laid plans of Mice and Men are never right
I'm just a Vagabond with Flowers for Algernon
The Average Joe who knows what the fuck is going on
It's the hope of my thoughts that I travel upon
Fly like an arrow of God until I'm gone, so I'm

[Hook: Cise Starr]
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to the something that is greater, so I'm
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to the something that is greater

[Verse 2: Akin]
Taking chances, word tap dancing with wolves
In an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of
Arizona, the sun be high, life's ironic
Ain't trying to be Dal√≠ when I write
Surreal life I paint it
Vivid, habitat crazy insane
Watch the propaganda six o'clock that are saying
Cultures clash, for black folk and white trash
They revel in the cyberspace that might crash, dash
To millennium a million miles of running
At the speed of now back, don't return gunning
Rambo style, gung ho child gunning
Ammo blao two times loud stunning
Stunning, when I hit ya, lift you off the Earth like
Ayo, take you right back to birth and
Niggas wonder why, they might wonder why
This shit might happen but it does, they go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cise Starr]
Treat you better than me, cause that's the heavenly key
To unlock the inner strength where my essence will be
It's the knowledge of self, understanding of the things around me
That becomes the wisdom that I need
Living this life to the best of my ability
Channeling energy to my thoughts into your symmetry
Remember me, because my prose remain gold
I got the gift of gab like them pimps in Kangol
It never ends, I keep it ruling like a cypher
The first caveman bringing fire
Innovating and higher; to blast mistakes I raise the stakes
It's double or nothing in this vaccuumless space
I will, survive, divine the time to cry
Fuck a hold or hide, I'm alive with pride
And I drove the Chevy to the Levy
But the Levy was dry, singing "This will be the day that I die"[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I said listen: I'm just tryin' to make a livin'
Fly to the sky, lifestyle, like some pigeon
So listen to the words, that set behind this written
Cause even on the Maury show: "I ain't ever kidding"
Keep my head to the sky and my foot up on 'em clouds
The sky's the limit then I ain't ever comin' down
Said my fly like G6 and 747s
And I be raisin' Hell till I find my way to Heaven
Murder in the booth, definition of a dropped call
My presence so right that, I come in and stop all
Spittin' too much, can we send a nigga few halls
Movin' all up, so hold the U-Haul
Lil' nigga came up, 15; I snatched the microphone
Better than these dudes that got twice my testosterone
So you better show me gratitude for ? I'm tokin'
And if you fly, then you gonna see me floatin'
Futuristic shit, stuntin' in the hovercraft
Me plus a girl who really wanna do the aftermath
Cause all I can do is just laugh hahaha
Listen: laugh, laugh last; laughin at you rappers
I troop on your swag cause I'm a snack-rapper
She found out I wasn't rappin', wanted to lick the wrapper
Gave me axe instead of gifts, like I'm the gift-wrapper
So I reel her in, in like a snapper
She started to do her dance, booty-clappin' like a clapper
She started talkin' cuffing, she really started acting up
I did the ghost, and I was gone like Casper
Like my momma tell me not to mess with these hoes
I'mma tell you rookies don't mess with no Pro
So money, cars, and clothes be all a nigga knows
There ain't no lyin', I'm the truth, you can tell by my nose
Ain't no Pinocchios
And that's just how the story goes
So please stay tuned for the rest of the showLord, if they only knew them nights it took
Burnt candles by the dozen to ignite the soul fire
Sheer energy to release to melt the heart
Mind starved, voice craved onto wax (and still get taxed)
Relax, unrest unless undressed to the core
Ever so slowly, wash away old skin like springs of sulfur
So far so good, what's life got to offer?
Youth stare curiously analyze the facts
Who's there to encourage give a pat on their back
How come society wanna grow and ignore small dreams
Big team, now every work is a chore
I adore each step, hop skip a cadence
Travel distant in the age of decadence
Do this in reverence to the older veterans
Stripes on their chest plus a chip on their shoulder
Street soldiers cut without severance
But keep hustling anyways for the L or the F of it
Effervescent light guide the way
Fear no evil, once lost now found
Like the last man down in the towering inferno of Babylon
First In Last Out

Thirstin' first drop just wet my appetite
But couldn't satisfy my craving for beats
Wrap tight like a Christmas gift
'Tis night is an eve for a generation to uplift
Live life like a testimony
Simple rhymes in difficult times help a friend
Through a lonely tunnel at the end
Every maze a funnel into a wine bottle
And corked inside a message so mind boggling, a puzzle
Amazed at the grace having reached a goal
Knock twice on the gate heaven preach a soul
True knowledge of self shine brighter than all
For one part getting polished you better the whole
The sum of the characters carry over your role
24-karat gold, each day is a jewel
Case closed when the end credits roll
Self-representative and elected, yes I
Give and get give back to the constituents
Sit you in a chair and break down the affairs
There's nuthin fashionable
About arriving late in the game and acting OG
Cuz you can't pay dues with credit or cash
Quicktime soft players streaming all the flash
So I'm sticking copper pins into media outlets
Then I hop up in a black van and I'm out
Let's get wit the program, shut the Dow Jonesing down
We keep underground dowsing
Microphones iron casting, everlasting sound
Blasting, no doubt
First In Last Out!

F.I.L.O, I'd rather do nuthin else
If I follow my heart to the last pulse
Like the last man down in the towering inferno of Babylon
First In Last Out[Flowers]

[Verse - Sicily Verdani]

I won't cry when it's raining in the spring time
I won't get lost in the meadows
Just enjoy the pretty (flowers)
My world is spinning topsy turvy
Fall time but it feels like early spring
No nostalgia, I just want to sing
Hit me like a spear
Took some time to lose the fear
Yellow, pink, violet and blue
Sprouting like our spirits do
Fragrant as the scent I wear pon' my breast
Revive you if you're lifeless

[Story of a Sad Boy]

[Verse - Just Lance]

Seems like every time I think about you
I can't seem to let go of the pain
But every time I see the flowers
I think of your smile every day
So now I vent to these instrumentals
And I guess it just makes the troubles go away
It makes the troubles go away
It makes the troubles go away
So first things first
I'm kinda expressive while others find it a nuisance
I find it impressive
Well, a little off balance here to show off a talent
Before you wanna judge me
Here, I'll give you a mallet or the gavel
Whatever you prefer
Just make sure you hear every word along with every verb
And every noun from the sounds of the vocal
This isn't a song
More of a poetic flow
Yo, open your chakras and let ya auras flow
I gotta go, well, meditate
Locked out the Heaven's Gates with the master key in my suitcase
Yeah[Verse 1]
Individual stars float in the ocean of God
Rocking a pinky ring of Saturn while I'm visiting Mars
Egos bigger than Jupiter are breaking the bars
Holding me back down to Earth to physical laws
Touching the moon, grace as I ready resume
Comets flying through space bringing possible doom
Blocking the sun, bring a holocaust on the world
I'm talking back to Father Time, Mother Earth is my girl
I got the wings of angels walking down the valley of death
Watching my step, cause The Devil's never one to respect
Come correct on the studio track, taking it back
To the pen and pad, I blast the original rap
Brother on the B-Boy tip, with Krylon spit
I tag the charts with the graphical hits
So who you fucking with, arm leg led to arm head
Snapping your neck back while you spit out a Pez
I be the original son of a bitch, hurting your wrist
Cause you spinning my shit so much the needle skip
Flip to the rhythm and reminisce, remember the days of
'94 (Nine Four) hip-hop was a gift
Words out of her lips came straight from the heart
Never prepackaged or bought, or negative thought
Peddle to consumers, magazines, and rumors
Commercial spots turn real artists to looters
Precise rap, rock and roll, nigga lets do this
I'll float through those break beats with my maneuvers

[Hook x2]
Yo regardless
While I be moving swiftly through darkness
Plotting, charting my path, I'm running, cutting my losses
Stumbling over unknown bumps and complications
And tribulations of my life of revelations

[Verse 2]
Speaking to scorpions making my heart turn to porcelain
That used to have a steady beat now its easily broken
My coast and train of thought stopped emotions
Welling at the core of my being causing commotion
Need to release, cause the stress will tear me to pieces
My love ceases and my thoughts break into leases
The height of my life, but the strife making me leave this
I can't beat this, going to God to defeat this
Will he help, or do I have to do this myself?
Alone and confused, the blues burden my health
My eyes remain closed cause my highs are lows
I'm feeling the blows of rain cause my pain is cold
Now who am I, a man or a pawn in life?
Living day to day, I pray am I wrong or right
Losing my mind so maybe you can help me find
The way to go so I can be leaving this pain behind
Trying to sleep, "Sleep is the cousin of death,"
Said a wise man from Queensbridge, on beats he blessed
Trying to rest, instead I rest my head
On a pillow of hardships, misery is the bed
On my back, I lie, I can see the skies
Through the glass ceiling, the reason tears drowning my eyes
And I can't move, grief won't let me think
My soul is dry; I crawl just to take a drink
I made you blink, think like a visible man
With mechanical hands trying to reach out to my fans

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Yo viscosity of the hidden meaning between my words
Thicken the plot, I caught hidden rhythms and verse
I'm loading the hearse, you biting like a Dracula curse
I'm bringing the worst of hurt like a sermon in church
Pertaining to you, hurts just to listen to truth
So you'd rather listen to lies, so you're living to lose
I'm beginning to win, young man, master in sin
Battle within, looking at The Devil and grin
I'm flipping the script, walking on a journey and trip
On the gurney they missed, and the fact that life is a bitch
And I'm hating this shit, losing blood, making me crip
With stakes aside, bet, and I lost the grip
Searching for bliss, with the razor over my wrist
Needing a job but the drug test's checking my piss
I'm looking through a window and seeing the immaculate conception reborn
Peace in my core with seven swords, a knight in a war
Looking to the eyes of the lord, calculating what more
Seeing the signs of heaven nevermore
The last matador riding the pale horse, losing my course
Splitting the hairs, causing divorce
Marriage unborn, I havoc in song, I stumble upon
Lost jewels of thought, thought to be gone
Lost forever, I sever motherfuckers with letters
Written in script, forward to the rap that I rip
From the top of the lip, make a drink, take it and sip
Then I'm gulping the shit
Falling deeper in the abyss...[Intro: Substantial]
Substantial and Nujabes
Still doing this
Yeah

Sorry love
Sorry love
Sorry love
But it seems like it isn't in the cards for us

[Verse 1: Substantial]
Me and you is a blessing see
Sorry, sweetheart we can never be
The little things you do be depressin' me
Still, baby girl, we can never be
You only want one night of ecstasy
Thanks but no thanks it can never be
Cause I got a wife at home that I'm blessed to keep
And to fool around with you would be the death of me
Can't have the ingredients of the recipe
Cause it isn't fair to you nor fair to me
And more importantly
It sure isn't fair to her
Guess we might've had a chance before I married her
Cause wifey is worth more than life to me
A soulmate
Who am I to control fate?
Cause somebody like you is much more than a cud buddy
But I can't give you all the things that you want from me
So...

[Hook: Substantial]
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
But it seems like it isn't in the cards for us
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
But it seems like it isn't in the cards for us

[Verse 2: Substantial]
I know you think I'll be the perfect man
But it seems like the most I have ever pleased
Besides I'm no better than my brotha man
Can't run around like Mr. Lover Man
Tryin' to maintain
Spend the rest of my life with the same dame
That's right, uh
Found the right one
Sounds like fun
But I ain't this and that
Cause if I lose her, slim chance I'll get her back
This is real life
This ain't cinemax
Tryin' get my little seats filled
People feelin' packed
On these hardwood floors
On this house we own
They get hot, we know
But it's not for show
Not that anything's the matter with you
But there's no guarantee that I'm compatible with you
And I can't make you into something you're not
Know people look around for what they already got
So...

[Verse 3: Substantial]
I ain't tryin' to
Waste your time, boo
I know you've been stepped on
And been lied to
God bless the next man who's lucky to find you
It's hard to sep the ties
But, baby, I got to
Uh, that's the way it is
I know you don't know what to think of this
And I'm really sorry that it came to this
Feels like an endless break it is
Cause I think it's easier that way
That's passe
And it hurts like a bad date
And the pressure is enough to make a back break
But to lead you on would be mad fake
So do your thing, baby
I'll do mine
Don't worry 'bout me, girl
I'll be fine
This is all my fault
I'm too kind
And a decent human being's hard to find

[Hook]I've been so free, I've been so free here
Y'know, with the album
If there's anything I wanna try
I'm welcome to do it
Y'know, so that's uh the freedom of experimentin'
I heard you was uh, splittin' in last (quinteteer)?
And findin' something on your own?
Yes, I am
How's that
With whom?
I have uh I have several men in mind
But I haven't selected exactly something quartet
A quartet?
Yeah
Maybe uh, several weeks after startin'
...
John, which kinda players do you think (buh) if any at all?
