[Intro]

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on (x8)

[Verse 1: Sadat X]
Let's go deep into the phrase, feel the sun rays
Off the baldhead, everything is real
Biggie put me on this joint, so I'mma be the big wheel
Watch it spin, hey dad, placed your bet on seven
Peace to 106, 108, 110 and 111th
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm, to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an emcee wanna sing for a living
Take the beatdown we fucking giving
C'mon, motherfucker!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sadat X]
What? Niggas want drama, putting work on my block
When I told y'all last week that shit was too hot
Selling deuces and treys cuts my dimes
Somebody don't get paid, somebody's block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as ya run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo, Biggie, tell these niggas I'mma hit 'em where it hurts
The Big City, it don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or four stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey, your money, that's your stock; yo, bitch, pass the Glock
I'mma tell them, "It can happen, don't play me with that rap shit"
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Notorious B.I.G.]
I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give emcees the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable
Peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
Cause I got mo' shots to pop ya
Big Poppa, breaking you off something proper
Signing off is the hardcore rap singer
AKA crack slinger, bring it any time nigga

[Hook][R.A. The Rugged Man]
I walk in the Pentagon with a blood soaked hatchet
Leave the president's nose shattered
Stretch his neck like go gadget, and toe tag it

[Vinnie Paz]
You a stone cold faggot
I hold the chrome in a jacket
Go toe to toe with a savage
And roll you over a cactus

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Funeral's are closed caskets, coke addicts
Chrome ratches, the whole package
I'll beat Moses on the head with them stone tablets

[Vinnie Paz]
I killed Kennedy, brains blown all over Onassis
I'll hold my own with the axes
And turn the pope into ashes

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Designed frequency, I'm a holy divine lyrical deity
Even atheists and heathens and non-believers believe in me
The punk-ass devil was born soft
I'll piledrive you like Paul Orndorff
Steal his pitchfork and rip his horns off
I'm the born force

[Vinnie Paz]
Sick fuck, I'll skin you alive and then carry the bones
Load the ruger up and shoot you up like I'm Marion Jones
Vinnie is out of his dome
Guinea that carry the throne
Gimme, it's that or be stoned
Trinity, that'll be home

[Hook: Sadat X]
We bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
New jack pussy, young rappers think their rapping is good
Young rappers get treated like fetuses in planned parenthood
This ain't no Mickey Mouse, zip-a-dee-doo-dah Disney
It's the claws of a grizzly
It ain't Wayne and Drizzy, it's Thorburn and Vinnie

[Vinnie Paz]
And R.A., that’s my brother there, anyone who unaware
I'mma leave em stumbling as if they had a ton of beer
I'm from Philly, it ain't a sucker to ever come from here
You a pussy, you see confrontation and you run from there

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
What kind of dirty bitch did your daddy put his sperm in?
Kiddie porn web searching, pervert jerking, you serpents is Satan's servants

[Vinnie Paz]
You get slain for certain if you put your faith inside of Satan serpents
Stick the blade in you while I embrace you like my favorite person

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Stay in Hell burning, slaves with chains on your brain like a turban
I make Abel kill Cain and get bible pages reversing, brains bursting

[Vinnie Paz]
It takes a taste of bourbon for me to rape a virgin
And Vinnie deal with mathematics like an Asian person

[Hook: Sadat X]

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Hands like Roberto Durán, it's the flight 103 Pan Am
It's the Gulf War between Iraq and Iran
Treat you like Indians I'm snatching your land
I'm more dapper than Dan, I'm Rakim I master the plan
I bring the roots without having a band

[Vinnie Paz]
Without having a fan I coulda never took care of my fam
I coulda never done all the tours on the shores of Japan
Still would've slaughtered your man, still would've aborted the plan
Still an apostle from Sham, still I'm like God in Sudan

[Hook: Sadat X][Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies, the highs
At all of these industry shing-dings
Where you see the pretty girls
In the high animated world
Checking for a rapper with all the dough
If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business?
And you think that you got what it takes?
I mean you really gotta rap, and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks
Check it out!

[Hook: All]
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
The ups and downs with the hoes (The Business)
Always getting fronted on at shows (The Business)
People gotta stick their nose (In the Business)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
Ain't no-one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the games just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real...

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
They're giving you the business and putting on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say "Where's my loot?"
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're making fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cos you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, "More soup with your meal?"
Cos this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say...

[Verse 4: Phife]
Aw shucks, look what the cat hauled in
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Going out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flying
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
Cos they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cos your lyrics is butt

[Hook: All]
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
People can't walk a straight line in (The Business)
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)

[Verse 5: Sadat X]
The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
"Oh, he's a cutie", yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game
And I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

[Verse 6: Diamond D]
Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefing ("Boy, get a job")
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willing and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
(For what?) That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing
When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild[Produced By: Hi-Tek]

[Scratched Hook]
"Still getting mine, in the 1 9 9 9"

[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down
I had this, I had this friend of mine
Who just, you know, he was moving too fast, you known I'm saying?
I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill
I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta
Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time

[Common]
Check it
It's like I'm fighting for freedom, writing for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see 'em
My ancestors, when I'm writing I see 'em and talk with 'em
Hoping in the promise land I can walk with 'em
Shitted on so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall with 'em
Molest concepts, stalk rhythms, paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MCs reckless eyeball, why y'all wanna go and do that?
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the U-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto photo with one nigga in the chair
Holding liquor in despair, gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice with metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life, I'm like chief up in this demonstration
Still...

[Scratched Hook]

[Sadat X]
You squirm with discomfort, wiggle and cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
I'mma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the places I went to, always played the low
It's like a competition, this mission here I'm telling you
Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is felling you
Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick
Cause I'm the dead eye, with the red eye, from Chi to L-I
I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growing
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showing
A male seed, praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
Common, why they tempt me
The king of the simply, bore in mic
I always stay on top cause I give niggas what they like
I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday
If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way
The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother
Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress
You know I'm still...

[Scratched Hook]

[Common]
Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over
Angel on my main shoulder telling me remain sober
Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles, I'm warring like a G-Child
Searching for the child in me, this style in me
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the balcony
Lyrically I put a hit on 'em, cause I'm the style "Nitti"
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Trying to get a chick to kick it with me till the tilt
Told her my chamber's like Wilt
Built with her for a sec, let her know I had respect
Less than a hour she was giving me neck, yo I'm still getting mine

[Scratched Hook][intro: Sadat X: sampled from "Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down"] (Jay-Z) (*Uncle Murda)
One day when I was ridin on the train I seen these two kids talkin
About the (Roc-A-Fella) had fallen (YEAH!)
One day when I was ridin on the train I seen these two kids talkin
About the (Roc-A-Fella) had fallen (YEAH! Roc-A-Fella y'all!!!! OWWW!!!!)
(*EAST NEW YORK!!!!)

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
Before Stack Bundles died he said I was the new version of Biggie
B.I.G. tell Stacks he wasn't lyin I really get busy (You heard Diddy?!)
I be listenin like damn I said that?!
I should be a millionaire where the fuck is the bread at?! (Where the money?)
Come on niggas come up to me and say
You should have signed to 50 instead of signin with Jay (WORD!!!)
Man I got six figures from Jay I'm straight
You little groupie ass niggas get the fuck out my face!!! (UHHHHH!!!)
Chris Lighty told me to tell y'all get off my dick
I'm connected how y'all know I ain't fuckin with Fif?! (G-G-G-G-G)
Hustlers holla at me like, whattup Murd?
I heard you got it but you overchargin niggas for that work (I AM!!!)
You get it for the low low but your prices is WOOO!!!!!!
(It's about to be higher!!!!)
I'm like yeah that's the motherfuckin TRUTH!!!! (But it's fire!!!)
Shit you know where I gotta go to get it
I be feelin like Frank Lucas before he started snitchin

[Chorus: Sadat X] (DJ Scratching)
He asked for it his man saw it so it don't mean shit to me
He's gone, and that's how it supposed to be
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!!!)
He asked for it his man saw it so it don't mean shit to me
He's gone, and that's how it supposed to be
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!!!)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Let's do this..
Yes, gangsta, gangsta, how y'all wanna do this?
I clap niggas down for yappin off follish
Ain't no stoppin this Roc-A-Fella movement
The name is Jay Guevara, homie, who are you and
Your offbeat DJ? If anything he play, sound familiar
I'll wait 'til Pharrell say, ("Lame...")
Now I have to diss you, Joe
You can get a smack for that, matter of fact
The gats are blown, the natural like Roy Harve'
The boy hard, your Toy Squad'll get squashed, BOY!!!
Yardee, y'all be lost in the source
Partly because y'all boss ain't a leader
He's a follower, (NO!!!) no, I'm not coppin ya
Album or your single, you likely to go coppa
The coke coppa, the quick K cooker
Sadat X like Master P, bring the hook up

[Chorus: Sadat X] (DJ Scratching)
He asked for it his man saw it so it don't mean shit to me
He's gone, and that's how it supposed to be
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!!!)
He asked for it his man saw it so it don't mean shit to me
He's gone, and that's how it supposed to be
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!!!)[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I will never spit on a Mantan jam
But damn, Pharoahe's that nigga though
Slam these bitches like Bam Bam Bigelow
Critically acclaimed, physically main
Literally the shit -- you the shitstain
I spit insane, get brain, you switch lanes
You itch-bay made, I flip lames like Judo
Or karate, then slow it down like promethazine
King Musabi from Queens
In fact, Queens' Idi Amin
Fuck Serato, for wax and CDs I fiend
Escalate like Schindler, elevate like Otis
Minus the mescaline
If you questioning who the GOAT is
Focus on where you vocal to note I'm the most devoted
Nobody's equivalent, more quoted
Pharoahe's the lowest
Common denominator when I'm rhyming
In fact, I'm the quotient

[Hook: Phil G]
This is our way
This is everything we are
This is our place
You could never get involved, this is our thing
This is our dream
Legacy is what I leave for my offspring
Walking with my head held high
Educated, I could build with the Gods
Plus I got that fly delivery
Don't ever be surprised that they feeling me

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
Keep your eye on the sparrow
Keep your eye on the Pharoahe
More bone-crushing than marrow
The Menace cousin Harold
The Bradys Tom and Carol
Hades def apparel
Jump the falls in a barrel
The cowboy is ending now, boy
The when and how, boy
The off-roaded, decoded by none
"Girlies, rub your titties" was said by son
Chop the head then it's done, no bread by the gun
More enormous than Pun
In human form, it's the one
Through the light stress, life vest, tight chest breathing
I'm good, you believing
I should keep achieving
Pull something from the sleeve and brought it out on rainy days
Like green granny haze
Expands from my grays, demands better days
Your mans love the phrase
Plan, never phase
Fried, bouillabaisse
Fricasseed or sauteed
Chef Roble
Glad y'all stayed, let the beat slay
Born on the day that Mary prayed
Y'all know what she made -- the modern Jesus
We too made Caesar

[Hook][Verse 1] Ill Bill

One percenters and five percenters
Album outlines the center
Rapping knives and the Berettas, the lies and vendettas
Trials of menace to society is brainwashed
Brain drops, nervous rooks cops with itchy trigger fingers spraying Glocks
And frustrated rappers sometimes swear
Waving Mac 11s you either buy my CD or die in the streets
Sometimes I feel like I was born on Doomsday
Then I think about my daughter
And the future and pray that these moods change
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
Get on your knees, I brought a guillotine to put your heads
Essential, the essence, always carry a deadly presence
Destined to be revolutionary with every sentence
I been the one to pull the card on frauds
Put them in their place, drop the bomb and start the war
The fuck you think we brought these rocket launchers for?
Not to brag about the way we pop Techs
Ill Bill, Sadat X, who got ?

[Hook]

A lot of y’all got the whole game confused
The tricknology got me blowing a fuse
I don’t know these dudes, they can’t sport these shoes
They ain’t show you the truth, they ain’t paid no dues

A lot of y’all got the whole game confused
The tricknology got me blowing a fuse
I don’t know these dudes, they can’t sport these shoes
They ain’t show you the truth, they ain’t paid no dues

[Verse 2] Sadat x

The backbone sets the overall tone
We soldiers, dude, and ain’t even standin’ straight up or weightless
Listen, I ain’t gon’ debate this
How you win the case when your shit is all over the place?
Who’s your co-signer? It must’ve been a minor
Bill is ill, ain’t no feelings heartbeat
Dudes left the Apple while we stay in the heat
Cause we love to compete, that’s what gladiators do
They say they love blood, dirty sick but
Vietnam tactics, spikes in the mics
In the States turnpikes is reduced
? after nine hours for the cake can make me stay awake
I’m not concerned with who earn
I need my stacks to blow
When I be hearing some of these records
I don’t really know these dudes, I’m not a fad thief
And I’m original pattern, one of one
After the needle line is done, the educated sniff a dollar
The rest still suck from the breast and keep nursing
Don’t be that person (never that)

We taking you higher, while Dres making it flyer
Making a fire, black man walking the wire
You're talking to sire, profile for to those aspire
To see more than what they saw when they looked upon Delilah
Survivor, for those who can't attain or acquire
Required to rip, you flip, shit supplier
We're loved throughout the shire, respected, admired
And fuck an empire when it's built upon a mire
Destroy and rebuilt for ourselves we gonna see him
Sadat's a Black Sheep and I'm a Brand Nubian
And doing is being, tell me, do you believe in
Maximum effort we forever over-achieving
Tighten the rope, feel the flight of the dope
Light it and smoke, sip it, chug it and choke
Going for broke, in my heart I still sell
Switch the land with the plan, everyone man will tell

[Hook: Dres & Sadat X]
Hey boy, this is the way the East Coast swing it so bring it (3x)
Sounds, rugged and raw, got rhymes galore

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
I was the Black Sheep, the first car I bought was a black Jeep
Girl called me a black creep way back, father said
"stay black" forces, taxes, courses
Jump into a black pool and emerge as a black jewel
Engine number 9 was fine, other had swine
I told the wife, "yo, you can't make me bacon"
Syndicated, indicated that we wouldn't sell
But that ain't rock for me, and Dres will tell
I heard you got the fever for the flavor
I don't get along with my neighbors, they crabs
This shit is up for grabs
O.G's, oh please, we still do dates, leave it to the fates
We trying, dudes ain't buying
They thieves, kill it where it breathes
Don't hate, we're just trying to pay a small rate

[Verse 3: Jarobi]
Walk for a second, nigga feel my energy
Witness dirty skills and a pure delivery
Camouflage on stage, you can't see me
With them lights all on and I'm looking all shimmery
You know what? I should get an award
Like, "Mr. Most likely to never leave you bored"
Or, wait, "Come-back emcee of the century"
Riddled with intrigue, wrapped in mystery
Do you know your history? No? Well me either
But I bet you know about 30 different strands of reefer
I've traveled dusty roads, have dents on my fingers
Even when my voice stops, memories still linger
Construct rhymes like Kaiser Söze spins tails
Even thugged-out niggas give me digital sales
Dat, Robe, and Dres, hard as shit you can sell
Heaven only knows and time will tell[Intro: R.A. the Rugged Man]
(There's only 50,000 heads that are true to this
The rest are clue-less to what real hip hop music is)

[Verse 1: Sadat X]
Now what I expect
It's spin a lost on some vile shit
And the same rap jams is what slams on the radio
Why I have to pay my wage to be played on 97
When I've been doing this shit on stage since I was 11?
I be the underground king, the fighter, of low rate
And the promo dates, is what the black man hates
Now to me I should been platinum or at least should gone gold
But I ain't, so I got to keep my soldiers on the street
So we can eat, hey this program's directed at the radio who can't feel me
They ain't trying to jam my shit, when I'm trying to be legit
I am the legendary and I vary
Like the flavours from Ben & Jerry
One foot is in the street, the other in the studios
Sometimes I wake up late at night, and don't know which way to go
Should I sell for a hundred thousand, or keep fighting public housing
Or get my homeboys out of jail for trying to sell the skill
Overfail on some own real rap shit
I kick for niggas on stage that don't have shit
R.A. what's the lesson for today, Rugged Man?
Should we ignore the scan that influence the record sales
And we need money right here -  motherfuck "Save the Whales"

[Hook: R.A. the Rugged Man {Sadat X}]
(There's only 50,000 heads that are true to this)
{One foot is in the street, the other in the studios}
(There's only 50,000 heads that are true to this
The rest are clue-less to what real hip hop music is)

[Verse 2: R.A. the Rugged Man]
Hey, noh-how
Now who these kids think they are? Don't sweat those kids
They're trying to ruin our careers, when I've been doing this rap stuff for 10 years
I can't remember any time that was worse
They tried to treat me like Heavy D and said I couldn't curse
Get hit up, get your head split up
Don't matter Foxy Brown or Little Kim, in bed I can tear any freaky bitch up
Leave the spot lit-up, the opposite of heaven is what we living
Now how come these envious cats always be sweating my position?
I'mma live life to the fullest till I die, it's my religion
We gon' beat down your whole cypher if your freestyle ain't hitting
I could diss though or not work, R.A. the Rugged, Sadat X
I'm top 5 lyrically, if you ain't listing me you dissing me
49 wins with no losses, heavyweights know who the boss is
Disrespect, don't want to find out what the cause is (Hey, hey noh-how)
I make this come back in '97
Y'all lyricists who hip hop is your life give love back in '97
Don't play me, I react violently now in '97
Ignorant minds best to speak silently now in '97
R.A. the Rugged Man, hated by everyone
Yo, yo, that's why I'm here yo
Yeah, we in here, we in here

[Hook]Grand Pub'.. Scaramanga Shallah.. Sadat X
Bout to hit this, word up

[Grand Puba]
Once the Grand spread his stuff, pockets fluff like Jiffy Puff
"Inside Stuff," Ahmad Rashad know I keep it rough
Blazin for the two-cen' and after black
Once I spit the half to that, shorties form a line at the welcome mat
Godly ways and action be fo' yo' satisfaction
Chicks feel me like attraction, move shoes like Foot Action
Justice Cipher Born be to leave the mic torn
Rhyme flow vibrates and kill flow like radiation
You know the deally, watch me flip it on the really
Once the God begin to bomb it, all beware Haji comet
Plain and simple, I shine like a iced out Presidential
Gold fronts be the dental as I smack you in the mental
Deadly flows that I use'll bust a vein in your temple
I go back like a rental
He Allah Justice Islam for the fam
Got no problems to hit you all with the plan

Chorus: Sir Menelik (repeat 2X)

7XL, the Gods live well, cash clientele
Checks out the mail, sippin Guinness while
Flippin bidness well, in a tailor made whip
Accelerate, make papes while we marinate

[Sir Menelik]
With mad game I kick the King Verbal, God Wisdom
Cypher Seven Twenty built two circles, it's no fabrication
Chicks with bricks, catch the sensation
Spectacular interaction, my raps capture your fascination
Still I maintain finesse, explain in text, train the best
Troopers usin telekinetic prophetic maneuvers
To gain blessin, Puba, Sir Menelik, Sadat assemble
The rock tight, collaboration
One physical jewel formed to the fill the manifest, dest'
Jehovah's Knight, give the devils stressed out
Spark up remarkably, live palatial, gems glacial
Ladies stay in my facial labels pay to keep me laced
Sports the short fade, paid suede soft butter Avirex
Turbotron don intellect, mental flex connects aspects
Got cream like NASDAQ, so to competition don't be abstract
The Extra Large mack reacts

Chorus

[Sadat X]
Her black panties up the antes which was well spent on
There was cash bent on for porn, latex worn
It's on, sting like a thorn in the morn' for self-guilt
And think about the ass you kilt
From one stone, great cities was built
We're terrorists with a twist, Menelik, you must know this!
The Brand Nubian name, will live long in the annals of fame
And if she say she don't get down well that's game
She ran the same shit yesterday with bird from what I heard
Over on Eighth Ave or up at the Tomb
What's a nigga to assume, if you lead me to the room?
It ain't all cool, I'll still wild and pee in the pool
Then cap a fool from a thing that was in high school
I'm international, passport, onslaught with flyer mouths
The red lights of Amsterdam, exotic chicks from Surinam
Haha, Great X

[Hook x2]

7XL, 7XL...(Sadat X)
When you say the name X, think synonymous wit fame
Only draw love off the mention of my name
I got a rhyme or two left then I'm a blend to the side
Go out on top like Jim Brown at his peak, I get wreck like ery week
Get my freak on, who dares to speak on
My armed forces recon, penatrating like decon
Guerilla tactics, stage theatrics
She's laying on the mattress
I'm hiking up the black dress
Finesse called on me to bless
I pulled the S off my varsity sweater, fine tuned to the letter
So let's make these stacks and max, relax, be waxed
The tracks receive faxs wit my picture, in a cowboy hat
Now top that, yo, kid, top that
Kid got blown away at exactly where you're sitting
Just the other day but nobody's admitting
To the crime, I'm a MC not a MD
The best in history or maybe one of the top 3
Says myself, no diggedy

(Large Professor)
I be synonymous to king, fling niggas to the mat
Like an acrobat, flipping the mental ass whipping
Is served when I un-nerved another wack Jack imposter
Trying to fraud, you gots to get the fuk down wit the Lord
Finesse, whether you think you're pimp status or the best
Mad crazy or stupid, find a hot beat and loop it
For what it's worth, I've been a hip-hopper from birth
Try to disrespect and get your ass played up like a smurf
I'm running over the track, type of nigga to stack
One million, hit my moms, then fuk it, make a trillion
To start, showing the world who's the man wit the heart
That's about to blast off on these kids that's mad soft
Don't fuk wit Large Professor or you get your ass mauled
So ah, say no more, them niggas that supports
Large Profess, Lord Finesse and Dat X for the tour
Grand Puba, who's probably coming back from Aruba
Wit the skill to build, I'm saying peace, you niggas, chill

(Grand Puba)
Dig it, I be that nigga wit the creamy ass rhyme flow
My shit's so hot, I'll burn the ass of an Eskimo
I'm saying though, it be the Grand flipping flam
Giving love to my fans and you know this man
My composition leaves competition wishing
They could be in my postition cuz I did it wit no ass kissing
I'll be there like Michael Jackson and you don't stop
Until you get enuff and I'll be damn if my nose drop
I speak Actual facts on how I feel
Don't worry baby, wit Puba, there's no waiting just to exhale
I bag dimes like Jada, step through playa haters
Keep niggas moving like a fuking escalator
Because it's poetry in motion
Pube keep it smooth like lotion, keeping MC's lost like Billy Ocean
Dig what I'm saying I be a buck 85 on the weigh-in

(Lord Finesse)
It goes dip dip diving, check who you sizing
It's the wize civilizing, pockets stll rising
When I drop it, I'm futuristic like Fiber Optic
Didn't buy my album, you played yourself, should of copped it
Nuthin could beat my elite rhymes throwing your hands kid
That better be a peace sign
You don't want it, that's my steelo, how we on it
When we do our thing, niggas spread the word like informants
But still advancing, skills enhancing
We got up on a shooken offbeat like white people dancing
We're too bugged, true thugs
Quick to get in that ass in ways that homo's wouldn't approve of
I'm not yapping, just rapping
Don't care if you're gold or platinum, don't think it can't happen
Whether wit a beat or acapella, it's the mic Rockafella
Strictly out for the mozarella
Fuk guns and toolies, we don't betray movies
It's yours truely that's smoothly, still sounds groovy
You can't do me or dis me, don't try to get wit me
My style is tricky like spelling Mississippi
Strictly, come and get me, if you can flip me
If this flow was whisley, I have you muthafukas tipsy
The ghetto type playas that caters
Famous to you spectators, the rhyme sayers, catch you later[Lord Jamar]
Lord Jamar, Sadat X
Grand Puba, Brand Nubian
Check it, yo

Lord J, rap's Broadway Joe
I'm like Namath cause I'm famous for the way that I flow
See you're an anus and you're heinous, I just think you should know
That in the plainest, you're the lamest and I think you should go
Straight to hell, New Rochelle, that's where I'm from
You got money for a show then here I come
You wanna front on the low then hear my gun
I'll have you trapped in a closet with nowhere to run
Huh, yeah, my flow is impeccable
Yours don't make sense like homosexuals
You do a show, I'ma throw more vegetables
Youse a bitch, you need to grow some testicles
Your whole style is unacceptable
None of your albums will ever be collectable
Least you could do is try to keep it respectable
This is yoga rap, my flow is so flexible

[Chorus: DJ JS-1 scratches]
"Ghetto music rap, we doing it" - Lord Jamar
"Brand Nubian" - Sadat X
"I flirt with the idea of quitting the game
Nah, I'ma evolve, continue to change" - Xzibit
"Ghetto music rap, we doing it"
"Brand Nubian"
"Ghetto music rap, we doing it"
"Brand Nubian"

[Grand Puba]
Yeah, yo, 'Datty X, Grand Puba, Lord J

See when I drop my thesis
I keep a hundred niggas straight down the line like permanent creases
That paper increases, hot whips on leases
Sort of mine like nephews and nieces
I give it to you straight black, I ain't never been a hate cat
I'm more concerned with filling up my plate Jack
Shit I'm starving, keep them bullshit snacks
I need my bank account obese when I'm moving in that Maybach
A fool can learn from his own mistakes
But the wise man learn from others
That's why when I give it to you homie, gotta keep it real talk
So you ain't stuck with three baby's mothers
I be that Mister Magnificent, oh so significant
NY, so fly, viewing it from the bird's eye
Grand Puba, the mammies are magnetic
Bullshit niggas and bitches is getting deaded, uh

[Chorus]

[Sadat X]
Grand Puba, Lord Jamar, 'Dat X the Wild Cowboy

Wake up in the morning with the yearning for 'erbs
Go to war with my dudes, it's like we fighting the Serbs
And I ain't got to prove it to y'all
The Jews and the A-rabs, that's a real brawl
Don't let them slugs gas up your ear
You was never in the jail, you never walked down the tier
Me? I'd rather be surrounded by broads
Even though I know half of them is really straight frauds
Damn, it's great to be here with my brothers
Blowing things in the air, ain't near no baby mothers
I am still the Wild Cowboy, ask yourself who got more style boy
I warn you, I'll go baseline on you
Hit you with the eighth and you keep that faith
The Brand Nubian combo, Grand Puba ensemble
Still type hungry, let's eat this food
I could jump in this stew, there's no known cure

[Chorus][Sample]

Darling
Ya know, you give a man a reason for living
Not to mention, you take my paycheck
Now baby, but I give it to you because I love you
Ya know cuz the things that I feel so proud about
The things that you do
Ya know, like runnin' my car into telephone poles
Plus (?) I didn't get mad did I?
Y-Y-y'member, 'member when
W-W-When I tried to take my clothes to the cleaners
And on the way out
My very best pinstripe caught a nail
I didn't get mad
I was proud because you thought, enough of your man
To be in such a hurry
It made me feel grand, yes it did
Uuh I need you, I just need you

[Verse 1]
Uh
You know I was your bread, your butter
And I ain't talkin bout that bread I fucked up on you
Cause in my head man I swore I lucked up
Wasn't countin all the butter I spreaded on you
So true now, why would I play you bitch I made you
I'm not talkin bout the things that I gave you
Clothes wit the labels, I brought you round Hov and the label
Spring water while holdin you're age koo
Naw I ain't tryin to degrade you
But you was a lost little girl n you're world boo I saved you
Ya pop owe me a favor, I basically raised you
From squada to Bentley-whippin
Ain't have to watch Cribs to see how I was livin
Me, so blinded ain't see the Robin Givens in you
Huh, shoulda seen the Ginger in you
Tried to off Beans like Rothstein? Go figure
Youu take my dough, spend wit the next nigga you crazy bitch?

(Chorus #1)
And dis was the one I trusted
Who would ever think she would spread like mustard
Bitch I was your bread and butter
You shoulda tucked dat bread and butter
Ya know what?... Dis shit funny to me
It ain't nuttin but money to me
You lookin hungry to me
But I was your bread and butter
Bitch shoulda tucked dat bread and butter
Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm

[Verse 2]
You got the whole town laughin at me, silly he
Silly to see got me feelin silly like Denise like
Oh what could it be in you, I see
N dis young P-Y-T
She got me L-O-V, E-T-K-O'd
Uh, like Teddy P. whatever she say goes
But I'm, ready to +Turn Off The Lights+
Close the door, on my pretty young mi amor
Now peep game wit 'em, need, I, more
Gimme dat, E thy or
No Beanie Mac don't play dat crap wit these whores
She want me missin her (in my room) like the O'Jays homes
But I'm on to my zone like O.J. Jones
Beano brown, cancel dis bitch, I'll buy another one
It's my world you lil squirrel tryna get a nut bitch
Do you- what bitch? Lil smut bitch
Got you're name ringin, spreadin like mustard
And I'm supposed to trust it after he touched it?

(Chorus #2)
I told dat ass +slow down+ like Puba
Now your days are gray like the 4 pound Ruga
Bread and Butter, see I was you're bread and butter
Heyyy, baby ya hips is getting big
Now you getting thin you don't care about your whip
Cuz I was you're bread and butter
Shoulda tucked that bread and butter
Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm

(Bridge being sung)
So proud, of you.. a'ye-ah
I gotta say it loud, yes I do, a'yeah (yeah yeah)
When you do (do) What you do (do)
How do you know, What you know
Aw, shame on you
I need you (oh oh)
Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm

[Verse 3 - Grand Puba]
Yeah
Now you know I was your bread and butter
You had a shot to be my baby mother
Ain't no sorry I ain't Rueben Studdard
I can't apologize, it's multi-platinum time
Takin all my shit and sendin you back to you're moms cryin
So don't cry baby dry, ya eyes
You tried to get all greasy like you super-size fries
So, pack ya shit
Leave the whip
It's been nice but listen ma I gotta defrost ya ice
Dats rite

(Chorus #2)

(Bread and Butter 4x)

*Mm Mm said repeatedly til fade to end*[Capone]
Got the Gods with me tonight!
Learn your lessons young blood!
I civilize the uncivilized
CNN enterprise, niggas in the prize
I build with the First Born, my mac squeeze
Still bringing back degrees, hustle for hustle
We needin' matching keys
I rest on the best part of the planet
Q.U., my counter top's marble and granite
I learned 120, little niggas earn from me
I trick, recoup while spendin' burnt money
I learned lessons, revolve around mathematics
Fly nigga rock' Louis V designer fabrics
Knowledge of Self, I'm one with the Gods and the Earths
Respect the shooter, 'Pone was a problem at birth
I'm a swiper, ill with the MasterCard
My coke come back white like its Master Fard
Yeah, I don't deal with the PAC math
Plus degrees, First Born get the last laugh

[Interlude]
Let me tell you 'bout this knowledge man
Let me take it down in three basic fundamentals man
Knowledge, Wisdom, and Understanding
Knowledge is to know man
Knowledge is the Black man
Knowledge is the foundation of everything in existence
Knowledge means to listen, observe and also respect
You gotta respect these lessons!

[Hook (2x): Sadat X]
Bringing the Gods back
We're try'na save some lives
Especially our babies, save the 85s
A civilized man's main goal is to teach
Where'd the Father start?  He started in the streets!

[Noreaga]
Yo you lose plus I got the ill street blues
Fuckin' red bottoms get you shot in your shoes
This is alcohol lyrics, paraphernalia flow
Grown man bars, iPhone stereo
Have you not heard your word is your bond
And your bond is your life
I sacrifice, civilized, touch nobody's wife
Still be rollin' dice, while you was praisin' fat cats in the 'jects
I would study 'bout the Father, build 'bout Clarence X
Sodom Gomorrah, you dudes the same sex
I used to be outer space like a comet
And drink Smirnoff till I vomit
Woke up in the East and payed homage
About to change my name to Salaam N.O.R.E. Muhammad
What happened?  We're supposed to be the Holy City
Bartendaz got me joggin' through the Holy City
So mind up, this is combat for brain waves
Most of y'all won't understand since you're brain slaves

[Hook][Intro]
Cancer is like a dark day
But how you think the dark comes to light?
Affects millions
Might've affected someone you know
Someone close to you, someone you love dearly
It does not discriminate
Help them to rise
Help others to rise

[Verse 1]
My man Star died from bone cancer
They couldn't find an answer
Unregulated cell growth, malignant neoplasm
Two hundred known cancers
I will explain in my stanza
To determine what causes it is so complex
This time, you get to call X
Cancer is detected in various ways
Medical imagining and screening
Show cells that grow and divide
That's why we need to get outside
Exercise is a must
Tobacco kills us
But sometimes it comes for no known reason
Chemo and radiation
A lot of people in this nation
Fight that battle every day
Thirteen percent of all human death
DNA mutations reaches all nations
Affects generations (families!)

[Verse 2]
Cancer is the great imitator
Sometimes it reveals itself much later
From a boss to a waiter
It don't discriminate
It don't discriminate
Hodgkin's disease, leukemia
Cancer of the colon and the prostate
You need to get yourself straight
Cancer of the lungs is rising
The first thing you do in the morning is buy a loose
It feel like a boost
It's a threat in that skinny cigarette
Exposed to asbestos in the air
In that jail, they wasn't playing fair
Shit was everywhere
That's why I lost two brothers that year
Lymphoma, melanoma; this little place in Oklahoma
Devoted to the study that killed Rena
And Mr. Chin, my neighborhood cleaner
Pancreatic ain't democratic
Aspirin helps seven percent
Them other medicines? How can I pay the rent?

[Verse 3]
I need to help with breast cancer
Hope this bracelet on my wrist brings an answer
I'll walk a thousand miles if it brings forth smiles
3000 BC, the Egyptians described cancer
So why we ain't got an answer?
The most common form of cancer's on the skin
It might affected your friend
Count Basie, Bob Marley, Peter Falk, Walter Payton
I'm waiting for that budget, for them big funds
So we can cure our loved ones
Save the babies, the seeds
That's what the world needs
Let's explore needs
The Race for Life could save a life for your mama
I hope this strikes a nerve
But in the news we concerned with guns and purp
Have you ever been to Ronald's House?
Take your family thereVerse One: Lord Jamar

7 in the mornin, they kickin down my momma's door
Now tell me what is this motherfuckin drama for?
Can a nigga get rest after rest without the stress?
Then they put the Glock to my chest
Best think 'fore I twitch or I'm popped
Off to the clink with this bitch ass cop
They gotta nigga locked like the dread on my head, jack
And if I try to fight back, well then I'm dead, black
I got the right to an attorney and to stay silent
They got the right to try to burn me if I play violent
I know the game so I just roll with the procedure
Illegal search and seizure, somethin that they're doin at their leisure
Down at the station, interrogation is takin place
Overcrowded jails but for me they're makin space
Tell the devil to his face he can suck my dick
It's the whole black race that they're fuckin with
Come to find my crime was lettin brothers know the time
Only the devil is stoppin me from eatin swine
And plus my prior record sealed my fate
One For All and In God We Trust got me sent upstate
But still I won't bite my tongue
I just write tight shit to incite the young, to fight the one
Who keeps them on a level that's minimum
That's the number one reason

Chorus: (sample of Luther Ingram's "I'm Tryin To Sing A Message To You")

(*They claimin I'm a criminal*)
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
(*They claimin I'm a criminal*)
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
*repeat*

Verse Two: Sadat X

I was frustrated, I can't do no more push-ups
Niggas be swole up, locked down cos of a hold-up
"The devil made me do it" is what I say
Got some bad news on my one phone call the other day
"I love the kids and I teach em to love their father
I'll get you some kicks and try to send some flicks
But it's over, baby, yes it's over"
Ain't much you can do when you're holdin a phone
A million inmates but ya still alone
You're not cryin but inside ya dyin
You might cry in the night when ya safe and outta sight
Damn I miss my peeps and the rides in the jeeps
And my, casual freedom, where's my crew when I need em?
A visit ain't the same like being in the game
But I'll take it, at least with that I'll make it
The beast is a bitch and I see it
I do the knowledge to em, so next time I can do em
"Yo X, I got ta lock it now but write me real soon
I know that you're a busy man, give me a minute"
You can never know the penal til you been locked the fuck up in it

Chorus:

This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
(*They claimin I'm a criminal*)
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
(*They claimin I'm a criminal*)
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
(*They claimin I'm a criminal*) (x12)

(*They claimin I'm a criminal*)
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
*repeat to fade*[Intro]

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on (x8)

[Verse 1: Sadat X]
Let's go deep into the phrase, feel the sun rays
Off the baldhead, everything is real
Biggie put me on this joint, so I'mma be the big wheel
Watch it spin, hey dad, placed your bet on seven
Peace to 106, 108, 110 and 111th
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm, to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an emcee wanna sing for a living
Take the beatdown we fucking giving
C'mon, motherfucker!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sadat X]
What? Niggas want drama, putting work on my block
When I told y'all last week that shit was too hot
Selling deuces and treys cuts my dimes
Somebody don't get paid, somebody's block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as ya run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo, Biggie, tell these niggas I'mma hit 'em where it hurts
The Big City, it don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or four stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey, your money, that's your stock; yo, bitch, pass the Glock
I'mma tell them, "It can happen, don't play me with that rap shit"
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Notorious B.I.G.]
I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give emcees the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable
Peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
Cause I got mo' shots to pop ya
Big Poppa, breaking you off something proper
Signing off is the hardcore rap singer
AKA crack slinger, bring it any time nigga

[Hook][Intro: Sean P, Sadat X]
[Sean P]
Peace God
[Sadat X]
Peace peace peace...

[Verse one: Sean P]
Ayyo, who the fuck beatin' the God... peepin' the God?
Groupie ho from the show, wanna sleep with the God
Wanna late-night creep with the God
Wanna fuck all night 'til she tired, count sheep with the God
She like: "Ruck, could you skeet in me, God?
Hell no, ho! You must think somethin' sweet with the God
Don't try to get deep with the God
Don't try to conversate 'n holdin' hands down the street with the God
She thinkin' about leavin' the God
I don't care, it's up to you to choose, bitch, even the ug's
Even ma squad say: "She be deceivin' you, God
She's the atheist, she ain't even believe in the Gods."
"Fatal Attraction" bitch got heat for the God
So I backsmack the left-side of the cheek on the broad
Now, I done wrote a lotta goddamn rhymes
But this time I must be outta my goddamned mind

[Hook: Buckshot]
The arm-leg-leg-arm-head - gone is your bread
With no church we pardon the dead
All praise to AKs 'n coffins
When God in the spot you see the devil often
You scared? Go to church!
You scared? Get a dog, nigga, this shit hurts!
Pardon me God, get to speak to 'em
Please show 'em the light, throw the heat to 'em!

[Verse two: Sadat X]
She say she wanna get with the God
Then got slick and tried to slip me lard
You might think that I'm hard
Give us free like "Amistad"!
Now, these dudes tryna beat the God
Like I ain't live up the block with a murderer squad
Now, these dudes is supposedly hard
But they ran to police when I pulled the rod
The actions of my calalry - broad
But I have 1 jail pass - one last card
Who in the street with the God?
Got a hundred grands, you can eat with the God
Yes, there ain't nuthin' sweet with the God
Gotta come a lil better, to compete with the God
There is a evil to God
40 in ya face leaves your snore piece charred
Dig out your pocket, snatch a lil award
Give half to Price cause we peasant of God

[Verse three: Sean P]
I heard y'all niggas bad speakin' to God
Damn! That's fucked up, it wasn't like that last week with the God
Y'all niggas wanna clap heat at the God
I ain't singin' shit - I'mma let the gat speak for the God
If your shit fat then get on a track with the God
If your shit wack you can't get on a track with the God
Fuck I look like? Y'all batch ass niggas is the shook type
Missy on the chorus, the song is wack with the hook type
Now, I done wrote a lotta goddamn rhymes
But this time I must be outta ma goddamned mind
Everybody wanna rap like the God *pff*
Go outta town 'n grab the pound 'n sell crack for the God
You ain't gotta do that for the God
All you gotta do is cop the L, peep the ??? crack for the God (Pee!)

[Hook: Buckshot]
The arm-leg-leg-arm-head - gone is your bread
With no church we pardon the dead
All praise to AKs 'n coffins
When God in the spot you see the devil often
You scared? Go to church!
You scared? Get a dog, nigga, this shit hurts!
Pardon me God, get to speak to 'em
Please show 'em the light, throw the heat to 'em!

[Outro: scratchin']
"Everybody wanna... rap with the God" [Sean P]

"The God" [Sean P]Escape from New York
Escape from New York
Escape from New York
Escape from New York
Escape from New York
Escape from New York
Escape from New York

[Sadat X]
A 21 gun salute ain't nearly enough
For some ol' shit this rough
Dedi, oh baby boy watch this picture
As we escape from New York we'll see a whole lot of fiction
Drug dealers wanna be rappers and rappers frontin' drugs
Big williness and sillyness if ya still in that room
You be tyin' up the knot on Ma dude on the floor
Tell ya I'm chillin' out here, the great X has gone dolo
Shotgun partner D.R., bring that thing P.R
So we can swing P.R., together us three we are
Tryin' to keep pace in the great rap race
New York's a crazy place, my girl just caught a case
If ya wanna feel the pleasure bring some proof and it's on
My hands now on, no higher than the warden
Came to lace up the wax with Pete and D.R. crew
From the furniture and shelf to the rollin' cliffs of Dover

[Hook x2]
Listen up son, niggas wanna talk the talk
But can ya walk the walk New York, New York
40 guns and playas, money, sex and rhyme sayers

[Dedi]
And I'm out, I'm reachin' for the bigger and the better
More advanced to the letter, type excessive with the pressure
Escapin' like some brothers with triple life
AWOL, on the run from the man I gotta plan
For real though, I wanna get this dough on the strip yo
The next plateau, movin' up young fuck a ho
And take it slow cause that's the only way to flow
I rock a show and it's back to the rest so
Stay out of my zone cause I'm stressin' effects
Seekin' stacks of those plaques
And the bommin' twenty sacks
Relax maybe when I'm lewd and lampooned
In my mansion dirty dancin' like Ace and Buchanan, jammin'
Totally the opposite of famine
Today's slammin' and you know I got to have the cannon
For all those that talk the talk
But can ya walk the walk
Escape from New York

[Hook x2]

[Sadat X]
Ah hell the great X has turned to king
Let the caged birds sing
And let the gauge take the stage
Life's a hard hump for the average man
Especially cause my skin's much darker than tan
Got damn, Uncle Sam you was in the gram
Now ya wanna front and act like you don't know about the fam
But I know what cha' doin' to me, ya can't win
Escape from New York don't bring ya ass back again

[Dedi]
So here we are, the X man, P.R. and the baby Paul
On the premises, mission is to finish this
The bonafide buggin' mic muggin' steady buggin'
Breakin' backs with stacks and no fear
Solid like stone and the family's sly
Buy and sell, live well and make bail
The single pop, hip-hop or mingle life
Just for the sport, escape from New York

[Hook x2]Check
Uh huh
Check check, y'all

Yo Whitey Ford's the name
The Hunchback of Notre Dame
Couldn't get more bent
When it's time to represent
I control it like rent
In a slum tenement
Life's hard like some men
In the concrete jungle
I don't smoke jumbo
So whatcha knockin' for
There's locks on my door
We rock from the floor
To the ceilin'
Ain't no drug dealin'
Ain't no gat peelin'
You can't fight this feelin'

Casual:
Well, My style's golden
Hot like molten rock
Niggers come bold
But leave here holdin' jock
Hiero patrol
Roll through the set on fifth
Arm's solo
Sippin' momo with a chick
Niggers take the penitentiary
Chances at the dances
Lettin' off shots
Lit off the lanterns
Mad cause a nigga can't test with no access
To phatness like this

Sadat X:
]From one story the cowboy was founded
I'm surrounded by Casual and Whitey Ford
The whole world and your girl
]From the Bay to LA
To my blue end while
I ain't tryin' to die
I'm tryin' to live
While I cool out
And pick up my daughter
When the bell says the school out
Who the hell brought tools
In this peaceful event
Now I can love you
Front you
Or we could hunt you
You played too close
Take a hit of this dose

A yes, yes, y'all
Sadat X: A freak, freak, yo
Casual: So fresh y'all
To the beat y'all
Sadat X: A yes yes y'all
Casual: We don't stop dog
We keep it rockin' till the panties drop, yo

Casual:
Uh huh, ha
I see the rappers bein' ruined
By you and whoever's doin' that
Crap, they got me booin'
In fact, I'm gettin' to 'em
May an electrical poetical surge
Give me the urge
To, consume, the tomb
And submerge
The depths of adverbs
Keep it sick
Analytical
You pitiful trick
I'm the pinnacle and the prodigal
Rhyme style's
Hip nautical
Fuck the artical
The artist is hardest
To harvest the hard shit

Sadat X:
I slave till all my work is done
I'm cashin' in
Stack up my money for a grand set
I like them all house parties rockin'
Plus I'm up in your cozy
Bitch turn your head and keep your eyes
Where they supposed to be
Supposedly I was seen with something lean, huh
Brown skin
I keep it bouncin'
I say loungin'
On the side with red wine
I know that shit on my floor ain't swine

Now back it up
Stack it up
And hit me one more time
It might be your phone call
But check it, it's my dime
And I know she's fine
But get off my line
Or I'll break that spine
And then maybe your face
You all up in my space
Like with Puffy and Mase
But that's just not the case
Cause I'm settin' the pace
While you followin' and swallowin'
Savorin' the flavor
In your audio for now
Quick suckin' my style
I'll be the man
With the large amounts of savoir-faire

CHORUS
Rock on
To the break of dawn
Just freak it
Ah yeah baby
Rock on
To the break of dawn
Just freak it
Ah yeah baby

CHORUS II (X2)
Sadat X:
Cause it's the funky beat
Cause it's the funky beat
Cause it's the funk, the funk, the funk, funky beat (beat)

Sadat X:
I'll leave a piece of my style
Flyin' high up in the air
And you'll say to yourself
Damn I'm glad I was there
This is as rare as me frickin' share
You people stare
But behind closed doors
You will take it there

Casual:
Yeah I be the extraordinare
Judge from Bayfare
To Albee Square
Tell me where the party at
I'll be there
Let her hit the coney at
Show her where to rock the pony at

I be the man
With the large amounts of sapphire fare
I'm about to cut loose
My dog so you all best beware
You can dance with flare
And get out of your chair
We be smarter than your average boo boo bear

CHORUS
Rock on
To the break of dawn
Just freak it
Ah yeah baby
Rock on
To the break of dawn
Just freak it
Ah yeah baby

CHORYS II (X4)
Sadat X:
Cause it's the funky beat
Cause it's the funky beat
Cause it's the funk, the funk, the funk, funky beat (beat)[Sadat X]
Yeah yeah, watch us turn it up for y'all
Tight broads watchin
The Guru, the great 'Dat X, and Big L
Flamboyant for life

[Big L]
Check it, a year ago, I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro, then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, Monique
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get something to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dying to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right, it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it, we was doing our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claiming she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that, I wore a Lifestyle

[Hook: Big L]
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware

[Sadat X]
I'm in the breed of the bad guy
Get caught in a mad lie, come in your crib mad high
Think about me with the smile on your face
Think about me with my hand on your waist
And think about me with your hair in your face
Even caught a case fuckin witchu
Had said some ol' slick shit, that had forced me to hit you
Had you set up livin swell, how you gon' fuck my man L
Like we don't cross paths in these New York streets?
But that's good, cause he's my man and we both shine
And to say we don't love these hoes is a old line
Honey just save some space in it so you can hold mine
Her whole spine be twisted;
Things she did and how she kissed it
I kinda missed it, think back on how we dissed it
Now we two-fisted, she ain't never resisted
Left it red and blistered, shakin
I could slam it if it wasn't NO money makin

[Hook]

[Guru]
Games, these girls now-a-days they play many
Techniques for getting your loot, they got plenty
Suck the skin off your dick, just for some ice and shit
In the beginning they're polite, actin all nice and shit
But honey got plans to be pushing your Land
When she got you - she goes and fucks your man
Understand, you gotta lay down the law
A lot of broads is fraud, they'll set you up Baby Pah
Some'll try to get you stuck up, some'll fake pregnancy
Most are after the dough, and the fame basically
Yo you can't make a ho a housewife kid
Pick the wrong chick - could be a lifetime bid
A lot of cats be beefing over these honeys
Not me I keep it moving they ain't getting jack from me
Mack these freaks for your own enjoyment
And one love to L we gon' stay Flamboyant

[Hook]

[Guru]
Yo son you better watch these little fast-ass
Little fancy-pants bitches with the thongs
Heh, that's my word
Yo, rest in peace to my man Big L, uhh
Peace to the God Sadat X
Guru, GangStarr, uhh
Hold it down[Hook: Sadat X]
Roc Marci's my man, we gon collab
GP throw the beat on the grill like a slab
We gon eat
My man P say "give 'em hands and feet"
I think we will
Every shot got to be a kill, no survivors
All of your riders get hit in the brain
Me and Roc Marci, who could fit in this lane?

[Verse 1: Sadat X]
A collab's supposed to be fab
Off the rip, it should grab
Pulsate and nab your ear drums
The song now becomes part of your daily
Rotate in the car, iPod and the crib
Should be food for the ribs
Subject to background check
Respect given only if you stay driven
Show how you living
Your aura
Not some shit you threw in the drawer
And pulled out on a studio date
Done right it could be a classic
Done wrong and its an ordinary song
I can't afford that
The song is a bullet
And if i get pressed i have to pull it
You know it has to be a kill
Bring out captains, lieutenants
Evacuate the tenants
Alert the media
Social networks and the internet jerks
A little controversy, it works
It awakens the masses
Me with my glasses

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Nobody, but me and the god Dadi
Ride the track on the trolley
Flow as a glass at the Sony
The lab is the after party
His the ass or the graphic with the sharpie
Moving with the brothers rocking rugby's
Bubbly
Living up hitting spliffs getting chubby
Sessions with the legends, Porsche 911's
With expression
We used to make the same as James Evans
Throw another Heinekein back
The line's wire tapped
Fire the mac that inspired the rap
The fire caps your dime like a Bermuda fly trap
Light the dime bag
Spit it nice, never rhyme bad
And mix the ice with the Cognac
This is historic, dipped the dicks in Taurus
You fucking with the two top scorers[Convict 2/Sadat X]
Oh my goodness! Look what they sendin through nowadays
Ah, it's a light-weight
And he got a smirk on his face like it's all of that
Yeah, well we gone see what it is

[Convict 1/Xzibit]
What you in for, everything under the sun
Recently, got me first degree wit a hot gun
That's my third strike, so Xzibit can't go home
Fight to see Daylight like Sylvester Stallone
Don't ask too many questions nigga, keep that on the d-low
My family might mistake you for an undercover C-O
Last one that tried didn't make it past bookin
Five times in the neck when everybody was lookin

[Convict 2/Sadat X]
You see the judge, but he don't budge
That's you're third felony, I believe strike three
Remanded and stranded, to the cold steel granite
Lost to the world, your moms and your girl
Keep your weight up, or your ass get ate up
Cats is stickin, straight up
Wit the shank, get more time in the tank
Ask Hank, he bout to bank, killed a cop wit high rank
They gave him life and now another cat is fuckin his wife

[Convict 1/Xzibit]
Just because I'm locked down don't mean the hustlin stop
Her-oine and beer joints twenty dollars a pop
You a new recruit, so today I'm lettin you slide
But tomorrow you'll be confronted wit the two's in the side
If you a smart mothafucker, you'll be fallin wit mine
Behind bars, no bitches and cars, we only got time
We're I'm from, time is money and got neither to waste
Once in a while catch a Cannanite in the wrong place
BEAT HIM DOWN, break the strongest hand, piss in his face
Strike fear, play the rear, 'fore he catchin a case
Low-class, got a dozen free visitors pass
Plus the female C-Order wanna give me some ass

Chorus [Sadat X] 2x
This is your new home boss, where you survive at all costs
And if you don't, well it's only your loss
You're only here cuz you tried to force and be the boss, ha
Handle your time like a man yo

[Convict 1/Xzibit]
So it's my twenty-third birthday, drinkin Pruno
You know no matter what it take, we gotta celebrate
Fuck stayin straight, hair braided by this Muslim cat
Regulate the whole yard, now we got the straps
Niggas say "Who the fuck is that?"
The X-Man, rowdy, gettin treated like the feds in the county
Correctional facilities, basically you don't wanna fuck wit these
Murders and felonies keep you company ("YEAH!")

[Convict 3/Kid Creole]
And yes y'all, come on in ("YEAH")
All you brand new heffer, sissy, soft booty-ass shook niggas ("YEAH")
Yeah bitch, welcom to central booking ("YEAH")
A sleep-over for pimps, private hustlers ("YEAH"), drug slingers, and gun
Clappers
Even bitch-ass, shook-ass niggas ("YEAH") like y'all
Get on your ?("YEAH"), get out the blood on your ?married character?
Kitten-ass faces ("YEAH"), niggas about to beat you all down to the last stop
*echoes*

[Convict 2/Sadat X]
I'm all good, as I telephone my hood
At first I was shook, tried to play by the book
But you can't bid your time by stayin in the cell
I'm gettin high everyday like I was still on the corner
Where I'm in fat pink caps, New York to California
Makin deals for mills, holdin cigarette lottos
Givin cats pills, and tell em "Yo try those!"
Niggas try to scheme but my team is tight
We as shady as the night and bring fright to sight
Hey you be aight, but don't act like a sucka
Ain't you ain't got to be the wildest mothafucker
Use control, put a cat in whole if he's broke
And let em know, I just wanna serve my time and go
And flow, lay low, try to grab some dough
Aiyyo I ain't tryin to jail, somebody post my bail

Chorus

[Convict 2/Sadat X] (Convict 3/Kid Creole)
Yo man shhh, I need some new kicks man
(Oh what? Oh shut the fuck up!)
Somebody got some at least some money man (Nigga what!)
Or something man, I ain't get no letters man
(You gone be my bitch tonight, what)
Niggas forgettin about me man
(I'll poke y'all, don't come on the island)
Namsayin, supposed to be my crew
(Don't be on the island when I get there)
Can't even make collect phone calls
(Mothafucker, what ah um!)
Tryin to jam my collect calls now
(You will be mines tonight mothafucker!)
Nobody ain't home, nobody wanna write me (Mine you hear me!)
I ain't got nuttin to read, yaknamsayin
(You'll be mine tonight mothafucker!)
Ain't nobody put no money on my book
(Don't fall asleep tonight bitch!)
It's like I'm starvin in here
This ain't no funArtist: House of Pain f/ Sadat X
Album:  The Truth Crushed to Earth Shall Rise Again
Song:   Heart Full of Sorrow

If I was to sit down and actually write out a list
Of the MCs that missed it would be the constitution
They play their caps backwards still saying wack words
No power to (durhust) just a few yes men
Raising the question of who gave you a contract
They should be fired youre officially retired

I see you make a little cash and start showing your ass
You get laced up with jewels your crews acting like fools
Playing hard rock surrounded by body guards
Hoping no one pulls your cord you got me laughing pretty hard
Thinking youre the white hot man of the hour
But you just can't figure how your flavor went sour
Back in 89 PE fought the power and in 86 Big Daddy Kane was raw

And I was right there on the first floor of the Palladium
You never played a venue local college or a stadium
A young boys (fiddin pad) fad is now a grown mans profession
To earn this is a blessing
This skills have me guessing learn cause Im testing
Follow this down no question

No doubt check it out
You be either rhyming in code or on some gangster node
You all clockwork apocalypse you about to implode
Collapsing on yourself cause your whole foundation is
Built on lies dont apologize
Cause once they watch you rise they wanna watch you fall
And theyll all take a piece just like the Berlin wall
And place it on their mantle like a souvenir
And what they call a knick-knack is really your career

Chorus

You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they dont like the demo make a new one tomorrow
You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they dont like the demo make a new one tomorrow


When its time to rise Ill open the archives
When you be in dreams you got 85s
Chrome down with the leather package
You got a home of your own
Youre holding acres
I got it made
Season tickets to the Knickers and the Lakers
Playing both coasts closed and European festivals
Crowd scream decibels x2
In your ear you wanna make rapping your career

From Arkansas to Minnesota I sell out the quota
I be the wet dream making cream for promoters
We keep the shit right we dont be starting no fights
And he won't hold out my dough cause Im a put out his lights
And once the crew hits the stage the crowd gets involved
We show love they show it back all problems solved
You can boom shalock and jump to the sounds I pump
But I ain't quitting till Im shitting on Donald Trump

So take heed to the verses and styles and versions
When you socialize with other MCs
And boast your rhymes to company enemies
And in any cases that feel is what you want
???
You want to make money money and take every honey
Rap charges ain't funny but it boost your career
Your penile style is now hanging from a tier
Now you wanna know fear to impress your peers
Now your ass outta here the rap game goes on[Hook]
Here I am
After so many years

[Verse 1]
Niggas tried to dead the God
But instead, the God did a flip
I'm not a Blood or a Crip
I don't need no gang shit to get a grip
It's 8 AM, I'm writing lines
It's 8 AM, you sleeping behind the blinds
I'm not a 'need to belong' nigga, I'm God
The sun don't shine on you, you wondering why that's odd?
I been to Yale, been to jail, they both have they place
I ain't no battle rapper, nigga, you better not spit in my face
You fighting a case, I'm fighting life
Stress make your hair fall out, strife
Niggas that walk with you, make sure they got heart
Half these niggas I never seen at the start
Yeah they royal, but when shit go down, are they loyal?
I'm hell and high water, monsoons
Billion winters and billion Junes

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You ever took a bath in Brazil
With two bad bitches with bodies that kill?
You on the couch, you wanna chill
That's your hallmark? That's your motherfucking skill?
You stay frozen in time
Remember in Miami we had it frozen with lime?
I might not be car for car, but I'm bar for bar
Nothing would ever diminish my star
I'm the rapper's rapper, but first I'm your man
I wear my heart on my sleeve as sure as I stand
Whether we go to war for a penny or a grand
Whether we up top or in this hot south land
I won't back down an inch
Teams is marked in history, how they react in a pinch
Understand that, yo, let's build a legacy, a dynasty

[Hook]
