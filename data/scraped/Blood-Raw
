[Hook]
Gangsta shit gangsta shit the way I do my thang gansta shit
Gangsta shit I'm just a young ghetto nigga with a big azz chain

[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]
You recreate a shield you betta respect us

My niggas add flavor to the game like zeteran

[Verse 3: Blood Raw]
Errbody claim reson errbody kno the game

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Cali gon cali ridin tall in his saddle

I'm a dirty south legend and thou shall honor the team
From the land of the long hard
Where we home sellin D
Get that dirt weed local

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
This one's for you and I ain't talkin Bud Light
HK nigga with that little red light
Whole club bouncin, errbody strapped up
Pull it out my pants and make errbody back up
Fuck a record deal, the boy just too real
Watch him cook it on the stove, man the boy got skills
Streets is talkin, whole hood's whisperin
Careful what I say cause I know them folks listenin
It's your boy Mr. Seventeen-Five
My lil mamma hold the strap and the work while I drive
Take it out the wrap and I put it on the scale
But keep that on the low cause I ain't tryna go to jail

[Hook] (X2)

[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]
They call me Slick Manning cause my vision's great
Toss shells like pigskins when I squeeze the eight
Think I start for the Braves, way I rep the A
Like John Smoltz in his prime when I pitch the K
Got the scale in my pocket on a suicide grind
Yams in the strap facin suicide time
Outlandish wit it man, it's stupid how we shine
Catch me in them bunkers with them troops all the time
I eat like Saddam but I'm sick like Uday
Keeps some youngsters with me and they all bout gunplay
We been had the streets jammed up to stock
We down south niggas but the plugs up top

[Hook] (X2)

[Verse 3: Blood Raw]
This for gangstas, I ain't talkin bout you busters
Chopper toters, money getters, naw not you suckers
Cooler than a fan, colder than a freezer
Still in the hood, ridin sixes on the Regal
Still on MLK, still got a side
Still get money and I'm still in the trap
Lil mamma say she like me plus she know I'm hood
I'm a fool with laying pipe, and she know I'm good
I got a spot for the yay, Uncle Pete keep the K's
Auntie Shirley got the money, if they rush then we straight

[Hook: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started

And boy we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you know
Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So you betta mind where you walking
God damn man can to your target
Nothin can save you know

[Bun B]
See you dun push the wrong button
And Cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka it was mine
Time and time they get me out the tandem
Me are da true

For caveman king
You don't wanna fuck with the Southside Gotcha boys
Ya'll ain't know trill ass niggas
Ya'll some boxy boys
And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

[Blood Raw]
I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet
I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks
I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the Street life
Homie I live
Wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top
East to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled
Nigga we the Best

[Hook: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy we don't care who you calling

[Ace Hood]
Khaled go let me see em
Hand me the fucking clever
Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the Evel Knievel people
Who try to stunt
Call me Danny Glover
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel
Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon shoot a hundred rounds
Bdddddddddddddah
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

[Brisco]
I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old chevy and figuro
Blood shed apart my feet
And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye
Ring the Alarm
Tell em people come come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun YEAH!

[Bali]

Like suicide doors
Any badass niggas
Y'all scared of that lake

[Hook: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started

And boy we don't care who your callin

At least a certain percentage of the world (uh-huh)
Anyway (hahahaha)
Can I talk my shit? (talk that shit)
Sure I can (talk that shit, talk that shit)
Cause ain't nobody gon' do nothin about it anyway... a-ha-HAHHHH!
(Talk that shit, talk that shit, Jada talk that SHIT, ohh!)

You could tell the way I stack my money (I'm somethin else!)
Nah, I ain't one of them dummies (I'm somethin else!)
Tre's, nick's, dimes and twenties (I'm somethin else!)
The way I get it in with the honeys (I'm somethin else!)

[Verse One: Jadakiss]
Yo, you know I love to style on ya, blue 40-caliber
Butterfly doors on the triple black challenger
And I'm still in and out, got it so I'm spendin out
Dope boy, so I never have a problem in a drought
Don't take, too much work if you can't manage that
Just in case you run out of empties, use sandwich bags
Play with the hand you was dealt
That's why I ride the track 'til it melt
I could care less how you feel, how you felt
I done spent niggas rent money on belts
Threesomes in the trunk, I'm fuckin for the wealth
And the hood ask about me, I'm somethin else

[Hook: Jadakiss] + (Fiend)
You could tell the way I stack my money (I'm somethin else!)
Nah, I ain't one of them dummies (I'm somethin else!)
Tre's, nick's, dimes and twenties (I'm somethin else!)

Still representin the block (I'm somethin else!)
And you ain't got to tell me I'm hot (I'm somethin else!)
I'm exactly what they not (I'm somethin else!)
Hahh (I'm somethin else!) AH-HAHHH! (I'm somethin else!)

[Young Jeezy - over Hook]
C.T.E. nigga... yeah!
Yeah! Let's go

[Verse Two: Young Jeezy]
I ain't even did nothin, feelin like I'm traffickin
See these blood diamonds, sir, my chain African
Speakin of my chain, yeah it need to get a job
Get the fuck up off my neck, Senator Barack
Whatever that you do, look, don't get caught
That stash get low, ya ass might get bought
Okay I'm over it, let's talk about somethin else
I said I'm over it, I think I bought somethin else
That's why I live e'ry day (day) like a thug holiday
+Suffocate+ a nigga about mines - J. Holiday
Quick to make a movie 'bout my Doc Holiday
It's why I'm strapped 365, even holidays, yeah!

[Hook]

[Verse Three: AP]
Yeah... I'm somethin else with myself they say
WWF, push that featherweight
Big boy toys, of course the shoe's right
See the 22's reflect from the moonlight?
Barry White, or Walter Cronkite?
Couple cold words when you talk 'bout birds
You ain't talkin 'bout green, you ain't talkin 'bout me
{*phone rings*} Hold up, this your bitch on my caller ID

[Verse Four: Blood Raw]
You could tell I'm somethin else, pussy nigga do the math
Just look at me nigga; you can't tell I got cash?
Got together so fruity, 26 inches
(Girl, ain't that Blood Raw?) You can't tell I got bitches?
I'm a three summer soul survivor
Tell me have you ever met a nigga that's real as the bible?
You could tell I'm addicted to paper
And if it ain't my clique I'm like Maino, FUCK YOU HATERS!

[Hook]

[Verse Five: Boo Rossini]
Yo, aiyyo
Any situation involvin paper I'm all in
Pull up on your block, old school sittin on all rims
Still keep them semis on deck in case I'm tested
And gotta do a nigga dirty, turn him to a mess quick
Chest all hangin out, everybody screamin out
I grew up in a house, where damn near e'rybody fiendin
So don't ask, why I hold me the pen on my fuckin self
If I pop through and you come back I'mma hit you with somethin else

[Verse Six: Snyp Life]
I'm somethin else the way I come off, bars that make 'em run off
Rippin up his back but the strap'll tear your front off
Neck slump and run through your boss, he tried to jump off
It's D-Block, we treat every town just like it's New York (D-Block!)
Cross the whole game like my verses do the track
Push the pen like a pack and let it work through the trap (Snyp!)
Get your roof cut, ace hit by shooter's that'll spray shit
And if it ain't the ruger shit'll melt you and your face split

[Verse Seven: Bully]
Okay, Bully bitch!
Uhh, I'm somethin else, run through niggas like Phelps
D-Block's next generation explains itself (D-Block!)
You don't wanna FUCK with Bully the don-dada
Name ring bells in the hood, a known shotter
You gets nada when it comes to my ricotta
Fresh Levi's, black V-necks and Pradas
I'm a problem for niggas if nothin else
Control, substitute or police, I'm somethin else

[Hook][Intro]
This it right here homie (say it ain't so)

One thing about Raw, Raw got swag
Raw hit the mall, then Raw pop tags
Raw stay clean, Raw stay french
You know it must be '87, denim jeans (are guess)
I bought 'em in Miami, ship them broads upto Duvall
Must of had 20 chickenheads up in that Uhaul
I move so smooth cause them jackboys backtrack
Half a quarter mill in the brown Louie napsack

Make the dubs spin around and roundhouse somebody

The only nigga in the drought with a 19 ticket (Lets get it)
