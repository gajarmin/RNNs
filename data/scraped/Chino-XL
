[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip Hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars driving slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned, styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is coming look around your town is crumbling
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leaving MCs listless
On the Wake Up Show, make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher, partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9ne's vilde!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house through the front window
And heard this guy shout, "Hey that's my couch"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm ripping this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flipping vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breaking so many freaking needles, I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake Up
The X-Man, catch me doing drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting from high noon till the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was, when I cut ya neck
Leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon and spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinning like lead from out the  Heck and K
Tearing your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate
Until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to but what you gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you but what you gon' do
Rev can give it to you but what you gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fucking up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style foul file sexual harassment like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fucking murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show repping with Sway and Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One coming with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willing to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willing to bet, on a Sway and a Tec, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gaining respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just seckle
Ha-ha-ha, fresh for 1999 you suckers[Bell Rings]

[Intro - Chopped and Screwed Voice -Talking]
Hey, now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up!
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit - get the fuck out!
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit - get the fuck out!
For those who love raw shit - welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is: Tech N9ne!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
This is style, I use pitch to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick, mellow tone is what you spit
Switchin' the pattern, bust out that quick Midwest chatterin'
Some people hate but it ain't matterin', but the people gather, it's flatterin'
Switchin' the pitch, mixin', there's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin' full clips on a mission for bliss when I be rippin' this shit
Make it exciting, got to be inviting when you're writing your piece
Never be dick riding, if you're going to be biting, you're igniting the beast
This is melodic, melodies if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales, you singin' off-key, it's garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, you need to stop it
Have confidence, speak with conviction
Don't put 'em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony, Nina's taking you through it
Make it buttery, utterly beautiful, make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin' motherfuckers in music, that's how we do it!

[Hook]
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat [x3]
Such an oddity with it, this is Sickology
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat [x3]

From our West Coast instructor: Crooked I

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
My killer Cadence can keep me crushin' the competition
Comin' correct when creatin' the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier, got a crooked copper missin''
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty - if I'm thirst-ay!
I change the pronunciation of words, per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap, this is how (this is how)
Right now I'm puttin' swag in my style (in my style)
It's an emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (and a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, this song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire

[Hook]

From our East Coast instructor: Chino XL

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
Everybody start lockin' their windows and doors, Chino might get in
It's like light-ning, how I'm strikin' a triflin' rifleman
Bullets flyin' up and I'm numbin' the bum, like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine, he could get rich from the recycling!
Chino be curdlin' blood, don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction, like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, industry hate me yo
I'd rather hear Hannah Montana than half of you rappers on the radio!
Startin' drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, that's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
With a sick delivery, like I drive a coroner van
I'm demented, spittin' writtens as sick as I can
Grenade grippin', fittin' to detonate Disneyland
I am teachin' Sickology, try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna

[Hook]

Yes I got to be vicious, this is Sickology

For those who don't know what the fuck's goin' on
This is Sickology 101, you punk motherfuckers!
Hahaha, let's kill these niggas[Verse 1: Chino XLs]
You prayed for me and I came, how far you niggas wanna push me?
I'm leaving the crowds happy like OJ Simpson when he got his first white pussy
But I'm still annoyed, blow through your solenoid
Bringing more Blues to Brothers than Jon Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
Governmently engineered like Ebola for this rap garage sale
By this industry, I'm trying not to get fucked like 2Pac in jail
You can hate me, but await me like I'm Magic Johnson's death
In a box with Jordan's pops that ass'll never take another breath
Cause, I write the songs like Barry Manilow
I like my sugar brown like Hugh Grant, fuck D'Angelo

[Ras Kass]
Now I got niggas claiming they saw God unfortunately
He wasn't in the person of Master Farad Muhammad
Some often ask how can this nigga molest the English alphabet
In one hundred words or less it ain't the chronic
It's all in the mind like Johnny Mnemonic
Before my word is born, surgeons administer antibiotics
To drain the phonics, amniotic fluids
Delivery, to get Nia deep in your Peeples like Howard Hewett
Half-Hitler, half-Jewish, I'm gassed off myself, nigga

[Chino XL]
Iconoclismic, twisted without the use of fiber optics
Knocked his eyeballs out the sockets I got your Adam's Apples in my pockets
Blow shit like Timmy McVeigh, like kiddie porn I'm getting popular

[Ras Kass]
Popular, no ocular, MCs perp particular, but not quite yet perpendicular
Compound fractures fibulas when niggas step, contest the upper torso
I got Chino's back like a dorsal fin
Comprehend, we bend men from within

[Hook: Chino XL and Ras Kass]
Your strength in numbers couldn't hit
The yellow nigga from the Gravity click
You don't give a fuck as long as bud gets lit
You're fucking with the homicidal lunatics
Like licorice, niggas begin to twist
Lay back and watch your idols get ripped
Yo signify if your crew roll thick
Yeah, East Coast, West Coast, beeeotch

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
I circumnavigate the globe with a one-liner like, latitude
Put my rhymes in mixed fortune cookies to leave Confucius confused
The day a nigga serve Ras is when faggots start straight bashing

[Chino XL]
Without Jermaine Dupri I'm so so def that I need closed captions
Won't see me stressed from no East/West conflict
The interest Chino X/Ras Kass like Lance Ito removed you from your bench
My retina expands, my brain is trapped like a rat on a running wheel
Praise the yellow God or I'ma leave you scarred like that nigga Seal
Vernacular understandable, you in a hearse, megahertz, the truth hurts
Slang botanical, you're moving on time-lapse camera
Indestructible, dig me like an excavation multiracial valuable
Take you out like Saafir took out Casual

[Ras Kass]
So check the milk that Jersey made, I turn Autistic children bilingual
On parallel bars I create new dismounts like Chechincko

[Chino XL]
So keep it short and sweet like Sherman Hemsley bonafide queer
While I shoot shit up you're shooting gerbils up your asshole like Richard Gere

[Ras Kass]
Bitch ass niggas what see I gives a fuck who's certified platinum or gold
Cause I got rhymes for every unit you sold
Your plaques corrode when I collage colloquials
At first the buzz was local but now the nose grows like Pinocchio
No lie, no T-H-C, T-H-E, T-H-O-U-G-H-T makes me high in intelligence quotient
I drop fax like Hitachi, exfoliate rap and come cleaner than Jeru's enema
What's the secret within my esophagus is discovered like Tutankhamen's sarcophagus
I got niggas looking for Webster's like George Papadopolous

[Chino XL]
Yo Ras pardon me my unfamiliar soliloquies, similes
Similar to Reginald Denny's, facial injuries
You couldn't locate my transient thoughts with lo-jack
Molest your mind like Oprah Winfrey's behind when she was a small child
Punchlines with more elasticity than Biggie's stretch marks
Chino X sparks, mad urban
I ain't scared to put the things that going around me on tape like Mark Fuhrman
Sexing picture perfect hoes like Pocahontas often
And I'd rather hear Willie Nelson than fucking Montell Jordan

[Hook]

[Outro: Chino]
Uhh, yeah
Uhh, signify, uhh
Uhh, check it out, uhh
West coast, uhh, East coast, what
West coast, East coast
West, uhh, East, ahh
Uhh, that nigga Ras, that nigga Chino
The nigga Bird, yo that shit is large[Hook]
Perfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes
Back in the 1800s, I was burned at the stake
Metaphor Mephistopheles
Degrees I’ve achieved
The brain fluid it takes to believe would equal the seven seas
I could reveal the true name of God but you would go insane upon hearing it
Release enough winds to blow down pyramids
I’m the Michelangelo of syllable
Since I freestyle Genesis been Biblical
That’s something you got to give in to

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
Since born in my Mama vaginal sauna
As a sono-gram, I been fond of phonics
It’s ironic, even as an embryonic
Fed through an umbilical don’t that sound Biblical
I’ve been a terror since I teareth out of the u-ter-us
Because evil plans were made to defeat us as a fetus
Though now I walk in infamy
As a child they had it in for me
Was raised with guns in infantry in diapers and in infancy
The childhood of a hood that was raised in the hood
Cops said, put your hands in the hot sky
I put my hands down on the hot hood
I can’t whine or drink wine
Nine planets planned it
Til it became apparent
My parents shouldn’t have been a parent
State to state we ran some, I wasn’t worth no ransom
Money, won’t you hand some, a nigga wasn’t handsome
Raised the mind like Charles Manson’s
New I was some man’s son but which one
That made me strong, created my poison tongue

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
While you cut school cause you ain’t feel too good
I cut school cause my cuts ain’t heal too good
Through all the physical abuse
My mind escaped through the gift of wordplay
I memorized encyclopedias and dictionaries
I wrote anthems from antonyms
Harmonies from homonyms
Created cinema from synonyms
Was livid to eliminate that illustrious life you’re living in
Wrote rhetoricals in rhythms
I could paralyze with a parable
Make rhymes out of religion
Crucify you with a prefix
Or suffocate you with a suffix
Wrote lectures so infectious
They’re known to infect the listeners
Who dissing us
Yo punks you wait, I punctuate
My karma’s the comma
That put you inside of a coma
Hyphen, dot dot, semi-colon
Leave you semi-swollen
Question mark: You pregnant?
Oh you’re not, I love you, Period
To sum it up, language is my essence
Fucked up in all my adolescence
Till my moms was out of lessons
Laws, I store convenient
Still I rob a convenience store
Love Mom, Fuck Mom shit, I don’t love me no more
Mentally it didn’t register, bitch
Empty the register, bitch
You just a cashier, bitch
Give the cash here
Or I’ll shoot you in your cabbage
Hijack a getaway cab, bitch
Words ain’t making me no loot
Don’t change now Dow Jones average
Regardless, we’re Godless
They stole my innocence
In a sense, the judge sentenced me
To three lifetimes sentences
To write my life and times in sentences
Art my dark archnemesis
They want me off the premises, that’s what the premise is
Locked on a tier where you can’t shed a tear at
I studied more Shakespeare than any African shakes a spear at
And the whole world fears that and it hurts
I got caught killing time but then I got away with words

[Hook]

[Bridge]
People can say whatever they want about me
But agree that I am the Wordsmith
They can try to ignore everything that I’ve achieved
But agree that I am the Wordsmith
I am the Wordsmith
The love of words is deep in my veins
Must be to silence my pain
I am the Wordsmith

[Verse 3]
I’m in a game full of morons
And they keep putting more on
I tutor the Torah
I’m in the core of the Koran
The mind’s what I represent
And emcees better re-present
I’m taking this rapping bullshit to the fullest extent
I have reservations why Indians are on reservations
Told that board of education I was bored of education
As far as this go, I leave you deader than disco
Rocking sex and violence over sax and violins
Through your mind's camera lens
You’re in need of an ambulance
I’ll knock you to the asphalt, it’s your own ass fault
Your last thought, I’ll never sell myself short to be famous
And taking it up the anus just ain’t us
The world could get the penis of this classically trained pianist
My P.O. was p.o.’d handed me a cup, told me to pee in this
The linguist musician
My college position is that my intuition
Told me I wouldn’t be affording tuition
My education’s all on my own
So I might have been born yesterday but I rhyme like there’s no tomorrow

[Hook][Hook]
I know it gets no better than this
When I'm on my Detroit, New Jersey, Los Angeles shit
That's it
I have a whole crowds pumping their fist
Feeling like it when we was kids
It'd be bliss
If I had one wish
I'd have Proof and J.Dilla both back in this bitch
I miss
You let the weed smoke flow from your chest
And thank God that hip hop exists
When I spit

[Verse 1]
And now back with a vengeance
But you'se like Oprah Winfrey with a thousand Steadmans
Break you open like a crab and picking off the [?]
Blessed making a living, my show's an essence
Having lots of women in attendance
Listening to this murderous race of creature infecting all time itself
Just with my vibe assistance
Please don't try this at home
Drums sounding like Hannibal's elephants marching on their way to conquering Rome
And the patron saint of vain giving a fuck what a hater think
Whipping your ass like Marvin Gaye's dad when he would cross-dress and drink
Leaving a residue of death and destruction in this edifice
Clipping the wings off Pegasus
Restlessness from the absence of a trusted mother's gentleness
Cash up her stash stick it in Burt Reynold's shit
Monstrous, no conscious
Collabing with the ghost of rappers
I've killed that death hasn't been fast enough to process yet
Throwing bitches out of moving cars like Gucci Mane
It's all fun and games until a Chino versus plan
I'll push your face in the desert and watch your lungs expand
Filling up with sand
Shaking like radiation that's leaking from Japan
Paying for my karmic debt
Like Christians in the Colosseum singing while lions tearin' you to shreds
It's colder than Pittsburgh, this spic's disturbed
The women whisper, it's Mr. Disappear With Your Sister
Prepare to be in the air when Gabriel's horn blows
But Malakai ain't got nothing on the evil under these cornrows
Your cars spinning with chrome's not a significant goal
I'm guiding the flesh with the flows like Leviticus chose
Your frail brittle (?) nose gets finished and exposed
Get exposed sitting on a Venice throne of skin and skulls
Chino's back, and it's the illest situation
It's like the second coming of Christ and every Latino celebrating

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Still carrying them cyanide capsules
If we collide I'm beating the ink outta your tattoos
The bonafide Jesus, divine statue
Ravenous like baboons in a bad mood with scalpels
Beat a racist judge bloody with his own gavel in the study
Tie him up in the bathroom, he steady trying to make an apology
Psychology anomaly never did it for bank roll
Fuck Mayan calendars the world can't end till Chino say so
Keep making my enemies' women adore me
They be like stop hating on Chino before my birthday
Please take me to see him performing
Homie just listen you're respected in the end
I know your eyes can only see what your mind's prepared to comprehend
My pen's the solution
My heart's an aquarium full of sharks dying of pollution (get him)
Get in the way of me feeding my daughters
You'll be leaking internal organs in alphabetical order
A revolutionary predator extra terrestrial dangerous monster
You a predator pervert and Chris Hansen ought to hunt ya (kill him)
Catch you I kill you on ya city block, get really robbed
For the petty blot you said on that shitty blog
Have you taking off jewelry like it's burlesque
Roadkill nigga, tire tracks across your bird chest
Your humor is silly thinking it's sweet until I came
Painting the front of your momma's house with your dead remains
I'm the dark mythical god with physical strength that's epitomized
Could push my handprints in the Walk of Fame after the cement dries
My place in history's established, my quotables acid
In heaven my name's engraving on Moses stone tablets
That's your pen in my casket
I'll scribble on hell's fabric
Unlock me from Pan's Labyrinth
And whoever said you could rhyme, they lied
It's ugly like the maid
That Schwarzenneger had a baby by, on the side
Got a love for hip-hop that could never be lost
Even if it ignores me like the media ignored slavery and Armenian holocaust
Because I push the limits and pivot the spirit
That'll passionate poetic lyricist with progressiveness
I've written serious limitless sick poetic symbolous images
With no mainstream encouragements
But I've had the pleasure of
Working with Dilla and Proof
And that's enough for one life to carry on

[Hook][Intro: Chino XL]
Chapter and verse from the Bad Man Bible

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
I swear, massacre should be at least my middle name
I'm a beast with fangs that'll maim and I am immune to pain
I maintain with a brain that is clinically insane
Biologists never seen nothing like it, it's a new strain
At a cellular level, cold as the Ukraine
And modern science is too young for Chino to be explained
His fame is so for the birds it feels like I'm growing wings
And haters look so small from where I am, in the clouds and things
Y'all like bitches do anything to get my attention
I'm inflicting brutality, banned from Geneva Conventions
They wanna cut me out of history but I ain't dying
My heart is fire, my mind is water, my body's iron
Sound the siren, the tyrant giant that'll never tire
God's child out of wild, defying the empire
Surviving those that conspire against Ghetto Vampire
Sick control freaks like Beyonce's father
Smarter to know these cowards hold they stand astounding
Genius level, should be performing wearing a cap and gown
Mentally disturbed, disturb me, get your family buried
My heart's an empty cavity that can only be filled in by murder
Stomp your fucking face till you bleed from every orifice
Make your life a living hell till the Devil's paying me mortgage
Witness, I got a brain sickness that's twisted
As Lawrence Taylor in that crack hotel with underage bitches
Hoping God grant me leniency, turned all my pain into strength
They could sell my tears at a GNC
I try to stay healthy, right and keep my physique tight
And black don't crack, nor will my Puerto Rican side
I hate people, I shake lethal, the straight strange cerebral
Possess the trait to facilitate great evil
Lyric Jesus surrounded by his seven disciples
Singing songs of survival from Bad Man Bible

[Hook x2: Chino XL]
Bible, have you ever heard about the Bad Man Bible?
Tell you about the killer and his 12 disciples
That's why we come in pumping rifle
Bad Man Bible

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
The real nightmare is here, embarrassing
Making your bad dreams look like nursery rhymes in comparison
I spit gospel when speaking
Rappers are angry like Superhead with lockjaw on All-Star Weekend
You can hear it and feel it in your spirit that death's approaching
My rhymes are inflammatory, someone get the Ibuprofen
Been groping in darkness but my time's now
Fuck milk cartons, they'll be stenciling your face on live cows
Stop Chino, they know that they better kill him
Or I'm finding and turning they porno movies to a snuff film
My scribbling is the equivalent of shivering children
That were trapped and sealed in a Haitian building
But the faith was never given in
My venom that I'm penning like grinning jack-o-lanterns
Lit and flickering, niggas running like gingerbread men taking insulin
You don't want an incident, you're tripping with the wrong one
That's self inflicted suicide like Marie Osmond's son
Crazier than any man breathing a feeling that divert me
Put that on a list of what I don't have, next to AIDS and mercy
I stay in controversy, that's cursed as pagan worship
Reverse of the perfect murder as hermit preaching a sermon
That's currently birthing the urban servants serving certain persons
Slicing and sacrificing virgins there is evil lurking
Blood in the sand, I'm here to fulfill God's plan
Write my name on your palm, I'm a problem on your hands

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
The most passionate, blasphemous, lyric Lazarus
Sew you into a snuggie with hungry rats in it
Apart from the partially awkward larceny
See this heartfelt artistry? Mortally, I free the God in me
I give an MC instant sympathy like crippled amputees
From botched carpentry trying to singlehandedly try they hand at archery
Whispers in blood, Bad Bible bury my sinning in ink
I think I could inseminate a seminary
It's scary, walking with a pound even when not needed
And these stigmatas that I got, don't know how to stop bleeding
The heathen, heaving, more wicked than any man breathing
Articulately speaking, you're thieving, shrinking, it ain't worth repeating
For any petty, measly reason I'm wild sick
Your body won't even have a bone left to make a wish with
The explicit misfit, killer instinct, mystic Christian
Spit at this thing, try to diss me, hang you from ceiling like P!nk
Picture perfect, sinister, keeping the devil nervous
Writing verses, making you reconsider your life purpose
Every time I hear your name it's from getting punked
You worse than a pussy cause a pussy only bleeds once a month
I get drunk and high, take peyote, skydive
Hit the ground after hallucinating, thousands of lines
They want the lyric god dead even the best try
My CDs in This Nigga's Crazy section at Best Buy

[Hook x2][Intro] [Apathy talking]
Yeah, you know we came up on an era where everybody was original
Had to have their own style and shit. Now everybody tryin' to sound like everybody else

[Scratch Hook] [x4]
"I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles ain't raw" - Dice Raw 'The Lesson Part II'

[Verse One] [Apathy]
It's like I conjured demons
Got bitches at my concert screamin'
Like a naval recruiter they truly want the semen/sea men
Rip MCs at the seams leaved 'em stomped as cement
I bring these motherfuckers hell if they don't repent
Give 'em aneurysms when I start usin' big words
So I speak to 'em real simple to 'em like Big Bird
This has been brought to you by the letter "A"
Better pray you get away when I let Beretta's spray
Get erased, get replaced real quick in this rap biz
Like the long answers on a second grade math quiz
Stick to simplifying for you simple minded Simple Simons
This is simple science when I spit it's signifying
That my spit is flyin'
I could spit shine the sun's surface
This verse is hot as fire, breathin' dragon's burpses
I hate to burst your bubble but you faggots been bottle fed
Noddin' your noggins to what I'm sayin' like bobble heads
So boggle your mind and crack a bottle of wine
Over your dome till your skull is at the bottom of your spine
So dope you gotta rewind a lot of the rhymes
If Jesus Christ read my notebook then God will go blind

[Scratch Hook] [x4]
"I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles ain't raw" - Dice Raw 'The Lesson Part II'

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
When I speak it's a problem
I'm a beast and a goblin
Fuckin' a MILF that closely resembles Marie Osmond
And I've been
Layin' in the cut mind controllin' elephants
Stab your face with a tusk, orchestrator of death
I am a black reverend
Monitor your stats, it's all you need is Monistat 7
Singin' +Eye Of The Tiger+ but you in eyeliner
Mile high club, flight attendent goin' down on a guy sky diver
Ed 209 malfunction 500 rounds
I'm dumpin' a Gatling gun to your dome
We act like dynamite inside a pumpkin
Sadistic appendages
My whole body's evil
Havin' fun with two guns hittin' like
"Some double desert eagles" - Gang Starr 'You Know My Steez'
We cop cars that look like cop cars
And got heli-copters to zero in on hella cop car
And send a missile at ya official tissue
Cause your track sound gayer than the +Mr. Wendell+ instrumental
Detrimental to your squad
I'll distance members and dis-member body parts
And gift rap 'em for this December
Death is the plan
You will meet Ed McMahon when I clear you out
Cause bombs that I Publish be Clearing House

[Scratch Hook] [x4]
"I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles ain't raw" - Dice Raw 'The Lesson Part II'

[TV Show sample]
Look! Up in the sky. It's a bird! It's a plane! It's...

[Verse Three] [Chino XL}:
The Puerto Rican Superhero!
Yo, I'm angry like my momma just beat me with a switch
Madder than Nick Cannon when Eminem be dissin' his bitch
Big Chino is known to be a wild kid
Y'all refuse to get tested
You know, that Pacquiao shit
Where ever there's drama I'mma fly and find the fucker
Beat him in the face till he's ugly like Usher's baby's mama
I pray for your death and I pray that I'm the cause of it
Idiot, killin' a blind man with his own walkin' stick
Mind quickest simpliest riddles
I wittle all arithmetics
I memorize ridiculous, I can hypnotize a hypnotist
Spittin' less than 33 ounces, still considered a liter/leader
My skills are far fetched like a Labrador Retriever
I mean I, keep a lot of balls
Only rivaled by the Gods of Mars
Watchin' Mya's ass shake on Dance With The Stars
My foes plot against me
My verbal molest and deserve to be put in chairs of electric
Like Roman Polansky
I put that I target artists on my resume
And place them in puddles of blood you can see 80 miles away
Your survival is decided by which side of the bed I wake up on
Worship the works of the wordsmith like it was a cross
My effect on women is hard to explain
I can piss on they head and convince them that it's rain
I'm vain
My six pack makin' bitches love me more
Get out of line and get punched like you Snookie on The Jersey Shore
My raw thoughts are awful
I'm so twisted I could eat an iron nail and
Shit out a cork screw
My writtens are displayed inside of Egyptian pantheons
Chino is bananas
I spit potassium and calcium and ummm
You ain't feelin' my spillings? Only a minor loss
Cause I am bad to the bone like a rotting corpse
My word a monologue
Keep rappers scared to go up in the booth
Like it's Magic Johnson's wife's vagina raw

[Scratch Hook] [x4]
"I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles ain't raw" - Dice Raw 'The Lesson Part II'

[Outro] [Celph Titled talking]
Yeah. The coalition of the spoken word crack cookers
Celph Titled. Apathy. Chino XL. Shuttin' shit the frrruck down
Buckwild. D.I.T.C. Forever and ever motherfucker[Big Daddy Kane]
You in the perils of the lyrical heroes
That rule just like the pharoahs
Robert Dinero's got it covered just like sombreros
Seek shelter, here comes the warpath
Anyone who's tryin' to reign, I change the whole forecast
If I slip, half a herd he learned
This murder he earned turned his body to third-degree burns
You're purely pathetic, I won't let it
And once I set it, the after-party's in the paramedics
Vultures, come back when you're older
Talkin' like you're grown, you cats is Small Soldiers
Enough of them as the god muscle in, it's puzzlin'
You couldn't carry weight if you was hustlin'
Style ain't even de-cent, them not gonna squeeze none
Please dun, give me one rea-son
What I, say in a verse will be slayin' you worse
As I wet 'em up just for the sake of obeying my thirst
Anytime anywhere, without any fair
I'll do it with any hair, what da deal, ain't he there, wha wha what
What I do will be crucially brutally
Usually legal and rippin' stupidly, ain't nothin' new to me
What I spit attract felons, crack melons
Leave the chickenheads back swellin'
Game tight wit the way I'm livin'
I bag birds and I stuff em like Thanksgiving
My bad self, get more love than tennis
From New York to Venice
Black as a Guinness here to represent to live with the menace
To win The Apprentice, if your heart shows stealth
You better watch yo' self before I stop yo' health
Cause any props here baby, you ain't gettin'
You better recognize, the true and livin'
You played yourself fast, put two quarters in your ass
What I meant, arcades done went up to fifty cent

[Chino XL]
That lyric tarantula, Chino about to make this example of
Wit one verse, shittin' on a whole label roster sampler
My first name: Chino, my last name: Went There
Leavin' rappers curled up and dyed like Immature's hair
Wit lyrical warfare, when I spray shit
My style like AIDS, half a y'all got it just none of y'all is sayin' shit
I hate and spit at devils that want to posses Chi
Jesus came in the vocal booth, like "Nigga, you the next me"
So test me, battle and you will become a dead man
And there's a lot of fake Chino's like Craig Mack's a fake Redman
But I'm above the surface of this rap circus
Writin' more incredible verses on accident than you can on purpose
You a worthless waste of flesh, like fat asses on a nun
I'm God's bastard son, that blasts and thinks bloodbaths are fun
I hate you with a passion, make white chicks faint like I'm Hanson
Historically known for bringin' down the house like I'm Samson
My damn tongue bursts, in the the first verse there's a bad curse that hurts
I'm leavin' wack church passengers inside of a fast hearse
Escapin the wrath of Jerse
It's a sad earth when my pen dirts
Axe murderer type of massacre occurs if we match words
I'm past blurs, I smack herbs
Gritty-green eyes like Badu
Leavin' minds fucked up like Maxwell's hair-do
And I'mma be the sickest till I'm dead
The type to rent Halloween 4 eight times just to laugh at LL's head
My new album is Flo-Jo's heart, watch it blow up
You ain't just wack, you're what wack wants to be when it grows up

[Kool G Rap]
The Godfather saga, hit you dead in the chest like shots of Vodka
Funer-als crowded like soccer while I'm watchin' opera
Last like Sinatra, blast like Binaca
Binoculars is how I'm watchin' droppin' from the chopper
Mafia imposter
You're left for dead with your face inside of your plate of pasta
?Freddy in a hasa?, salute to my crew to prosper
You know how we do, we icepick the boulder
You get dabbed over glasses of ice with the Bolla
Blood on your shoulder, make costra nostra
Keepin' the heater with the toasters
Dough in the sofa, cashmeres and gator loafers
We bullet-proof the Rovers, pimp-smack you sober
Our whole crew is skippin' to lieutenants and soldiers
Flip on you the way Montana did to Minola
Condition vulgar holdin' on blowers older than Yoda
Leave bad odors when we give cobras crystal like Yoga
Colder than the caps that's in the Polar, bubble like soda
Bend these old Lola Falanas over
Cross me, cut our your momma's ovaries
Kid you know the steez, have your wake smellin' like potpourri
On the low-key, ship keys to over-seas
My shit gets sold quicker than groceries
K-double-O-L-and-G, you know it's meI'm known for murking a nigga at random
Get out a Dodge like I'm car jacking you for your Magnum
I walk around like I've got an S on my chest
Sick Side or New West, my minds on chronic and fess
God in the flesh, Bambaataa knew best
A nine year old Chino XL, Zulu Nation spitting fire from lips
I try to relax, I fly the Hawaii Pearl Harbor monuments
With eighty Asian friends and ride for the Japs
I'll die and collapse, rather than not splurge a weird word
Perfect perverted spitting sick cause I'm allergic to cats
Messiah murderous David Berkowitz, David Koresh
That's ill as it gets, my life is a mess I'm waiting for death
Speak pain til the monitors crack, my sonogram was black
You scared like you in the Barrio with Swastika tats
My defeat is like an impossible task you embarr-ass
Like it's Father's Day and you Omarion's dad
Chino is careless spitting on that lyrical shit
Angry like KRS when he found out Scott La Rock was dead
I'm fearless, I'd rather enlist in a war
Instead of listening to this party like a rock star bullshit
My brain should be taken apart piece by piece
So no other man can become the same kind of beast
Though in times of famine cannibalism often increase
Off the leash, shots of Thorazine will only increase
I put blood all up inside of the crease of your Khaki suit
They say for an animal my attack's very tactical
The Puerto Rican superhero does his thing
I hate the police so much I'd probably assassinate Sting
My System of a Down Rages Against the Machine
Tie you up in a Slipknot and hold Alice In Chains inside her dreams
Higher than the price of gasoline, God without Zilla
Bleeding kerosene and your the soldier that I'm conquering
I move like Stalin, sovereign in serene
While the governments stocking and doctoring
I'm rocking my following
Eye sockets are hollowing could Rob a Zombie for Halloween
Drop me in the sea and watch me out breathe a submarine
I was born mean it ain't even a case
I fly to Canada to ask Cline Dion why the long face
The rap game want me to vanish without a trace bitches
I stack their bodies up like Thanksgiving Day dishes
Lock me down in a basement of Folsom
With just a pen and notebook believe me I would exist all by my lonesome
'I Will Survive' careful the song's approaching
Writing the poison potion smiling cause your murder's already in motion
I have no emotion like I'm a Vulcan like an Egyptian sultan
Every word that I have spoken should be quoted
My lyrics revolting but thoughts provoking
Enemies proceed with caution
You'll be up to your knees in beef you can't walk in
Assassin stalking my shadow, channels and clothes
While I'm sparking a fortune in grass that grows like it's a source of protein
I promised my fans I would never soften, even dead in coffins
Waiting to morph and to reincarnate in abortion
Even the deepest thoughts that I might find myself all lost in
I make sure I force myself into writing some more shit
It's kind of awkward
What I brought the planet, anything can happen
No laughing like Mariah's marriage to Nick Cannon
My lyric blessings draw a lot of questions
One day in the booth of confession I was accused of the Devil's friendship
Cause it's hard for human acceptance, I leave such huge impressions
They do Chino impressions like ventriloquist magicians
Your album's intermission now that I'm put in position
Your bulletins mention you quittin' from Lyric Jesus writtens
Divine intervention, my ascension, the high intention
Will rival the Bible's religion or Chris Benoit tripping
Stronger mastery of words than the Earth had intended
Ill as lesbian stripping leaving their children unattended
My Poison Penmanship blemishes so called menaces
Since Genesis been sicker than six exorcist apprentices
I've been restricted, a victim of wicked censorship
I'm hoping God ain't offended and heard the curse of my descendants
I'm out for vengeance, you don't think that could stop me do you
I could go on forever like Googling the word Google
So put an X on the part of my mind that writes the words
Cause that's the known murder capital of the rap world
Claiming you thorough but don't want no drama
Or say you wanna fight but then they first in flight like North Carolina
You living off one rhyme than people consider good
A lucky punch like that kid claiming that he knocked out Suge
I tried to reach you for years, I'm finally getting a look
I'm fighting for a chance like a fetus at Planned Parenthood
I ain't stingy I give it to anyone that wants some
Catch you at your label luncheon, squeezing 'til the gun malfunctions
Now you dying from living off assumptions
Shaking like a dancer clumping, beat you like a Crip or Blood that getting jumped in
Straight out a dungeon, revenge I'm lustin'
Training like Rocky to fight the Russian
The shiny Chinese food is getting is dim sum
I got the world wild and mad cause I took a Valium
And wrote Dr Dre's whole Detox album[Intro]
(I ain't scared of nothing)

[Bridge: Somaya Reese x2]
Wild out, this is it, bless your shit, lunatic
You ain't scared, go ahead, put your hands high
Get 'em

[Hook: Chino XL x4]
My only weakness is
I ain't scared of nothing

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
That nigga Chino XL is a cold menace
That ain't scared of nothing like I got no nerve endings
With the sickest sentence that is known from here to Venice
Since Rick Rubin signed my demo, been stronger than wooly mammoths
Heart darker than Black Sabbath
A real master of words that causes Havoc like Prodigy's partner's parents
Syllable chemist, was 16 with my first 12"
Destine
I had no choice like an arranged marriage
Like an inbred, tie you up in a toolshed
Hang you upside down and beat you till your piss turns red
Make you an invalid
Yes I'm sick and into it
It makes my heart warm like hating my father when I was a kid
No saving grace, I'm using razor blades to slash your arms
You're left for days and ate by gators in the Everglade swamps
I ain't scared of nothing, I'm stubborn, a live wire
My name in sign language is a middle finger on fire

[Hook x4]

[Bridge x2]

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
I'm that brolic god of carnage that would body college
Sick as gynecologists, spit collagen at live pirahanas
Eat cyanide olives by a cottage in the farthest forest
Burning down a farmer's crops just when he was about to harvest
My vocal cords will murder yours from sheer power wattage
Your comments, "Why did the plague of Chino rain down upon us?"
Silence
I'm breaking your legs, you're nauseous
You can't run again like a president that already served two terms in office
Living lawless, raw performance for the riches
Put you down like toliet seats when you live in a house full of bitches
Sicker than Caeser's syphilis
And Jonbenet Ramsey's killers
And pictures of Natalie Holloway's titties (can I get a witness?)
My spirit is big so I don't fear a thing
I'll karate kick Steven Segal in his lace front wig
Fuck a pig
Hop out the whip and shatter your ribs
Wearing a mask in broad daylight like Michael Jackson's kids did
And I'll flip and then whip you to death with a marble bar stool
And dig up your corpse so I can drive in the lane for car pool
How do you think you can threaten the metaphor weapon
That's responsible for inventing this industry's rebellion?
Hellion
Dark scoundrel
Me fearing someone?
Over my dead body nigga, Gary Coleman

[Hook x4]

[Bridge x2]

[Interlude]
(I ain't scared of nothing)

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
Lungs of a champion
I take one breath and start an album and don't breathe again until I'm sitting at mastering
Chino the ambassador, caster of the spell of a massacre
Hell is the task of thee assassin that does more spazing per capita
Serving half of the bastard rappers, inhaling cancer, breath out asthema
Dump your body in the back of a factory canister
My position is vivid, if it's a gimmick I give it
60 minutes than exhibit the sickest village verbal spillage
Worship my words
I got more game than Wild Life Preserves
I'm purging out sperm in a perma perm in a groupie birth
I stand firm in the stance that Chino XL is the handsomest
No time for romance and shit, I'm on my Charles Manson shit
I got so many bars that I could apply for a liquor license
Not the lesbian type that's dyking but Viking trips I'm writing
Where my similes are similar and liken to a Lycan
Werewolf in the night that'll have you and your Christ afterlife you liking
I'm fighting, managing, keeping savage at all costs
Fuck showers I'm dragging Mark Zimmerman through a car wash
I rhyme to the point of exhaust and killing everybody
And copied 16 and sloppy and played out like Ed Hardy
You started, I'm slashing, I don't wanna hear you're sorry
Leave your face fractured, twisted backward like Whitney's baby daddy Bobby
I'm the illest is what the gossip is
Wanna rep your state?
Alright, I'm beat you into the state of unconsciousness
Monsterous until I'm posthumous it's obvious
Me fearing anybody breathing, simply nonsense

[Hook x4][Intro]
What'chu talkin 'bout yo?
The fuck you mean yo?
I'm an MC, I rock all type of shit yo
I started rockin in parties in, in 8th grade nigga
Watch how I do this shit

[Chino XL]
Aight, verse one, fuckin with me
Is fuckin with the worst one, I spit it with speed
With skill of a surgeon, if you buyin that weed
And carrying guns or missin Big Pun let me hear y'all niggas
It's curtains if you try to impede
On gettin this work done, you better believe
The murderous version, Puerto Rican gangstas
Crips, Bloods, pimps, thugs in this club let me hear y'all niggas
Deferred funds, money and royalties
Killin my burdens, my MC loyalties
Spittin from my lungs, if you sittin in yo' whip
Hollerin at a bitch, blastin my shit let me hear y'all niggas
I burst 'em, you thinkin I wouldn't squeeze
He in a hearse numb, pain and penalties
Jers', Jerusalem, Christian, Muslim
Everybody make it jump, get it crunk when it come, yo

[Hook: Chino XL]
I don't give a fuck about nothin
I just wanna smoke, fuck, drink, and verbal murder somethin (okay)
I'm the papi the mamis all lovin
When I smoke, fuck, drink, and verbal murder somethin
I don't give a fuck about nothin (uh-uh)
I just wan' smoke, fuck, drink, and verbal murder somethin (okay)
I'm the papi that the mamis all lovin
When I smoke, fuck, drink, and verbal murder somethin

[Chino XL]
Honestly it's a little too live tonight
Like somebody gonna get shot tonight
Beastin, me and my niggas when our money ain't right
We still got enough game to pull a bitch that's tight
Have Chinese or Japanese mamis on they knees
Gasped, I told 'em my twin sister was Alicia Keys (hahaha)
But I ain't lovin her - I got a lot of muscles
That gotta count for somethin, Schwarzenegger is a governor
But I ain't carjackin no Hummer to impress
Ladies call me Champagne, I keep they pussies mo' wet
This that Puerto Rican gangsta shit
I'm half-black, got a big ass dick
Checkin mami with the thick ass lips
She ain't impressed with these lyrical skills
I make movies and got record deals to pay those bills
Take those pills for real, she borin when she sober (yup)
These bitches is Jewish how much they gettin +Passed Over+

[Hook]

[Chino XL]
Yo... check it
Dawg, don't even comment, I'm hotter than a comet
These snitch niggas don't turn states, they turn continents
I tell nothin with confidence, my intolerance legendary
Hostile in monetary in punchlines I've said already
Threw 'em in the garbage next to Oscar the Grouch
8 million dollar house sellin lines by the ounce
Identify yo' wifey by the size of her mouth
Stretch marks to accommodate my massive amounts
Without doubts I'm too violent (uh-huh)
Never retirin, pushin a Jag, playing "Vice City" on my palm pilot
I'm not a kind man, I run with con men
Strong, throwing signs like M. Night Shyamalan
Go 'head and bring the drama on (uh-huh)
I'll whip that ass, take pictures of it on my Sprint picture-takin cell phone
Your little wifey's at home, thinkin I'm God
I'm leavin your ride full of more holes than Spongebob (blaow!)

[Hook][Hook x2]
(Long, long, long look away
Long, long, long look away)
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything

[Verse 1]
Locked in a hospital, a dead nurse with big tits and slit wrists
Tried to administer me pills but I resist
I'm dangerous as crocodiles outta tanks
You don't need my DNA strands to recognize my killer traits
I lost my mind, I'm haunted by the words that I've invented
To the point, they're feeding me glasses of NyQuil with my dinner
I associate the infliction of pain with pleasure
Frequently insult my neighbors wearing blood stained leathers
People that never visit insist that I owe 'em shit
I'm repeatedly takin' Rohypnol and praying I don't exist
Damn near wanna throw a party off exhilaration
That I get from squeezin' the life out of a human body shaking
I'm a happening waiting to accident, blessed sacriment
Festering blasphemist, transient arrogant acrobat
Riding camelbacks under circus tents, nervous off Percocets
Possessed laughs till I'm at Bernie Mac's funeral services

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
You've got mental problems, I'm sure
It's just that mine is greater
At least you have honor to live in the time I put ink to paper
Over 10,000 hours of labor, limitless
An undeniable perfectionist that plagues the souls of lyricists
Hand me a scalpel I'll scribble scribes on your face
I make people run, that's why they call it the human race
XL campaign, don't owe you a damn thang
Tear a turtles head off, drink blood out of shells like canteens
I can't scream, I got the metal machines ready
Forever holding my piece like I'm not objecting at a wedding
Was manufactured in Heaven to be a horid tourist
Placed specifically on Earth, quantuum leaps over other artists
Dirty my name, the seeds of discontent were planted
That's grounds for murder, I'm stoned, you took me for granted
Damn it, you think I owe you something, get it in blood
Rick James last words, "Chino's verse is a hell of a drug"

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Get me out of here
I just needed some time to get my mind right
Then it's back to these bitches yelling "Go Daddy" like the website
Run away don't cross me
You won't be able to walk through your house without tripping over some dead offspring
I'm getting stressed by the government
Don't even write my name down unless it has "Paid To The Order" in front of it
Budgeted, trying to feed your family is real
Gas prices looking bigger than the numbers on Adele's bathroom scale
My skills internal and running wild
I could eat a Rubik's Cube and shit it out completely solved
I vowed my foundation is built with brick and mortar
Destroying peers like a tsunami tearing through a harbor
Consistantly ill, but still industry overlook me
Officially, something's fishier than mermaid pussy
I hate you with a perfect hate and nothing less
Last seven words:
The best ever from the best yet

[Hook x2][Hook 1: DV Alias Khrist]
This game is cold, I told my broad I won't be coming home
I lost my job, I lost my mind, lost everything I own
The city got me fucked up.. yo these pigs got me fucked up..
Music on the radio is fucked up, I hop in the truck and only want to feel the pain

[Hook 2: Chino XL]
Chino XL, and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Immortal Technique and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Psycho Realm and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Real lyricists and fuck everybody else!
All my street soldiers STAND UP!
Arm yourselves!

[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
What the fuck happened to rap? I need to put my lyrical clip in
It’s on homie, gun clapping is back
These pop acts make me wanna pop gats
This whole shit is fucked up coz radio just broadcast trash
Surround the wack, blast my semi-auto tracks
Launching deadly hollow caps and taking out the whack
And many follow that, swallow that...
I’ll burn you vocal like a bottle Jack
You thought you had the streets coz I was gone
Well we just got ‘em back! Homie you can check my team
It’s super ugly when you get us all together, Sick, Tech & Chi
This reign of terror won't end with me
I spawned a little psycho coz my baby momma kept that seed
Now I'mma take a little trip to these radio stations
Grab them punk ass DJs, wave guns in their faces
If they don’t play my shit then it’s “Welcome to Hell”
Coz all we want is Immortal Tech, Chino & the Psycho Realm!

[Hook 1]

[Hook 3: Chino XL]
Immortal Technique and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Psycho Realm and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Chino XL and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Real lyricists and fuck everybody else!
All my street soldiers STAND UP!
Arm yourselves!

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
Chino’s ill, slap off your cosmetics
I arm myself like a veteran putting on prosthetics
My barbaric genetics bring pain
The only Revolution that you’ve ever seen is Prince’s group in Purple Rain
Deranged monster is sponsored
You get shit on and pissed on like Tila Tequila at a Juggalos concert
Ain’t tryna be glamorous, hammers we snap like cameras
I’m fuckin’ intense like teenage camp councilors
Spit blood through your stereo, there we go, time for your burial
Fag niggas, after you rhyme say no hetero (hahaha)
My murderous sentences, no secrets where my weapons is
Locked in the closet next to pop rappers' sexual preferences
Amber alert, your girl's mouth ran away with my kids
If you’re sick then I should be diagnosed with three days to live
You slip I kidnap you and give you a mean death
Beat you with your Blackberry till there's barely a screen left
Jack and Tech my dawgs like Andrés in the Philippines
My mistress is villainy, rape and pillage ‘em lyrically
My symphony's sinfully biblically loved by killers
Who gives a fuck who’s the greatest rapper alive as-long as Chino’s the illest!

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Fuck a silent Revolution, soldier, I'm on the warpath
I’ll throw my commandments down on your platinum calf
You'll get your face slashed like a Rikers Island reminder
Behind ya snipers will find ya whether you run to China
Or try to crawl the fuck back in your mother's vagina, (bitch!)
And I don't need a fuckin' co-signer (hahaha)
To murder gassed up underground niggas like coal miners
Bring it back paying homage to the old timers
I was bred as a carnivore, bred as a cannibal
Flow sicker than pictures of people fuckin' animals
Like a car crash ripped in half neck to the crotch
Muthafuckas scared to stare but they secretly watch
Niggas wanna play Shaytan? Well let's get it on
I fire missiles like the fuckin' shit that hit the Pentagon
You not strong enough to do a song with me I'm the truth
Like Tina Turner motherfucker, you'll get raped in a booth!

[Hook 1]

[Hook 3]I, don't, un-der-stand what goes on in the mind of Chino XL!

(Chorus)
I'm more known for beef than Bad Boy and Death Row
So when I'm finished rockin I hear, "You fuckin asshole!"
I get on stage at Summer Jam, piss on the front row
And have the whole crowd screamin out, "You fuckin asshole!"
You either love me or hate me, but you can't stop my dough
I keep all the broke niggas thinkin, "You fuckin asshole!"
Your girl recognize me like cubans do Castro
Lemme see those middle fingers up high, "You fuckin asshole!"

(Verse 1)
I copped the Clark Kent joint, now what the fuck you gonna do?
Yo, I'mma spit till my whole bodies devoid of all this fluid
And you can't even do it, imagine how ill I can get
You just assume to see Britney Spears on the cover of Jet
The government is after me for being internationally dastardly
Just ask the real MC's who this illest yellow bastard be
Battle me and win if we battle to see who's the brokest
I'm sicker than seeing Kelly Price doing aerobics
Sicker than finding out firsthand Jennifer Lopez can't fuck
Sicker than seeing Richard Pryor in his wheelchair doing stand up
And what, I'm first, mom told me stay in my place
But I still never met my match like my ass and Shabba's face
Got real ways to bring terror, so you better
Think twice about fuckin around with me like you see Tia and Tamera
Or avoid me totally, all consider with caution
Similar to deciding wether or not to drink after Magic Johnson
I Squash and hunt men with David Carradine Tai Kung Fu
The Rappers I'm writing rhymes for should be writing rhymes for you

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Clark told me to just kill it when I write rhymes
But how many murders can I commit in one life time?
I never quit, I Remained on
Chino, mentally, verbally, off the meat rack like Rocky Balboa trained on
Swarm rappers from New York to LA
I'm the hottest latin entertainer since Ricky Martin is gay
Suede lyrics and ways, not invented yet
Make you look weaker than that Public Enemy record they sellin over the internet
I'm spending that money, bout to bloody up ya best shirt
My hearts blacker than the entire WB Network
Catch you at ya concert, sweaty like Gerald Levert
On Slim Fast, you ain't gonna shoot or you would've been blast
Bitch ass, I'm Hopeless? like Heavy D, I Focus
I talk so much shit I should swallow a dozen roses
Foes is something I can't let survive
I hate to end this off on a bad note like SWV live

(Chorus)

Chino is as Chino does, no love
I'm doing this mostly for the money, like EPMD Reunion was
Take the first bait
Your deaths assured like head from a french girl on the first date
But don't hate this "best-life-form-to breathe", oxygen
Rock hotter than halogen, servin a verbal ((?))
Slobbering, it ain't right, the industry ruined my life
I've been black balled like I'm Cuba Gooding Jr's white wife
A high price, leave you dead above the waste
I'm The Artist, without a pound of makeup on my face
My verbal assaults extend way beyond battle rhymes
Verses of mines like construction of God to a human mind
So don't miss a line, but you can rewind
So it don't even matter like lights left off or on to a man blind
"Yo, he's wack, slow down the pace"
I'm wack? I'll just retire and blame it on god, like Mase

(Chorus)[Intro: Chino XL]
Chapter and verse from the Bad Man Bible

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
I swear, massacre should be at least my middle name
I'm a beast with fangs that'll maim and I am immune to pain
I maintain with a brain that is clinically insane
Biologists never seen nothing like it, it's a new strain
At a cellular level, cold as the Ukraine
And modern science is too young for Chino to be explained
His fame is so for the birds it feels like I'm growing wings
And haters look so small from where I am, in the clouds and things
Y'all like bitches do anything to get my attention
I'm inflicting brutality, banned from Geneva Conventions
They wanna cut me out of history but I ain't dying
My heart is fire, my mind is water, my body's iron
Sound the siren, the tyrant giant that'll never tire
God's child out of wild, defying the empire
Surviving those that conspire against Ghetto Vampire
Sick control freaks like Beyonce's father
Smarter to know these cowards hold they stand astounding
Genius level, should be performing wearing a cap and gown
Mentally disturbed, disturb me, get your family buried
My heart's an empty cavity that can only be filled in by murder
Stomp your fucking face till you bleed from every orifice
Make your life a living hell till the Devil's paying me mortgage
Witness, I got a brain sickness that's twisted
As Lawrence Taylor in that crack hotel with underage bitches
Hoping God grant me leniency, turned all my pain into strength
They could sell my tears at a GNC
I try to stay healthy, right and keep my physique tight
And black don't crack, nor will my Puerto Rican side
I hate people, I shake lethal, the straight strange cerebral
Possess the trait to facilitate great evil
Lyric Jesus surrounded by his seven disciples
Singing songs of survival from Bad Man Bible

[Hook x2: Chino XL]
Bible, have you ever heard about the Bad Man Bible?
Tell you about the killer and his 12 disciples
That's why we come in pumping rifle
Bad Man Bible

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
The real nightmare is here, embarrassing
Making your bad dreams look like nursery rhymes in comparison
I spit gospel when speaking
Rappers are angry like Superhead with lockjaw on All-Star Weekend
You can hear it and feel it in your spirit that death's approaching
My rhymes are inflammatory, someone get the Ibuprofen
Been groping in darkness but my time's now
Fuck milk cartons, they'll be stenciling your face on live cows
Stop Chino, they know that they better kill him
Or I'm finding and turning they porno movies to a snuff film
My scribbling is the equivalent of shivering children
That were trapped and sealed in a Haitian building
But the faith was never given in
My venom that I'm penning like grinning jack-o-lanterns
Lit and flickering, niggas running like gingerbread men taking insulin
You don't want an incident, you're tripping with the wrong one
That's self inflicted suicide like Marie Osmond's son
Crazier than any man breathing a feeling that divert me
Put that on a list of what I don't have, next to AIDS and mercy
I stay in controversy, that's cursed as pagan worship
Reverse of the perfect murder as hermit preaching a sermon
That's currently birthing the urban servants serving certain persons
Slicing and sacrificing virgins there is evil lurking
Blood in the sand, I'm here to fulfill God's plan
Write my name on your palm, I'm a problem on your hands

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
The most passionate, blasphemous, lyric Lazarus
Sew you into a snuggie with hungry rats in it
Apart from the partially awkward larceny
See this heartfelt artistry? Mortally, I free the God in me
I give an MC instant sympathy like crippled amputees
From botched carpentry trying to singlehandedly try they hand at archery
Whispers in blood, Bad Bible bury my sinning in ink
I think I could inseminate a seminary
It's scary, walking with a pound even when not needed
And these stigmatas that I got, don't know how to stop bleeding
The heathen, heaving, more wicked than any man breathing
Articulately speaking, you're thieving, shrinking, it ain't worth repeating
For any petty, measly reason I'm wild sick
Your body won't even have a bone left to make a wish with
The explicit misfit, killer instinct, mystic Christian
Spit at this thing, try to diss me, hang you from ceiling like P!nk
Picture perfect, sinister, keeping the devil nervous
Writing verses, making you reconsider your life purpose
Every time I hear your name it's from getting punked
You worse than a pussy cause a pussy only bleeds once a month
I get drunk and high, take peyote, skydive
Hit the ground after hallucinating, thousands of lines
They want the lyric god dead even the best try
My CDs in This Nigga's Crazy section at Best Buy

[Hook x2][Playalitical]
Why they gotta be like, "Chino that and Chino this?"
Like yo, "Where Chino at?" What, you Chino's bitch?
Look, Chino back and he's on his
I'm on mine, we on time, lil' fucker we rich

[Chino XL]
Yo... now stop askin me about my dawg Playalitical
Or it'll be a grand fi-nal, murder fa-tal
Throw in the towel, askin questions like a cop fed
Only fed I heard is K-Fed, a record deal wasted

[Hook: Playalitical] + (Chino)
What did y'all forget how to throw the bat signal up?
(What the fuck is wrong wit y'all?)
They say we wait too much when we spit that smut
(What the fuck is wrong wit y'all?)
I guess they want that pretty shit, they don't wanna hear a nut
(What the fuck is wrong wit y'all?)
Throwin up on a bitch like what, what-what
Wh-wh-wh-wh-what, wh-what, wh-what, wh-wh-wh-wh-wh

[Chino] Yeah, yo, bring it to 'em nigga

[Playalitical]
Everybody know who roll call (already)
She do the chicken noodle soup, smash your head in coleslaw
I'm back, back from the Staples Center
Didn't win nothin, you had to be gay to enter
Yeah we seen the top 20 at the 49th Grammy's
And we clap unloaded 45's to they panties
And we band like the Outlaws, they don't want a battlezone
I high beep it, blow myself up like a camera phone

[Chino XL]
'Litical mayne, yeah
Chino, ill as they come, ass and tongue
Pack guns, I eat crack, you niggas is rappin for crumbs
Murder jump out my lungs, punch out nuns
Punch out your gums, go dumb, I'm settin fire to bums
Y'all niggas is scums, won't pull the heat out
Your heads is sunflowers nigga, I'mma punch the seeds out
Ladies love it when I act this way
Bringin +Celebrity Deathmatches+ without the clay - one!

[Hook]

[Playalitical]
Uhh... addin new {?} to my eye flicks
Put you in positions to pop with codfish
I won't take losses; I take faces
Got cases the size of Jimmy Dean sausage
The big fish in the pond that he got fish
Moby can't fuck with 'Litical, he'll get nauseous
Get cautious, watch as we ship boxes
You on my time now, switch watches
Switch places, expose all you dick faces
Add a pose playa because I went places
Y'all the type to mug me in the yard like a bunch of gay gnomes
Now I gotta break bones over payphones
Ridin with Chino on 14th and J-Tones
Daytonas and eight chrome
He said M-A where he rep but Jersey where he from
If you rhyme in his hometown they'll lock him in Greystone

[Hook]

[Chino XL]
Yo, Chino that fine young nigga that them ugly niggas hate
I wanna whip they ass but I ain't scrapin up my Bapes
Gun in my waist, known for goin in the paint hard
Stop trying to save face like you Brad Jordan's bodyguard
I don't give a damn if you a retard
Pop off and grab a bat and beat you, I'll you 'til you have amnesia
Beat you 'til you have a seizure
I'll beat you 'til you blind in both eyes
Drag you under the bleachers covered in human feces
Fuck droppin sirens, drop a whole fire truck
I'm wired like when I first heard Kurupt bust
Listenin to "The Chronic" in New Jersey with my friends
Like - I'm movin out to Cali dawg, I'm more like them (West coast!)
It was Ice-T that bought Chino that plane ticket
Sway & Tech and them ese's expose my verbal sickness
Now I'm hood famous without too much promotion
But who else could record a mixtape and get God to host it over?

[Hook][Biggie Sample]
Dumb rappers need teaching, lesson A

[Hook x2]
(I'm a b-boy)
I started in the park
Two turntables and a microphone makin it art
(I'm a gangsta)
To keep my money strong
What needs to be done, carry a mic and a gun

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, yo, I'm all hip hop nigga but all thug
Slap the shit out of venus for thinking its all love
A B-Boy and a gangster both officially now
Have your body full of holes like they spots on a cow
Since I was a child ive felt that I was fallin, father please forgive me
Jailed for robbing an organ donor for his kidney
Too angry, kicked out of anger management class
As I reduce once thought of invincible armies to ashes
I was the type of kid had spray paint can in one hand
And a nickel plated 380 in the other one
Thats when the trouble come, when broke had to hussle some
They brought my mum for questioning, she like "not my son"
I'm the man dog, done songs with Big L and RZA
Dangerous as hemophiliacs running with a scissor
Sit back sip your liqour you quicker than the third millenium
Keep my pockets weight up, guns blasting you to oblivion
Blame it on the world we're living in for coke distributing
Married to this music, bout to have my third kid with it
Doctors delivered it to conquer any lyricists
It's my turn but I made it like Texas hating the Dixie Chicks

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
There ain't enough math invented to count ways I ain't feeling you
But I show you love every day by not killing you
Skills is miniscule
Over an instrumental you
Harder to understand than Lennox Lewis talking in an interview
I got inditements you dont wanna be me
I spit sick youll probably catch SARS of my CD
Syllable sorcery still street, any beat getting laced
Left my mark on the game like that mole in the middle of Enrique Iglesias face
From carrying crates for Afrika Bambaata Zulu Nation '88
I penetrated the game at a crazy rate
From the place of Whitneys Houstons drug suppliers
Old New Jersey made me great
Of course the labels made me wait I never hyperventilate
Cos they holding no weight like they hustle in outta space
Nelly dissing KRS1? We gotta stop him
Whats next, Beyonce battling Rakim?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I'm a B-Boy but I wild on niggas thats what they pay me for
But I ain't no backpack cat wearing Jansport
Your mans taught you it was silly to try me
Shit won't be pretty like India Irie
Me dying, ive got nothing to lose
Put me in heaven with Barry White being on the hook singing to sell your cruise
Over a beat or two Jam Master Jay produced
Your crew had me outnumbered what the fuck was they excuse?
Now I'm feeling a mess, imprisoned by my own success
Fame done killed more celebrities than any bullets through holes in stess
In one moment or less for my scrill you kill
But HipHops like Sway and Tech flexing Felly Fell
Emcees studied me well, but still
Give me credit like when I tell the world I studied Kool G Rap and LL
Or Forrest Whittaker naming his first son Denzel
Cos people hear me all over your records like I'm Pharrell
XL blowing up is probable, yet philosophical
Ashanti shaved her sideburns so anything is possible
B-Boys and gangstas throw ya hands in the air
I'm from Jerz, the home of "I couldve swore I parked my car right here"

[Hook][Verse 1: Killah Priest]
I do chin-ups off a niggas bars, killing off whole squads
A nose guard off the line of scrimmage
Beginners are finished, I'm relentless, my spit game injures
I'm the ninja, blow on trees like winters
In the centre, keep a sinister smile
With the dillinger like John Wilkes Booth
My palm still shoots ink, leaving rappers extinct
Pulling gats out my mink, clap where you think
I go from God Body to Godzilla
To God forgive him till I hope God is with him
If not I spit jack, think witch dreams
Of automatics, M-16s, submachines
Slugly streams of blood
Clear out clubs, air out mugs, put wings on thugs
It's your screams I love, I sample them, put on 'em on Pro Tools
And Ad-lib 'em with vocals, Killah Priest

[Hook: Chino XL]
The type of rappers that be Beastin' {*2X*}

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
My saliva's lava, the wicked anomalous scholar
The author composing your broken bones into an orchestra
Burn in Heaven, no weapon can harm me
These homos been in the closets so long I'ma donate them to Salvation Army
Calmly tearing ya flesh like the claws of a falcon
Write songs till my wrist develops Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
And there's no feeling in my right thumb, my knuckles white and numb
You should see the muscular development in my forearms
I'm sworn human heron from here on
Consider Chino XL Monster, fuck Charlize Theron
You cling on to life like a skinny Luther
I'm like an aircraft carrier going to war with a Mini Cooper
Getting used to being crazy
As a double jointed female doctor bent over, delivering her own baby
Anti-Medical, non-preventable
Make you and a dead man identical
Sound alarms, I'm well armed, like an octopus tentacle
Bust ten of you, trust none of you
I'm the murdering minister when God is upset at you
Right on schedule, calligraphers spit a comprehensible
Poison Pen always the illest, today he's exceptional
Slaying professional between big deals
I get jobs at McDonalds and throw cyanide pills into kids meals
I slaughter individuals, throw rappers through windshields
Slice them from ear to ear till they breathing out of fish scales
Every lyricist kneels to my internal, incurable inferno
I beat a niggas haircut into crop circles
Hear the smotherless pain
Be the main attraction in a circus how I can juggle your jugular vein
I stumble and aim if you merely just mumble my name
Crumple your fame, cripple your fangs
Isn't it strange it doesn't change I'm a beast
The hungriest rapper alive picking human flesh out of my teeth
You get shot in the streets or in sentences like Mystikal
Don't even call rap rap no more, call it Chino XL[Intro x2]
Screamin' at the top of my lungs 'till God notice me
Tryin' to find my stairway to Heaven where I'm supposed to be
Still carryin' weapons to get my children groceries
It's one man against the world, black rosary
Only feelin' hate in my heart, pain and poetry
My prayers go ignored in the dark, it hurts emotionally
Hopin' that Lucifer's heart will finally let go of me
It's one man against the world, black rosary[Hook]
That's me, that's me
The kid with the broken halo
That's me, that's me
The devil won't seem to let me go

[Verse 1]
It's true the letters that they sent from school to my mother
Chino's too wild and does not play well with others
Rappers blinded and brainwash and need to be reminded
The Puerto Rican superhero no assembly required
Dark and agnostic, I torture you targeting my shit
Bastard be careful, like a nigga with glasses in a mosh pit
I flow free, spit religiously with each breath
With more lines than there are in Kimora Lee's neck
I'm sick with a pencil, he's done
But fuck sticking a fork in him, stab him with every kitchen utensil I can find
The brutalist, underpunched tutelage, proving it's in my genes like True Relig
The odds are slim to none that you can live
You don't want to be me is not convincing
It'll be cool to be you, just to witness my beauty in three dimensions
Necessary, vengeance, losing my religion
Only five words that are worse for me to hear is
"Babe, I think I'm pregnant."
It's really nothing to murder cowards with a crowbar
And have them scared to leave the house for fear of death like Solar
I take credit for a ton of police, it's Chino's fault
Then carve my name in your face and fill the wounds up with table salt
The mission, infiltrate the system with or without guns
And choke you till your lungs have no air like kings with no sons
The world told me, "Go to Hell", alright I'll meet you there
Latino's don't cheat death, we defeat it fair and square
Tearing your faggott ass in half and laugh and try to diss me
You ain't worth the urine particles existing in my piss stream
Since the cradle a word angel with a broken halo

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
(Chino XL)
They say that fake's the new real
I'll chop them up in suitcases, let the familiy pick one like it's Deal Or No Deal
They try to get at me, bitter the kid out spit they bosses
I'll have the studio literally littered with rapper's corpses
Bringer of death, barbarian will impale
If God was a rapper then He'd be Chino XL
Stuck up, snotty, known to body rappers biblically
Leave 'em like Samson with his eyes gouged out by the Phiilistines
Of my own style, I'm the father, Maury Povich
Chino's so tight in the booth, I'm feeling claustrophobic
Free of the corporate theater, my heater is coming soon
If I attack you on stage you will not make it to your dressing room
They call me brutal cause I don't think a cop should shoot you
Then get away with it, we shouldn't have it, come on, be truthful
My homie tried to get a grant to go to school
All he was granted was Fox News views of Oscar Grant in his tomb
Guerilla monsoon with a blow torch
You can't hold a candle
Y'all ain't no vandals wearing skinny jeans and Croc sandels
My art canvas will start panics
Will heartlessly go to the Bronx Zoo bear handed to tear apart Pandas
I wanna scalp these traitors and bring out my native thoughts
Cause revolution has never been a spectator sport
Chino, the muscle fill will lay you down right in a tomb
There will be nowhere on your body that doesn't have a wound
I write like someone's life inside of a cartoon
The fiendish, human Venus Flytrap of raps is in full bloom
Heaven's on the payroll even with my broken halo

[Hook][Verse 1: Julius Luciano]
I snatch the mic from you clowns, refuse to wait my turn
This is the art of emceeing, to whom it may concern
I'm loony, wait, disturbed, I act like I truly can't discern
Right from wrong, ignite the chrome, you stupid lames get burned
The gat claps, call the llama gonorrhea
Brrap, that's onomatopoeia, now your crew gets placed in urns
I kick styles, I didn't need the kudetai to learn
The world is mine, I'm the son of the dude who makes it turn
I'm God's descendant, I'm exceptionally clever
Immaculate conception, like my inception was better
Him, yeah, I'm him, my perception is extra-sensory
Consider me perfection's successor
Rappers pray to me, not in the direction of Mecca
I'm outside the matrix, I'm in the Nebuchadnezzar
We real MC's connecting together
From the garden state to the golden state, our depth can't be measured

[Verse 2: Demetrius Capone]
Rough and raw crank, clutch my balls, wait
I'm balls deep in your mind, fuck what y'all think
You in some deep shit like you crawled out of Shawshank
I'm shot calling like I shot the ball and I called 'Bank'
This is that murder, murder, mu-murderous murder show
I'm an insurgent in surgeon, cause with this burner I'm surgical
Call my weapon the Special Olympics cause that .38's a pro
You turned into the fuck'm station, name it FM radio
My gun will draw and stutter, blucka blucka, raw and gutter
I'll go call your mother and that slut'll swallow all my nut up
'Till she cough my son up and that fucker is also your brother
I do him like Brenda, nigga get tossed in a dumpster
Make no mistake, I'm the greatest atheist, niggas know me
As they savior so pray or I'm making you niggas holy
Faker than silicone, you gay cause you niggas only
Going in on some shit when you raping your little homie

[Verse 3: Dice]
You niggas thinking you're sick, come and get your flu shots
After shots flew, drop you, then your crew drop
I'm letting a couple more fly, call that a new flock
Shots might break south, bullets through ya tube socks
I'll squeeze the MAC, leave you flat
Become a thing of the recent past
The only time your family sees you is when they dreamin, thinking back
Heat'll clap, leave you cats leaking for thinking and speaking bad
Put you niggas asleep in a bag, and I ain't speaking on sleeping bags
You say you on top of the city, like you Nino Brown
I'm able to leap tall buildings in a single bound
My shots leave your head spinning, fuck drunk or tipsy
I pull up, niggas break like the lunch truck is with me
I'll leave a punk chump slumped, such a fucking pity
I fuck monastery bitches, nuns fucking with me

[Verse 4: Kenny Siegel]
Hold a sec, I'mma thumb through my mental rap rolodex
And ass rape dummies, crash test dummy, I'm known to wreck
You make me sick to my stomach, your flow upset my solar plexus
I'll blow the TEC, now you in hell like you trying to hold ya breath
Nigga, I'm about as bad as your luck from a mirror crack
I'll twist a nigga's head near his back 'till I hear a snap
These niggas so soft that they gushy (less dangerous)
Yes, wankstas, (they rookies), sex changes, (fake pussies)
My flow's hot and liquid, it belongs in a f'n thermos
Toxic hot spit, send you niggas epidermis
Test and learn that death is hurtin'
Get urked when TECs is burstin'
Get murked when weapon's spurtin'
Leave holy as a reverend's sermon
I got these niggas wondering, how could a villain be so nice
I don't mean the internet, when I say I'm killing them on site
I'm dope, I'm great white, a great white from the beach
Want beef? The clips to my pistols all that's gon' come in peace

[Verse 5: Chino XL]
I'm spittin' it intricate, I belong to a sin syndicate
With infinite ways of killin' shit, and discriminantly I am different
Magnificently significant, specifically causing pestilence
I'm the infamous, God's instrument
Chino born of a hideous chrysalis with pistol whips
No questions, my impression is you feelin' nervousness
See heaven and hell, both ignoring your prayers
Keep talking, motherfucker, I'm killing your parents
Every nightmare got a Chino appearance
Ghetto vampire, no reflection in the mirrors
Turn your lights off, it's about to get serious
This is the type of song that'll make you change careers
Lyricy, terror see, never see, heresy, jealousy, lunacy, menacing
Energy, fantasy, medicine, pedigree
And I see hemorrhaging enemies in prison and banished
Do 'em like venison and take advantage of 'em
You can bet that I be cuttin' like a mad man Russian
Everybody wanna kill the Puerto Rican superhero
Till they hear the evil and they see the chainsaw buzzing
Chino's an animal outside your castle with catapults
From mass assaults with more soldiers and dogs than any land can hold
Launching, aiming flaming fire crossbows through the air and fog
Tear apart the endless walls and tears and scars and weird remarks
Pray I'm lost beneath the forest, stinkin' corpse deep in the morgue
But the beast evolved, speak to God, unsheath my sword (So meet the Moore)
Send in the military minotaurs
Bullets melt through you’re Mercede's metal doors
Raw like bully bizarre
You’ll be a skeleton skippin' skillfully through the graveyard
Medici madman, I got a gattle and it ain't matter
And I stay clappin' and straddlin' fragments of clavicle in chin
Collected in a medical metal tin
Straight jacket, insane bastard, for a strange jackal
To his face fractured from evasive cactus
I’m the breed that’ll feed a human centipede laxatives
My work ethic is epic, ethnic, eccentric, electric
Unexpectedly eclectic
It's nothing to get the women naked
I'll hop in a time machine and petition your birth
And get it signed by anyone that will ever walk on the face of this Earth
Not Luciferian, stop worrying about this brother Chino
That's unnecessary like fertility drugs in Puerto Rico
You're now witnessing the RICANstruction experience
Change my name to miscarriage, Chino's the sickest period[Hook x2]
I know I can be
A little hard to deal with so I stay
High as I can be
To get through the day without screaming

[Verse 1]
They call me Lyrical Jesus but don't make me get evil
If I put my hands on you it won't be to heal you
Sometimes I'm hoping that this life is just a bad dream
Cause I done seen things that make a dead nigga scream
"Where you been at?"
I'm questioned by my peers
But even Shakespeare disappeared for seven years
Then returned with the greatest work that a playwrite ever did
So counting Chino out really is not a bright idea
Manuel Barbosa, meet your son
I'm half Chalino Sanchez, half Big Pun
And as a shorty they would call me Chino Action
Was 10 years old at Def Jam trying to battle Run
11 years old in a juvenile cell
Lyrically already, you couldn't tell me I wasn't LL
I never failed I'm still a hell of a writing machine
Chino raises stakes like Van Helsing

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I'm like the pope, kiss the ring
How can I be anything else with so many tendancies of a king?
I'm like a veteran from Vietnam
My mind's numb, at time my grind shock you like electricians with sweaty palms
I met Gil Scott Heron on a long flight
He said, "Brother, you the type to make writers want to go and write."
How can I leave something I do so well?
I'm tired, my eyes glowing red like jewels from Hell
The hotels, sleepless night, the need for rifle power
More parasites than you can see from top of Eiffel Tower
They say my ego put me out of history
I'm so conceited I'm jealous when people envy me
I ain't scared to die, I'm very moody
Everybody gotta go sometime like jury duty
But why try me?
Even with all them Chinese kata's who try to master you can't tie Chi
No

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Yo, you know Chino from the Wake Up Show
The records, I Told U So
And Poison Pen and classic Here To Save You All
You ain't even a factor
So matter of fact I'mma mow your block down like I drive a John Deere tractor
Haters feel the threat
Cause the muscularity of Chino and an action figure's anatomically correct
Everybody likes to rattle a lion's cage
But no one wants to go in alone when his razors are displayed
Afraid of long scars, dim-witted as Chumlee on Pawn Stars
Still special like 50 Tyson's report card
All this Vicodin, Jack Daniel's and valiums
Bout it, blow them promos up, it's time to drop these albums
If I don't make it and I'm decomposing in a box
My influence lives on
I just won't be there to watch
Say, "He was the illest when he picked up that pen."
And judge me by my enemies as well as my friends
Gone

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
By the time you hear this, I'll be long gone
You keep the leather sofas and chrome
This place was never my home
Since I'm forever wrong
And you'll be better off living alone
And my life's far from a prom
So I don't need a chaperone
Got me wishing I was never born
Damn near every dawn
Women trynna change a nigga seemingly, is my life's song
I'm gettin a remix, can't afford Nate Dogg on a hook
But fuck reading my emails, bitch read a fucking book!
It took, great depression and supression of hate
To not do you like Laci Peterson or wild out like Robert Blake
I lie awake cause she tried to kill me in my sleep
That's why we can't stay together, like Jill Scott's front teeth
You should see her when she's looking at me
Winona Ryder couldn't steal enough shit to make this bitch happy
Sadly it's over, and it don't even phase me
Last way a woman changed me, was my diper as a baby
I'm feeling crazy, I'm a miserable individual
Cause we break up continual, like Nextel cellular signal
I've given you knowledge that goes beyond your understanding
But you blanket yourself in myth and missed all that I taught
I don't, think you've ever known a father's love
I feel like heartlessly dumping you, like Jennifer did to Cris Judd
I misjudged; had to break my phone to not call
Should've never got involved, you had my poster on the wall, bitch

[Hook]
(señora)
She's gonna change the world
(Senorita)
She can change the world
Mami can change the world
(ay querida)
But she can't change me
She's gonna change the world
(señora, senorita)
Mami can change the world
She's gonna change the world
(ay querida)
But she can't change me
(She can't change me)

[Verse 2]
Women want us to walk down the aisle to the alter, singing a hymn
The hidden meaning to them is I'll alter him
Make us type different, we can no longer hang with our friends
Ride on spectacular rims
No more banging Dominican twins
Makin feelings forbidden like Tom Cruise envisioning
Lenny Kravitz' musty ass smashing Nicole Kidman
But I refuse to riff with somebody that I live with
{right channel} Might not of always been right
{left channel} Damn sure should've left
Now I risk my freedom every time I see her
Our relationship's shakier than furniture from Ikea
The year the money came, we got along better riding the train
Now madness has taken its toll and I don't have exact change
She filed for child support, I accused her of being a whore
I feel like I'm in Hong Kong, how they wanna make this Singapore
It's raw lightning, realising your lady's hole
Is more famous than that hole they found Saddam hiding in
Surviving sickness and in health
In a black tux with a stick in front of an orchestra she couldn't conduct herself
It's just as well, I ain't sheddin no more tears
I've been with her for 2 decades, murderers get but 10 years
I swear the institution of marriage is like a mental institution
Except niggas give their freedom willingly
It's killing me, I can't see bein nobody's husband
Only thing men and women agree on is never to trust a woman
Yeah I cheated first, but you cheated worse
So now I feel like kicking you to the curb
And kicking the whole curb off the Earth
He's sick of her, she's sick of him, it's sickening
So take me as I am, or watch me as I go
You can't change me!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now suddenly, you want me to see
Every single thing you pointed out that's wrong with me
I'm sorry ma' but I'm all that I got
And I know you loved me when
It was on top of the world
And I was on the bottom of it
What is this, sick me to try to control me
The bleeding on me
When every breath I breath is still lonely
And I'm not standing here proclaiming to be perfect
Behind the curtains surface you become a shameless serpent
Working tirelessly to bring me down as a man
I let you into my life, whore, but now that door is slammed
It's 3am, my headlight's off, I put my gun on the dash
Our love and hate line's become thinner than Ginuwine's mustache
Finding myself addicted to the drama
Like if a woman don't give me no problem then I don't seem to want her
I gotta break the cycle of being psycho
A mean title deservedly unnervingly not being affected by you
At you pokes pins, character assassinations and prostitute friends
I want to shoot you in your fucking limbs
Kick 'em with my Camel Timbs until them bitches haemorrhaging
Anger every half hour outta 24 I'm averaging
The arrogance, you thinkin that I will never fuckin leave
Cause I'll reward ya for all this bad behaviour like if you're my seed
But I see now, this isn't necessarily meant to be
Sincerely I'm unhappy livin in misery, come rescue me
I've created my own prison from bad decision
One finger pointed at you is 3 pointed at me, see I'm the victim
Was with you instead of my daughters like every weekend
You're mad I wouldn't bow down like japanese people greeting
We was the finest Rican couple in Jimmy's café
Who would be thinking that we would've ended up this way
Mutual friends be speakin of how much you miss me
You should've never aborted my twins that saturday!

[Hook](Chorus)
You know, how I always do, Chino XL
With the skills thats tried and true, Chino XL
After all that I been through, Chino XL
Violate me, I'll murder you, Chino XL

(Verse 1)
These rappers don't want it with big Chino XL
I'll kick em in there necks and watch their bruised jaw swell
But all hail the last verbal murderer left, I'm certain death
Refer to me as less, but do it under their breath
Cause I be hearin the theft in they rhymes that they said
But when I see em they bowin down like they bout to give me head
I'm upset, yo lets get it on
Birds fly upside down over ya head, cause you ain't worth shittin on
Hard you on the radio, what would I change
The station when its on, I call the DJ and complain
Its a shame, your recording all wrong
You made a 3 minute song, thats 3 minutes too long
Got flex droppin a bomb for the king of metaphors
Remember they ain't stop makin guns after they made yours
Y'all shittin in y'alls drawers, wonderin if I'mma diss 'em listen
My rhymes tight when I piss it be whistlin
Your decision that testin my expertism in combat
I'll expose that your not real like the "Blair Witch Project"
As far as that album you dropped, I ain't feelin it
I wouldn't buy your record if it had a hundred dollar bill in it...
I'm killin it

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Scream what the chorus is at live performances
I be so high I be mistaking the whole front row for stewardesses
I proved who the rawest is as time passes
And fuck smoking weed, I'm smokin Bob Marley's ashes
Let me introduce you to that yellow nigga illin
Breakin sky scraper rappers down to they tenement buildings
Not respecting opinions or feelings, stop crying like women
You know you non-violent as Martin Luther King's sittings
Head spinnin, lieutenant, menace, don't listen
But me knee deep in the blood of your crew and your children
Your neck stiffens, forget riffing, when you see me
None of my gunshots are sound effect CD's
Emcee's talkin bout how they spit, and they shit
I do every bodily function on a nigga when I rip
My format pushes your entire crew into the floor mat
You'll be needin pet cemetary to try and bring ya dogs back

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Still floss on the daily, out of the ordinary
Surviving drunk driving with Halle Berry
The wildest of any emcees, I'm hostile and irresponsible
The ill tonsil Chino XL the stench of God's nostril
Collosal with the gothic, gospel goodwill
Win awards and thank XL for making all things possible
Philosophical thug till I stop breathin
I'm so ahead of my time, my parents still are in diapers and teething
Jesus' tears couldn't dampin me, horses can barely trample me
You bit me so hard, why ain't you just sample me
Chino XL's the wrong one to violate, primate
I don't even speak english, I speak hate
I cheat fate and move death closer, Derek Barbosa
I beat Macy Gray to death with Erykah Badu's poster
The new chocha that I hit on top of Luke's sofa
I'm her new owner, shes pickin me up in Huge's rover
Chino dissed me, rappers whine
To disrespect you, I would had to have respect for you at one time
I never did, and don't care, so come up on air
Put your money where your mouth is, make my crotch a millionaire
Air fair, exotic vacations
Bought my mom so many minks animal activist plot my assasination
I'm rockin from aggravation, shit on any compilation
Amazin with rhymes wrote while the president was Ronald Reagan

(Chorus) - repeat 2X(Different Girls talking on answering machine)
-Hey Chino! It's Tina! I missed you!! He he he ... um, Just wanted to say hello...

=I love you... you know I love you, right? You know I love you...

(Chino snorting)

(Chorus)

It's the lifestyle (What? Chionardo Dicaprio)
Welcome to my lifestyle (What What? Chionardo Dicaprio)
It's just the lifestyle (What? Chionardo Dicaprio)
Welcome to my lifestyle (What What? Chionardo Dicaprio)
It's the lifestyle (What? Chionardo Dicaprio)
It's just that thug in me
Welcome to my lifestyle (What What? Chionardo Dicaprio)
It's just the lifestyle (What? Chionardo Dicaprio)
That pretty thug in me
Welcome to my lifestyle (What what? Chionardo Dicaprio)

[Verse 1]
The hopeless, Spanish romantic like Zorro
Never soft though, the hard core Don Juan Demarco
I find y'all lady weak in this, prompt to her eagerness
And be fucking her ridiculous, astounded by her fickleness
The Villianess, pimp polygamist, bigger bigamist
Intelligent as master of kama sutra cunnilingus
I leave your thug boyfriend stunned
When it comes to fine rappers I'm one of the few you females got to choose from
These cheap niggas where y'all find them? (I don't know)
They like promise you a condo, and can't afford a condom
Complained about your man so I robbed him
Confused bitches crying like "Chino, please untie him!"
The mental Samuel Jackson, the physical Adonis
Only sexual with women who can suck the comas out of novels
Fuck them 'till their knees wobble
My house like a brothel
Welcome to the night of the apostle of the lady gospel

(Chorus w/ slight variations)

[Verse 2]
If a woman's heart is an endless ocean of secrets
I run scuba teams to the bottom discover jewels and keep it
Her body is a violin, I'm the violinist and I compose
Her moans are my symphonies I can play the perfect notes
Before being famous
Chicks asked to touch my hair seduction's what the game is
I intimidate them cus I'm prettier that they is
And in bed I'm gifted
And I assume every woman's in love with me 'till they tell me different
Since preschool ladies thinking that Chi's cool
I fucked the teacher, it's tragic: a nun
The school it was catholic
Keeping these women spending money on me
Sticking Indian chicks for their dowries
Thinking they fine
If they married the ghetto Banderas gentlemen call
And have mammy's in-laws tell brides leave their sons at the altar
I'm smarter, I'll marry your daughter: 'Till the morning!
I charge pimp niggas for hoes reckless eyeballing (yeah)
Ain't leaving young girls out of it...
My dick becoming their pride so naturally gotta make them swallow it
I fucked all races, bagged bitches in all places
Older chicks, younger chicks... shit, I brought together generations!
They get financially gracious
Just to date me on a regular basis
With making love I got patience
And I'm a dog just like you, in all cases
But I can make a woman feel love even coming in their faces

(Chorus w/ slight variations)

[Verse 3]
8 out of every 10 chicks are attracted to me...
One is a relative, and the other one a damn liar!
Leave your girl alone with me commit vagina-cide
Since '99, I'm no longer in pimp denial
Cus I'm a playa, plus I fuck a lot
Please, I got more hoes then these niggas just in names beginning in A's
Pass on more Trojans they will ever get
I'll have to take Ginkgo or some shit to remember half the bitches I hit
Act a nigga wise! Rap a nigga wise! It's obvious
Son got doe but look how ugly and sloppy he is
One girl's man threatened me with the mafias
I laughed and explained in detail where every mole on his wife body was
Music and sex the only joy
When it comes to Trojans been through so many I could invade Helen of Troy
Single dominant A-male, getting pussy by mistake
How much hate mail can one pretty nigga generate?
Wasn't delicious bullets missing me by little inches
Now actress bitches suck my dick and do my dishes
+Kiss the Girls+ I'm world renown
For collecting bitches bi-coastally without Morgan Freeman hunting me down
I'm awesome but you +low-some+... what a damn shame
I done heard "Nigga, you fine!" so much I kinda thought that was my name
Mr. Perfect impregnates no dame
My sperm worth more than uncut cocaine
I know why these thugs in these clubs can't behave
Form forty-eight hours the lack of pussy making then brave
Never seen a world tour
But I've fucked like I've won Oscars, two Grammy's and twenty Soul Train Awards (bitch)
Squash beef with 'Pac and 'em
Cus I was too busy studying pimping under Ice-T and Freddie Foxxx and 'em
No jealousy, please dunny it's just my life
Don't be mad cus your girl would rather by my whore than be your wife

(Chorus w/ slight variations)

(Chino talking)

As if... as if...

Yo 'Ziz nigga,... this bitch is gonna ask me
"Why the fuck I had her on hold for so long?"
I said "Bitch! Don't you know the silence of me
Having you on hold is more important than anything
Any motherfucker on the planet could be saying to you?"

It's just my lifestyle[Verse 1]
Dear rap game, you're so whack, we feel like suing you
Niggas dressed up, nowhere to go like atheists at they funerals
My revolution's beyond musical, my violence on auto-pilot
I can’t be morally neutral or silent to the truth you coward (nah)
I fire out of control
Much different than the human resources department at your job letting you go
The V for vendetta vet, showing your fickle fans that
You're garbage in every category and in categories that ain't even invented yet
(Yeah) I'm feeling wild lately
I don't know how to die, kill you, you can educate me
I'm back when the game is horrible
I stepped right out of Stan Lee's imagination, Chino was a living Marvel
I smoke stems with niggas that's sinning, won't bend
Leave you between a rock and a hard place like Stonehenge
I can count on one hand rappers I'm greater than, but wait a minute
Only if there's a calculator in it, the number's so infinite (it's crazy)
I spit it, authentic, arsenic, acidic
So commited I should be commited, I'm tired of being counterfeited
The Lyric Jesus never smile
Keep it super ugly like a Forest Whitaker and Whoopi Goldberg love child
Outrageous, cops racist, frown and smile tazers
My eyes burning from the salt with the tears of a thousand angels
I wanna topple the nation crazed in the Fist of Fury
I spit it ice cold, no refrigeration necessary

[Hook]
Every rhyme I write, gettin' closer to God
Every rhyme I write, gettin' closer to God
Drop an ill verse, verbal assault
Lyrical, genius
Every rhyme I write, gettin' closer to God
Every rhyme I write, closer to God
Every rhyme I write, gettin' closer to God

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, it’s time to melt down your debit card
Welcome to my demented mind, blood is the cover charge (yeah)
Fuck around I will destroy thee
Retarded like a lot of movie theatre employees
Murder everything, end of discussion
Gained attention like an Amber Rose wardrobe malfunction (yeah)
Video ass-whippings, your homie’s like “You seen this?"
His snotbox busted, I don’t mean containers of Kleenex (get ‘em)
You wish you weren’t involved with the horror
I pull the revolver tomorrow, your people holding candlelight vigils for ya
Gorilla suplex a nigga off of a tall building
Stab him in his face at the bottom, make sure I’ve killed him (die!)
Hold fire like Prometheus, diction deviant
My flow the freakiest like the daughters of Southern white racists preachers is
The beast’ll smash in the speakers to pieces
When I spit a sequence elitist-ly fiendish you’ve never experienced previous
See me breed a phoenix that could bleed a phoenix to the deepest
Reaches where your feet is 'til you’re in dire need of orthopedics (crazy!)
The cast of The First 48 is askin questions
It’ll take three episodes for them to find your severed midsection
They never seen such savagery, my angry energy
Have nucular reactors look like triple-A batteries
No experiment, my pen’s a hero to heroines
Sick like Reese Witherspoon with a spoon cooking up some heroin
I sin but I’m trying to escape this base bondage
I’m garbage, breathing, burning lakes of lava and carnage
Hip-Hop’s in crisis but my veins contain Christ nitrous
So precise it says Lyric Jesus on my driver’s license

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I often, beat a crippled man with his own cane
Far from, close to being emotionally sane
Caution, sick criminals lurk in the terrain
Gotham, I have the most abnormal tolerance to pain
Monster, Chino XL but they call me Santo Sangre
Here’s some trivia, my derivative lineage is straight
From the Virgin Mary, scary when the muzzle flash
Flash tear through your abs like fake Chinatown Gucci bags (okay)
I got a terrible cerebral verbal virus
Neuroleptic narcotics, my hand’s so shaky I can barely light this
Light this, angel dust got me loopy (got me loopy)
All after Thought like a Roots groupie (Roots groupie)
You bet your life that what I write is mega-trife
And better than getting head from your hated archenemy’s pregnant wife
I constantly conquer the conquerors with cocky confidence
Chino the ominous will mollywop the populous (yeah!)
Where them guns you supposedly holding and toting?
I’m placing coins over both of your eyes for the devil’s totem
Bullets discharge and get lodged to your chest like a corsage
While I’m hitting your squad with a force of Thor, that’s the Norse god
Flesh wounds color like a collage, witness your corpse fried
You hear more cries than when the lead singer of The Doors died (crazy!)
RICANstruction stomping like Sasquatch
‘Til my heart stops pumping like Dick Clark’s

[Hook][Verse 1]
Was whipping a Benz through Bel Aire
Looking like shawty off of Slumdog Millionaire (Roll down your window)
She asked me where I been all her life
Well since you think I was born yesterday I guess our timing's just right (Right)
Every night, staying at each other's house
I call her coupon, she make me want to cut the bullshit out
Independent brand, skinny waist as she slept, ass fat
Practically no covers left on my side of the bed
Deep after a couple of weeks
Asking about past freaks, beefing like Nas and Kelis
Bust windows out my car like Jasmine Sullivan's song
I ain't know whether to marry her or kidnap her noisy mom
We off and on until the coffin
If I lost her I'd be blue like the homie from The Watchmen
That mixture of love and hate that'll make you levitate
But pray for asthma cause I think about her every time I breathe
For real

[Hook]
(To the world)
I'm kinda confused it's the craziest
(To the world)
Am I king or a fool? It's the craziest

[Verse 2]
Packs a pink pistol in her purse
She makes the cutest mean little frown when I spit a verse (She's so fine)
Just looking at her always keeps me on hard
Rub her back, bubble baths, Cinemax After Dark (Dark)
We argue, she thinks everything is my fault
But the shit that really turns me on is when she slick talk
She know my past, know I'm capable of no good
While your nerd bitch makes you sit and watch The Notebook
Jealousy and bad temper
We two mechanical toys that's trying to wind up together
I hit it like I'm never gon' get it again
The kitchen, the den, the top of the washing machine on spin
I'm her zombie when she's nude
So jealous she'll probably follow me into a confession booth (She's psycho)
Even the father told me she loved me
But said, "Get a vetenarian, you both are sick puppies." (That's crazy!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pleases me in all instances
So I'm not experimenting with no mistresses (Not at all)
Even when we disagree we still hold hands
Somebody try to play me, she'll damn near kill a man (Kill a man)
I told her I was working she said, "Prove it yo."
Then showed up with a camera crew of Cheaters to the studio (So crazy)
So maybe I am suicidal
But we are beautifully bound together like pages of an old Bible
Shoe game up and her cooking tight
She give the kind of head you wanna look forward to every night
She inspires me and never breaks her promises
Without her my life would be in ruins like archaeologists
I figure it's God's design
Like Sade's records, she's only got better with time (Time)
She's still crazy but it's minor
Now we got a little baby girl that looks just like her that I love

[Hook]
