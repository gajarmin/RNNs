[Intro]
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (When it's on that's who you get, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (That's your motherfucking clique, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (You a motherfucking snitch, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna shine like me (me), rhyme like me (me)
Then walk around with a 9 like me (me)
They want to do it 3 to 9 like me
And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Ayo, you think about shitting on 50, save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David
I teach niggas sign language, that ain’t deaf, son
*click* *click* you heard that? That mean run
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa
Pull through, I'll throw a fucking cocktail at ya car
From the last shootout I got a dimple on my face
It’s nothing, I can go after Mase’s fan base
Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out
I don't smile a lot cause ain't nothing pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city
Hoes be like "Fiddy, you so witty"
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn

[Hook]
If you get shot and run to the cops you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me dude, you not like me

[Verse 2]
Mama said everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk to him I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy cause I don't fear man
Cause I fear when I kill a man God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan?
I been could've killed these niggas, I'm still waitin'
In the telly with two whores, Benz with two doors
32 karats in the cross, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock, Tony carry my M-1
Hold me down, nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waiting for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga, don't knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me
I'm the one

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
The good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range with a Glock, I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch getting in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a .38, it’s special y'all
Country boy tell ya, I’m finna blow
I’m more like a pimp than a trick, you know
See, I’m in this for the paper, but I don’t love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worried about mines
Grown ass men wearing starter piece shines
You know them little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit, dawg, won’t you stop it?
Shorty, I been watching you watching me
Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me?


[Hook][Hook: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna thug you, baby
One dose of your lovin
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes, swangin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feelin' like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'm a be chasin' the chickenhead, you're on somethin'
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
Before I head home I'm a stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy

[Hook: Joe]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Bitches be frustrated with a baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nuttin more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin and movin, cruisin after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surroundin me, houndin me, tryin to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your homey

[Hook: Joe]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Yeah
Don't know what fuck me up more: watchin her lick her lips
Or watchin' her walk; she hypnotized me with her hips man
I sweet talk her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now; I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours
Big house, big Benz - girl it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past; fuck what happened before you
Cause it means somebody's gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here- let me touch on you; I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you; you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you, and you can ride on
We can do it all the night; we can have a baller night

[Hook: Joe] - repeat 2X w/ variations[Intro: Puff Daddy]

[Uncredited vocals]
I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love

[Notorious B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn
To all my Uptown
To all my Bronx
To all my Queensbridge

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick - you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues; with the boots, with trees
Smoking weed, flipping keys, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm bagging you
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make them wet in their pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out

[Hook: 50 Cent] (x2)
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel us nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fo' sho'!

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo, we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya'
Get mad do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., because fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North bound first stop, Watertown or Fishscale
Where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha-ha, yo chief, pass the buddha

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hand in hand
Even my P.O., she called me "the Ginger Bread Man"
I catch a new case, and tell her ass: "Catch me if you can"
Don't let your people fill you up with octane, I'm not playing
Get gassed up, to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it: thou shalt not fuck with, nor see Poppa
50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off proper
There's no place like home, New York! New York!
I run this city, and I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they're smacked silly
Or sprayed with the MAC milli, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics, like Milli Vanilli
In the hood they feel me {*Gun cock*} ha! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit {*Gunshot*}
Every bootlegger you know, pump my shit - bitch!

[Hook]{Gunshot}
[Man talking]
Yo, Red Spyda (ooh-wee) is that 50 Cent/Pac joint ready?
{Gun cocking} Let me know, holla {Gunshot}

[2Pac - from the song "Smile"]
There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future

[50 Cent talking]
Yeah nigga! Haha
Let's go nigga, this is what it is
2Pac cut his head bald
Then you wanna cut yo' head bald (You pussy nigga!)
2Pac wear a bandanna
You wan' wear a bandanna
(What do we have here now?)
2Pac put a cross on his back
You wanna put crosses on yo' back
Nigga you ain't 2Pac - This 2Pac!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained
Military mind of a thug lord, sittin' in the cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, Wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi-shotty, everybody's listenin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight

[Hook: 50 Cent + (2Pac)]
'Till Makaveli returns, it's "All Eyez On Me"
(What do we have here NOW?)
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gon' be
You should've listened, I told you not to fuck with me
(What do we have here NOW?)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gon' see
[Gun cocking, gunshot]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Now since you're crying for mercy I promise
My success'll be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold your soul
Nigga there's nothin' left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot
But you're not (now) - I see it so clear
You can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up your spine
God made men the same boy, but your heart ain't like mine
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace
I was playing with guns
While your momma had your punk-ass playing tennis
I'm a nightmare, you see me when you dream
Wake up, turn on your TV and see my ass again
You cowardly-hearted, you couldn't make it on your own
Fuck The Source, I'm on cover of Rolling Stone
Hahahaha
(You pussy!)

[Hook x2]"When I wake in the morning love..
And the sunlight hurts my eyes..
And something without warning love..
Bears heavy on my mind.."

[Twista]
Let's get them dollars, let's get this money
Y-yeah, keep my mind on my..

I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
I got my finger on the trigger, stayin on the grind
Now when I wake up in the mornin I gots to hit a lick
Saw the 2003 Navi' on Spre's with a kick
Soon as my eyes see the sunshine
My thoughts is jukin the block and dodgin it one time
Peep how we movin them rocks and the pounds of dro 'fore I double my shit
I can serve 16 ounces plus 6 and get back 96
A killer for the scrilla, nigga, best not be stoppin
I gots to get them bigger, figures, fuck what you talkin
I represent the niggas ballin with jewelry full of sickles
Down to the niggas chasin million, that dream servin nickels
And I know - one day, I'm gon', come up
And when you see me don't hate, that I, roll up
Get paid whether you Legit when you slang, or tippin off 'caine
Until I take a dip in the Range I'm flippin them thangs
Gotta get some money mayn

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely dayyyy
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely dayyyy

[Twista]
A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that
I'm makin money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks
And if I ain't sellin no records, I'm servin 'em packs
I got a - clip full of hollows, money-makin's my motto
Semi-auto when my blow's in a bottle 'til I hit the lotto
With dreams of ownin a record label flippin words
My nigga flippin buildings better than he was flippin birds
I got the - mentality and the motive, I'm on a mission
For the money you can get it too, it's all about yo' ambition
Play yo' position, provide the plans and follow procedures
And a six hundred blunted with a pocket full of hundreds and Visas
Love when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cop then I get back up
Love when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when the grips stack up
And still in the evenin if I'm sleepin paper products
Soon as I get up, it's just another day another dollar
Gotta get that money mayn

[Hook]

[Twista]
Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin rollin Jags
Got love for the thug niggas who get it on the Ave
Love for those who can make a mil' and sit back and laugh
And love for the fine strippers who get it poppin ass
Love for the single parents that's workin through the struggle
Love for those who gotta make a livin movin muscle
Love for those who gotta watch the haters rollin bubbles
Causin trouble every time a young brother try to hustle
And if I can't legally make a knot
Then I gotta get right back on the block
And if it ain't no work we do a stick-up and whip up a concoction
I leave you face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money mayn

[Hook]

[Anthony Hamilton]
When I wake in the morning love, ohh-ohh-ohh..
And the sunlight hurts my eyes, ohh-ohh ohhh..
And something without warning love, ohh-ohh-ohh..
Bears heavy on my mind..

[Hook] - fades outLL[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Uh, I learnt the game, I know what I want and I'm in it
The time is now, it's gonna be up in a minute
You look a nigga in the eye, you could tell if he timid
These fake rappers gettin by with these hell of a gimmicks
They act like it's all love, only love is your money
So when it's over nigga, are you a thug or a dummy, I'm neither
But I been hot so long, it feels like I got a lifetime fever
And I ain't gotta spit, I could cough and still eat ya
And fuck rap I make mils of reefer, I'm a man first
Tired of punching niggas, so I'mma shoot niggas cuz my hands hurt
And God is great, guard ya space
One hand wash the other, both wash the face
And I head crack so much, it's hard to ace
.38 revolver flow, its hard to trace, what!

[Hook - Styles P (Jadakiss)]
Fuck that, pop off till nothing in the clip left (pop off)
Till nobody in his clique left (nobody)
Hole in the head, slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened (tell em it's the Kiss Of Death)
Hustle hard till none of them bricks left (nothin left)
Stick it up till not a crumb on the strip left (take that, take that)
Make sure ain't a chain or a chip left (uh uh)
If they asked what happened (tell em' its the Kiss Of Death)
Tell em Kiss (THE KISS OF DEATH!)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
This is LOXville
And even White America'll let y'all negros know Jada got skill
You a Jackass like Johnny Knoxville
So I can just imagine how ya pops feel (damn!)
And you ain't worth my shells
So you should just imagine how the ox feel
A lotta niggas is thousandaires
Walking round town, fronting like they got mils
For what it's worth, I'm one myself
But my strength in the hood outruns my wealth
But you still might catch Kiss in some Hot Wheels
New Bentley coupe, with the stock wheels (Haha)
Look how I get back to it, I send my young niggas to do it, in the black Buick
I don't spit bars, or distribute the crack fluid
All I'm really waiting on is for niggas to act stupid

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
To all my real niggas, sorry for keeping you waitin', (sorry)
It's ironic, but the god was beefin with satan
I love y'all tho, my niggas for even relatin', (i love y'all)
This ain't Kiss talking neither, I'm speakin for Jason, (mwah)
When you a problem it's harder to keep them from hatin
Niggas jaws is like laws though, easy to break em
If I wasn't on some shit, I'm gettin on it
Come to me with ya hand out to me, I'm spittin on it
I don't wanna hear what happened, matter of fact, I don't even care what happened
Might as well declare the clappin
Cuz my bones is old, gotta lotta wear and tear from scrappin
Hate a nigga that, ain't never there to see shit, but always hear what happened
The thing better than money, is respect
No love this time, nigga, Kiss Of Death, what!

[Hook][Intro]
Get the fuck up, muthafucka

[Verse 1]
Ayo, when I step up in the bar everybody hit the fuckin' floor
Lucky mothafuckas make it to the door
Cause when I spit on mic's I spit raw
Which cause confusion from the bar to the dance floor
I keep the club owner vexed
Cause he gotta pay me when I spit plus replace a lotta shit
Niggas get to wilding
When my words echoes the room like (Get your hand out my pockets)
You sock shit while my topics rocking
I'm banned from clubs cause of my toxic tonsils
Loud speaking like a fuckin' sports announcer
I spit the Blaha 'til you rush the bouncer
Or rush the mothafucka in your way who's bouncing
You know O. Trice get the gats pronouncing

[Hook]
Get live mothafucka when I speak mothafucka
Out your seat mothafucka, I'mma reach mothafuckas
Shady Records until I sleep, mothafucka
Obie Trice, nothing but street, muthafucka
Tear this bitch up 'til you bleed, mothafucka
I wouldn't give a fuck who you be, mothafucka
Punk, pussy, bitch or G, mothafucka
Adrenaline rush before you leave, mothafucka

[Verse 2]
When I speak I blow out your tweeters, a dog
Show out with speakers, roll out with heaters
I'm just a animal eating the game
Jump a monkey, fuck yeah, Obie's the name
I roll solo never been a ho, though
Keep gats vocal when cats act loco
Where you at when I'm moving the crowd
You get trampled, mashed on Detroit style
Up out your seats, pump out the E's
Up the beats, the crowd "Obie, please"
Where my niggas at, smoking them trees
Off the cognac finger fucking a skeez
That's how it is when you party with me
You don't like it? You L7 like a square be

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And since I came, I've rearranged the place with blaze
Stage dive with Colt Seavers, DNA
I'm so addicted to getting niggas lifted
Drunk off the liquid, O. Trice, the misfit
Dousing the crowd with piss and bile
We underground, mothafucka fix your frown
I be the boy with the whiskey toy
Offa whiskey, you never been to skeet before
So, throw up your hands and peep out your man's
When I come through, next quarter Trice intervene use
And trust, I'm attacking it
I cook up the hot shit like Ainsley Harriott
That's why I'm so miraculous and Obie gets you niggas pumped up
I'll see you next coliseum, chump
That's right, it's your Obie Trice fucked up off E's and weed

[Hook][Intro]

[Hook][Intro]
Money make a pimp, pimp hoes
Hustlers sell dope, thugs gun smoke, what?
Money make the world go round as the world turns
Money make the world go round as the world turns

[Verse 1]
Nigga I need money to maintain, hustlin' ain't a game
Nigga go against the grain gon' get tore out the frame
TVs in the Range, I'm into nice thangs
I slang weed, cocaine and heroine
50 Cent, that's my name, nigga I bring the pain
You thought shit stay the same, nigga shit gon' change
Put a bullet in your brain, nigga at close range
Run away with ya rollie, your rings and your motherfuckin chain
Ain't nothing funny mang, I'm about my money mang
Bitch get down on that track and get my money, I ain't playin
Better understan what I'm sayin what I'm sayin, I ain't playin
I'll be in front of your crib, layin, with the Mac to start sprayin
Any nigga that's in the game, for the fame, gotta be a lame
Crackers'll put ya in chains, box'll drive you insane
Sun can't shine all the time, man it's gotta rain
That ho loose as hell, you betta crack the whip, mang

[Hook]
A pimp ain't a pimp with no mothafuckin' hoes
A hustler ain't a hustler with no mothafuckin' dough
A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke
A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke

[Verse 2]
I live life in the fast lane
Man I ain't got nuttin to lose, everything to gain
Either you with me or against me man ain't nuttin change
Nigga, you.. go against the grain, I'll make you.. walk with a 'caine
Now nigga now who you gon' blame when shit ain't the same
Nigga nobody hears your name, you got down wit a gang
O thirty-one blood, y'all niggas do your thang
You got two felonies, fuck it, go out with a bang
Y'all niggas wanna hang with niggas that filthy rich
They ain't even got to talk to take your bitch
One look was all it took, she seen the Benz-o
She seen them TVs and them big old rims, holmes
Ayo the bitch useta bring you dough used to be your bottom ho
Now your paper comin' slow, she feel like she had to go
Roll with them rich niggas and ball with them ballers
Politic with the willies the real shot callers

[Verse 3: Bun B]
I got one life to live, follow that light that keeps on guidin me
Haters tryin me, hoes is a-bidein me, media ride me
King of the Underground so the streets is steady hiding me
Representin sure tasters, the yay' keep takin pride in me
Streets Deciple slide-in me, status reports the badest
You caught walk in the black top wit fat rocks and had his newport
I can't stay away like Too $hort, I gots to break a bastards back
Tore em up, get lem ready to port, put 'em on the master track
I blast the facts the life in the grill, gorilla pimpin
If I have to mack ya wife then I will, it's me and 50 Cent
My nigga, live in trife, and thats real, talkin shit on us
Thats like pullin out a knife and dont kill, that's on the Trill
I'm on for million wit your pit, in the clit that shit true
I split through, your defences, so relentless, get you
Without you even knowing got you strippin and even hoeing
You don't wanna let the pro in the door, this what we showin

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines?
Is your bitch your bitch all the time?
You done got your paper, now it's time I get mines
Except the serve and everything'll be fine, bitch

[Outro]
Runnin from pimpin, bitch you need to run to some pimpin
Wit them cheap ass payless shoes you got on ho
You still ain't figured out what a ho supposed to look like
Look at you motherfucka here, huh bitch?
How you gunna catch some dates lookin like that ho?
Bitch get off the sidewalk and into the street
Bitch the sidewalk is for pimpin bitch![Hook]
Guess whos coming to dinner.. mighty D–block
Guess whos coming to dinner.. mighty mighty D–Block

D-Block- oh-oh-oh-oh D- block

[Sheek Louch]
(louder, louder, yeh, Don Don)
Okay I lyrically ejaculate
I come on tracks go ‘head and hate
Go inside, run and hide
Coz this gon boost the murder rate
Flying with the long behind me
Nickel plate, extra shiny
Got this woman on my tip like they name is Tiny
Every hood, light is up, dark liquor, plastic cup
Sour diesel, hoodie on, gun out like what the fuck
Porsche turbo, yankee blue, Derek Jeter of his crew
Rosé, feet up, deuce deuce in my shoe
Ten years on radio, ten years on mixtapes
Did deals with everybody, even survived the Puff rape
Now I’m all bossed up, watch all glossed up
D block, we hard in the streets, put your signs up

[Hook]

[Jadakiss]
(aha, the one and only, the mighty might)
Money ain't shit to me, respect means more to me
We define loyalty
This is rap royalty
Let the fo five off, live for, die for
Hustle is my first love, and the streets my side ho
Haze then im back to sour
Okay im back in power
Business man nine to five, hooligan after hours
Ain't nobody to compare to what we contribute
The bars is like the possession, with intent to distribute
My hand, wrist, ears and neck laid
Nothing but straight fire for a decade
Im in the polo rounds, polo down
Feelin like when Tony put Manolo down
Ya all know who control the town

[Hook]

[Bully]
This is for my Looters and shooters
With them deserts, and rugars and lugers
Who was newest to beat, talk to us, huh?
I got ‘em don don, fully black armani yan(?)
Mi not play wit dem facey boys, shut it down
Keep my barrel spinnin, thats why ratty warm
Have you marked for death, you’re whole family gone
Got em pounds of thatgreen we call it the Hawks
D- Block, one time, we call it new york
Get money, hit honeys on the regular
Bully stay in peoples ear like a cellular
Now the World and your girl they all know my name
Got em Trey Songing, Bullys insane

[Styles P]
Never been to Yonkers before neither enterpreneur
And im a monster for sure
Like Godzilla
Shoot is on your death, cut ya deck like a card dealer
Puffin on the lies, spent a buck at the car dealer
They tryna say d block is negative
Any rapper breathing is breathing cause we let em live
I can tell you why these soft suckas mad at me
They can see I got every kind of flags with me
Honor flags,? flags, game flags
Its a d block, everywhere we bangs at
Money long, run long, bullets long
Word to your hood, if you got a hood, put it on

[Hook]I was mislead, but once I found the way
I convinced a group of 19 that they should drown today
How I flipped it, clipped it after madness
Then the dead came back and haunted the wrong address
Cause they some stupid dead motherfuckers
Just like all you bitches and Weathermen fluffers
And I get my shoes polished
By the best open mic emcees , paying Timberlands homage
In this day and age if your deck ain't playing Cage
You're probably disgruntled you missed his funneled mayonnaise
Or I ain't get the right pub
My whole career been a upstream kayak through blood
My tools love, seeing the face of opponents
Seconds before their skull and wig savor the moment
Light up a J, cast silence over bobbing heads
Stuck underground, shit I might as well rob the dead

[Hook]
Give this to the DJ then trash the clubs
Lick the cover of my CD then see what acid does
Don't just stand there looking like some average thugs
If there's a chick standing next to you then grab her jugs
And if you ain't grabbin' the dough when they ask for love
Then you come back to the crib wearing a mask and gloves
Then you go back to the club stinking of ass and blood
Yoke some kid up, dig his pockets and snatch the drugs

I took a backwards education
Studied some shit with broken navigation
All this anti-Cage demonstratin'
I don't pray to Satan
I pray on agents makin'
Shapeable minds
Capable of firing traceable 9's
But not at any pigs that make their snout's seen
I don't know what I wrote til' I spit and my mouth bleeds
Look, more patterns to market
Not even naming I'm standin' a walkin' target with shoppers that look at me
Awkward
Granted I got a cannon and my freakin' mouth's leakin'
Cause my crew put more dust in the air than house keeping
If you sleeping you're getting woke the fuck up
Like you're parents while you bought this and smoke the fuck up
With so much drama in the NYC
I carry 9 millimeter in the back of taxi
While I thought music prevented GOV servants
In the cycle of brain wash entertainment's the detergent

[Hook]

If my thought patterns
Brought ? to war fathoms
And spit violence and death, then kids start gatherin'
Bloody ear canal
Hold it down with a towel
Cause by the time the verse hatch your stomach's hangin' out
We got a verse on the loose, let's get these mouth zippers
Buy six drinks a night then wake up and wear 'em as house slippers
I'm just fuckin' with you bitch, don't get offended
This ain't your average anti-pop record with a happy ending
Go ask your block
School body and bastard pops
How the fuck you get your hands on acid drops
Music television repellent for kids with extreme views
Start torchin' labs to light your team's fuse
Forgotten, plottin', rotten student, been truant
I keep my hands in it with no tangible influence
Whether a Clockwork Orange or a murderous night
A book of what my pops did to Tony Burgess's wife

[Hook][Verse 1]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Asian
Who have the weekend occasion
Sneak in the Days Inn
I'm never tweakin' off hazin', frequently blazin'
Now if they ain't on ya face it ain't the cheeks that I stays in
Can't deny it, used to take weeks of persuasion
Now I just be lookin' down at these freaks in amazement
With a girl, the first thing I peep or notice
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is
So, you ain't gotta be perfect
I'll buy you whatever you want, but your head's gotta be worth it
Still what I mean is
Your brain gotta send chills through my penis
'Til I feel like a genius
Look at it from a playa's position
I got a scholarship, I get smart without payin' tuition
My classes be like two, three hours
That's why I'm the smartest young guy since Doogie Howser

[Hook]
Still what I mean is
I really just wanna get smart until I feel like a genius
And all that I ask is
That you help me get good grades in all of my classes
Still what I mean is
I really just wanna get smart until I feel like a genius
And all that I ask is
That you help me get good grades, Ma in all of my classes

[Verse 2]
These bitches they done got real bad
Cause now I pull out, leave 'em lookin' like models for a "Got milk?" ad
I'm a teacher's pet
And even if you good at math ma
You'll have trouble countin' each baguette
All it takes wit' hood tutors is some good buddha
And promise to buy them some of them Razor foot scooters
They don't care where the cops is
Outta the blue they stop biz
Teacher start givin' me a pop quiz
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs
Pocket full of green, Duke on it that invented the light bulb
I might pass on a female, and call up a substitute just for night
Class in the CL
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared
Can't tell her from givin' my dick CPR
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurtin', before squirtin'
It's for certain
You are the weakest link, "Goodbye"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know my girls in North and South Caddy
They all for mouth waxin'
And the whores in Texas, oral sexes
I head to Cali, take more blows to the head than Ali
And the Philly mamies suck the kid outta Willie Bonnie
And the way females show southern hospitality in ATL
Don't even know them hoes
In South Beach, they let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece
Forget about Vegas, the head is outrageous
The broads in Seattle will make ya knees rattle
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in VA
Them hoes in Detroit will suck the whole Brevoort
My dick don't get to die down when I'm in Chi-Town
My bitches in B-More, blow me 'til they knees sore
Good damn, there face I, ain't screwed out in St. Lou'
New York, it ain't got no pipe instructions
They just suck it outta you like liposuction

[Hook][Intro]
Hey, I'm looking for {"Good love, yeah"}
Met a lot of women out there on tour
Ran through them all but I'm just not sure
{"Good love, I like that baby"}
Yeah, we're going to fight but I think that's just {"Good love, yeah"}
(That's the sound right here baby... it feels so good)
First class flights, almost home
But I {"Just can't keep still!"} Let's go:

[Verse 1]
Fresh off the plane, into the Bent'
Note a little more than what you pay for your rent
I'm tired of the road, no shows booked
Need something home cooked {"I like that baby"}
Straight in the door, straight to the floor
I'm already high but light up one more
Just got home I'm trying to chill but I {"Just can't keep still!"}
Gotta hit the block, get a little 'gnac
Fuck with the hood, see if niggas is good
Jake is on me asking me why my music all loud
I just tell him {"I like that baby"}
Throw a little dice, head crack twice
Light something up I'm starting to feel nice
They looping around, let me go and peel
Cause I {"Just can't keep still!"}
[Hook]
Hey, I'm looking for {"Good love, yeah"}
Met a lot of women out there on tour
Ran through them all but I'm just not sure
{"Good love, I like that baby"}
Yeah, we're going to fight but I think that's just
{"Good love, yeah"}
First class flights, almost home
But I {"Just can't keep still!"} Let's go

[Verse 2]
Hat low enough, short sleeves no cuffs
Aston-Martin sitting outside tough
Shorty shotgun, black Hillary Duff
Sheek do it big like I was down with Puff
Now I'm in the club, no V.I.P
I'm down low where every last hoodlum be
I feel baby boy trying to ice grill me
But I {"Just can't keep still!"}
Walk up to him, you know nice and polite
Let him now it's real, lift the shirt up light
I'mma let it off cause I ain't trying to fight
But, you dead right {"I like that baby"}
Anyway, I'm trying to see who else here
I see shorty staring at me way over there
I'm sorry baby girl but I gotta disappear
Cause I {"Just can't keep still!"} Ha ha ha~!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Betty Wright knocking, got 'em all rocking
About to do the electric slide on the block and
Yeah this popping, got them going crazy
From 8 to 80 {"I like that baby"}
It feels so good, you can't sit down
You gotta get up and move your fat ass around
You don't care who watching, you keeping it real
Cause you {"Just can't keep still!"} Let's goIntro: Shaq

Yo yo
This jam right here dedicated to all the little bad knuckleheads runnin'
Around
Gettin' in trouble
Just follow your dreams and you'll be aight


Hook: Peter Gunz

Yo it was all a dream
Deprising and uprising my schemes
But suprising realzing that
Yo it was all a dream
I kept my head above the water for cream
But now I'm turnin' all heads when I step on the scene
(yesterday it was just a dream
Never thought this could ever happen to me)
It was all a dream
(how a change came around in my life)


Verse 1: Shaq

I went back and forth from ??? to chilltown JC
At first it's just me and mommy
Then Phil came along, he bought a basketball go to the park
Get your game on Shaq but have your butt back by dark
I was acting like the doc, my game was the joint
Dribbilin' between my legs like Norm Nixon at the point
Materalism kept them other kids biz'm
While I was selling my game they was sellin' izm
Words by Phil be a leader not a follwa
Don't let the masses of technolgy swallow ya
La di da di we all likes to party
I'm followin' my dreams I'm gonna be somebody


Hook


Verse 2: Shaq

Now check it, Commodores was my favorite joint
Til I heard Planet Rock on the bop, that jam's on point
I used to rhyme in the mirror, like I was down with UTFO
Doug E. Fresh singin' a show
For a big kid I had crazy rythm
Size 13 suede crews with thick shoe strings in 'em
I was the baddest popa, baddest rhyme dropper
Bustin' more mills than Superman to helicopters
I had the name buckle kids used to jock
Public Enemy came out, I had the clock
My favorite jam was by Big Daddy ain't no half steppa
My mic sounds nice check 1-2 by Salt N' Pepa
Heavy D, Rakim, Eric B, Ricky D
Scott LaRock and BDP
I never knew 'em but I used to look up to 'em
Battles in the park in the dark I ran through 'em


Hook


Verse 3: Shaq

Somebody wake me up this can't be real
Lookin' in the paper, Shaq's about to make a hundred mil
Somebody smack me, it's gotta be fake
20,000 square foot crib on the back of a lake
Five movie deal with Disney
Damn I'm getting busy like Dizzy Calepsi
20 mil check from Pepsi
Let's see, red benz and black porsche
??? room suburban with roof-top hole and of course
Boat with my name on the side so I can ride on the water
With my wife and my baby daughter
I oughta write a book so y'all can see
How easy it is to be who the hell you wanna be
This is a message from Shaq, react bring it on back
Follow your dreams and it's like that


Outro: Shaq

To all the little children, rock rock on
Rock on
Rock on[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Uh, I learnt the game, I know what I want and I'm in it
The time is now, it's gonna be up in a minute
You look a nigga in the eye, you could tell if he timid
These fake rappers gettin by with these hell of a gimmicks
They act like it's all love, only love is your money
So when it's over nigga, are you a thug or a dummy, I'm neither
But I been hot so long, it feels like I got a lifetime fever
And I ain't gotta spit, I could cough and still eat ya
And fuck rap I make mils of reefer, I'm a man first
Tired of punching niggas, so I'mma shoot niggas cuz my hands hurt
And God is great, guard ya space
One hand wash the other, both wash the face
And I head crack so much, it's hard to ace
.38 revolver flow, its hard to trace, what!

[Hook - Styles P (Jadakiss)]
Fuck that, pop off till nothing in the clip left (pop off)
Till nobody in his clique left (nobody)
Hole in the head, slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened (tell em it's the Kiss Of Death)
Hustle hard till none of them bricks left (nothin left)
Stick it up till not a crumb on the strip left (take that, take that)
Make sure ain't a chain or a chip left (uh uh)
If they asked what happened (tell em' its the Kiss Of Death)
Tell em Kiss (THE KISS OF DEATH!)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
This is LOXville
And even White America'll let y'all negros know Jada got skill
You a Jackass like Johnny Knoxville
So I can just imagine how ya pops feel (damn!)
And you ain't worth my shells
So you should just imagine how the ox feel
A lotta niggas is thousandaires
Walking round town, fronting like they got mils
For what it's worth, I'm one myself
But my strength in the hood outruns my wealth
But you still might catch Kiss in some Hot Wheels
New Bentley coupe, with the stock wheels (Haha)
Look how I get back to it, I send my young niggas to do it, in the black Buick
I don't spit bars, or distribute the crack fluid
All I'm really waiting on is for niggas to act stupid

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
To all my real niggas, sorry for keeping you waitin', (sorry)
It's ironic, but the god was beefin with satan
I love y'all tho, my niggas for even relatin', (i love y'all)
This ain't Kiss talking neither, I'm speakin for Jason, (mwah)
When you a problem it's harder to keep them from hatin
Niggas jaws is like laws though, easy to break em
If I wasn't on some shit, I'm gettin on it
Come to me with ya hand out to me, I'm spittin on it
I don't wanna hear what happened, matter of fact, I don't even care what happened
Might as well declare the clappin
Cuz my bones is old, gotta lotta wear and tear from scrappin
Hate a nigga that, ain't never there to see shit, but always hear what happened
The thing better than money, is respect
No love this time, nigga, Kiss Of Death, what!

[Hook][Intro: Sheek Louch]
Hahahaha, y'all know what this is (D-BLOCK!)
Oh yeah, by the way...
THIS IS THE REMIX (WOOOO!)

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass goodbye (d-block, d-block, d-block, d-block)
La-da-da-da-da-daaaaa

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Ay yo, the flow is here, the dough is here (yeah)
They gon' call this the hardest remix of the year (ha-ha)
The wrist is sickle, the 9 is nickled (damn)
The inside tan, the outer pickle (woooo!)
The dutch is rolled, the 'gnac is poured (iight)
You running your mouth, I'm getting you jawed (ow!)
I'm waving the blade, I'm telling you back up (back up!)
You empty your pockets, I'm picking your pack up (gimmie that)
You can act stupid if you wanna (uh-huh)
Like you don't know what block I'm in front of (I'm right here dog)
I'm out in New York or down in the south (no doubt)
I'm out in the trap with gold in my mouth (ha-ha)
They book me for the clubs and the hood (yeah)
When niggas scared to go, but Sheek Louch good (D-BLOCK!)
It's loaded when I get out the car like... (la-da-da-da-da-daaaaa)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
They say hate spread faster than love
So the Bentley is black, same color as the mask and the gloves
With me, I'm a send a bastard to bub
Before he get the police first and last to your gov
These dickhead niggas, you shoot 'em they bleed cum
The two pussies he's with, just make it a three-some
They growing up quick, cause that'll buy your seed guns
Now they spreading magazines 'fore they can read one
My glass jar's had a hell of a weed run. (la-da-da-da-da-daaaaa)
As we proceed son, and I know
Every hood got a street fam if not they need one
I thinking short-range, give me a sport range
I wanna get warmer; I'm jumping in the sauna
Duck when I'm passing by
Put your head between your legs; kiss your ass goodbye, braah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
You niggas lost y'all game; I'm throwing the Roc down
Just to put y'all D, I'm back on the block now (uhh)
Running your mouth, 'fore I shit all in it
All y'all ass, and I'm about to dig all in it (eww!)
I birthed you niggas, I fed and I burped you niggas (uh-huh)
Quick as that, I will Earth you niggas
Clothed you niggas, wiped the snot from the nose of you niggas
What not to expose you niggas
Fist, knife, or razor fight
I got a year and a day, still played it like they gave me life
Can't walk through the jail without shackles and two cops (uhh)
Throwing shit on the warden outta the food slot (uh-huh)
Got connect with pop, he boofin' the weed plants (yeah)
Get my khakis washed and pressed for a few stamps
Respect in the jail, a check in the mail
I stay on the phone, I don't put collect on the bill (mwah, ha-ha)

[Hook]

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Ay, you better know I'm going all-out, whatever the cost
So fuck whoever hating, I'm the king of the South
You gon' forever see me flossed, Spyder with the top off
Third gear I got lost to the million dollar law
J.G. the one who told the bitch to take your tops off
I'm a seven-figure nigga, paid the cost to be the boss
On the streets or behind the wall
Lift weights, get straight, 'til it's time to ball
Even if I never sell a million times at all
Dope boy trap niggas, I'll grind for y'all
Pimp Squad, D-Block I'll ride for y'all
A-Town to Y.O, see the Chevy ride slow
With the light turned down and the beat down low
40-cal's and K's out the window
You better do like Lil' Jon told you "Get Low"
Cause you can cancel Christmas, when the chopper-missle hit you
I ain't waiting for permission; I'm a flip until it hits you

[Hook][Intro: Sheek Louch]
Hahaha
Ya'll know what this is
D-Block
Oh yeah by the way
This is the remix
Whoooo!

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass good-bye
D-Block D-Block D-Block D-Block
La da da da da da

[Verse 1- Sheek Louch]
Ayo the flow is here, the dough is here
They gon' call this the hardest remix of the year
The wrist is sickled, the nine is nickled
The inside tanned, the outer pickled
The dutch is rolled, the yak is poured
You runnin' your mouth, I'm gettin' you jawed
I'm wavin' the blade, I'm tellin' you back up
You empty your pockets, I'm pickin' your pack up
You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you don't know what block I'm in front of
I'm out in New York or down in the south
I'm out in the trap with gold in my mouth
They booked me for the clubs in the hood
Where niccas scared to go but Sheek Louch good
Its loaded when I get out the car like la da da da da

[Hook: Sheek Louch]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Yeah D-Block
They say hate spread faster than love
So the Bentley is black, same color as the mask and the gloves
With me, I'mma send a bastard a bub
Before he get a police to first and last ????
These dickhead niggas, you shoot 'em they bleed cum
And two pussies they with, just makin' a threesome
They growin' up quick, you gotta buy your seed guns
Matic spray magazines before they could read one
My glass jaws had a hell of a we run
La da da da da da as we proceed son
And I know, every hood got a street flame if not they need one
I'm thinkin' short range, give me a sport range
And when it get warmer, I'm jumpin' in the stormer
Duck when I'm passin' by
Put your head between your legs, kiss your ass good-bye, braaa

[Hook: Sheek Louch]

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
You niggas lost ya'll game, I'm throwin' a rock down
Just to put ya'll D, I'm back on the block now
Runnin' your mouth, 'fore I shit all in it
All ya'll ass and I'm about to dig all in it
I birthed you niccas, I fed and I burped you niccas
Quick as that, I will urf you niccas
Clothed you niggas, wiped the snot from the nose of you niggas
Want not to expose you niggas, fist knife or razor fight
I got a year in the day, still played it like they gave me life
Can't walk through the jail without shackles and two cops
Throwin' shit on the warden outta the food slop
Got connects with pop, he boofin' the weed plants
Get my cackies washed, I'm pressed for the food stamps
Respected in the jail, a check in the mail
I stay on the phone, I don't put collect on the bill
You let them DC niggas have secks in your cell
You live with a gun, you like gettin' hit from the front
You stay on some ish like two !!s with no chick
Rumor has it you like your chicks with no !!
FYI your PSI said you snitch, how you blow trial and stay on rich
Now its time to set it off
You got somethin' on ya chest man the tec'll tear it off muaah[Hook: Eminem]
Yall better leave dat boy alone
Cause if they don't, yall know he gon' come back on 'em
And they don't want him to come back strong
I wouldn't dare get that boy going
I said leave dat boy alone
Cause yall don't know him
That there boy he out cold
And that there boy he been known
To tear some shit up when he in that zone

[Bridge 2X: Eminem]
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Cause you don't want to get that boy going

[Verse 1: Swift]
It's my attitude that's making me bust shit
I ain't to be fucked with
So basically niggas wasting they time trying to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Be turning ghost 'fore you be looking at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
With a mag and, I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation, I'll run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her gun to mouth resuscitation
A niggas information, they haunted and they sad
Got you mad cause they shitting through their stomach in a bag
We coming too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancing
Coming here is the worst mistake that could ever happen
When I'm in my vehicle, I'm pulling you in
I guarantee the world will never see you again
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
Honest to god I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain something to ya
A real street nigga ain't trying to get in the streets
He's trying to get out, feel me?
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb ho punk
At least a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
That nigga's dying over pride to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I don't play beef
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's fun that you home sick and you can't really get sleep
Cause you done laid a nigga down, but that ain't me
Well my conscience won't allow me to make decisions in vain
I'm a man, I do my business and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now people know I live trifling, I express it through writing
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fighting
And I just bought me a new gauge and added on a new knife
And I strike people so fast, niggas think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few hype men
Been harassed by two dykes who wanted lou pikner
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whiling
Cause as soon as you driving I'm a spit a few 5 ones
And I love to Kuniv' son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, from skinny to wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You looking for hoes, and up in here you going find none
You niggas done tried once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stomped till your eyes shut
No time for the why whats, I'm writing these five words
"Fuck you dick riding niggas," count it, it's five words

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Swifty McVay (that boy he hot to death)
Mr. Porter (that boy he hot to death)
THE Kuniva (that boy he hot to death)
Yep, better step before you get beat to death
Yall dont want to get dem there boys
Dem there boys be makin noise
Dem there boys got all kind of toys
You better step before you get destroyed
D12
Dem there boys they hot to death them boys[Sheek Louch]
50 you a rat, you a coward, you a snitch
You a bitch motherfucker now hear this {*tch-tch BOOM*}
All you talk about is money and sales
What you need to talk about is all them niggas that you put in them jails
We don't dry snitch niggas (nah) rappin and whisperin
Knowin that the rap police listenin
Homey know just what he doin, who career he swipe
That's aight, Ja got him, niggas say goodnight (aight)

Just mad at Game cause he ain't like them, he ain't your son (bitches)
50 this, 50 that; nigga 50 whack (50 whack)

A fucked up nigga, let me get down wit'chu
I make sure niggas don't hit you - ha ha

[Hook]
Hey yo maybe if I siiiiing, I'll be rich (should I sing?)
And maybe if I rat on you, I'll be rich (or maybe I should rat on you)
Maybe if I crossover, I'll be rich (I need to cross over I think)
I wanna beeee, I wanna be, just like that 50 bitch (how can I be like that nigga)
Maybe if I siiiiing, I'll be rich (should I sing son?)
And maybe if I rat on you, I'll be rich (who should I give up?)
Maybe if I crossover, I'll be rich (I need to cross over)
I wanna beeee, I wanna be, just like that 50 bitch

[Sheek Louch]
Hey yo Banks you got a half-assed flow
But fuckin with homey, all you gon' get is half-assed dough
And where the fuck was you at wit'cha big-ass face
When I was writin "Benjamins" with 'Kiss, Diddy and Ma$e
I ain't heard of you homey, 'til you blew up quick
But back then I'm pretty sure that you was on my dick (LOX nigga)
I dropped L.O.X., chest to chest, back to back
On Clue when, "If You Think I'm Jiggy" was whack
I wore shiny suits, niggas knew I didn't belong
But even back then I still never sang on a song
I've been white-tee'd out (yeah) white haze and hash
It's fucked up, 50 makin y'all wear that trash (yeah!)
What he do, put your clothes on the bed, put your sneakers on the floor
And tell you what hat to put on your head? (ha ha ha)
You lil' muh'fuckers to me daddy
And I don't give a fuck if the doors lift up in your Caddy

[Hook]

[Sheek Louch]
Go Young Buck (go Young Buck) that's my nigga (that's my nigga)
Even if 50 don't let you get bigger
I see you run around stage wit'cha shirt off; you need some food
You 'bout as big as "The Passion of Christ" dude
And I still got love for the dirty South
But I ain't gon' respect no nigga with my dick in his mouth
G-Unit gon' be gone once Dre bounce on you (G-G-G-G-G)
And it's fucked up cause Eminem tried to warn you
You ain't as big as these white dudes that cut your check
Think so? Wait and see who they go to next (D-Block)
You forgot about the hood scramps
Everybody ain't workin with bricks, some niggas got gramps
No new guns, just them shits that jam
Fuck it though, I'mma ride wit'chu do the death
D-Block muh'fucker 'til there's no one left
G-G-G-G-G-G... the fuck outta here!
(Yo bring in the hook son, bring in the hook)

[Hook] minus the (ad libs)

D-Block![Intro: Puff Daddy]
Shadyville Entertainment
Bad Boy collaboration

[Uncredited vocals]
I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love

[Notorious B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn
To all my Uptown
To all my Bronx
To all my Queensbridge

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick - you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues; with the boots, with trees
Smoking weed, flipping keys, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm bagging you
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make them wet in their pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out

[Hook: 50 Cent] (x2)
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel us nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fo' sho'!

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo, we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya'
Get mad do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., because fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North bound first stop, Watertown or Fishscale
Where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha-ha, yo chief, pass the buddha

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hand in hand
Even my P.O., she called me "the Ginger Bread Man"
I catch a new case, and tell her ass: "Catch me if you can"
Don't let your people fill you up with octane, I'm not playing
Get gassed up, to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it: thou shalt not fuck with, nor see Poppa
50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off proper
There's no place like home, New York! New York!
I run this city, and I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they're smacked silly
Or sprayed with the MAC milli, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics, like Milli Vanilli
In the hood they feel me {*Gun cock*} ha! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit {*Gunshot*}
Every bootlegger you know, pump my shit - bitch!

[Hook][Intro — Bill Withers]
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
Something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

[Couplet 1 — La Fouine]
J'fais mon taff et j'veux d'la monnaie, ramener ma part
Combien de fois ça m'a ramené aux portes de Bois d'Ar
Les keufs ont toujours trop mal mené, les reufs ont en marre
J'me devais pour tous ceux laissés en chien de lever la barre c'est
Oh qu'est-ce que c'est qu'ce gun?
Disaient les meufs en voyant notre dégaine
Les poches remplies de feuilles, les coeurs toujours en deuil devant nos cercueils
Oui nos cercueils devant nos vies, la jalousie se lit dans l'oeil
J'ai mis du piment dans ma vie, du whisky dans mon coca
J'ai retiré les balles de mon pompe pour poser l'attentat
J'ai balançé les mixtapes et les tcheks s'enchaînent
Et l'appui des tess se fait plaisir avant de copier handek

[Refrain — La Fouine]
Postiché devant l'lycée
Accompagné de tous les refrés
J'prends mon temps sans m'presser
J'me laisse aller
Ouais, j'suis postiché devant l'lycée
Accompagné de tous les refrés
J'prends mon temps sans m'presser
J'me laisse aller
Dédier à tous les reufs au square
Ce message de ma part
Pour tous ceux qui veillent tard le soir
Pour tous ceux au mitard

[Couplet 2 — La Fouine]
Tu sais j'revois cette p'tite fouine courant dans les rues de Trappes
Criant à qui veut l'entendre : "Oui, ma vie c'est l'rap"
Quand j'ai commençé à rapper j'ai vite arrêter d'étudier
J'ai dit : "Un jour j'serai une star donc j'ai pas besoin d'brevet"
Yeah J'revoie ce p'tit Fouin
Le bras à la fenêtre attendant un yoyo parce qu'il avait une p'tite faim
C'est ça, me remémore les bons souvenirs à la gloire de mes potes
Et chante un micro à la main, j'déchire sous les spots
Voir ces histoires de guns, cette tête d'homme à faire fuir le Mike Tyson
J'me vois danser la hiya avec une cigarette magique
J'revois la foule m'acclamer, crier et kiffer ma 'sique
Sur une vieille photo noir et blanc, des noirs et des blancs
Que du vrai man, rien à voir avec ton Benetton
Mais depuis certains potes sont dans la poudre
Ne peuvent en découdre, sur leur tête attire la foudre

[Refrain — La Fouine]

[Outro — Bill Withers]
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes{Gunshot}
[Man talking]
Yo, Red Spyda (ooh-wee) is that 50 Cent/Pac joint ready?
{Gun cocking} Let me know, holla {Gunshot}

[2Pac - from the song "Smile"]
There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future

[50 Cent talking]
Yeah nigga! Haha
Let's go nigga, this is what it is
2Pac cut his head bald
Then you wanna cut yo' head bald (You pussy nigga!)
2Pac wear a bandanna
You wan' wear a bandanna
(What do we have here now?)
2Pac put a cross on his back
You wanna put crosses on yo' back
Nigga you ain't 2Pac - This 2Pac!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained
Military mind of a thug lord, sittin' in the cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, Wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi-shotty, everybody's listenin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight

[Hook: 50 Cent + (2Pac)]
'Till Makaveli returns, it's "All Eyez On Me"
(What do we have here NOW?)
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gon' be
You should've listened, I told you not to fuck with me
(What do we have here NOW?)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gon' see
[Gun cocking, gunshot]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Now since you're crying for mercy I promise
My success'll be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold your soul
Nigga there's nothin' left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot
But you're not (now) - I see it so clear
You can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up your spine
God made men the same boy, but your heart ain't like mine
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace
I was playing with guns
While your momma had your punk-ass playing tennis
I'm a nightmare, you see me when you dream
Wake up, turn on your TV and see my ass again
You cowardly-hearted, you couldn't make it on your own
Fuck The Source, I'm on cover of Rolling Stone
Hahahaha
(You pussy!)

[Hook x2](intro havoc)
Yeah y'all know what it is
Infamous has just entered the building
Yeah, yeah mama
Keep doing that just like that I like that
But you got one problem
You hanging with some real clowns over there
They some real clown killers
Shooting off in the air like that
Aye yo son where my real thugs n' them at

(chorus) x 2
If you live nigga then you bussing your hammer
All my real niggas not having to stand up
Niggas better run or you'll be picking your man up
Clapping at whoever I ain't even in handcuffs

(Havoc)
One hammer two hammer three hammers four
H got drama with you I'm bringing it to your door
We get money on tours cuffin them broads
While we slutting them all then passing them off
Peeling off in that Bentley coupe
Got ma wetting them draws
You know I keeps them in that birthday suit
She know once that she up in that ride
And we get pulled
The hammers going in between her thighs
Need a chick got to explain a thing
She hip to it the games in her blood
And down for the grind
Till the death rep M.O.B.B
You a problem with it then you know where to reach me
I give them the business
No mirrors or smoke screens
Either you live it you live it
Or you just fronting
This rap shit for life
P thats my Co-D
We go back like staircases and O.E
Stop playing

(chorus) x 2

(Prodigy)
Nigga you thought wrong
Now look at you now
Look like sandwich meat with the ketchup sauce
But you was just hollering about
Infamous this infamous that
Your mouth was going off
Meanwhile we counts money piles
Till our fingertips green and them shits is sore
But we prefer plastic now
Its nothing like when its your tour stacking cash on the floor
Saran wrap to the top jumpoffs won't fall down
Its not my cash your bitch love
Its how I kill it on the song
And she get a taste of the dick
She open now
Its shiny like a door and I don't pay the bitch no thought
I got alot of gall
Thats what the bitch haal
While I'm leaving her sight my heart is real cold
Real hard on a ho
But much much harder for the dough
It be a bloody slaughter when we through

(chorus) x 2

(Havoc)
So don't get mad because your ho probably sucking the kid
Attracted to the lifestyle of how us gangsters live
Teach her all about life
And the bees and birds
And how I shut that shit down when the beef occurs
And how I stick, and move all you see is a blur
Yo I'm a cool ass dude until you push me sir
And can't nobody squash this beef
YOu get it on with us then you up shits creek
Queens clique

(Prodigy)
Dont have me putting these bullets all in your ass
Your era is done and your time is passed
We better and these is the simple facts
You real rusty
My niggas is built to last
And its on
We running around with our guns
Jewelery fit for pharaohs
Around our necks dun
In o four our thuns get the o six trucks
O lord
There is no saving us

(chorus) x 2[Intro: Eminem]
Rock City
Royce 5'9"
Slim Shady
Come on

[Verse 1]
Can't stop the hustle, Royce Nickel Nine
Glock stops the tussle, nine shots'll bust you
Pine box'll stuff you, fuck you, I am not the tussle
Niggas don't know me, I'm Detroit's king nigga, bow!!
Rock City's where nigga's pimp hoes and ball
Strip hoes in bars, steal clothes from malls
Arms and your city's got the...
Arms and your city's got the...
Arms and your city's got the...
Titties sagging looking like they got forearms
Gold bottles, green bottles, Cris' to the don
Niggas get popped for selling weed, shaked with seeds
If you hate me, you hate the D, please
I'm taking shit back, to the riots in the sixties
Think I'm lying? Visit me (Where you live)

[Hook: Eminem]
Rock City (Come on and rock with me)

[Verse 2]
Suburban and city niggas hustle together
Long as it's money involved, niggas'll tussle together
Long as the hustle's a hustle, the green is green
White is white, nigga we buying if the price is right
So, drop the mics, everything's on cock
From the shots to the dice, we are not into hype
You can't say we can't work
Either we some plant workers or we some niggas that plant work
What, Detroit bitches is 'bout it
You can just ask any one of your niggas that visit about it
Any Seven Mile bitch know how to get rich
She'll fuck you 'til you sleep plus lie to your bitch
Plus she'll suck and swallow up outta your dick
And she'll keep a sugar daddy that'll buy her some shit, come on

[Hook]

[Bridge: Eminem]
The city with the bars, where the goons
With the cars, to produce, here we are

[Verse 3]
New casinos, car shuffles, numbers to bet
Disrespect and get a new smile under your neck
A city full of thug-ass niggas, and punk-rockers
A lot of niggas act like Pac, so cops watch 'em
And shot blocks up in the black or the light Timbs
White boys look, act, and rap like Slim
Fight Music, knife users never respect it
Guns talk, high schools with metal detectors
A city full of Tommy Hearns thumpers
Grant Hill hoopers, Barry Sanders runners, stunners
Chaldeans with weed-connects like whoa
Type of weed, no need to test like 'dro
Type of cats who got dough, they like so
You real, then you might go where

[Hook]

[Outro]
Detroit, Rock City
Won't you come on the block with us?
Won't you just come and rock with us?
Next Level, Royce Nickle Nine, Slim Shady
Won't you come and rock with us?
Won't you come on the block with us?
Won't you come and rock with us?
Rock City, 2000, touch it[Royce Da 5'9"] + (Cha Cha)
(Stick up, stick up) Gangs 'til we play brains
We pick up (pick up) when them thangs spray
This how it goes down in the hood that you can't stay
I'll invite a nigga over then make him leave in the same day
Can you meet her?
I'm talkin bout a chick wit a Coke bottle figure but never the 2-liter
Whatever you choose, especially you
Definitely I rhyme better than who rhymes better than you!
Cause this is your sire, I spit in the fire
Thinkin that I'm fittin to retire? {"BITCH, you a liar!"}
Ah-hah! The home of the willest, I'm only the illest
I only'll steal it, phony-est niggas'll feel it, c'mon widdit
But when the battle is through
It's all-out "Jerry Springer" every arena, I'm on the panel, too
Spit shit for my peeps, shit for the Jeeps
(Stick up, stick up) Strange pick-ups, brains hittin your feet
Stained in ya mayn, listen, change in dissin
(And recognize) You MC's, nothin; you leave with nothin
(And recognize) Fuck it, hold on - I hear somebody comin
{"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, what is his name?"} 5-9!

[Hook]
Can't keep comin around me baby
Make my girls say (OHHHH!)
Can't keep running awayyyy
Give it to me now (RUN)

[Interlude: Cha Cha]
You can't leave, you can't breathe, you can't sleep
Hearts beat's goin - bu-bu-b-b-BUMP!
(It's like) Precious comin, can't turn your back from it
And your heart keeps drummin - bu-bu-b-b-BUMP!
See deep, see the world from beneath
And all you hear is that beat - bu-bu-b-b-BUMP!
(YO!) Evictions (YO!) enrichment (YO!)
Contentment - bu-bu-b-b-BUMP! (YO! YO!)

[Royce Da 5'9"] + (Cha Cha)
Yeah, then after THAT I just thu-thu-th-thump, for fun
I'm COCKIN back my (pu-pu-p-p-PUMP!)
Yeah, what nigga man, you better be du-du-d-dumb
You better stutter, you better SAY I'm th-th-th-the one
Cause I'm the, rap oxy moron, feel that?
Cause I bring tracks to life while I kill, cracks
Ladies say (Royce I wanna get with, you!)
And it's cool cause I got a whole (get with) crew
And I hit, writers, right where it hurts
Don't call me no hit, writer; I am a fighter, first
Niggas try to murk on my fire since fireworks
Now you hurt, have you goons in a drive-by verse
Cause I'm STRONG in that area thuggin
I just, LOVE leavin niggas layin there like a area RUG
Plus you, yeah, smellin my game
Ev-ery girl +Wanna Be Bad+, ask Willa Ford, tell her my name
It's, 5-9! Hah, now I see why you can't see
See why you can't breathe, why you can't beat or be ME!
Man please, you better be Sam Sneed
(And recognize) You just feet, a piece of a stampede
(And recognize) Shh, hold on - I think somebody comin
{"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who could it be?"} 5-9!

[Hook]

[Outro: Royce Da 5'9"]
A round of applause for the brand new Mrs. Montgomery
My lil' sister Cha Cha, Rush!
Of course my name is Royce 5'9"
When you think of my name
Think of a fresh new sound
A fresh new face, let's go

[Interlude][Hook x2]
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers coming in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hitting, directing and starring in it

[Verse 1]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstanding
Any man planning to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky (Leave me alone!)
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten speed
Screaming to Aunt Peg with three spokes sticking outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine, dammit I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack, you act up and I'm throwing you
Down a flight of steps then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck them, the rap struck 'em harder
Than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath, I'mma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Bad, the Bad (Uhh, when the Bad meets the Bad, yo)
The Evil (Take the Evil with the Evil)
Put 'em together (What? Nine-nine)
Two times, Slim Shady, Royce da 5'9"I'm the L-I-L to the K-I-M
And not B-I-G, R.I.P. ba-by
I, rep BK and the, N.Y.C
Don't no bitch do it like I D-I-D
And, since nine-six a chick been on TV
Like, MTV and, BET
So T-R-L and, one-oh-six
I'm in heavy R.O. when they play my shit
Momma push whips like BM Dubs
And your B.M. trip when she see me in the club
Your man, five-oh, I don't see him in the club
Cause he out in the CT with a dick in his butt
Y'all stay OT while I stay O.C
That's, out the country with the A-R-A-B's
With my girl M to the O to the E
She ride like a soldier, that's my co-D
I'm "Bella" to that death and, don't ask why
Cause the "Mafia" is P-U-S-S-Y
And I'm more nigga than them bitch-ass guys
Cause they took the stand, on the D.A.'s side

[Hook]
I'm the B-A-D-D-E-S-T
Chick in the game - what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
I keep it G-A-N-G-S-T-A
What more can I say - what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
BK's finest, straight out the S-T-U-Y
And the girl stay fly - yo what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
It's the Q-U-double-E-N B-double-E
Hoes wanna be me - what the fuck I gotta spell it out?

I'm in the Lamb' or the Ferrari when I'm M.I.A
Take the Spyder down the strip, when I'm in V-A
The game slow, gotta put a little work in D.C
I ball like I'm WNBA's M.V.P
On, ESPN or, NBC
I like it raw like my boy the late O.D.B
Stop pullin out them burners on them DVD's
You gotta body a motherfucker to, impress me
My boys keep the M-A-C in the SUV
And they air somethin out on the, A-V-E
I'm in the B-E-N-Z doin a buck-oh-three
Tearin the clutch down on the B-Q-E
Get at niggas quick if they try to move me
A.S.A.P. like, T.I.P
You get chopped and screwed, honeygirl don't play
Nigga we ridin' dirty like U.G.K

[Hook]

Make a wish when you see me like a falling star
Give a lot of y'all careers, CPR
First lady at the top of, R-A-P
I'm on my T-O-E's gettin that D-O-E
B-I-G, M-O, M-M-A
No info, for the, D.E.A
Federal agents mad cause I'm flagrant
Tapped the cell, and the phone in my basement
The IRS tryin to take my pay
And plus I'm bein spied on by the C.I.A
I locks it, I'm toxic like DDT
My flow get'cha high like PCP
I'm number one downloaded on your MP3
I bang on you niggas like an MPC
I make a nigga nut in his D&G's
Cause no one do it better than the one Q.B

[Hook]
