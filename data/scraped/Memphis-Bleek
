[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Jay-Z]
Dear summer, I know you gon' miss me
For we been together like Nike Airs and crisp tees
S dots with polo fleeces
Purple label shit with the logo secret
Gimme couple years, shit I might just sneak in
A couple words and like Peaches & Herb
We'll be reunited and it feels so hood
Have the whole world saying "How you still so good?"
Well I do this in my slumber summer
I ain't none of these half-assed newcomers, you know how I do summer
I drop heat, when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggas act up, I pick the gun up
Niggas back up; they know I'm not no fronter
I don't talk shit, I just flip it Un ya
Sorry Lance, I'm just trying to advance my quotes
I ain't making you the butt of my jokes
But let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, think we need some time away
They say if you love it, you should let it out its cage
And fuck it, if it comes back you know it's there to stay
It's tugging, at my heart, but this time apart is needed
From the public, who should've gave me the pulitz'
Instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging 'til the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird... some queer, I still want them to share
In all the success I received, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in your family
You know they lame, you feel ashamed, but you love 'em the same
It's like when niggas make subliminal records
If it ain't directed directly at me, I don't respect it
You don't really want it with Hov, for the record
I put a couple careers on hold, you could be next kid
Keep entering the danger zone
You gon' make that boy Hov put your name in a song
If you that hungry for fame, motherfucker c'mon
Say when, take ten paces and spin
But on another note, 'bout to take another vaca'
On another boat, goddamn a motherfucker wrote
His way out the hood, and I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could
Try and play like he Suge, then I gotta play like Dutch Schultz
You pass the dutchie, I blast you, trust me
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood, you lucky, I got a good groove
And I ain't trying to fuck my thing up
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Non Pulp Fiction, Colt four-fifth and
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion, no religion

[Talking]
Listen here summer baby, I just believe it's the right thing to do
I got a brand new bitch, corporate America
She showing me a lot of action right now
And I know you put me on my feet and all, but
I mean, it's time for me to grow
You gotta let me go baby, you gotta let me go

I'm done for now, so one for now
Possibly forever, we had fun together
But like all good things, we must come to an end
Please show the same love to my friends
Dear summer[Intro - Jay-Z]
Come experience life as we know it
As some of you should know it
Place: Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions: Well, y'all know the actions

[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he want to mock
He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking
To honeys hawking I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He want to run with me, I know this kid will be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle, nobody want to be like Michael
Where I'm from, just them niggas who bounced from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cold green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on

[Hook]
It's time to come up (Jay-Z)
And hold my own weight, defend my crown (Memphis Bleek)
Got to lock it down and when they rush (Jay-Z)
Stand my ground (Memphis Bleek)
It's time to come up (Jay-Z)
Stick up my chest, and make some loot (Memphis Bleek)
Got to lock it down and when they rush (Jay-Z)
Stand on my own two (Memphis Bleek)

[Verse 2 - Memphis Bleek]
I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace, life could be better
Like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's selling weight, I'm selling eight balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
I'm tired of being out here round the clock
And breaking day, and chasing crack heads up the block for my pay
I'm staying fresh, so chickens check
I'm trying to step up to the next level, pushing Vettes through the 'jects
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibrium
And stunned I'm waiting for my day to come
I got the urge to splurge, I don't want a lifetime sentence
Just give me the word

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey fella I been watching you clocking (Jay-Z)
Who me? Holding down this block it ain't nothing (Memphis Bleek)
You the man nigga, now stop fronting
Hahah I like your style (Jay-Z)
Nah, I like your style (Memphis Bleek)
Let's drive around awhile (Jay-Z)
Cool nigga (Memphis Bleek)
Here's a thou' (Jay-Z)
A G? I ride with you for free
I want the long-term riches and bitches (Memphis Bleek)
Have it all, now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same (Jay-Z)
On the low? (Memphis Bleek)
Yeah, the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly (Jay-Z)
And then you blow (Memphis Bleek)
Hey keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards (Jay-Z)
Then he through dealing I understand (Memphis Bleek)
Don't blow your dough on hotties (Jay-Z)
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break them for nobody (Memphis Bleek)
Hah, I like your resume, pick a day, you can start (Jay-Z)
From now until death do us part nigga (Memphis Bleek)

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
What's the problem shorty?

[Shorty]
Yeah whattup man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me

[Beanie Sigel]
Alright; hold on - Hova, line one

[Jay-Z]
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggas don't know a brick from a bite
They keep buying hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life"
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

[Shorty]
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'mma roll with that one

[Jay-Z]
Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holla {*click*, *dial tone*}

[Beans] 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
[Chris] Whassup Sig? This Chris out the Young Guns dog
[Beans] Whattup?
[Chris] I'm ready to smash these niggas in the rap game
The niggas takin too long with that advance money and shit
[Beans] Yeah
[Chris] Talkin 'bout chill, chill don't pay the bills
[Beans] Yeah I feel that
[Chris] I know you well connected dog
Let me holla at somebody real
[Beans] Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on
Bleek, line two

[Memphis Bleek]
Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, that's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggas who gettin it - DEAD IT
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out
{*click*, *dial tone*}

[Beans] 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your dog

[MDKHN] Yo whattup, this Murder Def Kill Homicide Nigga

Shut the fuck up! Matter of fact, hold on
{*click*, *classical type music plays*}
[MDKHN] I know this nigga ain't just put.. put me on hold man
This bullshit-ass elevator music
[Beans] Free, pick up line five

[Freeway]
First things first, watch what you say out your mouth
When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (ho!)
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)
You stoppin dough when we clutching the gas
I know you heard "Friend or Foe," this ain't different from that
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dykes and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Cause boys want three bundles two streaks and pipe for sure
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more
Nine and four, everyday back and forth
Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler
Pass the number til you're stackin balls
Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more
I take cash or write the check out to F-R
Two E's, that'll be two G's
And forget my money I'm comin for all your ki's, nigga
{*click*, *dial tone*}

{*click*, *dial tone*}[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yeah, is y'all niggas finished, yo
Is y'all niggas finished
Got your little radio play, your little BDS, huh
You finished nigga, huh huh, y'all finished
Can I live, huh
Can I live, you're being stingy with the fucking music again yo

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I blacks out, I pulls the mack out
Scream what's that about then I clap out
I get my plot on and my drop on, through the rotten
Don't even hate on those who hate me, I got Pac on
Feeling it, feeling it,chickens are ice grilling it
Cops pulling it over, Jigga react militant
Speed off, officer told me turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher, then return the devil's fire
I'm raised different, react in situations
Niggas lay stiff in and rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows, create criminal odes
Sing along if y'all with me, til the end of the road
I'm cynical, when in the view of the public
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand, is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you?

[Refrain: Jay-Z]
Can I live
For all my niggas with the all white Air Force Ones and black guns
Stack ones
Can I live
For all my chicks pigeon-toed
Stand bowlegged like the bulldog
Know what I mean
Can I live
To all the cee-lo champs
Two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll
Heads
Can I live
To all my niggas who drink Hennessy straight
Cop mixtapes and sell weight
Niggas

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I got the feds sending me letters, cause I'm schooling the youth
But they can't lock me down, cause my tool is the truth
Yeah I sold drugs for a living, that's a given, why is it?
Why don't y'all try to visit the neighborhoods, I lived in?
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central
Where cops lock you up more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth
And all I see is life cycle just repeating itself
Ran into shorty bopping down the ave
On his way to clocking mad then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]
Ayo there's money there I just gotta have
When I catch up to these fiends I'm a knock them on they ass
Not to brag
Sometimes I look at my life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not a craft
When I backed out
Let one out, let the barrel turn
Holla at you faggots
That it's my block to burn
That credit you dead it
I know heads getting annoyed and knew all
About a dope fiend before reading Donald Goines
Flipping boy, using the right cut
One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump
This slab gotta re-up and re-bag
Blend it in with the raw
Bubble it fast cop more
Once I get it I got it I lock it
Nobody pop shit
Selling twenties on my block bitch
For some blacktop shit
What you want nigga
What you want nigga
What you want
What you want nigga

[Hook: Jay-Z]
Can I live
To all my niggas that hold coke in they bubble coat
Trying to win in the construction Timbs, can I live
USA, all my chicks that strip
Boos go to the store with the doobie pins still in
All my chicks with the credit card scams, 2 kids, 1 job, and no man
All my chicks getting that washing set with their welfare check
All the mamis dame besa, alright
All my niggas rocking them fitted caps
Trying to get at this rap, know what I mean
All my cats with open cases, big cars, and no license
I like that shit, I see y'all
All my niggas that say pause, after they say some fucked up shit
Rock on, Jigga shit, Roc-A-Fella forever yo
Major Coins, yeah

[Jay Z]

I wear more bling to The Source and Soul Train's
More chains than rings, niggas won't do a thing
I bangs the four-four in plain, daylight I'm deranged
Spray right at your brain; by the way this is Hov'
One shot Dillinger, one shot killin ya
It's only one Roc La Familia
Sigel lock Philly up, Brooklyn is me
Matter of fact, the East coast fuck took it from me
Fourth album still Jay still spittin that real shit
Volume 3 still sold more records than Will Smith
Can't call this a comeback, I run rap, the fuck is y'all sayin?
Five million I done that, and I come back, to do it again (uh-huh)
Ex-sinner, Grammy award winner
Ballin' repeatedly, highlights on Sportscenter
Please repeat after me - there's only one rule
I WILL NOT, LOSE![Intro - Jay-Z]
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two

[Bleek] Cocaine whiter now
[Jay-Z] Operation is sweet
[Bleek] Whole game tighter now
[Jay-Z] Moving a brick a week
[Bleek] Plus a nigga prices down
[Jay-Z] We them niggas to see
[Bleek] Time to start the arising now
[Jay-Z] I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
It seems I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit

[Memphis Bleek]
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffin like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff"
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, "Jigga, whattup?"

[Hook - Memphis Bleek]
I done came up, put my life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's my time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him

[Memphis Bleek]
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
That had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him

[Jay-Z]
To the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down

[Memphis Bleek]
Stay focused
I'm trying to concentrate, but it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached ("Whattup Bleek?") and I paused

[Hook]

[Jay-Z]
You done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's your time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line
[Memphis Bleek]
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Verse 3 - Jay-Z]
Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga we Lex movers, V-12 pushers

[Memphis Bleek]
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, "And what?"
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennesey
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me, and my aunt saying I need 50
Not 60/40

[Jay-Z]
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby

[Memphis Bleek]
Your fun is my fun, your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you
I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew

[Jay-Z]
Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold nigga, perfect your role

[Hook]

[Outro - Jay-Z]
Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's your time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line

Coming of Age Two, brand new[Into: (Memphis Bleek)]

While I'm... sunk in that 745.. IL
Feel like a jet when I ride (when I ride)
So I ride nigga feel me on cruise control
Game tight nigga lose your ho

Ridin under the tint doin the duece fever

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
What's the problem shorty?

[Shorty]
Yeah whattup man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me

[Beanie Sigel]
Alright; hold on - Hova, line one

[Jay-Z]
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggas don't know a brick from a bite
They keep buying hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life"
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

[Shorty]
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'mma roll with that one

[Jay-Z]
Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holla {*click*, *dial tone*}

[Beans] Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on
Bleek, line two

[Memphis Bleek]
Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, that's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggas who gettin it - DEAD IT
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out

[Freeway]
First things first, watch what you say out your mouth
When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (ho!)
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)
You stoppin dough when we clutching the gas
I know you heard "Friend or Foe," this ain't different from that
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dykes and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Cause boys want three bundles two streaks and pipe for sure
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more
Nine and four, everyday back and forth
Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler
Pass the number til you're stackin balls

Ughh, ughh, yeah
This is Beanie Sigel
That Philly cat who ain't with that silly rap
Put your weight up, not your hate up, niggas
Y'all know how I play quiet towns and tie 'em down
Haters wonderin' how I got a position with Roc
Cuz I listen to The LOX and I listen then watch
While you still sittin' in spots, ditchin' the cops
I'm in the Porsche Box with Fox, glistenin' watch
War steel gray, Lexus, GS-4
Desert Eagle metal in the door, pedal to the floor
I'm routin' down South, for my aim is to score
Eight cylinder, screamin' 'Fuck the law!'

Got a tank full of gas, trunk full of cash
Hammers in the stash, scanners in the dash
Radar detectors, troopers can't find us
We bubble down ATL and hit the 'Linas
Then get clubbed with some Dirty South thugs
Go all out thugs, go in your house thugs
Talk shit, put blood in your mouth thugs
36 South stuck, stay on route thugs
You know how Mac play, quiet town, tie it down
I supply it now, by the pound
Might front you a Q if you buy a pound
If you didn't try it then, why would you try it now?
Think cause Mac rap, I wouldn't fire a round into your crown
I lay you down and retire you clown

And I clap niggas, nap niggas in the dirt
Pat-pat with the deuce deuce, it'll work
Bitch ass niggas wearin' thongs and skirts
Catch 'em early in the mornin' while they goin' to work
See you pretty motherfuckers stay stuck in the mirror
And you weak ass niggas only bust out of fear
I know y'all softer than them feathers that they stuff in a bear
I pack two barettas, never bust in the air
Twist your shit back, spit til my gat sits back
Pack four pieces like a Kit Kat. Heh, get that?
Cop Cris' by the six-pack, Range Rov?' Dot six that
Benz Coupe, drop six that
Buggy eye seven come out? Shit, took the six back
Switch the Double R, the Double R's are, gotta get that
You see how we play, pop Cris' on the E-Way
Soakin' the seat, gettin' drunk with Bleek
Or the Shark Bar, grilled salmon, poppin' Dom P
While you chicken when you chasin' your high with hot tea
Niggas flashin' back money like it's they money
Slap 500 on back of a three-twenty
I'm bringin' it to any nigga tryin' to shoot games (yeah)
With them bullshit buggy-eyed kits and CDs

[Memphis Bleek]
Check it out, yo, yo
Well, I'm a lil' nigga don't speak, I tote heat
Here to shut down your whole operation on the street
Bleek, you know niggas just had to recruit this
My flow drool out like a old nigga toothless
Who would believe they pump Bleek with Ritalin
Too hyped up, but weed calm my adrenaline
Roll day on the strip, SK in the crib
Hundred crack viles, playin' the Benj'
Nickel nine gleam, like it's Armor All'd up
My squad be armed up, gotcha niggas' arms up
Who the fuck want what? Me and Bean's trumped up
Witcha town under siege, Dillinger in the sleeve
If my gun jam, you niggas'll squeeze on me
You niggas them cats, that'll call D's on me
I'm on on my off game, need a stadium for in stores
Floss chains and I pimp whores, stay smoked out
Shirt be poked out with the snub-nosed eight
Six to jump out, you eat what you spit
Motherfucker die clean
For you actin' tough cats, but in your heart you serene
I read your body languo
You off balance and don't wanna mangle
You want a challenge, get it brought to from every angle
This shit'll slow 'em down, I bet that
Your up front dough and your six, bet that motherfucker

[Foxy Brown]
Sassy Fox some brick money, cop me a drop
You know how I run it, 600, glassy top
Rock the light gray wrist shit, flash them rocks
The red, the yellow, the green, causin' traffic stops
Bitch please, never freeze, gonna blast the Glock
Then I show a little cleave' and breeze past the cops
You talk slick but suck dick for money in y'all hand
I'm like, "Bitch, I got more money than your man"
While you get your knees scraped up, cum all on your glands
Shit, I'm in the V Twinz ballin' on you tramps

Well, fuck, I let 'em live and lick the tip of my shit
To remind 'em of some rose petals, candles, and shit
Or some hydro like the nigga grew a plant in my shit
So that's what it is, that's why them hoes mad at my shit
See my whilin' in the four-six, stylin' on they bum ass

Cause I fucked the nigga and paid y'all niggas
Shit, what the fuck[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
Ayo, this time it's for my family, we ride or die
It's in the blood til the death, now aim for the sky

You know Bleek squeeze hammers til they nail me
Fuck wha niggas tell me
Street scholar, keep firing is what they tell me
Drug chemist, thug nigga be named Memphis
Straight from da borough of dem B.K. niggas
Where we rob for the fun of it, hustle for the drug of it
Wrap money in rubber bands, just for the love of it
Straight from my ghetto, we listen to heavy metal like
Desert Eagles, street sweepers, loud metal

Still bust 'em wit them black 'matics
It's ain't the bucks, it's the rush
You trying to get my ass at it

Fuck how I act, as long as I stack, it's all mathematics
Our tracks nice, hug the block to track dice
Late night, club night, Mac attract dikes

Two guns, you know Mac pack gat twice
Gets that crack back with that ice
No joke wit the coke, I whips that right

And I'm having a child, which is more frighting
What y'all about to witness is big business kid
Big bosses, cocky, and big Benzsesses
Come through flossing them shiny rims it is

I think you understand what type of event this is
I don't think you know how focused young Memphis is
Or how Sigel's so real, when you add on Amil
This is much more than rap, it's black entrepreneur
Clothing, movie, and films, we come to conquer it all
Rocawear, eighty mill in like, eighteen months

Chyeah
Eazy, Guru
9th Wonder

[Verse 1]
Ay, yo, we can't stop won't stop never intend to
They feel the style in Taiwan, we call it "newjitsu"
Back to New York all the shit that I been through
Some niggas say they dawgs but to me they just Shitzus, I pencils

All the shit into issues
All the principles, how to keep it official
Cause you ain't want no nigga have to grip that nistol
Mouth off the pistol, turn dudes to fish food, these dudes

Want me looking all miserable
Don't want me getting paper, go to Jacob to spend a few
But I be in them interviews, talking how I sit in coupes
And how to Tech, I spin a nigga like an interlude

Fuck around, give you flats like an inner tube
Poke you up, just some of the shit I'm into
So fall back, maybe you can get a clear view
Of my life and how I steer through my rear view

[Hook x2]
They got me back on the block again, back with the Roc again
Watching for cops again, all about the profit and
They got me back in this game again, but I swear
We all gon' be all right

[Verse 2]
Ay, ay yo they said it can't be done, no one can do it
I'm straight off promo, right back to it
Back to the booth where I gotta spit fluid
It's money in them streets, I gotta go pursue it

I'm the truest, you knew it, you know that 9th produced this
As soon as Guru looped it, you know it get stupid
I'm sort of a live band, cause my sound is acoustic
They ain't biting the style, they wearing girders to boost it

But, they say I'm slipping, that ain't no new shit
Them numbers never lie, so you can't refute it
And don't confuse M with none of them bullshits
To the streets I'm tied, like my momma's toots is

I couldn't fathom the sight of me losing
Any Malcolm X Boulevard, I'm 'bout movement
I'm getting money, I don't need your two cents
The structure been built way before The Blueprint

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Yo, it's M to the E-M, headed to the top with this
Say it's niggas on the rock that don't rock with this
Damn, that's the thanks I get, when you know I'm the one
That started all this gangsta shit

Wilding out for no reason, smoking that reefer with your heater
Just me and Jeter, tag teaming, heating the beat up
Rocking the Caeser, pushing a two seater with divas
Niggas didn't believe us, now they hate when they see us

And the grip got multiple features
Everybody got a car, dog, none of 'em leased
This a gift from a god, I don't go to the preacher
I floss for years, you watch me, I'll teach you

I just dropped M.A.D.E., I admit it was a sleeper
Everybody went out, copped it, now beating the streets up
Put it in my hood, in two weeks, it heats up
Bleek done stepped up, but Jay would never leave us

[Hook x2][Intro: Young Chris]
Yeah..
Young Chris, M-eez, my nigga Free-Wheez
The boy Twista
Holla

My life on the track (Okay)
Up and comin'
State Prop Chain gang (That's right)
Get low (Get low)

It's the Roc in the building nigga
(Holla...Yeah)
It's the motherfuckin' Roc bitch, who hotter than us?
(Okay, okay)

[Young Chris]
Ayo..ever since a young buck, I been on the come up
Known to dish the raw, dish the law if they come up
And cheddar 'till the sun up..
If there's a ransom and the law get involved, then we never get it summed up
Never put ya gun up, if ya come round me
I go to war wit' niggas 'round the corner from 'round me
You could front 'round me, but I read through that
Wit' the mili' and I ain't talkin' 'bout no Segal mac
Niggas see shoot back, we can see to that
Hit yo front letters see through back, bring yo peoples back
And I used to grind out on my friend's spot
'til he's mom wanted my Tim-bots
Now my paint got me discounts
Or trans-quo all around the world, like I was signed to Pimp-dot
And if it's ten targets and I got ten shots
I'm tryin' to leave at least nine out of them ten shot..

[Memphis Bleek]
I got my mind on my money, money on mind
But some say its a gift, I don't write but I rhyme
I, complete songs with just one try
Tell 'em it's no lie, I beef all my life...dogg
I never think, it's already there
I find ways to say it, so you motherfuckers hear it
And when you hear it you feel it, you know its real so
This is how I live it, how it's pictured for real...nigga
I'm shittin' for real
Diamonds against wood, underground king for real
Big crib when I lay, yeah I'm livin' for real
Trust me the guns come off the shelf whenever shit'll get real
Automatics and extended clips, that's what I'm hittin' wit'
Dummies in the black rhinoes
Yeah, they be killin' shit
Masked up kidnap shit, that's how my niggas get
Chi-town, NYC, that's how my niggas get..

[Freeway]
Yes, just picture me rollin'
The smith and wesson'll stay goin' put a hole in yo chest
It's just, another hustle paper gettin' made and fold
Get mad, you street niggas finally made it
I swoop five, he know the ride, heavily loaded
Deliver pies like cake, they go straight through yo payment...yup!
Chump...you don't really wanna war
With the State Prop clique, if ya clique shot us, squad up
S-P game so damn tough, the 4 4 in the 5th tucked ya'll can't hang
Transporter turned rapper, get a camcorder film my life
Still acclompished, tryin' to fill they cups
The rap version of Mandela, call my bluff
We still the street dwellers, feel my pain (my pain)
I spit a verse and split a clip in the rain
A fool-proof when the full force open you up (what!)

[Twista]
Twista will rock you, you don't want the thug apostle to pop you
Hostile when I drop you, turnin' everything colossal to fossiles
I speak street gospel, all they life I spit words and paint portraits
For real niggas that hold down they fortress and serve off of porches
Hit 'em in the body wit' the powerful forces, that'll end all your doubt
Make you clean up your house, bag up an ounce, hit the dance floor and bounce
We blessed wit' the talent, fuck wit this clique, it ain't gon' be easy
Cause you fuckin' wit' Twist if you fuck wit Chris, Bleek and Free-wheezy
So speak and breath easy... Or the scutches my future in 3D
I like wars, I'm from a city full of Vice Lords, and GD's
Breeds and Souls, 2-6's, Kings, BD's and Stones
Spanish cobras and all the true soldiers, survive and I'm gone!
Watch me spit if for the killers and hustler's, flippin' all the pounds and bricks
Hate on me I'mma bust at you hoes, and I put eleven down wit' a clip
Niggas servin' fiftys and hundreds, when I see you and I'm on yo tip
Twista and this East-Coast regime, it's that chi-roc shit[Rell]

Just light up a light
Put that glow on the arm

Then she showing that thong
As we proceed
Got her rolling the weed
Hydro eyes low on our way to the p's
Ya'll know I go I be nervy than deez

Niggas who be trying to get Bleek
So you know I keep the heat

Repeat 1[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yeah, is y'all niggas finished, yo
Is y'all niggas finished
Got your little radio play, your little BDS, huh
You finished nigga, huh huh, y'all finished
Can I live, huh
Can I live, you're being stingy with the fucking music again yo

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I blacks out, I pulls the mack out
Scream what's that about then I clap out
I get my plot on and my drop on, through the rotten
Don't even hate on those who hate me, I got Pac on
Feeling it, feeling it,chickens are ice grilling it
Cops pulling it over, Jigga react militant
Speed off, officer told me turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher, then return the devil's fire
I'm raised different, react in situations
Niggas lay stiff in and rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows, create criminal odes
Sing along if y'all with me, til the end of the road
I'm cynical, when in the view of the public
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand, is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you?

[Refrain: Jay-Z]
Can I live
For all my niggas with the all white Air Force Ones and black guns
Stack ones
Can I live
For all my chicks pigeon-toed
Stand bowlegged like the bulldog
Know what I mean
Can I live
To all the cee-lo champs
Two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll
Heads
Can I live
To all my niggas who drink Hennessy straight
Cop mixtapes and sell weight
Niggas

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I got the feds sending me letters, cause I'm schooling the youth
But they can't lock me down, cause my tool is the truth
Yeah I sold drugs for a living, that's a given, why is it?
Why don't y'all try to visit the neighborhoods, I lived in?
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central
Where cops lock you up more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth
And all I see is life cycle just repeating itself
Ran into shorty bopping down the ave
On his way to clocking mad then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]
Ayo there's money there I just gotta have
When I catch up to these fiends I'm a knock them on they ass
Not to brag
Sometimes I look at my life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not a craft
When I backed out
Let one out, let the barrel turn
Holla at you faggots
That it's my block to burn
That credit you dead it
I know heads getting annoyed and knew all
About a dope fiend before reading Donald Goines
Flipping boy, using the right cut
One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump
This slab gotta re-up and re-bag
Blend it in with the raw
Bubble it fast cop more
Once I get it I got it I lock it
Nobody pop shit
Selling twenties on my block bitch
For some blacktop shit
What you want nigga
What you want nigga
What you want
What you want nigga

[Hook: Jay-Z]
Can I live
To all my niggas that hold coke in they bubble coat
Trying to win in the construction Timbs, can I live
USA, all my chicks that strip
Boos go to the store with the doobie pins still in
All my chicks with the credit card scams, 2 kids, 1 job, and no man
All my chicks getting that washing set with their welfare check
All the mamis dame besa, alright
All my niggas rocking them fitted caps
Trying to get at this rap, know what I mean
All my cats with open cases, big cars, and no license
I like that shit, I see y'all
All my niggas that say pause, after they say some fucked up shit
Rock on, Jigga shit, Roc-A-Fella forever yo
Major Coins, yeah
Memph Bleek nigga[Intro: Pain In Da Ass]
What you think you like me? You ain't like me motherfucker
You a punk, I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatchin', jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or somethin'

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see 'em, try to be 'em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder
Locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under
Phase one of the take over, the break's over
Nigga, I'm the God MC, me, Jay-hovah
Shit knockin, almost a crime, get Cochran
Bangin' to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They wanna see me pay, *motherfuckers* better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros

[Verse 2: Wais]
We celebrate this, while you sittin back screamin you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spittin sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just givin facelifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Ceasar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming
Who start *shit*? My style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you wanna see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in Hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazin in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
I'm Resident Evil, movin like ?

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]
Millionaire that flow like water, rap *niggas* runnin
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the Mac at ya, *niggas* caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't *fuck* widdit
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets Tecs honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on *niggas* like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was lookin you found us
Movin with speed, tried to play Superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Parapalegic, precise minds like the Pharoah's of Egypt
Shot through a barrel *niggas* narrowly weaved it
Keepin my Team top seeded with the Sweet 16's
Bulgin out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holdin, ? shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it...

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, *niggas* hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screwface in forty-two ways, Aim better
Than toothpaste, Jerry Maguire
"Show Me The Money" like Clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zonin
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the Omen, foamin
White sheets got ya wrapped like a Roman
Back in New York, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
*Niggas* is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seekin, grill huntin, still frontin?
Keep squeezin, *fuck it*, I leave the whole street wheezing
No *motherfuckers* hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got em scared to drop like soap in jail

[Outro: Jay-Z]

Never disrespect this thing of ours

Shit gon' shake up, squads gon' break up
Coats gon' get pulled, niggas gon' wake up
Everybody want see a chance to eat
And chance the streets, you know they gon' 'vance police
Like the time they shackled me from hands to feet
Cause I gave the jail system, a chance to speak
You know the cops wanna trap me up, the block wanna clap me up
It won't stop 'til they wrap me up (E'rything signed and sealed nigga)
Gat be tucked, heat gon' back me up
R.O.C. - Bleek come on nigga, back me up

Murder murder Marcyville
My nigga you heard we clap you we certainly will
South Philly motherfuckers kill at will
Bet the mack milly make you niggas "chilly chill"

[Jay-Z]
Check the four corners of the earth I'm a man of respect
Marcy projects motherfucker I'm demanding respect
The niggas done fucked up and they called in the cleaners
Jayo you're not a felon you're a misdemeanor
Don't let the Nina hit you and split your beam up
Fuck the punks with you we hit your team up (buck buck)
Y'all niggas hurtin'
That publicity stunt is not workin'
You made a bad situation worsen
Y'all wanna see me out this game like Rider
You fuckers better stop that ?we came from a game wider
How the fuck you gone try us?
You can't deny us
Of a dollar it's the Roc bitch holla!
Beef ain't nothing to a boss nigga
You crossed the line
The orders go out to kick in your doors
Wavin' the 4 4
All I heard was Jigga I don't want it no more

[Chorus]

[Bleek]
Yo you heard a nigga fronted on Bleek word?
Nigga, never fronted on Bleek word
If it's written I wrote it
You spit it I spoke it
So...Never forget Bleek totin'
I'm from murder murder Marcyville
If y'all look in the mirror do y'all see real?
We see through your visad
Y'all soft like Q-tip cotton
Y'all dudes ain't hardly real
The boss spit off M-po's certainly will
If I smack this kid you'll probably squeal
So open the hydro we firing still
We clear out the building like a fire drill and
Money too long for y'all to fold
You know to catch a case to me is like a common cold
So get your guns out you ain't ready for war
You know the R-O-C too strong for y'all
Motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Geda K]
Yo, I'm in a zone
You niggas done disturbed the peace
I try to relax
Still got word off the street
Hear you frail bastards tryin' to get your name back
You ain't achieve shit since you got your name in rap
We can't be misjudged you hear the flows and the lyrics and
The fifth slugs'll tear holes in your spirit and
It's like rap turned y'all to kill and hustle
Knowin' y'all gone snitch if I hop one touch you
Talk that gangsta slang be a gangsta slain
These N-Y-M-P gangstas bang
How you talk real but need your click to live?
All I need is the fifth and two clips to give
Geda keep the unsane ratchet
For y'all who swear y'all can dodge the rain put on your rain jackets
It's the game y'all ain't fit for drams with us
And we pop the big guns that tear through armored trucks

[Chorus][Intro - Jay-Z]
Come experience life as we know it
As some of you should know it
Place: Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions: Well, y'all know the actions

[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he want to mock
He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking
To honeys hawking I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He want to run with me, I know this kid will be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle, nobody want to be like Michael
Where I'm from, just them niggas who bounced from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cold green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on

[Hook]
It's time to come up (Jay-Z)
And hold my own weight, defend my crown (Memphis Bleek)
Got to lock it down and when they rush (Jay-Z)
Stand my ground (Memphis Bleek)
It's time to come up (Jay-Z)
Stick up my chest, and make some loot (Memphis Bleek)
Got to lock it down and when they rush (Jay-Z)
Stand on my own two (Memphis Bleek)

[Verse 2 - Memphis Bleek]
I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace, life could be better
Like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's selling weight, I'm selling eight balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
I'm tired of being out here round the clock
And breaking day, and chasing crack heads up the block for my pay
I'm staying fresh, so chickens check
I'm trying to step up to the next level, pushing Vettes through the 'jects
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibrium
And stunned I'm waiting for my day to come
I got the urge to splurge, I don't want a lifetime sentence
Just give me the word

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey fella I been watching you clocking (Jay-Z)
Who me? Holding down this block it ain't nothing (Memphis Bleek)
You the man nigga, now stop fronting
Hahah I like your style (Jay-Z)
Nah, I like your style (Memphis Bleek)
Let's drive around awhile (Jay-Z)
Cool nigga (Memphis Bleek)
Here's a thou' (Jay-Z)
A G? I ride with you for free
I want the long-term riches and bitches (Memphis Bleek)
Have it all, now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same (Jay-Z)
On the low? (Memphis Bleek)
Yeah, the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly (Jay-Z)
And then you blow (Memphis Bleek)
Hey keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards (Jay-Z)
Then he through dealing I understand (Memphis Bleek)
Don't blow your dough on hotties (Jay-Z)
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break them for nobody (Memphis Bleek)
Hah, I like your resume, pick a day, you can start (Jay-Z)
From now until death do us part nigga (Memphis Bleek)

[Hook 2X][Intro - Jay-Z]
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two

[Bleek] Cocaine whiter now
[Jay-Z] Operation is sweet
[Bleek] Whole game tighter now
[Jay-Z] Moving a brick a week
[Bleek] Plus a nigga prices down
[Jay-Z] We them niggas to see
[Bleek] Time to start the arising now
[Jay-Z] I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
It seems I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit

[Memphis Bleek]
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffin like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff"
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, "Jigga, whattup?"

[Hook - Memphis Bleek]
I done came up, put my life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's my time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him

[Memphis Bleek]
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
That had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him

[Jay-Z]
To the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down

[Memphis Bleek]
Stay focused
I'm trying to concentrate, but it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached ("Whattup Bleek?") and I paused

[Hook]

[Jay-Z]
You done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's your time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line
[Memphis Bleek]
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Verse 3 - Jay-Z]
Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga we Lex movers, V-12 pushers

[Memphis Bleek]
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, "And what?"
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennesey
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me, and my aunt saying I need 50
Not 60/40

[Jay-Z]
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby

[Memphis Bleek]
Your fun is my fun, your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you
I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew

[Jay-Z]
Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold nigga, perfect your role

[Hook]

[Outro - Jay-Z]
Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's your time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line

Coming of Age Two, brand new* the version on Belly has an extra verse

[Memphis]
Yeah, check it
Yo yeah I smoke weed now I don't give a fuck
And I also tote guns in case my dram pop up
It's crew love I spit two at every few thugs
Fo doves blow dubs holdin eight snub
I hold it down my strip, goin nowhere
Flip two eightballs trick the dough on low gear
The next week two O's gone
Nigga don't prolong
Play the studio and get my flow on
And sell weight on a later base
My older brother kept guns on his waist in case he air the place
And walk straight up on you fuckin crooked niggas
Comin out ya mouth sideways like some rookie niggas
I drink Henny mixed wit nothing
My weed and the dutch is somethin
What you niggas sayin nuttin
It's Bleek, controllin these streets holdin the heat
Reportin for my live niggas just like me WHAT

[Jay-Z]
Haha this is Roc-A-Fella for life
This is Roc-A-Fella for life

[Hook]
You know it's crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die
As long as you and I keep it movin like a drive-by
We could stack dough sky-high
Niggas can't touch what they can't feel real recognize real
Crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die
As long as you and I keep it movin like a drive-by
We could stack dough sky-high
Niggas can't touch what they can't feel real recognize real

[Beanie Siegel]
Yo, I set up shop wit nick rocks that'll upset rookies
Make 'em slide like li'l dicks in wet pussy
Open up the whole strip, like Monopoly
Dare one of ya'll to land on my property
Think you get some dough for my community chest?
Blaow blaow two to yo chest
Ya'll niggas can't pass go cuz it cost to pass
Ya'll niggas cheap like Baltic Ave
Type ta land on jail can't pay your bail
Wanna borrow from the bank, nigga what you think
I'm the wrong one to lie to
Shit I'm the man who supply who supply who supply YOU
And ya'll a bunch talk money
I'm tryin to get it down for that motherfuckin boardwalk money
Two-brick money new blue six money
Peru trip money flew in six money
Taj Mahal trips orange chips money
Long dick money all in yo bitch money
Flow like the flu and spit sick money
Peep hotty's Roc-A-Fella wools route
All black mask down wit they tools out
Beanie mack I'll move out
I had niggas runnin from school pickin new routes
Then I'll run and lick a shot make 'em move south
Switch up they last name get a new spouse
Scrambled up some down-payment for a new house
No matter where you go Mack gone find ya
I'm like a shadow nigga I'm right behind ya
I'll blow out ya brains and won't give ya no reminder

[Hook]

[Memphis]
Me and my road dog
Been OG's for so long
Spit raw rolled up niggas can smoke on
Shit I let 'em have it you faggots ain't know my status
Fuckin with my mathematics you make us savage
Five nine one six O, light brown
M-E-M-P-H-I-S Bleek put it down

[Jay-Z]
Its crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die
As long as you and I keep it movin, nigga

[Beanie]
Aiyyo I pray to the God MC to bless me
Wit a ill ass flow and sick ass dough
Where it don't make no sense that hundreds and cents and
Thousands of dollars ice freezes my collar
Where I need a turtle-neck to rock my check
And a pair of isotoners to rock my rings
Get the signin bonus know mack toppin them thangs
Flip twice rip that crew then I'm droppin my thang

[Jay-Z]
Nigga it's crew love[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Jay-Z]
Dear summer, I know you gon' miss me
For we been together like Nike Airs and crisp tees
S dots with polo fleeces
Purple label shit with the logo secret
Gimme couple years, shit I might just sneak in
A couple words and like Peaches & Herb
We'll be reunited and it feels so hood
Have the whole world saying "How you still so good?"
Well I do this in my slumber summer
I ain't none of these half-assed newcomers, you know how I do summer
I drop heat, when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggas act up, I pick the gun up
Niggas back up; they know I'm not no fronter
I don't talk shit, I just flip it Un ya
Sorry Lance, I'm just trying to advance my quotes
I ain't making you the butt of my jokes
But let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, think we need some time away
They say if you love it, you should let it out its cage
And fuck it, if it comes back you know it's there to stay
It's tugging, at my heart, but this time apart is needed
From the public, who should've gave me the pulitz'
Instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging 'til the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird... some queer, I still want them to share
In all the success I received, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in your family
You know they lame, you feel ashamed, but you love 'em the same
It's like when niggas make subliminal records
If it ain't directed directly at me, I don't respect it
You don't really want it with Hov, for the record
I put a couple careers on hold, you could be next kid
Keep entering the danger zone
You gon' make that boy Hov put your name in a song
If you that hungry for fame, motherfucker c'mon
Say when, take ten paces and spin
But on another note, 'bout to take another vaca'
On another boat, goddamn a motherfucker wrote
His way out the hood, and I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could
Try and play like he Suge, then I gotta play like Dutch Schultz
You pass the dutchie, I blast you, trust me
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood, you lucky, I got a good groove
And I ain't trying to fuck my thing up
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Non Pulp Fiction, Colt four-fifth and
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion, no religion

[Talking]
Listen here summer baby, I just believe it's the right thing to do
I got a brand new bitch, corporate America
She showing me a lot of action right now
And I know you put me on my feet and all, but
I mean, it's time for me to grow
You gotta let me go baby, you gotta let me go

I'm done for now, so one for now
Possibly forever, we had fun together
But like all good things, we must come to an end
Please show the same love to my friends
Dear summer[Jay-Z]
Turn that motherfucker louder
It's the Roc in this motherfucker.. bi-otch!
Oh yeah, bounce, uh uh bounce
Yeah, yeah bounce, come on
Oh come on bounce, come on

Do my ladies run this motherfucker?
(Yeah, yeah, come on)
Or do my thugs run this motherfucker?
(Yeah, yeah, come on)

[Hook: Memphis Bleek]
Do my ladies run it, fat asses and flat stomachs
Throw a hand in the air if it's the year of the woman
Or my dogs run it, let 'em know that you still gunnin
Throw a drink in the air let 'em know you still thuggin

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo I come through, few of my man's, scoop you and your friends
You, you, and you with the Timbs
In tight jeans, Chinese eyes, Indian hair
Black girl ass, let me pour you a glass of Belvi
Tell me all about your past
Let me console your soul while I palm your ass
And your man did what? He ain't give you?
He cheated with her, I can't diss duke
I tell you this though, get with this dude
I'll teach you about dough, and show you what this do
(It's a secret society, all we ask is trust)
But I don't freeze wristes, I just skeeze bitches
Break up happy homes, just sieze misses
You'll never get her back, once you get a yap
How you love that? .. How you love that?

[Jay-Z]
Do my ladies run this motherfucker?
(Yeah, yeah, come on)
Or do my thugs run this motherfucker?
(Yeah, yeah, come on)

[Hook]

[Memphis Bleek]
Ay yo back woods rollin, rap you can't hold 'em
ROC gear matchin, crusin through Manhattan
Bleek is chillin, Murda is chillin
What more can I say? We still killin em
Bags we still dealin em, four wheels, we wheelin them
Chicks like I'm feelin him - yeah ma, okay
Black jeans and Timberlands give em adrenaline rush
Ladies know the difference between them niggas and us
We the R-O-C, and we don't stop
They don't make a gun that we don't pop
Matter fact they don't make a car that we don't drop
Thought you knew they don't make jewels that we don't cop
What you knew? You actin' like the ROC ain't hot
Or the car that I cop ain't missin' a top
And even if they don't make drops that kind
I tear da roof off like I'm Busta Rhymes motherfucker

[Jay-Z]
Do my ladies run this motherfucker?
(Yeah, yeah, come on)
Or do my thugs run this motherfucker?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come on, come on

[Hook]

[Jay-Z]
Do my ladies run this motherfucker?
(Okay)
Or do my thugs run this motherfucker?
(Uh-huh, okay, uh-huh)
Come on, come on

It's the R-O-C, we don't stop
It's the R-O-C, we don't stop
It's the R-O-C, we don't stop
Uh Memp Bleek, The Understanding niggas
Get your mind right, ha-ha
