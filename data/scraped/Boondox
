[Violent J]
When I'm clownin'
I get silly
Like something lace my Philly
Been known to pop a pilly
And cop a check with billy
When I'm clownin'
My heart beat poundin'
I sweat so much I'm drownin'
Because my shows astoundin'
And Faygo grape I'm downin'
When I'm clownin'
Aabrakadabra alakazam what have ya
Quick slight of hand I stab ya
Demons crawl out and grab ya
When I'm clownin'
There's plenty laughing
Blood on the walls what happened?
A massive murder stabbin
Cause wicked shit I'm blabbin
When I'm clownin'
Shit come alive
And don't no one survive
Off the light rig I dive
And this shit ain't no jive
When I'm clownin'

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
When I'm clownin'
I'm Psycoilly
Snatch out your icy grilly
I owes the mob a milly
Bout to knock off a Chili's
When I'm clownin'
Mad hoes I'm springin
They want my dingalingin
Ooh let's fuck)
They singin I keep my hatchet swingin'
When I'm clownin'
I I I'm super sick
Bones o bobber shoot you quick
Why you cuz youz a dick
Is he dead?
Poke him use a stick
When I'm clownin'
I'm heavy high powered
Mad energy devoured
The whole milky way sour
Let my acid rain shower
When I'm clownin'
Everything's a joke
That angel's wings are broke
So hot your speakers smoke
I freak this 'til I croak

[Boondox]
Fresh off the red muds of Covington, Georgia
Running with the hatchet
Is Boondox with two wicked whoops for you
Danny Brown, show the underground
How you get down with the clown

[Danny Brown]
Take a whole eighth to the face
Anything on my mind right now been erased
And I taste that taste
Of a nice thin waist
Wanna pick that up
Put the pussy on my face
Ate a whole hand full of shrooms
Huffin' on balloons got me in a spinnin' room
All these pills I consume
Got me hollerin' at the moon
Like, what's that, kaboom
While IC fill the room
You don't really want it with me
You know it's Danny Brown with ICP
Grub her down low, bring her back for a G
But before you do that, lemme see ID
Bout to drop a deuce in my Faygo
Sippin like the west got me moving up in slow-mo
Oh no, let's go
Pass the blunt around
Them hoes gettin' pounded when I be clownin'[Verse 1: Boondox]
The trouble with the curb is the swerve they throw
The means to the end is the hurt to grow
The betrayal from another who's trust ya know
All the emotions kept hid that you don't wanna show
How many times has the sharp pain hit ya?
The knife in your back someone always out to get ya
You turn around just to see familiar faces
Then all of a sudden took the unfamiliar places
I thought I knew ya. We was tight, we was best friends
Concealed things. Sheep's clothing you was dressed in
Held out your hands, blood stains while I bled out
Defying til the end but you won't never get the red out
I always had your back, you always went behind mine
I always had a minute, you could never find time
I'd take a bullet for ya, you could put that in a quote
You'd pull the trigger, call it suicide, and sign the note

[Hook: Crucifix]
Wastin' time
Pretending that I'm never gonna trust again
Saw your lies
Cost my heart and blood in my ears
I'm Hating life, every single second I'm a true pysch
I'm Hating here...
Cause every breath that you breathe is betrayal

[Verse 2: Boondox]
I never shoulda let you get that close to me
And I never shoulda opened up those doors for free
You put the pussy on me like a pair of handcuffs
And then beat me close fisted, bare knuckles, no gloves
You knew my weakness, and my weaknesses was you
We fucked a lot, forget about the sneaky shit you do
Like goin' through my phone, emails
All the accusations
Every other day, another false set of allegations
The constant lies that I knew that you was tellin'
The constant cries, I was buying, you were sellin'
The false wording like I'd be with you forever
The day I stopped ignoring it, put two and two together
And I seen you for the demon, not the angel you portrayed
I shoulda choked you out and put you in a unmarked Grave
Just deep enough to hide your fuckin' lies and betrayal
Like the rest of all the snakes left to rot. Burn in hell

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crucifix]
Like a bullet on a dark night
What's love without a fight
She a devil and her heart so cold
And she never gonna let it go [Let it go]
She got a mind full of sick thoughts
Like I could be the man when she pissed off
Evil things to make the killer skin crawl
But it's betrayal that became the devil's dying fall
A dirty broad with the flaw, just a lustful pain
To see her suffer like the other lovers, that's a game
She cut like a blade, then the vein, with the same, with the pain
Took the blade to the fame
Just to get a motherfucker to put a stain on his name
But it can never be erased from a shame to brains
So pick you pair, pick your pill, pick your poison man
Pick your passion, pick your casket cause it's all the same
The devils daughter, she quenched like water
Got you walkin' to a bear, like a lamb to the slaughter

[Hook]

Every single breath you breath's like lies inside my head[Verse 1: Boondox]
The bottom of this bottle's gettin' closer, but I'm miles away
Too much thinking going on, but not a lot to say
I've done some praying but my soul, not can be saved
I know exactly where it's headed but I'm not afraid
Comitted evil but comittment always lost on me
Picked up emotions, lost my mind when I lost my homie
It took it's toll, cut too deep for these scars to heal
And so I locked it all away
Forgot how to feel
Thought I'd found the answer
Life it played a different tune
Death it took her from me
Snatched the way she gone too soon
And that's the shit that turn me cold. And when my light faded
I'm still alive and I'm still kickin but It also jaded
Fucked up relationships
The king is striking love to matches
Soaked in gasoline and burned away on every mattress
And yes I know that burns you up
I know I did you wrong..
That's why the only thing to do is leave on living on

[Hook: Demi Demaree]
And If you see her
Tell her I've been gone
Ain't nothin left to talk about
Tell her I've moved on
And tell her I've been thinkin
Thinking all night long
And if she ever comes around
Tell her I've been gone
And tell her I've moved on

[Verse 2: Boondox]
My hands are dirty with some things that I can't wipe away
Just like some words that are said and I forgot to say
They say that time can heal, but time is all that's left to kill
I might end up alone but that's the hand they had to deal
The easy path, that never been the one for me to take
I think sometimes I'm only happy with the shit I break
I know I'm hard to love
My demons keep me in the black
Sometimes I wish that I could change, but ain't no turning back
That's why I roll with heed of revengeance. Serve the bittersweet
A jealous rage that might be waitin' for me in the street
To put a end to all the pain I seem to leave behind
That might be why I make it easy, I ain't hard to find
I wish that I could I'm say sorry for this trail of tears
Apologize for wasted time and all the wasted years
But that's the way I live my life
I put it in a song
Yet we was just another verse and now I'm living on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jelly roll]
Wish I had the time a day, been grindin tryin to find a way
Been grindin tryin to start a movement
Modern day Violent J
Whiskey makes me tipsy for a  minute I forget the pain
All of a sudden people know my name, I swear this shit's insane
From penitentiary blues to sold out shows
Ain't seen my daughter in some months, man I've been out on the road
Man I've been running from reality through all the songs I say
And somehow I fucked off relationships along the way
Let me pop another pill but I'm still feelin the same
Wouldn't know I was alive if I didn't feel any pain
I was engaged to a woman
She got up and moved away
Said I was a lunatic that can't communicate
So I wish that I could find her so that we could have a talk
And then burn the bitches house down and just wait for the cops
Riddled they called the bullets the moment that I see em
Then maybe they'll kill me and my life will be complete

[Hook][Hook: Ian]
I don't wanna spit that stupid shit like you
I'd rather kill you all than do the things you do
So if you didn't notice, then you better know this
All I really know is, that is my psychosis
La Da Da Da

[Verse 1: Damien]
The leather face of Wisconsin, I bury corpses often
Or fuck em till they harden, and then chop em right up
Yup I'm nuts, I'll leave their guts, these sluts are not safe
Razorblade cuts they face through my actions of hate
YES I'mma rape em, YES I'mma take em
Down to my cellar where I start to mutilate em
Bake em in my oven, man I love the smell of burning flesh
Just as much as I love the look in they eyes when they take their last breath
Death is beautiful, murder is an art
Cut a hole in they chest, exposing their heart
Body parts scattered, all over my house in piles
I'll take the razor blade, and give em a permanent smile
And slice they face open wide like mine
Then I drag the blade down their spine
As it pierces they back, my mind starts to snap
I can't help but laugh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ian]
Yo, this town is so hopeless, you're under hypnosis
I'm back from the dead bitch, with a swarm of locusts
So focus, don't you act like my style isnt potent
Oh shit, puffin on a doobie when I wrote this
Notice, I can pop the scene like I was Moises
So if you're [?] from livin' dump your body off in the ocean
So if you wanna fuck with me, then I'll be posted
Where's my fuckin money bitch boy? That's my slogan
I'll drop you like I was Hocus, slice through you like a Shogun
No biscuit for you hoes and catch you when you be dozin
Half you players be posin
Hoping we didn't notice, maybe it's my psychosis
Or is that bitch the grossest
Ho that you've ever seen
Why is she on your team
Fuck the whole horrorcore scene
Skanky ass drama queen
There's nothin left of me, but a simple melody
Really need some therapy
Wish I could fall asleep

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boondox]
You are now about to witness sickness on another level
Sixes caught the century, blood and piss this is mixed by the Devil
Holy water suffering, this nightmare creeps into my dreams
Screams from burning corpses is the only that darkness brings
Klopopins I got em, surprised, I don't, I got em
Anti psychotics in my veins, I think my brain is rottin
I hear the voices sayin, they like the choice I'm makin
Flush your prescriptions down the toilet, you don't need to take em
You ain't the one that's crazy, they've all just lost their way
Pick up the nearest sharpest object, make em all afraid
Nobody listen, pays attention, fuck it, kill em all
Chemical imbalances, welcome to the murder ball
A padded cell in hell is where I spend eternity
Unless I purge the whole world, than it's uncertainty
No more time to think, it's time to get it done
But I gotta see my shrink, it's almost ten to one[Intro]
I don't give a fuck who you are
It don't fuckin' matter to me, it don't matter to me
If that's how the fuck you gonna be
That's how you gonna be I guess
Ain't shit I can do about that, you can take all that shit
Shove it up that ass of yours, And this shit don't matter no more

[Verse 1: Monoxide Child]
I'm addicted to murder and weird sex
I was just a little shit but the older that I would get
I would notice that the only people I was killing was chicks
When every bitch that I was with
Would end up dead and in the sense
No innocence is the reason for their demise, so many lies
From more others and now I'm taking their lives
Until I'm caught I keep on going while I'm alive
And I'll strive to be the greatest serial killer of all time
Maybe I'll hide inside the back seat of your car
And when you're far enough away
I'll put a crowbar through your heart
Just a start in front of my random thinking from meditating
So every thing's exactly how I mean it
Mistake three when killing for safety
The feeling you've been warned
There's a killer in your building who may be
Knocking at your door so speak
If you're a bitch you better call the police

[Hook x2]
Sex, drugs, money and murder
Should be the last one that you ever heard of
Should be the last one making me nervous
I love sex, drugs, money and murder

[Verse 2: Violent J]
This dirty ass needle sticking out of my neck
As I stumble into 7-11 a bloody wreck
People screaming
But in my head I'm only dreaming
No longer plotting and scheming
I come to feed the demon
I jump over the counter knocking shit down around me
Hit the floor punching his skull
And get the pound key and try it open
I grab the whole drawer ran out the door
And stole a Ford Explorer
About to score some more
Wish I was dead but I rather be alive high
I get so jealous when I see a hearse drive by
I should be riding in it
Piss I'm lying in it
I'm only out for a minute
So I rather try and get it
To exist is more painful than shameful
I lust for chemicals to inject my brain full
Eternal fires they're burning every one of my veins
And only that ice will cool the flames

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Boondox]
I don't know if it's the smell of the gun smoke
The sound of a throat choke or fuckin with dead folk
They get me all excited like a virgin popping cherries
Don't think about the reason cause it's very fucking scary
That I'm feeling no remorse for your corpse no tear drops
Hang around the scene because Dox don't fear cops
Fuck a pig I did the crime now this is my time
And when they move the body then I snortin' up the chalk line
Death kill blood spills burned into my black heart
Tearing you apart, homicide is an art
Like a painting on a wall and you've had your last supper
Let me introduce the matches to the sickest motherfucker
To ever grab a shank and leave it sticking in your gallbladder
Claw and the hammer make the fucking skull shatter
See your brains see your pain then I'm pissing in the wound
And the love of the murder got me barking at a blue moon

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
Sittin' in my cell, this brick and bar hell
Dreamin' of the days of murder and locked in cartel
Drive bys, date rapes and weight like bar bells
I slit my girls throat dumped in McCart's well
Oh well, it's what i thought at the time
Cause in my own mind, it didn't like a crime
It seemed to be fine, all it was, was good times
Shoot a bitch, snort a line at the drop of a dime
Matter of fact the local mob was my first job
It's kinda easy when you killin' to rob
At least I wasn't sittin' home being a slob
I got up off my ass started climbin' to the top
They callin' me a demon and I'm asking how can I be
I know I got a heart, just lack of humanity
But now my sanity is something I ain't seen in a while
Sittin' on death row, this is my green mile

[Hook]
Locked up ain't where I wanna be
Confined in my mind is like a prison to me
Since birth had nothin' to choose
I'm on the run with a gun with nothin' to lose
[2x]

[Verse 2]
Childhood is the blame, poverty stricken
Acid defacs in the mix and watch the plot thicken
I was sick of being poor, sick of just living
Sick of depression and that trailor park prison
That mama had me struckin' and where was my dad
I think that he forgot about the son that he had
So the chances of survival were none to slim
And mama keeps saying I remind her of him
So if I'm just like my dad then I'm going to be broke
Pulled a kick door, stabed my neighbour in the throat
I set off on my journey to see what I could find
I watched scarface and knew the world was mine
As far back as I recall I was fearless
But now my death is near and it's clear that I fear this
I know that satan is waitin'
And I ain't found heaven
So I put my salvation in this chrome Mac 11

[Hook]
[2x]

[Verse 3]
It's about that time, I hear 'em comin down the line
My cell door slides and I'm hopin' that it will bind
I gotta make my move, it's the needle of death
About to shoot me in my veins till I take my last breath
Cold sweat breads bubble up, I can't stop shakin'
I gotta do something, keep thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'
I'm gonna die either way, nothing to lose
I look him dead in the eye then I make my move
I kicked the guard in the sternum, not a second to wait
The strenght from my adrenaline caved his chest plate
I hit the next guard in the face with my shackles
Paint the walls dark red with blood and bone spackle
Knocked the next off the C block balcony
I snatched a tazer gun, home free I'm about to be
Made a run for the door, I didin't look back
I got shot in the back of my head and...

(What the fuck!? Did you get him?
Back up! Check his pulse!
Is he dead?
Brandy, get over here, we need some help!
What happened?
Just move!
C'mon, alright, backup!
Shit! Son of a bitch!
He just... He just jumped up!)

[Hook]
[2x][Verse 1]
I'm the first born child of a seventh born heathen
Had hell on my mind since I first started breathin'
I'm a sick mothafucker with a capital S
They need to call a mary mary because my life's a mess
I'm from the bottom of the barrel
Valley livin white trash in a 100 yard dash
I'm last place third class
I ain't never been shit and my outlook is grim
And my chances of survival are none to slim
I stay straight fucked up off whiskey and water
Fuckin farmers daughter in the back of Toyotas
Poppin so many pills that I piss codeine
My system ain't been clean since the age of 14
Hood rats fat back whiskey lovin' fat cats
Snortin' lines off of titties
Bustin' on they back tat trailer park
Livin' straight screen door junky
The mainstream hate me but the underground love me

[Hook]
Comin from nothin we livin the good life
Stay high just to make it but we goin be alright
Don't worry bout me cause bitch I'm free
And I'm gone
Keep shit wicked keep killin some bitches
Gon' get it how I get it this country fuckin livin

[Verse 2]
Country life try to fuck a skinny dike
Rush to the corner store drunk on a mini bike
That's how I do it never sober when I stay strapped
Shawty on my back and a rugile on my lap
You won't never wanna bring it to a killa from a dirt road
In a full of buckshot, throw off in a dirt hole
Kidnap your girlfriend and bring her to my pokin'
Before the night is over she'll be 'bout a heavy stroking
Just a couple pounds of xanies
Bring the bitches out they painties
I think that's how my pappy first got up wit my granny
Back wood mothafuckers don't give a fuck
Huntin' haters spotlight I'm in a pickup truck
Moonshine steady flowin' and my buzz keep grownin
Keep them rats out hoein while crows keep croakin'
Sit back on my porch and in joy what I'm givin'
Might seem fucked up but this is how I'm livin

[Hook]

[Bridge x9]
Country livin' keepin wicked
When you killin' all these sons of bitches
Never givin' in and they never
Get it because we keep it wicked

[Hook][Verse 1]
So dark outside can't see a thing
Through the cracks of this window pane
Shadows seem like they come alive
Every noise fucking with my brain
I'm paranoid thinking about last night
Can't shake it off, burned in my sight
Unexplained is understatement, what I saw it wasn't right
Knock at the door, kept it off
Wait to answer, tha air got thick
Lights started flicking on and off
My heart felt heavy and my soul grew sick
Two little kids just standing there
Dressed like folks from way back when
Didn't looked up, just started askin'
"Sir we're lost, can we come in?"
Thought about it, then my mind went blank
Felt like I've been hypnotized
That’s around the time my stomach sank
One looked up and I seen her eyes
I seen her eyes and time stood still
Something like a scene from silent hill
No life, just a empty shell
Eyes blacker than a deepest pit of hell

[Hook x2]
We are the children who lost our way
Come to visit from our grave
Ring around the Rosie spin
If we come knockin', let us in

[Verse 2]
Just standin' there a cold blaze there
Pale white skin, little coat, black hair
Ain't wanna trip but the shit was rare
Ain't gonna lie, I was fucking scared
Tried to speak, but my words felt short
An evil like I never felt before
I slammed the door took a minute to breathe
Hopin' I was seeing shit, hopin' they leave
Then another knock, louder than the last
Reality check, kicked in the ass
The door flew up and they both looked up
Then scream so loud that they're shattered glass
Over and over just "let us in"
Face never changed, no frown or grim
Had to fight, I could not be in
Was this hell? Pinnace for sin
One kept askin' the other kept screamin'
Then I heard laugh it sound like a demon
Closed my eyes, and one last breath
Please wake me if this is a dream
As quick as it all went down
Everything went quiet, didn't hear a sound
I open my eyes, all strucked
They were gone, faded, vanish... fuck

[Hook x2][Intro]
As a young man I found out that if you hurt somebody
They’ll leave you alone, good guys do finish last

Am I crazy? Am I insane?

[Verse 1: Big Hoodoo]
Hoodoo is my religion I believe in superstition
Come against me and I turn instantly to mortician
You need some more coninving? Killer like the son of sam
Gruesome with my old depiction twist you like I'm outer realm
Homicidle idle survival of the wickedest
Got my rival suicidal from how I kick this shit
Watch me flick the bic I'm about to light the gas
Then I'mma cut your hand off and use that bitch to wipe my ass
I'm vicious, my heart has no malice
Very malicious and my trigger finger is so careless
From killin' bastards now all I do is swing the hatchet
All hail to prime minister definition of sinister
Detrimental to industry, breaking bad with my chemistry
Trying go out and info me, fuck with me, feel my energy
Wicked poetic symphony this is how killers meant to be
Boondox and Big Hoodoo no remorse and no symphaty

[Hook: Boondox]
No sympathy, no remorse, cold blooded
Sick with it, this how we do
No soul, my hearts cold (everybody knows we)
Sick with it, this how we do
Am I crazy? Sick with it, this how we do
Am I insane? Sick with it, this how we do

[Verse 2: Boondox]
The pain is constant and sharp
And this confession? It means nothing

The ring around sinking, coming clean like it used to
Permament reminder that I got couple screws loose
Same with the bathub, same stained hands
Drops on the counter top of insane man
Thoughts of the flashback, remembering the first time
That I realized I was evil of the worst kind
Covered toe to head in somebody else's life
And laughing when I lost it, lickin plasma from a knife
Staring at the wind, chippin' down from a slow drip
Lips on the water fountain, startin' with a slow sip
And end it with the crazy mixed pleasure with your shame
A little bit of pain from the liquid that I drain
Why did I do it? Was it worth the affliction
And why did I let to it to become my addiction
The body in my conscious bearing out in the mud
A blood thristy killer with a real thrist for blood

[Hook]

There is no me, only an entity
Something illusory

[Hook x2][Intro]
I don't know what to do anymore
After I quit with medicine I became psycotic
I suffer from depression
Complete depression
Had it my whole life
I have had it so bad that uh...
I had anxiety
Been diagnosed with major depression
Lots of phobias, lots of fears
Anxiety, panic attacks
Manic depression before, I didn't think that
Depression could be so bad

[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everything around me closing in, it's starts to grow colder
It's like I'm sitting on death row and waitin' for conclusion
Shits real fucked up, my brains filled with much confusion
Do you know what it is to sit a 3am
With a gun pressed to your temple on your knees prayin'
Or in the bathroom, on the floor, a handfull of pills
Cause the fuckin' rent's due and you can't pay bills
Have you ever felt the cold grip of death in your heart
I'm talkin' rips right in your cavity and pulls it apart
Ten motherfuckin' seconds just from ending this shit
Flames rising from the ashes that your about to commit
Have you ever stopped your car somewhere far from everythin'
Sat a half an hour, just thinkin' of a better way
To put your soul to rest and set your mind at ease
Put the barrel in my mouth, I wanna sleep for all eternity

[Hook]
Dear cold cruel world why am I here?
I never asked to be alive
Everyday it's just a struggle even to survive
Dear please juse wipe away the tears
I'll be better off when I'm gone
In my own private Hell and left all alone

[Verse 2]
Somany reasons just to leave this fuckin' planet
Pressure gets to me so much, god damn, I just can't stand it
People hatin', credit problems, bitch be fuckin' my friends
A million reasons, circumstances for your soul to transend
Nobody like me, I'm a loser, parents wish I was dead
I'm overweight, can't get a date, I'll turn my walls to red
Unlock the door, turn up the music, flip the T.V. screen
I'll leave a bloody fuckin' mess off for my moms to clean
It's's to the point that I can't stand it, I can't even try to cope
And you don't know me, you can't help me, you can't offer me no hope
It's too late to try and stop it, I have lost the fuckin' war
I ain't gonna write no fuckin' letter, leave my answers on the floor
I'm a do it I swear, don't even think I'm lyin'
Nobody gone remember me, nobody gone be cryin'
All alone in my death like I was in life
Let me take my final breath, they can bury me tonight

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You won't miss me when I'm gone
(Flames risin', flames risin')
I know you did me so wrong
(Flames risin')

[Hook/Outro:]
Dear cold cruel world why am I here?
Flames risin', flames risin'
Dear please juse wipe away the tears
Flames risin', flames risin'
Dear cold cruel world why am I here?
(just wipe away, just wipe away)
Flames risin', flames risin'
Dear please juse wipe away the tears
(just wipe away, just wipe away)
Flames risin', flames risin'
Dear cold cruel world why am I here?
Flames risin', flames risin'
Dear please juse wipe away the tears
Flames risin', flames risin'(Country life)

[Verse 1]
Front post livin' swiggin' whiskey and mescaline
Swingin' fly swatters catchin' trails from that ketamine
We on some other level country like a motherfucker
Ask the way I'm living shit they ain't no other mutherfucker
Give me mosquitoes and a moonlit night
Give me a red dirt road and I'll be doin' alright
Sittin' down by the river, bottle of Grits Mill
Double fistin' Evan Williams steady climbin heaven's hill
This is what it's all about I couldn't ask for nothing better
Me myself high fucked up and light as a feather
I hear them krickets cherpin'
I think I'll lay back and listen
I got a line off in the water but ain't think about fishin'

[Hook]
This that country life
This is the life for me
Liquor, cars and tittie bars
This is the life for me
Country till I die
This is the life for me
Liquor, cars and tittie bars
This is the life for me

[Verse 2]
I like them bitches talk dirty south slang
I like the bitches, they be walkin' shake that dirty south thang
That be the hoes up on that cornbread chicken and collard greens
Ham hockin bitches, sweet potatoes and red beans
Where did you get an ass like that pissed off in that baby fat
Suckin' on a dr pepper showen off your boody crack
They call I'm thinking slow like "how ya been?"
Always actin' kind of nasty with somethin' to prove yeah
Ya know them ones from Kentucky and Alabama
Swomp livin' Cajun bitches straight out Louisiana
The Carolina, Georgia, Florida even Mississippi
Country girls with fatter asses
Askin' them can I see them tities

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rusty cars up in the yard, bitches booze and tittie bars
That's the way we livin', drink our liquor straight up out the jar
Rollin' wood, we blowin' smoke poppin' pills until we choke
180 proof to wash it down and that's all she wrote
And if it kills me, bury me in red clay
And let it all be catered by the Ol' Country Buffet
Pass the whiskey bottle and drink it like your full grown
And let them bitches dance fuckin' naked on my tombstone

[Hook]
[x2][Verse 1: Boondox]
Give up my soul to hell, and tell heaven I did my best
One love for family, the juggalos and fuck the rest
I'm tired of all these snakes and demon leeches on the vein
I've bled enough and now these bitches 'bout to feel my pain
You know you name the haters bitter with a point of view
Pussy motherfuckers talking shit but never had a clue
Come with your attitude, cocksucker fuck your life
I tie you to a chair and make you watch me fuck your wife
I'm just the type to catch you slippin' like a bar of soap
I catch you while you're sleeping fast and then I slit your throat
I watch you bleed and gargle, choking for your last breath
Then close the wound apply some pressure to delay your death
See what it means? Your whole existance don't mean shit to me
It ain't nothing but time to kill to make you history
And all you had to do was keep your fucking trap closed
But now your got your hands folded, clutched onto a single rose

[Hook x2: Boondox]
Just close your eyes
Say your last good byes
Get down on your knees
Dry them eyes bitch and make your peace

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Jamie not a hater, if I was it ain't no killing me
I live forever, never die, surviving off the infamy
Miss me with that everybody wants me dead same ol'
And switch my hatchet to a target hanging off my cable
If you criticize my fashion, you a faggot like Tim Gunn
I'm a juggalo scrub, established since day one
So kill the hater, replicator, dissing with a foul tongue
Take my magic marker and blacken his fucking left lung
With my box-cutter I'm'a cut his eyes wide
And put broken pieces of mirror replacing both his eyes
Got a demon inside, that's been along for the ride
Since the release of my first LP back in '95
Ever since that day, I've been embracing the hate
And basically not giving a fuck, what none of y'all say
So fuck y'all bitches, black flowers up on your casket
You get what you deserve, burn in hell hating bastard

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Boondox]
I see the shit ya pulling, looking like a trailer hitch
Come to your hood with goonds and snatch you out your trailer bitch
Put on your knees, and close your eyes wait for the execution
Some call this first degree, but I call it my retribution
You had your chance to keept he sun and now you're in the rain
I be the scarecrow, but you the one who's missing brains
I put the barrel to the bone and now you're skull fucked
Two times eleven to your dome and now you're out of luck
So many times I spit just dwelling thinking of the day
Up to the point I sit for hours thinking of a way
To make you suffer, make your blood spill like a wine
Six feet up underneath the ground, have you smelling pine
It's how we do a punk bitch with a frosted mouth
Lost in the woods till you discovered by a boy scout
Stupid little mother fucker, what was you thinking
Now your body in the bushes like this rotting and stinking

[Hook x2]

I take your life, out here tonight you wanna try, die!
I take your life, out here tonight, you wanna try, die!
[x4]

[Hook x2]

I take your life, out here tonight, you wanna try, die!
I take your life, out here tonight, you wanna try, die![Intro: DJ Clay]
Juggalos... come out and play

[Hook: All]
We kept hustlin
We kept grindin
X4

[Verse 1: Violent J] (1991)
The overwhelming workload that it takes
The shakin' off snakes
The pains and the aches
Wrong moves and mistakes
They disrupt, they corrupt and distract you from your mission
And all those who let go and spend their lives wishin and missin
I couldn't listen in school, I felt I had a different callin
But all everybody did was roll their eyes and start yawnin
But this is real life and only you is livin through your eyes
There are dreamers, those who want it
And us, who won't be denied
Its a struggle every day, success is far from fuckin free
Unless you plucked it from a tree, with J and ICP
Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J (Shaggy: "Refuse to Lose!")
Livin' proof do what you got and you can do what you choose

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope] (1991)
Hate to sit back on this track like a little bitch and remininsce
But instead I'll kick a little history all about the hatchet
By this time in the game, most motherfuckers, they done fell apart
In these years we still shinin and we now just gettin our start
Inner City Posse jumped on the scene and we was mad crewed up
In the end when shit got rough and tough, it was just the two of us
When you was in the club gettin ya grind and ya sip on
We was in the parkin lot, hittin up cars, gettin our flyers on
Did my first show when I was sixteen
It's still part of my scheme
J holdin out a drive-thru window at Burger King to support our dreams
It seemed like yesterday, the world wasn't ready for two clown freaks
But we kept grindin
Now who on whose dick, lil Bitch shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide Child] (1997)
I woke up in the morning with my head on backwords
Went from street livin to an underground master
Went from sellin baggies in alleys
To sellin bangers from here to Cali
And rollin with the Psychopathic family
I started up with Krazees, hooked up with Violent J
The rest is still bein written like a biography
Don't think you know my story, cause there's too much to tell
Just know that I've been underground and I've been doin well
Since the days of makin tapes in the basement
We came a long way, I'd like to see you do the same shit
Monoxide, and I'm Twiztid with a Z
Carnival representin' til I D-I-E

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox] (1997)
We met ICP way back, touring once or twice
They was real cool, Felt like we known 'em all our life
They said You ever wanna sign with them
We was like hell yeah we down the ground with friends
They put us up, this was way before the family era
When we toured for three years with a t-shirt
Gettin mixed response from the bleachers and show-goers
Prepared for rock-throwers and flame-throwers we stayed focused
In '98 we dropped our first LP
Psychopathic presentin' Twiztid Mostasteless, the CD
Go out and get it bitch, shit is cold as ice
So dope that we released it twice
And we still here

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Blaze Ya Dead Homie] (1999)
It started as a guest spot, Parlayed to a real spot
Worked behind the scenes before I really got a shot
In the studio, quick still needin to prove somethin
My skills got me the deal off the CD you know it's dope
But it was on now in '99, the first GOTJ
Ya Dead Homie Blaze and ABK rippin the stage
The first time I ever got to grind in the sunshine
Six minutes shorter the EP's full play time
Still confusin some, give love for One Less G
That's when we moved to the streets and people started hearin me
From Colton Grundy to Clockwork Grey my skills increased
Don't believe me? Pick up my next CD
Let's hear some dead scream

[Verse 6: Anybody Killa] (2001)
I keep it grindin like an old set of car brakes
Started off with a duel player and casette tapes
By '95 my life was frustrated so I developed my mentals and let the funk recreate it
And then I hit the stage with my homie Blaze, thuggin for life
City to city tours under the light
Straight outta Detroit grindin Warrior baby
I ain't never gonna stop, my heat's never on safety
This is Psychopathic bitch boy and we so sweet
What you know about the label runnin under the streets?
This be Anybody Killa homie, like me or not
Over a hundred thousand sold bitch with one bout to drop
For real

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Bonez Dubb] (2006)
Mothafuckas don't trip I'm one of the youngest homies on the (Otis: "block")
And keepin it grindin with a (Otis: "dot")
And on my way to the fuckin ( Otis: 'top")
Because we underneath the surface
Be prepared to get real hurt bitch
We came from the gutter and now
I'm fuckin your mother and workin it
I know I'm only 24 up in this ho but check it yo
I was smokin before some of y'all was even startin to grow
Some of y'all don't even know
So many shows by eighteen
And by my twenty-first I was on the national scene, see
Been given an oppurtunity to speak my words and yo
Be keepin it wicked and run with the hatchet
For sho so smoke your roll
My name is Bonez and this be O-T
We murderin fucks til the sun comes up
That's why they call us A.M.B

[Verse 8: Otis] (2006)
Hey homie I hope you listen to my rappin
Cause rappin is all I have it's all that every fuckin mattered
Your heart can get shattered your pockets can get fatter
Just grind like me and mine and you'll shine like my family
In the beginning my mission was to make it to the hatchet
Then I did it and started laughin I grinded and look what happened
My mind is not on this planet, cause y'all thought that we vanished
But God's Hand got my back
And the game still gets me fuckin mad
I start poppin off at the mouth when somethin bothers me
You mothafuckers better give it up for R.O.C
You mothafuckers better give it up for A.M.B
DJ Clay mixtapes, gettin paid and makin haters bleed

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Boondox] (2006)
All the blood and the tears I spent on most of the years
And all the time on the grind I conquered most of my fears
The knowin I would make it and was it worth the sacrifice
Skippin meals and skippin bills I hoped that it was worth the price
Of the love of my kids and would they hate me in the end
For all the time I didn't spend I knew I'd have to make amends
So kept the mike in one hand the other gripped on my Glock
Kept one eye on the prize the other fixed up on the clock
It was a hustle in my heart that let me know I wouldn't fail
Would I end up on the stage or would I end up in a cell
Then one Monday afternoon I got that call from Psychopathic
Put the pistol in the drawer and now I'm runnin with the hatchet
(All: "Woop Woop!")

[Hook]

[Verse 10: DJ Clay] (2007)
I was sixteen young and was never put on
But was put down strong when Rude Boy gave me a call
Sayin that the wicked clowns had a party called Big Ballas
And if I want to come spin and make a couple dollars
St. Andrew's Hall (Yeah!) Remember it all (Yeah!)
When I went into this game who knew I would last this long
Then when '06 came around you can Fuck the Fuck Off
It was me and Shaggy 2 Dope I was on my first tour
And little did I know it was the first of many more
Now I'm pushin out mixtapes for the Juggalos
And the love I get from them keeps me higher than some dro
That's why I'm standin here, arms crossed
Just to let you know how we

[Hook][Verse 1]
Looking out across the crowd, see painted faces all around me
Moving to that shit I'm saying, bouncin to that bass that's pounding
Y'all know my lyrics, spit that shit just like a fuckin wrote it
Never can deny a Juggalo’s the one that's most devoted
I see y'all on the streets and repping for the common scrub
Hatchetman on window tinted, repping for that family love
Up in the mall wit my kids and y'all don't know it’s Dox
Till you see the chain, a tat, a shirt and stop to show the prop
Walk into the Conoco, grab some shit before the show
Parking lot of "Hatchet Rise" I see that line of Juggalo
It's world renown, the Faygo flies and screams of Family
I love y'all muthafuckas, y'all the one's that set my soul free!

[Hook]
You can't hate us cause
We don't give a fuck!
Bump that wicked sound!
Rock a fuckin hatchet and we represent the underground!
[2x]

[Verse 2]
I see some shit don't change, haters born seem every minute
They see the paint, the clothes and loathes and they don't fuckin get it
I see the news and read reviews and start to load the Glock
Snitches talking shit, they got me loading quarter synthesizers
I know the way it is and knowing that I freaking feel ya
Born to murder masses, kill they asses fuckin way familiar
But they won't break us fuck the world just like the clowns said
Rep the hatchet, psychopathic till my body's found dead
We got the shows and music shit that they can't take away
We run the underground so fuck 'em, what they got to say?
Just throw your middles up and let the hoes know where they stand
This shit ain't 'bout no money bitch, this shit is more than just a brand!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The ones that know it, feel it, keep it and they won't forget it
This thing ain't dyin, it ain't fading cause they just won't let it
Y'all take the punches to the haters, I know what ya feeling
I was there not long ago I know the shit in which your dealing
But fuck, we Juggalos, so they can all just go to hell!
We got the pride and love, we scrubs, so fuck 'em go to hell!
Just keep them hatchets swinging, screaming, always keep it wicked
Keep one in the chamber for them fuckin hating sons o' bitches!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Rock a fuckin hatchet and we represent the underground![Hook]
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window (x3)

[Verse 1: Boondox]
I'm not afraid of the dark
But I'm afraid of my heart
And I'm afraid that everything is gonna fall apart
Always afraid that things will never get better
I went from writing down rhymes
To typing suicide letters
Diagnosed with paranoia
You can check my prescription
I'm a manic depressive
One of my many conditions
I'm not a prophet though I say it
But I'm seeing a vision
My life, it was beyond it
On a one-way collision
If ignorance is bliss
Then I'm devoid of any sorrows
Cause I don't wanna know the outcome
Of today or tomorrow
I just wanna hide inside my own private Hell
How can I ever get to Heaven
When so many angels fell
I'm just a human being
I'm just only being human
With eternity and judgement
From another always looming
It's a wonder that I made it
With these voices in my head
With all these monsters at my window
Staring at me in my bed

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Boondox]
If you're a friend to me or kin to me
An enemy or into me
I'm begging on a bended knee
Come and put an end to me
Put me out my misery
Permanently no injury
I'm tired of fighting entities
I'm running out of energy
Feel like a lost boy
Searching for the answers
Just waitin' on tragedy
A heart attack or even cancer
So many monsters hiding
Waiting round the corner for us
If life is like a song
I'm at the verse and searching for the chorus
Maybe I should stop and take a moment
Put it in perspective
Maybe I should take a knife
And take a life and get injected
I just wanna go out
On my own fucking terms
Knowing it was me that put me
In the dirt and with the worms
I think I'll pop another pill
Try to heal the ill
Wash it down with gasoline
Light a match and that's for real
But I'll just probably go to sleep
And try to clear my head
Hiding from these monsters
At my window  underneath my bed

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
Sittin' in my cell, this brick and bar hell
Dreamin' of the days of murder and locked in cartel
Drive bys, date rapes and weight like bar bells
I slit my girls throat dumped in McCart's well
Oh well, it's what i thought at the time
Cause in my own mind, it didn't like a crime
It seemed to be fine, all it was, was good times
Shoot a bitch, snort a line at the drop of a dime
Matter of fact the local mob was my first job
It's kinda easy when you killin' to rob
At least I wasn't sittin' home being a slob
I got up off my ass started climbin' to the top
They callin' me a demon and I'm asking how can I be
I know I got a heart, just lack of humanity
But now my sanity is something I ain't seen in a while
Sittin' on death row, this is my green mile

[Hook]
Locked up ain't where I wanna be
Confined in my mind is like a prison to me
Since birth had nothin' to choose
I'm on the run with a gun with nothin' to lose
[2x]

[Verse 2]
Childhood is the blame, poverty stricken
Acid defacs in the mix and watch the plot thicken
I was sick of being poor, sick of just living
Sick of depression and that trailor park prison
That mama had me struckin' and where was my dad
I think that he forgot about the son that he had
So the chances of survival were none to slim
And mama keeps saying I remind her of him
So if I'm just like my dad then I'm going to be broke
Pulled a kick door, stabed my neighbour in the throat
I set off on my journey to see what I could find
I watched scarface and knew the world was mine
As far back as I recall I was fearless
But now my death is near and it's clear that I fear this
I know that satan is waitin'
And I ain't found heaven
So I put my salvation in this chrome Mac 11

[Hook]
[2x]

[Verse 3]
It's about that time, I hear 'em comin down the line
My cell door slides and I'm hopin' that it will bind
I gotta make my move, it's the needle of death
About to shoot me in my veins till I take my last breath
Cold sweat breads bubble up, I can't stop shakin'
I gotta do something, keep thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'
I'm gonna die either way, nothing to lose
I look him dead in the eye then I make my move
I kicked the guard in the sternum, not a second to wait
The strenght from my adrenaline caved his chest plate
I hit the next guard in the face with my shackles
Paint the walls dark red with blood and bone spackle
Knocked the next off the C block balcony
I snatched a tazer gun, home free I'm about to be
Made a run for the door, I didin't look back
I got shot in the back of my head and...

(What the fuck!? Did you get him?
Back up! Check his pulse!
Is he dead?
Brandy, get over here, we need some help!
What happened?
Just move!
C'mon, alright, backup!
Shit! Son of a bitch!
He just... He just jumped up!)

[Hook]
[2x][Intro]
We walk all alone
Always on our own
We walk all alone
Always on our own

[Verse 1]
I remember when life was a struggle
It ain't all roses now but back then it was double
I remember when
When I ain't have no pot
When you piss on the floor you stay pissed off a lot
I remember when I was searchin' for answers
In the house of a dealer in the arms of a dancer
I remember when I thought I was finished
You been down this road then give me a witness

[Hook]
We walk all alone
Always on our own
Get lost on the way
And sometimes need
To find the way home
But we walk all alone
X2

[Verse 2]
When you walk on your own and you ain't got crystal
The future you sees at the end of a pistol
Lookin for clues that end up in wrong places
So many troubles and so many faces
Got blood on my hands from some crooked decisions
Blood on my heart from some painful divisions
Askin myself if I would take it all back
No I wouldn't this is my path

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I remember when I left you there cryin'
You was down on the floor and looked like you was dyin'
I remember when I seen you out drinkin'
Surrounded by dudes it felt like I was sinkin'
I remember when I pulled the fo-five
The safety was on and so you still alive
I remember when I was in holding stressin'
But lucky as hell cause they ain't find no weapon

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
So now that I'm grown and I'm thinkin' 'bout shit
'Bout the life that I lived and the things I did
All the ones do I hurt
And the ones who where there
All the people that fucked my and made me aware
You got to be strong to stand on your own
You gon' to do some wright and you gon' do some wrong
But when it's all over just lay there and laugh
You're dyin' alone but you stayed on the path

[Hook][Verse 1]
Pitch black red clay screams echo from the trees
Kudzu covers every living thing
And dead folks seen down by the side of a road
Voodoo chants to the echos and the squak of the crows
Yea, who knows just what you'll find on a midnight ride
If you stoppin' for a piss or if your battery dies
You'll wanna keep on movin', don't stop for a second
There's a thousand lost souls who fuckin' learned that lesson

[Bridge]
Somwhere past the old cemetery
There's a place where evil and death live (red dirt road)
The sun never shines and the devil walks by
This place ain't nothin' to mess with (red dirt road)

[Hook]
You'll die all alone where no one knows
So don't ride down that old red dirt road (red dirt road)

[Verse 2]
Blood chills and spills just like a liquid
And there's somethin' in the air that don't seem quite right
A red head dead bride floats by your ride
A staind dress that once was bright white
Baby breathe and steps on your window
While somethin' invisibles scream from a mossed shed
Decapitated spirit fade if you're near it
Then appears in your backseat lookin' for it's lost head

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Suicide sollution tha confussion
Many lost souls are restin' in pieces breezes
Blow through the trees they grab the trigger and squeeze
Then let their spirits join the other deceased it pleases
The demons screamin' needin' more of the same
The necronomicon is burned into this place like a flame
And it's callin' your name, the dirt road leads to hell's gates
Welcome into evil into death it's here, hell waits

[Bridge]

(Red dirt road) 2x

[Hook][Intro: Boondox]
Y'all thought I was done, huh?
Thought it was over?
Shit, it ain't over
I'm just gettin' started in this motherfucker
Boondox! The Scarecrow

[Hook]
And these moments I can't take
That I feel like I'mma break
When did I get so down
Never thought I slow down
Was it over? Got sober
Didn't know what I might do
Felt like hands from a priest and
It hit me that (I knew I was a motherfucking beast!)

[Verse 1]
Ain't been too long I've been sober
Blacked out most of my damn life
Bitches get fucked in bent over
I got shot on the next wife
Y'all don't know but a little bit
My shit ain't been closed to told
Always say that I'm loosin' it
But my soul ain't been close to sold
Angel on my shoulder and the devil in my right hand
Lookin' to Jehova, empty bottles on the night stand
Battle with delusion calls, battle with who close to me
So much damn confusion didn't know who I supposed to be
But never no more, repeat that never no more
I see that comin' from a mile away and never no more
Don't be that same motherfucker with my head up in the cloud
Not just another motherfucker screamin' "hey, look at me now"
Still rollin' with the heater, desert eagle, that will never change
Quick to pull the triger now y'all fools are never outta range
Only thing you need to know I got to put this on my tatt
Dox is fucking monster ressurected, put that on a hat

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The worst thing that they ever did
Was let me get my mind right
They shoulda kept me on that shit, not let me get my rhyme tight
19 days locked in the dark, y'all don't think I was coming back
Dirty now, he ain't got the heart, but here I spit on another track
Hoping that these bastards don't forgot how much they hate me
Hope they still be sleepin' on it and highly underrate me
Hope your girl still flicks her bean, while you at work to my shit
Hope she use your credit card on iTunes when she buy it
Now I got this new shit, enjoy it now and live it up
First that she hear this gon' be the last time that she give it up
On you can put that on a tall tee
With my number writen under it so she can call me
Call me? A motherfucker call me lame ass
Long as heatens love me you can put a bullet in my brain
And they gon' resurrect me on the third day (apparition)
You just feedin' fire to the flames bitch (ammunition)

[Hook x2][Intro:]
(Deep voice)
I can hear them screaming through the forest at night

Snakes (x20)

[Verse 1:]
In the belly of the beast a place that's miles away
In a deep Southern Town where the devil comes to pray
A choir sings with their eye's sewn shut
By a stream the children play in water flowin' with blood
The pastor stands on his pulpit while preachin' to hell
On a hilltop church with demons ringin' the bell
They toll twice for the missin' and the recently departed
In the pews the congregation sits a hundred days rotted
Suffering is all around the stench of death in the air
Nobody seems to notice or nobody seems to care
It's just an everyday life in a normal routine
People walkin' right by, but never notice the screams
A backwoods philosophy passed down through the ages
Generation of murder written down in these pages
Of a book, overlooked, and forgotten in history
A place with a secret and surrounded by mystery

[Hook:]
I can hear them screaming through the forest at night
They pray with snakes, and they've poisoned my mind
(x2)

[Verse 2:]
Was it a curse or a sickness that raged in the minds?
Of these sacrileges hillbillies raised with the swine?
No remorse in their souls in their hearts pitch black
Thirsty for the blood high on murder contact
Feastin' on the brains of the ones they call sinners
Cousin Cletus in the kitchen carvin' torsos for dinner
In a barn on a meat hook bodies are hangin'
In the cellar by a chain more bodies are swingin'
And in the fields like a scene from an old parkin' lot
Abandoned for so many years cars left to rot
And buried in the garden in a hole dug deep
All the bones and the belongings all piled in a heap
Ungodly sounds of torture echo through the trees
The screams and suffering still blowin' in the breeze
Not on any map, undiscovered, never surveyed
Secrets of a small town kept locked away

[Hook:]
I can hear them screaming through the forest at night
They pray with snakes, and they've poisoned my mind
(x2)

[Interlude Skit:]
Just about any warm afternoon
You can find the weathered looking white haired man
Wandering the hills searching for poisonous snakes
Not to kill, but to bring back with him for church
He is a serpent handler

[Hook:]
I can hear them screaming through the forest at night
They pray with snakes, and they've poisoned my mind

[Outro:]

They pray with snakes. (x8)

Snakes (x16)

(Evil laughing)

(Little girl laughing)[Hook x2]
I ain't never had no easy life
What I have become, didn't come from thinking twice
Put That On everything (everything), everyone (everyone)
Born to fill the prophecy the sun of the seventh son..

[Verse 2]
I was born with a forked tongue, Born to Spit the Wicked Shit
Childhood circumstances made the motherfucking shit legit
Even as a little kid I knew that most would hate me
My uncle tried to kill me, that's what they say helped to make me
Lost up in my mind, I never fuck with any medications
Slowly over time went from crazy into desperation
Never learned to cope with feelings, Never felt a fucking thing
Never gave a fuck enough, so never placed no fucking blame
Haters talk about me they knew something was wrong
Starting choking out my friends and they knew that I was gone
I was labeled as a bad seed said I needed therapy
In and out of schools for drug abuses and vulgarities
Sent away so many times try to fix a broken child
He's so mean, he's fucking sick, the little bastard never smiles
A lot of doctors teachers family members, had their own say
I wanna take the time to thank them for the man I am today

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
When the devil came to Georgia, made his first stop at Covington
Looked me in the eyes and told me son your the seventh one
Put - cha pen to paper, put ya blood in every fuckin line
An angel on my shoulder, put my blood in every fuckin rhyme
Been a little crazy but I got a way that I can deal
Now I got some people understandin how the fuck I feel
Instead of choking bitches out and catchin me a murder case
I get up in the booth and let the mic take these bitches place
Many in trials n tribulations put me in a situation
Went from sittin in the back to preachin to the congregation
Many tried to douse the flame throw some salt up in my game
Stab me in my fuckin back n I ain't gotta say no names
Came from rehabilitation runnin streets and pocket change
Now I hit the road in busses people screamin out my name
I ain't think I make it thought that adolescence was the end
But I'm just getting started, let the age of the crow begin

[Hook x2]

I ain't never had no easy life, everything, everyone[Hook x2]
See the leaves falling to the ground
See them falling all around
On the cemetary mound

[Verse 1]
Teardrops on my notepad
Dope sick feels so bad
Everything seems so fucked up
I'm about to go mad
My life tried to live right
This night hope will end right
Hell's doors open wide
Inside here's your invite
One breath should I use it?
Life/Death should I choose it?
Legacy, life of me
Hear my voice in this music
Phone calls to a few peeps
No promises to keep
Close my eyes kiss the sky
And Then just go to sleep
So long tried to hold on
So long tried to stay strong
Everything that I know and grow
Now seems long gone
No more hearing "I should try"
No more wishing I would die
Close my eyes, let it go
And leave you with "Goodbye"

[Hook x2]

Everybodies gonna die some day [x2]

[Verse 2]
One love to all those
That got me through the lows
And stood by my side
And they came out to my shows
And gave me a reason
To pick up this hatchet
And run with the family
Scream Psychopathic
I wanna thank you for the time spent
You don't know how much it really meant
To have a family show love to a scrub
Who came up from shit
I hope you know that I give all
You show me how to always stand tall
Brought me from the grip of death
So know that I love yall

[Hook x4]

Everybodies gonna die some day [x2]

[Hook x3]

See the leaves falling to the ground[Violent J]
When I'm clownin'
I get silly
Like something lace my Philly
Been known to pop a pilly
And cop a check with billy
When I'm clownin'
My heart beat poundin'
I sweat so much I'm drownin'
Because my shows astoundin'
And Faygo grape I'm downin'
When I'm clownin'
Aabrakadabra alakazam what have ya
Quick slight of hand I stab ya
Demons crawl out and grab ya
When I'm clownin'
There's plenty laughing
Blood on the walls what happened?
A massive murder stabbin
Cause wicked shit I'm blabbin
When I'm clownin'
Shit come alive
And don't no one survive
Off the light rig I dive
And this shit ain't no jive
When I'm clownin'

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
When I'm clownin'
I'm Psycoilly
Snatch out your icy grilly
I owes the mob a milly
Bout to knock off a Chili's
When I'm clownin'
Mad hoes I'm springin
They want my dingalingin
Ooh let's fuck)
They singin I keep my hatchet swingin'
When I'm clownin'
I I I'm super sick
Bones o bobber shoot you quick
Why you cuz youz a dick
Is he dead?
Poke him use a stick
When I'm clownin'
I'm heavy high powered
Mad energy devoured
The whole milky way sour
Let my acid rain shower
When I'm clownin'
Everything's a joke
That angel's wings are broke
So hot your speakers smoke
I freak this 'til I croak

[Boondox]
Fresh off the red muds of Covington, Georgia
Running with the hatchet
Is Boondox with two wicked whoops for you
Danny Brown, show the underground
How you get down with the clown

[Danny Brown]
Take a whole eighth to the face
Anything on my mind right now been erased
And I taste that taste
Of a nice thin waist
Wanna pick that up
Put the pussy on my face
Ate a whole hand full of shrooms
Huffin' on balloons got me in a spinnin' room
All these pills I consume
Got me hollerin' at the moon
Like, what's that, kaboom
While IC fill the room
You don't really want it with me
You know it's Danny Brown with ICP
Grub her down low, bring her back for a G
But before you do that, lemme see ID
Bout to drop a deuce in my Faygo
Sippin like the west got me moving up in slow-mo
Oh no, let's go
Pass the blunt around
Them hoes gettin' pounded when I be clownin'[Verse 1: Boondox]
Gimme a reason to have you sleeping with the demons
Fire breathing out the Glock and it's screaming
Bitch go and see him
Now you're grieving at the thought of this human no longer being
Seemin' like you was dreaming
And thinking this can not be
And you see ya feeling the heat from the fire
Burnin' and churnin' inside ya
Looking to Heaven and praying
Angels will come in to find ya
Suffer eternally torture just like a fetus abort ya
Line you up like cattle to the slaughter and sort ya
Go into that light that red beam on my Ruger
I'm ready like Freddy but no my last name ain't Krueger
I'm killing you softly but no I am not a refugee
Soak you in kerosene and burn you like effigies
Just like a serpent I'll strike you like it was nothing
And quicker than liquor my venom enters your bloodstream
Runnin' your mouth and then thinking that you can handle this
Have you surrounded by velvet blew out just like a candle bitch

[Hook x2]
Come on in
I heard the demon screaming
I heard the demon screaming as his body bled
Mind altering
Abaddon

[Verse 2: Boondox]
Walk up behind ya and pop ya sever your spinal cord
Then kick you and spit on you
While you're jerkin' down on the floor
Watching the life as it leaves you
Eyes roll into your head
Then empty the clip in your body
Makin' sure that you're dead
Say my name backwards proceed to speaking in tongues
Then take the soul from your body
Like I took the air from your lungs
I bathe in the blood of the lamb
To get me to Heavens gate
I bathe in the blood of the damned
Grinnin' to steal a taste
Call me the reaper
Call me the angel of homicide
I'll come to your family reunion
Take out your mom aside
Drag you to Hell like them shadows fuckin' with Patrick Swayze
Drag you to Hell like that shit directed by Sammy Raimi
Blow up your spot like the ghost
I'll torch you with laser eyes
Then fuck your old lady with a dick
Made of razor knives
Ride with the hounds of Hell
The one king of Avalon
You fuck with the Devil, Damien AKA Abaddon

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Boondox]
The trouble with the curb is the swerve they throw
The means to the end is the hurt to grow
The betrayal from another who's trust ya know
All the emotions kept hid that you don't wanna show
How many times has the sharp pain hit ya?
The knife in your back someone always out to get ya
You turn around just to see familiar faces
Then all of a sudden took the unfamiliar places
I thought I knew ya. We was tight, we was best friends
Concealed things. Sheep's clothing you was dressed in
Held out your hands, blood stains while I bled out
Defying til the end but you won't never get the red out
I always had your back, you always went behind mine
I always had a minute, you could never find time
I'd take a bullet for ya, you could put that in a quote
You'd pull the trigger, call it suicide, and sign the note

[Hook: Crucifix]
Wastin' time
Pretending that I'm never gonna trust again
Saw your lies
Cost my heart and blood in my ears
I'm Hating life, every single second I'm a true pysch
I'm Hating here...
Cause every breath that you breathe is betrayal

[Verse 2: Boondox]
I never shoulda let you get that close to me
And I never shoulda opened up those doors for free
You put the pussy on me like a pair of handcuffs
And then beat me close fisted, bare knuckles, no gloves
You knew my weakness, and my weaknesses was you
We fucked a lot, forget about the sneaky shit you do
Like goin' through my phone, emails
All the accusations
Every other day, another false set of allegations
The constant lies that I knew that you was tellin'
The constant cries, I was buying, you were sellin'
The false wording like I'd be with you forever
The day I stopped ignoring it, put two and two together
And I seen you for the demon, not the angel you portrayed
I shoulda choked you out and put you in a unmarked Grave
Just deep enough to hide your fuckin' lies and betrayal
Like the rest of all the snakes left to rot. Burn in hell

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crucifix]
Like a bullet on a dark night
What's love without a fight
She a devil and her heart so cold
And she never gonna let it go [Let it go]
She got a mind full of sick thoughts
Like I could be the man when she pissed off
Evil things to make the killer skin crawl
But it's betrayal that became the devil's dying fall
A dirty broad with the flaw, just a lustful pain
To see her suffer like the other lovers, that's a game
She cut like a blade, then the vein, with the same, with the pain
Took the blade to the fame
Just to get a motherfucker to put a stain on his name
But it can never be erased from a shame to brains
So pick you pair, pick your pill, pick your poison man
Pick your passion, pick your casket cause it's all the same
The devils daughter, she quenched like water
Got you walkin' to a bear, like a lamb to the slaughter

[Hook]

Every single breath you breath's like lies inside my headJuggalos and Juggalettes!
It makes me proud to announce... from The South of Hell
Boondox


[Hook (x2): DJ Clay]
Who gon catch me when I'm fallin down into darkness?
What have I created? my dreams fall apart when
A demon gets discovered, an angel has to suffer
Just leave me in my hell, I won't put nothin above us

[Verse 1: Boondox]
One brick from an inferno pinch
Fire in my veins burning like a bitch
So sick till I get my fix, I'm sweatin in the corner with a crucifix
Her tears they fall like bastard angels fall from Heaven's graces
This Hell I'm livin in, this sin, I'm seein' demons faces
The darkness take over, my senses fall into a coma
Mix blood and soma, wash it down with some holy water
Dance with the devil by the pale moonlight with a needle for my appetite
Get on my level, six feet in the dirt, never see the light

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Boondox]
No rest for this wicked soul and everybody suffer when it takes control
My family lookin at me like I'm the demon
I'm trying to hide it but they know, somehow they do
Gotta keep movin down this vanishing path
When I'm stuck in a chemical bath, soaking on my own behalf
But I'm takin them with me, as much as I try to lead them right while I go left
I know they're trying to help me but I gotta face this demon by myself
As I wonder who gave me this curse, it was me and yet no other
If I can't win against this demon, forever my angels have to suffer

[Hook]

[Bridge: Boondox]
On my knees I look to the sky, please, lord help me now
It's got me and I don't know how, but everything I know is gone
Sittin here I'm all alone, and trying to figure everything out[Intro]
It's R.O.C., it's '07
Out with the old, in with the new
Blaze said the cemetery full of dead neck bitches
They swallow, I believe him I don't know why but I do

[Verse 1: Blaze]
Scopin' on the streets and rollin' with windows down
I get so hard that it leaves cracks in the motherfucking ground
I want the dead to wake up and ride with me
Baby I'm tipsy from sipping on the Hennessy, smoking sweet leaf
Roll in the cemetery, anyone will do
Turn up the volume and take a look all around you
Bitches arise from the grave like
"Hey we heard you like to listen and we got a lot to say, you wanna chat?"
Bitch fuck that, I want to bust a quick nut
Me and my homie Boondox is looking to get our dick sucked
We want some dead neck and you know what it's about
So come over here and put our fuckin dicks up in ya mouth

[Hook]
(So we can splash)
Let me get some of that dead neck
(So we can splash)
Dead bitches suck a good dick
X4

[Verse 2: Boondox]
Connected with the dead
These tricks is needin' fed
Throwing dick off in cadavers
Fucking holes in they head
Getting brain from a brain
Got me going insane
And the slit off in her throat is where my nuts hang
Dancing zombies bitches like I'm up in the club
Shoving dollars through their stitches, necrophiliac love
It's all good with these ho's when they working the pole
Got they tonsils mutilated by Blaze and the Scarecrow
Yo shorty, work it twerk it, drop that dead ass
Get down on your knees, open wide for the next blast
Come hooked, don't rock it with a full pocket
We just getting started, now I'm going for the eye socket

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blaze]
Now I'm back to the cemetery every other Friday
Looking for the same crusty bitches that do it my way
Boondox bought a forty, got a fifty inch [?]
So I'm gonna see how freaky they can be
Dead ho's show up in droves
All searching for dick holes
Put it in one and pulled it out
With half her throat still attached
The home girl gobbling on my nuts like they were snackin'
These are the kind of hoes that I attract
Dead bitches want dick and this is obvious
By the way they stuff the whole thing in they esophagus
And that's How I like it, I'm hooked on dead neck
Fuck a hood rat cause this is the best yet
Dead neck, this is where it's at

[Hook]

[Outro]
Explain to me how an encounter with the dead
In the cemetery can be an addiction?
Whether or not the woman is alive or dead is irrelevant
It's the art of love making that we hold and cherish in our heart
