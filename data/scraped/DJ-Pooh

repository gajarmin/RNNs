[Produced by DJ Pooh]

[Verse 1]
Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinking will I live another 24
I gotta go cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm asking y'all
"Which park are y'all playing basketball?"
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexing, didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watching "Yo! MTV Raps"
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas and watch me break 'em
With the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7 even back door Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yelling domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion, hit the 3-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
2 in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp"
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I got to say it was a good day

[Outro]
Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit. What the fuck am I thinking about?‚Äù[2Pac - Speaking]
The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm taking back what's mine

[Slowed down voice]
You motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)
Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so God damn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-0) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost

[Hook x2: 2Pac]
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
A Mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(Hey man, come the fuck on)
And then we'll be ghost

[Hook]

FUCK THE POLICE NIGGA![Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yo B (turn your speakers up man)
Turn your speakers up money!
Yo God! (Yo God?)
Yo I got mad skills
Isn't that money?

[Hook: Snoop Dogg, repeat 2x]
New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
It's the incredible, the lyrical
You can't be me like Niecey, to see me is gonna take a miracle
I'm driving motherfuckers hysterical, with a
Touch of this twister, stylistic mixture
What I create pulsates, there is no escape
Annihilate your mental mindstate
Dre labels my vocabulary abusive
I packs more knowledge than Confucius, I'm deadly
Induce you like Medusa, with thoughts to shed
And niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near
Prepare, catch me chillin' like the winter
Up against the number one contender, as I enter
Cause I gets heated like friction
Motherfuck your whole jurisdiction, react this fact not fiction
Telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital
Dangerous and vital to all my rivals
Suicidal, brainwaves conveys
To the average motherfucker's minds these days
I'm all ready to put work in
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirking
Give a FUCK, what's your name, what you claim
Or why you came, motherfucker
Don't explain
Simply, don't tempt me, cause I'm simply
Leavin hoes lives empty, the invincible MC

[Hook: repeat 2x]
New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound
Too much, I serve too many people, too much
It's too much, I serve too many people
And when I finish servin ain't gon be no sequel

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Gimme a couple G's, for every MC, I knocked to his knees
Verbally useless, oh you got the juice? I squeeze you juiceless
The barbaric, versatile, you're no kin to me
So how the fuck you inherit my style?
Now, out the clear blue sky, I can't deny
Not a day goes by, don't get high, don't ask why
Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones
Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis
Gets me into verbally vindictive
Violent vocabulary bobs to existence
Catch me in the pitch black path
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental
Till I hear an instrumental
And detrimental verbals get to spittin
The highest in intellect, try connectin with the written
Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war
Dips like a low-low, with my verbal fo'-fo'
The cocoa complexion MC with the slow flow
Fo sho', I takes it to you from the do'
Motherfucker, mentally I go hardco' (you know!)
I disconnect ya, Kurupter, MC to vocally
Void your whole molecular, structure
Catastrophic, mystic as Mixelplix
Hittin MC's like dicks the deadliest lyricist

[Hook]

[Kurupt]
We live... tonight I serve two thousand MC's
We live... cause can't none fuck with the DPG'z
[Daz]
We live (baby) because tonight I serve two thousand MC's
We live (baby) none can fuck with the DPG'z
[Snoop]
A-B-C-D-P-G-C, ba-by
A-B-C-D-P-G-C
Ba-by...

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Eryday, I bust rhymes and recite
In ways that make MC's stop in daylight
I'm the deadliest MC you wanna see on the streets
Invincibility is what makes
Me complete, compete
Nah you can't even fade me
I fuck, you, your momma, your auntie, and your lady...
*bzzt to static*[Intro: Das EFX]
Yeah! Word is bond!
Das EFX in this ya know what I'm sayin'?
Straight from the sewer, word is bond!
Yeah! We doing this with my nigga
Where my nigga? Ice Cube in the motherfucker
Word is bond!

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
You better check yourself before you wreck yourself
Cause I'm bad for your health, I come real stealth
Dropping bombs on your moms, fuck car alarms
Doing foul crime, I'm that nigga with your Alpine
Sold it for a 6-0, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got the indo
No I'm not a sucker, sitting in a House of Pain
And no I'm not the butler, I'll cut ya
Headbutt ya, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, punk motherfucka
Here to let you know boy, oh boy
I make dough, but don't call me Dough Boy
This ain't no fucking motion picture
A guy or bitch-a, I'll get wit'cha
And hit ya, taking that Yak to the neck
So you better run a check

[Hook: Das EFX and Ice Cube]
[Das] So come on and chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Yeah, come on and check yo self before you wreck yo self
[Ice]Cause shotgun bullets are bad for your health

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Tricks want to step to Cube and then they get played
Cause they bitch-made, pulling out a switchblade
That's kinda trifle, cause that's a knife, ho
AK-47 assault rifle
Hold the 50, I'm nifty, pow
I gotta new style, (Watch out now!)
I hate motherfuckers claiming that they're folding bank
But steady talking shit in the holding tank
First you want to step to me
Now your ass screaming for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row
Now they running up in you slow
You're gone, used to be the Don Juan
Now your name is just "Tuan"

Switchin', snappin', rolling your eyes and neck
You better run a check

[Hook]

[Ice Cube] Cause big dicks up your ass is bad for your health

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate
You could've had a V8
Instead of a tre-eight slug to the cranium
I've got 6 and I'm aiming em
Will I shoot or keep you guessing?
Cause fuck you and that shit you stressing
Bitch, get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighborhood hooker
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Giving up the claps and who needs applause?
At a time like this, pop the coochie and you're dead
The bitch is a Miami Hurricane hit
Sprung, niggas call her "Lips and Lungs"
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out

Cause women like you gets no respect
Bitch, you better run a check

[Hook]

[Ice] Cause bitches like you is bad for my health[Intro]
Outlaw Immortalz
Bow down to somethin' greater than yourself, trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know you watchin'
But you ain't seein' what lies before you, biatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
Blessed with the gift of speech
The power to reach
Each nigga on every street
May the heavenly father look down and be proud of what transpired
Since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs, livin' like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true

[Verse 1]

[2Pac]
*laughing*
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
I pull revenge on bitch niggas that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed
He shoulda never fucked around with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggas run
Best be prepared for the Outlawz, here we come

[Hussein Fatal]
They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin' ya niggas' cradle with a knife in your navel
Rap-related, criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
Til the end, I'm tellin' all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggas bleed, I see Mo

[Kastro]
I be shinin' like white diamonds and crystal
Glistenin' holdin' pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'mma last yo past all these Glass Joes
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin' those same niggas runnin' late, to their fate

[Napoleon]
My alias is motherfuckin' Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
Robbin' again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin'
But it ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin'
Befo' a nigga finish with puttin' in work I betta end up with somethin'
I think these niggas got the game fucked up
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin' cases, fuck probation
Is what I'm screamin' when these money hungry cops be chasin'

[Hook: 2Pac] (x2)
Thug nigga til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride

[Verse 2]

[Mussolini]
It's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini
Mentally unstable G status, so you can't see me
Drug warlord, riding Concorde jets
Rag Vette's, shakin bitches and snitches and trippin on sets
Inglewoods banger, keepin one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini

[E.D.I.]
They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin up on these niggas easy
It ain't nuttin, cause if they wantin somethin, so I'mma commence
To dumpin stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin, Thuggin
To my fuckin last note, with Lo-Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride

[Kadafi]
My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she jock me
Severely addicted to livin like a fuckin felon
While beefin with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin
Since a shorty I been livin life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin like a giant, and I ain't lyin
It's like it's me against myself with all these
Backstabbin snakes grabbin at my fuckin wealth

[Mo Khomeini]
Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the Glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make em feel a nigga when I'm mashin
Now I'm surpassin any assassin

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]

[2Pac]
Hahahaha, Outlaw Immortalz baby
Y'all niggas can't fade this ol crazy shit
Makaveli, Hussein, Kastro, Khadafi, Mussolini
Amin, Naploleon, Khomani
What y'all really wanna do?
Haha, like them niggas said
"What would you do? If you could fuck with me and my crew"
Hehahahahaha, Thug Life, yeah nigga
Flashin on niggas
Thug Life right? This year we Thug Life
But we Outlaw Immortalz
We die nigga, but we multiply, we like legends nigga, like forever
Like I'll make you famous motherfucker
I'm talkin about Newsweek and Time Magazine and all that ol good shit
My niggas make the papers baby
My niggas make the front page
The gunshots can't stop me, they know (fades)[Intro: King Tee]
King Tee's drunk again...Yo, check this out: awww shit, aw shit, I
Wanna dedicate this song to all them motherfuckers out there that-that-that-
That-that-that-that (not again) perpentratin'...perpetratin'... perpin'
Tratin'. Wait, rewind. (eh but yo...King Tee, man, what is this? What is
This?)

[Verse 1: King Tee]
Some cool shit for the King's anthology
And when I'm done, don't expect no apology
Stupid motherfuckers shoulda stepped when I warned 'em
I'm from the Boondocks of Compton, California
I'm just anxious to whoop some ass
I went to high school, but I flunked every class
So what makes you think I give a fuck about respect?
I'll put your bitch in check, and I'll bet
You won't run up, son of a punk and a bitch, too
I shoulda did a drive by on you and your crew
Cuz ya'll be poppin' some shit that's unheard of
For you, what's the word? Uh...(wack!)...it's murder, son
When I be crushin' your hood with a passion
And I ain't talkin' that Action Jackson
When I come you better run for ammo
Or get played like a fuckin' piano...

And yo, we got my homeboy Ice Cube in the house from the motherfuckin'
Lench Mob ('Sup, nigga?), and yo Ice Cube, I heard you're a singer now
Man what's up? Yo, yo...

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Do-Ray-Me. But I don't sing, mothafucker
I kick shit with the King, mothafucker
Ice Cube will clock the cash, rock the mass
And if you run up, I'll sock your ass
And watch that eye get swollen
Cuz I'm playin' punk niggas like Beethoven
So bust a cap or swing and die
Fuck Yul Brynner, it's still The King and I
Cuz where I'm from the sun don't shine
So One-Time hope I only bust one rhyme
But I bust one more for the suckers
Last year I was Ruthless, now I'm Lenchin' mothafuckers
And you'll see in a tree, MCs and crews
Now they're lookin' for me, King Tee, and Pooh
Now every nigga that crossed me's soprano
Cuz I played their ass like a fuckin' piano...

[King Tee] Yo, check this out, we got my homeboy Breeze in the
Motherfuckin' house from the L.A. Posse, and he got some shit to holler. Come
On, man, bust this shit

[Verse 3: MC Breeze]
Well, I'm-a take the mic like it was a jack move
Run with the beat as long as the track moves
Hot as lava, organized like a seminar
Serve you, your crew, him, and them and a
Couple of rap-saps who think they can get butt
You slipped and shit, so nitwit, just get the nuts
Stealin' your high hopes, watchin' you write notes
Better walk a chalk line, not fuckin' a tightrope
Rap slicker, thicker, quicker than others, then I stop swift
Shift from 1st to 5th, while you stop to shoplift
Take the mic stand whenever the duty calls
If I bust a nut for every rhyme I had, I'd get blue balls
Serious as drama, I'm-a watch her say "Me too."
You're shorter than Michu, your rhymes are see-through
You're nothin' like GQ, transparent, I made it apparent
I'm here to wax and tax the incoherent
Cuz B-R-E-E-Z-E will eas-i-ly re-main to be-e a top MC
When you see me, I wear a beanie, and not a Kangol
Now you got played, like a fuckin' piano

[Verse 4: King Tee]
This is just a sample of three black nig-roes
Who grew up in the heart of the ghetto
Doin' what we had to just to make ends meet
Some steal for a livin', some stand on the street
Just slang. Some gang-bang, but big deal
They say in Compton, you gotta kill or get killed
Mothafuckin' police pull ya over, slam ya down
Then tell ya that your hood is their town
And I ain't goin' for no shit like that;
Cuff me up, take me to jail, I'll come back
Talkin' much shit, cuz I talk what the fuck I feel
A few weeks in the county ain't no big deal
So a punk like you can't fuck with me
That big ballin'-ass nigga named King Tee
You think ya can? I don't think that you can, though
Peace to Ice Cube and Breeze, and the fuckin' piano[Sample]
Stalking, walking in my big black boots (2x)

[Ice Cube]
God damn, another fuckin payback with a twist
Them motherfuckers shot but the punks missed
Ice Cube is out-gunned, what is the outcome?
Will they do me like Malcolm?
Cause I bust styles, new styles, standin - strong!
While, others +Run+ a +Hundred Miles+
But I never run, never will
Deal with the devil with my motherfuckin steel - BOOM!
Media try to do me
But I was a Boy-N-the-Hood before the movie, yeah
Call me nigga, bigot and a spook
But you the one that voted for Duke, motherfucker
White man, is somethin I tried to study
But I got my hands bloody, yeah
They said I could sing like a Jaybird
But nigga, don't say the J-word
I thought they was buggin
Cause to us Uncle Sam, is Hitler without an oven
Burnin our black skin
Buy my neighborhood - then push the crack in
Doin us wrong from the first day
And don't understand why a nigga got an AK
Callin me an African-American
Like everything is fair again, shit
Devil, you got to get the shit right I'm black
Blacker than a trillion midnights
+Don't Believe the Hype+ was said in '88
By the great Chuck D, now they're tryin to fuck me
".. with +No Vaseline+
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline.." - HUH!
It's a great day for genocide (What's that?)
That's the day all the niggas died
They killed JFK in '63
So what the fuck you think they'll do to me?
But I'm the O.G. and I bust back (boom boom)
Bust back (Boom boom!) peel a cap (BOOM BOOM!)
Gimme room in the fire of the sun
Here the mack come, here the black come, watch Jack run!
Motherfuckers can't gank me
Fuck a devil, fuck a rebel, and a yankee
Overrun and put the Presidency
After needin that, I'm down wit O.P.P., yeah
I met Farrakhan and had dinner
And you ask if I'm a five-percenter, well...
No, but I go where the brothers go
Down with Compton Mosque, Number 54
Made a little dough, still got a sister on my elbow
Did Ice Cube sell out? You say, "Hell no!"
A black woman is my manager, A black woman is my manager, not in the kitchen
So could you please stop bitchin?

"Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots" -] Brother J
[Cube] Yeah, yeah..
"But when will they shoot?"
"Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots" -] Brother J
[Cube] Yeah, yeah..
"But when will they shoot?"
.. {*automatic gunfire*)

[Ice Cube]
You missed, and didn't hit Da Lench Mob either
"Guerillas in the Mist.." without Jungle Fever
But I got the fever for the flava of a cracker
Not a Pringle, bust the single, here's my new jingle
"Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots"
The KKK has got three-piece suits
Using niggas like turkey shoots
My motto is +Treat 'Em Like a Prostitute+
Now if I say no violence, devil, you won't respect mine
Fuck the dumb shit - and get my Tec-9
And if they approach us
A-ight, a-ight - I bury those cockroaches
And if you can't deal with my +Kill at Will+
Here's a new gift to get - try my +Death Certificate+
+Amerikkka's Most+, Amerikkka's burnt - it's like toast
Like Jordan, I'm goin coast to coast
Dribblin the funk here comes the nigga
With the motherfuckin monster dunk, get off me punk!
"Jordan.. watch Jordan
Aiyyo yo watch Jordan .. YES!"
"You better eat your Wheaties" -] M.J

"Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots" -] Brother J
[Cube] Yeah, yeah..
"But when will they shoot?"
"Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots" -] Brother J
[Cube] Yeah, yeah..
"But when will they shoot?"

[Ice Cube]
Darryl Gates got the studio surrounded
Cause he don't like the niggas that I'm down with
Motherfucker wanna do us
Cause I like Nat, Huey, Malcolm, and Louis
Most got done by a black man's bullet
Give a trigger to a nigga and watch him pull it
Negro assass-in
I'mma dig a ditch, bitch, and throw yo' ass in
When they shoot, no, it won't be a cracker
They use somebody much blacker
What I do? I called up the Geto Boy(s) crew
Cause +My Mind's Playing Tricks On Me+ too
Never died, surround my crib
And F.O.I. makin sure nobody creep when I sleep
Keep a 9 millimeter in my Jeep - PEEP!
When I roll, I gots to roll deep
Ain't goin out cheap
Met the MADD Circle on Cypress Hill cause it's so steep
They'll never get me, they'll never hit me
Motherfuck that shit J-Dee
Now I'm relaxed
Grab the St. Ide's brew so I can max
Sittin by the window cause it's so fuckin hot
And then I heard a shot - boomAll I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...
*repeat*

Instructions to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scoping out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close cos they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
Cos I'mma make things get better for me
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide, the East is my side
I'mma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
Oh yes I'm fresh 'till i expire from existence
Wit persistence I perceive
To supply you wit what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crystal
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm tryin to keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

Chorus:

Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
*repeat x2*

*?Teatlet?*, hold em, shake em, roll
Fly G boys and all you hoodrat girls
Pound puts it down all around the world
But let's pick up the litter, LB young nigga
I need solar on my Dogg nall, I bark when it get dark
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Always, strays try to follow me home
Uhh, to get the pooper scooper, why? They droppin doo-doo
I'm steppin on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashin full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail
For the bow-wow LBC style
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want em close enough so I can lock on em
Wit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em
Man's best friend, I hit you for ten, uhh
Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?
Major trick we're hittin licks like the Doberman Gang
Y'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG

Chorus:

All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
*repeat x2*

They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
Weed out, DP'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knockin at'cha door
We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses
Knockin' niggas like Cassius, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin
Bustin, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone
Free the D-O-double G with the solid gold bone

Chorus:

Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
*repeat x3*(LL Cool J)
That's right y'all this is the LL Cool J party
Move it, move it, move it, get on the floor baby
That's right, don't try to front like your fly
GET OUT THERE!

(LL Cool J)
To rappers I'm a nightmare on Elm Street
Hellafied hotter than heat, guess why the other's can't eat?
Cause I'm a carnivore and I can eat much more
Than a fat man after a pack-a-jam
L.L.'s thicker than butter, well-known throat cutter
When I'm involved all the amateurs stutter
They're scared and can't believe that their whole crew
Ain't a rapper alive that can fill my shoes
I'm dope on a rope, virgins wanna elope
I do the hustle and the shuffle and the rope-a-dope
Cause I'm the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

(LL Cool J)
Three hundred and fifty seven reasons
Why you gotta get your butt on the floor right now
We ain't playin, we came here to get ill
Iller than ill, LL youknowI'msayin?

(LL Cool J)
Just like Ali Baba and the 40 thevz
So nasty you don't know whether to stay or leave
More feared, than even Blue Beard, I serve Primrose
A picture of me, is like one of Michelangelo's
I don't play the banjo will you ever understand yo
Servin I mean the matter how old I go Rambo
Cock-strong, half a block long
Illy ill fire starter hittin harder than King Kong
Not a battle-axe, not run-of-the-mill
Not easily knocked out or easily killed
Cause I'm the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

(LL Cool J)
A hundred and ninety five pounds punk
More bounce to the ounce and I say what counts
KnowI'msayin?
Now get yourself on the floor
Stop actin like a sissy

(LL Cool J)
Boy, I'm better than better is, badder than badder is
I won't scare em or dare em I'll just splatter his
Guts kick his butt while Bob is rockin the cuts
Wanna step in the ring with me, you must be nuts
Not Isis in a crisis, or Freddy when he's ready, or Jason when he's chasin'
My silhouette, a scene I mean I'm icin' and acin'
Amateurs who lack it, can't hack it, I attack it, that's why I wanna crack it
They're sellin' the soul of little kids who can't roll
I told em, scold em, teach em and mold em
Get paid ten knots at a time and then I fold em
I remember the blood and I remember what told em
I can, can't cause I'm down with E yet you have the audacity
To try and mess with him and me
Hypersonic is weak and Supersonic is wack
Sneak around after midnight, like a Siamese cat
Pellum (1, 2, 3) catch twenty-two I'm H-A-R-D
I'm the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

(LL Cool J)
A beatdown can be arranged
Yo baby you look fine spread em
Yo homeboy get up against the wall, what's this in your pocket
What is this?
Move it, move it, move it

(LL Cool J)
I'm a nappy, sappy crappy imitator of who
If I ever imitated it wouldn't be you, ooooh
You don't know so many have died when the LL growl was amplified
Get back better yet step back get dat
Like Shaft and The Mack, cause I'm mad and I'm black
I'm the perfect blend, a good boyfriend
I'm the reason rap rules the country, I'm Cool
J-A-M-E-S; fresh as a cliche, but soul is my forte
Disco is out, rhythm and blues is old news
P's and Q's keep me in new shoes
And you're dissin me because I'm young and I'm strong
And I'm capable of making a platinum LP
Wrong you was, you assumed I was all in
But boy is for ballin they'll never say I'm fallin
Callin all cars for the brother in black
L-E-L the Mack back bone of this track
The force full of force to put you on your back
Makin' hit after hit, while you search for a contract
Hotter than hot now watch how hot I can get
Leavin' rappers freeze-dried and skimmer's dimmer's wet
Cause I'm the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

(LL Cool J)
Now the LL posse is now handin out speed knots
To all those who don't want to get busy
That's right baby get your body on the floor
Move it, move it
.357 at point blank range ain't nothin strange
You're havin a heart attack is at your back
Now listen to me bring it, bring it on, on down, down, down, down, down, down[ VERSE 1 ]
It's Friday night on the streets of L.A
I'm goin out, been hangin round the house all day
So i take me a shower, dress like a big daddy
Stop at the Arco, put some gas in my caddy
Armor on my wheels, shine up my daytons
Check my 12-gauge, I see jackers just waitin
Got in my car, rolled up the tinted glass
Looked for my Zapp tape to pop in my dash
Can't find it, forget it, went under my seat
Found my old fired tape of the song "Knee Deep"
So I popped it in, then I pumped it up
Love hearin funk because disco sucks
Body got chills when the basses started poundin
I took off because I'm goin to town, and
Won't be back till mornin, don't have to go to school
(Better get ready) I'm finna act a fool

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now I'm on the move, got a grand in my pocket
Reached for my phone, plugged it in the socket
Heard the dial tone, so I dialed up Aladdin
He answered the phone and said "What's up?" I said "What's happenin"
He said, "Where you been? I been tryin to get in touch
The party's in Watts," I said, "I don't give a fuck"
"If you wanna go, just wear neutral colors
If anybody asks you, just tell em you're my brother"
Stopped at the store to buy me a Cisco
A 40 ounce and some crackers by Nabisco
[Amount] and I pulled out a 10
And said, "Fuck it, Supersacco and gin
I'm finna act a fool"

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I'm drivin down Compton on my way to get Aladdin
Feelin like a pimp till my tape started draggin
It's a old tape anyway, it ain't no thing
Pulled it out and slapped in Dana Dane
Got to Aladdin's house and I honked my horn
He said, "When we comin back?" I said, "6 n tha morn"
So he got in the car, lookin half-dead
So I gave him my Cisco and took the 40 to the head
Now I'm feelin tipsy, and I'm headed for Watts
But wait, what do I see sittin at the bus stop?
Sexy Susanna, had a butt that kills
Pretty long hair, but they say it's not real
Aladdin yelled (these fake or real?) she threw a rock in my glass
So I got out my car and drop-kicked her ass
I checked out my window, everything was cool
She was lucky I was nice and I didn't act a fool

[ VERSE 4 ]
We finally arrived at the party, drunk as a jerk
Got out my car, pressed the kit so the alarm, would chirp
After that we made our way, I tried not to fall
Couldn't walk a straight line if they let me crawl
Got to the door, and what spots my eye?
My homeboy Mr. Prince, and he's smokin some Thai
So I stumbled his way and said, "Hey, pass the jay"
I took a hit for my mouth spray
This girl asked me to dance, but I told the ho no
Cause she was on my tip cause of my big gold rope
But it seems she got offended - that's splendid
Before she starts somethin, I just slap her and end it
Cause I feel like a gangster, and I just don't care
About a girl with fake drag, fake eyes, fake hair
Fake clothes, fake nails and all that fake jewelry
All she wanna do is tell her friends that she screwed me
I get nutty, act a fool when IIwant to
Run up when I'm drunk and I just might pump you
Take your car, your wife, keep talkin, your life
Beat you down and have you smokin the pipe
(You know why?) cause I'm cool

(Well, kill me!
Shoot me, muthafucka!)
(I gotcha)
(Oh goddamn)Yo nigga, let's go scoop up some of these hoes at the 'Paradise', man
Hey man, ah - I'm engaged now, man
What?
I'm engaged
To that bitch?
Aw man, don't be talkin about my woman like that
Oh, now you're gon' trip on me
Wait, wait, hold up, hold up

[ VERSE 1: King Tee ]
How you gon' go and put a ho before me?
When I'm the one that helped your broke ass on the streets
'Damn, I'm starvin, what you got to eat?
I'm short, I need a place to sleep'
Oh, but amnesia, that damn skeezer
Made you forget who was down witcha
I thought birds of a feather flock together
And don't a damn thing change but the weather
But now I know the real, I guess I had it all wrong
We used to hit the Ides until the shit was all gone
Where was she when you needed niggas off your ass
And who'd you come to get to go blast?
Not that once-a-month-bleedin, always on her knees
Suckin every Tom, Dick and Harry like a berry
I seen her with a trick at the Motel 6
And you still tryin to get that bitch Afro Fix
She got you by the nuts, playin with your wiener
Wrapped around her finger when the last time you seen her
Well, when you do, bust her lip
And if you don't, you'se a bitch
So sit down when you piss, muthafucka

(It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me) --] Deadly Threat

[ VERSE 2: Deadly Threat ]
The bitch got you gone, talkin on a phone
Tellin muthafuckas when you see me, it's on
But little do he know that she a zero
And I'm still her favorite superhero
See, I got the 411 on a ho
Just like I was tellin you before
You're just a piece of the mission
Guess where her lips been?
I told you don't be kissin, but you don't listen
[ King Tee ]
Yeah, Jaws (Jaws) Jaws the only ho I ever saw
That could suck a basketball through a straw
She don't like niggas with Nissan trucks
Unless they got the monster bumps
[ Deadly Threat]
That's right, honey, bunny's money-hungry
And she'll frame ya, she's out to getcha
Get the picture, cause the bitch'll
Take you for a long-ass ride like the hitcher
So don't be surprised if they find you in a ditch
With your guts hangin out lookin like Top Ramen
And when I see the bitch, I'm bombin
Cause she's a false tenderony, plus tossed balony
And she ain't your home, she's a ho
Don't put a ho before the homie

(Hey yo bitch, you better tell em) --] Ice Cube

[ VERSE 3: Ice Cube ]
Who's wearin the pants, who's wearin the pants, nigga?
If you ask me, I think that her dick is bigger
Than your little dick, and I'm tellin you, Jay
The bitch got you locked down like Pelican's Bay
Now I told you if you fuck with the ho
She's guaranteed to have you trippin
And me and you set-trippin
I told my muthafuckin crew
To kidnap the ho, and they came back with you
[ King Tee ]
I can't fade a nigga that's bitch-made
Kool-Aid pumpin, tell a bitch somethin
She'll have your ass cookin dinner
While she's lettin every nigga in her hood run up in her
[ Ice Cube ]
Got you runnin like Bruce Ginner, and the ho be
Pussy-whippin your ass like Toby
Now you act like you don't know me
Only a mark'll put a ho before the homies

Word - this muthafucka is different
Yeah
Tell me your secret
Not just any secret
Just answer one question for me, baby
Do you love me?
I love you
Very, very, very, very much
Baby
Can I come pick you up and take you shoppin?
Spend all my money...
I love you
I love you

Das EFX in this ya know what I'm sayin'?
Straight from the sewer, word is bond!
Yeah! We doing this with my nigga
Where my nigga? Ice Cube in the motherfucker
Word is bond!

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
You better check yourself before you wreck yourself
Cause I'm bad for your health, I come real stealth
Dropping bombs on your moms, fuck car alarms
Doing foul crime, I'm that nigga with your Alpine
Sold it for a 6-0, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got the indo
No I'm not a sucker, sitting in a House of Pain
And no I'm not the butler, I'll cut ya
Headbutt ya, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, punk motherfucka
Here to let you know boy, oh boy
I make dough, but don't call me Dough Boy
This ain't no fucking motion picture
A guy or bitch-a, I'll get wit'cha
And hit ya, taking that Yak to the neck
So you better run a check

[Hook: Das EFX and Ice Cube]
[Das] So come on and chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Yeah, come on and check yo self before you wreck yo self
[Ice]Cause shotgun bullets are bad for your health

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Tricks want to step to Cube and then they get played
Cause they bitch-made, pulling out a switchblade
That's kinda trifle, cause that's a knife, ho
AK-47 assault rifle
Hold the 50, I'm nifty, pow
I gotta new style, (Watch out now!)
I hate motherfuckers claiming that they're folding bank
But steady talking shit in the holding tank
First you want to step to me
Now your ass screaming for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row
Now they running up in you slow
You're gone, used to be the Don Juan
Now your name is just "Tuan"

Switchin', snappin', rolling your eyes and neck
You better run a check

[Hook]

[Ice Cube] Cause big dicks up your ass is bad for your health

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate
You could've had a V8
Instead of a tre-eight slug to the cranium
I've got 6 and I'm aiming em
Will I shoot or keep you guessing?
Cause fuck you and that shit you stressing
Bitch, get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighborhood hooker
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Giving up the claps and who needs applause?
At a time like this, pop the coochie and you're dead
The bitch is a Miami Hurricane hit
Sprung, niggas call her "Lips and Lungs"
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out

Cause women like you gets no respect
Bitch, you better run a check

[Hook]

[Ice] Cause bitches like you is bad for my health[Snoop Dogg]
Brothers is wack by popular demand
Chasin fame and girls livin they life on cruise control
But tell me; what do it profit a man
To gain a whole world livin trife but then lose his soul?
I'm here to wake my peoples up from they dreamin
Kill every demon and snakes that make, even feds steamin
Even though my star gleamin man my life ain't trouble-free
Homie take it from me, Snoopy D-O-double-G

[Hook: Stevie Wonder]
It's no better people who have left the problems of today
Leavin to conclude that for their life is not the way
But every problem has an answer, and if yours you cannot find
You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you piece of mind
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood
Heyyyyyyeahhhheyyyy

[Snoop Dogg]
So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed
Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong
Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have
As God blessed the child that can go get his own
And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feelin like this life is a trip
Tryin to keep our hearts pure through the sins
But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich
But to them they can endure to the end and win

[Hook: Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood... yeahhhheyyyy
{*scatting to a harmonica*}
Out here the only free psychiatrist, that's known throughout the world
Is fall in love by walks of all men and women, it's all boys and girls
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood

[Snoop Dogg]
Whether it's soldiers on the cell block or homies on the run
With God, man ain't no obstacles that you can't overcome

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood

[Snoop Dogg]
You're so frustrated, worryin 'bout your bread
And some mornings, you don't even wanna get out the bed

[Stevie Wonder]
When you lose too much too baaaaaaad

[S.W.] And I love you for what you sayin
[Dogg] God bless you

[Snoop Dogg]
And you can catch me down on my knees, askin' the Lord please
Even Jes' pray, hey, with difficulty comes ease
There's disease, poverty, congestion or oppression
I'm askin' for your protection and thanking you for your blessing
Confession is good for the soul, that's how I'm tryna roll
Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates now that's the goal
Until then, forgive my sin if that ain't askin too much
Now that's tabernacle, chuuuch!Artist: Snoop Doggy Dogg

Chorus:
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)
To a place that be, call it LBC
(I'm ridin' wit'cha baby)
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
To a place that be, call it LBC

1st Verse:
Now if you tired of the hard work
Tears and sweat
And you breakin' your neck
And you still up in debt
Walkin' round town all strapped in
Niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did
Two strikes none left, out of breath
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo
All this deception on top of stress
You havin' more problems than a algebra test
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent
And now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent
It's a thin line, between yours and mine
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime
Now I know a place where
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

Chorus

2nd Verse:
Oh your homies think you're funny?
Doin' stick ups for moneys
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack
You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat
You all about yo' money and got something to sell
But if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell
You chillin' wit yo' feet up
Someone hated but baby without the homies and
That's when you got beat up
Because you can't be out there doin' low
And then right gather up yo' crew and roll
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt
Somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt
But see, I know a place where
You might wanna be
And I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

Chorus

Bridge One:
Here ye, Here ye, come one, come all
To a place that be, call it LBC
(I'm ridin' wit' ya' baby)
Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick
Know what I'm sayin'?
Cuz he travelin' in the fast lane

Stop the life it seem that we are on
Time to slow your roll
Let Doggyland be your new home
Stop the life it seem that we are on
Time to slow your roll
Let Doggyland be your new home

Verse three:
Doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne
(It's goin' down)
Everything is free
And ain't no HIV. (What?)
And niggas don't kill one another
(Oh really why is that?)
Because a brother is a brother
(And what about the mothers?)
They queens
Righteous
Man
Heaven must be like this
Green aroma like the grass in the summertime
Ain't no peneteneries and ain't nobody doin' time
And oh yeah, I'm the big O-K'er
I'm smarter than the senator
Bigger than the mayor
Heaven on Earth
It's like a prayer
And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got
To be a player
Now you know a place where
You gots to be and I took you there
Pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

ChorusYou can't trust a big butt and a smile
No, that's the old style
In ninety one, shit ain't quite the same
Bitches got a brand new game, yo
It's kinda hard to see
But the dating game ain't what it used to be
Back in the day, if a ho wanted ya dough
She give you a piece of ass and there we go
Go and get knocked up and then get socked up
You be broke and locked up
But the new's done hit
Bitches all over on some new improved shit
To y'all macks
Come to find out that bitches are pullin jacks
I remember every night all you had to worry about
Was gettin caught at a red light
And the nigga jack you for your date and chains;
Now shit done changed
Cos you gots to watch the ones in the skirt
And it ain't about gettin burnt
I know it sounds strange, but could you
Stop thinkin with ya dick for a change
Cos you'll get a bullet in your brain, Mr Rich
And about that bitch, don't trust em

Chorus
(Ice Cube comin at'cha with a crazy pitch)
Don't trust no (Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!)
(Ice Cube comin at'cha with a crazy pitch)
You can't trust no (Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!)
*Repeat*

Here's how the bitches jack:
They try to catch a dumb nigga in the act
You came to the club

.

, stepped to the bar
And pulled out a wad of Doves
After you got buzzed, she walk by
You saw how big her ass was
Got her on the dancefloor
And she started dancin like a ho
Jimmy got stiff, she ain't have a ride home
So you gave the bitch a lift
She didn't wanna trouble you
But hopped her big ass in your BMW
Hopped to her house and started kissin
And Jimmy just wouldn't listen
Cos you got real horny
And that ain't cool at four in the morning
Started undressing the ho
Got to the drawers and the ho said "No!
"Not on the first date
"It's gettin kinda late, could you come back at eight?"
You said "Yeah!" cos you thought you met a wholesome ho
But nigga, she know you rollin in some dough
And you'll regret and somethin 'bout a bitch you just met
Don't trust em!

Interlude:
(scratching of BBD's 'Poison' and PE's 'Don't Believe The Hype')

Eight o'clock on the dot, nigga's hot
Dick hard as a rock
Straight on a solo
Creep
Can't wait till her little boy go to sleep
So you can seduce the G
Bust a nut and make an excuse to leave
You got her worked out cos you the man
But the bitch got diff'rent plans
She said "Take off your clothes, jump in the bed"
While she powder her nose
You get butt naked, cos you ready to wreck it!
Cos you's a motherfuckin pro, next thing you know
The door flies open with a blast
With four niggas in ski masks
Pointin a gun at the pimp
You're scared as a motherfucker and Jimmy done went limp
They beat you down just a taste
Take ya to your house and make ya open up the safe
Drove you far, tied up in the trunk of your own fuckin car
Take you out and pop the cap
I told you the bitch was a trap
Don't trust em!

Chorus[King Tee]
Get a taste of the heat while I burn down the streets
Time to recognize who wore the white sheets
Gafflin me up and I'm fightin cause they got me
Known as a King knowin what they did to Rodney
I know you know the deal, it's open season on my race
I'm black and I'm proud to be lootin in your face
But yet I'm real smart, cause see, it's a plan
To lock up and shut down the black man

[Yo-Yo]
Yeah, you can play that role like you ain't with it if you wanna
But it's on to the break of dawn
I said it's just 'a few good men' when we were fightin
I guess it'll be more good men now we're united
Now all of a sudden they wanna bring in troops
Niggas in my hood been gettin loose and buckin fools
But now we're gettin wiser, you can tell by the fires
That they're fed up, the war is on us

[MC Eiht]
What happened to the drive-by killings?
Ain't nothin poppin no more cause brothers now chillin
From every hood to block to corner to street
Not black-on-black, the other color gets beat
Mh, I guess it's time for brothers to turn the page and
Let out some rage and bang a Caucasian
Geah, MC Eiht got the pale face runnnin scared
Gang of blue, fuck the white, I'm down with the red

[B-Real]
Doin dirt, at the time I thought it couldn't hurt
So I became a jackin expert
Lootin, scootin uptown cause they're shootin up a clown
That fuckin pig in the blue suit
That pig, sow, buster-ass copper
Pointin my bazooka at your pork chopper
You passed me a lump just a month back
That's why I got my hand on the pump, jack

[HOOK 2x]
You can get with that, or you can get with this
You can get the boot, or you can get the fist

[J-Dee]
Heary heary, y'all come kick it, man
I never thought I'd see a thousand Crips in the Nickerson
Gardens, pardon my manners
I saw the Bloods and Crips wavin big black banners
Bandanas tied, straps on their side
Cause in the projects it was a lotta black pride
And I remember the time I couldn't answer my pager
Cause if you were slippin your enemy come and gauge ya

[KAM]
It's the KAM and Watts Up, damn, this is like a dream
It feels good, cause every hood is on the same team
Archrivals got the five-o's kinda nervous
They layin in the cut but I know they wanna serve us
And I'm certain it's hurtin Daryl Gates
He rather have a brother pressin California license plates
While the media gets greedier for ratings
It's 12 o'clock at night but I'm rollin gold Daytons
And it's cool cause ain't nobody trip but the cops
Deep jeep bass comin from the rag top

[Threat]
It took more than a letter to pull us black together
But that goes to show you, never say never
I seen the tape, I didn't have to see it twice
Never seen nothin like it in my life, 12 blind mice
Is this the end, where we begin
Makin friends with Mister Chen?
From the dirt to the streets to the avenues
Way, way deep, deep in the Zoo

[Ice Cube]
Would you believe
Not guilty, the filthy devils tried to kill me
When the news get to the hood the niggas will be
Hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust
Kickin up dust is a must
I can't trust a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a unicorn
Born wicked, Laurence Powell, foul
Cut his damn throat and I smile

[HOOK 2x]
You can get with that, or you can get with this
You can get the boot, or you can get the fist[2Pac - Speaking]
The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm taking back what's mine

[Slowed down voice]
You motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)
Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so God damn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-0) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost

[Hook x2: 2Pac]
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
A Mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(Hey man, come the fuck on)
And then we'll be ghost

[Hook]

FUCK THE POLICE NIGGA![ VERSE 1: Breeze ]
I'm goin through phases, wonderin what is expected of me
For the money or the girls to love me
For the juice, the clout or recognition
Nah, that's already an old tradition
Sometimes I think to myself and say why me
Waitin for a fool to step up and try me
Ain't as easy as it seems, looks are deceivin
You're steppin up and shuttin up, quick in believin
Not on a ego trip, just a phase I'm goin through
Which I like to express and share by showin a few
People just how bad it can get
You thought I couldn't get get with
But I came out to rip shit
You say that I'm soft because I'm hangin out west now
You suckers are silent because I'm showin the best how
You're sort of confused, you're lost, trapped inside a maze
Say that I'm trippin, nah, I'm just goin through a phase

[ VERSE 2: Breeze ]
Let me explain a phase for you in detail
It's adaptin or interactin to the rappin
Like a maze that I'm trapped inside in
Would I waste my fate? Well, rap is decidin
A lot of MC's seem to get weak
Times are changin, boy, change your technique
Whoever try to challenge the kid, I just mold em
Unlock the jock and stop ridin on my scrotum
To the point we have to get back to the
Topic, I'm more a Legend than a Acura
Servin up rhymes with a spatula
And biters, I choose to call em Dracula
Dispite all the conflict rap acts come with
You're addin and addin and it sums up to a drum riff
I don't rob or steal, I do whatever it pays
Rehearse a rhyme, then on to the next phase

[ VERSE 3: Breeze ]
If a MC on the mic is weak, stop the fella
Rock acapella so I can tell a
Sucker that I can get hotter than hell goes
You're tryin to flex, didn't know a chicken had elbows
Many phases and stages to my attitude
Act friendly to a foe and turn around and slap the dude
You mention doom from my rhymes you consume
I'm knockin you out like I was a volume
Tryin to act as if I was a friend of yours
I'm goin through a phase, you're goin through menopause
First you're Moe, then you're Kane, tomorrow you're RA...
You sound kinda funny, money (haha)
Rap is a gift and I refuse to lose it
Without a doubt it's somethin 'bout the music
You're sort of confused, you're lost, trapped inside a maze
Say that I'm buggin, nah, I'm just goin through a phase[Verse 1: J-Ro]

Pooh-butts play the rear cause I'm making papes
The rhymes ain't no thicker than a skittle grapes
A lot of girls would like to thank me for the hanky-panky
On the mic I hold the belt, now I know no one could spank me
It took a long time for the people to hear my rhymes
Seems like I been rapping since my birth in '69
Sorry to keep you waiting, I run rhymes like Walter Payton
I get around like spokes on a Dayton
But I won't knock off, because I just rock off
The beats to get funky, like when you take your sock off
To all the white folks I would like to say, "Howdy"
And to all my brothers I say please quit acting rowdy
Wack MCs in ninety-two, ew you need to take a rest
The public don't you aim the best you're softer than a hookers chest
Raps, I make em, snaps, I make em
For duties moving booties cause I shake shake shake em
And I got rhymes, funky funky rhymes
E-Swift hold the needle down with nickels and dimes
I drink Olde English, St. Ides and Mickeys
When it's time to roll I throw on my black Dickies
On the mic I get wicked, like Wilson Pickett
I get the place jumping like a cricket when I kick shit
I'm from the West coast but don't sleep home-stimpy
Even if I was a paperboy you still couldn't rip me
I walk up and chalk up pairs like the Knicks
I'm all in the mix like snares and kicks
When it comes to rhymes I get loose like belt buckles
Those who chose to oppose this nose is felt knuckles

[Hook]
(Where you going to?) To the tip
(And what cha bout to do?) Bout to rip
Some people use the word funky too loosely
And just how many rappers say they kick it like Bruce Lee
(What's your favorite brew?) Olde E
(And what it make you do?) Go pee
It used to be about rhymes, all about rhymes
Now rappers rearranging and changing like times
I got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all
When it comes to the pen and the pad y'all
I got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all
When it comes to the pen and the pad y'all

[Verse 2: E-Swift]
Back the fuck up, give me room to breathe
Not too many niggas can flip the rhymes like these
I freak the technique as if it was a bitch
Got more soul than the pick with a fist
Pitch the ball, so I can beat it with the bat
Talk some shit, so I can smoke ya with my gat
I'm feeling kinda feeling kinda feeling kinda feeling kinda
Feeling kinda buzzed off a sack of chocolate Thai
My my my ho, I like to rip the shows up
Smack the hoes that walk around with they nose up
Run to the liquor store, before they close up
Buy a few 40s, cause daily I get to' up
Sit at the crib and write riggy-riggy-rhymes
Line after line after liggy-liggy-line
Yo I can get funky, buy my tape and bump me
To the break of dawn I hit the bud and pass it on
Hanging at the park, shooting craps on the weekend
My brown bag is wet cause my tall can is leaking
Staring at the cops, beating up on Rodney
While a pack of O.G.'s stepping to me trying to rob me
Just because I'm dope, niggas wanna smoke me
On the mic I get funky while you're doing the hokey-pokey
Dance steps, I think that you should leave to Paula
Alkaholiks is the shit, E-Swift's the smooth baller
Is slangin' these rhymes like a rock
Life ain't shit but money and a Glock
Don't punch a clock, but I clock a fat knot
So I can smoke a lot of pot that I roll up with tops
And ya ain't heard shit yet, I'm just gettin warm
Like hot butter on say what? The popcorn
I'm headed to the top, please give me my props
My beats are fat as fuck so bump my shit in your box
I love to hit the skins, but then again who doesn't?
I love to hit the herbs cause it leave me feeling buzzing
I dedicate this chumpie to the poets who can wreck
And to all the natty dreads I gots to give them nuff respect

[Hook]

[Verse 3: King Tee]
Up jumps the man with the loot
Rocking like a troop with the Alkaholik group
Everything is kosher, got a little taller
Living kinda phat cause King Tee's a baller
I just irritate the wack, leave em so confused
When I'm checking on the mic with the ones and twos
Sneak you a peek of the drunk technique
Can't stand up, need to take a seat
Baby baby baby it's the Alkaholiks
But I can freak the mic no matter how ya call it
Metaphors grand, and I'm the great man
Drink a whole fifth yes I can, yes I can can
The girls call me dick-em-down
Got that title rocking for the crown
Catch y'all later, around next weekend
I'm a Alkaholik and I'm late for my meeting[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
This is a DJ Whoo production
In conjunction with Doggystyle Records and 213

[Verse 1: Warren G]
I need a ride or die groupie that can get dirty in Gucci
On the floor of the hoopty while she loving me up
I'm usually the instigator
But ain't nothing greater
Than a X-rater with a nickname like vibrator
I need to do a remix to "Area Codes"
I..got..ho-oooes and plenty mo'
The way it kicks on time is out of control
So when my nigga Snoop Dogg comes and kicks the door

[Snoop Dogg]
When I walk up in the door
You best to know it's pimping on the whole
213 gets the crunk for sure
And they know about us everywhere we go

[Warren G]
And where the groupies at

[Hook: Nate Dogg & (Snoop Dogg)]
I was just about to call
'Till Snoop Dogg told me that he boned
'Till Warren G told me he rolled
(I told you she's a grooouuuppp)
Hoooooeeeee!!!

Nate Dogg in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
Snoop Dogg in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
Warren G in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
(213 all in your face and we trying to find)
Groupie Love

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Looking for a chick
That love that West Coast gangster shit
Yeah girl if you think that you're the one
Let's go and have ourselves some fun
You ain't got a bring nothing at all
Just enjoy the adventures of the Dogg
I heard you like my smile
My rap, my pimp, my style
Well it's on you what it do
You got to let Nate hit it too
'Cus when we come to your town
Rule is pimps up, draws down

[Warren G]
And where the groupies at

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
My fast scheme on them
We can tag team on them
That's what we need to do
Just me, G and you
It's cool when I'm seeing you
Get ready for a nine inch dick, me and the D in you
I know you don't want to miss this
Some classic LBC, 213 shit
We in your city get busy 'till you get dizzy
Trying to find all our fans
To load them up in our vans

[Warren G]
We hate to end the show
But there's a lot of groupies at the door
Another everyone to take a see
All aboard and launch 213
And where the groupies at

[Hook][Produced by DJ Pooh]

[Verse 1]
Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinking will I live another 24
I gotta go cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm asking y'all
"Which park are y'all playing basketball?"
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexing, didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watching "Yo! MTV Raps"
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas and watch me break 'em
With the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7 even back door Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yelling domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion, hit the 3-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
2 in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp"
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I got to say it was a good day

[Outro]
Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit. What the fuck am I thinking about?‚Äù[Intro: DJ Drama & Pharrell]
See it's funny right?
I had a real good day yesterday
And then today, I had an even better day
'Sup L.A? Haha
But the thing is, AMG we signed another deal today
Skateboard P
So tomorrow is gon' be great

[Verse 1]
Yo
Me and a few shorties
Landed on a tour, met Paris Hilton right before me
Long Beach, where skinny niggas carry strong heat
And take giant steps like King Kong's feet

[Break]
It's Gangsta Grillz ya bastards

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]
I'm in the Bourbon, the window's down I'm feelin' fervent
Where palm trees and trash clash, I'm so observant
Got my connections to I-C-E
So no matter what sets we on it's like TV
The, bitches got hay fever
Their face turn red because they say "Hi" with their eyes, but I'm not a hay reader
This ain't a game and there ain't no play meter
I can read her mind and, it says "Feed her"
We go to [?] where it ain't a lot of people
Where they look at your watch, and proper they will treat you
Me and my niggas toast we seen the best of the boats
Next year in Aspen, we gon' ski the rest of the slopes
Mind your business that's just a note
And don't be flexin' your coat 'less you expect to flow
That ain't no threat, and it's less than a joke
These niggas mark men, marksmen professional
The fumble jungle where baking soda dressed to coke
And uphill addicts watch their skin just float
Huh, but today was a good day

[Verse 3]
In my chain I got the pink Laffy Taffy
The white Laffy Taffy
The blue Laffy Taffy, the yellow is so flashy
But it wasn't always like this exactly
Niggas laughed at me the bitches treated me nasty
I was a backpacker, now the gat-grabber
The only elevation seemed like the crack ladder
But then I heard Del, and the Hieroglyphics
And The Pharcyde and the Tribe "Can I Kick" shit
Got my backpack, started raisin' my knees
Stompin' in place while my niggas makin' G's
Rapping to myself man, even making beats
And the milli's keep my chilly man I keep makin' heat
I'm like ovato, you ain't takin' sheet
And since I was about 9 I've been skating please
Now I'm in the hills with some US Magazine ho
Tellin' me to call her on ICECREAMs and dream clothes
Game like a tendril, money like a spin wheel
And retarded is my pencil don't give the nigga one-inch hell
Goyard, I rock Goyard, "What's that?" Oh god
I deal with LV, but that's so hard
But I stick with LV cause I get it no charge

[Outro]

Yessir[King Tee]
Now step up, to the King Tee's beer stand
And let me know what beer is grand
No, no, wait, I got somebody that might convince ya
Hold up, hold up, wait

[Ice Cube]
Once again it's on, I'm going out the front door
Ice Cube in the glass house, headed for the store
To get a beer that's better than the rest
The S-T-Period-I-D-E-to-the-S
And it'll put hair on your chest
In the black can, so won'tcha grab a six pack and
Get your girl in the mood quicker
Get your jimmy thicker, with St. Ide's Malt Liquor

[King Tee]
Hold up, hold up
So when you get a forty, roll to the spot
Hug and kiss your girl and screw the cap off the top
And get a taste of the beer that makes you tingle
And just remember that jingle

[Singers]
Here's something that's sweeping the nation by surprise
It's that fabulous malt liquor they call St. Ide's"There are a few things I wanna explain to you..
And I'll try to define, to the best of my ability"

"Mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"

"I'ma tell you one more thing;
And won't tell y'all nothin else"

"Mama.."

[Yo-Yo]
Growin up was crazy, in my days we got our ass kicked
Mama didn't play no ? cause talkin back is foul play
She had her own way of gettin across, which was a belt of steel
She'd tell us from the work we could all but kneel
Gettin nasty in front of guests was the way she'd like to do it
She'll say straighten your shit up, or you can stop em from comin
And yo guys knew what time it was, even they was checked
I got a down ass mama ("that's right") mama don't take no mess
Now shit got hectic, cause mama was tipped
She'll tell you in a minute don't let your mouth get yo' ass whipped
Mama did it all by herself, King and Queen of this house
Yellin, "I want my Daddy" would get your ass thrown out
Now when it came to partyin, moms got wild
Don't nuttin get old but clothes, and they come back as styles
("that's right.. that's right") Yo, I got a down ass mama

"Mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!" "Can you dig it?"

[Yo-Yo]
Beings it was all girls, shit was always missing
From panties to makeup, if it was gone then she was bitchin
She wants to know, "Who's been in the house?" I said no company
Checkin her dresser sayin, "What happened to my money?"
If it was on then it was on, cause money don't walk
Somebody better talk, find the stuff she done lost
I got my butt whooped for everything I did wrong
And it was ON, cause niggas kept playin on my phone
Don't let moms go to a conference and the teacher confess
Man I'm tell you, mama don't take no mess
Why watch me go down, fight to keep it goin
But really not knowin cause the truth is what they're showin
You don't have a friend, friends come and go is what she'll say
Never tell your deepest secret, you'll get hurt that way
Love is a game, and it's okay if you play
But they're dogs dressed as men, tryin to be your friend
And baby watch out, don't take a step unless you know which way you're goin
Times are gettin lonely but I'll be a honey
I'll never leave ya, believe that love is in the air
No matter what you done, moms'll be there
I got a down ass mama

"Mama don't take no mess!"

"Because I'm aware that you have to use what you have
To get what you want. This is the reason I'm asking
You to tighten up your shit. Be proud of your black
Body and use it. That's your natural gift, so girls
Use it. But you got to get yo' shit together!"

"Mama don't take no mess!"

"I'm beggin you please do like I told you"

[Yo-Yo]
Moms, didn't play the okey-doke, oke can get choked, huh
Fuck around and get yo' neck broke
Tellin your friends, "Hold up, wait man, moms'll let me go"
Walk in the house and mom straight say NO!
The type of moms to whup you in the store if she hasta
Just to let you know, you're the child, she's the master
Livin it to the fullest, playin 40 like she's 20 y'know
Some old tricks from a young pro
Brought up in a church house, and every Sunday was a must
When moms couldn't make it, we rode the church bus
Don't say you couldn't fade it, cause that was plannin yo' week
No church, no runnin the streets G! ("That's right")
We didn't neglect our chores, that was number one
For thirty on the dot, we was on the run
She used to pull up at the dance, have the DJ to call us out
After two o'clock, wasn't no hangin out
Sometimes she waited in the batterram or stood at the front do'
People used to ask what she came fo'
Hell wasn't nuttin get close, moms was loc, no joke
("Right on!)" I got a down ass mama

"Mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"

"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!" "Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"

"Get them drive-by shooters out of my living room
And off my couch. You know we expecting company!"

"Is that it? I gotta go."
"HELL NAW THAT AIN'T IT!"[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yo B (turn your speakers up man)
Turn your speakers up money!
Yo God! (Yo God?)
Yo I got mad skills
Isn't that money?

New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
It's the incredible, the lyrical
You can't be me like Niecey, to see me is gonna take a miracle
I'm driving motherfuckers hysterical, with a
Touch of this twister, stylistic mixture
What I create pulsates, there is no escape
Annihilate your mental mindstate
Dre labels my vocabulary abusive
I packs more knowledge than Confucius, I'm deadly
Induce you like Medusa, with thoughts to shed
And niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near
Prepare, catch me chillin' like the winter
Up against the number one contender, as I enter
Cause I gets heated like friction
Motherfuck your whole jurisdiction, react this fact not fiction
Telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital
Dangerous and vital to all my rivals
Suicidal, brainwaves conveys
To the average motherfucker's minds these days
I'm all ready to put work in
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirking
Give a FUCK, what's your name, what you claim
Or why you came, motherfucker
Don't explain
Simply, don't tempt me, cause I'm simply
Leavin hoes lives empty, the invincible MC

[Hook: repeat 2x]
New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound
Too much, I serve too many people, too much
It's too much, I serve too many people
And when I finish servin ain't gon be no sequel

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Gimme a couple G's, for every MC, I knocked to his knees
Verbally useless, oh you got the juice? I squeeze you juiceless
The barbaric, versatile, you're no kin to me
So how the fuck you inherit my style?
Now, out the clear blue sky, I can't deny
Not a day goes by, don't get high, don't ask why
Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones
Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis
Gets me into verbally vindictive
Violent vocabulary bobs to existence
Catch me in the pitch black path
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental
Till I hear an instrumental
And detrimental verbals get to spittin
The highest in intellect, try connectin with the written
Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war
Dips like a low-low, with my verbal fo'-fo'
The cocoa complexion MC with the slow flow
Fo sho', I takes it to you from the do'
Motherfucker, mentally I go hardco' (you know!)
I disconnect ya, Kurupter, MC to vocally
Void your whole molecular, structure
Catastrophic, mystic as Mixelplix
Hittin MC's like dicks the deadliest lyricist

[Hook]

[Kurupt]
We live... tonight I serve two thousand MC's

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Eryday, I bust rhymes and recite
In ways that make MC's stop in daylight
I'm the deadliest MC you wanna see on the streets
Invincibility is what makes
Me complete, compete
Nah you can't even fade me
I fuck, you, your momma, your auntie, and your lady...
*bzzt to static*[Intro: King Tee]
King Tee's drunk again...Yo, check this out: awww shit, aw shit, I
Wanna dedicate this song to all them motherfuckers out there that-that-that-
That-that-that-that (not again) perpentratin'...perpetratin'... perpin'
Tratin'. Wait, rewind. (eh but yo...King Tee, man, what is this? What is
This?)

[Verse 1: King Tee]
Some cool shit for the King's anthology
And when I'm done, don't expect no apology
Stupid motherfuckers shoulda stepped when I warned 'em
I'm from the Boondocks of Compton, California
I'm just anxious to whoop some ass
I went to high school, but I flunked every class
So what makes you think I give a fuck about respect?
I'll put your bitch in check, and I'll bet
You won't run up, son of a punk and a bitch, too
I shoulda did a drive by on you and your crew
Cuz ya'll be poppin' some shit that's unheard of
For you, what's the word? Uh...(wack!)...it's murder, son
When I be crushin' your hood with a passion
And I ain't talkin' that Action Jackson
When I come you better run for ammo
Or get played like a fuckin' piano...

And yo, we got my homeboy Ice Cube in the house from the motherfuckin'
Lench Mob ('Sup, nigga?), and yo Ice Cube, I heard you're a singer now
Man what's up? Yo, yo...

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Do-Ray-Me. But I don't sing, mothafucker
I kick shit with the King, mothafucker
Ice Cube will clock the cash, rock the mass
And if you run up, I'll sock your ass
And watch that eye get swollen
Cuz I'm playin' punk niggas like Beethoven
So bust a cap or swing and die
Fuck Yul Brynner, it's still The King and I
Cuz where I'm from the sun don't shine
So One-Time hope I only bust one rhyme
But I bust one more for the suckers
Last year I was Ruthless, now I'm Lenchin' mothafuckers
And you'll see in a tree, MCs and crews
Now they're lookin' for me, King Tee, and Pooh
Now every nigga that crossed me's soprano
Cuz I played their ass like a fuckin' piano...

[King Tee] Yo, check this out, we got my homeboy Breeze in the
Motherfuckin' house from the L.A. Posse, and he got some shit to holler. Come
On, man, bust this shit

[Verse 3: MC Breeze]
Well, I'm-a take the mic like it was a jack move
Run with the beat as long as the track moves
Hot as lava, organized like a seminar
Serve you, your crew, him, and them and a
Couple of rap-saps who think they can get butt
You slipped and shit, so nitwit, just get the nuts
Stealin' your high hopes, watchin' you write notes
Better walk a chalk line, not fuckin' a tightrope
Rap slicker, thicker, quicker than others, then I stop swift
Shift from 1st to 5th, while you stop to shoplift
Take the mic stand whenever the duty calls
If I bust a nut for every rhyme I had, I'd get blue balls
Serious as drama, I'm-a watch her say "Me too."
You're shorter than Michu, your rhymes are see-through
You're nothin' like GQ, transparent, I made it apparent
I'm here to wax and tax the incoherent
Cuz B-R-E-E-Z-E will eas-i-ly re-main to be-e a top MC
When you see me, I wear a beanie, and not a Kangol
Now you got played, like a fuckin' piano

[Verse 4: King Tee]
This is just a sample of three black nig-roes
Who grew up in the heart of the ghetto
Doin' what we had to just to make ends meet
Some steal for a livin', some stand on the street
Just slang. Some gang-bang, but big deal
They say in Compton, you gotta kill or get killed
Mothafuckin' police pull ya over, slam ya down
Then tell ya that your hood is their town
And I ain't goin' for no shit like that;
Cuff me up, take me to jail, I'll come back
Talkin' much shit, cuz I talk what the fuck I feel
A few weeks in the county ain't no big deal
So a punk like you can't fuck with me
That big ballin'-ass nigga named King Tee
You think ya can? I don't think that you can, though
Peace to Ice Cube and Breeze, and the fuckin' piano
