[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Is this the top? Uh
I got my own weed, sucker, so I ain't gotta hit yours
I'm talking straight indo
Cali weed blowing like a Rastaman
Kush seed straight from Afghanistan
Shooting up the club like an AK, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow
Smoke a P strong every day, I'm

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
I need it all the time, don't know what else to say
It's always on my mind, that's why every day
I'm blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Put it in a joint, not a blunt
Don't disrespect mine, player
This not the two, this the one
Don't even need a scale
Back in high school I used to be the weedman
Quarter ounces, half ounces, what you need, man
Eleventh grade, made my way up to a P, man
And sent it back if I ever seen a seed, man
And you don't even gotta ask
You know it by the smell
I treat every day like it's a payday
Top down, counting up the cake and

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I got KK in my pipe, pockets fat like Kelly Price
If you wanna take a hit you can't be afraid of heights
You gon' need some new lungs, roll me up a blunt-a-thon
While I'm smoking out the bong getting sucked like a thumb
Boy I’m in a daze, tangerine haze
I smoke so much KK they should've called it Juicy J
Bombay and lemonade, weed get the lemon taste
Never hit the bong, let me demonstrate

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Go and roll it, chief and choking, marijuana, reefer smoking
Trap the semi sum under Reggie, foot up in his colon
Call the doctor, call the clinic, bullshit we staying with
Your life ain't worth a motherfuckin' quarter but you payin' with it
Khalifa kush a hundred pounds, that's a half a mil
Memphis streets so eat this like a baby, like Enfamil
Lungs full of KK, have your mind on a runway
Blow my high, motherfucker, I'mma shoot up like an AK

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
My white house higher than Willie Nelson, on dabs the wax is melting
These clouds are smoking, help me, I'm flying like Elroy Jetson
I might bring a dispensary down in Tennessee
Whole pounds of grandaddy, but he ain't no kin to me
(I’m staying with the greens, like collard)

[Hook]

[Outro: Juicy J]
Blowing Khalifa Kush (x4)[Intro]
Bun B: You ol' pussy-ass, cake-ass, punk-ass, trick-ass, sucker-ass, fuck-ass, dick-in-the-booty-ass, K-Y Jelly-packing-ass nigga
You better get your bitch ass up off the street, nigga
You got five seconds to get your hating ass up outta here, (Pimp C: Pouring up and showing up, bitch) cause it's some trill-ass niggas in this motherfucker
DJ Paul: Yeah, nigga, y'all know the motherfucking sco', y'all non-snorters, non-smokers, non-sippers, get the fuck up out of here, bitch
Bun B: Nigga, it's some sipping-ass, pouring up-ass, smoking-ass, getting high-ass niggas in here, Three 6, UGK, nigga, we putting it down in this motherfucker
DJ Paul: And we ain't playing witcha, y'all know the motherfucking sco', homie
Bun B: Now pour it up, nigga

[Hook: Project Pat]
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip (x8)

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I'm trill working the wheel, a pimp, not a simp
Keep the dope fiends higher than the Goodyear Blimp
We eat so many shrimp, I got iodine poisoning
Fuck niggas make me sick with all that pinching and bargaining
You say that you a boss, I ain't believing that shit
You got the funny Geneva watch, with the Ferrari kit
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
I got the red promethazine, thick orange, and yellow tuss
Hydrocodone on the hands-free phone
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
If you got sixteen, you can get a bizzerd
I'm choking on that doja sweet and sipping on that sizzurp

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Niggas scared to flaunt it, some niggas, they want it, want it
Some niggas, they joning, joning, but I be fucked up up on it
We're with the Mafia 6, and we ain't 'bout that bullshit
If we gon' get high, we gon' get high, and we gon' house a bitch
Two niggas all at the mouth, two niggas all at the ass
And plus, that syrup have a nigga dick hard all night and she cool with that
She popped her a pill of X, and drank on some orange juice
And just when you thought she was freaking, she done got super loose
Niggas come in by threes and deuces, all in circles like duck-duck-goose
All that want it can bone it, she on that X and that tootie fruit
Forty dollars for just one ounce ounce, plus
Tussionex is how it's pronounced
Niggas sipping and dipping and tripping, man, I'm 'bout all out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
People always asking me, is the Three 6 high on that?
Rolling on them X pills, stuttering, pup-pup powder packs
Woah-wuh where the weed at, ain't like that we need that
NyQuil will slow me down, something that keep me easy
Nothing like that yella yella, that'll have you itching, man
Talking like, what's up, fool? Vocal chords sounding lame
In my days, all we did was chief out on a quarter pound
Gone on coke, eyes all bucked, this here shit'll knock you down
Knock you out, make you fall asleep when you're on them wheels
Ain't no doubt, hit me when I beep for this refill
Once again, on my weekly high, gotta have that drank
Yeah, my nig, y'ain't know? I feel like I'm gonna fucking faint

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Nigga, tell me what you know 'bout Frank, Nito, and Young Guido
Paul and Vito, we play a tune that's sweeter than Pedito
With my Three 6 niggas pouring up in my southern credo
Quick, fast, we'll put it on your ass like John Bido
Cause you fronting rap sangers, be creamy like a Zanger
You ain't from the manger, boy, but you gets the middle finger
Humdanger, rum dranker, occasionally take
Your bitch to the telly and be a dick and cum slanger
When Big Bun come danger, nigga, ring your alarm
Sexy thang on my arm, cup of drank in my palm
And that crazy shit, I'm tripping on some skinny bitches
Something that's wholesome, Florida to Folsom
For the most, I'm steady sipping on some sizzurp

[Hook][Hook: TY Dolla Sign]
Bend it over for daddy
Gon' look back at it
Don't hide that pussy
Oh you know I like it when you
Twerk it on dick, twerk it on dick
Girl twerk it on dick, girl twerk it on dick
Twerk it on dick, gon' twerk it on dick
Oh twerk it on dick, gon' twerk it on dick
Girl twerk it on dick, twerk on dick
Gon' twerk it on dick

[Verse 1:Project Pat]
I like the way that booby jump like a brawl
I like the way you walk that ass like a dog
I like the way you keepin'  that pussy on call
You like the way I spend that money at the mall
Corn bread ass, soft like Jiffy
Got my dick hard [?]
Only chase money, we ain't chasin' no kitten
But I work that mouth out, drop down gimme fifty
Sippin' black remy, riding in black Porsche's
Kiki and Becky, black in white fortress
Tonight they be mine, tomorrow they yours
Loud in my blunt, kick hard like horses

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
You a good girl, hell nah
Scared of the hood girl, hell nah
Scared to get high girl, hell nah
On that dick, scared to ride girl, hell nah
Scared of a fast car, hell nah
Like a Nascar, hell nah
You want a broke nigga, hell nah
Shit if you broke, what you doing hell for
I be be throwing hella money on these bitches
Makin' it rain, you niggas looking hella sunny little bitches
Rich niggas wearing, fuck niggas hate
Go and throw it on me, it'll go away

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
I said twerk it on that bitch
Working with a grip
I'm on yo magic carpet, put a turban on my head
Oh c'mere you pretty little chick
I'ma get inside and work, like a surgeon in this bitch
Dude she throw that thang in the boot
[?]
Now lemme take a look it in your pack
This is a googly moogly that thang is juicy
Suicide pullin' up, who is y'all on the bus
Super high got them inside the whole crowd rolling up
Who am I Olubowale
Like I'm part lamb party
Yo I'm outta here

[Hook][Hook: Juicy J]
I hear em talking, money make a hater madder than a bitch
Got my check up, now you know I get more cash than a bitch
Got a pocket full of paper and a bad yellow bitch
Ass fatter than a bitch
My car faster than a bitch
What you saying, make em madder than a bitch
What you saying, get more cash than a bitch
What you saying, got a bad yellow bitch
Ass fatter than a bitch, my car go faster than a bitch

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
A hunnid billion dollars, that's the conversation
Nigga I got more whips than a dominatrix
Pretty bitch jump on my dick, lemme drive ya crazy
And you heard that my paper thicker than the yellow pages
Press that button lose the top, make it disappear
Its so lonely at the top, but I love it here
Pass that cream bitch I'm higher than Apollo 13
On that purple martini and a ounce of blue dream
So much money, make the counter blow a fuse
Live in the fast lane and fuck all the rules
I'm living on the edge, fuck a hater, fuck the feds
If I  buy more ice, I might need to buy a sled

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Smoking loud, drinking hen, man I'm higher than a bitch
Lick harder than a bitch
Wanna stick it in a bitch
Ferragamo louis shit
All designer in this bitch
I got gold on my teeth and neck, I'm shining as a bitch
Bitch love to see this shit, niggas mad than a bitch
Throw a cop in the parking lot, just shot him bout a bitch
I ain't tripping bout you man, I'm on dead presidents
All my niggas killas and they scared of the penitent-ions
Money always make a broke nigga mad,  make him envy
Never bowing down to a bitch, it ain't amendment
Lamborghini cost a ticket and I'm tryna rob that bitch
Pat your running up the check, we ain't tryna hit that shit

[Spoken Interlude: Pimp C]
You wanna say something about the pimp?
Gimme his address bitch I'ma come to his house
If they can feel that, then they can feel whats really going on down here right now mane
I'm glad we got an outlet where we can air these bitch ass niggas out
Know what Im talking about?

[Verse 3]
I can go broke any minute, still making 4 million in an hour
Closing deals with the cartel on my speakerphone in the shower
My bitch want that sour
You niggas is cowards, get the fuck off of my lawn
I'm cutting the grass with them choppas
Bullets is sounding like do-do-do-do hitting niggas and flowers
I don't fly jets, I buy jets
I'm from the low rise, high ground, projects
Fuck you and your street cash, little ass pub check
You sign niggas, I sign niggas, I buy the label
I'm in the Soho House in the library, eating sushi with Cung Le
Getting throwed from your politician, this ho wanna elect me
Still a hood nigga tryna fuck everything
Life in the villa, getting zarilla, nigga
Think of my scrilla
Keeping my wolves on deck like Michael on Thrilla[Hook]
Now every since I could remember I been poppin' my collar
Poppin', poppin' my collar, poppin', poppin' my collar
Every since I could remember I been working these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand

[Project Pat]
I know you sicker than sick-ahh
When you see the rims flick-ahh
Paint drip off
Ice in my Range glitt-ahh
I straight flippa
The cheese like pancake
Foldin' my cheese like the leaves
In my hand bricka?
Project Pat-ter
Attracted to dime pieces
I'm dirty southern
French braids, gold teeth
I'm out here makin' sense
Plus, I'm out here makin' dollars
I keep a bad broad, though
And a popped collar

[Hook]

[DJ Paul]
Now when it comes to getting bread I got the keys to the bakery
A lot of dudes swear they play, man they some fackery
Let me catch a girl up out some work in my site
And believe I'm gon be atcha in the daylight with a flashlight
I'm tryin to get paid however money is made
A lot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid
But me, I ain't no pimp, I just love to borrow
Paper from a fat bitch, a ugly bitch, a model fa real

[Juicy J]
Well you know me by the Juice man hangin out with Big Triece
Standin on tha porch, drinkin liquor, drunk, smokin' weed
Trying to get a paycheck, but work that ain't came yet
Thats why I stay in a girl ear, to keep that pussy wet
So I could get paid and relax in the shade
And say fuck a nine to five cuz a nigga tired of slavin
It's never easy for a playa in tha hood on tha come up
If I meet a gal with three kids or more she get done up

[Hook]

[Crunchy Black]
She's just another ho that I met in the hood
I told her I was Crunchy Black and it was all good
She might as well go on head and suck on my wood
And let me whisper something in her ear if I could
I got some hoes out there bringin ya boy back some good
That ghetty green you know what I mean that bitch is understood
Ain't havin to shout at no motherfuckin slut
You know I'm actin bitch make cut a fuckin rug
You better get out there and get my money in the woods
I'mma hit cha in ya head and leave ya ass with a plug
You know I gotta have, gotta get my money what
These hoes out here be fucking for a muthafucking dub, FREAK BITCH!

[Hook][Intro: Juicy J]
(Mafia, mafia... mafia, mafia...)
Once again, you do wrong, wrong will follow
That's real shit, real spit nigga, you know the business

[Hook: Juicy J]
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
What ya sayin nigga? What ya sayin nigga?
What ya sayin nigga? Naw, what ya sayin nigga?
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yea, I tell you one time, don't play with my bread
Nigga, you do, they gon' find yo ass dead
Body in trunk, hands tied to yo legs
Tape on yo mouth, a hole in yo head
Fronted some dope, now the nigga in debt
How you gon' pay that? Nigga don't sweat
Goons on deck - you know what's next
Send 'em to yo house, now it's time to collect
Now you in a box, nigga - cause and effect
Hollow points and buckshots, all in yo neck
Told ya 'bout playin' with a nigga like that
Now yo fam gon' visit you, payin' they respects
Tell ya one time, don't play with my money
Sold all my dope, now you run around stuntin'
All in the mall, spendin' money on ya woman
Nigga must think he don't owe me nothin'
Nigga must think I forgot about mine
He pressed 'ignore' when I called his line
I'mma play it cool like everythin' fine
Catch him comin' home, lay him down with the 9

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Yo, bang bang, shoot 'em up, Memphis niggas don't give a fuck
Run up on ya in broad day, pull them guns out, shoot ya up
Loose ya life over light green, kill a nigga over soft white
You ain't from here, don't come here and if you do, better walk light
Out here is a nightmare, homicides, not Freddy Krueger
Niggas ain't got shit to lose, shoot it out like a Western movie
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
These niggas ain't wearin' no mask and these niggas ain't wearin' no glove
These niggas don't, fight no mo', fuck takin' the high road
Lil' homie 'bout 16, bust a gun with his eyes closed
Fuck with all that gangsta talk, know you ain't bout that life
Pull that heater on yo ass, bet you come up off that ice

[Hook]

[Bridge]
(North Memphis, North Memphis
North Memphis, North Memphis...)

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Fifty shots clear this bitch out like a tornado
Two choppas who identical - call 'em Kane and Abel
Very fatal, dippin' in stash like a soup ladle
Rolled up on him, shot him in his head - busted tomato
You niggas get high on this shit, like to hold ya' nuts
Shotgun blast to ya stomach, bitch, hold ya guts
You say you gang affiliated, extra clips tough
And when the bullets get to poppin', they don't give no fucks
Money rules everything, and we got the cash
Pay yo homies one bag to blow up yo ass
Kidnap ya from ya residence, no mask no lie
F.B.I. found ya body in Project dumpster, BFI[Intro: Rick Ross]
Hood Billionaire
Nigga need that quinine
I'm making more with the baking soda, don't hate on me
You know where I'm at though

[Hook 1: Rick Ross]
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the dog food, the soft nigga and the hard
You can tell them crackers they can go and get the dogs

[Hook 2: Rick Ross]
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD
Riding down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the boy, got the girl and I got the heart
Tell them pussy crackers they can bring the dogs

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I got Priscilla, I got Priscilla
I got vanilla, boy, I got vanilla
I been that nigga, I been that nigga
I bend that corner, I'm stacking scrilla

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My face familiar, my face familiar
Half a milli for the whip, this bitch'll hurt your feelings
I could fly Priscilla, send her in the mail
She got Meek Milly cellphone in the county jail
I'm at the car wash off on Elvis Presley BLVD
That needle hit your vein, your ass gon' holla ''good God''
You feel that itch, you feel that itch
That heroin moving fast, boy, I'm getting rich

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Run up in the trap, I push the panic button
Lil' 'Toine snorting coke, he ain't scared of nothing
Bumping Playa Fly until a player die
Charged 'em for the nine gram, but I gave em five
My baking soda fine, I'm baking over dimes
I got them brown bags, I bet they know it's mine
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD
Can I park an airplane in a nigga yard?

[Hook 2]

[Verse 4: Project Pat]
Crushing them sleepin' pills up, I'm steppin' on the dope
Bringing down a half a thing, mane, get these puppies off
Hard work pays off, get more if you selling soft
Catch you slipping out here though, my dog, we knock your melon off
Memph-ghanistan, shoot them rifles long like African
Got them young boys shooting shit up like Africans
Me gold in me mouth, 'round my neck like leprechaun
Lamborghini or Ferrari, watch these bitches come
Stacking funds off the drugs, me go quick to rob the plugs
Nigga mouth was full of slugs, left these bodies full of slugs
Met me on the south side of the city with the whole thing
Iced 'em with the heater, took his shit, it's a cold game
His niggas know I done it, now it's rumors they want my head
Got my Russian bitch sleeping with me right in the bed
My niggas killing about this shit, for realling about this shit
Fuck around and get a hundred years, dawg, about this shit

As I sit in my cell, might as well be in hell
Left for dead, 201, fourth floor where I dwell
Couldn't tell, thought you was a man, but you was a bitch
A nigga that I'd die for really was a snitch
Let me switch back to the scene, scene of the crime
Where I left all my hopes and dreams; caught me with a .9
Duffel bag full of plenty cash, empty out safe
Hit the mask, but a nosey fag fucked up my escape
I could take any charge cause it's death before dishonor
"Do you plead guilty on this case?" No, your honor
Wonder, how not guilty turned to guilty
Could it be that my homeboy turned state on me?
I can see you and the victim sittin' like a ho
On the prosecutor's side, shove a .9 down her throat
Of a coward punk bitch, your body in a ditch
Could've sold my own soldier to see the nine clique
Click, then your carcass fall like the gavel fell
Nine years what they gave me, then took me to jail
Did I tell? Nigga, hell nah, Project ain't a ho
We can blast with them thangs or we go toe to toe
Bullets blow niggas' brains out into outer space
Killas bust on you lames then leave without a trace
Just incase you was wondering did I let him live
He's at home with his wife but he better watch his kids

Snitches, bitches, snitches, bitches... (x16)

Bitch, you can't call the police
Tell 'em watch your back. (x4)[Hook: Project Pat]
I'm fucking with my homies, I'm fucking with my A1's
Who got it out the mud with a thug, since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my niggas who stay with me in it
No matter how hard that it was they represented*
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Patta!
I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
No love for you hoes who like to fuck for free
I was coppin' oz 800 to a g
Now I'm poppin' shows every week I'm stackin' cheese
Project on the roll like a motherfucking trucker
I'm always on the go I'm a motherfucking hustler
Never forget my lil homies in them project house
Shout out to all my lil dawgs in them FED walls
Project Patta ghetto like a bagel
Addicted to the cheddar like  junkie to the yayo
All my niggas eatin', every place I'm stackin'
Me and my homies tossed your gal
She was a fake ho
Pat I'm on the bread like last year
Nigga know the bizness
Project in this motherfucker stacking them chips, bitch
Imma ride in foreign rides and wear plenty gold
And we gon' stack plenty money and fuck plenty hoes

[Hook: Project Pat]
I'm fucking with my homies, I'm fucking with my A1's

I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my niggas who stay with me in it
No matter how hard that it was they represented
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one

[Verse 2: Juicy J](Juicy J speaking)
(You ever had niggas that was with you since the beginning
Its the same niggas who started catching feelings
When the money got real, success was knocking on your door like a police on a maintenance man tryna get in)
Shit so hard when you gotta cut a nigga off
Your friend, your ace
Ten years now, can't look at your face
Fuck what I say
You ain't the nigga I knew since the dope days, shit
Since the cold days
You just like the rest of the so called A1 niggas who turned stake soft
It's me against the world everyday mo' money  mo' hoes fuck famous
Bad bitches entertainment
Life full of changes
I'm feeling brainless
Stacking money in my bedroom
I can finally go to sleep
Feeling rich as fuck I'm never givin' up, don't fuck with me
My true A1 never turn his back
Never stole from and turned to crack
Took his dope and he turned to rack
Put Memphis on the map
Bought the game and than he sold it back
I look in the mirror he looking right back
The feeling is real, if I die on this track
If I die on this track

[Hook: Project Pat]
I'm fucking with my homies, I'm fucking with my A1's
Who got it out the mud with a thug, since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my niggas who stay with me in it
No matter how hard that it was they represented
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day oneStick 'em up, Stick 'em up
Raise 'em up, Raise 'em up

Stuck 'em down, Stuck 'em down
Raise 'em up, Raise 'em up

I'm psycho-pathic, behind the trig-ga
I needed loot so, I had to rob ya
The fake steel cause ya, a coward to me
I'd rather pop ya, before ya do me
Ya high cap-pin friend, flex-in in my hood
I'm out here star-vin, you live-in real good
As long as I got, a tone I stay paid
You keep sell-in dope, there's cheese to be made
Pull up on the track, niggas start to bail-in
I pulled out my gat, that's my dope y'all sell-in
So check on in boy, break yo self on down
You got 10 dollars, that's more than I have
Could be Patta's thangs, bet-ter than noth-ang
Even you broke fools, gone get me some-thang
Don't get your-self hurt, slaught-ered like a hog
I'm out on these streets, crawl-in like a dog

Stick 'em up, Stick 'em up
Raise 'em up, Raise 'em up

Stuck 'em down, Stuck 'em down
Raise 'em up, Raise 'em up
(Now that should be fun) (4X)

Open ses-ame, the safe in the floor
What I told the clerk, at the cor-ner store
A mask on my face, for cam-ras to see
A Glock to his dome, bitch don't play with me
Ya don't know the code, his eyes I see fear
Cause it's bout to get ugly up in here
The boy blew my high, the gun blew his ass
Right off with his man-ager in the back
Ball-in off the lot, no cheese mad as fuck
Half-way down the street, some hoes from the club
Pulled up at the light, in Benzo with rims
Now im act-in like, I'm holler-in at them
[Project Pat] Wussup with y'all? What y'all doin out this late
Girls: Shit! Just leaving the club. What's the business
[Project Pat] Ey look lemme get yo number
And them rings, and that purse
All that mother-fucking shit around yo neck!!
Bitch!! Let me get this shit ho
Drop it all!!! Shut up bitch!!! Shut up bitch

Stick 'em up, Stick 'em up
Raise 'em up, Raise 'em up

Stuck 'em down, Stuck 'em down
Raise 'em up, Raise 'em up
(Now that should be fun) (2X)

Robbers we hang, in hoods where they clean
Jackin any-one, from preacher to fiend
Addicted to this, just like it was Crack
You slip in the street, my toast to your back
I'm out on the late, while you on a date
Your bitch looking good, you clean so I hate
You take-in your time, to wine and to dine
But times on my side, so I'm gon' go hide
In bushes your house, pull up we jump out
With mask-is and gun, then duct tape your mouth
The girl you was with, gave us the info
That you was a heavy nig-ga with dough
A kidnap could turn into a murd-a
Now where is the stash, 45 will serve-ya
We take-in the loot, never think-in twice
Either it's the cheese, or either your life

Stick 'em up, Stick 'em up
Raise 'em up, Raise 'em up

Stuck 'em down, Stuck 'em down
Raise 'em up, Raise 'em up
(Now that should be fun) (4X)[Intro: Juicy J]
Trippy Nation nigga
Young Ced on the beat, watch these snitches mane

[Hook x2: Juicy J]
These nigga's dropping dimes, they some real snitches
The only dimes that I ever dropped was some bitches
I’ma cut some fingers, I’ma clip some tongues
Cause all that point in talkin' ain’t allowed where I’m from

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Nigga stuck off in the fare, fucking with them bricks
His partners put them laws on him, over a bitch
These pussy nigga's scared, don’t wanna take they charge
They swear they hard but they softer then cotton balls (ho)
Real nigga's go to jail and don’t tell them nothing (true)
Do that time, come back home then get back to hustling (true)
We got everything for sale, but the kitchen sink (true)
Keep my eyes on you snakes, I don’t even blink (bitch)
Boy you scared, you gonna tell them white folks everything (yes sir)
To cut your time, you gonna give up errybody name (pussy)
Snitching nigga you ain’t straight, them folks gonna find you dead
Cut your tongue out your mouth and put one in ya head

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
The bigger the gun, the bigger the slug
The bigger the hole for doc to plug
Holdin' your head, I put you to sleep
Body not found, mama gon’ weep
Droppin the dime and runnin your mouth
Nowhere to run, down in the south
Meet ya wrong, I hop on the phone
Goons on route, burners out
You screamin' pig, I blow up your wig
Vocals smokin' just like a cig
Blowin' on kush and sippin' on hen
Forgive me father for your sin
Meet ya wrong, I'm able again
Convicted felon, back in the pen
Pistol in face, you wit attention
They goin' for twelve, I got em for ten
He threw me them bowls, he knew I'm a boss
He looking for bread, he know that’s a loss
I cross em a corn, mixed somethin' me deal
And separate the fact from the real
You play the cards, bet you a deal
Behind them bars, now you gon’ squeal
You playin' these streets, we playin' for real
Jail come wit it, swallow that meal

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Driicky Graham]
Prime time snitchin' lies, got line twistin' guys

One: put you in a scope, two: clack then it's smoke
Three. scoop you up and put ya body in a envelope
Four: send yo folks jus ya head, chest, guts
Now you leakin' body stinkin' up the Fed Ex truck
And that fed pressure, makes the snitches wanna roast you

Where I'm from we gets it done and act like we don't know dude

And them all frozen, moves from the 'K nigga
Turk don't play, when it's time to get serious
Think I'm a ho keep it that way and stay curious

[Baby]
Niggas be shoutin' one love but wearin black gloves
Some niggas 26 and 28 still live in they mom house askin' for play
Them niggas shouldn't be respected, they fake
Instead of hittin' blocks with Glocks and touchin' niggas money spot
And breakin' bread with the woman who put em in that spot
These niggas wanna trick they hoes
And play with they nose
Instead of totin' fo' fo's and movin' fuckin' kilos
Nigga I done bought more cars than niggas done bought pussy hoes
And bought more rims than niggas done fucked they main ho in they assholes
3-6 told me to roll and unload
But nigga fuck that

Tinted windows on my candy apple cut dawg
It's a classy nigga fuck yall

[Juicy J]
I'm representin' Northern Memphis to the fuckin' fullest
We ain't the kind to tote a gun when there ain't no bullets
And when that drama starts the strap we expect to pull it
You see a nigga holdin gauge and you wish he would have
Rolled by yo' mama house and put her in a coma
Cuz niggas gone on that Hennessey and marijuana
And now we back up in the hood on a burner phone-a
In that game slangin' came to you blood donors
It's on, coward

[Lil Wayne]
They call me quick draw 2 pistols Lil Wayne
Champagne took my brain, I don't think I just aim
Drop tops on a Z-3
Start shootin' like 3 burners

Better watch for lil shorty in black
Nigga get back
Bout to make my Glock 40 click clack
Brrr kill it
It's yo Life

Then deliver him 50 shots and take his child

[DJ Paul]
Punk bitch I dare ya
I double dare ya step against this pot belly
Bitches they try to step to the ruler but they ain't ready
Weak ass them cowards try to make moves but I knock 'em out
2nd ones step yall need more help 2 barrels in his mouth
Face it when this shits fucked up you gotta deal with it

And how you gon' have ice when I cut your fuckin' water off

[Hook]

Went to jail and never ratted
Held it down for all my dogs
Hustlers prayer on my arm tatted
Pussy nigga real acrobatic
Flipping on your homie
I'm the state you the felony
I'm fifty carats you the phony
Hit a lick
Made for fifty yams, took it off your ass
This the street, who you trustin' foo

Just these chains
Fifty rocks for fifty shots
In yo ass

[Hook: Project Pat]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Let me borrow yo bitch, just for tonight

She ride my dick like a bike, I tell her suck it don't bite
And you still cuffin' da ho, like you Miami Vice
Juicy J don't love these bitches, I just make love to these bitches
And send them back to that same nigga, that hug them and kiss them
I go to sleep with my money, I cuddle all up on my dough
I wake up to that paper and then I go get some mo'
Fuck nigga what you talkin' bout we don't talk it out

Live everyday like a home run, what I'm trying to say is we ball out
Yo bedroom and yo living room be right inside my doghouse
I'm searching hard for a fuck to give but I'm sorry, looks like I'm all out

[Hook: Project Pat][Intro: Project Pat]
Yeah it's Project Pat in this thang
This goes out to all real niggas mane

The cars, the clothes, the life, I chose

[Verse 1 - Project Pat]
The gutta, the hood, the drugs, what's cookin'?
The guns, the mask, the young broads hookin'
The grams, the zones, the hundred for the tens
The county, the state, the fed-e-ral pen
Police in them high speeds now that's where I been
Ya left ya house unattended, was breakin' in
Old heads 'round the way say I need to cease fire
Cocaine habit like, water to the grease fire
Nines, big pinky rangs, flashy like King Tut
Dirty South ain't havin' thangs, do you see the bling what?
Candy paint, on the cars, hazelnut wood
Twenty fo' inch floaters floatin' through the hood

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Juicy J]
I'm on the slab tryna slang this pack of yams (yams)
Call me the sand man straight, outta Pakistan (stan)
I'm tryna get in, suckers better get this (this)

You on the grind every night, tryna get mine (mine)
Slangin blow, packs of pills and that goodie pine (pine)

[DJ Paul]
Yeah, I specialize in bein' a specialist (specialist)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Project Pat]
I been gettin' money from the crumbs to the purse snatchin'
I kept a mask on wit' the guns click-clackin'
Project was straight jackin' drug dealers to the fiends
I wasn't comin' up I had dreams of comin' clean
About this ghetty green, night and day I plot and scheme
Was in the project sellin' pills sippin' lean
Nigga I'm hustlin', where the bullets never ceaseful
It's always gunplay, cause ya mouth stay in grease-ful
Get a treeful, my candy like Honeydew
They see me in my car, dog, this what money do
Ya baby mama wanna holla so you hate to this
I'm talkin' money talk some can't relate to this

[Hook]

[Music to fade](Chorus) 3x
Pistol packin, never slackin, bitch killa
Pistol packin, never slackin, bitch smackin killa

As I slip into the back of my mind
And thinkin of gettin caught man how could I do the time
The crime is a murder heard you fuckin with my nig
The magnum's gonna serve ya, bitch I'm fixin to split your wig
I'm thinkin out ways to get lose without a trace
You see without a pistol man they do not have a case
Erasin a fool wait until he leaves the house
Walkin around his corner ride by and takin him out
The box on the blocks police ride up on the scene
Witnesses saw the shots and I know they heard her scream
Redeem me the testimonies would not even last
In court because everybody they saw wore a mask
The blast from the gun was the hollow point tips
The kind that leave you dead in a damn perfect hit
I trips off a fool tryin me on the for realla
He's fuckin with a pistol packin, bitch smackin killa

Chorus  4x

As I ride through the hood with some undisputed niggas
Pain sellin, dope smokin, cold-blooded killers
Trigga, my nigga from the north Frayser area
Down with the Patster causin mass hysteria
Well ever stoked out best we leave with no doubt
Ridin through the other side ready to take a punk out
Assed out sucker types you gonna learn your lesson
Let me see your gangsta friends shootin Smith and Wessons
Testin the clan just to see if you can get enough
You's a foolish man I'll be damned if we don't fuck you up
So whassup with your posse with your fuckin game punk
Fuckin with these hitmen you gonna get your ass dumped
Pop the trunk, get your pump, let's see what you made of
Watch me kill a bitch with a .38 bullet slug
Sell your drugs I don't care if you a dope dealer
Best pack a pistol bitch cause I'm a killer

Chorus 2x

You say I need to take care of my business
Well why are you pussy-eatin motherfuckers in it
You about to witness a mafia called Triple 6
Real niggas that don't fall all over bullshit
I'm tired of these motherfuckers lickin and my Joesta
Let me ride up on ya with the tec and Imma show ya
You don't know me well punk bitch nigga bring it on
Niggas dont fight no more junk niggas carry tones
I tried to be done at first now I'm just another devil
Walkin with a psychotic mind and a piece of metal

Chorus 4x[Intro: DJ Paul]

Pull up at your moma house, everybody is a victim
Nigga we don't leave no witness, we be gone on a mission
Gone, now you going to miss, them choppers on them snow pistols
Couple hundred rounds gunned you down, shit's just like some missiles
Man you ain't get no drank, niggas ain't getting no cake

Pull them guns your way and now you ain't got no face
Oh we in the game and them niggas that focus on somebody that playin' with yall so gucci
My nigga I stunt, I will snatch up your dollars
When I'm in the club I got 100 bottles

Not only a threat, I'm also the best
You gon' have to learn to accept it like death

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
Which one of you fuck niggas wanna test me
Real gone, will be, they will call the police
Sirens off, keep this bitch up out this ho

Death Tone, Funky Town, right now gun sound
Dead men, broke bars, more to get pulled apart
Koopsta too hard, my god, body parts, body parts

[Verse 3: Skinny Pimp]
Chrome 40 mag, when you got 'em stuck
Ran through the hood, then you ran for the door
Got a whole lot of bands but it's not for sale
Real street niggas don't hide here
Ducking and dodging the cops and shit
[?]
But it bounce right back at big Mafia six
They can't keep Skinny Pimp in this bitch
With DJ Paul, Gangsta Boo, Scarecrow, Crunch' and Koop
We breaking the law, damn they down my door, it's a fact y'all
We turning it up, put to hood [?]
All of us gots a plug
Niggas ain't got no money but still trying to fuck with us

[Verse 4: Lil Wyte]
And I got that thang changed, I hope you ready for what has begun
Dumped all this body parts in my trunk, and I did that there just for fun
Mom told me a long time ago "The respect will come", and it's finally here
I got blonde hair [?] blood is that pure
Now I'm all the way gone ho when you need this shit
Get blessed like you done sneezed or some shit
I'm starting a new religion and The Scarecrow will be my beacon bitch
Mafia for life with me, my third I will always see a six
I'm fully involved will all of this, it's Lil Wyte till I'm deceased bitch

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
I'm all about my business, I'm all about my bread
Shoot these motherfuckers head in the head
I'mma make sure all you motherfuckers dead
Catch a nigga slipping, hit him with the bat
Duct-Duct tape them, that's what I said
Check from over there, look up under the bed
All a nigga came for was motherfucking bread
Mafia Six in this motherfucking bitch

[Verse 6: La Chat]
La Chat bitch, I'm wrecking shit

Lips still in my game mane, right hand's my gun hand

Crestwood is my hood, and I rep it all day
I'm the madest desert eagle till the twos wanna play

[Verse 7: Project Pat]
Pat'aahh
Chopper on the floor, work on the stove
Loud to my lips, smoke out my nose
All these bands, I be jugging on my hustle, on my pan
You get fucked up little pussy with my fingers on this hand
Cut the grass like a lawnmower, like a rake
Faught you niggas like Django, quick as a snake
Anything for the money, [?]
With the pistols upside your head I'm like death checkmate
Project like the Rolexs and them Breitlings
Duffel bag full of motherfucking dead white meat
Told your bitch pussy [?]
But I smashed on the ass like [?]

[Verse 8: Locodunit]
Ready for 09's, ain't got a role model
You fuck with my high, you're not going to roll right
Breaking two gold bottles, hang with the real
Chill with the real rockers, killers and pill poppers
We cuffing that shit and them niggas that steal choppers
Fuck you feel about this? Real lane
Scale-A-Ton tatted from my arm, drawn in my palms
Kush inbetween my index and my thumb, exhale from my lungs
Load the Tommy Gun, split the tongues, kill them one by one
Dump all the body parts into my trunk

[Verse 9: Point Blank]
Didn't give a fuck about yesterday, don't give a fuck today
And tomorrow I'm probably going to feel the same fucking way
They love you when I hit it, hate me when I miss it
So much yack in system you can smell it when I'm pissing
I smoke like a broke down engine, I love my money like I love my women
Let me show you how to whip it, let me show you how to pack it
Let me show you how to sell it, let me show you how to stack it
Pillow talking with these rest might get you excited
But don't let the pillow talk get you green lighted
Now I'm in the mix with the Mafia Six, but I breathe H-Town
I'mma die coalition, coalition
Told you once, told you a million motherfucking times
I'm like a shredder, don't get caught up in my fucking grind
Mix me with that shit, it's the wrong night
Body parts, hope it's them bitch niggas I don't like

[Verse 10: JGRXXN]
Monkey ass niggas sit banana clips (aye)
And water niggas 'bout to make me click (them)
Fucking with the Six catch a hot tip
I never go, never without my click
Ana for you niggas to the grizzle
And niggas think they superman, so you can get your issue
Six million ways to put them in the trunk
JGreen on the scene, put the body parts in dump

[Verse 11: Kokoe (DJ Paul)]
I’m the hardest Mexican, out of west L.A
Talk that shit your body end up in the fucking bay
All I listen to is Eazy and N.W.A
Now I'm riding with the Mafia, homie here to spray
Numb killers, drug dealers, cap-pealers
And hoes that never catch feelings
Cut the check, I cut your neck, put you in a body bag
Because your boy never ever ever have respect for a snitch
Nah bitch (Don't want it)
Nah bitch (Don't want it)
Nah, nah, nah, nah (Don't want it)
(Scale-A-Ton out the kitch', Scale-A-Ton out the kitch', you don't want nothing bitch)

[Verse 12: Lord Infamous]
It's the murder chains of massacre, [?] attacking ya

The ammo enter front then it coming out the back of ya
I gotta get your goon, skin his brain while I'm stabbing ya
[?]
Put on the gas and light up'll make your ass combust
I am Lord Infamous, I do not take prisoners
Mission to enter you, decrease your temperature
Serial killer, wicked voodoo minister
Scorpion sometimes Dr. Kevorkian
Shoot you in the porcelain, and give me [?]
Ghetto went corporate, Illuminati ornament

[Verse 13: Gangsta Boo]
All these fake ass hoes in my face, we ain't cool
But back with the Six, now I'm getting the bitches [?]
Unexpected gather, bitches shaking
We would like you shot your own self in the basement

I leave your ass stinking without me even fucking blinking
I'm harder than hard, don't fuck with the god
I come from a part where niggas don't starve, where niggas they in
Don't give a fuck about friends, them niggas hit in
I leave them leaking, and that there is a bad end
My gun don't give a fuck about illegal when I pull the trigger
It don't care if you even a fucking nigga
This pussy shit is unacceptable, don't test my testicles
I'm pointing [?], and leaving you niggas vegetables
With being Francis Jackson is the only way I got two faces
Had them sharp bullets going up and taking two faces
Niggas got my name on their tongue like they shoe laces
I lace you niggas with revolver bullets and leave no traces
Leave them up [?], mouth full of civil well
Put the price on your head, now my goons are millionaire
[?]
I don't give a fuck about care, so I never care
I'm a millionaire so the traphouse like [?]
Nah I'm lying, I still celebrate
A gun from the hip, so I still sell a bitch
Run around in a row with my nose in that shit, trick
With hella guns, big guns, you really want some?
I'm not sane, I'm insane, my guns go rappa-bam-bam
And I bum on these bitches [?]
Where the fuck I'm coming from [?]
Bitch!

Money in the garbage bag
Louis gucci duffle bags

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: V Slash]
I'ma hustle til I die, like my homie Juicy J

On the street with Project Pat I never thought I see the day
And Imma keep it real wit cha, he the reason why I’m shining
Savy Slash grinding
“it brought me to the limelight”
Folks tried to have me
23 on me, locked me down

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Haters mad on the town cause a nigga got it made

And if he talkin trash, I put him in a bag
A body-fucking-bag, man, I shoulda wore a mask

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
I know this nigga who got punked out after every class
He was a bitch in school and now he tote a gun and badge
Put on a uniform and now he think he super bad
Man fuck your vest you still get laid to rest under the grass

Some niggas pay him off to sell they dope around his set

Repeat 1

[Verse 5: Project Pat]
Breakin laws, Glock in drawers, whip it out and take a taste
You can smell my fuckin nuts, while this tome is in yo face
Shove the barrel down your throat, inhale bullets like some smoke

You get stomped in yo mug, when I shoot, then I peel out
Right before dat happen I'mma tear yo fuckin grill out
Beat you bitches down 'til you covered in your own blood
Shoot a couple of rounds from my house, ain't no fuckin love
And one of y'all niggas wanna get some I got some
Blow they fuckin ass off, double barrel shotgun
Don't be comin my way bodys stank like moth balls
Swing a iron bat to yo head like a golf ball
Ride up on yo ass then I let the luga sweep

It's da Project nigga roll, ready mane to kill a ho
Put the thang to you head squeeze the trigger let it BLOWWW!

Pull up, chrome rims, didn't holla, she must be dykin'
Like she didn't see the colors change colors on my paint job
Just like all the colors on my ice in my wrist watch
Pimps scarred, nothin' but some conversation for some dough
Slangin' these words out my mouth, like I'm sellin' snow
Tellin' no, lies, compromise, only cheese wise
If ya try to cross, real killers then you must, die

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Pimp C]
Mackaroni Pretty Tony Snow keep it poppin'
Movin' to the internet, keep that pussy droppin'

If that game was over I'd get some work and cook it up
Wanna show let's rook it up, you want a beat I'll hook it up

[Verse 3]
Cruisin' Chelsea Avenue, in the hood, it's a sunny day
Junts out, walkin' miniskirts, let them bunnies play
Money stay, in a nigga's pocket wrapped in rubberbands
Seven hundred ones wit' 'bout seventy Benjamins
Understand, couple hollow jackets in the bar-ra-rel
Make a wild nigga wanna walk a straight and nar-ra-row
My dogs strapped, on point, God we like the phar-ra-roah
My hundred shots, comin' out the mouth, of the calico
Yean' know? Mayne a nigga do's what he gon' do
I'm lookin' for some beef, but the kind, at a barbeque
Comin' through, flickin' old school, Box Chevy thang
Ridin' twenty two's, on you fools, let the system bang

I keep my cup raised up (echoes out)[Intro: Juicy J]

Hot, saddity Asian woman. Fuck it, I need a gang of women
Kush dumbin', 808 drummin'
Big blunts got your main ho hummin', straight dumbin'

Getting becky from your bitch while a nigga countin' money

You don't want me to grow, no my dear!
Living in two different realities, I swear. (I swear)
You don't want me to grow, no my dear

Cause if I get that butt, I'mma make that thang bust
Cash rules everything about me for real, yall

Patah! you know I'm dumb with the money spending
From the slums, no handout, ain't no money lending
Escalade, twenty-two, Beemer Crip blue
Love the money, hate to work, I'm a Black Jew
Block of ice on my wrist. Ho bad, nigga, spanish
VIP toastin' up fourty bottles of Rose now

[Bridge: Reggie B]
Get you some business, baby

Way back
Now my money old and we go way back
Laid back

They hate it but still debating
Even they know we up next
My brother Rel said chill
They don’t be knowning your stress
But now it’s [?] all my new shit

Big blunt on my two lips

Pounds of that Northern Cali, man we murking these
