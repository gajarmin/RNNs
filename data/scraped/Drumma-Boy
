[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
August, Young Money
I swear this is my favorite song *laughs*
I’m serious, burrrrr

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
Red light, you know I can't make this thing that official
Believe, we had a great night but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you - shit
You don't like that, I make this easy, leaving
After sexing on the floor
Baby I know you need me, like I need you
But I'm not the one you wanna love

[Hook: August Alsina]
Pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like me
You used to them but ain't no love in me
I hear what you was sayin' and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You pro'ly go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, ain't no love in me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no love in me
So don't come looking for love
Oh! (no love x8)
Don’t come looking for love
(Oh! (no love x8)

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Shawty, if you looking for somebody trying to settle down
Probably won't be around, nah baby
You should hit me when you tired of playing up in the house
And ain't nobody around, you need that
When you need that late night
We can both make love to the daylight
You got it girl, you got it girl
But you know I can't stay right? Uh, nah babe
All I want is you so what you tryna do?

[Hook]

[Bridge: August Alsina]
No love, no love, no love, no love, no love (x4)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & (August Alsina)]
August, you know, I’m here to save you
Me and them girls, we ain’t the same boo
You know I hate it, when you leave me
Cause you love it then you leave it but you know how bad I need it
You so fuckin’ conceited, why you coming over weeded?
You can’t treat me like you treat them
Yes, I am the crème de la crème
Yes, I am from one to ten, ten
You fronting in them streets, keep saying we just friends
You can’t front like this ain’t way realer
I know you hard, I know that you a killer
I know you started off a dope dealer
But let your guard down, your niggas know you feel her, feel her
So what you want, baby?
(All I want is you so what you tryna do?)

[Hook][Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Girl the way you're movin', got me in a trance

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
She said look ma, no hands and no darling I don't dance

Fight for what broad, these hoes ain't mine
Is you out your mind? You out your league

Wear out tracks, let me do my thing, I got 16, for this Roscoe thing
But I'm almost done, let me get back to it
Whole lotta loud and a little backwood
Whole lotta money, big tip I would

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Roscoe]

No need to elaborate, most of these ducks exaggerate
But I'mma get money nigga everyday stuntin' nigga

Me, I'm in my spaceship, that's right, I work for NASA
This FNH is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard

Hat back, top back, ain't nothin' but a young thug
HKs, AK's, I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps, you know I like it super-sized
Passenger's a redbone, her weave look like some curly fries
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that Glock on me
Don't get caught without one, coming from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton, flying down Campbellton
So fresh, so clean, on my way to Charlene

[Hook]

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I put on, I put on, I put on

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I feel like it's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like it's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know he's stressed
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame, man, that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man, that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least, uh, one of Russell's nieces
On, I let my nightmares go
I put on everybody that I knew from the go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke
They say, "Damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more?"
"You got that big fame, homie, and you just changed on me"
You can ask big homie, man, the top so lonely
Ai-ee-ah, so lonely, ai-ee-ah!
Let me see what we have tonight, I'm high as a satellite
I see those flashing lights cause every night, every night, I put on

[Hook]

[Outro: Kanye West] (x2)
Let me see what we have tonight
I'm high as a satellite
I see those flashing lights
Cause every night, every night[Verse 1 - Drake]
I am on a 24-hour champagne diet
Spilling while I'm sipping, I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it, boy, I'm on that fly shit
I am what everybody in my past don't want me to be
Guess what? I made it!
I'm the motherfuckin' man, I just want you to see
Come take a look, get a load of this nigga
Quit fronting on me, don't come around
And try come gas me up, I like running on E
I-I'm on my Disney shit - Goofy flow
On records I'm Captain Hook and my new car is "Rufio"
Damn, where my roof just go? I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shaking something cause that's what Drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for
Like leaving girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes
I'm losing my thoughts I say, "Damn, where my roof just go?"
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl

[Hook - Drake]
They can't help it and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, but Bitch! I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow

[Verse 2 - Birdman]
Yea, richer than the richest, we certified getting it
CM, YM, Cash Money business
Higher than the ceiling, fly like a bird
Hit the Gucci store and later get served
We smoked out, with no roof on it
Them people passing, so we smash on 'em
Ballin' up: we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the V-set
Louis lens iced up with the black diamonds
Cartier, Ferrari the new Spider
No lie, I'm higher than I ever been
Born rich, born Uptown, born to win
Fully loaded, automatic 6 Benz
Candy paint, foreign lights with my bitch in
Born hustling, too big nigga to size me up
Count stunting, more money - burn 'em up

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
When I get paid every 24 hours, money and the power
Come to V.I.P. and get a champagne shower
I don't have to worry because everything ours
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
That kush - I promise that's my dude
But we don't smoke that Reggie Bush
And I'm with 2 women, make you take a second look
We popping like champagne bottles but we never shook
And we gon' be alright if we put Drake on every hook

[Hook][Pre-Intro: Young Dolph]

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Now give me everything I ask for or end up in a cast, ho
Never slow down, that's why I'm getting paid fast forward
Standin' on my money, that's a cash flow (Oh)
Smokin' medical, sippin' chemical I need a lab coat
From where they're livin' on food stamps, that's past poor
Thought about it as I got a stamp in my passport
Yeah I made it out, made it up, Butler remain makin' it up
Never satisfied what I make, no such thing as makin' enough
Bitch I'm livin' like it's Monopoly
Tryin' to dodge jail and I'm buyin' up the property
Wifey was down with monogamy, 'til she started massaging me
But you can't have a dollar ho, blame it on the economy
A young player at the tip-top
Bitch niggas hatin', bad bitches wanna lip-lock
I could show you the ropes since I got the game in a slipknot
From a city of g's, I'm just the one that was picked out
Yup

[Hook: Big Sean]
Wake up in the morning, first thing I need is my paper
Paper, paper, paper
You might pass out and die if you try and match my labor
Labor, labor, labor
Man every time they see me they say, "Boy what you doin'?"
"Boy what you doin'?" "Boy-boy what you doin'?"
Bitch I'm tryin' to build a hundred dollar bill skyscraper
Scraper, scraper, stackin' my paper

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Bitch, unzip my pants 'fore you try and take 'em off
Open wide, say, "Ahh" then you cough
See I got so many shows, think it's a season of LOST
Get money, uniform, you could see I'm on my job
Aw damn, bitch you better stand in your lane
All my jams are so insane, you're just Danity Kane
Straight pussy and no balls, rockin' jeans and thug
Sandals that's a faux pas, have 'em all like (Oh God)
Every time we showin' off
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve
They involved into what Gotti was
Iller than you thought you was
Now we in Bugatis ridin' shotty when we shoppin'
For some good shit, I don't claim no hood shit
But I guarantee you I ain't on that Hollywood shit
Hey, unless it's chillin' up at holiday hills
And rap sixteen bars, all of 'em ill, what

[Bridge: Big Sean & Mac Miller]
Say, say, say, say
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve (x6)

[Hook][Hook: Young Thug]
Thugga and Guwop got 100 choppas

No less than 20 in my trousers lil nigga

Verse 1: Young [Thug]
Got these bitches bending over like a lineman
Make the pot, bitch straight over like a [?]
Everybody get that green, we the lime men
All my slime crickets, I think we need lemons
1017 the mothafucking movement
Pipe that bitch down, I'ma duel it
The way I  throw em through  it, my arm  a Uzi
Bought a bitch a pair of shoes, and fuck her booty
Hol'  it, don't let up, these niggas can't catch with thugga no thugger
We eatin' no other
I'm chubby like my brother
I'm chubby like my mother
We take all yo goodies, and go straight to Costco
Catch up with yo bitch, and turn her into a sucka
She not what I see, but you know we Russia
Pigment early, clubbin' later
I'm not no candy,  but I am a jawbreaker
You think I'm gay,  I'ma send ya to meet your maker
Put a hole in yo head like a piston

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Starlito]
And if I thought that I could change maybe I would
I got a lot of common sense but baby I’m hood
I sold dope before but I wouldn’t say that you should
But I’ve been broke before and it doesn’t feel good
Bruh told me push
Fuck niggas wouldn’t have nothing on my books
Hate this stupid ho I’m with but love the way she look
Love the way she lie
But her cousin got me plugged in on the kush
Must be crazy I then double dipping fucking on her sister, oops!
I know I ain’t shit I ain’t proud of it
Then called 16 had to call them right back like...
Want a verse or a pound of it?
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Yea I kinda like the sound of it
Got a box of bullets ready to touch you pussies
Fuck around and get found bloody
Outchea thugging without a budget
They trying to figure out how I does it
Independent and I’m winning
I was broke before but it's been a minute
Spending chicken independent
That’s a rollie so it isn't ticking
Time is money, can’t spend a second
Second guessing no indecision
My second weapon got extensions in it
That’s thirty shots
Living life as a thug nigga, that’s word to pac
Grind hard so we stir a lot
Swerving, serving like we never heard of cops
Prefer to handle my business personally
You want this work or not?

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
My money dirty, my hands dirty
Pistol dirty, my whip clean
Bitch with me, we riding dirty
She talk dirty but her pussy clean
I’m still dirty, I’m still working
I’m still serving, nigga fuck you mean
My pockets fat and my temper short
And my clip is longer than a limousine
And I let that bitch come bark at you
Bitch I’m strapped like a dog catcher
The last thing you want is confrontation
Cause I’m with the shit like your gallbladder
30 rounds in that 12 gauge
Incendiary that’s overkill
I live life in the fast lane
Either catch up or be roadkill
Trap nigga way before the deal
I don’t give a shit about a deal
Bitch I got a plug, I’m a heavyweight
With more outlets than the opry mill
Such a fly guy I’m so outta hell
I’m so fresh to death I ought to write a will
Got a box of bullets ready to touch you pussies
These hollow points tryna cop a feel
In the trees like a baby panda
Paranoid I’ll spray the hammer
I’m in my house up all night
Just staring at my surveillance cameras
I’m warning you no warning shots
I’ll pop your ass and you’ll learn your lesson
Stressed out, still counting money
Cause that’s best antidepressant
If I thought that I could change maybe I would
I got a lot of common sense but bitch I’m hood
And I’ve sold dope before I ain’t saying you should
But I’ve been broke before and that never feels good
Bitch![Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm popular and poppin' dough
Breakfast at Pappadeaux's
Dodging all obstacles
Trapping at the Stop-N-Go
Boy you know you lame if you still riding stop and go
Disect the beat and then I turn it to a particle
Pardon though, I'm harder though
You should read the article
I'm riding high and dodging hoes
You better hope im dodging your
Model hoes dollar hoes, white looking Madonna hoes Dolce Gabbana, Ferragamo, and the Prada hoes
College ho Zone 3, niggas with a lot of gold
Snoop guard the door
I just love being by the stove
Heres some food for thought, a little food for your soul
Like a comma, I love being right next to O's

[Hook:]
I had a long day
My nerves bad
Yea I'm smoking on loud I know you heard that
Hit the jewlery store, with a hundred grand
I can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
Leave the trap house, with a hundred grand
I can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
Time to re-up, I got a hundred bands,i can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands

[Verse 2: J Hard]
We sitting high speaking like we super human beings
Cars mulatto, black on black Europeans
Too hard to swallow like UGKings and
Number one thesis do you believe in Jesus
They say money is the root of all diseases
Well call the docotr I see honest in my thesis
Summer vacation, one trip two bricks
Baby momma saying im impatient my sons need shit
When you pull up to the front, all you see is whips
Diddy bop to the back all you see is zips
In zip locks, and garbage bags
Usher Raymond in this bitch yea I got it bad

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz!)
My plug need me, but he greedy

See I'm from where you rob Peter to pay Paul
I'm yelling fuck the world I woke up with my dick hard
Big dog, big broads all in my circumference
Pussy on lock down, I dont hand cuff it
Sipping Grey Goose and we spending mad doucets
Rubberband fetish get it in abundance
Ben Franklins back to back, hundreds on hundreds
Gucci flip flaps, I got bunyons on bunyons
Yellow ring look like a funyon, or somethin'
I just left the trap house, money on money

[Hook][Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm on my way to see my P.O
I ain't talking about probation officer
Talking about my P.O. box, they just sent me 3 million dollars
(What the fuck that mean nigga?)
All my hoes go to the beauty parlor
Bought my ma a house today
I'll buy my auntie one tomorrow
I just left the Phantom lot

You bring your girl your feelings hurt
Cause like R .Kelly "I'm a Flirt "
I got work like babe and them, a Geto Boy like 'Face and them
It ain't no mistaking him
Hottest boys out Drake and him
Me, Juiceman and Waka and them
Ride around with choppers, pimp
So how the hell you chop or flip you water bluffing water whimp
Theres no limit to Gucci money just ask Silk the Shock & them

[Hook]
Burglar bars around the door (word)
My country boys they want some more (birds)
Early in the morning
Later in the evening
I'm all about that money man even when I'm sleeping

I'm all about that money
Don't make me send my goons to gunning
I'm all about that money
Don't make me send my goons to gunning

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
All about my money, nigga, run with my monopoly
Money; my philosophy, cocaine on my property
Yeah, that bitch a stripper, but there's so much she can offer me
Gave me the connect, he send me 7 and say it's all for me
Money build my confidence
Shorty, show your competence
Before I get another bitch, cause I be on some other shit
Higher than a mothership
Louis in my seven-tre

So for the bread I make you play a game of Simon Says

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Like Batman and Robin we be flogging mobbing inside Aston Martins
Beg your pardon Gucci darling
More check than a check-o-slovin
Whats your motherfucking problem?
Ross and Gucci I'm-a rob em
How you ganna rob the robbers?
These home boys got too much armor
We got so much jewelry on
We just make your vision dizzy

Give your ass a charm and watch it make your fingers pissing

[Verse 4- Rick Ross]
Damnit boy I'm spilling Chrissy Ye
Yellow bitches blowing kisses Ricky Ross about them digits
On the stage or in the kitchen[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Myself at all times, I’m so allergic to phony
One of a kind, original, means I’m the one and only
God put me here to be humble and help my family survive
Sometimes I’m a victim of ignorance in my own pride
The devil be workin’ on me, I make it so easy for him
God be talkin’ to me, I light up the weed and ignore him
Money be on my mind, so much I hurt the ones I love
I move four hundred of stacks and rarely do it because of the love
My cock, it conjures me like it’s bigger than all that small talk
That’s why my listeners be so rapped up in 8Ball's thoughts
I target just how I see the sense verse that melt the surface
Seem like the lack of love have given the industry beat on purpose
I brush my shoulders off and keep it unique whatever I speak
Somebody must like me cause every album I did leaked
Content harsh, my heart won’t let me talk it soft
You niggers is ready or friendly, find something else to talk about

[Hook]
I’m allergic to phony, I’m allergic to fakes
I’m allergic to suckers, I’m allergic to snakes
I’ll be sneezing and coughing
Got me coughing and choking
Thank your fuckin’ which is pimpin’ boy, you must be jokin’

I’m allergic to phony, I’m allergic to fakes
I’m allergic to suckers, I’m allergic to snakes
I’ll be sneezing and coughing
Got me coughing and choking
Thank your fuckin’ which is pimpin’ boy, you must be jokin’

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I’m from the land of the trill, Port Arthur Texas the city
Where bras beyond the black option, they gut the gangsters get greedy
From the jets on the west side where they throw up their sets
To the east where they put in work with no kinds of regrets
I’m sayin’ so many thangs the average foul couldn’t handle
See brother killed brother, pull out his lights like a candle
Seein’ gangsters turned into suckers in ten seconds flat
Because it ain’t just where you from, is where the fuck are you at
But if there’s one that I’ve learned in all my time in this game
Is don’t make hopes niggers and ho shit take you out of your lane
So from the shit I refrain, before weak dudes I’m a verdict
I’m the king of the trill so if you ain’t real I’m allergic
Bitch move around

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
These boys ain’t official, they soft as a tissue
They claimin’ they mean but they fuckin’ the bitch
They claimin’ they bang but they colors are changin'
They stitchin’ the Kafka, eliminate thing
These rappers is lame, these rappers are liars
How could you be at this fraudulent guys
Before I do that I will find me a job
Or find me a fake ball and grab of the rod
It could be her, it could be him
If they’re good then it could be them
But that would be me cause I’m opposite that
Opposite line, opposite wet
Never a liar, I’m right and exact
Exactly right when I’m rippin’ the mike
The life I recite is exactly mine
The logical sight is exactly high
See first she was trippin’ and rippin’ and grippin’
And now you’re his what? And drunkin’ the thugs
Seeing you suckers is driving me crazy
False and phony, but fake for days
If I see you posers you’d better pray that I’ll never catch you alone
I’m grabbin’ that tone and puttin’ that bullet
Right through your b-b-b-bone

[Hook][Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah

For the national mothafuckin' trap star anthem
Let's go

[Hook x2]
Cause bitch I'm a amazing', look what I'm blazin'
Eyes so low, yea I look like an Asian
Forever clubbin', forever thuggin'
Haters run they mouth, they ain't talkin' bout nothin'

[Verse 1]
Rose gold Audemar, lookin' like it's miller times
Six or seven diamond chains, who he think he Busta Rhymes
Bitch I bust a lot of rhymes, could of done a lot of time
And I ain't never snorted shit, put it all up on the line
Got a lot up on my mind, got a lot up on my plate
Got to feed my hood, So I'm up and down the interstate
The streets need a nigga, so I'm in and out that vocal booth
Hoes love a nigga, cause I'm in and out they yellow coupe
But nuttin but banana split, say that I'm her favourite
If you can take a lot of dick, I can talk a lot of shit
Go on baby swag it up, show them haters who your with
Bring you want that gangsta shit, who you niggas fuckin' with

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cause Bitch I'm amazin'
First I sold two mill, then I sold another one
Told them if you pay for three, that I will front another one
Told them if they give me this, then I'll record another one
But if you can not give me that, ain't no sense in callin' back
Fuck you think they sell me for, fuck you think they find me at
Damn right I'm arrogant, I'm gonna need a bigger hat
Close your eyes imagine this, gonna need a bigger safe
I got bills up in that bitch, that bitch stacked up since 98
Let 'em talk, let 'em hate, watch the Lincoln Navigate
If you touch 'em, wipe 'em off
Fingerprints, then take em off
I can make an avalanche and I ain't talkin Chevy trucks
Call me Georgia lottery cause I'll be talkin mega bucks

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cause Bitch I'm amazin'
Must of spent ten grand to make they coupe stand taller
First round draft pick, yea I'm mother fuckin balla
Just write your number down, baby girl I might call ya
If she give it to me now, she won't live to see tomorrow
And if she playin' with it, she won't make it thru the night
Before the song with Kanye, I had my money right
Used to call me vice grips, yea I get my money tight
Now it's time to re up, then I make my money white
You can catch me at my jewel, yeah I like my money bright
You can find me at the lot, yea I like my money fast
Two hundred on the gas, two hundred on the dash
Yea I'm spendin' old money, now I'm livin' in the past

[Hook][Hook: Gucci Mane]
Baby, you don't have to treat me all anti
Why you wanna put me on standby?
I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire
We can stay up all night like vampires
Complement each other like burgers and french fries
In the last minute I done thought about you ten times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside
And every since she left it's like my heart died

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Baby I think you can bring out Gucci's other side
She said, "How you don't you trust me, you did a homicide?"
Then said, "I got a boyfriend who I can't put aside
Even though the grass so much greener on the other side."
And every man like what he can't have
It's funny but I came back
Baby girl so bad, diss me but I ain't mad
Why you wanna tease me?
You should wanna squeeze me
Homie ain't the kid, baby he could never be me
How you wanna go and act anti-social
Bet your man don't know you like I know you, so true
Maybe one day babe you gon get your mind right
And if you looking for me you can find me in Atlanta

[HOOK]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
(Well damn!)
Once upon a time a long time ago
I had a bitch but she felt she had to let me go
Called me and then she came by and said, "Shit
Yeah you got talent but I'm a bad bitch."
But now when I see her shorty whole swag switched
I walk right by her like she don't exist
Her car broke down and it can't get fixed
Her swag broke down and her bag counterfeit
(Well damn!)
That's not Gucci, baby that's floochy
Remember 2000 you was acting all booshie
9 years later and you're best friend choosing
I scooped her in my phantom and I took her to the movies
Gucci don't gotta act anti
Told her she can have me when she want,that's when she fantasized
Told her I can't talk to her cause I got that man pride
Ever since I left baby girl told me her heart died (Gucci!)

[HOOK]

[Verse 3: Mylah]
Excuse me if I sound a little crazy
But just wanna be good to my baby
Cause he been holding me down
And putting it down
He give me everything I don't need no one around
But you're saying you can give it to me better
Get me hot like it's July and I'm rocking a sweater
Just for hitting the road
Would you women let go
Say you got 20/20
Her man's 2004
Maybe I'll give you a try
And keep it low
I could let you ride
Something like a test drive
See baby I ain't so anti

[HOOK][Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
Well, it take money to make money
That's why I make money
Need some today so
I'mma go take they money
Flip money, I weigh money
Hundred grand, that's play money
Counterfeit, that's fake money
Lob city, that's Blake money
Cash money, that's Drake money
Broke niggas, they hate money
Rappers they get slave money
Gucci Mane, I save money
Gamble in your face money
Brick squad we taste money
Gold diggers they chase money
Rich niggas we waste money!
Street smart, I know money
Y'all niggas got no money
Still making that slow money
Ha, cause you owe money
Pimp niggas get ho money
Scared money don't make money
Like Big Meech, I blow money
Y'all niggas is so funny

Hook:
It take money to make money
Anytime you ready x3
Wanna race nigga, wanna gamble?
Anytime you ready x3
Like shopping, like travel?
Anytime you ready x3
I could hit the club and go crazy
Anytime you ready x3

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Got money I said it
Brick Squad we ain't petty
I'm so big headed, hundred eighty grand on my Chevy
Go broke, won't let it
Swag sick can't help it
Financial goals I met it
It's a drummer track an it's epic
I'm a hood nigga with credit
Bills, I don't sweat it
Cash I go get it
But these broke niggas pathetic
Rich niggas go get it
Bitch niggas get jealous
Drop money, I'm careless
It's all mine, I'm selfish
Your money home, you left it
Broke nigga can't help it
Ball hard, I'm wealthy
Thank God I'm healthy
From the jet way to the jet-ski
Aren't you glad you met me?
Haters said they don't like me
But they gotta respect me!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Birdman]
G nigga, about paper

High roller we shot callin'
Real nigga we been ballin'
Pussy nigga catch a sideline and
Watching niggas who both balling
Hustle nigga my own line
Pussy niggas get flat-line
Money nigga, get all the time
New whip, for the sunshine

Cooking up them quarter, niggas
Stepping up them order niggas
Getting it out that water nigga
Rich game, my rich gang nigga
Feline and my wrist game nigga
Weed niggas getting rich game
We the niggas flipping the wrist game
Key nigga, we move blood
Get it from the G blood
Uptown, we feed bloods
Feed a nigga a dope plug

[Hook][Hook: Trey Songz]
It's four in the morning, and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely, cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down
But I'mma beat it up
I'mma beat it up, I-I-I'mma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'mma beat it up
I'mma beat it up, I-I-I'mma beat it up
He can lay it down

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I hop up out my bed
Got my swag on
Scrambled eggs, filet mignon
Two trees blown just for cologne
Money never limited, so icy with benefits
My driver need a passport
All my cars are immigrants
It's so sickenin', history you're witnessin'
I had a girl, she quit me
Now I'm single, wanna get with me?
Sticky cannot stick to me
If you see your chick with Gucci
Think before confronting 'ruly
Ain't my fault your lady choosin'
4:30, still blowin' purpy
O.A. Verdy rollin' dirty
Wardrobe clean, that's just detergent
Got your girlfriend pickin' purses
Say she lonely, Gucci only one way to meet me in person
When she get me home my nigga told me that she love my verses

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Your girlfriend keep callin' me
I feel like she stalkin' me
You at home and she with me
So mornin' it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin' it
Beatin' her down straight poundin' it
Drillin' on your sheets
Got your blanket at the laundromat
Way baby girl throw it back
Old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane now hardly there
Smack it like I'm mad at that
Sweaty sex, so passionate
Oral sex, she mastered that
Pornographic poses like she posin' for the Internet
One hour not finished yet
Never been a minute man
Always been a business man
Got her catching feelings, man
Got a man? Oh really, ma'am?
Actin' like I give a damn
Used to like her, now I don't
Got a real short attention span

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci, Trey Songz, put it on
My shirt off when I perform
She say this her favorite song
She got on my favorite thong
She so hot, too hot to touch
To feel it too much for lames
Gucci Mane, I'm extra clean
So extra rubbers on my brain
Got your main thing screaming Gucci
Every Tuesday night we do it
Wish we could do it more often
But I'm often somewhere flossin'
Lay it down like carpet, Barbie
Aston Martin, double-park it
Beat it like we got a problem
Pop her 'til she call me papa
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin'
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin'
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'

[Hook][Hook x4: Turk]
Blame it on the system, we can't win and we losing
Black a killer, black man, kill a white man, they’re losing him

[Verse 1: Turk]
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
They put a nigga head behind bars and throw the key away
They find you guilty for the charge before you plead the case
Yeah, you’re guilty 'til proven innocent, them bitches snakes
Real talk, dog, know it ain’t fake
You gotta stay strong, homie don’t break
Stay silent nigga, and don’t turn state
I keep it gangsta like a G that’s the only way
I’mma take my lick, no I never been a snitch
I done did time twice, and I'd do this shit again
They say why do ten when you can tell on a friend
Then put you out there so a nigga cut through your head
It’s a dirty world but it still spin
You can’t do nothing about but try to live in it
We’ve been losing don't doubt it, them people still winning
It strikes you out like a diamond, night ended

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Fuck the state jury judge and the victim
All they love to see is me convicted, but I’m mafia connected
He rattin, assault with this rifle is suggested
I’m already won every battle tested
This your warning I won't send another message
The system can’t calm me and the feds can’t catch us!
These hoes can’t break me and these haters can’t stress us
Folks can’t pin any murder to these weapons
They’re tryina give me life, they ain’t tryna give me justice
Bang bang with the gavel, no discussions
We running from the fusses, they’re jumping on who does it
Niggas right back on the block like they wasn't
Could never stop the hustle or the bullet out this muzzle
Pistol grip pump knocking pieces out your puzzle
Pointed at the trial, you must wanna die
You gonna get the business once you stop one foot outside

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Turk]
I caught a charge and the judge try to suck to me
Trying to get me thirty years for the steal, but he couldn’t
He gave me the max, and they send me to max
Twenty three in one what you know about that
It’s hard when you’re black, you don’t stand a chance
Sentence you to death if you kill a white man
In inside man, we’re never right, man
Go to trial, hit your life, shootin dice man
To the police we’re a perfect target
Their main goal is trying to take us out the fucking market
Make you a convict, now you’re starving
Can’t get a job picking cotton cause of your charges
Ain’t nothing changed cause Barack
You’re out your damn frame if you think corruption stop
It still the same man this shit ain't ever stop
You can blame it on the system, don’t blame it on hip hop!

[Hook][Verse 1]

[Hook]
I got-I got-I got-I got so much
So much, so much, so much

[Verse 1]
Quarter million, little nigga, I was nineteen

They don't move that fast, they act like they don't like cheese
Had a couple niggas mad like they don't like me
Is it cause I'm hella paid? I think it might be
Yeah my pockets hella straight
And I smoke so much dope I got OG in my IV
So many niggas jackin' that shit don't even surprise me
I don't even want it back, shit it's off to the good
Can't even say I didn't know you would
Make a little money, get it from the road
Bring that shit back to the hood
Anytime you see me, man I'm on the grind
Nigga wasn't workin' when you knew you should
Now you talk about me when I'm on the road
And when I ride by I'm in the newest one

[Hook X2]
I got so much money I think I should pay for all this
They ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'
I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'
Ain't no way they spend how much they say cause they just bluffin'
I got so much

[Verse 2]
Big money
Even larger crib
No I ain't just stuntin'
That's how I'm supposed to live
I move fast paced
So I drive faster cars
Take a look outside
Those are really ours
And we're really stars
We all travel safe and go really far
In that custom paint, in that suede floor
In that California, that's really hard
In that California, that's what we on
Smell that strong, you know I'm baked
Chances dog, that's what we take
How much you hate, that's what we make
Roll up one, that's what we face
Lot of y'all claim that you real, gon' show up fake
But that shit don't mean a thing
Cause I'll still be on my grind
And stackin' all of this change

[Hook]

[Break]
Don't even gotta ask if I get enough, cause
I got so much
Gin in my cup, twenty-two cones I'mma stuff
Lightin' another one up
(I got-I got-I got-I got so much)
Live it up, every dollar spend it up
Don't even gotta ask if I get enough, cause
(I got so much)
Gin in my cup, twenty two cones I'mma stuff
Lightin' another one up, cause

[Hook]

[Outro]
Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys
Step up your game or step down
Whenever a problem troubles us all
If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow
For there's nothing too much for the great God to do
And all that he asks and expects of you
Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield
Confidence and knowledge that God knows best
And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test
But without God testin' of our soul
It never could reach the ultimate goal
So keep on knowing and believing
All that God has promised you would be yours to receive
Preach, Church, tabernacle
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way[Hook:](x2)

I don't want your girlfriend, homie but my bitch might

[Hook 2x]

I got Caucasian neighbors that's just how I rock
If you talkin' to me, all the questions that I wanna know
If she ain't got no money, know you gotta have some dough
Then she ask me for a drank so I bought a bottle
She was flexin' really hard, now she flexin' harder
You a bitch, one more bitch, I only fuck with starters
So if you ain't a dime piece, ain't no need to bother

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
I want the money, I smell like a pocket full of hundreds
A whole bag full of kush, I been buckin' since a youngin'
I know you need a man right now because you strugglin'
So if he isn't helpin' then there's no need for discussion
In Houston Texas I can spend fifty thousand on a Monday
I got fifty woman with me, fifty more that ain't comin'
My pocket do the conversation, make all the decisions
I only fuck with bad bitches cause I'm very picky
He can't buy a drink so he don't deserve ya digits
I'm polar bear laflare, wrist and ear is very frigid
My charm big as a midget, I give yo' ass the business
So if you got yo' swag right you know that you can get it

[Hook 2x][Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
How I'm going crazy crazy crazy bitch I get it
These bitches popping mollies like the hippies in the 60's
Bring your ass to East Atlanta I don't do deliveries
I'm talking like I'm Tony Montana
Homes ain't killing no children
In Sun Valley with blue new Ballys and
Bricks all under the building
Homegirl said her man getting money
But I ain't seen the nigga I missed it
New Lambo and I'm sitting real low
Sliding riding without my ceiling
Used to be my ho, you can have that ho
My nigga I ain't got no feelings
Before I started rapping, Gucci Mane was selling dope
Her brother want to meet me but I'm steady saying 'no'
Call my phone again, I'mma have to tell 'em 'go'
2 hundred squares, hundred pairs
What's the price - low (Gucci)

[Hook: Yung Fresh]
Bring them things in, bring them things in
When you come, man make sure you have them dividends
Hope you got a whole bunch of hundreds
So I can easily count it
Man I'm going hard, summertime them Forgies mounted
How you doing? Im going stupid, going dumb bitch
I'm a Zone 3 nigga you know I'm on that slum shit
And my nigga from that 6
And he juugin off them bricks
And he fucking with Yung Fresh
And they know the streets is back (hey)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Johnny Dang on my wrist
Cost 'bout a couple bricks
Got Vellanos on my whips
Forgiatos on my whips
Got the .40 on my hip
With 'bout 50 in the clip
Hit the kitchen, hit the strip
Drop some pounds and some zips
Hit the block, sell it here
Hit your block, let it rip
She give me top in that six
Bitch my watch very clear
And my pockets very fat
And I stay spending racks
Spend them stacks, get it back
12 chickens in the back
Migos meet me in the front
Bitch this ain't what I want
Try to play me like a punk
My niggas will leave you slumped
Migos meet me in the front
Bitch this ain't what I want
Try to play me like a punk
My niggas will leave you slumped

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yung Fresh]
Juugin off the mid
On the table is the Sig
Man we got cameras in the front
We see you backing in (I see you nigga hey)
When you come in
Make sure you have them hundreds then
We count dividends
Only conversating if you spend
Super charge straight A
Charger see it on them rims
Bitch I'm fucking head in
You been a real nigga when (when?)
If you wanna buy ten
Come and buy a thirty-six
Charge him thirty-two nicks
That's a five for the drive
Benz top circumcised
And you know the body wide
Glock 9 on my thigh
Hit him right between the eyes
Yung Fresh street nigga
Bitch I'm from the Jack City
Allen Temple riding with me
If you want it come get it (Fresh)

[Hook: Yung Fresh][Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Your boyfriends an alcoholic
But Gucci's a reefer chiefer
Your girlfriends a penis eater
I swear she's a people pleaser
Im purin up two liters
And riding in two seaters
Sippin on mojitos
One mill on my wife beater
Party with white people
I really don't like people
Party tonight
But you must go with the right people
Bigger than life nigga
K with a knife nigga
And he might end his own life
Found out I'm fucking his wife,Leave her
Guccis accustomed to death
Sex with no feelings attatched
Pulled to my bachelor pad
Rari the top is detatched
Bumping
And humping
And jumping
In something
Damn yo girl is one hell of a woman
Telling me something
Then telling me nothing
Got to think about something
To keep me from cumming

[Hook]

I bought out them racks out to play(aye mane)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ok my crib look like Bay Watch
Dont quit your day job
She walking with nothing
But she leaving my tank top
Lately I've been seeing more champagne than raindrops
B.I.G the only thing thats missing is puff saying ,"we can't stop"
Rolling with jigga but I'm not a nets fan
Everything green round me
Like I'm a jets fan
If its green then I burn it
This weed and cash I deserve it
My car and girl both german
Said she's a ____
I need a surgeon
I be running to the money
And I feel like I'm racing a turtle,Squirtle
Boy I got so rich so early
Swear I gave my money a curfew
Now all of ya niggas alert you
Because I got the bitch you can't tame
Drunk off pussy and champagne
And you ain't gonna do a damn thang

[Hook]

Most these niggas try but they can’t do it
That’s unlikely
Know this when you see the work
You know that is unlikely
A replicated imitation, you can’t beat me slightly
You know soon as you hear the track
No question mark or might be
I’m bishop they buy me, I’m off the hook, off the hook
Got these niggas in check mate, off the hook, off the hook
Bitch I’m bout the turnt up, let them lamers burn up
Niggas ain’t got my work at the dawn
Hustling till the sun up
Continue to set the standards, rearrange the plans
Ever since I’ve been in, I’ve been stacking them brands
From a …off, like firecrackers, I’m too hot to tame
For the e way, I’m rolling out, just stay out of my lane
[Hook] x 2
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t what
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
When I slow down they say speed it up
When I speed up they say slow it down
I’m money bound
I’m so high, I could eat a cloud
Mister child, y’all … your girl is so thirsty now
My man swag like … every verse is a murder trial
Versatile, style on top of style on top of style yeah
When I say I hop the I stand for eye lens
When I fly, no eye temps, when I land, I buy them
New clothes, your hoes, ain’t shit, I’ll buy them
Dollar signs my eyes lids, now I see the big picture
HD, flat screens, TV's, same size as Paul Pierce
And ain’t no comparing us, man we do it major
And if they ain’t talking bout shit
Tell them eat so toilet paper
[Hook] x 2
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t what
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me
