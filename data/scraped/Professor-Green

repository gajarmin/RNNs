[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I’m not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, oh

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Nothing to hide, stifle or smother
Suffered and cried, strife made me tougher
Never mumbled or shy to trouble I rise above all
Expectations forget rep
Ain’t never begged yet
When I wanted to get pence hustle
To be I am exactly what my neck says
That sket said I tried to cash in on my Dad's death
I wanted to vent but I never said fuck all
After all you were never kin to me
Family is something that you never been to me
In fact making it harder for me to see my father
Was the only thing that you ever did for me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
(Dear Dad)
As a kid I looked up to you
Only thing was I never saw enough of you
The last thing I said to you was I hated you
I loved you and now it's too late to say to you
Just didn't know what to do and how to deal with it
Even now deep down I'm still livid
To think I used to blame me
I wonder what I did to you to make you hate me
I wasn't even 5, life's a journey and mine wasn't an easy ride
You never even got to see me rhyme
I just wish you woulda reached out
I wish you would have been round when I been down
I wish that you could see me now
Wherever you are I really hope you found peace
But know that if I ever have kids
Unlike you I'll never let them be without me

[Hook]

(I write songs I can't listen to
Everything I have to give to you
And everyone of these lines I sing to you)

[Bridge: Professor Green]
My job's more like public service
My life just became yours to read and interpret
If you heard it and come across a lot different at times
I throw fits when I read how they word things
You see me smile
Now you're gonna have to see me hurting
Cause pretending everything is all right
When it ain't, really isn't working

[Hook]

[Outro: Professor Green]
I ain't censoring myself for nobody
I'm the only thing I can be
All that is good, all that is bad, all that is, me

[Hook][Hook: Tori Kelly]
All the times I have laid in your light
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time, I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
It's been a while since I last dreamt
Barely remember what it's like to dream
Finding it hard to get to sleep, too stressed
And there ain't anyone to sing a lullaby to me
Pretend shit doesn't get to me
And I suffer in silence when I'm hurting
A man's problems are his own
And it's my burden
Tossing and turning, trying to get to sleep
But I find it hard to switch off when my mind's working
I ponder on things I shouldn't bother with
Off the rails, my train of thought's wandering
Sick of pretending to be so happy
All the while my anxiety eats away at me
My skin crawls, I look up to the sky
And it falls, the walls close in and it's
As if all the good in my life disappears
In an instant, happiness is so distant
So seeing the ones who I love, the ones who love me
But I don't wanna tell em how I feel in case they judge me
It's just me, wish I could let somebody in
But I ain't ever been too trusting

[Hook: Tori Kelly]

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I've barely had any sleep when I get up
Sick of all these nightmares and these night terrors
Like it's only when I'm leathered that I sleep better
Might sleep better when I get up, I'm weak
It just makes my day harder, I wonder if
It would've been any different if I had a father that I knew
Could it have helped shape the way that I grew?
But the point of things I never have went from
Being a reason for the things that I do
To just being an excuse that I'd use
I've gotta take responsibility for the things I do
Find something other than negativity for my fuel
But I feed off it, even when I don't seem bothered
I hide everything that's going on inside
Guess it's been a while since I've been honest, I need help
But I deny it and even lie to myself like I'm fine

[Hook: Tori Kelly]

[Bridge: Professor Green]
I just wish someone would tell me it would be OK
But pessimism leads me to believe that it won't
To see even a glimmer of hope in the darkness
Is hard and depression is a slippery slope
I don't wanna do what my dad did with a rope, though
So I carry on even though it's hard to
The only thing that's definite is death and things always change
As long as you give em a chance to

[Hook: Tori Kelly]

(Can you sing me a last lullaby?)

[Hook: Tori Kelly][Verse 1: Jamie Oliver]
My name is Jamie Oliver, I'm here to say
I wanna talk about Food Revolution Day
Half the world is starving with too little to eat
And the other half die from being obese
How people live the longest is they grow and they cook
Learn recipes from your parents or books
If you haven't got a clue about the mess that we're in
The answer lies here in the words that we sing

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & Jazzie B]
Revolution
Feed the kids right through their stomach and minds
Revolution
They deserve a better future but some people are blind
It's a revolution
Educate the nation with a song and a vision
Revolution
Come on everybody, do the right thing, sign the petition

[Verse 2: Alesha Dixon & Hugh Jackman]
People in charge aren't getting it right
Politicians don't know and now they need to shed light
Don't rely on the government to fix this plight
No country in the world has ever won this fight
We're the only ones who can save our lives
Click the link below for the petition to sign
It doesn't take time so you need to just bear it
Do the right thing, sign it, share it

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, Professor Green, Alesha Dixon & Hugh Jackman]

[Verse 3: George The Poet]
Yeah, we all have a friend
Someone who's there from the start to the end
Someone who's there through the good times and the worse of it too
And guess what? That person is you
So from now on when you wake up, first thing you do
Make yourself a promise that you'll eat better food
We better do what we can, this better reach somebody
Why? Cause you only get one body

[Bridge: Professor Green & Jazzie B]
Don't give up your day job, Jamie
I'm only joking, mate
It's all for a good cause
We need a revolution, not devolution
Think of bad nutrition
This is a revolution
People, can you see? Come on now

[Chorus](x2)[Intro: J Spades]
Ladi dadi (Slick Rick)
We likes to party
We don't cause trouble
We don't bother nobody (the beat boss)

[Hook: J Spades]
These bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, nigga, yeah I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
Sick Rick, nigga, yeah I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, Slick Rick
Bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, Slick Rick
Niggas be watching cause I'm Slick Rick

[Verse 1: J Spades]
Head Nigga in Charge
East London, call me big darg
Where I come from, niggas don't live long
Had to sell drugs for my income
Spent ten years in Kingston
Then I catch a flight, come-a England
Name ring bells like ding dong
Cause I'm stepping on the city like King Kong
Yo, rappers wanna link up
Boy, you're doing everyting wrong
Millions of bars on the F64s
But you can't make a big song
Now it's my phone them a ring, don
Tryna get my style and my lingo
Cause the word on the roads is Spades gonna blow
And they're waiting for my single
Nigga lick the jackpot like bingo
Popping like Pringles
Beating up your gyal when you link up
Cause bad bitches are in tow
Now you know I'm old school like Flintstones
Now you know how the ting go
Well my niggas let the ting go
Everybody haffi breeze like window

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I spit spit some slick shit
Bitch, I'm Slick Rick
I drive crisp whips, getting to mischief
Or mit fix big spliffs
I take it all down, I don't sip sip
Between an Inbetweener and a Misfit
5'9", but like 6'6"
I did your free download and went skip, skip
Nigga, why you fronting? Why you lying in The Mirror
Like you should've been the one when you know you never was?
Fuck a nigga, thinkin' he can never criticise
And he thinking if he don't, man, you know he ain't a boss
Cause they ain't us
And we ain't them (I hate them niggas)
Amen, amen, amen
Could've sprayed a spade, I brought J Spades
An ace of spades cause nigga, we making waves
Same tracksuit 50 Shades of Grey
Now I'm tailor-made, amazing grace
So fuck it, let a nigga be selfish
Fuck it, let a nigga be Elvis
Now the whole world my oyster
Fuck it, let a nigga eat shelfish
Lucky I ain't never had to sell shit
Cause it's trouble when you've gotta be the eldest
Now I'm in a shop on some Pharrell shit
Buying velvet at Selfridge, I can't help it, selfish
We the top boys in the area
All of my dogs and my terrier
Come see me with your biggest CD
When you've had a top 10 up in America, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
I could be up in the club with my jewellery on
But I'd rather be at home with a Blu-Ray on
Fuck, I've owned the club, fuck, I've owned the beer
Fuck, I've owned enough so what the fuck I crying for?
What the fuck I rhyme for? I'll tell you why
Cause the crib ain't big enough until I need to take an elevator
Just so I can get up to the ninth floor
See, money's something I've got an addiction to
The more I got, the more the addiction grew
It's like a sickness, tell the doctor I need an appointment
And probably a prescription too
And it'll get ripped in two
I like being this sick, it's what I spit for
Die for what I live for, been foul, but I'm rich now
So what am I still getting shit for?
I got arrested tryna protect my wife
A reprobate, got reprimanded and was read my rights
Wasn't the best of nights
Subsequently I got dropped by Puma
But ever the optimist, I try and look at the positives
At least I get to wear my Nikes
I'd beware my chatter cause I'm harder
And tell Akala I am a racist, I hate white rappers

[Hook][Produced by ISHi]

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Time to get that profit all in
Won't rest 'til all my niggas rocket ballin'
I don't even think I stopped this mornin'
I'm the nigga that usually gets them what's it called's in
I'm caught, when it's time to get that shoppin' sorted
Oh, this Armani blazer, bitch I got imported
Yeah I like that whip
Because I'm on the bands, only reason I ain't dropped that forty
Hot chicks see me on the streets and they stop and call me
Want me to get my willy out so they can toss it for me
Got 'em goin' topless for me
When she pop it for me, really got me horny
Record label contract, my lawyers got it for me
Dotted all the I's and the T's, can you cross 'em for me?
You can try and put your crosses on me
I don't watch hate, I got shooters that'll watch it for me

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I'm heavy, I'm colder
Better me, no sir
I could tear apart MC's, but I'd rather read
A book on childcare by Kerry Katona
No niceness, I ran out of it, dumb it down a bit
Ain't somethin' I'm prepared to do
Well I ain't ever gonna run out of lip
Here's somethin' I prepared for you
I tried to relax
But being spaced it inspires me back
When will I be nice to Katie Price?
The day I see a cage fighter in drag, ah
I don't want a tomorrow without friction
Jump in to beef, both feet first
And make pros eat their words
And sit and watch 'em swallow their own dic-tion

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, Ishi distort that bass
Man grew up on a raw estate
Now, everytime I draw my dates
They're like, how the fuck d'you afford this place
First place, first place, first place
Try act up dem man will address that, call it
Put a fuckin' man in his place
Bitch I'm great, for goodness sake
I ain't gotta queue cause they know my face
Girls took my watch tryin' to wind up on me
I was like I ain't got time to waste, get it?
I ain't got time to waste, get it?
Try and get hype in my face, regret it
Got a big pitbull and I don't remember the last time I fed it
So don't upset it

[Verse 4: Devlin]
Let me grieve for the beat before I murder it
Don't know my name? By now you should've heard of it
Why, cause I'm murderin' anybody lurking in
Close proximity, circlin'
Will make an example of men when I stride in
Dev's has got a tiny temper
I'm observing this, learning
But now I'm just yearning to burn it, I'll fire your agenda
Lock me up, might high risk offender
Make a man turn on his own team like an Irish defender
I'm a rhymin' inventor that's climbin' up heights you're not meant to
The game's over, so roll over
I'm sober, but I'll still kidnap a so called soldier
And bolt in the Rover to Dover
Yeah it's over, the game's over

[Verse 5: Example]
Put up ya' lighters, I clash the Titans
Fight the fighters, Mike fight the biters
Spit to my throat, got tonsillitis
That's on a Monday mornin', ha
Takin' over, run straight past ya'
No warnin', a real disaster
Harder, faster, stronger, longer
This one here was top of the classroom
Stop the lecture, drop the pressure
Never say never, but nevertheless I
Never say no to experiments
Whether it's tenements, clubs, yards, spittin' with eloquence
Positive sentiments
Havin' a hell of a time and it's evident
Don't question my relevance
I've started on this so I'm back in my element

[Verse 6: Chipmunk]
Uh, I open my mouth, niggas panic
The jewels are liabilities, mmm, I'm the asset
Underdogs are barkin' up, shh hush puppy
My new chain's got red and blue ice man
I call it my slush puppy
Yeah, let me clap them with the reminder flow
I was best newcomer, err, time ago
Yeah, you've all passed ya' sell by date to me
I'm different nigga, I sell out when you add a venue and date to me

[Hook: Tinchy Stryder]
Now it's game over
Kick him out the team, I heard he's snaking, he's a cobra
Could have lived the dream but now ya' days are done, it's over
Should have never schemed and now your looking for a shoulder, to lean on
To wipe your tears on, it's over

[Verse 7: Tinchy Stryder]
They better let me go, let me loose
I'm frozen cold, my veins are blue
Hell to home, but it's Satan proof
Good as gold, my angels flew
Yo, they can't knock down mine
Cuffs on flows I lock down lines
I am not human, real life mutant
Ask Mick Foley, I'm not mankind
Yeah, look under my eyelids
All red, I bleed through the iris
Like I've been toking on weed, highest
Now my brain's on freeze, minus
Yeah I ain't letting it melt
I'm stark, haze, I'm letting it fill
Sideline this now separate that
I'm stayin here I ain't lettin' it gel, ill[Intro]
Driving a German whip
Driving a German whip
Yo!

[Hook: Meridian Dan x2]
If you see man driving a German whip
Blacked out window, leaning back
See man driving a German whip
Look like a baller, Ps and that
I don't kick ball, do I look like a baller?
See man driving a German whip
Who told you I move like pauper?
See man driving a German whip

[Verse 1: Skepta]
See man driving a German whip, nah, but I ain't leaning back
Windows down when I'm cruising past, I be like "guten tag!"
Man better know that it's me in this car, first MC that you see in this car
Brand new CLA, gun metal grey, feds looking at me like I shouldn't be in this car
Blud, I could take this old school, me and Dan broke, sitting on a cold wall
Now I'm in a showroom and the car's got a sheet on it, looking like a kid that don't wanna go school
Like Jme I've gotta stack paper, so I signed my life to the music
I was in a Smart Car, now my car's stupid, German whip but I ain't in Munich

[Hook: Meridian Dan]

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I have got a German whip, my whip is German, my whip is the sickest
When I'm reversing is the only time when I drive that I ever abide by the speed limit
Ooh, am I raw, like driving fast? You and I both
Swear down I could have sworn I just saw Brian Harvey in a car with suicide doors
I was just out driving, nearly hit a lady and her shopping
Wait a minute, hold on, wasn't that? Oh my God, it was Katie Hopkins
I reversed and I hit her, but then I woke up from my dream
Shame it wasn't for real, guess I still get a little defensive if anyone says anything about Lil

[Hook: Meridian Dan]

[Verse 3: Bossman Birdie]
Rings on the front, rings on the back
Whip that German, leaning back
And I ain't talking 'bout the trap, but I still got Ps and that
Knock off the tint, fishbowl ting
Skengman mode, Frisco ting
Light up your head, Sisqó ting
See the Bloodline, yeah we go in
Can't talk to me about torque, if you're driving less than a sport
Don't talk to me about brake horse
If the car's slow you might as well walk
Chrome exhaust, look like a baller, yeah of course
German whip I can't go off course
Tell them man they better know who's boss

[Hook: Meridian Dan]

[Verse 4: Gnarly Ventura (Rizzle Kicks)]
When I drop an album, ring the chauffeur, straight drive the whip round
When you drop an album, man are so poor that you need a whip round
Skepta knows I don't follow anybody, I drive my life by choice
Sunk my teeth right into the game when I found a biting point
Yeah, brain to mouth, mouth to mic, mic the track and you listen
Yeah, what I'm saying is that I drove from 0 to top 10 in around three minutes
I don't push or pedal but I still accelerate, break that limit
A lot of my friends still sell Class-As, but I'm sitting in an A-Class singing

[Hook: Meridian Dan x2][Intro Maverick Sabre]
I see no point in living life that right
So I just take what I can find
I see no point in living life that right

[Hook]
When you're out here in this jungle
It's wild round here, you don't wanna spend a night round here
When you're out here in this jungle, ain't nothing nice around here
Trouble's what you find around here
When you're out here in this jungle, in this jungle
You're always caught in this struggle, in this jungle
But you keep asking for trouble
You love, you love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way

[Verse 1 Professor Green]
Welcome to Hackney
A place where I think somebody's been playing Jumanji
A Manor where men are like animals
And they'll yam on you like they yam on food
Cats with claws that'll stab a youth, act bad and catch a slap or two
We don't applaud success, all we clap are tools
London ain't cool to cruise through where the hunters prey
Looking to lunch today
And your chains looking like fresh fruit to a hungry ape
They'll eat on you, then laugh about it like Hyenas do
So stick to breezing through, like Cheetah's do, or be a piece of food

[Hook]

[Verse 2 Professor Green]
It's blitz admist the strife here, got kids with sticks and knifes here
It's hype here, we know no different prick;
It's just life here, life the way we know from young the way we're shown
Stacked trapped in flats where our front doors don't face the road
Got CID spinning round in cars, shifting criminals at large
It's hard, not to think the bits are just a bing without the bars
Jealousy's what the cheddar brings
For the cheddar it's anything goes
Low enough to rob newlyweds for their wedding ring

[Bridge- Maverick Sabre]
Every day is warring, never give a warning
Violence is the only way you settle things
Every day is hating, money that I'm making
Jealous cause I'm moving on to better things
Every day is fighting, rolling in the night now
All you do is watch everyone else get far, you say that life is hard
When you're out here in this jungle

[Hook][Hook: Miles Kane]
Are you getting enough?
Are you getting enough?
Are you getting enough?
Ahh yeah
Are you getting enough?
Are you getting enough?
Are you getting enough?
Ahh yeah

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
You want for it, feel for it
Rob for it, steal for it
Shot for it, deal for it
Pop for it, kill for it
Some are born with it, some are born without
Can hardly afford what they’re forking out
Time is money, talk is cheap
Money talks, what we talking about?
Piggishness edacity poverty born depravity
Gluttony over luxuries all ravenous voracity
Insanity avidity salacity lust
Anything I want I need for me to have it’s a must

[Bridge: Miles Kane]
You're draining my blood

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I shop therefore I am, I am therefore I shop
Until I drop, I will not stop
‘Til I cop everything I want
I spend money I ain't got
Anything I want I get
I buy what I want, period
I don't really mind if I'm in the red
Credit cards, debit cards, store cards, more cards
The poor pay while the rich are spending
It's all as is intended
Can you feel it heating up?
Can you feel the climate change?
In our eyes you see the hunger
All you feed’s a primal rage

[Hook: Miles Kane]

[Bridge: Miles Kane]
Keep on, keep on
Keep on chasing money
Keep on, keep on
Keep on chasing money
Keep on, keep on
Keep on chasing money
Keep on, keep on
Keep on chasing money

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
The mad man with his megaphone said we can only serve one master
We’re consumed by social evils and all what we lust after
Satisfaction ain't for sale, and we’re all going to Hell
But who were we supposed to hail to, when we don't know our father?

[Hook: Miles Kane]She was on her way home, he was lying in wait
Insistance from others had never led her astray
She had a good day
Was persuaded by summer air to walk instead of getting the train
A decision so innocent, as innocent as she
Uncorrupted so innocent and sweet
An innocence interrupted by an incident
A dissonance, two people so different in belief
She came from the depths and ascended
Bumped into he who demented
Intent on inflicting the same pain that been led
The decision made by he, for she had never consented
An unprovoked and most venomous attack
He took from her that which she can't get back
And left her with that that she can't get rid of
Which is why whenever it's time for lift out
She...

She builds a rocket out of stars in her spoon
Straps up, the only way to make it to the moon
Dear god, I hope you haven't forgot
This young brave astronaut

A habit she never wanted
A pain she needed numbing
And she'd rather feel nothing than the pain
An evening she can't forget
Memories she can't stomach
Not for nothing but a needle in her vein
Friends she ignored till the phone stopped ringing
Till her door stopped knocking
Her door she only opens to let him in
But she has no money so she lets him come
You can take that either way

A window she rarely opens so she can see the day
Her stove she only uses to heat her spoon
For her the only way she can reach the moon
She builds a rocket out of stars in her spoon
Straps up, the only way to make it to the moon
Dear god, I hope you haven't forgot
This young brave astronaut

Looking up, looking up, looking up for the young brave astronaut
Give it up, give it up, give it up for the young brave astronaut
I know that you're busy but any time you got
God please make a visit
To the young, to the young, to the young
To the young brave astronaut

She opens the window for a glimpse out
And heats a spoon over the stove
Feels a familiar sting and then slips out
With a window that isn't quite closed
With the window open and the stove still lit
Along with the rain came a gust of wind
Which blew the fire out
Gas still running and her still breathing the gas in

She builds a rocket out of stars in her spoon
Straps up, the only way to make it to the moon
Dear god, I hope you haven't forgot
This young brave astronaut[Intro]
(Ahh mate)
I'm back
Like I never left
I'm here at your in-convenience
I'm back
Like I never left
I'm here at your in-convenience

(So Steve, Steve. Where did you grow up?
Upper Clapton, Hackney
(How old were you when you first started rapping?)
I was 18
(Who are your major influences?)
Are you serious?
Your mum
I ain't answering anymore of your questions
You know what? I have a question

[Verse 1]
Whose idea was it to get in the charts
By rhyming over Hungarian dance mu-sic?
And why would I make dance mu-sic
When I can't dance to it?
I'm the anecdote to that shit
Bringing back this rap shit
Soon as I'm done calling this bulimic a fat bitch
I'll be saving the day and renegade with a dog playing fetch
Watching him chase a grenade (pow)
Maybe I should play the same game with Bruno
If I ever again get mistaken for a Cluedo character
I'm gonna have to unleash some amateur judo
I just took a shit and now I can't find any loo roll
Two flows for everyone that you got, too hot, I do squat
Diddily and do more than you do when you do lots, do lots
Do women do for me what they do not do for you?
Maybe it's got something to do with my new watch

[Hook]
(I'm back) I'm back
(Like I never left) like I never left
(I'm here at your) I'm here at your
(In-convenience) in-convenience
(I'm back) I'm back
(Like I never left) like I never left
(I'm here at your) I'm here at your
(In-convenience) in-convenience

[Verse 2]
I have a question
Why would I beat around the bush or take the scenic route?
When I'm a meanie born to instigate fumes
I'm the morning, midday and evening news
And I started a trend, Mike got his teeth fixed too (Mike Skinner)
If you're wondering where I've been at, kicked back with a six-pack
Of Beck's on a bench, sunbathing in a hijab
Give me a Tic-Tac, I just had a pack of Nik Naks
Thanks now I'll turn you into a kebab with my pick-axe
Mish, mash, mosh pit, whenever I drop shit it's hot shit
I just won a race with an ostrich
Obnoxious, preposterous, looney, a damn nutter
If I ever see Rooney anywhere near my grandmother (ah!)
I live life without an ounce of logic
I like my wrist so much I spent a house deposit on it
Vomit and then I drink more wine
Then I broke a bowl and hope the hospital gives me morphine
How do you spend your time?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I don't have a question, nope
When it comes to competition I'm burying them
Better to bury them then have them getting lairy again
They want it with me like they want it with malaria
Like Wayne Bridge wants to be John Terry'd again
I developed an obsession with Caroline Flack
I wouldn't mind having a go on Caroline's-
Actually I promise to never be so vulgar
To never mention putting my cobra
Inside of Anna Kournikova
I swear

[Hook]

[Outro]
I think I've got it out of my system now
(You sure?)
I am once again ready to answer questions
(Good, cause there's so much I've been wanting to ask you)
About 8 inches
(What?)[Verse 1: Professor Green]
It's time to even it up
I guess a round table weren't equal enough
You can't contain me with chains, I'm free and I run free
Any enemy is coming with me when I'm done
Whatever's asked of me I've performed
I rid through the rain into the eye of the storm
Still carrying the flame, I've the torch
Failure comes at a price I can't afford
Never been half-hearted, I put my all in
Forfeited all just to answer my calling
Wearing the scars of the wars that I fought in
Should've been heading for the stars but I'm falling

[Hook: Sierra Kusterbeck]
I have your sword and cape
If you need them, I'll be swimming in the lake
Oh baby, don't look down
Just take the crown
We'll be kings forever, ooh
Holding on together, ooh
Feeling so much better, ooh
When everything was wrong, and everything was gone, we ran to Avalon

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
Fought till I had no fight left, risked my death
Walked with conviction in everyone of my steps
My strengths water enough, to wash away any of the stains on my rep
Yeah, I fought off vultures, when against odds when I was short on soldiers
I asked not for my burden to be lightened but if I may have broader shoulders
So as I may carry the weight
All the doubt I had in me has been allayed
So from now till the day that I'm carried away
I will never walk around what stands in my way
Fuck if they ain't letting up, because neither will I
When I die from the ashes an eagle will rise
As long as my blade and my faith will keep me alive
Fear ain't something that you'll see in my eyes

[Hook: Sierra Kusterbeck]
We'll be kings forever, ooh
Holding on together, ooh
Feeling so much better, ooh
When everything was wrong, and everything was gone, we ran to Avalon
We ran to Avalon

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
I left competition out for the count, no abacus
Fought for the crown, thwart thy challengers
When my massacre was ordained I remained
And through pain forged my sword
I left competition out for the count, no abacus
Fought for the crown, thwart thy challengers
When my massacre was ordained I remained
And through pain forged my sword
My Excalibur

[Hook: Sierra Kusterbeck]
We'll be kings forever, ooh
Holding on together, ooh
Feeling so much better, ooh
When everything was wrong, and everything was gone...
We'll be kings forever, ooh
Holding on together, ooh
Feeling so much better, ooh
When everything was wrong, and everything was gone, we ran to Avalon
We ran to Avalon
We ran to Avalon

[Outro: Professor Green]
You know it's been said that
The damaged become dangerous because
We know we can survive[Intro]
See it all started the other day
I was smoking and, you know
Thinking to myself all deeply, you know
How you do sometimes when you smoke weed
You start thinking too deeply and it all gets a bit scary
Anyway, I'm just getting back to the point which is
I was thinking about how if I were to die
Have I done everything that I would really like to do
And I haven't
So this is a list of everything I'd like to do before I die...

[Verse 1]
I want a number one in the chart's
Before I pass and can ask
If Lulu if she regrets having her chest
Enhanced with implants
I wanna get my teeth straightened
To make me more handsome
Make friends with Hugh Hefner
And go on a long break to the playboy mansion
See before I die, before I leave earth
Before I'm put inside of a coffin and burnt
I want to grow till I am old of age
And smoke till I am old and grey
Till I'm 60 with a spliff
Trying to kick a flow on stage
Still drunk in the club
Looking for sluts with a zimmer frame
Plus a pocket full of viagra
Just to keep my dick up straight
I want to see my bank account grow
Get my cash and go
To las vegas rich and come back bankrupt and broke
Before I come blaze I know
With biggy, big pun, pac and big earl
I want fame and to play with 6 girl's
6 cuties (come here)
With thick booty's in a jacuzzi
Chung two E's
Listening to juicy truthfully

[Hook]
Before I die, I wanna be rich, I wanna be famous
Nah, I wanna be a superstar
Before I die, I want chicks, my wrists slit with bracelets
A few cars and two huge yards
Before I die, I want a car with massaging seats
Gold bath taps, and before I die I want a ménage à six
Before I die, before I die
I've got a lot of living left to do before I die

[Verse 2]
I want to make a mill
And find out just how real fake titties feel
But with an attitude like mine
I might not die, I might get killed
Anyway, before I die
I wanna drive a Ferrari
And a Harley
Go on safari
Withdraw a million pound coins from barclays
Just for the sake of it
Just so I can say I did
So you can get in a raged hate and say that I take the piss
I don't care, why would I?
This is what I wanna do
I'm talking about me
So why would I give a fuck about you!
At some point I wanna give up the weed
Have a kid and be the dad to my son my father never was for me
Maybe even invest some cash
For the kids that I'm yet to have
And a little stash of cash
For the lawyers for the necks that I'm yet to snap
Before I take my bow
I gotta do Amsterdam
And get higher than I've ever been
They call me evergreen
I got leaves all year round
I pop pills and smoke so stop debating
So if I don't die of intoxication
I'd at least like to be intoxicated

[Hook][Hook: Professor Green]
Before I die, I wanna be rich, I wanna be famous
Nah, I wanna be a superstar
Before I die, I want chicks, my wrists slit with bracelets
A few cars and two huge yards
Before I die, I want a car with massaging seats
Gold bath taps, and before I die I want a ménage à six
Before I die, before I die
I've got a lot of living left to do before I die

[Verse 1: Ghetts]
Before I'm in the graveyard, I want a mil for eight bars, I want a bitch from Babecast
Then I'll have a dick that stays hard, I don't wanna star in a flick like Braveheart
I take charge, I want ten bikes, eight cars, and a great yard
That ain't far from the hood but still it's off-radar, I wanna make history
Put my face in the hall of fame, and I ain't gonna leave Earth till I talk to Damien
It's analyse each word, bought a Range and I ain't ever done a week's work, I wanna free Mercs
And ghost-write for the guy with the weak verse, if I drop from the top, I wanna fall feet-first
I wanna bring back the T-birds, print "fuck feds" on my T-shirt, I'll make love to a Greek nurse
Before I'm in the cemetery, I wanna watch all the films out the 70s
I've tried but I fell asleep - so did my dad, so I guess it's hereditary
I still wanna fuck Emily, [?], never had chemistry
But now she belling me, before I'm in a box, I wanna do a tour of the rock
Right now I'll be bored on the block, still got a few score on my socks
And I'm still at war with the cops, so before I die, I'mma hold my 45 high
Pull the trigger back, hit a pig in black
Then kidnap a rat, it's a fact, it's of that now I'm kicking back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Plan B]
Before I die, when I'm flat on my back looking up at the sky
Which I can't see because I'm blind, as well as deaf, out of breath, coughing up blood from my chest cause
My lungs are fucked from all the fags I've smoked, still be thinking about how many slags I've poked
Now I wanna poke more, even though I'm dying and my throat's sore
Cause I'm raw to the core of the apple, with a worm in it, I want a womb so I can put sperm in it
Even though I'm 63 and I can't take a pee without feeling like I'm burning it
My dick over a naked flame, I just want a naked dame
With a makeshift name, like Tila Tequila
That bitch from New Orleans with big fake tits like Jordan's
These MySpace girls, they boring, only good for one thing: that's balling
So even when I'm terminally ill and I've lost all my sex appeal
Let me let you all know what's real, what I'm spitting right here's my will
So when you see me on road when I'm old with a bald patch on my head
A hearing aid in my ear with a guide dog near, lying on the floor looking like I'm dead
Just remember what I said I wanna do before I die
And get a fat ugly bitch to sit on my dick, it won't matter to me cause I'm blind

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Narstie]
Before I die, hold the medi, keep it steady, choom de la la
Mix the neckle with chocolate Thai, get high
Before I die, I'mma link Elton John with a hardback yardie
He's gonna say "hello hi", and she's gonna say "what?" and come fuck me
Had it with Versace cutlery, and a rug from Argos
"Narstie you're moving fam, you're going far cuz"
Tried love but I'm not quite there, I'm still finding it hard to get rain from Britney Spears
By the way, Gary's got too much glitter: leave the kids alone
Talking about nonces, I wanna catch Ian Huntley
Feed him to a staff called Mutley, in the Evening Standard
Back to before I die: rizlas, fags and po po
I'mma get high, go evil, make zeros wow, scared: I'mma get by
New creps, 2-steps, I'mma step fly, man step heavy fam, never step shy
I'm more happy than a Happy Meal, looking for a happy deal, here's a happy slap, how does happy feel?
So as you can see, I am a mad guy
So before I go, I'mma teach the Queen gang signs

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Example]
The other day I had a drink with The Reaper, we talked about "what if I was six feet deeper?"
What would I change in all of my days to have had a sex life just a little bit sweeter?
I said "Not much really as it happens, plenty of slappers, had a lot of luck
Stuck a bottle up a girl having drunk all the wine, straight from her belly button, snorted a line
Very next day, done practically the same to the girl's best friend and I didn't feel shame
Both found out they were part of a spree, they attacked each other but they didn't hurt me"
The Reaper said "I've studied your movements, it would seem to me there's room for improvement
That story there would impress a few - a rapper, eh? Is that the best you can do?
Same situation but put it on a plane, in the first class section, perfection's game
Take your pick from the air stewardesses, lock off the cabin, remove their dresses
GHB can replace the gack, or make things slick if you abuse the crack
Bottles up vaginas are fine if you're entertaining, but use champagne
Not wine and you'll find that the bubbles excite em, the pleasure is heightened, believe me
You'll be closer to heaven, and to finish with style, parachute from the plane like you're 007"
You can't beat that for originality, everything you dreamt of, make reality
I thought I'd done it all but I've missed all sorts, before I'm a corpse, there's so much to see

[Hook][Hook: Smurfie Syco]
Be like me
Be like me
Be Snoop Dogg, the one you wanna be like
Yeah, the one you wanna look like, talk like, act like
Dress like, feel like, smell like, taste like, work like me!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it like me!
You gonna be like me, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Be like me

[Verse 1: Snoop Dog]
Wake up in the morning blaze you a .. how you feel like me?
But I can do this like seven days a week
And I probably won't get no sleep!
Why you talking, we'll be walking up and down the street
Look at my name, we're in the game...
You would, but you can't cause...
Check my... I've been .. getting wild
Mother fuckers out here get me down
On the block, with the clock, pocket full of bedrock
Jump in the back with.. cause he hold me down...

[Hook]
Be like me
Wanna be like me
I see you wanna be like me
A lot of ya wanna be like me

[Verse 2: P Money]
And you wanna be like me, cause my flow educates...
I'mma quit with a fool gravity
When I spit loud the crowd hovers around and levitates
You're here when the two lips separate
Excruciate pain when it penetrates
You're in the wrong team
Trust my team to make you drop the heaviest shit like a belly ache
This ain't the mind you can educate
I can relax for 20 minutes the meditate
Then put you in a tune and do you worst Slim Shady did to Jay-z on renegade
And I don't pop champagne when I celebrate
To fly like me you might need to get a plane
I'm in the club with diamonds and "???" hearts
???

[Hook]X2

[Verse 3: D Double E]
Uhuu, that's ...
If you try for a..
Then we gonna be in trouble...
Don't get your mind in a puzzle
..don't wear no muzzle
..seven days a week a hustle
Seven days a week I grind, could have ben that
Could have been blind...
Be like when...
What's yours is yours, what's mine is mine
..I'm gonna rap for the...
I'll be flying more times than a ...

[Hook]X2

[Verse 4: Professor Green]
So I'm the one you wanna be like
Cause I flow hard, P R
O, F E Double S O R
Women coming in two, when they say noahs Ark
Ain't been fed so believe I'm starving
Blessed, but when I'm back I'm...
That man don't flow like, don't smoke like P
..don't roll that weed!
..the bless king
So when you're touch done you know who to holla at if you want a pengting
You know who you need ....

[Hook]X2[Verse 1: Professor Green]
A little birdy told me that I need to clean up
Remove the C, the L, the N and the A
Then put a D after the E and that's me, blud
How you mean, blud?
Sorry for complicating things, what I mean is I'm E'd up
Oh my god, Stephen, that's enough
Oh my lord, these are good
All I wanna hear now's Ebeneezer Goode
A little something to remind me of the 90s
Back when Es were good
I don't think I ever wanna leave the shubs

[Pre-Hook: Professor Green]
All I need now is somebody's daughter
Nothing could put me in a foul mood
Just lost 3 quid on a bottle of water
But I don't mind because I just found you

[Hook: Whinnie Williams]
I can't dance without you
You know, I never could
You always have this special way
Of making life feel good
I can't dance without you
Although I know I should
You always have this special way
Of making life feel good

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I'm in a raving mood, wading through
The crowd while they're playing my favourite tune
Favourite tune? OK, I'm lying
I don't know the name of the song that I'm raving to
A raving loon, as long as I've got music
I'll be raving until I chafe my gooch
I already saw the chick I wanna dance with
And I've been aiming when to make my move
Just when I went to move on it
A man popped up but I ain't too bothered
Because I make legs spread like the Bubonic plague
Come on babe, I know you want it, ayy

[Pre-Hook: Professor Green]

[Hook: Whinnie Williams]

[Bridge: Professor Green]
No pics or I'm posing a threat
Look at my boat, it's a mess
Although right now I'm in the zone and I'm bless
You can bet by Tuesday, I'll be an emotional wreck
All alone in my room with the lights out
Watching a rom com and crying my eyes out
Wondering why I bother with you
I wanna quit, it's just I can't dance without you

[Hook: Whinnie Williams]

[Outro: Professor Green]
If I'm being honest, I can't dance at all, init
I've got two left feet
I can sing though, trust me
No autotune needed
You always have this special way
Of making life feel-
Alright, maybe not[Hook]
We don't have no time
(No time in these streets, everybody's hungry and trying to eat)
In the city of gold
(Everybody's out for their own, it's hot round here even when you're out in the cold)
Trying to get me some sunshine
(It's hard to find peace here, never can you be easy, always gotta beware)
And avoid the patrol, oh yeah
(But that's life in the inner city: up to no bother, trying not to get collared by the piggies)

[Verse 1]
I'm fed up, all I want is a little nice weather when I get up
A lot of people arrive zealous
But life here's less a dream, more a nightmare
Welcome to the city of gold, the city I roam
Home to the grittiest roads
It's hardly a party, getting our Ps on the same corner where woman sell Narni
I live amongst vermin, I'm stuck, but I couldn't give a fuck as long as I'm earning
Long been accustomed to the ways of the manor
The filth are an occupational hazard
Parked chilling in a car park, grinning, it's gone midnight and I'm half passed sinning
Got a dark heart wicked with my rasclart lyrics, I'm a bad boy you don't wanna start no shit with

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Time's precious and it moves fast in a city of bright lights and tight dresses
Medusas' that'll seduce ya if ya ain't ready
A city that makes few and breaks many
The city I'm in's less like the city of gold, more like the city of sin
Where everybody's in it to win, from villainous nippers to city slickers with sinister grins
Straight ain't religious, never been into hymns, and I pushed bars before I'd ever been in a gym
So for my freedom I keep hoping, cause I don't wanna walk through the doors these keys open
I don't know if you think it's nice or something?
But I can show you a different side to London
To think you came here for the treasures, but nobody ever came here for the weather

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Jack the Lad, I put the work in, for the wage of sin
Even if by some poor sod's loss, I care not, I will take the win
So many came so full of hope, only to be deflated
The roads we walk ain't paved in gold
Alone is how our day's spent
Don't think cause I'm polite I'm nice G
Or cause I'm well dressed I ain't grimy
I got food for them city heads, just another aggie youth that the city bred
The cloud I'm under thunder's loud, I ain't waiting for the day that the sun comes out
If you wonder what I'm under now? The same shit I was and will be 'till I'm underground

[Hook][Verse 1: Professor Green]
I don't mean to be ungrateful
And I could never tell you something if it ain't true
I'm stable and I find it's easier for me
Being single than it is being faithful
I guess I'm where I gotta be and I can't take you
And you deserve more so why would you make do?
I ain't no angel, and there ain't nothing you can say to me
To save us cause it ain't you
I hold onto everything we went to
I'll always remember what you meant to me
Now there's business I've got to attend to
Money for nothing and the drinks are free
Where I'm going, there's no place for
All the little things we kinda got a taste for
But you know, there's a lot I'm gonna miss
There ain't a page long enough for me to write a list

[Hook: Fink]
Is this as good as it gets?
Is this situation gonna turn into one of life's regrets?
Is this as good as it gets?
Is this situation gonna turn into one of life's regrets?
This is how it goes
Everything around me's so full of possibles
Close the door behind me, start thinking bout what's in front of me
Ooh

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I don't mean to be ungrateful
And I could never tell you something if it ain't true
I'm stable and I find it's easier for me
Being single than it is being faithful
I'm not alone cause I know you've got needs too
And from a distance it's nothing I'd concede to
I'd rather leave you than insult you with the lies
Cause I'm really not as sly as to deceive you
Time for us both is so precious
But selfish is never what I meant to be
A business where sin is relentless
And nobody sees nothing in the VIP
I don't know if it's a place I was meant for
Or if it's everything I always ever dreamt for
But I know there's a lot I'm gonna miss
There ain't a page long enough for me to write a list

[Hook: Fink]

[Outro: Professor Green]
Only time will tell if I'm doing the right thing
See, honesty's all about the timing
It's frightening but I'm tryna make it easier for you
By closing the door behind me[Verse 1: Professor Green]
No religion, all I follow is my feet no psalms
As far as holy water I would need a bath
Even breathing stressing he didn't even ask
So far passed stressed that I can't even see the 'r'?
His is as I am truly, high at times I'm ruly
My minds screwed, and my moods blew as a lazuli?
Add to that my heart isn't good I lie to these groupies
Like I like em I don't like em I just like to get the goodies
So disrespectful giving your chick a neck full, of salty water
She sorta looks like she bit on a pretzle
Skilled I'm passed that, I'm past them
Got that lemon pass that, then you lucky if you see it passed back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Streets]
Never trust a man with two phones
You couldn't throw Pro Green like you'd throw two stones
And Pro Green knows, I'm in the gap in this market
For the gafts and sharp wit, I laugh it off partly but
Have to start to think, no parteners in this
Just a part of the business, after the party is finished
We part with a wish, Danny Dyer eating Paella, in that dire dwelling
So badly wanted out, one more try on the selling
The 80's dream was the fate of our scheme
Me, Ted Mayhem and team, In sport we were taught to be sporting
But in law we were courting something
But don't rate me in the 80's we were naughty in the noughties
There's a parroty, now I see, that's between charity
I beat you at your peak, I'll beat you on the beak
Ask me anything, many men end here
Many never made lengths, I'll tell you when your spent

Now you care for me
You see it Mike, they think I speak as nice but I don't belive the hype
Now you care for me
Them man are idiots, there's no defeating us, soon they'll see that it's a *crying game*

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
I'm on jet fuel, them man are on fumes, dizzy
I guess them man are on shrooms
I'm as bad as an animal got loose
It's sticky in the manor?
Oh when your moving Mike, why you still moving why?
When they look at you like when you move
Don't matter what you do with the mic[Verse 1: Professor Green]
I want me a Vegas girl
I don't like the song but I'd love me a Vegas girl
How do I have the audacity to say this?
I'm a little bit of a sadist, girl
I say this, I say that
Whatever I say, I never take back
I've got no respect
Ask Dream Mclean and his enormous head
I ain't got the heart to care
Ask him how long he spends in the barbers' chair
I wouldn't wanna be your barber
Picture me on a sheep in a barber
I'm Green like a frog and I ribbet
No, I've not lost it, I'm just being silly
Really need an ump and I'm going on millie
I don't mean I'm going on Millie
How much longer could he go?
My mind can only be described as unhealthy
No, I wasn't made in Chelsea
I'm just living it up real tosh

[Hook: James Craise]
I wear them dead man's shoes
I wear them dead man's shoes
I wear them dead man's shoes
I wear them dead man's shoes

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I've had an idea, who knows how
We can raise the national IQ? I do
Take every member of every reality TV show
For a little trip on a ship and then sink the boat
Thank God Millie quit the show, I'm unbiased
It's simple, Millie would've been on the ship too
A prick to anybody and everybody
There ain't a woman alive that I wouldn't be a dick to
But you came into my life
And now everything's so sweet
I found my perfect match in a woman
Who gives more hugs than me, Millie
Me and my bird are barmy
Two peas in a pod, edamame
Couldn't care less what the whole world thinks of me
As long as the in-laws think I'm charming, darling

[Hook: James Craise]

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
In a couple of years, I'll be speaking posh
"He ain't hood anymore, he's a tot"
Picture hearing me speaking in a posh accent
Like "come hither now, clean my cock"?
"What did you say, young man?"
"Is this the way young people behave nowadays, young man?"
That was when she hit me with her walking stick and said
"That ought to teach you for talking shit"
I don't even know who she was, this is what the weed does
Millie, I'm gonna be with you forever
Only till the day that we divorce and I get taken to the cleaners
Probably for getting caught fondling the clean-er
It's never gonna happen!
She's 68!
She has had four children!
It would be like throwing a hotdog down a hallway!

[Hook: James Craise]

[Outro: Professor Green]
I wear them, I wear them
Them dead man's shoes, I wear them
I wear them, I wear them
Them dead man's shoes, I wear them
Dead man's shoes, I wear them
Dead man's shoes, I wear them
I wear them, I wear them
Them dead man's shoes, I wear them[Verse 1]
I don't know how long I can remain composed
All I did was say a flow, In life I always told
You should play your part, but I never said I'd take the role
Now every fucking thing I say's a quote
And they take shit out of context, I'd be lying if I said I was not vexed
Pick up a paper flick a page and see a picture of me on my latest conquest
Fuck it, it all helps
I'm not just gonna stand here making out it's all hell
And all's well and good if I put on a pair of rose tits
Yeah bare arms, just to show ink
Might show ink off, but I'm not showing off
I would be if I were to let you know what this costs
Lucky for you I'm more subtle than I am flashy though init man
Just know if you don't see it on the wrist it's in the bank
On a mission with a plan, life's a journey and I don't wanna end up in a jam
Where I end ups in the hands, of the Gods, when I'm gone, I'll be going with a bang
But for now I'm flying high and I ain't coming in to land
I'm up high and I like life up here, you're running behind
Somewhere in front of you is my rear

[Hook]
They wanna pick me up, yeah, they wanna hold me
Show me off and talk about me as if I'm their own
How long until they wanna let me go?
They play with me like I'm their doll

[Verse 2]
I'm in the mood, in a feud with myself
The chair's wobbling, and my neck is in the noose
See what I do, I don't ever get to choose
And today there's been a few too many interviews
I mean can I breathe? This new attitude
Is probably gonna leave a lot of people mad at me
It'll have to be, I'll be glad to see some anarchy
It wasn't the money that changed me it was the lack of sleep
To get to sleep I need more than a bag of weed
What happened last year? I can't even remember back a week
It just became a blur, don't believe everything you've heard
Although I heard Peter Burns just became a her
All these people sucking me and telling me that I'm the shit
Ain't any less annoying than those who told me that I should quit
Feel like saying fuck it on a whim, chucking it all in
I ain't some fucking puppet on a string

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I came into this polite, and well mannered
You know I've always believed that you should learn to tolerate things
Cause the world's full of them
I seem to have misplaced my patience
There's how many of you and there's only one of me
I can't keep everyone happy

[Hook x2][ Verse 1: Professor Green ]

It all started in hackney, where I was born and raised
I was bored and raised, hell before I caught the name
Pro, pro, professor green, here we go, go
But there was so much in-between
Life's lost, lost, as I was
Before I got, this name
I was on the block high off reeper
Started out sellin it
So was it I could get it out cheaper
Nah ye never thought that Id be a drug dealer
But now look what I've become
Shit swtitched quick
Another statistic
And ever since I've bin shift
To grow bin give
Been prepared to
Cause I ain't been anymore legit
Just more carefull
This rap shits therapy
It don't pay the bills, the rills, im still selling weed
Obstacles I've over come
Ive no doubt theres more to come
But theres got to be more to life im bored of being short and fun
One minuite your mashin, the next minuite your brasin
Sitting scratchin you head like how did this shit happen?
Thats the way of the roads
Which is why I want to switch up and get paper from flows
I know I had a deal I should of been an done it
But the beats went bust
Fuck it whats done is done
Its time to move on im moon strung
Doin all that I can do to see all those, That wanna hate proved wrong
They can't deny im sick with the flow
Sick wit it, went quick wit it
But just as sick when I give it them slow
Im quick quited, I've been ripping up shows
Then picking up pace, im top man there washed man im gone
And im still picking up pace got speed like I got man picking up base
Im billing, im chilling
Im billing, I hazed
Offended off north Easters im really not fazed
By the shit they speak about me
At least the speak about me
Can't see its cloudy
With all this weed I'm drowsy
High ain't from the bits and you see me round east
Round east parts it's hard
Shit goes wrong
Its easy to let go
Its hard just to hold on
Feel like I'm losing hold
And you don't wanna see me when I lose control

[ Hook: Lady Ny ][Verse 1]
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconios
I don't know what that is, but I know that it flows sick
Oh shit, there I go being a dick again
Look at me I can say the longest word in the dictiona
Ry ry ry...
I don't know much but I know the future's bright, the future's green
The future's me, the future's I
Maybe you'd understand me a little better if you were high
Too like my DJ I-I-I-IQ
Make no mistake, I'm just as high-igh-igh too
If you say the wrong thing about me
Your career is something that you can say goodbye, bye, bye to
How's your album doing? Mine flew
This time around I'm doing what I did on the last one times two
And some, damn son!
Have you seen the state of your eyeballs?

[Hook]
Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off
Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off
'Til we stop there will be no falling, no we're giving everything we've got
'Til the wheels fall off we'll be rolling, yeah we go anywhere we want

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
Meet at track meet, I eat tracks; that's me
Jack D, Hackney's in my blood, and weed
Accede to the throne, taxi and I'm home
Bad B, black sheep, bag of beans and an O
Yo, I'm getting high tonight
With women who make do; getting bi tonight
I like the life, I ain't into courting
I'm only into spooning if it leads to forking
I'm back buzzing, I'd shag Eva Mendes
Even if she was my damn cousin, please don't think I am bluffin'
Even though I'm swimming and women throw the pussy at me
I ain't tryna catch nothing
I ain't lightening up, I'm still as mean
Still as drunk, still as high, still as lean
Still as Green, stood still
On a pair of stilts in a distillery, sket
The last time I got head, it involved a guillotine

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I don't know what it is man, but
Something about this beat just kinda makes me feel invincible
Yeah, like I could do anything I wanted without any question
I might even cover my naked body in sticky tape and run through All Saints and come out doing my JLS impression
Don't piss me off, (don't piss me off)

[Hook][Intro: Orelsan & P.Green]
Professeur, c'est quoi la leçon pour aujourd'hui ?
Don't piss me off

[Couplet 1: Professor Green]
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
I don't know
What that is
But I just know it flows sick
Oh shit
There I go being a dick again
Look at me I can say the longest word in the dictiona-ry ry ry...
I don't know much but I know "The future's bright, the future's green"
The future's me
The future's I
Maybe you'd understand me a little better if you were high
Too like my DJ I-I-I-IQ
Make no mistake I'm just as high-igh-igh too
If you say the wrong thing about me

How's your album doing? Mine flew

[Refrain]
Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off (me cassez pas les *hum*)
Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off
'Til we stop there will be no falling, no we're giving everything we've got
Et on ira où on veut aller on arrêtera qu'à la fin des temps

[Couplet 2: Orelsan]
Y'a bientôt 2 heures j'aurais dû commencer ma journée
Si y'a des bonnes raisons d'sortir du lit j'les ait pas trouvé
Laissez-moi souffler
Ça va mal tourner
Missile groupé, bim-bim touché
Ouh, j'ai 40 paires pourtant j'suis mal à l'aise dans mes pompes
J'srais sûrement satisfait quand j'aurai fini par changer le monde
Quand on me demande pourquoi j'suis sombre j'réponds qu'l'avenir me fait peur
En gros j'me prépare pour le pire même si j'aspire au meilleur
Non, pas le temps d'être maniaque sur l'hygiène
Chez moi tu pourrais t'noyer dans les tas d'factures qui traînent
La semaine on taff dur la thune qu'on claque sur le week-end
Tout nous tape sur le système donc on tape sur le système
Oh, encore une soirée dans les bars-bars-bars
Où, j'étais censé m'arrêter de boire-oire-oire (ouh)
J'suis même pas vraiment motivé par la gloire
J'essaie juste de nourrir les gosses que j'finirai par avoir
Ou pas

[Refrain 2]
Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off (me cassez pas les *hum*)
Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off
'Til we stop there will be no falling, no we're giving everything we've got
'Til the wheels fall off we'll be rolling, yeah we go anywhere we want
Paroles rédigées et expliquées par la communauté RapGenius France[Intro]
So listen
Its only right, if get into some like, ill freestyling right now
So I'm going to play a joint, its a bit different though
I-I-I-'m not going to go with the usual, like "yeah yeah all of these beats"
I got this joint *SICK*, but I don't know about
I'm definitely feeling it right now, I want to see what you do over this
This is Semtex!!

Ok this is a little different

*SPIT, SPIT, SPIT*

[Verse 1]
Know who I be
And you ain't listening to homegrown
You're listening to potent weed
You know who I be - I'm Pro
Kick it sick even when I'm spitting like Mike Jones
Yo, the flows never brittle you can never break it
I spit the realest other rappers are the fakest
I make this up on the spot and keep on flowing
And no, I'm not going to stop, I'm going to keep on going
Talk my name and I'll slay you
Me and rap go together like Kate Moss and glass tables

[*GUN SHOT*]
[DJ Semtex: "Talk about Rhymefest"]

Talk about Rhymefest? That's kinda easy
For starters, he rhymes dead
On the mic, his rhymes are all dead
He looks like he's growing a fetus inside his forehead
I'm the sickest to prove that I'm the sickest at this
When he was born he split his mother in two
Cause his head was so big, the flow is so sick
Everybody knows Pro is no prick
And I ain't legit, and you rappers are all fags
I still got skunk right by my ball bags
Even though I'm on dial, that's a dangerous statement
Everybody understands and knows what I'm saying is real
I'm the realest one to spit this tight
Everybody knows I rip this tonight
They'll probably rip this and put this on internet websites
I'll wreck tight, everybody knows when I get mics
I don't stop you have to tell me to slow down

[DJ Semtex: "Talk about Mike Skinner and The Streets"]

Mark Skinner and The Streets, they're a dangerous influence
Drugs? Before them I wasn't into her
I'm blinded by life like Mike is
Before I drop three of them speckly white things
He makes my eyes look like ten pence pieces
When he gives me pills - I'm joking I shouldn't say this
You're all laughing and making it hard to spit, but drugs are hard to quit
Especially if you've been smoking since the age of 13
Everybody knows me from a yout, I burned weed
That's how I got the name
I'm in this game cause I can do it - it's easy
To me it's like fluid
Flowing through my veins that's how consistent it is
Everybody knows I rip when I spit
I'm the sickest shit
Yo, I'm not funny, I spit hot shit like my arse does after a curry
I'm the illest in here
Everybody knows I ain't no queer
But some people say I'm gay, some say I'm a racist
I say they should shut they mouth and not say shit
I just spray this, the illest with a flow
You don't know me, I'm still the illest that you know

[Radio DJ: Yo talk about the Jump Off How you won the battles consistently, 7 weeks, like 10 weeks, whatever it was]

[Radio DJ: Yo talk about the Jump Off How you won the battles consistently, 7 weeks, like 10 weeks, whatever it was]

Yo, I got the sickest of flows
Ain't nobody else ever won seven weeks in a row
Yo, you know that I'm nice, I won seven weeks in a row
I took the piss cause I did it twice
All these other MC's be rapping my name
I'm like "I ain't listening blud, their rapping is lame"
They ain't nothing to me, ain't nothing to P
I'm like relaxed, at home and puffing the trees
Believe I won, I was laughing
Kicking back in the bohemian sun
What I paid to go to-
Oh wait, I mean I didn't pay to go there
I got paid to go there
Its like no fair, I'm killing it
Everyone knows-[Intro: Dream Mclean]
What it do
What it do, easy

[Verse 1: Dream Mclean]
I'll make you do what it do, make you do what I do
Bad news cause I do it all, and if I do it
Then I'm doing a few, I'm doing you, true
Then you should be doing you too, just do you and be cool
Just be cool, you'll be cool, baby, I knew you'd be cool
You are too beautiful to be suing people
And I'm pretty sure you asked me to let you pull on that zoot
Then put something in your drink, and then throw you in the pool
Twenty skinny white women in the pool with you too
Looking like noodles in soup, oh what a beautiful view
Coming down, come around, do the hula and hoop
And hope you're gone before it's gone too, toodle-oo

[Hook: Dream Mclean]
You say you want it all now
Tell me, what would you do for this?
You think I'm going all out
To tell you the truth, I'm just
Doing what I do, doing what I do
Doing what I do in here
Doing what I do, doing what I do
Doing what I do in here

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
Oi Dream, I was in the pool canoodling too
If I'm a noodle, well, then you're a fucking poodle
Business as usual until the day that it's toodle-doo
Until that day, all I'm ever gonna be's brutal
I ain't a wasteman but me, I'm out getting wasted
My palette ain't selective, anything you've got, I'll take it
My love ain't in the money, waste it quicker than I make it
6am looking vacant as I wonder around naked
Feeling kinda saucy now that I've been on the condiments
Dick in my hand, holding my rod while I'm fishing for compliments
I'm on a mix of cocaine, marijuana and ketamine
In a strip club trying not to slip up and lose my wedding ring

[Hook: Dream Mclean]

[Verse 3: CAS]
You know what I do, cocaine, ket and the dizzle too
Model chick, 22, 23 on her shoes
She brought a friend, I brought a friend, hit them with some two on two
Friend's clocking, bang her too, brain too, that'll do
I do what I gotta do, then I tell them on their bike
On my bike, R6, one wheel, out of sight
Her figure's slight, hair's right, might let her stay the night
After hoovering that white, most of them become my type
Pushing keys sorta like when you type, all these niggas talking trap
But we know they talking tripe, I've been on it all my life
On my life, coke resi on my knife
Now I'm getting big racks, like the one that's on my wife

[Hook: Dream Mclean][Intro: Rizzle Kicks]
WOO!
Yeh RK, RK, What?
We're the believers, do you believe us?
I can find my place in my dreams
Said I can find my place in my dreams

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Stay with my gristle spit, spittle
Swivelling' with the Rizzle Kicks
Never Fizzle we'll not spit gibberish
Riddle me this, uh forget about it
Hit ‘em with just a touch of
Love, A little bit a monsoon
Competition is simply drizzlin', whistlin'
Dicks missed me, with that you will get missed away
Don't you know that' I set my diary...
Earthquakes, tremors, T-vo, when I
Step in the venue, what's next on the menu?
Is intellect process, then tell, Intel, internet
Cream of the crop, Lean when I bop, like a feind
Seize them like Caesar
Mausoleum, when I skene
Super' superb, supreme, Magnetic from Queens
Athletics the words in the verse are mean
U-K, Rizzle Kicks, skip with the team
Pharoahe Monche see the place in my dreams

[Verse 2: Hines]
Say, I'm just a dreamer; with the trumpets dealer
Proper budget feature, but the thunder stealer
Couple drunken tweets, it's here to bust ya speakers
Chillin' with the Kicks, like a pair of comfy sneakers
So put your Zs up this is bigger
Than the cupboard of a comfort eater,
So hush your beats bruv, Leavin' Believers believing
Will end up in an office with my Uncle Peter
Come and see us ramp the beat up
Yeah we'll make their month like Augustus Caesar
Gunna, touch Selena off of Justin Bieber
Just to leave her crying like an onion peeler
He was such a diva; well I’m a quantum leaper
Running my lane like one hundred metres
I'm a scruffy teacher with a drunk demeanour
No sleep till bright and I’m a slumber seeker!

[Hook:]
I can find my place in my dreams
Said I can find my place in my dreams

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
Erm, relax
Man it's pro, ha, I man this flow
Tracks about as simple as san dingo
Mingling in an indigo hat, or riddlin' with a dick bigger than Mandingo
Let's have a party, pass me the wine
Pass me your watch while we're passing the time
Ram last me with a Bacardi and lime
Dropping E’s in the punch to bring the party to life
Bad of me I know, but it will come back to me
Should a sat at home with a brew and a bag of weed
If you weren't imaginary, it would've been a tragedy
Who invited pat and turn my Nan into an anony
It's the shit I see when I sleep, bro
Which is why I spend most of my time sleeping
Me, I don't spit, I just talk in my sleep
God forbid anybody wake me when I’m dreaming

[Verse 4: Ed Sheeran]
My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold bro
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
So if we're keeping dreams to day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I’m sweating on the stage
With the sold out tours
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are guys that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just a way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow cause

[Hook]
I don't care what you choose as fact
I'm gonna take myself to the moon and back
In my dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)

[Hook 2]
Straight up me to the sand, I'm a spaceman
Yeah, with a suit to match
In my dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams

[Verse 5: Metropolis (Foreign Beggars)]
Yo, who's side parting rules in two thousand and now?
Still swinging on these fools
Never out for the count, wowing the crowd
Rizzle Kicks shouting me out
Thought I wasn't built for this, you can't be doubting me now
We were all team dreamers but only some relate
To Displaying traits that i'll equate to
Freak genius, Crowd in the palm of my hand
Like three creases, boss in the mic
You’re not even team leaders

[Verse 6: Orifice Vulgatron (Foreign Beggars)]
Yeah, I’m reaching out from the pinnacle
With a subversive use of crude syllables, I ain't stewed with the use of new palpable
Rap homocides, my hand writes to kill' em all
My vision taught the life line of a vicious brawl
And spring forth you'll laugh like a digger's fool
My lyrics calling out to the dreamers
Pick yourself up, spread love, time we cleaned up

[Verse 7: Chali 2na]
Chali 2na, Rizzle Kicks
Aha-ha-ha
Yeah, we do playing
I'm through playing
Cruise laying cushions cash like new crayons
We move women, I'm try'na improve payment
Kill the crowd then bring them back like it's a group séance
Grace the stage where taste for rage
When my pen touch the page, I complete the phase of MC
And in circus I’m try’na remain relevant
Pulling in this herd, one of the main elephants
Travel the world for irrelevant girls
My life is a rebel just like a javelin twirls
Used to get nervous, don't think just like the frivolous whirls
Not even a care in the world, it's my dreams
Misha touch the rim and reach the nitro rilby
We be the best kept secret like some micro film
At night go see them, or chances might go slim
Better be there when the lights go dim
Because I’m living my dream

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2][Intro]

Yogi man
I'm sick of this shit bruv
Swear down
Just as things start looking up
It all goes to shit again
Story of my fucking life!

[Verse 1]

I don't wanna live my life this way..
No!
Picture me behind a desk
Picture that a nine to five I ain't into that
I'm into rap
And I don't see me getting an office job with these tat's
So what choice do I have man?
Do I sign on or do I bag grams?
Long signing for dole
I wanna get signed for my flow
And my rhymes
I'm a pro and I'm nice I know
If I grind then I'll blow
So why am I wasting time on the roads
Now Mike's interested
I should probably give it a rest before I get arrested
But then I got arrested, whoops

[Hook: Lee Bailey]

Why don't I learn from my mistakes?
Why oh why oh why..
All I want's to change my ways
Why oh why oh why Do I always end up back here
Stuck on the wrong side of town
With my head spinning, I keep on falling down

[Background Hook: Professor Green]
Never been arrested for so much as an eighth of weed and I get arrested for kidnap, blackmail, false imprisonment and possession with intent to supply. Typical of my fuckin' luck really innit, just as I'm about to sign a deal with Mike I might be doing a fucking bird

[Verse 2]

I don't wanna sell weed no more
Hated the cycle but I kept peddling
Nan just found food under my bed again
I'm a let down again
And she's screaming "get this shit out of my house" again
There's no curving the truth
The bags too big to be for personal use
There's no excuses
She knows what the truth is
I do flip Keys of green to get me a few quid
She's looking at me so disappointed
All I can say is I won't do it again
But she knows I will..

[Hook: Lee Bailey]

Why don't I learn from my mistakes?
Why oh why oh why..
All I want's to change my ways
Why oh why oh why Do I always end up back here
Stuck on the wrong side of town
With my head spinning, I keep on falling down

[Background Hook: Professor Green]
Never learn man.. There's no plan B for me, I ain't got shit to fall back on! I left school in year 8 I don't have an education, selling weed and writing lyrics is all I know

[Verse 3]

I got arrested and raided
Then I got signed
And I bust case
So now everything's fine
But now everything's not
Not only did I get dropped
The whole label did
And I wasted my advance so I ain't got shit
I'm stuck at warners and them pricks won't push my album
But it's cool
As soon as I'm free I'm gonna do it without them
Eight months later I'm still stuck in my deal
In debt with my lawyer time to get back on this ferris wheel
I'm stuck on this carousel
When will this ever end?
This is hell for me I'm back at the beginning again
Somebody please get me off this circus ride
The horse that I'm riding is hurting my thighs erm..

[Hook: Lee Bailey]

Why don't I learn from my mistakes?
Why oh why oh why..
All I want's to change my ways
Why oh why oh why Do I always end up back here
Stuck on the wrong side of town
With my head spinning, I keep on falling down

[Background Hook: Professor Green]
And before some funny guy tries to make a joke about me riding a horse, it is a metaphor! What I mean is I am sick of hustling, I am sick of the grind, I am sick of things going to shit, Just when things are looking up! I don't know if this shit is ever gonna work for me. I swear down blud I am so fed up Yogi, I cannot be dealing with it anymore
