[Intro: 2Pac]
I ain't got no motherfucking friends
What y'all niggas talking about?
Hell yeah I'ma do this motherfucking track
And they know exactly who they talking about

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Cause uh, niggas talk plenty shit, so many tricks
I fucked your bitch cause I'm true to this, witness the hit
You talk bad about a nigga when I got blasted
Hope you made a little money while the funk lasted
Heard they call you Big Poppa nigga, how you figure?
Cause to me you'll always be a phoney fat nigga
I can't be copied even wearing Versace, nigga you run or ruck
Scared as fuck, if the guns would bust, now niggas talk
I got a list of player haters and fakes
You bitch niggas getting blown away
You cross-eyed Down syndrome crack baby
So you and Puffy are tough? Now that's crazy
I got your ass in my sight, niggas dying tonight
We screaming, "West Side for life"
And I can't wait to see you niggas in traffic cause we gonna get 'em up
When you see me, you better bust cause I'm a hit 'em up

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga we hit 'em up

[Napolean]
It's hard to explain, this wasn't my thang when I was younger
Before my shit, I swear to God, I'll make you stick just to make a come up
Niggas run up cause more murder for the money
Got caught up tryna make a harder record, should have been on checked
Cause I bet you and it's for life
You'll never gonna see a nigga like me wanting a battle up on T.V
I'd rather release some of these
And put a slug to you buster ass niggas that continue to squeeze
I got some niggas back in Jersey that would rather be jacking cars
And robbing bitch niggas like y'all for emergency
Let's take it back to the West Side
Them niggas sure gonna be riders and plus we Thug Life niggas, so call us multiply
Finger on the trigger, bitches stand and rise
But we don't trust 'em and they might be the first that we gonna bust up
Just label me a Bad Boy Killer
You Mobb Deep bitches gonna feel us when we turn into killers
Hit 'em up

[E.D.I Amin]
Now this is me, BBK all day, ain’t no blunt, ain’t no creeping
Strictly Bad Boy killing, shoot that ass like a squealer
Now let this motherfucking top down, I'm fitting to drop rounds
Letting these sounds, pop and then I'm hot bound
Seeing them shatter, shooting my shit to work a lease go
What's up to the riders in L.A, don't preach on up to the East O
Shooting that so, C-Lo, circle, that shit don't hurt you
___________ made to turn you purple
Wanna take a plane, but we enemies to the game
Well get that ass tamed, simple and plain, y'all know the name
Drama, riders, through the whole night
Niggas get taught, then we bobbin' through, they hits slow
No need for running cause we don't give a fuck
Beside the funky man, we got to hit they ass on up

[Hussein Fatal]
Get out the way, yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got shot
And I'm a true eagle storming, nigga don't need your fat ass in California
I catch you on any East Coast corner and you's a goner
Puffy weaker than fucking block, I'm running through nigga
And I'm smoking Junior M.A.F.I.A in front of you nigga
With the ready power, tucking my gats under my Eddie Bauer
You clothes petty sour, I push packages every hour
My sons past when slapping nickels on glass forties
So hand me cash, you made on that F without your ass shorty
I got a team of simple boutable souls
With my ears like Yoda quick as a cobra and never sober


[Khadafi]
I'm on a 12 O' Clock cruise to Brooklyn and I'm looking
For the thirl in your barrel ready to get his life tooken
So where your killers at you fake trick
E.D.I. will leave your coward ass stripped and a full clip in your stomach
You been all year nigga running
Popping every coward and every nigga behind you
I made it about impossible
For you niggas to escape another 'mergency visit to the hospital
I can't wait meet up with all you bitches in the streets
So I can leave all you cowards leaking in your fucking seats
When we hit 'em up

[Storm]
If you a big bad mothafucker come step to this
I got points in the clip and ???? for the click
Who wanna test this to the 1 2 3 bound to get they ass put under
Cause the Storm is bringing nothing but thunder
Who's the bomb nigga quick to feel that ichy finger
Situation of my nine who's the bigger trigger

Verse 1:
[Napolean]
Well since a young age
I'll been thugged out to the fullest
Niggas strap now
You don't want me dead
Gimme that, I'll bet I'll pull it
Cause since a young age
I been starvin'
Niggas say hungry
Fucked around with the lonely
You couldn't fuck around with the phony
In this life I lead
Nigga hustle
At a crack speed and I dig greed
Fuck makin' friends respectfully
I will cry for you at your murder scene
This Napolean
But he got quick, don't strike first, it's on again
In the shoe son
Mo' stash son
At least pretend he born away
This Outlawz, thug don't see
Fuck around you when I see
Your family, all the century
Matter of fact bitch only mention me
I'm comatosed
I'm stretched out on the Westcoast till the fullest
At a overdose of bullets
And tell your bitch ass, shall pull it
You shouldn't fuck around
With the wrong Niggas
At the wrong time
At the wrong place
You shouldn't fuck with some Outlawz
Bad Boy killers
Puffy and Ma$e

Verse 2:
[Kastro]
I'm a soldier
Sober
Even when I'm over
Smoked out, drunk and plus fuckin' on the sofa
In the Ghetto
You jellow, heart full of yellow
You thugged out, all bugged out
And can't settle
Word up
That's worth to me and all I love
My dick's stuck in the dirt
Fuckin' the world and can't bust
Back to the lab
Back to the bed
Born oven
You's a fag
Movin' fast
Happy ass, gone lucky
Picture this
A Nigga get blissed to remeniss
Fuck a ho
Fuck her slow
Put a strong in a stramp
It's me
Drunk as can be, on a humble
I shit piss and piss shit
Fuck till my dick crumble
My life, full of the worst
To imagine
Me in struggle like a magnet
Outlaw ill savage
My time
Step on the grind, wouldn't mind
My life full of late nights
My time won't provide

Chorus: x2
[Bad Azz]
This life of mine
Were only time on my side till I die
Gettin' high
Waste of time
Livin' blind by the light
Gettin' by
The best way I can in these times
And it hurts to know my life ain't really mine

Verse 3:
[E.D.I]
Now the custom my kind are
They label me a product
Well Am I supposed to let 'em ride up
End on drippin' blood
Like survive and I would
It's the wild, wild Westside
Best to recollect
Collect your toys
Try not to get too high
Off the live here
Cause the crime seen to be you
Pride to the fight
You was yappin'
Now you see through
I fillst the evil
As soon as I enter the section
But I'm a renegade
Made of the days I remember
Ment to only live my life strife free
But Niggas like me
Want mo' hood
So we kick in the do'
Screamin' Outlawz
We outsmart hoes
With Bad Azz fo' sho
Get yours
Get the fuck off
And flow

Verse 4:
[Young Noble]
Yo
I'm hardly livin'
A Nigga dishin' that I should be in
Stuck in a hole
The world put me in
Shiverin'
They sayin' thugs ain't citizens
In the civilized world among us
So world of hunger
If they could
They take the world from us
And who I mean by they, teachers
Who don't believe in his students
Preachers who take the money
And turns folks us to use 'em
Crooked cops who blast Niggas
For thinkin' guns from ruthless
Politicians and bad lords
Knowin' their motherfucking choosers
Who the fuck they done to roof us
They made a Nigga snap
With bigger gaps and quicker raps
A Nigga nasty perhaps
Brief pass me the strap
Either the Glock or one of the Gauges
Tryin' to stab me or not
On a plot or rockin' stages
Pac raised us
Soldier never let these fuckin' cops cage us
Sayin' we all lost souls
And they can't save us
Son is outrages
A faded ass like me
Sayin' Outlawz is no more
Thinkin' we all got killed
But we been on the day
Motherfucker thought you was on to me
Fuck you
Air police, I'm warrent free

Verse 5:
[Bad Azz]
Occupation sayin' Occupie
Rockin' high rhymes while you jockin' mine
Cockin' nine up in these times
Ain't no stoppin' mine
Keep in mind
Seek and find the streets' greedy thugs
Heat takes souls away
It's no love
Drugs help me cope with no hope
It's like stressin'
Smoke a sassin
Can't find no bomb dope
Continue to pear
For steppin' with conceal weapons
Catchin' cases is in
In off the cell that you sleapped in
Lowlifes and big bold letters
Blocked up
A half a key rocked up
I had your ass shot up
I keep dust kicked up
And that's another how you fuck wheels
Born to cause luck
These Outlawz they too much
Rust to the front
And get touched
And it was sluts who hit ya
Go tell 'em
Suck dick and tap
It's the only thing we sell 'em
Catch bullets as they hell 'em
And guess what
Nigga I stay bailin', yellin'
Rider die
Get richer stay high
In this life of mine
Gone were I don't care, I don't care

[Prince Ital Joe]
Gunshots
They tell 'em you go ruff
Gangsta
Buck, buck
Yeah Bad Azz
I'm gonna take sence
Cause it's like respect it
Respect in every aspect
That gone to be a suspect
Fuck, fuck
Gunshots

[Outlawz]
Outlawz
What you think about ridin'
You see
Here
We over here
Thug Pound rock
Fo sho
They never quit
Bad AzzPrince Ital Joe (Daz):
Yeah, Death Row (give it up, one time)
Yes, to the man sing
Them all beats they're crucial (give it up)
Dogg Pound (???)
Nobody moves, freeze!, nobody gets hurt
Shoot first and ask questions later
The motto, lyrically, artically, rip it...

Daz:
Stop and listen, catch a grip and realize, with your two eyes
The price, nigga, is keep striving for more
I broke laws, defined many, show skills of a rider when few was thick
Revolved around forty-four niggas for the rep
Sweat the whole block with the Mack-90, automatic semi-tech
Now the whole shit is respected
Slowly but surely homies catching death wishes, and laugh
You're trying to catch a check you can't cash
I do, for the rapper the name and for the hood that I claim
After the kill, it's remains the same
The composure, gangstering, it's got me, still down to bang
Who can get close to the most notorious gang of 'em all
Dogg Pound, amazing Rage, rough and raw (DPG)
The conversation ain't much, now what up?
You're gapping and you're scrapping and you got a gap from the gat

Kurupt:
I found a (what?), more, I see the homies free
I bound to make more money than I ever dreamed
It's the DPG, the gangsters on the TV
Completely, you can't defeat, delete species
That fool over there is out of his nest
He's off the hood with techs and vests
Dumping on different sets (who's that man?)
D-A-Z's my nigga
If he ever was to get any bigger and lose his figures he's my nigga
The more I think about life and the world that surrounds us
Being from Tha Pound, instantly penitentiary bound (so what's up?)
I'm all about dropping bombs
And possessing the deadliest rhymes the mind can't design
So let's let bygones be bygones, aim to shoot
And mash with your boys if you're down for making loot
Cause if not, when the heat gets hot you get scorched
You're caught up like being in court, fighting divorce
Now I pause to take a sneak peek through The Source (Magazine)
Of course it's not revealing (what?), we sold two million (damn!)
Willingly we survived, willingly we strived
We all multiply, Dogg Pound 'till we die
I thought you knew about, the two about to run through about half your
Organization
Sacred assassinations, fool, here's what you're facing
The diverse, you're in a worse situation, like that...

Prince Ital Joe:
Yeah, Tell Babylon that we'll never give up hope in the ghetto
Cause everyday when we wake up we see the sun rise up in the sky
We won't ever, never give up the fight, see
We, down in the ghetto, will always put up the struggle
The struggle to survive, and to live good
To bring food on the table for our families, see
Tell Babylon that we have hope
Like our brothers Martin Luther King and Marcus Garvey
We believe that we are true Africans
And we handle (???) in this life
We won't kill our brothers no more
Stab them with a knife, or shoot them with a gun
Cause when we do we see their blood run
And it's not a pretty sight
So we don't love the parasites of this world
Sucking the blood of the sufferers
Yeah![Intro: 2Pac]
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
Now what's next

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Caught up in the middle
My life's a riddle
Don't let it get you
I wanna live legal, but it's this hustling that get me richer
Picture one love to my peoples makin' money
I could see your brother avoid all trouble, beware of devils
Continue strugglin' cause nothings impossible
If there's a will there's a way
To get your mind on official business you could get paid
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave to get paid
My niggas do this every fuckin' day we parlay
Through politics and conversations
It's information to my thug niggas in the congregation
Watch and bear witness To the pleasures of participation
Separation is self-destruction what's needed is unification
Cause the world is hardly fair
If not prepared we sure to be buried and be no longer there
Because of me it will evaporate say your prayers
And what's next

[Chorus: 2Pac & Prince Ital Joe]
(The struggles continue, I'm strivin' with my crew )
Tell me what the fuck am I suppossed to do
What's next

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
I plant one on his block chicken after chicken
There was a time that if you slip you caught a stitchin'
And the main position saddition and ghetto politician
My competition's nail 'em all top of the hill
My niggas kill for a thrill
But my soul brings the real I'm all balled out
Tryin' to sell the devil a deal
I'm facin' forty case 'bout to spin a grip
And all my fuckin' homies for me for the same shit
The world is a snake pit your homies turn counterfeit
How much worser can it get I wish I could be legit
And turn this whole thing around
But there's no turnin' back
I'm standing sittin' down which way do I go

[Chorus: Mopreme & Prince Ital Joe]
(The struggles continue, I'm strivin' with my crew )
Tell me what the fuck am I suppossed to do
What's next

[Verse 3: Big Syke]
I often wonder will the ways of today ever change
Now it's like the summer days in the rain we gain
So much it held on through stormy weather
Just your touch and understandin' kept my shit together
No need to swear to stay down
At any costs gave me hugs and pounds
When I took that loss you the boss
Is what you told me and you didn't lie
Promise to never part until we die
Don't cry , baby girl, I know the world is crashin' on us
Plus the thought our relationship was built on trust
Don't fuss I made mistakes you made mistakes too
What can we do but just think this through
Stay true with me don't mess with my enemies
Breakin' up is drivin' me crazy
So I'm highly occupied with women and my homies
To keep me from bein' lonely, so what's next

[Chorus: Big Syke & Prince Ital Joe]
(The struggles continue, I'm strivin' with my crew )
Tell me what the fuck am I suppossed to do
What's next

[Outro: Prince Ital Joe]
What's next
Some of them livin' in a booty complex
Tryin' to make the Thug Life crew vex
Some hate God and some worship checks
So tell me what the fuck's comin' in
If you spit in the sky it gonna drop in your fuckin' eye
You'll never miss the water 'till the well runs dry
Real deep punkster then love a lot
When I clock me Glock some heads gonna fly
Yeah, in case you never know my name is Prince Idol Joe
Kickin' it with the Outlaw Immortal
Them you there is no true
Sing, remember
If you spit in the sky it gonna drop in your fuckin' eye
So don't disrespect at any aspect
Cause you gonna be a fuckin' suspect
Ribits, Yes need some chill
Know what I mean love the youth and then them relove
Catch this[Gonzoe] (talkin)
Hit em! hahahahaha (smoke being blown)
Ughhh! Razing sick Ughhh! Bitch!
Hit em, we're watching you (hit em), hit em

And make em listen (ahh)
Full blown warfare headin' in your direction
All that was not to do was taught by you (ugh)
So I just threw my crew, ya brand new (ugh)
Hit em where it hurts and bump em with their crew
Every game got rules
Expect em, choose
My next move
Stand strong, get leverage, and press them fools
And that's that (what)
Pick it up put it down
Never look back
My insides comin out because of this rap (my name...)

[Chorus - Prince Ital Joe]
Some of them are busta
Some of them are fraud
That's why I'mma hit em hard
Enough of them are busta
Some of them are fraud
Might as well hit em hard (hit em)
Hit em hard, hit em hard cause the plot, hit em hard
Them are fraud, hit em hard (hit em)
Hit em hard cause the plot, hit em hard (hit em) good lord (hit em)

[Verse 2 - Gonzoe]
Everything slow-motion but it's moving so fast
Right here by the ocean and the palm trees
These L.A. streets, concrete philosophy (what)
Raised me and rottened me
For every tear and broken bone I suffer
Bro's another road for me to walk on, it made me tougher
Now I keep breathing, holdin' guns for years nigga, till we even
Plus, I shoot up the cop car (ugh) before ya hit the precinct (ugh)
Razing; bow down, kiss my ring
Blazing; because real niggas do real things
And live dangerous, bang them bricks, keep secrets
If they crop and question us, who the thief is
I'll find you and put the rumor where ya teeth is (don't ask don't know)
Bust yo brain so I can see what ya thinkin'
Nigga, it's young ritz-ell
And I could distinguish the bomb from the fake by the smell

Chorus

[Milford McDonald]
When we be buckin'
Hittin niggas up when we comin
No lovin, got y'all duckin and we ain't said nothin
Fuck y'all niggas who be always feelin' our songs
Nigga, get your thug on

[Verse 3 - Gonzoe]
Who broke, now you're bullshit
I make hits, and sail the blue seas with yacht full of rits
And if there was a fifth nigga, we'd all be drunk
Peacin' up on a bunk when one Glock to get it clunk
For the nigga that act obsessed
And a scream with pash
So fuck clad, bettin on the six sec
Ready to mash
Down hold a nine
I'm still in here tryin not to get caught
Flippin' every narcotic that I'm on
And P, all ya soldiers on your feet
On the brink with these crazy thugs we're not think
Well fuck that, instincts survive
Six seven, sixteen lives
Bitch shut up and drive
This is...

Chorus

[Verse 4 - Prince Ital Joe]
Little ax court
Big tree (uh-huh)
If you don't believe me just come and see (uh-huh)
Little Gonzoe D O double G (yes)
He might have donned the top celebrity (we hit em)
We bite em off, invade ya privacy
Run the country and roll the territory
Lose your girlfriend Gonzoe, I'll see
In out the hotel she's coming like L
Your heart is broken you lose great shell
Ding dong, no more wedding bell

Chorus

Cause when we do we see their blood run
And it's not a pretty sight
So we don't love the parasites of this world
Sucking the blood of the sufferers
Yeah![Gonzoe] (talkin)
Hit em! hahahahaha (smoke being blown)
Ughhh! Razing sick Ughhh! Bitch!
Hit em, we're watching you (hit em), hit em
(we're watching you nigga) hit em, hit em
Savage, aaahhhhh!

[Verse 1 - Gonzoe]
Mass control, I pass your soul
We all worth some doe
Sippin' on gold
Spend a little get more (ahh)
Forever happy, what have we
Maxed with cavy
Risky Ritzy forever she burns
House keys care-free (ahh)
Nobody scares me
Where the players be?
Gettin money like me rarely
I did it cause you dared me
Now speak on it (what?)
You ain't no match for me nigga, so teach on it
And make em listen (ahh)
Full blown warfare headin' in your direction
All that was not to do was taught by you (ugh)
So I just threw my crew, ya brand new (ugh)
Hit em where it hurts and bump em with their crew
Every game got rules
Expect em, choose
My next move
Stand strong, get leverage, and press them fools
And that's that (what)
Pick it up put it down
Never look back
My insides comin out because of this rap (my name...)

[Chorus - Prince Ital Joe]
Some of them are busta
Some of them are fraud
That's why I'mma hit em hard
Enough of them are busta
Some of them are fraud
Might as well hit em hard (hit em)
Hit em hard, hit em hard cause the plot, hit em hard
Them are fraud, hit em hard (hit em)
Hit em hard cause the plot, hit em hard (hit em) good lord (hit em)

[Verse 2 - Gonzoe]
Everything slow-motion but it's moving so fast
Right here by the ocean and the palm trees
These L.A. streets, concrete philosophy (what)
Raised me and rottened me
For every tear and broken bone I suffer
Bro's another road for me to walk on, it made me tougher
Now I keep breathing, holdin' guns for years nigga, till we even
Plus, I shoot up the cop car (ugh) before ya hit the precinct (ugh)
Razing; bow down, kiss my ring
Blazing; because real niggas do real things
And live dangerous, bang them bricks, keep secrets
If they crop and question us, who the thief is
I'll find you and put the rumor where ya teeth is (don't ask don't know)
Bust yo brain so I can see what ya thinkin'
Nigga, it's young ritz-ell
And I could distinguish the bomb from the fake by the smell

Chorus

[Milford McDonald]
When we be buckin'
Hittin niggas up when we comin
No lovin, got y'all duckin and we ain't said nothin
Fuck y'all niggas who be always feelin' our songs
Nigga, get your thug on

[Verse 3 - Gonzoe]
Who broke, now you're bullshit
I make hits, and sail the blue seas with yacht full of rits
And if there was a fifth nigga, we'd all be drunk
Peacin' up on a bunk when one Glock to get it clunk
For the nigga that act obsessed
And a scream with pash
So fuck clad, bettin on the six sec
Ready to mash
Down hold a nine
I'm still in here tryin not to get caught
Flippin' every narcotic that I'm on
And P, all ya soldiers on your feet
On the brink with these crazy thugs we're not think
Well fuck that, instincts survive
Six seven, sixteen lives
Bitch shut up and drive
This is...

Chorus

[Verse 4 - Prince Ital Joe]
Little ax court
Big tree (uh-huh)
If you don't believe me just come and see (uh-huh)
Little Gonzoe D O double G (yes)
He might have donned the top celebrity (we hit em)
We bite em off, invade ya privacy
Run the country and roll the territory
Lose your girlfriend Gonzoe, I'll see
In out the hotel she's coming like L
Your heart is broken you lose great shell
Ding dong, no more wedding bell

Chorus

Verse 1:
[Napolean]
Well since a young age
I'll been thugged out to the fullest
Niggas strap now
You don't want me dead
Gimme that, I'll bet I'll pull it
Cause since a young age
I been starvin'
Niggas say hungry
Fucked around with the lonely
You couldn't fuck around with the phony
In this life I lead
Nigga hustle
At a crack speed and I dig greed
Fuck makin' friends respectfully
I will cry for you at your murder scene
This Napolean
But he got quick, don't strike first, it's on again
In the shoe son
Mo' stash son
At least pretend he born away
This Outlawz, thug don't see
Fuck around you when I see
Your family, all the century
Matter of fact bitch only mention me
I'm comatosed
I'm stretched out on the Westcoast till the fullest
At a overdose of bullets
And tell your bitch ass, shall pull it
You shouldn't fuck around
With the wrong Niggas
At the wrong time
At the wrong place
You shouldn't fuck with some Outlawz
Bad Boy killers
Puffy and Ma$e

Verse 2:
[Kastro]
I'm a soldier
Sober
Even when I'm over
Smoked out, drunk and plus fuckin' on the sofa
In the Ghetto
You jellow, heart full of yellow
You thugged out, all bugged out
And can't settle
Word up
That's worth to me and all I love
My dick's stuck in the dirt
Fuckin' the world and can't bust
Back to the lab
Back to the bed
Born oven
You's a fag
Movin' fast
Happy ass, gone lucky
Picture this
A Nigga get blissed to remeniss
Fuck a ho
Fuck her slow
Put a strong in a stramp

Fuck till my dick crumble

Step on the grind, wouldn't mind
My life full of late nights
My time won't provide

Chorus: x2
[Bad Azz]
This life of mine
Were only time on my side till I die
Gettin' high
Waste of time
Livin' blind by the light
Gettin' by
The best way I can in these times
And it hurts to know my life ain't really mine

Verse 3:
[E.D.I]
Now the custom my kind are
They label me a product
Well Am I supposed to let 'em ride up
End on drippin' blood
Like survive and I would
It's the wild, wild Westside
Best to recollect
Collect your toys
Try not to get too high
Off the live here
Cause the crime seen to be you
Pride to the fight
You was yappin'
Now you see through
I fillst the evil
As soon as I enter the section
But I'm a renegade
Made of the days I remember
Ment to only live my life strife free
But Niggas like me
Want mo' hood
So we kick in the do'
Screamin' Outlawz
We outsmart hoes
With Bad Azz fo' sho
Get yours
Get the fuck off
And flow

Verse 4:
[Young Noble]
Yo
I'm hardly livin'
A Nigga dishin' that I should be in
Stuck in a hole
The world put me in
Shiverin'
They sayin' thugs ain't citizens
In the civilized world among us
So world of hunger
If they could
They take the world from us
And who I mean by they, teachers
Who don't believe in his students
Preachers who take the money
And turns folks us to use 'em
Crooked cops who blast Niggas
For thinkin' guns from ruthless
Politicians and bad lords
Knowin' their motherfucking choosers
Who the fuck they done to roof us
They made a Nigga snap
With bigger gaps and quicker raps
A Nigga nasty perhaps
Brief pass me the strap
Either the Glock or one of the Gauges
Tryin' to stab me or not
On a plot or rockin' stages
Pac raised us
Soldier never let these fuckin' cops cage us
Sayin' we all lost souls
And they can't save us
Son is outrages
A faded ass like me
Sayin' Outlawz is no more
Thinkin' we all got killed
But we been on the day
Motherfucker thought you was on to me
Fuck you
Air police, I'm warrent free

Verse 5:
[Bad Azz]
Occupation sayin' Occupie
Rockin' high rhymes while you jockin' mine
Cockin' nine up in these times
Ain't no stoppin' mine
Keep in mind
Seek and find the streets' greedy thugs
Heat takes souls away
It's no love
Drugs help me cope with no hope
It's like stressin'
Smoke a sassin
Can't find no bomb dope
Continue to pear
For steppin' with conceal weapons
Catchin' cases is in
In off the cell that you sleapped in
Lowlifes and big bold letters
Blocked up
A half a key rocked up
I had your ass shot up
I keep dust kicked up
And that's another how you fuck wheels
Born to cause luck
These Outlawz they too much
Rust to the front
And get touched
And it was sluts who hit ya
Go tell 'em
Suck dick and tap
It's the only thing we sell 'em
Catch bullets as they hell 'em
And guess what
Nigga I stay bailin', yellin'
Rider die
Get richer stay high
In this life of mine
Gone were I don't care, I don't care

[Prince Ital Joe]
Gunshots
They tell 'em you go ruff
Gangsta
Buck, buck
Yeah Bad Azz

Bad Azz[Intro: 2Pac]
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
Now what's next

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Caught up in the middle
My life's a riddle
Don't let it get you
I wanna live legal, but it's this hustling that get me richer
Picture one love to my peoples makin' money
I could see your brother avoid all trouble, beware of devils
Continue strugglin' cause nothings impossible
If there's a will there's a way
To get your mind on official business you could get paid
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave to get paid
My niggas do this every fuckin' day we parlay
Through politics and conversations
It's information to my thug niggas in the congregation
Watch and bear witness To the pleasures of participation
Separation is self-destruction what's needed is unification
Cause the world is hardly fair
If not prepared we sure to be buried and be no longer there
Because of me it will evaporate say your prayers
And what's next

[Chorus: 2Pac & Prince Ital Joe]
(The struggles continue, I'm strivin' with my crew )
Tell me what the fuck am I suppossed to do
What's next

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
I plant one on his block chicken after chicken
There was a time that if you slip you caught a stitchin'
And the main position saddition and ghetto politician
My competition's nail 'em all top of the hill
My niggas kill for a thrill
But my soul brings the real I'm all balled out
Tryin' to sell the devil a deal
I'm facin' forty case 'bout to spin a grip
And all my fuckin' homies for me for the same shit
The world is a snake pit your homies turn counterfeit
How much worser can it get I wish I could be legit
And turn this whole thing around
But there's no turnin' back
I'm standing sittin' down which way do I go

[Chorus: Mopreme & Prince Ital Joe]
(The struggles continue, I'm strivin' with my crew )
Tell me what the fuck am I suppossed to do
What's next

[Verse 3: Big Syke]
I often wonder will the ways of today ever change
Now it's like the summer days in the rain we gain
So much it held on through stormy weather
Just your touch and understandin' kept my shit together
No need to swear to stay down
At any costs gave me hugs and pounds
When I took that loss you the boss
Is what you told me and you didn't lie
Promise to never part until we die
Don't cry , baby girl, I know the world is crashin' on us
Plus the thought our relationship was built on trust
Don't fuss I made mistakes you made mistakes too
What can we do but just think this through
Stay true with me don't mess with my enemies
Breakin' up is drivin' me crazy
So I'm highly occupied with women and my homies
To keep me from bein' lonely, so what's next

[Chorus: Big Syke & Prince Ital Joe]
(The struggles continue, I'm strivin' with my crew )
Tell me what the fuck am I suppossed to do
What's next

[Outro: Prince Ital Joe]
What's next
Some of them livin' in a booty complex
Tryin' to make the Thug Life crew vex
Some hate God and some worship checks
So tell me what the fuck's comin' in
If you spit in the sky it gonna drop in your fuckin' eye
You'll never miss the water 'till the well runs dry
Real deep punkster then love a lot
When I clock me Glock some heads gonna fly
Yeah, in case you never know my name is Prince Idol Joe
Kickin' it with the Outlaw Immortal
Them you there is no true
Sing, remember
If you spit in the sky it gonna drop in your fuckin' eye
So don't disrespect at any aspect
Cause you gonna be a fuckin' suspect
Ribits, Yes need some chill
Know what I mean love the youth and then them relove
Catch this
