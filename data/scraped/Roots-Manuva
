Taskmaster burst the bionic zit-splitter
Breakneck speeds we drown ten pints of bitter
We lean all day and some say that ain't productive
Could that depend upon the demon that you're stuck with
Cause right now, I see clearer than most
I sit here contented with this cheese on toast
I feel the pain of a third world famine
Segue, we count them blessings and keep jamming
Tis him - scumbag, scum of the earth, his worth was nil
Until he gained the skill of tongues
From fifteen years young straight to my greyback self
I stay top shelf material, jerk chicken, jerk fish
Breakaway slave, bliss
Generate Gs and then we stash 'em in the Swiss
Fools can't see this, audio pistols
A fistful of hip hop dons, I progression in the flesh
Esoteric quotes, most frightening
Duppy took a hold of my hand while I was writing
Let go me ting, duppy, let go me hand
I summon up the power of Banana Klan

[Hook]
Witness the fitness
The Cruffiton liveth
One hope, one quest
(Repeat x4)

Swigging that deep root juice, now we deh pon a boost
Set them spirit dem loose, go head go slash up the noose
With conclusive proof about the truth, the right
Cause whether we hitch hike or push bike or travel kind of trash
Manifest that with wholesome roots rap
Manifest that, yeah!
I do my zing way, ain't nothing else I know
Gone up in the life with this here rag-and-bone flow
Squeeze the pain from my belly and set my soul free
Travel over ocean, land and sea
Face nuff stress and difficulty
Flung back from the brink, gwan in kinda stink
We don't give a frig about what dem fools think
Frig your network, our dett work will speak for itself
Proof of the trophy and the champion belt
Come sun, come rain, come hailstone pelt

[Hook]

Bwana see me with some old time shit
Let the whole world know we's on some off-key tip
Mega-manic when time the pressure start lick
By the hook or by the crook, by the poop or by the kick
He's sickly cryptic, spitting the code
And most proud to present that Cruffiton mode
And it shows that the bro's done seen a few sleights
Life throws scenarios, reality bites
We in collision with the beast
Lost we religion now we can't get no peace
Idiot weakhearts want fe take I for chief
Stoop to their level and we plotting cold grief
But we should know that discipline maketh the geez
Separation of the DAT from the rap, that's a must
Proceed set speed with the Cruffiton touch
Proceed set speed..Cruffiton, y'all

[Hook][Hook x3]
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)

[Verse: Roots Manuva]
Leviticus, Deuteronomy

Snatch a piece of my wonderin'
Distant-far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like, seat of my boot like
Fly in my soup like, "Where's the waitress?"
Can I take this, really, can I finish this?
These years and all these creatures
It's my mistake, I'll make it
J-dub to the boom now make it
Bounce, wiggle, bounce, wiggle
Shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cutthroats, bound to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain, this ain't no game
I'll show no shame, I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted cane, I'll twist a-gain
I'll push the blade, as plain as day
Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
It's you and who and you-know-where
We's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear, we happy or we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart, from start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach, the soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth over, return of the ogre

[Hook x2]

[Bridge: Martina Topley]
Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be, come and save the night
Cause I don't believe
When the morning comes, it doesn't
Seem to say an awful lot to me, hmmmmmm

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Roots Manuva]

Judge 'em on the come up
It's bound to be your bad luck
Instantly running ways to survive
You judge a man by the risk he takes
To change his faith and place himself
Up in the dreamscape, free from the trappings
The flesh will trap him, the flesh will tap him
And these lights look bright in the city
And one day this might be his city
He got more dreams than Luther King
But pipes of peace might do for him
But some get peace by keeping the peace, in easy reach and being quick to squeeze

[Hook: Roots Manuva]

The road takes a hold on you
Becomes the whole of you
You're looking at the stolen youth
The eggs, the clucker and the golden goose. (X2)

[Verse 2: Roots Manuva]

Honour among thieves is the talk of a fool
The only protection is the talk of your tool
Decent people just stand by watching
Pure disbelief and, happy it's not him
How long does the madness last?
How long is a piece of string?
You're better off being mad as a rasc'
An' then you won't have to face a thing
Run and hide, a french kiss to chaos
Standing firm and waiting for the pay-off
These are those types of days, where it ain't no use in being afraid
The game played here's got the strangest rules
The game played here has got no rules
The pain is life, the pain is death
It's plain as life, and plain as breath

[Hook: Roots Manuva]

The road takes a hold on you
Becomes the whole of you
You're looking at the stolen youth
The egg, the clucker and the golden goose. (X2)And now it seems as if we're used to the shegree
We made our beds and now we hate where these beds be
Took nothing at all to part this Red Sea
I'm a shackled child
Singing the good song of Freedom
They've got no pride, they interrupt our grieving
Tear drops dropping, for the pain of the world
My best friend dies, when she was just a young girl
Left me here, to fend for myself
Now the pain never leaves
We just learn to cope
So when the devil needs hangin will you tie up the rope and shout PULL!
Let's put an end to this bull
Zen thing
How many years before we pratice what we preach
How many tears before we truly clinch the peak
Only to find that there is no honey on the moon
Official goon
With the unofficial croon

[Hook]
I'm All Things to All Men
All of the Women
All the Children
Just say when
And I'll take you to my Tardis
Who's the Hardest
Who's the Hardest

16 bar cycles
Heart felt recital
From the wacky blacky man they should have called me Michael
Look at the monster you make, look at the monster you pay
But you claim no responsibility
Cause it's each to his self
In these times that we live
Does God have a sense of humor then the joke's on us
Cause we're chasing our tails for how long
The tussle makes us how strong
Vintage poor people fun
If we could ease up on these booze and fags
Then just maybe, life wouldn't be so mad
Be a man my dad said
But what the hell he know
He lost his dreams
He lost his flow
And I don't wanna be alone
I'm born King
So where's my throne
I'm too intense
I'm too deep
I'm too nice for life
So what makes this place so nervous?

[Hook]

Look at the monster you make
Look at the monster you pay
But you claim no responsibility
But you claim not
We're searching for Jesus
But I'll be damned
If I'll be crucified by 10,000 spies
Compulsive lies
They Hate Me
They Love Me
They Hate Me

Cause I'm All Things to All Men, All of the Women, All the Children
Just say when and I'll take you to my Tardis
Who's the Hardest
Who's the Hardest[Verse 1]
Fuel injection on a blank page: my mental splurges and emerges from nuttin'
I'm the forgotten
The nude that got caught with two keys in his bottom
We don't know him, we don't owe him
Poetic justice with no poem
I study my art 'til I'm blue in the face
No time to waste, my heart's on a plate
The soul and life force dancing on the timelines
These ain't rhymes no more, they're straight sermons
For urban, suburban Babylonian contours
Raw raw roll up raw, songs of war
To drown out the po-lice and they tracking device
Brehs better mind how they mack on they ice
Cause they transmit and receive
Best know the beast will listen
Throw your glitz as they strip your assets
How vexed thou art, but you are playing a part
In your own damn demise - you money-grips need to get more wise

[Chorus]
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Pursue it, pursue it

[Verse 2]
My ital views come from this ital brew
Something about these struggles and the things they do
The peace-bringers, quote-key-quote singers
Dead ringers for nothing in this marketplace
Could we target grace? A new-tical movement
Bringing improvement to mind and soul
Life's a bitch, we tired of the bitching
Them cheap escape routes got me here twitching
How much money must we waste 'til we see
Them self-made hells that we make for ourself
Goodbye old me, say hello to the new
Please Lord Jesus, help me get through
Can I be a man for my baby boo
What's a grown man supposedly to do
When the world at large be scared of the truth
I got good reason to be uncouth
Like a big wide hole in the top of your roof
And I really don't got much nice to say
When day-to-day is pure bills to pay
So how am I supposed to change my ways
When this world at large seems to lead me astray?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Transfixed by an apparent
Will and a way
To seize the day
Accept us to social fray
Most aware of what the media push
There goes the crooks who fiddle the books and
Run scot-free cause money reigns supreme
In the gene of the fiends
Chemical warfare
Biological warfare
That is never seen
Man and machine
Getting into things while
Some claim road and some claim blame
Oblivious to the time that we're living in
The misled mislead
Afflicted by the greed
Government man keep fighting down the weed
While they boost up the booze, the Prozac and methadone
Use the taxpayer's money to develop they clones
Misinformation
Mass sedation
Nations baited for spiritual rapings

[Chorus  x 2]I bring you ten tonne girth to this homegrown range
Bona fide what you hear, tis the sound of pain
But pain leads to gain so we dare not stagnate
We elevate to that next state, motion divine
Glisten like crystal ball and stand tall
With this knowledge and overstanding
Enterprise landing, bringing dem new brands of buff
Yes, we come proper with potency
Ain't no blood in my body, it's liquid soul in my vein
I dance on a thin line of sane and deranged
And it's all criss once I get neatly in the cipher
Chat like pickney to the piper that pied
As this natural mystic blows through the air
These lessons of life become crystal clear
Precision of my vision is ital
Separating sharks from the blessed is vital
Now I can smell a rat coming from a mile round the corner
One time I bored ya, twice you can't couf
No, we won't stop rebuke thee
You satanics, you fools can't recruit me
Not now while there's

[Hook]
Movements fi make, typhoons grew
Strong and cold-sheist them a still coast through
Movements fi make, typhoons grew
Strong and cold-sheist them a still coast through
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right

I'll slap the bacon out your mouth, dance upon your sarnie
Rolling with Jah bredren dem, God-blessed army
How the hell you gon stop this tide from steady coming
Run and catch in tune with the elements
At speed we proceed, traction for action
Hot 125, government goons get dashed to the side
Too big to slide now, though they try to disguise
I can still recognize devilworks when I see it
Weakheart disciples keep weakheart friends
Always had a hate for what their weakhearts defend
They fiend for that crack, ain't no one to tax
We might run home and smoke a brown bag of seed
Best believe that these times is treacherous
And I know not how else I'm supposed to act
But stand close to culture roots-fi
See me getting deft with that two-step shuffle
Haggling others who for the cause
Reigning with that roots type terror
Freaking at your weakhearty era but
We build, move and prove that we don't suffer fools

[Hook 2x](Great Scott! I say, old bean)
This happens to be the article of fusion
Huh! The roots-fi discotheque
As we move

It's that jet-black flow from the southwest of l-o-n d-o-n
The second nature of the vent dem rebel routine
I scheme and plot, ain't no use in stepping if we don't step hot
Let the movements be made, there's goals to be getting
No second for no love or no fettin
Why there's all these ugly mans on my TV screen?
I wrap my head with foil so I don't catch so I don't catch them beams
The sound of half a downer don't pray fi step solo
We far flung frontier, captain kirk, the sun trekker
Full time I climb, my chip deeper taught as I sow seeds of thought
The fruits of the roots, a vision of splendid splendidness
Now be proud to be spittin in the face of the beast
With each and every move I make, every shite I break
You might watch me but I watch you too
Ain't a thing you can do to stop me!

[Hook 2x]
Whom wants this or that
Watch these enzymes react
How we juggle tings proper
Man, don't

When I swing I'm far fetched like hicks from hicksville
High steps got me trippin from Peckham to Bucks Hill
Still I stand firm through the strife conflict
Motion slick, hip to every ring poli-trick
So I spread love like Lennon and Yoko Ono
Keep vibes slow-mo for a ho-tential
Don't go callin me coon, you'll catch a boot to your jaw
We pro-black, freak that, can't sweep no floor
I heard those my people, them burst their backs
Work hard for eons and paid tax and have not seen jack
In return, how does shit burn
It could well make a guy lose sense and rationale
Onto kamikazes on shifting streets
It's eyeball for eyeball and teeth for teeth
While we spin on this ball of confusion
I sight no solution, cesspits just get more frowsy
Chemical rain got me drunken and drowsy
Rowdy, I got no choice but to be
The living example of a root-fi youth type soldier
Bowling through like there ain't no tomorrow
Brave them terrains of pain and deep sorrow
But still keep sliding on, I try to make sense of the madness
But it seems like I'm wasting my time, it's best I just
Go get me mine, find some inner peace
Climb to higher heights, embrace the light

[Hook 2x]

This living dead noose, the bane of life in the west
But who's down for civil unrest?
In times like these comrades is hard to find
The beast keeps the masses toeing the line
With them sneaky tactics they'll keep them boys running
So they can have a market for their guns and ammunition
Keep the third world in a stagnant position
Begging for monetary aid from IMF
Who don't seem too keen to write off the third world debt
Cause they profit from holding it down
Soon there'll be no dollars, no yens, no pounds
Just madness, microchips and hi-tech war
And all because the beast wants to gain control
Of each and every mind, body, spirit and soul

[Hook 2x]

We keep it jugglin, keep it jugglin[Hook x3]
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)

Awfully Deep, I can't get no sleep
[Repeat 3x]
Things are gettin, Awfully Deep
Awfully Deep, Awfully Deep

[Verse 1]
I don't do mind games, I'm frame by frame
I'm eighteen bits, I'm fourty-eight hertz
My favourite tie tied to my Dicky Dirts
My flirt tac-tics are so damn sublime
MY long-john greased with slippery slime
My prime cut, move ya butt, twist ya nut
From ya don't know issht then keep ya mouth shut
Hut one, hut two, hut three and hut four
A terrible phase is spendin' money wi' whores
A pastor say we shouldn't do that shit
So we sit down, reflect all the sins we commit
How many Hail Marys cut down on the dairy?
Away with the fairies, how much do my fare be?
Two travelcards, my life's so hard
I don't know my inch, from my foot to my yard
(?) God's my body guard, beg you pardon me, pa

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My sanity's back on the line again
Last year, I said I wouldn't rhyme again
But I'm, back for punishment, time again
If I should lose my good mind again
Tell my management not to waste good money
Sendin' me away to the farms of the funny
Them places only make me worse
They full'a, crooked doctors and kinky nurses
That poke you in the arse, and measure your schlong
Put that tape measure down, that practice is wrong
They thought I didn't know what was goin' on
But I, knew the clue although the drugs was strong
Claw-polma, oxidisa-what?
Tell me doctor, why I got purple snot
I'm feelin' happy when I know I'm sad
And now they wanna certify me mad

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They said, "Mr Smith, please calm down
We're not here to hurt you
You're feeling a little bit paranoid
Your brain is over-heating
You're overworked, you're underpaid
And your body's taken a beating"
And I said "You're not seein' things, like how I'm seein' things
I'm seein' things that I don't wanna see
I see the devil sit right before me
Fire in his eyes as he spoke to me"
Blinked, I blinked and I pinched myself
I screamed for Jesus but it was no use
I had to face my, (awful) painful truth
Voodoo in the hills, and I'm runnin' from ghosties
Lightin' up the candles as the spooks approach me
Voodoo in the hills, and I'm runnin' from ghosties

[Hook][Hook: Joe Goddard]
Times are so treacherous We need to stick together
Now the knights are closing in We need to stick together
Where is the heart and soul?
We need to come together
When the youths are so damn cold
We need to stick together

[Verse 1: Dels]

Never sleep in the belly of the beast
Living in a dream in their own﻿ fanstasy
Smothered by their mothers with a breast for a pillow
Desensitised, no minds, hello?
Can you hear me?
Its a transmission fellow
Live feed
I hope you haven't eaten do you mind me?
Projectile force For the main course
Posessed by the force deep inside thee
Hey support blazers like freshly cut grass
Another child dies along will this last
Ain't nothing changed since Britain﻿ turned blue
Except more cops, more problems more sh*t too
Looks like we're all f*cked, no lube
Cameron better steer clear of my arse
Kicked down the doors of Parliment for the truth
And have a word with the PMIR

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dels]

Do they really care for the﻿ disenfranchised?
Man-child really don’t seem to learn
Got the nerve to talk about guns on the streets
When the guns come cheap from the factories
The fact to be, they don’t check those facts
Or they blame and make scapegoats of the blacks
Or anybody else who’s fresh of the boat
Or everybody else who don’t wish to vote for the moderate Blues with designer views
The red top readership holds the clues to
Who's got the money for the PR scams
To pull the wool over the eyes of the everyday man
How many fresh faced youths will they send﻿ to war
Without clear definition of what they fighting for
So what came first the addiction or the drugs?
Modern day thuggery
Pinstripe thugs

[Hook] [x3]

[Outro: Joe Goddard]

I'm lost, just like you
I'm lost, just like you, you
I'm lost, just like you
I'm lost, just like you, you

I'm lost, just like you
I'm lost, just like you, you
I'm lost, just like you
I'm lost, just like you, you
I'm lostAin't nothin but this uncut cruffness I bring
Don't care bout no fad I do my own ting
Giving chase in this rat race, fears we face
And me be on the case, proud plus brave
Ready to be taking them drastic measures
Get me my treasure then splurt
Could not give a brand new blouse and skirt
I told you both through, fight through the bleak
Clench my teeth dweet, ends often meet
By any which method, positivities be we shepherd
We pounce like left limb leopard
If you ever see me in the street pulling brand new good moves
You're wrong to confuse me with regular riff-raff, I got me cause and calling
Never have I held any love for stalling
Rush and make haste
You down for rebellion left-handed cruff we embrace the minellium

(chorus)
Ticka-ticka tock my golden pen
Scribble 'pon the paper from yassa to when
We drop style 'pon the heathens dem
Those who can't dig it well I feel the problem

Ain't no record that can hold me, I'm oversized
Ears ever be open to the words of the wise
But there's untold cats on my corner perpetrating
Read a few books and now their talking
They're looking to convert yours truly, but I'm unruly
Plus, for the crew like cooly folk
Mixing up the Guinness with the raw egg yolk
Cos it's all about strength while we walk through the valley of the snipe, heathens
Get thee from my sight, you cats is ever eager
To preach up in my face when you just about scrape to know all that is
How the hell you try to tell me coca-cola got fizz?
I read your pamphlet four times, It don't make sense
You front like you be scholar, Smith smells pretence
Yous best get off your horse, drink your milk, get the frig out
It goes

(chorus)

What the frig makes you friggers want to frig with this?
Now you fools got me living with this mental fist
That I wear with knuckledusters, taking out these frogs in their clusters
Three by three, five by five
How would you describe this left handed loony
Toony votoony, dancegate pressure
Heading through the back door straight to the bar
Then I'm gonna get me some firewater
Then I'm gonna scope out a young fine daughter
Ah yes, its my wayward nature
Hip to a caper, soon to have a house with X amount of acre
It goes

(chorus) x3[Hook - Roots Manuva *singing*]

Collosal Insight {Collosal, man}
Invites the soul {Inviting of the soapbox}
Sturdy on the good foot {More sturdy}
Collosal Insight {Collosal!}
Invites the soul {Inviting thy soul}
Sturdy on the good foot

[Verse 1]
Gracious Lord, my mega oh mighty!
I know I been slightly, out your path
Feelin' the cold draft,of the bleek winter
Splinters in my soul, I'm out of control
And I know, that I should cut down this drinkin'
Too many late nights and, wayward thinkin'
Compellin' a man to plan to shennanigans
The boy in me out and I got to be the man again
Cause I didn't rhyme to get me rich
But I'm a scally, two two's you'll find I switch
Hurt and pain made me, nothin' came to save me
I walk with disaster, prefer to be plastered
'times my master don't ask me for jack turd
All I owns is my balls and my word
No-body heard'a me, cause I'm a new man
I got this new plan, to get these new grams

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
People call my name like, it's some kinda game like
I ain't got no fame like, I'm just the same type
Shoutin' out vain lights - "Move ya lurgy"
I'm far too nervy, observin' this world
Who the? Where the? What the? How the?
Media whores keep, shovellin' powder
It's nothin' to be proud of, but stuff goes on
Perceptions change, wrong's right an' right's wrong
Hoopla-hooblahing, devil keeps snarlin'
Bite-bites and it's sellin' more more more
This could well'a be my, last LP
I've had a good run, I've made a few G's
I've had a bag of fun, I've smoked a few trees
Now I wanna rest my, knobbly knees
All in all I been feelin' the pinch
And those bourgeois blacks have been far from convinced
But, I don't give a damn about UK rap
I'm a UK black makin' UK tracks
And, I got love for everyone of those scenes
And them pigeon-holes were never nothin' to hold me

[Hook](Chorus)
Dah dah dah dah dah

Dreamy days, come what may, we feel no way
Theres gonna be fun and lots of laughter

(Chorus: repeat 2X)

I'm just a long foot Bandito
I might take of my shoes, won't take off my socks tonight
Take a little peep under that frock tonight
But there'll be no body pop, pop tonight
You know my style I keep it on a holy out-of-body mind blown
We in some zone
So how deep can we sow those seeds
And procede to buck the limit?
Spinnin' in a whirlpool, essential peek
Messin' around with all those chemical rushes
When natural highs come a whole lot cheeper
Sweet Tagita got me singin', baby baby babe
I got the sudden urge to misbehave
I want to take you away from all the stresses
Buy you nice flowers and expensive dresses
You don't belive me, you think I'm cheesy!?

(Chorus: repeat 2X)

I want to feel ya, I want to know ya, I want to hold ya
But at the same time situations are complex
Cause you got particulars, I got particulars
Old circles are sick of us
Cause we're walkin' down a prim-rose road
To everything and nothing
So can you picture past the honeymoon
Where you'll beat me with a wooden spoon
And you got me sleepin' on the couch
Now I'm thinkin' who's house is this?
This is my money, this is my pain
These are my drugs, This is my brain
And its never gonna be the same
Its just

(Chorus: repeat 2X)

I'm a one man power house succeding within the scene
Son of the soil, livin' the love livin' the dream
Whipper-snappers get jealous, it's true they don't know
About my x-amount of heart break, years of low dough
We professional, we dealin' with business
Revolution creep up, slap you on the nose bridge
Toots in the back room gettin' the dosh
And these women in my black book they all quite posh
Still I wash my own brief, wash my own socks
I'm cocksure, the horny bastard's greasy pole
Square peg in a round hole, too much show now
Some say I'm arrogant, some say I'm layed back
From a council flat payin' higher-rate tax
Who's the dad? who's the geez? must be; Manuva MC
With a second LP, for all the girls I got the vitality
It's my

(Chorus: repeat 4X)[Intro: Roots Manuva]
How many y'all guys say want freestyle?
There will be no blows not freestyle
This style is not free, the style is expensive alright!!
Hold tight youth

[Verse 1: Roots Manuva
Love of self I possess, through life to death
Yigga y'all, yes'm it's the up front fresh
My level is seldom seen, few and far between
Them fools they couldn't douse my keen
??Lean to the mean for a Brad-picky-head??
Slapped in the face, trapped down I guess
Sunset to sunset, but don't sweat yet
??Cool and don't fret while the doves them hold me??
I'm picky with precision, I've made my decision then
Death itself can't hold us down
Cause the seeds of progress, dem done get sowed
My tough back, broke the cane in four
Face flat to the floor but I found the strength
To commence with a brand new sense of self
Here go Zulu, comin' through
Tokyo train style, hip it to the crew

[Chorus: Leftfield & Roots Manuva]
(Down like dirt man we dusted), get up!
(Down like dirt man we dusted), get up!

[Verse 2: Roots Manuva]
Nothing but my cuts and my rebel life flex
But I won't waste my breath, I'll let actions speak
Tough this beat stands taller than the peak of Everest
I visualize, embrace the progress
Chin-high, puff chest, I get right to it
The choice is, there is no choice but to pursue it
Soul on the mind, mind on the soul
My struggle remains, but my inside grows

[Chorus]

Against the grain we shall remain, huh
Yeah, steamin' on

[Verse 3: Roots Manuva]
Gain enough guff, gain enough ground
Movement tight, planet-wide flight
In a tight set to step to the hype
Left-to-the-field now, lookin' good
Wait till this wayward bounce
Proud to announce I'm steadfast - stuck in my way
I heed not no hearsay: I put my trust in my
Own perceptions and knowledge of self

[Chorus: Leftfield & Roots Manuva]

Get yourself into hard life - get up!

[Outro: Roots Manuva]
The power of the inner eye huh
That's the strength of we
Groove, word, birth to the next realm
Motion splendid, it bring quality
Now my foresight see with nuff clarity
Motion splendid, it bring quality
Now my foresight see with nuff clarity

Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight[Chorus]

Here we go again
Run into me when you find out you got no friends
I’m sick of your pretence
A pose upon man say you big dog upon your rates
Thats a lie, ay?

[Verse 1 - Roots Manuva]

It’s funny how life comes and scolds a dude
Certain people don’t wanna learn but he shows a 'tude
And those blokes never used to go to school
Now they wanna come and push up with some playground moves
And a grown man should put down those childish things
And let the knowledge of one’s self resinate within
But something in his life isn’t right with him
He’s caught up in the hype and it bites within
And I hear him say he closer to the pirating
There ain't no business of my own and that’s his private ting
And these days I really can’t be tight with him
Back in the days we used to raise, we used to blaze the wing
That was then, now is now
We flex a little different
We more significant, we more eloquent
We more relevant, hyptic element
Set for the betterment, and now we’re telling them…

[Chorus]


[Verse 2]

I told the boy that it's best that he knows his self
Take time with his study and he grows his self
Be aware of the mimicry of prankster life
Theres truely few on the road that lead a gangster life
Best we motivate and give thanks for life
Or wind up paying at a costly price
Big our minds up, quick to be hypnotised
Fighting for monitary crumbs, and feable prize
Judge it, blessed we are
And people with a small mind, streched with nah
Power with the paranoid, putrid debaters
Lonely patriots, trapped in the matrix
Blind to the sacred
Nature of the sufferer, to reinvent
And heal thy self with the wealth and the know-how
Power to pursue, shall get through
Rebel on the hurt now, Rebel know truth

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Run into me when you find out you got no friends
I’m sick of your pretence
I push up on man say you big dog upon your rates
Thats a lie, ay?
Here we go again
Run into me when you find out you got no friends
I’m sick of your pretence
I push up on man say you big dog upon your rates
Thats a lie, ay?[Hook]
I'm inna

[Verse 1]
There were trendy wannabes staring in my face
As I stepped to the place I could taste their glare
Tall hair, small hair, nuff shapes of hair
Swinging out blabber with the coin to spare
Me myself, I only got five quid to spend
And once I've broken this note my pockets on a bend
Supping on a brew so my vibe gets stirred
Feeling kind of brave as my vision is blurred
Skeets in the place, they blow my mind
I rehearse my approach and I picks my time
Second thoughts at last would distress my night
So I was just content with them sight
It were me on my jack jones, lone getting down
Freaking to the sound as the bass bins pound
I'm inna..

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cotching at the bar side, taking in the view
Press luck, trying to scrounge me a next pint of brew
It's not my relevant spot, see I know nobody
So I assume the role of some tender somebody
To attract the attention of some cat with some dough
Be it Jane or Flo', I'm slick with god flow
Looking down at my feet, 'tender' written cross my face
Hoping that some skeet aids my case
Twenty minutes pass and I gets no joy
I brainstormed in a gear for my plan deployed
It was a skeet behind the bar, almost dark as me
Needed a drink so her dream lover had to be me
I said 'Hon, I love the way you work that square
I know you's a ten and you got nice hair'
I blew she two kisses, two tries and I misses
Third time lucky, I'm hitting the target
She's warming to my vibe, looking deep into my eyes
I'm spewing out lies but she's none the wiser
Said 'I can't find my bredren with my twenty pound note
I'm feeling kind of hoarse in the throat'
She steps to the brew tap, pumps me a brew
I said 'Hon, I really don't expect this of you'
Pushed the brew to my hand and I grips it tight
Turns her back and I slips out of sight
I'm inna..

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Back in the midst of them sweaty boogie folk
Some cat comes up and tries to sell me some smoke
I said 'What you got, weed or hash?' He said 'Hash'
I said 'I don't smoke that but I'll take a quick blast'
It was a potent cocktail, this hash and brew
I flips, acting like I'm not known to do
Strips down to my waist, I was feeling hot
Getting wild sensations from my head to my...
In a drunken stupor, sweating on this skeet
The company of us cats, they didn't want to keep
Then in came my bartender friend and two bouncers
Accusing me of theft, Lord knows I should've left
But this buzz in me was like grinning up my jaw
Before I knew shite I were flat 'pon the floor
Inna, man..

[Hook][Roots Manuva]
2na Manuva get gettin the got

Good god ah, yes man, its auspicious man
Oh God (good night)......

Who's that?

[Chali 2na]
My escapades exceed Caddy Escalades
I best behave to the rhythm of justice slaves
Selected brave ah lecture me extra waves
Doggin your sounds causing you clowns just to cave
Address the rage rush the stage just to blaze
Glorify your glamour and gorers just to faze
Cutting down the rainforest for cows just to graze
It's killin the populous while you clone test tube babes
Test the change cuz of the fantasies they try to feed us
Under the bridge drumming for Flea and Anthony Kiedis
I ran from elitist who got the truth confused
It's the Manphibian and the one Roots Manuva

[Roots Manuva]
Yo, Mystic Mindset travel at warp 8
Flashback to my very first taste of hash cake
Oh Lord I feel so sensual And every now and then I get a great sense of whoah!..
Synchronization of the hip gyration of the old time New Right
Back to Back, Man or no man no matter oh man boy or boy girl or girl
Steppin out of place with the light of the world im locked up
Weed grass rushing thru my veins slip over the rocky terrain and maintain
Like a weed whore checkin that hydroponic buck
Earth child, come see me rolling in the muck
He there go ever so civilized while I unrobe
No played out to catch wives
Don't wanna get knicks up in their mix up
Wanna just fix up mind soul and mental plane

(Chorus 2x Both)
Join the Dots, block blood in the block
Knock knockin the not, the which the where the what
2na Manuva get gettin the got
Stewed chicken in the dutch pot runnin it hot

[Chali 2na]
Yo some of these fellas be over zealous
We have them darks jealous in dark cellas
Blowing like branford marsalis
We park dwellers rhythm rebellers
We spark letters we art sellers
Pleadin the waters the sharks fell us
Be quick with your camcorder In no particular plan order
We go hit like vehicular man slaughter sing

[Roots Manuva]
In ding bring a fling of bringin it on
Refuse to get lost in the quest for wong
Although we trans-atlantic we never pedantic
Check my antic, we most romantic
We plan shit new for self Quantumly
We killin the saw man we killin the sea

[Repeat 2X]
Join the Dots, block blood in the block
Knock knockin the not, the which the where the what
2na Manuva get gettin the got
Stewed chicken in the dutch pot runnin it hot

[Roots Manuva]
No Sir Mr. 2na, I can't burn the blunt
I remember the last time and how I got t'ump

[Chali 2na]
Yo Yo, You ran slower while my clan grow chance'll
Let the man know my pen brush stroke like Van Gogh
I disappear like his missing ear when I'm switchin gears
Shining like your kitchen ware rhymes rich and rare
Get your picture clear, 2na the stealth reporter
I melt your order like sugar and seltzer water
Whoever felt the horror but knows that their chance vague
Surround your sound like a spandex pants leg
Spread like an advanced plague worms never dance may
Shout the f and f that beats my man craig

[Repeat 2X]
Join the Dots, block blood in the block
Knock knockin the not, the which the where the what
2na Manuva get gettin the got
Stewed chicken in the dutch pot runnin it hot(Great Scott! I say, old bean)
This happens to be the article of fusion
Huh! The roots-fi discotheque
As we move

It's that jet-black flow from the southwest of l-o-n d-o-n
The second nature of the vent dem rebel routine
I scheme and plot, ain't no use in stepping if we don't step hot
Let the movements be made, there's goals to be getting
No second for no love or no fettin
Why there's all these ugly mans on my TV screen?
I wrap my head with foil so I don't catch so I don't catch them beams
The sound of half a downer don't pray fi step solo
We far flung frontier, captain kirk, the sun trekker
Full time I climb, my chip deeper taught as I sow seeds of thought
The fruits of the roots, a vision of splendid splendidness
Now be proud to be spittin in the face of the beast
With each and every move I make, every shite I break
You might watch me but I watch you too
Ain't a thing you can do to stop me!

[Hook 2x]
Whom wants this or that
Watch these enzymes react
How we juggle tings proper
Man, don't

When I swing I'm far fetched like hicks from hicksville
High steps got me trippin from Peckham to Bucks Hill
Still I stand firm through the strife conflict
Motion slick, hip to every ring poli-trick
So I spread love like Lennon and Yoko Ono
Keep vibes slow-mo for a ho-tential
Don't go callin me coon, you'll catch a boot to your jaw
We pro-black, freak that, can't sweep no floor
I heard those my people, them burst their backs
Work hard for eons and paid tax and have not seen jack
In return, how does shit burn
It could well make a guy lose sense and rationale
Onto kamikazes on shifting streets
It's eyeball for eyeball and teeth for teeth
While we spin on this ball of confusion
I sight no solution, cesspits just get more frowsy
Chemical rain got me drunken and drowsy
Rowdy, I got no choice but to be
The living example of a root-fi youth type soldier
Bowling through like there ain't no tomorrow
Brave them terrains of pain and deep sorrow
But still keep sliding on, I try to make sense of the madness
But it seems like I'm wasting my time, it's best I just
Go get me mine, find some inner peace
Climb to higher heights, embrace the light

[Hook 2x]

This living dead noose, the bane of life in the west
But who's down for civil unrest?
In times like these comrades is hard to find
The beast keeps the masses toeing the line
With them sneaky tactics they'll keep them boys running
So they can have a market for their guns and ammunition
Keep the third world in a stagnant position
Begging for monetary aid from IMF
Who don't seem too keen to write off the third world debt
Cause they profit from holding it down
Soon there'll be no dollars, no yens, no pounds
Just madness, microchips and hi-tech war
And all because the beast wants to gain control
Of each and every mind, body, spirit and soul

[Hook 2x]

We keep it jugglin, keep it jugglinI bring you ten tonne girth to this homegrown range
Bona fide what you hear, tis the sound of pain
But pain leads to gain so we dare not stagnate
We elevate to that next state, motion divine
Glisten like crystal ball and stand tall
With this knowledge and overstanding
Enterprise landing, bringing dem new brands of buff
Yes, we come proper with potency
Ain't no blood in my body, it's liquid soul in my vein
I dance on a thin line of sane and deranged
And it's all criss once I get neatly in the cipher
Chat like pickney to the piper that pied
As this natural mystic blows through the air
These lessons of life become crystal clear
Precision of my vision is ital
Separating sharks from the blessed is vital
Now I can smell a rat coming from a mile round the corner
One time I bored ya, twice you can't couf
No, we won't stop rebuke thee
You satanics, you fools can't recruit me
Not now while there's

[Hook]
Movements fi make, typhoons grew
Strong and cold-sheist them a still coast through
Movements fi make, typhoons grew
Strong and cold-sheist them a still coast through
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right

I'll slap the bacon out your mouth, dance upon your sarnie
Rolling with Jah bredren dem, God-blessed army
How the hell you gon stop this tide from steady coming
Run and catch in tune with the elements
At speed we proceed, traction for action
Hot 125, government goons get dashed to the side
Too big to slide now, though they try to disguise
I can still recognize devilworks when I see it
Weakheart disciples keep weakheart friends
Always had a hate for what their weakhearts defend
They fiend for that crack, ain't no one to tax
We might run home and smoke a brown bag of seed
Best believe that these times is treacherous
And I know not how else I'm supposed to act
But stand close to culture roots-fi
See me getting deft with that two-step shuffle
Haggling others who for the cause
Reigning with that roots type terror
Freaking at your weakhearty era but
We build, move and prove that we don't suffer fools

[Hook 2x]We're gonna do it like
We're gonna do it like we're supposed to do it

[Hook]
Don't nobody got no love for Smith
There ain't no peace, there ain't no justice
And it seem like much of a muchness
But right now I really couldn't care much less
Don't nobody got no love for Smith
There ain't no peace, there ain't no justice
And it seem like much of a muchness
But right now I really couldn't care much less

[Verse 1]
I'm the lost, the found
The good penny, the bad pound
Getting me down
That's the reason for me dancing
I shake my tush to the pictures in the music
Immune to the decadence, I found some meaning
Places I've been in, slapping the demons
Cleansing the heathens, Land's End to St. Stephen's
Rhyme with no reason, son of the fifth season
Soon as I'm on the case, soon as I'm leaving
Artisan outlaw, long-time looney
Black George Clooney, moody in the midnight
Fifteen tablets, check my prescription
I seen the shrinks and they say that I'm too pristine
I said I'm too sta-quo with a government health risk
See my todger with the luminous piss

Chorus

[Verse 2]
Wayward son of a Johnson, no Charlie, no Bronson
Steady we on some, looking to lump sum
Pull up a gumption, thanks for your function
There ain't no assumption
She said, "Me know son, please bring the lotion
For good body tou'ing with the good body motion"
Bitter or habitual
Flinging my bling-bling, this my inkling, to walk with the in-thing
Outernational ghetto hoo-rah
Big-time passion, splash the hoopla
Cigars on pushbikes, first-class flights
First-class trains, people look at me strange
They don't know my name but they know my pain
Cause I'm the dude in the corner getting steadily caned

Chorus

[Verse 3]
As the hip-hop Holy Ghost touches my spirit
I'm spiritually uplifted, that's what the spirit did
And now I'm known and I'm prone to the feeling of having a buff pocket but still wanna go stealing
Rap life, you should've taught me better
From the very first day when I very first met ya
I seen the trends, the fads and the phases
The whole host of points of view brought to the stages
The sound of "P" made me feel more conscious
Tuned up my mind to the system design, but
Those were the days, the era of yester
Now the whole scene's progressed to pimps and OGs
Now I'm the fogey kicking the bogey
With nothing in between and no place for me
Yes I'll take to the trends and split the cliches
I'm a pimpernel man, U-V-A
Defender of the soul fight and the soul decay
Cause no...
Nobody

ChorusAlright, okay

I arise in the morntime and cut through fresh books
Put them old Bruck trainers on my foot
For I am the picky mystic, I max the most
Drinking ginseng tea, eating huddle bread toast
While my skeet nags, jacks up my coat
She don't like the smell of my smoke
She says my eyes dem is red
And I need to go and fix up my head
Honey, my head is fixed
I'm getting deep with my purpose
Synchronizing to the mystics of cosmic energy
My specialty be to write buff raps
Weakhearts, they hate me like my name was poll tax
I don't part for none, I be the Godsend, God gifted
I work nuff shifts turning a penny to a pound
]From a pound to jacks, from a jacks to a score
My brainwaves is twisted, my tactics is raw
Cause I

[Chorus 2x]
Grip my teal boom as hard as I can
So I can find me a path through the sinking sands

[Sober Now]
Shit's hit the fan but I'm not the fan the shit's hit
It's the man with the bad arse bitch in town
Put her into the circles but she tore them down
And I frown, but in my heart I know it's all good
So I stick around like a true friend should
And they say that some things in life can't be really mended
But only time will tell how well you and your spark prevail
Try not to implore to the stereotype factors
That they brand us with cause there's enough love to give
Oh, Lord! What's happening to me?
All these situations I'm checking with intense scrutiny
I need to slow down there and hold the horses
And just concentrate on paving the right courses
So, so, so, so, so I

[Chorus x3]

[Roots Manuva]
Putting the reins on the joke ting in rap ting
We be inner city sorcerer rebel types, we roll!
Snowball effect planet wide
Diving and ducking, constantly rucking with the devil
Actions speak so we get active
Roots-fi perspective holds my mental in position
I supervision coach my decision
Cause there's may routes to take, much money to make
I fight not to buckle under pressure
I'm on a quest, got to find that real self
Uno priority be wealth in the mental
Cause nothing down sweet like the feeling I reap
When I plan with my peeps and them plans come together
Strong and cold-sheist, them coast the ill weather
I weren't supposed to be but still am
Vibes catch a hold of my mind, I write jams
Take it to the mans dem for the 'instant rewind'
If I gets no rewind still I pay fools no mind
Cause Hylton Smythe never took no bribe
I be independent, my jacket stay stinking
Nuff of them be thinking that the smile's off-key
They're right, I'm full of mad eccentricities
I believe in the power of the G-o-d
While nuff of them be burning their obeah candle
I strap on my sandal and walk like Jesus

[Chorus 4x](Roots Manuva)
Sin sinners, I got to talk to you about your sins
Sins on street corners, Sins in your shops
Sinny Sin Sins in your streets of yours
Sins in your eyes, sins gonna make you cry
Oh Lord, can you help me with my sins?
Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins

I was raised in a pentecostal Church of God
My father was the deacon, he used to stand preaching
I used to to steal collection, I used to catch a beating
Forgive me Lord, I knew not what I did
I was just a kid, trying to hustle up a quid
Feeling kinda ashamed, riding in the Church right
Bible in my hand, dressed in my sunday best
Reach a Churchyard and I'm feeling depressed
I'm in the midst of the well-dressed, talking 'bout singing, singing
Thanks and praise to the king of the Jews
And I'm all confused, 'cos I can't see the sense
Why should I turn the other cheek and get beat?
Ain't no peace without war so who am I?
The faster drives benz, got me looking to the sky
Singing soon, very soon, we gonna see the king
Soon oh, very soon, we all gonna be blamed

Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins

Woke up one Sunday, feeling kinda raw
I said "Dad, I don't really want to go Church no more"
Soon as I said shit, I felt a slap to my jaw
He said "Son, as long as your living under my roof
Your gonna heed my interpretation of the truth
And the truth is right here
It's written in this book the Holy Bible
It's the key to survival so you best heed the word"
He said, "Do as I say, not what I do
And you'll see, goodness will follow you"
Begrudgingly, I ironed my shirt, polish my shoes
Went to Chruch and I took in their far-out views
With their strange perceptions of Heaven and Hell
To this very day I still fight down their spell
'Cos all that we pray, we still stay poor
With that leaky roof dripping on the front room floor

Sins gonna make you cry
Oh Lord, can you help me with my sins?
Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins

Please don't get me twisted, I'm far from a heathen
This is just a simple song of basic rhyme and reason
It's not my meaning to demean or blaspheme
But most things in the Bible ain't as plain as they seem
Can I trust King James to translate these papers?
Do I need a middle-man to link with the creator
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
Church band plays, now I'm spending my pound
Looking for a short-cut to the road to Zion
We can't fool God, but we wasting time trying
Two third of the truth is yet to be told
Two thousand years of corruption soon unfold

Sins in your eyes, sins gonna make you cry
Oh Lord, can you help me with my sins?
Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins[Roots Manuva]
Yes, yes.. it's about that time
For the combo combine, yes
Formin easy tuxedo grooves
Well.. well.. well well well
Well well well well!
You know what?

We scribble art, herbal verbal, love dip dot
Audio cartwheels that cart
We tootin from, holy baggy bone flow ??
Man overboard, he put he trust into jazz chord
Say me? None of them betray me
Bigger endin pay me, so I
Clench my teeth and said nay
Thou shalt not cause me loss of my positivity
Of elastic band who keeps springin back
Slender kid sings for dumpling
Jump into the booth with the proof of the pain
These hand concrete owl, ten hour of sneezing
Wheezing, coughing up blood
Now I'm in the mood for peace, space and time
We sit back, relax, and recool, recline
.. and we're thinking of ..

Starlight, in her lucid skies
In her mu-sic-al, so all sublime

Yo, yo
Smack in the middle of the mayhem, we chase no checks
Thinkin we a ho, now we hide from debts
Mr. Landlord, beg you please? Hear this plea
I'll be back in three weeks with three months in advance
On some good arty flex kind sir give me a chance
Blighty new face yes? Make a toast
To the host of the picnics
These capital hearty terrifics, some of them keep it real while
We be keep it cricket, Smythe, Smith
Peppergrain width, whackin in four fours
Smackin it for six, armchair critics be yellin out fix
Even though they know we don't spar with them
So the score ain't a dream
Place a bet and be grit, from be lose or win
It's the same damn ting, just a need for space
Peace in time, we sit back relax and cool recline
And we think of..

Starlight, starlight, in the distant skies
Sending me, sending message on starlight

We's feelin the season, that type of season where it
Sit watchin breeze and, we on the backroad
In the high ?? cap, where we distress the stress
Digital funk max modes for protest
On some ill and gully horseback, whole damn mix tight
Some of them stay fair yes de mess of dem'll run for they life
Mamma time tales no lies
Diggin for treasure when it were right before my eyes
Dead end streets dem, we keepin men to mice
Pur-chase telescopes and watch the skies
Surveryin revealed, all types of healing
We love to know, so we dance on the ceiling
She sassy material, as she send nuff waves to my aerial
Make me nuff, Mueslix for cereal
And she put me in the mood for space, peace and time
We sit back relax, and recool recline
Yes, because of starlight.. yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah[Verse 1: Roots Manuva]

Judge 'em on the come up
It's bound to be your bad luck
Instantly running ways to survive
You judge a man by the risk he takes
To change his faith and place himself
Up in the dreamscape, free from the trappings
The flesh will trap him, the flesh will tap him
And these lights look bright in the city
And one day this might be his city
He got more dreams than Luther King
But pipes of peace might do for him
But some get peace by keeping the peace, in easy reach and being quick to squeeze

[Hook: Roots Manuva]

The road takes a hold on you
Becomes the whole of you
You're looking at the stolen youth
The eggs, the clucker and the golden goose. (X2)

[Verse 2: Roots Manuva]

Honour among thieves is the talk of a fool
The only protection is the talk of your tool
Decent people just stand by watching
Pure disbelief and, happy it's not him
How long does the madness last?
How long is a piece of string?
You're better off being mad as a rasc'
An' then you won't have to face a thing
Run and hide, a french kiss to chaos
Standing firm and waiting for the pay-off
These are those types of days, where it ain't no use in being afraid
The game played here's got the strangest rules
The game played here has got no rules
The pain is life, the pain is death
It's plain as life, and plain as breath

[Hook: Roots Manuva]

The road takes a hold on you
Becomes the whole of you
You're looking at the stolen youth
The egg, the clucker and the golden goose. (X2)[Intro]
Mind to motion. Know the notion
Notion! Know shun, No. no - shun...

[Verse 1: Roots Manuva]
Nightime passes - sleep man in the valley
Is a discount two-penny with no vampire flock
As you can tell, I'm from a basic stock
I get vexed an' wanna beat the world with a pork chop
Off beat ... lost the key and can't find it
Representation of the spit in the grit
The devil on my shoulder keep tellin' me shit
Constantly got me feeling like I'm losin' my grip
Whats'on in my head - I tried fight back the hate
I look into the mirror - see the face of a mistake
Should I really be here, should I really exist?
Should I take these drugs? Should I get so pissed?
I dedicate this to the tippler crew
Getting drunk, playing punk on the stylophone
The zone of coasters. coastin' far
Pissin' in a bottle while drivin' in the car
Lager lout rap, do you dig my niche?
Tokin' too nuff on the pipes of peace...
Cruff-neck scout you know we bought and about
They major hope in a time o' deep doubt
We's feelin' the feelin' of knowing the feeling and
Lovin' the feeling cuz it feels so crisp...
Posse on cue they'mouf we jump an' twist
Each and every time we catch a style like this ...

[Hook]
Hither to ... bear witness. { tra la la la }
To the Birth... { tra la la la }
Of the Brute ...{ tra la la la }
And furthermore { tra la la la }
Of the brute { tra la la la }
Sing .. brute away .. { tra la la la }

[Verse 2: Roots Manuva]
Stone the Crows my hands stay giddy
I dance with hippy chicks more madder than lizzy
I could never understand all the hoorah fuss
Until my drink got spike with a spoon of moondust
Dancin' into the night - into the day!
Within my soul aboard the slow decay
Singin' yippe-yie-yeay - tribal flashback
Back to square one - sound o' Drum
The tongue of the book - the look of the crooked
Purple lord please - run come save me...
I don't wanna live until I'm dying to die
My types o' heaven is a good clean supply
Love for my tiddly-whack
Bliss for the todger. More jolly than roger
With a wad of pink notes ... singin'
One rums, two rums,three rums, four
Drink five rums and we fall on the floor

[Hook]
{tra la la la } Hither to! Bear Witness ...
The brute! {tra la la la }
The birth of the brute .. {tra la la la }
And furthermore {tra la la la }
The Brute .. shall stay .. Brutish!
Yes ... Yes ... and Furthermore ... Yes
The Brute live ... The brute love ...
The brute know ... Brute .. away ...
Brute .. ality ... Brutism .. The brute![Verse 1]
Guns, bitches, hoes, crack
Death and disease, and a baseball bat
S-T-Ds that have no name
Down at the clinic with a face full'a shame
Russian Roulette with a naked flame
Dangerously slow but in the fast lane
A big nose bleed and a bag of cocaine
Just got the news about the tumour in my brain
But we don't care so we sniff it all the same
Caught my best friend sleepin' with my girlfriend, Jane
Now I'm thinkin' of a way to get them slain
Assassins for hire, they shall get paid
Two-G, Three-G, what-ever it costs
None of those fools shoulda got me crossed
I'm just about ready for some treachorous fame
Ten grenades on the plane, whoops, another Dunblane

[Verse 2]
Mass murderin', brains on the floor
You're dead cause I said you shouldn't live no more
You done made me, lose my cool
Where's my tool? Who's the bigger fool?
Road rage, pavement rage, all kinds of rage
You're lucky if you get to see some old age
Every other day's a good day to die
Best be careful, if you's love your life
You don't know nothin', you don't see nothin'
You don't be nothin', you don't do nothin'
But we all got to be something, and somebody
But everybody here can't be that rich
You know the sayin' - "Life's a bitch"
I got my finger on the trigger with a nervous twitch
Keep your mouth shut, help me dig this ditch
Don't you be, a stupid bitch

[Verse 3]
I took a blunt knife, and cut a piece of my heart
That's my sacrifice, my wayward device
It sound mad though, my self-mutilation like
Doctor Foster and his very first patients
God's unhappy cause we man's praisin' himself
Plannin' to get to heaven with that earthly wealth
Blood money, grudge money, no-body budge money
Mass futility, souls on the guillotine
Meantime I unravel, callin' Jimmy Saville
"Come fix my epitome, I bid to leave this bitterness"
