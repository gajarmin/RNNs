[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Pull up to the parking lot, 84's they pokin' out
Lil' momma wanna see my rims
Can’t wait 'till I pull them out
Talk about 'em to her friends
They tellin' her don't ask me out
Cause they know just how I roll
Plus those hoes wanna ask me out
I take clips when I hit that strip
So I’mma do this to the casket drop
Wrist cold, and my jewels
Just like Baskin Robbins
Benz just like the whip
I’m trying to put momma in
You bitch wanna leave comments
I just use her face as my condom
My whip black, call it ebonics
Pockets fat, super humongous
Got two hoes lovin' to tongue me
And my whip call it jumanji
I’m an animal in this game, pull up
A barn never bummy want the bread don’t you crumb me
Swang wide, bitches love it!

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I know you like my car
I know you like my ring
I’m living like a star, baby money ain’t a thing
She says she loves my rims
Says she loves the way I swang
Nigga grippin' wood grain, pussy drippin' candy paint
Your girl wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang
Your girl wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang
Your girl wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang
Shit, these girls wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang

[Verse 2: Doughbeezy]
Ungh!
She say she lovin' the way I be swangin my slab
And how I be keepin that drank in my cup
Like Kirko, I'm bangin' and brangin' it back
Keep dank in a sack
Rollin up nothin' but sticky
I keep me a thicky
She call me to fuck and unbutton my dickies
She suck and leave nothin'- no nut or no hickies
I'm up in yo city, rollin' one deep
Got no niggas wit me
Dro in a mini
I used to roll lac now it's 4's on a hemi, wit screens hangin' down
Like an old lady titty
I keep 2 cups in my cup holder
Wit' yo gal sending me text saying come over
Cause I got Houston on my back like Slim Thug's shoulder
And I know you like my car, and love the way that I swang
When I grip the wood she grip on mine and give me head while I'm changin' lanes
And it's a shame, cause I know yo ass wouldn't fuck me on a huffy
But the fact that a nigga swangin' make all of the hoes love me, and I...

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
Way how to swang
Lane to lane while I grip the grain
Got your bitch peeping me when you ain’t peeping game
Fifty on a ring couple hundred on a chain
Went from being broke, to big ballin', man!
Man now I'm cool watch me do the damn fool
Breaking boys out homestead avenue (HOMESTEAD!)
Coming through!
All blue, some green
Repping for the team
And every single one clean
Not me your girl watching
Baby momma popping, I’m about to get what they want
Cause they won’t stop me
Drop it, it’s time to go and bag a mil'
Got every bad bitch on deck, but I only fucked 10

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

She pop the pussy she throw it back (hol' up bitch)
She ttu (too turnt up)
She got them racks
She got a car
Her own house
Her own money
Her own (?)
She's on top she's on top
She's on top she's on top
She's on top she got guap
She's on top she's on top
She's on top

[Verse 1: Doughbeezy]
She poppin pussy for a purse but I swear when she throw that ass she need a shopping spree
She independent  and don't need a nigga that I have  to pay her bills or a doctor fee
That's the type of woman I like to wive
A booshie broad but still like to fight
She  so fine when she on  Instagram every picture she posts  I try to like it twice
Never need a ride or  try to stay with me
She got a own crib and a own car
A pack with bag with a sack of cash
Two credit cards and a lone star
Being VIP with a own bottles
Til I pour a glass  of  that purple
It's Doughbeezy bitch and when they play this song
I'm like  throw that ass in the circle , nigga
Want a man and  she  got a man I guarantee she will leave the nigga
Be classy but it get nasty type she'll fuck you first and then feed you nigga
She smoke weed and got a own bag
So don't need a manto  come roll up
And what's understood ain't  gotta be explained
They all understand when she show up
She on top

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a bad bitch your bitch bad built
Got bad credit and bad breath
Mind on the grind
While your ho standing in the unemployment line tryna cash checks
A predict scale is a epic fail like a fat chick dancing on a glass desk
The only thing she good for is gimme brain like a nigga tryna study for a math test
I go to dreams for some chicken wings and some fried shrimp word to Lex P
The next week I was MV live getting head from a chick while I checked tweet
I called Big () tell them line them up I'm tryna go home with the best three
And they don't ride the dick like a surfboard they in the tub tryna ride like a jetski
I'm a thug like Slim and boss no hogg
I'm a dog but I ain't rocking neckleash
And if she got a man and he wanna trip
Then he ain't getting checked like a chest piece
See how the boppers be hatin the way she poppin' the pussy like bacon
And getting the cake while the bitches be caking
She shaking and throwing it back like she Payton
She on top

Blue Magic...
Let me roll up my window, as the indo get me blowed like a Nintendo
I'm cruising but I got my brim low tryna watch for Carl Winslow
FUCK the police that's a 10-4
So I turn and hit the signal
Just so I don't give these laws no reason to ask me for my info
Boys can't stop nor slow my tempo, highway light shining off the window
Just swung on two white sluts with two white cups po'd up for Big Moe
It's Doughbeezy bitch you didn't know, better run and tell yo' kinfolk
That I came to fuck the game I shoulda named this project nympho
It's yo' favorite rapper's rapper to hate on
Because I probably showed up to his party late, but then ain't stay long
I just tell these boys to stay strong cause I don't expect this niggas to understand
That I got plans of tryna turn these dollars into a hundred grand
Fuck what they talking 'bout, I love my city but really I'm tryna make it out
Get cake and bounce and turn my partners rubberbands to bank accounts
No mo' grams of white just stages and bright camera lights
And after shows all of these thirsty hoes treat me like a can of Sprite
I'm the man that you can't stand to like but aye I planned it right
I'm finally gettin shine and now these bitch niggas can't stand the light
My friend was right they can't stop a nigga with true talent
So I guess it's time to let these fools have it...
This is Blue Magic, where the music addicts pick up they new habits
Every verse I wrote so dope you can sell my tablet if you bag it
If you want it you can have it, but be careful of what yo ask fo'
Cause when you tryna be the shit you can end up looking like an asshole
I'm just cruising down on mash mode, tryna be the next new Astro... yea
A star in Houston about to sneak right out the backdoor
And show niggas that I'm back mo' focused serving an eviction notice
Cause that nigga mixtape you thought went hard can't even fuck with my show disc... ah!
I done seen a lot of ho shit, but it can't stop what God got planned fa me
I... see it in niggas eyes my buzz is sumthin they can't stand to see
All I got is family, faith, and my niggas that'll let you have it
Want respect you never gone get it unless you grab it...
Blue Magic[Verse 1]
Look my car too clean for me to ride a feet or roll
So imma pay the cost if I see the toes
You seeing me broke you gotta better chance tryin' to see a troll
Bring back so many cheese that my pockets gon look like a pzza roll
Your ho's average my ho is the baddest
I treat these hoes like dominoes
I got two cups and I'm leanin
My cup thick and my bitches too


While I'm in my '96  impala all blue
Like Screw did it no cd player Just great taste in my deck
Don't fuck with new niggas
Got two triggers, no 2 Chainz
My crew bang like gang membersNuffCed intro
