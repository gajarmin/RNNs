Let freedom ring with a buckshot, but not just yet
First, we need to truly understand the nature of the threat
And a pale man walks in the threshold of darkness
Roughly 20,000 years ago the first humans evolved
With the phenotypical trait, genetic recessive
Blue eyes, blonde hair and white skin
Albinism apparently was a sin to the original man, Africans
So the mutants traveled North of the equator
Called Europeans later, the first race haters
So here's the Devil's alpha to the beta
Cause history's best qualified to teach one
Quoting German philosopher Schopenhauer
"Every white man is a faded or a bleached one"
Migration created further mutation
Genetic drifts, evolution through recombination
Adaptation to the climate
As the Caucus mountain man reverted to that of a primate
Savage Neanderthals, until the late Paleolithic age
That's when the Black Grimaldi man came
With the symbol of the dragon, fire and art
Check cave paintings in France and Spain to the Venus of Willendorf
Around 2000 B.C. Southern Russians migrate in small units
Those who travel West populated Europe
Those who went East settled in Iran, known as Aryans
1500 B.C. some crossed the Khyber Pass into India and
Created Hinduism, the first caste system, the origins of racism
A white dot on the forehead meant elite
The black dot - defeat; untrustable, untouchables
They wrote the holy Vedas in Sanskrit
That's the language that created Greek, German, Latin and English
Now the Minoans around 2000 B.C
Starts on the island of Crete, in the Agean Sea
The Greek culture begins Western Civilization
But "Western Civilization" means "white domination"
Mycenaeans learned from Kemet, called Egypt in Greek
It existed since at least 3000 B.C
Creatin' geometry and astronomy
This knowledge influenced Plato, Socrates and Hippocrates
Cause Imhotep, the real real father of medicine
Was worshiped in Greece and Rome in the form of a Black African
The word Africa comes from the Greek "Aphrike"
Meaning "without cold"; the word philosophy means "love of knowledge"
Stole from first man, Greek power expands
The first Greek fraternities band
The word gymnasium is Greek for "naked"
This was the place where adolescent boys were educated, and molested
This was accepted because Greek culture was homosexual
For example, Sappho trained girls on the island of Lesbos;
Hence, the word word Lesbian. [Ey, let these dumb motherfuckers know!]
December 25th, the birth of Saturn
A homosexual god, now check the historical pattern
December 25th, now thought the birth of Christ
Was Saturnalia, when men got drunk
Fucked each other then beat their wife
Fact is, it was still practiced, 'til they called it Christmas
So put a gerbil on your Christmas list
The Hellenistic Era, Alexander the Great
Conquers all the way to India leavin' four successor states
By the Fifth century B.C., R.O.M.E
Succeeds to be the conqueror of Egypt and Greece
But had the threat of the Black Phoenicians in Sicily
The Punic Wars began 264 B.C
The Black general Hannibal and Carthaginian Peace
In 146 B.C. Carthage fell after a six-month siege
Rome sold every citizen to slavery
The first genocide of history
And more bisexuality in sight; Julius Caesar was known as
"every woman's husband and every man's wife"
Spartacus Revolt, a slave rebellion that lost
Where 6,000 slaves was nailed on a cross
Cross, aw, shit, Jesus Christ, Time for some act-right
Christians get your facts right
Cause Christ was not his name
That's Greek for "One who is anointed"
Yeshua Ben Yosef was his name, do Christians know this?
So who do you praise, do you know his name
Or do you do this in vain
Accepting the religion they gave slaves to behave
Peep the description of historian Josephus
"Short, dark, with an underdeveloped beard was Jesus"
He had the Romans fearin' revolution
The solution was to take him to court and falsely accuse him
After being murdered by Pilate how can it be
These same white Romans established Christianity
Constantine would later see the cross in a dream
In his vision, it read *In hoc signo vinces*
"In this sign we conquer" - Manifest Destiny
In 325 he convened the Nicene Creed and separated god into three
Decided Jesus was born on December 25th
And raised then on the third day is a myth
Plus to deceive us
Commissioned Michelangelo to paint white pictures of Jesus
He used his aunt, uncle, and nephew
Subconsciously that affects you
It makes you put white people closer to God
True indeed, fuck it, Jihad
In the eight century Muslims conquered
Spain, Portugal and France and controlled it for 700 years
They never mention this in history class
Cause o'fays are threatened when you get the real lesson
Moors from Baghdad, Turkey threatened European Christians
Meaning, the white way of life; hence the Crusades for Christ
On November 25th, 1491
Santiago defeats the last Muslim stronghold, Granada
King Ferdinand gave thanks to God for victory
And the Pope of Rome and declared this date to forever be
A day of "Thanksgiving" for all European Christians

Now listen, when you celebrate "Thanksgiving"
What you are actually celebratin'
Is the proclamation of the Pope of Rome
Who later, in league with Queen Isabella
Sent Cardinal Ximenos to Spain
To murder any blacks that resisted Christianity
These Moors, these black men and women were from Baghdad, Turkey
And today, you eat the turkey, for your "Thanksgiving" day
As the European powers destroyed the Turkeys
Who were the forefathers of your mothers and fathers
Now fight the power, you bitch-ass niggas

Now around this time, Whites started callin' us Negroes
That's Spanish for black object meaning we're not really people
But property, and the triangle trade begins - they seize us
Queen Elizabeth sends the first slaves on a ship named Jesus
Stealin' land from the indigenous natives
Gave them alcohol to keep the Red Man intoxicated
Whites claim they had to civilize these pagan animals
But up until 1848 there's documented cases
Of whites bein the savage cannibals, eatin' Indians
In 1992, it's Jeffery Dahmer
They slaughtered a whole race with guns
Drugs, priests and nuns
1763, the first demonic tactic of biological warfare
As tokens of peace, Sir Jeffery Amherst
Passed out clothing and blankets to the Indian community
Infested with small pox, knowing they had no immunity
Today it's AIDS, you best believe it's man made
Cause ain't a damn thing changed, let me explain
Now since people of color are genetically dominant
And Caucasoids are genetically recessive
And Whites expect to be predominant, meaning survive as a race then
They simply must, take precautions
That's why they're worried about their future now
Cause by 2050, almost all the Earth's population
Will be brown, then black, so understandin' that, whites counter-react
So they created a system
To force blacks into an unnatural position
That re-enforces the position of natural inferiority
In addition, created guns and developed the ethnocentric view
That God justifies every fuckin' thing they do
Condition people to perceive whites' culture as civilized
And every other culture considered primitive - not true
Racism is the system of racial subjugation against non-whites
In every areas of human relation
Entertainment, education, labor, politics
Law, religion, sex, war and economics
See blacks were 3/5ths of a man with tax purposes intended
You think you're Afro-American? You're a 14th amendment and a good nigga
Jews don't salute the fuckin' swastika
But niggas pledge allegiance to the flag that accosted ya
They never teach about the break of islands like Jamaica
But before slaves came here Whites would take a
Pregnant women, hang her from a tree by her toes
Slice her stomach with a knife
And let the unborn baby fall to the flo'
And stop an unborn child in front of all the slaves
To inbreed fear, so they'd be scared and behave
And not rebel more
Understand all Whites must be perceived as potential predators
I paraphrase historian Ishakamusa Barashango
"Understand that regardless of the lofty ideas engraved on paper
In such documents as the Constitution or Declaration
The basic nature of the European American white man
Remains virtually unchanged", so check
This is the nature of the threat[Intro: Sample]
And with the help, the help of almighty God
I know I can be strong

[Intro: Ras Kass]
Yeah, this is how to kill God
Yeah, this is how to kill God
Holocaust, Crusades, Zionism, Jihad

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
They call me iconoclastic
My head on the platter like John the Baptist
Blasphemous, heretic, Conceited Bastard
I just ask the questions the preacher can't answer
Like why Christians end prayers and say "Amen"
When that's the Egyptian Sun God, Amun-Ra
And got a sin to say? And ain't that pagan?
And ain't pagan, meanin' "Satan"?
And if Satan gave mankind liberation
His worship of acknowledge would tip all Revelations
Of free masons, this how to kill God
Holocaust, Crusades, Zionism, Jihad
Ras Kass, God body MC
18th letter, Jay Hova, God's son and me
My freestyles ain't free
Impossible like one divinity divided into three
Same people that rape and beat ya teach ya
Rabbits lay chocolate eggs on Easter
Mormons believe prophet Joe Smith
Say Christ appeared in America 1820 and shit
Said black people is cursed
Preach polygamy and told the white man to rule the Earth
Utah still racist as can be
So mothafuck Donny and Marie

[Hook: Sample]
To make me stand alone
And with the help, the help of almighty God
I know, I know I can be strong

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Give 'em religion with no proof
Crucify the facts, I doubt your truth
This is how to kill God
Get 10 commandments, break all 10 laws
Exodus, chapter 20, verse 3
Thou shalt have no other gods before me
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image
But worship a white man on the cross, put your faith in it?
I'm not anti-Christ
Not anti-Islamic, anti-Semite
Never
Razzy be like Neo in The Matrix
They made us slaves and changed our names
Now it's our lineage they tryin' to claim
But I am the same
Direct descendant of King David through the passion of Christ
Cause Mary Magdalene was really Jesus' wife
Original Hebrew, black Falasha Jew
Persecuted by the Romans, the chosen few
Illuminati stole it from the Egyptian mystery school
Started flippin' our tools
And perverted our math
Master masons learned who God is, given 'em gats
Addict 'em to crack
Poverty, miseducation
Plague, oh Lord, this is how to kill God

[Hook: Sample]

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
Black skin, baby Moses was found in a boat
In a river by the pharaoh's daughter, must have been a black man
She raised him as her own son
How a black woman pass off a white child as her own one?
You search, it's all true, that's why I'm a cynic
Why should I believe in your God, He's schizophrenic
Three personalities, give ya incest
Son his own father, never had sex with his mama
Catch Holy Ghost, CIA killed God
Center of every pentagram? It's a pentagon
Lost angel city, peep the plan
Tryna scan human beings like grocery cans
666 microchips in your hand
Navigation, your whip started the program
But Uncle Tom Bradley chipped our pets
Same satellites that track you with GPS
Did cats and dogs in the 1980s
Probably on the low, chippin' newborn babies
Niggas call me crazy? Crazy is spectators
Since my soul's at stake, I'ma collect data
If I'm goin' to Hell, you express elevator
Christmas, you celebrate a pagan holiday
Mithra, Adonis, Dionysus, Osiris
Same birthday, who rose on the third day

[Hook: Sample]

[Outro]
Yeah, this is how to kill God
Holocaust, Crusades, Zionism, Jihad
Yeah, this is how to kill God
Racism, sexism, every ism is a schism[Intro]
Just look at us, everything is backwards. Everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health. Lawyers destroy justice. Universities destroy knowledge. Governments destroy freedom. The major media destroys information and religions destroy spirituality. That's where we are!

[Sample]
"As you look...up to the sky
Oh God"

[Ras talking]
Uh. What niggas be saying? Church. Hahaha. You're gonna "church" your ass all the way to Hell nigga. Deliver us from evil. Amen!

[Verse One]
All I want for Christmas is a big booty whore
A Maybach coupe and a Playstation 4
Praise the Lord
I'm playing the Temptations
Motown, Apollo Brown a D conversation
Not a nomination, not a mason, not Obamanation
Not Osama/Satan, not healthcare.gov
I don't got a lot of patience, my inauguration out of hibernation
I'm sovereign, Moorish, a one man nation
"Oh God"
So many bitches I should share 'em
But homie you a bender, the eunuch in a harem
King Solomon's Mine's, Father Time
Yet you would turn water to wine
So I'm drunk enough to turn your average daughter to dimer
Beverly Hills messiah, plastic surgeon's, Delilah
New tits, bad witch just to trick Samson
In the barber chair but still strong, where's my handgun?

[Hook]
Every second precious 'fore the Terminator's catch us
Plug us in the Matrix, turn our brains in to ketchup
The Matrix called "the cloud", Terminator's is the drones
Humans are genetically modified clones
"God"
Deliver us from evil
Deliver us from evil
"God"
Deliver us from evil
Deliver us from evil
"Oh God"

[Verse Two]
The British throne really German
Family named the Battenbergs
'Bout as royal as Duck Dynasty in Johannesburg
They ask me if I'm Muslim cause I don't eat swine
Nah, let's call it kosher, my original culture
Cried what Hitler did to Jews by the Rhine
But two wrongs don't make it right when you occupy Palestine
And white Christians, mission assisting the end times
Gon' flip they wigs when Jesus the cast of Good Times
Black skin, big lips, hair full of dreads
Prolly got his music bumping, why He can't hear our prayers
'Pac wondered If Heaven Got A Ghetto
Marlon Brandon tweeted me, "Heaven is Soweto"
A lot of poor east Asians, niggas and Latinos
Heaven is Highland Park in Puerto Rico
And if you ain't our color brother, I should let you know
There's another place down below, where you can go

[Hook]

[Outro: Ras Kass]
Let us pray. Our father who art in Heaven. Hollowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come. They will be done on Earth As It Is In Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil[Sample]
Memories, like the corners of my mind
Misty watered colored memories
Of the way...

[Intro]
The good old days
Reflect with me
You know what I'm sayin'
We just sittin' on the porch
In Watts
Helicopter flyin' overhead
Lil niggas in the street throwin' dirt rocks
Feel me


[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Archaeological logic, discovered Van Gogh's fossils
To paint a perfect picture
Twelve years a slave, twenty years a spitter
Thirty seven years a nigga
Hopin' to see ninety bein' a strong black figure
As I stand and deliver
Breathe fire in Japan, Godzilla
By popular demand till the fans see that God got iller
I'm like Cornel West with scales on my chest
You superman thugs, caught Kryptonite to the flesh
See the hood got me stressed, takin fists to the neck
Multiple arrest then I discovered KRS
Let us begin, what, where, how or why
Will all be explained and if not, fam we die
Losin' granny was the hardest
Good women I fucked and left broken hearted
Turned up being retarded
Transformation to activist from an artist
Like young Mellala who the Taliban would target
Shot in the head just cause she wanted to read
Till every person sex trafficed is free, we gotta bleed
(Turned down for what?)
Cause niggas tell on themselves nowadays
Film it on Vine then wonder why crime don't pay
Candid outlandish, the dirty pistol I brandishe
Glad they didn't have camera phones when I was young doin' bad shit
Yeah, I just dated myself
I'm no spring chicken but why you hate on yourself?
For five minutes of fame
Find yourself like Kat Stacks, knocked out the frame
Locked in a cage
And ? it's true, you backwards hustlin' homie, you snitchin' on you
I'm on my Descartes, Diop, Be-Bop, Aristotle
Prehistoric talons twist the top off the bottle
My era is classic Tyrannosaurus Rex in the lab shit
Leimert Park so I pass it Jurassic

[Hook: Rakaa Iriscience]
I can think back but life goes on so keep livin'
Can't take a thing back but life goes on so keep livin'
There are couple things, that maybe I would if I could
Forgive myself for, I'm unforgiving
Yeah, I throw this drink back but life goes on so keep livin'

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
In order to recollect exceptional memories
I developed a way to transform brainwaves into binary code from energy
Translate algorithms, converted the information to digital
Uploaded compiled files of wisdom
Then projected them on a screen, vivid beautiful scenes
Extract orchestrated symphonies and heavenly dreams
The alchemist
In kindergarten when kids was asking about alphabets
I was immaculate with astronomy, mastering calculus
Seized from my parents during a scene when I was seven
They experimented on my brain up until I was age eleven
And at age thirteen I learned to literally stream
Molecules and teleport molecular structures with the beam
These are my memories, soak them in with a notion
To fast forward the bad and play the good in slow motion
Now I astral project
Analyze Guam
Study Agent Orange bring back secrets from 'Nam
The government asked me to track the locals on Islam
They asked me the whereabouts of Boko Haram
And cracked my brain for catastrophic chatter that's insane
To extract data from satellites on missin' Malaysian planes
My memories, my memories, my memories
Although from only just a week ago
My memories, my memories, my memories

[Hook][Verse 1: Chino XLs]
You prayed for me and I came, how far you niggas wanna push me?
I'm leaving the crowds happy like OJ Simpson when he got his first white pussy
But I'm still annoyed, blow through your solenoid
Bringing more Blues to Brothers than Jon Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
Governmently engineered like Ebola for this rap garage sale
By this industry, I'm trying not to get fucked like 2Pac in jail
You can hate me, but await me like I'm Magic Johnson's death
In a box with Jordan's pops that ass'll never take another breath
Cause, I write the songs like Barry Manilow
I like my sugar brown like Hugh Grant, fuck D'Angelo

[Ras Kass]
Now I got niggas claiming they saw God unfortunately
He wasn't in the person of Master Farad Muhammad
Some often ask how can this nigga molest the English alphabet
In one hundred words or less it ain't the chronic
It's all in the mind like Johnny Mnemonic
Before my word is born, surgeons administer antibiotics
To drain the phonics, amniotic fluids
Delivery, to get Nia deep in your Peeples like Howard Hewett
Half-Hitler, half-Jewish, I'm gassed off myself, nigga

[Chino XL]
Iconoclismic, twisted without the use of fiber optics
Knocked his eyeballs out the sockets I got your Adam's Apples in my pockets
Blow shit like Timmy McVeigh, like kiddie porn I'm getting popular

[Ras Kass]
Popular, no ocular, MCs perp particular, but not quite yet perpendicular
Compound fractures fibulas when niggas step, contest the upper torso
I got Chino's back like a dorsal fin
Comprehend, we bend men from within

[Hook: Chino XL and Ras Kass]
Your strength in numbers couldn't hit
The yellow nigga from the Gravity click
You don't give a fuck as long as bud gets lit
You're fucking with the homicidal lunatics
Like licorice, niggas begin to twist
Lay back and watch your idols get ripped
Yo signify if your crew roll thick
Yeah, East Coast, West Coast, beeeotch

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
I circumnavigate the globe with a one-liner like, latitude
Put my rhymes in mixed fortune cookies to leave Confucius confused
The day a nigga serve Ras is when faggots start straight bashing

[Chino XL]
Without Jermaine Dupri I'm so so def that I need closed captions
Won't see me stressed from no East/West conflict
The interest Chino X/Ras Kass like Lance Ito removed you from your bench
My retina expands, my brain is trapped like a rat on a running wheel
Praise the yellow God or I'ma leave you scarred like that nigga Seal
Vernacular understandable, you in a hearse, megahertz, the truth hurts
Slang botanical, you're moving on time-lapse camera
Indestructible, dig me like an excavation multiracial valuable
Take you out like Saafir took out Casual

[Ras Kass]
So check the milk that Jersey made, I turn Autistic children bilingual
On parallel bars I create new dismounts like Chechincko

[Chino XL]
So keep it short and sweet like Sherman Hemsley bonafide queer
While I shoot shit up you're shooting gerbils up your asshole like Richard Gere

[Ras Kass]
Bitch ass niggas what see I gives a fuck who's certified platinum or gold
Cause I got rhymes for every unit you sold
Your plaques corrode when I collage colloquials
At first the buzz was local but now the nose grows like Pinocchio
No lie, no T-H-C, T-H-E, T-H-O-U-G-H-T makes me high in intelligence quotient
I drop fax like Hitachi, exfoliate rap and come cleaner than Jeru's enema
What's the secret within my esophagus is discovered like Tutankhamen's sarcophagus
I got niggas looking for Webster's like George Papadopolous

[Chino XL]
Yo Ras pardon me my unfamiliar soliloquies, similes
Similar to Reginald Denny's, facial injuries
You couldn't locate my transient thoughts with lo-jack
Molest your mind like Oprah Winfrey's behind when she was a small child
Punchlines with more elasticity than Biggie's stretch marks
Chino X sparks, mad urban
I ain't scared to put the things that going around me on tape like Mark Fuhrman
Sexing picture perfect hoes like Pocahontas often
And I'd rather hear Willie Nelson than fucking Montell Jordan

[Hook]

[Outro: Chino]
Uhh, yeah
Uhh, signify, uhh
Uhh, check it out, uhh
West coast, uhh, East coast, what
West coast, East coast
West, uhh, East, ahh
Uhh, that nigga Ras, that nigga Chino
The nigga Bird, yo that shit is large[Verse 1: Evidence]
I set it off in the sunny distance, no days existed
My patience led the way 'til the greatest love listened to me
I used to play the witness, wait in the trenches
It's like the sixth man, sits on different benches
It's hard squeezing life in a sentence
And if I do, roll carpet with the red tint
My entrance is what's between
When I exit, it's Evidence left on the scene
Alchemist cut the record down, to the bone
And with a record like this I take the world by storm
It's God blessed, the land of the brave
Understand where I stand, my hand is made
From B-R-double-O-K-lyn the planet
Family landed, managed to raise the man that I became
Panic on my first campaign
But when the words fell in place, I was certain to reign
I hit the purple then step in the circle and start flexin'
Weatherman invented, now storms change directions
Portions of my proceeds is feeding my homies now
I always shared pretty good for an only child
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong
Now the role's reversed, I'm putting people on
They off welfare and got healthcare
They used to have their priorities elsewhere
I took rims and tires and traded them
For a ticket to an island, that's where I wrote this rhyme in
Where I first saw my vision written
Driven by a better living, a place to raise kids in
So I think like I rule the world, on the brink of something bigger
Building schools for boys and girls
The thought alone gets me out of my bed
I said you got the tools, get them shits up out of the shed, c'mon

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I'm like the interstate of rhymin', the Jack Dempsey emcee
All my shit customed out, hold the fort eventually
Money is made, fly blades
A woman with brains, it help a black nigga reign
My lifestyle as a prowler; a rich loaner, owner
Used to pump at coffee shops, had my bitch Roselle with me rolling up
Fly ass and still classy, asking questions like
Why you wait on that glass, why would you splash me
Yo, it's only nigga shit
I'ma teach you like I was taught to
Hold the fort, walk through
Seeing all kind of grey fossils
Colossal jewels, bigger house, act fly, I got you
No need to walk backwards, fuck up the taxes
My street credibility is stronger than NASA's yeah
Yo a diplomatic winner, Nike boots
A skully good denim jean on, and one-rent em

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Rass Kass]
They say you only live once, I disagree
You only live twice, your life and then through your seed's
So I bleed on wax and feed them the deed
So when I die they got the foundation on my publishing B
Plus the words that I speak, here's my family jewels
It ain't all blood diamonds, but life experience tools
And I be rhyming cool but my philosophy's deep
Like a Dear John letter, so read em and weep
And the wolves smell blood, you can feed em the meat
But I’m a lycan, Underworld we can meet in the street
Draw heat, but what happened to peace
He got a Dirty Sanchez, like what happened to Screech
Jesus, diarrheas, I mean holy shit
Christ on a cracker, that's just how we spit
Communion, add the wine, make the sign of the cross
And I don't live in the past, chalk it up as a loss
Went from, please listen to my demo to stretch limo
To the pen in a cell watching Eminem on Jimmy Kimmel
But I can't go out like Kimbo Slice
Like Gina Corano, I'm a Cyborg we terminate
Mano a mano, still Ronald McDonald, over one billion served
But it's up to me to get what I deserve
So I handle my biz and hustle harder than the norm
The early bird gets the worm, but the hawk gets the bird[Ras Kass]
You want to talk to God? God never sleeps

[Hook]
Ras Kass: Now what came first, the chicken or the egg?
God: Armageddon
Ras Kass: A arm a leg a leg a arm a head
Heading in your direction
The riddle was the answer to the question
Born of the flesh, what is perfection

[Ras Kass]
Inside my mother's womb, doomed to return to the tomb
Or was it from the dead I was raised?
All too soon to pay, on judgment day
Is this beginning or the ending?
Died sinning, still winning, still grinning
This ending, verdict still pending, born pretending
Three-hundred billion men, women, and children [cringing]
Deja vu, could be I'm dreaming
But we all ask for divine reason
While still breathing, and until leaving
Who?, What?, When? Where?, How?
But most of all why?

[God]
Why what?

[Ras Kass]
Do we live just to die?

[God]
The Book was written
Way before the apple got bitten
There is no God but me, mathematically, in division
My decision was all inventions
I need not mention infinite dimensions
But the human mind's flaw was limited comprehension
So while you try to travel to Mars and the stars
The God manifests through the entire universe
From the Sun, Moon, the Earth
I created man in my image and the black man was first
For scientific explanation, yeah I made man out of dirt

[Ras Kass]
But how can a man be first, when its the woman that's giving birth?

[God]
Listen, single-celled organisms
To homo-sapien, to Albinism

[Ras Kass]
What's that?

[God]
White people

[Ras Kass]
They keep the world separate and unequal

[God]
They teach you, right is wrong, wrong is right
Up is down
Took the King off his throne, is the planet flat or round?

[Ras Kass]
Can we really time travel, and is there life in outer space?

[God]
Wait, you knew all this in the first place
You trying to get to God

[Ras Kass]
But, I've fallen from your grace
A billion paths to take, but which one is truly straight?

[Hook]

[Ras Kass]
Can you walk across water or rise from the dead?
I heard he said he lived, and the son of man bled

[God]
It's a process, shit dont just happen, I create it
Everything you see, and shit you dont, son I made it, and waited
I'm the big bang theory and evolution
Been there, done that, from revolution to prostitution
The first and final solution
The quran, bible, and vedas, is only tools
Don't be confused when the medulla oblongata duels

[Ras Kass]
Oh, so revelations is Genesis

[God]
Three-sixty degrees of limitless

[Satan]
Shit, I'm my own fuckin' nemesis

[Ras Kass]
Who is you?

[Satan]
Son, I thought you knew
Who else? Lucifer, the light bearer stupid, the devil himself
He the creator, we all the creations, guess I'm eternal damnation
Got you bitches seeking your own salvation
Who taught you how to pray?
Cuz you read it in the book? look, your bear witness to Amen Ray
Every day when you say Amen, and then turn around
And preach worshipping false Gods, is an unforgivable sin
Yea the good book is like comic books, you take 'em too literal
I tricked you in to believing the power to reason
Makes you able to live infinitely, in the physical
Guess I'm the pro&con miracle
Basically I tell true lies in general, the yin and the yang
The player with a trillion years of game

[God]
He got you selling your spiritual, for power, money, and fame
I came out of triple stage darkness, gave mortals my attributes
But even you make me a mystery God like the lochness
A use science to prove or disprove my existence
Trying to unlock This, artificial intelligence, cloning and space stations
Trying to build the tower of babylon
But you sadly mistaken, when I start erasing homosapiens
You looking for angels with wings?!
I'm 'a bring young niggas with a ak, fuck a alien

[Ras Kass]
So what you saying then? You the one that created sin!

[God]
What you call mother nature, is the nature of me
What you call evil, ultimately, was the force inside of me
Matter can't be created or destroyed it just changes shape
One God, many people, and many faiths
And this is how I wanted it done

[Ras Kass]
Wait, wait, hold up
Father tell me, who is God's son?

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[God]
I be the Jesus to your Buddha, the Krishna at your Jumah
The big kahuna, Jehovahs Witness in suede pumas
Zeus, Pharaoh, Elohim, Saturn, Yahweh, Jah
Rastafari, Allah, The Most High
But then, only that, I'm not...
I'm the oceans, the trees, a bumble bee, and a Glock
Earthquakes, to how much money you'll ever take
The reason behind every mistake mankind continually makes

[Ras Kass]
Did God create man, or did man need to create God?

[Satan]
The answer is both, cause how mortals look at God is odd

[God]
You try to customize me to be comfortable
For what you want to do, and how you choose to act
The Pope and Christians will tell you God ain't black
But to get something from nothing is physically impossible, thats a fact

[Satan]
Black is the combination of all colors

[Ras Kass]
White is the lack thereof

[God]
Darkness is beneath the ground, and in the skies up above
The clue, is that the true illumination is me, not Illuminati
Cause I alone discriminate & eliminate
Any who be believing they can rationalize our out-reason He
Who created your creature, the student can never be greater than the teacher
Whether its Adam and Eve, or atomic chemistry
I'm the one true source of all energy
Who will eventually destroy every enemy when I see fit
I can't blaspheme my own name so when God damn it, so be it

[Satan]
Thats called the wrath of God, but we gotta deal, I can chill
Fuck up the whole world, and in the end
He'll still fulfill his plan, to return man to his original position
Nigga gave me some hooks, and said I gets to go fishin'

[God]
I gave man dominion over the Earth, to master the wealth
But most of my children don't have dominion over theyself

[Satan]
That's where I come in
Call it original sin
But, who really gives a flying fuck?
I taught you how to blood suck, and ultimately self destruct

[God]
Know the ledge, wise the dome, do the data
I'm the alpha

[Satan]
I'm the beta

[Ras Kass]
And I'm omega
To be or not to be was man's question since conception
I think therefore I am, was man's perception
But the birth is the resurrection
The son of God, or God's son, that lights our entire spectrum
You got everlasting life, long as you got day and night
Illumination, not education, to bring the blind sight
And what you need to know is that you'll never know it all
I'm a lowercase g, son of the ever-living God[Produced by Frank Dukes]

[Sample]:
"I don't know what I'm gonna do."

[Ras Kass]:
Huh. I do. Get low. Ha

Bar none, when I spit a bar, I spit a bar
Hennessy, Hypnotic, Patron
Courvoisier, Grey Goose
I grill niggas, spit a barbecue
Committing drive-bys out a grey Coupe
When I start drowning rappers, dawg, it ain't cute
Till every person in they group turn blue like they Snoop
Watch face blue, but I'm grimey duke
I like most of y'all niggas better in your shiney suits
At the hood, after hours, when I'm on the loose
Cause I hang with troops like Sadaam on a noose
So fuck what y'all trying to pass off as the truth
I done jumped from the earth and touched the Universe's roof
Crash landed back on planet like meteor
Dust off my white tee and lift Lamborghini doors
I keep me a meaty whore
Trini in bikini, apple martini whore
Y'all niggas is CB4
My niggas in CDC
Bounty hunter ECG
Dipping Newports into PCP
Give a mic to me is UFC on Spike TV
Niggas talk gangsta shit but he ain't one
Till he see that gun and realize nobody really love you
Like New York on VH1
I'm the ghetto experiment
Pop in at any son
Me and the project, project, projecting objects at anyone
Blackjack bitches, that's 21
Dare any nigga to be a dollar and see
You want the king of the west then holler at me

[Joell Ortiz]:
Who's been eating? I haven't daddy
Just been the booth's Houdini, working my magic scrappy
Industry jabbing at me
I'm just trying to keep my marriage happy
But the politics and the games driving me crazy like an Arab cabbie
Still I never quit
Def Jam's president, from up the block, around the corner
Down the street, where I'm selling it
Who said, "Joell is sick"?
Man I'm on the deathbed
I wrote this on the bedspread, with IV in my wrist
I am him
The product of a moms who got high and a father who ain't say "bye" to them
His family that is
Know that y'all can never break me
Look in my eyes, listen up guys...don't make me
Only a rookie in the game's eyes
Been doing this since I was yeeh high
It's alright to be shook
I will turn your first album into a library book
C'mon let's skim through the pages in my diary, look
18 I rock those stretchers
19 I dropped a 12 inch
Rawkus Records, that's when I hooked up with G Rap
It's nothing, bang
Y'all heard the streets feedback
At 25 I'm the outcome of everything between that

[Sha Stimuli]:
Y'all know I'm everything y'all want to be
I do the shit you never do
I feel it when you look at me
I'd kill myself if I was you
You
See, but luckily I'm not
I used to run in labels like, "You should fuck with me I'm hot."
By now I could have sold some mills and showed that I was so for real
While your roster fucked around like Lauren Hill's
Let me stop, I ain't hating on nobody
It's like the whole world is waiting on somebody
They say that I'm the obvious replacement
I just say this shit's a hobby
Lot of new rappers waiting in the lobby
But I'm coming up
Me and Joell, do it so well
Niggas either want to throw shells or ride on our coattails
Oh well
Go tell someone I'm coming
I'm sonning niggas without touching they mother
There's no one above me
I told y'all that I was a problem
Rappers started studying me like they could solve it
Listen close
I got a 9 times 5
I pop 3 times 2
Add drama, take away your respect and divide you
In half, for your math I do this til I'm through
Living life, breathing breath, I bring death to your whole crew
I don't know if there's a better MC
Some people get better with time, I say the time's getting better with me
I got, I got my rhymes tight, the streets gave Sha light
Now you see me holding C-Notes like the Chi-Lites
It's The Present motherfucker

[Grafh]:
I got unhappy soldiers, esse that clappy clappy toaster
That turn you brains into nasty tapioca
Ewwww
Then I hop back on over
To drop autograph while I'm autographing a poster
I'm in the cut like
Change stashed in a sofa
I'm Hennessy straight, you a pretty ass glass of mimosa
You a bum, I caught you trying to go half on a soda
You make the change, I use the stash in my loafer
So it don't matter what I pack in a holster
Cause I slash you till I scratch the plaque off the back of your molar
It'll cut through the back of a boulder
Owwww
Got a pack full of soldiers with a bag of explosives
And they clapping them toasters that can detach your back from your shoulders
After I blow your little daughter out the back of her stroller
And the ricochet will blow her back in the stroller
Cause that gat caliber has the motor out the back of a roaster
Vrrrom
Get drunk and try to spaz you joker
Till I punch you in your face and move your back tooth over
I'll knock 'em down your throat
You gag, you choke up
Then I bet by the time your lungs collapse, you sober
Breathe easy
Back don't ya
I'm a crack donor
So my tax write off is a crack smoker
Aaaayyyyye
I ain't battling no one so don't bring a challenger over
If I wanted a challenger I'd battle my poster

[Gab Gotcha]:
I ain't never met a thug that my slugs ain't like
I never met one who lived or walked straight, when they all hit right
Head or the back you parents are attending a mass
Centered around that box wood, lacquered in black
With you you laying stiff in the cushion
While I'm pushing a 'Lac, past the church while your family's looking
Over your face, me driving over the bridge
With coke in a space sealed by placing a switch
If life is a bitch then she fuck me nice
Boxed up for seven joints now she pregnant, bout to birth me yikes
My first born at least, VS1
My seed cultivating, that love grow out of weed and concealed guns
Triple beam lust
Finger fucking them grams that make twins out of one in my hand
My connected weight set me apart
The potential to flood it like when Noah finished building the Ark
Colombian
Moving coke is an art
If Michelangelo was Pablo, Gab Gotcha gotta be Picasso
I rock flows and crush rocks for your nostrils
Clutch Glocks that pop when that blow make you hostile
Parce, cojalo suave, or I unload a clip
And siamese twin your head and the lobby
Silicone tips makes vests sizzle
Implants in your chest like fake tits, holes size of your nipples
Nigga

Gab Gotcha. Crown City nigga[Ras Kass]
What, yeah, yeah
Black John McClane, Harold the Menace, and the Waterproof
With my nigga Bud'da, on the track
Golden State Warriors..
Eatin every rapper on the plate
Huh, feel me

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
I got three-oh-fo's in three-one-oh
On section eight, with multiple one-eighty-sevens
Sport a Marilyn Manson t-shirt when I die and go to heaven
Smoke a beady, scrape my lungs, smoke the resin
Remember the name Ras Kass-ciano
Get to clownin y'all punk bitches, cause I'm a Mac, like Ronald
I make Mac make money, and mack murder wack rappers
My Makaveli verse Bomb First, the Mac-11'll gat cha
When I get at cha, the situation tenses
Fatality (Toasty!) before you ever reach your senses
Got so-called riders, crashing into brick fences
Like my name was Al Fayed so you die, like that white princess
If you lookin for sympathy, you better look
Between R and T, in the fucking dictionary
See the object of the game is to win, stack some ends, sippin Henn'
Whip a Benz and leave it to your next of kin

Chorus: repeat 2X

[RK] Pick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it
[GS] Golden State, number one with a bullet
[XZ] It's three card molly
[RK] Will they ever stop?
[XZ] Probably not
[SN] Pull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop

[Verse 2: Saafir the Saucee Nomad]
The un-edited medic, on the cut, with a degree in metaphysics
A doctor, with a lot of patients/patience
And perseverance -- flows like an ocean liner
That sails/sales like a clearance, I'm bilingual
Fly like a flamingo, I'm a pitcha, everything I freak
I eat like Al Pacino, you don't like me baby
You ain't happy, you need some Ecstasy
Now you in my properties, but you have to pay my equity
For the lowest point in my character
I'll reach the highest place in the house when I rock
Like the Qu'ran, fuse hot, fluid with flavor like buillion cube
Been this way since I was fourteen
And like this I been runnin shit without the use of Sportscreme
Rippin up tracks like immigrant Chinese, peep the game I lay
I'm grim, I brim over my brow when I rip
Never write rhymes with slim fingertips
Each syllable you choose to use is light as a flower
Keep tryin to go gold
But all you're gettin is a golden shower

Chorus

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Look, now if it wasn't for the West
These rap niggas wouldn't need a vest around they chest
Keep bustin about where you rest, and what you own, and what you drive
So the day some niggas come for you I'm really not surprised
Mr. Black Bruce Willis, please don't kill us
I show mercy like Kevorkian, like a scorpion
We sting you from behind and put it in you, so meet me at the venue
Put you on the spot to put you on the menu
Fricasseed emcee, we be the ones that keep the pussy hot
Xzibit livin life, like a bull inside a china shop
Strippin everything, see you ain't even got a dime to drop
Go ahead and call the cops, you ain't said nathin
Jerry Spring-you out the studio, then Suge Knight you
To the parkin lot, niggas ain't ready for all this heat we got
Picture yourself crushin Xzibit with your tough talk
That's like Christopher Reeves doing the crip walk

Chorus(Intro)(Sauce Money + Ras Kass + Sheek Louch)
(S) What we going to do right we going to start this mother fucker of in
Brooklyn best style you heard me
(R) (Sauce mother fuckin)
(S) Then I am going to past it to my nigga and we going to swing over to the
Y.o. you know
(R)(SL) (Ruff ryder style)(Sheek Louch)
(S) Then we going to pass it to my other nigga and we going to do it west
Side style you know
(R) (West side)

[Verse One: Sauce Money]
I spit solely for the guacamole
Come through and make a rapper do a back flip rock a rolly and
Reach for my Glock slowly if you try to interfere on how I stack chips
I take chicks to the tele just a happy fan
Now she wanna get a glimpse of my magic hand
She said she like the way it stretch out like plastic man
Sauce money tell me where would you have it land
Told shorty look I got to get back to my grands
Hurry up I am in the rush like jackie chan
Married woman, single or engaged, hood rats still got them to creep
Now we rock them to sleep
Because we got the best songs that pesese charm
Besides if you tricky you just chance head strong
Rappers better respect dons and ex-cons
And keep your vest on this is how we speak with teflon

[Verse Two: Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo it's Sheek Louch nigga and I will pop till y'all gone
Only thing I knew niggas popped and it's gone
And y'all might pop shit but that's about it
What you know about guns that come out my sleeve
And bullets that fly around your head like bee's
That will hit you and leave holes the size of pee's jes
When I flow it's like tae-kwon-doe
On some do-jo and it just a hobby
How fuck Daniel-san going to beat Mr. Miyagi
Wax on wax off with a knock out or better
I leave three through the E of your Enyce sweater
What pop shit and I am first day delivery
Straight threw your chest pope on your block
In a big brown truck like I am ups
And I don't know about y'all that re-up real small
You don't spend more then a thousand at the mall
If you owe sheek pay me I don't care how you hit me
It don't race me if your car don't cost more then fifty
I'm that cat that threatens on y'all mc's
With a devil flow that will pop your rosary beeds
I from where bitches that know about cooking up coke
Bring ever gram back and keep heat by the twat
That will blend in perfect in a deminacan spot
Now it's me that nigga that shine like glitter
And I must say dogg I am a hell of a spitter
We finish things y'all hell of a quiters

[Verse Three: Ras Kass]
I spit from the genitals bitch, leave 'em masculine skinch
Got niggas panackin, petro and penanican flinch
Grew a mechanical inch the root of all evil
Green theft and green spray with a tech but we can't all eat thow
Cause y'all fethal, we run lethal, homicide victims of Fairfax and Pico
Sugar nobody is ever equal [why] cause the more we make
The more we taking from other people
Livin in puerto rico padarin LAX to JFK
At baggage claim with three hoes like Santa's day
My third eye be the equivilant to the album red pie
So I give you a piece of my mind, just multiply times infinite
Spiritual elevate so I high commite drive bye's while I sky dive
Sip on my time perform shit only concieved in sci-fi so why try test
It's boom bye bye Mr. Ice real guy
You must have been looking some where else like biggie smalls lazy eye
Pop sicker then your average Acquired Immune Deficiency Symdrome infected fast

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
We don't care where your from nigga east or west
And we don't care what you wear we don't aim for the vest
It's lox, sauce and Ras Kass three of the best
Only niggas with money we don't fuck with the rest
We don't care where your from nigga east or west
And we don't care what you wear we don't aim for the vest
It's lox, sauce and Ras Kass three of the best
Only niggas with money we don't fuck with the rest ya heard

[Ras Kass]
It's like that nigga and it's always gonna be like that so you peeon as niggas
I got a new word for you y'all niggas boon walk that mean beat it backwards
Fuck out of here nigga the matrix Sheek Louch my nigga Sauce Money Ras Kass
Blaze sky walker nigga the matrix get the fuck out of here[Crooked I]
Yo Iceman, watch how I come in this bitch off note
And bang for my team
If Mozart a genius, I’m the same fucking thing
Compare me the Pavarotti, I just can’t fucking sing
If life is a fight I’mma aim duck and swing
I don’t have to write ’cause these lyrics came from a dream
Ssut ssut COB blame the regime
It's like green screen
The way we changed up the scene
Chain with the cross on it
Lamb shank with the cabernet sauce on it
And act a beat with the boss on it, slaughter
All upon it it’s the God of
The west coast water
I can’t walk on it y’all want it
Nah, that’s a reason and die swallowing math equations
Tryin' to eat my piece of the pie
See I set my goal, so extremely high
I can’t see 'em from my first class seat in the sky
And before my plane departed
I walk in security they say a chain retarded
Are you a famous artist, no
But fuck yeah my name regarded
As an underground beast I’m just trying to change the target
Meet Ras Kass & Kurupt this a holiday
Niggas better move like pedestrians right away
I give you the blue print to thug life
Like I’m reciting Pac and Jay
The modern day Marvin Gaye
’Cause my pops wanna pop me
I would drop him before he drop me
Didn’t raise me and before cops can knock me
I would throw the Glock away when they stop me
And tell 'em my name is Scott free
Oh, I’m from the wicked west
Do I have a limit yes ,my limit is limitless
Fuck a cabby I packy
I blast from the back seat of his taxi
Then pass it to Ras Kass

[Ras Kass]
Fat pole in a slimy track
Grown up folk with a shiny gat
For more ex pills than tiny had
Sat where my crime is set
Never been a whiny rat
Stegosaurus rap reptilian with a spiny back
My East side bitch got hit with a shiny bat
In the wheelchair but her vagina ain’t handicaped
Uh, her vagina ain’t handicapped
Mensa member, big dick, good lookin' nigga, Annie rap
What you think all the guns is for
I’m going on tour in Mordor
With an elf queen for more whores
Throw us a Mexican drug warlord before poor
The skull of Abe Lincoln, seven years and four score
Want more call Crooked I, you could be Chinese
With the side ways face you’re not Crooked I
Cali don’t give a fuck gotta get through us
Lost lyricist trust now I pass to Kurupt

[Kurupt]
Heaven’s got a gape in hole the souls are mischief, mischievous souls
Hell’s frozen over pola I arose
Corrosion erosion temples are stealing stone
Crumble to the tone of the voice of vigilance
Violence in a judge,by the black a gap clap smoked then vaporized
Berserk a hydra, Cerberus
Wrap the titans connected to bend in both sides
Simultaneously at the same time he is eye
Double jeopardy, Gemini
Walk on the red carpet and turned it blue
Stand like a statue mind yourself
Reverse the camera lights and blind yourself
I’m the unseen sentinel sentinel
Oh, sent to your dough step to make buildings fall
I don’t wear ice my nigga I’m cold already and diamonds can’t freeze my wrist
I’m froze already, the future was already been wrote and cold already
The coded exposed we wrote and code already
Its the end of the end and beginning to begin
When it ends it all and it starts over again nigga
Heaven’s got a gapin' hole the souls are mischief
Escaped the road on the road to redemption Arctic
And art the archangel when hence means
Soaking these rodent rappers
Drenching in the instinct firing golf to body
Send in, in an instinct god he ate off the body
Send in every into 'em ,Hitler
Bitter bitter turn them to cat litter
Infrastructure are crumbled, infra-red spitter
Got 'em like an eye grass crooked eye cash bringing these niggas
Corruption world wide
Money ain’t a thing. bitches ain't shit
And neither are you nigga eat a fat dick
Hoes give me money niggas get shot
Every day in LA every way and every night
Every night, Every night
West coast murder[Produced by Apollo Brown]

[Sample]
"If you're smart you'll take my advice
Believe me I know"

[Scratching]
"4" "8"

[Intro]
Young Razzy put you up on game
Show you how to be a boss, so your nuts gon' hang

[Verse 1]
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
It's only pimps and hoes, everybody a cannibal
Rob Greene wrote the manual, I just transcribed it
To keep myself reminded, to succeed and grind with
Rule number uno, never outshine the master
Dudes at the top insecure, egotistical bastards
Threatened by a nigga if you better than them
Scared you shine too much, make more cheddar than them
Rule number 2, 2Pac told me
Keep your enemy's close, nigga watch your homies
Rule 3, conceal your intentions
Keep haters out your business
Quick to get jealous and try to monkey wrench it
Rule number 4, always say less than necessary
Like politician's rhetoric, keep 'em second guessin'
Rule 5, is guard your reputation
Intercept the hate in every situation
Rule seis, court attention at all costs
Ball 'til you drop but they claimin' you fall off
And Puff Daddy perfected rule number 7
Get others to do your work, but take all the credit
Rule 8, make others come to you
He been used bait, a lot of us learn 9 too late
Is win through actions, never through argument
Even if you right, they resentful wanna harbor shit

[Hook]
You gotta learn the tricks of the street [x8]

[Verse 2]
10, avoid the unhappy and unlucky
Negativity rub off, stop fuckin' with [?]
Next spot, 11, what pimps and slave masters do
Keep people dependin' on you
Rule 12 is how you avoid animosity
Use selective honesty, disarmed with generosity
Marie Antoinette said "feed 'em cake"
That shit could backfire, find your head on a stake
13, when askin' for help, appeal to people's self interest
Like lookin' out for you is good business
14, pose as a friend, work as a spy
Watch them hoes, dog, they do it all the time
1-5, crush your enemies totally
No unfinished beefs, niggas scrimmage with heats
And get revenge homicidally
You don't wanna end up like O-Dog and Caine in Menace II Society

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Next rule's a jewel, stay exclusive as fuck
Don't be a regular, last asshole leavin' the club
17, stay unpredictable, 18, never isolate yourself
Rule 19 is good for your wealth
Know who you're dealin' with first, before you start cursin'
Offend the wrong persons, mothafucka then it's curtains
Rule number 20 is don't commit
Rule 21, seem dumber than your mark, play stupid
Deuce deuce, transform weakness to power
Let meekness devour, sweetness is sour
Concentrate your forces, don't spread yourself thin, son
Jack of all trades, master of none
That's rule number 23, here's 24 then
He got game though, but not Mike Jordan
Make the people love you, play the perfect courtier
Be that nigga, so they always supportin' yah
The little man be playin' the fool
So how you gon' win when you playin' to lose?
And when you master these, then come see me
Get your prescription refilled by Razzy PhD, nigga
48 laws of power
Here's the first 24 and it's not Jack Bauer
Young Razzy put you up on things
Show you how to be a boss, so your nuts gon' hang

[Hook][O.C.]
Uhh
You don't stop baby (mm-hmm)
Shawn J. baby (what?) Period
O.C. baby (O.C. baby)
Ras Kass baby (Ras Kass baby)
U.N.I.Versal (Unique versitile baby)
Uh-huh, ?big loot baby, thuglicious?
Yeah, uhh, set it

Yo, what's poppin baby? I haven't heard from you lately
We used to conversate day to day on the daily
Remember when I saw you I passed my car I was on my celly
Sittin on the twenty inch Pirelli's
Earring in your belly button caught my eye, oh Nelly
Turned a nigga whole preserve into jelly
You and I rollin a Phillie, but not cheesesteak
My man on my side checkin out the broad's cake
He said the shortie got the bubble like a Lex
I could look at her thighs and fantasize about the sex (mm-hmm)
Check, now I get a call from my nigga Ras and blew
West coast connect (Aiyyo what's crackin doe?) Ahh it's on you
It's like I'm trying to get this dough, so my pocjets ain't hollow
Get my Jake Rollo on with the broads and pop bottles (uhh-huh)
Baby never ever hollow (never, never, bring it nigga)

Chorus: O.C. (singing)

Call me.. don't waste our time if you don't wanna talk to us
Call me.. we got action guar-an-teed
*repeat*

[Ras Kass]
Me and the home-BA-BY, we sniffin some Kurtis Blow
Like "If I Ruled the World" but without the Jheri curl though
Break mind off proper, so O is you with me?
Want two titties in every city, my children jiggy like
A billion little Biggie's -- you dig me? (That's right)
I'm mashin, Ras Kassin, hoo-bang, WESSYDE
Don't be mad, cause I'm tossin up your woman
It's a party in her panties and I'm the only one comin
Keep money in the bank and kept your girl on her knees
My conversation like birdseed so chickenheads PLEASE
I got game in ten different languages
My name is 24-karat ice, the most dangerous
Man you never knew is bangin yo' fiancee
Backseat of a rented Cadillac Elente
I'm Dante, and all I really had to say
Aye mami, tu ?fudio? es grande
Now you can catch me in the broken land
Or at the Golden Lady, having strippers swallow my babies
Ain't even the maybe, no ho pan is savin em
I'm strip searchin bitches like security at the Palladium

Chorus

[O.C.]
Phenomenon worth 4-5-6 when in the mix
Goin once goin twice like mice be tricky
O.C. snatch cheese, you settin the trap?
When it's said and done I put your nipples in my gap
*sssst* That's the sound when I nibble at your cheese nips
Watch it or that'll be the last thing you breathe BEYOTCH
Dealin with pure fuckery, so you can't see self respect
Honey stop suckin me you're lovin me

[Ras Kass]
I be Brown, Foxy like Uh-Oh! Uh-Oh!
One for the money, two for the show
Three for more dough a fo'-fo' and five mics
But disrespect mine potnah you're soon to die twice
I rhyme right, so you lime like gum
But in rhyme fights niggas bite like Mike Ty-son
We be kickin it, peep how a nigga boister
I gets my swerve on rockin the Rolex oyster

Chorus 2X

[O.C.] Call me (3X)[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
It was all a dream
I used to read the Source magazine
2Pac and Biggie Smalls drinking Hennesseys
You fiend to see Public Enemy number one with a bullet
Cap peeler turn niggas ?seasons? to mullets (like whoa!)
Like ninja assassins!
Make the floor creak, bottom of my feet got latches
All grown up; now I'm smashin' an Aston
The world turns about as fast as the cash spends
Avalanche, leave them gaspin' in Aspen
You a never was, I'd rather be a has-been
But I'm right now and this is right now
You're allergic to skill so put the mic down
My bitches take E pills, daze and vic- down
My shoe game's sick, shit looks like Niketown
I see through niggas just like a nightgown
You're about to witness the evolution of sight sound

[Hook]
ADIDAS - All day I dream about spittin
ADIDAS - The freestyle sounds like writtens
A.D.I.D.A.S - I'm so fresh
ADIDAS - All day I dream about spittin
ADIDAS - Put the mic down, dawg, you're bullshitting
A.D.I.D.A.S - I'm so fresh


[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Sportin my suede PUMAs
Gore-Tex, K-Swiss, Diadora, Ellesse
British Knights
FILAs ma mia, Morris, Reeboks
?Sergio?, ?The Kings? Sweatsuits
Remember back in the days
EK glasses, snakeskin on the frames
Don't hate on me man
I walk the street like its magic data grain
Once again, an unsigned hype
Hypochondriac, I'm sick all the time
What kind of style do y'all like?
I got that SARS, that swine flu
Spit bubonic, arthritis flow
Retire old cats like Suge did to Chronic
And my pistols demonic
So you can go to hell with an ass full of ?blue bonnets?
Yeah now they're finally dropping hot shit
Brittany Spears eating toys made in China - I'm toxic
Pick a bitch up holdin' my wood like chopsticks
While young niggas sold dope just to cop shit

Big drank, money and hoes! Look at ma-ma!
Ooh-wee! Losing her clothes. You get na-da!
Bitch please go work them poles!
Ahha!
If you like the way it goes, keep it ra-ra!
Big drank, money and hoes! Look at ma-ma!
Ooh-wee! Losing her clothes. You get na-da!
Go work them Cap'n-Save-a-Hoes!

[Verse One: Ras Kass]
These niggas rowdy-rowdy!
Never rains in Southern Cali -- only cloudy! How we
Hit the Valley in black Denalis like I am Johnny Gotti's
Street army that rock Armani!
Sorry somebody's baby mammy got fucked liked Oochie Wally Wally!
Probably, I'll be
Arriving tardy at my platinum party --
Poppin' wheelies on a Ducati! {phew!}
Bacardi got me
Arrogant, grouchy and cocky like jockey
I be too complicated to copy;
Can't stop me or cock-block me
Or block is craving for broccoli
My nuts' too big homey; they got me walking nutty!
I pop three collars at a time --
That's mine, my dime's, and every rhyme -- oh whoa!

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Ras Kass]
So quick, so fast:
Young niggas in the street is quick to blast
So get your cash up, mash, and sag your pants
See that's fo' sho'

They don't build niggas like us no more!
Cops better be robo -- we refuse to move slow!
Ye know!
Rassy Kassy at the Hard Rock Café
With Floyd Mayweather, cussin out the valet
Shoes by Bally keep a nigga on his toes like ballet
Keeps a bitch like Cali? next to me now I shoot a movie
Or I slang with big drinks, big smokes, basically big thangs!
So kick rocks before we get in your ass like shit stains!
Bitch jock aka we switch names!
I am Dante, ain't really that much more to say
I speak latex -- let my plastic talk like parquet
Sumamabitch! That's how I lost my ex-fiancée;
She said, "Say my name!," then I came, and yelled "Beyoncé!"

[Hook]

Yaknahmsayin?
Niggas that ought to do it
Gunplay?
Wordplay?
Which ever way y'all want it, man
Y'all can do it either way you
Knom'sayin?
This is straight hustling shit
Don't get it twisted ,nigga
Filthy ass niggas - get them hoes' hands out yo pockets
Knahmsayin?
We will see you whenever you wanna be seen nigga
You know'mean
Get laid down anyway you wanna get laid down nigga
Get your shit together man Rassy Kassy, man
We hate y'all?
Connection in Brooklyn
Connections in Cali
Anywhere in between nigga
In between your girls thighs how you want it
All war nigga let's go[Ras Kass]
Jea! Re-Up! A J-Classic classic. Razzy... rest in peace Justo
I'm about to air these niggas out one time

[Verse 1]
Yo yo, ain't no nigga like the one right here
Spit flames, leave bloodstains on one night gear
G-Star jeans, gun right near
And the homey X just fucked Usher's bitch like "Yeah!"
Dawg I'mma spit the hottest shit
Fuck a dentist, eat a fire department and proctologists
Ras Kass, King of the West, acknowledge this
And get a piece of the rock like meteorogologists
What Dame Dash and hapha is
645 Coupe the same color Chewbacca is
And you's a nigga everybody hates like Jar Jar Binks
That clown at the bar buying hot bitches drinks
And she's passin' them to me
What you know about Chinchilla minks? Ten killers deep
Skittle flavored diamonds, first it's blue, then it's pink
Candy painting was off, dog we floodin' the streets

[Hook 1]
I
WILL
NOT
LOSE
I (RE-UP about that fetti)
WILL (Load up your Glocks, get ready)
NOT
LOSE (haha... jea jea jea!)

[Hook 2]
Hood niggas if your arms up, bear it out
Niggas ain't scared, if it's drama, we gon' air 'em out!
If your whip on chrome, what you carin' 'bout?
Drop the top, do a buck 10, dawg, air 'em out!
Who spit flame, nigga never doubts?
No problem, it's nothing, I'mma air 'em out
East, West, up North to the Dirty South (air 'em out)
I'mma (air 'em out), I'mma (air 'em out)

Yo

[Verse 2]
I keep shit off the chain
Like broken clasp, medallions fallin' off
And yall niggas hopin' Ras go play on the freeway
But I'm that agent in the Matrix: Reloaded
Jumpin' out movin' cars, smashin' your hoods for the keys, man
And not the ones that open doors
Por fa vor, I'm talkin' ki, mayne
Silencer on the SPK, fuck BDS them fuckin' MTV VJ's
R&B singers, new found fact
Got a 9 inch dick, tell your bitch to SoundScan that!
And my Down South cats be like "What it do?"
Cause my little cousin's bein' Memphis classic blue
And niggas still ga-not ga-knowin' as Gary ga-Knew(???)
Plus I'm more Chris Real so long with Big Punished brew
Downstairs in Jimmy's Cafe, album released
Young nigga in the belly, but now I'm a beast
And it's like Sin City, every town holdin' heat
So I'm like the yellow nigga, kid it's foul when I speak
And my baby moms said I need to cut down on my cheatin'
Started fuckin' midgets, kept creepin'
You ain't gotta tell me, I know you feelin' this shit
I hear what I'm sayin' I know I'm killin' this shit, nigga

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it all seems fucked up though
Rest in peace, cause what's mixtapes without Justo?
Sip the' Grey Goose, thinkin' about that ride on the Gray Goose
Ankles chained, headin' to Beirut
Crucified next to some nigga named Jesus
Died ressurected, bustin' blue, still trey-deuced
So yall niggas better respectognize shits real
When my mixtape's hotter than every album this year

[Hook 1] + [Hook 2][Twista]
All or nothin', fuck all the bluffin', won't let the po-po arrest me;
Try to hit the deck to bless me
But I'm still broke so I ride like Frank & Jesse
But they can't catch me. Breakin' niggas off like a sawed-off
Comin' for the fetty, man; my millimeter bringin' better things
When I pull, like a better bang, so if I have to, I'mma let it rang/
Gotta handle my functions, but an outcome, I have a somethin
Instead of nothin', haters hold me down
And servin' thru a stickup or somethin'
Now I gotta pick up the pump and let it ride
All or nuthin, step aside, or you can hit the paper big time;
You gon' murder like strychnine, wit' a grip nine, sever bitch time
Cuz I gotta mine, and it's on

[Ras Kass]
You comin' up short like a million midgets masturbatin';
Masqueradin' as the most murderous madman militia
My nigga Twista told me
Monopolize, strategize, maximize, make money to win
With career sinners intake us, sinners
Turn ya whole placenta magenta, quintessential inventor
Please, we C's and B's, VL's and GD's;
Got OG's, OZ's, keys for these millionaire mo-neys
Release your shells, my nigga;
Knew the job was dangerous, when I took it, why's a player
Dark tides, or say on how to walk crooked, look it
Got a sophisticated ho mob
With assassin bitches that give my shotgun barrel blow jobs
So when the four stickin out like a sore toe thong
It's no prob, vocally for sure squad, thorough man

[Hook 2X]
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Stacks that you can't float
Kick in the door, we on the floor, come up off a G and 2 hundred mo'
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Shit, all or nothin', no bluffin', if I have to, I'm bustin'

[Twista]
Nigga worthless to bones, like nickels to quarters
Fallers to shot callers, all of gotta get the paper somehow
For the school of the gun style, see me til the cops call us
Hell brought us, to a situation where we gotta driveby
Let the bullets from my nine fly, to murder who you was deprived by
But I admit sometimes if it wasn't for crime I'd
Probably be broke and homeless while the start keep it low goin, homeless
So I'm hookin up wit Ras Kass, on some shit we can stack cash
But if I have to pull back a rag fast, on that ass nigga

[Ras Kass]
These savage streets full wit jackas, racists, crackers and cannibals
So it's understandable, why I'm half man, half animal
Ridin' through the hood on my elephant like Hannibal
See, I used to have dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch
And I used to dreams of bein' 21 and rich
One outta two ain't bad, though, now I'm tryin' to be rich by age 25
See Shall I survive that new world abchao
But you don't hear me

[Hook 2X]

[Ras Kass]
Homeboy, my game's tight:
I could talk the Virgin Mary out her panties the same night
From a cocoon on the dark side of the moon
The illest nigga existin', I know who you are:
FUBAR, fucked up beyond all recognition
In the middle of the ghetto I'm buildin' a casino
Like Bugsy Siegel illegal employ niggas and Latinos
Shootout wit the ATF and FEMA, to free C-BO, see dough
They got me  like Steven Biko, cept I  pack vente cinqo
Rowdy Los Angeleno, you got knocked the fuck out like Deebo

[Hook 2X][Sample]
"Misused, abused, down harder than blues"

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, let me kill this beat Apollo. Watch me slay it

[Hook]
Goat
Witness animal sacrifice
I bar up, won't none of y'all rap tonight
Goat (Killa!)
Kosher Halal
Bow down princess, you love my style
Goat
Witness animal sacrifice
I bar up, won't none of y'all rap tonight
Goat (Killa!)
Man down
Coming for every single spitter for the motherfucking crown

[Verse 1]
Day one
Niggas knew the kid was a problem
Exploded out C-Arson, bombing the Green Goblin
A team king mobbing
Wake Up Show would put rappers to sleep
Sway and Tech used to beep me to eat
Every single rapper, west coast to the east
Forced they throats to leak, [?]
I'm at least top ten breathing on land, me
Helped Dylan raps, I got skills like Lee
Which Lee? Any Lee, choose two
Spike Lee, Bruce Lee, Stan Lee, Chun
From Street Fighter 2 with the fire fall shoe
Studied the best bars old school to the new
A student of the flame, KRS, Big Daddy Kane
Rakim, Ice Cube, Scarface and Treach through my veins
They influenced 2Pac, he and Biggie became brothers
And them niggas influenced each other
You ever spit a perfect one take verse on a Primo track?
You ever get Dr. Dre's top five in rap?
Cats can't even spit a 16 at a rap show
But going on a rap tour make me not wanna rap no more
I got rap galore
Blacks is whores
When Grammy for best album, fucking go to Macklemore
Wack for sure
How you get a big check, start worshiping Baphomet
That's why I slash your neck
Watch me slay it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I am a, phenomena
Amen-Ra rhyming, and I'm in a
Carrie's pig blood at the prom state of mind
Pants, one leg at a time
I put on both legs at the same time with a rhyme
This friendly competition unless your bars suck
Use ghostwriters, unsportsmanlike like conduct
Huh
Same drama since '84
Nigga claim he the king cause heavy play on radio
(Now how the illest MC debate should go)
Erase the beat, bar for bar, I'll rape your show
No industry politics, I'll take your doe
Give us the same opportunities I'll break you bro
Burn your compound down like it's Waco yo
I don't believe the media or Wikipedia
I travel to niggas.com, Expedia
To see the immediate origins of patterns and bars
Jaz-O begot Jigga, G. Rap begot Nas
I study the solo and crews of rap gods
Wu-Tang, Outkast, Lox and Def Squad
Black Star, Black Thought, Black Hippy to Black Rob
Ask Em' and Royce, I suggest you do the math
Even before Aftermath, Ras Kass was the path
I created the lane, west coast lyricist
They Hendrix
I'm Kendrick before Kendrick

[Hook]

[Bridge] {x2}
Dropped a few mixtapes?
Relax little nigga
Gotta pay dues to be a true spitter
Got a couple hit albums?
Congrats little nigga
Consistently bar up to prove you a spitter

[Sample]
"When I rose, I look to Jesus with a smile
I said, "Jesus, will you help me?
Help me to be live the best I can
Cause I..."[Verse 1]
I rock Versace, sippin' VSOP and Hennessey in foam cups
Motorola flips with illegal chips
Dip-pin' like Teela where everybody momma collectin money from FEMA
Five series Beemer, one-hundred and eighty-nine horsepower
I like bitches with dimples and nipples the size of silver dollars
Rollin three deep in Eddie Bauers chokin out LAPD Rottweilers
Like chihuahuas, all day eryday
In Southern California where the dogs and the ribs stay
And nowadays fools don't know how to act
Cause we all wanna be Tony Montana
Matter of fact, gimme five we got dap, gimme twenty-five
We got a bird and profit is made
So while the homey cut cavi with a razor blade
I rock beats without baking soda
And money gets washed it's only illegal if you get caught
Thought you knew cause the DEA do it too
Keep seperate books for the internal revenue
Capitalism is pimps and hoes
In ninety-six I 'spose anything goes

[Refrain]
Big bank take little bank anything goes
Legal or illegal however you make your cash flow
Big bank take little bank ahh anything goes
Legal or illegal however you make your cash flow

[Verse 2]
All you PH Ballers and Dirty Mack's need to KG
I'd rather be a dope MC than a broke OG
I get manicures to keep my cuticles suitable
Player, don't hate me because I'm beautiful
I got a pocket full of C-notes and food stamps
Just big bills and free meals baby so lamp
Cause jealousy gets you burned like bad perms
If you live you learn, I spit game like Chick Hearn
To women with, measurements of 38-24-36 with DSL's
But money talks ESL
In the game of Monopoly, if you don't pass go then go di-rectly to jail
Cause I've seen fools that struggle and turn they ownself into the po-po
It keeps the humble up their culo
Selling ten dollar J's right up under the man's nose
Hahh, nigga anything goes

[Refrain]

[Interlude]
One for the money (money), two for the show (show)
Three for the ladies but all they wanted was one
It's one for the money (money), two for the show (show)
Three for the ladies but all they wanted was one

[Verse 3]
Niggas got stripes like, Tony the Tiger
But niggas got strikes like Oral Hershiser
So look alive, inflation rise like yeast
S&L scandal stole millions
But we need more police to take back our streets, it's drama
We all know that one-time be extortin them big-ballers
Gettin extradited with warrants in three states
Overcrowded prisons hopin the DA drop the case
So uhh, I ain't forgot about the homey Kevin
He pled no contest and got stretched til ninety-seven
Dizmost and Little Dags hold tight
I know I seldom shoot kites but I be tryin to get my pockets right
My ideal real is Big Willie pourin out Dom P
For the dead homies with bitches splittin Phillies (call it ends)
Call it loot scrilla cream green flow or dough
But to get mo' nigga, anything goes

[Refrain x2]

"It's no disguise, it makes no sense
It doesn't fit, if it doesn't fit, you must acquit"

[Interlude (fades)]Xzibit Intro:
Yo it's the almight Xzibit. In the Law House huh
With Laylaw huh and D-Mac huh (Ras Kass)
Ntroducing huh. The nigga Ras Kass ha
We all know and love him ha
Yo let's bring it through youknowhatI'msayin'
Bring that shit through nigga. What's up yo yo

Ras Kass:
Well it's the R double AK triple S the letters of my name
For you and your bitch to unscramble on Soul Train
This Arch Angel got niggas shooked like crack babies
I think of bomb shit like my brain was made outta M-80s (caviar)
I flow 16 Pablo Escobar perverse perversion' so fat my dick got a double chin
My MCin' produce more seaman then wet dreamin'
Of hostin' BET with Rachel in the Caribbean
C-arson home of niggas with gold Visas and heaters
Sendin' Jesus subpoenas
(Got you singin' duets with Selena nigga)
So Sister Act
Cause black nun (none) get love
And I'm a have juice till Mark Ferman plants the bloody glove
I drive European cars and smoke Cuban cigars
Bring it phat to your ears like Warren G's keyloyds
From B-boys to D-boyz it's like shippin' keys from overseas
Please I move MC's like o.z.s

Hook:
See niggas from outta town don't even fuck around

Ras Kass:
But there ain't no angel that you can strangle Los Angels

Xzibit:
See handguns and girls that's the way of the underworld

Ras Kass:
There ain't no angel that you can strangle Arch Angels (say what?)

Ras Kass:
See left coast niggas is the Craziest
I dodge shotgun pellets in the felonious Los Skandalous
Golden State
Home of dysfunctional gang truces
5.8 quakes where glass houses pancake (westsiiiiiide)
But I be in the hood like a rebuilt engine
Fuck what I'm benchin' I weave through tracks like extensions (nigga)
I'm ridin' for chips like on time on motorcycles
And for looters to get trifle
I'm like a chink on a Slason swap meet roof with two automatic rifles
Puberty got me Vicious
And these generation X bitches is too big for they britches
15 goin' on 30
"I wanna fuck" written all over their faces with mack compact blowin' kisses
Promoted like seven oasis gettin' niggas twisted in statutory rape cases
But I write rhymes in enough white lines askin' Melle Mel my punchlines
Hit from the baseline like six by nines
Crack addicts and Reggie Miller
That's fo reala
I X more Hollywood Squares than Phillis Dilla

Hook:

Xzibit:
Yeah niggas from outta town don't even fuck around

Ras Kass:
But there ain't no angel that you can strangle Los Angels (yeah)

Xzibit:
Welcome to the place where niggas make moves

Ras Kass:
Nigga there ain't no angel that you can strangle Arch Angels

Xzbit:
Handguns and girls that's the way of the underworld

Ras Kass:
But there ain't no angle that you can strangle Los Angels (ha)

Xzibit:
Home of the scandalous big bad Los Angeles

Ras Kass:
But there ain't no angel that you can strangle Arch Angels

Ras Kass:
You know man all I have in this world is two things man
That's my word and my balls
Or maybe that's three things
So on microphones I let my nuts hang like John Homes
And took so many niggas out I should change my name to Chaperone
D-Mac and Laylaw know that on mic cables
I got one thousand two hundred techniques similar to the turntable
So if it's crem de la creme since I'm smarter I oughta
Float like dead bodies in water
Manana tell your girl this here mayatti got one extra backstage pass
If she put 'em on the glass
Cause she be jockin' rappers that be seen with who's who
The single charters so she blows me for a hit like cluckheads do
No MC parallels they behind bars like Rick's jail cell
To rock well I need a beat like...
Child abuse victims (ha ha)
Everything I say turn to yay
This shit was blowin' kids away before Timothy McVeigh

Hook

Xzibit outro:
Yeah yeah straight from motherfuckin' Xzibt ha ha and the Lawhouse
YouknowhatI'msayin' with that nigga Ras Kass (he's guilty)
Yeah yeah. Break it down. It won't stop. West coast hip hop (yo yo)
It's the almighty Xzibit (booyaka)[Verse One]:
My sorrow is gothic
Phantom of the Opera, inspiration is haunted
Pain is the poetry that made my muse nauseous
That's how I make mu-SICK
Rappers claiming a gangsta excuse for not doing no new shit
Down south they screw hits
I'd rather screw a silencer into a gat in slow-mo and 'do hits'
SK whisper like a sex symbol
Little cousin affiliated, neck tatted with a set symbol
It's like, ain't no hope in the world
Mike Jack want the little boys, R. Kelly want the little girls
And I don't know which is worse
I'm tryna snatch Alicia Keyes purse so I can learn a woman's worth
Parker doin' dirt, got hip hop cops
Tryna RICO Law a nigga if I don't go pop
But still can't solve the murders of 'Pac and Chris Wallace
Racial profiling, rapper profilers

[Hook]:
Niggas get ya bars up, spit a 100 bars what
Stop dick riding, fuck bitch you star struck
Get ya bars up, Henny Patron
Get ya bars up, double R up, get ya cars up
Get ya bars up, spit a 100 bars what
Stop dick riding, fuck bitch you star struck
Get ya bars up, money, hoes and chucks
Get ya stars up, niggas get ya bars up

[Verse Two]:
Fuck Hip Hop nigga, that's skull junk
I write classics to make ya think about somethin
Fuck if ya dance to it, here's a leg-breaker
Hold a hand grenade, now shake it like a salt shaker
Homie, drop a bomb to that
Decapitate a hostage after we bomb Iraq
And penitentiaries is packed with old black niggas
Mad cause they crack smoked they life away
Hate a youngster cause he see in him his lost youth
Some motherfuckers be testing, number one jail house lesson
Heard misery loves company
Is that why failure and sabotage keep bumping and grinding on me?
Humble nigga, but I learned in life
People don't respect nothing but pre-emptive strikes
And 9 times out of 10 you can avoid bullshit
For the 10th, the reason I carry nines with full clips
Felon, lost the right to bear arms, so I wear long sleeves
Please believe I will still pull it
But the state of California done passed that new law
The Governator giving out a year for each bullet

[Hook]

[Verse Three]:
They say the first shall be last, last shall be first
My last name start with the letter A
Am I cursed? My moms gave birth inside a coffin
6 feet under the dirt, quenching a sick thirst
So I'm hungry enough to eat a bitch lung like Big Lurch
My battle between Angels and Demons, it gets worse
Won't put you on the cover cause you mastered grammar
But put you on the cover if you dance like Hammer
Fuckin hypocrites, I'm just telling the truth
Never stopped being spiritual but I still lust material
Diamond mines, slavery back again
And I'm smart enough to know what's happenin
But that don't stop me from having a pinky ring
Or a icy gold chain when you see me in traffic man
And I'm probably just ignorant enough to stunt
And gold-dip a real life African

[Hook][Verse 1: Montage One]

Well orchestrated word play complicated
Obligated from bar one to sixteen
Hooks with the deadliest catch the amphetamine
Dope rhymes like coke lines of ketamine
Beats cooked in the jungles of the Medallín
With blood diamonds rap blinding better bling
Mac ten machine clapping everything
And GPS lyrical threats mapping everything
I got the game in the scope and the cross hairs
Wild grizzly punchline you park bears
Full mansion studios in dark lairs
Nigga we not fare murder rappers right there
And emancipate songs in a greater rate
I leave critics to talk like its Laker hate
Fly rap over heads I aviate
And bang beats to death like a skull from heavy weight...[Ras Kass]
Yeah
I'ma need to succeed so I bleed on papyrus
Used to sleep with a Swede, you would think she was Linus
When she squeezed like I'm a security blanket at night
It's like "Please, let me breathe" but she think she your highness
And she thinks she's the finest I mean - she is fly
But when it comes to my rhymin, and comes to my grindin
I got crowns to get like Harry Potter
Flyin broomsticks, when he found the snitch
Bitch, see time will tell
When I'm struttin through this concrete jungle with a lion's tail
Cain't nobody stop me from pursuin my dreams
And haters negativity just motivates the team
Tellin girls real shit, they'd rather I lie to 'em
Cause it's not what they wanna hear gotta say goodbye to 'em
It's my rhythm; I move to the beat of my own drum
The semi-auto pop and lock like Rerun
Wash my face with the apricot scrub
Like a bearskin, rap nigga face on my rug
Wipe my feet on it, some random hot chick
In the place that I hug, she probably just tasted my cum
I'm just a bachelor, been told I'm kinda moody
Fuck it, I'm a Libra, don't like it baby then sue me
This is not a romantic comedy, life is not that movie
It's more like Color Purple, family members desert you
Racism will hurt you, hot women will flirt too
But fuck with the right nigga he will murk you
All I need is one mic, one Mac, one iPhone
Just one shot in this one life then I'm gone
I spit that - love me or leave me alone
That's exactly how I feel, I'm only bein real
Cause I was destined to do great things
Blackjack like ace king, self-actualized since eighteen

[Evidence]
Yo, uhh, yo
Raised by QD3, we seen the years of menace
They can't evict a landlord, I proceed over the tenant
I mostly co-sign, get my pen out in minutes
Six minutes 'til showtime, overseas with Al The Chemist
E to the V, my life like I seen the most
Afraid to go see P., like they seen a ghost
"Follow the Leader" though, track record ratio
Blue sky, look into the heaven, try to stay below
The flow bricked up raw but packaged eloquent
Stubborn as a bull, still the memory is elephant
Never forget a friend, that's veteran etiquette
I'm possibly better than but never let it get
Anywhere near the here, the end of my last chapter
My first one was mapped up
Some format close but no two identical, that's a replica
+Weathermen+ and cats and dogs, the flow is chemical
Lord have mercy, not every verse is skin deep
But inspiration's up, not every new leak has been weak
Hoped for the best and knew the worst when it cursed me
Been searchin for my soul, the second you but not the first me
My people gotta eat and worse when we thirsty
The wolves smell the blood, didn't find us but they searchin
So on that note, I coulda chose crime but chosen to rhyme
Evidence with Ras-sy, it's such a beautiful grind

[Outro]
SHUT UP!!! 50 years ago we'd have had you
Upside down with a fucking fork up your ass
{*laughter and shock*}
You can talk, you can talk, you can talk!
You're brave now motherfuckker!
Throw his ass out. He's a nigger! He's a nigger!!!
He's a nigger!!! (Oh my God)
A nigger, look, there's a nigger!
Oooooooooh[Verse 1]
I spit for the cabbage, grind with a mission
And put Capitol Records in missionary positions
Used to love H.E.R. like Common, but then you get signed
(Behind the Music) now I just fuck the music from behind

They wanna know how it feels, locked on penitentiary tiers
Shit, I was locked down on Priority for eight years
At least I got good time, half time in
Now it's halftime, I'm kicking ether like Nasir
Not here to be liked, came to redefine control of a mic
Y'all still stoning prophets in spite
Not phased with my spot in the light, let you tell it
Ras bitter and jealous, no I'm just better a spitter
They try to paint my LP's as mistakes, tell me
How you judge the greatest by how many records are sold
I've got no regrets for the records I make
How can I disown my own soul?
This childhood hobby, adult hustle
Don't respect the God, mother made you motherfuck you
My {?} gospel pull video of the year, presented to you
I'm stuck in a contract, no medical or dental boo
I'm miserable, y'all niggas think it's all gravy?
Stunt 'til they pay me, and I don't give a fuck
If I sold one or one million, but I see you do
Only good as your last record, bad first week you're through
Music is a business and the business of business is to make money
Creativity, they take from me
I never flopped, I just stayed hip-hop
When y'all hijacked rap music, crashed into pop
Watch dudes go plat', and overnight hot
Then every clown run to use the same producer he got
And now your song ain't a hit if so-and-so ain't make the beat
Same dickriders used to say that nigga's beats weak
Just Blaze said it best - collabo's happen now
For strategy and marketing, niggas only doing features
If your SoundScan sparkling
No more magic, pullin my leg like Go Go Gadget

[Hook]
One minute they hate you, next minute they love you
Next minute it's fuck you, then they forget you
You can play the coon, clown around this year
Trust me, you won't be around next year
One minute they hate you, next minute they love you
Next minute it's fuck you, then they forget you
Think I've figured out this hip-hop shit
Hypocrites put you on a pedestal, just to kick you down that bitch

[Verse 2]
I'm still a rap fan, microphone fiend
An insider like Russell Crowe, behind the scenes
You can be the hottest MC, literally leave the mic smoking
No marketing and promotion
No 106 & Park, no TRL
Don't kill the messenger homey but don't expect to sell
Viacom own MTV, VH1
BET, five labels until BMG
Merged with Sony, EMI, Universal and WEA
Only four labels in the music industry bruh
All radio controlled by two companies
Just two rap magazines, read between the lines
Hip-hop used to be the expression of struggle with rhymes
Corporate monopolized, only certain shit shines
Only way to get radio and video and blow
They control what you say, and the images you show
CNN owned by AOL, own Time Warner
Trickle down effect of the New World Order
And you wonder why "Van Gogh" was killed
Same reason Dead Prez lost they deal, get real
I spit for the cabbage, grind with a mission
And put Capitol Records in missionary positions
Used to love H.E.R. like Common, but then you get signed
(Behind the Music) now I just fuck the music from behind

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Magazine writers misprint you, take words out of context
And got the nerve to wonder why I'm vexed
When I read the publication
I was like "Damn, was we in the same conversation?"
This for the rap conniseurs, magazine critics
Backpackers, rap stars with bullshit gimmicks
Fans, even the "Stans," the groupies and label executives
With corporate cards trickin my budget on coochie
Video chicks sucking dick between takes
Hoping to get saved, and thanks for the ass shake
Like Dave Chappelle in "Half Baked," need a backyotomy
And some of these thugs is into sodomy
Large print giveth, fine print taketh away
Your favorite rapper ain't recoup label take it away
Have a nigga tempted to take an AK, goin postal
Rap made me loco, hustle bicoastal
(Why?) Because the West monopolize
Same ol' niggas tellin the same ol' lies
L.A. radio, quick to suck out of town dick
South support they own create international hits
Out of regional records, East coast create the buzz
Music capitol of the world, thought it wasn't when it was
And somehow manage to screw us
Call West coast gangster rap whack, then sold it back to us...[Verse 1]
Wednesday afternoon, got a call at 12 o'clock
That on Billboard, on Beat Tracks, Tyrese just dropped
From #1 to #2
He said "guess who debuted at number 1?" You!
Dream come true, owner of my record label
Congratulating the money I'm about to be making
Ask me to come in at 4:10
Had an icy chain with my name and a 600 Benz
All about the Benjamins
BBS, I'm up to 30,000 spins
Publicist told me Spin Magazine want to do an interview at Endoscene tonight
Overnight superstar, the spotlight
Eating dinner next to Tom Cruise
Getting props from Trackmasters to Ja Rule
In between some bomb fool
Baby momma acting mad cool
Used to act a goddamn fool
Like there ain't no future in this rap shit
Now she begging for backstage passes to Summer Jam
I laugh, people in the streets coming up for autographs
Women seem to offer me ass

[Hook]
Number one!

[Verse 2]
At the club, I got in free, sat in VIP
Where celebs hang out, DJ shouting my name out
Now I know how the rich stay rich
Cause everybody and they mommas steady givin' them shit
I got a free ?, Mega Denim, Tommy jeans
And they all want me to do photo ads in magazines
Went from the BET video to big features in Vibe and Rolling Stone
Get the cover of the Source, they gave me three mics just last issue
I'm realizing the plot, ain't nobody gonna diss you
Shit is rolling, went from 5Gs to 20Gs
The show is still growing, atoms still blowing
I'm on the road hoing
The ladies love me
I even fucked a couple of bitches that used to call me ugly
Performances packed from front to back
Latin, Anglo-Saxon, Asian, and Black
Getting 25Gs a verse now
Every R&B singer with a remix paying the fee, shit
Rappers want cameos, 17 a flow
Movie soundtracks going 50 out the door

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Since I'm so major
The label put down on a two-story house and a two-way pager
Suggested a more powerful attorney, ? Weiss
Handled Backstreet Boys, 2Pac, and Barry White
Need a new accountant: Ben Jones
New manager: my momma
Two bodyguards in case niggas start drama
Used to ride coach, now I fly first class
Weeks at the Four Seasons, all my bitches be bad
Everything's great
Fort Lauderdale, hosting MTV Spring Break
Niggas hate but kiss ass when they see me
Toured the US and UK, went from France to Fiji
Every guest appearance I do feature my name first in their advertisement
Motivation to buy it
And every cameo, seem like that turn into that nigga's video
Time to start saying no
Sick of rappers using my name to blow
Sick of execs using my fame to blow
Plus, before I was hot, most of them never even spoke to me before
I got 2 million units sold
Album number 2, $900,000 advance
Million dollar recording budget, man
Sprite commercials, video directed by Hype
Offer to role in that new move from Spike
Bleach my teeth white, body like D'Angelo
Slow down my flow, gonna be a sex symbol
R&B gangster, got the formula locked
Sing on the hook cause we taking it pop
Produced by Teddy Riley, featuring Lil Kim
Got dissed by Eminem, said I dress real feminine
First week out, did real low numbers
40,000 units, next week it went under
By the third week, considered a flop
Owner ain't returning my calls, man I got drops
I'm number BOO[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I been drinking all day long rolling out with a box of songs
Welcome to the terror dome bitch
Always knew I was destined to go on
For so long everything feelin so wrong they been telling me to go strong
And flow on and so on and so on
And so on
In a city so magic where we all got vicious habits
This life will turn a baptist into an average addict
It's So tragic but I love me some 3 0 fifth
Where you go for the weekend come back home and they telling you to plead the fifth
Lambos rent out for like 7 days
Go hard like Rambo then come back and exchange for the Chevrolet
You want sunshine we gotta bit of that and ass to match
First time I was on the beach I nearly fell to my knees had an asthma attack
Here in the city we pride in the best of nightlife
You got curfews we got work through to the morning we seeing the bright lights
And that's an everyday thang
Round here it's reg-u-lar
To leave out with an exit scar
Face down in the best of bars
Somebody pick up my tab I'll get ya the next time
You know I'm good for it you know what it is Wreks mind
I gotta have it I'm foaming out of the mouth I'm rabid
I could let the whole world just vanish in a city so magic

[Hook]
And it seems like magic
Black Magic City
And it seems like magic
Black Magic City
And it seems like magic
Black Magic City
And it seems like magic
Do you believe in sex drugs rock and roll all in my black magic city

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
It's LAX lavish latins and blacks ratchet
Pale bitches tanning on beaches
And that's that Kate Blanchet
Police copters chase dope dealers and that's traffic
Pornographic stars strut in starbucks
It's that classic
Bright lights luxe cars
These chicks don't date regular dudes
They only fuck stars
Top model pop bottle
Casting couches i love her
Prettiest girls in America
Come her to get discovered
Some get discouraged quit bar tending
And start stripping
Beverly hills mansion party that's where they start sniffing
My city quake halos and volcanos
St. monica st. pedro
We lost angels
Coked up rich kids corporate big wigs
Movie producers and actors
She from a small town with them tractors
So now she ain't trying to go backwards
We on red carpets with the athletes
And them pop stars and them rappers
We like vip in them backseats papparazzi follow with cameras
She got a nose job and them new lips and them huge tits do attract ya
Had no ass took kadashian
Got back like abracadabra
See the celtics believed that the holly tree had magical properties
Bad or good
So witches made magic wands out of holly
And that's why our city named Hollywood

[Hook][Verse 1]
Like sand through an hourglass
I sift through the past
In retrospect
And recollect
The circumstances
Creating Ras Kass meiosis
X Y genes, create the male human being
Like Jeru Damaja, I come clean
2 point 5 million years ago
My dna through
All my ancestors make me who I am today
And to my predecessors I paved the way
No time to eat swine
Standing on the county line
Hey, despite we endorsing this family fuedin
Domestic disputes
Your peeps mad as Alfred E. Neuman
And it took me some more time to see
When ain't nobody got your back you always got your family
So to me yo
You served that crack head bastard over your kin, you violatin
Just cos a nigga makes kids, doesnt make him a man or father
Who loves ya baby

[Hook]
Blood is thicker than water
Blood is thicker than water
Blood is thicker than water
Son, blood is thicker than water
From my grandmomma to my lil daughter
Son, blood is thicker than water
Blood is thicker than water
Blood is thicker than water
Son, blood is thicker than water
From my grandmomma to my lil daughter
And I, I never put a ho before the homies, nigga

[Verse 2]
Seems like a short while ago
Me and byrd swore to god, we'd never stop playing with g I joe
Now we play with h, o, e' s's
Women with big breasts's's
And niggas compete to bag the freshest bitch
But brothers stay true thru thick and thin..
Clocked a major, knew all it really takes is a few good men
But couldn't stand the rain
After the pain of betrayal goes away
You learn a nigga ain't ur homey just because he knows your slave name
Lemont Le-Dale, Curtis Bryan and Jason Terrents
Revealed like a mason, but got
326 and 2 3rd more degrees
All you brothers got love like you was part of my family tree
Im not anti-white but I'm pro black as hell
Gotta save myself first
My family and my race before I save some god damn whales
Let it surge through my veins like lava

[Hook]
