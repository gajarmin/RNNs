[Produced by Eminem]

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
Too young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bomb cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jello cause

[Hook]

[Outro]
Shady Aftermath, nigga, G-Unit
Rap juggernauts of this shit, we taking over[Hook: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear your club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
And you know, but you acting like you don't know

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now homie, I say I "run it run it" cause I'm in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patron
I have you feeling aight, I get you high as a kite
Party popping, shawty says she coming with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle; you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga, you front, you gon' get it; OK, now maybe I'm sidick
Cause I want you to tridip, yeah, I be on that shidick
You should see when I'm stunting, I flash the stones to be wanting
Push the whip, see me rolling, you can tell that I'm holding
I'm just doing my thang, you know the Unit's the game
I got my grimy Shady with me
You front, you gonna have to get me
Off your ass, I pay the lawsuit and laugh
It's not a big deal, it's nothing but some cash

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Who run it?
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear your club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
And you know, but you acting like you don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is su nemesis
It's the same for him, it's just media; see, to them, it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When there's beef
You just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem, we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holding
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't coming here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you wizzass
Come hizzon, what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', J.F.K
A.K.  'til your chest plate cave
I'll ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'mma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Pussy, I survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumping in all beef
You keep talking shit now the squad called me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holding back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fucking G
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walking bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?

[Hook]

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement; you can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo[Hook: Kanye, Ryan Leslie, Kid Cudi and John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep calling (why I keep calling)
All of these girls at my shows they loving me
But I don’t know why I keep calling
Why I keep calling you

All the models to the floor right now

[Verse 1 : Kanye West]
I’m in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep, speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call, out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel to lower Stone's walls
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik
Get Olga Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too, I’m a freak boo
I’m wilding, I’m on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen

[Hook]

[Bridge : Kanye West]
Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m trying to eat out
So what we going to dinner for?

[Verse 2 : Pusha T]
Miami nights on the search for some T and A
Trying to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suits from the VMAs
Oh, you was watching? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me skip across that stage in 5 dozen EGGGHCK
Yeah, six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue style a nigga for a minute rhyme
Let's be clear and let's be fair
The best things in music’s being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still giving you it all like the coffin's near

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Ryan Leslie]
It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's the cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me Les but they all need more of me

[Verse 4 : Lloyd Banks]
Handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm
Fly clothes and Lear shows the kind of stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong and I’m puffing strong
I been locked in my way of thinking, now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talking, I’m begging the cups, c'mon
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Uh)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Prolly dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm
The world’s mine, sits pretty in my palm
Chandon as we continue on

[Hook]

[Verse 5 : Kid Cudi]
Niggas think they know only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fucking with me
How can I be better?
I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior, galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, had Elsie the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape them with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back then--let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approaching
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Do things off-beat for a living, haters copy, I'm the image
Haters copy, I'm the image[Intro: Kanye West]
What you gon do? It’s G.O.O.D. Music and G-Unit
Ugh, Banks, Loso

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen
You know they mad cause cause cause I’m hood rich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good trick
You want a problem
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Big blue, hot and sandy shoe
Cotton candy coupe
Hard knock, orphan Annie loop
Off the stoop
Play with me, see what the swammy do
My canary shoe
High beams pointed right at you, peek-a-boo
Benji paper made me hater-proof
All your family dues
Menage a trois, purple haze and goose, got me loose
Kick my way in and now I got the juice, Gucci bubble goose
Thousand kicks couple hundred boots getting fucking loot
My top down, I’m flashing on em
I’m passing all them, pullover and hit the hazards on em
The ratchets on ‘em, pay my dues, now it’s back to ballin'
Your raps are boring dead men, I dip the casket for em
I’m back performing, I bag em
Break their back, don’t call em
Look down on em like Dikembe, Patrick, Mourning
Cash is pourin’
Stunt stormin, got these bitches soaked
Camera phones capture everything that pictures don't

[Hook: Swizz Beatz] x2

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
We keep these G’s in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I’mma be at least about a hour late
I’m so fresh bitch I should be arrested
New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said “hey ‘Ye”
I said “Yes, bitch”
"Damn I’m only asking you a question"
I met this milf at the allstar getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I’m a rockstar, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas don’t take shots at us that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic’d it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I Platonic’d it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes homie I’m pajama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't paying tonight I’m only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said “It’s free”, I said WOWZERS!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz] x2

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
Ninja Kawasaki, Ducati, my old Harley
Rock the party
Move your body
Wassup, wassup
Everybody
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Wait a minute

[Ryan Leslie]
Lets get it started, get it started, get it started yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate!
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait
Where’s the dinner plates?
BMW, 10 to 8, Interstate 95, passenger
Baddest bitch in the states, half Spanish half Trinidad
Complexion Henny straight
Y’all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can’t afford to be a minute late
It’s time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning round the bezel that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess her plate's my crotch
Y'all soft as tater tot, little niggas try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the Chinese spot
I hear ‘em talking it but ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes so who gives a shit

[Hook] x2[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (x3)
My jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (x3)
This scheming don't affect me

[Bridge: Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high
More than 500 horses when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get your whole damn crew

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Get in my Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beat it I bet she let me, she been fiending since she met me
I'm the coolest shit especially when I throw on all my Gretzky
Got my Smith and Wessie to protect me so respect me
This is heavy new Bentley, color vanilla and cherry
Andretti-O Pirelli make a movie out the getty
Where my ring and my confetti, I'm Kobe Bryant ready
Pink Rose and chronic smelly while stumbling out the telly
I'm so fly, I'm so ferry and the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete, way my pencil move his deadly
Platinum band, platinum bezzie, make a straight girl outta' lezzie
Magazine, mac, benzie keep my windows like the prezzie
Press a button than I'm stunting, my roof look like it's ducking
Meter go 200 something and my trunk do when it's bumping
I am not the one for jumping I will rachet out and stump him
Dump him, your better off dead, ya money red

[Bridge: Juelz Santana/Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm always high
Got your bitch waving at me when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Whether Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, I be movin', I be movin'
Making movies Tom Cruisin' if it's action then I'm shooting
Pockets fat, necks studded, boy my nick name should be Ruben
My Columbian connect told me the Mexicans have moved it
And he know just how I get it so we bout to introduce him
Got a girl named Cigar called her that cause she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boostin', got a white girl that be boofin'
Gotta watch her cause she use it but she fuck me like she stupid
And she always ready to give me that becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club ordered bottles see the sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch lookin like the 4th of July
But if you get to frontin and the pushing lead to shoving
We just bussing and we leaving like it's nothing
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louie then it's Polo or it's Rugby
And this bitch I brought with me, she be bagging bitches for me

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Lloyd Banks]
I got a girl named Kima and Kima like Christina
Baby three don't make a crowd it make a sex scene meaner
I just wanna get between her, turn her 'to a screamer
Then it's one, two, I'm through, see ya
I scoop her in my

[Hook][Intro: Eminem]
Yeah you got me, I’m up now
It’s your loss, must suck to be you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
History is like a chord on no delay
It keeps repeating itself and what else can I say
You wondering why I act this way, never shoulda gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, ay
There musta been a gust of wind, cause you change your mind
Everytime it blows and you just changed it a motherfucking again
You just said you just wanted some dick 'fore I stuck it in
I wouldn't have been such a prick to you, fucking men
You say you don't trust 'em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushing, some shit is going down
You must have just not have been truthful from the start
See for me it’d be nothing to say you never had my heart but I’d be lying
Fucking see why they call this bullshit a relationship, ships sink
And you know it's love as soon as you fall in it cause shit stinks
And it feels like everytime I fucking do I get jinxed
Cupid must have put a curse on me
Six weeks have went by and we only spoke twice
I’m sitting in your driveway calling you from the car
Suffice I think it's safe to say you’re not at home
I’m calling your cell phone you answer but I can tell though
That you're not alone how was I to know
It shoulda been time to go a long time ago, I kept holding on
It's comical when I think back now why I couldn't get the hint
And feel the draft you were throwing I wasn't catching your drift
But there's a cold breeze blowing over me
I'm over you, success is the best revenge to pay you back
And that payment is overdue, I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shitting all over the un-sober you
And I hope they play this in every club that you going to
I’m haunting you bitch everywhere you turn I'm following you
Cause I loved you with every ounce of me, you know it's true
It's killing you now, yeah I hope the ho dies slow in you
It's cause of you now I don’t trust ‘em at all, fuck 'em, middle finger up
I’m gonna just keep grabbing my balls, cup 'em
I’ll never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up 'em
So buttercup don't try to come back knocking on my door all dolled up

[Hook]
Cause I’m moving on, don’t worry about me
Cause I’m gon' be just fine without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
Cause goddammit I’m glad that I’m me

I said if you could be where I’m at (bye bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'mma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t cause you just feel like you

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I’ve had it for the last time, your actions got me hot as my last rhyme
You’re options are leave or put out. Granted your ass fine
Fine just ain't gon' cut it
Drama is what you’re in love with, you and them bitches you run with
Lately I’m feeling smothered, you snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with cover girl motives, I gotta rise above it
You think them models loving me, I’m thinking bout who doesn’t
Doesn’t really matter what you say, sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon' be splitting, you don’t think I mean it
Left you with everything I got, fuck you, ain’t no secret
No apologies you keep it, now that I’m doing my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy, who needs it? Every rumor you hear, you go believe it
Point out the times you’ve seen it
You stabbed me should have leaned it, revenge is mine, I need it
Need a way out, It’s my fucking life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought I’d break, ain't that easy
Bet you thought I need you a million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you, ain't no freebies get your coat and go
The female Pinocchio, money hungry, hopeless ho
You fucking with my focus so go back to that chump
That played the role before love is like a cancer when you don’t let go
I’mma blow fo sho, unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don’t need you sinking us, hope you float
Lying through my teeth I hope you don’t. Drown! Drown!
Not a sound out her be dope, bottles pop out while he smoke
Hate we met, proud that we broke, let them girls crowding me go
If they got something to show, let them show me! I don't love 'em"
Never lonely, never even left a scar
You fell hard, I’m laughing, ha ha ha ha ha
Tire smoke fancy car
Nothing is what we are, no beginning no tomorrow

[Hook][Intro: Kidd Kidd]
Remember when nigga used to pay bingo? Like yo man, bingo man, that's my call for real

[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
Killers don't have no conscience, blat, won't think about it
Trap up in them houses, rats, they Mickey Mouses
Gats up in their trousers
Ma came in and gave me a slap
Said she found all that crack under her couches
I can't sleep, Fred Kruger in my dreams
Call niggas a machines, all ya'll work for me
And I'd rather work a triple beam than at Burger King
Rob you for your bling bling, give me all your ching ching
Flip your pockets from your jeans, make sure I got everything
Before I leave, life's a bitch, and we just havin' a fling
Man this chrome is like a phone, better answer it when it rings
Let it ring 'til it click, empty clip
You can smell me and see I've been through some shit
With my clique
M-Zone, Rida Gang, now these hoes gon' ride the dick
It's because of street fame these bitches know what it is
They gone say I'm doing my thing when I pull up in that six
Lord knows

[Hook x2: Kidd Kidd + (50 Cent)]
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz, big body Benz
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz, big body Benz
(And a clean set of rims)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Pushin' coke and bought them Regals and them large DeVilles
Then they got them vapor bitches, I'm like this for real?
Me, I want that big Benz with the emblem in the grill
Start packin' the steel, lettin' niggas know the deal
I want that shit so bad, start thinkin' 'who I got to kill?'
That's how a nigga feel when we out there in the field
That Glock was pumpin', paper comin', how can niggas chill?
Barrel link manage gold teeth, put gold all in my grill
Shoot out shit, I rob your bitch, I use her as a shield
Shit look at the wheels, whooo, look at the wheels
Chrome two piece Lorenzos got me lookin' like a mil
Peace called, if you wanna talk then later we can build

[Hook x2: Kidd Kidd + (50 Cent)]
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz, big body Benz
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz, big body Benz
(And a clean set of rims)

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Sittin' back in my new AMG, smokin' with 2 thou' 15
Golden wrist, few pounds of green
Park this shit, shoot down your teams
Now it seems, oh so clear through Beams
Flow so dope, I lean
Fuck you mean? Lucky that you breathe
Choke the leaf
Focus through my new designer lens
Tell her not her friends
Beaucoup dollars spent, new jewels line 'em in
Too cool time to win, I'm on top again
You gon' chop me off and 'scuse me out?
Bullshit you about, front, them Rugers out
Face the sword, no risk, no reward
Peace talk won't go nowhere, gets ignored
Price you can't afford, white man at your courts
Get you more, right here like before
Seen it all my life shit end like this
Come back filthy rich, still not guilty, bitch

[Hook x2: Kidd Kidd + (50 Cent)]
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz, big body Benz
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz, big body Benz
(And a clean set of rims)

It's all about feedin' the fam, man. Straight up and down, so we gon' do whatever it takes to get it[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Wordplay in the worst way
Earthquake, niggas is shook, ash in my purp tray
20′s on Benz day, Lincoln on Thursday
Highday, full fever leaving off the driveway
Cheeba got my mind grey, diva bottle entree
Cooler than a cooler, armed like a padre
Ya baby momma dream about the God
I let her hit the button fingers startin up the car
Style when I sleep, slicker when I hit the street
Greens pillin' up, body builder when I lift the beat
My weed sour my bitches sweet
Marine style but my shit discrete
Watch me make the flip repeat
I don't trick or treat, but so halloween
Michael myers with the fire trip holla scream
I gotta lotta cream, and a solid team
It's like I'm playin solitare
I don't see a challenge here, yeaaah

[Hook]
Money movin on the dime
Ready 1…2…3 grind
Niggas better give me mine
About my funds, top down
Ready for the shine
Gettin to it so inline
I'm influenced by the gold
I do it if I tried
I'mma get 'em every time
Ready 1…2…3…grind!

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
You know there's rules that you following
And tools get the hollow point
Poppin' at these fools
These dudes get their narrow ass deceased
I terminate, unleash the purly gate
Put that work in than I spin like a 38
All around the world, back around the world twice
Fucking with the internash infamous paradigm
Catch your bitch on the line at the concert
I'm gonna take advantage of this opportunity time
I'm the worst of the worst, vultures
Come on slime, you ain't never in your life never life like mine
This is grand theft audio, you just a petty crime
In my parade of hits, get confetti on my shine
You soft like spaghetti, I'm harder than a whale dick
Clap a nigga real quick, falling outta line like
1 2 3 they will be dropping like Dominoes, vamonos
I show you how to die, it's career suicide must be on that crack high
Coming at me diagonally, the fuck you on your mind fuck be on you niggas brains
It seems you wish death
Yo blow, these niggas playin' games ready for flesh

[Hook]
Money movin on the dime
Ready 1…2…3 grind
Niggas better give me mine
About my funds, top down
Ready for the shine
Gettin to it so inline
I'm influenced by the gold
I do it if I tried
I'mma get 'em every time
Ready 1…2…3…grind!

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Big chain photo, still beaming when you see me
HFM in 3D, hood beemer bump my CD
I'mma a creep, do some foul shit every week
Fuck my shawty sister, left her lipstick all in my sheets
Stay low I'm on that numb shit, hit and bounce shit
I'm looking for a minaj they looking for a sponsor
Opposite of bubblegum rap, I chew the track
All 4 of my pockets fat, Like New York city rat
Brighter than my jewelery I'm in line with the stars
I'm from Mars, I'm bad stacking Domino broads
Living large, you gon need 500 bars
When we drive, make bouji bitches climb in the cars
Wheels spin the street off, Porsche peel with the feet off
The haters still hating it ain't hard to tell that he lost
In need of defrost, brick ? this shit old
Play with me get hospitaled or wife widowed

[Hook]
Money movin on the dime
Ready 1…2…3 grind
Niggas better give me mine
About my funds, top down
Ready for the shine
Gettin to it so inline
I'm influenced by the gold
I do it if I tried
I'mma get 'em every time
Ready 1…2…3…grind![Biggie sample - in the background throughout the song]
"19- 1970 Somethin'."

Yeah!
GGG-GGG! {"ROTTEN APPLE"...}
YEAH!
Uh-huh! {JULY!}
Yeah!
Yeahh

1970 Somethin' - my momz and my popz met (yeah!)
Shit was different and I ain' even drop yet. (uh!)
Years past with a birth of a lil' star (yeah!)
A product of the weed and a bar. (whooo!) {Whooooo!}
Predicted a bad seed by far (uh-huh!)
Now the kids run up and see my car. (yeah!)
I can probably make it fly if I try
Blowin' the lye in the sky when I'm high till I die
In the ride with a .9 on my side [gun cocks]
Let my tombstone read. - I try full of pride. (pride!)
I got a whole lotta dough to get (yeah!)
I am a roller shit! (yeah!) - Captain I control the ship. (uh!) {Whooo!}
A nigga flow like mine he stole this shit, (yeah!)
He sold a few records before he noticed it. (yeah!)
Ma, I can do this in my sleep (uh!)
I skip through the beat hand gripped on the heat. (damn!) [gunshot] {SHIT!}
I'm doin' all this for the niggas that passed
Ball out a tree everyday like it last
Cause bullets ain't got no names, jus' targets (yeah!)
They leave brains with stains on carpets. {SHADY! }
The drama gonna go down regardless
These niggas ready for the showdown they Heartless. (uh-huh!)
Uh - I murdered niggas from the intro [gunshot]
From the switch make the Six-Four Endo. {DAMN!} (whoo!)
Now it's 2006! (yeah!)
I got a brand new house in the cliffs
That's why I walk around in my slips
With a bitch! - I only keep her around for her lips

Yeah! {REEF GOTTA! }
"Rotten Apple"

"MO MONEY IN THE BANK... PART 4"!
GET BACK! [echoes] [beat fades out](*Starts off with the beat of Tweet's "Call Me,"
Then changes over to Bubba Sparxxx & Jadakiss' "They Ain't Ready")

[Intro - 50 Cent talking]
Uh, yeah, G-Unit, uh, yeah 50 Cent, uh, yo

[Chorus 1 - 50 Cent, imitating Timbaland]
Timbaland sounds so good, but I might not be ready
I don't know
If I spend a 100 grand on the beat, then we done bumped already
Now here we go

(*harmonizing over the beat - doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo) (Pee Wee Herman)
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(Niggas look down to Pee Wee Herman)

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
50, lefty, no gun in my right palm
Bronx niggas love me, like they think our mics on (WOO)
These rap niggas not like me, they too soft (yeah)
Get shot down, I get up, shakin' shit off
You know white collar crooks, do jokes on lap tops (uh huh)
Real niggas snatch Glocks, and run up in spots
We can talk Trump talk, real estate, stocks, and bonds
Or gangsta shit, my Rugers and Glocks in palm (uh huh)
Danger, ring the alarm, kiss the ring of the Don
I conquer like Genghis Kahn, I said song in this song (god damn)
I won't hesitate to put a knife or a slug in you
And watch you bleed out, that little bit of thug in you
You don't want to bump heads with me, and get hit up
You, you ain't got what it takes to fuckin' get up
Holla niggas names on records, that shit is played out
But holla mine in your next line, and get layed out

[50 Cent - Chorus 2]
My jewels look so good, and my chain is so heavy
I don't know
If I should stunt for these hoes again, cause I did that already
Now here we go

[Lloyd Banks - Verse 2]
(Lloyd Banks) I don't give a fuck if your favorite rapper dies, to me thats my spot
I'll celebrate his burial and eat at IHOP (yeah)
I've been hungry since a little nigga weed in my high top (Woo)
Face burgundy red, in need of a eye drop (uh huh)
I had the black Delta Force, blue in the front
Back when Jordan was flyin', and Ewing could dunk
Of course, you can fuck now, you was buyin' the shrimp then
Me on the other hand, Don Bishop and Pimp King
(*harmonizing of "doo, doo" plays in backgroud until G-Unit is yelled)
I'm runnin' from a digital Munster
I do this for the hood and every kid in a dumpster
My name is poppin', and I ain't been at it long
My neck's 16, and made Flex drop a Benz latin bomb (G-UNIT!)
I'm the best thing to happen to hip hop
Since (uh huh) "Life After Death" and that 2Pac shit drop
I'm even good to a white boy with a slick top
Stuck up in the mountains with a gun and the wrist pop
Who? where?, Master P says our watch don't tick tock
I'm cleanin' out my 6 shot, watchin' the Knicks flop
Damn near the whole damn passenger green
Thats how my bedroom, look like the World Trade after the scene (smoking)
Breaking news, hijack, bus passenger scream (yeah)
I'm your worst nightmare, I crush half of your team
To me your line up is pussy, three wet Pampers
The uzi will have you shakin' like them G-Dep dancers (damn dude)

(*50 Cent - harmonizing "doo,doo,doo"*]

*beat stops

[Lloyd Banks]
What the fuck happen to the rest of the beat man?

(50 Cent laughing)[Intro: Lloyd Banks]
The name's Banks; the Boy-Wonder Man
Stack in the rubberband; gat in the other hand

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
These little niggas don't move me; go watch a movie
I'm too smooth; white Prada shoes with the Dooey
I spin your fuckin' neck when I speed the through; the ceilin' is see-through
Oh, you top-billin'? Well, me too
You might as well give your money to me, shorty
Can't dance in the strip club when you're forty
Come here; I'll show you how to get, it if you with it
If you let me, I can teach you how to take it to the top
A bottle of Cris later, you'll be naked in the spot
Gassed up from the conversation in the drop
It won't be gifts or vacations to the trops
Just hard-dick bubble gum, and steak up in the pot
I got a brand new semi out the box
Just in case a nigga think he smooth enough to sneak in
Leave you one eye shorter from the slaughter
And I'll be on the yacht 'round water out in Florida
Fuck the talkin', what's up? Your hammers in the truck, you butt, so chill
Or I'mma have to fuck, you up, for real
Cristal bottle in your grill; ew
It'll be a ground full of glass, teeth, and blood spill
They all know I'm a threat hoppin' out the Lex
I got a bitch for every letter in the alphabet
Like [?] and Brandy, Carrie and Donna
Erica and Felicia, I nicknamed her "Gabbana"
Light-skinned Heather, I met her around the way
And there's a few names that I ain't supposed to say
So I'mma skip to J, cause Jasmine and Jennifer
Jaw-bonin' Jessica runs when I message her
They all know when it come to the hoes
I get 'em down to they underclothes, in them bungalows
Nah, I don't need an umbrella, the car come with those
To get in one of those, you need a hundred shows
I'm all summer-froze, so the gun exposed
I'll gun butt ya fucker, here's a bloody nose
Yeah, that was yo' bitch, but the dummy chose
Yeah, I'm grimy as fuck, you got to love it, though
Shorty caught feelings after I stroked her, so what?
Take a picture, write a book, call Oprah; blow up
You'll find a ice-pick in a flow
In Coke-colored coupe, white whip in the snow
Me and the bread bandin' like a pimp and a ho
Like a smoker on the pipe, like the coca on the flight
I don't continue nothin', I'mma stroke her on the night
On the sofa or the floor, whore chokin' off the mic
Like, "Banks, I don't usually do"; well they usually do
And they all learn to like it, you'll get used to it, too
Niggas starin' at my chain, cause it used to be blue
Man, I ain't changed like you; deuce-deuce in the shoe
I'm on Kush, cranberry juice, Goose, and I'm through
Then it's back to the mansion to do what I do
I'm back nigga; this is part two: The Hunger For More Money
I'm right at your door, dummy
Kush pop, bottoms up; nigga I'm by the buck
Don't look at the Ferrari, you can't even buy the truck
That boy fresh out the hood, and he hot as fuck
On the hunt for the cheese, keep your Ricotta tucked
They on that body shit, right in the lobby shit
Run up in my yard, and runnin' out with the shotty shit
Family members identifyin' the body shit
Cause it been so long, that John Gotti shit
I'm in the two-zero-zero Maserati whip
Concrete-colored McLaren; it's a hobby, shit![Intro:]
COME ON!
"5 AND BETTER"! [scream]
"RETURN... OF THE PLK"! [gunshot]

[Chorus 1: {DJ Whoo Kid}]
We heavy on the hydro, and heavy on the hip!
Speeding by I'm like Angaledy on my shit
'0-8 Gallardo, man I hollow niggas up
Bottle after bottle models follow in the truck! - What? [car tires squeal] {Whooooooo!}

[Verse:]
The hood miss the champion, cause everybody dancing an'
These bi-polar niggas keep talking until you answer them
Somebodies amping 'em! - I fuck around and trample 'em
Squash 'em by accident, I'll never shake your hand again! [gunshot]
Shopping off the manakin' - dropping 20 grand again
Copping while they srcambling, I make it back gambling
Your girl look like a gremlin' - and mine look like a dime on
Stilleto or a Timb'land - she'll pop up on your mind! {LLOYD BANK$!}
Mind your own fucking bidness don't get nosey, it get hurt!
Burried holy in the dirt from a word over the chirp
I'm nothing like these other niggas all my clothes fit
And I don't walk around wearing bags like a chick!
Niggas talking birds, ain't never seen A BRICK!
You either down or YOU NOT - ain't no in between this shit. {HAHA!}
If you learn to be respectful I might let you clean the whip
And get nose bleed tickets to the show you fucking prick. {Whooooooooooooooooooooooooooo}
And my cake bigger! - I'm a "718 Nigga" {Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid!}
You a snake, nigga! - One foot over the gate, nigga!
Just wait nigga! - Cowards don't last long, get blast on
Bloody face; all over the mask on, your ass gone. {DAMN!} [shot]
Don't come through here without your pass on they
Throwing "2 G's Up" - so you ain't got to ask 'em!
All these niggas want nice things, Bentleys and Ranged out
Man, I ain't seen Lupe with his board since he came out. {MONEY WRONG!}
I bet he traded that in for some wheels [police sirens]
Cause his ships change every couple years and they I'll! [police sirens]
It might not be nessaccery, that's just how I feel [police sirens]
Nigga you don't like me die slow - pop a pill! [gunshot]
You ain't got a career, just cause you got a deal
Half of these niggas told they'll come out and never will
On the real! - These cupcake niggas know the deal
My goons give out the wounds, you ain't wanna feel!

[Chorus 2:]
We heavy on the dollars and heavy on the clips
Riding through Manhattan all black and on piff
All black Ferrari and I'm prob'ly with your bitch
Nothing on my mind more than how to get rich!

[Chorus 1:]
We heavy on the hydro, and heavy on the hip!
Speeding by I'm like Angaledy on my shit. [car tires squeal]
'0-8 Gallardo, man I hollow niggas up!
Bottle after bottle, models follow in the truck! - What? [gunshot]

[Outro:]
THISIS50-... dot-COM! [beat fades out][50 Cent]
Yeah.. 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo
G-UNIT!

[Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part of my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right
To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'
Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggas rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money
You lyin' your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin' your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!)
I'm wide awake but it still feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death waits for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through Mama bitchin' in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, Papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards

[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggas hate when you do good
But when you broke, your friends and your enemies
They love you, they love you
"Chi Chi, get the yayo"
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
"Chi Chi, get the yayo"
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!)
You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country
Wallstreet niggas, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustling backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you moving forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
...In PA all day, on the corner of Third

[50 Cent]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you
The shells hit you, you screamin'
Think I'm playin'? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols
Lets get it poppin'
Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon)
Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like "50 nice chain"
Belagio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga you see me!
I wonder if you mad, cause I'm doin' good
Or cause niggas feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood
And it hurts cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
Cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat
You pussy

Yeah, explain it to niggas in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga
Niggas know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
Pussy, lets get it poppin'

G-G-Unit, G-G-Unit, G-G-G-Unit, G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit, G-Unit![Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
You'll never find another nigga with a flow like this
I got 99 lines to break a ho down with
A red beam in the club'll make the whole crowd shit
I got the grizzlys on me like Stronoun Swift
40 blue vest on me cause I took some once
Round here its like that even the shook ones dump
Bandana on my neck in case I do something dumb
Cause a motherfucker will tell the blue where I'm from
When I slide through the spot hoes huggin' and stare
Rocks glare
Like I got a lightning bulb in my ear
I got a zip of that Gueedo bud
And the fifth that'll drop a mean old slug
Directly in ya sunroof you'll see no blood
Just a big bright light like you've been hit by Mike
If I see something I like
I'm a get about three
Cause if it ain't about money then it ain't about me

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Nigga you should move the way that we move
Keep ya pistol on you everywhere you ride
The sooner you realize the sooner you'll see
You don't wanna bump into a nigga like me
Maybe you should roll the way that we roll
Keep ya gun on ya everywhere you go
The sooner you realize the sooner you'll see
You don't wanna bump into a nigga like me

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
These niggas all grown up and they still frontin'
Which means every nigga with a tear drop ain't kill something
The system in the trunk got the track and the grill thumpin'
Yayo on my right I'm in the back of the wheel stuntin'
Bitches know I'm only tryin to fuck and they still jumpin'
Niggas know I got the 40 on me and will dump 'em
I'm probably 'gon retire on pay day with two cribs
The same all from the Kay Slays and Whoo Kids
You wanna know I bring AKs where you live
One in ya stomach'll vacate a few ribs
Dog I'm focused so even if I slip off beat I'm right back on before ya notice
Niggas is broke
We pass 'em in the big body Rovers
Rap fiends my sixteens is Coke for ya noses
I don't argue with bitches that only adds me stress
I toss a bitch out the mansion like she Jazzy Jeff

[Hook][Intro: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah... G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
Uh, Yeah, 'Ey, 'Ey...

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
I think I gotta have it
And it keeps pullin' me in like a magnet
Goin' with this kinda music puts me right back on the block
It's like crack to an addict
It ain't too hard for me to grab it
Goin' with this kinda music puts me right back on the block

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Man, I think I'm addicted
To the life that I had, so I risk it
Runnin' the street with the heat more
Three deep in the SUV
The bigger you blow, the less you see
The more you hear
A real nigga lost his life right there
It's hard to believe a flip is the reason he's not here
Damn, and still get killed over somethin' that ain't his
And jeopardize the well being of him and his kids
That's how it is, Cig's in the whole crib
Dope that told pigs, live with broke ribs
Or went and got a dirt with the worms
With the result of the codes, packed funeral homes
You know the names, cause we tattoo in the morn'
I'm gone, just cruisin' back to in the morgue
So front rap, we comin' at to you with a song
When you hear that, {*Reload*} pointed at you and you're gone

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I got my pocket's right; my rocks are bright
The drop is blue, and the watch is white, right
That's why they watchin' me
As far as I can see, it's all mockery
And I'm tryna' be all I can be
Now that my foot's in the door, there's no stoppin' me
It's pure poetry, I got a lil' 'Pac in me
Now internationally, they jockin' me
Cause my money green and blue like Monopoly
They all left a name all around the globe
Get still Southside, I was bought up by the curb
(Southside) And I was told, everything ain't gold
It's to the glitter, they had to drain the pain with the liquor
The world don't turn, unless the money move
The early bird get the worm, and the dummies lose (True)
You hear the struggle in the grind when I talk
I breathe and I bleed New York, 'ey!

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild][Intro: Tony Yayo & Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, nigga!
We fuckin' back! Hunger for More!
Tony's Home!
Yo, Banks, I told these niggas man
(Ya'll done fucked up now)

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Ain't No click like the one I'm wit'
If the drama gets thick, it's the guns I get (Now)
G-Unit niggas is runnin' this shit (Now)
If you ain't reppin' where you from then sit (Down)
We gettin' dough everywhere we go
And it's killin' em' slow just to hear me blow (Now)
G-Unit niggas is runnin' this shit (Now)
If you ain't reppin where you from, sit down!

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
By now, I know you done seen me
On your stadium or TV, with 380 on the EV
I skeet babies on ya breezy
And I ain't' stoppin'
Only jake or Jacob could freeze me
Squeeze me, and it's bye bye gone
We got guns like Popeye's arm
I put a ring on every finger but the rats still askin'
Cause there's one on all of mine, I'm the rap Phil Jackson
I built the rep for murder on every Who Kid
Kay Slay, and Big Mike, admit it; the kid tight
And you ain't' even put up a fight, so it's back to the amateurs
Wrappin' your sandwiches, I'm hot now so the rats want to stand wit' us
They hop in the van wit' us and clap on cameras
I hit the clubs, now I'm back tourin' Canada's
Amongst weed smokers and crap-floor gamblers

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Make sure the birds don't get brought to him
I watched Kobe go from the basketball court to the courtroom
Go 'head, try to do me harm, soldier
And you'll be in a black bag like grass out the lawnmower
And I'll be damn if I co-sign a old snitch
That was gangbangin' when Jaws was a Goldfish
I've been named New York's screamin' on the street
For bullying the baseline and leanin' on the beat
I'm well known now so you see me on the creep
Schemin' on a freak, fan base leanin' on the jeep
They walkin' wit the fire
So if you say banks in you verse, Then you better be talkin' 'bout Tyra
From P.A. to L.A., Atlanta to Texas
Nashville to Memphis, my buzz is tremendous
I pass through the city slow, but hit the gas on a silly ho
Bounce like ass in my video

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
'Ey, yo
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
My click eat like the Twelve Holy Apostles
We bust down models, and plush out Tahoes
Jewels froze - look like we hit the lotto
P89; my clip filled wit' hollows
Stunt in the club - get hit wit' yellow bottles
Don't speak ma, if ya neck don't swallow
Cause 50 push Bentleys and Dre push Diablos
That Eminem money got cash in my Escrow
Scrooge McDuck stays swimmin' in my cash flow
Yay' rap is crack, and I got the best blow - best flow
Banks' put me in the booth; let's go
Think like Cestro; the games in a lasso
Jump in the Benz without snaps on the petro'
God gave me this flow, so I am special
In 16 bars, nigga, I'm finished; finito!

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
We told y'all motherfuckers, man
Ya'll niggas look like us, stunt like us, but y'all not us man!
Lloyd Banks, Hunger for More!
We back nigga!
50 the General!
Young Beezy Buck!
Game!
Rap game is ours nigga!
Hunger for More!
This is rider music, nigga!
This for them gangstas, them generals, and them comrades!
This rider music! Ha ha![Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
We in the '64, air horn blowing at my enemies
Bulletproof cap, I ain't going out like Kennedy
50 got my fanbase growing out in Tennessee
I'm getting so much head it's drawing out my energy
I'm touring now, I need enough weed to pass around
Somewhere around a half a pound of that Manhattan brown
Bitch, I'm gonna sell records, I got a platinum sound
Ranned into half the town bandana wrapped around
Nah, we ain't got no manners
And as far as the clips you know how gorillas feel about bananas
Acknowledge whenever we round
And as far as bouncing back I'm like Ben Wallace on the rebound
You still spending 10 dollars on your weed, clown
You might lose your dick, it's all kind of disease now
They ain't OG's, they grumpy, old men
Riding 'round in a chunky old Benz, nigga, those ends
I'm not the type to fall in love, make your hoes friends
I turn a friend to a ho, spend all the dough
Niggas'll start fighting by the end of the show
I got 30 niggas on stage and 10 in the row, ya know

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Get ya gun, we gon' come for you, we'll lay ya ass out
The shells hit you knees, split ya, there's blood all on your couch
Didn't think niggas would really run up in your house
Hog tying ya mutherfucking kids and ya spouse
Bitch, give us the mutherfucking money and we out
This 45th shell'll tear a fucking hole in ya blouse
Waiting for me to have a change of heart, you assed out
Kill every motherfucker up in this bitch and stamp out
Nigga, this is pressure, punks respect pressure
Catch ya stunting in something I want and I'll get ya
Go 'head ride through ya strip in your Benz on chrome
See if I won't run up in your motherfucking home
They say money make the world go 'round
I've seen my knife work, I turn a clown smile to a frown
Squeeze and watch the barrel spin on the trey pound
I'm a G-Unit gorilla, niggas know how I get down[Verse 1: Maino]
Maino hustle hard, better pray to god
I swear to god, Lames better play they part
It's going down, I run this town
I’m here now, let’s get it!
Black flag, Black tee, shooters in a black truck
Diamonds on, getting money, haters on my right nut
Left arm automa bezzle look like falling stars
Fifty shot Calico, niggas better call on God
I'm the one they fear reason why they're running scared
Do it Mob style, bullet right behind his head
I declare I'm the king of Kings County
Stand up nigga why these haters can’t down me
Look around I round the town these other niggas clowns see
Go ahead let him talk slick I bet I make his mouth bleed
Homie we strong, these rap niggas peeons
They cuddle with the same bitches I pee on
Brick getters getting bread in rainy weather
My white girl savetta and it go panamera
I’m a don bitch miss me with that nonsense
.44 holster underneath my armpit
Fuck nigga the reason to love niggas
My last homie snaked me that's why I don't trust niggas
Straight to the devil is where I took them
Fuck what you heard I run Brooklyn

[Hook]
Cooler then antifreeze dammit these rappers be
The baddest thing happening since King had a dream
Cooler then antifreeze dammit these rappers be
The baddest thing happening since King had a dream

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Can;t stop too much cream veiw me on your movie screen
Got the sweater, got the hat, sneaker, and the Gucci jeans
Sicker than I used to be, time to get them used to Queens
Flawless bitches usually turn them all into super fiens
Mamy i’m the coolest from PYT's to cougars
The haters remorse they can D-I-E from rugers
Nigga say hello to Judahs, genius how I do this
Cleanest pictures standing out of Beemers with the blue wrist
Shorty keep my name low till my name, tell honey my angle
I'm touring and she taking off her leggings on the table
Pussy popping on the Skyp, crustin' on the phone
I’ma fuck her with my freestyle going off the dome
I got her smoking weed now, she’s glowing off patron
Kush cologne, weirdo when I push my poem, cripple chrome
In my Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island, Bronx, and Brooklyn zone
And I'm Nina packing, paper staking, bitch go get your own![Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
L. Banks baby baller of the year
Got about nine, ten dimes, and all of them is here
It don't matter cause before the night is done I disappear
Tell my new one I'm leavin out of the side meet me there
Yeah, weed and bottles everywhere
Metal full of hollows I don't mind a petty stare
I don't need a favor baby I'm a millionaire
Got a show hopping out of the lair in Tanzania
You ain't getting nothing you ain't gettin money
Money make a mack more, more Henney more honeys
Hundred dollar bills, fifty dollar bills, keep the twenties
Dummy I'm a go getter, bitter, old nigga, spitter
Gold digger couldn't dig yourself a chip
Dig yourself a hole told 'em I was cold from the rip
Zero zero man need more of those in my shit
Hoes in my whip, mo' till I'm lit, I'm rich

[Hook: Lloyd] (Lloyd Banks)
Ladies, they love me, they eyes are on my money
They pay me and I stunt, and I can have any girl I want
Go shawty go shawty go x3
Go, go, go, go

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks] (Lloyd)
Uh, black Beamer, blue Benz, red Bentley
Audemar's sporter y'all, all of y'all petty
Heavy metal hanging chain, dangling on me while I'm bopping
I can see the whole crowd watching while we rocking
Copping, bottle popping, pop a cork like a sport
Hit a hater in the nose when I open my Ros'
LV's and G's all over my clothes
Bank rolls everywhere Banks goes, she ain't yours
As far as flows, mine's like an automatic
Mack 11 a dum-dum'll quiet all the static
I gotta habit, I'm fucking like an addict
Area code scattered from the way I work magic
So tragic, nigga run up on me wrong
Grown ass whipping bout 2:30 in the morn'
Cases of white brown and bottles of the Don
The chrome, chron', and girls on my arm, it's on

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lloyd]
Go shawty, let me see you go shawty
Show me all the things you do with your body
Baby this is your party, come and get this dough from me shawty

[Hook]

[Outro: Lloyd Banks]
Shorty got a thing for me
She wanna put that thing on me
Show what you got girl
Dough, I got a lot girl[Intro: 50 Cent]
G Unit
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have luck
If it wasn't for doing bad I wouldn't know about doing good
It ain't safe down here in my hood
It could be a beautiful day
And you'll get hit by strays

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
This is what you do
If a nigga stealing money out the crew
Cut eight of his fingers off and leave a nigga with two
Destinys beef its always escalate in the future
You ain't tough cause ten probably aiming to shoot ya
Puss enough to make a neighborhood bum pick up a pistol
Fill the clip up and hit you
In the face or use the pistol
All it takes is aim a nigga really tried to diss you
It's gon' be an issue
If you don't fry his tissue
What's a crack head thinking 'bout right before he takes a hit
Hell if I know probablly a whole lot of mistakes and shit
What the fuck makes a nigga want to have a relationship
When I could have a Caucasian, Spanish, or Asian chick
Nigga you could run but the lights'll beat ya
Put red dots on you like a slice of pizza
Got a groupie on my lap nigga sun roof top nigga
Chilling on the scene
With the gangsta lean

[Hook: 50 Cent]
This shit is real drama in the hood boy you better stay strapped
You need to wear a vest shit it's on like that
Niggas you think is cool'll stab you in the back
I know for a fact

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I got a Gem Star that'll open ya face
The Mac'll make you open the safe
I'm walking around with a open case
Ya'll been on my dick a long time thanks
Now I'm a introduce you to my man get 'em Banks

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
You might catch Banks in the city with that blue and gray shit
Ropes as thick as the ones they hung slaves with
Shorty ain't ya wife dog I'm blazin' after ya
Got rocks on my neck from a cave in Africa
Just bought a new bitch got beige and black in her
Police watching us like an Asian Trafficer
Go ahead front I'm dying to poke ya hater
And put a patch on your eye like an Oakland Raider
I ain't got a silencer just a Solt Potater
I seen ya wife you had to be on coke to date her
It's a problem when I get in
So if its hate in ya blood you better find a way to hold that shit in

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
I'm lying to these hoes
So if you bust in my room you'd probably catch a bitch trying to propose
From a block bang out I caught iron in my clothes
Stuck without my wratchet
Buck in my bread basket
Ear drums soft from lead to [?]
Bounce off the floor injured my leg in traffic
Headed towards the Mackland
But its hard as hell to walk a straight line when ya eyeballs doing back flips
Duck from the SK Special
Or I'm a leave ya fucking shirt looking like the ese's dressed you
It'll be a case when I catch you
I'm putting holes in ya face like a pretzel
Make jakes have to sketch you
Arm and legs'll break the same time your neck do
Throw you off a projects
For fucking with my set
I know you hate me and would like to jump me
Cause I play around acres like Michael's monkey
You ain't hurtin' me in Air Force
Cause my Nikes is comfy
Catch me out in the country
With lights and company
She can't be thirsty because all night she drunk me
See I made it convince me
She's better than Lewinski
What's the sense of holdin' on the metal if its empty?
You need shells in 'em
To leave swells in 'em
Catch Banks at the top of the globe
Pocket of dough
Rocks in the low
Lockin' and load
Cock and explode
I grew up pops and a O
Mix match socks on my sole
Cops on a stroll
Spendin' knots on my gold
I got Ns in my jeans
For Benzes and screens
Cause I take money like vending machines
I used to stick pens in my jeans
Now I got beams
That'll leave you bending with screams
Pressure turns men to Marines
King pins to pussys
And hard rocks into milk and cookies
MotherfuckersLloyd Banks in the house, bad news
Tony Yayo in the house, bad news
50 cent in the house, bad news whenever 50 around it's bad news
Trey pound's in the house, bad news
40 Kal's in the house, bad news
I got a knife in the house, bad news whenever 50 around it's bad news

[Lloyd Banks]
I think little man mad cause I'm flossin' bad
I ain't a wrestler, but I'll put your bitch the Boston crab
I talk money cause it costs to brag
Round here bitches walk around wit the hair that the horses had
Rap it get your face stuck on them bricks
I don't really like to exercise but I'll push up on a bitch
Y'all sweet like ninety-nine bananas
That's why I got ninety-nine niggas wit ninety-nine hammers
They all want a nigga to stop
Cause I rap slick enough to slip the ring off of Vivica Fox
I'm just a playa that found out what the coaches know
So I'mma be around longer than the Oprah show
You and your man y'all both should know
That all it takes is a finger to send you where the ghosts go
Shit I been hated since the fifth grade
That's why my best friend's a the tre pound, a ice pick, and a switch blade

[Hook]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Banks' back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Tony's back at it again)

[Tony Yayo]
Rule number one pick a target and study him for weeks
See where they rest at and lay with their peeps
Now you got the drop, know their daily routine
So the second rule please leave the crime scene clean
Third rule pick a day, fourth rule pick a time
Fifth rule pick a fifth, sixth rule pick a nine
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet
So when the shootout you leave him six feet deep
Eighth meet in a fast car with disguise
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
Ninth rule don't say shit cause po-po listen
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system
And the tenth rule don't put a tag on a broken heart
Just put a toe-tag on your mark
And rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend
You better watch where you heading

[Hook]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

[50 Cent]
Don't go against me I'll hurt your feelings
Stones in my cross the size of your earrings
My confidence level's high nigga can't tell
Lickin my lips at ya bitch like I'm LL
I smile like a nigga in jail receiving mail
Better yet like a nigga in the bookings that made bail
From day one I came in the game they said I was hot
They got scared, "Cent got money," and I got shot
You put pressure on me when you compare me to 'Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot
What little niggas say to 50 cent don't matter
I'll fire shots at the shepherd and watch the sheep scatter
My enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
You scared then get the fuck around me
Record execs, know not to play wit my check
I come through and put my knife on that vein in ya neck (YEAH!)

[Hook]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me

Until God calls for me I'mma keep ballin', keep on ballin'
To my niggas and my bitches looking down on me
I know y'all see me when I'm ballin'
You know I got to keep ballin'
Till the FEDs come we ballin' out
Y'all niggas y'all know what this about when I'm ballin'
That stash house, we in and out
We ballin', ballin', ballin', we shot callin'

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Versace down from my head to my neck
Pootie Tang with the belt game, show some respect
All these bitches on my dick, same, old shit
R.I.P. to Pimp C, I'm the same, old pimp
Fly over seven different time zones
I got a big booty bitch up in shroom zone
Got emergency blunts when I come home
Cause that rapper weed'll have your lungs gone
Yeah, Malibu beaches, unlaced bikini bottoms
Mo' money, mo' problems, fo' fo' will solve 'em
Just every day I'm with a stank sip, 30 in the clip
Riding through that Gaza Strip, kill a nigga quick
Hit a nigga with my race car, Tony Yayo turn to Tony Stewart
Rap niggas die over music

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Just got this brand new chopper and I'm dying to use it
Dry snitching niggas testifying in their music
I seen niggas last five minutes then they lose it
Wrap the sheet around his neck, he said, "this time I couldn't do it"
A platinum nigga in the penitentiary going, "do it"
Put Prada on the prison yard, started getting to it
Two zero's,  six, six, nine, 'o seven five
That's the number that they gave me when I arrived
It's just another form of slavery that's in disguise
To all my niggas locked up just trying to survive, I know why

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
I'm yelling money over bitches, money over everything
Money got me everything, every watch, every chain
Every brick, every whip, kicks with designer names
I used to hustle taxes, whose child I can claim
Paid all my mama's bills so how can she complain?
Call my bitches dimes, I treat 'em like loose change
Kobe Bryant in the clutch, ballin' with my ankle sprained
No love, got it out the mud, my shirt ain't got a stain
Iced out Rollie, three fingers reppin' Rida Gang
Entire streets in the streets so them hoes know I came

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Ballin' on these hoes all the time
You got your kids, don't need mine
Word to my favorite design, my mama raised me to shine
These C-notes play in my mind, they on rewind
I am top five alive, I've been picked out by God
I'm never not on my job, too hard to argue that
Shining my records like, "where's my target at?"
Came through your stereo, feel me charging back
I'm owing you 15 bombs for that
Stains in the garden, hear when they all go black
Cracks in the armor, this reach further than rap
Before we start react, mob attack
Stacks or don't call me, rain down 'til nobody standing
Won't show no snipe for your army

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, I'm here nigga
Banks, G-G-G-G, G Unit

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Now don't try to stand next to me (Right)
Cause I'm the nigga they came here to see (Right)
Ain't nothing 'round here for free (Right)
And I'm here to let these mothafuckas know
That I'll do anything for the dough (Right)
A felony walkin out the front do' (Right)
Ain't a mothafucka I gotta change fo' (Right)
Therefore I'ma be this way until I go

[Verse 1]
Guess who walk around with diamond chains and rings on 'em
A pair of throwback Jordan's, with the wings on 'em
With all this talking I'm guessing they got them things on 'em
Cause if not Milli's the Forty Cal's a ring on 'em
I know your kind getting by leave the city quick
Niggas bleed just like us, I'm on that Biggie shit
First of all I'm sup-posed to ball
I'm sup-posed to have coast to, coast to calls
And your niggas on your CD's garbage
Yeah, they shooting but they missing, spraying up the wall like graffiti artist
Some niggas by the bootleg but go and cop the real shit
Cause the fans love us I'm nicer than grandmothers
I wake up get dressed put on my tan butters
It been this way since Puma's and Super Man cover's
A ice pick could do your liver harm
And have you screaming in the back of the club louder than Lil' Jon

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You now looking at the hood meal ticket seven thou on my wrist
It's kinda hard to keep the balance with this, it keeps the challengers pissed
I vacate to different islands and twist
And back home where the violence exist, now silencers fixed
You buy mileage as gifts as well as man's best friend
And I don't own no rottweillers and pits
It's getting extremely hard for the man to roam
With little kids putting this picture on the camera phone
Shit change now that the cameras on
A bitch will jeopardize the marriage to fuck you when they man is gone
These niggas rambling on about the paper that they getting stop it
I got more money than you in my little pocket
Yeah, I'm stingy so it's stretch long, with G-Unit sweats on
Thread needle to Teflon, Des' Eagle and vest on
Cause everybody ain't enthused
That's your name's around about good news, fuck you!

[Hook][Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]

Man, ya all know my name
B-A-N-K, Dollar sign, click-clack
The young gorilla out the clicks back
G-Unit's runnin' this shh..PAP!
As a matter of fact, its more then rap
You better stay with your gat (AHH)
These...white and black
How you feel about that?
I'm too familiar where I'm at
Can't run around with no rat
Whenever I sex I'm strapped
And stay away from the clack
You know the clack, you get from rollin' round in the set
I be slipping' niggas stuck in the trap
Runnin' and duckin' the MAC
Nigs..Niggas must be touching' that crack (Yup)
And I'm flossin' every chance that I get
Walk around with your advance on my neck
Im demandin' respect!
I hop out the coup, land in the jet
Hoes can't keep they hands off my sweats, G-UNIT!

[50 Cent]

(HAHA! I walk around with your advance on my neck)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]

Tired of waiting
These industry niggas starting to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts
While stompin' em out ya mans
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you grew up
Pull a shotgun up out the van and
They see me pop up all icy cause I could
But you been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood
Cause when you paranoid, its hard to make a song
How you want it with me?
Half of ya artists got make up on
Every night...you on ya knees taking taking prayer pictures
And you ain't even get shot yet
You scared bitches
You don't know nothing 'bout what pain is sucker
I'll put your team underground like a train conductor[Intro: 50 Cent, (The Notorious B.I.G.), [DJ Whoo Kid]]
{*gunshot*}
{*gunshot*}
(One)
(One, two)
[Non-stop]
(Yo, check me out right here yo)

Yo
Yo, we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan, then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more hoes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around with them pounds and Berettas
Yeah faggot, if I want it, I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me, or I got to grab it
Don't make a ass out of yourself trying to stop me
I'm cocky, rap's Rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, eight levels above you nigga
I'll plug you nigga, I never heard of you nigga
Ugly nigga, I'm the wrong one to provoke
You ratting on niggas is only going to leave you smoked
So the only thing left now, is toasts for these cowards
I got no friends; fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit; 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars; they lay around flowers

[50 Bars of Pleasure by Lloyd Banks]
I got a industry gangstress, that argues, and steams the reefer
And flip when I call her bitch, like she Queen Latifah
Now all the vehicles is long enough to stash the street sweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
I'm sliding through the raucous, with Prada on the chuckers
So the spring break hoes home from college want to fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckers
I sic Rottweilers on you fuckers
Cops following to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lot of zeros
When it come to paper, I blow the soul out a hero
I'mma break before I lay in the floor buried, besides
Every rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, we're smoking by the big screen
Changing the channel, looks like I'm playing the Game Boy
I know the watch bothering your vision
But reach, and I put a dot on your head
Like it's part of your religion
Why party with a pigeon? I'm blowing a ten
Because Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison
I'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
But it ain't a problem getting dressed
Because my closet got more aisles than Pathmark
Run when we starting a raid
Or leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs
I'm a young pimp, pardon my age
I don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids
Niggas find out what club they at, take them with us
And run trains on them, like a subway map
Your advance is a grey Acura
See these record labels got most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper
I go to college on the tour
I'm goin down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
Keep your ammo clean, Tech's polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hampers that monitor the floor
By now, you probably heard of me
Fresh out of surgery, flashy as a fuck, you going to have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy, white T: burgundy
You match now, back down
Niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
Catch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear
Heavy when I tote, C-notes from different years
Bezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher
You're better off with the stupid guys, looking for a coupe to drive
You ain't gettin' nuttin', but you french fries supersized
It's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio laying my vocals, nigga

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere
You going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life
And your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you
Something positive, alright:
Well, I ain't going to lie to you motherfucker;
You ain't going nowhere
Get yourself a beer, and get on the fucking curb {*gunshot*}
Fucking dirtbag {*gunshot*}[Hook: 50 Cent]
I hear a lotta talkin' - niggas must be mad at BANKS
But there's only one problem - niggas ain't as bad as BANKS
Nigga yous front, you gon get shot down
We fend to pump crack at cho spot now, G-Unit

[Verse: Lloyd Banks] + (50 Cent IN CAPS)
These niggas don't really want war (nah)

Why you think the long pump is in the trunk for (yea)
If you really want somethin we can show up at your front door

Fuck livin positive, cause negativity spreads faster
A celebrity has ta, bulletproof his car
Cause big heads come flyin through ya door like Casper (WOO)
I'm smokin out the jar (jar) scopin out the bar
Distracted see shorty breast pokin out the bra (uh-huh)
Not the type to go spark metal and
Stop thinkin you gangsta cause you hit a park yellow van (yea)
Act hard but ya heart made a marshmellows man
Talk tough, til you get cuffed and start tellin damn
Everyday I got a new bitch and when I'm done wit her
It'll look like she dived head first into cool whip (GOD DAMN)
You only gon wind up dead tryin to prove shit
I put chalk around ya head like a pool stick (yea)
I gotta have bucks on the waist
I'm hungry like a south african with flies stuck to his face( WAA)
Catch Banks in a truck full of bass (uh-huh)
Remember I'm a batchelor, the 4 or 5 ducks outta space
You could either get bucked or get ya ass jumped
The only trigger you touch is on a gas pump
I got my own personal slave she really got a curfew
Cook and clean for the kid like Celie in color purple (UH-HUH UH-HUH)
I know you wanna pop me but (but)
If I hit you first, the exit wound gon be the size of a hockey puck (AHH)
Fuck, I really hold the rubber
I send +Sparks+ at you and I don't mean Emilio or Bubba
I'm aimin for a video or cover, huge tour buses
A pound and a philly hold the smuggler
G=Unit's whats up right now
The Gucci cloth is on a newport sign upsidedown
You gotta come a little harder, nigga
You wear jerseys while mine a throwback and yours is a Starter(HA HA HA)
You still gotta beg a ho (ho)
And you mad cause you blowin on oregano
You niggas'll never blow
Anyone to step in my ring is brave
I don't know a thing about hair stylin but I can make a finger weave (ERR)
Short stay leave her butt in the telly
Lace up the beef and brocclis peanut butter and jelly
I'm about to get this deal (uh-huh) shorty know
Thats why she foamin out the grill like a Alka-Seltzer pill
I ain't loud around a snitch (nah)
I don't crowd around a bitch (nah)
The jumpsuit match wit the Carolina kicks
I been sick since niggas was on Harlod Miner dick
I could call up a chick and put a child around her lips (WOO)
Niggas can't stand the fact that I'm real
I kidnap the Queen from the castle and put her back on the pill
Gimme Barbie at her best (UH-HUH)
Bacardi at the chest(UH-HUH)
I'm similar to the young Marcus Garvy at the desk
Useta have ta push up, now I hardly got ta press
Got two guns, and both lead to cardiac arrest
My success got suckers salty (salty)
Blowin steam like a cup of coffee
Click POW get these fuckas off me

[Hook: 50 Cent]

My jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (x3)
This scheming don't affect me

[Bridge: Lloyd Banks]

More than 500 horses when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get your whole damn crew

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Get in my Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beat it I bet she let me, she been fiending since she met me
I'm the coolest shit especially when I throw on all my Gretzky
Got my Smith and Wessie to protect me so respect me
This is heavy new Bentley, color vanilla and cherry
Andretti-O Pirelli make a movie out the getty
Where my ring and my confetti, I'm Kobe Bryant ready
Pink Rose and chronic smelly while stumbling out the telly
I'm so fly, I'm so ferry and the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete, way my pencil move his deadly
Platinum band, platinum bezzie, make a straight girl outta' lezzie
Magazine, mac, benzie keep my windows like the prezzie
Press a button than I'm stunting, my roof look like it's ducking
Meter go 200 something and my trunk do when it's bumping
I am not the one for jumping I will rachet out and stump him
Dump him, your better off dead, ya money red

[Bridge: Juelz Santana/Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm always high
Got your bitch waving at me when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Whether Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, I be movin', I be movin'
Making movies Tom Cruisin' if it's action then I'm shooting
Pockets fat, necks studded, boy my nick name should be Ruben
My Columbian connect told me the Mexicans have moved it
And he know just how I get it so we bout to introduce him
Got a girl named Cigar called her that cause she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boostin', got a white girl that be boofin'
Gotta watch her cause she use it but she fuck me like she stupid
And she always ready to give me that becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club ordered bottles see the sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch lookin like the 4th of July
But if you get to frontin and the pushing lead to shoving
We just bussing and we leaving like it's nothing
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louie then it's Polo or it's Rugby
And this bitch I brought with me, she be bagging bitches for me

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Lloyd Banks]
I got a girl named Kima and Kima like Christina
Baby three don't make a crowd it make a sex scene meaner
I just wanna get between her, turn her 'to a screamer
Then it's one, two, I'm through, see ya
