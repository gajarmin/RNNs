[Intro/Sample]
One gun Two gun Three gun Four!
Take em out, take em out, bring em out dead

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Send 'em to Allah kingdom, pistol-grip pump rap
It’s like music to my ears when the gun clap
You a stupid motherfucker, here's a dunce cap
Shoot you in the fuckin' stomach where your lunch at
I ain't listening no more, cause son whack
I'm like bustin' inside a rubber, I come strapped
Y'all wanna hear a fun fact?
My guns is heavy on the scale, god, dumb fat
Where the Mossberg? Where the dum-dums at?
Ninety-three million miles away from where the sun's at
I'm Jimmy nine times, cousin you a dumb rat
I put you in the back of the ac with Pun mac (Rest In Peace)
I'm a grown-ass lion, you a young cat
Wet 'em up, better hope the ambulance comes stat
Take the shotty off the gun rack
Toss his body on the ground like when Charles Bark sonned Shaq

[Sample Scratched Hook]
Mothafucka BANG
One gun Two gun Three gun Four!
Youre Mine, its all about crime!
It's the streets in me its an everyday thang
All day everyday mothafucka BANG BANG

[Verse 2: Blaq Poet]
Wild motherfucker since birth, get hurt
Who's first? Got blood thirst, shoot up your hearse
It's insane, let me explain the pain
I came to reign supreme, hammer damage your brain
Highly flammable, easily slaying you
I do what I came to do, your hood should be ashamed of you
Blaq Po, murder motherfuckers up, yo
What the fuck is up? I don't care what they say, you fuckin' suck
The black monster go harder
Spit pure lava, word to the father
Don't make me show up at your crib with the pump
I can find out where you live, where you from
But you're not a threat, you're puppy-dog harmless
Tail between your legs when I start to bomb shit[Man and Blaq Poet]
Yo yo yo yo Poet man yo Poet. You hear me son?
Damn son man. I'm in some real live shit right now dun (Damn)
Shit is real right now son. I just took this bitch to Poconos man
(Right, Right)
Just got back you, know what I'm saying. Yo son man..
I'm in some shit man. Niggas is calling me. Pager keep going off (You fucked up)
I fucked up son

[Blaq Poet]
You fucked up nigga

[Blaq Poet]
Now where the fuck did all that coke go?
Stop looking stupid, nigga, like you don't know
Oh, I heard you took that ho to Poconos
With so much shit they renamed it Cocanos
Got niggas calling you and paging you
Been there before nigga, it's like deja vu
But the niggas you owe, they owe some niggas too
Enough of that bullshit, they coming body you
Had too many changes, had too many shots
Niggas heard it all from stick-up-kids to cops
Now you in a jeep, moe, smoking bogie after bogie
Like they going to forget
Nigga, you're in some shit
Better get that money up before they chop off your cabbage
Better hurry up before them niggas let you have it
And that what you get for trying to live lavish
Fucking up niggas money, stupid bastard

[Hook] x2
You fucked up and don't know what to do
You fucked up, got niggas looking for you
You fucked up and don't know what to do
You really fucked up this time

[Blaq Poet]
Nigga you knew better
With that motherfucking cheddar
Trying to run around like you're cash money Jigga
You're about to get your whole shit peeled
Your man getting stabbed and that bitch getting killed
Nigga what the deal
You better get your steel
I've seen a black car with four niggas looking ill on the hill
Shit is about to get real
Looks like you need the nine mill, I got your back with the mac-mill
Stupid motherfucker got me in this
Fucking with you I might get my whole shit twisted
But we go way back, did many hood crimes
We watched Janet play Penny on Good Times
I always had your back, you always had mines
I know you bust for me, you know I bust mines
Call them niggas back, tell them that they're dead
Or meet you on the southside if they want their bread
Make sure that you got the full clip
And let the click know it just might be some bullshit
Send the chickens to the store, ?pour Henny in the raw?
You fucked up, now we got to raw

[Hook]

[Blaq Poet]
Now we on the block drinking
Getting drunk, playing with guns
Look up in here there they come
They came to kill my dun
Creeping, posting up on me
Niggas behind the tree
Taking aim on one knee
They got me
They got to drop
I turned up hop
We lit up the block
When the smoke cleared niggas was shot
I'm on the bench with the gatcock sizzling hot
Two duns dropped dead right then on the spot
Had to flee because we heard the motherfucking cops
Niggas is dead beacause you fucked up, ?mountains of rocks?
Get out of here, I don't want to see you no more on the block
You're exiled, nigga
Better bounce now, nigga
You fucked up[Poet]
Hot Day set it off!

[DJ Hot Day cuts]

[Poet]
Well I'm the Poet about set shit off
And all the microphone you know I get off
Rappers be warned that I'm not a joke
And if you fuck around, you might get something broke
I'm always prepared for warfare
And you can tell by the gear that I choose to wear
Timberlands, army pants, black hoodie
Strapped with a rap like that of a nine milli
I set it off when I want some action
There's always a rapper waiting for a waxin
Every MC: beware!
Poet's here and I just don't care
Back to attack and I'm on a mission
I mop up the stage with competition
So you're the competitor? I'm the predator
You want to get beat? Tell your manager to set it up
So we can go at it, you'll be splattered
And when I'm finished, you'll be another Poet addict
Strung out, all the rhymes I rung out
For even saying you can win, I should rip your tongue out
Nobody comes close, no matter how much they boast
They went gold but I still burn them like toast
I eat MC's and wash them down with a forty
Try to riff and I fuck you up shorty
Now you know it, the Poet is mo' betta
I'mma chill and leave it up to Cormega
Set it off

[DJ Hot Day cuts]

[Cormega]
Mega is scientist, metaphor analyst
Predator, I set it off like a terrorist
I accelerate like a four wheeler
And Hot Day supplies the bass like a drug dealer
I'm a architect and I spark the set
Like the Jamaican Posse flippin' in 'Marked for Death'
You're not ready for prime time, whenever I rhyme
I'm superior deteriorating your brain area
Busting your interior and exterior
Ripping the area like a pit terrier
I'm insane, Mega inflicts pain
I set it off like soldier in Fort Maine
Mutilate, assassinate and flip
My technology is like a microchip
Mega mic prototype
I kill static like Illmatic Ice
My device has long clip of infrared light
My brain's evil like the antichrist when I'm hyped
I leave the fucking mics smoking like bass pipes
Your crew gets bumrushed
My sound waves kick down the door like TNT in a drugbust
Cormega can never be imitated
Motivators fear the poetry I generated
When women get intimitated, I hit it
I get mega pussy, like in abortion clinic
It's mandatory, I'm self-explanatory
Don't front on me shorty, your man is working for me
When in effect I pull Tec and get wreck
Then step cause I'm Goodfella exec
Generator when strap rap activator
Terminator similar to Schwarzenegger
I deceive and disarm MC's
Living in suspended animation, your brain cells freeze
My mind designed like 'Nam
And I'mma let all proegees step off when I set it off

[DJ Hot Day cuts till the end][Intro]
I hear voices.. Damn
Word? Shit!
You buggin' my nigga I don't hear nothin, for real!
Damn.. Shit is crazy
Gotta stop fuckin' drinkin' that henny
Smokin' that weed
(Uh!)

[Verse 1]
I hear voices, and it sounds like Pac
Askin' me, yo what's up with Hip Hop?
All these niggas, tryin' to live thug life
They didn't listen when I was spittin' on the mic
All they heard was Makaveli the great
They didn't hear when I was comin' in a positive way
Like Keep Ya Head Up, and Brenda With a Baby
Niggas just love to think that I was crazy
But I was crazy smart
My momma ain't raised no fool
I spit from the heart
Black Panther shit, mixed with street poetry
I had to hit
Aiyyo Poet
All these niggas is ass
If I was alive today I would straight spas

[Hook]
Damn! I hear voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead
Damn! I'm hearin voices
Gotta stop drinkin that Henny
I know that shit's poison
Damn! I'm hearin voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead

[Verse 2]
I hear voices, and it sounds like Biggie
Askin' me, what up with New York City?
Why y'all niggas ain't puttin' up big numbers?
African niggas, bootleggin' every summer
Yo what the fuck?! Y'all better get at them
If y'all niggas tryin' to go gold and platinum
You better start flippin' over them tables
Like a nigga on the street, and they tryin' to play you
But I know the game, everybody gotta eat
I respect the hustle, look how Diddy doin' me
Looks like y'all niggas gotta go harder
And FYI, I'm pissed at Shawn Carter

[Hook]
Damn! I hear voices
Gotta stop drinkin' that henny
I know that shit's poison
Damn! I'm hearin' voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead
Damn! I hear voices
Gotta stop drinkin' that henny
I know that shit's poison!
Damn! I hear voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead

[Verse 3]
I hear voices, and it sounds like the God
Rakim Allah, live Central Park
Thun, you gotta make 'em follow the leader
When the rhythm hit 'em in the ghetto then they gon' see ya
Voices.. And it sounds like Eazy-E
Tellin' me, these niggas is pussy, he's a G
Arguin' about St. Ides and O.E
Talkin' about, how Dr. Dre owe me
I hear voices.. And it sounds like Big Pun
Tellin' me, it's so hard to be the one
Voices, goin' through my head every day
I hear Run, talkin' to D about J
I hear voices, when I smoke that chronic
Big L got niggas hooked on ebonics
Damn! What the fuck I gotta do?
I just heard Dirty screamin' "Brooklyn Zoo!"

[Hook]
Damn! I hear voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead
Damn! I hear voices
Gotta stop drinkin' that henny
I know that shit's poison!
Damn! I hear voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead
Damn! I hear voices
Gotta stop drinkin' that henny
I know that shit's poison!

[Outro]
God! Jesus.. It's crazy!
Ya know'm sayin'?
I got Slick Rick hollerin' at me in my head
Grand Puba in my head
Motherfuckin Treacherous Three
They all in my head.. like.. bangin' in my head
Like Kool Moe Dee.. Screamin' at me
T La Rock, Cold Crush
It's crazy! Shit's crazy!
All the Hip Hop Gods
Niggas that's live niggas that's dead
Help me![Intro: DJ Premier]
KL
Yo, we gonna miss you, nigga

[Verse 1: Blaq Poet]
Yo, I'll never forget this black day
Premo calling me on a 3-way with Marley
Telling me my thun ain't here no more
Telling me to be strong, I just got the call
I hung up, I had to hit the thun line
Dez picked it up, in his voice, he was crying
He confirmed it, I sat back stunned
Thinking about my aunt, who was her only son
Thinking about my moms, that was her favorite nephew
Thinking about his sons and all the shit that they didn't get to do
Thinking 'bout how we supposed to ride out
And turn this whole rap shit inside out
He was my baby brother, he was my little cousin
He was my best friend, as little niggas, we was bugging
Running around Big Ma's house
169th and Liberty, [?]
I've been down since the day you died
We been through it all, I never can say goodbye

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Never goodbye"

[Verse 2: Blaq Poet]
I remember as kids, you used to come to the Bridge
I used to go to Far Rock, two lil' hard rocks
[?], that was your block
Even though you had asthma, that wouldn't make you stop
Nigga played football, baseball, basketball
Loved to ride your bike and playfight in the hall
Dave in the building, Richie in the building
Rest in peace Willie, I know you two chilling
Along with my pops, Uncle Charles and Uncle Fuzzy
Big Ma, say what's up to your pops, Uncle Lonnie
Im'ma miss the way you used to laugh
I'm crying out as I write this paragraph
Tears drop on the paper, the pen smears through it
Reminiscing about the day we used to do it
A real nigga that did real things
You always held your people down by any means
It's so crazy, I won't even lie
KL, by my right eye, it's never goodbye

[Hook]"You know we gonna ill" --]scratched
What...set it off what
My nigga Prim
Black Poet

[Verse 1]
Fuck the dumb shit, niggas want drama
You know who to come kid, the cappital P the o-et
Smash motherfuckers up, crush motherfuckers up
Leave your body in the closet for a motherfucking month
Niggas know my flow's relentless I said it I ment this
Niggas get high, bitches get bent
Everybody knows Poet's on some hood shit
I wake every thug around the world tryin' to get rich
If you're doing your thing then slinging your thing
You know and I know nigga better bang
Watch them hoes, watch them snakes
Real niggas in the game, fuckin' with cakes
Real niggas in the game knows what it takes
And real niggas let you know what's real and fake
Like my nigga Primo, he reach stile to me yo
Whereever he goes, I go, se, he me amigo
And we gonna ill

[Hook: scratching by DJ Premier]

"You know we gonna ill" 2X
"With love to thugs that died in the field
So many names we don't got room to spit them"
"This ain't a game nigga"
"You know we gonna ill" 3X

[Verse 2]
What, what, aha, yeah, yeah

I sat back I watch ya niggas and clacked ya niggas
Played you on my box since I put rocks and figures
Got it through this life, drugs chop my shit, nigga
Lyrics gotta throw blood kill ya weak niggas
Represent, all thugs and all money getters
I live some green and blings and shit that glitters
And plus, the word on the street is
I hotter then 2 blaze of 9 millimetres
You can't belive this
A&R's, they pullin out their heads
They get fierd cause they havd a nigga right there
CEO's screaming "why the fuck yu didn't sign 'em?"
"He brought in a mansion and a hot boy diamands"
Should have gave me the world, stupid fuck
Look how I'm rhymin', wildin', calmin', poundin', grindin'
I ain't lyin'
Mad niggas try with me, die with me
Belive it nigga, you don't wanna have to colide with me
We gonna ill

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, got it together now, Mo' to them now
Rest in peace pops, and my moms, I can't let it down
Queensbridge representative, style's unlimeted
Hot shots, hot rocks, I'm sendin' it
Who else you know get flow like Po'
For the love of this shit, and not the dough
I write my own rhymes cause I like this shit to death
Niggas don't got respect, they just writin' the ceques
I might sell 10 mill if I learned some stacks
And bleach my skin and front like I'm from the projects
But all I can be is me, and catch wreck
As far as the eye can see, my whole set
Screwball gang-stars, comin' in planes and cars
Moet bottles with your brains on the ??? at the bar
From now on, shit is gettin more real
My niggas in QB, I'm leaving you to heal
Cause I'm off the wall and I'm Illmaticly ill

[Hook]

Female singer:(X2)

You know and I know, shit is real
Poet and Primo, them niggas gon' ill
The whole industry's about, blacks and feal
Poet and Primo, them niggas gon' ill

You know, I know, we gonna ill (X2)
We're gonna ill...[Scratch Hook]:

I tried to save the game but I got homicidal tendencies
I was trying to provide for people

Scarecrow with a rare flow, swear I'm just beginning
I don't care if you show support, I hold the fort
Down, Lord Voldemort, .44 across town

I was lost, used to rap, now I talk underground
But I pop, if I gotta, make sure that you drown

Niggas in the grass, on your like a centipede
Caterpillar, don't matter nigga the brain splatter nigga

Queensbridge, that's my motherfuckin' kingdom
Poet's my name son and that where I came from

I was toting Glocks, niggas was playing with play guns
Everything is motherfuckin' real I say dunn
Get out my way dunn, I'm about to slay dunn
Beat you like a slave dunn, make you obey dunn
Poet don't play dunn, the outcome? Critical crucial

Poet's coming hardcore
With a new style for the art of war
Let the Hennessy flow, let my enemies know
Niggas is dead if they not kin of me or friend of me yo
You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real
Tryin' to penetrate my forcefield, get all killed
You don't want to see the mac clip all the way filled
Big nurse the motherfuckin' gat all in your grill
My shit is banned from t.v., banned from radio
You gotta cop me on the low like a bag of 'dro
I represent the street, I represent niggas hungry
And they wanna eat that gangsta shit
Guns out, blunts lit, polyin' over the strip
Renegades, crack-slingin' soldiers
Hustlers locked down for moving real boulders
Thug bitches that don't play the kitchen, they play the street
Cause fuck that, hoes gotta eat
Poet's comin'

[Scratched]
A thug poet
You think I'm playin'

Hit 'em with that shit Prem

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's a lot of niggas comin' in, a lot of niggas comin' off
A lot of niggas frontin' like they ill when they butter soft
Competition looks thick, got a lot of niggas locked
But they ain't like me, I'm like you, I'm like from your block
Shot g's with gym stars, dump d's in marked cars
Stay a real nigga in the street and behind bars
Fuck the radio play, I don't need it anyway
Remember back in the day in L.A., N.W.A
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Gotta get my motherfuckin' shine on, murderin' every beat I rhyme on
Niggas light up with me, bitches get drunk with me
No rapper and no company could fuck with me, see
Straight like that, I got that king cobra venomous rap
Get in my face and I'm gone give you a smack
I'm on some what what, Noreaga shit
Pull out, spray this bitch
Blaq Poet: hip hop's most dangerous

[Hook][Hook x2]
[Akon Samples: "Blaq Poet"]
(When I come to the hood)
You know what's poppin'
(Ain't nuttin changed)
You know what's on

(When I come to the hood)

[Verse 1]
It's like woooo-aaahhh!
Ain't nuttin' changed 'Po whatchu gonna do man?
We still gettin' money, bitches still actin' funny
They wanna hold somethin, can't get shit from me
I'm back on the block, passin' the rock
Got my young squad, you don't want 'em bastards to pop
Rhyme veteran ready to get it in
Way before fif I was hated by many men
When I come to the hood, you know I'm creepin'
Leave you leakin', missiles heat seekin'
Nuttin' to talk about, fo' pound in your mouth
New York in the house, I dare you to walk it out
Straight menace, fight to the finish
Niggas get demolished, diminished I mean business
Millionaire rappers still wanna envy me
They wish they was mini-me, I'm sick on any beat

[Hook x2]


[Verse 2]
Niggas need those
I'm on a hill, where all the fiends go
Big bottle of yack, the big gat
Niggas fall back, I got the biggest crap
And when it's time to go, I go hard
Fuck the police they got a job, I got a job
Ain't nuttin' changed, except the weather
Except the chedda, except a nigga got betta
After all these years and all these beers
I got niggas still running in fear, why?
I ain't killin' nuttin', I ain't lettin' nuttin' die
Niggas know the repercussions if they fucking try
Shine up, stand up and a puffy eye
Besides that? Blaq Poet, a lovely guy
Run around have fun in the hood
Get love from my thuns when I come in the hood

[Hook]


[Verse 3]
Ain't nuttin' changed
Niggas still pumping the rain
Things still come from the train
Still gotta tell them mothafuckas no change
Niggas still on the block, holdin' em thangs
Some disappeared like motherfucking Blaine
Some got hang, some comin' home, some in the zone
They all can't wait 'til I tell 'em that it's on
Blaq Poet army across New York
Ya'll niggas don't even talk, You done prim with a fork
Screwball disciples get at you
Niggas don't like you, baseball bat you
Or sit up on a roof, and snipe you
Miles away, 50 cal rifle
A real gangsta is good in any hood
A real goon comin' soon to your hood

[Hook]"Hello please record a message after the tone"

[Intro: Poet]
Yo, what's the deal, yo whattup Primo, man
All these niggas man poppin shit, and shit
All these niggas is rich
Nobody wanna die, nobody really wanna kill eachother
Anybody just need to fall back, aha
Cause everybody payin'
Everybody just need to fall back and do them
"Yeah y'all, come on!"

[Poet]
Aiiyo Summerjam live, Jigga goin' at Nas
Yo...what's goin' on with these guys?
Next thing you know, Nas goin' at Jay
+Ether+ to the dome tried to blow him away
Motherfuckers wanna make it to some Queensbridge - Marcy shit
Believe me, New York, we don't wanna spark this shit
We still rebuildin', these women and children
The whole shit will turn to Ground Zero if we start illin'
Look at Foxy and Kim, what's wrong with them
Both of them platinum, used to be bitches
Now they wanna give each other stitches, damn
Is that how it is, when niggas get riches
You got 50 with Ja, 50 with Jay
50 with anybody that get in 50 way
G-Unit, Jadakiss and Beanie
That's a ill one believe me
They should take it to T.V
Cam'ron and Esco who got the best flow
DMX whoa goin' at ya little bro'
And the whole Roc-A-Fella wanna get at Jaz-O
Eminem, come on now that's a no-no
Disrespectin' your moms we don't play that shit yo
Even as a crack fiend mama, black queen mama
You learned 2Pac and that's the king of drama
Dr. Dre should've told ya
But he to busy goin' at Jermaine Dupri to show ya
But Blaq Poet pull a trigger
We know you nice, forget you white just rep it right nigga
I look over at the westside
I see Snoop, Suge, Xzibit 'bout to collide
And make some real nigga wanna cry
It's like niggas forgot about Pac and B-I
The only way to settle this; battle it out
106 & Park and leave the gat at the house
If not ain't no more to be yappin about
Get back to makin' your joints cause that's what rap is about
Yo that shit is weak and all y'all niggas know it
You can keep it on to lead it cause it's just A Message From Poet
SAY WHAT
That shit is weak and all y'all niggas know it
You can keep it or delete it, it's just A Message From Poet
"Yeah y'all come on!"[Hook]
Beat you down

[Verse 1]
Listen up world as the Poet attacks
This is just a little sample of how I wax
BDP is trying to dis, we know that they're on it
Every time we make a record, they get disappointed
Nobody said Hip Hop started out in the Bridge
But you dissed all of Queens now we know how you live
You're trying to get paid talking 'bout my town
When I battle you punk I'mma beat you down

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How can you say the Bridge is over? We've just begun
You soft sucker MC, KRS-One
Can you believe it, party people? He rap like a rasta
Boogie Down Productions are full of imposters
They say things that are not true
Now the Poet and Noel will break it down for you
Yes Bronx started Hip Hop, but didn't maintain it
Now they're getting jealous cause Queens has made it
That's why those suckers are trying to dis
Because we're getting paid and they're getting pissed
Just think about it people, I'm speaking the facts and
Manhattan keeps making it, Queens do the taxing
My name is Poet, for the top I'm bound
Anybody in my way is getting beat down

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now back in the days when Hip Hop began
Queens was rocking with the hardest jams
Over there in the Bronx you jammed with house speakers
We was rocking bass bottoms, and JBL tweeters
Bound up and down, Richard Long bound
Was Infinity Machine and Nu Sounds
You say that the Bronx is rocking the place
When you just got put on to sub bass
Man, the old school, they used to duel
And of course Nu Sounds was the ones who ruled
The Infinity Machine taking out power
Ever since the days you been all on ours
Yes we had the jams that was worth a lot
I know you remember when the Bertha rocked
With the bass so low, it shook the ground
Man, even back then we was beating you down

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
KRS One, you sound like a sissy
You want to battle me, yo let's get busy
Battles I enjoy, they improve our tactics
I'm telling you now, you're purely practice
And if you want to fight, put down your mic
And we will lock ass for the whole damn night
You can get your whole crew, but don't swing arms
Cause I'm knocking down posses with my pythons
I don't need bodyguards, cause this boy's bad
And Noel got my back with the 45 Mag
So come on and roll, so we can get buck
This is one MC that don't give a fuck
Don't ever let me hear you say Queens is soft
We'll be rolling to the Bronx with sawed-offs
Yes Bronx created Hip Hop, I'll give you that
But you're also the creators of the drug called crack
You thought we didn't know, you thought we forgot
Everybody in your crew has beamed up to scott
I know you want to battle from the things I said
Just remember Poet will put out that head
Beat down!

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I know that you're mad because we got loose
But you tried to dis Marley and Sir Juice
Just remember, we know how you're playing a game
You're trying to get fame off Marley's name
Just take this advice from Noel and Poet
Stop trying to dis Queens and get off the tip
Yes me and Noel will be back to crush
You will never leave Bronx if you ever dis us
You don't like what I said, you don't like how I sound
Just battle me boy so I can beat you down

[Hook][Verse 1:Blaq Poet]

I’m non-stop hip-hop, Blaq Poet is a fucking beast
Spit lyrics like that gun and I come in peace
Me and my guns, we running this fucking streets
Y’all niggas is pussy, don’t stand in front of me
I represent the streets with my hard rhymes
I represent my niggas going hard times
Y’all soft niggas come late when it’s trouble
You hate when I bubble, can’t relate to my struggle (nope)
The music you make proves you a dud
I leave y’all niggas laying in a pool of blood
Y’all not on my level, I leave you in the dust
I’ll leave you with your people all broke up and crushed
This is that shit that they fiend for
The uncut raw is what they pay the green for
They say that these are the last days
In that case, yo, I’m going on a rampage

[Hook:Wais P]

You don’t wanna play with these here niggas
Cuz these here niggas walk around with hair triggers
And old school caddies, new Benzes with the navi
If you do it for your hood nigga show me where your hands be

[Verse 2:Wais P]

Rubber band rap, my money slap
My snow bunnies tell ‘em shake it off
Then buy your fur just to take it off
I’m making off with your life savings, Bernie Madoff
Niggas try to scam the same corner that I ate off
The difference is, ain’t no mimicking, this is pimpin’ shit
Crocodile lizard shit, Send ho's in a blizzard shit
Flow, rare isn’t it, I dare you to visit this
I rip and tear limitless, it ain’t fair, you’re finished kid
Wais P the business, Greek god, call me Icarus
You’re flying too close to the sun
Get your wings burned off, flame blown out and turned off
You’re playing chicken with us, semi truck you need to turn off
My pimp crew colder, so many minks and furs
Next year we rock koala bear and polar
Shitting on you, when it’s on I come through spraying
Like homeboy from Tucson, Arizona

[Hook:Wais P]

You don’t wanna play with these here niggas
Cuz these here niggas walk around with hair triggers
And old school caddies, new Benzes with the navi
If you do it for your hood nigga show me where your hands be[Blaq Poet]
Aight. What's good? Yeah, Hoo-haa! Blaq Poet, kid
Mad scientist Alchemist. It's a year round thing, you heard?
Hit these niggas off

[Blaq Poet]
Yo, Poet's the wildest, the foulest, spitting malice
Since I was a child, I loved the challenge
I put in my hours, I built up my powers, I'm here to devour
All you cowards, the nine shell shower the block
Bitches on my cock now that I'm hot
Record companies wanting me to sign on the spot
You got give me my motherfucking shit off the top
Matter of fact, Year Round, that's how I rock
It's Gang Starr
First Family
NYG'z
The first time Bronx been down with QB

[Hook] x2
Yes, yes y'all, I be the best y'all
Your double vest can't even protect y'all
It's Blaq Poet, Queensbridge, bloody mess y'all
Them niggas suck, I came to bless y'all

[Blaq Poet]
Ayo, Poet's unstoppable
Rhyme remarkable
Skip the hospital, you dead when I target you
Don't try to do what I do
Cause that's hard to do
Don't try to fuck with my crew
They put scars on you
I'm Queensbridge for rilly, no doubt
War's what I'm about, so y'all just cut it out
I got niggas in BK
Killers in Queens
Bronx and Manhattan
They show guns with Staten
My team is like all mad and
Thirsty for the drama
Word to my mama, most wanted like Osama
Y'all niggas need to stop, Cause when them guns pop
Y'all be hiding like bitch, while the real niggas drop
You all pussy anyway, smacked up anyday
Got something to say? Let the nine milli spray
I'm not hard to find out in the hood, crack slinging
Ready for any type of shit niggas think of bringing

[Hook] x2

[Blaq Poet]
Ayo, I come through blazing amazing niggas
Got you hoping Superman start saving niggas
Strictly headshots, motherfuck gracing niggas
I need money like Puff, Suge, Jay and them niggas
Got a million man marching fingers on triggers
I'm trying to sell ten mill, I ain't playing with niggas
I told you I was coming, here I am
The gat's in my hand
Mic in the other
Crazy motherfucker from the hood
Attacking the shit
The mack of the shit
Go platinum and still click crack on the strip
Search and destroy
All motherfuckers that want it
You and your boys
Swiss cheese from head to stomach
Cause I don't care
I'm a nut like that, I bust my gat
I walk it, I talk it, it's actual fact
Niggas acting like Poet ain't spark this shit
I'm Queensbridge architect, I build this bitch
Brick by brick, barehands in the trenches
Walk around, you see my name in all the benches
Ask all the niggas and bitches who bear witness
Who made the most crack money? Just ask the snitches

[Hook] x2[Intro]

The fuck you say now, huh? Hey, huh? Bam bam bam motherfucker I am strapped. You don't fucking talk now, huh?

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]

I got the AR-15, let me hit his head
Heard us running up inside the crib and then he shit his bed
I ain’t trying to hear nothing cousin give me bread
The only thing inside the duffel bag shrunken heads
That’s how motherfucking grimy we are
You don’t wanna see how motherfucking violent we are
Yeah, or where the motherfucking silencers are
What the Asiatic motherfucking sciences are
I know you saying that this motherfucker curse a lot
I’m just trying to balance out the fact you rock a purse a lot
I heard you suck dick and walk around in skirts a lot
Listen to Kanye West, recite his verse a lot
Pazienza I don’t rock with that soft shit
We juice crew Hilltop hardcore shit
We got the ? digger uncut raw shit
To put his motherfucking body in the morgue shit

[Verse 2: Blaq Poet]

Murder the murder the more crime, that’s what I’m about
Find these motherfuckers, air em out, I don’t care about
Your innocence, don’t be in my vicinity
Bullets got no name, I aim at my enemies
Empty the clip, pistol-whipping your friends
Reload my shit just to kill em again
My house of pain, ain’t no way outta here
Fuck outta here, catching mad bodies here
I got that new shit you bang
Screwball wilding out with the Pistol Gang
Yeah, ain’t no way of stopping this
Don’t be scared, just prepare for the Apocalypse
Fuck what you gotta say
I’m a predator, y’all motherfuckers is the prey
I can do the shit in my sleep
I was taught to terrorize rappers and torture the beats

[Interlude]

They got Uzis, they got shotguns, they got explosives, they got access to any kind of weapon they want within 24 hours

[Verse 3: Lateb]

This is Smash Mouth, might as well I took the MAC out
Cut your pretty grill now you got something to rap out
Mercenary merciless no stopping if you tap out
Take everything like po’s raiding the stash house
I’mma break your nose with the poetry of rose
Push your blind faith like the fucking rosary you hold
Openly I’m bold cause I’ve broken all the laws
? my soul
Evil’s all I know, ? fiending for control
So each second of each day the demon in him grows
? feed him all day ? never fold
Interrupt him while he’s eating now you bleeding in the fold
Gotta know what trouble is the opposite of rubber grip
Tied to a chair, ? bucket lips
You should stop complaining, the muttering and mumbling
Cause ? cause eternal suffering[Intro]

"The fuck you say now!? Huh!?
Hey! Huh!?
Bam! bam! bam!
Mothafucka I'm strapped!
You don't fuckin' talk now, huh!?"

[Vinnie Paz]

I got the AR-15, let me hit his head
Heard us running up inside the crib and then he shit his bed
I ain't trying to hear nothing cousin give me bread
The only thing inside the duffel bag shrunken heads
That's how motherfucking grimy we are
You don't wanna see how motherfucking violent we are
(Yeah!) Or where the motherfucking silencers are
What the Asiatic motherfucking sciences are
I know you saying that this motherfucker curse a lot
I'm just trying to balance out the fact you rock a purse a lot
I heard you suck dick and walk around in skirts a lot
Listen to Kanye West, recite his verse a lot
Pazienza I don't rock with that soft shit
We juice crew Hilltop hardcore shit
We got the ??? uncut raw shit
To put his motherfucking body in the morgue shit, yeah[Intro/Sample]
One gun Two gun Three gun Four!
Take em out, take em out, bring em out dead

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Send 'em to Allah kingdom, pistol-grip pump rap
It’s like music to my ears when the gun clap
You a stupid motherfucker, here's a dunce cap
Shoot you in the fuckin' stomach where your lunch at
I ain't listening no more, cause son whack
I'm like bustin' inside a rubber, I come strapped
Y'all wanna hear a fun fact?
My guns is heavy on the scale, god, dumb fat
Where the Mossberg? Where the dum-dums at?
Ninety-three million miles away from where the sun's at
I'm Jimmy nine times, cousin you a dumb rat
I put you in the back of the ac with Pun mac (Rest In Peace)
I'm a grown-ass lion, you a young cat
Wet 'em up, better hope the ambulance comes stat
Take the shotty off the gun rack
Toss his body on the ground like when Charles Bark sonned Shaq

[Sample Scratched Hook]
Mothafucka BANG
One gun Two gun Three gun Four!
Youre Mine, its all about crime!
It's the streets in me its an everyday thang
All day everyday mothafucka BANG BANG

[Verse 2: Blaq Poet]
Wild motherfucker since birth, get hurt
Who's first? Got blood thirst, shoot up your hearse
It's insane, let me explain the pain
I came to reign supreme, hammer damage your brain
Highly flammable, easily slaying you
I do what I came to do, your hood should be ashamed of you
Blaq Po, murder motherfuckers up, yo
What the fuck is up? I don't care what they say, you fuckin' suck
The black monster go harder
Spit pure lava, word to the father
Don't make me show up at your crib with the pump
I can find out where you live, where you from
But you're not a threat, you're puppy-dog harmless
Tail between your legs when I start to bomb shit[Verse 1: Blaq Poet]
Blaq Poet
Wilding with the usual suspectz
I bust TECS, running with the goons and roughnecks
I'm here to get it in, and take the shit again
Not your regular rapper, rhyming and Ritalin
I'm on the rampage every damn day
No room for your bitch motherfuckers you can't stay
'fuck outta here, hit the ground running
You no it ain't nuttin, I'm dumbin', dramas coming
Maniac on the mic, psychopath, I go first, I go last
Still rip shit in half (don't matter)
I'm here to read forever, I ain't leavin'
Hundred miles per hour, speeding, fire breathing
I'm the monster under your bed
Keep the light on, if you sleep on me you dead
All the critics talk that I'm too mean
Or maybe it's the way I hot spit a sixteen

[Hook x2]
This is Goonsville
In the hood where my dudes spill
If you don't already know then you soon will
This is Goonsville
Where them tools kill
Another random body on the newsreel

[Verse 2:]
?? star of the ghetto, so don't let the heart settle
Start braking and pumping like a car pedal
I pass more of them rocks than Carmello
Looking like a filled up my bags with marshmallows
Looking like i filled up the mag with D-Batteries
Then automatically, i foresee tragedy
And if you battle me peace to a Blaq Poet
You get smacked, and if you listen to the track (know it)
Better call your boys, fuck it call the Navy in
Cause you faggots is softer than baby skin
Fuck around, throw your body in the landfill
So if my records don't sell then your grams will
Gotta stand still, when i aim and shoot
With that metal in my hand like I'm playing flute
Get your hands up, i don't mean raise the roof
Show me bunny ears son I'ma take your loot

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
Snowgoons and Suspectz were made to kill
Our words'll get you cut off like
Unpaid electric bills, my set has skills
Better than i said before
So when I'm in the hood i stay lower than my credit score
I measure more, i keep my eyes wide open
Forever in the war, on the front line smoking
Gladiator in a Colosseum it's the honest way
Live and die by the sword and i let the options weigh
Stop and say, you know I'm gonna fight hard
I got to war with my hands, ?giving/given/getting? punches like a time card
And yes I rhyme bars like lifers in the night yard
The product that i push get you wet like a life guard
NFS, Blaq Poet, Goons on the beat
Never rest for a moment, still stand on my feet, words of defeat
Never this is our time, so i made my point like Chris Paul at the foul line

[Hook x2][Intro: Panchi]
Ha
You used to us yet?
Sha told you to get used to us
We been legenday, it's nothing
Year Round Records
Yeah
From all over
Worldwide, Tri State
Pop off

[Sample 2x]
"From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary," "shit I'm legendary"

[Verse 1: Nick Javas]
I came into this game for a purpose
Not to get pursed quick, but to reach the people with my verses
I knew it when I first spit, wasn't the nastiest
It still gave me chills cause I was reaching the masses
Grabbed the mic and never passed it
Stealing shows like a bandit and I never even planned it
Thought I would be a legend in athletics but when I had to dead it
I just found another sport, man I love this game
I'm above the lames who do it for the fortune and fame
And that's what makes me one of the greaty
Jumps on a Premier track, burning your ear wax
Was in a fight with my chick when I was writing this
And that's what separates the legends from the peasants
When I'm dead and gone, you'll feel my presence
From the top of my egg head, down to where my leg ends
I got what it takes to be a leg-end

[Hook 2x: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary," "shit I'm legendary"
"I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew"
"There's a long list of high-profile celebrities"
"From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary," "shit I'm legendary"
"I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew"
"There's a long list of street legends"

[Verse 2: Shabeeno]
How your boy hot as summer get as cold as winter
Cool, calm, collective, got my own agenda
If my flow offends ya, must be no contender
So control your temper, I put the holes up in ya
I ain't the gossiping type and I don't just pop on the mic
Yeah I was born [?] with niggas up in the heights
I got Dominicans in tenements waiting on me
To give the word, I got the word, ya niggas hating on me
I'm Kane, I'm Kool G., I'm the 18th Letter
All wrapped in one, but I don't rap like them
And I don't rap for real, I just talk to niggas
Paint pictures so vivid, think I draw my lyrics
Made my way into the game just supplying some packs
I'm in the booth, but you're a fool think I'm relying on raps
Yeah I was raised in the concrete where the streets ain't pleasant
Get it fucked up, brethren, Shy, I am legend

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blaq Poet]
They say I'm legendary, I'm here to bury you weak niggas is weary
I run up on you and pop your fucking cherry
Ya niggas is pussy, ya niggas don't want it
That Queensbridge bullshit, yeah I'm on it
I've been doing this hardcore shit since
I was a little nigga playing on the park bench
But now I'm Weapon X, cut ya nigga's fucking necks
Keep y'all niggas ducking, never know what's coming next
I know I got to slay this shit
I fucking love it when Premo makes that crazy shit
I lay the Lord down, better obey the shit
New styles, new flows, new way to spit
Motherfucker, I spit [?]
I'm a gorilla, ya niggas is monkeys
And I'm here to take over
No, it's not Hova, it's the Blaq Bulldozer

[Hook][Verse 1: Blaq Poet]

You looking for trouble?
You found it, I'm right here
Resevoir Dog nigga, cut off your right ear
Blaq Poet dope kid, you already know that
I'll cut you, head butt you
Can't fuck with this throwback
Lyrics too hard like motherfucking granite
Or gran-ITE feels like I'm not from this planet
Or maybe it's the Henny in me, I don't understand it
Fuck trying to figure it out I just slam it
Something's cooking, yo, who's looking for war
Who's looking for a broke jaw get laid on the floor
Straight warrior, battle with the warriors
Fuck what happened and fuck what the story is
If you really want it all you gotta do is test this
I'm reckless, you must have a motherfucking death wish

[Hook: Spit Gemz] (2x)

I pledge allegiance to destruction, I'm tyrannical
I am the apex, top tier animal
King of the jungle, I was meant to be royal
I'm from a broken home, I was raised on enemy soil

[Verse 2: Chino XL]

Big Chino goes hard in the paint
Getting love out in Boston like I'm a Boondock Saint
Wait, you think that I'm done when I ain't
I speak with a tongue full of hate
When I'm irate I pray for the lungs of Big Punisher the great
Give you an ass-whipping that's really just over fifteen minutes
The amount of hits that you will take to the face will be in triple digits
You looking for trouble? Come get it and get an eye missing
Every verse that I spitted is a special limited edition
My words and spiritual worlds a perfect marriage
Bringing you that scary footage without them stupid shaking cameras
Paranormal Activity raw with the depths of my depravity
These visions in my head got me walking the edge of insanity
I'm the nightmare that will easily wake up Tim Burton beastily
Never peacefully, there's curtains a surgeon carving you up evenly
The uncooked flesh that I eat wears prepared in demonic boil
Bile encapsulated in vials and mixed with cemetery soil
For artists with no need for Thesaurus to bring verbal horrors
And for the end I'm leaving you skinned like that movie Martyrs
It's proven of all rulers I'm the most ghoulish
Fuck who you and your crew is
I'll catch you on your cruise ship and decapitate you
And I'm using your skull as congas
My movement is an animal unleashed
When I preach my creature speech
It's utter madness, like cow disease
My haters can't excel our tasers [?] in hell
I'm sicker than a schizophrenic hermaphrodite raping itself
Fuck out of here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]

You looking for trouble you found it I'm right here
I rip the track in fucking half you just a slight tear
I run with rowdy motherfuckers who don't fight fair
Right there, stomp his fucking head in with the Nike Airs
I'm colder than polar motherfucker the white bear
I'm from Philly it ain't that motherfucking nice here
The manifestation of holiness is right here
My fascination with loneliness in the night air
I think it's common knowledge you don't wanna fuck with me
If I'm your bunkie you wouldn't wanna be stuck with me
Pussy boy soaking wet like a buck fifty
John Rambo, take his fucking guts with me
Just waiting until this Goose and this fucking dust hits me
You ain't Aaron Fuchs you ain't from a tough city
I was Killadelph, brothers Puff 'nough izzy
I throw a left right leave a sucker duck dizzy, stupid[Verse 1]

Have no fear, Black Po's here
Bitch-ass niggas to the back of the rear
I just don't care, it's time for me to tear
It's time for me to leave the rhyming spree to bleed your ear
I represent the streets, it's hard for ends to meet
Niggas hustle to eat, police hustle the beat
They trying to bust you in sweeps
They trying to rest you in peace my niggass
Follow me cause you can count on me
Hardcore for life, fuck all that other shit
Blaq Poet Society, the new government
Fuck them rappers fronting for them cameras
All the gimmicks and bullshit they all characters
This shit is real, nothing but true life
I get ill, some say I'm too nice
Some say I'm too crazy, some say I'm too nuts
Some say I'm too wild but I don't give two fucks

[Chorus]

Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's murder
Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's done

Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's murder
Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's done

[Verse 2]

I'm back spazzing, sitting back laughing
This is the year of the black dragon, I flow with a mad passion
You came to war with a water gun
Niggas know I slaughter them, this is just the beginning, there's more to come
Let's be serious, I go so furious
I rip y'all niggas from head to toe delirious
This ain't no regular raps and rhyme
This is that terror to snatch your shine
The secret is out it's mine
I'm ready for any kind of metaphor
Any kind of petty war Cinco de Mayo bring em all
And I ain't looking for nobody's approval
I'm a Whoo-head for life though my words slice through you
Haters can't handle the pain, supreme I'mma reign
Damn it's a shame and I damage you lames

[Chorus]

Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's murder
Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's done

Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's murder
Black, no time for looking back
Black, no time for looking back, it's done{*samples from Chorus for a bit until fade*}



[Intro/Chorus 2X: various samples scratched]
"Recognize the G"
"What y'all don't know? Shots bang out of clips"
"Recognize the G"
"Macs, tecs, which ones you like?"

[Blaq Poet]
What, what, WHAT~?!
Poet's unstoppable, rhyme style remarkable
Flow like an AK, poppin you, droppin you
{*gunfire sprays*} I'm known as the wildest
I get it in, I'm the motherfuckin foulest
Who wanna test? I leave a bloody mess
Ain't none of y'all niggas, built for my stress
Ready for war wearin Timbs and fatigues
Takin no prisoners it's you versus me
... I'm the hardest of the hardcore
It's God's law, I'm trained in the art of war
How many times I gotta say this shit?
Gotta remind y'all niggas, y'all forget quick
I rep QB to the fullest
Got the whole rap industry sweatin bullets
You know my motto was fuck the police
From Queens Plaza to 59 Street
Touch mine and it's problems
So many problems... a genius can't solve them!

[Chorus]

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
The righteous will prosper, I'm higher than opera notes
Tote guns, spit fire like Mothra - don't
Ever look into the eye of a monster
I'm not, tryna battle you I'm tryin to pop you
You dumb! I was tryin to stop you
Now you dyin cause I hold the iron iron that shot you
Yo guns don't kill people, the soul of a man does
Leave you faceless like the mascot for And1
Throwback shit, hold that clip
I just collect money chill, and roll that piff
Until you get the picture, like a Kodak strip
They call me raw dog Cauze, I'm on that Kojak shit
Telly Saval' I'm ready for all, demolition
Hit 'em, until they ready to fall, hold my heat ready
Aim steady and all
Take niggas back to school like every fall
It's the Cauze young boy...

[Chorus][Verse 1]
It's Blaq Po' I'm on a killing spree
Y'all niggas gonna remember me
Warlord, hardcore, goin' down in history
Nigga ain't no mystery
The .44 guarantees a flawless victory
Y'all niggas ain't shit to me
I got the skills to lyrically crush you
I got them things that reach out and touch you
Viciously fuck you up, something horrible
Let Lil Wayne and T-Pain keep playing in the carnival
While I rebuild this rap shit from scratch, kid
I got the Blaqprint, this shit is like crack, kid
I make you want it more
Got you searching on the floor
Got you climbing up the walls
Who hears? Who ball?
Nobody coming harder than me
Every day, getting more harder to see
Follow a G
Cus I'm parting the sea
Who want drama with me?
You might aswell point the llama at your college squeeze

[Hook]
This shit ain't no joke
This shit is pure dope
Be easy, young blood
Careful, young folk
It's getting rough now
Niggas all hush now
Tiptoeing around
Trying not to get shook down

[Verse 2]
The more bars I spit the more barbaric it get
The more blood drip, flooding the public
My niggas hugging the strip, this for yall niggas
Get that money, watch them unmarked cars niggas
And for the rest of you lames just pay attention
My name is in flames, stop your complaining and bitching
I'm murdering main competition trigger finger itching
I'm so ill it's sickening, like E pills and mixing
Who ever wanted? What, what? I'm still on it, still
Red eye blunted, still keep it 100
Rip the book bag off you backpackers
And smack the shit outta all you whack rappers
I got screwy-Louie, cave-milly running through me
I'm possessed by all the Queensbridge fallen goonies
It's about to get ten times worse
Got the haze for my head, and the henny for my thirst
I won't stop until the end of my days
I'm like double your age in a rage running craz'

[Hook]

[Movie sample]
"I told y'all little niggas, don't fuck with me but you wanna fuck with a nigga, right? I tried to be a good motherfucking nigga but I can't be because little bitch ass niggas wanna fuck with me. You want to fuck with a nigga, right? You want a nigga who got two stripes on him to go to jail for life!"[Intro]

Ladies and Gentlemen, We got Queens-Bridge finest up in this motherfucka tonight
They just came from a war, they wanna let you know a lil' somethin' about where they come from

[Verse 1: Blaq Poet]

Surprise nigga, Poet laser beam spitta
I'm from The Bridge, Queens nigga
One of the last real mean niggas
Back up, I'm hype and I'm in

I still consider Tyson a champ
Yall niggas is puss
Type of niggas, niggas get mushed
Can't wait to introduce ya ass to my foot
I'm comin through like I told all my dons I would
I'm coppin that brick, I'm makin sure them guns is good
That's some other shit I really shouldn't be rhymin' about
But fuck it, I ain't holdin' nothin' I put my time on the block
I leave it all for my real ??? dogs to do
While I, break raps in two and rep for the screw
Year Round's the label, The logo's a calander

[Hook]

Ya niggas better run

Time for action

Ya niggas better run
Don't matter where you from
Go tell everyone

X2

[Verse 2: Blaq Poet]

Poet has come to do niggas dirty
Ya son of a bitches I don't like none of them niggas
I seen 'em in the magazine frontin' in pictures
With them video hoes, but they ain't fuckin them bitches
Poet has come to lead yall niggas
Hip Hop is starvin' I came to feed yall niggas
Poet has come to show you who's the best at this
I'm wreckin' shit
Nigga I perfected this
I let my dog take a shit on ya front yard
Pull out the Mack, and go straight retard
I got the bitches sayin, "Damn, he look too hard!"
He might beat the pussy up
"Oh child Lord!"
Yall niggas don't understand how I'm comin' at it
My formula's quadratic
Contra-postive
My shit is too deep, even for you college kids

[Verse 3: Blaq Poet]

I got Preem with me, NYG'z with me, M.O.P. with me
Teflon, Krumb Snatcha, and Bun B with me
Who's with me?
Goons with me
I fools with me
Rave Roulette
Get drunk and act a fool with me
New York City we got that real grime gritty
And I want yall to love me, Like yall love [Biggie]
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing is right
The crown is always and forever, Frank White
So fuck yall niggas
Put the mask on, stick yall niggas
Then act like, yo who stuck yall niggas?
I'm the foulest nigga you gon' ever meet
Name bang on every street
Screwball, who hah hold heavy heat
You better prey to God we don't never meet
Leave you slumped over the wheel, blood on your leather seat
Brains on the passenger side of the window
Fuckin' with that ho, didn't get a chance to hit the dro
This is for the non-believers
Niggas want beef?
Niggas got to meet cleavers
Niggas want drama?
Niggas got the street sweeper
Niggas wanna squash it?
Fuck you, you get the finger

"The Bridge...Queensbridge..."[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
I keep it ghetto where it's grimey, grimey, you know how Bed-Stuy be
Throwing them block parties, building with God bodies
Before Dirty died, BK been lively
My project army, Red Hook been behind me
I spit jewels shiny, bright as Illuminati
The black owl see the white inside Colin Powell
Hitler and George Bush, they got you acting Nazi
I be a child of Israel, young Haile Selassie
Ghetto Government, ark of the covenant
A track with Rugged Man, I had to come fuck with it
JoJo, Remedy, Blaq Poet, running shit

[Verse 2: JoJo Pellegrino]
Mmm, that's how you comes with it? I fucks with it, yo
Pelle' keep it a thousand, a hundred percent
He got clout and a ton of respect
Never sold my soul, I leased to him when he cut me the check
Sit pretty, spitting ugly, I say this nice and clear
I'm the best that never did it, all them other guys is ehh
Unimpressed with the state of rap, I'mma help them embrace the fact
Move forward, take it back, shedding light, watch 'em fade to black
Blap, and fuck rappers that can't compare to me
They scared of me, Pelle' the streets, keep your ear to me

[Verse 3: Remedy]
I pop a pill, chill, sit back, release my anxiety
Got two exotic Colombian bitches on both sides of me
Make clothes, raid codes, Mr. Secret Society
I hate liars, this is the truth, there's no denying me
Fuck you, pay me what you owe me, let 'em know
Staten Island like Joey, I'm Israeli like Razah is
Young Haile Selassie, white Jew, never Nazi
There's black and white poets in hand, yo Rugged Man

[Verse 4: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Like Bo King cousin, bass in your face, displaying hate in the place
White folks hate me, I'm disgracing the race
Underground I hold the crown and I ain't gon' pass it
Every verse that I spit, I give birth to a classic
Am I ignorant? Hmm, maybe, hmm, probably, am I genius?
That's a possibility, possibly, as amazing
As I spit it's obvious, I'm the cockiest, I write hits
I don't need no Gwen Stefani's or Fergie white chicks
Kill the species of weak MC's, faggot rappers
I'm allergic to your sweetness like diabetes
Master of mack, and max relax and jab in slabber
You battle, you bagging your bitch, waving and bruising
Will leave in a broken ragged Caddy, babbling
Traveling, bullets splattering
Rat-a-tat shattering, I'm the Gracie family grappling, yup
And hating on me is like hating the truth
You can lie to yourself, but deep down you know I'm the truth

[Verse 5: Blaq Poet]
Why? Blaq Poet motherfucker
That's the name, and I'll, blow your troubles
Right out your brain, it's insane how I penetrate
Your dome piece, microphone fiend, fuck the police
I'm a known beast, I get it popping, I'm not stopping
Lyrical AK spray, got your body flip flopping
Yo, R.A., who the fuck want it?
I have these punks running back up in they mama stomach
I'm a real deal, straight from the gutter
Might fuck the hood, but you dumb motherfuckers
Ya'll can give it up, I don't give a fuck, just
Get out the way, I'm coming through like what, plus
The guns bust, no dust, no rust, trust
You better roll with the rush, don't oppose us
Or get crushed by the truck, all G's up
When the shit start you better not freeze up[Intro]
Sha
NYGz
Yo, this shit is so addicting, you heard?
I'm in recovery right now
Been in recovery for about 30 minutes
Fuck that recovery shit
Yo Preem, let's get high

[Intro: Shabeeno]
I've been an addict since the Microphone Fiend got me high
I had no defense, I ain't been sober since
It got it bad, the monkey on my back got the shakes
Make no mistakes, I need drums and breaks
A bassline I can ride on, get my high on
Gangster lean, I'm who the world got their eyes on
Mr. Relapse, be spitting raps to the youth
I know I'm the truth, I hold meetings in the booth
Like Bishop on the roof, I'm a falling star
I ain't learned 12 steps, keep 16 bars
[?] on the chase, dog, I can't slow down
I'm in the mix, I need my fix, and my flow got bounce
Ten Crack Commandments, I ain't reached five
Cause your boy stay high on his own supply
The rap shit's addictive, I can't let go
Think I'm going back to rehab, no, no, no

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"I'm just an addict, addicted to music"
"I gotta use it"
"Most notable, hip-hop quotable"
"Get biz on the mic like back in the days"
"I'm just an addict, addicted to music"
"I gotta use it"
"Most notable, hip-hop quotable"
"Get biz on the mic"

[Verse 2: Lil Fame]
I step inside of the booth mega hard
I'm like Cool J [?]
Premier's beats is mushrooms, dog
My mic check, one, two, get me higher than dust do
Just a hip-hop junky, since back in the day
Nigga [?], Hip-Hop Hooray
Hanging out with the older dudes getting drunk off Bacardi
Shit, I fuck around and steal a speaker out the party
Follow the leader that's criminal minded
Hard to earn, strictly business on the road to the riches
America's most wanted, nigga, too chubby to breakdance
Posted up in the G-boy stance
This is that old Brownsville [?]
[?] no plastic
I'm classic for you bastards that want the raw dog
Put your money through the hole, my nigga, cock and go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blaq Poet]
I got a rap addiction, you wouldn't believe
I need that shit, that's why I fuck with Preem
Been a fiend since Run-DMC's Adidas
Before Rakim kicked over the speakers
Y'all don't really know how bad I need it
I stay OD'ing, I'm undefeated
Back in the days, shit was serious
Treacherous Three, Flash with the Furious
Five niggas, Fearless Four was my niggas
Cold Crush and Crash Crew kept me high, nigga
I was rocking it on the school bus
Beating on the table, getting my fix at lunch
I don't really know but somebody said
This shit was dead, they need a dose for their head
Just listen to me cause I rhyme harder
I leave you like Pookie, smoked out in the Carter

[Hook]

[Outro: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Back in the days"[Poet]
Hot Day set it off!

[DJ Hot Day cuts]

[Poet]
Well I'm the Poet about set shit off
And all the microphone you know I get off
Rappers be warned that I'm not a joke
And if you fuck around, you might get something broke
I'm always prepared for warfare
And you can tell by the gear that I choose to wear
Timberlands, army pants, black hoodie
Strapped with a rap like that of a nine milli
I set it off when I want some action
There's always a rapper waiting for a waxin
Every MC: beware!
Poet's here and I just don't care
Back to attack and I'm on a mission
I mop up the stage with competition
So you're the competitor? I'm the predator
You want to get beat? Tell your manager to set it up
So we can go at it, you'll be splattered
And when I'm finished, you'll be another Poet addict
Strung out, all the rhymes I rung out
For even saying you can win, I should rip your tongue out
Nobody comes close, no matter how much they boast
They went gold but I still burn them like toast
I eat MC's and wash them down with a forty
Try to riff and I fuck you up shorty
Now you know it, the Poet is mo' betta
I'mma chill and leave it up to Cormega
Set it off

[DJ Hot Day cuts]

[Cormega]
Mega is scientist, metaphor analyst
Predator, I set it off like a terrorist
I accelerate like a four wheeler
And Hot Day supplies the bass like a drug dealer
I'm a architect and I spark the set
Like the Jamaican Posse flippin' in 'Marked for Death'
You're not ready for prime time, whenever I rhyme
I'm superior deteriorating your brain area
Busting your interior and exterior
Ripping the area like a pit terrier
I'm insane, Mega inflicts pain
I set it off like soldier in Fort Maine
Mutilate, assassinate and flip
My technology is like a microchip
Mega mic prototype
I kill static like Illmatic Ice
My device has long clip of infrared light
My brain's evil like the antichrist when I'm hyped
I leave the fucking mics smoking like bass pipes
Your crew gets bumrushed
My sound waves kick down the door like TNT in a drugbust
Cormega can never be imitated
Motivators fear the poetry I generated
When women get intimitated, I hit it
I get mega pussy, like in abortion clinic
It's mandatory, I'm self-explanatory
Don't front on me shorty, your man is working for me
When in effect I pull Tec and get wreck
Then step cause I'm Goodfella exec
Generator when strap rap activator
Terminator similar to Schwarzenegger
I deceive and disarm MC's
Living in suspended animation, your brain cells freeze
My mind designed like 'Nam
And I'mma let all proegees step off when I set it off

[DJ Hot Day cuts till the end]All types of situations
Everybody dealing their own shit
You know I'm saying

Yow, you know what, I give you 3 situations right now
A thief, a mobster and a bum
Bring the shit down

[Verse 1]
I'm just sitting here
Contemplating, yow, I'm tired of waiting
When one is God, the other one's satan
And he's telling me, "go get that money you gain"
And I'm telling him, "fuck you, I'm tryna win"
God is the only one keeping me sane
Keeping me from outside in the rain with them thangs
Busting niggas upside their mothafucking head
Taking their pat plus only little bread
Making the streets hot, making the heat pop
Not giving a fuck as long as I see gra
Everybody fool nobody move
Sticking everything, even the old crippled dude
That's foul! Yeah, I know that it is
So what, I even take candy from kids
On the mission without a pot to piss in
Hearing all kinds of voices, I'm tryin' not to listen

[Hook, 2x:]
It don't matter
The shit that you're facin
Everybody got their own situation
If you're livin in a mansion or a fuckin basement
Everybody got their own situation

[Verse 2]
Maybe I should go to church and find god
Before i end up dead or behind bars
Look for a legit job, quit the mob
Before the DEA get some new shit to charge
The street's more than just watching us attacking
Every time i tryna leave, I find my way back in
The feds got my phone tapped, tryna peep
Who's really my pits (??), who's running the streets
Wife be mad, she calling me a creep
Paparazzi caught me on the beach with some freaks
I can't worry about that right now
A new family's in town, they tryna get down

[Hook, 2x:]
It don't matter
The shit that you're facin
Everybody got their own situation
If you're livin in a mansion or a fuckin basement
Everybody got their own situation

[Verse 3]
I'm just minding my business not bothering you
Looking through the garbage can for some food
Looking for a nice warm place to sleep
Go down to the subway and bits to streets
I gave up hope a long time ago
Straight from the war, right the skid row
I still hear people screaming in the dark
I still smell the burned body parts
I'm mentally unfit, but who gives a shit
Not the government, not the president
Only time people care is on the holidays
So leave me alone and just let me go my way
And be happy that you ain't me
Some people are scared and some people hate me
People feel what they don't understand
What would you do if you was that homeless man?

[Hook, 2x:]
It don't matter
The shit that you're facin
Everybody got their own situation
If you're livin in a mansion or a fuckin basement
Everybody got their own situation
