It's all about the Benjamins baby
It's all about the Benjamins baby

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Now, what y'all want to do
Want to be ballers, shot callers, brawlers
Who be dipping in the Benz with the spoilers
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Trying to get my hands on some Grants like Horace
Yeah living the raw deal, three course meals; spaghetti, fettuccine and veal
But still everything's real in the field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for trying to bury
Seven zeros over in Rio Di Janeiry
Ain't nobody's hero, but I want to be heard
On your Hot 9-7 every day, that's my word
Swimming in women with they own condominiums
Five plus fives, who drive Millenniums
It's all about the Benjamins, what
I get a fifty pound bag of eu for the mutts
Five carats on my hands with the cuts
And something European chromed out with the clutch, what

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I want it all figured out, fuck being a broke nigga
Drinking malt liquor, driving a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers
Lost your touch we kept ours, popping Cristals
Freaking the three-quarter reptiles
Enormous cream, forest green Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'm a scheme
We see through, that's why nobody never going to believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews
Don't let the melody intrigue you
Because I leave you, I'm only here
For that green paper with the eagle

[Verse 3: Sheek]
I'm strictly trying to cop those colossal sized Picasso's
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's
Mienda, with cash flowing like Sosa
And the Latin chick transporting in the chocha
Stampeding over, pop Mo's, never sober
Lex and Range Rovers dealing weight by Minnesota
Avoiding narcs with camcorders and Chevy Novas
Stash in the building with this chick named Alona
From Daytona, when I was young I want to bone her
But now I only hit chicks that win beauty pageants
Tricking and taking me skiing, at the Aspens
Gangsta mental, stay popping Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown
Pinkie ringing, gondolas with the man singing
Italian music down the river with your chick clinging
To my bizzalls, player you mad false
Acting hard when you as pussy as RuPaul

[Hook]
It's all about the Benjamins baby
It's all about the Benjamins baby
Now, what y'all want to do
It's all about the Benjamins baby
Want to be ballers, shot-callers
It's all about the Benjamins baby
Brawlers, who be dipping in the Benz with the spoilers
It's all about the Benjamins baby
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
What the blood clot
Want to bumble with the Bee huh
Bzzz throw a hex on the whole family
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Have your friends singing "this is for my homies"
And you know me from making niggas so sick
Floss in my six with the 'Lex on the wrist
If it's murder, you know she wrote it
German Ruger for your ass bitch, deep throat it
Know you want to fill the room because it's platinum coated
Take your pick, got a firearm you should've toted
Suck a dick all that bullshit you kick
Player hating from the sideline
Get your own shit, why you riding mine
I'm a Goodfella kinda lady
Stash 380s in Mercedes, Puffy hold me down baby
Only female in my crew and I kick shit
Like a nigga do, pull the trigger too, fuck you!

[Verse 5: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I been had skills, Cristal spills
Hide bills in Brazil, about a mill' the ice grill
Make it hard to figure me liquor be kicking me
In my asshole, undercover Donnie Brasco
Left my East Coast girl the Bentley to twirl
My West coast shorty, push the chrome 740
Rocking Redman and Naughty, oh where's my kitty cat
Half a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at
And I'm living that fo' life, we push weight
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes at Penn State
Listen close it's Francis, the praying mantis
Attack with the Mac, my left hand spit, right hand
Grip on the whip, for the smooth getaway
Player haters get away or my lead will spray
Squeeze off til I'm empty, don't tempt me
Only to Hell I send thee, all about the Benji's
What

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
It's all about the Benjamins baby
(repeat)[DMX, (Sheek)]
(Yea I'm right here dog) Where my dogs at
(We right here dog) Where my dogs at
(I'm right here dog)

[DMX]
What must I go through to show you shit is real
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggas feel
Rob and I steal, not cause I want to cause I have to
And don't make me show you what the MAC do
If you don't know by now then you slipping
I'm on some bullshit that's got me jacking, niggas flipping
Let my man and them stay pretty and I'ma stay shitty
Cruddy it's all for the money, is you wit' me?
Get the bitches, and I'll commit the crime
And when it's on we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it wit them we'll take your cap
Bust it off dusting off the softest niggas
Money with the biggest mouth, yo let's off this nigga
A novice nigga never made a sound
Breath too fucking hard and you're getting bust down

[Hook x2: Sheek] + (DMX)
Yo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)
(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)

[DMX]
Nowadays it ain't looking to good for certain niggas, I'm hurting niggas
(What you doing?) Robbing niggas, jerking niggas, sticking niggas
Cause they deserve it; when money got murdered
They know he died slow cause they heard it
The nigga ain't blew up the spot a while
And the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while
It just takes a light up to fuck the night up
Blow everything in sight up, fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
When you mention some shit you wasn't able to stand
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand
The days are longer and seems like I'm facing time
I've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasing mine
I soak it all up like a sitting fly
Cause nowadays getting by, nothing more than an occasional meal and getting high
I live to die, That's where I'm headed
Let your man hold something, now it's all about you can get it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
Well in the back wit ya faggot ass face down
Lucky that you breathing, but you dead from the waist-down
The fuck is on your mind? Talking that shit that you be talking
And I bet you wish you never got hit cause you be walking
But shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wondering how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under their eyes like a surprise to the guys
That one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
Fucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holla at you yo Baltimore shit (ah-oh!)
Knahmean? I'm just robbing to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbing the street
When we're starving, we eat whatever's there
Come on you know the code in the street; whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, menas your man couldn't walk
After the talk, about him not being 11-33 to New York
Transforming-ass niggas'll get it quick
And yo for real that nigga K {Solo} can suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me
Cause when I blow shit up, I have niggas falling like white bitches in a scary movie
AHHH! You know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas it's like: "Protected by Viper, stand back"
What's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented
The fuck you want me to do with this coward? Finish him, it's ended
(*EXPLOSION*)[Verse 1: Sheek]
Yo, ayo let's get papers and pop Mo' with hoes up in skyscrapers
In condiminiums, overlooking our drug capers
New York City, know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar, so we can front up in the 850
My whole committee like to puff L's and look jiggy
Who wan' test this? My semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin through
I got niggas who PUMP on yo' block and in your spot
Who sit next to you? Protectin you?
But they'll murder you, playa
Don status, nigga we gettin chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis, fronting, fronting in eclipsesis

[Verse 2: Mase]
Ayo, Mase and The Lox
We taking knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The Rikers, Sing Sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays, spray strays wit niggas' names on it
Often I bug, then we'll soften a thug
Have a chump coughing blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a Tec at Mason, have a explanation
You bring your crew and em and I'm doing em
Then I'm beating 'em down with aluminum
Then I'm putting two in 'em
You can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelevant

[Hook x2]
[Styles] If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
[DMX] Niggas done started somethin'
[Styles] You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
[DMX] Niggas done started somethin'

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, check out the kid that get coke like Sosa
Never turned down chocha, be in the Costa
Rica, sipping margaritas wit a mami
Cleaning my Tommy, showing love to my army
Whenever The Lox find rippy blocks, we kill 'em
Yeah I hear niggas, but I still don't feel 'em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissin' us
My 16's be so real
You can feel em in your vain like Ramello's pops from Sugarhill
J be the cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spittin clips at your face
We started from the bottom, you'll see beg niggas' pardon
Whatever, we can do it at the Garden
Word life, this shit is real, b
I'm making niggas blow trial even if they not guilty

[Verse 4: Styles]
I want a palace for my thugs, with oriental rugs
Green bags from drugs, get wacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only getting up, splitting up your anatomy
Official Lox family, grants niggas handing me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table, planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you're smartest, and retaliate the hardest
Regardless, if you're a thug or a rap artist
Respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffin Nestle
Any of y'all niggas done starting something
Actin invincible like you God or something
If you God, then I'ma make salat til you rot
And if you a playa, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start busting off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark

[Hook]

[Verse 5: DMX]
Don't came at me wit no bullshit, use caution
Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion and racketeering
Got niggas fearin, fuck whatchu heard, this what you hearing
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so give me 3 feet
Cause when we creep, no more than 3 deep, niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be putting on that tag on your toe
Now who gon' tell your mother, her baby's under a cover
In the morgue, stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs
Son of a hardheaded nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got what you came for
(What's that?) Surgery wit the chainsaw
I hit the fucking streets
Cause, like I said before, ain't nothing going down until I eat
Mu'fuckers think it's all about impressing bitches and stressing bitches
Well, I'm testing bitches game, undressing bitches, and caressing bitches
And dealing wit mu'fuckers on all level, what I'm dealing with is all devils
Fucking with snakes running with niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas and scary niggas get it all the time
Cause what they got is all of mine, your man was talking shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck witchu
And if you wit my man, then he getting stuck witchu
And gave it the money, cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest then I tossed the nine
Boss of crime, black Gotti, I stack bodies wit the black shotty
Bitch-ass niggas who act snotty
Get it

[Outro]
These niggas is for real
These niggas ain't playin

This ain't no fuckin game
You think we playin?
Ruff Ryders
Grrrrrr[Hook - Eminem]
Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams
Where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers
Panhandlers, hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun don't shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Say every city's got a ghetto, every ghetto's got a hood
Take a good look around you cause there's a D-Block near you

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Place where ain't nobody that proud, it's a fucking black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Working around though, cause if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
5 minutes flat, the whole town know
Lotta assuming in niggas' salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body is technicality
Other than that catch 'em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening and catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but the older they get
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick
We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say 'em exquisite
Anytime you can pay us a visit

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Eminem]
Welcome to D-Block, the mighty mighty D-Block
The place in New York City where Diddy won't even walk
Its D-Block, the part of Yonkers I wouldn't be caught
Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
D-Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walking
Stick up kids every block who watch for every opportunity
As soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you won't even notice your mind will be so
Preoccupied with that new watch you just copped
You won't even see that ride pulling up alongside you
You'll be shot 'fore you even realize you were spied on for three blocks
D-Block the place where O.G.'s get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked
You won't even see cops, hip-hop police don't even stop
On D-Block, where everybody wants to be 'Pac
And you can get popped over the new G-Unit Reeboks

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Sheek Louch]
If you bust and your gun got niggas on the run
And you rep where you from nigga you D-Block
And you trying to come up and your pockets is light as a cup
And don't give a fuck, you D-Block
Aiyo bang bang nigga, let's get it on
Always been a monster, but its worse now that my son's been born
And every nigga where I be, I put in work for free
It's D-Block mothafucka, hey yo grab this P

[Verse 4 - Styles P]
Welcome to D-Block, a place where little niggas is killas
And the mother's raising the sons to turn into gorillas
And the hallways is pissy as hell, all we do is get bigger
More ignorant, you send us to jail
My niggas shoot anything that'll move
Sell drugs, from the rise to the sun to the fall of the moon
I'd die the way I stand with my man if I can when the shells come
This is D Block, ya'll welcome[Intro - Jadakiss]
Yeah, D-Block
Everywhere we go-oh, people wanna know-oh
Who we arrrre, so we tell them
This is D-Block, mighty mighty D-Block

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Yo, the revolve' or the mati's cool
Knife game like Daddy Cool's, since Bally Shoes
This is real life street shit, truest and the deepest
Known niggas that go to jail just to get they teeth fixed
Think I give a fuck what you herbs say?
When I got the nigga that you trying to be watching my wordplay
Now everybody wanna be 'Pac
Till they ass really get popped and they die on the third day
The Desi's got a beautiful ring
I can hit any one of y'all, options a beautiful thing
Body is finished, maybe they can save the tooth
Call me Kiss or call me the black Babe Ruth
That many hits -- fuck that, that many bricks
D-Block -- that many niggas, gats to your lips
My dope is two toned, but I had to change my spot
Cause it turned into a drug free school zone

[Hook]
[Jadakiss] J.A.D.A
I'm top 5, dead or alive
And that's just off one LP

[Jae Hood] Jae Hood
[Styles P] Two guns up
[Jae Hood] All I know is bitches and money, grams and guns
[Styles P] Here's why they call me the Ghost

[Verse 2 - Sheek Louch]
Yo, I don't give a fuck about pull out, cock back
Spin a motherfucker out, empty his chest
Leave your motherfucking whip a mess
All over the dashboard, in backseat pieces of flesh
Send niggas to the grave with they face half gone
Stomach ripped open, the beef back on
That nigga Sheek rude, I'll spit in your food
Tell the women in ya family to suck my dick
No respect, fuck that -- I'll murder you quick
Mad weapons in the trunk, bitch -- take your pick
Stick a grenade up under your fender
Stick a pineapple bomb in ya blender, I don't care about you
You say fuck Sheek Louch? Well, fuck you too
Your father, your mother, the hole you came through
Niggas don't learn till they're kerosene-d out
Lighter to their face, they'll spit gasoline out
You want me dead, I'm right here -- do it bitch
Make me bleed till I'm motherfucking fluid-less
I ain't new at this and don't give a fuck about you
Sheek'll run up and smack the shit out you
I live this shit, it's never gon' stop
Open niggas' face with a octopus top
Face all ripped up, catch me on the block
Shells all loaded up, catch me wit the Glock
Pussy motherfuckers don't want no beef
Trip niggas down to their platinum teeth
Chase you in the house with the all black heat
Leave you just boxers and slippers on your feet
I talk reckless; I really want the coke and the money
But I'll settle for your necklace
D-Block

[Verse 3 - Jae Hood]
I grew up as a young dude, chilling wit them old cats
Couldn't cop crack so I had to slang Prozac
Fuck being broke, I'm trying to cop a tan four
Trap you up like niggas get Pussy in The Sopranos
You really want beef? I'm busting the Tec
I'll hit you up in the park while you're doing your sets
It's (Jadakiss: D-Block) (yeah yeah y'all!)
You can't get no streeter, nigga
I'm nice wit the hands but I'm better wit the heater
Old school style -- stash haze in my sock
I'll bust at you and turn your Ac' Jeep to a drop
You niggas talking like y'all can't get stuck up
I ain't an icon but y'all will still get fucked up

[Verse 4 - Styles P]
As we continue on, your hood you finish
Write a suicide note and get a window on
Nigga, that's the type of shit we on
Redrum Redrum -- spin it back like a Missy song
Take a cold heart to twist your mom
But it's wintertime, shotty under the snorkle
Will flip when it's dinner time
Strange days without Angela Bassett
Middle of the hood, niggas handling plastic
Gotta watch ya head and not get popped with lead
And watch ya bread, not get popped by Feds
Anywhere we gonna be in the hood
With the burners and the hawks, nigga, being the hoodAnd I'm nice like B.I.G. is
I'm the greatest of all time
I'mma say it just like Ali did

[Hook]
The champ is here

You fuckin wit the champion (you already know)

[Jadakiss]
Niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just wanna rock for a century
And then chase the book wit the documentry
If you can't do nothing other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from blow, lets go
Don't make me put your heart on your lap
Fuck ridin a beat nigga, I parallel park on a track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In a six but it's a BM and its Pepsi blue
And I don't know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fuckin wit Jason
After I cash in there's really no justification
Of how I'm gon change tha game
So don't get outta line cause this little nine will change your frame
Motherfucka, aha

[Hook]
The champ is here
The champ is here

[Jadakiss]
Y'all never gon touch the kid (kiss of death)
They gon have to get me at the top
Y'all never gon touch the kid (gangsta kiss)
No love this time nigga, kiss of death
Yo I ain't got time to be up here lyin to you
Just make sure y'all niggas feel what we tryin to do
If I fuck up then it's on me
Besides that it is what it is and that's what it just gon be
Blowin my purple, wish you would go in my circle
If you know my record is clean, you know I'mma merk you
I live like a warrior do
Without screamin true story, niggas know my story is true
The cribs, the cars, the jury, the spots I got
The money that pass my hand and the rocks I chop
The ammo, the artillery, the knifes I bought
Waking up sore the next day from fights I fought
In the hood cuz I fuck wit the thugz
Tryin to figure out, why the money never added up to the love
Gun in my waist, dutch in my hand
And I don't do a lot of talkin, I listen as much as I can

[Hook]
The champ is here (aha)
The champ is here (yea)
The champ is here (that's right)

No love this time nigga, (tell em kiss)

The champ is here
The champ is here
The champ is here
The champ is here[Verse 1: Styles P]
All I ever knew was kingpins and gangstas
Life start to change when you sitting around bankers
Investors, back when the Benz made the compressor
I compress my weed and never lost the texture
Went to get 50, they threw me 50 extra
Highly appreciate the real strong gesture
School of Hard Knocks, I never failed a semester
Fully loaded 9 with the big Winchester
Louch sold coke, Kiss sold coke
I sold coke, we all sold dope
Right around the time I couldn't look at my old folks
On my block shit, pop shit, getcha nose broke
Fuck around, let a shot fly
Ain't a minute of the day that I'm not high
Real nigga, I ain't switch up yet
We load heavy, hope Chevy make the pick up 'vette
Whether blood or a crip, yeah I stick up sets
So I used too, now I'm getting money off of juice too
I'm international, not rational
You do what I say or you do what I ask you too
Looking at the work like I get shit off
Looking at the hammer like I set shit off
Take head shots so you can take that vest shit off
LOX nigga, know we keep the best shit dog

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Hip-Hop depreciates the value of luxury
Personally, I won't allow you to fuck with me
15 a sack, bundles is 150
You just had to be there, the money would come quickly
Very obedient with the cake
Cause I'm the ingredients in the cake
One place you'd never see me is by the Jake
Big cigars, martini's by the lake
You still get a hundred by the face
My connect still speak no ingles
Says a lot about you if you hating me
Turn a little bit of dough into a bakery
Bunch of copycats, a lot of fakery
Becoming a monster, that's cause you making me
I just wanna know who else is this strong
Generating this amount of money for this long
Shots pass your crew
Yellow gold kilo, Yacht Master ii
Get your Wallys dipped so the top match the blue
Couple more shots I might blast ya boo
Can't judge so they rape this shit
I stand behind mine, got faith in it
I just sell it, I don't make this shit
I got work to do, I got cake to get

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Cake, Cake, Cake, Cake, Cake, Cake
It's hard to see the Snakes, Snakes, Snakes, Snakes
They ain't thugs, they Jake, Jake, Jake, Jakes
Find their bodies in the bottom of these great lakes
Do I think he the king?
Never that bruh, hol' up give that nigga a dap
Now these lame ass artists gotta think when they rap
Its almost back to the boom bap
It's no lyrical apps to download when I walk the ground fold
I'm heavy out the Chevy I dump for reload, DONNIE
Was something out a magazine
Pretty bitch whip something out a magazine
Gun on me, clip? Nah that's a magazine
I make money flip easy, no trampoline
I done made a millie, P and Kiss made a millie
Hood could of if he wasn't acting silly
But no hard feelings
I ain't even in the hood now, no more chilling
Chasing money, jumping off the tour bus posing for IG flicks
All around these chicks
I ain't OG, it's Rakim and Kane and them
I came right before Baby and Wayne and them
All these new niggas spit more pain than them
LOX, it'll never be the same as themUhh, hahah, Ruff Ryders niggas (all my niggas)
(All aboard!) Blood in blood out
Funk Doc, Sheek Luc', Meth-Tical (whattup niggas?)
Yo, yo, aiyyo yo

[Sheek]
Soon as I cop the nine, I pop the nine
When I take it out the box, I represent LOX
Now when I flow, you hit the rewind button
So I charge out more, want it all at the door
Fuck heat, Sheek walk around with an oven
Who you gonna kill with that little Foreman grill?
How its gon' look when I come through your block?
Sheek, Funk Doc, Meth on top
Porsche, 300 horse fly by
Back open pumpin "How High?" (How High)
Yeah, can y'all see that (See that)
Bitch you can call me what you want, 'cuz "I'll Be Dat" (Be dat)
Get off my dick, I don't care about no jewels
Long as the condo's paid and the truck I choose
I'm tellin y'all niggas, if its not double R
I'mma spell my name out on the side of your car

[Hook]
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on nooooowwwww
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on nooooowwwww

[Redman]
I got a twin cam exhaust connected to the jaw
A five speed clutch on my paw when I write
I glow like the pegs in Lite-Brite
3000 volts of lightning when you fly the right kite
Me and Meth be Hennessy, two ice cubes
We can draw (choose your weapons) or do I choose?
When I choose the grip, one shot lose your hip
I hope your shoes fit for this move and pick
I avalanche your camp with, ten feet of snow
I'm cold blooded, my fam half-eskimo
My flows move like indo;
Turn ten nickels to ten loads, outta ten sto's
Ride the crash course, do the math on it
Swizz Beats you can ride Amtrak on it
But I'm on it, grillin with George Foreman
Ya peeps is at the Grammy Awards cornin
The ice, the fat wallet son, I want it
And the helicopter warmin before mornin
Def Jam nigga, Redman nigga
Got - "fuck ya momma" on my sweat band nigga
You tough guys'll get smacked in the club
COme with the gun I bought from Mack in the club
Its P-P-P from Bricks to Brook-nam (C'mon)
(C'mon) Bring me some more ass to whoop on

[Hook]

[Method Man]
Look what the cat dragged in
Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror
Scoop of high yellow Cinderella, Meth forever
Never rush a rhyme, hope to never bust my nine
But if I have to, I have to, it's all in the mind
I stay ahead of time while y'all fallin behind
Tryin to relight ya lime
It's a crime when I drop bomb lines designed
To tick, tick, BOOM blow your mind
Yeah me, M-E-T, H, the O, the D
Can't be done, like tryin to find a penny in the sea
Nigga run, for cover son go and get them guns
Y'all ain't from here, don't try to come around here gettin ones
Swizz Beat the track in the head, but I instead
Pull my dart gun and bust sixteen until it's dead
I'm the game, all of my dogs be off the chain
Yellin Wu.. Tang, Wu.. Tang

[Hook](Intro)(Sauce Money + Ras Kass + Sheek Louch)
(S) What we going to do right we going to start this mother fucker of in

Side style you know
(R) (West side)

[Verse One: Sauce Money]
I spit solely for the guacamole
Come through and make a rapper do a back flip rock a rolly and
Reach for my Glock slowly if you try to interfere on how I stack chips
I take chicks to the tele just a happy fan
Now she wanna get a glimpse of my magic hand
She said she like the way it stretch out like plastic man
Sauce money tell me where would you have it land
Told shorty look I got to get back to my grands
Hurry up I am in the rush like jackie chan
Married woman, single or engaged, hood rats still got them to creep
Now we rock them to sleep
Because we got the best songs that pesese charm
Besides if you tricky you just chance head strong
Rappers better respect dons and ex-cons
And keep your vest on this is how we speak with teflon

[Verse Two: Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo it's Sheek Louch nigga and I will pop till y'all gone
Only thing I knew niggas popped and it's gone
And y'all might pop shit but that's about it
What you know about guns that come out my sleeve
And bullets that fly around your head like bee's
That will hit you and leave holes the size of pee's jes
When I flow it's like tae-kwon-doe
On some do-jo and it just a hobby
How fuck Daniel-san going to beat Mr. Miyagi
Wax on wax off with a knock out or better
I leave three through the E of your Enyce sweater
What pop shit and I am first day delivery
Straight threw your chest pope on your block
In a big brown truck like I am ups
And I don't know about y'all that re-up real small
You don't spend more then a thousand at the mall
If you owe sheek pay me I don't care how you hit me
It don't race me if your car don't cost more then fifty
I'm that cat that threatens on y'all mc's
With a devil flow that will pop your rosary beeds
I from where bitches that know about cooking up coke
Bring ever gram back and keep heat by the twat
That will blend in perfect in a deminacan spot
Now it's me that nigga that shine like glitter
And I must say dogg I am a hell of a spitter
We finish things y'all hell of a quiters

[Verse Three: Ras Kass]
I spit from the genitals bitch, leave 'em masculine skinch
Got niggas panackin, petro and penanican flinch
Grew a mechanical inch the root of all evil
Green theft and green spray with a tech but we can't all eat thow
Cause y'all fethal, we run lethal, homicide victims of Fairfax and Pico
Sugar nobody is ever equal [why] cause the more we make
The more we taking from other people
Livin in puerto rico padarin LAX to JFK
At baggage claim with three hoes like Santa's day
My third eye be the equivilant to the album red pie
So I give you a piece of my mind, just multiply times infinite
Spiritual elevate so I high commite drive bye's while I sky dive
Sip on my time perform shit only concieved in sci-fi so why try test
It's boom bye bye Mr. Ice real guy
You must have been looking some where else like biggie smalls lazy eye
Pop sicker then your average Acquired Immune Deficiency Symdrome infected fast

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
We don't care where your from nigga east or west
And we don't care what you wear we don't aim for the vest
It's lox, sauce and Ras Kass three of the best
Only niggas with money we don't fuck with the rest
We don't care where your from nigga east or west
And we don't care what you wear we don't aim for the vest
It's lox, sauce and Ras Kass three of the best
Only niggas with money we don't fuck with the rest ya heard

[Ras Kass]
It's like that nigga and it's always gonna be like that so you peeon as niggas
I got a new word for you y'all niggas boon walk that mean beat it backwards
Fuck out of here nigga the matrix Sheek Louch my nigga Sauce Money Ras Kass
Blaze sky walker nigga the matrix get the fuck out of here[Verse 1: Styles P]
Hell yea I'm pullin' my thang out, you gettin' banged out
Bitch nigga, you shit done came out
Kick it with a 914 nigga, four niggas beefin'
Guess what? my 914 niggas
I warn niggas like whoever will come through
My shit stay kicking so I'm calling it kung fu
Master my own style, punk show 'em what gun do
I'm lethal like a heroin bundle, yea
The beat rocks from Pete Rock, the flow from the ghost from D-Block
Four pounds send you to Esau, in other words Jesus Christ
Man, my shit stick together like beans and rice
All I need is weed at nights to smoke and rhyme
And I'm probably the nicest nigga to breathe in light
And can't nobody prove me wrong, I'm to strong
And the motherfuckin' street niggas need me right

[Hook: Pete Rock]
Ayo fuck what you heard and what you thought you saw
Been all over the world reppin' 914
Styles P and Sheek Louch, they wild fo' sure
Been all over the world reppin' 9-1-4

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Raised in the ghetto singing songs for survival
Late night, Valhalla, rollin' out the bible
914, every corner store got a nigga with the raw
Just bring your straw
Piff by the O’s, pussy galore
Little thief bitches get the monkeys out the store
Shit look real but a nigga ain’t sure, yo
You know a real nigga when you see him
Jewelry dripping, white tee, you wanna be him
Burner on him and don’t care about freedom
Bitches with him, other girls wanna' beat him
I’m trynna' stay alive, what up Mount Vernon?
Rest in peace two-five, Pete with the knot
Who else to ask for but Sheek from D-Block
Two guns down, calico up
I’m done here, pass my cup

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Nigga I get fresh like Easter
Who wanna get sliced like pizza, while I light my reefer?
You could come through with your crew nigga
Burner go through niggas
One shot is knockin’ off two niggas
I might come through with the Uzi, shoot niggas
Filmin' on Fuji, put the shit in a movie
Who wanna' get burned with a loose?
Black tie affair, I grown up
You get stomped with the Gucci’s
You oughta' be playin’ me two feet
I don’t need five, I gotta' knife you ain’t leavin' alive
I said the green and cream Beamer is mine, the Z8
I see hate, you get the three-eight right in your eye
Yo Pete, play this shit for the street
Niggas licking they heat, got a brick in the whip on the seat
Them niggas no different than me, so they listen to me
I understand all the shit that they see, what

[Hook] (x2)[Intro]
Turn it up (turn it up)
Swizz Beats the monster
(Fix ya face, Ruff Ryders)
LET'S DO IT
(D-Block) E-V-E, Styles P. and Sheek
(Wassup, wassup)
LET'S DO IT

[Verse 1] (Sheek)
Walk wit ya nigga, hawk wit ya nigga
I came to shut it down
Ski mask and four pound
Baby grenades, we deep like baby parades
D-Block I'm gon sharpen ya blades
Let's get it on
Videos with bullets flying through Korn
Blaow! Footage turn ya camcords on
It's the underground nigga with bricks, nigga with dough
A nigga fucking all y'all chicks, you know
I'm a gangster and a gentleman too, P
I'll lay a nigga down and send his moms a bouquet for free
I could start a pet store with these birds
I'm the rap Donald Goines with words
Still rob y'all herbs (And I came to)
Hit the club on my dick, light up a blunt
Thug a bitch out, I got the mud in the front
I got the flight jacket, came with wings
When I chase you to the roof
Clappin' at ya ass with one of them things

(Chorus: Eve & Styles)
I gots to live by my pride
Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
Cause I came to shut down the game

(Sheek)
And I gots to hold down this heat
Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash

[Verse 2] (Eve)
Yo, I was determined to sell
And not because I'm just a bunny with a fluffy tail
Had to prove that I could live hard and spit hard
Just a bonus that I'm cute and get ya dick hard
See, I ain't never lettin' mine go
I'mma be here forever with my dogs as the time go
And I know we makin' niggas sick
We in they face everyday every way and they can't handle it
Streets choosin' Double R realest niggas out no confusion
Cats don't want it over here--have you heard
S.P. ain't for games little boy lesson learned
I suggest you stay far from my nigga's face
Hop back go hard all day in a nigga's face
You see, you cowards ain't a threat to us really
Just figured that we let you know that testin' us is silly
Good luck, y'all---Naw forreal, fuck y'all

(Chorus: Eve & Styles)
I gots to live by my pride
Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
Cause I came to shut down the game

(Sheek)
And I gots to hold down this heat
Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash

[Verse 3] (Styles)
I live by my pride, I could never be broke
I'mma Ruff Ryde or die catch me bein' with dope
Smokin' weed in the hoopty with the three in the coat
Cause my ace boon-koon got a connect
Told me send a hundred bundles to the day room soon
If the shit go right, he know that it will
We'll be cash, he'll be movin' straight weight through June
But back to this rap shit who thug it the most
It'll take the whole coast just to fuck wth the ghost
He done shut down the game, shit on ya name
If you ain't hold down the street or bust off ya heat
Then me and you is different, we ain't get it the same
And I represent niggas who live it, keep askin' for it
And I represent niggas who give it
This a D-Block Ruff Ryder, Holiday Styles
Cock sucker and I don't give a fuck about you

(Chorus: Eve & Styles)
I gots to live by my pride
Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
Cause I came to shut down the game

(Sheek)
And I gots to hold down this heat
Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash[Intro: Swizz Beatz (Styles P)]
(Yo Swizz! This is the tree-mix!)
Yeah, smoke, now
S.P. c'mon (L.O.X.!) S.P. c'mon
Ghost - it's showtime, it's showtime! (Swizzie!)
Ghost - lighters in the air!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
I wanna roll somethin up so
I-I can just blow, my mind (lighters in the air!)
I wanna, blow my mind (hey, hey, hey - lighters in the air!)
Blow my mind (hey, hey, lighters in the air!)
You should roll somethin up so
You can just um, blow, your mind (blow your mind!)
You should just blow your mind (hey, hey, lighters in the air!)
Blow your mind (hey, hey, lighters in the air!)

[Jadakiss]
AH-HAH! Yo, I already got it, they want power
Pump haze, blow sour, top floor of the Trump Towers
They style is nasty, that's why they want ours
Sign my name in the book, send y'all chumps flowers
Light it if it's exotic and blow it 'til it's gone
They find out who got it then cop a whole jawn
Say I didn't warn ya
Roll a couple up at the same time so the cypher can go around longer
In weed terms I'm a couple pounds stronger
All I need is one more connect, California
And I ain't gon' rush, I'mma take my time
Stay on my grind, and, just blow my mind

[Hook]

[Sheek Louch]
Silverback! Uhh
Stacks of money, big Cohiba, call me Eddie Cheeba
Granddaddy blazin, Sheek Louch amazin
Coupe Caucasian, system Asian, seats Italian
And the medallion, I'll be fuckin stylin
Answer this - who you know better than 'Kiss?
Better than P, better than the Silver-B
Back gorilla, Apollo filler, guarded twice
Just that nice, look at the ice
Now look at the hammer
I want cheese like you in front of the damn camera, 'til I see the slammer
Black Chuckers, one bubble, the God is here
I hit the block, they put they LIGHTERS IN THE AIR!

[Hook]

[Styles P]
I get (Red-man) to (B-Real), my (Method Man) is (Luniz)
I (Snoop) around, watch a channel live in the boonies
Forgot where the telly is, and I lost the room key
The green might ruin me
Need a few quarters, few waters and some trail mix
Peanut butter and jelly, I'm tryin to tell you real shit
Hit the studio, blow, go and lay some ill shit
Hit my boy Swizz like, we gon' make the ill mix
People wanna ask if The Lox broke up
That's like S.P. the Ghost bein not smoked up
And I'm back to the head
Cause I don't need the germs from the worms, don't pass cause I'm stackin the bread

[Hook]

[Swizz Beatz]
You should roll somethin up so you can just um, blow, your mind[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Uh-huh

[Ghostface Killah]
Greasy, razor blades, shots spray, military
Armor, keep blaze packed, all day, dog's day
Groundhog Day, ya'll bitch niggas got sweet hands, word
I know why, why? Ya'll all gay, pop off head
Get your top rocked, way across state
The pamphlet read, from seven to nine, don't hold that weight
Ya'll just bait, I'm a fisherman, I own this lake
When I catch fish, I fry 'em, to they backside flake
I smash ya'll muthafuckas like a seedless grape
And hang niggas like some ceiling fans in K-Mart plates
Feel me? Shake double earthquakes, give thanks, give shanks
Word to my momma, I cut the grass on you fucking snakes
Expose, don't tell, use a mo', round the way
Go-Go down, gone with the wind, he's a he-she
Bitch ass nigga for sale, like Magilla
Standing in the window, with a sign, "Yes, I fuck men, though"

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah (Sheek Louch)]
Aiyo, Sheek (What up, dog?)
Stab one of them niggas, nigga, word up!

[Sheek Louch]
Aiyo, my niggas is wetted, they drunk and they trying to eat
The hammers on 'em, and they ain't out looking for meat
I'm jumping out cars, I'm giving you permanent scars
Your hardest nigga, you can't compare him to ours
I'm sitting on crates, I'm missing probation dates
I'm stuck with this weight, my wifey period late
I'm hot as fuck, my truck keep getting tailed
It's like every week, one of mines getting jailed
Forgetting bail, piss test failed
Got parole on us, then wanna roll on us
I'm at my momma crib sleep, who told on us?
I'm sick to death, I'm on fire in the streets
Like in Back to the Future, when the car left
Ghost'll clap for me, fuck, rap for me
Yo, tell them niggas on the Island, get strapped for me
Het wet ya, and throw the stocking
On his face, like when he first met cha

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, me and Sheek drug heads like a bottle of Goose
I had my road dogs follow your troops
Gorilla game, African tribe, Somalian crew
With a flow so sick, my high temperature'll body the flu
Crack heads get knocked out, right in front of the school
Slap 'em Sheek, wake his ass up, he can't even move
Cereal box is crack and ratchets, in the cocaine spot
My fiends'll box filled with coke head classics
Dope money, flood me rags of kush, heavy drags
Bodegas, I'm mad, my older sister Patty's a butch
Guns come out like my mother's teeth, watch how I'm throwing heat
The leg gravy be steaming over smothered beef
From eight-ball jackets to cops and robbers
My last drug run, I threw in two bricks to garbage
I wash my money in Woolite, dunyy, sippin' on Folgers
Black jewels trucking, still come through bummy(Boom Bap original Rap) --> screwed!!
Blacksaun
Hmm .. L.o.x  D Block --- D Block!!!
New York put it on the map
Strip club she put it on my lap
Popping bottles and hookah they forgot about that [Boom Bap, Original Rap]
Chorus
Getting money, fresh still loving that
[Boom bap Original Rap]

Ah men! Eh yoh! KRS We got from here Big Bro!

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
I pull up on your block
Music up CL Smooth and Pete Rock on Niggas.. funk DOC on Niggas
I ain't taking you back, still holding the mack
Getting money really we don't give a f**k how you rap
I'm just here to represent that NY
Represent Y.O
I make the homie proud from Bed Stuy
BDP Standing at the windows with the AK
Fighting the power like Chuck D
Yeah boy! We got in on smash
You got a little single but how long it's goin' last (over!)
Every old shooter with me throwing that mask and
Clap! Clap!! Let’s take it back to that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Styles P]
One man eat we all eat
Disciple of Rakim, descendant of Kool G
It’s way in the therm but I carry the Uzi
Now I just reign supreme, you're dummy you'll see
I put the city on Red alert
Shout out to Uncle Red alert
A thousand hommies that's a Red alert
You ain't getting money on your block, get better work
I'll be repping that boom bap
Talking that dope money all of my goons strapped
Smack you out the skinny jeans; yeah we're doing that
With your soft ass bars, all you cowards who wan' rap
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo!
I come through splash your wig
I'm Kane mixed with slick rick, splash of BIG
I'm young Nas when he was just a nasty kid
Nigga! I'm Kool V still getting cash with biz
I was lord finesse, then I was lord Tariq
Load 'em out the trunk, get it off the street
Got my DJ with me, he got his two technics
Soon as he plug in, tell the crew let's eat
Put the kids the away, Showbiz I'm A
Then pursue my dream, I'm Guru and Preeme
The memories are vivid
You know I love the pictures, and yeah I love the strippers
But most importantly I love the...
[Hook][ verse 1 Ghostface killah ]

Raindrops of water that turn into hard glaciers
Bob barker microphones I get paper
My block is cocaine central
Eat your food with ancient or new crew utensils
Turbaned up like a royal prince from medeen
With emerald green birthstones in my bling
Rolex goggles
Some of my best side bitches I ever had
I kept in a bottle
Sniff that girl whiff that girl
Feel a rush from cuba no cut that's pearl
An oily based extract from green leaves
Set out to dry but comes right from the heat
Packaged up then retailed on the street
Yonkers all through brownsville that's sheek's
With my connect I may be the next steve jobs
My best custies is nerds with college degrees god
Triple black ratchets champion cone hoods
Blending in with killers that visit the wrong hood
Pardon self never the wrong hood I'm safe
And I ain't gotta knock on wood

[ Hook Styles P ]

Cocaine central
Sniff city needle park
Fishscale mental
Hustle get the weed to spark
Niggas outside all day even after dark
Niggas hustle hard
Like the Gods don't believe in God

Repeat

[ verse 2 Sheek Louch ]

I got uh
Coke in my blood weed in my lungs
Barely staying up
About to get some fried chicken from Wong's
She laying there
Ass all fat in her thongs
Hand me my gun
Shades on blocking the sun
Whip fresh out the dealer think tonite gone be fun
Coke connect already calling
I told him I'll take him but
We can do better when his prices start falling
Nowadays I feel there's no need to be greed
Cause you can make the same money off of pills and weed
Shooters indeed jail system taught him to read
Streets taught him how to kill wolves taught him to feed
Just like everything you learn you're gonna teach to your seed yo
But I don't give a fuck
I clap off try me nigga
Keep that feather weight by me nigga yeah

[ repeat Hook ][Produced by Neenyo]

[Sheek Louch]
Geah, make a move y'all
Which part you wan' lose?
The clip is loaded, the quatro is on cruise
I'm back to work bitch, the clock off snooze
I'm tougher than leather nigga I cannot bruise
Who wanna try a nigga?
Hard to the God, come and butterfly a nigga (hold that!)
Ooze on out (uh-huh)
Weeks later bitch go and throw your shoes on out
I'm that shit that great Mario Puzo 'bout
Clear this out, blood on the hopscotch floor
Shells in the sandbox; niggas with big Glocks
Late night, movin that junk, like Redd Foxx
Now, you don't want nothin about me (nah)
You pussy, nigga come fuck with the alkie
Weed smokin, keep the cancer piece on it (yeah!)
Call hoes, get pussy whenever I want it (c'mere bitch)
Mack daddy (no) pimp daddy (no)
Hammer cocked (yeah) let that, go
I ain't heard shit in a long long time
To even fuck around with either one of my rhymes (Sheek Louch!)
Niggas still livin off the petty-ass crimes
The Hossa{?} hater, Lacoste gator
Levi's, hundred to the Mr. Chow waiter
Whattup street niggas? Hold heat niggas
FUCK sweet niggas, you'll get beat niggas (yeah!)

[Hook: S.I.]
Now who out there wanna fuck around with me?
You can come and get a fresh buck-50
We got guns, money, liquor, drugs
We right here until they come get me (I'm talkin 'bout murder)
Now who out there wanna fuck around with me?
You can come and get a fresh buck-50
We got guns, money, liquor, drugs
We right here until they come get me

[Jadakiss]
C'mon, yeah, ah-HAH! Nobody, c'mon
Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah, yeah, uhh, yo

Yo listen here, you ain't dead if your heart ain't stop
Twin 40's, you ain't gotta ask "Are they cocked?"
I'm so sharp I could come through and scar they block
Late night, red linin in an R8 drop
And I'm only tuckin them until I shoot ya
When I pull 'em out that's when I'm fuckin with your future
You gon' realize this is nothin that you're used to
Get your life tooken by a booster, then we gon' hang the noose up
It's all over with (yeah)
All they found was his Louis scarf with his DNA all over it (mm)
Who's choosin and pickin them (who?)
Cause I'm sick of them, not followin the curriculum (yeah)
It's my shit and I'm evictin them (get out)
Whoever feel like they ain't gotta leave, I'm rippin them
Even though the love's frail the thug's real
All you gotta do is just follow the blood trail
Much harder fightin when the battle is uphill
Whatever the knife can't handle the slug will
Keep a good lawyer that's smart work on cases
Still gotta run from the NARCs, they gon' chase us (run)
In case I gotta put some artwork on faces
If we leave the game for God they gon' +Mase+ us
My suggestion, is that you don't even test son
Unless you wanna catch a fresh one

[Hook]

[Outro: Sheek Louch]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's go[Intro: Raekwon (Sheek Louch) {Ghostface Killah}]

{Martin is on, right now, Martin on} (You got the remote) {We need new batteries for that remote, though}
(Ah man) {Yeah} (Aiyo, talk to them, Starks)

[Ghostface Killah]
Henny bottles everywhere, smelling like 'yac
Bagging crack, sitting in the kitchen, wearing my mask
Robe on, tailored made in Italy, new Gucci denim
One slipper on, Brookstone, cushion
In the barn, number seven, hugging my neck, yo, Kiss, yo, Rae
Tell that yellow bitch I got next
She fucking with robbers, don't wanna hear her pussy sore like Tasha's, this is Starkers
Crumbs hitting the floor, fiends clicking they bic lighters
With Garfield eyeballs, pulling them all nighters
Give me fifty push ups, give ya'll a little piece
Faggots did a dime, niggas too weak
For fun, shove a Suzy Q in they face
Let 'em smoke a rock with cake on they head in the gate
He might die with a stem on him
Who give a fuck, I'm Larenz Tate on 'em

[Sheek Louch]
Crack spot stories, he put a kilo in the pan
I was about to break his hand until it came back tan
He dancing around the stove, Starks chilling in his rob
My hard knock life, I could of wrote that for Hov'
Shorty, give me a ginger ale and dutch masters
Matter fact, hand me the phone I'm bout to order Casper's
Fiends at the door, I'm too lazy to let 'em in
Turkey sandwich, barbecue chips, ESPN
Sitting on the couch, I'm just trynna do the match
She got ten polo shirts, all she asking for is half
Today was a good day, no one got shot
No police or none of that, that's how it is in our spot, yeah

[Raekwon]
Pyrex boys fronting in Rolls Royce's
I'm on the iPhone, leg back, examining choices
Two types of coke, we in the bathroom, voting
We like 'take it', helicopter waiting, we boating, yo
Gangstas to the death of it, humbling villains
A good hand chemist in twenty minutes, cake up and finish
This for the hallways, the long days, me and my whore, bagging up
Shorty more razors and bring out the four aces
Sit back, laughing with a stack and a clapper
She spray up everything, we paying Pataki
Drug house with no work there, the worst fear is never the thirst, yea
But set up for to the first of the thirty first, disperse, yeah
Beef, what, bring me a burger, ya
The flame broilers jump out, one to your first beer
So take that, over there
Everything, everything, just stay out of max clear

[Jadakiss]
We got the trays up in 6E, that's usually where the God be
Me, Kay and J-Bop, Cali J, and Rod Lee
Bread clocking, all night, the heads knocking
No feds, just Kevin Tighe or west watching
Bagging up at the table, while we chit chat
Past the Phillie, wash your hands 'fore you hit that
Young niggas getting it, everybody G'd up
Other niggas only made sales when we read up
Motorola flip, burn out in the beeper
White Katie and Rhonda, Stacey and Shaniqua
Yeah, cocaine, weed and forties
That's when I was a shorty, crack spot stories

To Allah be the glory[Sheek Louch]
Ayo back off the boat, unload the dope
Untie the rope, this is not soap
Get it out the water, complete my order
Get it down to florida, Sheek's so smarter
Before only count to ten like a kindergarder
I got no patience, I don't like waitin'
See my homey in the rear, say hello to Satan
I'm that blatant, y'all can keep hatin'
Cuz I'll take a bitch out without datin'
You know what I'm skilled in
Keep the guns and the coke in the trump buildin'
Keep the deers and the raccoon arround my children
Give'm fresh air, kinda mad but the school system best there
And I'm still a thug keep the white tee
Over the banana incase one of these gorillas bug
D-Block Dipset get ya shit plugged

Hang on a nigga (Jim Jones)

[Jim Jones]
On the way to Fifteenth as I speed up Eigth Y'all
High off the drug make me see it like Ray Charles
Night on the block blowin' weed with my shades on
Bang, stop fuckin', fuck you get ya ace on
Nah but they don't do it like we do
Pull up to the hood but the roof is all see through
So is my trial gettin' closa
Down in Miami puttin miles on the Rosta
Feds got mommy's child on the posta
But I ain't gon' snitch, not on my Cosa Nostra
I'm out on bail, but I'm livin' it up
Until the day I get nailed, I ain't givin' a fuck
You gotta find me guilty. New York's most wanted
Tearin' up the streets in a Porcshe gettin' blunted
In and out of court with my lawyer
Goons outside, somethin' sporty with a spoiler

[Hook]

[Hell Rell]
Bout to wrap them things up all I need is some plastic
Got ya suit and tie ready, all you need is ya casket
Half a million off of dope and I'm still in the hood fella
Niggas respect me like uncle Paulie in Goodfellas
And whoever you get ya coke from I'm their supplier
Homey I watch the Wire, nigga you wear the wire
Hop out the ferrari spyda
Cock it back then put two in his Ed Hardy visor
It's mister Ruger nigga
I made my money off of crack spots and hood extortions
Fuck cars, I'm about to have a bullet auction
Goin' once, goin' twice
Sold to the nigga who think he tough cuz he hard cuz he on home parole

[Jadakiss]
Yeah listen cocksuckers I got bullets for each of you
If nothin' else at least I know my dreams is reachable
People say I changed but I think I'm the same brother
DB 9 in the Vanquish is the same colour
Potato salad white, them haters gotta fight
The scrilla is on stash  the weight is outta sight
Dope money to rap money, still on the same route
I ain't miss a game since T-Bo came out
Way under the radar, stay offroad
I'm on the side gettin' haze and the yay off slow
I'm the studio right now in playoff mode
Work till' you die, never take a day off yo
Yeah

[Hook]Ayo Devine drop that daddy

**repeat twice**
Ooh weee, lets get it poppin daddy
Uh, yea, lets get it poppin mommy

[Sheek Louch]
Ayo the moral of the story is
We all can't be gloriest
Some of us still on our grind (our grind)
Thats why I walk wit this chrome .9 (I'm fine)
'Fore who eva want to cross this line Devine
Ayo Sheek on the street again, they know the big man is back
But niggas still don't want to get down wit the heat again
You see me postin on the block, see these bitches on my cock
Seein you jumpin out the drop, sombody light up
I ain't fuckin wit you homey, you ain't smokin, you don't know me
You can eat from my dutch, I'mma fuck 'em right up
You can catch me all Nelly in the blue red dully
Half crip half blood nigga west side
But you can catch me in New York on stage on the block
Or even visitin my niggas in the cage (lets ride)
Its somethin to do, lackin the fool, packin a .2, ok nigga

[Hook: 2X]
Me and my niggas on our New York shit
Me and my niggas on our West Coast shit
Me and my niggas on our down South shit
Yes, Midwest, Bay area

[J Hood]
Lets go, uh
When niggas see me in the street they be like there go double O again
He got the .357 set and he 'bout to let it go again
Switchin up this flow again, grindin up for that dough again
Your mans in that set trip, I'm 'bout to put a hole in him
Hands up plus lip, let me see ya'll niggas bang
Hit a nigga in his head make 'em come about this chain
Homey I'm the best at this shit
I'm the don wit a black mark about to tag up on this shit
That niggas perpin ya'll ain't seen no bricks
We movin grindin on a new city gettin jacked suckin ain't no dick
And you can show if it ain't no purp-b
Our buns be color of pookey lips when they gave 'em that turkey
Been a long time comin, but my time is due
Everythin is crystal clear but the shines is blue
Caught away seats in the gray CL
Wit so many weight in the trunk
If you don't chop it the brick scale, nigga!

[Hook: 2X]

[Sheek Louch]
Ayo me and my young boy
Remind me of my self in early days sort of like a young hoy
Now I'm puffin in the Phantom out in St. Croix
Blue water two bitches and peep a toy
But don't play it sweet, the heat is in the cooler
And the cooler got no bait for lunch meat
You done fuck see the morgue
You ain't fuckin wit me dawg
Ayo Hood you ready, bark at your fawg

[J Hood]
Ayo I'm 'bout coastal G
But I'm 'bout to east coast back where it 'pose to be
D-Block got the streets in a zip lock
And we bustin off 'em hammers
Like we don't give a fuck 'bout hip-hop
So who wanna get popped, just give me the word
It won't be occasion when I hit his ass wit this bird
Leave his ass on the curve
So you can put that yach on 'em
I'mma make this drug related and leave some crack on 'em

[Hook: 2X][Produced by Frank Dukes]

[Ghostface Killah]
Sitting in this library, man
Reading these fucking books
Britannica Encyclopedias, L. Ron Hubbard, Tony Robertson
These muthafuckas, you know what I'm saying?
Sheek Louch

Glasshouse
I reside by the library
Yves Saint Laurent frames
Sipping Ciroc berry
Burning the big dutch, sweet feet up
Long ashes hanging off the blunt, then I pluck
Fell back power napping
Stones they cover my bones
Bricks laying on my pinkie like tombstones
Unbutton my shirt, unloosen my tie
Got the fireplace up real high
Cuban maid sliding me cookies, tall glass of lemonade
Chandeliers hanging over my head
Sitting like a cloud of haze
Larry King on mute
They about to bury Wesley for taxes
Then shot across the two
Then I grabbed the remote, hit the volume on the big lion
The screens in his mouth, a ninety inch giant
Went to commercial, the phone rang
“Yo, what up Sheek?”
“Ain’t nothing, Tone, just on my dean”
“Out here in Queens, I bag me a queen”
“Fed her all this shit she wanted to hear, she probably want the ring”
True!

[Sheek Louch]
Yeah, different time zones, that’s all
I mean, I’m over here across seas
You over there in the States
You over there, but either way we gotta get this money, fam
Yo yeah

On the tenth floor, looking over Paris
My neighbors all embarrassed
Cuz I’m ass naked, watching the clock
He hating, but his wife steady watching my cock
Different time zones, steering wheel on the right
Driving down the wrong street thinking what the fuck I’m gon’ eat tonight?
White women laying in my bed
I can make a documentary on what race can give the best head
Rae hit me on the text
Told me that he like that new shit, last night, that he heard on Flex
Alright cool, hit me up when you get down to Brazil
If the weather’s right, fuck it, I come down to chill
I got a briefcase of Euros and Indian money
Every time I’m in customs, they look at me funny
Yeah

[Inspectah Deck]
I’m out in South Beach, 1st street, Ocean Ave
AMG6 with the oak dash
Live the VIP life, I ain’t spend a clam
I got weight on the spot, that’s "instagrams"
Pretty boos in Jimmy Choo's with titties loose
In the mood, getting nude in the swimming pool
I’m doing my thing, how I’m repping, they salute king
And they don’t even know I’m Wu-Tang
Name heavy, phone call to my ace Diego
For anything, what up, man? Connect me
I snatch bank like four, five, six
Deuce high, watch a dude ride, I’m on my shit
Up in Mansion, salute, world famous Inspectah
Click large, homey, put some more tables together
Wild for the night, I ain’t even think about my flight
I got some bitches and they tripping off that powder white
Aiyo yo yo, kiss each other, yo[Hook]
Guess whos coming to dinner.. mighty D–block
Guess whos coming to dinner.. mighty mighty D–Block

D-Block- oh-oh-oh-oh D- block

[Sheek Louch]
(louder, louder, yeh, Don Don)
Okay I lyrically ejaculate
I come on tracks go ‘head and hate
Go inside, run and hide
Coz this gon boost the murder rate
Flying with the long behind me
Nickel plate, extra shiny
Got this woman on my tip like they name is Tiny
Every hood, light is up, dark liquor, plastic cup
Sour diesel, hoodie on, gun out like what the fuck
Porsche turbo, yankee blue, Derek Jeter of his crew
Rosé, feet up, deuce deuce in my shoe
Ten years on radio, ten years on mixtapes
Did deals with everybody, even survived the Puff rape
Now I’m all bossed up, watch all glossed up
D block, we hard in the streets, put your signs up

[Hook]

[Jadakiss]
(aha, the one and only, the mighty might)
Money ain't shit to me, respect means more to me
We define loyalty
This is rap royalty
Let the fo five off, live for, die for
Hustle is my first love, and the streets my side ho
Haze then im back to sour
Okay im back in power
Business man nine to five, hooligan after hours
Ain't nobody to compare to what we contribute
The bars is like the possession, with intent to distribute
My hand, wrist, ears and neck laid
Nothing but straight fire for a decade
Im in the polo rounds, polo down
Feelin like when Tony put Manolo down
Ya all know who control the town

[Hook]

[Bully]
This is for my Looters and shooters
With them deserts, and rugars and lugers
Who was newest to beat, talk to us, huh?
I got ‘em don don, fully black armani yan(?)
Mi not play wit dem facey boys, shut it down
Keep my barrel spinnin, thats why ratty warm
Have you marked for death, you’re whole family gone
Got em pounds of thatgreen we call it the Hawks
D- Block, one time, we call it new york
Get money, hit honeys on the regular
Bully stay in peoples ear like a cellular
Now the World and your girl they all know my name
Got em Trey Songing, Bullys insane

[Styles P]
Never been to Yonkers before neither enterpreneur
And im a monster for sure
Like Godzilla
Shoot is on your death, cut ya deck like a card dealer
Puffin on the lies, spent a buck at the car dealer
They tryna say d block is negative
Any rapper breathing is breathing cause we let em live
I can tell you why these soft suckas mad at me
They can see I got every kind of flags with me
Honor flags,? flags, game flags
Its a d block, everywhere we bangs at
Money long, run long, bullets long
Word to your hood, if you got a hood, put it on

[Hook][Hook 1]
(Whole squad get it down like this)

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Sheek Louch, yo
Routine shit, wake up, fuck, hit a blunt
Go outside with my pack, see what these niggas want
D Eagle, whip is barely street legal
0 to 60, knocking my nigga Sigel
Hip hop fanatic, your shit pathetic
I'm De La, I'm Kane, I'm Ultramagnetic
Old school and new school, all of y'all can get it
Liquor hangovers, weed medication
New York City, L.O.X federation
Any jail cell, our music is meditation
You don't want my niggas to act up
Cause we ain't moving when I say them boys packing up
I talk shit, but everything I'm backing up
Big money, every day I'm racking up
You can blame us for the hard shit
D Block, box cutters in the yard shit

[Hook 2]

(Whole squad get it down like this)

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Female dogs plus ignorant individuals
Equal bitch niggas, their existence is criminal
I divide fuckboys in half, then live
Multiplied by the fucks that I don't give
You don't possess the grammar to step to Pharoahe's parameter
Trying to take a piece of the pie, or a slice of the ratio
Of a circle circumference to its diameter
Police scan a scrambler, damage your man with a blammer
Feeding Canada, land of the chicks, now get off my dick
Your whole squad's petty, sounds like shit
Whole squad get it down like this, work with me though
The Queens strangler, the rap mangler, danger
The rapper who raps like he should have been born in Jerusalem inside of a manger
Four finger ring rock at the kango
With the headbanger thing hanging out of his pocket, he's not playing
Your topics are not bangun

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Nobody rhymes iller than Crooked, I'm Godzilla packing a big gun
This is capital punishment like a cop killer listening to Big Pun
I've got the plug on every drug like auxiliary for the street income
Truly, no lie, my crew be multi
Excuse me, but I'm usually the dude that the foolies don't try
Usually the shooter when the uzi roll by, with the goonies
I put more G's on your neck than a Gucci bow tie nigga
This is what happens when Statik Selektah
Get a rap from Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal predator
How to kill a rapper, I'm the manual's editor
Have to respect him, chew him, shit him out a mechanical rectum
Yeah, still getting cash till I pass
Trapped in this industry full of fags and high class
Hoes, that wanna sit on my lap for a band
Cause they heard I'm moving weight like a gastric bypass
I'mma be fresh as hell if the feds watching
I'mma be getting a best nugging
From a freshly dressed bitch at the edge of my bed with her head bobbing
Goblin, treating her cheaper than lunch in Red Robin
I'm out flowing you niggas with quotes, knowing you niggas is jokes, ha
If I really go in, you niggas are croked
Up shit creek, I'm just throwing you niggas in boat
Rocking dookie chain, showing you niggas the ropes crooked
I can keep going
(Blame the, blame the Crooked letter I), the streets know it

[Hook 3]

(Whole squad get it down like this)
(You can act stupid if you wanna)
(Whole squad get it down like this)
(Down like this)[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Out the window with that Range or that muscle car
Arm hanging out the window, diamonds in that big Chopard
Weed in the cracked cigar, more sour in the jar
Looking both ways, I'm cautious when I'm (drivin' 'round)
Hoodrats that's fresh, but barely feed their kids
Little kids that's killers and love doing bids
Unemployment lines, Mexicans'll work for nothing
You pray with them, but you don't know who that priest been touching
Liquour stores, strip clubs, filthy whores
Somebody daughter getting ten singles to drop her drawers
Crack fiends buy a new TV for 20 beans
Niggas tryna get money, police (drivin' 'round)
Blue flags, red flags, different gangs
OG's still outside, it never changes
McDonald's, chinese food, a thousand chains
I'm just tryna use my brains when I'm (drivin' 'round)

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
Step in the car and go
Round down by your lady, and I be waiting at the door
We 'bout to go (drivin' 'round)

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Look, I'm fresh back from out of state, JFK arrival
A big spliff in my ashtray, July sunny day
And I'm feeling 'ight too, sliding through Medina
I done pushed everything, I love the way the Benz swing
So I turn my music up, caught a thought, wrote it down
I've seen him come back from outta town and get laid down
His music loud, windows down, summer heat vibing
It's live when I'm gliding, I'm smoking while I'm driving
Riding, mini skirts flirting while I'm passing, they waving
I'm leaning hard cruising, grooving to the beat
As I move through these mean streets
I beep at the seeds, stop, bless them with a little gwap
I keep it rolling, picture me trolling the big truck
(?), my cheap skin shearing all the leather
It's a cold world, winter war weather
This is Wu-Block music for the black hooded champions

[Hook]

[Verse 3: GZA]
What is the key to life, with no ignition?
Another jump start, then I'm on my mission
I keep ID, insurance, and registration
Wu music, good hemp for stimulation
Pull out the station, yield to pedestrians
Blacks, whites, Asians, Indians and Mexicans
At the light, a base head, fragile as a Pringle
He asks me "can I spare a change?" I throw up singles
He mimics my song that's on repeat
Addiction so strong, got him in knee deep
Button on his lapel, picture of Obama
Four years later we stuck in the same drama
These streets corners, just overcrowded saunas
Bigger losers drop weight, sweating from the trauma
Education to a thug is well debated
Each crime is kinfolk, all blood related

[Hook][Hook Tyler Woods]
Here we go!
Same old shit, same old niggas I don't even fuck with
Same old bitch say a nigga ain't shit
Same old pussy ass niggas ?
So, let me get faded
Turn the mic on while I get faded
Hold on my nigga let me get faded
Turn the lights down let me get faded
Here we go!

[Verse One Styles P]
Let me get faded
Me and Benjamin Franklin it's like we related
Me and Mary Jane we get so sedated
Aslong as you respect it you could love it or hate it
It's the same old shit
If the rap don't work, then the cane gone flip
Just a juice bar nigga in the mango six
And my lingo kick, and I bang my shit
Hold up, hold up, let me get faded
Roll up a eight of the sour high graded
You could copy but you just can't paste it
You can smell the weed but you sure can't taste it

[Hook Tyler Woods]

[Verse Two Sheek Louch]
Ayo, I was young, I was gettin' my hair braided
Momma pullin' on my scalp, like god damn I hate it
Now I'm sittin' in the coupe like, god damn I made it
I ain't seen you in my life, how we god damn related?
That's why I get faded
No matter if I spit the hottest shit I'm underrated
No matter if I fuck the hottest bitch I'm still skating
We ain't drop in years but our fans is still waiting
Got a new man in the baby
How the fuck you still hate me?
We ain't even touchdown but our numbers is still Peyton
Every day is percocet ?
We get faded

[Hook Tyler Woods]

[Verse 3 Jadakiss]
Yeah let me get faded
You are now rocking with Shawn, Jason, and David
We solid gold, these niggas is gold plated
The only reason you still alive, I OK'd it
Haha, yep, same old kiss
Still in the hood on the same old strip
Sticking to the story, yea the same old script
If your formula works then don't change your shit
Hold up, hold up, let me get faded
Everything's for sale but I prefer to keep the haze lit
Ain't about money might as well not even say shit
Get shot or get bladed, we get faded

[Hook Tyler Woods][Hook 2X: Styles P]
Sheek Louch is a gangster, gangster
Jadakiss is a gangster, gangster
Styles P is a gangster, D-Block
Won't you come fuck with a gangster, gangster

[Styles P]
You don't get nothin but gun shells
I ain't on the bar, Louch pass me the dumbbells
I'm in war mode, they in more mode
Body after body so the story was foretold
Twist 'em up real tight just like a cornrow, stick in they hair grease
Bullets in ya eye and your earpiece
Bullets whistle like canary for canaries
Your stones is yellow but so is the owner
Ain't a Blood but I'll make him a donor
Crash the whip at the dealer tryin to get me a loaner
Got a spliff that I dipped in Corona
Fuck around make you sip some ammonia
Karma, put your ass in a coma
Ain't nobody give a fuck if you paralyzed
'Kiss pass the saw so I can shave down to barrel size
Said he was the king 'til he looked in the pharaoh eyes
Blow was the bulb was the verse as the arrow ride
What nigga!

[Hook]

[Jadakiss]
Yup, AH-HA!
Yo, you ain't got to remind me, I'm a top-of-the-line G
If you a fan you can say I been poppin since 9-3
If you my man then you know I been poppin my whole life
Outside 'til it's finished my nigga, the whole night
Few contract and inkpens later
Turn into boss respect, mob ties and kingpin paper
Mountin the D, Cardi frames and pink Gators
Gotta learn how to deal with the weak link haters
Don't even think about the top 10, just think Jada
Never eat no less, then I think greater
Gambino affiliate - still transport bricks
A boy on a bike, while my man willie it
Silly shit, imagine how rich we could really get
Fuck a pool table, the crib got a billiard
Streets is our problem, hope Allah's got 'em
Three-piece purple label with the hard bottoms - gangster

[Hook]

[Sheek Louch]
Silverback! No doubt (yeah)
That's you son, aiyyo I got you though

Aiyyo straight out the gate I pack heavy, big Chevy
24's, bandanna like I'm one of the outlaws
4-4 sit on my lap, other thing in the truck
It's too big and it come with a strap
I got bitches, money, cars in a lot
I already got weed, bring cigars to the spot
Coke in a pot, 'gnac on the counter
Three money countless; get from around us
I probably won't do Yay' or 50 sales
Like they probably won't last in none of these jails
I'm tattooed up, Levi's double sewed Chuckers
No shirt, I'm back muh'fuckers!
The mac muh'fuckers don't clack muh'fuckers
That keep your lil' stink mouth intact muh'fuckers
Silverback nigga, the Barack O. of rap
L.O.X., D-Block coward, hold that!

[Hook][DMX, (Sheek)]
(Yea I'm right here dog) Where my dogs at
(We right here dog) Where my dogs at
(I'm right here dog)

[DMX]
What must I go through to show you shit is real
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggas feel
Rob and I steal, not cause I want to cause I have to
And don't make me show you what the MAC do
If you don't know by now then you slipping
I'm on some bullshit that's got me jacking, niggas flipping
Let my man and them stay pretty and I'ma stay shitty
Cruddy it's all for the money, is you wit' me?
Get the bitches, and I'll commit the crime
And when it's on we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it wit them we'll take your cap
Bust it off dusting off the softest niggas
Money with the biggest mouth, yo let's off this nigga
A novice nigga never made a sound
Breath too fucking hard and you're getting bust down

[Hook x2: Sheek] + (DMX)
Yo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)
(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)

[DMX]
Nowadays it ain't looking to good for certain niggas, I'm hurting niggas
(What you doing?) Robbing niggas, jerking niggas, sticking niggas
Cause they deserve it; when money got murdered
They know he died slow cause they heard it
The nigga ain't blew up the spot a while
And the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while
It just takes a light up to fuck the night up
Blow everything in sight up, fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
When you mention some shit you wasn't able to stand
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand
The days are longer and seems like I'm facing time
I've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasing mine
I soak it all up like a sitting fly
Cause nowadays getting by, nothing more than an occasional meal and getting high
I live to die, That's where I'm headed
Let your man hold something, now it's all about you can get it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
Well in the back wit ya faggot ass face down
Lucky that you breathing, but you dead from the waist-down
The fuck is on your mind? Talking that shit that you be talking
And I bet you wish you never got hit cause you be walking
But shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wondering how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under their eyes like a surprise to the guys
That one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
Fucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holla at you yo Baltimore shit (ah-oh!)
Knahmean? I'm just robbing to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbing the street
When we're starving, we eat whatever's there
Come on you know the code in the street; whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, menas your man couldn't walk
After the talk, about him not being 11-33 to New York
Transforming-ass niggas'll get it quick
And yo for real that nigga K {Solo} can suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me
Cause when I blow shit up, I have niggas falling like white bitches in a scary movie
AHHH! You know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas it's like: "Protected by Viper, stand back"
What's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented
The fuck you want me to do with this coward? Finish him, it's ended
(*EXPLOSION*){Verse 1}
[BANG!]
You know me as the motherfuckin' "Love me"
I could back like rugby
I could see the game is gettin' ugly
I want that she out of it
I'ma make you proud of it
She here to separate the real from the counterfeit
Look at how I got 'em up
DJ! Put my record back! [PUT BACK!]
Know you's an autotune because I'm not to used to that
Spit wit' the steady flow
Years I had steady though
Whether it came from rap or fuckin' wit' the petty ho'
Blaze that, I could leave a space wit' your face at
Now just want a pussy, ma?
I ain't try to chase that
Done being incredible
All yellers had a ball
Fuckin' up the game practice - you panicking!

{Hook - 2x}
Motherfucka we run shit, run quick!
Go get your gun, quick!
We get it poppin' ova here!
Y'ain't poppin' ova there!
My niggas get it poppin' right here!

{Verse 2}
Let's Go!
Back in the street again, beat again
Niggas on my minigun
Pose bitches want me to beat again
Nigga want to clear the V-I-P out
Niggas know what we 'bout
Piss out before I pull the peace out
Now what?
Hit 'em here know we got his face cut
Nigga think he swayin' till we licking and we taste blood
I fuck the club up, we live to rug up
Patrol and five or ten hoes just to rub up!
Whip southside, ... boy, [It's me, baby!]
Bitches surround my car
Cameras out, I'm so superstar! [That's me, baby!]
/?Keep?/ it close to me
Who you supposed to be?
It's a reverb for blues, /?say ho it's donna we G?/

{Hook - 2x}

{Verse 3}
Somebody pull them shakers out
See what they /?think?/ about
Hey, crack, make a nigga go and get the paper out!
He know, hope you wanna flow when they hit blow
My niggas aiming at the crowd, at innocent people
D-Block, niggas wit' an attitude in pack, [Yes, Us!]
White tea, money green, M.I.B. jet black [No doubt!]
Kush got me feelin' light-headed
Two things we don't do - money & bitches - we don't sweat it!
[Keep that kush!]
I told y'all to motherfuckin' man to be back here, [Sheek Louch!]
It's your time to re-up on songs from last year
Now I'm back smoothin' in your grandma cashmere
If this ain't my year, I ain't pre-pare
WHAT UP?

{Hook - 2x}
