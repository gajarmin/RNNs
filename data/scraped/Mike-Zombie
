[Intro]

(Zombie on the track)

[Hook]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fucking here

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my momma's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like, "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show and we...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here, that's popping off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'mma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house cause we...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame, cause we...

[Hook][Produced by Mike Zombie]

[Intro: Jay Z]
People look at you strange saying you changed
Like you worked that hard to stay the same
Like you doing all this for a reason
And what happens most of the time people change
People change around you because
They starting treating you different because of your success

[Bridge: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box
They don't love you no more
They don't love you no more

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Shit ain't been the same since I came through in that hot shit
They gon' talk about you 'til you ain't got shit
Still gon' talk about you when you got shit
All eyes on Meek, I'm on my Pac shit
Y'all rap niggas on some pop shit
I've been ducking paparazzi with a pop bitch
Glock .30 in the cockpit
Sipping dirty, conversating with the pilot
Nigga, you ain't seen it, I've been fucking up arenas
I'm with double M, the genius, we the motherfucking meanest
And the cleanest in a long time
You pussy niggas hating on me picked the wrong time
Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon
Blood dripping on me looking like a nigga stabbed him
I be on the money, baking soda in the cabinet
Pyrex, trying to whip a Rollie, making magic
Laughing at you fuck niggas getting madder
If I feel threatened, I'mma go and get a ladder
And climb up your chest, nigga, motherfuck your vest, nigga
Motherfuck your couch, I'm with Khaled, the best, nigga

[Hook: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top, uh
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box, oh
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, yeah
Troops gotta cock, coupe's gotta drop
Shit starting to change so you starting to change, ah
They don't love you no more
They don't love you no more
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
Shit starting to change, you want me to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Bullet in the head, they wanna see my shirt red
Live by the code, it's the only way to play it
Benz or the Rolls, Mulsanne overrated
Half these niggas told, cut a deal, they'd take it
Promise to never fold and the bonds still sacred
Had to shake a couple niggas, everybody won't make it
God is the greatest as I'm praying in the latest
X600 as I swerve, Little Haiti
Ou paka bat m'wen, sak pase!
I'm busting out the sunroof, nigga, andalé!
My money always coming, no, I'm never on pause
I'll bring you straight to your door if you a motherfucking boss

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Hold up, you ain't got love for me, my nigga?
Ever meet another nigga like me, my nigga?
Are you sure? A nigga flip this shit like Jarl Borg
A nigga did this shit, this hardcore
If you say it, guess it's true though, kudos, I mean, but who knows?
Salute to all the real niggas out there finding the loopholes
Fuck all these fuck niggas, hate when niggas come up, igh!
Hopped off the plane, hit the helicopter (igh!)
Tell these crabs in the barrel we eating hella lobster (igh!)
Got hella options, like a college team
Hit these bootleg niggas with the heisman
Fuck the NCAA nigga, let a young nigga get paid, nigga
Niggas talking down on the crown
Watch them niggas you 'round got you wound
Haters wanna ball, let me tighten up my draw string
Wrong sport, boy, you know you're as soft as the Lacrosse team
RAAAAHHH!!

[Hook]

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
You don't love me no more?!
All the shit I done for you, you don't love me no more?![Hook]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here

[Verse 1: Drake]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my mama’s house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryin' to get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show
And we...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Boys tell stories about ya man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I’mma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I’m in the house
Cause we...

[Hook]

[Bridge: Drake]
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stays the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Came in the game with no lane and then changed it
These fuck niggas'll say it in ten different ways
Then see you and smile in your face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
I’m smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that it’s fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound
Yeah, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down
Started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when I’m steerin'
Hope the homie Drake don’t get pissed
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasn’t trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'
Cause we…

[Hook][Verse 1]
Started from the bottom now we here
We were sellin’ things, pullin' strings - puppeteer
Started with a dollar now I’m jumping out the Lear
All my niggas behind me, you can find me in the air
In the car smokin’ loud on my way to Mr. Chow’s
I say: “ain’t it funny now, nigga, this bracelet’s fifty thou”
He say he gon’ hit me, how? I keep shooters all around me
Quicker-picker-up your bitch, that pussy wet and I be Bounty
I got all these haters frontin’ just from lookin’ at my pictures
Plottin’ on my Instagram, they wanna follow me like Twitter
On my way home…
But I’mma hit her, did I mention, 30 grand’ll get you gone
You’ll come up missing ‘cause my cake long
Where your real friends at?
Hold up, fuck that, nigga, where your girlfriend at?
She probably in the VIP where all her girlfriends at
She know that you be hatin’ on me and I still hit that, damn
You gon’ need a green card for the Cuban link (ouch)
Cancel my account, I’ll probably move the bank
When you see them hammers out you’d best not move a blink
FN57, fuck around, shoot through a tank
Bitch, shake that ass, go on, shake them titties
Bitch, shake that ass like you work at Magic City
I be bustin’ bottles, ain’t talkin’ ‘bout with Drizzy
Probably be with OVO and I be in Toronto city
With yo fake ass, and yo fake weed
Frontin’ on a real nigga, bitch say cheese
And put your flash on just to catch the AP
Diamonds thunderin’ all in that bitch, I call it KD
Hold up – hold up, wait a minute, y’all thought I was finished?
I popped twenty bottles, that was just a scrimmage
Nigga, you ain’t ballin’, you pop twenty and you finished
Got you fuckin’ up your re-up every time we in the building
‘Cause we started from the bottom now we here
Sippin’ Rosé with Rozay and it’s Belaire
I signed with MMG and did it in a year
I started with a circle and I turned it to a square, ya dig?[Lu Jerz]
Loaded gun
Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang
[Hook]
Feels like a loaded gun, bang
Loaded gun, loaded gun
Aiming right, bang
Aiming right at my head
Loaded gun, bang
Loaded gun, loaded gun
Firing up, bang, at my head
Walking through life
Not really knowing what's gonna happen
Living in fear, in fear of me relapsing
The streets keep calling, bang
There's no time for talking

[Tsu Surf]
So what you wanan know first?
These streets or these drugs, which one is worse?
Well, damn, shit this is a cold world
Could only prop a nigga right for a warm hearse
I know, so many niggas tryina cap Tsu
Cause this buzz big and this hat blue
So many answers in this capsule
At the point where I'm feeling like I have to
Well, ever felt you wanna get away?
Man, I hate when that happens and shit
Cause you feel the same way when you back from the trip
But fucking with the same vice
Or getting back with the bitch
Dark room, thoughts, weed
Demons spread from nothing but sweat
Thinking, thinking like French kissing the fifth, right?
Right or maybe Russian roulette
Four thorns break to a part
Couple blunts, but I swear I bought more to spark
It'll be a long night
Think I shoulda took a left, made the wrong right
And still tryna right wrongs
Should these troubles seem life long
Survive or try to paint pictures daily as Picasso
Grandma pray and I don't
But I'm here so it's working, shit, it gotta be
How can something I give so much to
Still wanna take a lot of me?
Shit, we don't dare to ask
Or shit, we don't care to ask
If I close my eyes and let it go
I probably won't hear the blast

[Hook]

[Joe Budden]
Thinking what am I here for
Sometimes a nigga feel dead
Thinking what do I care for
Just a fucked up pill head
Nothing left, can't share more
Just know a nigga tried, lord
But an old addicts old habits
Give another meaning to the term vice lord
And I still ain't spoke to my pops
We should have handled this much sooner
Don't agree with me, just be with me
After all I'm still your junior
Look, got two tryna make me choose
They don't get this shit cut close
If I could ever tell him the truth
I might say I'm in love with both
And that can't be the answer
No, gotta go see grandpa
I'm up here fighting with broads
He down South fighting with cancer
And I can't make that same mistake
That I made years ago with grandma
Gotta put my career on hold and go see him
While I still got the chance to
Stained by what I can't do
This pain substantial
And a millionaire couldn't come and solve it
No, this debt ain't financial
More like a loaded gun
And these thoughts keep stalking
I'm caught in between a war of words
What's worse is I'm the only one
Talking

[Hook][Produced by Mike Zombie]

[Hook x2]
Drunk then a motherfucker swerving
I hit my brothers up like what it's in for
They saying 616 is what the word is
Well bitches going down if you didn't know

[Verse 1:Mike Zombie]
Monday, and Tuesday a party
Wednesday, and Thursday a party
Friday and Saturday, it's a party
Oh lord, bitch its Sunday and its still gon' be a party
616 was just the crib and niggas dying to get in
And the line is to the driveway, we just piling em in
And we know they got that skrilla, $5 to get in
Hundred people in the crib, we made $500 again
Woah, 616 was weed, bottles, sex
Gary down the store got liquor store connects
And Gary use to show a nigga love
Henny for the 20, Moet bottles for the dub
616 was just that drink the squad drink until we hurl
616 was just that place you better not dare bring your girl
Ill Will roll the weed, bets believe that bitch is pearled
I'm 16 and I ain't got a care in the world, cause bitch I'm drunk

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Zombie]
I been here about 4 or 5 days
I don't even know the date today
Soon as you wake up, it's a bottle in your face
Or niggas take a bottle to the face
My first day at 616, bitches was naked around the crib
EJ drunk a case of Nuvo as he could get
It could be a school night, and I would still be in this bitch
I know this shit sound so crazy, i can't make up all this shit
No, things that we would do a little liquor
Fav TV got the footage on my nigga
That's when you that's shits getting retarded
When niggas in the basement eating pussy in the party
Niggas wilding, swear to God we got no rules up in this bitch
Police station 'round the corner while we doing all this shit
Sometimes be fuckin' the same bitches cause they cool with the shit
Im 17, in 616 pop my first percaset cause bitch i'm drunk

[Hook][Verse 1]
They love you when you up but they hate you when you broke nigga
Where the fuck was you when I was sleeping on the floor nigga
Back in '09 put the game in a choke nigga
Real shit and rappers took notes nigga
Time to kill this Waka can't rap shit I ain't no joke nigga
They like where you been in the booth cooking coke nigga
Came back crack I just hit it with a fork nigga
Y'all must've forgot that I'm still a New York nigga, squad
I done changed the whole fucking sound of rap
All of these other nigga just a bunch of copy cats
Shout out to Khaled for making this hot song
But now that I got on it it's going right in the body bag
Niggas ain't gangsta most these niggas feminine
Fronting like they hard but we knowing that they impotent
What you trying to sell nigga I don't buy that [?] shit
Every thing a lie nothing real in their sentences
I got real niggas in the jail serving sentences
Bitches want to know what's going on I always send them pics
Always answer all their calls they just want to reminisce
And talk about the feeling the first time a Rollie hit my wrist
Before the deals moving weight like fitness
But feel in love with rap money cause it made a nigga rich
First they love you then they don't, why you hurting nigga flip
But when you on they want to come around and reap the benefits
They ain't believe in me they said I wouldn't hit I'll miss
Look at me now I got a middle of December wrist
How you haters feel now bet you didn't picture this
Shopping sprees every day no reason for a Christmas list
[?] got me started now I got to finish it
Its mines cause I bought these niggas just renting shit
These niggas just talking, me I'm really living it
We used to eat Ramen now its steaks for the dinner dish
Pull up in that ghost like everyday is Halloween
These nigga jealous just like the Celtics all these niggas green
Thank God for the blessings and the real ones in my team
Balling like the Spurs in the finals trying to get a ring
Nigga you don't want no problems unless you a mathematician
I suggest you don't bother, try me if you want to
You get boped like a [?]
My aim is on track like a martyr
Real rap bang sayonara
Speak with my actions I ain't ever been a talker
Never on the bench since a youngin was a starter
Blood gang real write nigga I'm an author
Really with the shits like Nino and the Carter
Squad
Who these niggas sleeping on not me I ain't no mattress
Damn, [?] you was an actress
Forever counting money I got a money habit
Still the same nigga only thing that changed was my addressFirst Time That I Met Chris, Party For Tenaisia/

[Hook][Into: Mike Zombie]
You all alone and you think that's alright. It ain't but you tell yourself everything is alright. But how you gon' tell yourself, when yourself ain't alright.. right?
Yeah

[Bridge]
Waiting for it to happen I can see it in my dreams
I want this shit so bad, im tossin' turning in my sleep
Wake up, look up like, lord i only want one thing. I don't know why i'm worried cause i know one thing

[Hook]
Yeah I know that, everything gon' be A OK
Everything gon' be A OK x3
Aww, everything gon' be A OK x4

[Verse 1: Mike Zombie]
Just like it better be, i work to fucking hard to not be living lavish comfortably
It feel like every fuckin' body getting on exepect for me, i promise i deserve it and this shit is really stressing me!
But i guess i need a catchy hook, guess i need a lot of cash, guess i need a video with naked bitches shaking ass
Guess i need a fake ass chain, guess i need to be about that life
Guess i need to sell cocaine and kill someone in every line
Uh-un nigga, that ain't me though. na-un, nigga that ain't ZO!
Swear to God imma still be me, never switch up on the team like most niggas we know
Uh-in nigga, that ain't me though. uh-un nigga that ain't ZO!
Team-work make the dream work, or you come up short on the green like mutherfucking C-low
Family got me stressing, got me drinking like my dad
Love that drink but it's the same reason why i hate my dad
Nigga wasn't man enough he chose to up and leave
My nigga, everything ain't what it seem

[Brigde]


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Mike Zombie]

(Background vocal) "Get it off your chest nigga"

Hopefully just like it's suppose to
Peer pressure got me wilding, I done turned into a smoker
Hold up, everytime i go through shit i cannot help but pour up
Talking gold bottles, i sip that cup until i fucking throw up
Everything gon' be A Ok, trying to get on but it ain't no way
I got that drive and i got that work but i'm loosing hope like everyday
Swimming in failure, bitch i'm fresh up out that water
Bank account way overdrawn, and bitch i got to feed my daughter
Man God is just trying to test me, pussy nigga don't test me
Man, why that fuck i'm so wreckless and nobody can help me
All these tears i been shedding, you probably will never get it
Never say never cause i never thought i would get molested
I promise i was embarrased, wanted to kill his parents
Thank god i ain't get that gun, and my boy ain't issue me clerence
I wanted to murk that nigga every dream
Now look me in my eyes, everything ain't what it seam

[Bridge]

Chorus][Intro: Calez]
Started from the bottom, I dropped a tear
Started from the bottom when I drunk my beer
Now your bitch looking like Britney Spears
Hold on motherfucker, I am not a queer

[Hook]
I like bad hoes, bad hoes, bad hoes, what?
Bad hoes, bad hoes, bad hoes, what
Bad hoes, bad hoes, bad hoes, what
Bad hoes, bad hoes, bad hoes

[Verse 1: Calez]
Okay, you know I'm getting bad
You know I'm in that Jag
You know I got the hat
You know I got the bag
Bitch, I'm 'bout the swag
Bitch, I'm popping tags
Bitch, I'm 'bout the grab
Bitch, you taking down
A rap genius, I rap genius
Your girl laying in her bed and she wrapped my penis
With her mouth; motherfucker, I'm a genius
So good when I'm talking 'bout the motherfucking

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fonz-E Mak]
Where the motherfucking bad hoes, them thick ones
Fonz spit that sick shit
Damn, that's a thick bitch
Damn, I gotta hit it
Feeling like some Nesquik
Put it on Your chest, bitch
Fonz-E Mak spitting that next shit
And she neckless
When she headless
Gave it to me Sleepy Hollow
And she swallow
Man, she a sleepy balo
Matter fact, man, I be feeling like Snorlax
You girl got more ass
So I must scratch
So must pass to the homies though
Fonz-E Mak on the flow
You cannot spit this shit, you overdose
Good looking for the people that host
And we not ending on a sad note
Rather, my circuit off and we looking for them fucking

[Hook]

[Verse 3: U.G.]
U.G. home swerve in the drop
Your bitch say she love me, give me top
U.G. on the track flow, never flop
Your bitch, yeah, she Jenny from the block
Bitch, I...[Verse 1:Showmann]
Bitch Get Up Off me, Balling Like I'm Barkley
Can't Hoop For Shit but I'm Rocking in My Jordans
Polo, Gucci, Louie are my garments
Space Jams on like I'm Riding on a comet
Wake up in a Saks 5th, Fell asleep in Nordstrom
You Sexually deprived, I fuck bitches out of Boredom
Opps, I said bitches, thats kind of misogynistic
Committed to killing beats but seldomly to any women
You do that, then you a dummy, you bitter, you sucking lemons
When a woman try to play me I throw her them John Lennons
Permitted to do litte, my budget ain't really shit yet
But that will all come in time, cuz I ain't exactly rich yet

Damn, I'm feeling really self conscious
Might be the only rapper thats honest
TME, bitch we steady droppin bomb shit
Double O, in the back of my Conscious
Shawty, you can twerk, but can a nigga get a private show?
Not saying that you a ho, but I'm sayin that I'm a pro
I'mma busy guy, so when I nut I'll say I gotta go
She the type to top me off, not the one I'm taking home
Ain't no model, no role model, for my daughter
So I'm always strapped before I dive, don't know whats lurking in that water
Penny ones, Pewter, copper, had them bitches in my locker
Momma mad bout what I spent, but she happy that I got em
Had to cop em, Helicopter, cuz now I'm flyer than all em
Use to tell me get my weight up, and now they ask me to spot em
Didn't wanna Un-DS em, but fuck it I had to rock em
I started off at the bottom and ended up as a problem bitch[Hook] x5
All I want is money
Fame, respect, the cars, clothes, and hoes
Champagne splash, let that man get cash
All I want is money
Fame, respect, the cars, clothes, and hoes

[Verse 1]
You Looking at the future in the flesh
Cashing out five figure checks
BET award sitting on my mama desk
Chauffeured to a five star to rest
Whats next? Me
Under the influence, over the bullshit
On top of my game, layed under a new bitch
She giving me brain, and telling me new shit
She here with a friend, I ain't know she  was cool with
Since when were y'all friends, wish I woulda knew this
I'm fucking with her, so I get on some new shit
Act like I ain't know her, the other girl clueless
So shorty gets mad and then dips looking stupid
Same day that I got head from the both of them shit how do I do it?
I don't understand why I should stay the same
I don't see how I could stay the same
Nigga look around me, shit ain't the same
And neither how y'all treat me, so I ain't to blame
Ima sip my liquor, fall in the cut, yeah that's the Mike that y'all want
Man I give all day, time to give y'all the Mike that don't give a fuck
Now-a-days I gotta watch what I say and do
I got some shit on my chest, i'm gon' say it too
You a threat to the game when ya idol keep selling you game and the nigga keep playing you
But I peep game and I see shit, and i'm not with alla that secret shit
And when I gots a problem I speak on it
That's all that I got to leave you with

[Hook]

[bridge]
Fuck yo problems, i cannot help you
I could do something for you, nigga thats nothing for you
I got this on my own, so no i don't owe you
I can do something for you, nigga that's nothing for you

[Verse 2]
Ace of spades, Dom P
Nobody woulda saw this shit coming
Came  long way from the class clown, fellow graduates are now struggling
Yeah, the class clown got the last laugh man the irony of thats funny
My town don't rep me the way I rep them
But if I stop then tell me that im stunted yeah
Thats just how the shit go, thats just how niggas do
But 609 should appreciate me cause I did the impossible
You can see me posted right here like I don't do the shit I do
And i'm gon' be a legend and I know that shit
Don't say that I ain't told you

[Hook][Produced by Mike Zombie]

[Hook]
Fuck am I in a rush? I got time, I got time
I know I'm underrated but I still got time
What is the rush? I got time, I got time
I know I'm underrated but a nigga got time
Fuck is the rush? I got time, I got time
I know I'm gon' be famous but I still got time
Fuck isp? I got time, I got time
This game, I'm gonna change it but I still got time

[Verse 1]
Fresh off takin' pictures with a bunch of fans
Don't ask me for a picture if you don't know who I am
I can deal with groupie bitches, the thing I can't stand
Is groupie ass nigga pretendin' to be my mans
Bitch it's ZO, and I am OVO
No disrespect to the fans, I just don't fuck with phony people
BET nominated double platinum producer
Rappin' ass producer comin' for all the niggas who do it
But fuck am I in a rush? I got time, I got time
Mike WiLL got the game right now and he pushin' 25
I'm 21, yeah Mike Zom like wine
Get better with time, y'all ain't heard a beat in a year's time
And I'm just sick and tired of niggas sayin' Young ZO suck
And I'm just sick and tired of people sayin' I got here by luck
Like before SFTB I wasn't fuckin' shit up
And I'd be lyin' if I said I ain't give a fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Maybach rented, Mike Zom don't lie
This for them niggas in the Borough talkin' 'bout mines
You rubbin' pennies boy and still ride the River Line
Don't talk 'bout money with me, boy, it was 2K for the ride
Like fuck is up? With these niggas?
How they comin'? Like some bitches
What they want? Recognition
Well wishes opposition, everyone got opinions
Best part 'bout opinions is that they're all just opinions
Fuck everybody with 'em
Beats, bars, man I swear I'm bionic
What I'm in it for, bitch to be iconic
In no rush, I know that it's all about timin'
Think I'm on, no bitch I'm really still grindin'
Only niggas who I be with who I fuck with for real
You other niggas actin' extra like y'all got me the deal
Niggas don't want me to spit, man I'm just keepin' it trill
But niggas gon' get these bars so nigga fuck how you feel

[Hook][Verse 1: Mike Zombie]
ZO, I've done a little, it look like a lot
Seems like it's getting under your skin like Icy Hot
I strip you of your story, show 'em you 'Maliah' lot
You write up stories, I'd rather get life on writer's block
They love you when you here, forget you when you gone
Parole got denied, now who gon' use the phone
Soon as I got paid, I put them lawyers on
Money down on the books 'til all my niggas coming home
Either you happy or you jealous of the things I have
Either way it's autographs or my nuts to grab
If I'm out of state it's black trucks, nigga fuck a cab
All my work is speaking for itself so I don't have to brag
Smoke a blunt with Diddy T, Rogers on the texts
None of this shit is coming and I did this shit myself
I'm getting big but never too big for my city
But smart enough and big enough to know that nobody's fucking with me

21 having a ton of fun
Every bitch I meet keep treatin' me like I'm the fucking one
I'm worried about guap not gossip
At the end every night I pull receipts up out my pocket
I got this seats with the AC and I'm ridin' in a spaceship
The words I hear the most is proud - congratulations
Please don't talk to me about your musical frustrations
Cause nigga I'm getting better, that's something I can't relate with
Checks after checks, accolades and nominations
Flew out the town to work, but why this shit feel like vacation?
Hotel, five star, top screen like GTA bitch
I set the bar so high you need a trampoline to drank bitch
Fuck the other side we reenact the segregation
Okay I OD on life, wear clothes for no occassion
Why that last bar written out look like my bank statement?
Capitalize every O and you will see I'm paid
It's the kid with the backpack
The one who can draw
The one who can dress
Design his ass off
Sound familiar, ay
If Drake the new Jay, please tell me who can fill the shoes of 'Ye
But shit who's to say? People say it's...

[Outro: Imogen Heap]
(...you
Trust me on this one
I've got a bad feeling)[Intro]
Hello.. yeah ..nah forreal, shit just too much
You sound just like her man.. its not even you its like niggas is saying..
Its just stressful like.. foreal

Zombie on the track

[Verse 1]
Yeah i use to be that boy, but now im the fucking man
Woman come and go, she showed me that first hand
Shit was out of control, you told me you understand
Thought she was gon' be cool but no im wrong again!


[Hook]
Shit was going wild. shit was going down
Shit was getting crazy couldn't bring your ass around
I know im gon' be balling, them hoes gonna keep calling
Talking bout flight in the morning, ok girl come jump on it
She gon' jump on it. x8

[Verse 2]
I call that girl jump on it
Usually i dont run my mouth but im about to speak on it
I ain't one to sell the dream, but it seam to me she bought it
Maybe im just trippin' or maybe im still off her
They said shit and we took that, i told you feelings then took them back
Told me yours then took them back, didn't give a fuck how we was looked at
I piped you up, then let you down. you iced me up then licked me down
I was fucked up when you was still down. you held the tears and they still fell
This is not to diss her, just to paint  picture
No hard feelings, but its way harder then [?]
Thought that you would get it okay ima take this guilt trip
I tried to keep my cool but you ain't even trying to hear it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
O-o-o-o-kay
Its fuck me now? address me as that nigga, ok this is how it's going down?
You roll for me, then something-something yes that's how you roll around
Thought that you was my nigga, but female is a female thought that i woulda knew by now
I was fucked up when we fucked long. we was high was hell when we felt the fall
We felt the things, you erased them all. you learned the swag and then took it all
I told you things and you ain't judge them all. i told you the deal and you played the law
You herd the things and ignored them all. four months okay, no way it's gone
Ain't no way around it. man that's all they taking about, when it's all said and done
I tried my best but it's best to get up out it. now it's fuck me and i know that
Wouldn't change shit if i could go back. man i tried not to go crazy but listen when i tell you that

[Hook][Lu Jerz]
Loaded gun
Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang
[Hook]
Feels like a loaded gun, bang
Loaded gun, loaded gun
Aiming right, bang
Aiming right at my head
Loaded gun, bang
Loaded gun, loaded gun
Firing up, bang, at my head
Walking through life
Not really knowing what's gonna happen
Living in fear, in fear of me relapsing
The streets keep calling, bang
There's no time for talking

[Tsu Surf]
So what you wanan know first?
These streets or these drugs, which one is worse?
Well, damn, shit this is a cold world
Could only prop a nigga right for a warm hearse
I know, so many niggas tryina cap Tsu
Cause this buzz big and this hat blue
So many answers in this capsule
At the point where I'm feeling like I have to
Well, ever felt you wanna get away?
Man, I hate when that happens and shit
Cause you feel the same way when you back from the trip
But fucking with the same vice
Or getting back with the bitch
Dark room, thoughts, weed
Demons spread from nothing but sweat
Thinking, thinking like French kissing the fifth, right?
Right or maybe Russian roulette
Four thorns break to a part
Couple blunts, but I swear I bought more to spark
It'll be a long night
Think I shoulda took a left, made the wrong right
And still tryna right wrongs
Should these troubles seem life long
Survive or try to paint pictures daily as Picasso
Grandma pray and I don't
But I'm here so it's working, shit, it gotta be
How can something I give so much to
Still wanna take a lot of me?
Shit, we don't dare to ask
Or shit, we don't care to ask
If I close my eyes and let it go
I probably won't hear the blast

[Hook]

[Joe Budden]
Thinking what am I here for
Sometimes a nigga feel dead
Thinking what do I care for
Just a fucked up pill head
Nothing left, can't share more
Just know a nigga tried, lord
But an old addicts old habits
Give another meaning to the term vice lord
And I still ain't spoke to my pops
We should have handled this much sooner
Don't agree with me, just be with me
After all I'm still your junior
Look, got two tryna make me choose
They don't get this shit cut close
If I could ever tell him the truth
I might say I'm in love with both
And that can't be the answer
No, gotta go see grandpa
I'm up here fighting with broads
He down South fighting with cancer
And I can't make that same mistake
That I made years ago with grandma
Gotta put my career on hold and go see him
While I still got the chance to
Stained by what I can't do
This pain substantial
And a millionaire couldn't come and solve it
No, this debt ain't financial
More like a loaded gun
And these thoughts keep stalking
I'm caught in between a war of words
What's worse is I'm the only one
Talking

[Hook][Verse 1]
They love you when you up but they hate you when you broke nigga
Where the fuck was you when I was sleeping on the floor nigga
Back in '09 put the game in a choke nigga
Real shit and rappers took notes nigga
Time to kill this Waka can't rap shit I ain't no joke nigga
They like where you been in the booth cooking coke nigga
Came back crack I just hit it with a fork nigga
Y'all must've forgot that I'm still a New York nigga, squad
I done changed the whole fucking sound of rap
All of these other nigga just a bunch of copy cats
Shout out to Khaled for making this hot song
But now that I got on it it's going right in the body bag
Niggas ain't gangsta most these niggas feminine
Fronting like they hard but we knowing that they impotent
What you trying to sell nigga I don't buy that [?] shit
Every thing a lie nothing real in their sentences
I got real niggas in the jail serving sentences
Bitches want to know what's going on I always send them pics
Always answer all their calls they just want to reminisce
And talk about the feeling the first time a Rollie hit my wrist
Before the deals moving weight like fitness
But feel in love with rap money cause it made a nigga rich
First they love you then they don't, why you hurting nigga flip
But when you on they want to come around and reap the benefits
They ain't believe in me they said I wouldn't hit I'll miss
Look at me now I got a middle of December wrist
How you haters feel now bet you didn't picture this
Shopping sprees every day no reason for a Christmas list
[?] got me started now I got to finish it
Its mines cause I bought these niggas just renting shit
These niggas just talking, me I'm really living it
We used to eat Ramen now its steaks for the dinner dish
Pull up in that ghost like everyday is Halloween
These nigga jealous just like the Celtics all these niggas green
Thank God for the blessings and the real ones in my team
Balling like the Spurs in the finals trying to get a ring
Nigga you don't want no problems unless you a mathematician
I suggest you don't bother, try me if you want to
You get boped like a [?]
My aim is on track like a martyr
Real rap bang sayonara
Speak with my actions I ain't ever been a talker
Never on the bench since a youngin was a starter
Blood gang real write nigga I'm an author
Really with the shits like Nino and the Carter
Squad
Who these niggas sleeping on not me I ain't no mattress
Damn, [?] you was an actress
Forever counting money I got a money habit
Still the same nigga only thing that changed was my addressZombie On The Track

[Verse 1: Mike Zombie]
These bars are for you to distinguish, after class I hit the store then cop a olde english
So close to getting on and I an feel it in my fingers
Webs slanging, music wakes me cause my spider senses tingling
College just wasn't me, I wasn't suppose to go
Body skin on my teeth, I made it there and Chris knows
I say that to say this, to say this
No high school, no college. and college was the reason I had a laptop to do this
So no highschool, no college. no laptop, no laptop no music, no music, no started. the reason why y'all herd all this
They told me my beats was wack, no all of them retarded
I proved them wrong with production, but now it's time as a artist
Yeah, uh. I hate to make you look dumb twice
Beat and bars are equivalent and [?] [?] [?]
College students, I know your pain, Mike Zombie was once the same
Black and milds for breakfast and dinner, I need a fucking change
Two room apartment, rent was 950. trying to make my music noise complaints just keep on fucking with me
If i get one more, then i'm out. now the plot thickens
And my mom just lost her job and can't get no where around the city man
How the fuck we paying that tuition man
How the fuck we putting food up in that kitchen man
No i don't regret it, but i know my past
I swear to God it felt i was going no where fast

[Hook]
No i don't regret it, but i know my past
I swear to God it felt im going no where fast. x3
I said i know my past, i swear to god it felt like i was going no where fast. (you know) x5Zombie on the track

[Verse 1]
Damn, I just cracked another can
Spending all my life just trying to figure who I am
Only 9 years old and doing drugs to my attention span
I been fucking up so long and I was wrong so now I do it for the fam

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah family over everything, money over nothing but it helps bitch I need it all
Yeah, oh yeah. I fucked up in school
Cindy I apologize but you know your son gon' do it for the F-A-M-I-L-Y
Yeah I love y'all niggas I ain't ever lie
That's exactly why it's family over everything, money over nothing but it helps so bitch i really need it all
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Aye, first suspension was in first grade
Cursing in the class while we was watching little mermaid, aye
School i never was  so ima grab some ass and go sit in the principal's office
Phone was off the hook at home, yeah my mister retarded
Laughing at the principal like bitch who is you calling?
Teacher said I potential from the shit I was drawing
But I was drawing bad as fuck and I was just getting started
Mom ain't let me get my permit, now i'm fucking mad
Now i'm in the school bathroom about to smoke a fucking bag, yeah
East side of the school like a straight dumb-ass
And my nigga T got caught up ended up in rehab
Man we coulda got expelled , man we coulda went to jail
Cindy came up there like "Why in school" and i'm just high as hell
And ima take my ass right home and make as many beats as I can
Bitch im trying to figure out who the fuck I am
And bitch I do it for the fam

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
First and only job I had I worked at CoCo Keys
Hundred dollar checks, man what the fuck i'll need with these
That shit just wasn't for me so I took my black ass home
But I stacked a couple checks and went and bought a microphone
Then I plugged it up and started fucking up my Telephone
Stuck at 616 that airborne play at 616 im on
And they double y is not just music that's my fucking bros
I was living with and he was cooking on the stove
And I just got a tattoo, I hope that Cindy doesn't know
Andy Mill retweeted me, i think i'm about to fucking blow, no
Wrong I was, but strong i was and i know that with all i does that in no time time would tell that i would surely blow
Summer 2010 i'm twenty ten, i'm fucking bitches getting drunk
But I ain't have a job and really wasn't doing much
Making beats for nobody and they would
But, Zombie did not care cause in 3 years they would look dumb
This for the fam

[Hook][Intro]
My life is coming together and is falling apart
Rebelling got it's negatives too so i'm like where do i start?
(I'm like where do I start?)

[Verse 1]
My last two years won't even fit into this album or song
Imma try and give you a gist of the shit that i'm on
Or the shit that i'm going through on top of shit that I saw
This the shit that I save for last the people doing me wrong
Been giving my all, all on top of giving my all
Only thing I want in return is a genuine call
A thank you, some understanding or a genuine call
But everybody ain't like me, or that's my feeling involved?
Man welcome to closure, look at my face you won't notice
That my momma's palace was about to go under foreclosure
Imma fix it, i'm pose to, back to the wall like a poster
Bitch im going crazy if they asking me "How is it going?"
More money more problems was sounding so crazy at first, and then I fucked up an got it now i'm just starting to notice
Money depleting due to the hundreds and thousands i'm loaning
What if i said fuck it, just got it, decided to blow it
I'm loosing focus
My mamas heated she ain't come to the Grammys
She don't understand its niggas out there trying to jam me
We got to arguing, you know pointing her fingers.. she  understood
Next time mama, I promise to bring you
I went from lifeguard, to giving life in my bars
I went from dropping out to dropping off cash for the car
I went from, class clown to first class in the stars
I went from no hoes in college to a ho collage
And that's a whole difference from back then and to now
How the fuck was y'all even tripping cause im never around?
No apologies cause you probably benefiting somehow
Think about it next time before you get to bitching
For now? Listen up

Look at me on TV with my niggas
I said look at me on TV with my niggas
Nobodys done it better or painted a better picture
I displayed the beginning of me and all my niggas man
I said look at me on TV with my niggas
I said look at me on TV with my niggas
Nobodys done it bigger or painted a better picture
I displayed the beginning of me and all my niggas man

[Verse 2]
,you hear?
Well hear some bullshit
How I got a daughter, no son but a nigga still got two kids nigga
You know what the fuck i'm talking about?
First I said fuck it, but fuck it now i'm just letting it out
You love when negative energy is spreading around
I fucked up getting you pregnant and I regret it right now, regret you
You're not my daughter and I am not your farther but i'm the closest thing you ever see you could call it
Took a Miami trip, had to meet you on the strip just so I can give you money for my daughter, fuck is this? Oh thats a trip
Now she be trippin. Tell me how you trippin
While you at it tell them who copped you the last whip you was whippin'
And I'll ask you if your sure? And how we here in court
And make sure you tell your honor how the fuck you got the car
Oh you don't got that shit no more?
Shit got towed, Oh you went short?
Oh that happened after court, God still don't like ugly i'm sure
I do it all you still want more
You bitter and you scorned
Keep it G and ask yourself who the fuck you did it for, on the set
But let me get off that
My main focus is getting chips off rap, and getting my life in order
Two girls last year had my abortions and i call my self testing the waters
When you rebelling I swear ain't nothing you can tell them
Ain't no reason i'm just young and addicted to acting restless
I probably won't learn my lesson but fuck it i'm living better
And niggas is pulling guns on me because them niggas is jealous
I'm a rebel with no cause
Fuck is up? Fuck is up?
And i'm a rebel without a cause
Fuck is up?
Thats why I do what I want, You only live life once man[Produced by SAP]

It's the most underrated in the game right now
Can't even tell you how actin' the same right now
When the Drakes and Jay-Zs now my name right now
And y'all think I'm gonna stop, nigga blow it out ya ass
This year I took 50K and then blew it out my ass
This year I made more than any teacher that had me in their class
And still ain't pay my tuition cause Zombie wasn't a grad
Now everyone's attendin' thinkin' that's when Zombie got the cash
So Full Sail University send the checks over
Cause Zombie's walkin' promotion without the diploma
I got time, I got time, 21, gettin' older
The time is mine, the time is now, y'all niggas just older
I got a bitch in the friend zone
Funny I can run that shit back all the way to the end zone
Ever since I done been home
Too many favors, way too many people
Too many know-it-alls about how to handle my income
I'm young and talented
From a place where reppin' your section became embarrasin'
Rep it until I'm masculine
Don't give a fuck right now
Cause I know only place to go is up right now
Yeah I'm fucked up right now
Liquor got the room spinnin' upside down
Niggas like, "Uh if the money's up, I'm down"
That's how it go, you comin' up, they come 'round
The thinkin' I'm a one hit wonder
I'm out to take out Yeezy, you can't tell me nothin'
The topic of 609, on top of all the discussions
How much money I'm makin' and who Mike Zombie be fuckin'
Oh yeah they talkin' but I swear there's much left to do
Niggas made up a rumor I only be eatin' vegetables
I swear to God I can't make this shit up
I wanna meet whoever makes this shit up
You creative, nigga
This what you deal with when you quote on quote make it, nigga
Cause once you think you got your spot
That's when somebody gon' come behind your ass and come and take it, nigga
You never make it, nigga, you never make it, nigga
Prince of the 609
Haters on their job, money on my mind
Little more than all the time, all I think about is my mom
Sittin' in them Hills, what the fuck you thought was gon' happen
When that boy done gotta and started snappin' all on you niggas
Tried to make sure that a nigga didn't blow
Put a little smoke in the atmosphere, just for the Borough, gon' let them know
Man these niggas ain't fuckin' with I
Hit 'em in the head, make a nigga say "Ah"
I'm halfway on and a nigga don't lie
Yeah I spit coke, come and sniff this line
I do it for them niggas locked up in them prisons
Gettin' busy cause they gotta and tryna bring them ends in
Because livin' is expensive, they ain't livin' how they pictured
What the fuck you thought was gonna happen when they caught somebody slippin'?
No it's payback cause a nigga gonna say that I ain't goin' hard
And I just lay back, thinkin' 'bout that Maybach
And it ain't gonna be long 'fore I can say that
Bitch I'm 'bout to take that out that garage
Man these niggas better stay back
Cause a nigga don't play that
Bitch I'm goin' off, uh
It's Mr. 'Bout-to-be-mad-rich
Mouth full of punchlines like I got my ass kicked
Cup full of purple, chasin' green, colors clashin'
I can walk in anywhere and be the main attraction
Uh, got bitches badder than the boy that hit the ball
Hit them off once, never hit them up, if I want the puss she'll get the call
Fuckin' with me, that's bad luck like two niggas that split the pole
Bitch it's me, Young MZ, had to say it twice to make sure that you know
Guess what? Tonight I'm gettin' drink again
Goin' back to the club in the back of the club
Drankin' all of the drank, it don't matter to us
And a special appearance is me in the buildin', the bitches surround us
The bottles  are comin', the sparklers are flyin'
No smokin' here, but I'm smokin' a black and not givin' a fuck
What, shit I'm just actin' my age
Shit, I used to have the talent but what, lackin' the name
But now I got the name, now feel like I'm packin' AK
And once I get the aim, I'ma aim that shit right at the gameZombie on the track

[Hook]
I know i'ts been forever you ain't never seen a nigga like me
I know that you know nobody who can do it like me and
Girl you ain't the only one that's tying to be the only one
So if you want a nigga like me
Then you gon' have to show me something
Yeah. Said you gon' have to show me something x4

[Verse 1]
Yeah come show me something!
Show me something, bust it wide open
Please give me a reason why I should make you my only
And I really do believe I could have any girl I want that's straight
Looking, never chasing and I don't have time for stunting
Show me something, like your GPA
Yeah you up on all your car notes?
If you ain't and got red bottoms i'm why like the fuck you bought those
Please know who you fucking with, cause i ain't just no John Doe
I'm Meek Mill in my city about to run this shit like pronto
You better get me now cause ain't no telling where the time go
Cause once I blow up ima be so MIA, Lebron flow
I'm looking for the girl that's grinding trying get that condo
Your ex boyfriend got you going out your mind though
You crying all night, drinking all summer
Club everything night out here looking for a lover and
A nigga like me, you ain't never seen no better
Make me want you, talking always and forver

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Show me something
Exhibit all your benefits
Please make that shit good because i swear right now i'm [?]
And girl not only that, I got attention [?]
And I know that you bad, but what you doing that's relevant
That drama is you with that?
That money do you get that?
I ain't asking for me, i'm just seeing where your head at
Do you handle all your business?
Are you meeting all your endings?
Are you just blowing smoke?
You ain't perfect so girl i wanna know it all
Talking about flaws and all
Who you done been with?
Who done already broke your heart?
How long ago was this?
Is you done with him, or nah?
And you can ask me the same, cause i ain't gon' run no games
And if you lying then its bye-bye
You ain't wasting my time
Getting faded, fucking bitches I can do this all night
If you ain't down, then alright
You can settle for alright
You can keep on drinking and crying your tears out all night

[Intro]
Started...
(Zombie on the track)

[Hook]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fucking here

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my momma's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like, "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show and we...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here, that's popping off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'mma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house cause we...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame, cause we...

[Hook][Verse 1]
Started from the bottom now we here
We were sellin’ things, pullin' strings - puppeteer
Started with a dollar now I’m jumping out the Lear
All my niggas behind me, you can find me in the air
In the car smokin’ loud on my way to Mr. Chow’s
I say: “ain’t it funny now, nigga, this bracelet’s fifty thou”
He say he gon’ hit me, how? I keep shooters all around me
Quicker-picker-up your bitch, that pussy wet and I be Bounty
I got all these haters frontin’ just from lookin’ at my pictures
Plottin’ on my Instagram, they wanna follow me like Twitter
On my way home…
But I’mma hit her, did I mention, 30 grand’ll get you gone
You’ll come up missing ‘cause my cake long
Where your real friends at?
Hold up, fuck that, nigga, where your girlfriend at?
She probably in the VIP where all her girlfriends at
She know that you be hatin’ on me and I still hit that, damn
You gon’ need a green card for the Cuban link (ouch)
Cancel my account, I’ll probably move the bank
When you see them hammers out you’d best not move a blink
FN57, fuck around, shoot through a tank
Bitch, shake that ass, go on, shake them titties
Bitch, shake that ass like you work at Magic City
I be bustin’ bottles, ain’t talkin’ ‘bout with Drizzy
Probably be with OVO and I be in Toronto city
With yo fake ass, and yo fake weed
Frontin’ on a real nigga, bitch say cheese
And put your flash on just to catch the AP
Diamonds thunderin’ all in that bitch, I call it KD
Hold up – hold up, wait a minute, y’all thought I was finished?
I popped twenty bottles, that was just a scrimmage
Nigga, you ain’t ballin’, you pop twenty and you finished
Got you fuckin’ up your re-up every time we in the building
‘Cause we started from the bottom now we here
Sippin’ Rosé with Rozay and it’s Belaire
I signed with MMG and did it in a year
I started with a circle and I turned it to a square, ya dig?[Hook]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here

[Verse 1: Drake]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my mama’s house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryin' to get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show
And we...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Boys tell stories about ya man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I’mma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I’m in the house
Cause we...

[Hook]

[Bridge: Drake]
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stays the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Came in the game with no lane and then changed it
These fuck niggas'll say it in ten different ways
Then see you and smile in your face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
I’m smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that it’s fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound
Yeah, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down
Started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when I’m steerin'
Hope the homie Drake don’t get pissed
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasn’t trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'
Cause we…

[Hook]Zombie On The Track

[Bridge]
Yeah i'm a Jersey nigga. straight out the 609
Yeah i'm a Borro nigga, straight out the 609
Yeah i'm a Jersey nigga, straight out the 609
They ain't believe me when i said i was gon' blow
This the end of the beginning!

[Hook]
Yeah nigga ima show them how I did it from the bottom, from the top trying to get it
This the end of the beginning!
Yeah nigga, swear to God I was stressing
Ima show you niggas how i met the blessing
This the end of the beginning!
Yeah nigga, had to do it for the team now a nigga really living out the dream
This the end of the beginning!
Yeah nigga, had to do it for the city
Nigga hop up in the ride if you with me
This the end of the beginning

[Verse 1]
Uh, Yeah my mama bought me FL studio
6 years later me and Drizzy Drake up in the studio
DMS on YouTube after school, who knew that you would blow
Making all these beats up in my room no one would use them though
Got no money for my daughter, [?] about to loose it though
Ain't no money just to whip my ass, and kept it moving though
Moved down south and got the [?] sipping light was moving slow
DJ's wouldn't play my shit and neither would my city though
But it's Zombie on the track, OVO yeah that's major shit
[?] boys ain't fuck with a motto don't even say the shit
Backpack, snap-back, Supras I ain't changing shit
Niggas thought I was playing when i was saying
It's gon' be a sad song when a nigga getting dough
It's gon' be a sad song i'm on it and I blow
It's gon' be a sad song when you can't get in my show
When a nigga on top, and i'm looking down below
Cause this the end of the beginning!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh, man it ain't about now, it's about what happened though
17 but they just let me in so I can do the show
I get calls from prison, damn I want my fucking brother home
He stuck up in the system so i'm stuck in schools and studios
College is my plan but I love this fucking music though
Scared to do it because that dream is so stereotypical
They told me i was crazy if I really think i'm doing both
But fuck that shit, I did it
Now a nigga reppin' OVO
That's Zombie on the track, gon' be here always and forever
And I never gon' stop because this shit took me forever
Ima be a fucking legend, and the fact that you just doubted me just make me fucking laugh cause i'm only getting better
Call me Mr.Lottery cause i'm about to do the numbers
Spend it all when you get it cause you can't win this all over
Shoot first, then ask questions, live the life can't do it over
Put my city on my back, that's all I know!
